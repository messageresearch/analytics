[34:57] pulling on the gift of God I'm going to
[34:59] uh use Webster's definition of the word
[35:01] pull I think it's a very beautiful
[35:03] definition he says it is to exert force
[35:06] on someone or something so as to cause
[35:09] movement toward
[35:10] oneself it is an act of taking a hold of
[35:14] something and exerting Force Amen to
[35:17] draw it towards oneself it is a force
[35:19] drawing someone amen or something thank
[35:22] you brother in a particular amen
[35:24] direction or course of action now uh I
[35:27] believe tonight that God Amen wants us
[35:29] to pull on the gifts that he sent among
[35:32] the church I believe he wants us to pull
[35:34] on those gifts Amen in order to get the
[35:36] full value out of what is in those gifts
[35:39] now amen I believe that God also wants a
[35:41] people amen that will come to the full
[35:44] value of everything that he has promised
[35:46] them in the age we're living now in the
[35:48] in the message of Grace 1961 brother
[35:50] says now but they speaking of Israel he
[35:53] said didn't keep it amen but they never
[35:55] did come to the full promise not that
[35:57] generation no the one that promise was
[36:00] made perished in the wilderness amen but
[36:02] God fed them God took care of them God
[36:04] loved them he moved them around why his
[36:07] grace did it his grace because of his
[36:09] promise amen promis them the grace that
[36:12] went with his promise amen but they
[36:14] never did come to the full value of the
[36:16] promised land what a amen what a what a
[36:18] staggering thought that they never did
[36:20] come Amen to the full value of the
[36:23] promised land and neither he says does
[36:25] the church amen come to its full value
[36:28] the grace of God is what holds us but he
[36:30] wants to get a church that will obey him
[36:33] a people that will take his word and say
[36:35] it's the truth amen regardless of your
[36:38] organization he wants a people that will
[36:40] not say well I'm just as good as you are
[36:42] I'm Presbyterian or I'm Methodist I'm
[36:44] Catholic I'm as good as you are that's
[36:46] not Grace amen that shows there's
[36:48] something wrong now when you think about
[36:50] God wanting something I believe amen
[36:53] that what our God wants our God gets
[36:55] amen I believe that that I believe he's
[36:57] God and I believe if he desires
[36:59] something Our God has the ability Amen
[37:02] to see his desire come into
[37:03] manifestation so therefore amen I
[37:06] believe tonight that God has already
[37:08] provided a way amen for the Believers to
[37:11] come to the full value amen of the
[37:14] promises in the age that we're living in
[37:16] in Ephesians 4:8 as we read the Bible
[37:18] said amen wherefore he saith when he
[37:20] ascended up on high he gave he led
[37:23] captivity captive amen and gave gifts
[37:26] unto men in Romans 11:29 the Bible says
[37:29] for the gifts and calling of God Amen
[37:32] are without repentance now when you
[37:35] start looking at this word gift the
[37:36] Greek definition amen of course it is a
[37:39] free gift so it's not something you buy
[37:41] or something you earned amen but rather
[37:43] it's something given by almighty God and
[37:45] this word means Grace or it's gifts
[37:47] denoting extraordinary powers now this
[37:50] what I want to focus on it is
[37:52] distinguishing amen certain Christians
[37:54] and enabling them to serve the Church of
[37:57] Christ amen so when a gift is recognized
[38:00] in the life of an individual amen that
[38:02] gift is not there to promote the
[38:04] individual not there to build the
[38:06] individual or to build a kingdom or to
[38:08] build a following unto the individual
[38:10] amen but rather that gift has been
[38:12] placed there sovereignly by God Amen to
[38:15] enable that individual to serve the body
[38:18] of Christ it is the reception amen of
[38:21] which is due to the power of divine
[38:23] grace amen operating on their souls by
[38:26] the Holy Spirit In other words anything
[38:29] they bring that will have a benefit to
[38:31] the church amen is not going to come by
[38:33] an educational ability not going to come
[38:36] by an intellectual ability amen but it
[38:38] will come by the grace of God that is
[38:40] found a way to operate through the soul
[38:43] of the individual in whom God has
[38:45] deposited the gift now as I already said
[38:48] gifts of God are not earned amen but
[38:50] rather gifts of God are sent amen and
[38:52] they are placed by God in Malachi 4:5
[38:55] you know the Bible says behold I will
[38:57] send you Elijah the prophet now see that
[39:01] will be before the coming of the great
[39:03] and Dreadful day of the Lord in St John
[39:05] 1 ver6 the Bible says amen that there
[39:08] was a man that was sent from God whose
[39:11] name was John now the brother B says
[39:13] something very beautiful he said now if
[39:14] I said I could heal you then I'd be
[39:16] telling you something wrong I cannot
[39:18] heal you amen what is it it's a gift
[39:21] that I have that God gave me not
[39:23] somebody laid hands on me that don't
[39:25] work see gifts and callings are without
[39:28] repentance you're born with them in all
[39:30] your life the Bible said so see Moses
[39:32] was born a prophet amen John the Baptist
[39:35] 712 years before he was born he was a
[39:38] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[39:40] God told Jeremiah before you ever even
[39:42] was conceived in your mother's womb I
[39:45] knew you and Sanctified you and ordained
[39:47] you amen a prophet to the nation see
[39:50] it's God's election calling not that
[39:53] you're any better than anybody else amen
[39:55] we are all all the same see we're just
[39:58] children but God has chose some Amen to
[40:00] be one thing and some to be another if
[40:03] you pick where God chose you then you
[40:05] can yield yourself and that spirit will
[40:07] work through you just like these
[40:08] ministers here well they're called
[40:10] preachers the preacher he said I'm not a
[40:12] preacher I wouldn't say I was a preacher
[40:14] because I have no education but some men
[40:17] amen can get up and preach to when
[40:19] they're preaching inspired amen they
[40:21] yield themselves to the spirit of God
[40:24] Amen they have a way of doing that so
[40:26] when you begin to wonder how can a
[40:28] Ministry amen preach the way they preach
[40:30] or say the things they say or operate in
[40:33] the in the in the measure that they're
[40:35] operating in it's not because of their
[40:37] their ability as a human amen but it's
[40:39] because there is a gift amen that's been
[40:42] deposited into that life amen and the
[40:45] way that gift is operated is not by a
[40:47] bunch of learning or by a bunch of
[40:48] degrees amen but it is operated by the
[40:51] individual being able to get themsel out
[40:53] of the way Amen in order for The God Who
[40:56] to place the gift there Amen to come
[40:58] into the body of Christ that his people
[41:00] could receive the value of what he
[41:02] deposited in the individual now I'll say
[41:05] this I believe that God has elected some
[41:07] people Amen to hear the gifts amen that
[41:10] God has sent in this generation and let
[41:11] me say this I believe that God has
[41:13] elected us Amen to be more than church
[41:16] members I believe he's elected us to be
[41:18] more than just musicians or amen more
[41:20] than just officers but I believe God
[41:23] Amen has elected us to be contenders
[41:26] amen because the thing that we are
[41:28] receiving amen is something worth
[41:30] contending for amen the things that
[41:32] these gifts are preaching to the church
[41:34] amen are things that are worth
[41:36] contending for I believe that our
[41:38] contention amen is not for a personality
[41:41] it is not for a direction it is not for
[41:43] a move around the message amen but I
[41:46] believe our contention is for the faith
[41:49] of Jesus Christ now Jude 1:3 says
[41:51] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[41:53] write unto you of the common salvation
[41:56] it was needful for me Amen to write unto
[41:59] you and to exhort you that you should
[42:01] earnestly contend for the faith amen
[42:03] which was once delivered to the Saints
[42:06] now the prophet of God said contention
[42:07] is all right if it's for the right thing
[42:10] and he said to earnestly contend for the
[42:12] faith that was once delivered unto the
[42:15] Saints now you hear so many people today
[42:17] they say oh Divine healings against my
[42:19] faith the baptism of the holy spirit is
[42:21] against my faith see there's only one
[42:23] faith and that Faith doesn't come by
[42:25] joining a church that faith comes by
[42:27] hearing and that of the word of God
[42:29] again in 1954 he said my contentions
[42:32] through the Christian church today beond
[42:35] the Realms of theology my contention is
[42:38] that Jesus is Alive among the Christian
[42:40] people and just as real as he ever was
[42:43] amen and he is a manifesting himself in
[42:46] his deity amen and power to forgive sin
[42:49] to heal the sick to make the lame walk
[42:51] to make the blind see amen and to
[42:53] perform everything that he did when he
[42:55] was here on Earth he will do it yet now
[42:58] so here's a prophet saying I'm not
[43:00] contending amen for a church for a
[43:02] denomination I'm contending amen that if
[43:05] the same faith that was delivered to the
[43:07] Saints amen is recognized in the midst
[43:10] of the church in the last days amen that
[43:12] faith is going to operate and it's going
[43:15] to manifest itself the same way that it
[43:17] did back there again he says what my
[43:19] contention is and what my Ministry is is
[43:22] to contend amen that Jesus Christ the
[43:25] son of God
[43:26] is not dead amen I think that's a good
[43:29] point of contention for every believer
[43:31] amen that Jesus Christ the son of God is
[43:34] not dead his body is sitting on the
[43:36] throne of God in glory amen but the
[43:38] spirit that was in him is right here now
[43:41] in the church amen and it is moving
[43:44] among his people amen that is according
[43:46] to his word now listen without a prophet
[43:49] we cannot identify amen what is moving
[43:51] Among The Church Without a prophet we do
[43:53] not know amen who is in our midst
[43:56] amen but behold I will send you a gift
[43:59] and it will be the gift of the seventh
[44:01] angel and he will identify that the word
[44:04] has returned in the midst of the church
[44:06] and what he did In the Flesh of Jesus he
[44:08] is doing in the flesh of the believer
[44:10] amen now I believe it I don't believe
[44:12] these things are accidental I believe
[44:14] they're ordained and I believe that God
[44:16] Amen has ordained five offices amen by
[44:19] for knowledge and placed it in the
[44:21] church amen for every age now is it okay
[44:24] if we just read a little bit here
[44:25] tonight in the book of Ephesians the 4th
[44:27] chapter amen the 11th verse if you begin
[44:29] to read there amen the Bible says that
[44:31] he gave some
[44:33] Apostles and he gave some prophets and
[44:36] some evangelist and some pastors and
[44:38] teachers now if you got your Bible there
[44:41] amen why don't you underline those three
[44:42] words he gave some he gave some Apostles
[44:46] and some prophets and some evangelists
[44:48] and some pastors and some teachers I
[44:51] want you to catch this here he gave some
[44:53] not he gave all so he didn't give all
[44:56] pastors all pastors all evangelist amen
[44:59] so what he does is he's a god of variety
[45:02] amen so he gave some prophets he gave
[45:04] some pastors he gave some teachers he
[45:06] gave some evangelist amen and the
[45:08] prophet identifies this and says it's
[45:10] five offices amen it's God's dress wear
[45:14] amen so the prophet can dress you a
[45:16] certain way and then the pastor will add
[45:18] more clothing another way and then the
[45:20] Evangelist and then the teacher and the
[45:21] Apostle amen but notice here what
[45:23] they're doing is they're enabling by God
[45:26] amen the church not to come up in the
[45:28] Revelation three condition amen that
[45:30] they're wretched miserable blind and
[45:33] naked and they put it on the whole armor
[45:35] of God said what is it it's God dressed
[45:37] up in his church when you see those
[45:39] offices pastors teachers evangelist what
[45:42] is that that is God's dress wear amen
[45:45] God's presence God's spirit working
[45:47] through the man and if that office
[45:49] denize any of this word amen then it's
[45:52] not God dressing amen so if some prophet
[45:55] or some Pastor or some evangelist or
[45:58] some teacher amen denies any part of
[46:01] God's word amen God is not in that man
[46:04] amen dressing the bride he said that is
[46:06] the wolf and sheep's clothing amen watch
[46:09] that fellow beware of him but when he
[46:11] just takes the word and says remember
[46:14] that's God see CU God is speaking his
[46:16] word he says well amen it isn't oh oh my
[46:20] go get to go sheep get to go now brother
[46:22] saying that Amen to identify that in the
[46:24] last days amen that men will invade
[46:27] offices that they have no business in
[46:29] amen and they'll begin to teach things
[46:31] and establish things amen and leave the
[46:33] church in a direction amen that is
[46:36] contrary to the word of God now when
[46:38] they do these things this is not
[46:39] something amen that is new this is the
[46:42] spirit that's been working for years
[46:44] amen but here's a prophet on the scene
[46:46] and he says but God's dress wear will
[46:48] not dress you Amen in something of
[46:50] denomination he will dress you by the
[46:53] word I love how the prophet of God says
[46:55] each office amen backs up the other amen
[46:58] so it's not the prophet competing
[47:00] against the Evangelist and the
[47:02] Evangelist competing against the pastor
[47:04] amen but they're all working together
[47:06] and they're backing each other up amen
[47:09] now I believe that the true gifts of God
[47:11] of Ephesians for amen they are sent into
[47:13] the body Amen to achieve something for
[47:16] the body of Christ amen the prophet of
[47:19] God said no matter how great a teacher
[47:20] is how powerful he is how intellectual
[47:23] he is or how his gift operates if he
[47:25] isn't trying to achieve something amen
[47:28] for the benefit of the body of Christ
[47:30] amen your own spiritual discernment
[47:32] would tell you that's
[47:34] wrong no matter how accurate how perfect
[47:37] how it is it's wrong if it isn't used
[47:40] for the body of Jesus Christ amen to
[47:43] achieve something maybe he's got a great
[47:44] gift he could draw people together with
[47:46] a great intellectual spiritual power
[47:48] that he could draw people together and
[47:49] maybe he's trying to take that gift and
[47:51] make himself famous so he'll have a big
[47:53] name or so other men Brethren will look
[47:54] up to him as a big person amen that's
[47:56] wrong see or maybe he's trying to edify
[47:59] a certain thing here that he wants
[48:00] everybody else to get out of the picture
[48:02] and let him in his group be the picture
[48:04] that's still wrong see if he has a gift
[48:06] of God and he's trying to edify the body
[48:09] of Christ amen then I don't care what he
[48:11] belongs to you're not Discerning the man
[48:14] you're Discerning the spirit amen the
[48:17] life that's in the man and that's what
[48:19] God told us to do not one was told one
[48:21] time was we ever commissioned to discern
[48:24] the man's group but we was constrained
[48:26] and commanded by God to discern the
[48:29] spirit in the man what he's trying to do
[48:32] what the spirit in his life is trying to
[48:34] lead him to now let me say this if it's
[48:36] a true God calleded gift amen they're
[48:38] only going to preach the absolute truth
[48:42] they're not just going to preach what
[48:43] they think is truth they're going to
[48:45] preach the absolute truth because it's
[48:47] the only thing that will bring the body
[48:49] of Christ to Perfection amen continuing
[48:51] in Ephesians 4:12 Paul goes on to say
[48:54] amen for the perfecting of the Saints
[48:57] amen for the work of the ministry amen
[48:59] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[49:02] amen that's a powerful word they're
[49:03] edifying that word edifying means to
[49:06] build up amen it is the act of one who
[49:09] promotes another's growth Amen in
[49:11] Christian wisdom happiness and Holiness
[49:14] amen so when you see one of these
[49:15] five-fold offices operating amen they're
[49:18] not operating to tear down the body but
[49:21] they're operating to build up the body
[49:23] to promote growth in the Church of the
[49:25] Living God in the message and ins sign
[49:27] brother said for what purpose amen for
[49:29] the man to glorify himself amen for the
[49:32] edification of the church amen to bring
[49:35] the church to a living faith in Christ
[49:38] amen so the preaching of the Gospel amen
[49:41] the teaching of the Gospel the
[49:42] establishing of the missionary amen the
[49:45] prophetic utterance of the Prophet amen
[49:47] the the amen the ox of the team the
[49:49] pastor amen that is not there Amen to
[49:52] kill the church amen to divide the
[49:54] church but that is there to bring the
[49:56] church to a living faith amen that Jesus
[49:59] Christ is the Son of God Amen and
[50:01] they're not contending for a church
[50:03] they're not contending for a group amen
[50:05] but they are contending that Jesus the
[50:07] son of God is alive and his power is
[50:10] real and his anointing is manifesting
[50:13] amen there's victory in the word there's
[50:15] overcoming power in the word I say oh
[50:17] God let us get back to preaching amen
[50:20] the pure unadulterated absolute truth of
[50:22] the word of God in the age we're living
[50:25] in he said see till we all come verse 13
[50:27] till we all come Amen in the unity of
[50:30] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[50:32] Son of God watch this unto a perfect
[50:35] man unto the measure of the stature of
[50:38] the fullness of Christ now I love verse
[50:40] 14 that we henceforth be no more
[50:43] children tossed to and fro and carried
[50:47] about with every wind of Doctrine amen
[50:49] by the Slate of men and cunning
[50:51] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[50:53] deceive now the Propet of God there is
[50:56] speaking of more amen than just than
[50:58] just uh than just uh adolescence amen
[51:01] but he's speaking of
[51:02] adoption that there will come an
[51:05] adoption upon the church that there'll
[51:07] be no more children tossed to and fro
[51:09] listen what a prophet says he says now
[51:11] every great achievement is tied to an
[51:13] absolute you cannot run this life
[51:15] without having an absolute you cannot
[51:17] make an achievement without it being an
[51:19] absolute for it is the final TI poost it
[51:22] is the hitch rack at the end of The
[51:23] Journey it's a place where you are tied
[51:25] to something and in the day that we're
[51:27] living in now everything is so breaken
[51:29] up it's so fragile and carried away he
[51:32] said I think that this message would be
[51:33] a very appropriate thing especially to
[51:35] Christians when they are going through
[51:37] their deep Waters now amen the Christian
[51:39] church is passing through the deepest
[51:41] Waters it's had amen for the last 2,000
[51:44] years because we are coming to a spot
[51:47] where there is something presented to
[51:49] Christianity something they have to make
[51:50] a decision on and I think that the
[51:53] Christian Church ought to have something
[51:54] that they know they are tied to instead
[51:57] of just floating about like a leaf upon
[51:59] the Water the wind as the Bible said
[52:01] carried about with every wind of
[52:03] Doctrine see the winds come and blow
[52:05] this Leaf this way and then another wind
[52:07] Comes The North Wind South Wind East
[52:09] Wind West Wind you'll never get anywhere
[52:11] you're not stabled amen now listen to a
[52:14] prophet the Christian Life should be a
[52:17] stable life amen the Christian Life
[52:19] should be a stable life in other words
[52:22] you're not in one day and out the next
[52:25] you're not in one service and out the
[52:27] next amen but if you're ever in you're
[52:29] always in amen cuz you didn't put
[52:31] yourself in amen but the ele and favor
[52:34] of almighty God Amen put you in by the
[52:36] blood of Jesus Christ and there's
[52:38] nothing can take you out listen I'll
[52:40] tell you this the devil don't want me to
[52:42] say it but I'm going to say it amen some
[52:44] days we're going to be up and some days
[52:46] we're going to be down but can I say
[52:48] this if you got the holy ghost in your
[52:50] soul and you are sealed until the day of
[52:52] your Redemption amen you may get up and
[52:54] you may get down but you never go in and
[52:56] out amen because if a man ever comes in
[52:59] Christ he is sealed until the day of his
[53:02] Redemption and there's no trouble
[53:04] there's no trial there's no situation
[53:07] amen there's no disappointments there's
[53:08] no bad days hard days Victory come on
[53:11] church amen Victory will reain in the
[53:13] life of believer amen because they're
[53:15] not pulling from a man they're not
[53:17] pulling from Shawn Martin they're not
[53:19] pulling from Andrew Clover they're not
[53:21] pulling from Wayne Lawson or Josh B amen
[53:23] or any other preacher amen are pulling
[53:25] from the gift amen that God has
[53:27] deposited into this generation to preach
[53:30] a message and that message is the
[53:32] absolute and if that message of absolute
[53:34] power ever finds a place in the soul of
[53:37] a Believer the devil is finished amen
[53:40] sin is over the devil's lost the battle
[53:43] because it brings them to a place of
[53:46] stability my goodness we're not up one
[53:49] day amen in alha X we may get up and we
[53:52] may get down but a Christian don't go in
[53:54] and out
[53:57] can I get a witness here a Christian
[54:00] don't go in and out when a Christian
[54:02] comes in Christ he's sealed
[54:05] in until the day of his Redemption the
[54:08] Christian Life should be a stable life
[54:11] it should be something that's a
[54:13] principle that you're tied to now look
[54:16] at verse 15 now if you're going to come
[54:18] to a stable life sometimes people has
[54:21] got to speak the truth to you in love
[54:24] but speaking the truth and love that we
[54:27] may grow up into him in all things which
[54:30] is the head even Christ now watch this
[54:33] that we may grow up into him in all
[54:35] things which is the head even Christ now
[54:38] come on parents what do you tell kids
[54:40] amen I wish you'd grow up you know why
[54:42] you say that is because you're ready for
[54:45] a level of maturity to be manifested in
[54:48] their life now listen they can't just
[54:50] hear those words and do it you can stand
[54:52] there and beat them down grow up grow up
[54:54] amen but somebody's got to set an
[54:55] example of something that's higher than
[54:57] where they are and then they purpose in
[54:59] their heart Amen to obtain the higher
[55:02] calling and this message was more than
[55:04] just another sermon it was more than
[55:07] just a better idea about the godhead
[55:09] this message was the mark of the prize
[55:11] of the high calling in Christ Jesus that
[55:14] he could set a standard before the
[55:16] church and say listen there's more to
[55:18] this thing than just going to church and
[55:20] paying your TI and being a member of a
[55:22] church but Jesus Christ the son of God
[55:25] God has returned to the church in the
[55:27] power of Revelation and he said grow up
[55:29] in all things amen which is the head
[55:32] even Christ For Whom the whole body is
[55:34] fitly joined together amen and in
[55:37] compacted by that which every joint
[55:39] suppli amen according to the effectual
[55:42] working in the measure of every part
[55:45] look at those words amen and maketh
[55:47] increase amen listen church amen if the
[55:50] prophet and the pastor and the
[55:52] Evangelist and the teacher and the
[55:54] apostle amen will all preach the
[55:56] absolute truth then the body will not
[55:58] decrease but the body will increase unto
[56:01] the edifying of itself in love let me
[56:04] say this to you and don't you ever
[56:05] forget this amen concerning the gifts of
[56:08] Ephesians 4 amen God sent those gifts to
[56:10] help the body not to hurt the
[56:13] body God sent those gifts to help the
[56:16] body not to hurt the body can I give you
[56:19] another one God sent those gifts to
[56:21] unite the body not divide the body can I
[56:24] give you another one God sent those
[56:26] gifts Amen to separate the body from sin
[56:28] and unbelief can I give you another one
[56:30] he didn't send those gifts on accident
[56:33] he sent him on purpose can I give you
[56:35] another one and what he SS he testifies
[56:38] of in other words the man don't have to
[56:41] promote himself he don't have to blow
[56:43] his horn and tell what he's done and
[56:45] what he's preached and how powerful amen
[56:47] but if God is with that gift amen if it
[56:49] is a god- sent gift amen then the god of
[56:52] Heaven Come on church amen I I'm just
[56:54] going take the gloves off and preach for
[56:56] a second amen cuz we got a lot of people
[56:58] amen that get in their mind amen if they
[57:00] were born in a certain family or they
[57:02] were friends with the right preacher or
[57:03] they was connected to the right group
[57:05] amen maybe they could get ahead life
[57:07] amen do you mean to tell me that God is
[57:10] big enough to put a gift in your life
[57:12] and then a bunch of preachers are big
[57:13] enough Amen to stop that gift from
[57:15] coming to manifestation brother if God
[57:18] placed that gift he will testify that
[57:20] gift and if he wants to use it in the
[57:22] jungle he'll use it if he wants to use
[57:24] it in the he'll use it come on I know a
[57:26] lot of y'all think amen that I just
[57:28] started preaching amen traveling around
[57:30] everywhere amen but I spent F first few
[57:32] years of my Ministry Amen in a homeless
[57:34] shelter amen preaching to homeless
[57:36] people amen the message of the hour in a
[57:38] Methodist Church they didn't like it but
[57:40] I preach it amen and I say this and I
[57:42] thank God for those days because it
[57:44] taught me how to preach the message
[57:46] against
[57:48] opposition I'll tell you this just
[57:50] quickly I remember one of the first
[57:51] times ever preached on her brother Kevin
[57:53] what it was was a homeless shelter and
[57:55] they'd bring all the homeless in on
[57:56] Tuesday night and they'd feed him a
[57:58] they'd feed him a meal and then they
[57:59] open the pantry and give him some some
[58:01] food and things to take with them and I
[58:03] remember preaching there amen actually
[58:05] got in there by my family members amen
[58:07] they took me in there and I got up and I
[58:08] didn't know no better I mean that's just
[58:10] a 13-year-old kid you know I got up
[58:12] started preaching John 4 the woman at
[58:14] the well there was a seat in her and God
[58:16] sent a prophet with a message Amen to
[58:18] Quicken that seat Amen brother Kevin I
[58:20] never will forget it as just a kid
[58:21] preacher I seen the power of God drop in
[58:24] a basement and I watched homeless people
[58:26] amen weep their eyes out at the message
[58:29] of the hour and a bunch of dignified
[58:30] denominations wind up on the wall and
[58:33] they folded their arms and blowed up and
[58:34] got mad amen one brother told me he said
[58:37] you'll never be back here again so about
[58:39] 6 months later I got a phone call and
[58:41] when I got the phone call I said I
[58:43] didn't think I was ever coming back they
[58:44] said well none of the elders want you
[58:46] but the homeless people do I thought
[58:48] well that must be a good thing amen amen
[58:50] we got something to say amen and if God
[58:53] called you amen if you got to stand
[58:54] stand in a nursing home if you got to
[58:56] stand on a street corner if you preach a
[58:58] convention or you preach a special
[59:00] meeting what difference does it make
[59:02] amen it's not about the preacher it's
[59:04] about the body amen coming to the
[59:07] headship of Christ that they may grow up
[59:09] into a stable life to manifest Christ in
[59:12] every situation amen I believe if God
[59:14] calls a man God Will Make A Way for the
[59:16] man come on and I believe God will put
[59:19] somebody Amen to hear what he says now
[59:22] amen I'm this close to it I might as
[59:23] well say it amen God God called gifts to
[59:25] not promote other things outside of the
[59:30] message now I know that might choke some
[59:34] but we're not interested in what the
[59:35] latest Dr Dobson
[59:37] ideas we want to know what's been
[59:39] Vindicated to be the truth now the
[59:42] prophet said Lord send your spirit and
[59:44] give people Faith amen oh God get in
[59:48] trouble sure as the world you know me
[59:50] you preach the message is that okay amen
[59:55] and I don't think we ought to be
[59:56] preaching things amen the denominations
[59:58] are talking about we're not chickens
[1:00:00] we're Eagles so if come on now amen some
[1:00:03] of Y Amen brother will sister hope amen
[1:00:05] y'all didn't sit down there and traffic
[1:00:07] all morning and then fight your way to
[1:00:09] get to church amen to hear some little
[1:00:10] Baptist idea or some little story amen
[1:00:13] come on y'all didn't come here tonight
[1:00:15] amen over weary bodies and tied Spirits
[1:00:17] Amen to hear somebody get up and talk
[1:00:19] about some conspiracy theory or some
[1:00:22] something that has nothing to do with
[1:00:23] the bride amen you can't here because
[1:00:25] you're Eagles and the word of God said
[1:00:27] where the carcass is amen there where
[1:00:29] the Eagles be gathered together and I
[1:00:31] think if we're going to stand before
[1:00:32] Eagles we ought to preach Eagle food I
[1:00:35] think if we're going to gather some
[1:00:36] Eagles together and have a meeting we
[1:00:38] ought to put some Eagle food on the
[1:00:40] table and let the Eagles get some Elbow
[1:00:42] Room and go to feeding on the revelation
[1:00:45] of the bread of Jesus Christ in the eggs
[1:00:47] that God has sent it down
[1:00:49] in it's the only thing that will edify
[1:00:52] the
[1:00:53] church now some times he said it
[1:00:55] startles them Father they cannot realize
[1:00:57] the presence this great thing the
[1:00:59] Jehovah of the Old Testament is the
[1:01:01] Jesus of the new the Holy Spirit of this
[1:01:04] day standing here tonight to make good
[1:01:06] any promise he made then send your gifts
[1:01:09] he said now watch that it might work to
[1:01:11] bring the people to edify the church to
[1:01:14] bring us to a realization of your
[1:01:17] presence so the gifts the the the the
[1:01:21] officers of those
[1:01:23] gifts is to preach a word that will
[1:01:26] bring a spirit in the building that will
[1:01:28] cause people to recognize what others
[1:01:31] can't see now God sends the gifts to
[1:01:34] glorify God and not the man and here you
[1:01:37] H 1957 he said now this little gift has
[1:01:40] the that the Lord by his grace has given
[1:01:42] to me is not anything to glorify me if
[1:01:45] I'd ever do that it might leave me I
[1:01:46] might leave the world it's not for me
[1:01:48] it's for you that's the reason I can't
[1:01:51] operate it you're the only one who does
[1:01:54] do
[1:01:55] it now if we would really take those
[1:01:57] words to heart we would quit making the
[1:01:59] preacher come in and work for 30 minutes
[1:02:02] to finally get one amen now don't get
[1:02:04] mad at me I'm just going to preach a
[1:02:05] little bit here amen I've literally
[1:02:07] heard people say a oh god I've Lally
[1:02:10] heard people say well we've never heard
[1:02:11] a preacher preach like that amen well
[1:02:13] let me say this amen sometimes you got
[1:02:15] to open the
[1:02:17] gift come on you got to open the gift
[1:02:20] are you hearing me amen and if you don't
[1:02:22] open the gift amen and you go to another
[1:02:24] meeting and hear the same preacher amen
[1:02:26] don't get mad at them people and say
[1:02:28] well he was oh come on well he just
[1:02:30] preaching like that cuz there was more
[1:02:31] people no a man preaches by the
[1:02:34] operation of the gift by the people
[1:02:36] listen we don't practice these sir one
[1:02:38] time Daniel and I was out somewhere and
[1:02:40] somebody asked me they said how long do
[1:02:41] it take you to practice a sermon I I
[1:02:43] kind of looked at the woman I said sorry
[1:02:45] sis she said practice a sermon you know
[1:02:47] get all your moves down there I thought
[1:02:49] practice a sermon amen but that's the
[1:02:51] mindset of people amen they think the
[1:02:53] pullit is a performance they think it's
[1:02:55] a place a man gets up and shows off his
[1:02:58] knowledge and shows off what he's
[1:02:59] memorized listen yes God has given some
[1:03:01] men with the ability to remember things
[1:03:03] and to quote things amen but at the end
[1:03:05] of the day when it's all said and done
[1:03:07] if you want an answer from God you got
[1:03:09] to get off your Ash Heap and you got to
[1:03:11] start pulling on the gift of God if you
[1:03:13] want the power of God Amen to break out
[1:03:15] in the church come on job I know you're
[1:03:17] on the ash Heap amen but even if you're
[1:03:19] on the ash Heap God is still God and His
[1:03:22] word is still true and power is still
[1:03:25] real and if you'll just start pulling
[1:03:27] God will go to moving if you'll start
[1:03:29] crying God will go to answering if
[1:03:31] you'll start pushing back God will go to
[1:03:33] tearing down walls and he'll bring an
[1:03:35] anointing in the church oh God
[1:03:39] hallelujah I'm talking about somebody
[1:03:41] learning to put some force on the
[1:03:43] preacher and
[1:03:46] pull now I know I know people say well
[1:03:50] that's Pentecostal no ACC spiritual
[1:03:52] scriptural let me move on now if I come
[1:03:53] here with every such a great gift and
[1:03:55] you people come and say I don't believe
[1:03:56] nothing to it nothing to it at all
[1:03:58] there'd be nothing
[1:04:00] happen so therefore it doesn't take me
[1:04:02] it takes you and I
[1:04:04] both it takes both of us to operate the
[1:04:08] gift of God are you ready for this the
[1:04:11] gift comes on me and you operate it by
[1:04:14] your
[1:04:16] faith Now watch how many understands
[1:04:19] that see so no man can say oh it's me it
[1:04:21] is and it's God neither is it you
[1:04:24] now I've seen some people that they're
[1:04:26] pretty proud in the way they
[1:04:29] pull now don't get mad at me they're
[1:04:32] pretty proud in the way they pull but
[1:04:34] let me say this amen if a preacher got
[1:04:36] up and was proud the way he preached he
[1:04:37] wouldn't want to preach hear him preach
[1:04:39] to
[1:04:40] you come on now and amen if a man's so
[1:04:44] arrogant that he thinks he's the
[1:04:45] greatest puller ever was come on now I
[1:04:47] got to I got a problem listen it's not a
[1:04:50] show it's about getting in the spirit
[1:04:53] and letting God come in the the building
[1:04:54] and do things that none of us could do
[1:04:57] it isn't me it isn't you you couldn't
[1:04:59] operate it unless it was somewhere to be
[1:05:01] operated amen I couldn't operate unless
[1:05:03] there was something to operate through
[1:05:04] see I am the vine and ye are the
[1:05:06] branches amen Jesus gives the energy and
[1:05:09] we collect it Jesus gives the energy and
[1:05:13] we collect it amen listen as the word is
[1:05:15] going forth that's more than scriptures
[1:05:18] brother Branson that's more than quotes
[1:05:20] amen but that is energy amen come on
[1:05:22] we're in an hour when everybody needs
[1:05:23] some energy right amen 5our energies Red
[1:05:26] Bulls monsters all kinds of crazy things
[1:05:28] amen just to get some energy well listen
[1:05:30] that's in the natural amen but what
[1:05:32] about in the spiritual we got a Finish
[1:05:34] Line to Cross Church we got a battle to
[1:05:37] win we got a war to win and it ain't
[1:05:39] time to get lazy and it ain't time to
[1:05:41] back off of the way we have church I
[1:05:43] think if there's ever been a time we
[1:05:45] ought to blow the windows out of the
[1:05:46] building and Shout the cwes out the
[1:05:48] sound system I think Now's the Time to
[1:05:51] do it and let the Holy Ghost come in the
[1:05:53] church and the power of His
[1:05:54] manifestation and reveal the answers and
[1:05:57] reveal the secrets and move as he
[1:05:59] desires to move I think it's time to get
[1:06:02] back to having
[1:06:03] Church come on I think if we're going to
[1:06:05] clean up and show up we ought to have
[1:06:09] church oh brother Andrew you don't know
[1:06:12] what I'm going through well I don't need
[1:06:13] to know what you're going through and
[1:06:15] let me just reverse that you don't know
[1:06:17] what I'm going through and you don't
[1:06:18] need to know what I'm going through but
[1:06:20] there is one person that knows about us
[1:06:22] all and his name name is Jesus
[1:06:26] Christ Oh Glory to God it's in the
[1:06:29] building so I might as well preach time
[1:06:31] to grow up I said it's time to grow up
[1:06:34] there are going to be things happen that
[1:06:36] you don't like but you got to grow up
[1:06:39] come on now amen there's going to be
[1:06:40] song sung that you don't like but you
[1:06:42] got to grow up I said you got to grow up
[1:06:45] you know why because this ain't about
[1:06:47] you this ain't about me it's about Jesus
[1:06:50] Christ coming in the midst of his people
[1:06:52] and performing his word according to the
[1:06:55] Vindicated promise he y'all know what
[1:06:57] I'm talking about am mean if we ain't
[1:06:59] careful we going to have the atmosphere
[1:07:01] so locked down amen we can't even get
[1:07:02] enough moisture to spit before long amen
[1:07:05] cuz somebody didn't sing the right song
[1:07:07] or they sung to new of a song or the
[1:07:09] drums were too fast or the preacher was
[1:07:11] too loud or the speakers were too hot
[1:07:13] amen what in the name of God has
[1:07:14] happened to us that we can't even just
[1:07:16] have church no more I think we ought to
[1:07:18] blow them Devils Back To Hell and
[1:07:20] release the atmosphere and let the Holy
[1:07:23] Ghost have a rattle let him save our
[1:07:25] babies let him fill our young people let
[1:07:27] him revive our church let him send a
[1:07:29] healing let him send a manifestation
[1:07:32] take the breaks off and just have church
[1:07:34] again until you didn't care what time it
[1:07:39] was I know what I'm talking about I'm
[1:07:41] sorry I wasn't hashed out of some
[1:07:43] intellectual preaching style amen sister
[1:07:45] hope I was hashed out y'all remember
[1:07:47] them days when we used to preach and and
[1:07:49] shout and you'd hear some stomping going
[1:07:51] on and you'd look back and hope was Shou
[1:07:53] all over the building you know what it
[1:07:55] was it was because somebody had taken
[1:07:58] the restrictions off of the atmosphere
[1:08:00] and recognized there's a God who is a
[1:08:02] holy God and he's come in the midst of
[1:08:04] his church as the mighty conqueror and
[1:08:07] he's not here as an onlooker he's here
[1:08:09] as a deliverer he's here as a way maker
[1:08:11] he's here as a miracle worker I say oh
[1:08:14] God open up the windows of heaven and
[1:08:16] fill Faith Tabernacle with the Dynamics
[1:08:18] of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:21] again that church you want to have
[1:08:24] church we might as well have church
[1:08:26] let's get back to where we didn't care
[1:08:28] how long service
[1:08:30] was let's just have church y'all
[1:08:33] remember them Sunday night meetings come
[1:08:35] on y'all remember y'all remember we
[1:08:37] didn't wait for them to get over we
[1:08:38] couldn't believe they were
[1:08:41] over I tell you what happens is people
[1:08:43] get a little
[1:08:45] opinionated they don't think we ought to
[1:08:47] sing certain songs and so they get this
[1:08:50] idea that well if we're going to have a
[1:08:52] move of God we got to sing some old
[1:08:54] songs that don't get mad at me okay but
[1:08:57] I've been in meetings where we have sung
[1:08:59] songs that Luther didn't even
[1:09:02] sing and it didn't change the atmosphere
[1:09:04] one
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:07] bit well glory to God I feel like
[1:09:10] preaching it didn't change now come on
[1:09:12] you know why it didn't change atmosphere
[1:09:14] is because it wasn't done out of
[1:09:16] humility it was done out of arrogance
[1:09:19] well we're not going to sing way maker
[1:09:20] and we're not going to sing Our God is
[1:09:22] awesome amen cuz we're too spiritual for
[1:09:24] that come and people holler oh going to
[1:09:27] get in trouble Sister Kim they holler
[1:09:29] about not singing Hill song Amen in

[1:09:44] out of being baby

[1:09:49] bunch of Bob tered women up here singing
[1:09:50] those songs there's Holy Ghost filled
[1:09:52] message believers that have taken the
[1:09:54] words of those songs and they have found
[1:09:56] an atmosphere come on I say sing them
[1:09:58] church I say sing them until the glory
[1:10:01] Falls I say sing them until the Holy
[1:10:03] Ghost comes in the church and somebody
[1:10:06] gets a revelation my God is a way maker
[1:10:09] my God is a miracle worker my God is
[1:10:11] going to bring the victory I'm going to
[1:10:13] see the
[1:10:15] victory are you saying brother Andre we
[1:10:18] shouldn't sing old songs no we ought to
[1:10:19] sing them and new songs but let me just
[1:10:21] say this oh I'm here I might as well
[1:10:23] preach amen and when something don't
[1:10:25] goes our way amen let's just go ahead
[1:10:27] and be mature sons
[1:10:31] and can I give you a little secret it
[1:10:34] ain't about
[1:10:38] you brother Bill can I give you a little
[1:10:40] secret it ain't about me then who's it
[1:10:44] about it's about
[1:10:45] him it's about him coming in the church
[1:10:49] I was talking to some people one time
[1:10:50] and they got they got talk about some
[1:10:52] songs that they sung and I said you know
[1:10:54] I really don't like that song they said
[1:10:57] really I said no I I really don't care
[1:10:58] for it they said well we would have
[1:11:00] never know that had you not said
[1:11:01] something about it I said exactly right
[1:11:04] because I'm not a
[1:11:05] baby so when you sing it and I don't
[1:11:08] like it I don't hold a spiritual protest
[1:11:10] and put a kink in the atmosphere and
[1:11:12] block the holy ghost from moving I've
[1:11:14] grown up enough to know that we're going
[1:11:16] to get through this song and we're going
[1:11:17] to sing another
[1:11:19] song well it's Sunday night we might as
[1:11:21] well preach amen we're going to get
[1:11:23] through this one and we're going to sing
[1:11:24] another now let me just say this amen
[1:11:26] what difference does it make amen you
[1:11:28] might like How Great Thou Art and I
[1:11:30] might like I would not be tonight you
[1:11:32] might like old Rock of Ages and I might
[1:11:34] like our god is awesome but what
[1:11:36] difference does it make amen the reason
[1:11:38] we're singing those songs it's not to
[1:11:40] bring a music anointing in the building
[1:11:42] we're singing those songs to bring the
[1:11:44] holy ghost in the building so if he
[1:11:46] comes on how great thou art or he comes
[1:11:48] on I would not be denied or he comes on
[1:11:51] Rock of Ages when he shows up let's
[1:11:53] let's just be thankful that he's come in
[1:11:55] the midst of the church once again to
[1:11:57] manifest himself in the power of His
[1:11:59] Dynamic Resurrection Hallelujah just let
[1:12:02] it all go and get back to heav church
[1:12:07] again oh glory to
[1:12:09] God we got to open the atmosphere
[1:12:12] up God sends and Gifts Behind These pull
[1:12:15] pits we got to open the atmosphere up
[1:12:17] for well I had a bad day so did the
[1:12:19] preacher but the preacher didn't lay
[1:12:21] down and stay home he come on and preach
[1:12:25] now I know I'm getting a little
[1:12:27] Evangelistic but is that okay let's get
[1:12:29] back to having church or brother Ander I
[1:12:31] remember when we used to have a bunch of
[1:12:33] people man holy ghost would come in the
[1:12:35] when in the name of the Lord did it
[1:12:36] start mattering about how many people
[1:12:37] was
[1:12:38] here my Bible says we're two or three
[1:12:41] and some take that L we're two or three
[1:12:43] amen was gathered in my name there I'll
[1:12:46] be in their midst if we got two or
[1:12:49] three what difference does it make if he
[1:12:52] comes in the service
[1:12:55] Oh Glory to God you said brother why do
[1:12:56] you want him because on Earth he had the
[1:12:58] spirit without measure in him dwelleth
[1:13:00] all the fullness of the godhead Bley
[1:13:02] brother said Jesus Christ was the
[1:13:05] greatest gift that God ever had don't
[1:13:07] you believe that when he was here on the
[1:13:09] earth he said now watch he had the
[1:13:10] spirit without measure all the fullness
[1:13:13] of the godhead bodily dwelt in Christ
[1:13:15] now he was like the whole oceans all the
[1:13:17] Seas all the water which is about four
[1:13:20] fists of the Earth is covered with water
[1:13:22] and all that water was in
[1:13:24] him that's comparison with a blessing
[1:13:28] and the measure of the spirit of God
[1:13:29] gave him now in his servants and
[1:13:32] ministers and we are you hearing me in
[1:13:35] his servants in his ministers and we is
[1:13:38] just a spoonful of water in comparison
[1:13:41] of an ocean or the sea oh God but the
[1:13:44] same chemicals brother Shmi that's in
[1:13:46] the whole ocean is in the Spoonful too
[1:13:50] see so it's got to produce the same
[1:13:52] thing if it comes from the same place
[1:13:55] listen friends if you go to the Sea and
[1:13:57] there's salt in the sea and you get a
[1:13:59] cup of water there's salt in that water
[1:14:01] if you go to the Sea and you get a cup
[1:14:03] of water and there's minerals in that
[1:14:05] water in the sea there's minerals in
[1:14:07] that c are you hearing me and the
[1:14:09] prophet of God is saying amen then
[1:14:11] whatever is in him is in the church in
[1:14:14] measure but it's the same thing amen and
[1:14:17] sometimes amen God is going to use his
[1:14:20] gifts sometimes amen God is going to put
[1:14:22] a man in the pull head and he's going to
[1:14:24] let the atmosphere get so tight and
[1:14:26] people get so bored and look at the
[1:14:28] walls and ignore him and he's going to
[1:14:29] drop on that man and use that man amen
[1:14:32] to blow Devils out of the building by
[1:14:34] the things he's preaching he's going to
[1:14:35] use that man to bring correction he's
[1:14:37] going to use that man to bring a
[1:14:39] direction amen and sometimes that man is
[1:14:41] going to get up in the pull pit and he's
[1:14:43] going to feel like he don't have nothing
[1:14:44] to say he don't have nothing to preach
[1:14:46] but he's going to get up there by faith
[1:14:48] and begin to preach the word and in a
[1:14:50] few minutes an anointing is going to
[1:14:52] drop on him and things are going to
[1:14:53] begin to happen you know what that is
[1:14:55] that's the people using God's gift but
[1:14:58] either way it comes let's just get the
[1:15:00] full value out of the gift that God
[1:15:03] sends by exerting some force on
[1:15:06] it now the Bible says in Mark 5 there
[1:15:08] was a woman with the issue of blood and
[1:15:10] you know what the prophet of God said he
[1:15:12] said maybe she slipped under the man's
[1:15:14] arm and he pushed her back she come
[1:15:16] around the other side and slipped in the
[1:15:17] other side went between that one's knees
[1:15:19] and on down there she got over to a
[1:15:20] place till she touched him and she
[1:15:22] walked back away and walked out in the
[1:15:24] audience and Jesus stopped and said who
[1:15:26] touched me and she and the rest of them
[1:15:28] said not me they all denied it but he
[1:15:30] said I perceive amen I've gotten weak
[1:15:33] see if that translation isn't right
[1:15:35] virtue strength has gone from me see
[1:15:38] what did she do he looked around until
[1:15:40] his power of discernment caught the
[1:15:42] woman who she was and he said thy faith
[1:15:45] has made thee whole and then she came
[1:15:47] and fell down at his feet and confessed
[1:15:49] it all now thy faith is healed thee or
[1:15:52] save thee rather thy faith has saved
[1:15:54] thee now watch he said she used God's
[1:15:57] Gift amen that's what made him weak
[1:15:59] y'all heard people say we're going to
[1:16:01] send the preacher home War out tonight
[1:16:03] amen do you know what does that amen
[1:16:05] that's when you begin to exert some
[1:16:07] force and you begin to pull I remember
[1:16:09] somebody told me one time they saider if
[1:16:11] I really pulled like I felt I'd have to
[1:16:13] bring a change of shirt I said well come
[1:16:15] on and join the club I
[1:16:18] do are you hearing me come on but
[1:16:20] whatever we do let's just take the
[1:16:22] restrictions off of the atmosphere so we
[1:16:25] can get the full benefit of what God has
[1:16:27] enabled somebody to preach now in John
[1:16:30] chap 11 the Bible speaks of the
[1:16:31] resurrection of Lazarus and he said did
[1:16:33] you notice when he stood there he said I
[1:16:35] thank thee father thou has already heard
[1:16:37] me our friend Lazarus is asleep they
[1:16:40] said oh he rest us said he's dead but
[1:16:42] for your sakes I'm glad I wasn't here
[1:16:44] cuz it might upset your faith if you
[1:16:46] want me to go pray for him amen beg me
[1:16:48] to do it and I wouldn't have done it but
[1:16:50] that might lose Faith this way I'm glad
[1:16:51] I wasn't there but I go wake him see Oh
[1:16:55] Glory I'm going to preach it devil amen
[1:16:57] I go wake him said now watch he said
[1:17:00] when he went to wake him he said now
[1:17:02] watch he knew it see I do nothing till
[1:17:04] the father shows me but notice when he
[1:17:07] stood there how much greater was the
[1:17:09] miracle of the resurrection of Lazarus
[1:17:10] than the woman touching His Garment but
[1:17:13] there was nothing said about him getting
[1:17:14] weak amen she had a issue of blood and
[1:17:17] he pull and she pulled and she got her
[1:17:19] healing and strength left his body he
[1:17:22] goes to the Lazarus grave and raised
[1:17:24] Lazarus and he didn't get weak he said
[1:17:26] God had used his gift in Christ amen the
[1:17:29] for showing the resurrection of Lazarus
[1:17:32] and the woman used God's gift to get
[1:17:34] what she wanted listen friends amen when
[1:17:37] God uses his gift it's to do something
[1:17:39] for a foreshadow of what his word said
[1:17:42] he would do but when you use that gift
[1:17:44] it's to get something that you want it's
[1:17:46] to get something that you need and the
[1:17:48] brother says so in this new thing the
[1:17:50] Lord told me about it'll be God using
[1:17:52] his gift and when you're standing here
[1:17:54] in the public before people it's just a
[1:17:56] constant draw it's just a miracle of God
[1:17:59] if him the Virgin born son of God one
[1:18:01] time was such a strain till it pulled
[1:18:03] him down he got so weak what about me a
[1:18:05] corruptible sinner look at times it's
[1:18:07] happened see but it's God using his gift
[1:18:10] or you using his gift it isn't me that
[1:18:13] stands here it's you that stands here
[1:18:15] and does
[1:18:16] it it's you out in the audience and you
[1:18:19] here on the platform you are drawing
[1:18:22] from God's gift what does that word pull
[1:18:24] mean brother will it means to exert some
[1:18:26] force on and means to draw towards
[1:18:29] oneself it's drawing on the gift of God
[1:18:32] he said I'm not his gift the spirit is
[1:18:34] his gift this is not my voice it just
[1:18:37] picks up my voice it's a dumb mute until
[1:18:40] something behind it speaks and so I
[1:18:43] would be a dumb mute to anything
[1:18:45] Supernatural unless the Supernatural is
[1:18:47] using the instrument to speak through
[1:18:50] glory to God friends do you see oh God I
[1:18:54] know it may become common to you but
[1:18:55] when you see Shawn Martin walk up them
[1:18:57] steps and stand behind this pull pit
[1:19:00] that's not just your pastor that's not
[1:19:02] just a preacher Amen brother SE don't
[1:19:04] get mad at me okay amen that's a dumb
[1:19:06] mute behind the pull pits I'm a dumb
[1:19:08] mute behind the pull pit every preacher
[1:19:10] is a dumb mute behind the pull pit until
[1:19:12] the supernatural amen comes in the
[1:19:14] building and somebody recognizes it and
[1:19:17] the man of God yields himself Amen to
[1:19:19] the gift of God and then Supernatural
[1:19:22] answers and Supernatural Miracles and
[1:19:24] Supernatural deliverances take place
[1:19:26] church of living God when you see the
[1:19:28] man of God take the pull pit you ought
[1:19:30] to say speak Holy Ghost you ought to say

[1:19:35] Ghost come on I'm preaching to you now
[1:19:38] are you hearing me are you hearing me

[1:19:48] amen God take a dumb youut from the
[1:19:50] hills of East Tennessee over to the
[1:19:52] country India and stand in a pull pit

[1:20:01] sudden sister Jane something come over

[1:21:10] dumb mute but the Holy Ghost found the
[1:21:12] lightway he found the Liberty in the
[1:21:14] church and he was able to answer the
[1:21:16] situation let me say the same holy ghost

[1:21:25] Sunday night it's time to break out of
[1:21:28] the ritualistic formalistic devilish
[1:21:30] ideas and come back to the power of
[1:21:32] pulling on the gift of God until the

[1:24:10] gift of
[1:24:11] God in Mark chapter 10 there was a man
[1:24:14] named blind
[1:24:16] bardus he sat by the highways side
[1:24:18] begging so what that tell me brother
[1:24:20] will he was a beggar David says in
[1:24:23] Psalms 34 this poor man Cried unto the
[1:24:27] Lord and he heard him and delivered him
[1:24:32] and saved him brother Joe out of all his
[1:24:35] troubles my Bible says when he heard
[1:24:37] that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began
[1:24:39] to cry out and say Jesus thou son of
[1:24:42] David have mercy on me and many charged
[1:24:46] him that he should hold his peace but he
[1:24:49] cried the more a great deal they said
[1:24:51] listen thank things have gone too far
[1:24:53] the Situation's too bad it's too
[1:24:56] hopeless barus just be quiet in
[1:24:59] church just sit there as a beggar but
[1:25:02] listen he cried the more a great deal
[1:25:04] and Jesus Stood Still and commanded him
[1:25:07] to be called and they called the blind
[1:25:09] man said to him be of good Comfort rise
[1:25:11] he cth thee and he casted away His
[1:25:13] Garment he rose and came to Jesus and
[1:25:16] Jesus answered and said unto him what
[1:25:17] will thou should do unto thee and the
[1:25:19] blind man said unto him Lord that I
[1:25:20] might receive my sight and Jesus said
[1:25:23] unto him go thy way thy faith hath made
[1:25:26] thee whole and
[1:25:29] immediately immediately he received his
[1:25:32] sight amen and followed Jesus in the way
[1:25:35] in other words brother Shmi amen for
[1:25:37] years he had been a beggar in other
[1:25:40] words amen he didn't have enough money
[1:25:42] just enough to barely get by and brother
[1:25:44] B said he was sitting there thinking on
[1:25:45] some things and brother when you begin
[1:25:47] to think on the things that are true and
[1:25:49] are honest a good report amen if there
[1:25:51] be any praise Wonder said wonder if I
[1:25:53] call a prayer line wonder if God will
[1:25:54] speak don't think that kind of negative
[1:25:56] thought don't let that fault go through
[1:25:58] your mind make every word positive and
[1:26:01] every thought positive see you oh God
[1:26:04] you know the disciples after the
[1:26:06] resurrection of Jesus copius and his
[1:26:08] friend was on his road down to EMAs and
[1:26:10] as he went around his friend was was
[1:26:11] talking about Jesus thinking about Jesus
[1:26:13] now watch he stepped right out in the
[1:26:15] bushes and walked with him and while
[1:26:18] they were thinking they were meditating
[1:26:20] are you ready for this he said that's
[1:26:22] the same way Jesus does today the same
[1:26:25] way that copius and his friend met him
[1:26:28] on the road to emus is the same way
[1:26:30] brother shiah he's right here in Faith
[1:26:33] Tabernacle in my heart on my mind all
[1:26:35] day long let me walk with the Lord in
[1:26:37] the light of his word with a Heavenly
[1:26:38] Dove let me have Fellowship all day long
[1:26:41] now what can I can I give you a little
[1:26:43] bit of History here from the prophet
[1:26:45] said barus promised God his two turtle
[1:26:47] doves for the healing of his daughter he
[1:26:49] promised God his lamb for the healing of
[1:26:51] his wife why while he was sitting there
[1:26:53] he remembered his mother telling the
[1:26:55] story of Israel leaving Egypt under the
[1:26:57] power of Jehovah but he remembered the
[1:27:00] priest at the temple amen taught that
[1:27:02] Jesus wasn't the same today as he was
[1:27:04] then every time that they would lead him
[1:27:07] to the temple for service here's what he
[1:27:09] heard Jehovah don't perform Miracles
[1:27:12] anymore now do you realize people can
[1:27:14] lie on somebody so long until you lose
[1:27:17] any confidence in him because of a
[1:27:19] stinking dirty rotten lie are you
[1:27:21] hearing me amen and nine oh God come on
[1:27:23] and nine times out of 10 people don't
[1:27:25] even ask about it they just take the LIE
[1:27:26] and move on with it amen and if barus
[1:27:29] would have receive that lie he would
[1:27:30] have sat there and Jesus would have
[1:27:32] walked right in the country and he not
[1:27:34] receive his healing because he believed
[1:27:36] the LIE of some backsliding FY and said
[1:27:39] Jesus don't perform Miracles anymore oh
[1:27:41] but one day when barus heard some noise
[1:27:44] he asked what was causing the noise and
[1:27:46] they said Jesus of Nazareth amen listen
[1:27:49] brother said all of a sudden something
[1:27:50] struck him amen that if that's Jesus
[1:27:53] that means Jehovah of the old is the
[1:27:55] Jesus of the new he said all of a sudden
[1:27:57] he heard a lot of noise and he said
[1:27:59] whenever Jehovah comes around there's a
[1:28:01] lot of noise amen can I can I preach a
[1:28:03] second brother SM brother B said they
[1:28:05] actually formed a committee Amen to stop
[1:28:07] the noise and called it
[1:28:10] nonsense said they stopped they said
[1:28:12] we're going to form a committee and
[1:28:14] we're going to stop this noise it's a
[1:28:15] bunch of nonsense but bmus asked him can
[1:28:18] someone tell me amen who this is passing
[1:28:21] by there's too much noise in the house
[1:28:23] of God on a Sunday night for this just
[1:28:25] to be another service on Super Bowl
[1:28:28] Sunday amen there's somebody in the
[1:28:30] building or somebody in the atmosphere
[1:28:32] or something moving or something
[1:28:34] happening beyond the Realms of theology
[1:28:37] beyond the ideas of religion or somebody
[1:28:39] in the building or somebody troubling
[1:28:41] the waters or somebody walking in the
[1:28:44] power of the Resurrection they looked at
[1:28:45] barus they said bmus I know you can't
[1:28:48] see him but it's that Jesus of Nazareth
[1:28:50] oh I love heram says brother Bill he
[1:28:52] said all of a sudden reality set in on
[1:28:54] him woo glory to God he said reality set
[1:28:58] in on him and he said these words he's
[1:29:01] passing
[1:29:02] by oh I love this you know what brother
[1:29:05] Bram said he said begin to think a new
[1:29:08] thought you know what that new thought
[1:29:11] was if he could feel the
[1:29:13] touch I'm giving you prophet's words on
[1:29:16] the hymn of His Garment he can surely
[1:29:20] Hear My Cry

[1:29:27] feel the touch with aund thousand
[1:29:30] touching him brother will if he can feel
[1:29:32] the touch if he can feel the touch and
[1:29:35] the woman walk away and go try to hide
[1:29:38] and he say listen I know virtues left my
[1:29:40] body if he could feel that touch brother
[1:29:42] Joey can hear your cry I don't care if
[1:29:44] it's in the midnight I don't care if
[1:29:46] it's in the we hours of the morning I
[1:29:47] don't care if it's in a service where it
[1:29:49] is if you begin to cry out to God he'll
[1:29:52] come on the scene and change the
[1:29:54] situation listen friends the pull of a
[1:29:56] blind Beggar's Faith stopped Jesus in
[1:29:59] his
[1:30:02] tracks if that blind Beggar's face
[1:30:04] stopped him on the road to
[1:30:07] Calvary y'all hearing me brother Daniel
[1:30:11] there was actually a war going on but
[1:30:14] how did I say this nicely there was a
[1:30:15] struggle going on between prophetic word
[1:30:18] and a blind Beggar's Faith the prophetic
[1:30:21] word is he's got to go to Calvary and
[1:30:23] he's walking on his way to Calvary and
[1:30:25] the pool of Calvary is on him the pool
[1:30:27] of redemption's on him the pool of
[1:30:29] salvation's on him the weight of the
[1:30:31] Cross is on him the weight of redemption
[1:30:33] is on him brother Matthew amen but yet
[1:30:35] there was a blind bar there was a blind
[1:30:37] bardus there and he had a need and so
[1:30:40] God was able to stop and say blind bmus
[1:30:43] you're healed are y'all hearing me
[1:30:45] listen you say preacher what are you
[1:30:46] trying to say I'm trying to say that
[1:30:48] just as much as it was a part of God's
[1:30:50] will for Jesus to go to Calvary and to
[1:30:53] manifest the atonement of the blood of
[1:30:55] Jesus Christ it was his will to heal
[1:30:57] barus because thousands of years later
[1:31:00] there was going to be some people
[1:31:01] sitting in the service on the 11th day
[1:31:04] of the second month of the 24th year of
[1:31:07] 2000 and they were going to have a need
[1:31:09] in their life and they was going to
[1:31:10] wonder is God too busy is God too
[1:31:12] occupied has he got too much going on to
[1:31:15] help me but they're going to break
[1:31:16] beyond all the negative thoughts they're
[1:31:18] going to break beyond all the negative
[1:31:20] doubts and brother Daniel they're going
[1:31:21] to get a hold of this reality he's
[1:31:23] passing by he's passing by he's in the
[1:31:26] church he's in the building I've got a
[1:31:29] need if I can just get a hold of him if
[1:31:31] I can just stop him in his tracks my
[1:31:33] baby will be saved my body will be
[1:31:35] healed my joy will be restored my vision
[1:31:38] will be restored oh church of living God
[1:31:41] break beyond the barrier of negativity
[1:31:43] tonight and break out in that realm with
[1:31:45] God where you can believe again and pull
[1:31:48] on
[1:31:50] God
[1:31:53] are you hearing
[1:31:54] me there's something it's getting a
[1:31:57] little cool up here there's something
[1:31:59] happening beyond what you can
[1:32:02] see now here's your options and I'm done
[1:32:06] you can either give up bow your knee and
[1:32:09] accept the situation or you can rise and
[1:32:12] say I'll believe
[1:32:16] God in the face of whatever is

[1:32:27] time he's in this building
[1:32:30] tonight and you said brother Andrew why
[1:32:32] did you spend so much time breaking out
[1:32:34] the
[1:32:38] atmosphere why did you spend so much
[1:32:40] time because Daniel is this okay if I
[1:32:42] share a little something here I I sat
[1:32:44] the other night and heard brother
[1:32:46] Daniel's sermon here in the pull pit and
[1:32:48] I text him I said I don't know maybe you
[1:32:51] didn't feel it but there was a vein in
[1:32:52] the building when you got on you're
[1:32:53] going to see a victory am I I literally
[1:32:56] felt it in the hotel room when he began

[1:33:12] you're going to see the victory you got
[1:33:13] to look beyond what you're seeing right

[1:42:25] the recording of it for you when he told
[1:42:27] it they say as I'm walking down there he
[1:42:29] said Devil's just bombarding my mind
[1:42:31] you're wasting your time you're going to
[1:42:32] fail you ain't got nothing to say you're
[1:42:34] a failure he said I walked in the pull

[1:42:57] somebody met me and they said I don't
[1:42:59] know if this will mean anything to you
[1:43:00] or not he said but while you were
[1:43:02] preaching tonight he said when the
[1:43:03] anointing come in the atmosphere he said
[1:43:05] I was looking at you he said but while
[1:43:07] you were in the pull pit he said I
[1:43:09] literally seen a physical Angel standing
[1:43:11] there amen holding you in the pull pit
[1:43:14] while you were preaching the word while
[1:43:15] you were just standing there preaching
[1:43:17] the word there was an angel holding you
[1:43:19] and he said that's oh brother Danny said
[1:43:21] that thing broke right then and there he
[1:43:23] said it was over he said when I couldn't
[1:43:25] even hold myself amen God would allow
[1:43:28] somebody to see that there was an angel
[1:43:30] hold me amen I remember when he told
[1:43:32] that up at Brother Ray Ericson's Church
[1:43:33] a few years ago and there was a man
[1:43:35] sitting there amen that had lost all the
[1:43:37] ability to believe for his healing he
[1:43:39] said but while he began to tell that
[1:43:41] testimony he said Faith returned to
[1:43:43] believe God was a Healer church we got
[1:43:45] to start talking about the supernatural
[1:43:47] again I know there's been a lot of
[1:43:49] fanaticism I know there's been a lot of
[1:43:50] this that and the other questions and
[1:43:52] this happened that happened amen but if
[1:43:54] we put all the supernatural out we're
[1:43:56] going to become a bunch of cold carnal
[1:43:58] amen folks that there's nothing
[1:43:59] Supernatural happening listen I refuse
[1:44:01] to open up the door and put the
[1:44:03] Supernatural on the outside because of
[1:44:05] carnal impersonations and carnal
[1:44:07] comparisons we've got a message that we
[1:44:09] check the supernatural by and if it is
[1:44:11] of god we embrace it and we follow it
[1:44:14] and if it's of the devil we reject it
[1:44:16] and move on for the glory of
