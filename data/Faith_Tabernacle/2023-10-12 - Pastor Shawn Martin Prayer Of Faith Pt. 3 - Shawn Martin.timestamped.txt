[28:41] lucky but blessed they were that that
[28:44] gas didn't explode and um um didn't go

[28:54] went the opposite direction so the Lord
[28:57] was good good to them and we don't

[31:20] resurrected Christ and he's living in US
[31:24] amen before we go into the word let's
[31:26] just our heads and talk to our Lord
[31:30] father truly we're thankful for your
[31:34] blessings blessings upon our life Lord
[31:37] your grace and your mercy that you've
[31:39] bestowed upon us
[31:41] Lord Lord we're So Unworthy and so many
[31:46] times Satan brings up our faults our
[31:48] failures and but Lord all we can say
[31:51] it's by
[31:52] Grace we are what we are by grace and
[31:57] father we're so thankful for it and Lord
[32:00] we're just now asking that if you would
[32:03] take the time Lord to save us by grace
[32:06] and bring us into the message of this
[32:09] hour it gives us a boldness to ask that
[32:12] you would come among us
[32:14] tonight that you would just speak to our
[32:17] hearts Lord and that you would meet
[32:19] every need that is present pray Lord
[32:22] that you would forgive us of all of our
[32:24] sins our failures our compl complains
[32:27] and gripes Lord and help us to always
[32:31] have a Heart of Thanksgiving am trust in
[32:34] you to have the confidence Lord we thank
[32:38] you for all that you do for us and for
[32:40] answering our prayer tonight in Jesus
[32:43] Christ's name and the church says amen
[32:47] amen and amen the Book of James the
[32:51] fifth
[32:52] chapter and we're just going to start at
[32:55] the 14th verse again but it says as any
[32:58] sick among you let him call for the
[33:01] Elders of the church and let them pray
[33:04] over him anointing him with all in the
[33:07] name of the Lord and the prayer faith
[33:10] shall save the sick and the Lord shall
[33:13] raise him up and if he have committed
[33:17] sins they shall be forgiven him amen you
[33:21] can have your
[33:25] seats so I'm going to to continue with
[33:28] this prayer of faith
[33:30] and we read about how powerful the
[33:33] prayer of faith is prayer is important
[33:37] and it's it's a powerful thing it is a
[33:40] weapon that God has placed in every one
[33:42] of our hands and there's one thing about
[33:46] it uh uh uh God will never take your
[33:51] weapon away from you no matter how INS
[33:56] INS significant you feel no matter your
[34:00] back against the wall you must always
[34:02] remember you do have a weapon and that
[34:05] is prayer no matter how how odds how the
[34:09] odds are stacked against
[34:11] you um and how helpless you feel and how
[34:15] impossible the situation that you're in
[34:18] you do have a weapon and that's prayer
[34:21] and prayer changes things and so we we
[34:25] find that uh uh uh Proverbs 15 and8 says
[34:29] the sacrifice of the wicked is an
[34:32] Abomination to the Lord but the prayer
[34:34] of the upright is his
[34:37] Delight the 29th verse the Lord is far
[34:40] from the wicked but he heareth the
[34:42] prayer of the righteous so prayer is
[34:46] essential to the believer it is the way
[34:48] we communicate to God it is how we make
[34:51] our petition known to God uh but our our
[34:55] prayer must be a prayer of faith and as
[34:59] as we read there it shall save the sick
[35:02] and and if he have committed any sins it
[35:05] shall be forgiven him but the key is the
[35:08] prayer of faith and brother brandom said
[35:11] the prayer of faith brings God's
[35:13] blessings down and so if it does bring
[35:17] the God's blessings down then he said we
[35:19] we must continue to pray NE never let
[35:23] prayer leave leave you uh let it the
[35:27] most important thing because as brother
[35:29] brandom said you can do too many things
[35:31] too too much uh but you can never pray
[35:34] too much and so by praying the the
[35:38] prayer of faith it's it's then we
[35:41] fulfill what Paul says there in Hebrews
[35:45] 4:15 where he said let us come uh let us
[35:48] therefore come boldly unto the throne of
[35:51] grace that we might um uh obtain mercy
[35:55] and find Grace to help in the time of
[35:58] need and so when we pray the the prayer
[36:02] of faith then it shows that we are
[36:05] coming boldly Before the Throne of Grace
[36:08] We're we're coming in confidence it's
[36:11] one thing to to come before the throne
[36:13] of grace but Paul would tell us how to
[36:15] approach it and that is to come boldly
[36:18] don't come timidly don't don't come
[36:20] doubting don't don't come in any other
[36:22] way but come boldly come confident and
[36:26] and that is uh praying the prayer of
[36:29] faith and so but if you look uh just
[36:32] prior to to telling us to come boldly
[36:36] Paul gives us the explanation as to why
[36:40] we are to come boldly and and he says we
[36:44] have a great high priest that is passed
[36:48] unto the heavens that can be touched
[36:51] with the feelings of our infirmities
[36:54] that's that's that's what Paul is saying
[36:57] amen he's not a high priest that that
[36:59] cannot be touched with with the feeling
[37:02] of our infirmities and and so and then
[37:05] uh there in Hebrews 7 and
[37:08] 24 uh uh he says this man and he's
[37:11] talking about our high priest Jesus
[37:13] Christ this man because he continues
[37:17] forever hath an unchangeable
[37:21] priesthood he says wherefore he is able
[37:25] also to say gave them to the uttermost
[37:29] that come unto God by him seeing he ever
[37:33] liveth to make intercessions for them
[37:37] aren't you glad for that amen see for
[37:40] such an high priest became us who is
[37:44] Holy harmless undefiled separate from
[37:48] Sinners and made higher than the heavens
[37:51] who needeth not daily as those High
[37:54] priests in the natural uh in the Old
[37:57] Testament them men uh uh you know to
[38:00] offer up sacrifice first for his own
[38:03] sins and then for the peoples but for
[38:06] this he did once he did it one time when
[38:11] he offered up himself ain't that right
[38:15] so so this this is uh uh uh the the
[38:20] basis that we could pray the prayer of
[38:22] faith and come boldly before the throne
[38:25] of grace is is because the the only way
[38:28] the high priest can make intercession
[38:31] and remember we do have an intercessor
[38:34] that is interceding for us do you
[38:36] believe that he's interceding he's
[38:38] making intercession and but the only way
[38:40] he could do that is there had to be a
[38:42] blood applied there had to be a
[38:44] sacrifice and and and and and and then
[38:48] uh uh uh our high priest and Paul is
[38:51] saying that when he's speaking of this
[38:53] high priest he's saying that this high
[38:56] priest has been accepted by God Amen and
[39:00] not only is he accepted he is our
[39:03] sacrifice the high priest is our
[39:05] sacrifice and he has been accepted by
[39:08] God ain't that right so therefore his
[39:11] his
[39:12] intercession amen is the only thing that
[39:15] can silence the voice of our accuser
[39:18] amen amen and then and that's the truth
[39:21] church amen your good works could not
[39:24] silence the voice of our Accuser
[39:26] amen your your education your talents of
[39:30] whatever we could do could not silence
[39:33] the voice of our accuser but because we
[39:36] have a high priest that become our
[39:39] sacrifice and and he shed his own blood
[39:43] and it's been accepted by God and now
[39:46] he's forever interceding amen to the
[39:50] father for us it actually has the power
[39:53] to silence the the voice of our accuser
[39:57] ain't that right so because of this then
[40:00] we can come boldly before the throne of
[40:03] grace and and and I want to say this
[40:06] that we must not come to God trying to
[40:08] be our our our own intercessor amen it's
[40:13] not that we come to God interceding for
[40:16] our own selves amen um you see the the
[40:20] intercessor it means petition or in
[40:23] treaty in favor of another amen uh uh so
[40:28] so prayer is not to be about us
[40:31] interceding for our own selves in hopes
[40:34] that God uh we get favor from God and
[40:38] God favors us and and therefore God
[40:41] answers you've already got favor with
[40:44] God Amen so your prayer should not be
[40:47] about trying to get God to favor you
[40:50] you've already got an intercessor up
[40:53] there that is interceding for you on
[40:56] your your behalf and because that there
[40:58] is a blood amen there is no way you
[41:00] could get favor from God on your own
[41:02] self but there is a blood that is there
[41:06] that is standing between you and him and
[41:08] any time that he sees you he sees the
[41:11] blood can you sayen because you're under
[41:14] the blood so therefore um uh if we're if
[41:18] we're making intercession for ourselves
[41:21] then it is to be honest it's impossible
[41:24] to pray the prayer of faith and amen
[41:26] because how good can you get who are you
[41:29] who are who am I amen uh uh uh to attain
[41:33] God's favor so we we because we have an
[41:37] intercessor and because we believe that
[41:40] that sacrifice is a perfect sacrifice
[41:43] how many believe that you you have to
[41:45] believe in your sacrifice now if God
[41:47] believes in the sacrifice that he
[41:49] provided for you then you have to
[41:51] believe in it in order to pray the
[41:54] prayer of faith right can you say Amen
[41:57] if we don't believe in it then how are
[41:59] you going to pray the prayer of faith
[42:00] how how can you have faith amen When you
[42:03] pray if you don't believe then you're in
[42:06] the sacrifice that God has provided for
[42:09] you because you'll never get good enough
[42:11] you can you can go to church every day
[42:12] of your life and set even under the
[42:14] message of the hour uh all for a
[42:17] thousand years and you'll still never be
[42:19] good enough you you know this Bible
[42:20] backward and forward you can know the
[42:22] message backward and forward and you'll
[42:24] still never be good enough Amen to to to
[42:28] uh uh appease God but he provided the
[42:32] sacrifice amen already for you amen see
[42:36] so therefore if God didn't make us a a
[42:40] high priest then we mustn't dare try to
[42:44] to make an intercession so to gain God's
[42:48] acceptance ain't that right God supplied
[42:52] the intercessor for you and I he's
[42:55] already Prov provided that and because
[42:58] the intercessor because the sacrifice
[43:01] has been accepted we have already been
[43:04] accepted do you believe that amen we
[43:07] have been accepted it's based upon
[43:09] whether he was accepted it's based upon
[43:12] whether the sacrifice was accepted it's
[43:15] based upon whether the blood was
[43:17] powerful enough to take your sins away
[43:20] and and and and you have to believe that
[43:22] it is you have to believe that the blood
[43:25] has totally Justified you to where you
[43:27] never done it in the first place then
[43:30] you can you can say the prayer of faith
[43:32] can you say Amen it's the only way that
[43:35] we can come boldly before the throne of
[43:36] grace amen Romans 8:31 Paul would tell
[43:40] us what shall we say then to these
[43:43] things if God be for us who can be
[43:45] against us now you just think of that if
[43:47] God was for you amen he already show his
[43:50] for you he provided a sacrifice he
[43:53] provided a perfect blood and not only
[43:55] that then he becomes the the the the
[43:57] intercessor so he became man so he could
[44:00] die for you he became a blood amen a
[44:04] substance of blood to where he could
[44:06] shed it on the ground for you amen and
[44:09] pay the penalty for you amen and then he
[44:12] becomes the intercessor amen and he's
[44:15] interceding for you how can man or
[44:19] anything uh if God before us who can be
[44:22] against us can you say amen amen see he
[44:25] spared not his own son but delivered him
[44:28] up for us all how shall he not with him
[44:31] also freely give us all things can you
[44:34] say Amen so then our prayer shouldn't be
[44:36] a prayer begging if if he if he
[44:39] delivered and raised his son up amen for
[44:43] us all Amen to where you can stand
[44:46] justified in his sight you can stand
[44:48] holy in his sight you can stand free in
[44:51] his sight amen you could be changed from
[44:53] a sinner to a saint in his in his sight
[44:56] amen then how much with him that
[44:58] sacrifice that intercessor amen freely
[45:01] give us all things can you say amen amen
[45:05] see so oh to think of that when if we
[45:07] could ever just really get that into our
[45:09] soul to where it becomes a revelation
[45:12] how much our prayer will change how much
[45:14] our relationship with Christ will change
[45:17] and our fellowship can you say amen amen
[45:20] see he says now who shall lay anything
[45:22] to the charge of God's elect it is God
[45:25] that justif us amen well how can God
[45:28] justify he provided the perfect
[45:31] sacrifice can you say Amen who is he
[45:34] that condemneth it is Christ that died
[45:36] yay rather that is risen again so we're
[45:39] not just focusing upon his death but the
[45:41] same God Amen that died has risen again
[45:45] our sacrifices alive and well Amen to
[45:49] show amen that he paid the price and he
[45:52] is now our intercessor who is even at
[45:56] the right hand of God who also maketh
[45:58] intercession for us aren't you glad for
[46:00] that 1 John 2 And1 my little children
[46:04] these things I write unto you that you
[46:06] sin not amen and if any man sin we
[46:10] everybody say we we have an advocate
[46:13] amen with the father Jesus Christ the
[46:16] righteous ain't that right amen now
[46:18] notice amen so it's not a license to sin
[46:22] amen as we know that but we're all human
[46:24] the Holy Ghost does not take your
[46:26] Humanity it it doesn't take away them
[46:29] things to where you're just Superman and
[46:31] and and now you just you know uh uh it
[46:34] doesn't do that look look what brother
[46:35] Brown said sometimes when we got the
[46:37] Holy Ghost we ignorantly stagger into
[46:40] something the holy spirit's there to
[46:43] make advocate for us he's our advocator
[46:47] aren't you glad for that amen God knew
[46:49] who you were God knew all about you but
[46:51] he's ordained you for another life than
[46:54] a sinful life amen but yet he knew that
[46:56] there's a human nature There's a sticky
[46:58] nature you'll always have that sticky
[47:01] nature as long as you live can you say
[47:03] amen that's right but thank God he
[47:06] already had a way provided and now he
[47:10] sent an advocator amen see and he's
[47:13] there he's brother Brown said the holy
[47:15] spirit's there to make advocate for us
[47:18] he stands there he is our etern attorney
[47:22] so he not just our high priest he's not
[47:25] just our sacrifice he's not just
[47:27] whatever amen but now he is our attorney
[47:32] and he stands there and pleads for us
[47:35] amen we don't plead for ourselves
[47:37] because the Holy Ghost in US pleads for
[47:39] us the Holy Spirit giving utterance
[47:42] sometimes with words you can't
[47:44] understand and he makes intercessions
[47:45] for us that's what the Holy Ghost is he
[47:48] said see when I walk into anything I
[47:50] walk like a little kid you walk like a
[47:52] little you know a fellow and we're
[47:54] walking in a dark world full of enemies
[47:57] full of sins full of traps full of
[47:59] everything and you say oh I'm afraid to
[48:01] take the Christian Life I'm afraid to do
[48:03] this I'm afraid I'll do this don't be
[48:07] afraid can you say amen amen don't be
[48:10] afraid if there's fear there you cannot
[48:13] have faith you've got to take all that
[48:15] fear out and perfect love amen worketh
[48:19] Faith ain't that right Faith worketh by
[48:22] love amen see and so he says Don't Be
[48:25] Afraid
[48:26] we have an advocate amen see oh he
[48:30] stands by us he's in us and he makes
[48:33] intercessions for us the Holy Spirit
[48:36] constantly everybody say constantly he
[48:39] is constantly making an advocate for us
[48:43] all the time when you're asleep he's
[48:46] making Advocate amen when the devil's uh
[48:49] you know pounding your mind with bad
[48:51] dreams or whatever he's making an
[48:53] advocate amen when the spirit I I was
[48:56] thinking of uh someone's telling me the
[48:58] other night he said you know he say I I
[49:00] I couldn't sleep and he says uh he says
[49:02] you know my baby was was was in the room
[49:05] with us and and and he said I couldn't
[49:07] sleep but he he says during the night
[49:09] say something he said I he said I don't
[49:11] know what it was I can't tell you what
[49:13] it was he said I just saw something dark
[49:15] form come across that room he said an
[49:17] evil present come across that room and
[49:19] went to my baby and all of a sudden that
[49:20] baby starts screaming and and and crying
[49:24] and he says I don't know what that was I
[49:26] said I'll tell you what it was it was a
[49:28] spirit trying to work and get to you
[49:30] amen through that baby and you know but
[49:32] you don't have to fear that thing none
[49:34] of us has to fear that old stupid devil
[49:36] can you sayen but it's in them times
[49:39] we've got an advocate he's making
[49:41] intercession for us constantly you think
[49:44] you could whip the devil on your own
[49:45] there is no absolutely no way that we
[49:47] could whip the devil on our own there is
[49:49] absolutely no way that we could actually
[49:52] overcome that stupid devil on our own
[49:55] with our carnal flesh but there is an
[49:58] advocate amen and he's living inside of
[50:01] his children and his at intercession his
[50:05] his Advocate is far greater than what
[50:08] the devil can do so so because we have
[50:11] an advocate the prophet said we have
[50:13] mercy aren't you glad for Mercy amen
[50:16] because we have an advocate and so he
[50:18] our Advocate stands in our place amen
[50:22] see so then getting back to this prayer
[50:25] a fath see Faith then our faith stands
[50:28] in the finished work of Calvary it does
[50:31] not stand on what we do it's not on our
[50:34] ability it's not on our talents it does
[50:36] not stand it is based on the finished
[50:39] work of Calvary can you say amen amen
[50:42] see when Jesus hung on the cross he
[50:44] cried out it is finished amen what
[50:48] powerful words amen then just wasn't
[50:50] just something he just said amen and and
[50:53] then just gave up The Ghost and amen
[50:55] like he just well I can't breathe
[50:57] anymore it's finished you know amen it
[50:59] wasn't that he was saying it's finished
[51:01] sin is finished brother random said see
[51:03] we were saved then we were healed then
[51:06] we were delivered then when he said it
[51:09] is finished the power of Satan's was
[51:12] broken amen every tactic the devil amen
[51:16] could put up the church and put up
[51:18] Humanity it was broken amen that's right
[51:22] see Amen brother Brown said when he said
[51:24] it was finished all that God required
[51:28] had been fully paid at Calvary there was
[51:31] no other man that could say it is
[51:33] finished when he died and have an effect
[51:36] on them words but when Jesus died and
[51:39] said it is finished you were loose then
[51:42] even though you wasn't even born yet but
[51:45] every sin every habit every Temptation
[51:49] every evil thing amen was finished it
[51:52] was broken over your life
[51:55] can you say Amen brother BR said in the
[51:58] sight of God it's all over when Jesus
[52:01] said it is finished that's when to God
[52:04] it was over it's finished it's over can
[52:07] you say Amen so our life the Christian
[52:10] life isn't based upon trying and
[52:12] pleasing and and hoping and grasping
[52:15] it's finished you've got to have faith
[52:18] in the finished work of cowy ain't that
[52:21] right brother Brown say there's nothing
[52:23] not nothing can be uh said there can be
[52:26] nothing else added to it nothing else
[52:28] can be taken from it that settles it the
[52:32] Bible is finished the plan of God is
[52:34] finished the atonement is made the devil
[52:36] is defeated and the only thing we have
[52:39] to do is look and
[52:41] live why it is
[52:45] finished can you say Amen so what
[52:48] happened when Jesus died and was risen
[52:51] again he done it for you and I to redeem
[52:54] us amen and brother rown said he
[52:56] redeemed us to every promise he made so
[53:00] then we we see that healing is a promise
[53:02] of God ain't that right therefore Jesus
[53:06] Christ redeemed us to it salvation is a
[53:08] promise of God therefore Jesus Christ
[53:11] redeemed us to it Deliverance is a is a
[53:14] promise of God and Christ redeemed us to
[53:16] it amen uh Heaven it is a promise of God
[53:20] and Christ redeemed us to it that's why
[53:23] through all of the troubles and the
[53:24] tribulations that is coming upon this
[53:26] Earth we have a hope can you say Amen oh
[53:31] my don't let your faith don't let your
[53:33] prayer be defeated when you're seeing
[53:35] what's happening in the world and the
[53:37] chaos don't pray a defeated prayer when
[53:40] things ain't looking great amen you've
[53:42] been redeemed to every promise in this
[53:45] book been redeemed the Millennium is a
[53:48] promise of God the new Heaven and new
[53:51] earth is a promise of God and Christ
[53:54] Jesus redeemed you to it amen see and
[53:59] and now you know what the message of the
[54:01] hour is to us you know what that is you
[54:03] know what the message is it's a
[54:06] pardon remember brother BR talking about
[54:08] that you know where where the boy that
[54:11] that that he he he ran from war they
[54:14] caught him they going to kill him they
[54:16] tried him it's going to kill him and his
[54:19] friend went to the President Abraham
[54:21] Lincoln and and said please have mercy
[54:24] and so when when he heard the story and
[54:27] all that Abraham Lincoln was moved and
[54:29] but he was in a hurry so he just grabbed
[54:31] a piece of paper and he wrote you know
[54:33] pardon the boy sent he he now he become
[54:36] the messenger and he he he takes the
[54:39] message to the boy that's about to die
[54:41] and says looky here you got some hope
[54:43] you're going to live I got I got it
[54:45] right here at your pardon he's showing
[54:47] the message he's proclaiming a message
[54:49] amen it wasn't his message it was
[54:52] President's message it wasn't him pardon
[54:55] it was the United the president of the
[54:57] United States
[54:59] pardoning but the boy wouldn't believe
[55:01] it right amen so so we all know the
[55:04] story see so this message amen that God
[55:07] has sent to us in this age wasn't a
[55:09] prophet's message it came from God
[55:12] himself amen you're pardoned you're free
[55:16] can you say amen amen see and then what
[55:20] to show his pardoning grace to us God
[55:23] has come down in this age to show that
[55:26] he is the same yesterday today and
[55:29] forever amen not in a body that he was
[55:33] in in in in two 2,000 years ago that he
[55:37] come in a redeemed body to show that you
[55:40] are redeemed to show that you truly have
[55:44] been pardoned he comes down in a people
[55:48] amen and shows that he's the same amen
[55:52] he has done the same signs the same
[55:54] works that he did back when he walked
[55:56] the Earth and even brother Brown said
[55:58] he's had greater success in my Ministry
[56:00] than his own Amen to show that the
[56:02] pardon really worked Amen to show that
[56:05] Calvary really worked that God could
[56:08] take he didn't have to take a word born
[56:10] body Amen to become God again and to
[56:13] show himself through Humanity he could
[56:15] take a redeemed born body a sex born
[56:18] body and redeem that body amen through
[56:21] the calvary and to show that Calvary

[57:45] place and the blood had had its effect
[57:48] Calvary had an effect can you say amen
[57:52] amen see so uh brother abam said see
[57:55] notice God's life which is in the Greek
[57:58] called Zoey moving through them and in
[58:00] them quickening their minds to his word
[58:04] yep you see the spirit of God that moves
[58:06] among the people quickens the mind of
[58:09] the person to the promise of God Amen
[58:12] see that's what he's doing today that's
[58:13] why he's living inside of you amen not
[58:16] to condemn you not to drive you from the
[58:18] promises of God that is of the devil
[58:21] amen but if God is in you he comes to
[58:24] Quicken you to the promise of the word
[58:27] that was the whole point of him dying
[58:28] can you say amen amen see amen that's
[58:31] the only way we can pray a prayer of
[58:33] faith amen you can't pray a prayer of
[58:35] faith listening to the devil no sir you
[58:38] can't you can't pray the prayer of faith
[58:41] amen listen to all them mind battles and
[58:44] and in the dumps and hello Church the
[58:48] Holy Ghost comes not only to be your
[58:50] Advocate but to Quicken the word to you
[58:53] Quicken your mind to the
[58:56] word so God God if you look God is the
[59:00] one who made the Covenant in the first
[59:02] place Lord that's what the word is it's
[59:05] it's a
[59:06] covenant amen it's Bible the Old
[59:08] Testament and the New Testament it's
[59:10] covenants old Covenant New Covenant and
[59:12] God made an an an unconditional Covenant
[59:16] and and when he he he made that Covenant
[59:19] he made it with himself he swore by
[59:22] himself that he would he would bring
[59:24] that Covenant to pass do you believe
[59:27] that and and and so you could read about
[59:29] it where he showed it in Abraham when
[59:32] when he made that Covenant with Abraham
[59:34] he had Abraham to take the kill animals
[59:37] and then divide them animals in in and
[59:40] haves and and and and and you know the
[59:43] story of how they make covenants back
[59:46] then they would two men make that
[59:48] Covenant they'd write that Covenant out
[59:49] and they would stand between these dead
[59:51] animals and they would say well you know
[59:53] they one would make his pledge his
[59:55] Covenant and the other one make his side
[59:57] of the Covenant and then they say you
[59:59] know if we fail to keep the Covenant
[1:00:01] then may we be as these dead at these
[1:00:03] dead animals you know and then they
[1:00:05] would rip that Covenant and one would
[1:00:06] keep part of it and the other would keep
[1:00:08] part of it and they would set a date of
[1:00:10] of to come back amen and they would put
[1:00:12] that that Covenant together and and and
[1:00:14] read the Covenant and both of them would
[1:00:16] have had to have met that Covenant
[1:00:18] they're they're into the bargain but
[1:00:19] when God made the Covenant he put
[1:00:21] Abraham to sleep Abraham he put Abraham
[1:00:25] out of it didn't want Abraham showing
[1:00:27] Abraham this has nothing to do with you
[1:00:29] it has everything to do with me and the
[1:00:31] Bible says that that little light that
[1:00:33] flicker of light that Pillar of Fire
[1:00:35] moved not just on one part but it began
[1:00:37] to move all through them sacrifices
[1:00:39] showing that he would keep not only his
[1:00:41] end of the bargain he would keep our end
[1:00:43] of the bargain as well can you sayen
[1:00:46] amen see and so so we find that that one
[1:00:50] part of the Covenant that God had made
[1:00:52] was fulfilled in Christ Jesus amen he
[1:00:55] promised to redeem he promised to re
[1:00:57] restore he promised to bring us back he
[1:01:00] promised everything every promise is in
[1:01:04] him yay and amen there is nothing
[1:01:07] negative in Christ Jesus everything was
[1:01:10] fulfilled can you say Amen but now God
[1:01:13] is here on this Earth amen he's here
[1:01:17] fulfilling the other part of his
[1:01:19] covenant not through a a physical
[1:01:21] Corporal body of Jesus Christ but now
[1:01:24] it's Christ in you fulfilling that other
[1:01:27] part of the Covenant and as Jesus could
[1:01:31] not fail you can't fail Hallelujah I
[1:01:34] hope it brings your faith up as Christ
[1:01:36] could not fail you can't fail can you
[1:01:39] say Amen see we were as attributes as
[1:01:42] we've talked about here for a while we
[1:01:45] we were as attributes to begin with
[1:01:47] attributes of his thinking and never one
[1:01:50] time never one time we did it cross
[1:01:53] God's thoughts amen of us being
[1:01:55] powerless and defeated and helpless
[1:01:57] puppets to the devil that was never in
[1:02:01] his thoughts we were never Amen to be
[1:02:03] such a thing can you say amen amen but
[1:02:06] millions and millions and millions and
[1:02:08] billions of years if we could say it
[1:02:09] that way before the world was formed God
[1:02:13] thought of you to be his servant God
[1:02:16] thought of you to be his sons and
[1:02:18] daughters God thought of you to be a
[1:02:20] powerful Army amen God well you you hear
[1:02:24] the talking about a people being a super
[1:02:26] race a super Church well that was only
[1:02:29] God's thoughts amen of what he thought
[1:02:31] before you ever become into existence
[1:02:34] before the world was ever formed he was
[1:02:36] thinking of a super race of a super
[1:02:39] church can you say amen amen and he
[1:02:41] would create the worst enemy that could
[1:02:43] ever be amen and yet he would see that
[1:02:45] church triumphant over that enemy he
[1:02:48] would know that there would be a Dark
[1:02:50] Age an Eden of Satan and it would be the
[1:02:53] worst that it could ever possibly be and
[1:02:56] yet he's picture he thought of a bride
[1:02:59] rising up to be a super race a super
[1:03:02] Army in this age an invincible Army that
[1:03:06] the devil don't know what to do with it
[1:03:08] was in this age he never thought of you
[1:03:11] to be defeated he thought of his blood
[1:03:13] he thought of that intercessor he
[1:03:15] thought of everything that could raise
[1:03:18] us up and he promised and he saw him
[1:03:21] living inside of us defeating his own
[1:03:25] enemy can you say amen he thought of you
[1:03:29] to be a son and daughter and he spoke a
[1:03:32] word he spoke a word concerning you on
[1:03:34] now spoke a word hallelujah amen but as
[1:03:39] we said before you didn't come into this
[1:03:41] world like what he spoke you come into
[1:03:43] this world a different way can you say
[1:03:46] man because you're mortal Satan was
[1:03:49] already looked like Satan had the
[1:03:51] advantage but God actually had the
[1:03:52] advantage because he spoke his word
[1:03:55] before you ever become in sin before you
[1:03:57] ever become a mortal before you ever
[1:04:00] become a slave to the enemy before you
[1:04:02] ever took on an adamic nature a sinful
[1:04:04] nature a corrupt mind God already spoke
[1:04:08] a word concerning
[1:04:12] you
[1:04:14] amen hallelujah brother Ram said you
[1:04:17] might have gotten felt
[1:04:19] religious decide to join a
[1:04:22] church having that sinfulness nature he
[1:04:24] said but then you got under the right
[1:04:27] the atmosphere of God and he said you
[1:04:30] get under that atmosphere of God you're
[1:04:31] bound to recognize who your father is
[1:04:33] like the little Eagle recognized who his
[1:04:36] mother was see only you are God's
[1:04:40] attribute can you say I am God's
[1:04:45] attribute I am only you are God's
[1:04:48] attributes that's become a word
[1:04:51] spoken and then the holy SP Spirit seeks
[1:04:54] that word
[1:04:56] out not seeking your talents not seeking
[1:04:58] your ability not seeking your
[1:05:00] smarts how good you are and educated no
[1:05:03] no no there was a word that was spoken
[1:05:05] before the foundation of the world now
[1:05:08] the Bible says uh uh what is it the
[1:05:10] foundation of God standeth sure the Lord
[1:05:12] knoweth them that are his so he's
[1:05:14] already established you before the
[1:05:16] foundation world now the Holy Ghost
[1:05:18] comes seeking you out and not seeking
[1:05:21] just you he's seeking that word out
[1:05:23] there a promised word concerning you
[1:05:25] brother
[1:05:27] Bal I know you might have had a rough
[1:05:29] life and you might have had everything
[1:05:31] going against you but somewhere the Holy
[1:05:33] Ghost found you because there was a word
[1:05:36] inside of you that God saw you
[1:05:38] triumphant God saw you overcoming God
[1:05:40] saw you if there's ever time in your
[1:05:43] life that you become an overcomer is
[1:05:45] when God sought you out amen and he CAU
[1:05:48] that word and that word becomes
[1:05:50] quickened in you and all of a sudden you
[1:05:52] start Rising above all the you start
[1:05:54] Rising above all the critics you start
[1:05:56] Rising above everything else amen you
[1:05:59] lived a defeated life we lived a
[1:06:01] defeated life we were born defeated in
[1:06:03] the first place but we'll never die
[1:06:05] defeated we'll never end defeated we are
[1:06:09] the Conqueror because he saw us to be
[1:06:11] that
[1:06:12] way he saw us to be that way so the
[1:06:16] prophet said see the Holy Spirit called
[1:06:18] you and gave you everlasting life and
[1:06:20] brought you into the presence of God
[1:06:23] God's word
[1:06:24] and he says when the spirit of God comes
[1:06:26] upon you and you truly are one of God's
[1:06:30] attributes that he spoke of now if
[1:06:32] you're not you'll wander frustrate run
[1:06:35] here and there and everything else
[1:06:36] you'll never come to the knowledge of
[1:06:37] truth but if you're one of those the old
[1:06:41] things pass away right quick and you
[1:06:43] become new and the Plan of Salvation is
[1:06:49] finished you glad for that you say but
[1:06:52] I'm not where I need to be the Plan of
[1:06:53] Salvation A's
[1:06:55] finished amen it's done you're ready to
[1:06:58] obey every word that God ever spoke of
[1:07:00] you for you to do you're submissive to
[1:07:03] his word the contract exactly the
[1:07:05] abstract to the contract the title deed
[1:07:07] belongs to you the debts are all paid
[1:07:10] it's all struck off and as it was at the
[1:07:13] day of Pentecost can you say Amen so I
[1:07:17] as we go here I want to say this that
[1:07:19] pray our prayer to God is not about
[1:07:22] giving God new
[1:07:25] information that he can compute in his
[1:07:29] mind as though we would comp you know
[1:07:32] type in information in our computers and
[1:07:34] things and save it and all these things
[1:07:37] but but prayer is not us uh giving God
[1:07:41] new information concerning the things
[1:07:43] that we have need of uh Matthew 6:7
[1:07:47] Jesus said when you pray use not vain
[1:07:49] repetitions as the heathens do uh for
[1:07:53] for they think that they shall be heard
[1:07:55] for their much speaking see be ye not
[1:07:58] therefore like unto them for your father
[1:08:00] everybody say my father see your father
[1:08:03] knoweth what things you have need of
[1:08:06] before you ask amen him amen so then
[1:08:11] even though God knows what we have need
[1:08:14] of then again we the the the human mind
[1:08:16] says well then why do I pray if he knows
[1:08:19] if he knows I'm in this bad shape if he
[1:08:21] knows that the enemy is about to kill me
[1:08:24] if he knows you
[1:08:28] know I don't think I can make it
[1:08:32] anymore he knows it where's he
[1:08:36] at well it's in you to pray amen because
[1:08:42] here and we've we've read it before we
[1:08:47] talked about it but he he wants us as
[1:08:49] redeemed Sons to talk to him and ask him
[1:08:51] amen before be he this is his law be as
[1:08:55] as redeemed Sons and Daughters before he
[1:08:58] can supply the need you got to ask
[1:09:02] him and it's scriptural Matthew
[1:09:05] 9:37 Jesus said that he's talking to his
[1:09:08] disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous
[1:09:11] but the laborers are few so he's already
[1:09:13] telling them the need they even didn't
[1:09:15] know the need he knew the need he's
[1:09:18] telling them the need but now what does
[1:09:20] he do pray ye therefore the lord of the
[1:09:23] Harvest that he will send forth labors
[1:09:25] into his well brother brand said he was
[1:09:28] the lord of the Harvest the lord of the
[1:09:31] Harvest is telling his disciples what is
[1:09:34] needed and now he's saying you pray to
[1:09:37] me that I will send forth the the
[1:09:41] laborers can you say amen and brother BR
[1:09:44] said well why does he do that because
[1:09:46] the kingdom of God lays within you the
[1:09:49] kingdom of God lays within you brother
[1:09:51] Bob the kingdom of God plays within you
[1:09:54] we're talking about redeemed Sons and
[1:09:56] Daughters of God God now you think of
[1:09:59] how positive how positive he is in in
[1:10:03] his works of Calvary that he would ask
[1:10:06] us to speak it yeah and our words he
[1:10:12] acts upon all right praise the Lord so
[1:10:17] is this not what the adoption of sons is
[1:10:20] about amen Luke 12:32 Jesus says fear
[1:10:24] not little flock fear not there's that
[1:10:26] word fear not for it is your father's
[1:10:28] good pleasure to give you the kingdom
[1:10:31] ain't that right so then we are Sons and
[1:10:34] Daughters of God who have been placed in
[1:10:37] a position of authority so then our
[1:10:40] prayer isn't just an utterance of
[1:10:44] words but it's a prayer of power and
[1:10:48] authority right ask what you will and it
[1:10:53] sh
[1:10:54] be done unto you that's can you say Amen
[1:10:59] so why how does that make it happen What
[1:11:02] wh my words my little feeble words I
[1:11:06] struggle with praying I struggle with
[1:11:08] what what words to say my little old
[1:11:10] feble words has power yes because the
[1:11:13] blood of Jesus Christ makes it possible
[1:11:16] the blood of Jesus Christ makes it
[1:11:18] possible that when you utter your little
[1:11:20] feeble words God hears them
[1:11:24] amen that's the
[1:11:26] trth
[1:11:28] yes Revelations 51 and I saw in the
[1:11:32] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[1:11:34] a book written within and on the
[1:11:36] backside sealed with Seven Seals and I
[1:11:38] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:11:41] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:11:43] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[1:11:46] no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither
[1:11:48] under the Earth was able to open the
[1:11:50] book neither to look there on and I wet
[1:11:52] much because no man was found worthy to
[1:11:55] open and to read the book neither to
[1:11:57] look there on so what was it John was
[1:12:00] looking at a sealed book of redemption
[1:12:03] and brother Brown said he cried because
[1:12:05] if that book was not taken out of the
[1:12:06] hand of the original owner where it had
[1:12:09] been lost by Adam and Eve and went back
[1:12:12] after they had forfeited their rights of
[1:12:13] the word their the promises their
[1:12:15] inheritance think of that they forfeit
[1:12:17] it they had the word they had the power
[1:12:19] to make it come to pass and they
[1:12:21] forfeited that power they for fored
[1:12:23] their promises they forfeited their
[1:12:25] inheritance everything for forfeited and
[1:12:27] it went back into the hands of the owner
[1:12:30] not into the hands of the Devil he's a
[1:12:34] squatter can you say man brother Brown
[1:12:37] said see remember they controlled the
[1:12:39] Earth he was an amateur God for he was a
[1:12:41] Son of God and a son of God is an
[1:12:44] amateur God ain't that right so can can
[1:12:47] I can I ask you what made man an amateur
[1:12:50] God what made him an amateur God the
[1:12:52] same thing that made the prophets Gods
[1:12:55] remember remember Jesus called the
[1:12:58] prophets Gods the Bible calls them Gods
[1:13:00] to whom the word of the Lord
[1:13:04] came amen the word came to the prophets
[1:13:07] ain't that right and the word coming to
[1:13:10] the prophets made them Gods yes
[1:13:14] sir it's true true and man in the
[1:13:18] beginning had the word and him having
[1:13:21] the word made him God over the
[1:13:26] Earth an amateur God can you say man man
[1:13:30] being a Son of God was part of his
[1:13:32] father God ain't that right brother
[1:13:36] Brown said see When sin came in we found
[1:13:38] out that man crossed the chasm and the
[1:13:41] blood of bulls and goats covered but it
[1:13:43] did not remit see until the real bleach
[1:13:47] that blood y'all remember brother BR
[1:13:48] talking about the blood being the bleach
[1:13:51] came that could take the stain of sin
[1:13:54] and break it completely to pieces and
[1:13:56] send it back upon its original perverter
[1:13:59] that was Satan ain't that right and he
[1:14:01] says I believe that sin will be broke up
[1:14:03] now he's talking about Millennium amen
[1:14:06] and and the new where where Satan will
[1:14:07] not be there there will not be a mind
[1:14:09] battle there will not be a habit there
[1:14:11] will not be an evil thing amen you'll
[1:14:13] actually you worship God here lifting up
[1:14:16] holy hands with mind battles and with
[1:14:18] aches and the pains and sometime when we
[1:14:21] raise our hands our shoulders are
[1:14:22] hurting our hands are numb amen we're
[1:14:25] aching in our body we've got a headache
[1:14:26] running the fever and and the mind
[1:14:29] battles and the plague of of Satan just
[1:14:32] tormenting us but there will come a time
[1:14:34] when sin will be no more he will be
[1:14:37] completely
[1:14:38] annihilated there will be no such thing
[1:14:41] as a devil anymore you think of that now
[1:14:45] he says I believe that sin will be broke
[1:14:47] up and when it's confessed upon the
[1:14:48] basis of the blood of Jesus Christ it's
[1:14:50] like dropping a a a a drop of Black Ink
[1:14:53] in a bunch of clorex bleach he said see
[1:14:56] it just breaks it into the chemicals and
[1:14:58] sends it Plum back to where it came from
[1:15:01] that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:15:03] does notice then that sets a man across
[1:15:06] the chasm again as a Son of
[1:15:08] God do you believe that Hallelujah he
[1:15:13] said see then he becomes he said why he
[1:15:15] said even he's he said the creative
[1:15:18] power of God is in him and at least
[1:15:21] whenever God can command it to be done
[1:15:24] it will be done why the chasm is
[1:15:33] gone think of it there used to be a
[1:15:35] Chasm between you and
[1:15:38] godess
[1:15:42] Lord Wonder no relationship no
[1:15:46] understanding no comprehension of
[1:15:51] him but when he come and he drop Dro
[1:15:53] that bleach upon you that blood God it
[1:15:56] removes the chasm praise the Lord now
[1:15:59] you come to understanding you come
[1:16:01] there's nothing there to stop you you're
[1:16:04] back to being sons of God again Lord can
[1:16:07] you say Amen why because of the blood of
[1:16:09] Jesus Christ now notice Moses under the
[1:16:12] blood of bulls and goats spoke and even
[1:16:15] created things by the word of the Lord
[1:16:18] ain't that right he did it but how did
[1:16:21] he do it under the blood of bulls and
[1:16:24] goats think of that one brother Brown
[1:16:27] said now if it'll do that under the
[1:16:29] blood of bulls what about the blood of
[1:16:32] Jesus Christ see the blood of bulls and
[1:16:34] goats could not remit
[1:16:36] sins it only covered the sin and yet
[1:16:39] under that natural blood of that animal
[1:16:42] Moses having having the word could speak
[1:16:45] a creative word and bring flies and
[1:16:48] bring this and bring that into existence
[1:16:51] under that type of a blood
[1:16:53] what can the church
[1:16:58] do see not covered but remitted it all
[1:17:01] together you stand in the presence of
[1:17:03] God as a redeemed son the church is far
[1:17:06] beyond its standard of
[1:17:09] living notice that there's something
[1:17:11] wrong somewhere in the churches he says
[1:17:14] and I think it's the denominational
[1:17:15] systems that's Twisted the people's mind
[1:17:18] and so forth until they don't know how
[1:17:20] to do
[1:17:21] it aren't you glad to be in the message
[1:17:23] of the hour the Lord why as we quoted
[1:17:26] the quote several times now brother
[1:17:29] Brian says the the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:17:31] is to restore the faith and what does he
[1:17:33] say change the minds of the people why
[1:17:37] bringing them back to what Adam was the
[1:17:40] denominations has twisted our minds the
[1:17:43] Creeds and their unbelief and their
[1:17:45] doubts and the human efforts and and the
[1:17:48] exaltation of personality and humanity
[1:17:51] and all that has Twisted the mind minds
[1:17:53] of the people that God would send a
[1:17:55] prophet to change our
[1:17:59] minds yes sir amen he said that's right
[1:18:02] but we're promised that it'll be
[1:18:04] revealed now the churches have lost
[1:18:07] connection or the answer on how to bring
[1:18:11] the people back to what God has called
[1:18:13] them to be so now he says we find out
[1:18:17] that in the revealing of the seals that
[1:18:19] the lamb had left his mediatorial work
[1:18:21] as an intercessor and had come forth now
[1:18:24] to claim his rights all that he had
[1:18:27] Redeemed by his death what has he done
[1:18:29] in this day to claim his rights amen yes
[1:18:34] sir are you his rights you bet you are
[1:18:37] this Earth Is His
[1:18:41] rights and you are his rights go go go
[1:18:45] listen to the Future home of the
[1:18:47] Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:18:51] bride the L had left his mediatorial
[1:18:54] work as an intercessor and has come
[1:18:56] forth now to claim his rights all that
[1:18:58] he had Redeemed by his death no one
[1:19:00] could open the book no one understood it
[1:19:02] it was a book of redemption and God the
[1:19:04] Father the spirit had it in his hand
[1:19:07] because Christ was at the throne as a
[1:19:09] mediator the only mediator there could
[1:19:11] be no saint no Mary no Joseph nothing
[1:19:13] else on that altar because it was blood
[1:19:16] and only the blood of Jesus Christ could
[1:19:17] make the atonement so nothing else could
[1:19:19] be standing as a mediator there was
[1:19:21] nothing else am so he said see in
[1:19:24] another place John was weeping he
[1:19:25] couldn't find nobody in Earth in heaven
[1:19:28] C all was on the other side of the chasm
[1:19:31] oh was see a sin see there was no man an
[1:19:34] angel of course he'd be worthy but after
[1:19:37] all it had to be a kinsman redeemer it
[1:19:39] had to be human being and there was no
[1:19:41] such a thing see because every man had
[1:19:43] been born by sex and and had taken it
[1:19:47] took one to uh to uh uh to be born
[1:19:51] without it see so God himself took that
[1:19:55] in the Virgin birth and become Emanuel
[1:19:57] and his blood uh was the the one that
[1:20:00] was worthy and when he crossed this
[1:20:03] Chasm himself paid the price and then he
[1:20:06] bridged way for the rest of us then he
[1:20:09] sat down to be a mediator and he's been
[1:20:11] sitting there can you say Amen but
[1:20:14] notice he didn't just build a bridge and
[1:20:16] and and we're walking across the bridge
[1:20:19] and looking down and seeing this Chasm
[1:20:21] no no no no in Place brother Brown said
[1:20:23] he took the chasm away yes sir prise the
[1:20:28] Lord so you ain't walking across the
[1:20:31] bridge thinking oh my goodness you know
[1:20:32] we go with Royal Gorge there in Colorado
[1:20:35] it's a th000 ft down you know and it's
[1:20:38] it's it's a bridge built you know with
[1:20:40] wood and it's got gaps that when you're
[1:20:42] walking you can look down and it's
[1:20:44] thousand feet and my wife's was scared
[1:20:47] to death you know because you're
[1:20:49] thinking oh no cuz some of them boards
[1:20:50] are like a little cracked and a little
[1:20:52] bit this a little chipped and they're
[1:20:54] old boards you know but I got to
[1:20:57] thinking about this Chasm that Heen we
[1:20:59] we're not walking Something That We're
[1:21:01] scared of that oh my it might fall there
[1:21:04] is no
[1:21:06] Chasm it's
[1:21:09] done you're so secured you can't fail
[1:21:15] Lord now what good is it though to be
[1:21:18] redeemed and not have the
[1:21:21] word the Lord the blood made a way for
[1:21:24] us to come back to God it done away with
[1:21:26] the chasm that separated us there is no
[1:21:30] Chasm
[1:21:32] now the word everybody say the word word
[1:21:36] has been restored to
[1:21:38] us the
[1:21:41] word it the
[1:21:44] book that Adam forfeited That's right
[1:21:48] The Inheritance that Adam forfeited has
[1:21:51] now been given to us
[1:21:53] Revelations 10:1 the mighty Angel come
[1:21:56] down with an open book and the prophet
[1:21:58] said the seven Angel is on the earth at
[1:22:00] the same time and he hands that book to
[1:22:03] the seventh angel that he could reveal
[1:22:05] the book to the people what restoring
[1:22:07] the word to the people can you say Amen
[1:22:11] that you wouldn't speak what a
[1:22:12] denomination told you you would speak
[1:22:14] the word like Adam
[1:22:16] gave that's good word restored can you
[1:22:19] say Amen now we can pray a prayer of
[1:22:22] faith
[1:22:25] that's
[1:22:27] good praise the Lord now that the word
[1:22:30] has been restored it's time for the
[1:22:31] manifestation of
[1:22:33] Sons Sons of God right it's time for the
[1:22:36] sons of God redeemed Sons to speak with
[1:22:39] authority brother Bri said notice what
[1:22:42] Harmony Jesus never did anything until
[1:22:44] he seen of the Father the father showed
[1:22:47] him first Harmony between God and Christ
[1:22:49] so will be
[1:22:51] bright
[1:22:53] amen so will the bride before that
[1:22:56] Harmony could come the word had to be
[1:22:58] restored to you amen the word had to be
[1:23:01] restored to us and then we come in
[1:23:03] agreement with that word you see what
[1:23:04] the devil's trying to do he's trying to
[1:23:06] do what he done to Eve but the prophet
[1:23:09] said it'll never happen you're not that
[1:23:12] type of
[1:23:14] woman you will not Surrender Your your
[1:23:17] rights that's right you will not forfeit
[1:23:19] this book you will not for forfeit your
[1:23:22] Authority amen instead you'll use that
[1:23:25] Authority you'll speak the word of God
[1:23:27] and what Adam failed to do you're doing
[1:23:32] it can you say Amen so will the bride he
[1:23:35] shows her his word of life he shows her
[1:23:38] she receives
[1:23:40] it she never doubts it nothing can harm
[1:23:45] her not even death for if the seed be
[1:23:48] planted the water will raise it up again
[1:23:50] he says then I got a great big
[1:23:52] Hallelujah
[1:23:53] here is the
[1:23:54] secret the word word is in the bride in
[1:23:58] the bride the word is in that redeemed
[1:24:01] Sons and Daughters the word not only
[1:24:04] have you been restored the chasm has
[1:24:06] been taken away and you're restored to
[1:24:07] Fellowship he's handed you the book the
[1:24:10] word is now in The Bride Can you say
[1:24:14] amen and the mind of Christ to know what
[1:24:17] he wants done with the word she does it
[1:24:20] in his name she has the sayith the Lord
[1:24:23] did she get thus sayith the Lord outside
[1:24:25] of a prophet absolutely not for the for
[1:24:28] the Bible says the spirit and the bride
[1:24:30] say come and the prophet said the spirit
[1:24:33] the bride and the prophet will be saying
[1:24:35] the same thing whatever the the spirit
[1:24:38] says the prophet says whatever the
[1:24:39] prophet says the bride
[1:24:42] Echoes that's right good she does it in
[1:24:45] his name she has thus sayith the Lord
[1:24:47] then it is gered so the Holy Spirit
[1:24:50] Waters it until it is grown and serves
[1:24:52] his purpose that word that you speak the
[1:24:55] Holy Spirit Waters it yes sir can you
[1:24:58] say amen amen they do only his will yeah
[1:25:01] think of that that's why you know I
[1:25:05] telling the church over there oh that's
[1:25:07] why you know we we as ministers don't
[1:25:11] get
[1:25:11] discouraged in the sense that we just
[1:25:13] give up on the
[1:25:15] message we we don't we don't we don't
[1:25:17] dictate our sermons and all that based
[1:25:19] upon what we see of you
[1:25:23] amen we we we don't allow this message
[1:25:26] you you your faults and your failures
[1:25:28] and your incapabilities brother Tim to
[1:25:31] dictate the
[1:25:33] sermons we preach it with everything
[1:25:35] that we got what are we preaching
[1:25:38] promise promise promise why because I
[1:25:41] know that the holy spirit will go out
[1:25:43] there and water it water it and that
[1:25:46] word will start growing and the word
[1:25:47] will start growing and as you receive
[1:25:49] the word you begin to overcome this and
[1:25:51] overcome that and overcome that you
[1:25:53] begin to take your rightful
[1:25:57] position can you say man it's not in
[1:26:00] vain your prayer is not in vain no no
[1:26:05] man it's not in vain they do only his
[1:26:07] will they have thus say the Lord to keep
[1:26:09] still then they will do the works of God
[1:26:12] for it is himself in them continuing his
[1:26:14] word to fulfill as he did complete in
[1:26:17] his day all things when he was here then
[1:26:20] he says he did not complete all when he
[1:26:22] was here for it was not yet time can you
[1:26:25] say Amen it was not all yet time but it
[1:26:28] is time it is time he done his part of
[1:26:32] the Covenant now it's him doing his
[1:26:34] other part in
[1:26:37] you you love him I love think of where
[1:26:40] we're standing today Moses could speak
[1:26:43] the word and watch you create under the
[1:26:44] blood of bulls and goats about it and
[1:26:47] yet the blood of bulls and goats could
[1:26:48] not take away the sins of the people so
[1:26:51] much it could not take way that adultery
[1:26:53] when when a child was born illegitimate
[1:26:55] in in
[1:26:58] adultery that child nor his
[1:27:01] seed could not
[1:27:04] come into the congregation of the Lord
[1:27:07] the
[1:27:08] righteous think of that could not come
[1:27:10] into a church right
[1:27:13] for 10 10 Generations 10 generations and
[1:27:17] a generation is 40 years so 400 years
[1:27:21] that's true now you think
[1:27:22] that could you imagine being in the
[1:27:24] middle of that generation and you can't
[1:27:26] come because of what you're great great
[1:27:28] great great
[1:27:29] great about it and yet under that Blood
[1:27:33] Brother Brown said see there was nothing
[1:27:35] there strong enough to forgive that sin
[1:27:38] the blood of the Old Testament did not
[1:27:40] forgive sins it covered sins but the
[1:27:43] blood of Jesus Christ divorces it that's
[1:27:47] different now can you say Amen but yet
[1:27:51] Moses was a able to speak a creative
[1:27:53] word under that
[1:27:56] blood now notice the word of God spoken
[1:27:59] through Moses the Creator because under
[1:28:02] the blood he was standing in the
[1:28:05] presence of God and his own words wasn't
[1:28:08] his word now notice John 15:7 Jesus said
[1:28:12] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:28:15] you that's right showing that there is
[1:28:18] no
[1:28:19] Chasm if you abide in me my words abide
[1:28:23] in you you shall ask whatever you will
[1:28:27] praise the Lord can you say amen and it
[1:28:30] shall be done you see God wants us to
[1:28:34] ask you believe that amen John 15 and5
[1:28:39] Jesus says I am the vine you are the
[1:28:40] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:28:42] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:28:45] brother brah said see the vine can't
[1:28:47] bear fruit the branches in the vine
[1:28:49] bears fruit God cannot not bear fruit of
[1:28:53] himself it's got to take the church amen
[1:28:59] it's got to take you branches to bear
[1:29:01] fruit and when you branches are yielded
[1:29:03] to the vine then fruit comes forth you
[1:29:05] see what I mean God wants your hands God
[1:29:08] wants your eyes he wants your tongue
[1:29:09] your lips your ears your hands feet so
[1:29:12] that he can bring forth fruit into you
[1:29:16] so God wants us to make our petition
[1:29:19] known in prayer yeah
[1:29:22] see but we are to pray the prayer of
[1:29:25] faith amen Now give me just a few more
[1:29:28] minutes and then I'll let you
[1:29:32] go 1 Corinthians 2 and 3 Paul says and I
[1:29:35] was with you in weakness and fear and in
[1:29:38] fear and in much trembling and my speech
[1:29:41] and my preaching was not with enticing
[1:29:44] words of men's wisdom but in what
[1:29:48] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[1:29:52] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:29:55] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[1:30:00] ain't that right so where is our faith
[1:30:02] supposed to stand it isn't to stand in
[1:30:06] the letter of the
[1:30:07] word
[1:30:09] hello 2 Corinthians 3:6 the letter kth
[1:30:13] but the spirit giveth life our faith
[1:30:16] isn't to stand in just a lecture of the
[1:30:19] word I looked up word lecture it's a
[1:30:22] talk given before an audience or class
[1:30:24] especially for instruction to give a
[1:30:26] formal often extended talk on a subject
[1:30:29] brother Bram said we couldn't find him
[1:30:32] in fine lectures because we find people
[1:30:35] who can stand up and explain the word in
[1:30:37] such a way it's just breathtaking but
[1:30:40] when we find it it's still still a
[1:30:43] lecture just a lecture it's the
[1:30:45] mechanics and we find the Entertainer
[1:30:47] who can go through all the actions and
[1:30:50] so forth but that still is isn't it see
[1:30:53] that isn't what we're looking for we we
[1:30:55] find the religious top with the robes on
[1:30:57] and so forth but that still isn't what
[1:31:00] we're looking for can you say Amen see
[1:31:02] we don't want your faith to stand in a
[1:31:05] history lesson of what Calvary
[1:31:08] was or what Jesus Christ was or what
[1:31:11] David did and Moses did and and all of
[1:31:14] these things see and we do not want it
[1:31:16] to stand in the wisdom of
[1:31:19] men ain't that right amen Faith isn't to
[1:31:22] stand in the psychic side of the Bible
[1:31:25] where brother Brown said you only
[1:31:27] understand what he did back in Years
[1:31:29] Gone by can you say Amen but see your
[1:31:32] faith is to stand in the demonstration
[1:31:34] and the power of God so when you to pray
[1:31:38] the prayer of faith then you have to
[1:31:41] believe in the Supernatural side of the
[1:31:44] word not in the psychic part of the word
[1:31:48] where you understand this word mentally
[1:31:51] but you see it
[1:31:54] supernaturally that this word that we
[1:31:56] talk about there is a reality to
[1:32:01] it and you say amen amen Divine Healing
[1:32:05] is so unusual to the people till they
[1:32:07] don't know what well brother BR said
[1:32:09] they don't want to believe in it and yet
[1:32:12] yet it's a promised word ain't that
[1:32:15] right see and and he says we have seen
[1:32:17] in this day what we have seen is so
[1:32:19] unusual to the human mind
[1:32:22] uh who has never thought of it in the
[1:32:24] way that it has come it's so unusual but
[1:32:27] yet it's in the promised word amen ain't
[1:32:30] that right see when Jesus raised from
[1:32:32] the dead it was so unusual to so many
[1:32:34] people even to the people that loved him
[1:32:36] and believed him to be a prophet and
[1:32:38] believed him to be the Son of God yet
[1:32:41] but the the the resurrection was just
[1:32:43] too much for them to believe because it
[1:32:46] was just too much of a phenomenon can
[1:32:49] you say Amen brother brand said you take
[1:32:51] anything that's really way out in the
[1:32:53] phenomena like that always check it with
[1:32:55] the
[1:32:56] word can you say Amen don't so so then
[1:33:00] then there's your balance don't just
[1:33:02] anything that is done Supernatural you
[1:33:04] know you see the guy blow and you know
[1:33:07] and people fall over check it with the
[1:33:11] word you know when you see them waving
[1:33:14] and everybody just falls out you know I
[1:33:16] was watching a little bit of that
[1:33:17] preacher you know last night and uh
[1:33:20] seeing if you steal r and oh he's still
[1:33:22] around you know and he just you know and
[1:33:25] they just fall pick him up pick him up
[1:33:26] hurry hurry hurry up you know and he's
[1:33:28] so he he is so nervous and radical he's
[1:33:31] pushing even the guys that are helping
[1:33:32] him get over here pick them up you know
[1:33:36] then he do it again them guys are
[1:33:39] just check it with the word word check
[1:33:42] everything with the word can you say
[1:33:43] Amen but the word has phenomenon the
[1:33:47] word has the phenomenal side to it do
[1:33:49] you believe that he said if if the word
[1:33:52] promised it and he says see always check
[1:33:54] it with the word but if the word
[1:33:56] promised it then it's only God Rising on
[1:33:59] the scene again and that's the way every
[1:34:02] promise is can you say Amen so see when
[1:34:05] God promised God promised he would raise
[1:34:08] Jesus up on the third day do you believe
[1:34:10] that David said I'll not leave his soul
[1:34:12] in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy
[1:34:14] One to seek corruption see so Jesus
[1:34:17] understood the scripture he understood
[1:34:19] that that scripture pertained to him and
[1:34:21] he even told his Skeptics destroy this
[1:34:23] Temple and within 3 days I'll raise it
[1:34:25] up again why he understood it his faith
[1:34:28] was in the scripture but it wasn't just
[1:34:30] in the word it was in the phenomenon of
[1:34:32] that
[1:34:35] word it was a promise it was impossible
[1:34:39] to the human mind for him to raise he
[1:34:41] was a man that was crucified he died as
[1:34:43] a man
[1:34:45] true his spear a spear was drove right
[1:34:49] through his heart he bled out every
[1:34:51] ounce of blood was drained from him he
[1:34:56] took him and sealed him in a tomb where
[1:34:58] the Romans seal the prophet said and
[1:35:00] rode a stone over the
[1:35:02] opening but he rose again amen just as
[1:35:06] the scripture said he would exactly he
[1:35:08] rose again and he knew he would amen
[1:35:11] What Faith Can you say amen he did
[1:35:14] Brother Braham said it takes the same
[1:35:16] kind of phenomena when people thinks
[1:35:18] he's died that settled it 1900 years ago
[1:35:20] and here he is today after 1900 years
[1:35:23] he's still Among Us just as much as he
[1:35:25] was then just as real as he was then
[1:35:27] doing the same things he did then and
[1:35:29] it's too much of a phenomenon the people
[1:35:31] can't understand it it goes beyond their
[1:35:33] reasoning can you say amen he said many
[1:35:36] didn't see it in Jesus day because they
[1:35:38] hadn't searched the scriptures they
[1:35:39] hadn't listened to what he had said and
[1:35:42] he said many today hasn't listened to
[1:35:44] the message hasn't listen to the
[1:35:45] scripture and what Christ has promised
[1:35:48] in these last days that's the reason
[1:35:49] that people are in the condition that
[1:35:51] they're in and the churches are all
[1:35:53] gummed up among one another see they
[1:35:55] haven't noticed what the scripture said
[1:35:57] for this day they they didn't notice
[1:35:59] what these things had notice these
[1:36:02] things had to be done it's just
[1:36:03] fulfilling of the scripture many people
[1:36:05] love him many people believe in him but
[1:36:07] yet it's too phenomena see they can't
[1:36:10] understand it when you talk about him
[1:36:11] being just the same as he was yesterday
[1:36:14] doing the same things they claim they
[1:36:15] believe that but when it takes place
[1:36:17] they don't understand it see they just
[1:36:19] can't believe it but God wants your
[1:36:22] faith to stand in the power and
[1:36:24] demonstration of the Holy
[1:36:27] Ghost the word is being fulfilled today
[1:36:30] amen but where is it being fulfilled at
[1:36:33] in you in you in you can you say amen I
[1:36:37] believe and you have to believe in that
[1:36:39] your faith must stand
[1:36:41] there not in what Joshua did calling the
[1:36:44] son to stand still what about your words
[1:36:47] amen you say well if he'll move upon me
[1:36:50] maybe I can speak to the
[1:36:52] storms what about when you get into
[1:36:55] prayer you start praying the prayer of
[1:36:59] faith there's no greater weapon on this
[1:37:02] Earth than prayer if the musicians will
[1:37:05] come Gooding praise the Lord you love

[1:37:10] amen
[1:37:12] hallelujah thank God for this

[1:37:20] prayer
[1:37:23] he heareth the prayer of the righteous
[1:37:26] that's
[1:37:28] true from the wicked he's far
[1:37:32] away but he's n to them that call upon
[1:37:36] him that's what the Bible says he's nigh

[1:37:44] Lord why because the word now has come
[1:37:46] to you yes it's in your mouth what what
