[23:41] it was kind of neat one time I was on
[23:43] YouTube and that song popped up and they
[23:47] sang it and three different languages I
[23:49] think it was English Hebrew and Arabic I
[23:52] think or something and it was kind of
[23:53] neat to hear it the different ways but
[23:55] you know how we use different words in
[23:57] different languages but so we say
[23:59] promise
[24:00] keeper I think that's what it is but you
[24:03] know in the Hebrew the Arabic that it
[24:05] leans back on what it was originally it
[24:07] says I think in the one language it's
[24:09] Keeper of the Covenant and then the
[24:12] other one says Covenant keeper and I
[24:14] just thought that was neat the just the
[24:16] wording that uh
[24:17] it's glad we've got a keeper of the
[24:19] Covenant and
[24:22] okay
[24:24] he promised us that he would be a
[24:29] counselor
[24:32] a mighty God
[24:35] and the prince of peace
[24:38] [Music]
[24:42] that he
[24:45] a father
[24:49] and would love us with a love that would
[24:53] not cease

[39:15] like singing so uh the musicians can be
[39:19] dismissed and uh we uh just love the
[39:23] lord it's good to be in the house of the
[39:25] Lord amen
[39:26] and uh thank him for all his goodness
[39:30] and good to have brother Amos back in
[39:33] the house of the Lord tonight and had to
[39:36] work today I guess and so
[39:39] if you have your Bibles we're going to
[39:41] turn to the Book of Joshua
[39:43] the first chapter
[40:06] and um
[40:10] we'll read the eighth verse
[40:14] it says this book of the law
[40:17] shall not depart out of our mouth
[40:20] but Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[40:22] night
[40:23] that thou mayest observe to do according
[40:26] to all
[40:27] that is written therein
[40:30] for them everybody say then
[40:33] Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and
[40:36] then
[40:37] Thou shalt have good success
[40:41] amen let's just bow our heads
[40:44] precious Lord
[40:47] the songs Just uplifting
[40:51] it's coming from our heart lord it's an
[40:55] expression Lord of how we feel about you
[41:00] Lord you are our everything and
[41:03] we value so many times Lord
[41:07] certainly don't mean to and
[41:10] we just ask that you would forgive us of
[41:13] all of our sins
[41:15] and Lord May the worship be pleasing to
[41:18] you tonight Lord
[41:20] for it comes from a heart that's been
[41:22] redeemed
[41:24] Lord we've experienced your goodness
[41:26] we've experienced your grace
[41:29] and mercy Lord and we just thank you
[41:33] and now we're just asking that you would
[41:35] move Lord through your word and
[41:38] just speak to every heart
[41:40] all that you see the the simple thought
[41:44] that I would have tonight and I pray
[41:46] Lord that you would just
[41:48] multiply it to blessed father is our
[41:51] prayer
[41:52] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[41:55] amen and amen you can have your seeds
[42:01] I have just stayed
[42:03] simple thought
[42:05] and and
[42:08] um
[42:10] I guess the title would be meditating on
[42:12] the positive
[42:14] and
[42:16] um and the the
[42:19] scripture that we read here of course
[42:22] this is dealing with Joshua he's
[42:25] he's getting ready to take the the the
[42:28] people over into the promised land which
[42:30] has been long waited this has been
[42:32] something that
[42:34] uh they've lived for there's prophecies
[42:37] that have been been laying dormant and
[42:41] here now Joshua is Anointed
[42:45] to bring the people over
[42:48] and so
[42:50] when he's saying Thou shalt make thy way
[42:53] prosperous and then you should have
[42:55] success and you can see what that meant
[42:59] to Joshua
[43:00] that this is we're going in the land and
[43:05] the enemies there and you remember what
[43:07] the ten spies said
[43:09] uh we can't take it and and in the
[43:15] natural I mean they they they said we
[43:18] were as grasshoppers in their sight so
[43:20] man what a uh
[43:23] tremendous thing it was to them uh it
[43:27] was overwhelming
[43:28] and then not just the Johnston they're
[43:31] having to face walled cities and things
[43:34] in that nature and so here's the promise
[43:38] but there's obstacles that that just
[43:40] seem overwhelming but your God is is
[43:42] telling Joshua now there's a key to it
[43:46] and that is
[43:48] you don't let the book of the law depart
[43:51] from your mouth
[43:53] and you shall meditate there in day and
[43:57] night
[43:58] and I I think as as brother random he
[44:02] parallels This Book of Joshua with the
[44:04] book of Ephesians and Ephesians is our
[44:07] Joshua our land it talks about our
[44:10] inheritance and it talks about these
[44:12] things and and we know that's our
[44:16] scripture this that's that applies to us
[44:18] it never as far as I can see in the
[44:21] message it never applied to any other
[44:23] age but us
[44:24] and and so then when we read this then
[44:28] we we can can see how applicable it is
[44:31] to us
[44:33] I think it's strange and like I said I
[44:36] got simple thought I um uh
[44:39] anyways I think it's strange that it
[44:42] would be in this age
[44:44] that if if God has a law to success
[44:49] and I'm not talking in in natural I'm
[44:52] talking about our Promised Land
[44:55] then
[44:57] and that is to keep the word in our
[45:01] mouth
[45:02] and meditate upon it
[45:05] I think it's strange of how that Satan
[45:07] has developed so much to keep our minds
[45:10] occupied
[45:12] off the very thing
[45:15] that we need to have success and to be
[45:19] prosperous
[45:21] I I personally don't think that
[45:25] um
[45:26] that God would write these things get
[45:29] like let's give them the land
[45:31] and and say okay go for it and then they
[45:35] fail
[45:36] and and then they struggle and then they
[45:39] they they come up short
[45:41] in what God already promised them now
[45:45] that was the mindset of the ten spies
[45:49] God promised it but we can't
[45:52] God said we can do it but we can't
[45:54] because they forgot the law they forgot
[45:58] the key they forgot it and and so of
[46:03] course it was a mixed multitude and that
[46:06] makes multitude kept things stirring up
[46:08] it it kept them the people turning other
[46:12] directions instead of just staying with
[46:14] what the prophet said and and seeing
[46:18] what God was doing and and we could even
[46:21] look at that that that there's not just
[46:23] the voice of a prophet there's so many
[46:24] voices out here today uh uh one voice of
[46:28] God and many voices
[46:31] uh to contradict that and and that is
[46:34] ringing so loud brother REM says that
[46:36] it's almost drowning out the voice of
[46:38] God
[46:39] and and so we we are in in a time of
[46:43] mixed multitude a lot of religions a lot
[46:47] of uh uh confessions professions or
[46:50] whatever you want to call it but uh in
[46:53] the same time there is the voice of God
[46:55] and and the law of God Still Remains
[46:59] true uh for us to prosper and and have
[47:04] good success
[47:05] now last week this came to my mind and I
[47:09] so I wanted just to speak on it this
[47:11] afternoon and I'm not going to take long
[47:14] but uh but I'm I'm tonight I'm not
[47:17] addressing you as a professor with his
[47:20] students in a college of of some sort
[47:22] but I as a minister of the Gospel I
[47:26] believe I'm I'm talking to Sons and
[47:30] Daughters of God and we are Sons and
[47:33] Daughters of God so our approach is
[47:35] different than the way the world would
[47:38] approach things and and I'm looking at
[47:42] this word positive according to Webster
[47:44] it's fully assured it means fully
[47:47] assured and there's there's other
[47:49] meanings but but this word uh or this
[47:52] meaning is positive means fully assured
[47:55] confident
[47:57] a man fully assured confident now
[48:03] this means something to us because
[48:05] brother Branham said and and I didn't
[48:08] have the time and and so I'm going to
[48:10] I'm going to take some time uh to get
[48:13] more into it but brother Branham said
[48:15] make every word positive
[48:18] make every thought positive right so now
[48:23] he's telling this us for a reason now we
[48:26] we are people of the land we are people
[48:29] um uh of the open book right this this
[48:32] is our land right here and and it had
[48:36] been closed up it's it's been you know
[48:38] and a lot of challenges and things but
[48:41] then it's it's been open to us but to be
[48:45] positive to be fully assured to be
[48:47] confident then there can be no questions
[48:49] to things uh uh and and so you know uh
[48:54] you you cannot have a sure Foundation
[48:57] under you when you have questions and I
[49:01] don't I don't even think maybe even in
[49:03] the natural you you you can a person
[49:05] can't be successful even in a business
[49:07] if he's questioning the business
[49:10] uh you know if he's not sure about the
[49:13] business if the business is not solid if
[49:15] it's and and uh you know you you have a
[49:19] lot of people wanting to get rich quick
[49:21] you know and things like that and then
[49:23] they jump into things never questioning
[49:25] it or or just not not really sure if
[49:29] it's going to work but but they they
[49:31] just go into it and and but but to be
[49:35] positive a man has to be positive he has
[49:39] to know where he's standing
[49:40] and and and and if there's anything that
[49:43] throws questions that's the devil the
[49:45] devil puts questions constantly he's got
[49:48] questions he always questioned the word
[49:50] of God remember even questioned Jesus if
[49:53] thou be the Son of God do this if thou
[49:56] be do this if thou be and it was always
[49:58] question question question he never came
[50:01] to Jesus with solid uh uh Thou Art the
[50:04] Son of God now I'd like to see you do
[50:06] this it was always if thou be and and so
[50:10] because he was trying to get Jesus to
[50:13] prove amen get him in a place that he
[50:15] would prove that he was the son of God
[50:17] right and so Satan is constantly
[50:21] throwing questions uh out there well you
[50:25] know to where we you know if we're not
[50:27] careful we will listen to them and it
[50:30] could be thoughts just coming into our
[50:31] mind that are you know thoughts of
[50:34] unworthiness thoughts of well uh will we
[50:37] really make it thoughts and I've really
[50:39] forgiven thoughts of you know uh uh is
[50:43] is there really hope for me is thoughts
[50:45] of uh you know what is my future and but
[50:48] but questions but I think we have
[50:50] answers
[50:51] I I think we have answers to these
[50:54] questions that that we don't constantly
[50:57] have to listen to that or or that we
[50:59] don't have to uh allow them questions to
[51:03] come into us but we can actually
[51:04] meditate not on questions but on the
[51:06] answers
[51:07] can you say man and and so uh um uh so
[51:12] so we cannot be unsure if because if
[51:16] you're unsure you will not move forward
[51:18] in in confidence you you won't move
[51:21] forward in faith and and if you're
[51:23] unsure if you're questioning you won't
[51:25] move and and that's what happened with
[51:27] the 10 spies right they they didn't they
[51:31] they had the answer but they looked at
[51:33] everything else but the answer and and
[51:35] they trembled in in in fear and and so
[51:39] they they said we can't take it that was
[51:41] the the the final analysis uh for them
[51:45] uh uh and so uh but James James said in
[51:50] uh James 1 6 and I did not give them the
[51:53] scriptures they may be a little slow uh
[51:56] getting them up but James said but let
[51:59] him ask in faith
[52:02] right let him ask in faith now he's
[52:06] talking about if any man lack wisdom
[52:08] asking us as let him ask of God but we
[52:12] can let's just put it in anything of Our
[52:15] Lives you see the promises of God you
[52:19] you see them well ask and you shall
[52:21] receive right every everything is is
[52:24] asking everything is is you're looking
[52:26] at it and and and you're wanting it I
[52:29] think that's the desire of every one of
[52:31] us here tonight when you listen to the
[52:33] tapes when you listen to the messages
[52:35] all you hear is the promises of God and
[52:38] and there's something in you say that's
[52:40] what I want that's what I'm after that's
[52:41] that's that's what I'm seeking for right
[52:43] but let him ask in faith
[52:48] he let him ask in faith nothing wavering
[52:52] don't don't waver when you ask so when
[52:55] you're approaching these promises and
[52:57] and and and and you're looking at these
[53:00] things don't waver in them in any way so
[53:04] that means you've got to be a solid
[53:05] there there has to be a positive to this
[53:08] right clearly confident and so he says
[53:12] for he that wavereth is like the wave a
[53:15] wave of the sea driven With the Wind uh
[53:19] and tossed for let not that man think
[53:22] that he shall receive anything of the
[53:24] Lord uh and now now that's not what God
[53:28] wants us to be to where we come to the
[53:30] place of the promises and then we
[53:32] receive nothing we we we're not to go
[53:35] into prayer and and come up empty-handed
[53:38] we're not to serve God only to be
[53:40] empty-handed at the end he says I've
[53:43] Jesus I've ordained you know called you
[53:46] and over ordained that you should bring
[53:49] forth fruit and that your fruit should
[53:51] remain so so the there there's reality
[53:54] to promises there's reality to
[53:56] predestination there's there's reality
[53:59] to his choosing there's a reality to
[54:01] this adoption there's a reality to the
[54:04] message of the hour can you say man
[54:06] there was a reality to Joshua's
[54:09] leadership
[54:11] right there was a reality to the
[54:14] choosing of God choosing Joshua uh uh to
[54:18] lead the people over he wasn't to lead
[54:20] them over and then they all famished and
[54:22] die
[54:23] no no God wanted success God wanted them
[54:26] to to be prosperous right and and so let
[54:30] not that man think he shall receive
[54:31] anything of the Lord see for a
[54:34] double-minded man is unstable in all of
[54:38] his ways
[54:40] ain't that right so positive you you
[54:43] have to have a basis for positive being
[54:47] positive in other words there must be a
[54:49] source that you draw from and that
[54:52] Source has to be solid and ain't that
[54:55] right uh I don't care what you do you
[54:58] you want to you you want your your work
[55:01] you want your your whatever you want it
[55:04] to be solid if you're gonna you know if
[55:06] you're gonna give your ten thousand
[55:08] dollars to the bank you want that bank
[55:09] to be solid and to know that you know
[55:12] you ain't going to put it there and then
[55:14] tomorrow it's going to be gone from you
[55:16] if you're going to invest you you want
[55:18] to do the the the you you want to go
[55:20] into the what is solid what's going
[55:22] what's you know you understand surely we
[55:25] all know uh in in these things and so so
[55:29] how do we how do you get how do you get
[55:32] positive from politics
[55:34] you know how do you get you you get
[55:37] positive from the economy how do you get
[55:40] positive you know from the things that
[55:43] are failing right before our eyes there
[55:46] there's not a solid source to be
[55:47] positive in I'd be honest except we're
[55:50] going you know the ship's going down uh
[55:52] for this nation uh but but as far as
[55:55] just natural things uh where are you
[55:58] going to get it from the bright mind the
[56:00] greatest mind there is how are you going
[56:02] to draw positive from that you can say
[56:04] well we got it all worked out but how
[56:06] really I mean the greatest Minds have
[56:07] been working and working and working and
[56:09] look where we're at it's still not
[56:11] working it's not helping so how do you
[56:13] get positive from them things but here
[56:16] the prophet said the word is positive
[56:19] ain't that right now I'm talking to
[56:21] Christians see uh sons of God the word
[56:23] is positive why it cannot change
[56:27] right you cannot change it must stay
[56:31] just the way it's written so then for
[56:35] for a person to have a deposit in
[56:38] meditation to be positive then then it
[56:40] has to draw from the word of God
[56:43] ain't that right and and so we we find
[56:47] that because the word of God is the it's
[56:50] sure it's steadfast everything about us
[56:52] is negative and is uncertain I I think
[56:57] we could all agree with that uh you say
[57:00] you're going to go to work tomorrow but
[57:02] you really don't know what's going to
[57:03] happen tomorrow I mean and things are
[57:05] changing so fast you know I mean and and
[57:07] and you know sometimes even in my life
[57:09] things just constantly going then you
[57:12] then then you start asking what's next
[57:13] right and and maybe that's you you've
[57:16] done it where it rains it pours and I
[57:18] don't care if it's the flat tire I don't
[57:20] care if it's uh you know the the dog or
[57:23] the you know or something going on with
[57:25] the plumbing or whatever and then you
[57:27] just ask what's next you know uh because
[57:29] everything is just changing you know and
[57:32] and it could be that it could be the
[57:33] economy it could be anything I mean the
[57:36] world I mean we we the the moment I say
[57:39] you know I think we've reached to where
[57:41] it can't get more evil and it gets evil
[57:44] so then I'm thinking Okay now what's
[57:46] next you know because because nothing
[57:47] everything's changing so fast
[57:50] and and so everything about us is
[57:53] negative and and it's all going in the
[57:55] negative uh because we're it's it's all
[57:59] sink and sand ain't that rhyme but here
[58:02] and I hope I make a little sense to you
[58:04] tonight but Philippians 2 and 5. Paul
[58:07] said let this mind be in you which was
[58:11] also in Christ Jesus right let this mind
[58:16] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[58:20] First Corinthians 2 16 is Paul says for
[58:25] who hath known the mind of the Lord that
[58:29] he may instruct him but we have
[58:32] everybody say we have the mind of Christ
[58:36] God I think
[58:38] that that means so much to us we have
[58:43] the mind of Christ
[58:45] we have now if you will notice in that
[58:49] uh uh the the previous verses of of
[58:53] second Corinthians 2 or First
[58:55] Corinthians two uh Paul talks about he
[58:58] says I have not seen the natural eye
[59:01] have not seen nor ear heard neither has
[59:05] it entered into the heart of man the
[59:07] things that God not the world not
[59:10] politics
[59:12] God have prepared for them that love him
[59:17] now the world is preparing something
[59:20] different than what God's preparing
[59:23] you believe that God's making
[59:25] preparations on a totally different than
[59:27] what man is is preparing for but what
[59:31] God is preparing for and what he has
[59:33] made the preparations for man cannot
[59:35] comprehend it ain't that right so there
[59:39] it's it's like in in in in in in I I
[59:42] don't know if you're just you're stuck
[59:44] in the mud or you're in a pit as the
[59:47] prophet would call it a say it or or or
[59:49] whatever and your surroundings is that's
[59:53] all you know is your conditions and and
[59:57] so the meditation everything about it is
[1:00:00] just let's just say it it's evil it's
[1:00:03] dark it's you know it's it's hard to
[1:00:06] believe what man comes up with these
[1:00:08] days
[1:00:09] but they're thinking on these things you
[1:00:12] know what I'm saying and and the world
[1:00:14] knows how to promote them things
[1:00:17] Hollywood knows how to promote these
[1:00:20] things to where it's on the children's
[1:00:22] mind constantly right and and they can
[1:00:26] do it through TV they can do it through
[1:00:28] video games they can do it through
[1:00:30] schooling now and and they're projecting
[1:00:33] things in the children's Minds to get
[1:00:36] their minds directed in a certain way
[1:00:39] and they're easily and every everyone is
[1:00:42] falling prey to it because it's dealing
[1:00:45] with carnal Minds
[1:00:48] can you say man and you know where it's
[1:00:50] all coming to education civilization all
[1:00:54] of that is taking the people's minds
[1:00:56] further away from God further away from
[1:00:58] God to where they don't even recognize
[1:01:00] the presence of God they they they well
[1:01:03] brother Branham even said the reason why
[1:01:05] they're doing all the evil is because
[1:01:07] they're not even aware of God's presence
[1:01:09] well something has drawn their minds
[1:01:13] into that direction to where they're not
[1:01:16] thinking of God they've taken the Bible
[1:01:18] out they've taken prayer out they're
[1:01:19] taking everything but what else are they
[1:01:21] promoting they're promoting other
[1:01:22] religions they're promoting other things
[1:01:24] to where you know that God is a god of
[1:01:27] love and he'll accept anybody anyway
[1:01:29] anything uh it don't matter you know so
[1:01:33] so this is the the the the mindset that
[1:01:37] the generation has can you say amen and
[1:01:41] yet it's so far from God but but and and
[1:01:45] and and so we can perceive them things
[1:01:48] because that's a carnal thinking that's
[1:01:52] a carnal mind and so that that same
[1:01:56] we'll put it this way that same carnal
[1:01:59] eye that same natural mind that same
[1:02:02] natural ear that same natural heart or
[1:02:05] whatever you want to call it uh uh
[1:02:08] cannot see the things that God has
[1:02:10] prepared for them
[1:02:12] that love him ain't that right but then
[1:02:15] God rich in Mercy Paul says but God hath
[1:02:20] revealed them to us by what an educator
[1:02:26] by by some student by by some technology
[1:02:31] no but by his spirit
[1:02:34] then you say man so so we we have been
[1:02:37] given now you know then Paul would tell
[1:02:40] us how it takes the spirit of man to
[1:02:42] know the things of man he said so it
[1:02:45] takes the things of God uh the spirit of
[1:02:47] God to know the things of God ain't that
[1:02:51] right and and and so then then Paul
[1:02:54] would tell us but we've not received the
[1:02:57] spirit of the world aren't you glad for
[1:02:59] that we've not received the spirit of
[1:03:01] the world because if you had received
[1:03:03] the spirit of the world how how do you
[1:03:06] meditate upon the the law of God the
[1:03:09] word of God and with the with the spirit
[1:03:12] of the world you know where the spirit
[1:03:15] of the world's leading it's coming up
[1:03:17] with all these things that are so
[1:03:19] contradictory to God do you believe that
[1:03:22] it the spirit of the world is actually
[1:03:24] causing people to you know to identify
[1:03:27] as a cat
[1:03:29] you know the spirit of the world is
[1:03:31] causing people to identify with the same
[1:03:34] genders
[1:03:35] uh the spirit of the world is trying
[1:03:37] it's so mixing the people up that is so
[1:03:40] contrary to this Bible and and and the
[1:03:44] churches aren't having success
[1:03:46] you understand what I'm saying and and
[1:03:49] so because the spirit of man feeds off
[1:03:51] the world but he says we've not received
[1:03:53] the spirit of the world we've received
[1:03:55] the spirit of God I'm so glad for them
[1:03:57] that we might know why would he give you
[1:04:01] the spirit that we might know the things
[1:04:04] that are freely given to us of God ain't
[1:04:08] that rhyme so the spirit of man feeds
[1:04:11] off the world and and of course that's a
[1:04:13] worldly knowledge where the spirit of
[1:04:15] God feeds on the word of God and and the
[1:04:19] pr Paul would go on to say the natural
[1:04:21] man receives not the things of the
[1:04:23] spirit of God for they are foolishness
[1:04:26] unto them unto him ain't that right see
[1:04:30] neither can he know them and I again we
[1:04:34] go back to the ten spies why didn't they
[1:04:36] just take what Moses said to them
[1:04:39] because them words were foolishness to
[1:04:41] them that they were looking at the
[1:04:44] obstacles and saying there ain't no way
[1:04:46] that that word could help us overcome
[1:04:50] so they disregarded what God said they
[1:04:54] disregarded the promises because they
[1:04:57] were serving God from the carnal side of
[1:05:00] things and and and so so is it the way
[1:05:03] the world is today and and this is why
[1:05:06] you don't want we don't want to
[1:05:07] disregard what God has said
[1:05:10] can you say man there's a treasure chest
[1:05:13] in this word
[1:05:14] there there is prospering in this word
[1:05:17] there there's ability to have success in
[1:05:21] your Christian walk in this word
[1:05:25] and so he goes on the natural man
[1:05:28] receives not the things of the spirit of
[1:05:30] God for their foolishness unto him
[1:05:32] neither can he know them because they
[1:05:34] are spiritually discerned ain't that
[1:05:35] right
[1:05:36] so Paul tells us the things of God are
[1:05:39] taught he goes on he says but they're
[1:05:42] not taught in The Words which man's
[1:05:44] Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[1:05:47] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[1:05:50] spiritual oh aren't you glad you got the
[1:05:52] Holy Ghost
[1:05:53] yeah I tell you what what what does it
[1:05:56] do it opens up another world
[1:05:59] it reveals things that you would have
[1:06:01] never been able to comprehend with your
[1:06:04] natural mind
[1:06:05] ain't that right so here now Paul is
[1:06:08] saying we have the mind of Christ we're
[1:06:12] not looking at the word and trying to
[1:06:15] think man what in the world is going on
[1:06:17] we we've got the mind of Christ to come
[1:06:21] and seek with the word of God can you
[1:06:24] say Amen the mind of Christ is opening
[1:06:27] the the revealed Mysteries to us
[1:06:30] eyes and I believe that and and notice
[1:06:34] the mind is what we think with it's the
[1:06:37] intellect and and so the Bible speaks of
[1:06:40] a Godly knowledge uh Revelation and
[1:06:42] things which comes by the mind of God
[1:06:44] ain't that right Revelation uh coming
[1:06:48] it's the mind of God to you and and so
[1:06:51] he's saying we have the mind of Christ
[1:06:53] in other words these things have been
[1:06:54] opened these these things have come to
[1:06:56] us which you we know that Paul was
[1:06:59] actually speaking of our day can you say
[1:07:02] amen and so I believe that in this age
[1:07:05] the mind of God has been given to us
[1:07:09] through the opening of the word ain't
[1:07:12] that right Paul would talk and and a lot
[1:07:15] of times Paul talked in riddles if if
[1:07:16] you don't say that and and it was all
[1:07:19] mystery form and even Paul Peter would
[1:07:22] say these things that are hard to be
[1:07:24] understood but but here God would open
[1:07:28] them up to you and I in in a time that
[1:07:32] that we would need to meditate and the
[1:07:35] time that we don't need the questions in
[1:07:38] the time that we need to be assured as
[1:07:41] to where we stand it's it's in a time
[1:07:44] that that that when when the obstacles
[1:07:47] are before us and Satan is trying to
[1:07:49] throw the questions we we've got to be
[1:07:51] as Christ did and come back with the
[1:07:54] word of God can you say amen and and and
[1:07:58] have it rightly divided unless he's so
[1:08:01] so we know the mighty angel coming down
[1:08:03] with that open book and and we know the
[1:08:06] mighty Angel is Christ and and the
[1:08:08] presence of God is here to anoint the
[1:08:11] word to us do you believe that it's here
[1:08:14] to anoint the word and and so that that
[1:08:18] we we know that the the the angel the
[1:08:21] mighty Angel gave that book to the the
[1:08:24] uh uh seventh angel to give us the true
[1:08:27] interpretation of the word of the book
[1:08:30] ain't that right why was that it was to
[1:08:34] direct our thoughts
[1:08:36] it was to direct our thoughts have you
[1:08:38] ever just you know
[1:08:40] um I I think as I've said this morning
[1:08:43] you know we've had this Bible for years
[1:08:45] and and yet it's only brought forth
[1:08:49] questions and debate and one preaching
[1:08:53] this and one preaching that and one
[1:08:55] preaching his thoughts about it and and
[1:08:57] no doubt they there were good thoughts
[1:09:00] and and they're good intentions and had
[1:09:03] a lot of commentaries and things like
[1:09:05] that but it could never bring us to an
[1:09:08] absolute it good things but it never
[1:09:11] would bring us to an absolute ain't that
[1:09:13] right but then and so how could you be
[1:09:16] positive about that you know you might
[1:09:18] go that direction but still you just uh
[1:09:21] uh something just wasn't you know uh
[1:09:24] fully satisfying amen but then when God
[1:09:28] would send a prophet and vindicate him
[1:09:32] so thoroughly that we could look and and
[1:09:35] when he began to to break the word down
[1:09:37] to us it would open our understanding is
[1:09:43] that not what Jesus did on to the two on
[1:09:45] the way of to Emmaus amen he opened
[1:09:48] their eyes
[1:09:50] the eyes of their understanding was
[1:09:53] opened and I believe that we're sitting
[1:09:55] here tonight A people that has the eyes
[1:09:59] of their understanding opened ain't that
[1:10:01] right so we're not looking and as you
[1:10:05] know think of it after that's the time
[1:10:07] that maybe we would read Joshua and we
[1:10:10] would read even the book of Ephesians or
[1:10:12] we would read whatever and we wouldn't
[1:10:14] know how to place these things we knew
[1:10:16] it being the word of God it was true but
[1:10:19] how do we apply it you know and and
[1:10:22] things that it would take a profit a man
[1:10:24] to open it up to us and to apply it to
[1:10:28] us
[1:10:29] and and again it was to directing our
[1:10:32] thoughts not just reading the Bible a
[1:10:35] year all the way through every year but
[1:10:38] it was to direct our thoughts to where
[1:10:41] we would become a channel
[1:10:47] now uh brother Branham in another place
[1:10:51] that think the right thing
[1:10:53] you got to think the right thing
[1:10:55] come to church think the right thing
[1:10:58] how many people coming to church hearing
[1:10:59] the word but not thinking the right
[1:11:02] thing
[1:11:02] because it ain't directed
[1:11:05] in the right way it's it's it's not with
[1:11:07] true interpretations
[1:11:09] you understand what I'm saying I I and
[1:11:11] when I say think the right thing on uh
[1:11:14] you know uh I know in the natural you
[1:11:16] got to think the right things of this
[1:11:17] but I'm just talking you know that you
[1:11:19] could be sitting in church I mean I'm
[1:11:21] I'm I personally am glad that I'm not
[1:11:24] listening you know I'm not wasn't
[1:11:26] setting under David koresh
[1:11:28] I mean he brought their thoughts to
[1:11:30] something that wasn't the right thing
[1:11:32] Jim Jones brought his followers to
[1:11:35] something that wasn't the right thing
[1:11:36] but when we're hearing a Vindicated
[1:11:39] prophet
[1:11:40] it we can rest assure he's channeling
[1:11:43] our thoughts into the right thing why he
[1:11:48] was taking us over into the Promised
[1:11:50] Land
[1:11:51] can you I hope you understand see and so
[1:11:54] then if we're coming into the promised
[1:11:56] land which I believe that we're there I
[1:11:59] I believe the land is open before us and
[1:12:02] and the way to be successful in the land
[1:12:04] is to think the right thing
[1:12:08] and right and and and and not get our
[1:12:11] minds so clogged up with the world and
[1:12:14] and and with what all this is going on
[1:12:17] you know uh uh our we've been giving an
[1:12:21] understanding that the world knows
[1:12:23] nothing about
[1:12:24] we've been given understanding of the
[1:12:27] things that God has prepared for us how
[1:12:31] many people talk about Rapture and yet
[1:12:33] they don't have the right thing about it
[1:12:35] the interpretation so they're they're
[1:12:37] looking at it but it's not the right
[1:12:39] thing that they're thinking about right
[1:12:41] they're looking at maybe at the
[1:12:43] resurrection we believe in a
[1:12:44] resurrection but but uh you know uh uh
[1:12:47] but it's not the way that that that God
[1:12:50] intended it to be they've got their own
[1:12:52] idea to it so their thoughts a man isn't
[1:12:55] isn't channeled right
[1:12:58] but I believe that God has by his grace
[1:13:01] opened up our minds opened up the
[1:13:04] channels because we are a channel that
[1:13:07] God works through
[1:13:09] do you believe that
[1:13:10] we're a channel that God works through
[1:13:12] and Satan knows that just as well and
[1:13:16] this is why uh he gets our minds in in
[1:13:20] such a so busy in life he gets us so
[1:13:23] busy caught up in and our thoughts are
[1:13:26] are you know just everyday thoughts if
[1:13:29] we're not careful you know we're
[1:13:31] meditating upon other things instead of
[1:13:35] the word of God and so what I want
[1:13:38] tonight to do is just to encourage you a
[1:13:42] man that that
[1:13:44] guard your thoughts
[1:13:46] guard your mind can you say man
[1:13:50] we're the body of Christ and and and and
[1:13:54] and and and these promises the only way
[1:13:58] they can come to reality is the people
[1:14:00] of God
[1:14:02] right you you take any other people that
[1:14:05] would come into the promised land that
[1:14:07] was not part of Israel that that was not
[1:14:10] setting under a prophet Ministry
[1:14:13] that that land meant nothing to them the
[1:14:17] promises that God gave Israel meant
[1:14:19] nothing to to to that other individual
[1:14:22] you understand uh but it was Israel
[1:14:25] sitting under the prophetic message the
[1:14:28] prophetic word that that them promises
[1:14:31] were directed to it that land meant
[1:14:35] something to them and so they weren't
[1:14:38] just coming as a stranger they were
[1:14:40] coming as possessors of that land that
[1:14:45] they weren't coming as squatters they
[1:14:47] they were coming because God had given
[1:14:50] them the promise to possess it
[1:14:53] can you say amen and so God wanted them
[1:14:56] to keep their mind upon the word of God
[1:15:00] don't forget the word don't forget the
[1:15:02] promises don't forget amen these things
[1:15:05] can you say man
[1:15:07] so we we find that we're a channel and
[1:15:10] and the meditation of the world is so
[1:15:13] far different than that of the
[1:15:16] Spirit-filled believer there is a lot
[1:15:19] said in the Bible about meditation on
[1:15:22] the word and and
[1:15:25] um we read there in Joshua but Psalm 63
[1:15:29] and 5 David says my soul shall be
[1:15:33] satisfied as with moral and fatness and
[1:15:37] my mouth shall praise thee with joyful
[1:15:40] lips what a difference now do you
[1:15:43] believe that that scripture still is
[1:15:45] applicable to us today
[1:15:47] I believe it is but what a difference it
[1:15:50] that scripture is compared to the
[1:15:52] negativity that is around us today
[1:15:57] a world they are so negative in their
[1:16:00] thinking they're talking they're you
[1:16:02] know and and if we're not careful that
[1:16:04] Spirit tries to anoint us to where we
[1:16:08] talk negative we we think negative we
[1:16:11] our lives are negative everything about
[1:16:13] us is negative and we don't want to be
[1:16:16] negative
[1:16:17] you understand what I'm saying and and
[1:16:20] and and and so uh uh we we find here my
[1:16:24] soul shall be satisfied as with moral
[1:16:28] and fatness and my mouth shall praise
[1:16:31] thee with joyful lips
[1:16:34] not just when I'm on the Mountaintop
[1:16:36] every day this is the pattern ain't that
[1:16:40] rhyme a man win and notice what he says
[1:16:43] everybody say when so so this this my
[1:16:46] soul being satisfied is a result of
[1:16:49] something and and and my mouth praising
[1:16:52] thee with joyful lips is a result when I
[1:16:56] remember thee upon my bed and meditate
[1:17:00] on thee in the night watches ain't that
[1:17:03] right there's a reaction that comes with
[1:17:06] meditating upon the Lord
[1:17:11] Psalms 119 148 mine eyes prevent the
[1:17:15] night watches that I might meditate in
[1:17:20] Thy Word
[1:17:22] Psalms 119 78 let the proud be ashamed
[1:17:26] for they dealt perversely with me
[1:17:29] without calls but I will meditate in thy
[1:17:34] precepts and there's more scriptures
[1:17:35] amen that talk about meditation there is
[1:17:39] a reason that we are to meditate upon
[1:17:43] the word of God
[1:17:45] then you say amen and it was at that
[1:17:49] time in our opening scripture that right
[1:17:52] when they were coming into the promises
[1:17:54] God would tell him you must you must
[1:17:57] meditate upon this law and the words
[1:18:00] must not depart out of thy mouth
[1:18:03] and you say man and what are words from
[1:18:05] thoughts
[1:18:08] words is an expression of thought
[1:18:11] so when her mind is meditating upon the
[1:18:13] word when her mind is meditating upon up
[1:18:16] on the the promises of God it fills our
[1:18:21] mouth
[1:18:23] praise the Lord that's right amen
[1:18:26] do you love him
[1:18:27] amen if the musicians will come
[1:18:32] I love the Lord
[1:18:37] I think of the word the word of God
[1:18:40] meditating upon the word
[1:18:42] of course the word of God is our light
[1:18:44] the Bible says that Thy Word
[1:18:48] is a light
[1:18:51] when the doctors shuts off all hope
[1:18:56] of living
[1:18:59] or or always being you know whatever or
[1:19:05] the word gives us light
[1:19:08] to see something different
[1:19:12] when the Gloom is all around which it is
[1:19:18] the word of God is our light for us to
[1:19:21] see beyond it
[1:19:25] when there's no hope
[1:19:27] and the world ain't providing the
[1:19:29] answers the word of God is our light
[1:19:33] to where we can see the answer
[1:19:36] ain't that right
[1:19:38] the world the world there there's
[1:19:40] there's you know as Paul would say if I
[1:19:43] had hope in this life
[1:19:45] only I'd be of all men most miserable
[1:19:49] we have the tribulation
[1:19:51] coming upon the Earth the wrath of God
[1:19:55] the plagues and men's hearts in this age
[1:19:59] are failing them for fear looking after
[1:20:02] those things which are coming
[1:20:04] could you imagine being in that state
[1:20:09] and yet the word of God is our light
[1:20:15] that gives us
[1:20:16] [Music]
[1:20:17] something that we can see that's
[1:20:19] different for us
[1:20:21] I'm so glad for that I'm so glad we need
[1:20:23] we had a prophet that tell us these
[1:20:25] things
[1:20:27] that you will not the church will not go
[1:20:29] through tribulation
[1:20:31] the church will not face the the evils
[1:20:35] and the things
[1:20:37] it it will not Prevail upon the church
[1:20:40] can you say Amen and that word is our
[1:20:44] light
[1:20:45] [Music]
[1:20:46] the word when when you you feel unworthy
[1:20:51] and you feel like you've you've messed
[1:20:53] up and you feel like you know you've
[1:20:57] crossed that line and yet we've had a
[1:21:00] word to come to us
[1:21:02] and tell us that a Christian cannot
[1:21:04] blaspheme the Holy Ghost we've had a
[1:21:07] word that comes and tells us you are
[1:21:10] Justified as though you've never done it
[1:21:12] you are spotless you are the The
[1:21:14] Virtuous spotless bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:18] do you realize that is a light to us
[1:21:22] that that word is a light that that when
[1:21:25] these things that of gloom and doom and
[1:21:29] and and all the things that Satan is
[1:21:31] putting in there Amen to try to cover us
[1:21:34] up that word would give us light beyond
[1:21:37] all of that to we we could see a way out
[1:21:40] that we see us a way of Escape we we we
[1:21:43] can see ourselves a man above the clouds
[1:21:47] ain't that right amen and and so this is
[1:21:51] why it's important to meditate upon the
[1:21:53] word of God
[1:21:55] you meditation is so important and I'd
[1:21:58] like to get into that more but because
[1:22:01] the word of God gives us light to see
[1:22:05] can you say man it's positive
[1:22:09] there's nothing negative in Christianity
[1:22:11] it's all positive
[1:22:14] ain't that right so so the mind of God
[1:22:17] gives us a positive thinking
[1:22:20] I'm talking World positive thinking the
[1:22:23] way the world deals with that
[1:22:26] so the word of God is a light that makes
[1:22:30] the promises of God to shine
[1:22:33] to where we see something different than
[1:22:36] what the average guy sees
[1:22:39] can you say Amen
[1:22:41] I don't know about you that I hope I
[1:22:44] hope you can see something different
[1:22:48] people are trying to commit suicide
[1:22:51] trying to end their lives
[1:22:54] lean into all kinds of things
[1:22:57] you realize the millions of people that
[1:23:00] live life
[1:23:01] feeling hopeless
[1:23:04] but here God has given you a mind
[1:23:09] God has given you his life
[1:23:12] [Music]
[1:23:13] not trying to imagine the magically
[1:23:16] thinking something up
[1:23:19] but it's it's it's it's a true thing
[1:23:21] that cannot change
[1:23:25] you know this word is a love letter to
[1:23:27] you
[1:23:29] it's a love letter
[1:23:31] if you view it any other way
[1:23:34] you're missing the point
[1:23:37] because brother Brown said it's a love
[1:23:38] letter
[1:23:40] and when we can see it that way it's our
[1:23:42] life that we can see the love of God
[1:23:45] to us
[1:23:47] we can see the promises to us
[1:23:50] we can see that he's prepared heaven for
[1:23:53] me
[1:23:54] we can see that he's staged he's
[1:23:57] prepared the rapture he has sent down
[1:24:00] his power quickening power for me
[1:24:03] so he can't lead me in this world the
[1:24:05] way it is
[1:24:06] he can't lead me to where I go in the
[1:24:09] tribulation
[1:24:10] he's made a way of Escape
[1:24:13] I think we have something positive to
[1:24:17] meditate upon
[1:24:19] you believe that
[1:24:21] you've got something positive
[1:24:24] because if you meditate upon anything
[1:24:25] else
[1:24:28] you'll just hold your head down the rest
[1:24:30] of your life
[1:24:31] you always live in Wonder you'll always
[1:24:34] live in defeat you'll always live
[1:24:36] wondering can I can I overcome it can I
[1:24:39] you know is it possible is it can I
[1:24:43] really make it can I really be that am I
[1:24:46] I don't know let's settle the questions
[1:24:49] the word of God is settled forever
[1:24:53] meditate upon it don't give the devil a
[1:24:56] chance
[1:24:57] to fill you up with questions
[1:25:01] that are meaningless to where you get to
[1:25:04] wander in who you really are it's time
[1:25:07] to know who we are
[1:25:09] whether you feel it
[1:25:12] or not
[1:25:16] it's a positive source
[1:25:19] because the word doesn't change with you
[1:25:24] the word doesn't change
[1:25:28] I don't know who it was that I was
[1:25:30] listening to but
[1:25:32] someone
[1:25:33] may remember who it was and
[1:25:35] I just heard it the other day how I said
[1:25:38] God starts backwards
[1:25:40] man starts forward it begins to work
[1:25:43] something up but God starts backwards
[1:25:47] and I thought man that's that's pretty
[1:25:49] powerful
[1:25:52] because he would choose you
[1:25:55] glorify you
[1:25:58] justify you
[1:26:01] before you ever came
[1:26:04] so now he's working to what he's already
[1:26:07] done
[1:26:10] it's bringing you to the place that he's
[1:26:13] already accomplished
[1:26:15] I thought that's pretty good meditate
[1:26:19] think on them things
[1:26:20] can you say man oh my
[1:26:24] God's called us to be prosperous in him
[1:26:27] amen what song
[1:26:31] if you're mine
[1:26:35] [Music]

[1:29:31] [Music]
[1:29:47] [Music]
[1:29:56] power hits foreign
[1:30:08] just how important it is to think the
[1:30:12] right things
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:17] we see Lord that
[1:30:21] you're not going to come and just wave a
[1:30:24] magic wand over us and then we go home
[1:30:29] but Lord we're stepping into this
[1:30:33] coming to this
[1:30:37] because the word is taken preeminence in
[1:30:41] our heart and our minds
[1:30:45] and I pray Lord that you would give us
[1:30:47] all that Grace to
[1:30:51] not look at the negative not sink on the
[1:30:54] negative
[1:30:56] and everything in this world's negative
[1:31:01] but Lord may we meditate upon the word
[1:31:05] you you so graciously have given it to
[1:31:09] us
[1:31:10] not just for head knowledge but just to
[1:31:13] meditate and let it drop down into our
[1:31:17] soul
[1:31:20] and let it control us
[1:31:23] and I pray Lord that
[1:31:27] the word becomes a reality to every one
[1:31:30] of us here
[1:31:31] may we not look at it as though it's
[1:31:34] something we can obtain
[1:31:36] for there's no way we can attain it in
[1:31:39] the human effort
[1:31:42] Lord you've given us the channel and
[1:31:45] that's our mind to sink on it
[1:31:47] to meditate upon it
[1:31:49] and as we meditate upon you as we talk
[1:31:53] of you as we think of you
[1:31:56] you come on the scene
[1:31:58] oh that's what we want to be as a people
[1:32:01] Lord that is not sidetracked
[1:32:04] not double-minded Lord
[1:32:08] the Lord May our thinking have
[1:32:10] Foundation to it
[1:32:13] everything that is negative comes from
[1:32:15] the Devil
[1:32:18] he gets us to make mistakes so he can
[1:32:21] tell us
[1:32:23] that we're not seen
[1:32:26] it gets us Lord to thinking of things or
[1:32:29] doing things falling or whatever in
[1:32:33] traps so he can
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:37] his thoughts his voice becomes more
[1:32:39] pronounced
[1:32:41] foreign
[1:32:43] there's nothing solid about him
[1:32:46] he's a liar
[1:32:49] it may be Lord there might be those that
[1:32:52] hear whether it be a young person that
[1:32:54] are just meditating upon them thoughts
[1:32:57] of worthlessness and
[1:32:59] failures and I'm a nobody
[1:33:03] or may they see that them thoughts come
[1:33:06] from the Devil
[1:33:09] but Lord there is a provided source and
[1:33:13] that's your word that has been open to
[1:33:15] us
[1:33:17] and father may we
[1:33:22] discipline ourselves if I could say it
[1:33:25] that way Lord that to where we think
[1:33:29] upon you
[1:33:30] we get in your word we pray we commune
[1:33:34] with you
[1:33:36] that's more valuable than anything we
[1:33:38] can do upon this Earth
[1:33:41] father we love you we thank you for what
[1:33:44] you've done for us in this day

[1:41:29] travel
[1:41:30] and Lord Willem will be back Saturday
[1:41:33] evening so it's really going to be a
[1:41:35] fast trip and but looking forward to the
[1:41:39] fellowship and
[1:41:42] getting that and uh
[1:41:46] anyways got a lot of folks excited about
[1:41:49] the meeting and I'm excited about it and
[1:41:52] I'm just believing God to do something
[1:41:54] great
[1:41:55] and I'm glad that we're part of it I'm
[1:41:58] just glad we're a part of it uh yeah
[1:41:59] we're a small church but I'm glad we're
[1:42:01] part of it
[1:42:02] maybe a lot of work and but I see
[1:42:05] benefit in it and I see something that
[1:42:07] God is doing and and God has blessed it
[1:42:10] that's all I can say so it's definitely
[1:42:13] been beyond our Humanity uh uh our you
[1:42:17] know things it's just been a
[1:42:19] supernatural
[1:42:20] uh saying and I get so many uh
[1:42:24] testimonies from it and the healings and
[1:42:28] just heard the other day that brother
[1:42:31] had been looking you know just
[1:42:34] seeking for the Holy Ghost been you know
[1:42:36] and and God filled him uh with the Holy
[1:42:40] Ghost and one of the services and so to
[1:42:43] me that that's worth it there and uh
[1:42:47] just one soul to the Lord so all of our
[1:42:49] efforts every every effort that you put
[1:42:51] that we put it's it's not in vain and I
[1:42:56] believe God Smiles on us I just believe
[1:42:59] that
[1:43:00] it's something that
[1:43:03] would you see God moving in and and the
[1:43:06] people tell me all the time around they
[1:43:07] say these are the best being we've ever
[1:43:09] been you guys just
[1:43:11] uh you know and they come looking for
[1:43:14] answers they come looking for
[1:43:16] deliverances and and and God meets them
[1:43:20] and and I'm so glad for that I think I
[1:43:22] told you about the uh the the Mexican
[1:43:25] brother Hispanic brother that you know
[1:43:28] um
[1:43:29] they'd come with whatever he needed I
[1:43:32] think needed healing or whatever and his
[1:43:34] wife needed things and in her life and
[1:43:37] so she came to the prayer line he set
[1:43:39] back and watching the children so she
[1:43:42] could go and as he's just reverent and
[1:43:45] praying God came by his way didn't even
[1:43:47] go through the prayer line but God came
[1:43:49] by his way and healed him touched him
[1:43:51] and I just think that's just uh uh thank
[1:43:55] the Lord for that
[1:43:56] and so uh anyways uh the tent is about
[1:44:02] paid off and so we thank the Lord for
[1:44:04] that and and so looking forward to a
[1:44:07] great time
[1:44:09] amen so keep us in prayer uh because
[1:44:12] we're leaving out early I think at six
