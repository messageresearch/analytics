[40:49] ask are you able to drink of the cup
[40:52] that I shall drink of and to be baptized
[40:55] with the baptism that I am I am baptized
[40:57] with and they said unto him we are
[41:00] able and he saith unto them you shall
[41:03] drink and eat of my cup and be baptized
[41:05] with the baptism that I am baptized with
[41:08] but to sit on my right hand and on my
[41:11] left is not mine to give but it shall be
[41:15] given to them for whom it is prepared of
[41:18] my
[41:20] father and when the 10 heard it they
[41:23] were moved with indignation against the
[41:26] two Brethren but Jesus called them unto
[41:29] him and said you know that the princes
[41:33] of the Gentiles exercise dominion over
[41:36] them and they that are great exercise
[41:40] Authority upon them but it shall not be
[41:43] so among you but whosoever will be great
[41:47] among you let him be your
[41:50] minister and whosoever shall be Chief
[41:53] among you let him be your
[41:55] servant even as the son of man came not
[41:58] to be ministered unto but to minister
[42:00] and to give his life a ransom for many
[42:05] amen you can have your seats this
[42:10] morning
[42:14] and going to Endeavor just to continue
[42:17] on from last Sunday and I guess if I use
[42:22] a title it' just be the son of man came
[42:24] to minister
[42:26] and um hopefully just
[42:30] to make sense to you and and um just
[42:35] like to just share from my heart but um
[42:40] we we know that there there are so many
[42:42] people that need the
[42:44] Lord amen I think we could all agree to
[42:47] that and not only um on the outside of
[42:54] the church but I think there are many
[42:57] needs here that are present and I I
[43:00] think um um you know as long as we live
[43:06] in this life we're always going to have
[43:08] needs always going to have things and
[43:11] and um but I would like to maybe deal
[43:17] with the needs outside the church here
[43:22] and um talk or talk about that type of a
[43:25] need but for years uh now people have
[43:29] known of the Lord uh we we've it's been
[43:34] talked about preached about sung about
[43:37] and these things but it's they've known
[43:39] him from a theological
[43:42] standpoint and uh but it's it's not
[43:46] seemingly helping the people and um
[43:50] we've got churches on every corner it
[43:52] seems uh more churches and more books
[43:57] that are written more things uh to help
[44:01] people but seems like the people aren't
[44:03] being helped it it just seems like the
[44:07] um uh more evil more needs more more
[44:12] things like that and I I really believe
[44:16] that the people need to see God in
[44:19] action and they need to experience him
[44:22] in a special way today we are dealing
[44:26] with all manners of sickness and and
[44:29] it's it's not just physical sickness
[44:32] even though that seems to be more
[44:36] prevalent than ever before is is
[44:38] physical sickness but we're dealing with
[44:41] people that have mental sickness as well
[44:44] and it's it's a lot of mental sickness
[44:47] um and brother brandom even talked about
[44:49] it that people are just going insane and
[44:51] so then it it it's the mind is being
[44:55] attacked and and but then there's a
[44:58] greater sickness than even that and
[44:59] that's the sickness of the Soul it's a
[45:02] spiritual
[45:03] sickness and for centuries man has tried
[45:07] to help those that are in need it just
[45:10] seems to be man putting that
[45:13] responsibility upon themselves to to
[45:16] help those and so we've uh we have built
[45:21] hospitals uh to help those that that are
[45:24] in need uh there's been San asylums that
[45:28] have been built uh to help those in need
[45:32] there's been charity organizations
[45:34] there's been food banks there's there's
[45:37] been uh all kinds of programs um that
[45:41] have been established to to help uh um
[45:45] uh to help those that are in need and
[45:47] and to Target different areas in an
[45:50] individual's life or whatever then we
[45:53] find that man has built Bible schools
[45:56] seminaries and things like that to uh uh
[46:01] help ministers be able to to preach
[46:04] better and to enable them to help uh and
[46:08] be more effective to the people uh we
[46:11] we've we've gotten now marriage seminars
[46:14] that have been pretty prominent
[46:16] Financial seminars and and and they seem
[46:19] to be in a real high demand uh today
[46:23] because of of the need that is great
[46:26] and but but there's never been a lack of
[46:29] human effort uh put forth to help those
[46:33] in need in some way or another and and
[46:36] all of these are Ministries in their own
[46:39] way we've got drug programs to help uh
[46:43] the drug addict you know we've got uh
[46:46] alcoholic programs uh to help the
[46:49] alcoholics and and things like that but
[46:52] when it's all said and done it's it's
[46:55] it's
[46:56] Humanity trying to cure Humanity from
[47:00] their problems and and help humanity and
[47:04] it's in a in a carnal way does God use
[47:08] doctors yes he he does and we certainly
[47:11] don't condemn doctors but we know the
[47:14] doctor cannot heal and and we know that
[47:18] that no matter what the doctor does and
[47:20] how much training he has he's Limited in
[47:24] in uh in what he can do uh he can cut
[47:28] out the the appendix or cut out the the
[47:32] um you know the gallbladder he can he he
[47:35] can do whatever he he wants to I
[47:37] actually just read where uh uh they
[47:40] formed performed the first surgery on an
[47:43] eye of replacing the eyeball and they're
[47:47] they're becoming pretty smart in in
[47:50] their technology of what they can do but
[47:52] in all reality it takes God to do the
[47:55] healing
[47:56] a dentist can take out a tooth but it
[47:58] takes God to to heal that that area and
[48:03] and so the Bible says you know in Psalms
[48:06] 103 and2 bless the Lord oh my soul
[48:10] forget not all his benefits who
[48:12] forgiveth all thy diseases who health or
[48:15] forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[48:17] Health all thy
[48:19] diseases reading the prophet he says
[48:21] that God heals by medicine God heals by
[48:24] music God heals by love God heals by
[48:29] care God heals by Miracles God heals by
[48:34] understanding God heals by prayer and
[48:38] and and so he says God has many ways of
[48:41] healing it just depends on what type uh
[48:45] uh you need see sometimes a little love
[48:49] stretched out will cure an old SAR an
[48:52] old place that's been a grudge or
[48:54] something it'll heal he'll right he heal
[48:56] it right over Just a Little Love a
[48:58] Little care sometimes when you feel all
[49:01] down and as we call it a street
[49:04] expression down in the dumps we we just
[49:08] put on one of those tapes that of music
[49:10] and or record or and just go to playing
[49:13] it and the first thing you know you're
[49:15] patting your foot or your hand and then
[49:18] it's all over then see you're right up
[49:20] and ready to go again so see God heals
[49:23] in so many different ways
[49:26] amen uh but and and and and not every
[49:30] doctor is a holy ghost filled Christian
[49:33] not every musician that plays gospel
[49:35] songs uh is is a holy ghost filled uh
[49:39] believer not every singer that sings
[49:42] gospel songs is Holy Ghost filled not
[49:45] every person that displays love and
[49:48] compassion is Holy Ghost fi amen uh uh
[49:53] and and of course what what they're
[49:55] doing is in the human realm you know
[49:58] just as a person um uh that's not Holy
[50:02] Ghost filled they can display love and
[50:04] care and compassion and yet it's it's
[50:08] only a human care it's a human
[50:10] compassion a human love and and yet
[50:13] people are helped by that um uh people
[50:16] are helped um there's there's uh many
[50:20] organizations and charity functions and
[50:24] things like that that that help people
[50:27] and yet it's only in a natural way um uh
[50:31] that is has been help and so uh people
[50:35] can have understanding toward another
[50:37] person's need and not even have the Holy
[50:39] Ghost and that's because they've been
[50:42] down that path um there's women that
[50:45] have been molested or raped or whatever
[50:48] that they they have devoted their time
[50:50] to help other women that have been in
[50:53] that same situation well they understand
[50:55] understand what them people have gone
[50:57] through and and so they're doing
[50:59] everything they can uh in a human way to
[51:03] to help and and and and there's been
[51:06] many that have been helped uh uh in in
[51:09] these in these ways and and so uh but
[51:13] when it's all said and done people need
[51:17] the Lord do you believe that people need
[51:21] the Lord um it's you know we can help
[51:24] people in in in many ways uh uh we can
[51:29] give food to the poor we can uh give
[51:32] clothes to those that need clothes we
[51:34] can give money to those that need money
[51:36] and and all these things but where what
[51:40] a what does it Avail them if their
[51:43] destination isn't isn't to meet the Lord
[51:46] or to be with the Lord if if we're not
[51:49] helping them in that way so there are
[51:52] all kinds of Ministries established
[51:54] through human compassion in human love
[51:56] and yet never never leading people to
[52:00] Christ there are Christian Ministries uh
[52:04] that that are effective today in so many
[52:08] ways and yet they deny uh the
[52:12] manifestation of Jesus Christ today they
[52:15] may be able to help some people
[52:17] physically or emotionally and mentally
[52:20] but they've not been able to help the
[52:23] soul of man the of
[52:26] man and and so as I was saying last
[52:29] Sunday that Jesus's
[52:33] Ministry uh wasn't about building
[52:35] hospitals or establishing charity
[52:39] organizations it wasn't about giving
[52:41] money to the poor even though he could
[52:43] have done it it wasn't about um building
[52:46] homes for people that that um uh were
[52:50] homeless even though he could have done
[52:52] it he he that he was just God ain't that
[52:55] right
[52:55] but it it wasn't his ministry wasn't
[52:59] about uh uh bringing reform to people
[53:03] and and helping them in in in them them
[53:06] types of ways and and yet he he could
[53:09] have done it uh uh and so but he his
[53:14] ministry was a Ministry that operated
[53:17] outside the medical field or outside the
[53:20] scientific field and and these things it
[53:23] was a Ministry of Deliverance
[53:25] do you believe that it was a Ministry of
[53:29] Healing The Sick without medical uh
[53:32] without without medical uh whatever and
[53:35] and casting out Devils it was a Ministry
[53:38] of power it was a Ministry of binding up
[53:41] the wounds and of people and healing the
[53:45] Brokenhearted it was a Ministry that
[53:47] took authority over the devil and and
[53:51] and and there wasn't a devil around that
[53:54] could stay in the presence of God when
[53:58] Jesus commanded him to leave ain't that
[54:00] right and and and we're we're we're in a
[54:04] in a in a place that that I I believe
[54:07] we're we're at a place that all these
[54:09] man-made programs are are totally come
[54:13] uh as limited they're finding their
[54:15] limitations because we're we're really
[54:18] facing spiritual
[54:20] warfare uh more than ever in in humanity
[54:25] and and I I thought of just even the the
[54:28] man of gy of of being possessed of them
[54:33] all th you know 2,000 I think or
[54:35] whatever devils and and no doctor could
[54:39] have helped him no psychologist could
[54:41] have helped him there there was nothing
[54:43] that could reform him but there was one
[54:46] that had a Ministry that could deliver
[54:48] that man and and and only one that could
[54:52] have done that and and so that was the
[54:54] type of Ministry that Jesus had see and
[54:58] so uh uh but but there was no devil that
[55:01] could stay around that's that's how the
[55:03] the blind Could See Without operations
[55:07] being being performed that's that's how
[55:10] the deaf could hear the lame could walk
[55:13] without having uh therapy and and these
[55:16] things the dead were raised to life the
[55:19] people's sins were forgiven them they uh
[55:22] the people received eternal life and and
[55:25] so Jesus had a Ministry like no other it
[55:29] it was a Ministry that was so profound
[55:31] and yet it was a Supernatural Ministry
[55:34] very and and a humble Ministry ain't
[55:36] that right and and so even the natural
[55:39] Church uh did not have such a ministry
[55:43] as as his uh for it wasn't a man-made
[55:47] Ministry and and operating within the
[55:50] realm of human element amen and and even
[55:55] Nicodemus who was a
[55:57] Pharisee uh said to Jesus in John 3:2
[56:01] says no man can do these Miracles that
[56:04] thou doest except God be with him
[56:07] another place they they marveled at at
[56:09] his words that he spoke because he spake
[56:12] as a man having
[56:15] Authority amen there was just something
[56:17] about him that that was different and
[56:21] and and so uh uh you know before Jesus
[56:25] started his public Ministry we know that
[56:28] he went and and to to the prophet John
[56:32] and and he was baptized and and when he
[56:36] come up out of the water John saw the
[56:38] spirit of God uh descending uh from
[56:42] heaven like unto a dove and it it It
[56:46] Came Upon Jesus and and of course that
[56:49] the prophet said that's when God and man
[56:52] became one heaven and Earth United
[56:57] together amen was was at that time and
[57:01] and uh they they embraced together and
[57:04] and the prophet said God came down from
[57:06] the spirit form and was made a man and
[57:10] dwelt among us see God became man ain't
[57:15] that right amen Jesus would have never
[57:18] had the ministry that he had except God
[57:21] United with him can you say Amen for
[57:25] Jesus was the human Tabernacle of God do
[57:28] you believe that amen see and so um uh
[57:33] uh the the the whole church and this is
[57:36] the the thing that I see is that as all
[57:39] the programs that we have uh out in the
[57:42] world and and even the church the the
[57:45] one thing they've rejected is the spirit
[57:48] of God they've rejected the very thing
[57:51] that would give them power Amen to
[57:54] really be effective to that that that
[57:57] humanity and and so so but but when when
[58:01] uh Jesus had the nature of a lamb and so
[58:05] the dove could could could land uh and
[58:08] Unite with such a spirit as that and so
[58:14] uh if there's ever a time we need his
[58:16] Spirit we need it now uh uh
[58:21] because just to be honest we're required
[58:23] to have that type of a Ministry that
[58:26] Jesus had in this day do you believe
[58:29] that amen see and so um but then if you
[58:33] notice what happened after that was in
[58:37] Matthew 17 And1 it says and after Jesus
[58:41] uh after six days uh Jesus taketh Peter
[58:45] uh James and John uh his brother and
[58:49] bringeth them uh up into an high
[58:51] mountain apart and was transfigured
[58:54] before them and his face did shine as
[58:56] the sun and his reignment was white as
[58:58] the light and behold there appeared unto
[59:01] them Moses and Elias talking with him
[59:04] and then answered Peter and said unto
[59:07] Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here
[59:10] if thou Wilt let us make here three
[59:12] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[59:15] one for Elias and while he SP yet spake
[59:18] Behold a bright Cloud overshadow them
[59:21] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[59:24] which said this is my beloved Son in
[59:27] whom I am well pleased uh uh or pleased
[59:31] to dwell in hear ye him ain't that right
[59:36] so now God is is is is approving and
[59:40] showing there's only one voice amen that
[59:43] they are to listen to and that is Christ
[59:45] ain't that right amen and when they the
[59:48] disciples heard it they fell on their
[59:50] face and were so afraid and Jesus came
[59:53] and touched them and said rise Be not
[59:55] Afraid and when they lifted up their
[59:57] eyes they saw no man they saw no
[1:00:00] organization they saw nothing else just
[1:00:04] Jesus only ain't that right and and what
[1:00:07] is significant about this is that this
[1:00:11] was the time that Jesus was adopted this
[1:00:14] was the father adopting his son amen
[1:00:18] that's what a prophet says ain't that
[1:00:20] right I know some people don't believe
[1:00:21] that but it's true if a prophet said it
[1:00:24] I believe it amen you see and so now
[1:00:27] notice what the prophet said Jesus
[1:00:29] walked as an ordinary man uh but one day
[1:00:33] upon Mount Transfiguration he had taken
[1:00:36] three as a witness Peter James John hope
[1:00:38] faith and charity called them out and he
[1:00:41] separated Jesus from them and
[1:00:44] overshadowed the him he overshadowed him
[1:00:48] and the Bible says his reignment Shine
[1:00:50] Like the Sun in its strength what was it
[1:00:54] that special robe God adopting his own
[1:00:59] son ain't that right and and we know if
[1:01:03] if you've not really uh or been a while
[1:01:06] since you've listened to it you ought to
[1:01:07] go back and listen to the adoption
[1:01:09] series or even even the messages several
[1:01:13] messages maybe 12 of them on hear ye him
[1:01:16] and uh uh the these things and and and
[1:01:20] the prophet talks about the adoption of
[1:01:22] how that in the Bible the you know the
[1:01:25] the the uh the when a son was adopted of
[1:01:29] the father he then came into full
[1:01:32] possession of everything and so this is
[1:01:36] exactly what happened Jesus was adopted
[1:01:39] and the prophet said no wonder Jesus
[1:01:42] could say all power in heaven and in
[1:01:44] Earth is now given unto me ain't that
[1:01:48] right now you could just imagine the
[1:01:50] devil's trembling at that moment and and
[1:01:53] the things uh because because there was
[1:01:55] a son that had come to an adoption amen
[1:01:59] and what is it when the son is adopted
[1:02:02] his name everybody say his name is as
[1:02:05] good on the check as the father's name
[1:02:09] ain't that right see and so uh because
[1:02:13] the prophet said he's no longer under a
[1:02:15] tutor but he's now like his father he's
[1:02:19] got the authority of his father his word
[1:02:23] goes just as the father's word goes amen
[1:02:26] what he says everybody has to come under
[1:02:29] subjection to that because he's been
[1:02:32] lifted up into a position of authority
[1:02:35] he's no longer under tutors and
[1:02:37] governors he's no longer like a servant
[1:02:40] now he tells the servant what to do he's
[1:02:43] the one that commands his word now has
[1:02:46] power ain't that right amen see well
[1:02:49] that that's the thing see and and and so
[1:02:52] um uh brother BR said said no wonder
[1:02:54] Jesus could say all powers in Heaven and
[1:02:57] Earth is given into my hand for he was
[1:02:59] adopted by his father into the Glorious
[1:03:03] Kingdom and is now sitting in the
[1:03:05] Majesty at the right hand above every
[1:03:07] Archangel and Angel every Star moon or
[1:03:11] every name that's named in heaven it's
[1:03:13] subject to the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:03:15] he was adopted by God the Father ain't
[1:03:18] that right well what was it Jesus was
[1:03:21] one with the father do you believe that
[1:03:25] Jesus was one with the Father the Bible
[1:03:28] even says it that that he done only what
[1:03:31] the father showed him that's what Jesus
[1:03:33] said I can do nothing but what the
[1:03:34] father first showed me he was one with
[1:03:37] the father he said my meat is to do the
[1:03:40] father's will he was so in line with the
[1:03:45] the father he was so in harmony with the
[1:03:48] father everything was about the father's
[1:03:51] business what the father did what the
[1:03:53] father wanted
[1:03:54] amen what the father asked so he was one
[1:03:58] with the word for the word is God and
[1:04:00] the word became flesh ain't that right
[1:04:03] God was able to find a a a a a a body
[1:04:07] that would accept him amen and and and
[1:04:11] the fullness of him ain't that right
[1:04:13] amen see so he had the same motive as
[1:04:16] the father the same heartbeat the same
[1:04:18] love amen the same expression that the
[1:04:22] father's desire was his desire desire
[1:04:24] the the father's care was his care amen
[1:04:28] see and so uh even Jesus would tell the
[1:04:32] uh people it's not me that doeth the
[1:04:34] works but it's the father within me
[1:04:36] that's doing the works he was so yielded
[1:04:40] to the father that the father could
[1:04:42] express himself through the son can you
[1:04:46] say Amen see and so uh uh now we know
[1:04:50] amen that the the ministry that Jesus
[1:04:53] had
[1:04:55] is the same Ministry that his bride has
[1:04:59] today amen see uh uh we appreciate all
[1:05:04] kinds of the Ministries we appreciate
[1:05:06] what people are trying to do to help
[1:05:08] humanity and and the kindheartedness and
[1:05:12] and all of these things that there but
[1:05:14] but even then as I said last Sunday
[1:05:16] people are losing their their their
[1:05:19] their their love for people they're
[1:05:21] losing their passion they're losing and
[1:05:23] it's a self-centered thing building
[1:05:26] their own reputations of what they've
[1:05:28] done and what they do worried about a
[1:05:30] career it's more about money than it is
[1:05:32] about helping the people amen you can
[1:05:35] get doctors and nurses and they can be
[1:05:37] just as rude and and and and uh
[1:05:40] inconsiderate and and all of these
[1:05:42] things uh lawyers are supposed to be
[1:05:45] working for the people and they become
[1:05:47] more uh selfish and in indulgent about
[1:05:50] money it's about career it's about Fame
[1:05:52] it's about Fortune it's about
[1:05:54] luxury and and all of these things ain't
[1:05:57] that right see but but but there is a
[1:06:00] Ministry and the prophet said that there
[1:06:02] there come a time in that that there
[1:06:04] will be only love that'll be found in
[1:06:06] the elect and that's it love in the
[1:06:08] elect see and and so uh uh so so this
[1:06:13] ministry amen now a man can only be a
[1:06:16] part of the body of Christ amen uh by
[1:06:19] having the Holy Ghost ain't that right
[1:06:22] amen and and and uh uh uh if you haven't
[1:06:25] had the Holy Ghost you need the Holy
[1:06:27] Ghost amen that that's just the given
[1:06:29] you you you you can never operate in the
[1:06:33] ministry as as you yeah you you can feed
[1:06:36] the poor you can do the human element
[1:06:38] like everybody else does and and you can
[1:06:41] do that and you can attend church you
[1:06:42] can be a good citizen you can you can be
[1:06:45] all these things and but but yet brother
[1:06:46] brandom says but that's a moral thing
[1:06:48] that's that's moral principle that's
[1:06:51] just moral things amen but but to to
[1:06:54] really come into the ministry of the son
[1:06:57] of man uh uh well you you've got to be
[1:07:01] born again but also we're looking and
[1:07:04] we're seeing by the message of the hour
[1:07:07] that we are in the season of adoption
[1:07:10] amen and he says God has just began to
[1:07:13] my humble opinion to adopting his son
[1:07:17] positionally calling him out to one side
[1:07:21] giving him a certain min
[1:07:25] anointing them for that purpose and
[1:07:27] sending them out and watch what happens
[1:07:30] when he does that ain't that right so so
[1:07:34] this is where we're at that God is
[1:07:36] adopting his sons you say well how how
[1:07:40] do I do that how how does this happen by
[1:07:43] being compliant to the father's will by
[1:07:47] doing what he wants done and not what we
[1:07:50] want done by by just simply believing
[1:07:53] the word word my meat is to do the will
[1:07:55] of him that sent me can you say amen and
[1:07:59] there's people that are being so
[1:08:00] compliant to the father's will amen that
[1:08:03] they they want it if if if they they
[1:08:06] want to know his will what about my job
[1:08:08] what about this what if you said it in
[1:08:10] your word that's what I want to be if
[1:08:11] you said it in the message that's the
[1:08:13] way I want to be I want to be so
[1:08:15] compliant I don't want my ideas about it
[1:08:17] I don't want what I think about it I
[1:08:19] don't want to conform the way the
[1:08:21] world's amen the world's got so many
[1:08:23] ideas is a man uh that is so different
[1:08:26] from the the message of the hour and
[1:08:28] from this Bible simply because the world
[1:08:31] changes man changes man's ideas changes
[1:08:34] I I you know talking to my wife you know
[1:08:37] how interesting of how that our language
[1:08:40] has even changed from even when my
[1:08:43] grandfather uh uh was was was a kid you
[1:08:46] know and bil language and or uh by words
[1:08:49] and and the different things uh it it's
[1:08:52] just funny of of of how that we change
[1:08:55] just even in our language but we change
[1:08:58] in our thoughts and we change in our
[1:08:59] ways we change in our habit the homes
[1:09:02] have changed the churches have changed
[1:09:04] and man's beliefs have changed the dress
[1:09:07] has changed and and and and all of these
[1:09:10] things have changed and and and yet
[1:09:13] there is a word that Still Remains the
[1:09:16] Same can you say amen and so when you
[1:09:20] when you're coming and and and it to
[1:09:22] those that are adop Ed amen it's those
[1:09:25] that are not trying to change the word
[1:09:27] to fit their way of life it's actually
[1:09:31] them not changing with the world and
[1:09:33] their ideas and their opinions and their
[1:09:36] attitudes and their way of of of
[1:09:39] thinking but they're staying right with
[1:09:41] the word my me is to do the will of the
[1:09:43] Father the father never changes his will
[1:09:45] can you say Amen people are turning more
[1:09:48] to doctors and psychiatrists and
[1:09:50] psychologist and and the problem said
[1:09:52] the church is turning the people over
[1:09:53] over why they changed in their ideas
[1:09:56] they changed in their way they're
[1:09:57] changed and they think God is changed
[1:10:00] but God doesn't change his ministry will
[1:10:02] never change and so there are people
[1:10:05] that is being diligent to the father's
[1:10:07] will they're being diligent amen and and
[1:10:11] so brother brandom uh called this
[1:10:13] adoption he says it's being adopted into
[1:10:16] the powers of God being adopted into the
[1:10:20] powers of God Amen now think of that
[1:10:24] amen that that you know we give other
[1:10:27] people Credit in what they do and and
[1:10:29] maybe they're doctors of you know uh got
[1:10:33] their certain degrees and all of that
[1:10:35] but think of it that you have such a
[1:10:38] Ministry given to you that you can just
[1:10:40] simply lay hands on the sick and they
[1:10:42] will recover that you can by Your Word
[1:10:46] just cast out Devils amen and and that's
[1:10:49] what we're supposed to do is it not amen
[1:10:52] not put up with things but literally
[1:10:55] cast Devils
[1:10:56] out amen that's the ministry now that we
[1:11:00] are to have you believe that amen see so
[1:11:03] so then this means if we're adopted into
[1:11:07] the powers of God then then this is the
[1:11:10] same thing that happened to Jesus on
[1:11:13] Mount
[1:11:14] Transfiguration and we're at that mount
[1:11:17] Transfiguration again I believe that
[1:11:20] anyways and which means that all power
[1:11:22] in heaven and earth Earth has been given
[1:11:24] to the church amen to carry on to carry
[1:11:28] on the ministry of Jesus Christ not to
[1:11:32] start a program not to start some
[1:11:35] Society not to start an organization not
[1:11:38] not something for our benefit but to
[1:11:41] carry on the ministry of Jesus Christ so
[1:11:45] we have been given this commission to
[1:11:47] minister yeah you believe that praise
[1:11:50] the Lord I I think it's amazing that God
[1:11:54] would this this this ministry comes
[1:11:57] to uh to its fullness in this age in a
[1:12:00] time of
[1:12:01] selfishness in in a time that that
[1:12:04] people are lovers of pleasure and lovers
[1:12:06] of themselves more than lovers of God
[1:12:09] people think more highly of themselves
[1:12:11] than they do the things of God they they
[1:12:13] think more highly of themselves than
[1:12:15] they do the church and or the word of
[1:12:17] God I should say and and and these
[1:12:20] things and and so uh uh but we have been
[1:12:24] given a commission to minister so you
[1:12:26] could just imagine the things that we
[1:12:28] fight in this day uh uh to bring
[1:12:31] ourselves under
[1:12:33] control uh our feelings our emotions and
[1:12:36] everything under control just to be a
[1:12:37] minister the way God wants us to
[1:12:39] minister in other words we have a direct
[1:12:42] order we we have a command from Jesus
[1:12:44] Christ himself I had uh uh mentioned
[1:12:48] this last Sunday but to minister means
[1:12:50] to wait upon others to serve the need of
[1:12:53] other others not to serve our own needs
[1:12:56] but to serve the need of others to wait
[1:12:59] upon others to supply what is needed to
[1:13:02] care for now so God put you in the
[1:13:05] ministry because he's given you
[1:13:07] something he's given you something that
[1:13:10] the world
[1:13:12] lacks amen and it's more than food that
[1:13:15] they're lacking it's more than just uh
[1:13:17] uh pat on the back that they're lacking
[1:13:20] but but God has given this to the church
[1:13:23] can you say Amen so as God worked in the
[1:13:26] flesh of his own son Jesus Christ he is
[1:13:29] now working in the flesh of adopted
[1:13:32] children through Jesus Christ as he
[1:13:34] promised that's what the prophet said
[1:13:36] see so our Ministries are different our
[1:13:39] ministry is different than that of
[1:13:41] doctors and Jesus didn't call upon us to
[1:13:45] pass out medication and and all of these
[1:13:48] things and uh he didn't call us to learn
[1:13:51] different methods and ways of the world
[1:13:53] so to help
[1:13:55] people he didn't as the prophet said he
[1:13:57] didn't commission his church to build
[1:13:59] hospitals and and and such uh uh he he
[1:14:03] didn't commission us to learn psychology
[1:14:05] and and and to use it on those who are
[1:14:08] in need uh ma Mark 16 and
[1:14:12] 15 Jesus said unto us and this is the
[1:14:15] commission go ye into all the world and
[1:14:17] preach everybody say preach the gospel
[1:14:20] to every creature and he that believe
[1:14:23] believeth is and is baptized shall be
[1:14:25] saved but he that believeth not shall be
[1:14:27] damned see and these signs shall follow
[1:14:30] them that believe in my name they shall
[1:14:31] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[1:14:33] new tongu they shall take up serpents
[1:14:36] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[1:14:37] shall not hurt them they shall lay hands
[1:14:40] on the sick and they shall recover now
[1:14:43] think of the power upon that amen the
[1:14:46] commission that we have amen from from
[1:14:50] God himself amen and and so you you you
[1:14:54] and and please don't get me wrong now uh
[1:14:57] we believe in doctors and we we send our
[1:14:59] children to what you know to to doctors
[1:15:02] and things and so and the dentist and
[1:15:05] whatever but but in this type of
[1:15:07] ministry you're not required to use
[1:15:09] medicine you don't have to use medicine
[1:15:11] you don't have to use a surgeons tools
[1:15:14] you don't you don't have to have
[1:15:16] doctor's degree or a bachelor uh degree
[1:15:20] uh you don't have to know the psychology
[1:15:22] you don't have have to know how to place
[1:15:24] your nouns and pronouns you you don't
[1:15:27] have to you don't have to look so great
[1:15:29] you don't you don't have to amen build
[1:15:32] this this this natural body into such a
[1:15:35] way you know that that uh um you you
[1:15:38] become more effective you don't have to
[1:15:40] drive a nice car you don't have to have
[1:15:42] fancy houses you don't you don't even
[1:15:44] have to have money in the bank for this
[1:15:46] commission to work amen just preach the
[1:15:49] gospel can you say Amen just preach the
[1:15:52] gospel that that's that's all that is
[1:15:54] required is preach the gospel and those
[1:15:57] that believe in my name they shall cast
[1:16:00] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:16:02] tongues they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:16:05] and they shall recover ain't that right
[1:16:07] see just preach the gospel well what is
[1:16:10] the gospel well here's what uh Paul says
[1:16:13] in 1 Thessalonians 1:3 Our Gospel came
[1:16:16] not unto you in word only but also in
[1:16:21] power and in the Holy Ghost and in much
[1:16:25] Assurance as you know what manner of men
[1:16:27] we were among you for your sake ain't
[1:16:31] that right so that's the ministry that
[1:16:33] God has given the church and here
[1:16:36] another place first Corinthians 2 and4
[1:16:39] my speech and my preaching was not with
[1:16:42] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:16:45] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[1:16:49] notice why that your faith should not
[1:16:52] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[1:16:55] power of God do you believe that amen
[1:16:59] amen see I don't I don't believe that
[1:17:01] you have to know the whole message and
[1:17:03] before you become effective I don't
[1:17:05] believe that you have to understand the
[1:17:06] whole Bible before you become effective
[1:17:09] but preach the gospel preach the gospel
[1:17:12] that's what so many people fail to
[1:17:14] realize is that the power lays in the
[1:17:18] gospel it lays in the gospel now you
[1:17:21] know the the Bible says that the letter
[1:17:24] kth but the spirit giveth life amen now
[1:17:28] John 10:10 the thief Jesus said the
[1:17:30] thief cometh not but for to steal to
[1:17:32] kill and destroy now how many times has
[1:17:36] he taken the letter of the word and he's
[1:17:39] destroyed people's lives with the letter
[1:17:42] of the word amen and and people uh look
[1:17:46] at the people that are W today and the
[1:17:49] in shambles whether it be their marriage
[1:17:51] whether it be family whether it be be
[1:17:53] just all kinds of things is because the
[1:17:56] thief amen and and he don't have to tell
[1:17:59] you know well that's what he done in in
[1:18:01] in Genesis he quoted what God said he
[1:18:03] preached the gospel amen but he he done
[1:18:06] it in the wrong way and look what how
[1:18:09] it's affected the world and Mankind and
[1:18:12] and all these things ain't that right
[1:18:14] amen so he comes uh uh uh as a thief and
[1:18:18] to kill steal and destroy but Jesus says
[1:18:22] I am come you may have life if there's
[1:18:25] ever a time that God gives a Ministry to
[1:18:28] a people is to give life to people give
[1:18:32] life to that seed now we know it's a
[1:18:33] predestinated seed that gives life that
[1:18:35] makes life a man see that can be Quicken
[1:18:39] but it's the spirit that gives life so
[1:18:41] we are to go into all the world
[1:18:44] demonstrate the power of the word by the
[1:18:46] Holy Ghost now we all know that there is
[1:18:50] no life outside this message amen there
[1:18:53] is no life that's you you cannot preach
[1:18:56] a Lutheran message and and get life you
[1:19:00] can't preach Wesley's message or
[1:19:02] Pentecostals message of the Pentecostal
[1:19:06] age there's there's just no life there
[1:19:09] and and I I believe in the gifts and and
[1:19:12] they should be operating brother Brown
[1:19:13] said they should be operating in every
[1:19:14] local church uh uh there and and and the
[1:19:18] gifts work through the body but I don't
[1:19:21] believe in operating them the way the
[1:19:23] Pentecostals did in the Pentecostal age
[1:19:25] I just don't believe that and we're
[1:19:27] seeing so much of that right now in the
[1:19:28] message and it's not helping the people
[1:19:31] at all it's more than anything it's
[1:19:33] raising questions it's causing confusion
[1:19:36] it's it's just a mass of of all these
[1:19:39] things and so so if if you're going to
[1:19:42] have a Ministry do something do it do it
[1:19:45] according to the word of the hour do it
[1:19:47] do it according to the message of the
[1:19:48] hour I I'm I'm I'm certain that in the
[1:19:52] Pentecostal age age there was more
[1:19:53] people speaking than God was speaking
[1:19:56] and and yet they were saying it was God
[1:19:58] speaking and it's you know and and I
[1:20:00] just I just believe that you know seen
[1:20:03] it and and and and and this guy ain't
[1:20:05] going back to that Pentecost away we
[1:20:07] just ain't going back there I don't care
[1:20:09] if they are trying to bring it back in
[1:20:10] the message and introduce it that way
[1:20:12] and people may be gullible to go for
[1:20:14] that and that's fine but I know what a
[1:20:16] prophet says that how gifts ought to
[1:20:18] work and how Visions Vision dreams are
[1:20:21] not to be interpreted unless a prophet
[1:20:23] is there to interpret it that's what the
[1:20:25] Bible that's what a prophet says can you
[1:20:28] say amen that's why he didn't give a a
[1:20:30] vision or uh you know uh uh that's why
[1:20:33] he he gave a dream to Joseph uh uh about
[1:20:37] Mary concerning Mary is is because uh uh
[1:20:42] there was no prophet in the land to
[1:20:44] interpret that dream so so God gave
[1:20:48] Joseph A Dream without symbols that
[1:20:50] dream did not need to be interpreted it
[1:20:52] was not symbols it was not some horse
[1:20:55] out here and some this and need now
[1:20:57] we're needing this to be interpreted and
[1:20:59] Joseph waking up wondering what this
[1:21:01] dream meant well God wouldn't have done
[1:21:03] that a can you say amen amen see because
[1:21:06] there was no profit in the in the land
[1:21:09] Amen to interpret that dream see and so
[1:21:13] so God gave him a dream and it was based
[1:21:16] upon the word that when Joseph woke up
[1:21:18] he knew exactly what that dream was
[1:21:20] saying because he could find it right in
[1:21:22] the word of God can you say Amen that
[1:21:25] dream led him to the word so any dream
[1:21:28] that needs to be uh interpreted there's
[1:21:31] no prophet in the land to interpret that
[1:21:33] dream I just just now that's my that's
[1:21:35] the way I see the prophet taught it can
[1:21:38] you say Amen but see there is a Ministry
[1:21:41] without all of this man-made stuff amen
[1:21:45] trying to work something up there is a
[1:21:47] Ministry and that Ministry is effective
[1:21:50] today in a people that would just stay
[1:21:53] with the word and stay with what a
[1:21:55] prophet
[1:21:57] taught amen amen that's right but I
[1:22:00] think the reason why it is because we
[1:22:02] want to draw things to
[1:22:09] ourselves now notice what brother
[1:22:11] brandom says I've always tried to when I
[1:22:15] come down here to talk about something
[1:22:18] not just be talking or not something
[1:22:21] that would please the people
[1:22:24] I tried to speak some about something
[1:22:26] that would please God and help the
[1:22:30] people you see for help now that that we
[1:22:34] could all no matter what church you
[1:22:36] belong to that you could draw closer or
[1:22:40] for a closer walk with God so this was
[1:22:42] the whole point of brother bram's
[1:22:45] Ministry was that we would be drawn
[1:22:47] closer to God am that we would be
[1:22:51] delivered from the the the the ways of
[1:22:53] Satan that we'd be delivered from
[1:22:55] unbelief and delivered from the
[1:22:58] traditions of men and delivered from
[1:23:01] church there's people that are so
[1:23:04] bound and and I have to say that there's
[1:23:07] people so Bound in churches
[1:23:09] today and even in the message church
[1:23:13] that need to be
[1:23:14] free need to be free from uh man-made
[1:23:17] ideas and traditions and uh false
[1:23:20] doctrines and and and all of these
[1:23:23] things see so so but I I really like
[1:23:26] what brother Brandon said my my goal is
[1:23:28] to please God everybody say to please
[1:23:31] God God not to please the people but to
[1:23:34] please God and help the people ain't
[1:23:38] that right amen see so the the help that
[1:23:42] we have to help people it it's got to be
[1:23:45] pleasing to God let it be pleasing to
[1:23:48] God that's the only way that we want to
[1:23:50] help people is that what ever we do to
[1:23:53] help people let it be pleasing to
[1:23:57] God
[1:23:58] on Amen and the only way for this to
[1:24:01] happen to get people closer to God is is
[1:24:03] to preach the gospel which is the word
[1:24:06] for our day
[1:24:07] demonstrated
[1:24:09] demonstrated and and the the prophet
[1:24:12] says that you know you're the only Bible
[1:24:14] that many people will ever read you're
[1:24:17] you're you're the Jesus Christ if
[1:24:19] anybody's going to see Christ it's got
[1:24:21] to be in you

[1:24:25] it's the word put on display and if you
[1:24:28] notice that's the token the token must
[1:24:30] be on display the life of Jesus Christ
[1:24:34] displayed through our lives watch
[1:24:37] forward to minister to others to help
[1:24:39] others to can you say amen amen that
[1:24:42] that that's right can't can't help
[1:24:44] people I we just say it this way you
[1:24:46] can't help people uh uh teaching
[1:24:48] trinitarian Doctrine you you can't help
[1:24:51] people in and you've got to stay in the
[1:24:55] rim of the message in in the in in the
[1:24:58] lines of the message of the hour to help
[1:25:01] people can you say Amen true
[1:25:05] on
[1:25:07] Amen so here we are we're to demonstrate
[1:25:10] the power of God over physical sickness
[1:25:14] mental
[1:25:15] sickness and sickness in the
[1:25:18] soul now if you
[1:25:20] notice the son of man came not to be
[1:25:22] ministered to but to minister well who
[1:25:25] is the son of man it's the word made
[1:25:28] flesh prise the Lord the word made flesh
[1:25:32] and we all know that this is where we're
[1:25:34] at today is the word has becoming flesh
[1:25:37] again again the personal life of Jesus
[1:25:40] Christ in the church do you believe that
[1:25:45] and the word being God and so Jesus was
[1:25:48] anointed for the
[1:25:50] ministry uh uh
[1:25:52] Luke 4:18 the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:25:55] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:25:57] the gospel to the poor Heath sent me uh
[1:26:00] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:26:01] Deliverance to the captives and
[1:26:03] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:26:05] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[1:26:07] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:26:09] he was full of
[1:26:11] compassion Matthew
[1:26:13] 9:36 when he saw the multitudes he was
[1:26:16] moved with compassion on them because
[1:26:19] they fainted and were scattered abroad
[1:26:21] as sheep having no sheer on and on and
[1:26:23] on he he the the Bible talks of Jesus
[1:26:26] having compassion when he prayed for the
[1:26:29] Blind Men he had compassion when he when
[1:26:32] he when he uh uh uh you know um when
[1:26:36] when he uh uh performed the miracle the
[1:26:40] two fishes Five Loaves or uh there he
[1:26:43] had compassion upon the multitude there
[1:26:46] there was a compassion that was in him
[1:26:50] and and and in other words Ministry is
[1:26:53] not effective without
[1:26:56] compassion Ministry is not effective
[1:27:00] without compassion brother Brown said
[1:27:01] you have to enter in to feel for the
[1:27:04] people if you're going to pray for them
[1:27:07] see uh uh so so brother Brandon talked
[1:27:09] about like like that blind man that came
[1:27:11] up for prayer and I think it was a
[1:27:14] Mexican man just a poor poor fella and
[1:27:17] and brother brandham he looked at him
[1:27:20] and he had no shoes on his feet and he
[1:27:22] thought you know if and he looked at his
[1:27:24] shoes and he thought you know and he put
[1:27:27] his feet by his this this Blind Man's
[1:27:29] feet and he thought if I if they would
[1:27:31] just fit I'd give them to him and he
[1:27:34] thought oh the suit that that someone
[1:27:35] had just bought me and and things that
[1:27:37] so nice and things he said if I he said
[1:27:40] if I could if it would fit him I I would
[1:27:42] give that to him see there was a
[1:27:44] compassion there and he got to thinking
[1:27:47] about his own daddy and how he would be
[1:27:49] about that age and and things like that
[1:27:51] and there was a compassion that began to
[1:27:54] to to to uh come up uh in him see and
[1:27:59] and and all he could do was just hug him
[1:28:02] and and he just be to hug the man and
[1:28:05] and cry over this man and before you
[1:28:07] know what the man begin to say I can see
[1:28:09] I I can see and and see brother Brown
[1:28:12] said see you've got to feel for the
[1:28:14] people or you won't do no good uh to
[1:28:18] pray for them see and here I'm thinking
[1:28:20] well what if my daddy would have Liv he
[1:28:22] had been about this age see and and
[1:28:24] here's another one brother Brown tells a
[1:28:26] woman in the prayer line says we're
[1:28:27] strangers to one another you believe the
[1:28:29] holy spirit is here he said what I have
[1:28:31] to do sister I have to feel for you see
[1:28:35] you know it has to be something that I
[1:28:37] sympathize with you he said there's too
[1:28:39] much of this cold eyed Christ uh
[1:28:42] Christianity Today just dried and cut
[1:28:44] you've got to feel for the people see
[1:28:48] and you've got to feel for the people
[1:28:50] that you witnessed to you you got to you
[1:28:53] got to go into their shoes ain't that
[1:28:55] right to to understand that if they're
[1:28:57] going to be lost if God doesn't do
[1:29:00] something and and and so you you you
[1:29:02] you're not there just to give them a
[1:29:04] hamburger you're not there just to to to
[1:29:07] to give them some money you you don't
[1:29:09] know what they're going to do with that
[1:29:10] money you understand what I'm saying
[1:29:12] you're there in compassion there's a
[1:29:15] compassion there that God I want to see
[1:29:18] this man I want to see this woman I want
[1:29:20] to see this boy or girl make it in in
[1:29:22] the in the Rapture I I want to do all I
[1:29:25] can Amen to do everything to make sure
[1:29:28] that they make
[1:29:29] it see you you you feel for the people
[1:29:32] you witness to you you feel for the
[1:29:35] people that you preach to you know we we
[1:29:37] don't want to just preach sermons we we
[1:29:40] we don't want to do that we we want to
[1:29:42] feel for them we want to feel for people
[1:29:46] can you say amen amen feel for people
[1:29:48] feel for people you sing to not just up

[1:29:56] through my song that will edify that
[1:29:58] will deliver that will help somebody
[1:30:01] that'll encourage them to keep
[1:30:04] walking encourage them
[1:30:07] amen lighten their load got to feel for
[1:30:11] them can you say amen amen well this is
[1:30:14] the type of Ministry Jesus had for for
[1:30:17] First Peter 5: 7 says casting all your
[1:30:19] care upon him for he carth for you amen
[1:30:23] he carth for you I think if we have
[1:30:26] compassion if there's if there's a real
[1:30:28] feeling for people it'll cause us to be
[1:30:30] burden for people it'll be called you
[1:30:33] you you feel for people that you work
[1:30:34] for you feel for the people that you
[1:30:37] work with you feel for the people that
[1:30:39] works for you you you're you're feeling
[1:30:42] for the people you're burdened down with
[1:30:44] their because that you know that you've
[1:30:47] got something to help them with can you
[1:30:50] say amen I guarantee it it will cutle
[1:30:52] out all the selfishness that we have it
[1:30:55] it'll make us walk right it'll make us
[1:30:57] talk right it'll make us make sure that
[1:30:59] we don't say anything that would turn
[1:31:01] somebody off of our life can you say
[1:31:04] amen I know you ain't going to reach
[1:31:06] everybody that's not the point amen but
[1:31:08] but you know what there's there times
[1:31:10] that we'll witness to people and they
[1:31:12] turn away but does it make a stop no
[1:31:15] because there's a feeling there for
[1:31:17] people there's a compassion there I
[1:31:19] don't care what it is like brother BR
[1:31:21] says he said I don't care if I prayed
[1:31:23] for a thousand and you know sick people
[1:31:25] and they all died tonight he said I'd be
[1:31:27] back preaching praying for them again
[1:31:30] other people why because you know you've
[1:31:32] got the method you know you've got
[1:31:34] something that the people
[1:31:37] need you know that and so we're doing
[1:31:39] all of our best to get people to Believe
[1:31:42] in Us get people to believe our word get
[1:31:45] people to trust our word get people to
[1:31:47] to know that when they see us they see
[1:31:50] now that man is a Christian that woman's
[1:31:52] got the goods you you understand what
[1:31:55] I'm saying not trying to hide your your
[1:31:56] talent not trying to hide your life
[1:31:58] you're not supposed to hide your light
[1:32:00] you're not supposed to be so so ashamed
[1:32:03] of what you believe right that's right A
[1:32:07] lot of people don't don't tell about the
[1:32:09] Lord and the message because they don't
[1:32:10] live the life of
[1:32:12] it it's just
[1:32:14] facts that's
[1:32:18] right but here casting all your care on
[1:32:21] him for he carth for you think of that
[1:32:23] he carth for you yes he does God took on
[1:32:26] the form of a servant because he
[1:32:28] cared Jesus humbled himself even to the
[1:32:31] death of the
[1:32:32] Cross because he had the same care that
[1:32:36] the father had amen the same care
[1:32:40] brother Bram said he lived and had
[1:32:41] eternal life because he did not live for
[1:32:44] himself he live for others and and you
[1:32:47] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:32:50] day and and and that dead Calvary see
[1:32:54] and you don't live for yourself no more
[1:32:55] you live for others can you say Amen now
[1:32:58] notice another place a great man will
[1:33:00] not will always not be a stuffed shirt
[1:33:03] but he will try to make you think that
[1:33:05] you're the great man because and he's
[1:33:07] nothing that's that's brother BR said
[1:33:09] that now that's the great man not not
[1:33:12] the one that's got the Palaces and you
[1:33:14] know the the the everybody looking at me
[1:33:16] and singing songs about me and and and
[1:33:19] when I'm walking in the room everybody
[1:33:20] applauding woohoo and trying to touch me
[1:33:23] that's not the great man that's right
[1:33:25] brother there's many men that that can
[1:33:27] walk in a room in their presence just
[1:33:29] demand attention you know they they just
[1:33:31] got that ER about them they got that way
[1:33:34] about them but great men Great Men is
[1:33:37] ones that that that would try to make
[1:33:40] that makes you think you're great and
[1:33:41] he's nothing see and the man that is
[1:33:44] isn't nothing and trying to be great see
[1:33:47] it's just the other way and that's the
[1:33:49] reason I know I know that Jesus Jesus
[1:33:51] was the son of God he came to the Earth
[1:33:54] without even having a place to be born
[1:33:58] he had to borrow a womb he had to borrow
[1:34:00] a Manger he come through a borrowed womb
[1:34:02] and went to through a borrowed grave the
[1:34:05] foxes and dens and birds of the air has
[1:34:08] Nest but the son of man has no uh uh uh
[1:34:12] has no place to lay his head see nowhere
[1:34:15] to lay his head yet the king of glory
[1:34:17] the god of Heaven made flesh and dwelt
[1:34:19] Among Us that's what made him big that's
[1:34:22] what made him big was because his
[1:34:25] humility by his humility makes him big
[1:34:30] and humility the way down is all all all
[1:34:34] the ways is the way up see he that will
[1:34:37] humble himself God will exalt he that
[1:34:40] exalteth himself shall be aeed the way
[1:34:43] down is uh is the way up for the
[1:34:45] believer see humble himself before God
[1:34:49] ain't that right he said Jesus meant
[1:34:51] with with men of all walks of life he
[1:34:53] met in great circles one time he was
[1:34:55] with thousands 500 at once you know 12
[1:34:59] at once three at once and even will come
[1:35:01] to one that's what makes him great not
[1:35:04] because not even one person can ever
[1:35:08] call on him but what he will be right
[1:35:10] there at their side that's what makes
[1:35:12] him God is because of his humility ain't
[1:35:16] that right now you think of that we are
[1:35:18] his body we we are just like Jesus
[1:35:22] Christ was the Tabernacle of God in that
[1:35:25] day now we're just common born sex sex
[1:35:28] born Sinners that have been redeemed
[1:35:32] though the blood has been so powerful
[1:35:35] that it has wiped your slate clean that
[1:35:38] you can stand just as Jesus Christ stood
[1:35:41] and God could have preeminence over your
[1:35:44] body as he did that body can you say
[1:35:46] amen and express his ministry like he
[1:35:49] did in that body and his humility his
[1:35:53] character to we his power and it's
[1:35:56] nothing about you it's not your glory
[1:35:58] it's nothing it's God that carth for the
[1:36:01] people living in you caring for the
[1:36:04] people in
[1:36:08] you God caring for the people in
[1:36:11] you God believing his own word in you
[1:36:15] amen why because he's made a way for
[1:36:17] this to happen at Calvary he made a way
[1:36:21] right prise the Lord see he served
[1:36:25] others and not
[1:36:28] himself he didn't care for others as as
[1:36:33] a doctor would therefore he didn't live
[1:36:36] as a doctor
[1:36:39] would he didn't care for others as the
[1:36:42] dentist does therefore he didn't live as
[1:36:45] a dentist would he didn't care for
[1:36:47] others as a lawyer
[1:36:49] would he didn't care care for others as
[1:36:53] maybe a psychologist would he didn't
[1:36:55] care for others as a priest or bishop or
[1:36:57] Theologian would therefore he didn't
[1:36:59] live as they live that's
[1:37:02] true can you say amen amen he cared in a
[1:37:06] way that no one else could care did
[1:37:08] Brother BR said he cared for the leopard
[1:37:11] when nothing else could care he cared
[1:37:13] for the blind
[1:37:16] beggar that had just ragged clothes
[1:37:19] on n was on his way up to
[1:37:22] Calvary and all everybody tell him
[1:37:25] trying to tell that that beggar hush
[1:37:29] hush up don't don't interrupt him he's
[1:37:31] too busy he's too
[1:37:33] important but he so cared for that blind
[1:37:36] beggar that he
[1:37:39] stopped Amen to care for the need he so
[1:37:43] cared for that prostitute woman that was
[1:37:46] so Bound in sin and condemnation right
[1:37:52] and the filth of her past and the way of
[1:37:56] living but he wasn't too important to go
[1:38:00] by her
[1:38:02] way brother brah said he cared for her
[1:38:04] so much that he told her the secrets of
[1:38:07] her heart and forgave every sin and put
[1:38:10] something in her that she run into the
[1:38:13] city saying come see a man that's told
[1:38:15] me the things that I've done yes sir he
[1:38:18] says no matter how little or
[1:38:20] insignificant

[1:38:24] cared he cared for the immoral he cared
[1:38:27] for the drunks the alcoholics whatever
[1:38:30] it was he cared that's right and you
[1:38:34] amen amen amen his care went deeper than
[1:38:38] just just the organizations his care
[1:38:41] went deeper than any charity
[1:38:44] function his care went so far deeper
[1:38:48] amen that he knew that he could deliver
[1:38:51] them and set them free yes sir he cared
[1:38:55] for that
[1:38:56] woman that had them Seven Devils in her
[1:38:59] Mary Magdalene it was and he cast them
[1:39:03] out
[1:39:04] amen and she never was the same again
[1:39:07] that's true amen that's the kind of care
[1:39:09] that Jesus had he had it to
[1:39:13] give you have it to give you have it to
[1:39:17] give we got to get out of our
[1:39:20] selfishness
[1:39:21] it's not all about us at all and we
[1:39:24] making it about
[1:39:25] us this preacher makes it about us
[1:39:29] himself a lot of
[1:39:33] times one day Jesus passed by a funeral
[1:39:39] possession procession I should say
[1:39:42] brother Brown described how just he just
[1:39:45] got through walking 30 miles that day he
[1:39:47] was so
[1:39:49] tired exhausted
[1:39:51] weary
[1:39:53] hungry but he
[1:39:57] cared he looked at that little woman
[1:39:59] that was grieving heartbroken
[1:40:02] mother and he thought I could help
[1:40:05] her and he cared didn't charge her a
[1:40:09] dime he just stopped the
[1:40:12] procession went to that coffin and
[1:40:15] raised her little boy up because the
[1:40:18] cared praise God hallelujah you say Amen
[1:40:22] Lord he cared so much that he prayed he
[1:40:25] spent much time in prayer to stay in
[1:40:28] fellowship with the God that was in him
[1:40:31] he cared think about that ain't that
[1:40:34] right right see he knew his ministry he
[1:40:37] so cared for the people that he said

[1:42:15] close there is
[1:42:19] so a a false conception about Ministry
[1:42:23] today people have made it about glamour
[1:42:28] excitement kind of like a
[1:42:31] choice of what I want to do when I want
[1:42:34] to do it where I want to do
[1:42:40] it there's a song back in Oklahoma they

[1:43:04] be glad to do that but he putting
[1:43:06] stipulations on
[1:43:08] it you know what I'm
[1:43:11] saying and that's not what Ministry is
[1:43:14] about we made Ministry about Glamour and
[1:43:17] excitement popularity and gain but if
[1:43:20] you really think of it Ministry for
[1:43:22] Jesus was
[1:43:25] difficult the prophet said he was
[1:43:28] misunderstood he was misunderstood from
[1:43:31] the GetGo his birth was
[1:43:34] misunderstood his ministry was
[1:43:37] misunderstood his message was
[1:43:40] misunderstood his actions were
[1:43:42] misunderstood amen I thought you know uh
[1:43:45] brother Bram talking about uh Mr Mercer
[1:43:48] you know told Brother Bram said God is
[1:43:50] going to change your ministry and when
[1:43:51] he does that said you'll probably be
[1:43:53] just you'll probably line up the
[1:43:54] hospitals and speak them all speak them
[1:43:57] out of the beds and things you know
[1:44:00] that's that's what he was thinking of
[1:44:02] this ministry that brother brandham had
[1:44:04] oh just emptying out the hospitals and
[1:44:06] and all these things and but brother
[1:44:08] Brown said it just didn't sound
[1:44:11] right see he said our lord Jesus never
[1:44:14] done it now if he was talking to a
[1:44:15] selfish individual that had that type of
[1:44:18] man Ministry he'd be like yeah let's go
[1:44:20] try it but something about it just
[1:44:23] didn't ring right and and he said our
[1:44:26] lord Jesus never did that he went into
[1:44:28] the hospitals he said there was one
[1:44:31] there was one in that hospital he went
[1:44:33] in the hospital but there was only one
[1:44:35] he went
[1:44:36] for is you remember where it was at in
[1:44:39] in the Bible the pool of Bethesda see
[1:44:41] great multitudes of impotent people laid
[1:44:43] there crippled lame blind withered
[1:44:45] waiting for the angel he said that was
[1:44:47] in a spiritual hospital where people
[1:44:49] waited on Divine Healing and here the
[1:44:51] Divine healer himself came in and healed
[1:44:53] one and walked out so you couldn't
[1:44:56] expect a mortal or a Ministry to come
[1:44:58] forth that would be any greater than
[1:45:00] what he was see so he says I just
[1:45:03] couldn't agree with it see so Jesus's
[1:45:06] Ministry was based on the leadership of
[1:45:09] the father amen you know brother bradam
[1:45:11] said the anointing is is supreme control
[1:45:16] uh uh how was that the uh Power
[1:45:21] supreme power under control the
[1:45:23] anointing is supreme
[1:45:26] power under control in control can you
[1:45:29] say Amen see not not just someone not
[1:45:32] just anointing and then just running
[1:45:34] around doing everything that you think
[1:45:35] ought to be done no it was under under a
[1:45:39] supreme uh under control see he says and
[1:45:43] everyone that tries to live before God
[1:45:46] is misunderstood that's right people
[1:45:47] misunderstand you see they think there's
[1:45:49] something wrong with with you see
[1:45:51] sometimes they're considered neurotics
[1:45:54] when they really try to live true live
[1:45:56] loyal and true to God ain't that right
[1:45:59] so he was misunderstood but the Bible
[1:46:01] talks about his life he was rejected he
[1:46:04] was
[1:46:06] despised he cared for people and yet he
[1:46:10] was despised and rejected he was also a
[1:46:13] man of sorrow and was acquainted with
[1:46:17] grief I think it was his compassion
[1:46:21] that subjected him to such things
[1:46:27] yes said he cried
[1:46:29] often he loved people amen can you say
[1:46:33] Amen yes he did am that as we close one
[1:46:37] thing that he never did and you remember
[1:46:39] he was tempted in all points like
[1:46:41] us yes he
[1:46:46] was he never let the root of bitterness
[1:46:51] that's true take
[1:46:54] root in his
[1:46:56] soul he never let his Spirit become
[1:47:03] damaged you think of the sufferings you
[1:47:05] think of the critics you think of people
[1:47:07] the abuse that people gave him
[1:47:11] right and yet he he kept himself in such
[1:47:15] a way that he could maintain a Ministry
[1:47:20] keep his
[1:47:21] influence
[1:47:23] amen true
[1:47:26] amen he never let his heart become
[1:47:29] callous and hard he never let
[1:47:34] complexes build
[1:47:39] up to where he couldn't help the
[1:47:41] people can you say amen
[1:47:45] amen it's
[1:47:48] amazing how that
[1:47:51] God would take us and he would ordain us
[1:47:55] to carry on his ministry
[1:47:58] amen common
[1:48:01] people people that is subject to hurts
[1:48:06] that's right subject to
[1:48:09] disappointments oh yeah subject
[1:48:12] to I don't want to say spirits
[1:48:16] but Warfare
[1:48:18] sure subject
[1:48:22] to that if we're not
[1:48:25] careful that we can build complexes so
[1:48:34] high that when people come and needing
[1:48:37] help and yet the only way they can
[1:48:40] respond or way they can do it is tear
[1:48:42] you
[1:48:45] down and yet they need
[1:48:49] help
[1:48:52] and if we're not careful if we've got
[1:48:54] complexes built
[1:48:56] up we'll actually walk
[1:48:58] away we'll actually strike
[1:49:02] out you
[1:49:06] understand whatever you go
[1:49:08] through don't let that don't let
[1:49:11] hardness come into your heart amen I I
[1:49:13] don't care what it is amen I I find that
[1:49:17] people you know that have a bad
[1:49:18] upbringing or something in their lives
[1:49:20] and you know and and they carry that
[1:49:24] over yes they they carry it over and and
[1:49:27] they wear this this thing on their their
[1:49:29] their shoulder this Grudge and not maybe
[1:49:32] not even realize what they're
[1:49:34] doing sometimes we don't realize it till
[1:49:38] someone has to point it out or
[1:49:41] whatever but we'll carry this Grudge and
[1:49:44] I if if if if a man has abused us we'll
[1:49:47] carry that Grudge and we'll treat every
[1:49:49] other man just the same way if if we
[1:49:53] were abused at home by our mom or or or
[1:49:57] or by something and and we just didn't
[1:49:59] and we carry that thing then we'll treat
[1:50:02] everyone just
[1:50:03] equal you understand what I'm
[1:50:06] saying and and and and and you can't
[1:50:09] help
[1:50:14] people I know there's times that we need
[1:50:17] the
[1:50:19] healing and this is why the
[1:50:21] Fountain of
[1:50:24] Calvary praise the Lord this is this is
[1:50:27] why we come to church is not to keep our
[1:50:30] defenses up amen but to let it
[1:50:33] drop and say God do whatever you want
[1:50:35] with me true let me
[1:50:39] heal cuz why we we because I'm telling
[1:50:42] you complexes makes us
[1:50:45] selfish scars makes us
[1:50:49] selfish because we're always on a
[1:50:51] defense we ain't going to let no one
[1:50:53] hurt us this time but you know what how
[1:50:55] many times Jesus was
[1:50:57] hurt you know it wasn't all his hurt
[1:51:01] didn't start at
[1:51:03] Calvary his whole life was
[1:51:06] scarred trying to help people and they
[1:51:08] call him illegitimate how can you help
[1:51:11] people when they're calling you
[1:51:13] illegitimate F you just want to get in
[1:51:15] the in a corner somewhere and just shun
[1:51:17] it all brother Bram even talk talked
[1:51:20] about how I've preached and preached and
[1:51:21] preached and just worse I just you know
[1:51:23] and he just determined he was going to
[1:51:25] go take his wife get up in the mountains
[1:51:27] and just forget
[1:51:29] it
[1:51:30] right why because it the rejection
[1:51:37] hurt the things that he went through
[1:51:40] hurt but God wouldn't let him do
[1:51:45] that
[1:51:47] true don't live your life selfishly
[1:51:52] don't you live your life just all hurt
[1:51:54] hurt hurt hurt he hurt me she hurt me
[1:51:57] I'm hurt and then when someone really
[1:51:59] needs help it doesn't matter how they
[1:52:02] strike at you it doesn't matter what
[1:52:04] they say about
[1:52:06] you get to the place that you can help
[1:52:08] that
[1:52:11] individual amen is that what what we
[1:52:15] want to
[1:52:16] be I think that's what we all should be
[1:52:19] is be able to help
[1:52:21] people right don't leave the message to
[1:52:24] try to help
[1:52:25] people get into prayer get into a place
[1:52:28] that you can be a dedicated channel for
[1:52:30] God quit letting the devil use
[1:52:32] us quit letting the devil build
[1:52:35] complexes in
[1:52:38] us cuz Satan will take them hurts and
[1:52:40] he'll use it against
[1:52:44] you he uses our memory he uses
[1:52:46] everything against
[1:52:48] us we start having flashbacks and this
[1:52:51] and that and it and and you know what
[1:52:53] what Satan does he misinterprets it so
[1:52:55] many times
[1:52:58] true don't let the devil do it amen
[1:53:01] we're called to
[1:53:02] minister can you say amen amen we've got
[1:53:06] the most powerful message on the face of
[1:53:08] the
[1:53:10] Earth to heal us to help us if we can
[1:53:15] believe it that's right but also that
[1:53:18] it'll Empower us
[1:53:20] to help others amen can you say amen
[1:53:23] amen you love the
[1:53:25] Lord if the musicians Will

[1:53:41] of of
[1:53:45] God no matter
[1:53:48] what
[1:53:50] office or
[1:53:52] what your God has called you to do do
[1:53:57] it be content with it prise the lord
[1:54:01] it's not always going to be
[1:54:03] easy
[1:54:05] amen you got to be assured that you're
[1:54:08] in hand God's
[1:54:10] hands you got to be confident that God
[1:54:13] loves
[1:54:15] [Music]
[1:54:17] you Jesus was so confident of the
[1:54:20] Father's love that it didn't matter the
[1:54:22] rejection of the people he was out to
[1:54:25] find them people that he was sent
[1:54:27] [Music]
[1:54:29] for can you say
[1:54:33] amen and he was there to heal them he
[1:54:35] was there to help them he was there to
[1:54:37] deliver them he was there to set them
[1:54:42] free God may have called you to sing
[1:54:45] there's healing in
[1:54:47] music there's healing in
[1:54:50] singing but get to a place that God can
[1:54:53] use you that you're
[1:54:56] anointed you understand what I'm saying
[1:54:57] if we realize that we're ministers in
[1:54:59] this type of a Ministry doctors can be
[1:55:03] smoking they can cuss they can chew
[1:55:05] their tobacco and they can do all that
[1:55:06] and sew you up and then do a good
[1:55:09] job but we can't help in our ministry if
[1:55:14] we're not living true to
[1:55:16] God we can't help in our ministry
[1:55:20] because we need his anointing it's not
[1:55:24] skill it's not learning how to say the
[1:55:27] right words and knowing how to put our
