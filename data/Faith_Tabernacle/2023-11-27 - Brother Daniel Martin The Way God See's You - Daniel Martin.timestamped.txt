[33:00] Hast showed kindness unto my master if
[33:04] we could also turn to
[33:13] Ephesians Ephesians
[33:25] 1 Ephesians 1 ver3 says blessed be the
[33:29] Lord God and Father uh of our Lord Jesus
[33:32] Christ who ha blessed us with all
[33:34] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[33:36] in Christ according as he hath chosen Us
[33:40] in him before the foundation of the
[33:44] world that we should be holy and Without
[33:47] Blame before him in love having
[33:50] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[33:52] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[33:56] according to the good pleasure of his
[33:58] will if we could read maybe verse four
[34:00] again according to he hath chosen Us in
[34:04] him before the foundation of the world
[34:07] Amen can we just bow our heads for a
[34:09] moment dear heavenly father Lord we
[34:12] humbly come before you again Lord asking
[34:15] that you would just move in a special
[34:18] way tonight father I pray that you would
[34:20] help me move myself out of the way Lord
[34:22] that you would just speak through me
[34:24] Lord and Lord I pray that you would
[34:26] bless your people tonight Lord I pray
[34:28] that you would give them ears to hear
[34:30] that they would receive father Lord
[34:32] tonight Lord we just love you and we
[34:34] thank you Lord for all that you've done
[34:36] may you have your way as our prayer in
[34:38] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you can
[34:42] be
[34:44] seated I uh I've had this thought on my
[34:47] heart for a little while now um it's a
[34:51] vast subject um so I'm I'm just not even
[34:56] going to scrape the surface um of what
[35:00] um is really so much to say um but if
[35:04] you would just bear with me I'm going to
[35:06] take a minute and I'm going to try and
[35:08] build a a foundation and maybe um it'll
[35:12] all make sense in the end but um but uh
[35:16] in many things in life you know we uh we
[35:19] are given a
[35:20] choice and the way of life itself is a
[35:24] choice we have a right to make our own
[35:27] way we choose our own way that we want
[35:30] to live our daily life is determined by
[35:34] our decisions by our
[35:37] choices um education is a choice uh we
[35:40] decide um what we're going to be
[35:43] educated by we're going you know we
[35:45] decide um where we choose or we choose
[35:49] uh where we're going to be educated on
[35:52] what college to go to or what university
[35:55] whether it be Virginia Tech or whether
[35:57] it be um in Arizona or somewhere else
[36:00] it's a choice that we have to make and
[36:03] those choices are determined to make our
[36:06] lives a better person um we make these
[36:10] choices to because we wouldn't want to
[36:12] make a choice that would maybe degrade
[36:15] ourselves if that would make sense we
[36:17] want to do the best for ourselves and uh
[36:20] you know so you know we decide you know
[36:23] what school what college you know we
[36:25] want to go to we also decide um you know
[36:29] if you don't want to go to college you
[36:31] decide what job you got to take and
[36:33] during that you know you decide whether
[36:35] you're going to be a um you know a
[36:38] fireman whether you're going to be a a
[36:40] police officer whether you're going to
[36:42] be a a construction worker or uh pumping
[36:45] sewer tanks or you know it's a choice
[36:48] that you have to make and you know we we
[36:52] also have a decision even on what we
[36:57] want to wear in the mornings we have a
[36:59] decision on where what we want for lunch
[37:02] what we want for breakfast so our whole
[37:05] lives is determined by what we choose on
[37:09] that day what car to drive you know
[37:11] whether it be a um a minivan or some of
[37:15] us don't have that choice but to drive
[37:17] drive some of those but um you know our
[37:20] our our decisions um determine what
[37:23] we're going to be and you know right and
[37:26] wrong is a choice every man and woman
[37:30] brother brandham says boy or girl has to
[37:32] choose whether they are going to live
[37:35] right or whether they're going to live
[37:36] wrong and it's a choice brother Brandon
[37:40] says choice is a great thing choice
[37:42] choice is a great thing and there's
[37:45] another choice that we all have to make
[37:48] and this is kind of where I want to get
[37:50] into a little bit now is um a a choice
[37:54] that we have to make in life and that is
[37:56] our life companion we have to have a
[37:59] choice on who we're going to spend the
[38:02] rest of our lives with and a young man
[38:04] or a young woman stepping out in life
[38:06] has been given a right to make a choice
[38:09] the young man chooses the young woman
[38:12] has a right to accept or reject it but
[38:14] it's still a choice on both sides both
[38:17] man and woman they have a right to
[38:19] choose and you know brother Brandon says
[38:22] the natural types the spiritual and then
[38:26] the choosing of a bride in the natural
[38:29] is the same is a type of choosing the
[38:31] bride in the spiritual you know a god
[38:34] choosing a bride and we read where uh
[38:39] elizer Abraham sent elzer out to find a
[38:43] bride for Isaac and uh now it's very
[38:47] serious uh when a man chooses his wife
[38:51] because it's until death do us part uh
[38:54] there's no separation and and man in his
[38:57] right mind that's planning a future he
[39:00] should choose that wife very careful
[39:04] because she reflects who he is amen he
[39:09] she reflects who that man is and brother
[39:12] brandham says the kind of woman that a
[39:15] man would choose will ref uh excuse me
[39:18] will reflect his ambition and his
[39:21] character if a man chooses the wrong
[39:24] woman it reflects his character and what
[39:27] he ties himself to shows truly what's in
[39:31] him a woman reflects what's in the man
[39:34] when he chooses her for a wife it shows
[39:37] what's down in him no matter what he
[39:40] says on the outside watch what he
[39:43] marries amen so uh and there's a lot of
[39:46] men out there today who are only looking
[39:49] for beauty and a woman they're only
[39:51] looking for uh uh maybe they they find a
[39:55] celebrity they they uh think is just
[39:58] beautiful and so they're going to go
[40:00] after that woman just because of her
[40:02] good looks and you know some some men
[40:05] you know who uh they see that they're
[40:07] wealthy see the parents are wealthy so
[40:10] they're going to try to go in for her
[40:12] just for the money and um and you know
[40:16] but a true man is going to look for
[40:20] character it don't matter how pretty she
[40:22] is it don't matter you know whether
[40:25] she's rich or whether she's
[40:27] poor uh he's going to look at her
[40:30] character and um you know it's the uh uh
[40:36] uh uh brother brandham says another
[40:39] place um he says I think today what's
[40:42] going so many uh divorces cases now that
[40:46] we lead the world in in America in
[40:49] divorce cases America leads the world in
[40:52] divorce cases we lead the rest of the
[40:54] world there's more divorces here than
[40:56] anywhere else in this nation and
[40:58] supposed to be uh and thought of a
[41:01] Christian Nation what a reproach our
[41:04] divorce court I think the reason of it
[41:06] is is because that men has got away from
[41:09] God and women has gotten away from God
[41:11] and if he said that back in ' 65 how
[41:14] many many more uh marriage cases do we
[41:17] have uh divorce cases do we have today
[41:21] and uh but a true man will seek a wife
[41:25] with character seek a wife that will
[41:27] raise their kids in the way maybe that
[41:30] the Bible that the that the message that
[41:33] the teaches and you know uh me looking
[41:37] uh you know when I married my wife you
[41:40] know I I uh there's a lot of pretty
[41:42] girls out there you know um there's a
[41:45] lot of uh beauty queens out there that
[41:48] um you know I I thought I was there was
[41:51] a there was a girl in another state that
[41:53] I thought for sure I was going to marry
[41:55] but I was looking at her in the wrong
[41:58] you know makes sense in the wrong way
[42:00] she was she was beautiful and I didn't
[42:03] look at her character and uh you know so
[42:07] so you know when I was searching I just
[42:10] didn't want anyone and you know I prayed
[42:13] desperately I I didn't want anyone that
[42:16] would go behind my back I didn't want
[42:18] anyone that would if I told my kids know
[42:20] on one thing soon as I leave Mama comes
[42:23] in and tells him well you don't have to
[42:25] listen to Daddy didn't want that I
[42:27] didn't want to have to watch my wife
[42:29] continually I didn't want to have to
[42:31] keep an eye on her all the time I want
[42:34] her to you know that she could be free
[42:36] that she could just she can uh set her
[42:38] home the way she would like to set her
[42:40] home you know in in a Godly Manner and
[42:44] uh you know and when I found my wife I I
[42:47] seen that there was something in her
[42:50] that was more than just uh uh the the
[42:54] the world out here there was something
[42:56] in here more there was something in her
[42:58] that uh reflected something different
[43:01] there was something that caught my eye I
[43:03] know growing up dad always told us he
[43:05] says you know he says you know you make
[43:07] a list write a list on what you want out
[43:09] of a woman and and he says and God will
[43:14] meet that list and uh so I so I did I
[43:18] wrote out what I wanted out of a woman I
[43:20] want her to um to be a lot like my first
[43:23] Mom I wanted her to be a lot like
[43:26] Heather I wanted her to be uh a creative
[43:30] I I I had a lot and I had high
[43:32] expectations and uh so but but I I I
[43:37] told the Lord I said well this is what I
[43:39] want and and uh Lord you're going to
[43:41] have to bless and you know when he
[43:43] brought me my wife it met every every
[43:46] little list yeah sure we have our our
[43:48] disappointment sure we have our our
[43:50] little spat sometimes but I love my wife
[43:54] and and uh uh uh that's that's who I'm
[43:58] married amen and um so so we have a
[44:01] choice on on whether we want just some
[44:04] some sex Queen out there whether we just
[44:07] want some pretty woman out there whether
[44:09] we just want someone just to have a good
[44:11] time or or whatever or we can or we can
[44:14] get someone that will reflect who we
[44:16] really are someone that's going to
[44:18] reflect our our our Ambitions amen and
[44:22] and uh so uh uh and and someone um you
[44:27] know I didn't want you know my wife to
[44:31] to be able to you know she would just
[44:33] sneak around and just go around and and
[44:35] just do her own thing and me doing my
[44:37] own thing but no that we had to we had
[44:40] to have a connection there and and see
[44:43] and that's the same thing with God is he
[44:46] didn't come looking for a bride that
[44:48] resembled the world he didn't want
[44:50] something that didn't resemble who he
[44:52] really was he didn't want something that
[44:55] resembled uh
[44:57] uh the things of the world the the
[44:59] church world he wanted something that
[45:01] was going to reflect his character amen
[45:06] he didn't come looking for a bride that
[45:08] was caught up in this religion or that
[45:10] religion and or or brother Bram called
[45:12] it uh de denominational prostitute and
[45:16] uh so so see having a form of godliness
[45:20] but denying the power thereof and um but
[45:24] she has to be the same kind of character
[45:28] as he
[45:30] is amen so before before he made
[45:35] man he called himself
[45:37] Elohim the word means in the Hebrew the
[45:40] self-existent one all by himself nothing
[45:44] existed before him he was all that
[45:47] existed there ever was self-existence
[45:50] one
[45:52] Ella um el el Allah Elohim means the
[45:57] alls sufficient all powerful allmighty
[46:01] self-existence one see he wasn't even
[46:04] God yet for the word god means an object
[46:07] of worship and and Elohim was an
[46:11] attribute to be God in him was to be a
[46:14] God so so he created the angels and
[46:17] there was something there to worship him
[46:19] and then then he became God and but in
[46:23] God was also to be a savior there but
[46:26] there was nothing lost in him was to be
[46:28] a Healer but there was nothing to heal
[46:31] in him was to be a provider but there
[46:34] was uh nothing to provide for and God uh
[46:39] wanted to express all that he was into
[46:43] someone into his bride amen so God being
[46:47] the logos the word in the beginning was
[46:49] the word and the Word was God so God
[46:52] being the word said let us make man in
[46:54] our own image
[46:56] and God being a spirit then created uh
[46:59] spirit man Adam after his own likeness
[47:02] Adam then took on the nature of God Amen
[47:06] Adam then could have fellowship with God
[47:08] he was holy as God was holy he was he
[47:11] was made to be a Lesser God he had
[47:14] dominion over the Earth brother bham
[47:15] says but in Genesis 2 when he made man
[47:18] he said I am uh uh yaha Jehovah uh what
[47:23] did it mean I am the all exist one who
[47:26] has created something of off of myself
[47:30] to be a son of mine or a temporary or an
[47:33] amateure little one of mine Oh Glory why
[47:36] he gave man Jehovah means that he gave
[47:38] man to be an amateur God because he is
[47:42] Father God and he made a man an amateur
[47:44] God so he isn't self-existent anymore he
[47:48] exists with his family amen El eloh
[47:52] Elohim now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning
[47:56] the one who exists with his family amen
[47:59] but you know Adam being in his perfect
[48:02] state but God seen that he was alone go
[48:06] God seen that that Adam was that was
[48:09] alone so what did he do he created a
[48:11] help meate for Adam and and out of Adam
[48:14] not another creation but out of Adam he
[48:17] took the out of the original creation
[48:20] God took a a bride out of Adam a bride
[48:24] for Adam amen Genesis 2: 21 says and the
[48:28] Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon
[48:31] Adam and he slept and he took one of his
[48:35] ribs and closed the Flesh in uh flesh
[48:37] instead thereof and the rib which the
[48:40] Lord God had taken from man made he a
[48:44] woman and brought her unto the man and
[48:47] Adam said this is now bone of my bones
[48:50] this is Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[48:53] called woman because she was taken out
[48:55] of man therefore shall a man leave his
[48:58] father and mother and shall cleave unto
[49:00] his wife and they shall be one flesh
[49:04] amen she became one with him she was
[49:07] then a part of him she was Adam amen
[49:11] they were both named Adam because she
[49:12] was taken out of him she become him you
[49:15] know as our pastor was saying this
[49:16] morning God separated that God gave the
[49:19] masculine to to the male and gave the
[49:21] feminine part to the the female but they
[49:24] were both one all of that was with
[49:26] within Adam Adam had both male or
[49:29] masculine and feminine in in him so when
[49:32] God took that rib out you know not out
[49:34] of another creation God God God took
[49:37] that out of out of Adam and separated
[49:40] the two so they become one flesh amen
[49:43] and brother brandham says now the first
[49:45] man and the first woman in the Garden of
[49:46] Eden was the perfect har was in perfect
[49:49] harmony with
[49:52] God yes so much that God could come down
[49:55] at that time he desired and talked lip
[49:58] to ear with Adam and Eve now that is
[50:00] perfect Oneness God and His creation God
[50:04] speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve
[50:06] and they were so in perfect harmony with
[50:09] God till they were one with God and his
[50:12] family was one amen they lived in such
[50:16] Perfect Harmony that they were one with
[50:18] God but then what
[50:20] happened there came sin amen and what
[50:24] does Sin do sin separates uh sin causes
[50:28] a separation between God and man and
[50:31] When sin came in only then did it cause
[50:33] a separation between God and Adam and
[50:36] and then Adam be Adam took on that
[50:38] Fallen nature so everyone since then has
[50:42] been born with a fallen nature everyone
[50:45] since then has been subject to the
[50:47] things of the world subject to their own
[50:50] ideas subject to this subject to that
[50:53] because now they have taken on a Fallen
[50:55] nature a nature that is not of God Amen
[50:59] so there had to be an atonement made
[51:01] there had to be something to bring us
[51:04] back to in fellowship with God again and
[51:07] so there had to be something that would
[51:09] bring us back to the full manif
[51:12] manifestation of the word there had to
[51:14] been something that could bring us back
[51:16] into Oneness with God Amen see Cain had
[51:20] his own thoughts but didn't line up with
[51:22] the word Cain had his own ways of doing
[51:25] things yeah Cain was just as religious
[51:28] as as Abel was he was he paid his tie he
[51:31] went to church but God couldn't accept
[51:33] his sacrifice because it didn't line up
[51:36] with what god with the original word if
[51:39] that makes sense amen it wasn't what the
[51:42] word says but what did god require God
[51:45] required the
[51:47] blood and not just any blood not a sex
[51:50] cell that there had to come the but
[51:52] there had to come an original word there
[51:55] had to come born of a virgin amen there
[51:57] he couldn't come the way that you and I
[51:59] came he couldn't come uh through the
[52:02] desires of a husband and wife but he had
[52:05] to come in in such a way that that this
[52:07] blood cell wouldn't be contaminated it
[52:10] had to come in in such a way that it
[52:12] would stay pure that it would stay holy
[52:14] and there was no man that could come
[52:16] there was no human being that could come
[52:18] and bring us back to God so what did God
[52:20] have to do God had to come himself God
[52:24] had to come in the form of a man and
[52:27] form of a baby and come and bring us
[52:31] back to God Amen and there was no one
[52:35] worthy there was no one that could take
[52:38] our place but he made us worthy he he
[52:41] come in the form of man God in the form
[52:45] of a man God said he would have a bride
[52:48] without spot or wrinkle and before the
[52:50] foundation of the world he had you in
[52:53] his mind before there was ever a Sunrise
[52:56] before there was ever a sunset before
[52:58] there was ever a cloud in the sky God
[53:01] had you in his mind before there was
[53:03] ever a molecule God had you in his mind
[53:07] and the only way you was going to come
[53:08] back to God was he had to come himself
[53:11] he had to come in himself to bring you
[53:14] back into fellowship with him amen that
[53:17] just it just makes me so excited that he
[53:20] would that he would think of
[53:22] me nobody that he would just would come
[53:25] and that he would want to Des that he
[53:27] would desire to have fellowship with me
[53:31] amen just like uh you know uh sin
[53:34] causing that separation you know uh me
[53:37] and my wife we wouldn't be able to have
[53:39] a fellowship together if there was a
[53:41] wall between us if there was a wall
[53:44] there if there was something that was
[53:45] said or if there someone got mad or
[53:47] something then what would happen there
[53:49] come a wall of separation and and you
[53:51] know she would do her thing and then you
[53:53] know I would do my thing and then the
[53:55] whole time a wall of separation standing
[53:58] in between us and but you know we could
[54:01] never be happy we could never uh enjoy
[54:04] each other's Fellowship we could never
[54:07] uh come together in Oneness again
[54:10] because of that wall of separation so
[54:13] what has to happen that wall of
[54:15] separation has to come down and that's
[54:17] what happened was sin caused that
[54:19] separation between us and God God we
[54:22] couldn't get back to God we couldn't
[54:23] reach God but then God had to come down
[54:26] himself and tear down that separation
[54:30] amen so in for in order for us to have
[54:32] Fellowship we had to get rid of the
[54:35] separation you know whether it was just
[54:36] buying her some flowers whether it was
[54:39] whatever it might be uh we had to to uh
[54:44] have Oneness
[54:45] again amen and that's what we needed
[54:48] today we have fallen race of Adam we
[54:51] needed a
[54:52] Redemption and so he sent his son Jesus
[54:55] Christ the word to redeem us back to him
[54:59] and there are a lot of people today
[55:01] trying to uh come back to God by just
[55:03] shaking the preacher's hand they're
[55:05] trying to come back to God by just doing
[55:07] their good works oh you know they they
[55:09] have their potlucks and they have their
[55:12] with their Community they have their uh
[55:14] you know their little bible studies and
[55:16] they they give to the poor they they uh
[55:20] go to their Bible schools they become
[55:22] Scholars but the word can't fully manage
[55:25] manifest itself in them you know the
[55:28] moment the word comes forth what do they
[55:30] do they shoot it down with their own
[55:32] ideas they shoot it down with her own
[55:34] thoughts
[55:36] and um you know that God can't have
[55:39] preeminence in that amen God can't have
[55:42] preeminence in his
[55:44] word and someone who just wants to do
[55:47] their own thing yeah
[55:50] amen amen amen do you love the Lord amen
[55:55] so so uh uh you know the moment the word
[55:59] comes
[56:00] forth they want to shoot it
[56:03] down and they start to compromise
[56:06] they're scared going to to offend
[56:08] somebody but God is looking for someone
[56:11] of his character God is looking for
[56:13] someone who's going to uh surrender
[56:16] everything that's within them to to uh
[56:19] God is looking for someone that's not
[56:20] going to back down God is looking for
[56:23] someone who's not going to compromise
[56:25] with the word someone who can stand and
[56:28] say Amen to every word of God you say
[56:31] well I'm not worthy but the blood has
[56:33] made you
[56:34] worthy Jesus said you have not chosen me
[56:37] but I have chosen you and no man can
[56:40] come unto me unless the father first
[56:42] draws him so that little tug for God
[56:45] Isn't just something that you've that
[56:46] you've Merit yourself that little tug
[56:49] from God is calling you to him Amen
[56:52] brother brandham says by forn knowledge
[56:54] the infinite God who knowed all things
[56:57] saw the lamb and he slayed the lamb
[57:00] before the foundation of the world and
[57:02] he put your name on the Lamb's Book of
[57:04] Life and he seen the deceitfulness of
[57:07] Satan what he would do so he put your
[57:10] name on there and he said that the
[57:13] Antichrist would be so religious so good
[57:16] such a fine fellow such a smart man such
[57:19] a religious man that he would deceive
[57:21] the very elect if it were possible but
[57:24] it isn't possible because their names
[57:27] were for ordained before the foundation

[59:07] Christ yes sir like the little Eagle in
[59:10] the barnyard you know that little Eagle
[59:12] was always an eagle he was born an eagle
[59:16] no matter how many times he tried
[59:17] clucking around like a chicken no matter
[59:20] how many times he tried stomaching their
[59:22] food when he heard Mama's call that was
[59:25] it that was good enough for him he knew
[59:27] right then and there where he belonged
[59:29] when he he knew he was different he knew
[59:32] he he you know he knew he couldn't cluck
[59:34] just right he knew he couldn't you know
[59:36] walk just right and oh that he was the
[59:38] Laughing stalk of all the chickens and
[59:40] he knew that there had to been something
[59:42] different why was he this way why was he
[59:44] that way but when he heard Mama scream
[59:47] he knew that there was something greater
[59:49] there was something beyond the the
[59:52] chicken yard amen there was something
[59:54] beyond the
[59:56] graveyard amen and the next thing you
[59:58] know maybe he began to stretch his wings
[1:00:01] oh they made sure he knew the days of
[1:00:03] Miracles was passed oh they made sure to
[1:00:06] tell him that oh that was just brother
[1:00:07] brenham's opinions but he didn't pay
[1:00:10] them no attention he knew there was a
[1:00:12] higher calling amen he knew who he was
[1:00:17] he knew there was something Beyond man's
[1:00:19] ideas and man's Creeds amen he but when
[1:00:23] he heard the call he put his faith into
[1:00:25] action he set his wings to The Winds of
[1:00:28] faith and he flew higher and higher
[1:00:31] until the the barard
[1:00:33] Disappeared prise God Amen and that's
[1:00:36] the same thing with us today they took
[1:00:39] Luther's message and twisted it they
[1:00:41] took Wesley's message and twisted it
[1:00:44] and there's a lot of eagles sitting
[1:00:46] amongst them that there's got to be
[1:00:49] something more there's got to be
[1:00:51] something there's just got to be
[1:00:53] something different and man you know
[1:00:55] what that just don't sound right you
[1:00:56] know that that's just wasn't what uh
[1:00:58] Luther said that just wasn't what uh
[1:01:01] Wesley said and here they begin to twist
[1:01:03] here they begin to pull this idea and
[1:01:06] pull that idea and but when he heard
[1:01:09] Mama scream
[1:01:11] amen uh he sent a message in this day
[1:01:15] that and let out a big scream and came
[1:01:17] out and said come out of her my
[1:01:20] people come out of that filth of that
[1:01:23] denominational ideas come out of Egypt
[1:01:26] amen there's a l land I've prepared for
[1:01:29] you prise God Amen I see people today
[1:01:32] are trying to get the word to fit them
[1:01:34] and what they think to fit their ideas
[1:01:37] instead of getting themselves to fit the
[1:01:40] word that's that's what our issue is a
[1:01:42] lot of our issues
[1:01:44] today it's people don't want to change
[1:01:46] themselves to fit what the word says
[1:01:48] true amen you can't change the
[1:01:50] word you have to form yourself to the
[1:01:53] word yes amen and Christ being the
[1:01:55] unadulterated word can't be married or
[1:01:58] identified to an idea that wasn't so
[1:02:00] from the beginning amen there were had
[1:02:03] there we were made for Christ brother
[1:02:04] brandham says not Christ made for us uh
[1:02:07] we were made for Christ and we can only
[1:02:10] become one with God our Heavenly
[1:02:12] bridegroom by the word amen he's making
[1:02:15] himself known to us by his word amen
[1:02:18] Galatians
[1:02:19] 1:8 says but though we are an angel from
[1:02:24] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[1:02:27] than that which we preached unto you let
[1:02:29] him be accursed
[1:02:30] yes as we said before so I say now again
[1:02:34] if any man preach any other gospel unto
[1:02:37] you than that ye have received let him
[1:02:40] be a curse you can't mix oil and water
[1:02:44] you can't mix the word with ideas that's
[1:02:46] contrary to God's word amen only through
[1:02:50] this message can Christ the bride Christ
[1:02:52] and the bride become one only through
[1:02:54] this message the original word only this
[1:02:57] pure word can Christ become one with his
[1:02:59] bride amen this message this message was
[1:03:03] our bridegroom's call amen do you
[1:03:05] believe that this message was our
[1:03:07] bridegroom's call and you say well well
[1:03:09] how can that well you know you say well
[1:03:11] you know how do we know that that's true
[1:03:14] how do we know that God called brother
[1:03:16] brandom to be our to be our our Prophet
[1:03:19] how do how do we know because it was
[1:03:21] Vindicated by God you know you take
[1:03:24] Moses says and you take
[1:03:25] balam for an example both of them were
[1:03:28] prophets brother brandham says because
[1:03:30] they were both called of God both met
[1:03:33] God both talked with God and both
[1:03:35] Spirit-filled the difference between
[1:03:38] Moses and balum is both Moses balam
[1:03:41] answered to a King answered to King BAC
[1:03:44] and Moses answered to God Moses had the
[1:03:47] pillar of fire with them proving that
[1:03:49] God was with them that God had chosen
[1:03:51] that generation amen B wanted balam to
[1:03:55] come and curse Israel and balam being a
[1:03:58] prophet of God sought the will of God so
[1:04:01] he did he did what he was supposed to as
[1:04:03] a prophet he sought the will of God to
[1:04:06] curse God's people so he went to God and
[1:04:09] said you know Lord can I curse your
[1:04:11] people you know and the Lord says no
[1:04:14] they're My Chosen generation leave them
[1:04:15] alone you know yeah and God said no
[1:04:19] they're you know they're my people but
[1:04:21] the prophet says that balam didn't like
[1:04:23] Israel see when I heard that that
[1:04:25] floored me I mean it really stomped me
[1:04:28] was God chose God had a prophet Moses
[1:04:31] and he had a prophet balum yeah and yet
[1:04:34] balum didn't like Moses he didn't like
[1:04:37] the children of Israel he didn't like
[1:04:39] God's chosen people yeah God Called
[1:04:42] balum to be his Prophet you know you
[1:04:44] know and when and when Bao offered balum
[1:04:48] a higher position he became greedy he
[1:04:51] began to compromise and it's the same
[1:04:54] it's the same thing today Matthew 24:24
[1:04:57] says for there shall arise false christs
[1:04:59] and false prophets and shall show you
[1:05:02] great signs and wonders in so much that
[1:05:05] if it were possible it shall deceive the
[1:05:06] very elect so just just you know as God
[1:05:09] LED Moses and Israel God's chosen
[1:05:11] generation through the Wilderness by the
[1:05:13] power uh by the pillar of fire and every
[1:05:15] step of the way so is it in this day
[1:05:18] that God is leading his chosen
[1:05:20] generation you and I for this day by the
[1:05:23] word through a prophet amen that Pillar
[1:05:26] of Fire didn't burn out when Moses got
[1:05:28] to Israel that Pillar of Fire didn't
[1:05:30] burn out when when they thought maybe
[1:05:33] they reached the promised land but that
[1:05:35] Pillar of Fire is still with the prophet
[1:05:37] today am me with his people today amen
[1:05:41] God was in God was pleased in so much
[1:05:44] that he had his picture taken with our
[1:05:46] Prophet to to let you and I know that
[1:05:48] this is the way that this is the truth
[1:05:51] that this is the life amen
[1:05:54] amen just as eleazer came and was
[1:05:58] looking for a bride for uh Isaac so our
[1:06:02] elaser came today pointing us to Jesus
[1:06:05] Christ pointing us to the something
[1:06:07] higher there is something greater than

[1:06:37] through a prophet he said his word comes
[1:06:39] through a
[1:06:40] prophet amen that's why we got that's

[1:12:33] you it's pretty lengthy so just uh just
[1:12:37] have to
[1:12:38] listen he says here not long ago in the
[1:12:41] city of
[1:12:42] Rome Rome is a great City for art and
[1:12:45] there had a school of art there and
[1:12:48] several of our American Young
[1:12:50] Folks go over there every year to take a
[1:12:54] a year or two's training in art to learn
[1:12:57] to paint a
[1:12:59] picture learn to paint pictures there
[1:13:02] was a group of young Americans came over
[1:13:04] here a few years ago as the story was
[1:13:07] told me and when they came over there
[1:13:10] they just went hogw when they're in Rome
[1:13:12] they they do as Rome does they get out
[1:13:15] and drink they strip themselves and
[1:13:16] everything else and carry on both boys
[1:13:19] and
[1:13:21] girls and there was a certain School
[1:13:23] scho and in this school this group of
[1:13:26] young Americans came over and every one
[1:13:28] of them almost did the same thing but
[1:13:30] one certain little girl she wouldn't
[1:13:33] tolerate it at all she stayed in at
[1:13:35] night time she read while she was uh
[1:13:38] while they were all out drinking daytime
[1:13:40] she worked she studied well she was just
[1:13:43] the laughing stock of the whole
[1:13:45] school and she kept herself like a lady
[1:13:48] conducted herself like a lady although
[1:13:51] there were young Roman boys and
[1:13:52] everything around trying to get her to
[1:13:54] go out she refused it no sir she stayed
[1:13:58] right with her lessons learning to draw
[1:13:59] and to paint rather and she stayed with
[1:14:02] it finally finally an old konian at the
[1:14:07] place kept watching
[1:14:09] her seeing she was so much different
[1:14:12] although he was a Roman Catholic kept
[1:14:14] watching her and how she conducted
[1:14:16] herself one evening the young girl in
[1:14:19] the park where the studio was why or the
[1:14:22] place where the they had school she
[1:14:24] walked out upon the campus and went up
[1:14:27] towards the top of the hill and the sun
[1:14:29] was setting and she was standing up
[1:14:31] there with her pretty clean face and her
[1:14:33] hair hanging
[1:14:34] down looking across the way towards the
[1:14:38] setting of the
[1:14:39] Sun the old konian was raking down there
[1:14:44] in the
[1:14:44] yard he kept watching the girl as he
[1:14:47] rake something just kept telling him go
[1:14:49] talk to her so he laid his rake down
[1:14:52] took off his old slouch hat walked up to
[1:14:55] where the young lady was and cleared up
[1:14:58] his throat and she turned around he said
[1:15:00] pardon me Miss she said yes certainly he
[1:15:04] said notice he had noticed she had been
[1:15:06] crying all the rest was out in a big
[1:15:09] spree for the night he said Madam I hope

[1:24:24] there's none like him there's just none

[1:24:49] the men on the road to emus that
[1:24:52] just walking downhearted and sad and
[1:24:56] they were looking at Jesus in a day gone
[1:24:59] by and yet there was Jesus walking with
[1:25:02] them all along and they never recognized
[1:25:05] him but then he began to take him
[1:25:07] through all the scriptures concerning to
[1:25:10] himself and then he acted as though he
[1:25:13] was going to keep on walking as they
[1:25:15] turned in and they begged him to invited
[1:25:18] him to turn in
[1:25:20] and brother br said he must have done
[1:25:23] something the way he broke that bread
[1:25:25] the way he done something it opened
[1:25:27] their
[1:25:28] eyes and I believe with all of my heart
[1:25:31] he's done it again in this age he's
[1:25:33] opened our eyes amen we're no longer
[1:25:37] walking with him not knowing what he is
[1:25:39] and who he is but our eyes have been
[1:25:42] truly opened and we can truly say
[1:25:44] there's none like him do you love the
[1:25:48] Lord amen I I certainly love the Lord
