[46:06] over the house of God let us draw near
[46:10] with a True Heart in full Assurance of
[46:13] Faith having our hearts sprinkled from
[46:16] an evil conscience and our bodies washed
[46:18] with pure water let us hold fast the
[46:21] profession of our faith without wavering
[46:24] for he is faithful
[46:26] that promise amen let's just bow our
[46:29] heads and talk to our Lord
[46:33] father indeed you are worthy you have
[46:36] shown that you're worthy in this age
[46:40] Lord to loose the seals
[46:44] thereof father to show that you have
[46:47] redeemed us and you're claiming now that
[46:52] Redemption uh that work Lord uh the sub
[46:55] objects of your Redemption and Lord
[46:59] we're just thankful to be part of it and
[47:01] we're just asking now that you would
[47:04] Minister to US minister to every need
[47:09] anoint both speaker and hearer is our
[47:11] prayer those that are uh not able to
[47:15] make it whether it's sickness or out of
[47:18] town traveling we pray that you would
[47:20] keep them Father heal them and Lord uh
[47:25] just ask your anointing would be upon
[47:27] both speaker and hearer we ask it in
[47:30] Jesus Christ's name amen you can have
[47:34] your seats this
[47:36] evening and um I guess the title that I
[47:40] would have was we have a great high
[47:43] priest and um you know the Bible tells
[47:47] us without faith it is impossible to
[47:49] please
[47:50] God then Jesus tells us that all things
[47:53] are possible to them that believe so
[47:56] faith of course uh is is as we know is
[48:00] essential um for us in the Christian
[48:03] walk and God God wants us to believe in
[48:06] him he wants us to believe his word and
[48:10] uh but as the prophet told us that faith
[48:14] faith must have something solid to rest
[48:17] upon uh and so we're not just uh uh
[48:21] resting in our faith in
[48:23] anything uh uh for there's nothing solid
[48:27] outside the word of God um uh there just
[48:31] nothing solid outside of God uh God is
[48:36] eternal his word is eternal God and His
[48:40] word is the same for he is the word
[48:42] ain't that right he is all powerful
[48:45] therefore his word is all powerful he is
[48:48] supreme his word is supreme he will
[48:51] never be defeated and his word will
[48:54] never be defeated
[48:56] and and so you we to have faith in God
[48:59] we'd have to have faith in his word to
[49:00] have faith in his word we'd have to have
[49:02] faith in God uh you you can't separate
[49:06] the the the two uh because God never
[49:09] does anything outside of his own word
[49:13] amen and so this is why it's so
[49:15] important that we know the word of God
[49:17] and believe the word of God because God
[49:19] whatever the word of God says amen
[49:22] that's what God does he backs it up and
[49:25] and so uh therefore our our faith uh uh
[49:29] is resting upon the word of God God
[49:32] manifests himself uh through and by his
[49:37] his word but faith cannot rest in
[49:40] anything natural it it uh faith cannot
[49:43] rest in in natural man it cannot rest in
[49:46] natural works of man it cannot rest in
[49:49] the knowledge of natural men faith it it
[49:52] cannot rest in the natural life of a man
[49:55] uh or or an animal it cannot rest in the
[49:58] natural blood of a man or or an animal
[50:03] uh Faith must rest in God and God Alone
[50:07] ain't that right and so then when we
[50:10] look at Christ uh Jesus Christ was none
[50:14] other than God himself uh manifested In
[50:18] the Flesh the Bible says that the
[50:20] fullness of God uh was uh dwelt in him
[50:25] bodily amen so then our faith can rest
[50:29] in Jesus Christ that's that's where our
[50:31] faith is for the Bible says every
[50:33] promise in him is yay and amen it's it's
[50:37] it's it's something that is solid um and
[50:41] and the Bible says that Jesus Christ is
[50:43] the same yesterday today and forever so
[50:47] there he's got that Eternal quality for
[50:49] he was godm made flesh ain't that right
[50:53] amen so so uh uh then we we find that
[50:57] the Apostle Paul uh uh tells us that
[51:01] Jesus Christ is our high priest and and
[51:06] which which means that God became our
[51:09] high priest uh in his own human body uh
[51:14] Christ Jesus ain't that right amen 2
[51:18] Corinthians 5:18 and all things are of
[51:21] God uh who hath reconciled us to himself
[51:25] by Jesus Christ and ha given to us the
[51:30] ministry of reconciliation to it that
[51:33] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[51:37] to himself amen God became flesh amen
[51:41] Jesus Christ is none other than God a
[51:45] ain't that right and so uh uh then God
[51:49] became the true sacrifice in Christ
[51:52] Jesus God became the true altar in Jesus
[51:56] Christ God became the true door Amen in
[52:00] Jesus Christ God um uh became the living
[52:04] bread in Jesus Christ everything that
[52:08] that Christ that we see the
[52:10] manifestation of Christ amen God was
[52:14] that in Jesus Christ amen so then our
[52:18] faith can rest Amen in in Christ Jesus
[52:23] and his work of reconciliation because
[52:27] it wasn't just a man bringing
[52:29] reconciliation it was God in Christ
[52:33] reconciling the world to himself ain't
[52:36] that right amen so then this
[52:38] reconciliation is true it's a it's a
[52:41] sure thing because God will never fail
[52:44] whatever God does it's it's their uh uh
[52:48] it's it's Everlasting amen so in the Old
[52:52] Testament God uh types uh um himself um
[52:57] or spoke of himself in types and shadows
[53:01] amen it's prophetic of what God would do
[53:04] in Christ Jesus and and the prophet said
[53:07] God never asked a man to do anything him
[53:11] uh anything or something that he
[53:13] wouldn't do himself and and so then when
[53:17] we we look at at what men done and what
[53:20] God had men to do in the Old Testament
[53:23] it was only to show what God was going
[53:25] to do in uh uh himself in Christ Jesus
[53:30] amen so uh uh in the Old Testament for
[53:33] example Aaron uh uh the brother of Moses
[53:37] uh was ordained of God to be a high
[53:40] priest amen and and you you you can read
[53:44] that there in Exodus 40 and13 and uh uh
[53:48] but the name Aaron means very high amen
[53:52] that's the meaning of Aaron very high
[53:54] and and he he stood Supreme as the high
[53:58] priest um very high above his own house
[54:02] and and exalted uh uh Of course house is
[54:06] family amen but uh and and he was
[54:09] exalted above the people in that he was
[54:13] the position that he held it it was a
[54:15] high priest and and Aaron as as that be
[54:20] he was the type of of Jesus Christ what
[54:23] God would be in Jesus Christ and uh the
[54:26] Bible says that Jesus Christ was exalted
[54:29] to the right hand of the father and and
[54:32] so if if you notice that Jesus is called
[54:36] the high priest but he's not just high
[54:39] priest but but Paul would call him the
[54:42] great high priest amen and and which
[54:45] which means that he would it it showed
[54:48] his superiority even above Aaron Aaron
[54:52] had superiority over the people of isra
[54:55] Israel in in in his office and over his
[54:58] family but Jesus was the greater than
[55:01] than Aaron he was the greater of all
[55:03] priests ain't that right so he is the
[55:06] great high priest for for God become
[55:10] high priest in Christ Jesus amen and so
[55:14] uh uh but but we find that that Aaron
[55:18] amen uh uh God uh ordaining him to be in
[55:22] that office of high priest it means that
[55:25] he was to be a mediator uh an
[55:28] intercessor between God and his people
[55:32] and and so I I looked up that word
[55:34] mediator it is one who intervenes
[55:37] between two either in order to make or
[55:40] restore peace and friendship or form a
[55:44] compact or for ratifying a covenant a
[55:47] medium of
[55:49] communication uh an arbitrator amen so
[55:53] uh uh this is what God was was wanting
[55:56] amen between the people uh with Aaron uh
[56:00] between the people of Israel and God
[56:02] there would be a high priest and that
[56:04] would be Aaron that would Medi mediate
[56:07] and and intercede and and between God
[56:11] and the people a mediator also is to act
[56:14] as a mediator between leg um uh lit
[56:21] litigating uh uh or coveting parties uh
[56:24] there to accomplish something by
[56:26] interposing between two parties to
[56:28] mediate so so the Bible says that the
[56:32] high priest uh was um he he was to offer
[56:36] sacrifices and gifts to God on behalf of
[56:39] the people to bring
[56:42] reconciliation now you think of that
[56:45] that that this was all in God's plan and
[56:48] and again he wouldn't ask a man to do it
[56:50] if he wasn't going to do it himself but
[56:52] God would show through types and Shadow
[56:55] is of what he had in mind so now of of
[56:58] Christ it is said in in Hebrews
[57:02] 2:17 wherefore in all things it behooved
[57:05] him to be made like unto his Brethren a
[57:09] aen amen that he might be a merciful and
[57:14] faithful high priest in the things
[57:17] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[57:20] for the sins of the people aren't you
[57:24] glad for that
[57:25] amen see so peace and fellowship between
[57:29] man and God shows that a
[57:32] Reconciliation had had been made amen
[57:36] but if you notice in the Old Testament
[57:38] that the high priest could not make
[57:41] intercession uh uh uh without the
[57:44] shedding of blood amen according to
[57:47] Hebrews 13:11 the the blood of animals
[57:50] was brought into the
[57:51] sanctuary uh by the high priest for sin
[57:55] so this is what the high priest would do
[57:57] Slay Slay the animal and and then he
[58:00] would offer up that blood take that
[58:03] blood and enter into the the the the the
[58:07] sanctuary Amen to offer up uh to the
[58:11] people as and mediate between the people
[58:14] and God and so it it the high priest uh
[58:18] had to be anointed in order to go in and
[58:21] then he had to take amen the blood of
[58:23] that animal or he would die he'd have to
[58:26] take that with him amen or or he would
[58:29] perish amen so that tells us that there
[58:32] can be no intercession without blood it
[58:36] takes blood amen for there to be an
[58:39] intercessor ain't that right amen blood
[58:42] is the only thing that will appease God
[58:45] Amen is is and we find that even with
[58:48] Cain when he offered up uh his own uh uh
[58:52] uh from The Works of the ground and what
[58:55] he had planted and things and and and he
[58:58] offered that to God but it was rejected
[59:00] and but yet God would receive abble
[59:03] sacrifice because there was blood on the
[59:06] altar ain't that right amen see so in 2
[59:10] Chronicles 29 and 23 it says they
[59:13] brought forth the heig goats for the sin
[59:16] offering before the king and the
[59:18] congregation and they laid their hands
[59:21] upon them and the priest killed them and
[59:23] they made
[59:25] reconciliation with their blood upon the
[59:27] altar to make an atonement for all
[59:31] Israel now we we know this uh we talked
[59:34] about it before but I'm going to go into
[59:36] it just a little bit amen but why does
[59:39] it take blood why is there there has to
[59:42] be blood in order for there be to be
[59:45] reconciliation now we want
[59:47] reconciliation with God and God is the
[59:50] only one that knows what it will take
[59:52] for man to be reconciled unto him ain't
[59:56] that right and so through again through
[59:58] the types and shadows amen we could
[1:00:01] study it and we could look and how that
[1:00:03] God would never allow a high priest just
[1:00:05] to go in amen and and mediate without
[1:00:08] there being a a blood that was shed amen
[1:00:12] well when man partook of the knowledge
[1:00:15] of the tree of Good and Evil amen he was
[1:00:19] separated from God and there was a gap
[1:00:22] aen between him and God and and and not
[1:00:25] really just not a natural Gap so to
[1:00:28] speak but his his understanding and his
[1:00:33] his his well the holy nature of man uh
[1:00:36] of God uh Le the holy image of God left
[1:00:40] man when he had sinned and so he become
[1:00:43] carnal in his nature and he was
[1:00:45] separated from his fellowship with God
[1:00:47] he couldn't understand God couldn't
[1:00:49] couldn't know God aen you give him a
[1:00:52] Bible and he would never understand it
[1:00:54] he he just didn't understand he couldn't
[1:00:57] even even understand by Nature anymore
[1:00:59] and and God through nature because his
[1:01:02] his his he was so separated and he he
[1:01:06] was separated from the life of God and
[1:01:09] the prophet said that when he fail it it
[1:01:11] brought death to his soul amen see and
[1:01:15] so uh in Genesis 2 and 17 God said to
[1:01:20] man in the day that thou eatest amen uh
[1:01:24] uh th th shalt surely die amen that thou
[1:01:28] shalt die and and and then in Romans 5
[1:01:32] And1 12 Paul said wherefore as by one
[1:01:35] man sin entered into the world and death
[1:01:39] by sin so death passed upon all men for
[1:01:44] that all have sinned ain't that right so
[1:01:47] then you find even in the New Testament
[1:01:50] it talks about how that we were all uh
[1:01:52] dead in sins and in trespasses so so sin
[1:01:57] brought death amen and and and so and
[1:02:01] and of course death as we talked brother
[1:02:04] Brown tells us death represents is it
[1:02:07] means uh separation if you die
[1:02:09] physically then you're separated from
[1:02:12] those that are alive here on this Earth
[1:02:14] you're separated from your family your
[1:02:16] loved ones and and and if you die
[1:02:18] spiritually if there's a spiritual death
[1:02:20] then you you're separated from God your
[1:02:23] very own Creator ain't that right amen
[1:02:26] so so uh God would tell him you know the
[1:02:29] day you eat this the day you're going to
[1:02:31] die amen and and and and that was when
[1:02:35] he was cut off the separation and and of
[1:02:38] course that death wasn't only speaking
[1:02:41] of of spiritual death in which we were
[1:02:44] separated from God but it also speaks of
[1:02:48] physical death amen see When sin entered
[1:02:51] into the world then disease and and
[1:02:54] sickness entered into the world and and
[1:02:57] as F bef Bosworth said that disease is
[1:03:00] aient of is aient death in other words
[1:03:04] it is death beginning to set in when
[1:03:07] diseases and sickness and it it just
[1:03:10] lets us know that death amen uh uh is is
[1:03:14] present and and and uh uh it is the
[1:03:17] reality of death and and so the physical
[1:03:21] death and spiritual death is the result
[1:03:24] of of sin of what man done in in the
[1:03:27] beginning ain't that right and so every
[1:03:30] man has tried to escape death they have
[1:03:33] they have tried to reconcile themselves
[1:03:35] to a peace that they once known amen
[1:03:38] they have tried to recogn uh reconcile
[1:03:41] themselves to the joy that man once knew
[1:03:44] they tried to reconcile themselves to
[1:03:46] their creator a man that that they once
[1:03:49] had fellowship with and they they try
[1:03:52] everything they they have even tried to
[1:03:54] reconcile themselves Amen to living
[1:03:56] again and and they're trying to live
[1:03:59] young you know you everyone's trying to
[1:04:02] find that that way of life and to to
[1:04:04] where they could live uh uh longer and
[1:04:07] stay young and and all of these things
[1:04:10] and and so that has been the desire of
[1:04:12] man is to make life better and and these
[1:04:15] things and and so but but they've never
[1:04:18] been able to find the joy that that once
[1:04:21] that they were separated from they've
[1:04:22] never been able to find the peace that
[1:04:25] they were separated from they've never
[1:04:27] been F able to find the contentment and
[1:04:29] and all of these things because they're
[1:04:31] spiritually dead a ain't that right see
[1:04:35] man cannot have fellowship with his
[1:04:37] creator while he is spiritually dead now
[1:04:41] I I thought you know uh uh when we think
[1:04:44] of it uh how sin has affected Us in so
[1:04:47] many ways in a a man man is a Triune
[1:04:52] being he's Body Spirit and soul amen so
[1:04:56] then sin didn't just affect uh uh the
[1:05:00] soul of man but it affected the Triune
[1:05:03] being of man the the the whole of man
[1:05:06] body spirit and and soul ain't that
[1:05:08] right his entire being and and and I
[1:05:12] just believe that man was not only made
[1:05:15] to live eternally in his soul but I
[1:05:18] believe that he was made to live
[1:05:20] eternally in his body as as well for you
[1:05:24] you you see your soul is what you are
[1:05:28] but but you'll never be without a body
[1:05:30] amen it's uh uh for God put you in in in
[1:05:36] uh your body ain't that right and so man
[1:05:39] cannot be complete without soul body and
[1:05:43] spirit ain't that right and and and so
[1:05:46] then uh uh then then sin if sin can
[1:05:49] affect us in our body and can affect
[1:05:52] affect us in our spirit and our soul
[1:05:55] then God can surely come up with a
[1:05:58] remedy to restore not only our soul but
[1:06:01] to restore our body and to restore our
[1:06:04] spirit and and and and these things but
[1:06:08] we find that that right after man fell
[1:06:11] God uh uh uh sought um and and revealed
[1:06:17] his desire to reconcile man and again he
[1:06:21] and and and and scriptures all in this
[1:06:23] Bible
[1:06:24] tells us that that and shows us that God
[1:06:27] determined to not just reconcile the
[1:06:30] soul of man but he would reconcile the
[1:06:33] the the whole Triune being of man body
[1:06:36] Soul and Spirit and and so but in order
[1:06:40] to bring this reconciliation he had to
[1:06:43] take away sin amen he had to take away
[1:06:47] that sin ain't that right because see
[1:06:50] reconciliation is to bring back
[1:06:53] Fellowship between man and God
[1:06:55] reconciliation is to bring back uh uh
[1:06:58] wholeness Amen in the man to where he
[1:07:01] can talk to God and and have that peace
[1:07:04] and have that joy and have that
[1:07:06] everything that he fell from and lost
[1:07:10] that is to be reconciled back ain't that
[1:07:13] right so he has to take away the sin
[1:07:16] amen see and and and so when sin is
[1:07:19] taken away death has no more power over
[1:07:23] us amen when he can take away the sin
[1:07:26] spiritual death physical death it has no
[1:07:30] part over us anymore aren't you glad for
[1:07:33] that amen see so amen and and we know
[1:07:37] that he not only redeemed our soul but
[1:07:39] he redeemed our body as well amen but
[1:07:43] but get rid of the sin God had to get
[1:07:45] rid of the sin as as we said you know uh
[1:07:49] if you if you're fighting you know let's
[1:07:51] just say a bear and the bear has come
[1:07:53] out uh against you uh you know it ain't
[1:07:55] going to do you any good just to cut off
[1:07:57] its Paul amen you know uh uh cuz it can
[1:08:01] still fight amen the best thing to do is
[1:08:03] knock it in the head and and when you
[1:08:05] knock it in the head you you've knocked
[1:08:07] out all the paws you've knocked out
[1:08:09] everything amen see you've killed the
[1:08:12] whole body ain't that right so God
[1:08:14] sought for a remedy to knock sin in the
[1:08:18] head amen and destroy that thing once
[1:08:21] and for all over man kind a ain't that
[1:08:25] right so so 1 John 3 and5 the Bible says
[1:08:30] you know that he was manifested Amen to
[1:08:33] take away our sin and in him is no sin
[1:08:37] so that is why Jesus Christ was
[1:08:39] manifested is to take away sin take away
[1:08:44] our sins and our unbelief ain't that
[1:08:47] right when sin is taken away then
[1:08:50] whatever sin affected can now uh uh be
[1:08:55] delivered and restored unto us amen the
[1:08:58] power of sin loses its hold amen and now
[1:09:03] we're back to re restoration but there
[1:09:06] had to be an atonement Amen in order for
[1:09:09] man to be reconciled see so so the
[1:09:13] atonement would be the thing that would
[1:09:15] kill sin amen and destroy that thing
[1:09:19] utterly amen now I thought about that
[1:09:22] word atonement means to make amends for
[1:09:25] wrongdoing or guilt it's it's a
[1:09:28] Reconciliation in the Old Testament the
[1:09:30] word atone means to cover amen so God
[1:09:34] knew God had already purposed in his
[1:09:36] mind what he was going to do to to break
[1:09:39] the power of sin he was going to produce
[1:09:42] an atonement ain't that right amen he
[1:09:45] was going to produce that amen see and
[1:09:48] so uh uh uh in in Genesis
[1:09:52] 3:15 uh God talking to the serpent
[1:09:56] foretold of the atonement uh for man he
[1:10:00] said I will put imity between thee and
[1:10:03] the woman and between thy seed and her
[1:10:06] seed and it shall bruise thy head and
[1:10:09] thou shalt bruise his heel amen the
[1:10:12] prophet said see bruising his heel
[1:10:14] showing that there would be Affliction
[1:10:16] to the church but he promised Triumph
[1:10:20] ain't that right but but the woman seed
[1:10:23] would would bruise the Serpent's head
[1:10:26] amen uh and and the prophet said bruise
[1:10:29] means to make an atonement amen God
[1:10:32] would make an atonement and that
[1:10:34] atonement would kill and knock Satan in
[1:10:37] the head ain't that right amen see and
[1:10:40] so then we find that Satan has
[1:10:42] constantly he constantly watched for
[1:10:45] that seed and sought to destroy it amen
[1:10:49] he's looked for it all through the Old
[1:10:51] Testament and looked for it amen up to
[1:10:54] Jesus's time and and trying to destroy
[1:10:57] that that seed that would bruise his
[1:11:00] head amen see now uh uh until that seed
[1:11:04] came that seed didn't come right
[1:11:07] automatically but until that seed God
[1:11:09] provided a temporary
[1:11:13] propitiation amen uh uh for for us
[1:11:16] aren't you glad for that amen amen and
[1:11:19] he shows what it would be everything
[1:11:21] that we see it's in Genesis three and
[1:11:24] six and when woman saw that the tree was
[1:11:26] good for food that it was pleasant to
[1:11:28] the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[1:11:31] make one wise she took of the fruit
[1:11:34] thereof and did eat and go and gave also
[1:11:39] un to her husband with her and he did
[1:11:42] eat and the eyes of them both uh uh were
[1:11:46] open and they knew that they were naked
[1:11:49] notice what they done and they solded
[1:11:52] fig leaves together and made themselves
[1:11:55] aprons now we know it was a self-made
[1:11:57] covering amen again uh uh they were
[1:12:01] doing trying to do it without God's help
[1:12:04] ain't that right amen they they were
[1:12:06] trying to do it to where God wouldn't
[1:12:08] recognize their condition amen see and
[1:12:11] and and so uh the Bible there eighth
[1:12:14] verse and they heard the voice of the
[1:12:16] Lord God uh Walking In The Garden in the
[1:12:19] cool of the day and Adam and his wife
[1:12:22] hid them eles the thing that they
[1:12:25] thought would help them meet God's
[1:12:28] presence meet him amen when he they
[1:12:31] started to come in condemnation hit them
[1:12:35] and they ran and hid from the presence
[1:12:38] of the Lord among the Trees of the
[1:12:41] garden so the prophet said see Adam
[1:12:44] tried to have a super religion amen
[1:12:47] without blood see and atonement for his
[1:12:51] sins ain't that right that the the Fig
[1:12:53] leaves couldn't be an atonement for sins
[1:12:56] amen only the blood could be an
[1:12:59] atonement see so they're covering that
[1:13:03] super religion that they tried it
[1:13:05] couldn't take away the condemnation from
[1:13:07] them and as long as they were condemned
[1:13:10] they couldn't come boldly into the
[1:13:13] presence of God ain't that right and and
[1:13:15] and notice the sin their conversations
[1:13:18] changed their attitude changed the their
[1:13:21] confidence was taken away all of these
[1:13:23] things but then God in his Mercy amen
[1:13:28] would provide an atonement would provide
[1:13:31] a
[1:13:32] covering for them there in Genesis 3:21
[1:13:37] and Adam also and to his wife did the
[1:13:40] Lord God make coats of skin and clothe
[1:13:45] them ain't that right it showed there
[1:13:48] that God created something he I I I know
[1:13:53] that the the the we know that the fall
[1:13:55] of Adam was not a mistake amen uh God
[1:13:58] knew it it it it it wasn't you know
[1:14:01] going to SL didn't slip God's mind it
[1:14:03] didn't come and surprise God God had
[1:14:07] already provided a way to cover amen
[1:14:12] Adam and Eve you think of that he took
[1:14:15] what he had already created he didn't
[1:14:18] have to create something new it was
[1:14:20] already there amen God knew what he
[1:14:23] would do and he took that lamb a a skin
[1:14:26] he slew that lamb and clothed them with
[1:14:29] the skin of that lamb which was a proof
[1:14:33] amen that the blood had been shed for an
[1:14:38] atonement for his children he covered
[1:14:42] them with the bloody skin of the lamb
[1:14:44] and the prophet says let's look through
[1:14:46] that window and he says I see them
[1:14:48] running through the garden and blood
[1:14:50] dripping amen as that the Skins flapping
[1:14:53] against their legs and the blood
[1:14:55] dripping it was a bloody lamb ain't that
[1:14:58] right it was a bloody covering it was a
[1:15:00] bloody skin amen yes sir now the prophet
[1:15:04] said see the church wants to perform
[1:15:07] through their Creeds amen and see how
[1:15:09] many members they can get but God wants
[1:15:13] to perform through the power of the
[1:15:15] blood amen see to get Christians born
[1:15:19] again you can't do anything without the
[1:15:21] blood it takes the blood aren't you glad
[1:15:23] for the blood amen that would cover us
[1:15:27] now in in in Exodus uh 30 and 10 it says
[1:15:32] and Aaron shall make an atonement upon
[1:15:35] the horns of it once in a year with the
[1:15:38] blood of the sin offering of atonements
[1:15:42] he shall make an atonement this is what
[1:15:45] the high priest was going to do as the
[1:15:48] mediator amen between God and the people
[1:15:51] he would be the one to make make the
[1:15:53] atonement amen and bring the blood
[1:15:56] before the Lord now so why was the blood
[1:15:59] required Amen to answer this and and uh
[1:16:03] uh hopefully uh I can we can make some
[1:16:06] sense with it but uh Exodus 21 and 23 uh
[1:16:11] starting there and if any Mischief
[1:16:13] follows then Thou shalt give Life For
[1:16:18] Life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand
[1:16:21] for hand foot for for foot burning for
[1:16:24] burning wound for wound stripe for
[1:16:26] stripe amen so this is the law of God
[1:16:29] life for life ain't that right in other
[1:16:32] words Blood for Blood amen see so uh God
[1:16:37] required blood now now people say well
[1:16:40] that the sin in the garden they they say
[1:16:42] it was the fruit you know a Eve ate an
[1:16:44] apple and or you know apricot or or
[1:16:48] whatever and and and so they they've got
[1:16:51] this idea that it was that that she her
[1:16:54] and Adam partook of a literal fruit from
[1:16:58] a literal fruit tree amen and and uh uh
[1:17:03] then if if that be the case then it
[1:17:05] would have to be eye for eye Blood for
[1:17:07] Blood tooth for tooth then then
[1:17:09] Redemption would come by eating an apple
[1:17:12] or or an apricot or or some fruit amen
[1:17:16] see but but that's not the case as we
[1:17:18] know for God told man to multiply and
[1:17:22] replenish the earth and the law of God
[1:17:25] was that every seed was to bring forth
[1:17:29] of its kind well Adam was the spoken
[1:17:33] word of God Amen and he was to bring
[1:17:36] forth of his kind ain't that right so he
[1:17:39] was to bring forth spoken word children
[1:17:42] amen and and uh he was a created son he
[1:17:46] was not a begotten son like Jesus was
[1:17:49] the Bible says of Christ that he was the
[1:17:51] only begotten son of God but Adam was
[1:17:54] the spoken word Son of God ain't that
[1:17:56] right Jesus come through the womb of uh
[1:18:00] a virgin womb amen so so Adam was to
[1:18:04] bring forth Sons like unto himself which
[1:18:07] would be by the spoken word of God but
[1:18:10] instead of doing that he brought forth a
[1:18:13] perverted life amen and that by sex so
[1:18:17] it was sex blood that brought forth that
[1:18:20] perverted life amen and and so when Adam
[1:18:24] sinned he fell from his position he fell
[1:18:27] from uh Authority he had no power he was
[1:18:30] just a carnal man uh uh couldn't speak
[1:18:35] to the winds he couldn't he ran you know
[1:18:38] to find shelter and and and all of these
[1:18:41] things and so he had not the power
[1:18:43] within him to fulfill the word of God
[1:18:47] for now he had died amen that death had
[1:18:50] began to set in amen and the holy image
[1:18:53] of God had left him so he could not
[1:18:56] bring forth were children because of his
[1:19:00] Fallen condition and he took upon
[1:19:03] himself a sinful nature ain't that right
[1:19:06] so instead of us being born as sons of
[1:19:08] God we were born as sons of Adam amen
[1:19:12] with having that adamic nature and the
[1:19:15] Bible says that all have sinned and and
[1:19:17] come short of the glory of God ain't
[1:19:20] that right amen it says that we all were
[1:19:23] born in sin shaping in iniquity and or
[1:19:26] or conceived in sin and speaking lies
[1:19:29] and and all of these things and we all
[1:19:32] have the uh that that old adamic nature
[1:19:35] ain't that right so the Bible says by
[1:19:37] one man sin entered into the world and
[1:19:42] death by sin and so death passed upon
[1:19:47] all men amen see so it it if we could
[1:19:51] say it this way it was was blood that
[1:19:54] took man out of the garden amen see it
[1:19:57] was blood that separated man from God it
[1:20:01] was sex blood can you say Amen sex life
[1:20:04] and and and these things so in order to
[1:20:07] reconcile man to back to God and to
[1:20:10] bring him to eternal life blood had to
[1:20:14] be
[1:20:15] shed amen blood had to be shed amen and
[1:20:19] in Hebrews 9 and 22 without the shedding
[1:20:23] of blood there is no remission ain't
[1:20:27] that right you know it it's somehow that
[1:20:30] you know we we talk
[1:20:32] about uh uh uh denominations and things
[1:20:35] but a lot of them are taking the blood
[1:20:37] out of their song books they've taken
[1:20:39] the blood out of everything anymore they
[1:20:41] built it around programs they built it
[1:20:44] around a lot of things amen but the
[1:20:46] problem is is there is no remission for
[1:20:49] sins without the blood there is no
[1:20:51] reconciliation back to God without the
[1:20:53] blood ain't that right see so then uh no
[1:20:57] remission and and that word remission
[1:21:00] means Deliverance pardon Freedom amen
[1:21:04] Liberty amen there is no Deliverance
[1:21:06] without blood no pardon with no liberty
[1:21:09] no no no nothing without the blood amen
[1:21:14] so there had to be life taken in order
[1:21:17] for the blood to be shed amen and and
[1:21:20] life had to be taken in order for the
[1:21:23] power of death spiritually and
[1:21:24] physically to be broken ain't that right
[1:21:28] now uh Leviticus 17 And1 says the life
[1:21:33] of the flesh is in the blood and he says
[1:21:36] I have given it to you uh uh God
[1:21:39] speaking upon the altar to make an
[1:21:42] atonement for your souls for it is the
[1:21:44] blood that maketh an atonement for the
[1:21:47] soul the life of the flesh is in the
[1:21:51] blood ain't that right
[1:21:53] amen see so the Life In The Blood amen
[1:21:57] and and so uh we we find that that uh uh
[1:22:02] brother Bram says Abel by Revelation
[1:22:04] knew that it was blood that took them
[1:22:06] out of the garden it was sex blood that
[1:22:09] took them out and and so he said see by
[1:22:12] faith Abel saw that it was sex blood see
[1:22:15] the blood cell comes from the male the
[1:22:18] blood has or the man has the blood cell
[1:22:20] in the sperm and the hogl
[1:22:23] is is the blood comes through the mail
[1:22:25] and Abel knowed that it wasn't apples
[1:22:28] peaches potatoes or whatever it was that
[1:22:30] brought them out of the Garden of Eden
[1:22:32] that caused the sin it was sex blood and
[1:22:35] he offered blood back can you say amen
[1:22:40] he saw that it was a sexual Affair
[1:22:42] Through Blood and another place brother
[1:22:45] Braham says life doesn't lay in Plants
[1:22:48] it lays in blood so blood had to be
[1:22:53] offered as a substitute because the
[1:22:56] Bloods where the life laid and God
[1:22:59] required life at
[1:23:02] sin can you say Amen so then sin's
[1:23:06] judgment is to take life life for life
[1:23:11] amen see and so then we find that the
[1:23:14] blood that the high priest brought
[1:23:17] before the Lord showed that life had
[1:23:20] been taken as a substitute for
[1:23:24] mankind so then then that that that that
[1:23:27] man uh uh Aaron and the priest after him
[1:23:31] in his lineage amen they had a natural
[1:23:34] blood of an animal amen and and brought
[1:23:37] it before God but they had to keep doing
[1:23:39] that every year doing it every year
[1:23:41] because that blood was not sufficient
[1:23:44] enough to reconcile man back to God Amen
[1:23:49] uh uh and so there had to be it was only
[1:23:51] a covering or if you could say it rode
[1:23:53] their sins ahead it just you know and
[1:23:56] and when man left amen the the
[1:23:58] worshipper left amen uh to go back home
[1:24:02] he was still a sinner he was still
[1:24:03] whatever he was he was still under that
[1:24:06] curse of sin a ain't that right still
[1:24:09] had that old nature in all of them
[1:24:11] things but see so we also find that not
[1:24:14] only the the high priest had to have
[1:24:16] blood to go in to mediate but the
[1:24:19] worshipper had to have blood amen he had
[1:24:21] to have that lamb uh the prophet said
[1:24:24] that he had to lay his hands upon his
[1:24:27] sacrifice and as the priest was slic it
[1:24:31] slit that throat and and the the the the
[1:24:34] the lamb the life of that lamb was
[1:24:36] leaving its body blood was squirting
[1:24:39] everywhere as and it was getting all
[1:24:40] over all over that that worshipper amen
[1:24:44] because he he had to be
[1:24:47] identified that was the only way amen is
[1:24:50] when the blood of that sacri rice came
[1:24:52] up on the believer amen then it showed
[1:24:55] he was identified with his sacrifice in
[1:24:59] other words he couldn't just say okay
[1:25:01] here priest I'm going to give you this
[1:25:02] and I'll be back in an hour let see if
[1:25:05] it all went okay no no no he had to be
[1:25:07] right there amen wherever the blood was
[1:25:10] he had to be amen for that blood to come
[1:25:12] back upon him can you say Amen now now
[1:25:16] this was a precious thing Amen to them
[1:25:19] because they wanted to have fellowship
[1:25:21] with God Amen they they they wanted to
[1:25:23] appease God and and so it was a precious
[1:25:27] thing amen that when God would would
[1:25:29] Institute this a high priest with blood
[1:25:32] and a sacrifice with blood Amen to where
[1:25:36] they could be covered Amen in The Exodus
[1:25:39] first Exodus uh the children of Israel
[1:25:42] had to paint the blood of of the Lamb
[1:25:45] upon the doorpost literal blood had to
[1:25:47] be literal shown public display amen and
[1:25:51] they had to get under the blood they had
[1:25:54] to be under the blood in order for the
[1:25:56] the death angel to pass them by because
[1:25:59] if the death angel saw that there was no
[1:26:00] blood amen then he could have power to
[1:26:03] to put death in that home ain't that
[1:26:06] right see so the prophet said see the
[1:26:09] the blood identified that the worshipper
[1:26:11] had slain the lamb and accepted the lamb
[1:26:15] see the worshipper accepted the lamb see
[1:26:19] uh uh uh he had he he had he had faith
[1:26:22] in that lamb he had had faith in that
[1:26:25] blood that lamb and it showed the blood
[1:26:29] being upon him that he had accepted the
[1:26:31] sacrifice see and applied the token to
[1:26:34] himself that he was not ashamed he
[1:26:37] wasn't ashamed of that blood he wasn't
[1:26:39] ashamed of that atonement he wasn't
[1:26:41] ashamed of his sacrifice see amen he
[1:26:45] didn't care who saw it he wanted
[1:26:47] everybody to see it it was placed in
[1:26:49] such a position that everybody passing
[1:26:52] by could see that token aren't you glad
[1:26:55] for that amen see and so could you
[1:26:58] imagine the high priest being ashamed of
[1:27:00] his sacrifice could you imagine if that
[1:27:03] high priest was ashamed and and didn't
[1:27:06] really believe in the power of the blood
[1:27:08] amen and says forget that you don't have
[1:27:10] to you don't have to have a lamb let's
[1:27:12] just try it on our own no if I was that
[1:27:14] worshiper i' tell that high priest oh no
[1:27:16] no no we want blood in this thing we
[1:27:18] want blood in our religion ain't that
[1:27:21] right amen we want blood see but we find
[1:27:25] that the blood of the animal it it was
[1:27:27] not sufficient to redeem us back to God
[1:27:31] it was a lower life than what was
[1:27:33] required amen for the the blood the life
[1:27:37] uh that flows in the blood of an animal
[1:27:40] uh it's just animal life amen and so uh
[1:27:43] it it doesn't match the human life it
[1:27:46] had no soul so it its life couldn't come
[1:27:49] back upon the worshipper so the
[1:27:51] worshipper went away still contaminated
[1:27:54] with perverted life amen and so the sin
[1:27:59] was still there because of the life
[1:28:02] being contaminated amen and and so the
[1:28:05] prophet said see the reason the animal
[1:28:07] life couldn't give them the Holy Ghost
[1:28:10] is because the animal the life that was
[1:28:12] in that animal when that life was taken
[1:28:15] it was just animals life and it would
[1:28:17] not coincide to the human life because
[1:28:20] the animal has not not a
[1:28:23] soul ain't that right so it could not
[1:28:26] come back upon on the on on the
[1:28:28] worshipper it just was there for a
[1:28:31] temporary
[1:28:33] covering but everything that was being
[1:28:36] done in the Old Testament was only
[1:28:39] pointing to something else
[1:28:41] greater that's true God would be
[1:28:44] something perform something greater and
[1:28:47] he would do it
[1:28:49] himself ain't that right amen so so
[1:28:52] Hebrews 10:1 says for the law having a
[1:28:55] shadow of good things to come not the
[1:28:58] very image of the things can never with
[1:29:01] those sacrifices which they offered year
[1:29:03] by year
[1:29:04] continually it can never make the comers
[1:29:07] there unto perfect for then would they
[1:29:10] had not have ceased uh to be offered see
[1:29:15] uh uh because that the worshippers once
[1:29:17] purged should have no more conscience of
[1:29:20] sins but in those sacrifices there is a
[1:29:23] remembrance again made of sins each year
[1:29:26] for it is not possible everybody say
[1:29:28] it's not possible that the blood of
[1:29:31] animals and of goat should take away
[1:29:33] sins where wherefore when he cometh into
[1:29:36] the world he says sacrifice and offering
[1:29:38] thou wouldest not but a body thou Hast
[1:29:42] prepared me God would prepare himself a
[1:29:46] body ain't that right and in that body
[1:29:50] he would fulfill it all
[1:29:53] so he says see in burnt offerings and
[1:29:56] sacrifices for sin thou Hast had no
[1:29:58] pleasure for it was only a temporary
[1:30:03] solution ain't that right and yet so it
[1:30:07] it could not be by animal blood that
[1:30:10] would would would reconcile man Even
[1:30:13] though God would allow that to be
[1:30:16] temporarily used until the true seed
[1:30:19] came until that perfect lamb came but
[1:30:23] then also we could not be reconciled by
[1:30:26] human blood amen amen see sex blood it
[1:30:31] that that wasn't powerful either it it
[1:30:34] wasn't able to redeem us there's a lot
[1:30:36] of people that have shed their blood
[1:30:38] amen for for friends for family for
[1:30:42] worthy causes for an Amer for America
[1:30:44] for Nations and and all these things and
[1:30:48] and yet it's not redeemed man to God
[1:30:50] it's not helped it's not it's because
[1:30:52] it's human blood amen sex blood ain't
[1:30:55] that right so the prophet speaking of
[1:30:58] Christ said if his blood was Earthly
[1:31:02] then it was no more than mine and
[1:31:05] yours right if it was if if his blood
[1:31:08] was just a human
[1:31:10] blood then then there's if that blood
[1:31:13] come from through sexual desire in other
[1:31:16] words amen then it was no good it it
[1:31:19] couldn't be any good than you and I
[1:31:21] ain't that right
[1:31:22] so but his blood notice his blood was
[1:31:25] the blood of his father which was the
[1:31:28] great Creator Jehovah now this is to me
[1:31:32] powerful and you know it's it's it's
[1:31:34] hard to imagine that people really don't
[1:31:36] believe in the Virgin birth there's
[1:31:38] there's many that don't believe in the
[1:31:39] Virgin birth or they believe that Mary
[1:31:42] had something to do with it but Mary had
[1:31:44] nothing to do with
[1:31:46] this aren't you glad for that amen Luke
[1:31:50] 1:35 the angel said to Mary the Holy
[1:31:52] Ghost shall come upon on thee and the
[1:31:54] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:31:57] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[1:32:01] which shall be born of thee shall be
[1:32:03] called The Son of God so God created a
[1:32:08] blood cell within the womb of Mary and
[1:32:12] that blood cell from that blood cell
[1:32:16] came the man Jesus Christ ain't that
[1:32:20] right so brother Brown said see there
[1:32:23] could not be a woman connected into it
[1:32:27] if there was then his body was after his
[1:32:31] mother
[1:32:32] Mary you know brother brandham he he had
[1:32:35] gotten this this this uh uh as he was
[1:32:39] preaching one service he just kind of
[1:32:41] got a revelation of it and he said did
[1:32:43] you know he's this I think coming fresh
[1:32:45] or something like that but he says Mary
[1:32:47] was not the mother of Jesus as everybody
[1:32:51] says and he said then you'll never find
[1:32:52] it in the Bible that Mary was the mother
[1:32:55] of Jesus when Mary and John there he was
[1:32:58] on the cross and and Mary and John is
[1:33:00] saying there and and and and he he said
[1:33:04] uh what what do he call it John Behold
[1:33:05] thy mother or something to that effect
[1:33:07] see and he would call her woman but
[1:33:10] never did you f you find in the Bible
[1:33:12] that that Mary was the actual mother of
[1:33:16] of Jesus Christ she she was the
[1:33:19] incubator can you say man God B her
[1:33:22] womb to to to create himself a body see
[1:33:29] so uh brother Bram said see if if Mary
[1:33:32] had something to do with it then she
[1:33:34] would have had to have had a sexual fair
[1:33:37] with the spirit overshadowing her that
[1:33:40] caused her to discharge a sperm but
[1:33:43] that's
[1:33:44] wrong can you sayen see so he says in
[1:33:49] another place the Holy Ghost by
[1:33:50] immaculate
[1:33:52] conception Hallelujah there he created
[1:33:56] both sperm of man and
[1:33:59] woman that word Immaculate means pure
[1:34:03] perfectly
[1:34:05] clean and that's what he was it was the
[1:34:09] Immaculate Conception can you say Amen
[1:34:13] so then Jesus was neither Jew nor
[1:34:16] Gentile he was God so then Hebrews 10
[1:34:20] and 10 it says by the which will we are
[1:34:25] Sanctified we are Sanctified through the
[1:34:28] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:34:31] once for all aren't you glad for that
[1:34:35] once for all it's settled no need for
[1:34:39] priests to keep coming and offering a
[1:34:43] lamb come on and every priest standeth
[1:34:47] daily ministering he's now talking of
[1:34:49] the Old Testament priest every priest
[1:34:52] standeth daily ministering and offering
[1:34:54] oftimes the same sacrifices which can
[1:34:57] never take away sins but this man after
[1:35:00] he had offered one sacrifice for sins
[1:35:03] forever sat down on the right hand of
[1:35:05] God from henceforth expecting till his
[1:35:08] enemies be made his foot stol for by one
[1:35:11] offering everybody say by one offering
[1:35:14] he hath perfected forever them that are
[1:35:19] Sanctified so it isn't sex blood that
[1:35:21] redeemed us it's not human blood that
[1:35:24] that loosed us from sin amen but notice
[1:35:28] acts 2028 take heed therefore unto
[1:35:32] yourselves and to all the flock over
[1:35:34] which the Holy Ghost hath made you
[1:35:35] overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:35:38] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:35:45] blood God's own blood yes sir can you
[1:35:48] say
[1:35:49] amen God became Flesh and
[1:35:52] Blood aren't you glad for that amen so
[1:35:56] so then you're Redeemed by the blood of
[1:35:58] God right and the prophet said his blood
[1:36:01] everybody say his blood is the only
[1:36:04] thing that will make
[1:36:06] atonement it's God's only way yes
[1:36:10] sir hallelujah oh I'm so glad for that
[1:36:13] yes sir Hebrews 13 and 12 wherefore
[1:36:16] Jesus also that he might sanctify the
[1:36:19] people with his own blood suffered
[1:36:22] without the gate Revelations 1:5 and
[1:36:25] from Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[1:36:27] witness and the first begotten of the
[1:36:29] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[1:36:31] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[1:36:34] us from our sins in his own blood loosed
[1:36:43] us true that's right what a great high
[1:36:48] priest not only did he become our lamb
[1:36:51] not only
[1:36:52] became create his own
[1:36:55] blood but he became our great high
[1:36:59] priest making intercessions now you
[1:37:02] can't get any greater of a high priest
[1:37:04] than God
[1:37:06] himself can you say amen amen
[1:37:10] interceding such is the power of this
[1:37:14] Blood you know uh Roman or Hebrews 9
[1:37:18] And1 Christ being come and high priest
[1:37:21] of good things to come by a greater and
[1:37:24] more perfect Tabernacle not made with
[1:37:27] hands that is the say not of this
[1:37:30] building neither by the blood of goats
[1:37:32] and calves but by his own blood he
[1:37:36] entered in once to the holy Place into
[1:37:41] once into the holy Place notice having
[1:37:44] obtained Eternal Redemption for
[1:37:47] us that's right he entered the the holy
[1:37:53] place that's right by a greater
[1:37:58] blood a greater voice a greater
[1:38:01] Testament presenting something greater
[1:38:04] before the father yes aren't you glad
[1:38:06] for that yes
[1:38:08] sir for if the blood of bulls and of
[1:38:11] goats and the ashes of an hepher
[1:38:13] sprinkling the unclean sanctify the
[1:38:15] purifying of the flesh how much more
[1:38:18] shall the blood of Christ who through
[1:38:21] the eternal spirit offered himself
[1:38:23] without spot to God Purge your
[1:38:25] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[1:38:28] Living God for this cause he is the
[1:38:31] mediator of the New Testament or New
[1:38:34] Covenant that by means of death for the
[1:38:38] Redemption of the transgressions that
[1:38:41] were under were under the first
[1:38:43] testament they which are called might
[1:38:46] receive the promise of Eternal
[1:38:50] inheritance aren't you glad for
[1:38:53] that I'm so glad that God's provided a
[1:38:58] blood and has become our great high
