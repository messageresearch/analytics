[42:56] pray over him anointing him with oil in
[43:00] the name of the Lord
[43:02] and the prayer of faith everyone say the
[43:04] prayer of faith shall save the sick and
[43:08] the Lord shall raise him up and if he
[43:11] have committed sins they shall be
[43:14] forgiven him
[43:16] amen you can now have your seats
[43:20] amen
[43:21] I um
[43:24] of course I've been talking on prayer
[43:29] and
[43:31] why we should pray
[43:34] and
[43:36] James here talks about the prayer faith
[43:40] and I think that just right off at any
[43:44] prayer should be a prayer of faith
[43:47] for the Bible says when we uh he that
[43:50] cometh to God must believe that he is
[43:53] and that he is rewarder of them that
[43:55] diligently seek him so
[43:57] no prayer is effective without faith
[44:01] but it is important that we pray
[44:05] um
[44:06] first Thessalonians 5 17
[44:09] we've read this before but Paul would
[44:12] tell us pray
[44:14] without ceasing
[44:17] uh wrong scripture
[44:20] but uh pray without ceasing and so
[44:23] brother Branham said every day
[44:26] you're bound to sin and you're bound to
[44:29] be backsliding constantly so it takes a
[44:33] constant prayer
[44:34] to God takes a constant prayer so prayer
[44:39] is is something that should be a part of
[44:42] our lives on a daily basis you you I I
[44:46] don't think that prayer could be over
[44:48] emphasized there's a lot of things we
[44:51] can over emphasize but prayer is
[44:53] something you cannot brother Brown said
[44:56] you can never pray too much you can do a
[44:58] lot of things too much but not pray too
[45:00] much and even Jesus who knew no sin
[45:05] he he had to spend much time the prophet
[45:09] said in prayer
[45:11] and the reason was is to stay in
[45:15] fellowship with the spirit that was in
[45:18] him of course we know that God was in
[45:22] Christ and so he he Jesus kept in
[45:25] fellowship and that's that's every one
[45:28] of us prayer is is a a way to keep in
[45:32] fellowship with God
[45:34] and brother Branham said if you only
[45:36] knew what prayer meant
[45:39] sometimes when you're in prayer God
[45:41] changes the complete destination of
[45:45] different things that's going to happen
[45:48] he said do you believe that might be
[45:50] something fixing to happen and your
[45:52] prayer could change the whole situation
[45:55] well you say if God knows it's going to
[45:58] happen what would my prayer do
[46:01] and then he goes back and and where
[46:04] Jesus stood looking up on the Harvest
[46:06] and Jesus of course was the lord of the
[46:09] Harvest and he said the Harvest is ripe
[46:12] the laborers are but few pray ye the
[46:15] lord of the Harvest that he will send
[46:16] labors into his harvest in other words
[46:19] you prayed to me that I will send
[46:22] laborers into my Harvest which I'm
[46:24] telling you it's such a needy thing
[46:28] but again part of it lays in human
[46:31] beings
[46:32] he said see the kingdom of God lays
[46:35] within the human being ain't that right
[46:39] so we we have a part of God's plan we
[46:43] have a part in God acting and that is by
[46:47] prayer prayer is if if if if if it seems
[46:51] like things are dormant in your life
[46:53] pray
[46:55] God moves in prayer
[46:58] and and so uh uh but notice notice the
[47:03] relationship
[47:04] that our prayer should uh if if I could
[47:07] say it be based upon uh
[47:12] the the kind of relationship that you
[47:15] have will determine the kind of prayer
[47:18] life the prayer life the the uh the the
[47:23] anticipation expectation that you have
[47:26] with your prayer and in Luke 11 and 1
[47:31] the disciples asked Jesus to teach them
[47:35] how to pray
[47:36] and and so Jesus would say uh when you
[47:42] pray say our father can you say that
[47:45] with me our father
[47:47] Our Father we chart in heaven Hallowed
[47:50] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[47:54] done as in heaven so in Earth ain't that
[47:57] right
[47:58] but the key uh uh there's a lot there in
[48:02] that that prayer that we could go into
[48:04] but but to think of how he told us to
[48:07] start it out or the relationship is our
[48:10] father
[48:11] approaching God as our father so we do
[48:13] not come to him in prayer
[48:16] um as anything else but as a son and
[48:21] daughter of God
[48:23] and and that's the relationship uh that
[48:27] that we should have and our prayer is to
[48:31] express that kind of relationship
[48:34] now if this age is the age of the
[48:38] manifestation of sons and I I believe it
[48:41] is for then then in in this age we have
[48:46] been restored back Amen to where God is
[48:52] behind what we say Do you believe that
[48:56] if if we're back to being Sons and
[48:59] Daughters of God which and and the
[49:01] manifestation of sons and brother
[49:03] Branham talks about this I believe in
[49:06] depth in in the adoption series as as as
[49:09] well is in the messages hear ye him he
[49:13] talks about this adoption and of course
[49:15] other messages but then uh brother
[49:19] Branham here in 1960. brother Branham
[49:22] said the world and nature is groaning
[49:24] crying everything's moving what for the
[49:28] manifestation of the sons of God when
[49:31] true Sons born Sons feel Sons speak and
[49:36] their word is backed
[49:39] ain't that right
[49:41] I believe we're on the border of it
[49:43] right now yes sir say to this mountain
[49:46] and let it be sold brother I desire so
[49:49] and so a certain thing done I'm a
[49:52] Believer in Jesus Christ well I give it
[49:54] to you in the name of Jesus uh name of
[49:57] the Lord Jesus Christ see there's a
[50:00] manifestation oh my brother my crops are
[50:03] burning uh out yonder I haven't had any
[50:05] rain well I'll send you rain in in the
[50:08] name of the Lord God bless your crop oh
[50:11] see waiting groaning on nature waiting
[50:14] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[50:17] God ordained it at the beginning and he
[50:20] gave man the domain ain't that right so
[50:24] uh um then brother Branham goes right
[50:27] after that and and he uses uh John 16 23
[50:32] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[50:37] my name he will give it to you ain't
[50:41] that all right so so we're back to a a
[50:45] place of position where the Sons and
[50:48] Daughters of God are being manifested
[50:50] and their words their very own words are
[50:53] being backed by God now if we believe
[50:56] that if we truly believe that our words
[50:59] are so important to God Amen that what
[51:03] we would say then he will come behind
[51:06] that and back that up then it should
[51:09] give us a courage it it should give us a
[51:13] desire to pray more
[51:15] to pray more to know that God our words
[51:19] matter
[51:20] then you say man our words matter and
[51:23] and so a a a a Praying church that's
[51:27] been positionally placed has the
[51:30] authority in their prayer ain't that
[51:34] Ryan a church that's been positionally
[51:36] placed has Authority in praying now
[51:40] Galatians 4 and 4 Paul says but when the
[51:44] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[51:46] his son made of a woman made unto the
[51:49] law to redeem them that were under the
[51:52] law that we might receive the uh uh
[51:57] adoption of sons and because your sons
[52:00] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[52:04] into your hearts crying Abba Father
[52:07] wherefore everybody say wherefore Thou
[52:10] Art no more a servant but a son and if a
[52:17] son then an heir of God through Christ
[52:20] can you say Amen so this is where we're
[52:24] at is no longer children no longer
[52:27] servants but we are Sons
[52:31] can you say that with me I'm a son I'm a
[52:34] daughter see I I I am I am in this
[52:39] position that I am an heir of all things
[52:43] ain't that right so then notice he
[52:46] became me death that I might become him
[52:50] life
[52:51] he became a sinner that I might become
[52:55] his righteousness he became poor that I
[52:59] might through his poverty amen be made
[53:02] Rich he became what I was so that by his
[53:07] grace I might become what he is can you
[53:11] say man now then brother Brown says then
[53:13] talk about the powers of God Amen the
[53:17] powers of God are not somewhere A
[53:19] Million Way Yonder up in heaven the
[53:23] powers of God is in the church
[53:26] do you believe that now First John 3 and
[53:29] 1 John would tell us behold what manner
[53:32] of love the father hath bestowed upon us
[53:36] that we should be called denominational
[53:39] believers
[53:40] that we should be called churchgoers
[53:43] that we should just be settled down with
[53:45] religion I don't think so the whole what
[53:50] Manner what kind of love the father hath
[53:53] bestowed upon us that we should be
[53:56] called the sons of God
[53:58] can you say Amen so we are not servants
[54:01] can you say that I am not a servant now
[54:04] brother Branham said the Gentile church
[54:06] was never a servant amen see the Gentile
[54:09] church is Sons and Daughters of God who
[54:13] have received the Holy Ghost
[54:16] even though you were under tutors and
[54:19] governors you were still a son of God
[54:22] ain't that right even though you were
[54:24] you were under the beggarly elements a
[54:27] man and and was just no more you
[54:29] differed no more than a servant there
[54:32] comes a time that you are a son of God
[54:35] now God has always saw you as his son
[54:37] amen but now he has recognized you and
[54:41] given an adoption of sonship
[54:43] [Music]
[54:45] and you say Amen
[54:48] we're Sons so who has the most power was
[54:52] God it's not an angel
[54:54] for an angel is a servant they are only
[54:58] God's servants and you you and I are his
[55:01] sons and daughters you have to believe
[55:04] that you're a son you have to believe
[55:05] you're a daughter of God see a sinner
[55:08] who has been graced uh saved by grace
[55:10] the prophet said has the most power in
[55:13] heaven than an archangel that's standing
[55:16] right by his side
[55:19] he's constantly in the presence of God
[55:21] and yet he has no more power it doesn't
[55:25] give him any more power for the power
[55:27] has been given unto you
[55:30] I give unto you power he never gave that
[55:33] to that Archangel that's standing right
[55:36] by his presence but he looked at the
[55:38] children of God his own children and
[55:40] said I give unto you power to tread upon
[55:43] the serpents and the Scorpions and and
[55:45] all of these things
[55:47] can you say Amen so a son has more
[55:50] Authority than the servant he has more
[55:54] Authority in heaven than the servant
[55:57] because he is a son
[55:59] brother Graham said oh we forget what we
[56:02] are we forget many times what made us
[56:05] what we are after we become what we are
[56:08] then we forget how we got here but don't
[56:12] forget how you got here
[56:15] can you say Amen
[56:17] First Timothy 2 8 says I will therefore
[56:20] that men pray everywhere
[56:22] we talked about it that there is no
[56:24] certain place uh uh really to go to pray
[56:28] our home should be a a place of prayer
[56:31] the the church should be a place of
[56:33] prayer our car or you know you go out in
[56:37] the woods uh or anywhere and and and and
[56:41] and and pray it it it it should be a a
[56:44] prayer a man uh uh God on our mind all
[56:48] the time but Jesus stressed the
[56:50] importance of getting by herself to pray
[56:52] just you and God Alone can you say man
[56:55] we need that time Church
[56:58] getting away by yourself to God you and
[57:01] God Alone God yeah you need that now the
[57:05] prophet and we talked about it the the
[57:06] you know take time to pray don't don't
[57:09] don't don't uh uh uh uh uh don't get too
[57:13] busy to pray
[57:15] ain't that right don't get too in of a
[57:17] hurry Amen to where you don't pray amen
[57:20] uh you know remember the the Pharisee uh
[57:23] uh that invited Jesus to the banquet
[57:26] that he was having and and Jesus come at
[57:28] the invitation and and uh but yet he he
[57:33] slipped by amen the the uh the foot was
[57:36] flunk he and he was found in the corner
[57:39] with dirty feet he he was found in the
[57:41] corner unwelcome ain't that right and
[57:45] and see the prophet said see they didn't
[57:46] entertain him and they totally ignored
[57:50] him they were too busy
[57:52] are you with me they were too busy and
[57:55] he says that's what we are today we're
[57:58] too busy making proselytes too busy to
[58:02] see if this person's baptized correct or
[58:04] not we're too busy to see what position
[58:06] he has and what we can do with him in
[58:09] the church we're too busy with the
[58:11] people and the things of the church
[58:13] we're too busy making sure that
[58:15] everything's carried on just so and so
[58:17] can you say man and in doing this
[58:19] getting too busy we let Christ get by
[58:22] without entertaining him
[58:24] and he says we fail to entertain Jesus
[58:27] after we have invited him to our place
[58:29] many time you're too busy at home in
[58:32] your home life you got too many things
[58:35] you have to do and you can't take time
[58:37] to pray because you're too busy
[58:41] you see prayer is not just asking things
[58:44] that prayer is entertaining him
[58:49] can you say amen and that's what
[58:51] happened there is they did not entertain
[58:54] him
[58:56] amen so we we find that prayer is giving
[59:00] him the attention that he deserves
[59:04] can you say amen and how often he comes
[59:07] to our home and we don't acknowledge Him
[59:09] you know surely we we wouldn't be one to
[59:13] invite someone over for a company and
[59:16] and then when they get there we totally
[59:17] ignore them
[59:18] we don't acknowledge them we we ask them
[59:22] for supper and yet we we sit down and
[59:25] and and and and don't tell them to sit
[59:27] at the table we don't say welcome we we
[59:29] we we uh and then we all start eating
[59:33] and they're just sitting by the door
[59:36] how uncomfortable that would make
[59:39] someone feel
[59:42] it ain't that right
[59:44] well it's true and yet Jesus comes at
[59:49] our invitation
[59:51] all right
[59:52] and then when he comes we're too busy
[59:56] to entertain
[59:58] and you say Amen
[1:00:00] well Jesus will always go where he's
[1:00:02] invited ain't that right now you know I
[1:00:06] I want to look now the Bible tells us
[1:00:11] the kind of people that he is always
[1:00:13] with
[1:00:16] Psalms 145 and 18. it says the Lord is
[1:00:21] nigh unto them everybody says nine to
[1:00:24] them
[1:00:25] to all that call upon him in truth
[1:00:31] ain't that right the Lord is nine to
[1:00:33] them that all them that call upon him to
[1:00:36] all that call upon him in truth ain't
[1:00:39] that right so so praying in truth
[1:00:43] praying with the understanding of the
[1:00:47] word now now in in John 17 17 Jesus said
[1:00:52] Thy word is truth
[1:00:55] ain't that right amen it's not coming
[1:00:58] from a prayer book
[1:01:00] it's it's the truth is the word of God
[1:01:05] now I hope that we can all see just how
[1:01:09] blessed we are to have and to know what
[1:01:12] God has done in this age
[1:01:15] you see a man just doesn't stumble on
[1:01:18] the truth
[1:01:20] truth has to be revealed
[1:01:23] ain't that right yes we're still talking
[1:01:25] about prayer now but see without truth
[1:01:29] there is no judgment
[1:01:32] uh uh uh there there is no way to tell
[1:01:35] right from wrong
[1:01:36] uh without truth he Jesus could show up
[1:01:40] and you wouldn't even know him
[1:01:43] Prophet preached the the message the
[1:01:46] presence of God unrecognized
[1:01:48] ain't that right see and so now notice
[1:01:52] first John 5 14 and this is the
[1:01:54] confidence that we have in him that if
[1:01:57] we ask anything according to his will
[1:02:01] David ain't that right according to his
[1:02:04] will he heareth us and if we know that
[1:02:09] he hears us whatsoever we ask we know
[1:02:13] that we have the petition that we
[1:02:16] desired of him so that's the prayer of
[1:02:18] faith ain't that right see so knowing
[1:02:22] that we are praying according to his
[1:02:24] will knowing that he hears us knowing
[1:02:29] that we will have whatever we Petition
[1:02:32] of him then you say amen amen see but
[1:02:36] how could we tell the difference between
[1:02:39] the will of God and our own will without
[1:02:43] the truth
[1:02:45] how could we even begin to pray
[1:02:48] according to the will of God if there's
[1:02:51] no truth
[1:02:54] can you say Amen
[1:02:56] see so without truth we wouldn't even
[1:02:58] know how to pray or what to pray for our
[1:03:02] prayers think of it now without truth
[1:03:05] our prayers would be like a ship or an
[1:03:08] airplane without a rudder
[1:03:10] nothing to direct it nothing to control
[1:03:13] it
[1:03:15] ain't that right and our prayers would
[1:03:18] be a stenched to God and our lives would
[1:03:21] be an Abomination to him
[1:03:23] with that truth
[1:03:25] without truth we we would pray contrary
[1:03:29] to his will
[1:03:32] ain't that right
[1:03:34] now notice Ephesians 1 9 and and
[1:03:37] hopefully when we're done make some
[1:03:38] sense to you but Ephesians 1 9 having
[1:03:41] made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:03:43] will
[1:03:44] his Will's a mystery
[1:03:47] and he's made known unto us the mystery
[1:03:49] of his will according to his good
[1:03:51] pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:03:53] himself ain't that right so the truth
[1:03:55] everybody say the truth of his will has
[1:03:59] to be made known
[1:04:01] that pray according to his will if you
[1:04:03] if it's a mystery
[1:04:05] but when it's made known to us the truth
[1:04:08] of his will has to be made known to us
[1:04:11] talking about praying asking him truth
[1:04:14] right
[1:04:15] see calling upon him in truth if we
[1:04:18] didn't have truth how would we know what
[1:04:20] to ask and what to believe for see where
[1:04:23] there is no truth there is no
[1:04:25] understanding
[1:04:26] do you believe that a relationship with
[1:04:30] Christ must be guided by truth our
[1:04:33] progress in Christ must be guided in
[1:04:37] truth
[1:04:38] our prayers must be directed by truth
[1:04:44] do you believe it
[1:04:45] see our worship must be guided by truth
[1:04:51] Isaiah 59 and 14 tells us what happens
[1:04:55] when there is no truth judgment is
[1:04:58] turned away backward and just to
[1:05:01] standeth afar off for why truth is
[1:05:06] fallen in the streets
[1:05:08] the Broadway now looked it up the street
[1:05:11] Broad
[1:05:12] yes Broadway
[1:05:14] ain't that right broad is the way that
[1:05:16] leadeth to destruction
[1:05:18] truth is fallen in that way and equity
[1:05:21] and Equity cannot enter I looked up the
[1:05:24] word Equity it's the true things of
[1:05:26] Prophecy
[1:05:27] see so so truth is falling in the broad
[1:05:32] way and Equity the the the true things
[1:05:36] of Prophecy cannot enter ain't that
[1:05:38] right so in other words the word of God
[1:05:41] cannot have the preeminence because
[1:05:44] truth is falling
[1:05:47] the 15th verse yea truth failures and he
[1:05:50] that departeth from Evil maketh himself
[1:05:54] a prey well why is because there's no
[1:05:58] judgment between right and wrong
[1:06:01] and you say man we're living in needs of
[1:06:04] of uh they call that evil uh uh which is
[1:06:08] good and they call good uh evil so evil
[1:06:11] good and good evil ain't that right
[1:06:13] because truth faileth truth Flawless in
[1:06:19] the streets
[1:06:20] and the Lord saw it and it displeased
[1:06:23] him that there was no judgment there's
[1:06:26] no judgment in the churches today
[1:06:28] there's no judgment in in the nation
[1:06:30] today there's no judgment in the world
[1:06:32] and prayers are being offered
[1:06:36] prayer after prayer is being offered but
[1:06:39] it's not being offered according to
[1:06:41] truth
[1:06:42] [Applause]
[1:06:44] and you say Amen
[1:06:46] brother Branham in his prayer said
[1:06:47] father we pray that you'll associate our
[1:06:50] minds this morning into this truth the
[1:06:54] word and help us Lord that we may be
[1:06:57] able to understand better today how many
[1:07:00] wants to understand better amen we want
[1:07:03] to understand better amen and I'm gonna
[1:07:06] just say it amen that a PR a prayer from
[1:07:10] a son and daughter of God the far
[1:07:13] outweighs a Pentecostal prayer
[1:07:17] a Baptist prayer a Catholic prayer
[1:07:21] can you say Amen
[1:07:23] it's true
[1:07:26] so he says see when we leave uh that we
[1:07:29] might be able to understand better today
[1:07:31] when we leave this house of teaching
[1:07:33] that it might be good for our souls
[1:07:35] again the Lord is nigh unto all them
[1:07:38] that call upon him to all that call upon
[1:07:41] him in truth
[1:07:44] now at the world now I see a council
[1:07:50] brother Brown said the word lost its
[1:07:52] influence amongst the people
[1:07:55] and they all voted out the true word
[1:07:59] and took endogamous of discrepancy of
[1:08:02] the early Catholic Church
[1:08:04] they added a pope they added a bishop
[1:08:06] they added this that and the other they
[1:08:09] taken away the real true meaning of
[1:08:11] Peter and of Mary and all the rest of it
[1:08:14] made idols and made nothing but just a
[1:08:16] pagan ceremony out of all out of
[1:08:19] so-called Christian religion what was it
[1:08:22] it's the seed of discrepancy
[1:08:25] and organized and organized for the
[1:08:28] first time on earth a church what was it
[1:08:30] that seed of discrepancy started sowing
[1:08:33] something adding to and taken away ain't
[1:08:37] that right so brother Branham goes on
[1:08:39] who who another place whoever heard in
[1:08:42] the Bible not eating meat on Friday
[1:08:45] right whoever heard in the Bible of of
[1:08:48] anything uh sprinkling of of baptizing
[1:08:52] in Mercy
[1:08:54] whoever heard of those things Hail Mary
[1:08:56] or something who ever heard of some of
[1:08:59] this rotten tummy rot
[1:09:01] of these Protestants
[1:09:03] who whoever heard of some of these
[1:09:05] things that these apostolics hold on to
[1:09:08] whoever heard of such things as these uh
[1:09:12] Pentecostals hold on to
[1:09:15] come on you can amen it surely
[1:09:18] they hold the things and they teach it
[1:09:20] as though it's scripture
[1:09:22] and it's nothing more but a lie
[1:09:26] then you say amen that's right see and
[1:09:29] what they've done is they've driven God
[1:09:30] away from them
[1:09:32] do you believe that they've driven the
[1:09:34] presence of God away from them but the
[1:09:37] Lord is night after them that crawl upon
[1:09:41] him in truth in truth that's why it's so
[1:09:44] important don't you hold on to Creeds
[1:09:45] don't you hold on to dogmas don't you
[1:09:48] hold on to traditions
[1:09:50] it's truth
[1:09:52] now the truth has become a mystery
[1:09:56] and brother Bradham said there's a lot
[1:09:59] of Truth
[1:10:00] lost
[1:10:01] out there where others have compromised
[1:10:04] on Truth amen amen ain't that right
[1:10:06] another place he said people don't know
[1:10:08] the mystery of God the truth of God
[1:10:11] why they've not been taught the mystery
[1:10:14] of God the only thing they've been
[1:10:16] taught join Church put your name on the
[1:10:18] book
[1:10:19] be a good fella treat your neighbor
[1:10:20] right that's all right
[1:10:22] but then brother Brown said you must
[1:10:24] know everybody say you must know the
[1:10:27] mystery of God do you realize it's this
[1:10:30] message that brings you into
[1:10:31] relationship with God
[1:10:34] it's this message
[1:10:38] that brings the presence of God not far
[1:10:41] off but right now you
[1:10:46] amen ain't that right
[1:10:48] so you must know you must know the
[1:10:50] mystery of God
[1:10:54] Revelations 10 and 7
[1:10:57] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:10:59] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:11:01] sound
[1:11:02] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:11:05] you know what it means the ministry of
[1:11:07] God will be revealed as he hath declared
[1:11:10] to his servants the prophets
[1:11:12] then you say Amen so it was so important
[1:11:15] to God that you get truth it was so
[1:11:17] important to God that God uh sister
[1:11:19] Brendan would be able to walk with you
[1:11:21] and talk with you and have relationship
[1:11:24] with you but he had to restore truth to
[1:11:26] you
[1:11:27] he didn't want you living in an
[1:11:28] Abomination he didn't want you to live
[1:11:30] and pray and and sing and and serve and
[1:11:34] do all their religious duties and things
[1:11:36] outside of his will
[1:11:39] something contrary pray and no have no
[1:11:42] power with God serve God worship and
[1:11:45] have no power with God
[1:11:47] can you say Amen you realize how much
[1:11:49] worship is going on today and it has no
[1:11:51] meaning to God how many prayers are
[1:11:53] being offered and there has no meaning
[1:11:55] to God
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:11:59] [Music]
[1:12:02] Revelations 10 1 talks about the mighty
[1:12:05] angel coming to the Earth
[1:12:07] with an open book
[1:12:09] and you know these these quotes but
[1:12:12] brother REM said the first thing that
[1:12:13] represented that Redemption come the
[1:12:15] lamb that had been slain from the
[1:12:17] foundation of the world
[1:12:18] and he took the book Glory opened the
[1:12:21] book and tore off the seals and sent it
[1:12:23] down to the Earth to his seventh angel
[1:12:25] to reveal it to his people
[1:12:28] that's where the truth is it's in the
[1:12:30] open book
[1:12:31] to reveal it to his people that's that's
[1:12:33] where the mystery of God the truth of
[1:12:35] God is going to be finished and be
[1:12:37] revealed tie up all them loose ends
[1:12:40] can you say man
[1:12:42] notice he says the seventh the seventh
[1:12:44] angel in another place don't compromise
[1:12:46] on nothing he gathers all up all the
[1:12:49] Loose Ends and gathers them all up at
[1:12:52] and at his sounding all the mystery of
[1:12:54] God should be finished oh God sent him
[1:12:57] all of the Hidden Mysteries was finished
[1:13:00] when he see it was revealed to him by
[1:13:03] what if these are hidden mysteries the
[1:13:06] man will have to be a prophet
[1:13:09] amen
[1:13:11] amen
[1:13:13] see see I I hope you young people
[1:13:16] understand why we don't we don't delve
[1:13:18] into all the books
[1:13:20] there's a lot of Christian writers that
[1:13:22] are dealing that that deal with prayer
[1:13:24] that deal with marriage
[1:13:26] that deal with raising children that
[1:13:29] deal with dating courtship they they
[1:13:32] they've got man they got us so much
[1:13:35] yeah and yet none of that appeals none
[1:13:38] of that none of that Appeals
[1:13:40] because it had to come by profit
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:45] can you say amen I say to you a
[1:13:47] prophet's good enough
[1:13:50] don't need a psychologist to come in
[1:13:54] don't need counselors to come in
[1:13:56] the spirit of God back that Prophet up
[1:14:00] and he revealed the truth that God could
[1:14:03] walk with you restoring you back to
[1:14:06] relationship restoring you back to an
[1:14:08] Eden ain't that right
[1:14:11] see so a prophet is likened to an eagle
[1:14:14] because he can climb up where no one
[1:14:16] else can he can see things that no one
[1:14:19] else can
[1:14:20] brother Brown said the prophet Eagle is
[1:14:22] a revealer of the truth that's been
[1:14:24] Fallen all through the age
[1:14:28] another place the seventh angel disposes
[1:14:31] shows up makes plain the Hidden Truths
[1:14:35] that the seals had hid all these years
[1:14:39] through all those churches and
[1:14:42] denominations ain't that right another
[1:14:45] place the third pull was the opening of
[1:14:48] The Seven Seals to reveal the hidden
[1:14:51] truth that's been sealed in the word
[1:14:56] ain't that right
[1:14:57] we thank God for the first two pulls
[1:15:00] but that was not to bring the bride it
[1:15:03] was only to gather them it was only to
[1:15:06] catch the attention can you say man but
[1:15:09] the third pull is where the truth laid
[1:15:12] the third pull is where the Mysteries
[1:15:16] were revealed ain't that right yes sir
[1:15:20] so the Mysteries that were once hidden
[1:15:23] in the book are now divinely revealed
[1:15:27] Truth by the seventh angel messenger
[1:15:31] now brother Branham says now the book
[1:15:34] was so important that it is the word of
[1:15:36] God now watch and when the word of God
[1:15:39] is brought forth it's got to be brought
[1:15:41] by the prophet because that's who the
[1:15:44] word of God comes to every word of God
[1:15:47] is brought can you say that with me
[1:15:49] every word of God is brought the Bible
[1:15:52] doesn't change its system at all it's
[1:15:55] the same thing it's got to come to this
[1:15:57] Seer that we're expecting to arrive now
[1:16:00] notice uh Revelations 10 1-7 now
[1:16:04] remember there's no more Powers goes out
[1:16:08] after that eagle no more every time the
[1:16:12] Antichrist sent forth something God sent
[1:16:15] a power this Antichrist and another
[1:16:17] Power God sends something to combat it
[1:16:19] he said another Power God said something
[1:16:21] to combat it and then when he got down
[1:16:24] to the eagle that was his word back like
[1:16:27] it was in the first place there's no
[1:16:30] more
[1:16:31] there's no more need for anything
[1:16:34] ain't that right so then it's the word
[1:16:38] or the truth restored unto us right you
[1:16:42] believe it
[1:16:43] amen now notice brother Brown said with
[1:16:45] the restoration of the word will come
[1:16:47] the restoration of power
[1:16:49] power
[1:16:50] that's what this message does to us the
[1:16:53] revealed word the revealed truths it
[1:16:55] brings power to us
[1:16:57] as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:17:00] ain't that right
[1:17:02] now how do I know it's the truth
[1:17:05] well brother Brown said this if the
[1:17:07] truth is revealed the truth is also
[1:17:10] Vindicated
[1:17:12] see no matter how smart the person might
[1:17:15] be how brilliant he might be in his mind
[1:17:17] if God don't back up what he's saying
[1:17:20] there's something wrong
[1:17:24] ain't that right another place he says
[1:17:26] why couldn't this be before because it
[1:17:29] hadn't happened before now you see it
[1:17:32] see the great Holy Spirit sing those
[1:17:35] things coming down Through the Ages and
[1:17:37] times and now it's being revealed and
[1:17:41] then you look there and see that it's
[1:17:43] the truth that's where we're at
[1:17:48] how many seasons that's the truth
[1:17:52] another place he said see we have today
[1:17:55] by God's help the perfect interpretation
[1:17:59] of the word with Divine vindication
[1:18:02] ain't that right
[1:18:04] now so
[1:18:06] by being Believers in in the message
[1:18:10] that God sent by way of a prophet
[1:18:13] we are not a people that prays for and
[1:18:16] believes for things that God never
[1:18:18] promised
[1:18:21] we are not praying in a state of
[1:18:24] confusion
[1:18:26] wandering as to what God in the godhead
[1:18:29] we are praying to
[1:18:31] we we are not a people that prays to a
[1:18:34] god that we do not understand or know
[1:18:39] ain't that right we do not pray to a god
[1:18:42] that is a figment of our imagination
[1:18:45] it's in this day that we have been
[1:18:48] blessed to see God in action and
[1:18:51] demonstration
[1:18:53] you believe it
[1:18:55] we know beyond the shadow of a doubt
[1:18:58] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:19:00] forever not because someone told it
[1:19:03] we've seen it
[1:19:06] we've seen him declare it
[1:19:10] ain't that right amen amen now brother
[1:19:12] Branham says this Divine Healing isn't a
[1:19:16] Hocus Pocus affair
[1:19:19] it isn't saying a few mystery words over
[1:19:22] somebody and hypnotizing
[1:19:25] Divine Healing is the truth revealed
[1:19:30] through Jesus Christ
[1:19:32] do you believe it
[1:19:34] Divine Healing is the truth revealed
[1:19:40] I'll go on to to say that Redemption
[1:19:44] is the truth revealed
[1:19:46] Deliverance is the truth revealed
[1:19:51] adoption is the truth revealed
[1:19:55] amen the Rapture is the truth revealed
[1:19:57] our future home is the truth revealed
[1:20:02] unto us
[1:20:03] didn't you say man our name on the
[1:20:06] Lamb's Book of Life is nothing but the
[1:20:09] truth revealed to us
[1:20:12] being Sons and Daughters of God is
[1:20:15] nothing but the truth revealed to us
[1:20:19] you believe it
[1:20:21] amen that's true
[1:20:24] God's saving our children is nothing but
[1:20:27] the truth amen revealed to us
[1:20:30] it's we we see we've been taken back the
[1:20:34] truth has been given to us
[1:20:38] truth
[1:20:41] that wasn't just a prophet standing
[1:20:43] behind the pulpit
[1:20:46] revealing the truth to a gathering of
[1:20:49] people that day
[1:20:52] and to be honest that isn't really what
[1:20:55] brought the understanding to you yet
[1:20:59] it took a prophet to reveal the truth
[1:21:03] but see the truth has to be personally
[1:21:05] revealed
[1:21:07] amen it has to be personally revealed to
[1:21:09] you in order for you to know
[1:21:11] where you're standing
[1:21:13] amen ain't that right
[1:21:16] and brother Branham said you'll never
[1:21:18] know what is Christ or what is the word
[1:21:21] until first the Holy Spirit has
[1:21:23] personally revealed it to you in your
[1:21:25] heart then you know that Jesus is Lord
[1:21:28] when your heart said so not when your
[1:21:32] knowledge said so but when your heart
[1:21:34] says so that's when you know it
[1:21:39] ain't that right that's when it becomes
[1:21:41] truth to you is when your own heart
[1:21:45] says it
[1:21:47] people hear Brother Brown's all the time
[1:21:49] and they still walk away from it
[1:21:51] but there is a people that their heart
[1:21:55] says it's right
[1:21:57] not intellectually but down in their
[1:22:00] soul they can say Amen to it
[1:22:05] then they come to God in truth
[1:22:09] because their heart is saying itself
[1:22:11] ain't that right
[1:22:14] brother Brown talks about us being an
[1:22:16] outside being by our natural birth
[1:22:19] and the outside is what you taste feel
[1:22:22] smell hear and see
[1:22:24] but when you are born again it has
[1:22:28] nothing to do with the outside
[1:22:30] nothing and this is what makes you sons
[1:22:33] of God it's not your natural birth but
[1:22:34] your spiritual birth
[1:22:36] and when that spiritual birth it happens
[1:22:39] then you become the Son of God and it
[1:22:42] has nothing to do with your natural
[1:22:44] birth it has nothing to do with your
[1:22:46] outside man can you say amen and brother
[1:22:49] Brown said the inside which is the soul
[1:22:51] that's what you really are yeah
[1:22:54] ain't that right that's what you really
[1:22:57] are the outside man he says is what
[1:23:00] Satan temps and knocks around and and
[1:23:04] and uh uh you know he he just uh looking
[1:23:08] for a word here but he just he just
[1:23:10] rattles them
[1:23:13] he just knocks them flat on that outside
[1:23:16] man
[1:23:17] they feel hear smell and see and all
[1:23:20] these things that's where you go through
[1:23:22] the trials and The Temptations and the
[1:23:24] failures and all that but way down
[1:23:27] inside he cannot do it unless you allow
[1:23:30] him to do it
[1:23:33] and you say man that's what program says
[1:23:36] he he can he can tempts you on this
[1:23:38] outside flesh he can he can he can get
[1:23:41] you to where you're not feeling God you
[1:23:43] don't feel like a Christian you don't
[1:23:44] feel great
[1:23:45] he works on you and how many has been
[1:23:48] worked on yeah yeah he works on you
[1:23:51] you'll not be you'll never be healed
[1:23:52] your children will never get saved then
[1:23:56] he of course then he wants to make it
[1:23:57] think that it's you that's one that's
[1:23:58] taking these things that that's coming
[1:24:00] from you and it's not he's the one
[1:24:02] that's making these things and he's
[1:24:04] badgering you in that outside man
[1:24:08] then you say Amen but in that inside man
[1:24:11] he has no control over you
[1:24:15] ain't that right unless you let him and
[1:24:18] brother Brown said now that's where
[1:24:20] Faith resides is in the inside man where
[1:24:24] you live is where Faith resides
[1:24:28] ain't that right now notice faith can
[1:24:30] only be based upon Vindicated truth
[1:24:33] which is being it's been personally
[1:24:37] revealed to you
[1:24:40] it's it's no longer the minister trying
[1:24:44] to encourage you even though we all need
[1:24:46] encouraging
[1:24:48] but there's times when you ain't got the
[1:24:50] encouragement
[1:24:51] and no one seems to understand or you
[1:24:55] don't have the devil fights
[1:24:57] he he he'll make you feel like you're
[1:25:00] alone you're standing alone he'll make
[1:25:02] you feel like you ain't doing no good he
[1:25:03] makes you feel like all kinds of just
[1:25:05] nonsense
[1:25:07] right
[1:25:08] and and it's in them times that's where
[1:25:12] Faith resides is down in that heart and
[1:25:15] it has to be personally revealed to you
[1:25:18] out
[1:25:20] if the whole church walks away it has to
[1:25:22] be personally revealed to you that this
[1:25:25] is nothing but
[1:25:27] ain't that right
[1:25:29] now without faith it is impossible to
[1:25:32] please God ain't that right so brother
[1:25:33] Brown said if you want to please him you
[1:25:35] must come to him with faith believing
[1:25:38] his word is the truth
[1:25:41] come to him come to him
[1:25:44] come to him as a son daughter of God
[1:25:48] in truth it's personally revealed to you
[1:25:51] you're not taking the preacher's word
[1:25:53] you're no longer just taking a prophet's
[1:25:55] word it's now inside of you
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:00] now you're approaching him not brother
[1:26:03] Branham said Lord but father your word
[1:26:06] said
[1:26:07] I'm believing this with all of my heart
[1:26:10] this is what I am heir to
[1:26:13] all right
[1:26:15] ain't that right you're not coming to
[1:26:18] him based on a Creed you're not coming
[1:26:19] based on on your feelings
[1:26:23] you're not making your prayer founding
[1:26:26] your prayer upon how you feel
[1:26:29] you are coming to him in truth yeah
[1:26:33] whether I feel it or not it's still the
[1:26:37] truth
[1:26:39] and you say man whether the doctor
[1:26:41] agrees or not it's still the truth
[1:26:46] so you're not coming to him based upon
[1:26:49] that outside man reasoning intellectual
[1:26:53] all of that is no good don't don't even
[1:26:56] begin to serve God by your reasoning
[1:26:59] don't even try to begin to study
[1:27:01] scriptures by your reasoning don't even
[1:27:03] try to understand the Prophet by your
[1:27:05] reasoning
[1:27:06] it's got to be revealed truth
[1:27:08] it's got to be personally revealed to
[1:27:10] you and then you're calling upon the
[1:27:13] Lord in truth
[1:27:21] Faith doesn't come from the outer
[1:27:23] conscience
[1:27:24] and the prophet said the outer
[1:27:26] conscience reasons but there is no
[1:27:28] reasoning in faith
[1:27:30] and you say Amen
[1:27:33] do you believe that this message is the
[1:27:35] absolute
[1:27:37] now I know there's a big question right
[1:27:39] now
[1:27:40] and for you to say that it's the
[1:27:42] absolute boy they nail you
[1:27:44] all right but it's the absolute
[1:27:46] if the prophet was to bring the truth
[1:27:52] then we must finally stop looking
[1:27:55] and say it's the truth
[1:27:57] can you say man
[1:27:59] then it changes our relationship with
[1:28:02] God it changes how we pray and it
[1:28:05] changes how God looks at us
[1:28:07] and and when I say that
[1:28:10] you know
[1:28:12] it's it's it's kind of it's kind of like
[1:28:15] a little child you know when my children
[1:28:18] were small we had a totally different
[1:28:20] conversation than we do now
[1:28:24] a lot of times it was Google
[1:28:27] that was the conversation I do not tell
[1:28:30] my children I don't walk up to my Daniel
[1:28:31] and faith and Judah and I know you walk
[1:28:34] up to these uh Ruth and Levi Google
[1:28:39] there's maturity coming
[1:28:43] right they're getting to a greater
[1:28:44] understanding
[1:28:46] ain't that right
[1:28:47] I thought of you know
[1:28:49] um
[1:28:52] I've thought of well interview parents
[1:28:54] that have had children
[1:28:56] you know when they're small their arms
[1:28:59] just going all over the place their legs
[1:29:01] are going everywhere they ain't got no
[1:29:02] hardly no control
[1:29:06] but that same child
[1:29:09] to say the boy the same that same child
[1:29:14] he grows up
[1:29:17] as as he's growing up
[1:29:19] like Levi he'll have a football say Dad
[1:29:21] catch you know and I better be ready
[1:29:25] because I might knock me upside the head
[1:29:29] like it did it's more his mom
[1:29:33] but
[1:29:36] he's developed
[1:29:39] not just moving his arms the power was
[1:29:42] there but it was uncontrollable he
[1:29:44] didn't know he didn't have the
[1:29:46] understanding it it wasn't developed
[1:29:49] but then as as the relation or as
[1:29:52] they're growing up and the understanding
[1:29:54] come the relation he's always been a son
[1:29:57] it's just a relationship starts to
[1:29:59] change
[1:30:01] we're no longer Google did
[1:30:06] it's it's now beginning to talk and see
[1:30:10] things eye to eye all right thank you
[1:30:15] amen
[1:30:18] and this is where I believe that we're
[1:30:21] coming to
[1:30:23] Pentecostal teaching will only leave you
[1:30:25] as a baby
[1:30:29] it will only leave you without knowledge
[1:30:33] of who really God is
[1:30:35] not this message
[1:30:38] has come not for us to look and say oh
[1:30:40] wow God is great
[1:30:43] but now we're seeing this understanding
[1:30:45] how great he is and how his works
[1:30:48] because we are developing
[1:30:52] lord it's one thing to read about Jesus
[1:30:55] speaking to the tree
[1:30:57] and that's fine and we can say thank you
[1:30:59] Lord for speaking to the tree but it
[1:31:01] does not bring us into an intimate
[1:31:03] relationship
[1:31:04] as much as when we say it
[1:31:08] when our words are backed up when our
[1:31:12] words have the power
[1:31:14] then we can say oh wow
[1:31:16] that God that was in him is now in me
[1:31:20] and that saying God has used my lips
[1:31:25] can you say man
[1:31:29] so we're coming to an understanding
[1:31:32] and and in our prayer our relationship
[1:31:35] everything about God and us it's we're
[1:31:39] becoming to know him better
[1:31:42] greater
[1:31:45] amen
[1:31:47] so there is no reasoning in faith
[1:31:49] brother Brown said you got it from God
[1:31:51] and you know it's there I don't care how
[1:31:53] much it looks wrong you still know it's
[1:31:55] right it's thus saith the Lord and
[1:31:57] there's nothing going to bother that
[1:31:59] nothing can bother that it's moving
[1:32:01] right straight on difficult means
[1:32:02] nothing to it Wades right on through it
[1:32:04] for it's the word and the words The
[1:32:07] Sword and the word Cuts ain't that right
[1:32:10] see the sword Cuts itself free from
[1:32:13] everything else takes the hand of Faith
[1:32:15] to hold that word so therefore we don't
[1:32:18] pray with our reasoning and I'm not
[1:32:20] going to keep you too much longer
[1:32:22] but we pray by the truth that's been
[1:32:25] revealed to us
[1:32:28] we we're coming up not babes anymore
[1:32:33] but we've been ripening in the presence
[1:32:36] of this message
[1:32:38] the presence of the sun it's ripening us
[1:32:42] our understanding is ripening our
[1:32:45] worship is ripening
[1:32:49] our prayers our words everything is
[1:32:52] ripening our conduct our attitude
[1:32:58] so that's when you pray the prayer of
[1:33:00] faith and God is nine to all that call
[1:33:03] upon his name in truth
[1:33:04] brother Branham said when God revealed
[1:33:06] himself personally to Moses he then knew
[1:33:09] that God was the Healer and he knew that
[1:33:11] God was with him ain't that right what a
[1:33:14] change that was
[1:33:15] when God revealed himself to Moses Moses
[1:33:19] had this understanding that God was the
[1:33:22] Healer and that God was with him
[1:33:25] ain't that right
[1:33:26] notice the very Ministry of Malachi 4 is
[1:33:29] to restore back
[1:33:31] to this Fallen people through these
[1:33:35] denominational twists back to the
[1:33:37] original faith of the fathers to restore
[1:33:40] back the Fallen people
[1:33:45] aren't you glad for that no more is our
[1:33:48] prayer a fallen prayer amen no more is
[1:33:51] our understanding a fallen understanding
[1:33:54] no more is our conduct a fallen conduct
[1:33:57] God by the message of the hour has
[1:34:00] restored us back
[1:34:03] to what we fail from ain't that right
[1:34:06] now I'm I'm going to close but I do want
[1:34:08] to read here a scripture I know that
[1:34:11] there are prophecies that speak of
[1:34:13] Israel and and
[1:34:16] from what I see that a lot of these
[1:34:19] prophecies also are dual that they speak
[1:34:22] about the church as well
[1:34:25] and and spiritual Israel
[1:34:28] is the Church of the Living God
[1:34:31] and so I want to read this whether it
[1:34:34] helps you or not as I read it today
[1:34:39] um
[1:34:40] it meant something to me Isaiah 42 22
[1:34:44] but this is a people robbed and spoiled
[1:34:48] they are all of them snared in holes and
[1:34:52] they are HID in prison houses for they
[1:34:55] are a pray and none delivereth for a
[1:34:58] spoil and none saith restore
[1:35:02] as I read that
[1:35:05] I've been I just got to thinking that we
[1:35:07] were in we've gone through seven Church
[1:35:10] ages
[1:35:12] and and Satan has robbed
[1:35:16] Satan has taken
[1:35:18] Satan has spoiled
[1:35:21] Satan has just had his way with us
[1:35:25] ain't that right and and yet we have
[1:35:28] never been in a complete restoration if
[1:35:32] I can say it that way there's no one
[1:35:33] that could that had the message of of
[1:35:36] complete restoring
[1:35:39] just never did
[1:35:41] so there's not been a through these
[1:35:43] Seven Ages have not been a complete uh
[1:35:46] uh Deliverance
[1:35:48] now notice the 23rd verse who among you
[1:35:50] will give ear to this who will hearken
[1:35:53] and hear for the time to come who gave
[1:35:56] Jacob for a spoil and Israel to the
[1:35:59] robbers did not the Lord he against to
[1:36:01] whom we have sinned for they would not
[1:36:04] walk in his ways neither were they
[1:36:07] obedient unto his law
[1:36:09] this would fit just exactly through the
[1:36:12] church ages God sends a Revival and the
[1:36:15] church goes right back into the muck in
[1:36:18] the mire God sends another move and they
[1:36:21] go right back
[1:36:22] ain't that right is that what Israel
[1:36:24] done he delivers them back bring
[1:36:28] something brought back they go right
[1:36:30] back into the same old the the same old
[1:36:32] muck and mire now Isaiah 43 and 1. but
[1:36:37] now thus saith the Lord that created the
[1:36:39] old Jacob and he that formed the O
[1:36:41] Israel fear not
[1:36:43] have we not heard them words
[1:36:45] we've heard a lot
[1:36:49] fear not taking away the fear from you
[1:36:53] that's what a prophet would say taking
[1:36:55] away the fear from the church
[1:36:58] and he says see fear not for I have
[1:37:01] redeemed thee
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:04] I have called thee by thy name Thou Art
[1:37:07] mine
[1:37:08] when thou passes through the waters I
[1:37:11] will be with you what's he doing making
[1:37:13] his presence known
[1:37:15] and through the waters they shall not
[1:37:18] overflow thee when thy Walkers through
[1:37:20] the fire Thou shalt not be burned
[1:37:22] neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee
[1:37:24] see he's manifesting the truth of his
[1:37:27] power
[1:37:29] but nothing will be able to hurt you
[1:37:33] walk through it won't hurt you it won't
[1:37:34] destroy you
[1:37:38] for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One
[1:37:41] of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for
[1:37:44] thy Ransom Ethiopia and Sabah for thee
[1:37:46] see so he's making known to us the truth
[1:37:49] of what he is I am the Lord thy God
[1:37:52] amen can you say Amen it ain't
[1:37:55] denominations it's me that's your savior
[1:37:59] yeah
[1:38:01] the organizations at your Refuge
[1:38:04] can you say Amen is that not what he's
[1:38:07] done in this age
[1:38:09] made himself known as The Rock of our
[1:38:12] salvation
[1:38:16] notice since thou was precious in my
[1:38:19] sight
[1:38:20] and all of this when when I was reading
[1:38:23] it and what I got out of it it's truth
[1:38:25] truth he's making known to us we we were
[1:38:28] in the prison cells we we were we were
[1:38:31] all in a mess and there was no one
[1:38:33] crying restore there was no one uh uh to
[1:38:37] bring us out we were in a hopeless
[1:38:40] situation
[1:38:41] we were destitute we were nobody
[1:38:45] and yet he come
[1:38:48] making himself known revealing the truth
[1:38:50] to us
[1:38:51] fear not
[1:38:53] I am your Redeemer
[1:38:55] fear not oh my I'm the one
[1:38:59] I'm the one that is your salvation I'm
[1:39:02] the one ain't that right
[1:39:04] since thou was precious in my sight thou
[1:39:07] has been honorable and I have loved that
[1:39:10] you you see what he's doing he's making
[1:39:12] known the truth of what was in his mind
[1:39:15] before the foundation of the world and
[1:39:18] he's telling us I never looked at you in
[1:39:20] a in a uh in my wrath I've always loved
[1:39:24] you
[1:39:25] you've always been with me
[1:39:29] I was always been precious in my sight
[1:39:32] thou has been honorable can you say man
[1:39:34] therefore will I give men for thee and
[1:39:37] people for thy life again fear not for I
[1:39:40] am with thee
[1:39:42] I will bring thy seed from the East and
[1:39:44] gather thee from the West what's he
[1:39:46] doing he has done the work of a redeemer
[1:39:50] kinsman redeemer and now he comes to
[1:39:54] claim what he has redeemed
[1:39:56] fear not I am with you
[1:39:59] hello
[1:40:01] you ain't come to tickle our fancy you
[1:40:03] ain't come just to make us feel good
[1:40:05] he come with the sole purpose to redeem
[1:40:08] what he has claimed
[1:40:10] ain't that right so now notice I'll
[1:40:13] bring thy seed from the East and gather
[1:40:14] thee from the West I will say to the
[1:40:17] north give up and to the South keep not
[1:40:19] back bring my sons from far and my
[1:40:22] daughters from the ends of the Earth
[1:40:23] have we not heard his voice crying in
[1:40:26] this day House of Hell give way in the
[1:40:29] name of Jesus give way
[1:40:33] even everyone that is called by my name
[1:40:36] for I have created him for my glory I
[1:40:39] have formed him yea I have made him see
[1:40:42] so now he reveals he reveals the truth
[1:40:46] of his purpose for creating us
[1:40:48] bring forth the blind people that have
[1:40:51] eyes and the death that have ears what's
[1:40:54] it all about he's restoring a fallen
[1:40:57] people
[1:40:59] he's restoring then you say Amen a
[1:41:03] people that couldn't see and understand
[1:41:05] the truth but it restores unto them
[1:41:07] their sight and their hearing so that
[1:41:09] they can know and understand the truth
[1:41:13] if you go on here in the ninth verse he
[1:41:16] says let all the nations be gathered
[1:41:18] together and let the people be assembled
[1:41:20] who who among them can declare this and
[1:41:23] show us former things let them bring
[1:41:26] forth their witnesses that they may be
[1:41:27] justified or let them hear and say it is
[1:41:30] truth you are my witness saith the Lord
[1:41:32] and my servant whom I have chosen that
[1:41:34] you may know and believe me and
[1:41:36] understand
[1:41:38] that I am he before me there was no God
[1:41:41] formed neither shall there be after me I
[1:41:45] even I am the Lord and beside me there
[1:41:48] is no savior can you say Amen so the
[1:41:51] truth has been made known to us that he
[1:41:54] alone is God
[1:41:57] that he alone is our savior he alone is
[1:41:59] our creator he alone is our existence
[1:42:02] ain't that right
[1:42:04] amen see and so he says I have declared
[1:42:08] and have saved and I have showed when
[1:42:11] there was no strange God among you
[1:42:14] see therefore you are my Witnesses saith
[1:42:16] the Lord that I am God yea before the
[1:42:19] day was I am he and there is none that
[1:42:22] can deliver out of my hand I will work
[1:42:25] and who shall let it
[1:42:27] thus saith the Lord your Redeemer the
[1:42:29] Holy One of Israel for your sake I have
[1:42:31] sent to Babylon and brought down all
[1:42:34] their nobles and the Chaldeans whose cry
[1:42:36] is in the ships I am the Lord your God
[1:42:39] the your the I am the Lord your Holy One
[1:42:43] the creator of Israel your king thus
[1:42:45] saith the Lord which maketh the way in
[1:42:47] the sea and the path in the mighty
[1:42:49] Waters which bringeth forth The Chariot
[1:42:51] and horse the Army and the power they
[1:42:54] shall lie down together they shall not
[1:42:56] rise they are extinct and are quenched
[1:42:59] As Told can you say man see so it's the
[1:43:02] truth of this power manifested remember
[1:43:05] he says ye not the former things neither
[1:43:08] consider the things of old behold I will
[1:43:11] do a new thing and now it shall spring
[1:43:13] forth shall ye not know it I will even
[1:43:17] make a way in the wilderness and rivers
[1:43:19] in the desert and the Beast of the field
[1:43:21] shall honor me and the dragons and the
[1:43:23] aisle owls because I give water in the
[1:43:26] wilderness and the river rivers in the
[1:43:28] desert to drink to my people My Chosen
[1:43:30] these people have I formed for myself
[1:43:35] they shall show forth my praise can you
[1:43:39] say Amen do you love him well then you
[1:43:42] look at First Peter 2 and 9. he says but
[1:43:46] you are a chosen generation a royal
[1:43:49] priesthood and a holy nation A peculiar
[1:43:52] people that you should show forth the
[1:43:53] Praises of him who hath called you out
[1:43:56] of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[1:43:59] which in time past were not a people but
[1:44:02] now are the people of God which had not
[1:44:04] obtained Mercy but now have obtained
[1:44:07] Mercy oh do you love him
[1:44:12] calling up on him in truth
[1:44:15] he is not him that call upon them
[1:44:19] prayer from a Believer prayer of a
[1:44:22] righteous man availeth much amen
[1:44:26] first John 5 20 it says and we know that
[1:44:28] the Son of God is come and hath given us
[1:44:32] an understanding that we may know him
[1:44:35] that is true and we are in him that is
[1:44:38] true even in his son Jesus Christ this
[1:44:42] is the true God and eternal life
[1:44:45] so now our prayer isn't the prayer of a
[1:44:48] beggar
[1:44:50] but rather it's the prayer of a son or
[1:44:52] daughter of God
[1:44:54] we have the truth as to who he is
[1:44:57] we have the truth as to why he saved us
[1:45:00] we have the truth as to who we are we
[1:45:03] have the truth that we were in his
[1:45:05] thinking before the foundation of the
[1:45:07] world
[1:45:08] we have the truth that his thoughts are
[1:45:11] perfect and that we were in his thoughts
[1:45:13] and they are Eternal and they are real
[1:45:16] we have the truth that we are Justified
[1:45:20] as though we've never done it we have
[1:45:23] the truth
[1:45:25] can you say Amen
[1:45:27] oh my we have the truth and we know his
[1:45:32] will
[1:45:33] we come to him knowing it is his will to
[1:45:36] heal us we make our petition knowing
[1:45:39] that it is his will to save our children
[1:45:41] we pray knowing it is his will to
[1:45:44] Deliver Us from all evil we bring our
[1:45:48] petition to him knowing it is he who
[1:45:51] hath made us his children and not we
[1:45:54] ourselves
[1:45:55] can you say man
[1:45:57] truth revealed
[1:46:00] if the musicians will come
[1:46:02] truth revealed is actually God's
[1:46:06] understanding revealed
[1:46:08] hey
[1:46:10] because truth revealed does not come
[1:46:13] from man's intellect that's why it had
[1:46:15] to come through a prophet because the
[1:46:18] word of God comes through a by-profit to
[1:46:20] a prophet
[1:46:21] so it's God's understanding that we pray
[1:46:24] with
[1:46:25] which gives us his faith
[1:46:27] can you say man
[1:46:29] brother Branham said this I found two
[1:46:31] wires that'll bring uh
[1:46:36] that'll bring the the visible power of
[1:46:39] God
[1:46:40] for Divine Healing into the individual
[1:46:43] he said that that's two things I find
[1:46:46] one of them is love the other is faith
[1:46:49] and they're sweethearts and when love
[1:46:51] gets married to Faith love always
[1:46:53] accompanies faith
[1:46:55] when you love God enough to know that he
[1:46:58] can't lie to you it'll create a faith in
[1:47:00] there that'll make you believe his word
[1:47:02] and every word he said is positive truth
[1:47:05] and you accept it with an unadulterated
[1:47:08] faith that won't say no it'll produce
[1:47:12] just exactly what he said it would do do
[1:47:16] you get it so that's where we pray with
[1:47:18] understanding it's not our understanding
[1:47:20] it's his understanding we have taken on
[1:47:23] his mind
[1:47:24] and now we know his truths we know the
[1:47:27] mystery of his will
[1:47:28] he ain't out to kill you he now here to
[1:47:32] acknowledge you you're his son you're
[1:47:34] his daughter he ain't here shunning you
[1:47:37] from your prayers you know the only
[1:47:38] thing that will hinder your prayer is
[1:47:40] sin
[1:47:42] that's why we have a covering
[1:47:46] we have an atonement
[1:47:49] are you with me
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:55] Psalms 103 2 says bless the Lord O my
[1:47:59] soul and forget not all his benefits
[1:48:03] when you're going through your trial
[1:48:05] forget not all of his benefits when
[1:48:08] you're going to prayer forget not all of
[1:48:10] his benefits don't let doubt don't let
[1:48:12] reasoning stop you from asking for big
[1:48:15] things
[1:48:16] can you say man who forgive us all thine
[1:48:19] iniquities who heal us all by diseases
[1:48:22] redeem is our lives from termination who
[1:48:24] Chronicles thee with loving kindness and
[1:48:26] Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth
[1:48:31] with good things now would he do that by
[1:48:34] giving you understanding of Truth
[1:48:37] that way when you pray your prayer is
[1:48:40] not weak
[1:48:42] prayers with words of truth
[1:48:45] and you're coming now based upon his
[1:48:47] word
[1:48:49] father
[1:48:51] I know I feel like I feel like a
[1:48:53] complete idiot
[1:48:55] father I know I've I I feel I feel like
[1:48:59] you don't love me but I'm going to push
[1:49:01] that aside
[1:49:03] the truth says you'll never leave me nor
[1:49:06] forsake me
[1:49:08] the truth says that if I'd call upon you
[1:49:10] in truth that you're nigh unto me
[1:49:13] can you say Amen
[1:49:15] and then you bring him the word of God
[1:49:17] you bring the promises before him and
[1:49:20] say God this is your word
[1:49:21] can you say man I'm not doubting it I'm
[1:49:24] not here going to argue with it God I
[1:49:26] know it looks impossible and Satan is
[1:49:28] telling me it's impossible he's telling
[1:49:30] me there's no reason to pray but God
