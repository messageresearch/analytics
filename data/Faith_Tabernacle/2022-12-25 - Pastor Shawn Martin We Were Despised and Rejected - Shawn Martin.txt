well is that your desire I believe he is born in a lot of folks heart this morning here and um you know that's that's just our whole desire amen's God just to Christ to be born in us and to flourish amen and uh well good to be here this morning Merry Christmas to you all and um the musicians can be dismissed and certainly appreciate everyone coming and having our visitors good to see or have our visitors this morning a man in the house of the Lord and do you love him in the wonderful amen and I guess everybody survived the cold and uh it's been mighty mighty cold these days but I don't know hopefully y'all had power some haven't you know have power and so we certainly pray for them and that you know that they're able to stay warm and because I tell you what it's just flat code and we on our upstairs you know we've got as many split uh is it many splits I guess heaters and they they are working overtime and so our pipes are froze as far as upstairs and but uh We've uh We've endured and I just thank god for heat I'll tell you why you know you just don't think you just you just don't think about it you know but especially in the summertime but uh I thank the Lord for heat and does I thank the Lord most of all that we're able to just gather and to worship Him amen and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the the book of Isaiah the 53rd chapter and Isaiah 53 and we will read the start at the first verse but it says who hath believed our report into whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as they root out of a dry ground ye hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne or Grieves and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted amen let's just bow our heads to our father as we come here this morning Lord to worship you to glorify you Lord we've come because it's in our heart to do so father for we're so thankful for a day Lord such as this a time to remember a time to think of what you've done for us Lord no father we're just asking that you would take what simple words that I would have today or that you would just anoint them but not me Lord I pray anointed people father and may we just be drawn Closer to You Lord may we realize more and more father the blessings that we have Lord by you sending your son Lord and you dwelling in that Tabernacle for us Lord we thank you we praise you glorify you in Jesus name we pray amen you can have your seats this morning and this may seem to be an odd text that we would read for Christmas Day but first of all we we do have a lot to be thankful for today as we Ponder what Christmas is all about and um I I know there's various thoughts and ideas about Christmas and some are just totally absolutely against it and don't want to have nothing to do with with the day but yet a prophet would keep a balance to it and we've we've talked on them before on things but he told us it was a pagan day he told us it was a um you know all everything about it pretty much is is paganism but yet then the prophet would bring out and he would say but if there had not been no Christmas there would be no Resurrection if there'd been no Christmas there had been no love there had been no peace there had been no Hereafter for the believer if there had been no Christmas so I think that even though Christ was not born on December in the month of December we still should we we should still hold this day as a day of worship and to honor what God has done and for sending his son and of course we know that brother Branham did um he took time for Christmas um there and and I know even there was kind of maybe different ones uh not not here in the assembly but uh different ones were being questioned about uh why we would you know sing Christmas songs and how wrong it was and all and so I uh I I I know some folks uh that that went to the Branham Tabernacle and growing up and you know they they one brother told me said we you know I uh um I went there and brother Collins done everything the way brother Brown did it to a t the best he could and he said we always sung Christmas songs and um and another brother said well I've talked to a family member uh that grew up in the Tabernacle with brother Branham and and said he always always took time for Christmas always took time to sing songs always you know and so uh I thank God that we we had a prophet that would that kept balance and that would um let us know that there's something about Christmas that we ought to think about we ought to ponder we ought to look into and and um you know when we were growing up we'd never done anything like that and that was apostolics you know we we just were taught not to and and all that and and so when we come into the message we find that there is a balance and there is something that as a as a believer that we can we can look to and be thankful for even though this day is is not the a real day that Christ was born and the world has set this for this side of this day yet we will we will take this day as an honor to God and so um again the opening scripture uh uh may be a little odd uh for this day but the person that Isaiah is speaking of is the same person that was born uh on the first Christmas ain't that right and and so we we find that this person is the reason why Christmas exists amen and so uh there wouldn't be a Christmas if Jesus wasn't born I appreciate your life I appreciate your birth but it didn't make it Christmas and my birth did not make a Christmas but Jesus birth did and uh so we we find that there had been millions of babies born before before Jesus was ever born and yet there was no Christmas but there's something special about this person Jesus ain't that right and so uh his birth is the only reason why we have Christmas or why we should have Christmas and why it means so much to the believer we know he was the beginning of the creation of God no other child no other baby no no other other one was the beginning but he was and we know that Mary was overshadowed by by God and God created a blood cell uh in her womb and then the prophet said God himself come into the womb a Virgin Mary and wrapped himself in a created blood cell so this was God making the first Christmas God and and um it it it was a blessed time Mary had nothing to do with it no man had anything to do with it it was the blood cell that developed that created blood cell that God created in the womb of Mary that developed into the son of God amen and so it happened without Mary knowing any man in the way of relationship brother Branham said it was God's creative blood that he created in order to redeem us so this birth we we ought to be excited about the birth of Jesus Christ amen and um it's so sad that people want to do away with the quotes and all that about what brother Brown said about Christmas because they get so staunch in their in their legalistic ways or we could even say at Pentecostal Apostolic uh whatever ways they were before they come and do the message but we we find that if it had not been for the birth of Jesus Christ you wouldn't be redeemed and so uh I don't care what the pagans do with it I don't care what they what the world does with the day of Christmas we understand that uh why there there was a Christmas and that was if God didn't take the initiative to redeem you amen then where would we be so God's the one that took the initiative I don't care what day they call it Christmas uh day Bozo day whatever day they want to call it I don't care but this is the day that we set aside to say we thank God Amen for his son ain't that right and so we we find that that it was God that he created blood cell that he created in order to redeem us and came and lived in the same body that he created therefore seek God had to suffer Temptation he couldn't suffer Temptation he had to suffer sexual Temptation he had to suffer all kinds of Temptation to be tempted by the devil in riches and powers and dominions and so forth he had to suffer all of that in order to do it he couldn't be as God in spirit he had to be God in flesh ain't that right amen so in in another place he says I think that God had it in his mind that it would be appealing to the human being and then he says it is to the believer it is to the believer it is appealing when our God becomes one of us but to the starchy ungodly it's a stumbling block so he says I'll give you the sign a virgin shall conceive Emmanuel will be with you seek God thought it would be appealing to the human race that our God would become one of us that he would cross himself and become our dust that he would become our stock a human stock the Creator who made all things now I I have to tell you that's appealing to me that's appealing that God would become man it's it's more appealing than the Christmas trees it's more appealing than the gifts it's more appealing than the Santa Clauses it's more appealing than the lights it's I I there's something appealing to the believer about Christmas and that is God becoming us God becoming one crossing a man to where he could become us and so what what we see about Christmas is that it was it the real heart of God for the prophet said that Jesus was God's love gift to us what a gift he could not give any greater gift if you would have thought of that you know because sometimes we Ponder now what gift can I give you know my wife or a family member or or whatever what what could I give and you want to give something special amen so God wanting to give the gift and he wants of course God being the best and the perfect he wants to give the perfect gift amen and he realizes there ain't no other gift that is so perfect as he coming himself and offering his life for you and I can you say amen and you realize that gift still goes on today he's still given himself in this age what a gift ain't that right but you would think that the world would have been awestruck at the reality of God becoming a baby and growing up as a child and and as a teenager into adulthood and you would Assad that would have been awesome to the people and the people would have just stood in all to see that God becoming one of them eating with them talking with them hearing them and and uh just just being one of them and especially the Jews which were God's people that had the promises of of the Messiah you know they they had the promise and letter formed by the prophets and by the songs and and the the the the the the the scribes and and all of these things and uh and and the Jews sang songs about him they they heard sermons about him they they read about him coming they they they even said that they were expecting the Messiah to come so you would think these people would have been ready to receive such a one as when he came and then we find out they missed him when he came what what would cause the people that sung about him that claimed to know him that saw the supernatural Works what what would cause them that that would say we're expecting we're looking for messiah to come and yet they missed him they they missed him all together and so I I thought been thinking about our scripture reading and uh because our our scripture reading does not just pertain to him at Calvary even though we we look at it in that way for he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity and by his stripes we are healed and yes he he didn't receive that until the end of his his life and and and at the crucifixion but but I I think what we've read today uh uh is applicable Amen to such a time as as as the birth and and all all of his life because it was all of his life that he was despised and and rejected all of his life there was no Beauty in him that we we would desire him you know there there was no Beauty in Messiah laying in the manger that there there was no desire both thing about him laying in a place that was smelly and uh stunk and and animal hair no doubt may be flying around and uh in the air in that in that barn or that manger or whatever and uh you know but but but it it yet it was Messiah that was born ain't that rhyme and so uh you know someone had made the comment the other day uh to another and and and said you know they were talking about what is their favorite thing about Jesus that they loved and and one on you know uh in in innocence but but made the the statement my favorite thing is that he was so uh uh carefree and and no problems no worries and oh if I could you know just I I I'd like to live that life uh they say and and uh and that was their their their favorite thing about Jesus and but on the contrary his life wasn't a Carefree life he has his life wasn't a life of just happy-go-lucky and and and these things uh uh we find that he was the most despised man I I think you know you know I I think you know that that uh Trump Donald Trump is is you know probably as a politician the most hated man on the earth and but yet it it it it of all the hate that is toward that man yet there there can't be another man most hated as Jesus was he was despised you understand not only the people were hated him but demons hated him uh the the spiritual Darkness hell hated him death hated him everything uh visible and invisible uh he was despised and he was the most hated man the most misunderstood man and and the Bible even tells us that at the time of the birth there was no room for him in the end ain't that right and and and and what a a setting for a life amen at the very beginning no room no room in the end and how we have have seen it that it just didn't just go in the in in the end no room but there was no room in the churches for him that there was no in the world for him that there was no room in society for him there there was no room in in religion for him you understand what I'm saying and and so even when he became a man did he not tell his disciples that foxes have holes the birds have nests and and and yet the son of man has no place to lay his head and I understand that that that could have been or we use that in this spiritual application but but let's look at as as in the in the natural he had no home to go to he of his own he he had to borrow a boat he had to you know to get across the sea he had to borrow a grave a man even to be buried in he everything uh that that that uh uh he done he had to borrow these things uh hear the king of Heaven that that could have spoke about that could have you know that could have provided his own grave that could have provided everything that he wanted he could have had a home he could have had a wife he could have had children he could have he could have had all these things but and and and yet uh and and I'm sure he was tempted for the Bible says he was tempted in all points such as we were so he did have them sexual Temptations he did have them them uh uh times of Temptations just to walk away from the ministry and and and live a normal life and and and uh uh uh and and all these things so so uh this wasn't a man that that was popular a man we even read about uh uh Simeon or Simon I believe it was that it invited him to the banquet that he was going to put on and Jesus came at that invitation and and and when he got there he was overlooked and and he was not welcome they didn't wash his feet and like like it was custom they didn't uh anoint him like it was custom he stunk and and he was uh uh uh uh you know dirty feet and sitting in the corner and and it wasn't that he was overlooked it was dead he was not welcome there was no room for that banquet for him they just wanted him for sport they just wanted him whatever but it wasn't a true genuine desire a man to have him there amen and so we we find that brother Brown said they'd have nothing to do with such a fellow as that but way down deep in their heart they knew who he was for Nicodemus plainly stated that Rabbi see we the Pharisees we know that you're a teacher come from God for no man can do the things that you do except God be with him why didn't he confess him then is because their Camp had set its boundary and wouldn't let him in the camp it wouldn't let anybody go out to him see they they had their own Camp he'd come by night when the gate was really closed but he found that he could met uh he couldn't met him anyhow he said yes and the same now he's become a stranger a foreigner they don't understand it why would this be and why would that be when the word itself testifies that this is exactly what is supposed to be done in this day and how he goes we went through it over and over but it's the truth but he was to them in their Camp a fanatic a a breaker of their Traditions now they're worshiping God they're they're calling on God Amen they're singing about him they're saying we're expecting Messiah to come and there he was a fanatic to them he was a breaker of their traditions an upsetter of their churches really just a fortune teller a spiritualist called beelzeba that's what he was and he says I believe that if you come among us today he would be the same thing to us for we have tradition we have denomination we can't get along with one another why there's only one place that man can get along and that's under the shed blood and the blood was shed as a germ of life to germatize this seed the word and outside of that our denominational barriers will always keep people away but he would be a stranger today he would be called the same thing he would be acted he would be put out of the camp and did you know the same Bible that said he would be rejected of men a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and they rejected and we did did esteem him smitten and Afflicted of God the very scripture that told that the very Prophet that sang my God my God why is Thou forsaken me my bones they all stare at me they pierced my hands and my feet when they were singing that in the church their sacrifice the god that they thought they were serving they were crucifying and so is it today the very God so we find that no matter what age you're in uh you have to make room for him you have to make room I understand you know people singing their songs and talking about Messiah today and and and these things and you know as if we're making room for him uh uh that some we're doing something different than they uh did back in that day but but you you have to make room for him no matter what age you're in it's easy to make room for him as a baby in a Manger amen because that's all history you don't really have to deal with the stink and the and the nonsense of of of the the animals all around and and and the mule the donkeys and the cows making all their noise and and and the and the poop and and all these things that are all in there in the and the smell we don't have to deal with that so we can celebrate something a man of the history amen but you have to make room for him today can you say man you have to make room for him and I really think if the Innkeeper really knew that this was Messiah that was about to be born he would have made room trust me he would have made room you understand what I'm saying amen uh uh if we can make if people can make room for Hollywood actors and they can make room for president politicians Governors and kings and all of that and roll out the red carpet trust me I believe if he really knew a man who was about to be born amen he would have rolled out some red carpet he would have asked somebody he would I would say he would have given up his own room and said hey you can have my room you understand what I'm saying I think if the world would do it today they would recognize if they recognized him they'd make room I believe if Simon amen really knew who the who he was he would have made sure that he was welcome I think he would have honestly told that foot wash flunky amen and you go get lunch I'll stand there I'll wash his feet if he really knew that this was the Messiah that he had invited but he didn't know can you say Amen so he made excuses why he couldn't do it and the foot was flunk he's somewhere he made sure that the foot was flunk he wasn't there either so he could walk past I don't know how it would happen but all I know is Jesus came in in there unrecognized with dirty feet can you say man they thought he was a devil they thought he was a liar they thought he was just some impersonator they thought he was messing everything up and they didn't realize this was the Messiah that they've been longing for ain't that right the Bible even says if the people would have known who he was they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory if they had known they would have crucified Barabbas give us Barabbas we want Barabbas not him let him go but they didn't know so they chose to set Barabbas free right so he was despised he was rejected a man of sorrow the Christian world today wants us to believe that the birth of Christ was a splendid thing do the believer that understands the birth and what it represents and what it was it is a splendid thing but to our understanding of the birth it's not a splendid thing to them their idea of Splendor is totally different they want us to believe that it was glamorous but yet there was nothing glamorous about the birth of Christ ain't that right if if they just took the birth of Christ just the way it was they wouldn't want it but they have to dress it up to make it appealing through the world ain't that right they have to dress it up so now because they've made it such an appeal to the world that now we see sinners atheists people that are ungodly celebrating Christmas people that would not want to have anything to do with him celebrating Christmas ain't that right and and what's sad is they celebrate it any way they want to brother brem talks about it how they give whiskey for presence something that is so degrading to God they give you know uh uh all kinds of evil uh ungodly things as presence and they they toast you know give a toast with wine and and and these things and so their actions and the gifts that they give justify that they really don't know what Christmas is about they really wouldn't want Christmas see he is despised and rejected of men it's it's it's it's it's not just that generation it's every generation that's the traits that follow him that's the things that go with him is despised rejected a man of sorrow acquainted with grief we try to beautify Christianity as though it's some great glorious thing that everybody should want but it's not it's not glamorous it's not glorious it's not something that the world wants we're trying to make it for the homosexuals we're trying to make it for the transgenders we're trying to make it for the drunks we're trying to make it for everybody we're trying to make church for everybody so everybody feels comfortable right preachers want to be popular people want to be popular we don't want to make people mad but just the fact he was born there was nothing appealing to it he could have been born in a palace if he wanted to but it was God's way it was God's choosing ain't that right yes sir brother Branham I've read this before but brother Brown and speaking of Jesus said of all the human emotions he manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one he wept often a man God think of that now God that wanted to become one of us one of the greatest emotions that he had is he wept often wept because he was rejected wept because of the people's unbelief wept it was it was a weeping from the people's actions can you say Amen he was acquainted with grief John 1 11 says he came unto his own and his own received him not and and we know and and you know these things and so I've just just shared my heart I trust that's all right but the way he came to Earth was too unusual for the people they they they should have being a people of God being a people acquainted with with the supernatural but they hadn't seen the supernatural in so long they hadn't had a prophet in 400 years and and the churches had done away with the supernatural the priest had come to the place that they were taking the Bible and it was all a history book history lesson we know what the prophet said about it oh they talked about God doing the Red Sea but now chill he doesn't do that today you understand what I'm saying so how how can you do away with the how could they do away with the Supernatural and make Isaiah's prophecy the whole diverge and shall conceive make that come alive to the people you you can't do it it's a supernatural thing ain't that right so the the supernatural had become too unusual to the people to where they could not receive it and all through life his ministry was too unusual his very life was too unusual his Doctrine was too unusual and the prophet said God always does the unusual for he is unusual ain't that right if you're going to see God you've got to see him in the unusual that's exactly right and that's the same way with Christmas today amen it's the unusual that you'll see that's That's What Christmas Means to us is God working in an unusual manner can you say amen that's exactly right God laying in the manger that day was unusual God being a baby the king of Heaven creator of Heaven and Earth amen being a baby amen needing the diaper changed and goo goo gaga and learning how to walk and learning how to talk and that was too unusual for the people to receive God living in a human body was unusual to the people even the Believers had a hard time accepting it even the Believers remember Joseph when Mary told him Mary told him you know and and to think of it now if you go with what brother Brown told us of the account they'd just come from church and the priest talking about all this talking about these things of of what God used to do and says but God doesn't do these things anymore I hate to tell you but something wasn't right as Mary and Joseph begin to walk the path home it just wasn't right something wrong and they just begin to talk about what God's still does and what God still there's some to thank God there was a heart of faith and and and Mary they they they maybe she asked him I I if I can get it right of one of the accounts that brother Brown said that she asked him what does Isaiah mean Behold a virgin shall conceive what what does that does that saying I think God led her to scripture because it applied to her and I still believe that God is able to lead us to the scriptures for today can you say amen and he began as she began to meditate see he would work he would come to her through his word not through not through not through video games not through uh whatever you know uh uh uh novel books and love stories and all that he had focused her mind hurt upon the word of God ain't that right and as she was meditating the next day I think it was that morning the angel of God appeared to her ain't that right so then she goes and tells Joseph now remember the priest is telling them it ain't for today it's not for today you can't do it and then he goes she goes and tells them what happened here they are to be married ain't that right amen and and Joseph has a hard time believing what Mary has just told him I'm expecting a child and you can just imagine the the the reaction to Joseph what I trusted you we we've made a vow together you you said you love me I love you we wanted to live together and you're going to do this but but Joseph it's not the way you think it's it's not and maybe she began to tell him the story but he still couldn't believe it ain't that right the Bible says him being a just man not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately now the prophet says he wanted a Believer but it was too unusual to believe he wanted a Believer a just man an honest man wanting to believe everything she's saying that it was too unusual can you say Amen but see the the Bible had already promised God promised that Messiah would come and he even told how it would come they were discussing the very scripture the older virgins shall conceive it's amazing how the prophet says we always want to thank God for what he done yesterday and what he's going to do but when he does it right before us we can't get it and that's the world but God made sure that the believer got it can you say Amen but I'm going to be honest with you as as the prophet says and we all know that's lived long enough truth is Stranger Than Fiction ain't that right truth is Stranger Than Fiction so in order to make it glamorously today they have to take Christ out of the picture and put Santa Claus in and it's easier for people to believe the story myth of Santa Claus than it is to accept the truth about Christ it's true it's easier for people to to grasp hold of the Easter Bunny at time of Easter than it is for them to believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ can you say Amen but Easter Bunny doesn't make Christ reality Santa Claus doesn't make Christ a reality but Christ himself becomes a reality yes sir so it's easier for people to believe a fictional story it's easier for them you realize it's easier for people to believe a politician a lying politician than it is to believe the truth about Christ and you know it's true people flock to the voting machines even people in the message they'll flock to them voting machines as if some miracle is going to happen but when the prophet has even said there's no more hope for America there there's no more you can put Abraham Lincoln in every office every George Washington in every office or whatever it still ain't gonna help America that's the truth but we'll take a lying politician that is lying through his teeth just to get an office and we will believe everything he says though he hasn't proved it nothing but yet a bunch of Lies is believed more than the truth is can you say Amen but if you'll notice every part every stage of Jesus's life match scripture it fulfilled the scripture can you say Amen so so what I'm saying is there was nothing fictitious fictitious about him nothing ain't that right everything fictitious about Santa Claus everything fictitious about these politicians trying to fix our economy it ain't gonna work it's all fictitious lies and and all these things but when it comes to Christ there was nothing fictitious about him you can look at it whether it was his birth his life his ministry his death his resurrection his Ascension his return there's nothing fictitious about it it's all reality it's all real it's all true and yet it's only appealing to those who believe can you say Amen but it's the religious world that wants to make everything about him fictitious you realize they've made worship fictitious they've made the new birth fictitious they've made the supernatural fictitious they've made the death fictitious they made the resurrection fictitious they made the Rapture fictitious they've made baptism fictitious everything's got lies in it through traditions and Creeds and dogmas of man everything is is got lies they've got their own idea of how the Rapture is going to be and it's totally a lie compared to what a prophet said it is can you say man they've got their own ideas of what a baptism really is but it's a lie compared to what God's word says about it yeah you understand what I'm saying they've wanted a medal even in in in in in the resurrection of Jesus Christ and and what do they do they the world Embraces the Easter bunny as though it's some special thing but when it comes to Christ they'll Embrace new clothes a new hat they'll Embrace everything but the real thing and that's Christ rose from the dead because truth is Stranger Than Fiction but if you're going to see Christ in all of it you're going to see Christ in a Rapture you're going to see Christ in baptism if you're going to see Christ in the resurrection the new birth worship if you're going to see Christ in the death then you have to see what is truth about it can you say man I'm so glad the prophet gave us the truth about it he gave us the truth not standing behind the pulpit giving something fictitious to gain popularity but he gave us the truth and it's despised it's rejected can you say Amen and those that Embrace that truth is despise they're rejected that they become people of Sorrow and you say Amen because you're not embracing the lies you're embracing the truth and Jesus said that he was the truth so there is a truth to worship there is a truth to the New Birth there is the truth Amen to the supernatural there is a truth to all of these things and there is a truth to Christmas can you say amen and when a man sees the truth about it he will see Christ for what he is you don't have to shun from it you don't have to you don't have to treat it as some evil day there is a truth to it and Christ is the truth can you say Amen do you love him now the rest of the world see there was few that recognized who Christ really was whether it be at the manger or whether it be on the cross or whether it be in in the synagogues Healing The Sick very very few people recognized who he was and and the rest of the world just went on their own merry way and most of them most of the juicing were still looking for messiah and you know they're still looking for a messiah today they're still claiming it they're still they're still saying it we want messiah messiah we're looking for messiah can you say amen and not knowing that Messiah had come but now we will say give them the benefit of the doubt they were blinded for your sake can you say Amen they they were blinded for your sake now the world wants to do make make Christmas and all fictitious all fictitious do away with the birth do away with Christ do away with that which is is despised and rejected and unusual and let's do something that is fictitious so the world will embrace it can you say Amen that day of Grace look at that that day of Grace amen that's what the church world has done with it and the Jews were blinded the Bible says and it's it's coming a time that their eyes are going to be open and they'll realize they rejected him they rejected him right that's exactly right and that's why they're in their Homeland right now the the you know it's starting to happen it's it's start there's an Awakening going I you know I I just believe they're ready for it now there there was that Hue and so those even those who recognized him had to have God to show them right that's right Joseph was minded to put her away privately and yet the Bible says that as you slept an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream ain't that right and told him what was really going on Matthew 1 20. while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost can you say man now we know he appeared in a dream because there was no prophet in the land ain't that right and it did not need interpretation the dream did not need an interpretation it was spelled out plainly that when Joseph woke up he knew what had happened he wasn't seeking uh uh some uh uh uh whatever to to interpret the dream he he knew exactly what it was that's exactly right see and so uh uh we find even the Shepherds we read about the Shepherds being at the birth of Christ but how would they have known that the Messiah was born amen there was no band Amen to welcome him there was no choir to welcome him there was no preacher to welcome him there was nothing how did them Shepherds that was out there they stunk like their sheep and and and they were considered maybe out I don't know but but they had been just out in the Sheep away from the city for so long and the angels of God appeared to them to tell them about the birth of Christ can you say amen and not every not every Shepherd understood the birth not everyone because they there was many Shepherds still out in the field but the angel appeared to that elected Shepherds amen and told them about the birth and they dropped everything and ran to to see him ain't that right ran to see him see so we we find amen Luke uh 2 13 says suddenly just break it in suddenly there was the angel a multitude of the Heavenly holes praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherds said to one another let us now go unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord everybody say the Lord hath made known unto us and the Bible says they glorified and praised God for all the things they had seen and heard as it was told them so there had to be something to tell them about the birth of Christ look at the wise men Amelia or I don't know how many me or wise men but there was a lot of wise men out there studying the Stars church amen but these men were looking for the Messiah they were true in their heart amen looking and God showed them amen there was a supernatural sign a supernatural star that showed up can you say amen and and for some reason no one else could see him none of the other astrologers and wise men could look at the star as they were studying the Stars they couldn't see it but God was telling these wise men the Messiah is on Earth can you say amen and they were Guided by that star and they said we've seen a star and we've come to worship Him but it had it took the supernatural it took the supernatural to lead them to Christ ain't that right is this okay amen see it it took it it it it because it would have been considered a strange birth an unusual birth and they couldn't put it together in the scriptures but when the supernatural amen came to them they were able to have put it to the scripture can you say amen and realize this is not just another baby amen this isn't just another poor woman amen that was put out in the cold and and no room maybe there was other babies that were being born at the same time I don't know amen but the supernatural would tell them that the Messiah is on the earth it took them two years to follow the star but the supernatural never left them the supernatural never left them it made sure they come to the Christ I know these people around religious folks claiming to have the supernatural with them and ain't sure leading them to Christ you look at Simeon and the prophet is Hannah Simeon was given a promise that he would see the child that he wouldn't die until he saw him but you know what when the little baby was there with all the other babies Simeon wouldn't have known it but the prophet said he was led by the spirit of God and he had taken all these other babies and blessed them but when he come to that baby something just told him this is Messiah this is what you belong for this is the promise that I gave you and Simmons Simeon begin to bless the Lord mine eyes have seen his salvation can you say Amen and then Anna the prophet has come and begin to Bear witness that this was the Messiah how did they know it was a supernatural thing that happened in their hearts to let them know this is the messiah rejected child a despised a man that child that would grow up being rejected by men criticize ridiculed but God made sure that that believer wouldn't ridiculate God made sure that the believer would recognize him in honor him who he is Peter Peter wouldn't have known him who he was and except it had been revealed Jesus would tell him who do men say that I am and of course they begin to tell them oh Jesus some say you're Elias some say you're one of the prophets some say this some say that and everyone missing the Mark about him and he'd ask him but who do you say and Peter with all boldness and I want to have that boldness today stand up and say the heart to Christ the son of the Living God here's a man that couldn't even write his name couldn't read and yet he would declare the Messiah it was here standing in front of him present day word ain't that right and Jesus let him know Jesus let him know it wasn't it wasn't you Peter that knew this it wasn't you these men are saying missing the mark of who I am because they don't know but to you it's been revealed thank you it's been revealed of my father but then he says Upon This Rock I'll build my church and of course everybody's gone wild with that Catholics say was so poem Peter others say what was Upon Jesus But Here Come a prophet to say oh no it's neither one it's the revelation of who he is God would make sure that he would build his church so that church wouldn't despise him when he would come that he wouldn't just be a cast off like so many have cast him off but when he would come and start working the unusual there would be a people to recognize him and say this is scripture being fulfilled before our eyes can you say amen I love him so we see that it was all a supernatural revelation as a baby he was recognized as a child he was recognized as a man he was recognized there wasn't a set time there wasn't a set age that people had to wait before they could recognize him just as it is today there's no time there's no set age there's no amount of years uh that people must wait before they can recognize Christ in a man woman boy or girl Christ wants to be recognized and if anyone will recognize him it'll be the believer can you say Amen we don't have to wait say well they they got to grow up they you know give them time to grow up oh no once Christ is born in a man's heart you'll know it's there yes there is a growing up but he had to grow up too he had to grow up from that manger to be a man but every stage of his life there was someone to Bear record that it was him it was him in the manger someone was there to say this is him he's Messiah ain't that right they didn't have to wait till he was a full-grown man they didn't have to wait till he was on the cross they didn't have to wait till he rose again there was somebody with the Revelation to say that's Christ and that that's Christ in that manger I'd say there's a revelation today that when you get around the believer you get around a a a a a a one that Christ has been born in you can look and say that's Christ in that man might be simple it might be just a young babe in Christ but that's Christ something Bear's record of him ain't that right John 14 18. I hope this all right I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you all you think of that God knew the manger he was going to come to when he had Jesus in mind and he predestinated that baby he knew the manger he was going to come to he knew that little stable he was going to come to he knew the place now he looked and says but I'm going to come to you oh my I will not leave you comfortless in yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also oh he couldn't Quicken that little manger there was nothing in that manger to Quicken there was nothing in that little stable to Quicken but oh he says when I come to you though you'll live you'll live because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I'm in my father and you and me and I in you can you say man as he prepared that manger it was no accident that the man would kick him out and say there's no room for you amen because God didn't predestinate that little hotel or whatever it was for him to be born in God had a Manger God had a little cradle God had it all I had it all prepared before the foundation of the world and God coming to you is no mistake either he had you prepared before the foundation of the world and say when I return I know what heart I will come into I know when I'll be born I know the place I will be born and the Heart can you say man Paul says the glory of this mystery and it is a mystery that it is a mystery amen too unusual but it's Christ in you the hope of glory ain't that right so if Christ is truly dwelling in an individual he will be recognized whether it's in its infant stage or whether it's in it it's uh adolescent stage or the matured stage the supernatural will be manifested to make him known are you with me amen it'll make him known that's right and that manifestation of the supernatural will point to the word being fulfilled ain't that right it'll be unusual to the world because they have their own ideas their own teachings and doctrines of the scripture I look at it today and we know it we know it but I'll tell you young people Revelations 10 1 is unusual can you say man talking about is coming amen Revelations 10 1 is unusual Luke 17 30 is unusual first Thessalonians 4 16 is unusual Daniel 2 34 is unusual talking about the stone coming to strike down that Gentile image it's unusual Revelations 8 is unusual amen all of these scriptures are unusual but it's still saying it's still the truth can you say Amen but it's unusual because they've grabbed a hold of fictitious doctrines and fictitious teachings and Creeds and things like that and yet the truth is there but you'll never see Christ in any of their fictitious ways in any of their fictitious sermons and any fictitious worship that they may have you'll never see Christ you'll see Christ in the word in the truth can you say amen that's exactly right see and so these scriptures plus many many more speak of the promise of the same Christ coming to the Earth amen there were scriptures of the Messiah coming to the Earth 2 000 years ago and the church World rejected it and they're still saying we're looking for him we're looking for him you know what they're saying the same thing today and then you say man they're saying the same thing today and yet they're missing the coming they're missing it all together because they've got their own fictitious ideas of how he's going to come when he's going to come where he's going to come and yet the Bible says he would come as a secret as a thief in the night hello church he coming as a thief in the night that's exactly right and the world's going to miss him ain't that right it's already said it but I'm so glad it's been revealed is coming his birth amen and I still say to you he still despised he's still rejected of men he's not looked upon as the pearl of great price that it's still scripture being fulfilled regardless of what they say how many people walk past that stable that day not knowing that scripture was being fulfilled inside there how many people might have heard the whale of a baby and not knowing it was scripture or God became one of us can you say Amen it's so true now Jesus promised that he would be in US till the end of the world I'm going to close but as it took a birth for him to come to the Earth two thousand years ago it still takes a birth for him to come in the manger of our heart ain't that right and Christmas is about the birth of Christ so this is why Christmas is somewhat personal thing for the believer this is why we don't need Santa Claus we don't need their fictitious story whereas what the prophet said put Christ back in Christmas oh my aren't you glad for that you see Christmas means nothing if he hasn't been born in you that's right I don't mean to say this ain't a special time with friends and family and eating the turkey and the giving of gifts brother Brown gave gifts brother Brown said Merry Christmas brother Branham had a tree argue with it it's either your ideas or what he did you you can say all you want to well he wanted to get rid of it because you know they use that one quote well they got the couple that they they misuse but they you know they they say well you know Brad Brown said we need to quit but we're swapping these gifts and the tinsel and this and that and we'll have more of the supernatural so you know this quote of it you know what I'd like to ask them here's a man that was in 63 right 63. he had already spoke squirrels into existence he had already stopped the storm he had already raised the Dead I'd like to ask you where's your phenomenal amen if that's what's going to stop it swapping gifts and the Christmas tree and all of that okay you're not doing it where's your Supernatural have you raised the dead lately hello have you spoken the third pool yet have you spoke squirrels into existence so maybe there's some different meaning that brother Branham had than what you're putting on to it hello he continued on and I'll I'll just you know I've said I ain't gonna let no devil stop and stop me I I don't care whether you have one or not but don't make make it sin to have these things don't make it brother Brown told us it was Pagan he told us that before he told us he had one he told us all about Christmas how Pagan it was and the way the world does it one thing he did stay true with and told us about is don't talk about Santa Claus don't tell your children about Santa Claus it's a lie so what he's saying ain't that right so so what I'm saying is people putting this pressure as if you're a sinner if you're if you're doing these I don't care if you do it or not but don't have Santa Claus don't teach children about Santa Claus that's lying that's just flat line ain't that right so that's that's your personal beliefs or personal thing but I'm just telling you if you're going to use that quote and saying well our Christmas tree swapping gifts and all that singing you know Merry Christmas saying Merry Christmas and singing Christmas songs is stopping the phenomenal the phenomenal state with brother Branham all the time hello and if he was still here the phenomenal would still be with him the supernatural he's the one that stayed in the presence of God I don't know about y'all I haven't had an angel appear to me and talk to me about things that the angel of God did Brother Branham so to say that we've outgrown brother Brandon brother Brandon just wasn't mature and weave out I don't know I'm just you know didn't mean to get off there but anyways it was there but I'm going to tell you that Christmas means more than gifts and a real believer understands that Christmas means more than gifts Christmas means more than lights Christmas means more than Merry Christmas means more than than Christmas songs Christmas means more than all the the the tree and and all that and and I'm going to be honest with you I don't believe that God and I'm not saying it's wrong I'm just saying I don't believe that God uh uh intended for us to honor Christmas by way of recreating the nativity scene that I'm not saying that that's wrong if you want to have a nativity scene God bless you for that and and and there's nothing wrong with that but if you're stopping there and that's all Christmas is to you is is recreating a nativity scene something's wrong that's all I'm saying you will never find the real reason for Christmas until Christ is born in you he was born in that day for you to be redeemed can you say man he was born in a manger so he could be born in your heart that's what he wanted he wanted to live in men ain't that right he wanted to live in boys and girls he he that was his desire that he couldn't do it until the first Christmas came that he could be born in the body he created in now he comes and is born in a redeemed body ain't that right so it's the birth of Christ that's what Christmas is is about the birth of Christ but the birth must not be just left a historical what is it Historical Society we we we're not here to make a museum about it just as much as we're not here to make a museum about a prophet what good does the message do you when you're just putting it all on a prophet can you say Amen so there have to be a supernatural birth in order for messiah to be on earth ain't that right the birth was a supernatural birth and it still takes a supernatural birth for messiah to be on Earth today ain't that right it's a creation what was it what was that birth all about a creation of the word of God It produced Christ and if it's going to produce if Christ is going to be produced in you it's got to be the creative word again that's right the same Supernatural power that created Christ in the womb of Mary is the same Supernatural power that's creating Christ in your heart ain't that right and without that you ain't had a Christmas and that birth think of it that birth today will be just as unusual as that birth back ain't that right but though it may be unusual it'll be scriptural you believe it you love him okay I've kept you I've got a lot more to go I didn't really I thought 45 minutes I'd stay sorry but love you appreciate you and I do pray you have a wonderful day today but remember don't treat Christmas like the world does puts it all historical but when God is trying to do something today we don't want it and we despise it we reject it but I believe here this morning you've come because Christmas means more than just the birth of 2000 years ago I believe you've had that birth in your heart and you know what it's about and you just come to honor him to glorify him do you love him if the musicians will come you know everything that God does will be criticized ridiculed and spoke against because of the unusualness of it Christ's testimony was unusual people wouldn't believe it his life was unusual people wouldn't believe it but the only one that would salt was those that were ordained they really believed it and that's the same thing today to speak of a risen Christ how unusual that would be so let's shift to a rabbit laying eggs [Music] and that's more believable than to say he's risen today can you say man and today most of the world celebrates Christmas and Easter but not for the same reason that the Shepherds celebrated the birth it had been revealed to the Shepherds as to who that baby was so when they came to that baby [Music] they knew they were seeing present day word fulfilled that was the Christ child ain't that right and again the world they're celebrating the birth or Christmas but it's something fictitious it's either about Santa Claus they've taken the prophet says that they've taken Christ out and replaced him with Santa Claus or they're worshiping something historical ain't that right today millions of people come to worship the Christ child but not as the wise men did [Music] ain't that right because you see if they would worship as the wise men they would have to follow the star that led them to Christ in the first place is that right and when they came to the that child of two years old or so they presented the exact right gifts to him testified they knew exactly who he was ain't that Ryan you love the Lord you know those that recognize him stop looking for him when the wise men came to him they stopped looking Joseph and Mary they stopped saying we're looking for messiah we're looking for messiah it's we found him the Shepherds they kept they quit looking they found him and the rest of the world still looking and it's the same way today looking for messiah brother Bram talks about it so much they're looking for a messiah to bring peace on the earth they're looking for a messiah and yet God has brought him in this age which is the word made flesh word manifest it ain't that right Bram said we've already got it God gave it to us it's his promise for this hour we look in the Bible we see it everywhere Through the Bible anointed ones come on and may that word live again right in the hour for that hour and we've got the Messiah this is him the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the word remains God Hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday today and forever we know everybody say we know we know what is supposed to take place in this day we're wanting Messiah God gave us the Messiah his promised word for this day it's just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again it's a real Messiah it's the word of God Amen so he says today we're not worshiping a baby in a Manger not Santa Claus but we're worshiping almighty God in the deity of his son and we know what the prophet say deity is not in heaven it's in you deity is in you aren't you glad for it oh my if it hadn't been for that first Christmas where would we be we'd be left without an experience with God we'd be left void but thank God for him hallelujah oh I love you oh come let us [Music] adore him come let us oh come let us adore [Music] him cry [Music] for ye the Lord his words [Music] he cried foreign [Music] oh yeah he alone his words [Music] one more time for he [Music] is worth for he alone his worthy for him world War we cried [Music] cry but stand to our feet God bless you again may you have a wonderful Christmas wonderful time with friends and family may God's blessings rest upon you abundantly amen we love the Lord let's sing that song uh O Little Town of Bethlehem I don't know Daniel may have already sung that one but we'll sing it anyways if we get it at words because I don't know him oh little town of Bethlehem do you know [Music] does anyone know it thank you a little uh [Music] thank you all right let's try it again [Music]
