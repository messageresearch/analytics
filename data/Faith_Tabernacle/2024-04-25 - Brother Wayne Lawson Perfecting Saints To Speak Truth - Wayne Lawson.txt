TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and Mary saw him he said don't touch me remember that but that evening he showed up to the disciples amen and told Thomas to touch me put your hand somebody said brother Wayne what happened I tell you what brother random said happened he's our high priest and he said the high priest could only go in alone so Jesus went to the father by himself but once he made the sacrifice he returned to his disciples and said what things is it that's troubling you the resurrection is already taken place amen the sin has already been forgiven he was standing there in Immortal body he didn't have to go back Alone brother he went in one time and he went in by himself but when he returned back to Glory he said lift up all ye Kates of everlasting life and he took the strengths of God out of the grave and took them into the heavens Hallelujah there is a blood tonight on the sacrif of almighty God there's an altar tonight with a blood on it that says Perfection belongs it belongs to you by one sacrifice so don't try to put yours next to it okay don't say don't tell god well God I did this if you're going to take your works you got to take them all if you're going to take one you got to take them all so either it's your works or his works and I tell you what I did I dropped all mine cuz I tell you what I found out I'm dead from my birth my first work in this life I came into the Earth wrong and whatever else I do I'll never be right but by one Sacrifice by one sacrifice Jesus by one sacrifice I love it don't you he perfected forever and when we are perfect through Christ and we are free from judgment through Christ I know some of you's been dreading that judgment but listen if you've accepted Christ I'm going to give you the scripture now in John 5 and 24 brother Bram said a handful and two dozen eggs two dozen eggs quite a handful John 5 pass from Death unto life and shall not somebody say shall not not come into condemnation that word condemnation is Judgment brother B said because they have already bypassed judgment because they B their judgment in him we are free from judgment through Christ we shall never die through Christ we have lost death and found life through Christ not through any church I better read that again because I think I've heard people say that if you don't come to our church let me read that again we have lost death and found life through Christ not through any church now I believe we ought to have churches and I'm a I'm a preacher and a pastor and I love church and I want to go to church but there's no church can save you come on there ain't just one Church there ain't that great mega church that's going to take everybody in the Rapture there is only one sacrifice and there's only one way it's the Precious Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ no church can take you in no preacher can pack you in amen there has been a sacrifice of mdict in this age well I believe it tonight you'll not get there through dominin so you can you can get a group of guys together and you can start agreeing on your Doctrine and you say well if you don't preach our Dole let me say this I'll never bow to a bunch of men getting their minds together and making up what truth is we are perfected through a sacrifice of the blood of Jesus Christ there's only one man this church bows to it is Jesus Christ the son of the Living God let me say this any man that wants other men to bow to him is sick it's a sick man and he needs to get the Holy [Applause] [Music] Ghost well go I think we're going to have church this [Applause] weekend do you see you'll never get it through any denomination there's something really wrong you know they told Brother Bram that time they h brother Scott you ain't never you ain't never had nobody tell you that I know we took this guy off our book said he can't go to heaven well isn't it amazing that you didn't call me and you didn't save me so you can't get rid of me isn't that amazing he fantastic now listen we were just listening to a tape on the way to church brother Isaac and I were listening coming down the road and we were listening to Perfection 1956 I think it is and brother B said if you were a jean seed and elected he said you might shout or you might not he said you might dance and you might not he said but really it don't make any difference either way you said pre what are you saying I'm saying that your your salvation has nothing to do with your shouting I say your salvation has nothing to do with your tongue speaking your salvation has nothing to do with your day salvation is based upon the fact of whether you receive the blood of Jesus Christ for your sins or not but how can a man ever receive the blood and not feel like shouting a little while not feel like dancing a little while I tell you what I'm so glad tonight that I've got a liberty I've got a liberty in Christ we are free by the blood hallelujah oh if I was a singer I'd sing it free free free from the things of this old world my how do we get in Perfection that's what we want to know how we get there well if you ever figure out how you got there amen you'll know it's a security right the prophet of God said he laid upon him the iniquity of his all he was wounded for our train Isaiah 53 bruised for our iniquity the trasp of our peace was on him Stripes were healed that's the body we want to get into that's the body if you're in that body in that body you'll never see judgment now that's powerful friends I can promise you a way to bypass judgment I can promise you a night tonight I can make a promise to you that you'll never have to to see a judgment bar I can promise to you that you'll never stand before the white Throne of almighty God if you'll get into this body you will never stand in judgment oh my goodness what a place to be you'll never see judgment you'll never taste death you're free from Death judgment sin and everything else when you're in that body how do you get into it preacher by joining this Tabernacle you're lost amen we don't have any book how do we get into it by joining some church no sir how do we get into it you're born into it come on you never joined your family you were born into your family you're never going to join a church that can give you salvation you got to be born into the church that gives you salvation and the Bible tells us this in 1 Corinthians 12 that by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body that's why the new birth is the bapt AP ISM of the Holy Ghost now when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you the same life that was in God has come into you how could you die how could you be lost How Could You sin how could you be unperfect the life that is in you is in the life that was in almighty God it's God God requires Perfection no one says None is perfect so if you must be perfect to get to heaven the scripture says None is perfect we've all s come sin and come short of the glory of God how are we ever going to enter God's living place and Dwelling Place when he requires Perfection Jesus said in the sermon he said be you therefore perfect as my father's in heaven is perfect think of the Perfection that God requires of a person a Perfection Amen in law having a shadow 1956 be you therefore perfect as your father how are you going to do it you going to do it how can you be perfect as god is perfect but that is the commission the Commandment of Jesus is be perfect because God is in heaven then who could be saved see if you could just a moment let's found out how that Perfection is made see God back there in the beginning for saw down through the streak of time and he knew he would have to have a remedy to save those that were Desiring to be saved how many here tonight desire to be saved if you desire to be saved then God made a way for you to be saved isn't that amazing that your desire is what saves you and God himself gave you the desire matter of fact somebody said well brother Wayne self gave you the desire matter of fact somebody said well brother Wayne I blasphemed the Holy Ghost and I went beyond the Blood Brother BR said do you want to serve God and do you love Jesus and the man said yes I love him he said that tells me and he said there was a little hickey in time and we fell into time out of Eternity he said but that's where Redemption is made in that little place that come out of Eternity that's where redemption's made amen that's where your enemy is destroyed that's where the blood comes upon listen now some people say well brother Wayne I tell you why I'm dealing with this devil and I and I I'm afraid I'm not going to make it back do you recognize brother T you would have had to live all of eternity with that devil that haunt you you would have had to live eternally with that thing but God made a little place called time harm you and he's going to destroy him so he can't make it through eternity with you listen let me tell you there is no end to a Son of God but there is an end to the devil the devil will be annihilated and thrown into the Lake of Fire but the Bride of Jesus Christ there will be no end to her life it is eternal in heaven oh I thank God tonight that God made a place it's called time a place where we could bring our enemy and he would be destroyed I tell you when you bring your enemy to the blood the Perfection comes between us and God the blood of Christ is what perfects Us in the Holy Spirit now in 1954 brother bam says J sin's judgment is to take life how people know they can look and see that's how we believe so supremely in the Lord Jesus Jesus I used to think was a Jew and he had Jewish blood and he was born of a Jewish mother but he wasn't of Jewish blood and neither was he Gentile blood he was the blood of God oh he was the blood of God that's why in the church book brother R said it's a perfect loosing if it was the blood of God it is a perfect blood then it's a perfect loosing if it's a perfect blood it's a perfect sacrifice then it has the power to free you completely ly of whatever it is that holds you listen whatever was done in time the blood that came from eternity has been designed to destroy s can I say this many people today are worried about the tribulation period and it's coming but you know what tonight if you're the bride of Christ let me tell you this I ought to truly settle in every heart of every bit of the church that the bride doesn't take tribulation the bride's gone she has not one sin not a thing against her somebody tell me why tell me why what's the three-fold purpose of the six seal the tribulation period remember it's to purge the foolish virgin it's to purge the Earth and it's to purge 144,000 God don't do anything without a purpose and if there is no sin in the bride why would you go through the purpose not even a remembrance of it now you you might remember it but God [Applause] don't and wouldn't it be something if you could get where God is if you could wash your mind in the same blood he's washed your soul in amen that there's one thing but in the presence of God you I just going to say this brother BR types the blood as a bleach y'all all know what the bleach is of course but he types the blood as a bleach and the power of bleach amen if you got any colors on your on on it you can tell everywhere it touch because bleach is powerful and and you know maybe Clorox bleach or maybe tide bleach or maybe generic bleach but whatever bleach is powerful but the bleach I'm talking about didn't come amen from the bleach I'm talking about amen they didn't make it down there at tide they didn't make it over at the Clorox plant but this bleach is a bleach from Heaven that they made this bleach in heaven God spoke a word over Mary and God himself got into a blood cell to produce a bleach that could destroy sin what the blood of bulls and goats could not do the blood of Jesus Christ by one by one touch again amen I hope you're doing okay amen do you see what it is amen that God has purged her and placed her in a place she doesn't have to go through the tribulation he's not trusting in works it's in the blood of Jesus that is confess is dropped into do you see what it is God is a spirit and he overshadowed Mary and created in her a blood cell that brought blood is dismissed woo your sexual blood is dismissed you know how powerful that is because you know some of the things you carry you're carrying from former Generations do you know you're carrying part of the Troubles of your fathers in you do you know this that Abraham that that Levi was in the loins of Abraham four generations and it was Rec recognized to being in now now think about this as you were germinated in the loins of your father even four generations ago then there is sins that hung around your family line now I know nobody likes to talk about this but that's the reason some of you boys have so much trouble with the passion it's because that sin hung around that family line that's why sometimes that nervousness and depressions go along a certain Spirit along a certain family line or there's a high temper that goes along or an unforgiveness or a Jud amen it goes along family lines but let me say something to you tonight amen there's a sacrifice here that can bypass your family lines it can bypass your heritage it can dismiss your sexual birth and give you a new birth in a new blood by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and birth deity on inside of you it's a family line do you see what it is our sexual blood is dismissed and Jes Jesus Christ stands for our atonement making atonement for our sins it's a beautiful picture can I can I just challenge you to say this there is no Perfection outside the blood and there will be no more shedding of the blood so by faith when you hear the word and receive the word it washes the soul and the sanctifying power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost gives you a new life that stands in the presence of God now watch this because now I think I think it's amazing because Paul now says that there is a five-fold Ministry isn't it odd that he's took out the levitical order and for the first time he's talking about preaching and he's talking about offices that God uses to preach do y'all recognize that God preached the word of God to the Saints in the last days do you know that the Bible teaches us that that five-fold is an office of almighty God and brother random said it's actually God's dress wear in other words God gets dressed up in a man and speaks to a congregation as they pull on the gift amen and the spirit of the Lord uses human voices and he uses human being now I know it would be advantageous if he would use Angels amen because Angels ain't got no problems and Angels don't have no issues and and Angels never you never had any spar with them you never had any issues with them amen I know what it is amen but your pastor he's a man and your angelist he's a man and you're they're just men church amen but listen if God Amen wanted to use trees he had them if he wanted to use angels He had them if he wanted to use the Stars he had them but God chose mortal men which Tri knows what it is to get into the blood let me say this God can take a drunk and make a preacher out of him amen and he can tell you that if there's anything that'll get alcohol out of your life it's the power of the blood of Jesus Christ he could take a cigarette smoker or a dope addict and save him and sanctify and put a mic in his hand Amen brother Marky knows how to do it I know people would rather have perfect things preaching to them but God didn't choose perfect things not perfect by man's ideas but perfect through his blood because they were going to be the ministry of the new they were going to preach this New Covenant they're going to take the word and operate under that anointing and preach a Perfection of the people you know it's amazing to me I don't know about you all I don't have a lot of time to spend there but I just I just think it's amazing the way brother Bram talks about the five-fold ministry and he said actually he said an angel in the pull pit had more Authority than an angel in heaven and he said you'll no never be any closer to God can you imagine how much that God has placed on these men now here's the beauty of this is then he told this five-fold ministry to perfect the Saints well you know I was reading that the other day and I I I had to reread that three times for the perfecting of the Saints now wait a minute are you talking about the ones that's in Ephesians 1 that Paul Begins by saying and unto the Saints which are at Ephesus to the Saints brother man picks up that word and he said now I know people believe that you got to be a saint after you die he said but Paul was talking to living people he said a saint means someone Sanctified in the blood that has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that's why the book of Ephesians is not an Evangelical book he said it's a book to Believers and just as Joshua placed the Israel into their Promised Land the book of Ephesians was designed as a new testament Joshua book to put believers who have already received the Holy Ghost and put them in you that Perfection come completely through the blood how am I going to perfect a perfect person it says that doesn't it therefore perfecting the Saints you say preacher amen you got me well it had me too but if you get into the Greek of this there's one time this Greek word is used and this scripture is the only time in the Bible this Greek word is used and it's actually k a t a r t i s o Ms uh C Catos amen but actually what it means is a Furnishing or an equipping it doesn't mean perfecting like the blood perfected you this means that the sons of God was going to take the word of God and equip the Church of the Living God how do you equip this bride you equip her with a word you equip her with love you equip her with knowledge you equip her amen and put the word of God into her hands the Saints of the Living God has got a fourfold Ministry that will take the message of the hour and equip them to whip the devil any place anywhere anytime under any circumstances we're not talking about perfecting the Saints in that we're going to make you a perfect person come on perect but we're perfecting them in the fact we are equipping them now it's it's what the it's only Greek word only time it's used in the Bible because he's talking about perfecting in equipping it's talking about giving you the word you're in a great battle you're in a great conflict and what better way to perfect or equip a man than to give him the word of God a five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints now watch this because the next verses tells you something beautiful it's for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body until we come into the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man now there's that same Greek word again perfect it's the same Greek word unto a perfect man amen but when it's in an English word perfect man but when you go to the it changes words and it uses the word teos which the Greek word teos means a man of full age now other words watch Perfection is a full grown man what he's talking about is that these people will be receiving an that's why you set service after service hear the word of God it's because you're growing in the grace of God unto a perfect man unto an adulthood now watch Paul's going to say something here I hope this is all right it's all right with everybody amen amen now watch this because what he's going to do Under the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ you all know the stature of the perfect man he's saying that the church is going to grow into this stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and for and carried by every wind of Doctrine Now isn't this amazing Paul is saying that the five-fold was going to equip the church and bring them to an adulthood where they wouldn't be tossed around by everything everybody says now you ever seen a kid and you can talk to a kid and you can start telling it one thing amen and it'll start leaning toward whoever is talking to and you can see immaturity in Christians when they go to one meeting they lean a little this way go to one meeting they lean there starts becoming a maturity in your life amen where you're able to stay stable on the word no matter what people are saying what this Gody says this way what that guy says this way amen there's something in your heart that begin to Anchor and stabilize you to the perfect word of God as an adult Christian no longer children tossed to and fro now now it's beautiful because this word children here is actually amen it's the word NEOS n e p i o s it's Greek now but that word nepos actually means a child an infant a minor a childish untaught or unskilled so you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and remain untaught or unskilled you can be perfect under the blood of Jesus Christ and remain untaught and unskilled you can R remain immature as a Christian and be completely a Christian you can be a Son of God completely a Son of God and be immature in your actions in your church goinging you can be immature in your offerings you can be immature in your tithing you can be immature in your relationships the word of God and teach the Church of the Living God what it means to walk right what it means to talk right what it means to love yes sir amen what it does is the bride church is being moved from a baby or a child to a full mature son in Hebrews 5 and 12 I'll read it to you out of the Bible when a time you ought to be teachers you have need one teaching you again the first principles are the oracles and become as one one having need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe now he's perfectly perfect in God but he's not perfect in his to them that are of a full age that word full age is teos it's the same word as perfect in the book of Ephesians but now it's being used as full age but to those that are perfect even as those having by reason of use their senses exercised to discern both good and evil listen discernment comes from understanding of the word of God you begin to look at things and know what it's coming from where it's going how it's going amen every believer in here tonight ought to have discernment but as you grow in the word your discernment become sharper and you begin to understand full age now watch this in galatian chapter 4 He Man Paul says the same writer now he says that they Heir as long as he is a child untaught he differ nothing from a servant being he's Lord of all now what Paul is saying is a father on a farm has a child and he's running around on the farm and he ain't no different than the servants he don't have a checkbook in his hand he's not hiring and firing he's just out there playing in the yard because he is an untaught child now there is a difference between the child and the servant but it's not until the message I mean the teaching comes that you begin to discern the difference between the Son and the servant the Jubilee Trumpet of the Seven Seals will tell you if it's a son or a servant if it's a Son of God they will turn and begin to bring the teaching brother random says it clearly the law of adoption in the church it's not that you went and got somebody's son and made him your son he says it's that you had a son and you're busy in your farm so you hire yourself a tutor and he begins to raise the child according to the way the father's teachings are and that tutor tutors the child and the way and when the child knows the father's business he gives him a checkbook and he tells him you can hire you can fire you can plant you can reap you can Harvest and he gives a full authority to that child because he's a taught child he's no longer a babe he is now an adult he is now no longer just another man he's not just another servant he is an authority now let me say something to you tonight now I know that if your daddy was a farmer you'd be learning farming and if your daddy was a banker you'd be learning banking amen but we are not in our father's business is not banking our father's business is not farming our father's business amen isn't it what Jesus said I was busy about my father's business brother randam said he was busy about his father's business his father's business was vindicating the word of God Amen do you see that when Malachi 4 is Vindicated and Revelations 10 is Vindicated it's the father's business and here tonight you are a part of the Vindication of this message this message has been training and teaching and generation of people come on now amen that by this of God come on we are not back there Pentecostal babies come on we're not we're not back there trying to put a a shoelace through a baby shoe and figure out how it works we have moved from the first into the second and now we have reached the third pool and the third pool was the opening of the word of God a now when we were children we were under bondage somebody said brother Wayne when I got new birth you know I got my checkbook that's not what the prophet taught well it's not I got 1,00 books I can show you where brother Bram said your new birth is not your adoption but I can't show you where one time he said a new birth was adoption because he didn't say it you said brother Wayne I thought I believe well see what it is it's children tossed to and fro from one man's teaching to another man's teaching William brandom taught four parts on adoption and he taught hear you him many many many times and when we can dismiss all of his teaching to take another man's teaching we have reached a stage of immaturity rather than maturity there ought to be a maturity in this bride that'll say I'll say what the prophet said you can hit me cut me beat me throw me out I'll stay with this message I will not Bend I Will Not Bow I will not amen confirm well glory to God it's time to grow up and say what a prophet said somebody said well Wayne what what's it like then brother B said when you get a new birth and the holy ghost coming you in way he said it was he said it was like a button off of your shirt coming into your soul he said and the more it it begins to take over your body and it takes over your hand and it takes over your mouth and it takes over just the way the children of Israel took over that Promised Land the Holy Ghost takes over you and you say well brother Wayne then how far have we come I tell you how far the bride has come she has come to mount Transfiguration she has come to an experience with God that she only hears the word of God isn't it what he heard him say out of that cloud hear ye him if he said hear ye him he's going to speak and he's speaking in the last [Applause] days in Hebrews chap 12 and 22 that's why Paul said you have come to Mount Zion goodness gracious you have come to how far have we come brother Wayne I'll tell you this we've not come to Mount Si we've not just come to Mount Calvary we have come to mount Zion you say what is Mount Zion Mount Zion is the bride it's to the general assembly the Church of the firstborn that were written in heaven and God the judge of all the spirits of just men made perfect the spirits of just men men that are Justified men that are already in the presence of God but there is a perfecting of a believer that moves you from a baby to a man come on chur handle it come on you pick the phone up and you call this guy about this guy and you run and Rattle and fuss and tattle amen and the Bible said that you ought to pick up the phone and call your brother come on church if it's a truth it's the truth if you got an offense with somebody quit telling to them or rebuke them I believe in the oldfashioned Holy Ghost the kind that burns out sin and kills the devil yes sir I I I believe it I certainly believe that there'd be less sickness in the bodies if people would ask forgiveness of one another instead of holding grudges for [Applause] years I believe it like a bunch of kids playing in a toy box outside and one's mad at the other cuz they got their toy and they go tatt on mama let let me the best thing in the world you ever did was love somebody enough to tell them your heart sit down with them and discuss the thing and we need to get this thing right come on friends sometimes we wonder why is there not a revival going on in our church I tell you why cuz we've turned into a bunch of immature people people used to say they're sorry when they were wrong they used to repent when they were wrong come on Church well we might as well preach as a first night ain't it let me say this the water's still there folks I tell you you're standing in a dry place in your life and you're saying other Wayne where's the spirit where's the anointing it's still here it's still right in the same place but all you got to do is start digging and if you'll start digging amen there's water below your feet if you dig past the hurt feeling if you dig past the trouble if you dig past the rumors if you dig past the complex there he is a Holy Ghost of God hallelujah there's a fountain filled with blood flowing through this room tonight so brother Wayne you called us immature I don't really mean that I just mean it's immature ways and now I know all y'all's adults have you ever acted like a kid I remember I got a nice pickup and I was about 22 three just give my heart to the Lord had a real nice Dodge man that thing was a hot ride and I was a Christian and all the cops in town they knew me as the good Lawson they pulled my wife over and they said which one you married to she'd say Wayne oh you're married to the good one and one night I got out there and a bunch of kids standing there I was 22 23 year old pulled out man I got in that Dodge and slid the side of that backup truck around fish tailed it a little bit and smoke was rolling then I looked up and here come the blues rolling he pulled up and pulled up walked right behind I knew him well knew his name he knew me he looked at me he said Wayne how old are you I said old I was old enough to know better you see there's a teaching of the church that brings the righteous to Perfection it's what is the full grown Christian when you think about perfect Christian I'm talking about a full grown Christian whether you like otions and it has reactions and Paul says that it's like it's like being chained up to a dead man a brother Donnie Reagan preached a famous sermon one time I've actually never heard it God bless forgive me brother Donnie but but I've heard the sermon title a lot and I know right where he got it in scripture but what it's talking about is there's an out that's right youen you might have a soul in there that is saved and Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost in one of these days it is Immortal with God but this old body if a Rapture don't comes going to go in the grave because it's a hybrid body but one of these mornings God's going to take the soul and overcome the outside man you're going to have to kill that thing come on Paul said we're going to have to Die daily let me tell you what brother Ram said he said the old man's dead you put him on the cross and you crucified him he said now stay dead that's a good quote ain't it you got to stay [Applause] dead I was up in Canada one time you keep that jet black hair he said I Die daily he said ain't that what the Bible said I don't think it meant that exactly but everything in scripture has reflected the coming of a Perfect Bride I I'm reading the prophet saying that's what Moses and David was reflecting was the coming of a perfect groom he said and that that's what Luther and Wesley and Pentecost was reflecting is the coming of a Perfect Bride can I say to you tonight the alpha has become the Omega the seed has returned to seed again as a corporate bride you have crossed the Jordan Rivers as a as a Church of the Living God we have reached the reals of the place of perfection of the church she is full grown when I say that tonight brother Ram said says of course these messages are kept up for an appointed time now an appointed time was in the adoption ceremony brother Ram teaches it that it was an appointed time that you took the child out and P placed Authority on him these brother said that's when the Angels Came and they publicly made a show over him and they and they and they they showed the authority and the father took him out to a public place and said this is my son and he appointed a time now if you're a studier of the message you'll know right before the Seven Seals opened up which was the Redemption rights of the church which was the inheritance of the church if you remember for the book of Jeremiah you remember when the trey of his uncle's son because under the Jubilee He would have a right was on the inside would be the rights to the property that was in Israel and God took our Redemptive rights and said in the days of the seventh angel messenger when he begins to sound that the rights of the church would come into view again that would be an inheritance Rel leased in the church now just before brother Brandon began the Seven Seals to preach the Redemptive rights of the church he preaches the breach between the church ages and the seals and he's teaching a change of the dispensation he's moving from what this says about it and who this says about it and what that says about it but it's the father taking his own word and now telling and instructing the church in his word now brother bam says this couldn't happen till an appointed time you ever seen the correlation the appointed time of the adoption and the appointed as a student you know them seals have been sealed from the foundation of the world those seals had been sealed up from the time that Adam lost his inheritance he took the Lamb's Book of Life somebody said well brother Wayne wouldn't they open and seal back no brother random actually says Daniel saw it in Daniel 12 but the angel said seal it up until the time of the end so that book had been sealed from the foundation of the world and it held the rights of Adam and could never be released Until the End Time matter of fact that's why in Revelations 5 that John was weeping though he had seen the sacrifice though he had seen the crucifixion though he had seen the seven Church ages and he was still crying because no man had been found worthy to take that book of redemption and open it for the Church of the Living God but according to Revelations 10 that was going to happen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel at the appointed time of the seventh angel there would come a Perfection on the church in 1 Corinthians 13 that's why it says when that which is perfect has come that which is in part will be done away what are we talking about in the parts throughout the ages nobody could fully tell you who you were but when that which is perfect is come you shall be known as you have been known who knew you where were you before the foundation of the world your original identity was in God but it was sealed up until the time of the end and God would release the names of the Bride of Jesus Christ the Queen of Heaven the queen who would have the inheritance the very title deed of the heavens and the earth when that is perfect has come watch what he says in the 11th verse I was a child spake as a child understood as a child thought as a child but when I become a man of your identity and your adulthood in who God made you cuz can I tell you a secret God didn't make you a child he never saw you as a child he never saw you as a sinner he saw you as a son and here comes the instruction manual underneath a message that would develop the church amen and bring it back to a masterpiece and a perfect place with God that's why brother bandom said it's a perfect place calling you to Perfection and how are you going to get there except the perfect word that's why he said it Hebrews 11 they without us cannot be made perfect amen now watch what we're talking about Divine love coming on the cap right now if you want to if you want to carry on with that go to First John chapter 3 and you'll see it again beloved what manner of love hath the father showed us or had upon us that he could call us Sons isn't that amazing that now again what kind of love Agape Love Of course Divine love divine love called you a son be him as he is that's why he says in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 that behold an adult we're looking at the unobscured word of God and as we behold the word we are changed changed oh changed changed from Glory un Glory that's why if you if you like to read the Bible That's why Paul continues in the book of Ephesians 4 here and said now what you ought to do is put off The Old Man and the conversation of the old man and put on the new man and be renewed in the spirit of your mind now what he's talking about is adulthood new man now a new man is not your New Birth come on you've already been born again how are you going to put on a new man it's the power of transformation amen if you like to read Ephesians chapter 4 putting on the new man just go to Romans chap 12 and verse 2 and of your mind so the Church of the Living God is to be transformed now what does that look like what does a transformation of a Christian looks like come on now we're not talking about a new birth you're talking about a transformation power of transformation brother B Begins by saying now that we've been born again now that we've been filled with the Holy Ghost what must we do he said we must be transformed into the image of the Living God a transformation of the in has life it has begun but it's on a journey to adulthood come on friends you watch that little fellon he's swimming along looks like all the other fish but give him a little time he just keeps eating L and as he eats he begins to grow arms and then he begins to grow amen lungs were he would he see he just had gills and all of the sudden he starts growing lungs he starts growing feet you know why because he's being developed for another world all he knows about it is this underwater that's all he knows is this water he can breathe there he can operate there one place to another place and when that frog comes to a full grown man there he goes right out of the water and he can get on the bank and he can get in the water and he can go from one dimension to another dimension he can go to work on Monday and he can go to the house of God on Wednesday he can come in and be under load but just start preaching the word just start preaching faith and that believer begins to break out of one dimension and go into another dimension because they're sons of God another great metamorphosis transform metamorphosis Greek word another great metamorphosis from a caterpillar to a butterfly and if you study the monarch butterfly do y'all know there's about four stages to the butterfly and when it starts out as a larva it begins to grow but it's not where it's the starts not finish at all but you know what it does to get there it eats let me say you receive the Holy Ghost everything you need is in you right then it's so preacher how's it get out of me you eat and drink and push brother bam said you just eat and drink and he said it'll come right out of you no Dove ever put its own feathers in its body it just grows them and when that little caterpillar starts developing you know what's amazing to me he's an Earthbound creature he's crawling around like a little worm but all of a sudden he goes up in height he hey man isn't it beautiful he's going up and he goes up a tree and I tell you what maybe he don't even want to go maybe he don't even want to move from where he is he likes he's comfortable down here secure on the ground you know but there's an absolute power over him that says you're more the ground you're more than this and I didn't I didn't make you a caterpillar I made you a butterfly listen God never invented a caterpillar as a finished stage he designed the butterfly the monarch butterfly is God's design and a caterpillar is just a keeps developing and the beautiful thing is he never has to add anything to him isn't that amazing everything added comes from within if he just eat he already has faith and knowledge and Temperance and kindness come on church every a on an apple tree is in the seed it just needs Water Church of the Living God if we just water this seed but the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a growth that begins out inside of it and it begins to grow and the next thing you know you find yourself up there in the hots and a caterpillar climbs up there and brother brother sea it reaches out and hangs on to the limb and you know what's amazing as it hangs it naturally turns into a j yep even nature knows his name's Jesus isn't that beautiful it wasn't yosua wasn't Jehovah it wasn't any other kind of super spiritual name you can add to it just Jesus just even the caterpillar knows the power of transformation is in Jesus amen and you know what's amazing when he hangs there he develops a shell and it's not even a public show and he's put inside there and nothing else is has added but there's a significant change going on on the inside Church of the Living God God knew where he was going to begin with and God had a picture of you as a son and daughter of God ruling Supreme Over The Devil and sin and your flesh and there's something going on in you tonight it's behind the veil it's a third P message it is a secret thing and it's happening to every believer in this building if you begin to feed on the word of God you might not know when it happened but one day you'll wake up with wings and you can reach out and fire and go in the hot you never [Music] knew you can leave the ground power of the Holy Ghost he said preacher what are you getting at let me tell you what the object of this entire maturity you know what it is because God designed you to speak isn't that amazing what real adult hood is is is speech and when Paul gets here he says what Happ that we they speak the truth in love now let me say something to you do you know just don't preach on that baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus just don't teach on that predestination like you do don't you dare say that you're a prophet that seventh angel that you're saying with all the schools we have built to say what the seals are now you're going to tell us what the seals are but it was Commission of God and showed us in the scripture where his commission was and the third pull of his ministry was not prophesied it was not a healing it was the opening of the word that would take you back to the original state that God saw you in the beginning that's why the prophet said back to the word back to the word church back to the word of God back to something that can take you out of the flesh it can take you out of your moods it can take a church into the presence of God it doesn't matter how low you get this word can lift you into the presence of God get back to the word look at what he was screaming back to the word back to the word and they were building sanctuaries and schools and they were building great things and he was saying back to the word back to the word and they begin rejecting him and when the Great rejection came he went over to the book of when Deus forsook Paul and Paul only had one coat and and remember Paul's rejection y'all remember that isn't it amazing he had a man named Deus shakaron which that's that Kardashian girl it's his granddaughter just take the word Kardashian back it up and start spelling it you'll find sharan Deus shakarian forsook William bram's Ministry and his grandchildren have become the Fashion Queens of this age they took a different pattern and they said we don't have to listen to you what you say about women cutting their hair and how they're supposed to dress who are you to say we're we're we're shouting we're speaking in tongues we're doing what we want we got the spirit moving how who are you to say that we're baptizing wrong spirit moves in our church every night who are you to say that we got predestination wrong do you do you see what was going on back there they were actually had great signs and wonders all around brother Brandon when he started preaching the message and he started saying this is the truth on this and this is the truth on this and this is the truth on this and this is the truth on this and brother Bram said and then all of the sudden I began to get a complex y'all remember he began to get a complex and he decided that he was going to pull off the field and going to go up in the mountains I'll make a short long story very short he was just going to pull off the mountain brother Mark I know you've never felt like doing that know it's never been none of these men of gods ever felt that brother Bram was Li himself in that you know and being factious very but when he got his mind all made up how he was going to get out of it you remember what he did he said he said he he he was he had that dream of him and his brother-in-law how many knows the dream I want to see your hands so I know how much of it to tell you know the dream he's talking about brother Braham had a dream of his brother-in-law who had become a drunk and he and he didn't have anything brother Braham said he didn't had a place to live nothing else he was a bum basically and brother Braham had a dream that he was with his brother-in-law his drunk bum and they were out in a trash pile and he said they didn't have a home they didn't have any money they were just sitting around an old fire and he said his brother-in-law invited him to his fire and give him a home brother bam said now he said I wondered what that dream meant and he said a little while later he said I was out in I think it was in Montana wasn't the state he's in Montana he was out in Montana with Billy Paul and he said we walked into a restaurant early one morning and he said I still had this on my mind I was going to leave the field and go up here and he said and I was sitting there think about and this big mountain man walked in the room and he said he was a real Burly farmer Ranch Hand kind of guy not Mountain Man Rancher sorry and he said said he said when I seen him he said I thought that think you can be what you want to be but all of a sudden brother B said when I watched that guy had great and just admiration for him he looked like he had a little money and he was dressed nice and he was just a man's man he said and all of the sudden he said I heard a commotion he said looked over and he said to my right looked over there to my right and he said there there it was he said there was me and Fletcher he said there was a guy looked just like me and a guy that looked just like Fletcher and he said as we were sitting there he said Billy said Daddy there's you in Fletcher right there and then while he was and then while he was talking to him he said they couldn't even get enough money for breakfast he said they maybe had enough money between them to have a maybe to have a coffee or something and he said I was sitting there watching it and he said a voice spoke to me and he said no that's what you're going to be isn't it amazing that brother Bram had himself figured out to be one thing but God said if you do what's on your mind that's what you're going to be see without god without God you as a Believer are not going to be what you think you're going to be when you make up your mind that you're not going to serve God's purpose for your life you're not going to be what you think you can be without God you are nothing without God you're nothing but with God look brother Bram then he turns remember he turns and goes down the road and looks and God said there it is I wrote your name in the mountains that Elijah spirit that mountain was his Bible and he said there my name was written brandom and he said three of them Peaks and b r a n h a m there them there them mountains was now young men I want tell you something them mountains were there before brother brand was born do you know them mountains was there and there were seven mountain peaks before William Brandon was ever born and then God had you on his mind before Abraham ever had an Ang change because there would be a seven lettered man with h m come in the end time with a message of adoption to the Church of the Living God something that would position the church in the word of God and there his name was in them mountains and brother Ram said I heard the voice say you are more than a prophet that's John the Baptist you're more than a prophet and brother man said right there it was now I understood what that prophecy was over my life because thou H chose the harder way that that great decision will be the victory in love divine I'm not off of my subject the victory in love divine was William brandom deciding to preach the truth even under rejection even when the Pentecostals were leaving him by The Groves he preached the truth anyhow let me say something tonight I believe God still got men in these last days he still got message preachers all over the country and all over the world Amen that said brother random you didn't do it in vain when he went beyond the curtain of time brother Mark he said I seen Millions coming and I said and them all randoms he said no they're your converts and they said with one voice if you hadn't come we wouldn't be here but we are already there because of the message all Church of the Living God I think it's high time for the bride of Christ to grow up and speak the truth of this word has growed you to be a full son and daughter of God you've got a right to take this message you've got a right to take a hold of this message can I tell you something it's time to tell the truth it's time to tell the truth about who you really are you're not just another person you're the Son and Daughter of God was a gene and God before that was a world Amen ever been paid for it's time for the truth to come out brother brandham you remember brother brandham you remember in his room after he saw that Vision telling that he told that serpent he bound it and loosed it and bound it and loosed it next morning he woke up and the devil standing in the corner of his room he said you got no power over me you got no power over me and you know what brother Bram said to him he said Satan you offend me get behind me you offend me because see Satan is a bluff and let me say something to you tonight if he would tell the prophet that he had no Authority what he going to tell you if he'll tell a prophet of God that had just saw a vision you don't have any authority over me he's going to tell you the same thing but let me say something to you tonight you've got Authority he said Peter on this rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it you've got a right to bind the devil to tonight youve got a right to loose the devil in eternity let me tell you the truth about the bride I come from God I'm going back to God let me tell you the truth there ain't enough Devils out of hell to stop this bride from going in a Rapture let me tell you the truth we're already saved we're already Sanctified we're already filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you truth about you the devil's after you but he can't have you the message has already claims you thus sayith the Lord there will be a bride there will be a Rapture Hallelujah there's a message spoke over your life already something spoke over me folks I'm marri's under my birth it's a diamond birth birth sign under that birth but I've had another birth you know what consolation that was it was seven angels you said brother Wayne what's it matter cuz brother B said this he said the Pentecostals had a different parent he said but we've been born of the parent of this word and amen and let me say this the devil ain't my daddy and the Baptist ain't my daddy and the Lutheran Ain't My Daddy are you hearing me this word is my daddy and amen I am about my father's business somebody said I've God in this age we have a parent we've got a father it's the word of God I remember as a kid brother Aaron I remember people could do things and they said brother when you want to go do this I said no way they said why not cuz I said cuz I'm my mama ain't did she's different than your mama no sir my mama on and on and on heyen I can't do it can't do it amen I've seen people they amen they they they they just they just go on and I me amen I got a different daddy I've seen people can say anything they want to but I got a different daddy I've seen people can do whatever they want to I got you're not my [Applause] daddy come on Hollywood is not my [Applause] daddy see you got a different parent and because you got a different parent now you're under that word speaking the truth see the Capstone Ministry of William brandom was to tell the truth of the word of God is't that amazing the great victory in love was to speak the truth somebody said brother Wayne I can't preach that baptism in the Holy Ghost you don't love the people then somebody said well you know you get among a bunch of intellects and they it's odd because some of the things I'm teaching tonight I've heard intellects teach you know we're in the bright age and we're past emotion and and and they get out there in that realm where God don't move no more and it's just how could you love people and not offer them the baptism of the Holy Ghost how could you love people and not offer them an experience with a living God how how could you honestly love people and not tell them the full counsel of God that a man a man can get so in the presence of God that he can lose his senses that he can forget what his name is do yall know brother R said you already to get in god like that he said you ought to get so far in God you lose you in the spirit see Love Will Tell the whole truth love love love will make you tell the truth when it's in a place that don't want to hear truth you see speaking the truth in love it's time to tell the truth about who you are just tell it quit being ashamed of it just tell the devil I hey look God called me I never will forget I never will forget this now Satan will challenge you and you you ministers know what I'm talking about I remember some the first times I was overseas and Demon spirits come up and and now demons man if you've never seen it it still happens demon manifestation they brought her up in the prayer line they used to be on video I don't know what I did with it brother Hunter was there he watched it happen we stood there and work with that woman 25 minutes or so and the power of God come into that room and it so delivered that woman that she she walked out of there completely free because the truth is that this this gospel still has power it still can deliver Hearts we don't need to replace the gospel for psychology friends we don't need to get more intellectual we need to speak the truth speak the truth about who God made you and what you can do and where you can go Mark 16 says it in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall lay hands on the sick they shall speak with new tongues come on thou have chose the harder way will spoke in tongues speak the truth about it we not turn into a dead Church an adult Church come on why time to run the devil off I think it is I think it's high time to remember the enemy is that devil and it's time to remember you're a child of God and put that devil on the run tonight speaking the truth in love won't you stand to your feet with me I'm sorry I'm going long stand to your feet with me tonight speaking the truth in love Capstone Ministry of William bradam he was rejected for the opening of the seals but as Jesus went to Calvary what was it it was divine love projecting Sovereign Grace this message projected Sovereign Grace at the Capstone crying Grace Grace can you imagine where you'd be tonight without the message of the arm where would you be some of you some of you have come out of situations you you know what I'm talking about you come out of church religions and look how bound you were and then the Holy Spirit began to speak truth to you begin to release you you said brother Wayne how how does it how is it bondage I'll tell you how it's bondage if if you get into a place where you can't just say what a prophet said about about something it's bondage just we come out of that already already been there and as a full grown son speak the truth not mean not angry but knowing who you're father is tell that devil tonight I'm a Child of [Music] God you ever notice that how the devil will put certain certain quotes in the message you ever knows how a devil do that it'll come up to you and all of a sudden you'll feel a little fear about it like you were perfect sinless before the foundation of the world you see that fear let it out of your mouth let it out of your mouth is that odd the war he has against you saying I got a whole bunch of quotes up here I I don't have time to preach them but you know what the prophet said about you he says that she would be the final voice of the final age and that she would say what the messenger said the spirit the prophet the bride would say the same thing is't that amazing say say why does the enemy want to keep you from saying it why is there such a war on Sayan cuz Satan is trying to take your [Music] voice don't give him your voice I was thinking on the way to church tonight I was thinking about sister Lena used to saying that the facts and the truth you know I think about all the facts stacked up against you but the real truth the real truth is there's nothing against you you're free do you love him tonight I know it's the first night
