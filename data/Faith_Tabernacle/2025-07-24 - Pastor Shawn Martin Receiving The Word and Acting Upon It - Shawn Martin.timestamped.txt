[35:24] And by his word

[35:35] [Music]
[35:38] Well, do you believe that
[35:41] by his word? It's the only way we will
[35:43] overcome. Amen. Is is by the word of the
[35:47] Lord. And um I'm so glad that we have
[35:51] have the word as our our refuge.
[35:56] We're not just here gaining knowledge,
[35:59] something that makes us smarter than
[36:02] maybe someone else down the street about
[36:04] the Bible, but God is equipping us to
[36:08] overcome. Amen. That's what it's all
[36:11] about. It ain't it ain't making us a
[36:13] genius in the word. It's just it's just
[36:17] giving us the authority and giving us
[36:20] the ability to overcome.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so glad for that. Uh the
[36:26] musicians can be dismissed and it is uh
[36:31] certainly good to be in the house of the
[36:33] Lord and to see everyone. Amen. Good to
[36:37] have our visitor. God bless you. And um
[36:41] uh we're just thankful to be in the army
[36:44] of the Lord.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be a soldier.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be a soldier?
[36:50] &gt;&gt; We could just be laying down and just
[36:52] letting the devil just run all over us,
[36:53] but I'm I'm a soldier in the army of the
[36:57] Lord. And um uh if you have your Bibles,
[37:00] we're going to turn first of all to the
[37:02] book of Matthew, the ninth chapter. And
[37:06] um
[37:08] I want to just say thank you for praying
[37:12] uh for Sister Martha
[37:14] and um as well as Sister Crystal and
[37:18] both having some complications and um I
[37:23] think they've discovered it's a virus
[37:25] that Sister Crystal has, but she's very
[37:28] weak and so uh but she is home and so um
[37:33] we want to uh just keep her in our
[37:36] prayer. And um u sister Martha is in the
[37:40] hospital and u they're going to um they
[37:45] did a biopsy today and u just trying to
[37:49] figure out what to do next and uh
[37:53] they've got a
[37:55] a team of a team of doctors together and
[38:00] um uh I asked the doctor, you know, is
[38:03] something that they're going to be
[38:05] operating and she said that will be the
[38:07] the least thing at this point. Uh they
[38:11] want to uh go in and and try to get the
[38:15] mass smaller as much as they can. And so
[38:21] um so you know uh but they've done the
[38:24] biopsy so she'll get the results within
[38:27] two I think three days something like
[38:29] that. Uh but the uh uh this mass has
[38:36] intertwined itself around her colon I
[38:40] believe it is and u and around her
[38:44] intestines some of her intestines and so
[38:48] she's been in just a lot of pain and um
[38:52] and so just just for them to touch her
[38:55] uh really hurts and so we want to keep
[38:58] her in prayer. They've kept her under
[39:00] morphine all day today and she has just
[39:03] felt so she said this makes me feel
[39:05] horrible, you know, and just kind of
[39:08] buzzed a little bit and um and so but
[39:12] the the vomiting has stopped. They've
[39:14] given her some medication for that. Uh
[39:16] they more than likely if she is they see
[39:20] her improving, they're going to let her
[39:22] go tomorrow uh with some uh medication
[39:26] to keep the nausea
[39:29] down as well as the pain. And so we're
[39:33] we're thankful, you know, for that. Uh
[39:36] she was very dehydrated. Um uh when I
[39:42] was well I was there most of the day
[39:44] today and they were giving her all day
[39:47] uh fluids just pouring fluids in her and
[39:51] so she she must have been pretty pretty
[39:53] bad dehydrated but she is feeling better
[39:57] uh just really tired and uh can't sleep
[40:00] right now. And so we want to just pray
[40:03] that God will help her get some rest and
[40:06] u and just uh be with them, her and
[40:10] brother Tim and but they really
[40:12] appreciate uh your your prayers, your
[40:16] thoughts and Amen. And so and I know
[40:19] sister Crystal does as well. You know,
[40:22] Satan is fighting, but that's okay.
[40:24] We're fighters.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. He picked the wrong people.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; That's the way I see it. Right.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're not sitting here and uh
[40:36] falling apart, but uh we're just looking
[40:39] at that devil and just thinking, why
[40:41] would you even pick on us? You know,
[40:44] we're going to get you. And so, uh we
[40:47] love the Lord.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Matthew the 9th chapter and uh the 18th
[40:53] verse. We're going to start there.
[40:58] So while he spake these things
[41:01] uh unto them, behold, there came a
[41:04] certain ruler and worshiped him, saying,
[41:06] "My daughter is even now dead.
[41:10] But come and lay thy hand upon her, and
[41:13] she shall live." And Jesus arose and
[41:16] followed him, and so did his disciples.
[41:19] And behold, a woman which was diseased
[41:22] with an issue of blood 12 years came
[41:25] behind him and touched the hymn of his
[41:28] garment. For she said within herself,
[41:30] "If I may but touch his garment, I shall
[41:34] behold."
[41:35] But Jesus turned him about.
[41:40] And when he saw her, he said, "Daughter,
[41:43] be of good comfort. Thy faith, everybody
[41:47] say, "Thy faith hath made thee whole."
[41:50] And the woman was made whole from that
[41:53] hour. Amen. If you'll turn also Mark uh
[41:57] the 11th chapter, we're very familiar
[41:59] with these scriptures, but uh but these
[42:02] are our scriptures.
[42:04] Amen.
[42:08] And we're going to break in the story
[42:10] here. But uh the 22nd, Mark 11:22,
[42:14] and Jesus answering sith unto them, have
[42:18] faith in God. For verily I say unto you,
[42:21] that whosoever shall say unto this
[42:23] mountain, be thou removed, and be thou
[42:26] cast into the sea, and shall not doubt
[42:28] in his heart, but shall believe, that
[42:30] those things which he saith, shall come
[42:33] to pass, he shall have whatsoever he
[42:37] saith. Therefore, I say unto you, what
[42:39] things soever you desire when you pray,
[42:42] believe that you receive them, and you
[42:45] shall have them. Let's bow our heads in
[42:49] a word of prayer. Father,
[42:52] what would we do if we didn't have your
[42:56] word to stand upon?
[42:59] For you have declared that heaven and
[43:01] earth will pass away, but your word will
[43:03] never pass away.
[43:05] And father, we don't want to stand on
[43:09] things that are just temporal. We don't
[43:12] want to build our hope and our our faith
[43:16] and our life around the temporal things.
[43:18] But may Lord, we we build it upon your
[43:22] word, eternal things. Father, for if we
[43:26] build it upon that, then we too shall
[43:28] last. We too shall endure.
[43:31] Oh God, we're so thankful that you have
[43:34] given us your word in this hour. And I
[43:37] pray, Father, that as we administer this
[43:39] evening, that you would not only anoint
[43:42] myself, but anoint the people, anoint my
[43:46] lips to speak, Father, and anoint the
[43:48] people's hearts to receive. Father, I
[43:52] just uh ask that you would have your way
[43:55] and and in this service and we commit it
[43:58] into your hands now in Jesus Christ's
[44:01] name. Amen. You can have your seats this
[44:06] evening. Amen. Maybe if you could turn
[44:09] these up just a little bit. Um so um I I
[44:15] want to
[44:16] uh my title I guess would be receiving
[44:20] the word and acting upon it. And um I I
[44:25] have talked about the gentile woman
[44:29] uh who came to Jesus and uh when she got
[44:34] to him, the Lord insulted her by calling
[44:37] her a dog, which that's what the
[44:39] Gentiles basically were considered to
[44:42] be, just the lowest of loaves. They were
[44:45] heathens. But here is another woman that
[44:50] um had a need and and she had this issue
[44:54] of blood um for uh 12 years and u the
[45:01] Bible says in another place that she had
[45:03] suffered many things from uh of many muh
[45:07] physicians.
[45:09] She had spent all that she had and the
[45:12] prophet would tell us that she was a
[45:14] farmer's wife. and that she uh helped
[45:18] her husband and and just wasn't really
[45:21] wealthy, but um and so but but she she
[45:26] needed something because uh she needed
[45:29] help, but the doctors couldn't help her
[45:32] and uh so she'd spent all of her money
[45:34] and the Bible says she just continued to
[45:36] get worse and worse and worse. So, no
[45:39] doubt that she was getting really weak
[45:42] and and um uh the doctors just didn't
[45:46] know what to do for her and they were
[45:48] maybe perplexed at the situation and I I
[45:53] have no doubt that you know and and this
[45:57] is just my thinking but is that she
[46:01] probably began to worry Satan probably
[46:04] putting worry in her mind about the
[46:07] future and you what are you going to do?
[46:10] Uh you're just going to waste away. um
[46:13] you know um eventually you're going to
[46:15] die and da da da and you know that's
[46:18] that's just the way of humanity
[46:21] uh to where worry sets in um when things
[46:27] um aren't getting better and um um and
[46:32] then you know certain certain demons and
[46:35] I call it demons we disease demons they
[46:38] they have this reputation that follows
[46:41] them and uh and they tend when they
[46:45] strike they tend to build fear in in
[46:48] people and um uh but that is the way of
[46:52] humanity
[46:53] uh is to worry. But I I want to make it
[46:58] really clear because the prophet did so
[47:02] &gt;&gt; and he said worry has no value in it.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:07] Now, a prophet when he came, you know, I
[47:10] I thank the Lord for the the the the
[47:13] great mysteries that have been opened up
[47:15] to us. And I I you know, you you thank
[47:19] the Lord for the the seals being opened
[47:21] and and they all play a key. They all
[47:24] they have an important part for us going
[47:26] in the rapture and things like that. But
[47:30] I also thank God for sending a prophet
[47:34] to change to change our attitude about
[47:38] things,
[47:39] &gt;&gt; to change our outlook about things that
[47:42] you may not understand the depths of the
[47:45] word, but one thing we must understand
[47:47] is the simple things of of life that we
[47:50] must put to practice. And that is worry
[47:54] does not have value in it. And and so so
[47:59] God would send a prophet to tell us,
[48:01] "Don't worry. Don't worry. It's the
[48:04] natural thing to do, but don't worry."
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Then then that means we must fight
[48:09] worry. We must fight against it and look
[48:12] to the promise of God. Now, if we didn't
[48:15] have the word of God, I just don't think
[48:18] that a prophet would labor on such thing
[48:21] as worry. But we do have the word of
[48:24] God. And so worry worrying isn't going
[48:28] to help you. He says it isn't going to
[48:31] make you feel better. It isn't going to
[48:33] change the situation.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? Now again, it's
[48:38] typical to worry. We worry about our
[48:40] children. Parents worry. If you if you
[48:43] are a godly parent and you love the Lord
[48:46] and you love your children, you worry
[48:49] about your children. You worry about who
[48:52] they're going to marry. You worry about,
[48:54] you know, what direction they're going
[48:56] to take in life. You worry about, you
[48:59] know, uh um you know, when they're when
[49:02] they're having financial struggles, you
[49:04] worry about that. Uh uh when they're
[49:07] maybe if they're sick, you worry about
[49:09] that. You know, you you worry about
[49:12] things. Even the grandchildren, you
[49:14] worry about them. You know, well, how
[49:16] they're going to grow up in this evil
[49:18] age. uh uh you know and and you uh you
[49:22] know for me I'm just thinking about
[49:24] these things uh you know as as they're
[49:27] watching them grow up you know they're
[49:30] going to have to go to school and the
[49:31] the things are changing in this so it's
[49:34] easy to worry about those things it
[49:37] worrying is something that uh uh and and
[49:41] you know it's but when when we're
[49:43] thinking of these things it isn't going
[49:46] to change the situation
[49:49] I can't change the situation by
[49:51] worrying.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; I can call my children up and say, "Hey,
[49:54] I'm worrying about you." Amen. But that
[49:57] ain't going to help them.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to help any of their
[50:00] situation. It ain't going to help my
[50:02] situation. You You understand what I'm
[50:04] saying? I can worry about you all as a
[50:06] church, but that ain't going to help.
[50:08] Y'all can worry about one another, you
[50:10] know, but that ain't going to help.
[50:11] Ain't that right? So So worrying isn't
[50:15] going to get you feeling better. It
[50:16] isn't going to change the situation. So,
[50:19] we would be better off, everybody say, I
[50:22] would be better off
[50:24] &gt;&gt; to believe God's word
[50:26] &gt;&gt; than to worry and to fret over things.
[50:30] Can you say amen? Now, we know that
[50:32] doctors, they can prescribe medicine and
[50:35] and uh they they they do a a good job in
[50:38] that, but they cannot heal. Ain't that
[50:41] right? They can they they what I call
[50:44] practicing physicians. That's that's all
[50:47] they are. They're just practicing men
[50:48] and women who practice medicine. So,
[50:51] it's best not to put all our faith in in
[50:55] medicine.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And and and I know in
[50:59] this age that's not really popular to
[51:01] say. Uh because then people think, well,
[51:03] you're against doctors. Well, we're not
[51:05] against doctors. I I I thank God for
[51:08] what they do, but I don't We're not to
[51:11] put all of our, as they say, put your
[51:14] eggs all in one basket. You're not to
[51:16] put all your faith upon doctors because
[51:19] doctors are limited in what they can do.
[51:22] A
[51:22] &gt;&gt; ain't that right. And if they're a good
[51:24] doctor, they'll tell you that. So then
[51:27] then we find uh um uh that the prophet
[51:31] tells us that doctors now they can only
[51:33] work by what they feel and what they
[51:35] see. Ain't that right? And and so uh uh
[51:39] a doctor, he has certain instruments
[51:42] that help him seize things. They got
[51:43] these CT scans. They've got um you know
[51:47] uh well they got all kinds of things
[51:48] these days. They'll they'll make you
[51:51] take a drink and you know some liquid
[51:53] and then they you know uh take you
[51:55] through something and then they can see
[51:57] all your veins and everything. They got
[52:00] X-rays. They got all that and then they
[52:02] they they start feeling around. They
[52:04] want to check things and because that's
[52:06] all they can work with is what they see
[52:09] and what they feel. Amen. See. And so,
[52:12] uh, doctors can cut things out of our
[52:15] body, uh, you know, with with their
[52:17] surgical knife and all these things, but
[52:19] they can't they can't really find they
[52:21] can't find that demon that's laying
[52:23] there.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And it uh you know I
[52:27] was uh thinking of uh listening to the
[52:29] prayer lines uh the other day and and uh
[52:34] uh you know and I'm sure you you've went
[52:36] and listened to them but you'll hear
[52:39] brother Brandham tell a person well you
[52:41] know you've got this situation and he
[52:44] said you probably didn't know that. He
[52:46] said the doctors uh it's this demon has
[52:50] been hid from the doctors. See, because
[52:52] the doctors, you know, they they can
[52:54] only work in a certain they're limited
[52:56] in how they can work. But a a demon
[53:00] Amen. And we're I'm we're thankful for a
[53:02] prophet that goes beyond the medical uh
[53:05] the medical name and he just calls it
[53:07] for what it is. It's a life. It's a
[53:09] demon. It's it's a tormentor. It's
[53:11] something that is to try to destroy you
[53:14] and to take your life. And so doctors a
[53:17] lot of times can't find that. Amen. that
[53:21] demon. And sometime we get disappointed
[53:23] in doctors. Well, why didn't they try
[53:25] this or why didn't they see that? Why
[53:27] didn't they do this? Well, it's a demon
[53:30] and it lays there. It it just it lays
[53:33] there. But see, uh uh so doctors are
[53:37] limited in what they can do. We thank
[53:39] them for their service. But the church,
[53:44] the church has a greater position than
[53:47] doctors. And you don't have to go to
[53:50] college to learn uh uh uh to be a part
[53:53] of the church. You you don't have to
[53:57] have a degree uh to do what the church
[54:00] is called to do. Ain't that right? But
[54:03] Jesus gave the church a commission. Mark
[54:07] 16:15, he said unto them, "Go ye into
[54:09] all the world, preach the gospel to
[54:12] every creature, and he that believeth
[54:15] and is baptized shall be saved." How
[54:17] easy is that, right? Amen. Just
[54:19] believing.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they shall be saved. We have
[54:23] seen the worst drunks, the worst
[54:26] alcoholics. Amen. And just preach to
[54:30] them and somehow they're able to believe
[54:33] it and be able to put away the the the
[54:37] drugs, the whiskey. Their lives have
[54:40] been changed simply. They we've been
[54:43] able to do what doctors can't do. We've
[54:46] been able to do what professionals can't
[54:49] do is because we've been given the
[54:51] greatest thing and that is to preach the
[54:54] gospel. And if that person can just
[54:58] believe the gospel, it doesn't matter
[55:02] where they're at. It doesn't matter what
[55:05] hell they've been through. It doesn't
[55:07] matter what kind of scars they carry.
[55:10] Amen. The gospel can deliver them, set
[55:15] them free, heal them, save them, answer
[55:20] the prayer just by believing the gospel.
[55:24] Can you say amen? So, he that believeth
[55:27] and is baptized shall be saved. I've
[55:29] I've told you before, you know, uh there
[55:32] was a a man uh in Kenwood, Oklahoma, uh
[55:37] Cherokee. He was a tall guy, but he was
[55:39] just a brute. and everybody around was
[55:42] scared of him. He was an alcoholic and
[55:44] he he he was terror uh in that community
[55:49] and uh uh he had a little boy I don't
[55:52] know of maybe six seven I I don't know
[55:56] where uh I he must have not been married
[55:59] he was just by himself and but he had
[56:01] his boy and they were just um you know
[56:05] dirty uh no no running water no it's
[56:09] just filthy you know and and Um he had
[56:13] old just scraggly little beard. What he
[56:15] had hardly no teeth and his nose had
[56:18] been flat and broken and uh uh just just
[56:22] a mess. But everybody was scared of him.
[56:24] Oh, Mitchell. And so Wendell uh uh we
[56:28] were young. Uh Wendell, I don't know, he
[56:31] probably was 18, so that would have left
[56:34] me at 14. Um something like that. But,
[56:38] uh, Wendell said, "Uh, Sean, you want to
[56:40] go with me to witness to Mitchell?" And
[56:43] I'm, "Yeah, I'll go." you know. So, so
[56:45] we went and and uh we arrived at this
[56:48] shack and um you know, it was just
[56:52] boarded up a little place and and trash
[56:55] all in the yard and grass all high and
[56:59] weeds and you know and so uh uh we went
[57:04] and we knocked on the door and uh uh no
[57:08] one answered at that point. So we
[57:10] knocked again and we heard this. Well,
[57:13] who is it? You know, just real Bruss.
[57:15] And he didn't open the door. So, so you
[57:18] know, Wendle's like, "Well, uh,
[57:20] Mitchell, this is u, uh, I'm I'm Wendle
[57:24] and this is my brother Sean. We're
[57:26] talking to a door. You know, this is my
[57:27] brother Sean. You know, what do you
[57:30] want?" Well, we we wanted to come and
[57:33] just talk to you about the Lord. You
[57:35] know, get out of here, you know. So, we
[57:37] did. We left and and uh went home to our
[57:41] safe haven and thankful to be alive and
[57:45] um but a few days later we felt to go
[57:48] back and so we did and same story. Get
[57:51] out of here, you know, but we didn't.
[57:54] And and uh we said, you know, we're not
[57:57] leaving until we're able to talk with
[57:59] you. We got something you want you you
[58:02] need. And finally, after a little bit,
[58:05] he says, come in. And so when we come
[58:08] in, it was just stunk, trash everywhere.
[58:12] His floor was all crooked. You know, he
[58:14] must have built it when he was drunk.
[58:17] And um uh it was a mess. But as we began
[58:20] to talk to him about the Lord, you see
[58:23] the tears begin to trickle down his
[58:25] face.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; And we led that man to the Lord that day
[58:29] and that man was forever changed. God
[58:33] just so touched him and he'd just go
[58:34] around the the community toothless, you
[58:37] know, but he just had a smile on his
[58:39] face, you know, and everybody just
[58:41] couldn't understand what happened. Well,
[58:43] it was the gospel that was preached
[58:46] &gt;&gt; and he believed it.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; He just simply believed it. Ain't that
[58:50] right?
[58:50] &gt;&gt; So Jesus gives this commission. Go to go
[58:54] into all the world, preach the gospel,
[58:56] and he that believeth shall and is
[58:58] baptized shall be saved, but he that
[58:59] believeth not shall be damned. And these
[59:02] signs shall follow them that believe.
[59:04] Everybody say, "These signs shall follow
[59:06] them that believe." Now, we're not
[59:09] wondering what the gospel is. We've got
[59:11] something to preach. Ain't that right?
[59:13] We We've got something to say. We We've
[59:16] got the word of God. And these signs
[59:18] shall follow them that believe in my
[59:20] name. They shall cast out devils. They
[59:23] shall speak with new tongues. They shall
[59:24] take up serpents. And if they drink any
[59:26] deadly thing, it shall not hurt them.
[59:28] They shall lay hands on the sick. and
[59:31] they shall recover. Ain't that right? So
[59:34] God didn't command the church to pass
[59:36] out medication and and essential oils
[59:39] and you know and and recipes for this
[59:42] and that and you'll get better and foot
[59:44] massages and you know maybe that corn
[59:47] will fall off your toe and and and all
[59:49] these things. And we're not against any
[59:51] of these things. But that's not what
[59:52] Jesus had had commissioned you and I to
[59:56] do. He didn't commission the church to
[59:58] to build hospitals and and and and all
[1:00:01] of these things. Uh uh he didn't teach
[1:00:04] us or command us commission us to go out
[1:00:07] and to learn how to operate on people
[1:00:09] and and and all of these things. That is
[1:00:12] not our specialty as the church of the
[1:00:16] living God. Amen. Our job is to preach
[1:00:20] the gospel, lay hands on the sick, cast
[1:00:23] out the devils. Our job is to see people
[1:00:27] delivered and set free. And I believe
[1:00:31] that is still in our commission today.
[1:00:34] Do you believe that? And so this woman,
[1:00:38] now this woman didn't know Jesus and had
[1:00:40] never seen him before. Amen. Uh but she
[1:00:44] had heard of him and and she had heard
[1:00:47] of the miracles that he had done and had
[1:00:50] been performing and and these things.
[1:00:53] And and the prophet said something just
[1:00:55] burned within her heart and and she
[1:00:58] believed it. She just believed it,
[1:01:01] church. Now she just heard of what he
[1:01:04] was doing. Didn't understand who he was.
[1:01:08] Didn't need to understand who he was.
[1:01:11] She just believed what was happening.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and faith come alive. And of
[1:01:18] course, you know, the Bible says that
[1:01:20] that faith cometh by hearing. I don't
[1:01:22] know these monitors are going down or
[1:01:24] something but uh faith comes by hearing
[1:01:27] and hearing by the word of God. And so
[1:01:30] she knew that if he was healing others
[1:01:34] then he could heal her too. Ain't that
[1:01:36] right?
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; She knew that. We talked about it, I
[1:01:39] believe, last Wednesday, that that uh uh
[1:01:43] that faith, amen, come alive in that
[1:01:46] woman uh uh uh that had that daughter
[1:01:49] that was uh uh uh possessed of a devil.
[1:01:52] And and but she had heard what God was
[1:01:56] doing. And and and the prophet said she
[1:01:58] knew that if if they could get it, they
[1:02:02] could get their healing, she could get
[1:02:04] what she needed. And so this same woman,
[1:02:07] see, I believe it's just the same type
[1:02:09] of faith. Anytime a person has faith,
[1:02:12] amen, they'll look at the other stories
[1:02:15] and say, "Well, if God did it for them,
[1:02:17] he'll do it for me, too." Amen. They
[1:02:20] don't look at it as, "Well, that's just
[1:02:22] God of history. That's just been too
[1:02:24] far. We're living in another day." No.
[1:02:26] If God can roll back the Red Sea, then
[1:02:29] he can roll back my Red Sea. If he can
[1:02:32] deliver and shut the mouths of the
[1:02:34] lions, he can still do it today. Can you
[1:02:36] say amen? If he can bring people out of
[1:02:39] a fiery furnace, he can still bring me
[1:02:41] out. That's what faith is. Faith is is
[1:02:45] alive and dwell. Can you say amen? So,
[1:02:49] so faith comes by hearing. See, then it
[1:02:52] becomes a personal faith. Amen. It's not
[1:02:55] just, well, I'm glad God does it for
[1:02:57] them and I'm glad what he's doing. But
[1:02:59] now it becomes a personal faith. Amen. I
[1:03:02] believe he can do it for me. I know he
[1:03:05] can do it for me. Can you say amen? So,
[1:03:08] so it was a personal faith. And the
[1:03:10] prophet said when she saw him, there
[1:03:13] came an understanding right then that he
[1:03:16] was the Messiah. She recognized that the
[1:03:20] God of heaven was now living on earth in
[1:03:24] a body of a man.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; So, she said within herself and we
[1:03:32] talked about saying the right thing.
[1:03:35] You know,
[1:03:37] I think she said the right thing.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; She said within herself, I can just
[1:03:42] touch him.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; If I can just touch the hym of his
[1:03:44] garment, I don't have to have an
[1:03:46] audience with him.
[1:03:48] I don't have to have an appointment to
[1:03:50] where he sits down and he looks at me in
[1:03:52] the eye
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; and addresses me by my name.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; If I can just touch him,
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; I know I shall be made whole.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; It don't have to be anything special.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; I don't have to have anything special
[1:04:07] from him. Amen. And to where he
[1:04:10] recognizes me, but if I can just touch
[1:04:13] him.
[1:04:14] Now, she wasn't just wondering if she
[1:04:16] could be made whole. Well, I'll just go
[1:04:18] touch him and just see what happens. No,
[1:04:21] in her heart, she knew that the
[1:04:25] situation would be taken care of. Can
[1:04:28] you say amen? She knew within her heart.
[1:04:31] See? And so, the prophet said she knew
[1:04:34] that the God of miracles was in that
[1:04:36] man. Ain't that right? Now, the prophet
[1:04:38] says that wherever God is, the
[1:04:40] supernatural takes place. And when you
[1:04:43] recognize that God is here, when you
[1:04:46] recognize that God is among us, then you
[1:04:49] automatically know that the supernatural
[1:04:51] is going to take place.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; No weapon formed against me is going to
[1:04:55] prosper.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's right. See, now
[1:04:59] Jesus was there to do the miracle.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; He was anointed to do it.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; He read the scripture there in Isaiah.
[1:05:08] But here in Luke 4:18, he quotes Isaiah.
[1:05:11] The spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:05:13] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:05:15] the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me
[1:05:18] to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
[1:05:20] deliverance to the captives, and
[1:05:22] recovering of sight to the blind, to set
[1:05:25] at liberty them that are bruised, to
[1:05:27] preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[1:05:29] Ain't that right? See, so he was there
[1:05:32] to heal the lepers. He was there to heal
[1:05:35] the blinded eyes. He was there to cause
[1:05:38] the lame to walk. He was He made himself
[1:05:42] accessible. He made himself available.
[1:05:45] And the God that was in him had the
[1:05:48] power to raise the dead. Have the power
[1:05:51] to turn water into wine. Have the power
[1:05:54] to do whatever man would believe him to
[1:05:58] do. Can you say amen?
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; He's still God. Do you believe it?
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; He's still God. For he says, "I am that
[1:06:06] I am." Not that I was, but that he's
[1:06:09] presenting God today. And the prophet
[1:06:12] said, "I want you to listen now. It
[1:06:14] ain't just a quote. It's a promise to
[1:06:16] you.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; He is always here to heal those who
[1:06:19] believe."
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Say that with me. He is always
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; always
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; here
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; to heal those who believe.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Always. Not sometimes, not part of the
[1:06:34] time, not maybe. He is always here.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; He is always here to heal anyone who
[1:06:41] would just believe.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Now he says, "But only those who believe
[1:06:47] are the only ones that's going to be
[1:06:49] healed." Regardless,
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; everybody say, "Regardless."
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; He didn't just throw that word in there
[1:06:54] just regardless just to throw it. He's
[1:06:56] telling you,
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter your situation.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Regardless of your situation, if you
[1:07:03] just believe it, he'll heal you.
[1:07:06] He didn't tell you what time it'll be.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell you, Amen, that you won't
[1:07:11] have to go through things. But this is
[1:07:13] one thing. If you'll just believe it,
[1:07:15] he'll heal you.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; He said you've got to believe it.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Now, notice it was her faith that made
[1:07:26] her whole.
[1:07:29] Now the prophet as he says about this
[1:07:32] woman as he did the other woman, she had
[1:07:35] no promise.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Now think of that.
[1:07:40] She had no promise that she would get
[1:07:42] well.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; There was no scripture for her to refer
[1:07:47] to
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; of someone touching another person and
[1:07:52] getting well.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; But her faith
[1:07:58] She just so believed it.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; That if I just touch the hymn of his
[1:08:03] garment, I will be made whole.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; God honored that faith.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; She didn't need a teaching
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; on how to touch somebody.
[1:08:18] Right.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Her faith,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; calls her to say within herself,
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; if I can just touch him,
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; I know that's a little odd. Nobody's
[1:08:28] ever done it before, but I really don't
[1:08:30] care.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; See, her faith made her whole.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't even see a vision of her
[1:08:40] like he did Lazarus coming out of the
[1:08:42] grave.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus saw Lazarus coming out of the
[1:08:45] grave. He had a vision of that, but he
[1:08:48] did not have a vision of her being made
[1:08:50] well. Her faith.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; It was just her faith.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Prophet says it was a different. You
[1:09:01] could tell it. He didn't get weak at
[1:09:03] Lazarus grave
[1:09:05] cuz God was using that gift.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; God used that gift,
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; but he got weak at this woman because
[1:09:13] she was the one using the gift.
[1:09:15] Right.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "I feel virtue. I felt strength
[1:09:19] leave me because she pulled on the
[1:09:22] gift."
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet says he never Jesus
[1:09:28] never said, "I saw a vision. You're
[1:09:30] going to be well." He said, "Thy faith
[1:09:33] have saved thee." By faith, not what the
[1:09:37] father showed me, but what you acted on.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; That's what hurt him. Other words,
[1:09:44] that's what made the strength leave him
[1:09:47] and made him feel weak.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; You don't need a vision.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; You don't need a dream.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; You just need a belief.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; So he says, now here it is. All right.
[1:10:01] You jump up. Look, that's what the
[1:10:04] woman's doing. It pulls. It strains.
[1:10:06] Somebody comes to the platform. Stand
[1:10:08] there. You're straining. It's a gift.
[1:10:10] Who's using it? Well, it ain't me. you
[1:10:12] are. You're the one that's doing it. You
[1:10:15] sit there and you say, "I believe that."
[1:10:17] And down in your heart, you really mean
[1:10:19] it. Then that's pulling the strength.
[1:10:22] And what happens? I'm pulling up. You
[1:10:26] have cancer.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; So, something's working now.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram didn't know who who was who
[1:10:35] out there,
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; but somebody had faith.
[1:10:40] Somebody said, "That's right."
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; What he said is the truth. I believe
[1:10:45] that.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; And that faith begin to pull.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; To where a lot of times he's standing
[1:10:52] here talking to this person. He said,
[1:10:53] "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I see
[1:10:55] that light going out. It's over you."
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; And he begins to tell that person, "Your
[1:11:01] faith made you whole.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Didn't need a prayer
[1:11:06] card. Didn't need to stand there. Her
[1:11:09] faith done it.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; See her faith of this woman, this the
[1:11:18] faith of this woman caused her to do
[1:11:20] whatever she needed to do to touch the
[1:11:23] hymn of his garment.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; now Bible says she pressed through the
[1:11:28] crowd.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, if you're in a crowd,
[1:11:33] um, it can get really hectic. People can
[1:11:38] press. People can push. Especially if
[1:11:41] it's a real tight crowd.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And if you're not careful, you get
[1:11:46] knocked down. You're going to get
[1:11:46] stomped on.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; People have been stampeded in crowds
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; because they fell and it was such a
[1:11:54] tight crowd and people were just
[1:11:55] pressing. They weren't worrying about
[1:11:57] what's here. But the Bible says she
[1:11:58] pressed.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; She pushed.
[1:12:02] No doubt she got on her hands and knees
[1:12:05] and begin to get go between her legs.
[1:12:07] Whatever she had to do,
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; faith says, "I'll do it."
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Because if I can touch him, I know I'll
[1:12:15] be made whole.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; She had nothing else to depend on.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we can't have faith
[1:12:22] because we've got everything else to
[1:12:23] depend on. But when the money is gone,
[1:12:26] when the doctor says no way, when
[1:12:28] everybody gives up hope, there's still a
[1:12:30] hope.
[1:12:31] if you could just believe it.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; So, she did not have any promise that it
[1:12:41] was going to work for her.
[1:12:44] But you know what? Here we sat with
[1:12:46] promise after promise after promise.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; She didn't have the word like we have it
[1:12:52] today. She was on the other side of
[1:12:55] Calvary and yet believed.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The blood of Christ had not been
[1:13:01] shed.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; No one had been loosed by his own blood
[1:13:06] as of yet.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Satan hadn't been defeated yet.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus hadn't yet went to hell and taken
[1:13:16] our sins down there and and and and
[1:13:19] grabbed the the keys of death, hell, and
[1:13:21] the grave from Satan.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Satan hadn't yet been rendered
[1:13:25] toothless.
[1:13:27] and hopeless
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; and helpless.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had not yet been stripped of
[1:13:35] his power. The chasm
[1:13:39] that had separated man from God was
[1:13:42] still there.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; The seals hadn't been open.
[1:13:50] The word, the mysteries hadn't been
[1:13:52] revealed.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:56] There wasn't a a voice that cried,
[1:13:58] "Worthy is the lamb
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; to take the book and loose the seals
[1:14:03] thereof."
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; And yet her faith got what she needed.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. She was still under the blood of
[1:14:16] bulls and goats,
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; but yet her faith
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; She believed in who he was.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Think of it now. The Holy Ghost hadn't
[1:14:26] even yet come into the man.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; So, she didn't even have God living in
[1:14:30] her.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; All she saw was God living in a man.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; He hadn't made an expression yet. Jesus
[1:14:40] hadn't yet said, "You shall receive
[1:14:42] power after the Holy Ghost come upon
[1:14:44] you."
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; She didn't hear them words.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; She didn't have that promise as of yet.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. She didn't hear Jesus say, "If you
[1:14:53] say to this mountain and doubt not,
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; you shall have whatever you say."
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; She didn't hear him say, "The works that
[1:15:04] I do shall you do also, even greater
[1:15:07] than these."
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; she yet didn't have that word. Greater
[1:15:12] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:15:15] this world.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; She didn't have these promises that we
[1:15:18] have today.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:21] Hello. Yes, sir.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; She didn't have the promise, no weapon
[1:15:24] formed against you shall prosper.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; She didn't have that promise. Amen. That
[1:15:30] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[1:15:33] life or principality or tribulation
[1:15:36] shall separate me from the love of God.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Here we are on the other side of the
[1:15:45] Calvary. Yeah,
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Satan has been defeated.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm waiting for him to
[1:15:55] be defeated." You're you're you you must
[1:15:58] be on the other side of Calvary.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Your brain is over there
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; because I've heard he's already been
[1:16:04] defeated.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he's afflicting me, so
[1:16:10] he still must have the keys of death,
[1:16:11] hell, and the grave." That's not what
[1:16:13] the Bible says.
[1:16:14] He ain't got no right over you.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; He lost his legal right over you at
[1:16:20] Calvary. Yes, sir.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; We're not on the other side. We're on
[1:16:24] this side of Calvary where the scripture
[1:16:27] is made clear to us that if you speak to
[1:16:30] this mountain, be thou removed and doubt
[1:16:33] not, you shall have whatsoever you
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; sayest.
[1:16:39] Hallelujah.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; We're on this side of Calvary. Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; We've been loosed by the blood of Jesus
[1:16:45] Christ. How many have you been loosed?
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; We've heard the loosening. What kind of
[1:16:49] a loosening is? If it's perfect blood
[1:16:52] that has loose you, then it's a perfect
[1:16:54] loosening.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; She didn't have that promise.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; She didn't have that revelation.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; But what she knew, she says, "If I just
[1:17:06] touch him,
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; I'll be made whole."
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Did it without a promise. Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; And yet we got promise after promise
[1:17:15] after promise.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; We're on this side of Calvary.
[1:17:25] We have been justified.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; How many believes you've been justified?
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Where she was, Christ hadn't even died
[1:17:32] yet?
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Been hadn't been buried. Hadn't risen.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; But we're standing on this side where he
[1:17:39] was died. He was buried and he rose
[1:17:42] again for our justification.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; My
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; I hope that means something to you. Yes,
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; She was on that side where hadn't even
[1:17:59] heard about the manifestation of sons of
[1:18:00] God.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; But yet within her faith,
[1:18:04] she said, "If I can just touch him, I'll
[1:18:07] be made whole."
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[1:18:09] Can I ask you this? The promises that
[1:18:12] we've been hearing that have that have
[1:18:15] been loosened to us, is it building any
[1:18:17] kind of faith?
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Does it have that faith to where we can
[1:18:21] look at the promises and say, you know
[1:18:22] what, I I understand why they were all
[1:18:25] that way down down them ages and all
[1:18:27] that and thank God for all them and what
[1:18:29] they've done, but this is a different
[1:18:31] age
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; and there's never been a time outside of
[1:18:34] this time for the manifestation of sons
[1:18:36] of God. And I'm part of that. I am a son
[1:18:40] of God. She never heard the promised
[1:18:42] blood. Now we are the sons of God.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; She never heard that. We hear it. We
[1:18:49] heard a prophet say, "We're not going to
[1:18:51] be sons. We are sons and daughters of
[1:18:54] God."
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; She was looking at deity in a man.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; But how much better is it now? Deity is
[1:19:03] not in heaven. It's in you.
[1:19:07] Come on now.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; It's in you.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Christ has the keys of death, hell, and
[1:19:17] the grave.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; She never even heard the fact that she
[1:19:21] was an heir of the promise.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; But we hear it.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; We've been told over and over that we're
[1:19:27] possessors of all things.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; If you need healing, you possess it. If
[1:19:33] you need salvation, you possess it. If
[1:19:36] you need deliverance, you possess it. If
[1:19:38] you need victory over something, you
[1:19:39] possess that. Whatever demon is
[1:19:42] troubling you, you possess that. Can you
[1:19:44] say amen? We have been hearing the
[1:19:46] promise that Satan is under our feet
[1:19:49] where he belongs.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; You've been raised, you've been elevated
[1:19:56] in a position of authority.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] Now,
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; there ain't no need to cry.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; There ain't no need to be moaning the
[1:20:06] mountain.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; You already know that the mountain's
[1:20:09] going to be coming.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; show one scripture where it says that
[1:20:14] the mountain ain't going. You ain't
[1:20:15] going to face your mountain. It ain't
[1:20:17] there.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; I'll show you a scripture where Jesus
[1:20:20] said, "If you'll say to that mountain,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; be thou removed and cast into sea."
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Doubt not in your heart, but believe
[1:20:26] what you have said, you shall have what
[1:20:28] you've said. Ain't that right?
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; I can show you a scripture in Zechariah,
[1:20:33] I believe it is, where where the
[1:20:35] headstone came down. They cried, "Grace,
[1:20:36] grace unto it, and there was a mountain
[1:20:39] there." And their voice said, "Who art
[1:20:41] thou, oh mountain?"
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; You standing in our way. You realize
[1:20:45] that's this age.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; That mountain standing there and says,
[1:20:48] "Who art thou, oh mountain?
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt be made a plain."
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Why? The word has come to us. Grace,
[1:20:58] grace has come to us.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and look at the mountain
[1:21:03] and worry over the mountain. It ain't
[1:21:05] going to do you any good.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Get out of worry and get in the faith.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; That's what it takes.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; We're not going to be redeemed.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; We are.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; We are redeemed.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; The chasm's gone.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:27] There's no chasm.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; She got her healing when a chasm was
[1:21:31] still there.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; But her faith caused her to say, "If I
[1:21:35] can just touch it,
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; That's all I need.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Her faith caused her
[1:21:43] to where she wouldn't just sit there and
[1:21:44] say, "Man, if I can just last until that
[1:21:47] man dies
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; and buried and raised again,
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; then I know I can get my healing."
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; No, she acted on it right then. That's
[1:21:55] right.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; She pressed her away right then.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; I don't have to have a good report from
[1:22:04] the doctor to know that I'm healed.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; I don't have to have the symptoms gone
[1:22:09] to know that God has touched me. If I
[1:22:12] can just believe in the promise,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; you'll hear it. And and maybe next
[1:22:20] Wednesday we'll get into it. But brother
[1:22:21] Bram constantly telling people, "Go your
[1:22:23] way. Start thanking the Lord. Start
[1:22:24] thanking the Lord. Start thanking the
[1:22:26] Lord. One lady, one lady says or man,
[1:22:28] one of the two, he goes, "I'm going to
[1:22:30] pray. I'm going to pray for you that
[1:22:32] you'll get over this fear and that
[1:22:34] you'll leave and start praising God for
[1:22:35] your healing."
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; I think a lot of time we need to pray
[1:22:39] for one another that we can get over the
[1:22:41] fear of things and the worry of things
[1:22:43] and start praising God for the answer.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Now is the hour. the word.
[1:22:56] So,
[1:22:59] we have to have faith just as this woman
[1:23:01] did.
[1:23:03] And it ought to be easier for us to
[1:23:05] believe.
[1:23:07] Ain't that right?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Now, that we do have
[1:23:13] the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; She didn't.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; But we do. How many's got the Holy
[1:23:19] Ghost?
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; See, you've got something that that
[1:23:21] woman didn't have.
[1:23:23] And the Bible says that his spirit
[1:23:25] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:23:27] are sons and daughters of God.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; So you you understand that I know we all
[1:23:31] have feelings and I understand we all
[1:23:33] get low and I understand sometime we
[1:23:35] don't feel like we're Christians. We're
[1:23:36] word not worthy and we're just this and
[1:23:38] we're just that. But the Holy Ghost
[1:23:40] inside of us starts bearing witness that
[1:23:43] we're still sons of God.
[1:23:44] There's just something there that just
[1:23:46] won't let us sit there and in the dumps
[1:23:48] and pout and whine and and and all the
[1:23:51] there's something in there. When the
[1:23:53] word starts being preached, there's
[1:23:54] something starts striking our soul.
[1:23:57] That's right. That's the truth.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Then we start just drying up our tears.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; We start casting down reasonings.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Because faith now strikes our heart.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; I hope this all right
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; to you.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; It's so important for us to believe.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in Mark 9:23, "If thou canst
[1:24:23] believe, if thou canst believe, all
[1:24:25] things are possible to them that
[1:24:26] believe." All things. Everybody say,
[1:24:28] "All things."
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham says, and I'll read
[1:24:31] you a few quotes, but he says, "As your
[1:24:33] faith moves, as your faith moves, so
[1:24:37] does the Holy Spirit."
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Think about that.
[1:24:41] Another place he says, "Now I'm
[1:24:44] watching." He's he's in discernment. He
[1:24:46] said, "I'm watching a scene take place.
[1:24:49] Little lady there crying right over to
[1:24:51] my right. In your eyes, that
[1:24:54] gallbladder,
[1:24:55] that's what you had, wasn't it? It just
[1:24:59] left you just now."
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Are you happy? Say amen. Mhm. I don't
[1:25:05] know you. I've never seen you. What was
[1:25:07] she doing? She's pulling on the gift.
[1:25:09] I've never seen you, but he knows you.
[1:25:13] I'd just seen it go.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Your food's been souring and everything
[1:25:18] else in your stomach and cramping and
[1:25:20] hurting. Don't worry now. Your faith did
[1:25:23] it.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, if brother Brandon was
[1:25:27] here, it would be okay." You got the
[1:25:29] same message.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; You got the same message. You got a
[1:25:33] greater understanding than that woman
[1:25:35] did in the audience.
[1:25:37] That's right.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Don't worry now. Your faith did it.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; See, you were weeping. You were sincere.
[1:25:47] You were praying, too, wasn't you? God
[1:25:49] will take it away. He did.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; He did.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; How would I know what you was praying
[1:25:55] about? Now, this is this about I just
[1:25:58] about shouted. He said, "I heard it at
[1:26:01] the throne."
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. you were praying.
[1:26:06] It's over now.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Now you think of that. The prayer of a
[1:26:11] believer,
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; a prophet heard it at the throne of God.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't hear it on earth. He didn't
[1:26:20] hear her vocally say it.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; He didn't verbally hear physically hear
[1:26:25] her praying.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; He was at the throne
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; and he heard her prayer over there.
[1:26:33] How does that happen? I have no idea.
[1:26:35] But I'm telling you, you mothers keep
[1:26:37] praying. Your prayers there at the
[1:26:40] throne. You fathers keep praying.
[1:26:43] Church, keep praying.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. Good preaching. That's
[1:26:50] right.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Her prayer was heard at the throne
[1:26:56] because of her faith.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:27:02] Hallelujah.
[1:27:03] Now, notice what brother Brandham says.
[1:27:06] It's not the size of the dog in the
[1:27:09] fight.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; It's the size of the fight that's in the
[1:27:14] dog.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's not how spiritual you
[1:27:20] feel.
[1:27:22] It's just the faith that you have.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; You don't even have to have a mountain
[1:27:28] full of faith.
[1:27:30] Just faith is the grain of a mustard
[1:27:32] seed.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; he said that's right. That's what it
[1:27:36] takes. It's somebody who's got that
[1:27:39] courage
[1:27:40] and faith in God to stand there and say,
[1:27:44] "Thus saith the Lord."
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Do we have to feel something in order to
[1:27:52] say, "Thus sayaith the Lord." No.
[1:27:56] Do we have to have a a prophecy spoken
[1:27:59] over us in order to say thus sayith the
[1:28:02] Lord? No.
[1:28:04] Do we need a dream or a vision? Do we
[1:28:07] need to feel good to say thus sayith the
[1:28:10] Lord? No.
[1:28:13] You already have thus sayith the Lord.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; For as we've read before, but Paul said
[1:28:19] the word of faith is nigh thee, even in
[1:28:21] thine heart and in thy mouth. That is
[1:28:23] the word of faith which we preach.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; That's why it's so important to hear the
[1:28:30] preaching of the gospel.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; It's so important to be at church.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; So important to hear play them tapes.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; So important to to grasp in every word.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; We're not just sitting here gaining
[1:28:44] knowledge.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; You're being equipped
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; to speak to your mountain. And one of
[1:28:50] these days we all going to face our
[1:28:52] mountains. We've already been facing our
[1:28:54] mountains. But some of these mountains
[1:28:56] are going to be big.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And you need thus sayith the Lord.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; You need to know what is yours. You need
[1:29:05] to believe what a prophet said about
[1:29:07] you.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; To speak, thus sayith the Lord. Thus
[1:29:11] sayith the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:18] So the word has come to us in this day,
[1:29:23] you are only confessing.
[1:29:26] So when you say, "Well, thus sayith the
[1:29:27] Lord," it's not just God coming down and
[1:29:29] giving you something. You've already got
[1:29:30] it.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; So now when you speak thus says the
[1:29:36] Lord, it's a confession.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; You're only saying what's already been
[1:29:40] said.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Now we know that he is the high priest.
[1:29:45] Christ is the high priest of our
[1:29:47] confession.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brown says Christ can't do
[1:29:54] nothing for you until you confess it.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Now, you understand that, right?
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; You say, "Poor me.
[1:30:03] You ain't moving him."
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; That don't get him to start working as a
[1:30:08] high priest for you.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; But the moment you start confessing what
[1:30:12] he said about you,
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; right? Well, I'm not sick.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Thank God for healing me.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; You You You got all these symptoms there
[1:30:24] to saying you're sick. You say, "Well,
[1:30:26] well, how am I supposed to do ventury?
[1:30:28] Uh uh uh you know, uh uh look like I'd
[1:30:31] be lying. Looks like I'd be not telling
[1:30:32] the truth."
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; God's word is more true than your
[1:30:36] sickness is.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; God's promise is more real than what
[1:30:42] you're feeling.
[1:30:44] The truth was more real God of what God
[1:30:46] said than what Sarah and Abraham was
[1:30:48] going through.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; God said, "You're going to have a son."
[1:30:51] That was more real to Abraham than his
[1:30:54] own condition and Sarah's condition.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; So therefore, he just started confessing
[1:31:00] what God said.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; He had thus said the Lord.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Because God had promised him.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; See, so then we're confessing. Now, as
[1:31:11] brother Brandham was preaching,
[1:31:14] he said, "Oh, brother, this is like
[1:31:16] cornbread and beans. It sticks to your
[1:31:19] ribs.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; It'll hold you some way. You can go and
[1:31:25] do a good day's work for the Lord
[1:31:28] tomorrow and go out and meet the devil
[1:31:30] and say, "I know where I'm standing.
[1:31:33] Not because a chill run down my back,
[1:31:36] but because thus sayith the Lord, "Move
[1:31:40] off, Satan. I'm taken over now."
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Move off, Satan.
[1:31:51] So the preaching of the gospel was
[1:31:54] equipping the people to go out live
[1:31:58] their daily lives and when the devil
[1:32:01] comes and tries to wreck up their home,
[1:32:03] wreck up their life, whatever he comes
[1:32:06] in, whatever form he comes in, they
[1:32:09] would have thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Just say Satan move off.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; I'm moving in now.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:20] I'm taking over. Man had a dream one
[1:32:24] night. He dreamed that the devil was a
[1:32:25] little bitty old thing.
[1:32:28] And this little devil got after this
[1:32:31] man.
[1:32:33] And
[1:32:37] that devil would say, "Boo."
[1:32:42] And the man said in the dream, he he
[1:32:45] would he would cower, move back, the
[1:32:48] devil would come up closer. Boo.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; The man would jump back.
[1:32:52] Boo. Man would jump back. Get driving.
[1:32:56] That devil just having his heyday.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Little old thing.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Boo.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; The man would cower and jump.
[1:33:05] The man says, "I I knew I knew I had to
[1:33:08] fight him. I going to have to deal with
[1:33:10] him someday." Can I say that here today?
[1:33:13] Yeah,
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; we're going to have to deal with him,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; And so he says, "I I just grabbed that
[1:33:23] Bible. I reached over and got the Bible
[1:33:26] and and and he said he just kept backing
[1:33:29] up and the devil kept coming in. Then
[1:33:31] the man made a hit at him." I think in
[1:33:35] one place said, "Boo back."
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; And we did that. He got big because
[1:33:41] every time the devil said boo, the devil
[1:33:43] got bigger and bigger and bigger and he
[1:33:46] got smaller and smaller and smaller.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; When he said boo back, the devil got
[1:33:52] smaller and he got bigger and bigger and
[1:33:54] the devil got smaller and smaller.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "See, every
[1:33:58] time, brother, every time he hollers boo
[1:34:02] and you jump back, he'll just keep
[1:34:04] getting bigger. But when you take God's
[1:34:07] word and stand there and say, "Thus
[1:34:10] sayeth the Lord, it's written."
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; He will take his flight and he will get
[1:34:16] littleer.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Just by thus sayith the Lord.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Another place he says, "No matter how
[1:34:25] much the gospel is preached, how present
[1:34:28] God was, if you draw back and don't
[1:34:30] believe it, they can never help you."
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:35] They might anoint you with oil, put
[1:34:37] hands on you, or do anything in the
[1:34:39] world. It would never help you until
[1:34:41] your faith moves from here down into
[1:34:44] here. And you just say, "Yes, God.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; I just believe it." Can you say, "Amen.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; I just believe." So, see, our job as
[1:34:55] ministers,
[1:34:58] the the one important thing that we've
[1:35:00] got as ministers is to get you to
[1:35:03] believe.
[1:35:05] That is the desire of my heart is to get
[1:35:08] every one of us just to believe.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Take God at his word.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; And then rest.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out. Don't try to
[1:35:17] worry over it. Don't don't fret over it.
[1:35:20] You say, "Well, then then it should
[1:35:22] maybe I'm not caring if I don't worry
[1:35:24] over it." No, you you're of no value.
[1:35:27] that worry is not making you any money,
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; It's no value to you. But if we really
[1:35:37] care, then let's believe the word of God
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; and confess the word. Brother Brown
[1:35:43] said, "If I can just get you to believe
[1:35:45] me with all your heart, that's what
[1:35:47] moves God and then you're healed.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Your faith has saved you." him speaking
[1:35:53] to a woman. He says in in you is a
[1:35:56] spirit of darkness or something. And
[1:35:58] whatever it is, it knows this spirit, it
[1:36:01] knows if I can get you to believe, it's
[1:36:04] got to leave you.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason it fights. So
[1:36:10] that's what makes it such a pull. It's
[1:36:13] got a kindred spirit out there. Now he's
[1:36:16] dealing with this this lady, but you
[1:36:18] hear many times that he looks down in
[1:36:21] the audiences, "Ah, you got that same
[1:36:23] thing."
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because I hear this spirit's
[1:36:26] calling out for help."
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; It's fighting because he knows if if the
[1:36:31] person can just start believing that
[1:36:34] devil's got to leave,
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; He's got to leave.
[1:36:40] So he said, "See, he knows that he's
[1:36:44] troubled for you're already healed."
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; You had a female trouble, didn't you?
[1:36:50] But you're healed.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. Your faith has saved
[1:36:56] you, sister.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; See, we're in a warfare.
[1:37:05] So, you're going to have to fight.
[1:37:06] Everybody say, "I'm going to have to
[1:37:07] fight."
[1:37:08] You're going to have to fight for
[1:37:10] whatever you need.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; If it's healing, you got to fight it.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; So, you may say, "Well, I by George, I
[1:37:18] am going to I'm going to start
[1:37:19] confessing." That's good. But what it's
[1:37:23] going to be tomorrow
[1:37:24] if the doctor tells you I don't know.
[1:37:28] There must not be much. You know, I
[1:37:31] don't know. This is a It's beyond us.
[1:37:34] What if the symptoms start getting worse
[1:37:36] and worse and worse?
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Don't look at them symptoms.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; You might just be so tired and wore out
[1:37:45] and that's all real.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; But don't look at it.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Take God at his word.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him?
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; I love him. Amen.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; So the question is is do we have the
[1:37:59] faith to press beyond the negative
[1:38:01] reports and press beyond the symptoms
[1:38:03] that we're having? In another case, as I
[1:38:05] get ready to close, brother Brown says,
[1:38:07] "If I can only get you to believe, it's
[1:38:10] going to leave you. If I can't, it can
[1:38:12] hold you. Now it lays in your faith in
[1:38:14] the finished work of Calvary."
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; So we must not cry about it. We must not
[1:38:20] worry about it. We must not fred over
[1:38:23] it. We got to believe. Brother Bram
[1:38:26] said, "This has been the greatest thing
[1:38:28] that I found among Christian people
[1:38:30] throughout the world has been a fear.
[1:38:32] They're always afraid. When a little
[1:38:36] sickness strikes, they're afraid." Many
[1:38:39] I wonder sometimes. And now I'm along
[1:38:41] with you. Now notice what a prophet
[1:38:43] saying. I'm along with you.
[1:38:47] But now what I'm trying to do tonight in
[1:38:50] this week and in this week to come is to
[1:38:52] drive that fear away by God's word.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; another place he says the greatest
[1:39:05] weapon was ever put in the hands of man
[1:39:07] is the Bible to be backed up with the
[1:39:09] Holy Ghost. that Christ died at Calvary
[1:39:13] to free his church from superstitions
[1:39:16] and fear and doubt and trembling. He
[1:39:19] lives today. How many believes that he
[1:39:21] rose from the dead? He's alive tonight.
[1:39:25] Hear ye him.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Say, "But the doctor told me I couldn't
[1:39:30] live, but hear ye him."
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; The pastor exccommunicated me and said
[1:39:36] I'd be lost forever. Hear ye him.
[1:39:41] say, "Well, Brother Brandham, I haven't
[1:39:42] got it. I don't know what I will do if
[1:39:45] well, the doctor said I couldn't live.
[1:39:47] The hospitals turned me out. But hear ye
[1:39:50] him. I'm the Lord who heals all your
[1:39:53] diseases." Can you say amen?
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; What do I hear? A little while and the
[1:39:59] world seeth me no more, but you shall
[1:40:01] see me. Because I live, you shall live
[1:40:03] also. The world won't see me, but you
[1:40:06] will. And the things that I do, the
[1:40:08] works that I do, you'll do also. I'll be
[1:40:11] with you even in you to the end of the
[1:40:13] world. Hear ye him. He's the one that
[1:40:18] can save you. He's the one that can heal
[1:40:20] you. He's the one that's responsible for
[1:40:23] this. He's the one responsible to his
[1:40:26] word. If I be lifted up, I'll draw men
[1:40:29] unto me. Oh, preach it from the pulpit.
[1:40:32] Wherever you are, lift him up and give
[1:40:34] him to the people. Hear ye him.
[1:40:39] Can you say amen? Do you have ears to
[1:40:42] hear to hear him?
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Said one of the greatest curses on the
[1:40:49] church today is fear. Everybody's scared
[1:40:51] to death
[1:40:53] of what's going to happen, who and what,
[1:40:56] and all these things. He said the
[1:40:58] greatest hindrance in the church is
[1:40:59] fear. They're afraid that it just won't
[1:41:02] work.
[1:41:07] They're afraid that the promise won't
[1:41:09] work.
[1:41:13] Well, it just won't for you that way.
[1:41:17] It will not work that way. It must be
[1:41:20] absolutely believers. Not make
[1:41:22] believers, but believers from your
[1:41:24] heart. Another place he says, "I'm
[1:41:27] trying to show you people
[1:41:30] that there's no need of being scared."
[1:41:33] The worst thing the devil can put upon
[1:41:35] you is fear. Even if you had a cancer
[1:41:39] and didn't fear and believe God would
[1:41:41] heal you, you wouldn't be in too bad of
[1:41:43] a shape.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; God take care of that if you were sick,
[1:41:47] whatever it is, if you didn't fear. So
[1:41:50] fear is one of the worst things that
[1:41:52] Satan can place upon a person.
[1:41:55] Think of that. One of the worst. It's
[1:41:57] worse than it's worse than anything. He
[1:41:59] He put a little sickness on you, but
[1:42:01] fear is worse than that.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Cuz we can sit here
[1:42:07] and be afraid. It ain't going to help
[1:42:09] us. But if you can believe,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; take God at his word. Can you say amen?
[1:42:15] So, we should do our best to get people
[1:42:17] to believe.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; We should do our best just to talk about
[1:42:20] the promises of God. When you're talking
[1:42:23] to sick folk, tell them about the
[1:42:25] promises of God. Don't cower down. Don't
[1:42:29] get into their migrs.
[1:42:31] Take them to the promise.
[1:42:34] If that woman by hearing what God had
[1:42:36] done and was doing in her day
[1:42:41] and faith could be quickened her just by
[1:42:44] hearing it and she get her healing. What
[1:42:47] about us? Just tell them about the
[1:42:48] promises of God. Can you say amen?
[1:42:52] You love him.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "No matter what it looks like
[1:42:56] here, we don't look at what we see. We
[1:42:59] look at what we do not see." Is that
[1:43:00] right?
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Any anyhow to see doesn't mean to look
[1:43:04] at. The word see means to understand.
[1:43:06] Jesus said, "Except a man be born again
[1:43:09] uh or born of water and spirit, he
[1:43:10] cannot see the kingdom of God." In other
[1:43:12] words, he can't understand the kingdom
[1:43:13] of God until he's born again. You have
[1:43:15] to accept it by faith. And then when he
[1:43:17] comes into you, you understand it. You
[1:43:20] accept the healing the same way. Stay
[1:43:22] right with it. Everybody say, "Stay
[1:43:23] right with it." Stay right with it. Not
[1:43:26] what you look at, but what you believe,
[1:43:30] what you understand to be the truth.
[1:43:37] So, what do you understand to be the
[1:43:38] truth is where you're going to set your
[1:43:41] faith at. Doctor says, "Well, there's no
[1:43:44] hope for you. Is that the truth? Is that
[1:43:46] what you understand to be the truth?
[1:43:48] You're going to look at God's word and
[1:43:49] understand this to be the truth.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said, now
[1:43:58] see, he said, we're looking at the
[1:44:00] unseen. Then stay with that. That's why
[1:44:02] all these visions I just laid my life
[1:44:04] right on on any for it never fails. I
[1:44:08] have faith in it. I believe it. If I can
[1:44:10] get you to believe the same thing, it's
[1:44:12] over. Can you say amen?
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:44:17] Amen.
[1:44:20] My God is so much bigger than troubles I
[1:44:25] face.
[1:44:30] Shen,
[1:44:34] I won't be moved.
[1:44:37] [Music]

[1:45:22] troubles I face.
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:27] Oh, why would I hunger for power,
[1:45:31] riches, or fame?
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:36] Oh, my God is so much better than all of
[1:45:41] these things.
[1:45:45] So I won't be shen.

[1:46:38] already won.
[1:46:41] Do you believe it?
[1:46:45] Oh yes. Rose up on the third day.
[1:46:52] Cuz my God is greater than death, hell,

[1:52:21] you know and as they determine what
[1:52:23] they're going to need to do uh for this.
[1:52:26] And so, um, we want to just really just
[1:52:30] keep keep,
[1:52:33] uh, our prayer before the throne of God.
[1:52:36] And, um, she has no appetite, does not
[1:52:40] want to eat. And, um, so we just need to
[1:52:44] pray that God will give her her appetite
[1:52:47] back and she can start getting strength.
[1:52:51] And um, so anyway, we're prayer
[1:52:54] warriors, aren't we? And uh we're
[1:52:56] holding to a promise. We want to keep
[1:52:59] Sister Lisa
[1:53:01] uh I just Sister Crystal in our prayer
[1:53:04] and that the Lord will just help her. Uh
[1:53:08] Sister Lisa uh Acres's daughter uh
[1:53:13] Rebecca just really needs a deliverance
[1:53:17] and um you know I just believe that God
[1:53:22] can do it. I believe that God can set
[1:53:25] that girl free from the drug addiction,
[1:53:29] from all the things that she's gone
[1:53:31] through. I've seen it and it's it's been
[1:53:35] witnessed. There's a couple, well,
[1:53:37] several, but when Jonathan was pastoring
[1:53:40] a church, that church, there was a
[1:53:43] couple
[1:53:45] that had uh gone astray,
[1:53:49] and they they got out in the wrong
[1:53:51] crowd, become druggies.
[1:53:54] They they were out there,
[1:53:58] but somehow God got a hold of them.
[1:54:02] Jonathan baptized them, that couple,
[1:54:07] they're serving the Lord. They actually
[1:54:09] moved from Ohio to get away from that
[1:54:13] crowd and they in North Carolina going
[1:54:16] to brother Josh Spennett's church. It's
[1:54:19] been a couple years now and and God is
[1:54:22] just doing a great work in their life.
[1:54:25] And so God is still testifying that even
[1:54:28] a drug addict can be set free. And I I
[1:54:31] believe that I've got my own cousin that
[1:54:35] he he was a mess and a half and and u
[1:54:41] drugs and con man gangs.
[1:54:46] Uh had a gang looking for him. Had to go
[1:54:49] in uh witness protection.
[1:54:52] Uh the guy should be dead
[1:54:56] and him and his wife ended up homeless
[1:55:00] in Florida
[1:55:02] and somehow they made a trek all the way
[1:55:06] back to Oklahoma. They gave their heart
[1:55:09] to the Lord 5 years ago, I believe
[1:55:12] six years ago or something to that
[1:55:14] effect. God so touched them people,
[1:55:16] wiped their slate clean. They were won
[1:55:20] by the law in several places. God
[1:55:23] totally wiped their slate clean.
[1:55:27] That that that girl, she didn't know
[1:55:29] nothing about God. I mean, Jesus loves
[1:55:32] you type. She didn't know nothing. And
[1:55:36] she had a record, a rap sheet. And when
[1:55:39] she gave her heart to the Lord, she told
[1:55:42] uh my brother, she says, "I need to go
[1:55:44] and make that ride." She said, "They're
[1:55:46] probably going to take me to jail and I,
[1:55:48] you know, got up there." He went with
[1:55:50] her, got up there and they couldn't find
[1:55:52] a rap sheet. Couldn't find, she said,
[1:55:54] "I'm there. I know I'm there. We can't
[1:55:56] find you in the database." She walked
[1:55:58] out of there a free woman.
[1:56:01] God so fought her battles. Amen. God
[1:56:05] bless you. Love you. Remember each one
[1:56:08] another. Brother Andrew will be
[1:56:09] ministering for us Sunday, Brother
[1:56:11] Glover. And so, uh, looking forward to
[1:56:14] that. Let's bow our heads in a word of
[1:56:16] prayer. Brother Beiel, do you want to
[1:56:18] dismiss this or
[1:56:28] [Music]
