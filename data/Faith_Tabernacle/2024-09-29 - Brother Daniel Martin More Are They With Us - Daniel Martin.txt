and I know that bless you all around oh let us pray Jesus now oh yes yes yes we are standing in his presence on Holy Ground well aren't you glad that we're standing on Holy Ground think of it the blood of Jesus Christ has made that possible amen not that we're holy at all but the holy God is among us living in US dwelling in us making himself known we're so thankful for that amen and uh so uh just glad that we were able to come to the house of the Lord today and um you know I think we take things for granted take our opportunity our Liberty to be able to come for granted and our health and the fact that we're alive and um uh you know um glad um everyone here has um made it through the storm okay and I know different ones have lost their power and uh brother Tim sister Martha I thinks still without power brother will and his family uh he was telling me this morning that they ain't supposed to get theirs on till Friday and um so we just want to keep them in our prayer and uh the Lord will just um uh get it turned on soon amen and help uh those that are working uh to get it on and uh but we're just so blessed aren't we blessed and to have uh know what we know to have the things that we have and um as brother uh Branson was saying we do want to keep u shuel shuel in our prayer they they are home home brother uh uh shmaya and sister Bethany were able to make it home yesterday so we're really glad for that uh they are uh he was telling me last night just really tired and uh so we want to keep them in our prayer the Lord will just give them a rest and uh but um uh shubael is not wanting to eat and um so that means that uh if he loses weight they'll have to take him back and in the hospital um they uh sister Bethany was telling uh Heather this morning that they were at the hospital for 111 days and so that's that's quite a while uh to be there and and uh so we we want to just keep them in our prayer the Lord will just uh help them in a in a special way and uh good to have sister Jane back with us amen Mr Wednesday night and sister Lisa missed her and and um you know I uh we also want to keep brother Matthew in our prayer and uh he's having to go to boot camp and been there for many weeks and I don't know how many more weeks you got but 10 10 more weeks this is his third time going to boot camp apparently he didn't learn much from the other two so he had to go again no uh the every occupation that he takes requires him to go to boot camp and U I think he needs to get him a good occupation that doesn't require boot camp but uh uh anyway he's he's wanting to be a law officer and and so we want to just keep him in our prayer and uh we certainly love brother Matthew very much really enjoyed the the songs brother Matthew and sister Lisa both and um uh I tell you we need one another don't we need one another and sister uh Kim weeks had um sent this prayer request um um a little later so I wasn't able to get it to uh Branson but just said uh my heart is heavy for my hometown in North Carolina so much Devastation uh brother Joe brother Joe Green uh has heard from some of his church but not all there are whole towns destroyed around the area no power very little selfservice gas is ration to $20 at a time so um asking for prayer and um I I tell you uh prayer God knows how to answer prayer don't he you know I told the story before but Dad you know we dad was a principal at our Christian School didn't get paid but very very little and so we were poor growing up and um but I remember he had that 3/4 ton truck and but he needed to go to Tulsa which was about 40 minutes away from where we lived and uh he had to go for a meeting school meeting and it was a requirement and and uh he didn't have the gas really to get there just a little bit and uh but he didn't want to borrow money so he he went ahead and went and he said he had um ran out of gases as he pulled in the truck died and he coasted in and he tried to start it and it wouldn't start and smelling the fumes you know and so he went on into the meeting and uh all through that you know meeting saying man I'm going to have to hit Chik home and don't want to do that but uh afterward he um he thought well I'm just going to go in that and see if I can get it start and so he prayed and he said Lord you know you know my needs you know why I'm here and he said I I know you're a provider said just asking that you'd help me get home let this truck start and he said you know he Crank that thing and he said it started he turned on the lights and he said right before him he said that that went Gage went from me all the way to fool God had given him a a tank of gas and you know that's just the god that we serve and um you know it's in these times you know when maybe we're struggling financially or or the limits like this of gas it's only 20 bucks uh uh at a time amen but God can go past that and he can just fill their tanks up he can just do whatever he wants to do he's God and we're in his hands we're believers do you believe that so may before we ask Daniel to come out maybe we could just bow our heads and pray for this need father Lord I know there's a lot of Devastation around the country in this area and St surrounding states father your Believers father lord they're needing your help so many people are but father I pray that you'd have mercy Lord uh if there's anyone that is missing any believers Lord I I pray you'll bring them home may they be found Lord father if there's those that Lord are needing finances God I pray that you would you would just meet every need Lord in in this time father May uh uh uh our brothers and sisters get their lights turned back on father I know it's a it's a worry some thing on on our brothers having to go work and yet worrying about their families and what to do for them and I pray Lord that you would just uh uh turn it on for them Father sooner than what the the they're expecting it to be father we're just in your hands and you said to ask abundantly Lord that our joy may be full and your Prophet told us don't ask for little things ask for big things and Lord we just going to ask it today Father oh we just love you we thank you Lord looking forward to what you've got for us this morning in Jesus Christ's name amen as we invite Daniel to come and want him just to take his time and uh Liberty let's

um if you could turn to your Bibles to second king amen we uh had such a wonderful time there in Nicaragua um the Lord moved in a special way down there and um I'm not going to give a report today but maybe if the Lord would allow maybe later or something but um thank you for all your prayers and support amen we we sure felt the prayers amen but if we could turn to Second Kings chapter 6 and before we read can we just bow our heads for a moment this morning dear heavenly father Lord we just love you and we thank you Lord for all that you've done for us father and Lord we ask and Lord that you would just come once again this morning Father and just move in a special way father Lord I ask that you would just bless the reading of the word father bless the the preaching of the word father Lord I pray that you would have uh uh your people would just receive for what you would have for them this morning Lord Lord I pray that you would just walk down the aisles Lord and meet every need is our prayer help me to get myself out of the way father Lord and just come in a special way in jesus' name we pray amen 2 Kings chapter 6 verse 8 uh we're going to read a few scriptures here says then the king of Syria warned against Israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp and the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are come down and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel and and one of his servants said none my Lord O King but Elisha the prophet that that uh the prophet that is in Israel tth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber and he said go and spy where he is that I may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in Dothan therefore s he thither the horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold Ando a host compassed the city both with horses and with chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they be with us more than they that be with them and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and when he saw and behold the mountains were full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha amen you can have your seats this morning am man that's uh probably one of my favorite scriptures in the Bible um but here we look at he says fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with him and if I could give a Time this morning it's going to be very simple this morning but I'm hoping that it would just encourage you this morning and that would be more are they with us and um you we liveing in a a world of of great fear um this world is just um in so much fear not knowing what to do and and so many things are happening in the world today that's caused a great fear among the people in the world and uh you know we have all all the floods that are happening in and um uh that that just happened this week all the Hurricanes or tornadoes and and it's caused a great fear upon the people but to the bride of Christ it should cause us to lift our heads for uh our Redemption is drawing nigh and the word uh and the and the world is living in darkness this world is just covered with fear a and they're scared about tomorrow they're scared about about the the upcoming election worried about who's going to get in and and and and they're worried about their job don't know if they're going to uh uh how their jobs are going to work out and anymore people are scared to walk down the the the streets anymore people are scared to go to the grocery stores and and and that's what Satan is trying is put on the world today and if we could bring it into the church into our home Satan is trying to bring a fear into our church he's trying to bring fear into our homes and he's trying to get our minds off the the promises of God and to get us focused on our problems amen he's trying to get us focused on the circumstances amen where we get worried about the sickness in our bodies we're we're scared that our kids will never come back to God we're we're scared our church is going to fall apart or we're scared to believe for a Rapture because we don't know if it's for us a and scared to believe God cuz we uh cuz we're just what if it won't happen you know and that's what Satan is doing today he's causing a fear to get you to doubt God's word Amen brother brandom says the worst thing the devil can put on you is fear amen fear doesn't come from God H second Timothy 1 says for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound mind so the spirit of fear does not come from God Amen and how do we get rid of fear 1 John 4 says there is no fear in love for perfect fear casteth out love amen perfect our perfect love cast cast us out fear brother brandham says love and faith are the same thing love produces faith and there are only two uh uh uh uh uh things that govern a human and one of them is Faith which brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all amen Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God Amen we we know that saying you are what you eat and you know you can eat all the fatty stuff and and next thing you know you you you get Chunky and you can eat all the salads and the next thing you know you become skinny you are what you eat and we can feed off the things of the world we can uh our Pastor said it uh Wednesday night he made a comment we are like a sponge you know we can we we can either soak up the things of the world or we can soak up the things of God and we can get fat off the world or we can get fat off the promises of God Amen and we can soak ourselves in the politics we can soak up the entertainment we can uh soak up uh all these other things and if we're not careful we'll open the the doors to fear and if we can just forget about the politics if we can just forget about uh numbing our minds to the entertainment and soak up the things of God then we can have a faith in the word that will bring the power of God in our midst this morning amen Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God Amen you don't get Faith by soaking up your your favorite audio book amen you don't get Faith by watching your favorite TV show you don't uh soak up Faith by uh listening to a man's ideas and and listening to his own Revelations but uh but you get Faith by the word of God for this hour amen but in the word of God for this day and age amen each messenger had a word for their day and an hour amen Noah had a message for his day and that was it's going to rain amen for I believe 120 years Moses got up every single more or Noah got up every single morning and said it's going to rain and and the people had to obey the voice for that day or they perished amen for by faith Noah built an ark amen his faith rested upon God's Eternal Word Amen brother Bram says no matter how much the people said it can't be done no matter how much science combed the globe and said there will never be clouds up there there's no rain to come down if God's word said it's going to rain it's up to God to make a way for the rain if if God said so then that settles it amen and that's the way our faith should be if God said so then that settles it it doesn't matter what the world says if God said it then God has to make a way for it amen Wesley had a message for his day amen Luther had a message for his day and if we feed off a me Luther's message that ain't going to work if we feed off of Wesley's message it's not going to work and on down to the final age each message had had its own uh for its own age and a and there's a message for a bride in this hour amen if we can feed off the message of this day this message has come to get us ready for a Rapture this message has come to to let us claim our promises amen it may look strange to the world it may it may seem odd and and they can come up with every reason why we shouldn't believe this message a why we shouldn't make this message our absolute but this message is not to the unbeliever this message is to the elected of God oh my God is elected of people and has put Faith uh put their faith in the word of God and and she has made herself ready amen come what may let the Trials come let the disappointments come let the sickness come all hell has been loose to get you to doubt but put your faith in the word of God Amen it's come to put your faith to the test this world is growing darker fear is everywhere but as long as you're feeding off the word of God for this hour not not past age not not not a not a past uh Revival but if you're feeding off for the Revival for this bride amen then you have nothing to fear amen some people has put their faith in in the pope oh my some people has put their faith in the president they put their faith in what the bishop says they put their faith in what Grandpa used to say but the pope but but the Pope's word is going to fail The Bishop's word will fail Grandpa's words will fail fail but but the word of God can't fail amen I would rather be standing on God's word than than than on someone else's idea I would rather be standing on God's word than Grandpa's idea I would rather be standing on the word than in heaven for heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words will remain my words will never fail oh my the word of God is a sure Foundation amen that's the promise that God has gave to us amen when you build your faith on the right foundation then nothing can bring it down depression will come sickness will come death will even come and doubt will come but when the word but the word of God is more sharper and more powerful than any two- wedged sword amen just take God at his word and possess every promise of God this morning amen he's made a way for us he's made a way for us to claim our promises amen God told the uh God told Israel just to take up that that the land belonged to you God told them all you got to do is just possess it I've done made a way for you all you got to do is just go possess it amen they the the they already had houses built they already planted the crops now all you got to do is just go go possess the land amen can you imagine if they just stood there and said man well that that that lancher looks nice man I wish we could have that well I I I just don't know are you sure the promises are for us today I don't know I mean he says we can have it but but I just don't know and they didn't let fear stand between them they took God out his word and they possessed the promise amen amen are you sure that message uh of what the prophet declared is for us today amen they knew who they was they knew that God had called them and they went and possessed the promise that God gave them amen when God gives a promise it doesn't mean that you ain't going to have to fight for it amen God says it's yours Satan is going to do everything he can to keep you from the promises of God he's going to do everything he can to keep you from claiming those promises he's going to cause fear he's going to cause depression he's going to do everything he can to keep you from it but all you got to do is just say lord it's mine the promises are mine I believe a lord I I declared Victory oh my possess your land this morning Amen brother Brenham says When Faith takes a hold of it fear drops away oh my Faith's got big muscles in a hairy chest when it speaks everything else keeps quiet cancer has to shut up and get out of the way tumor TB the rest of them moves on When Faith raises up and says sit down and that settles it amen fear has no place in a child of God this morning fear has no place in your home oh my let faith in God speak over your home oh let Faith take hold of your life this morning brother brandham says faith puts Satan to shame oh my faith puts Satan to shame and it doesn't matter what comes your way fear not and claim every promise of God stand still and see the salvation of the Lord oh my don't fear don't get riled up oh just claim the promises of God amen amen do you believe it this morning amen I don't want to get ahead of myself but if we go back to our opening scripture we find out that there is a war between Syria and Israel and every time the enemy would try to lay a trap every time the enemy would try and sneak up on the armies of God on the armies of Israel God would reveal it to his prophet Propet Elijah oh my the word of the Lord comes to a prophet always amen I want you to catch this now the enemy was always exposed uh he was always exposed anytime he tried to get to God's people and the Bible says that the king of Syria was very troubled about this and sought after Elijah and Dothan so so in the cover of Darkness we see that he sent a great host a great host not just a few little men and and just a just a couple people but he sent a great host and he surrounded the city there was no way out he surrounded the city and it's the same thing today Satan has released all the host of Hell to get you to doubt to cause you to fear amen and this great Army it sent its horses and its chariots and it surrounded the city and the Bible says that Elijah's servant went out the next day and he seen all the armies of Syria and he C cried out to Elijah he said Master fear took over over his servant and he said Elijah uh Master what shall we do what shall we do now Elijah didn't fear he didn't say oh well I should have just kept my mouth shut oh God why why me Lord I shouldn't have told H them about that I shouldn't told the the Israel what what the Syrian Army was doing but he looked at his servant and he said fear not oh my that's a powerful statement this morning fear not oh Amen to the carnal eye it looked impossible to that servant it looked impossible and when he said fear not maybe his servant probably looked at Elijah and he said well Elijah I I I just don't know maybe you slept a little too long this morning I I don't know I mean do I only see the two of us and and I just don't know you know do you not see that Grace that that Army surrounded the city there's there's no way out for us Elijah but all Elijah said was fear not for more are they with us or are more are they with us than they that be with him oh what a revelation oh my and his servant says well you know I only see the two of us and Elijah said Lord I pray thee Open the Eyes of the young man that he may see and then God opened his spiritual eyes and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about them and a great host of angels surrounded Elijah and his servant amen they looked impossible amen but he said fear not amen there was Angels Angels compassed about them and if we can apply that to our day if we can apply that Satan has Unleashed every de every demon of Torment every demon of fear has

not only taught us the message but he taught us how to worship after the service after when the preaching is going on and there's a liberty there you never want to get in a hurry but you want to enter in and worship because brother brand said you know that the spirit the angel of the Lord you know follows after the message and he begins to speak to the hearts and and that showed even in the beginning when the word of the Lord was spoken then the spirit of the Lord moved after that and he began to bring that word to materialization and it's always been that way and I believe the Lord has spoke to us this morning and to let us know you don't have to fear you might say well I I I've already heard these things and and that may be true but Satan is constantly working on us constantly fighting and and I think that God gives us raises up ministry we you know we heard it Wednesday night we hear it today of just the promises of where we're at now you know we're in the greatest age ever and if there's ever a time that God has truly made himself known in his church it's now in our flesh in his old bodies and yet Satan is Waring us he's fighting us he's trying to convince us that that we ain't part of it and he's trying to convince us that there's no way and trying to get us to look at the natural trying to get us to look at our faults trying to get us to look at everything around us when all in reality Christ in us the hope of glory we have that power to speak the word of God it was demonstrated in this age a man that would stand there and not fear the storm remember he that fear was starting to grip him and he needed to hurry up and get down that mountain but then the Lord told him stand still go back up the mountain amen and when he went up there amen something caused him to speak to that storm and that storm that would have killed him amen it left it dissipated because the voice the Creator was speaking through that voice and church the Creator is in you he can use them mortal lips and I believe the Creator spoke to us today amen do you love him we appreciate the men of God that would labor to minister the message of the hour we just want to just ask the Lord just to give Daniel strength and his body and um amen and Lord will just help him amen and uh bless his ministry Min and um I just appreciate all you ministers here uh giving your time to the message of the hour God bless you and we need it don't we we need it amen and um good to have brother Christian here with us amen and uh still recovering from his shoulder amen but uh coming to the house of the Lord we appreciate that amen we've got uh service this evening at 4:30 for those that would want to question and answers and um just believe the Lord to be with us amen and uh look forward to uh tonight amen and so if you're able to make it we'd love to have you amen but take the words that you've heard this morning and um not only just hear them but apply them to your heart amen when fear starts taking over and say no that's not me anymore I'm not going to accept that and I'm not going to breathe that type of spirit and uh let that linger in my heart amen God bless you as our prayer let's just bow our heads
