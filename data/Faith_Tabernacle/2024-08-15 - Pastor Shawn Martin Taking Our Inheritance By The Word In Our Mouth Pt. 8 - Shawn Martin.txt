be praised and adored and we certainly want to do our part to give him glory amen amen amen and uh certainly good to be in the house of the Lord and Trust everyone's had a good week so far amen and good to have um everyone back from Ohio and uh good to have brother Micaiah with us again and brother Christian starting school back up so uh that um the musicians can be dismissed but I heard uh just of the good reports and uh what God done in the services and there in Ohio and so we're just thankful for that and um Miracles uh took place and one young man he had uh been wrestling I guess and broke his ankle or something there and but uh they had to take him to the hospital and they put a cast on him and everything and went through the prayer line Saturday night and God just touched him he cut the the um the cast off and was walking and uh so we just thank the Lord for that amen and um another one got out of the wheelchair and he' been confined in the wheelchair and the Lord just touched him and he pushed the wheelchair out of the building and and so we know the Lord is just working amen among his people we we certainly believe in miracles don't we amen and uh so anyways if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Romans the uh first of all the fourth chapter and um uh brother Andrew uh will be flying out to Calgary uh Canada tomorrow sometime and so we want to keep him in our prayer Lord will give him a safe travel and um bless his meeting there amen and um I think sister Martha sent out an announcement um after the service Sunday and uh around 4:30 uh this coming Sunday was those who would want to meet at sister paty's house and um have some songs and fellowship and uh we we've certainly been missing sister py and uh she's been missing the The church here and so it'd be just a wonderful uh U uh time and give us an opportunity to to see her and to just encourage her amen and I tell you what it uh just being around Believers that's uh it's just really uplifting isn't it amen and so uh we we all fight as it is you know in our minds and um and especially when you're sick or you're not feeling good and just seem like Satan takes that opportunity and uh so we just uh uh always need that encouragement praise the Lord uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father it is so good to be in your house this evening and we thank you for the day that you've blessed us with and watching over us father we don't take these things for granted Lord thank you for bringing the Saints Back Home Father um from the weekend and thank you for what you've done for the people Lord and just visiting them and we just pray father that you would visit us tonight Lord and just anoint uh both the the hearer the speaker father help me to get myself out of the way and father if there's any spirit that would be here to try to hinder your people I I pray that you would just drive it away father those that may be sick Lord or out of town father I pray that you would just be with with them and Daniel and Britney out of town I pray that you would bring them home safe and Lord uh just the others father and I I just pray father that you'd be with brother Andrew as he would be flying out to minister your the gospel father anoint him and strengthen him in his Spirit his mind father we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord uh the book of uh Romans the 4th chapter and um we're going to start at the um the first verse and um praise the Lord um so it says um what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for If Abraham were justified by works Heath whereof to Glory but not before God for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God everybody say Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also see for we say um um that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision he had received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father father of circumcision to whom uh to them who are not of the circumcision only uh but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to a seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be HS faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for there for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be Grace uh or be might be by grace to the end of the promise might be uh sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore for it was imputed to him for righteousness then if you'll turn with me again to Romans the 8th chapter and going to start at the 16th verse Romans 8 and um I think that's the um yeah so it says um it's actually the well we we'll read it um let's go to the um 14th verse for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB the Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God or Sons for and if children are Sons then heirs Heirs of God and join heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen you can have your seats this evening praise the Lord do you love him amen now you know we've been talking about an inheritance taking our inheritance by the word in our mouth and we we have been left an inheritance and and as we know God left us in inheritance uh before the foundation of the world when he wrote our name in the Lamb's Book of Life and uh if you are if you have an inheritance then you are an heir and Paul would tell us that we are heir of all things ain't that right we possess all things and brother Bram said we possess all things things the things that are seen and unseen amen and so we've got a vast uh inheritance that is been left us and so now this is the time uh in this age to possess our our inheritance to take it and uh to possess every promise that God has made us amen uh we we know that we have come through the stages of justification s sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we we are now as the Isaiah uh talked about the ends of the Earth we are at the ends of the Earth amen the End of Time the end of Politics the end of civilization as we know it the end of corruption the end of of e everything the end of mortal life amen we're we're at the end of all things and so this is the season where the sons of God are to be manifested um and and we talked about Caleb and and how that he had went through the Journey and and he had come up to that that promised land and then he crossed over under uh the ministry of of Joshua and and uh when he crossed in over into the land of promise amen he possessed uh his inheritance and that's that's what he wanted he would not settled down for nothing else he knew God had given him an inheritance he and and that's that's exactly what he wanted and that's what he he did he defeated every giant that that uh um uh that came his way or that stood uh between him and his inheritance because he had a legal right to do that you believe that amen he had no fear whatsoever he just knew that God promised me this land and he prom promised me this inheritance it's mine and and and I'm I'm going to take it and he did and and so is it for you and I that we have a right to defeat every enemy that stands between us and our inheritance amen and we are we we we now have the the the the the uh god-given right the god-given ability this is the time to overcome this is the time every enemy is is to be defeated in this age now our enemy is not flesh and blood amen for uh Paul would tell us in in Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against the spiritual wickedness in high places so therefore it's not Humanity that is trying to keep us from our inheritance yes the Works through Humanity just as much as God uh Works through Humanity but in all reality it's it's Satan and his demons uh which makes it a spiritual warfare this this Warfare that we're fighting it's a spiritual warfare against uh the demons and of of of hell ain't that right and so this is why I I've used that title taken our inheritance by the word uh of our mouth see we we're not taking our inheritance by guns and knives and and atomic bombs and nuclear powers and and all of that that's not the way we're taking our inheritance we're not taking our inheritance by beheading people and and putting people into prison and right and and and all of that uh that's that's not the way we're taking our inheritance but as we've been taught the word of God everybody say the word of God will defeat eat Satan anytime anywhere under any condition the word of God and we know that Jesus defeated Satan he had power upon power but he used not a one he used the word to defeat Satan and every time Satan came at him he would use the word amen and he defeated Satan on every turn amen and and and that was to show that even the weakest Christian can defeat Satan anytime anywhere under any condition anyone I don't know if you feel like you're the weakest Christian but but you have no excuse to defeating the devil every one of us can defeat the Devil from the smallest to the oldest amen by the word of God now and and and the scripture that that I was really looking for amen and we we had read in the the uh uh previous uh uh uh Services is where Paul would tell us the word is NY everybody say the word is NY even in thy mouth the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth now now what uh uh what's uh in our mouth is the word as Paul would say that's already been declared the word that's already been preached amen uh that that is the word that is in our mouth now this word is is no longer a mystery to us it it has been revealed in in this day so now how did the word get in our mouth amen well first of all we received it into our heart ain't that right amen every Christian receives the word not intellectually but receives it into their heart amen by faith and and and then Jesus said in Matthew 12 and and 34 out of the abundance of the heart the speaketh so therefore the word has to come into the heart first and then your mouth is filled amen with the word of God it begins to speak amen the word of God again in John 15:7 Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will amen now think of it that's how you're going to defeat your enemy you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you see the power of the word amen see now so we are to do as as David done um uh talked about there in Psalms 11911 where he said Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee ain't that right so it was important David guarded that word he revered that word he he resp respected the word he he hallowed the word amen it was it the word was was greater to him than his own word as a king amen uh uh uh or a government or whatever uh uh it was a word amen and he said I've hid it in my heart that I might not sin against thee and the prophet said we must hide God's word in our heart and then everybody say then God will keep his Pro promise God will keep his promise see so every Service uh uh uh what we're doing we're are a people that is hiding the word we're depositing the word in our hearts we're not letting the devil take that word from us you you remember that that Jesus talked about the four grounds and and one of them grounds Satan was able to take that word out amen but but we are a people that Satan can't take that word out amen we're hiding it in our heart heart we're protecting it we're guarding it amen from the adversary from negativity from from negative thoughts from failers from ups and downs and and and and and all of these things we're we're hiding that word in US amen yes we get discouraged but we still hide the word in our heart yes we may not know what to do sometime but we're hiding the word in our heart that word is more valuable than anything else do you believe that now you think of it now God does not have to heal to prove his power amen he doesn't have to save he doesn't have to deliver to prove his power he doesn't have to prove anything to anyone do you believe that but notice the prophet said but he has to heal he has to save he has to deliver Amen in order to keep his word amen God is obligated to his word I'll say it this way he's not even obligated to you amen now you think of that because you're up and down all the time you're full of failures you're full of ups and downs you're full of discouragement you're full of uh uh well brother Ram said we backslide every day and and and and sometimes uh uh we we just got a lot of wrestling uh uh well you know where the Battlegrounds uh you know that uh uh that that the war rages within us do you believe that amen but God's not obligated to us now you think of that if we were in discouragement you know he might be obligated to to bring a Justice to us amen when we have fallen and maybe when we have backslid and maybe when we ain't just really up to par and and and and at our best for him and and all of these things but but he's not obligated to us he's obligated to his word ain't that right now there's a word concerning you that he's obligated to ain't that right so he's not obligated to us us but he's obligated to his word concerning us amen see and so the prophet said when God speaks he is obligated to keep it for that's his word he's obligated God's not under o any obligation to any man but he's obligated to his own word that's the kind of God that he is that when he speaks it it's going to happen he'll move Heaven and Earth Amen to make sure that his word comes to pass now that's what makes his word the absolute amen now I've looked up that word absolute it's perfect in itself Amen in Unlimited in power primarily an ultimate see uh uh uh brother BR would say an absolute it's used many times it's the last word it's the amen it's the last thing it's the final word it means that you've reached the end you can't go any higher than the absolute ain't that right amen it's the Supreme it's the ultimate there there there's nothing else in its way see amen so the word of God is our absolute amen not only your absolute it's the devil's absolute too amen the devil has to give way to the word of God Amen the word of God Amen is the absolute to to to Kings and to Nations and to monarchs and amen to evil Powers amen whatever it would amen it's the absolute the word of God is the final say so in your life ain't that right amen see well uh uh Jesus said in Matthew 24 and 35 he said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away now you think of that now there is no other word amen that that will break the powers of the devil your own word will ain't ain't good enough to break the powers of the enemy amen our my own word and and and and and and the King's own word President Putin or uh Obama or or or or whatever amen there is no word that is able Amen to break the the the the PO of Satan and to defeat him amen there for amen it gives us confidence that we can trust in the word of God Amen if exactly brother brand said we can trust exactly in what God says we don't have to alternate it we don't have to change it around you don't even have to understand it all amen just know that God's going to bring his word to pass amen because that's the ultimate amen see so therefore we keep his word in our heart so that we don't sin or that we don't disbelieve Amen brother Brown said that sin is unbelief ain't that right amen see now in our opening scripture we read where Abraham he called those things that are not as though they were amen you think of that he called them as though they already existed they were not but yet he called it as though it already was amen well what what was he doing he done exactly what God did amen for God done the same thing remember in Isaiah 46 and9 amen God says remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning amen before anything was before anything was in existence God called those things as though it already was he declared the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done amen well it's in the beginning or before the beginning of time he had a lamb slain from the foundation of the world Amen he also wrote our names in the Lamb's Book of Life when he wrote or when he predestinated the lamb he also right then wrote our names in the Lamb's Book of Life yet we were not here to contest it we were not here amen uh uh uh to to to to you know to to look at things we had no failures at that time we had no righteousness at that time there was nothing good bad or anything that we could offer God and yet he already established us before the foundation of the world he declared you he called your salvation before you even had salvation he called you well the Bible says that he predestinated us he called us he justified us and he glorified us when before the foundation of the world so he called those things things that are not as though they already existed amen God ain't worrying about you he's already called it amen he's already declared your end he's already declared your Victory he's already declared your Triumph he's already declared your your you're overcoming can you say Amen what may seem to be a trial that you can't get out of notice what God has called notice what God has declared that's right see he declared it before there was even a beginning of time and all throughout scripture he testified of it every T in Shadow he testified of your Redemption he testified of your Victory he testified of your glorification he testif he never testified of you as a defeated he never testified there is no types amen uh uh in in the Bible that fat that uh matches this bride fits this bride to where it shows that she is defeated you are triumphant you are victorious you are an overcomer amen What God Says what God has declared he declared you coming from a vagabond Amen to a prince he declared you amen from living from the alleys and the in the dumps and being a nobody to reigning on the throne with him God declared it God called it as though it already was right amen can you say amen he testified of it in the scriptures calling those things that are not as though they were amen amen now notice the word that was in Abraham's mouth he called it calling those things that are not as though they were well what was in his mouth God's word for God said it first ain't that right God said it first amen so therefore Abraham calling those things that were not as though they already were was just a confession the word that was in his mouth was a confession he did not dream this up he did not conjure this up it wasn't just his own thought and and a hairbrained idea come to him and he started talking about it no God came to him first God declared the the promise to him first amen and therefore Abraham began to confess the promise of God now it was a confession now this word confession amen is to acknowledge to own up to concede to admit usually now I'm looking up this in Webster it's usually confession is usually used in guilt repentance admission of guilt that I was wrong uh or a a confession could come from a whistleblower as as we hear a lot in politics a lot of whistleblowers well they're confessing or what we would call tattling on the other guy but it's a confession ain't that right see and so but but then notice what Webster also says that the word confession is to admit the truth of a statement or a charge to accept as true to acknowledge and to profess can you say amen amen so this is a confession aen is to admit the truth of a statement so this is what Abraham by the word in his mouth he was confessing he was literally admitting that God's word was true amen it didn't matter what he felt it didn't matter what Sarah felt and what she looked like and the condition that they were in his confession admitted that God's word is true can you say amen and he acknowledged it he accepted it as true so confession is to speak to speak to say it's an utterance of words of course brother brandom said confession is to say the same thing as amen see you've come into an agreement with what has been said and therefore you speak it you're not ashamed to speak it you're not ashamed to declare it you're not embarrassed to say it amen well he's the one that said it amen well this was what Abraham God said was was going to have a child God said so and he just confessed it to be so so Abraham was speaking uttering words but they ain't weren't words of his own ambition of his own desire of his own own dreams he just simp confess what God had already declared that's right amen now this reminds me of what God Said to the prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 51:16 God said and I have put my words in thy mouth and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand notice that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth and say unto Zion Thou Art my people see well how was he going to plant the earth and the heavens and lay the foundations of the Earth by putting his word in the prophet's mouth amen the word had to be spoken through human lips amen and that word had a power can you say amen that's right see in Jeremiah 1:9 God said to the prophet behold I have put my words in thy mouth see I have this day set thee over the Nations and over the kingdom to root out to pull down to destroy and to throw down to build and to plant think of that now Jeremiah wasn't a king he wasn't he wasn't some dignitary he wasn't some ambassador of of of of some Nation no he was just a simple man amen a prophet that God had put his words in the mouth of Jeremiah and by that word amen uh uh Jer Jemiah amen would would be over the Nations and Jeremiah would be over the kingdoms and by that word he would root out pull down destroy amen throw down and build and and plant can you say amen amen by putting his words God putting his word in the mouth of his Prophet see amen you see the word of God cannot be spoken without there being an authority amen behind the word to bring it to pass your words can fall to the ground amen you can say something and not meaning amen and it be nothing amen the Bible even talks about uh uh uh speaking vain repetition and and and let letting just an idle tongue and and and just our words being vain our words just being whatever amen see God's word would have an authority amen when you speak the word of God God you're doing something with that word amen when you declare the word of God Amen Satan has to give notice when you go down in prayer amen and take God at his word amen and base your prayer upon thus say the Lord Satan amen has to give way Satan has to lose ground amen because the word is now in your mouth amen sir that's right you see God put his word in Abraham's mouth amen he came to Abraham and he called him out see it was the grace of God In Action Abraham didn't deserve anything amen and wasn't asking for anything he wasn't even looking for this God Amen he was wrapped up in idol worship he had plenty of gods to serve and to to worship and and all of these things because that's all he knew but it was God by Grace introduced himself to Abraham amen and chose him elected him and called him do you believe that amen and not only did he call him and elect him but he gave Abraham a promise which made him an heir of Promise amen it made Abraham an heir of Promise because God gave him a promise amen now he had an inheritance now notice amen what God Said to Abram Genesis 12:1 now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee seventh verse and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto thy seed everybody say unto thy seed now he's now notice that will I give this land under thy seed will I give this land in Genesis 15 187 God said unto Abraham I am the Lord that brought thee out of her of the CH CES to give this land to inherit it ain't that right amen So Not only was this inheritance amen for Abraham but God declared it would be also to Abraham's seed a ain't that right amen but but now notice the inheritance was a natural land and it was given for an inheritance to the Natural Seed of Abraham amen that's why they're still fighting over there people trying to take that N Land from Israel but they'll not be able to do it because God gave them that inheritance now if God will protect a natural people amen with a natural land as a natural inheritance how much will he protect you can you say amen amen see and so we we find amen that that this land was was not their land amen they Abraham was in another land he wasn't looking for that land he wasn't he he he he he wasn't you know uh what what is that word uh uh uh envying them and and and and and these things of that land he was happy where he was it was God that came to him God's the one that said Abram I am God revealed himself and says now get thee out of this land I've got another land for you that I'm going to give you okay that right see it wasn't the land but God had given it to them for an inheritance by promise ain't that right now this shows amen us that whoever lived on that land didn't known it whoever was living on that land at the time didn't own it amen and whoever was living on that land when Israel was an Egypt did not own it amen whoever was living on that land when when Israel crossed over into the promised land they didn't own it they could have said well I've raised my babies here and I've I've raised for Generations I've raised on this land but it wasn't THS to inherit it God gave it to Israel God gave it to Abraham and his seed can you say Amen why because God owned it God owned the land it was his Sovereign right Amen to give it to whoever he wanted to and I say to you Satan doesn't own any land amen that God has given you God owns it can you say Amen Satan is just a squatter on God's Property he has no right to Salvation he has no right to Healing he has no right Amen to eternal life he has no right to Heaven he has no right to Deliverance he has no right to your children he has no rights to peace and joy and love and longsuffering Satan has no rights H God gave it to you for your inheritance it's your land it's your possession by promise that's right by promise can you say Amen by promise see God owns it amen he's the author of it all he's the author of eternal life he's the author of Eternal salvation he's the author of Eternal peace he's the author of Eternal Joy he's the author of divine love it comes from him and in his sovereignty he looked at you down through time and declared it to you he gave you that inheritance and said it's all theirs prise Lord hallelujah therefore he made you an heir of all things and the prophet said everything that Jesus Christ died for is yours you're an heir to it you're possessor of all things can you say Amen not just uh not not not just things that are seen amen but things that are unseen you're heir to everything you don't have to have joy today and Satan take it from you tomorrow you're an heir to Eternal Joy you're an air to Eternal peace you are an air to Eternal salvation no such a thing as being saved today and lost tomorrow saved next month and lost next year you are once for all saved you're an heir Lord so you now own it and have a right to possess it amen if you notice when God told Abraham it's to thy seat Abraham didn't have a seat but God declared it God called it as though it wasn't or called that which was not as though it already were not Abraham if you can come up with the seed this will be your seed's inheritance as well no it Abraham had already figured it out we can't have a child but God said it'll be to thy seed which was declared to him you going to have a child didn't have a seed when God gave the land to him and his seed it was impossible for him to have a seed children ain't that right but notice God promised him something that was impossible for him Abraham to have on his own now I looked up that word possible it means capable of being done capable of being carried out capable ain't that right well but it was impossible amen for Abraham to have a child right it was in him he could not carry it out he could not ensure that it comes to pass but it was a promise to him that God gave Abraham became heir of a promise right now think of it the promises that God gives do not have to be scientifically possible that's right right nor do they need to be humanly possible right right no promise of God is possible by human ability right or scientific ability yeah or by the power of Education can you say Amen look when God told Noah to build an ark because it was going to rain it was impossible for it to rain brother ramam said see Satan explained that it was impossible for it to rain from heaven for there was no rain up there his great scientific gospel that he preached in the Garden of Eden see he could shoot the instruments to the the moon and prove there was no moisture up there but God said there would come rain but Satan succeeded and poisoned the mind of the People by scientific research that it could not be done but he could not convince Noah it couldn't be done for Noah had hid the word of God in his heart come on now can you say amen and even though it was impossible there was a word given that made it possible when God Called Moses to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt it was impossible for him to do it on his own a one-man Invasion Egypt being a a the superow of that day the greatest nation of that day and yet God told Moses with the stick in his hand to go deliver them people from the hand of pharaoh ain't that right it was impossible but the promised word had power in it to make it possible the word had power God didn't need to borrow men's power God didn't need to borrow man's scientific uh uh uh Geniuses he had the power in his word amen that's right when Israel came to the land of of inheritance there were giants inhabiting the land it was impossible for them to defeat the Giants by their own ability that's what calls the the the 10 spies and and and the rest of them to to forget about God's word because they looked at their own abilities and said how are we going to possess this how are we going to defeat them Giants how are we going to have our inheritance when there's giants that are standing in our way we are as grass ERS in their sight they look to their own ability can you sayen see it was impossible but the word that came forth from that prophet's mouth had power in it to make it possible that's right come on now when Joshua led the children of Israel up to the city of Jericho it was impossible to conquer that City on their own amen the city was fortified by high walls and thick walls ain't that right but the word of God had power in it to make it possible you understand what I'm saying amen you're air a promise not what what the government promised you amen not not what your daddy and mama promised you but what God promised you you're air of that promise and that promise has the power in it to make it possible amen when God said a virgin would bear a son it was absolutely impossible for that to happen but the power in the word of God made it possible can you say amen I hope it making sense to you tonight but the inheritance amen is it made possible amen by the ability of man The Inheritance is based upon the word of God and the word makes it possible amen amen amen you love him now the word of God is our inheritance Lord every promise in this Bible is yours you're air to you're air to Divine Healing your heir of Salvation can you say man why because it's promised to you th this is your inheritance amen don't don't don't just throw this this treat this old Bible in any old way amen even the prophet taught us not to even put something on this Bible amen don't lay stuff on this Bible this is your inheritance can you say Amen there's things in you that are given to you that is given to no other man amen Kings can't even possess this amen monarchs can't even possess this but here we are chosen by God Amen and given an inheritance and every promise in this book is yours hallu yes sir amen come now aren't you glad for that Amen in this Bible it speaks of an Incorruptible body that's you're an air to it speaks of a throne you're an heir to it you believe it amen it speaks of a kingdom an eternal Kingdom you're an heir to it it speaks of a millennium you're an heir to it it speaks of a an eternal City you're an heir to it right everything of God's promise you're an heir too amen now notice what Jesus said all things everybody say all things all things say with me now all things are possible to them that are skilled in making bombs to them that know how to blow up the Earth to them that have great military power no all things are possible to them that believe can you say Amen nations are accumulating bombs and yet they with all of that military power they're not making all things possible the things that you are an air to you cannot get it through bombs you cannot get it through military power but all things are possible to them that believe amen glory right remember where Paul talked of people having a form of godliness and den denying the power thereof yeah you know what brother Bram said they're denying the power of the word the word has power right to make things possible the word amen it was impossible amen for for Samson to take a Jawbone an old dry jaw Jawbone of a donkey and defeat a thousand Philistines but the word made it possible can you say amen amen it was impossible amen for for uh uh David to to defeat Goliath amen here he was a boy not trained in military might and there was that big old Goliath that could have just squashed him like a bug it was impossible for David to gain the victory but the word made it possible see and the world is denying the power of the word but what that power is notice it's creative power coming from a creative word that's right amen you're not limited by by what you can't see you're not limited by whatever there is a creative power in that creative word amen can you say Amen that when it's not there it will be there right when there wasn't squirrels there was squirrels can you say Amen why because a creative word come from a the human lip and declared it to be soul and what was it was now there because it was a creative power coming from a creative word that's right amen amen you believe it I believe now so this this shows what kind of power the word has only God can create Amen brother Braham said he just speaks the word and it creates itself his words the created Power you believe it and now he puts the word in your mouth right he gave you the inheritance that's right amen can you say Amen in word form you receive it in your heart it now becomes spoken by your mouth a confession that's right come on amen it's not your words coming from your lips it's God's creative word coming from your mortal lips and sending out a creative power righten he just speaks the word and it creates itself his word the Crea a power how did the world come here he made it out of things which was not he just said let there be and here it is amen he believed everybody say he believed his own word how did you get here and become a bride there had to be a creative word spoken amen and a creative power come to you and begin to create something inside of you can you say amen God created by his own word God you know the prophet said God expects us he expects us to believe his word amen it's not optional true every member of this bride must believe the word of God God expects you to do it does it keep you from danger nope does it keep you from tribulations as far as trials and testings nope does it keep keep you from discouragement nope does it keep you from challenges nope but in it all he expects you to believe his word amen amen yes you believe it yeah the sons of God do not back up on the word right now if we're going to believe the word if God expects us to believe the word then we must believe every promise the same way that God believes it amen think about it and you say Amen when God spoke that word there was no doubt in his mind that that word was going to happen amen you are a word manifested am everything that you're this Earth is the is a word manifested God spoke it he believed it never doubted it can you say Amen so we must believe every promise the way God believes them now if you're a Son of God then the prophet said you are a part of God that's right ain't that right so when God believed his own word he believed his own word therefore you being a part of God you believe God's word when God spoke his word concerning Christ being born of a virgin he did not look for Plan B he did not look for some alternative that's right thousands of years amen between the giving of the promise and the promise coming there was thousands of years that God remained faithful in believing in his word amen can you say amen God chose you before the foundation of the world Prophet said you always were saved you weren't saved on any given day you always were saved and all of this time God faithful to believe his word about you he knew you were going to come he knew the exact moment you were going to surrender your life you might have been born out in Sin from a sinful family you might have been a drunk a Prost itute a liar you might have amen displayed every attribute of Satan amen and never anything good about you concerning God that God remained faithful in believing his promise prise the Lord God didn't look for any alternative no on God didn't look for Plan B no God didn't look for somebody else to take your place God was so sure of his word the prophet said nobody can take your place I don't care how insignificant you feel tonight how un worthy you feel tonight and how low you feel tonight there is nobody can take your place God is faithful to his word and that's the way he believes it and that's the way you must believe it if God called you you must believe that hallelujah hallelujah amen when he called Moses to lead the people out and told him how to do it Moses was full of weakness yeah it's the way God wanted it God didn't look for some alternative just in case Moses failed him yeah that's good no the prophet said God stood behind Moses in all of his mistakes hello and it wasn't that he was faithful to Moses it was he was faithful to his word and his word said I predestinated Moses I predestinated Moses Moses was not plan B Moses wasn't Plan D or plan Z Moses was the I idea that God had in his mind to begin well God was the or Moses was the thought the attribute God simply believed his own word you believe that now notice now 2 Corinthians 4:13 I won't keep you much longer but Paul said we having the same everybody say the same same The Same Spirit of Faith amen yes according as it is written I believed therefore have I spoken we also believe therefore we also speak good can you say amen that's why prophet he titled the message ble from the heart ble from the heart and when it gets down into the heart now you begin to act like God you begin to show you as as God would show amen you cannot believe the word without confessing the word can you say Amen church amen we we're not accepting something new we're not accepting something that is forign we're accepting something that's already been declared and that word that's been declared has all in our is in our hearts it is we're protecting it amen hall now what is it see it's the word of Faith yes Paul that's what Paul said it's the word of faith which is nigh thee even in thy mouth remember in the beginning Eve lost the word yeah yeah she chose an alternative and we know what happened but God true to his word promised that the word would be restored to her Hello Lord he promised to restore the word under Earth brother Brown said he told Eve there had come a time that the word would come back to her again now you remember that what she lost from it would be restored because there's only one thing that can restore and that's the word another place he said God promised the spiritual leave as same as he did the natural Eve that again the word would be restored to her in when would this happen in the last days he would restore to the church the original word again all right right can you say Amen now that word was restored Amen to the woman by Mary she done exactly what Eve should have done be it unto me according to Thy word ain't that right and he brought forth A Spoken Word seed am that's it come on now amen sure yes sir ain't that right so God fulfilled his promise now here it is God fulfilling his promise in this last day yeah come on now to the church to that spiritual Eve and we can say it with all of our heart that God kept his promise by sending to us the prophet of Malachi 4 and now the word has been restored to the church the church this bride you and I have been restored back to the word you believe it see he says the spiritual bride from Pentecost see when she fell at NAA then she's promised in the last days that the word will come again this is what Revelations 10:7 is all about but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophet what is this it's the restoration of the word given back to the bride praise the Lord this is what Malachi 4 is all about the original word Prophet said is restored again right sure God through the prophet of Malachi 4 of course his Min Ministry was the seventh angel Ministry revealing all the minist Mysteries and through that Ministry the word is restored back to the bride the bride restored back to the word the original word now notice with the restoration of the word the prophet said comes the restoration of power not Church power not government power but creative power that's right now we know what kind of word was restored to us because in this day there was a prophet out in the woods that needed squirrels there was no squirrels but a voice came to him remember he said the presence of God dropped in the woods yeah he said it was was incredible you you've heard him describe it I believe in I've heard but now I see and others that messages and the voice came to him how many squirrels do you want yeah didn't tell him the amount of squirrels that he was going to get he asked the prophet what how many squirrels do you want and he said I'll take three remember that yeah he said speak it speak where it's going to come from he said I picked the hardest place place that no squirrels would ever go amen you never usually don't find a squirrel on it he said let a squirrel come from that Branch du D du and and look at the farmer out there he said no longer did I say that here come a squirrel running down the tree on that Branch looking at the at the farmer and he shot it right and and he waited and waited you know and and I'm not clear on the story had been a a little bit since I've heard it but you know it enough amen but he waited and waited he was going to go home and and and and uh uh the but and and then the voice God held him to his own word and said but you said three that's right he was happy just that one he was all excited but you said it what was it God couldn't let that word fall to the ground it was his word being spoken through mortal lips amen that's good showing us that it wasn't just a word Doctrine restored to us it wasn't just the theology restored to us it was the creative word restored to us which restored back creative power amen hallelujah and if you notice if I could say it this way the prophet put the word in our mouth yes sir that's right the prophet put our the word in our mouth yeah praise the Lord did he not say that the word is in the bride amen how did the word get there in that bride a prophet praise the Lord amen come on now come on church that's right the prophet put the word in the bride on now Revelations 22:17 it says the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the bride say come ain't that right now where's she going to get the words to speak she's got a voice now Amen brother brand said she's the final voice to the final age so now she's got a word in her mouth it's been hid in her the word is in the bride can you say amen and now it's in her mouth but where does she get that word to speak brother Brown said listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God the bride will sayen say that again what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prop prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing amen can you say amen and what they say will have already been said already been written in the word can you say Amen everything that was sealed up in this book has now been made known to us amen praise Lord you believe it in Paul's age the word was sealed up for he spoke in a mystery yeah that's right I want to make it very clear Paul was not probing as the other ages he was a prophet but he spoke in mystery amen can you say Amen in Luther's age the word was sealed up in Wesley's age the word was sealed up in the Pentecostal age the word was sealed up this book The Prophet said has been probed at the through these denominational years and this word probe means to examine to to investigate to try to understand right that's right and they were reformers they were Scholars they were commentators that were just probing at the worken ain't that right but notice the seventh Angels message did not come from a man probing at the word amen guessing and hitting and missing again oh they all want to say that brother Brandon wasn't correct with this Bible come on now that he taught things that the Bible didn't teach hogwash it's just their eyes are blinded to this word that's right can you say Amen yes sir the prophet of Malachi 4 didn't restore our hearts back to the word by just probing at the word if he was just another prober at the word then then Luther and and Wesley and all of them ministers amen as good as they were they were just probers and they would have restored us back come on but God didn't use them men to restore this bride back God sent a Malachi for prophit to restore this bride back a prophet never has to probe at the word for the Revelation always comes to him the word comes to the prophets do you believe it brother Braham said a prophet not only means not only to speak the word but also to forth tell and is a Divine interpretator of the word divine word written so he's a Divine interpreter of the word no probing he's a Divine an interpreter of the written word amen amen are you with me see so then we find that the seventh angel is a prophet had to be a prophet yeah for when the lamb took the book from him that sat on the throne and El loosed the Seven Seals thereof and it was an open book now the mighty Angel comes down and descends with an open book and the prophet said the seventh angel is on Earth at the same time at this coming and the mighty Angel gives the book Revelation to that Prophet praise the Lord that Angel to reveal it to his people wow this is the time for manifestation of sons of God this is the time for matured Sons to speak the word and watch lightning flash amen where he says it'll flash like lightning can you say amen that's right remember it was only when the book was open not through all the other ages all only when the book was open after that book was open John was told to go get the book and eat it amen amen that's right what eat the Revelation get it in your heart amen why because after he ate it he was told to speak amen thou must prophesy prophesy speak can you say Amen Let It Be An utterance of words amen and more than just in the mouth it's becoming a living voice yes amen that's good can you say amen amen now this last day bride is not speaking words that come from a man that probed at the book no can you say Amen do you realize we understand the word that Paul preached better than those that set under Paul's Ministry sure amen as a great man he was and a great teacher Paul was yet we are a people that understand what he taught better than what they taught they they understood it to be can you say Amen why because the prophet of this last day this seventh angel messenger did not preach the word in mystery he revealed the mystery he revealed The Mystery of the godhead he revealed The Mystery of the Rapture he revealed The Mystery of the resurrection and the body change he revealed The Mystery of the Bride Can you say Amen we have a better revelation of justification than what Luther had we have a greater understanding of sanctification than what Wesley had we had a greater a greater understanding of the gifts and how they are to be operated than what the Pentecostals had in the p Pentecostal age for brother brandom said we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word perfect interpretation perfect clear interpretation the perfect Revelation with Divine Vindication then that which is in part is done away with can you say amen hallelujah that's right you don't have to go back to Luther amen and uh to understand justification you don't have to go back to what Wesley said understand sanctification you don't have to go back to what the Pentecostals taught to understand what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is and how to operate the gifts and and all of these things we now have a perfect interpretation of the Divine word love it amen that's true that which is in our mouth is the perfect interpretation of the word about it amen blessed we are amen true prophets speak of this true word and then that puts God exactly the same God same power same words the same everything the true word amen and now they the people had to believe they had to believe the prophet's word and Obey it before they could see God's Miracles can you say Amen if you notice brother Brown said as the wise men follow the star to the source of Eternal Light so will wise men today who are not blinded by Creeds they'll follow the god-given spoken word till they see the fullness of the power of God blooming forth in this hour oh my can you say Amen every promise that had been laying in this Bible is now to be made manifest by the sons of God because they are following and obeying what a prophet said they are receiving the word of a prophet can you say Amen even Paul would tell the people you receive not this word as though it was from a man but you indeed received it as of God which it is yes you love him that's good amen now notice as we close Abraham's confession was a sign that he had accepted what God Said as being the truth prise the Lord his confession was a sign that he had accepted what God Said as being the truth and the Word was in his mouth and he confessed and it brought about the impossibility and they had a son just like God said like he said can you say amen amen if the musicians will come prise the Lord Brother brandom said you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God hallelujah what's he doing he's putting a word in you amen he's showing you what you air to you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect you are perfect can you say amen that's right declaring those things that are not as though they already exist I am perfect I am perfect oh but you done this yesterday or you this and you got all this and you you you just got a mountain load of problems and all this but I am perfect can you say amen that's right you're not a sinner anymore but sons of God brother Braham said Jesus the word took my place he become me that sinner that I might become him the word let me hold true to it not the church the word all that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day why it's accumulating so fast out there in those deserts and things taking place that I couldn't even keep up with with it we're near the coming of Jesus to be United with this church where the word becomes the word can you say Amen aren't you glad for that oh we ought to be the happiest people the word becoming the [Applause] word we are taking possession of everything that God promised in this day the word becoming the word and notice the power of confession brother brandham said when we confess that the life of Jesus Christ is in US eternal life then the life itself will testify of what we are when we confess that the life of Jesus Christ is in us that eternal life then the life of Jesus Christ that's in us will testify of who we are Hallelujah my we're being changed from glor to Glory changed from Earthly to Heavenly changed we're being changed church we don't need another Prophet we don't need another messenger we don't need another [Applause] Revelation just hide that word into your heart and let it be in thy mouth to confess it and what seems to be impossible will become possible by the very creative power of the creative word

hearts that we not disbelieve Hallelujah we possess the inheritance we've been given the Abstract title deed we have been given the possession of our inheritance every word is yours in the name of
