[5:01] both speaker in here this evening and
[5:04] Lord may we grow may we be more edified
[5:09] father
[5:11] and I pray that just an anointing would
[5:13] just sweep across this building as our
[5:16] prayer
[5:17] for Lord we're your people
[5:19] we desire to meet with you and Lord you
[5:21] promise that we're two or three
[5:24] if it's just two or three gathered in
[5:26] your name you would be here Among Us
[5:28] and father we're under expectation to
[5:31] meet with you
[5:32] we love you in Jesus Christ's name amen
[5:38] we find uh here uh second or Psalms 23
[5:42] and I'm just going to read the first
[5:44] verse
[5:45] but it says the Lord is my shepherd
[5:49] I shall not want
[5:51] amen you can have your seats
[5:55] for just a few moments I want to just
[5:58] continue along the lines that um maybe I
[6:03] spoke on
[6:04] last Wednesday just a simple subject but
[6:07] uh the Lord is my shepherd
[6:12] and you know the word Shepherd I'm just
[6:16] looking up the shepherd and it means to
[6:19] feed to tend to flock to keep sheep
[6:23] to rule govern
[6:25] to furnish pasture for food to nourish
[6:29] to cherish one's body to serve the body
[6:32] to Supply the
[6:36] requisites for the Soul's need
[6:40] and then one says the task of a near
[6:44] Eastern Shepherd
[6:46] uh was they were to watch for enemies
[6:49] trying to attack the Sheep
[6:52] to defend the sheep from attackers
[6:55] to heal the wounded and sick sheep
[6:58] defined and saved lost or trapped sheep
[7:02] to love them sharing their lives and so
[7:04] earning their trusts
[7:07] so this was the the shepherd
[7:10] and we we know that sheep must have a
[7:15] Shepherd ain't that right
[7:17] and as we talk in the last you know
[7:20] Wednesday and which the Bible uh
[7:24] confirms it but without a shepherd these
[7:28] sheep will scatter if they don't have
[7:30] one and so in our opening scripture
[7:34] David reckons himself as being a sheep
[7:39] and uh of course he recognizes that the
[7:43] Lord is his Shepherd I think it's
[7:45] important that sheep recognize who the
[7:49] shepherd is right
[7:50] and David is saying the Lord is my
[7:53] shepherd
[7:55] um so he knew who he was following
[7:57] and and so David is when he's saying the
[8:02] Lord is my shepherd he's not he's he's
[8:04] not claiming something that he has no
[8:06] knowledge of
[8:08] I mean you know what good is to say well
[8:10] he's my shepherd and yet we don't know
[8:13] the responsibilities of a Shepherd we
[8:15] don't know the the the what a sheep is
[8:18] or or the role that a sheep would play
[8:20] and and it just becomes a massive
[8:23] confusion but David understood the role
[8:26] of a Shepherd he understood the role
[8:28] that a sheep was because because he was
[8:31] a shepherd and he he he was a Shepherd
[8:35] over his father's sheep ain't that right
[8:38] and so he knew the relationship that the
[8:43] Sheep would have with the shepherd or
[8:44] the shepherd would have with the sheep
[8:46] and he knew how valuable the shepherd
[8:49] was when it came to sheep so there was a
[8:54] bond that existed between the shepherd
[8:56] and the Sheep I was listening to the
[8:59] prophet today and he's talking about the
[9:01] shepherd and how the shepherd He was an
[9:04] unlearned man he he a very uh more
[9:07] ignorant because that's all he'd done in
[9:09] his life was to be a Shepherd I mean he
[9:12] stunk like the the Sheep he smelled like
[9:14] him he he actually the prophets said he
[9:16] began to laugh as a sheep you know just
[9:18] had to ah you know I I don't know how
[9:21] the shepherd laughed but uh uh but the
[9:23] prophet said he he was so at one with
[9:25] the Sheep because that's all he knew he
[9:28] was out there in the field with sheep he
[9:30] wasn't he didn't belong in the
[9:32] civilization he didn't uh uh uh Corrals
[9:36] the towns and all that he was a shepherd
[9:38] effort and so people looked at them as
[9:42] very ignorant but his heart was with the
[9:45] Sheep that's uh that's just what he was
[9:47] and there was an allo the Loyalty that
[9:50] existed between the shepherd and the
[9:52] sheep and and there was a trust a
[9:56] confidence that the Sheep had in the
[9:59] shepherd and so when David is saying the
[10:02] Lord is my shepherd then we're we we
[10:05] understand that this was the type of
[10:09] relationship that David had with the
[10:12] Lord it was a trust it was a confidence
[10:15] it was a it was a bond that existed it
[10:19] was a loyalty that was undying and and
[10:24] so it for example Psalms 31 and 3 this
[10:28] is David and again we look at him as
[10:31] what he describes himself as being the
[10:34] sheep for thou art my rock and my
[10:37] fortune address
[10:39] therefore for thy name's sake lead me
[10:42] and guide me pull me out of the net that
[10:46] they have laid privily for me for thou
[10:49] art my strength sheep talking to the
[10:53] shepherd right and he's writing this
[10:56] amen and so David understood that as a a
[11:01] sheep is helpless without the shepherd
[11:03] so was he helpless without the Lord and
[11:07] and as a Shepherd David had to go after
[11:10] uh uh the lamb and in in a couple cases
[11:14] that we know that is found in the Bible
[11:17] the lion had come a greater prey or a
[11:22] predator
[11:23] um
[11:24] uh strong and mighty and he had come
[11:27] after David's sheep and he snatched one
[11:30] uh from the the the the the the flock
[11:33] and and took off with it and and David
[11:36] so loved the Sheep David so loved them
[11:39] that and and David didn't have nothing
[11:42] he was just a boy but he had faith in
[11:45] God and and all he had was just that
[11:48] slingshot but we know the story that he
[11:51] went after that land am and and he
[11:53] delivered that lamb from the the lion's
[11:56] mouth think of the courageous the
[12:00] courage heart amen because he was a
[12:02] Shepherd the Sheep wasn't
[12:05] um the the the the the the Sheep wasn't
[12:07] uh having their confidence in David for
[12:09] nothing uh and then it happened again
[12:12] that that he rescued the lamb from the
[12:15] bear and and uh and and so David again
[12:20] as being the shepherd and acting as a
[12:23] defense for that sheep and and and a
[12:26] leader for the sheep and making sure
[12:28] that the Sheep get fed and and all of
[12:31] these things then he knew that the Lord
[12:33] was his Shepherd and and and notice
[12:36] Psalm 63 and 1 it says the psalm of
[12:40] David when he was in the wilderness of
[12:42] Judah oh God Thou Art my God early will
[12:47] I seek them
[12:49] my soul thirst is worthy My Flesh
[12:52] longest worthy in a dry and thirsty land
[12:56] where no water is to see thy power and
[13:01] thy Glory
[13:02] now David wasn't trying to exalt himself
[13:06] he's he's in a need he's he's in a
[13:09] desperate situation ain't that right and
[13:12] he's looking to the shepherd I'm longing
[13:15] for thy power I'm I'm longing for the
[13:18] manifestation of thy glory and and he's
[13:22] not writing to to many Shepherds he's
[13:25] not riding to many gods he's he there's
[13:29] one that is singled out Thou Art my God
[13:32] and early will I seek thee early and and
[13:36] I'm longing for thee I'm Longing To See
[13:39] thy power for my soul thirsteth for thee
[13:42] ain't that right so David is looking for
[13:45] the Lord to come on the scene for the
[13:47] Sheep knows no other power than that of
[13:50] the shepherd it leaves on no other power
[13:53] than that of the shepherd it leans on no
[13:56] other might than that of the shepherd
[13:58] can you say Amen you see for it belongs
[14:01] to the shepherd it's the it's the
[14:03] shepherd's duty to take care of the
[14:05] flock it's the shepherd's Duty a man to
[14:08] protect the Sheep ain't that right so so
[14:10] this is an unknown or whatever you want
[14:13] to call it but it's a bonding it's it's
[14:15] something that the Sheep begins to
[14:18] develop the trust of the shepherd amen
[14:21] and it bleats and waits for its Shepherd
[14:23] when it is lost and so here's the
[14:26] psalmist again Psalm 62 and 1. truly my
[14:30] soul weighth upon God from him cometh my
[14:35] salvation he only is my rock and my
[14:39] salvation he is my defense and I shall
[14:42] not be greatly moved ain't that right
[14:45] another place Psalm 71 and 5 for thou
[14:49] art My Hope O Lord God for thou art my
[14:53] trust from my youth amen I've trusted
[14:56] you all the way for since my youth amen
[14:59] by thee have I been hold up from the
[15:03] womb Thou Art he that took me out of my
[15:06] mother's bowels and my praise shall be
[15:09] continually Of Thee I am as a Wonder
[15:12] unto many but Thou Art my strong Refuge
[15:18] so there was a strong attachment that
[15:21] David had to the Lord his Shepherd a man
[15:25] as he would begin to express his
[15:27] feelings to the Lord it wasn't just a
[15:30] song that he wanted to sing I know you
[15:32] know there are songwriters that can just
[15:34] come up with songs in in a heartbeat and
[15:36] they'll do it for maybe a certain group
[15:38] or they'll write a song for this and
[15:40] that and that but David was writing
[15:43] songs that was expressing from his heart
[15:45] amen what he really thought of the Lord
[15:48] and his relationship between between him
[15:51] and and his Shepherd ain't that right
[15:54] and I think that all of God's sheep has
[15:58] that attachment I understand we live in
[16:01] a world where there's so much
[16:02] enticements and so many distractions and
[16:05] there's so many voices and and so many
[16:07] promises where you know we got the
[16:10] politicians giving us of promises and
[16:12] jobs that'll give us promises and great
[16:15] men giving Promises of position in and
[16:19] things like that but David he he was a
[16:22] sheep that was looking to his Shepherd
[16:24] can you say Amen the shepherd became his
[16:28] all in all the shepherd ain't that right
[16:30] he wasn't just looking to the shepherd
[16:32] for one thing and looking for this stuff
[16:34] for something else and this for
[16:36] something else the shepherd was
[16:37] everything to him and he's saying Lord
[16:40] you are my shepherd the Lord is my
[16:42] shepherd so so if I need help the Lord
[16:45] is my shepherd if I need strength the
[16:48] Lord is my shepherd if I need guidance
[16:49] the Lord is my shepherd if I need
[16:52] provision the Lord is my shepherd if I
[16:54] need fed the Lord is my shepherd if I'm
[16:57] if if I'm stranded if I'm lost the Lord
[17:00] is my shepherd if I'm in a position that
[17:02] I don't know what to do the Lord is my
[17:04] shepherd can you say amen and and it's
[17:07] an attachment that the the sheep have
[17:10] with their Shepherd and and so we we
[17:12] find you know that that even the the
[17:15] Psalms 20 and 7 some trust in chariots
[17:19] some trust in horses but we will
[17:22] remember the name of the Lord see this
[17:26] this is the attachment everybody else
[17:28] that ain't sheep they they're trusted in
[17:30] this they're trusted in that they're
[17:31] trust they don't know the strength of
[17:33] the shepherd they they don't know the
[17:35] ability of the shepherd they don't trust
[17:37] the abilities
[17:38] the shepherd and and it goes on they are
[17:41] brought down and Fallen but we are risen
[17:44] and stand upright
[17:47] attachment to the shepherd I I think of
[17:49] the time that when Jesus turned to his
[17:52] disciples and asked him will you go also
[17:54] remember the crowd left and he said
[17:56] where will you go also and and and and
[17:59] and and and Peter you know uh another of
[18:02] God sheep he he said Lord to whom shall
[18:04] we go for thou Hast the words of eternal
[18:07] life
[18:07] can you say man so so that Peter may
[18:10] have not understood everything about the
[18:12] Lord he may have not understood
[18:13] everything that Christ was and and the
[18:16] events that were going on but one thing
[18:18] that become clear to him the Lord was my
[18:21] shepherd
[18:23] I I don't know where else to go
[18:27] he had come an attachment there was an
[18:29] attachment I think there's an attachment
[18:32] to Christ
[18:33] I think to that real believer there's an
[18:36] attachment how else do we go where else
[18:39] do we go how can we turn to anything
[18:43] as that attachment
[18:47] what a difference
[18:49] experience that people have
[18:52] with the Lord who are not the Sheep of
[18:54] his pasture
[18:56] and you know we we have one example
[19:00] among many but that's the people of
[19:03] Israel in the wilderness and I'd like to
[19:05] read it and and I won't I won't keep you
[19:08] long the Lord willing but it's just a
[19:10] simple subject but Psalms 106 13. I want
[19:13] to just start there
[19:15] they soon forgot his works
[19:19] they waited not for his counsel
[19:22] but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness
[19:25] and tempted God in the desert
[19:29] and he gave them their requests but seen
[19:31] leanness into their soul
[19:34] they envied Moses also in the camp and
[19:36] Aaron the saint of the Lord the Earth
[19:39] opened and swallowed up days and
[19:41] uncovered the company of a Abram and the
[19:45] fire was kindled in their company the
[19:47] flame burned up the wicked they made a
[19:49] calf in horb and worshiped the molten
[19:52] image thus they changed their Glory into
[19:55] the similitude of an ox that eateth
[19:58] grass they forgot their they forgot God
[20:01] their savior which had done great things
[20:03] in Egypt wondrous works in the land of
[20:07] ham and Terrible Things by the Red Sea
[20:10] therefore he said that he would destroy
[20:13] them had it not been or had not Moses
[20:16] his chosen stood before him in the
[20:17] breach to turn away his wrath lest he
[20:20] should destroy them yea they despised
[20:23] the pleasant land they believed not his
[20:26] word but murmured in their tents and
[20:29] hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord
[20:32] therefore he lifted up his hand against
[20:34] them to overthrow them in the wilderness
[20:37] to overthrow their seed also among the
[20:40] Nations and to scatter them in the lands
[20:42] they joined themselves also unto Baal
[20:46] and and ate the sacrifices of the Dead
[20:49] thus they provoked him to anger with
[20:53] their inventions and the plague break in
[20:56] upon them they stood up uh finance and
[21:00] executed judgment so the plague was
[21:03] stayed or then stood up finayas and and
[21:07] that was counted unto him for
[21:08] righteousness unto all generations
[21:10] forevermore but notice they angered him
[21:13] also at the Waters of strife so that it
[21:16] went ill with Moses for their sakes
[21:19] because they provoked his spirit so that
[21:22] he spake unadvisedly with his lips they
[21:25] did not destroy the Nations concerning
[21:28] whom the Lord commanded them but were
[21:30] mingled among the Heathen and learned
[21:33] their work see there was no attachment
[21:37] that their story is a totally different
[21:40] story than what David had
[21:43] can you say Amen they they were mingled
[21:46] among the Heathen and learned their
[21:48] worst they served their Idols which were
[21:50] a snare unto them yea they sacrificed
[21:53] their sons and their daughters unto
[21:55] devils so so you could go on in that
[21:58] scripture that chapter there but it it
[22:00] clearly shows that the Lord was not
[22:03] their Shepherd
[22:05] can you say Amen the Lord you know he
[22:09] might have he he might have just been uh
[22:14] you know just a a second
[22:17] um um a getaway for him if you could say
[22:21] it that way but he certainly wasn't
[22:22] their Shepherd there there was no
[22:24] attachment uh uh there at all there
[22:27] there was no loyalty there at all and
[22:30] and any time that that something
[22:33] appeasing came they went and snatched it
[22:35] up and they would forget God
[22:38] and that's the way the churches have
[22:40] today
[22:41] that's why America's done it today
[22:44] ain't that right
[22:46] see so so we find that David knew the
[22:49] voice of a shepherd and followed him so
[22:52] much that that the psalm 68 and or 63
[22:55] and 8 David would say my soul followeth
[22:59] hard after thee
[23:01] that he wasn't passive about it
[23:05] he was intent about it everything about
[23:08] him was to follow the lord
[23:11] amen he was a sheep afraid to get to get
[23:14] get lost
[23:15] he had to keep that Shepherd near near
[23:17] him right following the shepherd
[23:20] the Lord is my shepherd you see it's
[23:22] it's not just talk it's a reality to
[23:25] every believer The Lord Is Our Shepherd
[23:28] do you have him as your Shepherd tonight
[23:30] see the Lord was his comfort it was his
[23:32] guide it was his his protector and he
[23:35] says I will not fear because he knew
[23:38] that the shepherd was with him every son
[23:42] and daughter of God are sheep
[23:44] no if ends butts about it
[23:47] we're all sheep if we're Sons and
[23:49] Daughters of God
[23:50] the Bible says we are the Sheep of his
[23:52] pasture ain't that right
[23:54] and even Jesus claims us as being his
[23:57] sheep for he said my sheep
[24:00] know my voice
[24:02] my sheep know my voice ain't that right
[24:05] and so we can say as David said the Lord
[24:09] is my shepherd and I am his sheep he
[24:12] belongs to me as my shepherd and I
[24:15] belong to him as his sheep
[24:18] and when we say that then we come to the
[24:21] realization that I am his responsibility
[24:27] it's up to him to take care of me it's
[24:29] up to him to provide for me it's it's up
[24:32] to him to to keep me safe it's up to him
[24:36] to to go on a defense for me
[24:40] it's up to him can you say Amen to keep
[24:43] me from the enemy it's all up to him for
[24:47] he's the shepherd and that's what God
[24:49] wants us to be as the shepherd
[24:52] or or the Sheep ain't that right amen
[24:55] that that's the relationship that he
[24:56] wants us to have not us trying to get
[24:58] the steering wheel and tell God what to
[25:00] do and how to do it and and and and and
[25:02] and put all the second plans together
[25:04] just in case his plan doesn't work
[25:07] but we come totally lenient upon him and
[25:11] at his Mercy
[25:15] now
[25:17] in John chapter 10 Jesus tells us what
[25:20] he is I am the Good Shepherd
[25:23] I'm the door of the Sheep
[25:25] the sheep hear my voice
[25:28] I call my sheep by name and lead them
[25:31] out
[25:32] I go before my sheep and they follow me
[25:35] for they know my voice
[25:37] is all in the 10th chapter Jesus
[25:40] speaking and establishing himself as the
[25:42] shepherd He was David Shepherd was he
[25:45] not
[25:46] amen that's right and and then Jesus
[25:48] goes on to say a stranger they will not
[25:51] follow
[25:53] a stranger they will not follow but will
[25:55] flee from him for they know not the
[25:59] voice of strangers
[26:01] and did you notice sheep walked by faith
[26:04] and not by wisdom
[26:06] sheep ain't walking following the
[26:08] shepherd said now you know what I I
[26:10] think I know you're going that direction
[26:11] but I think I would go this way if I was
[26:13] you
[26:14] no they walked by faith
[26:17] totally lenient upon the shepherd
[26:18] totally trusting the shepherd total
[26:21] confidence in the shepherd ain't that
[26:23] right see and and so they I go before my
[26:27] sheep and they follow me for they know
[26:30] my voice they're acquainted with my
[26:33] voice
[26:34] they do not lean upon their own
[26:36] understanding but they follow the
[26:37] shepherd
[26:38] ain't that right yes sir see and so then
[26:42] we find that Jesus not only tells us in
[26:45] the 10th chapter of John that he is the
[26:47] Good Shepherd but he also mentions some
[26:50] other things and he tells us that
[26:52] there's a thief
[26:54] and that Thief is out to kill
[26:57] to steal and to destroy I think him by
[27:01] mentioning that sheep or the the thief
[27:04] and what he's intending or intentions to
[27:07] do it it ought to magnify the greatness
[27:11] of the shepherd
[27:12] can you say Amen the thief cometh not
[27:16] but to steal to kill and to destroy John
[27:19] 10 10 and I am come that they may have
[27:22] life and might have it more abundantly
[27:26] and you say Amen so the Good Shepherd he
[27:28] knows who this thief is
[27:30] and he sets himself to protect the Sheep
[27:33] now I I be honest we see the thief
[27:36] working overtime in this age
[27:38] and he's leaving a path of destruction
[27:42] ain't that right just leave it a path of
[27:44] Destruction to where to where when when
[27:47] he's done with families they no longer
[27:50] resemble a family
[27:51] when he's done with individuals they no
[27:54] longer resemble the individuals that
[27:55] they were born as
[27:57] they they he just leaves us such a a
[28:00] path of Destruction that they're left so
[28:03] demoralized they're they're left lower
[28:05] than than an animal many times
[28:10] in their morale can you say man and and
[28:13] so he's working and as that you know the
[28:16] the prophet talking he said as that Land
[28:18] The Lion and the bear that David faced
[28:21] the enemy has come and calls God sheep
[28:23] to Bob off their hair and to wear their
[28:25] makeup and to look like things that the
[28:27] Bible condemns ain't that right amen and
[28:31] and this is that Thief he's he he he
[28:34] he's he's Robin of everything he's his
[28:37] whole intention is to destroy and if you
[28:40] don't have the shepherd to protect you
[28:44] amen and and and the thing is is Satan
[28:48] thinks that he's got the people
[28:50] you know but I like what brother Branham
[28:52] said we've got the slingshot of Prayer
[28:55] ain't that right we got the slingshot of
[28:58] prayer and you know the the prophet in
[29:00] his prayer he tells the devil he says I
[29:02] place and I think this is powerful I
[29:05] place between this habits and tempers
[29:08] and immorals and whatever it may be I
[29:11] place the blood of Jesus Christ by faith
[29:14] between them and that thing
[29:17] hello I think that's what the Good
[29:19] Shepherd does don't you think so he
[29:22] places something between us and the
[29:25] enemy
[29:27] that's right and he says and you'll not
[29:29] catch them anymore they're in the
[29:32] father's pasture they're they are his
[29:34] children keep them keep from them in the
[29:38] name of Jesus Christ Our Jersey can you
[29:40] say Amen so we we find that this is what
[29:43] we're we're dealing with the thief that
[29:46] is out to kill steal and destroy but
[29:49] then Jesus also speaks of the hireling
[29:52] in the same chapter as he's speaking of
[29:55] him being the the shepherd he's speaking
[29:57] of the thief but then he speaks of that
[29:59] hireling
[30:00] he's not a shepherd
[30:02] and the Sheep are not his own
[30:05] he's a paid servant and works for
[30:08] someone else ain't that right entirely
[30:11] and he doesn't have a Shepherd's Heart
[30:14] ain't that right he doesn't care
[30:16] anything about the sheep that he's
[30:17] watching over
[30:19] amen the prophet said when he sees the
[30:21] sheep or the Jesus said when he sees the
[30:23] the wolf coming amen after the Sheep the
[30:26] shepherd rungs or or that howling rooms
[30:30] he's fearful for his own life ain't that
[30:33] right and then the wolf catches the
[30:35] sheep and scatters the and scatters them
[30:37] but see God doesn't leave his sheep in
[30:42] the hands of a hireling
[30:45] God's going to make sure that sheep is
[30:47] protected
[30:48] and I you know this may not even make
[30:51] sense to you tonight but all I I want to
[30:54] just assure you that if you're God sheep
[30:56] you don't have to fear nothing
[30:59] he's he's the great Shepherd
[31:01] if if you're in the hands of God God's
[31:05] going to take care of his sheep
[31:08] if you're following the voice can you
[31:11] say Amen that's right see there's a
[31:13] nature of the shepherd there's a nature
[31:14] of the Sheep amen the the shepherd calls
[31:17] calls his Sheep by his voice utters his
[31:21] voice and the Sheep by Nature follows
[31:23] the voice because he knows the voice
[31:25] he's not questioning the voice he's not
[31:28] scared of the voice he's not trying to
[31:30] shun from the voice that voice is his
[31:33] comfort for it's the voice of his
[31:35] Shepherd
[31:38] amen
[31:39] now so we we find that Jesus the Good
[31:43] Shepherd he said I laid down my life for
[31:45] the Sheep
[31:46] look at David running willing to
[31:49] sacrifice life for that sheep that he
[31:51] was a type of Christ
[31:54] I laid my life down for the Sheep
[31:56] ain't that right now John 10 27 he says
[32:00] my sheep hear my voice and I know them
[32:03] and they follow me not my follow they
[32:06] follow me
[32:07] and I give unto them eternal life now
[32:11] how are you gonna how are you going to
[32:12] be despaired in that the great Shepherd
[32:15] gives you the greatest thing that you
[32:16] could ever have and that's eternal life
[32:21] and they shall never everybody say they
[32:23] shall never perish
[32:26] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[32:29] my hand
[32:30] that's the great Shepherd that's
[32:32] speaking to us every one of us tonight
[32:34] can you say Amen when it seems like it's
[32:37] all just chaos and it seemed like we
[32:39] don't know what to do remember sheep
[32:41] you're in his hand
[32:42] And he as the shepherd made the promise
[32:45] there's nothing that'll plucked you out
[32:47] of my hand
[32:49] ain't that right so he's obligated
[32:51] himself to you
[32:53] yes sir you believe that yes sir I I
[32:56] believe that amen nothing nothing and my
[33:00] father which gave them to me
[33:02] is greater than all and no man is able
[33:06] to pluck them out of my father's hand
[33:09] so you're in you're you're in the great
[33:12] Shepherd's hands but you're in his
[33:14] father's hands how are you gonna how are
[33:16] you gonna lose with that one
[33:19] praise God so what it telling us is
[33:22] there's no way
[33:24] there's absolutely no way that the sheep
[33:27] can ever be separated from the shepherd
[33:34] there's there's no way that the Sheep
[33:37] could ever
[33:38] be so far from that Shepherd that the
[33:40] shepherd can't reach down with his hand
[33:43] and pull him back
[33:46] and you say man
[33:48] now there is there there is a way
[33:51] to know if we are sheep
[33:54] John 10 25 Jesus said just break it in
[33:57] here the works that I do in my father's
[34:00] name they bear witness of me
[34:03] and he tells them but you believe not
[34:07] because you are not my sheep
[34:11] you're not of my sheep so you don't
[34:13] believe the works that I do
[34:15] the very works that testifying of who I
[34:18] am you don't believe them
[34:20] simply because you're not of my sheep
[34:23] so this tells us the opposite that if
[34:26] you are a sheep and the works are
[34:29] displayed you're going to believe them
[34:31] works
[34:32] right and you say man
[34:35] so now Jesus is that good shepherd he's
[34:37] the chief Shepherd he's the he's the as
[34:40] the prophet would call him the king
[34:41] shepherd
[34:43] we also see that God has placed men in
[34:45] the church to be his little Shepherds
[34:48] Jeremiah 23 and 3.
[34:51] and I will gather the remnant of my
[34:54] flock
[34:55] out of all countries wither I have
[34:57] driven them and will bring them again to
[34:59] their Folds and they shall be fruitful
[35:01] and increase and I will set up Shepherds
[35:03] over them which shall feed them
[35:07] and they shall fear no more nor be
[35:09] dismayed
[35:10] neither shall they be lacking saith the
[35:13] Lord
[35:15] the flock will not no longer fear no
[35:19] more be dismayed neither will they be
[35:20] lacking
[35:21] because God would shed us set up his
[35:24] Shepherds
[35:26] and you say man
[35:28] and I I believe this correlates with
[35:30] what Jesus tells Peter Peter do you love
[35:32] me
[35:33] yeah I love you feed my Lambs
[35:36] is that right
[35:38] second time Jesus tells him Peter do you
[35:40] love me yeah I love you feed my sheep
[35:44] right
[35:45] what's he doing
[35:47] the prophet said Christ is the shepherd
[35:49] He was going away
[35:50] and he was leaving the commission of his
[35:52] sheep which any Shepherd feeds which is
[35:56] his flock his church and he was leaving
[35:58] the commission with these disciples to
[36:00] continue to feed the flock to be a
[36:02] Shepherd to feed the sheep
[36:04] ain't that right
[36:06] I thought of the Prophet how he told us
[36:08] this he says it was the father's good
[36:10] will before the foundation of the world
[36:13] descend me
[36:15] to preach the gospel and Lead his sheep
[36:19] so brother Branham even knew that his
[36:22] responsibility was a shepherd over the
[36:25] Sheep of God
[36:28] and that it would please God it was the
[36:30] father's Good Will to place him a man in
[36:33] this world for this age to feed the
[36:36] sheep of God even the angel told Brother
[36:39] Brown said you were born on Earth to be
[36:42] a leader
[36:44] not a dictator
[36:46] not a king
[36:48] a shepherd
[36:51] a Shepherd can you say Amen
[36:54] so we find that Moses was a prophet
[36:57] Shepherd
[36:59] God Vindicated that Prophet Shepherd the
[37:01] prophet said to be The Shepherd of the
[37:03] Sheep
[37:05] but notice Moses as a prophet had the
[37:09] word in his mouth
[37:12] showing that he had the voice of God
[37:18] right
[37:21] my sheep know my
[37:22] voice
[37:24] my sheep know my physical looks
[37:28] nope
[37:31] see they're trying to make Jesus into a
[37:33] physical thing
[37:35] of today and they paint him all kinds of
[37:37] things but
[37:38] but we found out that the sheep can only
[37:41] know their Shepherd by The Voice
[37:45] ain't that right
[37:46] so here Moses had the very word of God
[37:50] the voice of God in his mouth
[37:54] and when he began to speak the Sheep
[37:57] recognized The Voice
[37:59] God was speaking through that Prophet so
[38:03] they recognized the voice of the great
[38:05] Shepherd
[38:06] and any true sheep of God can identify
[38:10] where the great Shepherd is or identify
[38:14] the great Shepherd by his voice and
[38:16] notice the prophet would tell us it's a
[38:19] scriptural voice
[38:20] amen praise the Lord amen can you say
[38:24] Amen
[38:25] because we want to be led right
[38:27] do we not we want to be led right
[38:30] because there's a thief out there and if
[38:32] we get fired from the shepherd the thief
[38:34] is going to kill us
[38:36] there's hirelings out there
[38:38] that if if the wolf comes the hurling is
[38:41] going to leave us
[38:42] but if we stay with the shepherd
[38:47] ain't that right
[38:49] so God would give us a prophet as our
[38:52] Shepherd as a shepherd and and we
[38:55] recognize that it's God's Shepherd
[38:58] because it's the voice of God speaking
[39:00] through him
[39:02] ain't that right
[39:03] that's why I don't have any qualms about
[39:05] this message
[39:06] I believe it's thus saith the Lord
[39:08] I believe this message is the voice of
[39:10] God my confidence is in there and and
[39:13] I'm attached to that message because
[39:15] it's the voice of the shepherd it's more
[39:17] than just the voice of a man it's not
[39:20] just a voice of a prophet it's the voice
[39:22] of the great Shepherd speaking through
[39:24] that prophet and I found I have an
[39:26] attachment to it I found that I'm safe
[39:29] with it I found I'm secured with it I
[39:32] find he's providing for me with that
[39:34] message
[39:35] can you say amen and and the enemy is
[39:39] all around the enemy is lurking all
[39:40] around but I'm safe I'm safe following
[39:43] the shepherd
[39:46] I'm safe
[39:48] because I know his voice
[39:50] it's a scripture voice
[39:52] can you say Amen
[39:56] also according to God's word God has
[39:59] placed the pastor in the local church as
[40:01] his Shepherd over the local flock
[40:05] Acts 20 28 take heed therefore unto
[40:08] yourselves and do all the flock
[40:11] over which the Holy Ghost hath made you
[40:14] overseers
[40:15] defeat the Church of God which he hath
[40:17] purchased with his own blood
[40:20] for I know this after that after my
[40:23] departing
[40:24] shall Grievous wolves
[40:27] full surprise Apostles enter in among
[40:30] you not sparing the flock
[40:34] can you say man so here we find that God
[40:37] would set Paul as the Apostle of that
[40:39] first church or the or I'm going to put
[40:41] it The Shepherd of the first church age
[40:44] the voice of God speaking through him
[40:47] he said I did not receive this of man
[40:49] nor did I receive it of myself I
[40:51] received this of God
[40:54] and he became the voice of God to that
[40:56] age
[40:58] you believe that
[40:59] but now he's getting ready to leave and
[41:01] and and the Wolves all around knowing
[41:04] that he's getting ready to leave
[41:07] and they're just waiting for him to
[41:09] leave to where they can just come in and
[41:12] to Devour the the flock but then God
[41:14] would set pastors
[41:17] Ministry
[41:20] can you say amen and Paul knowing this
[41:23] see after my departing shall Grievious
[41:26] Wolves and the prophet said false
[41:28] apostles
[41:30] nicolaitanism
[41:32] right will enter in among you not
[41:35] sparing the flock also of your own
[41:37] selves shall men arise speak and
[41:40] perverse things in other words the
[41:42] prophet said their own word everybody
[41:44] say their own word their own ideas
[41:47] see they're speaking their own words so
[41:50] they're not the real Shepherd
[41:52] speaking their own ideas
[41:54] and not gods and the whole point is to
[41:58] draw away disciples after them
[42:02] acts 28 and 20 and 30.
[42:05] now brother Brandon would say we
[42:08] Brethren and ministers
[42:11] we tried to live as close to God as we
[42:13] can because we have a sacred duty to
[42:16] watch over the flock of God which the
[42:19] Holy Spirit has made us overseers
[42:24] and I I I I I don't just attribute it
[42:27] just to pastors I I attributed to the
[42:29] faithful Ministry
[42:32] we as
[42:34] feeders
[42:36] of the flock of God
[42:40] and you say man
[42:42] we we have this sacred duty to watch
[42:44] over the flock of God which the Holy
[42:47] Spirit hath made us overseers we watch
[42:49] the flock to keep them in order
[42:52] to feed them sheep's food
[42:55] and sheep eats from the Bible the Lambs
[42:58] of God
[43:00] and you say man now notice another place
[43:03] brother Brown said it's the duty of we
[43:04] as pastors to see that this flock is fed
[43:08] and fed right because God Almighty will
[43:11] require your blood in our hands
[43:13] at the day of the Judgment we'll answer
[43:16] for you so seeing this great tremendous
[43:18] responsibility that's placed upon us and
[43:21] God has given us people who love us and
[43:24] come to hear us then we should spend our
[43:26] time constantly watching for your souls
[43:29] and when the first little thing we see
[43:32] raise it up that's not right it's our
[43:33] duty to come to that person because we
[43:36] are Shepherds watching that sheep
[43:40] and you say man
[43:42] not not now notice what a Shepherd sees
[43:45] that's not right
[43:49] not sheep picking on sheep
[43:52] not sheep trying to be Shepherd the
[43:54] shepherd
[43:57] can you say Amen
[43:59] see so he says see we should spend our
[44:01] time and then when the first see we're
[44:03] watching we're Shepherds watching that
[44:05] sheep so if I see a sheep eating on a
[44:07] weed that will kill it I better drive it
[44:10] away from that weed jerk the weed right
[44:12] away from it so it can't get to it
[44:14] because it'll kill the Sheep yeah
[44:17] ain't that right he said there's known
[44:19] in the Western countries a weed an
[44:21] animal can eat is called Loco wheat I
[44:24] don't know whether anybody's ever heard
[44:26] of it or not it's a loco weed a horse
[44:28] can eat that and you can't do anything
[44:29] with him he just becomes an outlaw you
[44:32] can't put a saddle on him you can't do
[44:33] nothing with him it's called Loco wheat
[44:36] you must keep your stock away from that
[44:38] weed because if it'll if it'll cause a
[44:40] horse to eat something like that a horse
[44:42] it'll eat it'll throw him in this
[44:44] condition to the spasm you'd be a very
[44:46] poor Cowboy to let your horse eat a weed
[44:48] local wheat it shows that you don't care
[44:50] and a real Pastor a real servant of
[44:52] Christ would be a poor example of Christ
[44:55] to see the sheep eat something that's
[44:57] going to drive him away or make him an
[44:59] outlaw before God a breaker of his word
[45:01] a breaker of his Commandments you
[45:03] shouldn't do that you should watch very
[45:05] closely
[45:07] can you say man
[45:10] now so we we find that Shepherds
[45:13] and sheep they're they're such a
[45:16] relationship such a responsibility
[45:19] thinking of shepherds
[45:21] brother Brown says you know in preaching
[45:23] the message why why it had to be
[45:26] Shepherds
[45:28] brother Branham gives the answer to that
[45:30] very question that he's asking why did
[45:33] it have to be Shepherds
[45:35] he said because God's lamb
[45:38] Jesus being God's lamb was born in a
[45:42] manger
[45:44] ain't that right
[45:45] and it couldn't be kings that would come
[45:48] to him it had to be Shepherds
[45:50] Kings wouldn't Rejoice about a lamb
[45:53] being born
[45:54] but a Shepherd would
[45:56] a Shepherd felt at home with the lamb
[46:00] ain't that right
[46:01] and he was the Vindicated word
[46:05] and he says the Shepherds fell
[46:07] completely at ease in that place with
[46:10] God's lamb
[46:12] now what was God's lamb the Vindicated
[46:14] word
[46:16] any time where there's a vending the
[46:19] vending the words Vindicated the
[46:21] shepherd always feels at home
[46:24] can you say Amen
[46:26] and any good shepherd does the same
[46:28] thing see they found that place with
[46:31] God's lamb and any good shepherd does
[46:33] the same thing when a Good Shepherd over
[46:35] the sheep can see the word made plain
[46:38] and Vindicated of what he promised to do
[46:41] that Shepherd's right at home
[46:45] if God's not vindicating it
[46:48] then the shepherd's not at home
[46:51] the shepherd's not going to lead his
[46:53] sheep in that direction
[46:55] the shepherd doesn't lead his sheep into
[46:57] psychology
[46:58] the shepherd doesn't lead his sheep into
[47:00] theology
[47:02] the shepherd ain't going to lead his
[47:03] sheep into things that that God has
[47:06] never Vindicated
[47:08] can you say Amen
[47:10] that's why we feel at home with the
[47:12] Vindicated word of the age
[47:15] ain't that right I I know I you know I I
[47:19] know that there's great commentators and
[47:22] they were they're great men and they had
[47:24] great things to say and great preachers
[47:26] of the past had great things but I'm
[47:28] just not at home in their field
[47:30] but I'm I'm at home with the Vindicated
[47:33] word of God
[47:35] now he says see I don't care what anyone
[47:37] else says see there's where God promised
[47:40] it and God did it and that's where the
[47:42] Shepherds at home at
[47:44] they say well the days of Miracles is
[47:46] past there's no such thing as a baptism
[47:48] of this Holy Spirit there's no such
[47:51] thing as the baptism of the holy spirit
[47:53] that was for the apostles but let a true
[47:57] Shepherd of the word preach it in the
[47:59] power of the Resurrection that Jesus
[48:02] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[48:05] forever
[48:07] that's what a true Shepherd will preach
[48:09] because that's where he's home at
[48:12] it's the thing that's promised
[48:14] Peter said on the day of Pentecost he
[48:16] said the promise is is unto you and to
[48:19] your children and to them that's far off
[48:21] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[48:24] call where every calls the promise and
[48:27] the blessing is true
[48:30] and let a genuine word-feeding Shepherd
[48:33] see that Vindicated and all the
[48:36] theologians of the world can't take it
[48:38] away from him because he know God said
[48:41] so and it happens
[48:44] I still believe that God feels with the
[48:46] Holy Ghost
[48:47] do you still believe that why we've seen
[48:50] it that's why we ain't going to bypass
[48:52] that that's why we're not going to water
[48:54] this thing down I believe in a in a
[48:58] power Deliverance
[48:59] [Applause]
[49:01] I've seen the drugs delivered I still
[49:03] believe he can do it today
[49:04] I've seen the people that had cigarette
[49:07] problems I've seen them delivered he can
[49:08] still do it today that's where we're at
[49:11] home at can you say man where the word
[49:14] is being Vindicated is where we are at
[49:17] home
[49:18] we feel at home
[49:21] why
[49:23] see it's just God's word always his word
[49:26] was made flesh and dwelling among them
[49:28] see now the prophet said see he promised
[49:32] the same thing in this day what the word
[49:35] made flesh
[49:36] the word going to become flesh in this
[49:38] day
[49:39] he says I wonder if we would recognize
[49:41] it the proud and the wise had never
[49:43] received such a thing as that they
[49:46] believed that if there was such a thing
[49:47] as the Messiah on the earth it would
[49:49] certainly have come to their
[49:50] denomination it would be their group
[49:52] that would receive it see or it wasn't
[49:54] right just think hard now he said if it
[49:57] ended their group see did you notice
[49:58] then God never chose any out of the
[50:01] group that he chose that who wasn't
[50:03] connected with any of it because one
[50:06] group would say well you see what we did
[50:08] and and they'd do the same thing today
[50:10] but God chooses the nobody that's the
[50:13] reason he chose the shepherd because the
[50:17] Shepherds was completely at home with
[50:20] God lamb in their Mists
[50:24] oh my
[50:25] his word made flesh among them
[50:30] well I love him
[50:33] so any true Shepherd stays with the
[50:35] message of the hour
[50:38] ain't that right
[50:40] because you know that's where the Lamb
[50:42] of God is
[50:43] amen that's right
[50:45] and notice the prophet says that correct
[50:47] Shepherd will feed his congregation on
[50:49] the word the lamb
[50:52] right
[50:54] now I'm going to close here that
[50:57] Revelations 2 17.
[50:59] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[51:02] the spirit saith under the churches
[51:04] to him that overcometh will I give to
[51:07] eat of the Hidden manna
[51:10] ain't that right so God promised hidden
[51:13] manna aren't you glad they're still
[51:15] hidden manna not local weed
[51:18] hidden manna
[51:20] that's right see and brother Raymond
[51:23] speaking of that scripture says this the
[51:25] hidden Manna it's a little something
[51:27] special
[51:28] what is the special he said see it's not
[51:30] not the blessing of the Holy Ghost see
[51:32] no that's for the whole congregation but
[51:35] the hidden manner was a special
[51:36] Revelation because he had to teach the
[51:39] others
[51:40] see it was a little more knowledge of
[51:42] the scripture that he could teach others
[51:43] he's supposed to be see you'll never
[51:45] live no higher than your pastor you just
[51:47] remember that see because he's the
[51:49] Shepherd that feeds you if the if he's
[51:51] the shepherd he's got to know where the
[51:53] Manna is to feed the sheep ain't that
[51:56] right see sheep will only grow
[52:00] as you feed the sheep sheep food
[52:04] ain't that right
[52:05] he says if you try to fire fry up a big
[52:07] Hamburg and give it to the Sheep he
[52:09] couldn't grow on that
[52:10] see that's not cheap food
[52:13] try to try to try to fix a nice T-bone
[52:16] steak fix it up give it to the Sheep
[52:17] it's not sheep food so it can't grow
[52:20] sheep like sheep food sheep must have
[52:24] sheep food
[52:25] are you with me
[52:27] hey man there there's a certain food
[52:29] there's a certain diet that sheep God
[52:32] sheep got to have
[52:33] ain't that right and God promised a
[52:36] hidden manna
[52:37] for his sheep
[52:39] it's not for anyone else it's for his
[52:41] sheep
[52:44] and it's true
[52:46] so a true Shepherd ain't gonna feed the
[52:49] sheep of God some man-made idea
[52:53] and you say man
[52:56] see so Jesus said man shall not live by
[52:59] bread alone
[53:01] the great Shepherd
[53:02] my sheep cannot live by just bread alone
[53:05] but they're going to live by every word
[53:07] everybody say every word
[53:09] that proceedeth from the mouth of God
[53:11] now look how lean the church has been
[53:15] All Through the Ages
[53:17] because he could not live by every word
[53:21] there was too much dogmas in it there
[53:24] was too much interpretations of man
[53:26] this book was a closed book
[53:29] then you say Amen it would only be in
[53:32] this day
[53:34] amen praise God hello
[53:37] brother Brown said there ain't you know
[53:39] uh uh talking about faith
[53:41] is going to take more faith than it ever
[53:43] was in any other age
[53:46] right well if we're gonna have to have
[53:49] more faith than any other age then there
[53:50] has to be the right food
[53:53] to give us the right kind of faith
[53:56] and brother Brandon said it's rapturing
[53:58] faith
[53:59] ain't that right why because this is the
[54:02] age of a rapture
[54:03] and not one sheep of God is going to
[54:06] miss the rapture so that great Shepherd
[54:10] has been watching over his sheep All
[54:12] Through the Ages
[54:14] yes sir and his sheep is going to thrive
[54:18] they can only Thrive off the word of God
[54:20] the hidden manna
[54:23] ain't that right now we know what the
[54:25] matter is in the Old Testament the man
[54:28] that came from heaven
[54:30] and it landed upon the Earth right it
[54:32] was a bread certain kind of a bread
[54:34] that's right
[54:37] yeah now they all ate that bread
[54:39] but they were told you cannot store that
[54:41] bread up you try to save it
[54:44] it'll get all maggoty worms
[54:48] be horrid
[54:50] and no doubt some of them unbelievers
[54:52] try to do it
[54:54] make a denomination out of it
[54:56] and set a final life they found death
[55:00] ain't that right
[55:02] but there's only one place
[55:04] that that manner
[55:06] live forever
[55:08] and that was in The Presence of Jehovah
[55:11] and it was known as The Hidden manner
[55:14] it wasn't for everybody it was only for
[55:17] those that was chosen to go in
[55:19] and those that were chosen to go into
[55:21] that place could testify that Jesus
[55:24] Christ was the same yesterday today and
[55:28] forever
[55:29] and God promised the fact would be the
[55:32] manner that he would feed his sheep
[55:36] amen
[55:37] now let's look at that Manna Jesus 6 32.
[55:43] I just love the great Shepherd are you
[55:45] I'm glad the Lord's my shepherd
[55:48] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[55:50] I say unto you Moses gave you not that
[55:53] bread from heaven but my father giveth
[55:55] you the true bread
[55:57] from heaven
[56:00] for the bread of God which he uh is he
[56:03] say that again for the bread of God is
[56:06] he which cometh down from heaven and
[56:09] giveth life unto the world so the bread
[56:12] has now become a person
[56:16] can you say man
[56:18] and notice he says it's the true bread
[56:21] remember going to church age book
[56:23] and and notice how brother Branham
[56:26] partial realization and true realization
[56:30] Jesus says I am the true bread I am the
[56:33] True Vine I'm the true he always put
[56:36] himself as the truth the true the true
[56:37] and the prophets at Sea notice partial
[56:40] realization versus true perfect
[56:43] realization the Old Testament was like
[56:46] like that hidden manner that they ate in
[56:48] the Old Testament that was partial
[56:50] realization in other words they would
[56:52] eat of it but it was not the thing that
[56:54] God had provided them as a permanent uh
[56:57] uh uh uh permanent thing but as they
[57:01] would eat they would look and and that
[57:04] bread testified of another bread to come
[57:06] that if you would ever eat that bread
[57:08] you'd never have to hunger again
[57:11] man
[57:12] can you say Amen the natural lamb spoke
[57:15] of a true lamb to come now we're not
[57:17] living in the parcel we are living in
[57:20] the perfect realization
[57:23] God not sinning God not sending bread
[57:26] from Heaven as he did in Israel Amen to
[57:30] the people of Israel he sent the true
[57:33] bread and Jesus is saying I am that true
[57:36] bread
[57:38] so the bread is a person
[57:42] yes it is then said they unto him Lord
[57:45] Evermore give us this bread
[57:49] sheep crying for bread
[57:52] and Jesus said unto them I am the bread
[57:55] of life
[57:56] what was he then he was the Vindicated
[57:59] word
[58:01] the word made flesh
[58:05] can you say Amen no wonder Shepherds
[58:08] were at home with Vindicated words sheep
[58:11] are at home in Vindicated word as well
[58:14] sheep grow from the Vindicated word
[58:17] sheep food
[58:20] hope is all right
[58:23] I am the bread of life he that comes to
[58:26] me shall never hunger
[58:29] and he that believeth on me shall never
[58:31] thirst
[58:32] now go to the 54th verse whosoever
[58:35] eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood
[58:37] hath eternal life and I will raise him
[58:39] up at the last day
[58:40] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[58:43] is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh
[58:45] and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and
[58:47] I in him as the living father hath sent
[58:51] me
[58:52] he sent by the same God that sent the
[58:55] partial
[58:58] the same God that sent Israel bread
[59:01] here's the true bread sent from God
[59:04] [Music]
[59:07] as the living father has sent me and I
[59:09] live by the father so he that eateth me
[59:11] even he shall live by me this is that
[59:16] bread which came down from heaven
[59:19] not as your fathers did eat Manna and
[59:21] are dead he that eateth of this bread
[59:24] shall live forever
[59:26] now did you notice it's in this day that
[59:29] God promised us in the matter and God
[59:32] has sent the manor
[59:36] John 14 18 I will not leave you
[59:39] comfortless I will come to you
[59:48] yeah a little while the world seeth me
[59:50] no more but you'll see me
[59:52] because I live you shall live also and
[59:55] at that day you shall know that I'm in
[59:57] my father you and me and I in you ain't
[1:00:00] that right
[1:00:01] at that coming what a revelation that
[1:00:05] that happens to us
[1:00:08] that we realize he's not only in the
[1:00:10] father he's in us and we are in him
[1:00:13] Revelations 10 1 and I saw another
[1:00:16] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[1:00:19] what is it it's the true bread
[1:00:23] it's the hidden manner
[1:00:25] hello
[1:00:27] Jesus promised he that he liveth beareth
[1:00:29] of me will live by me
[1:00:32] he had eaten my place you'll never eat a
[1:00:34] third Hunger again
[1:00:36] can you say amen I saw another Mighty
[1:00:39] Angel come down from heaven only Christ
[1:00:42] it could be so now what are we looking
[1:00:45] at him as
[1:00:46] not only are chief Shepherd but we're
[1:00:49] looking at him as our sheep food
[1:00:52] in this age
[1:00:55] something that most ministers ain't got
[1:01:00] hello
[1:01:01] I'm telling you people think you can
[1:01:03] just listen to any kind of a minister
[1:01:05] and just all that and get fed
[1:01:07] sheep you better watch it
[1:01:10] sheep sheep's got to have sheep food
[1:01:14] clothed with the cloud and a rainbow
[1:01:16] upon his head and his face was as it
[1:01:18] were the Sun and his feet his pillars of
[1:01:20] fire and he had in his hand a little
[1:01:23] open book see what is it God sending
[1:01:26] Manna From Heaven
[1:01:28] hidden manner ain't that right he's the
[1:01:31] man that comes from Heaven I like this
[1:01:33] brother Branham in his prayer said oh
[1:01:35] lamb
[1:01:36] come tonight in our midst and take the
[1:01:39] book and open the seals thereof and
[1:01:40] loosen the word to us
[1:01:42] and feed it to us as our great Shepherd
[1:01:46] and we your sheep so Desiring sheep food
[1:01:51] what is it it's the opening of the seals
[1:01:55] it's the opening of the word
[1:01:57] it's the message of the hour
[1:02:00] that we're feeding upon
[1:02:02] and yet is the unfailing bodied word of
[1:02:04] the son of man
[1:02:06] that we're feeding off of
[1:02:08] the Vindicated word can you say man
[1:02:12] if the musicians will come
[1:02:15] what makes a sheep
[1:02:17] because we go to church
[1:02:19] no because we we say God sent a prophet
[1:02:22] no
[1:02:26] we become sheep when we receive
[1:02:30] the Holy Ghost
[1:02:33] ain't that right
[1:02:35] and if you're a Believer then God gives
[1:02:37] you the Holy Ghost
[1:02:38] brother Brian said if you say you're a
[1:02:40] Believer and you don't receive the Holy
[1:02:41] Ghost then something's wrong
[1:02:45] because God promised that to every
[1:02:47] believer he would feel with the Holy
[1:02:49] Ghost
[1:02:50] God gives everybody every believer the
[1:02:54] baptism of Holy Ghost Holy Spirit
[1:02:57] that's right for that's the confirmation
[1:02:59] of your faith
[1:03:02] and it's then that we become Sheep by
[1:03:05] Nature
[1:03:07] because we receive the nature of the
[1:03:09] Lamb
[1:03:10] can you say man
[1:03:14] and then we become willing
[1:03:17] to eat
[1:03:18] I know there's a lot of folks that say
[1:03:19] they've got the Holy Ghost but are they
[1:03:22] willing to follow the shepherd home
[1:03:26] are they willing to eat the Sheep food
[1:03:29] that God's sins has sent in this day
[1:03:33] not not personality
[1:03:36] not Charisma you can't eat off of
[1:03:38] personality you can't eat from Charisma
[1:03:41] you can't eat man's theology man-made
[1:03:45] Doctrine
[1:03:47] God sent sheep food for his sheep
[1:03:52] and we begin to realize
[1:03:56] that there is this connection there's
[1:03:58] this attachment
[1:04:00] that we have with him
[1:04:03] we find that it's it's the whole it's
[1:04:06] it's it's it's everything everything
[1:04:11] the mighty angel coming
[1:04:13] it's the presence of the great Shepherd
[1:04:17] him crying with a loud voice is the
[1:04:20] voice of the great Shepherd
[1:04:22] we find the words that's coming
[1:04:26] and of course it's the the the the the
[1:04:28] the the the seventh angel comes and is
[1:04:31] given the book to reveal to the people
[1:04:33] so the sounding of the seventh angel is
[1:04:36] the voice of the great Shepherd
[1:04:38] and the and the food that has been given
[1:04:41] remember he he was told to store up food
[1:04:45] spiritual food in due season
[1:04:48] we're realizing that this message is
[1:04:50] everything we need I don't need this
[1:04:54] message plus I just need the message
[1:04:57] I I I I I find that the great Shepherd
[1:05:01] has made himself known through his voice
[1:05:04] can you say amen and as long as we stay
[1:05:07] with that voice
[1:05:09] and as long as that voice is sounding
[1:05:11] Out
[1:05:12] the Sheep will follow the Sheep will be
[1:05:14] fed the Sheep will know
[1:05:17] can you say Amen
[1:05:19] God bless you
