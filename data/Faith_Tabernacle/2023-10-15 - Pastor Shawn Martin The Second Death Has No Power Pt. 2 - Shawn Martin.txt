Bible we are told of an Angel to behold yes a prophet ET sent to change the course of man in a lowly place of birth came a light down to the Earth for it was proof a mighty gift that blessed our land now the time of changes here and the sign he said was clear that when a steak was driven down into the ground for he was told to travel West that a people might be blessed it was a season that the Thunders were to sound I'm telling you there'll be a change after while where we now wear a frown we'll wear a smile oh we may suffer pain or loss but Jesus died upon the cross that we might have a change after a while the price of change was high in cost indicted all the total lost when the angel put his theed on land and sea but the bride was washed in Bleach put her sins far Out Of Reach now the Virgin bride stand absolutely free I'm telling you there'll be a change after while where we now wear a frown we'll wear a smile oh we may suffer pain or loss but Jesus died upon the cross that we might f a chain after a while the Rapture call has done gone out we saw the cloud and heard the shout we are looking for our change just any day my brother listen while I sing the word inside you is the thing it'll take us home my friend no matter what they say I'm telling you there'll be a change after a while where we now wear a friend will wear a smile oh we may suffer pain or loss but Jesus died upon the cross that we might have a change that we might have a change that we might have a change after a while probably sooner than later amen thank you for that we know it's going to be definitely soon it's this is the age it's the end time [Music] God's children years he La them through the cold and through the night they say let's turn back keep going land is just inside there will

he first loved me and oh how I love Jesus oh oh yes so how all do you love him [Music] tonight Jesus oh How I Love Jesus because he first love [Music] me amen I'm glad we can love him amen and as the Bible says we love him because he first loved us amen and to think that we are a blessed people to know his love and to have experienced it and tell you what it just becomes greater and greater amen now the musicians can be dismissed and certainly enjoyed these songs the specials amen and I believe there's going to be a change after a while amen and um um I'm glad to be part of that change amen good to have brother Steve sister Elizabeth amen and um I appreciate uh him filling in uh last Sunday uh there in brother Amos and um praise the Lord I I believe uh the church was blessed and helped amen and um also brother Andrew uh is going to be um he's headed home and um Tuesday Morning be flying out to uh New Zealand and then Australia and so he's asked that we would just pray for him and uh Lord just give him safe travels and bring him home safely and Lord just bless the meetings there and we certainly appreciate brother Andrew and was was talking about uh the other day uh he and I talking about how long he's been gone amen and uh he is staying pretty busy but um uh he asked me to greet you all all and to let you know that he sure loves you all loves the church and and U he tune he Tunes in every service that he can if not then he listens to these Services uh afterward but uh so he he does stay connected but U it's nothing like being at church and uh having him here in person but uh he's uh certainly been a blessing uh to the bride uh or around the world and uh we appreciate what God is doing uh The Book of Revelations the 2 chapter if you have your Bibles and um Revelations chapter 2 and uh we just uh let's see here uh the 11th verse but it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death and then if you'd like to go with me to Revelations the 20th chapter and um we've read these two scriptures um this a couple weeks ago now but um praise the Lord um it's uh Revelations 20 and 6 blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer precious father Lord as we enter this part of the service now Lord we realize how sacred it is father and this is the most important part for it's your word we ask Lord that you would help us just to surrender ourselves to thee and and as we yield ourselves Lord may you work through us and I pray that you would anoint me Father anoint my lips Lord and just speak the words of life to us pray that you would anoint the congregation their their hearts and ears to hear and understand father we just ask it Lord may your word have the preeminence in this service tonight in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seats this evening and um I uh just uh again uh maybe if use the title the second death hath no power and um here in Revelations the second chapter God is addressing the uh Overcomer uh and he rewarding the Overcomer by not letting him be part of the the second death so it's important that we we do overcome um in in this age and O overcome uh means to stand the test got to stand the test so if if if that's what it means to overcome then there's going to be a lot of tests brother Bill uh come our way and all through the the ages uh God has had Overcomers uh the Saints of the Old Testament they all overcome um uh Jesus he stood the test in the midst of all of his enemies and he's when sickness come in the presence of sickness he overcome in the presence of death he defeated it in the presence of hell he defeated it in the presence of the Grave he defeated it in the face of Calvary of his own death he defeated it and the prophet said he defeated it by surrendering himself and so he defeated it all by the word and by humility ain't that right so so God in Christ defeated his enemy on every front every turn where the devil come at him God in Christ it was God in Christ defeating his enemy and now Christ in his bride is defeating every enemy uh that that uh comes against the bride of Christ now God is not in the Lo business of losing his people sometimes we think overcoming requires you know efforts or strength and uh our our ability and and a lot of times you know we don't feel like Overcomers and sometimes we wonder how we will overcome and and these things but but God's not in the in the business of losing Jesus said all that the father hath given me I will not lose a one ain't that right so then we we look at overcoming uh that it's not a random thing it's not by accident and it's not by your willpower or your choice per se uh uh and it's not based on sheer luck uh but rather overcoming is is based on predestination uh you see God wouldn't save you and fill you with the Holy Ghost knowing that he was going to lose you because you couldn't overcome the world Amen that's that's not how God works and and and and to be honest uh the the pressures of life and the age that we're living in the darkest Agee the most deceitful age amen that that we're living in you and I wouldn't been able to stand against it at all there there would be no way to overcome the age if it had not been God's predestinated plan for us and and because the Bible does say that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible now it's not because I'm smart that makes it not that makes it deception not possible uh uh it has nothing to do with me ain't that right but we understand that that by the scriptures that our overcoming is predestinated and and and uh uh for for instance Revelations 3:21 uh uh God speaking again to the Overcomer to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also have overcome and said down with my father in his throne ain't that right so this is a reward only to the Overcomer but if you notice Jesus tells us that the the position is not just given freely uh but it's it's actually been prepared for certain ones uh uh Mark 10:35 it talks about the disciples uh uh James and uh John I believe and they' come to Jesus asking that you know uh that that they could that he would Grant unto them uh one to sit on his right hand and the other one on his left hand and and uh in thy glory and Jesus said unto them you know not what you ask can you drink of the cup that I drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with and they said unto him we can you know and Jesus said unto them you shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of and uh and and with with the baptism that I baptized with shall you be baptized but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared amen so so there is a place that place is a predestinated place for a certain group group of people that is predestinated for that that place can you say amen and so so brother random even said that the that that position wasn't even in existence at that time because we had yet to overcome and and he says Jesus says I don't Grant this I can't Grant this but it will be given after the trial comes so there has to be the trials uh before uh uh uh this this can be given and he says I can't give it but after the trial comes they'll sit on the right hand on on the left and there's a predestinated seed see waiting out yonder for that it will be given to the ones that it's promised to it'll be given there but the test hasn't come yet he hasn't overcome yet can you say Amen so so it wasn't in existence at the time that they were talking about these things and but but he that it overcomes that's who this is prepared for and they are predestinated so therefore the Overcomer is predestinated to overcome because God would not God would not pre prepare a such a position amen if he had no idea amen that we were going to overcome if he left up the the overcoming to us in our in our own ability our human efforts and all of that forget the position right but he would predestinate amen uh uh the position for the Overcomer and he would predestinate the Overcomer to that position they are predestinated to overcome and it's already written that there's going to be Overcomers amen because Revelations 12:11 says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony ain't that right so so uh brother brandom in in I think how can I overcome he likened the Overcomer to the Lily and he says there's nothing hardly as pretty as a a great big Pond Lily call it water lily he says how it's Radiance he says now where does it come from where does this Lily come from and notice how he's he's typing the Overcomer to this L he said it's a little seed down in the bottom of a muddy moncky Pond and that little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in it is in it right then when it's in that mud amen but it has to strive daily see knowing that there is something see it's black it's dirty it's Mucky it's slimy and yet in that slime that it's living in it presses its way through the mud the mck and the waters and the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what's been hid in it all the time ain't that right so see so that that is the that is the Overcomer and and brother random says see God by his predestination has brought this sea to life and it's pressing itself see coming to light and now on top of all of that it has overcome ain't that right see but it could overcome because there's a seed that is there put it's it's nothing that just happens there's a seed planted in that muck and the Meer and the scum and all of that and yet that seed has predestinated ordained Amen to come to life ain't that right and so it's pre it it it it it works it it pushes it it strives amen because God predestinated it for that time Amen to do so so he says see it doesn't Express itself down there in the muck and the Meer see it can't express itself there but it's getting up to express itself it's pressing through to express itself well he says neither did you in your sin and adultery and everything that you lived in you did not express anything see but there was a seed in there ain't that right see well how did the get there by predestination amen see so that's what makes an overcomer that's what makes you an overcomer is not that you're the the the best tithe pairer not that you're faithful at church it's nothing that it's not that you you you you you you've got all the dos and the don'ts down it it it's nothing there God put a seed down inside of you and that's what makes you an overcomer see and it's got a chance he said see but there was a seed in there and it got a chance to press itself into light and now you're in the presence of Jesus Christ with the sunlight it brought out what you really was in the beginning and we we know uh uh over and over we're not we weren't a sinner in the beginning we were Sons and Daughters of God we were always saved we we were with him in the beginning ain't that right and so now as you're overcoming as you're pressing as you see uh uh you standing the test it's only expressing what you were in the beginning so he said you see what I mean you saw the light you bloomed out you laid your heart open and now you're a lily amen so again God by his predestination has brought this SE to life and it's pressing itself now what are we to overcome uh the prophet said we are to overcome the leodys and age and every Spirit every demon throughout the ages is now congregated uh uh right here uh the Bible talks about hell being moved and and and and we know that the lid has come off of hell and every demon power is being Unleashed in this age that we're living in ain't that right but brother brandom says now what are we to overcome we are to overcome every denominational critic and now I'm going to talk about the Overcomer for just a moment because it's the Overcomer that the second Death Shall Have No Power Over amen overcome every denominational critic Believe It or Not There are critics around this message and and anytime uh you know uh uh you go and listen to the uh what is the attraction on the mountain and brother Bram makes the statement anytime God makes history and fulfills prophecy it all always brings up the critics as well as the Eagles see he says they come together to find out what's going on some coming for curiosity some coming to find fault others coming to criticize ain't that right so you you you there there's overcoming that that we have to do and and and it would be nice if if if coming into the message it's a uh uh is is the right word Utopia would be the right word or or a play where there's just no no one bothering us no one you know and and that's not true because the message of the hour brings everybody together and and not everybody's a Believer not everybody understands not everybody sees it but yet everybody congregates and and and so uh uh you you have to overcome the critics if you want to be in free in God if you want to be free then you have to overcome the critics who say that we are too emotional if if you want the same Pentecostal experience that they had on the day of Pentecost then you have to overcome amen the the critics that say that that's not possible we we we've moved uh uh beyond that experience if you want to be used of God then you have to overcome the the critics that put the limits on God as to how he can move and how he can work and and and and all these things if you want to grow as a as a Christian then you have to overcome the spirit of unbelief that is trying to silence the five-fold ministry amen within the message ranks and and they want us just to keep quiet and just to play the tapes in the church amen which we already know that the Bible talks about the the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints and and and and on and on and on but see you have to overcome amen these things that we have to overcome and we know that these Spirits amen have come from denominational thinking and and and you say well they don't teach uh uh you know uh uh preachers to be silent whatever I I don't know whatever denominational belief but I do know this a denominational spirit is a spirit of unbelief that tries to change the word and takes us from the promises of this age so there there is overcoming and and and we have to overcome the spirit of unbelief that says the nine spiritual gifts aren't in operation anymore amen and uh uh just before brother Brandon went off the scene he said this he said by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body which is the body of Christ and in that body is nine spiritual gifts operating through the local body the local church and that's Apostolic if I've ever known of it ain't that right see so there there's overcoming and you young people well all of us but but you young people you you you struggle with different things and brother bradam said is to overcome in this age you have to overcome the popular sins of this age now now there's a lot of things that is popular and and and and and and you know uh uh movies telev I mean there just all kinds of things that that that is causing the people to to become uh uh less less on fire for God and and getting our minds in in in in all kinds of directions and all of that well there there's the popular sins of this age amen and and then also we must overcome the attitude of Le osia where it says that I am rich I'm increased with goods and have need of nothing amen and brother Bram said we have to overcome that amen if there's ever a time we need God it's now if there's ever a time we need the spirit of God and the power of God and the moving of God it is right now can you sayen money cannot do what the spirit of God can do amen material things cannot do what the spirit of God can do amen friends cannot do what what the spirit of God can do amen we need God more than ever in our lives ain't that right amen so so brother brandham would go on and and says he see you've got to overcome the nicians overcome the things of the world overcome see these denominations overcome these priesthoods overcome every thing of the world and sail out and love Christ ain't that right so so but but youve you've got to remember you are predestinated to overcome amen if if if we stood here as ministers you know uh uh uh uh the ministers here just just here we could get discouraged brother Terry if if if we're just preaching and we're dependent upon the people if we're dependent upon your ability if we're dependent on you to catch everything that we're saying amen see uh uh it would really get discouraging amen but see we we we don't look at these things because we see that there's a predestination there there there is a people that is predestinated just as much as I'm standing here and predestinated amen to minister to you tonight in this service you're predestinated to hear the word amen and that word will take effect I I just believe that amen and and I I don't think that you have to understand everything amen but just to believe amen we don't understand everything that the prophet taught amen and and to be honest it's such an eternal word that that you can hear a message and say amen I got that one and a year from now if you're growing in God you'll hear that same message and didn't say man I didn't understand everything that I do today it's an eternal word amen but one thing about it you're believing it amen you're believing so the second death shall have no power over him and and that's the believer now of course death is separation the first death is in the physical amen where we separate from our loved ones we we go into the presence of God never never out of his presence the prophet said and and and so that's the first amen is to where uh uh our loved ones that's passed on they they've they they've separated from us we can't hear them can't talk to them can't can't can't fellowship with them or anything like that but the second death is the death of the soul and remember the Bible says that the woman that lives in pleasure is dead while she liveth in other words there's a separation amen she can have all the friends she wanted she could be she uh have all the world and and and all of these things things and but yet she's separated from her God Amen it's it's it's because she's dead while she's alive It also says that the soul that sinth that Soul shall die so brother random says see it's completely separate no more it's cut off see it's it's cut off and there's no more to it see now now he's talking about the soul he said now how long will take it'll go down through the same process it comes it come in and it'll come to a place Till There Will neither be nothing left of it it's just like the body the body amen just uh when it dies and and the life goes out of it amen that body just slowly uh deteriorates and slowly deteriorates it may take years especially with the embomb and all of that but it returns amen back to where it came from amen see and so brother BR said it'll just go back from every what it was made out of so he says the body dies first and then the Soul dies next and it will be no more ain't that right now I Ezekiel 18:27 it says when the Wicked Man turth uh away from his wickedness he that he has committed and doeth which is lawful and right he shall everybody say he shall save his soul alive because he considerest and turneth away from all his transgressions that he committeth he shall surely Live and Not Die aren't you glad for that what a hope amen yes so we see in in order for the soul to not be part of the second death it has to be quickened it has to be quickened and this word quickened is to be made alive so the prophet said when a man is converted his soul becomes alive with the supernatural so the natural man knows nothing of the supernatural amen that that she lives she's dead while she live a see oh she she's more uh uh in touch with the world she's more connected with the world Amen but she's dead that she in in that she has no conception of the supernatural power of God ain't that right so the man knows nothing of God and cannot know God if his soul hasn't been quickened yeah religion cannot Quicken the soul legalism cannot Quicken the soul theology formalism cannot Quicken the soul can you say Amen emotionalism cannot Quicken the soul amen now I want you to notice amen Psalms 22 and 29 break it in it says None everybody say none that means no man no one no boy girl or woman amen none amen can keep his his own soul alive there's nothing now you'll have to excuse excuse me I'm going to take a cough drop amen I don't know what's going on but we'll we'll get through it anyways amen so so none can keep his soul his own soul alive now this is where the people the churches are trying to keep man alive they're trying to Quicken amen and we we we've seen it in in in again in the Pentecostal where we built up the emotion emotion we worked on the emotion and got people emotional and and and to where they cry to where they dance to where they shout to where they uh felt good and and and and all these things and and we found out it still don't keep a man's Soul alive brother amen we gone through it in the legalism and all that but we found out it doesn't keep a man's Soul alive yes sir see amen so brother brandom now he tells us you are a Time time being how many believes that you're a time being until you're born again amen then you are Eternal being see and the only way that you can get that is to have part of God in you being eternal life so we we find 2 Corinthians 3 and 6 it tells us that it's the spirit that giveth life ain't that right Romans 8:11 says say but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you see so it takes the the the quickening power of God to Quicken that soul and make him alive ain't that right so we see how the overcoming is amen it takes the power of God to make you an overcomer yes sir I I I now here's the way I feel I don't believe that you're going to overcome and then God quickens your soul after you've overcome I I don't believe that I believe the only way you can overcome is there is a quickening power that's entered into you that's an eternal life and there's no devil in hell that can kill that life that's within you yes sir Hallelujah Paul said in Ephesians 2:1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins Colossians 2:13 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him notice having forgiven you all trespasses notice blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross aren't you glad for that amen Psalms 30 and3 oh Lord thou has brought up my soul from the grave thou Hast kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit aren't you glad for the quickening power amen now I want you to notice what brother brandom says as long as you've got a Pentecostal experience in your heart Pentecost in your soul giving you eternal life then God has promised you that you'll never be touched with the second death see you've got eternal life and cannot be touched with the second death ain't that right now you see the Pentecostal age has has made the the Pentecost it's it's they they they' made it all about jumping shouting emotion uh uh they've made it all about you know the operation of gifts and and and so you judge them they made that the the people that are spiritual that can speak in tongues that prophesy that that sees the Visions sees the dreams and it it somehow marks them as some spiritual uh uh individual and you know we all you know ooh and all and you know and all these things and and you know but and and we believe that the Pentecostal age was the restoration of the gifts and God hasn't taken that out if he restored it if he took the time to restore it he didn't take it out amen but see what what happened is they centered on that and then they taught that that the Holy Ghost was the evidence of the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues Amen brother brah said if you received the Holy Ghost by speaking in unknown tongues you did not get it like it was on the days of of Acts in the day of Pentecost ain't that right but so see what they've done is they misinterpret the day of Pentecost and what really the Pentecost was is the quickening of man's Soul yes sir can you say Amen the people were quickened in their soul what was quickened amen not the flesh not the spirit but down in that Soul there was a SE Gene word quickened ain't that right it was laying there now notice why the prophet said we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed everybody say I was seed therefore I was reborn amen yes sir you were seed therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nons seeed there is nothing to Quicken that's right speak in tongues all you want to if there's not a seed there it cannot be quickened that's right roll on the floor all you want to if the seed ain't there it cannot be quickened sit on the Pew and and be like a church mouse and and and don't say a word amen it still ain't going to Quicken you if there's not a seed there truth see it's it's now if you notice what now brother Bram says now see that Eternal eternity people being Eternal see we he says it's not the person that comes Eternal cuz we don't believe in pre-existence of souls so it's not the the people it's not us that that are are uh predestinated eternally from God brother bradam said it's the word or the seed can you say Amen see you you you you're going to fight your battles and you're going to go through your pain you're going to go through your mind battles you're going to go through your discouragements you're going to go to all kinds of things and you're going to go up and down but what is eternal is a seed that is predestinated and God predestinated that seed to overcome in this Le otsy and age sir than do you believe it that's the now that's why an eagle could be born in a chicken pin that's right cuz he was Eagle to begin with ain't that right now brother Brown said see way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Romans 9:13 and neither was born and neither had done good or evil see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God brought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone had the seed and that is why he had respect to the birthright and the Covenant of God can you say amen amen do you realize no persuasion there is no persuasion that a man could do God could do or a prophet could do if you didn't have a seed within you to overcome he couldn't make you overcome he couldn't persuade you over come that's why us ministers aren't here to persuade you for nothing we ain't trying to persuade you to be a Christian you either are a Christian or you're not but if you are a Christian it's because God placed the seed within you that's What Makes You rugged that's what makes you indure that's what makes you go you don't have to understand everything that comes your way but there's a seed within you you will press you will fight you will go you will endure because there's a seed that has been predestinated that word is the seed that God placed within [Applause] you now notice what brother Brown said if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age no no no no persuasion can you say Amen you don't have to backtrack and and and and be all you know silent and hope you don't offend everybody know if there's a seat in there you'll draw that you will amen now the second death will have power will have power over every soul that's not been quickened so the word seed in our soul is Quicken which makes us an overcomer in this L leodys and age we are living in an age where men have just lost their ruggedness people's just lost their ruggedness and and you know even probably the ruggedness the most rugged Man in this age ain't as rugged as what they used to be but it's it's it's you know how it is it's just well the Bible says the every generation gets weaker and wiser so that's scripture it's it's weaker and wiser ain't that right so we are in a weak by Jesus called us a weak and adulterous generation that we're living in ain't that right and and to think that we would fall in that category we would we we would fall in that category to where we would want everything our way you know the everybody would have to pet us and be careful and and and walk very very softly around us because we could get offended you know and leave the church we could get offended and just quit all together and and and on and on and on and on but we don't fit in that category because God put a seed within us and says that seed will overcome sister Jane that's why you're still here through all them years of troubles and heartaches and everything that you've gone through through amen someone's going to overcome it ain't by our will you know good and well that it ain't by our will ain't that right so on the day of Pentecost see the people were quickened and what were they quickened to the word for peter said this is that that which the prophet Joel spoke of ain't that right so so it I believe it was a word birth in that day that would Quicken them to the word see so when the spirit of God came into your soul what does it do the prophet says it quickens you from the things of the world the world becomes dead just like before you had life in your soul before there was a quickening amen then then the world was alive to you and the word of God was dead to you ain't that right and and but then then that's all you knew is the world that's all you understood is the world that's all you comprehended was the world that's why your friends were worldly friends that's that's why your surroundings were worldly surroundings that's why the atmosphere come from atmosphere of the world but but but see God didn't forget you because there was a seed he laid in you and that seed began to hunger that seed become life and and it it could have been just a mission on the street he could have been just hearing some little song or something amen about a move of God or what and all of a sudden something began to draw you there and tell you know s sister Becky God draw you to this to the place to the message to where you are at rest amen people trying to get her to go back and go this and go here and go there and she said no no no no no I found what I was looking for well I believe that's that's all of our story is we found what we were looking for and I don't care if you're a young person here tonight or or an the oldest person in here tonight you found what you're looking for when the seed is quickened praise the lord it's a word birth brother brandham said see it quickens you from this life to eternal life see another place Quicken together to set in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus feasting on Mana from above seeing the hand of God made manifest prove the promise of this day and ain't that right now notice the prophet said the church's identification today is to manifest the promised word of this day I got to say that again the church's identification it's not saying I'm Baptist assembly is of God Church of Christ Catholic that's not our identification that's the world's identification well I I'm I I belong to a certain Club I belong to this and I belong to that you don't have to belong to nothing except let this be your identification and that is to manifest the promised word of this day by The Same Spirit that manifested and quickened the word then the Same Spirit quickens the word to the believer today and manifest the same thing see you didn't start that way you were born in the muck and the Meer that predestinated seed begins to push shove if that's what I'm to be that's what I want to be see brother Brown say see it shows that the token is on this person which is the resurrected life of Jesus Christ Living in his believer ain't that right so he says when God placed his holy spirit in you which is God then you are Eternal as God is amen now we're talking about second death now he said you're part of God because you become a son or daughter of godone and you are displaying his word word for this age another place he said Jesus was the Roy seed he lived in a human body and when the spirit called to him the word manifested thought he went to Jordan and was baptized in water upon obeying the word the Holy Spirit came upon him and the voice said this is my beloved Son hear ye him notice the voice did not say this has become my son Jesus was the son he was the predestinated son amen and the Holy Ghost positioned him as that son before them all then having been filled thus and the same pattern holds at uh Pentecost and Ever After he went in demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of God and from God for that day hello that's right so the Holy Ghost doesn't make you a son you always was a son this Dynamics does not make you a son it it it it places you as a son it shows to the world you always were a son amen ain't that right so you don't become seed when the Holy Ghost comes upon you you it only identifies that you are a seed ain't that right now in Galatians 3 and I'm going to try to hurry now I got got a few things but Galatians 3 Paul identified the seed singular with Jesus and he counted the seed children as children of the promise see and so the promise has to do with the prophet said election or the choosing of God that that's the promise see we're children Children Of Promise what is the Overcomer Children of the promise ain't that right so he says see these who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated for known of God and were in the mind of God and His Thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the design decreed season and how when do we become expressed in a mortal body surrounded by death surrounded by corruption surrounded not only by physical death but spiritual death hello and yet we were in God's mind Eternal Eternal ain't that right see so as each member came forth became expressed it became expressed and took its place in the body body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride yes sir another place God sent forth the Holy Spirit it was to Quicken also that seed of eternal life that he forew before the foundation of world that would be here another place that word lives and produces itself just exactly what God has ordained for this age you have it ain't that right the Holy Ghost the holy spirit being displayed so that's the overcome the word coming to manifestation in you that's why you don't quit that's right I got to say you can't quit you can't quit I ain't trying to encourage you I'm just trying to tell you you can't quit how many people have tried to quit and can't quit I think it was Ezekiel that said I tried I I just got so discouraged I think it was Ezekiel or Jeremiah he said I I got so tired and discouraged and sin the people and their Stony fa faces and all of that he said I just I just told God I ain't doing it I and he said the more I sat there the more like it was like fire shut up in my bones he couldn't he he just can't see so he says what is it he said see the Holy Spirit the word has been quickened to you by the Holy Spirit to vindicate this age that you have passed from Death un life so what it it you are his the the Holy Ghost has bore witness in you and through you that you are his ain't that right and because he is we have the right to all that he has purchased for us every promise in the Bible is yours isn't that worth overcoming that's worth over every every every trial everything that we go through because we know that every promise belongs to me no longer am I looking at and say well that just belongs to Brother Steve that just belongs to Sister Elizabeth that belongs to you know to my wife no no no I can say it belongs to me I'm taking it now as personal ain't that right I'm believeing for you too but I'm believing for me too so he redeemed you to every promise that he predestinated you to and he has quickened you to it right amen now that's how you can press like the Lily through the mud and the muck of the world ain't that right now notice Psalms 33:18 behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him upon them that hope in his Mercy to deliver everybody say to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine are we not in famine yes sir not just of not a famine of hearing or of bread and water but a famine of hearing the word and as I said you know famine death follows the famine and spiritual death is all over the land but here we find that God is here to deliver their soul from Death our soul from death and to Keep Us Alive in the middle of all this famine Lord amen see the second Death Shall Have No Power Over You the second death is more powerful than the first death amen because the first death doesn't finish everything amen it only affects the physical but but you know if you know we have found out that that even in the physical God raises the dead ain't that right so the first death really doesn't finish everything but it's the second death that finishes it all some people have the notion that when a man dies physically then then he is no more existent and he just ceases but that's not true the resurrection of Lazarus proves that man doesn't become extinct amen Moses being seen on the mount Transfiguration talking to Jesus years thousand or so years after he had already died and yet they saw him there alive talking to Jesus see even Jesus proved it when he preached to the souls that were in prison yet his body was laying in the grave amen lifeless and yet he was there preaching to the souls in prison in hell so the physical death that first death does not finish everything a man the Tucson paper wrote an article years ago about that woman driving down the road going about you know 50 m an hour and uh she hit an old man with an Overcoat on and you know the prophet said she screamed she stopped her car it threw him up in the air right out in the plain desert she run back to find him he wasn't there so what did she do some people behind her saw it happen saw the old man fly up in the air and and and his Overcoat turning so they run back to find out they couldn't find the man anywhere they called the police police come out to examine the place there was nobody there each one of them testified the car chugged hit them hit the man he went up in the air everybody saw it Witness two or three car loads of them they seen it happen come to find out 5 years ago there was an old man with an Overcoat hit uh uh uh killed on the same spot ain't that right so brother Brown said see what what it is when you leave here you're not dead you've got to come back even if you're a sinner and be judged according to the Deeds Done in the body ain't that right so whether sinner or Saint a man the physical death does not not annihilate uh uh uh the the the individual brother brandom or or not brother brandom but uh Revelations 20 and 4 uh through five talks about a people reigning with Christ for a thousand years and and notice the fifth verse says but the rest of the Dead everybody say the rest of the Dead Liv not again see until the thousand years was finished so those that have died in the grave brother uh uh uh Revelation talks about the first resurrection and that that the first resurrection is those that have went that died in Christ and they rise ain't that right and the rest of the dead lives not for an A Thousand Years or until the thousand years was finished ain't that right see so again uh the physical death does not annihilate the believer nor does it The Sinner uh 1 Thessalonians 4:15 15 says for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not pre vent them which are asleep amen amen see for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first ain't that right well the message teaches us they're not actually dead because they have eternal life so they're just asleep ain't that right they're just asleep amen see so then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with the with them with those that are in the grave and they have risen we'll be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord well where are we going to the wedding supper ain't that right now I'm just going be honest we're we're we're death does not separate us from God this death does not Anni us we will actually be with the Lord at the wedding supper I can't explain it all but I know I'm going to be there I know you're going to be there can you say amen that's why the prophet said we a Believer does not need to fear death that's let him threat let him do whatever let all the bombs come it does not matter when when when we leave here we're automatically within just a second or half second split whatever we're in the presence of God Lord amen now notice the wedding supper there we're going to be there and the tribulation is happening here on this Earth ain't that right then the Bible says we'll return We Will We those that were dead in the ground for how many years thousands one don't matter we will return for our honeymoon for a thousand years on this Earth that's right aren't you glad for that and the prophet said that pillar fire is here now leading us to our honeymoon that that death has no barrier the pillar of fire knows how to get us there and it's going to happen I don't care if you die tomorrow that Pillar of Fire will take you there you believed it am it's here now notice Malachi 4:3 and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of host talking about in this age brother Bram says it's in the Millennium we will walk on the ashes of the wicked showing that they're going to be dead ain't that right I don't I don't believe that we're going to be walking on piles of Ashes but what it is is the Earth is to be burnt with a fervent heat the prophet said he'll blow it to Pieces some of these days and he'll burst forth the Earth and she'll renew herself with volcanic eruption and there will come a m I there then where the righteous will walk out upon the ashes of the wicked see the whole earth is to be burnt over and he says in another place it's the way the world has a purifying itself again for the Millennium now he ain't going to take you to a just a junky Hotel amen that's right for your honeymoon is that right right amen you know we you know as we all do we talk sometimes the different ones whether they've already been married or getting ready to be married and talking about the wedding and talking about what they're going to do and you know and some you know you hear them say well if I had money if I had the money I would rather spend it on the honeymoon to go somewhere really nice then maybe the wedding you know all this you know spend if I if I had my options you know instead of spending it all on that wedding you know that's going to last for so much I'd rather put it on the honeymoon where we can go and enjoy a place you know and well you know and and that's everybody what everybody wants to do there and and all that but my point is there's that desire to you go somewhere in a to a nice place now if that's within the human being what do you think about God the god of Perfections the god of that has there is no Perfections like God has amen and his desire is perfect for you yeah if he's going to make a city perfect for you that's right then just imagine the honeymoon that he's got for us am it's going to be Flawless right now so so it's going to be beautiful place the prophet said and right now the whole world is in its birth pains she's travailing trying to bring forth a a new world for the Millennium now you think of that the Earth is travailing now I'm I'm I'm getting somewhere and I'm on to hurry but the world is travailing look at the chaos look at the nature politics Rel anything that we look around there's chaos it's travailing to bring forth a new world for the Millennium for a new people that won't sin and pollute her that's what a prophet said this Earth itself you talking about you groaning for a new world this Earth is groaning Amen to bring forth a millennium for you Hallelujah a people that won't pollute her anymore a people that won't soak her grounds with blood anymore a people that won't just treat her like any old way anymore yes sir can you say Amen see she's bringing forth she's travailing trying to bring forth a new world for the Millennium for a new people that won't sin and pollute her ain't that right and as Christians we are in travail because Christ is trying to bring bring forth a bride so the Earth is groaning all creation is groaning and the same travail that it has we have I say to you the Earth will overcome you're going to bring forth a new millennium that travail ain't in vain there will be a new millennium there will be for a people that has travailed too we are travailing we are we within us we're travailing we don't want that sin we don't want them habits we don't want them we are travailing for a new world to bring be a bride that Christ is looking for God can you say Amen now notice brother the earthquake burst open and the Stars Shake volcanics will come forth and the Earth will renew itself new lava will break forth from the center of the earth and she'll crumble all around and around and around when she spins out and Yonder and I tell you one morning when Jesus and his brother pride comes back to the Earth there will be a paradise of God and them old Warriors of the battle uh walk down there uh uh through there with their friends and loved ones the anthems will F the air of an Angelic host amen oh it was well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord that's been prepared for you like you should have had back Yonder before Eve started the ball rolling in sin ain't that right amen it's going to be a beautiful place Hallelujah ain't that right Hallelujah so now now think of it while we're at the at the the wedding supper the tribulation is going on here under that Sixth Seal yeah and what is the Tribulation it's a time of purging purging the church is purged the prophet said Israel is purged everything is purged under that six seal so that the Millennium can start in it's all for you everything is for you there has to be a cleansing first sir see there is a whole earth is to be purged there will be such a thing that the moon the stars and all nature will be purged you see what it is the Earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the Millennium the millennium's coming up and everything's got that's got any filth in it is to be purged during the six seal then he says the Battle of armagedon will be the last of it when this whole world comes to the Battle of armagedon that'll settle the whole thing just before the great Millennium Armageddon is to clean off the Earth she P rep purifies herself with this Atomic blowing and the volcanic ash this and things sinks this soaked blood of men and upon the Earth and sin and crime she sinks beneath the earth and the volcanic briad raise out again and renews and cleans the Earth for the great Millennium he cleans his church during that time for a people to live here I say like that he say see there's coming a great time when it'll be great or there's coming a time when it'll be great ain't that right now still thinking of this second death and the first death you know Revelations 20 And1 tells us where Satan will be during the time of Millennium and it says and I saw an Angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and the great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit uh and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years shall be fulfilled so what what is this Thousand-Year millennium brother Bram said it's the Sabbath day when the church will not labor against sin no more amen is't that wonderful you've overcome thank you Lord you've endured you fought every devil in hell the devil has brought everything that he can against you and youve stood it he takes us home to a wedding supper and we come back to this earth it's cleaned off and now we're in a Sabbath for a thousand years where we don't have to labor against the sin hello and during this time Satan is bound by a chain brother brandham called this chain a not a natural chain not a log chain but a chain of circumstance ain't that right which means he says all of his subjects are in hand hell at that time and there's nothing for him to [Music] do there's nothing he's work he works in him right now he fulfills what he wants to do in them right now he makes them Little Devils right now but in that time in that Millennium all of his subjects will be gone and those that have overcome will have a Sabbath right where they don't have to war against sin no more can you say Amen now notice he says all that was resurrected on the earth the first resurrection was redeemed and Jesus with them so Satan could not work on anything he had his chance to work on you right right now hello but you're overcoming as I've said before this isn't this isn't we're not in the same condition like Eve was when she was tempted she didn't have no mind battles she didn't have sickness she didn't have pain she didn't have Agony she didn't have heartbreak she was in God's Eden amen and Satan tempted her and she fell for so God says okay you think that was easy you think you can do that all the time huh okay I'll just show you I allowed that to happen I'll put a people on the Earth in you're eating right yeah amen and I'll let you have control in every way you can every demon Unleashed on them I'll show you they'll still stand hello and you're standing and there's a millennium prepared for you and this Earth where the world doesn't know what's going on all nature is acting crazy it's in trevail to bring on a millennium for youus see in that time Satan ain't going to have no one to work on he's already tried his best with you and he couldn't do it so there comes a time that Satan says all right that's it it's done leave them alone prise Lord you're going to be on that honeymoon no mind battles then no pain no Agony no Temptations no discouragements amen no bad word spoken then no shunning no friends walking away hello see brother brand says see the lamb brings his church home his his subjects and cast his enemy into the Lake of Fire and all of his subjects go in there with him and that's it then we walk out in the Millennium prise the Lord I hope this all right so he says see Satan is helpless and hopeless just waiting for the resurrection of his subjects he can't do nothing with you but see I'm just trying to show you that physical death does not do away with sinner or Saint he said see then they're separated as the sheep from the goats not the bride that's right amen now if you look uh I I'll try to hurry Isaiah 11:6 the wolf shall also dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the Young Lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them brother Brown says see that speaks of Innocence amen praise the Lord and the the cow and the bear shall feed their young one shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox and the suckling child shall play on the hole of the ASP and the wing child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den and notice they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea am is that right so then we know that the rest of the Dead are resurrected after this 1,000 years and this is the second Resurrection so the the first death is not the final thing Revelations 20 and 7 and when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to to deceive the Nations see which are in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle so now he's got someone to work with again and the number of whom is as the sand of the sea ain't that right so notice brother Braham said in this second Resurrection when they come up then Satan's loosed out of his prison for a little season then the judgment is set see watch Jesus with the bride as king and queen set at the throne white throne judgement they're not standing Before the Throne they're sitting on the throne they have overcome and the books were open and the books of the Sinners and another book was open which was the book of life and every man was judged thus by the bride amen by the bride that's right praise the Lord don't think that your your overcoming is not noticed by God Amen prise the Lord so when The Sinner dies in closing now when The Sinner dies he is finished because he cannot repent there's no chance to repent amen for the Deeds that he's done here in this life then his soul will eventually go out of existence because he had not eternal life right can you say Amen I'd like to get into it later on but there is no such thing as the prophet said as eternal hell ain't that right there's no such thing as anyone who doesn't have eternal life here on in this life living eternally in that other life eternal life getting having eternal life is so important to have eternal life now amen ain't that right amen so the sinner will not burn in hell eternally because he doesn't have eternal life and we all know that there's no other source of eternal life than God ain't that right so then to have eternal life is to have God himself living inside of you quickening the word seed amen that that he put within you so then the The Sinner they'll they they'll be punished and and brother Brown said it it could be billions of years that that they are punished for their deeds and and these things it could be a thousand it could be hundreds it whatever it will be but then there comes a time that he is no more that's the second death because he's brought to a total Annihilation amen ain't that right so you you can see why Satan fights the new birth he has fought this message with all that's with in him because we realize that it wasn't just a man bringing a message brother brandham said it's the Dynamics the quickening power that has come to us that's right ain't that right God quickening the soul God God bringing a quickening power and so this is why he would get subtract uh not subtracted but uh subra anyways get us uh somewhere else besides the word of God sidetracked uh because uh um uh he doesn't want us coming to a new birth and if you build your life upon emotions that's not the new birth and this is why I again I think God for a prophet because man he he he dice I mean he got a he got that sharp sword and he started dissecting everything I mean he just started whipping away everything cutting away from that new birth so that we could truly see a new birth and what it means and what it is to us it's not about speaking in tongues that makes a new birth it it's it's not about you know saying God sent a prophet that makes a new birth it it it's it's not about you know being anointed to sing and to write songs and and to preach even that that makes a new birth hello see so so we as message Believers we we have a solid a solid concrete evidence of a new birth thank God aren't you glad for that yes thank the Lord amen now brother brandham would say and and as the musician come thank you for your patience but he said why will this Overcomer this believer escape and go into the rims of eternal life and Bliss because Jesus paid a price sir to Ransom us from sin he filled the gap of separation and we who were afar off are now made nigh by the blood and they will never come into condemnation they will never be in that Lake of Fire they can never be lost for he will lose none of them not one of the redeemed will be anywhere except where Jesus is can you say Amen the second death hath no power over us amen Lord do you love him thank you Lord you can see why Satan does his best to convince us that God doesn't love us anymore that he's forsaken us you can see why Satan is doing his best to convince us that what we're believing in is is just fraud it's fake it's there's no reality to it you can see why he's doing his best to get us separ you know get us looking off in other things the world entertainment and getting our mind so wrapped up on on on the phones and Facebook YouTube and and Instagram all them others that are out there he's doing his best to Sidetrack us from everything but you got to overcome you got to overcome sir you might be getting weary but overcome you're going to overcome you're called to it he's with you you see the purpose of him bringing you to the message of the hour not for you to be a lukewarm lay osia but to chop you out Hallelujah so you can stand out and overcome brother BR Mory told us it's not the age that is overcoming it's the individual that overcomes so everyone that's going to overcome you you might might be standing among your friends and you be the only Overcomer you might be the only one that says no I don't want to do that I'm I'm I'm overcoming and you may not even be able to explain why but that seeds down inside of you pressing pushing doing everything it can to express every promise that God has called you for it's already in the seed it's already in the sea amen amen you love him why why do you want to overcome and no one else does why do you want to serve the Lord and no one else does why is it that you want to quit the things of the world and all your friends just don't understand because God is calling the individual to overcome it's not a party thing it's not a club thing it's not a group thing the only thing that you need to be identified is with the Jesus Christ and his church cuz he's in his church that's you love him it ain't a certain building that's right that we're identified with it's not a certain preacher that we're identified with it's the Holy Ghost identifying himself with us we're identifying with the word of the age and the word is manifesting itself through us you see as I've I've I've told them these young ministers back there I said you can either be a med yre preacher or you can be a full-fledged Minister where God anoints you to where when you get up and preach the anointing is behind you you can do whatever you want to do God's called you to preach it's whatever you want to be you can go out there and keep your nose in the in the movies and and and just live old life and and then only study when when when you're called to preach on called on to preach or you can prepare your life and and be ready live consecrated to God you understand what I'm saying you see and and that's the same thing with all of us here we can either be mediocre church members or we can be what God wants us to be and that is that Overcomer that stands up not because we want to be different because God made us different that's God to where the power of God is flowing through our lives to where we see God just moving and working we see the Vindication of God can you say Amen overcoming that's right overcoming that means Overcomers I'm an overcomer bless the name of the Lord what song
