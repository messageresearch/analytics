and the musicians can be dismissed and it's good to have Mark with us amen praise the Lord and um we won't say we just really enjoyed the Gathering yesterday and I addressed all everyone that was there had a good time and I'm gonna have to do it again praise the Lord and appreciate brother Tim for uh supplying the fireworks too amen and just had a good time and um good to see sister Alice with

evangelist and just a great Minister a man but it's uh good to have them with us and but if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and um just continue on this chapter here and praise the Lord but before we go into the word here may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we're so glad that you have invited us to come and to eat Lord and we're just asking now that you would just move Among Us Lord we're nothing without you father we're a needy people and Lord we see the the times that we're living in and the world falling apart as it's already been prophesied and we see scriptures being fulfilled left and right father the Lord we we believe that you're still here among your people that you wanna you wanna speak to us and father we pray that you would just help us get ourselves out of the way help me Father I've known to give that you placed Within Me Lord and that you would just bless your people and may there be something within them to to pull father on the gift father in any spirit that would try to hinder I pray that you would just drive them away father subdue it father and may we all be refreshed in you may we be drawn closer is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name amen Psalms the 23rd chapter and the first verse will start but it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul eliteth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepare us the table before me in the presence of mine enemies amen you can have your seat and um we have um been on this chapter for a while and um but I uh tonight I I wanted to look at that maybe that fifth verse he prepares a table before me in the presence of mine the enemies and of course it doesn't take much to um to know who the real enemy is and that's the devil and he's the greatest enemy and if I could say it this way he's the only enemy that that we have and if there is ever a people that Satan hates it's the children of the most time gone he is an oppressor and his presence is an evil presence his work is an evil work everything about him is evil he is the one who instills fear in people he is the one who calls his people to to go into depression he is the one who puts sickness upon us he is the one who gets us the feeling as though we are unfit for heaven is the one that gets us to thinking that God doesn't love us and that we've crossed the line of mercy and he's one that gets us to thinking all kinds of things he is he he's one that tries to get us distracted from the promises of God and every negative thought comes from the devil there's no negativity in Christianity that's what the prophet told us and so everything about God is is uh uh positive so so anything that is negative comes from the devil and he's not just a thought he's a real being he is is is uh demons his angels are real angels and so uh um his presence is real and he is our enemy so he's a real enemy that we're we're up against today there is so much ungodliness in the world we're living in an age to where there is no respect for the word of God or for the people of God they make fun of God they make fun of his elect and we're finding that laws are being passed today uh um uh rapidly and that is trying to restrict the the religious freedom of of sons of God and and it's a Godless age uh everything and and and sad to say but churches are even becoming Godless and and so uh we're seeing all of this around us and and uh and and but it's not all dark it's not all dark because David said I I walk through the valley of the shadow of of of death and um so then we're walking in the shadow of the valley of death and and as we we've talked that that uh if there's a shadow then it's not all dark because it takes it takes light and it takes Darkness to make a Shadow ain't that rhyme and so Satan's presence Satan is the power of Darkness he's the ruler of darkness and all of these things but David would tell us yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me ain't that right amen so then we're uh uh the one that is with us our shepherd He is the light for the Bible says God is light and in him there is no Darkness this ain't that rain and so because he is with us then it cannot be all dark now now it it doesn't it doesn't say that doesn't go to save that uh uh there's a lot of Darkness because we're seeing Darkness on every hand we're seeing the the dark uh uh the dark works of the enemy we're seeing the dark presence of the enemy we're we're seeing it all it's it's all around us but we do not fear about that because we realize that he Our Shepherd is with us and he is light so we're not just in the presence of our enemy but we are also in the presence of Our Shepherd ain't that rhyme a man and in his hand a man uh is his rod and staff by which we are comforted and we talked about this the the the the past few uh times we've dealt with this chapter but for David says thy rod and thy staff they comfort me and we know it's a rod of Deliverance it's a rod of protection it it has power over the enemy and and it keeps him at Bay ain't that rhyme amen and I'm so glad for that but it's also a rod of Correction a man uh uh he corrects us when we stray we are his sheep ain't that right and he deals with us uh differently than he would anyone else there's there's the Bible talks about that uh uh he he has turned men over uh to a reprobate mind to do at what they will and we're seeing that uh all over but but when it comes to his sheep he's got a rot and and that Rod is a rod of correction that keeps us and and uh in the past ain't that right and and so the the Bible says here in Hebrews 12 and 6 whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and Scourge us every son whom he receiveth and if you endure chastening then God deal is with you as with sons saying that right and so we as his sons are comforted by his correction amen and and the prophet says that his correction lets us know that he's with us a man to think of it that we we want his correction because if we don't have his correction then we don't know that his presence is with us amen there are sometimes that way people are led by Sensations they're led to well I feel to do this and I feel led to do this and they'll go by a dream or they'll go by a vision or they'll go buy a prophecy or they'll go by and they'll put their whole life based upon that they'll they'll they'll act upon all of that based upon a dream dream or or whatever and it could be totally contradictory to the word of God and they'll call that God Amen but but we find out that we know him by his presence with us by his correction that he doesn't allow us to do what we want to do all the time can you say man he keeps us in his word and and and corrects us and so that's his love to us as the shepherd uh over his sheep ain't that right and you know what brother Brown said the rod is the heart preaching gospel but it's a comfort to let me know that God is speaking to me when that type of gospels being preached to correct me it shows he loves me ain't that right he wants me to come and walk with him now amen he will walk with me in that hour I walk with him he walks with me ain't that right amen but see we meet his correction because we don't know the way we don't know exactly we're just learning our enemy you understand that church he is so deceptive and and and and and even in religious form a man that if we don't have God's correction Upon Our Lives a man we would be devired by the enemy amen that's right a man Hebrews 12 8 says if you be without chastisement then where of all are partakers in other words if you refuse to be corrected by the Shepherd in and and and reject his his correction his chastisement then your bastards and not Sons ain't that right a man so the proof of a son is one that can take the correction of the word of God Amen but then we find a man here in our scripture reading a man that he Paris a table before me in the presence of my enemies now one might think that is strange that David would put this in there he's talking about being the the Lord being Our Shepherd and we being his sheep and and and and the Lord Our Shepherd guiding us he's leading us and we went through all of these things but now David is saying that now he prepares a table before me in the presence of our enemy and and we find that it's not strange when we consider the context of the whole chapter the chapter is speaking of redemption restoration it's speaking of protection of Deliverance it tells uh uh constantly uh tells us of the shepherd's constant care for his sheep he leads them to a place of life he leads them to where they're at rest ain't that right they have peace for he leads them beside the Still Waters it's it's not a a Troublesome water uh a swift water uh uh a real strong current that's going to take everything out but it's a a steel water amen it's it's a place of rest it's a place of Peace it's a place of Life can you say man amen that's right see and then David would say he restoreth my soul so it's it's talking of redemption of restoration and and then you've got the shepherd with his staff where he ain't going to let the enemy just come in and do what he wants to with this sin and and the enemies at intent is to destroy us and and and and to totally devour us but the shepherd stands there with that Rod a power amen and won't let him do it ain't that right but now there's a table now David isn't speaking of the Millennium a man uh uh we're saying is bound and we're walking on the ashes of the wicked amen for that's what's going to take place in in in the uh Millennium but he is speaking of now present tense when the enemy is right there a man for he says he prepares a table in the presence of mine enemy in the time that the enemy is on the Rampage and darkness is all around in a time where Satan is walking about like a roaring lion in a time where Satan is resisting God's sin and fighting us on every hand and yet it's in that time that God prepares a table a man before us in the presence of our enemy now we know that there is going to be a table at the Millennium it's it's going to be a thousands of thousands of miles long and I I can't even imagine what that table is going to be and and but yet everyone that sits at that table is going to be those that have overcome the world and the things of the world and they're going to sit at that table for the wedding supper the Bible talks about it that that it'll be at the wedding supper and this that the prophet of God says that this this great table is going to be stretched across the canopies from eternity to Eternity and the redeemed of all ages a man will be sitting at that table amen and and who's them that's going to be sitting there but men and women and children that are battle scarred and they're they're going to be veterans amen and and you young people you're going to be in that number as well amen because see I've got my own eye problems and and challenges and and and all of this of all ages have got our own challenges that you're you're meeting the devil every day you'll meet them at school you'll meet them on the job you'll meet them at the store you'll meet them you'll meet him everywhere that rap amen and say that he even even children of 8 and 10 years old are are fighting their battle Satan is no respecter of persons amen but there is going to be a people of all ages that will be at that table that will have overcome that that enemy ain't that right and I'm so glad for that a man say and and and and we're going to look across the table at one another amen and and and there's going to be something that's going to be in common because a man they will be just like us that have overcome amen the world we'll see Paul there but he overcome the world and we'll see the the Saints of old they had overcome the world then and there ain't going to be no skeptic there there ain't going to be no deadhead there there ain't going to be no make-believer there there ain't going to be those that have just played around with Christianity that there's going to be real true soldiers amen that'll stand there that are overcome they had to stand alone they had to stand in faith they had to deny it all amen they had to leave their friends they had to forsake their family they had to forsaken all but they'll be there on that day at that table amen that's right and everyone that is going to be there is going to have everything in common amen there'll be no imminental City to deal with there will be no jealousy no envy and no make-believers it'll be nothing but true genuine believers who took God at his word over everything else ain't that rhyme a man and brother Branham uh uh he said this he says no doubt a man at this table Amen in the Millennium amen uh no doubt there will be a little tear trickle down our cheeks remembering the meanings and the times we'll remember the all that the battles will remember the Gatherings will remember the hardships will remember the things that we had to overcome and there we're going to shake one another's hands and grip it with brotherly and sisterly love and then that great king will come out and whip wipe all the tears from our eyes and say don't cry children it's all over enter into the joys of the Lord that's been prepared for you since the foundation of the world aren't you aren't you looking for that time amen there at that table amen and and while he is drying our tears amen the Great Tribulation is taking place amen and and those that have let were left behind and didn't make it in that Rapture a man that had just played church and just played around and refused to move on into the things of God Amen they're the one that's going to be left here and the Bible says there will be weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth ain't that right and and to think of that there will be nobody to comfort their tears wipe their tears there'll be nothing there to comfort them there'll be nothing there to a man to encourage them you know to keep moving on or whatever but it's on that end or at that table amen where he will wipe away our tears ain't that right and at that place there will be no enemy there Amen to bother us we'll be alone in the presence of our King who is now our Shepherd ain't that rhyme amen and those that will be left behind will be in the presence of Satan amen alone amen and he will have his way with him in whatever way imaginable ain't that rhyme a man but see we're talking about a table that God prepares in the presence of our enemy now there's several things that that this implies that maybe I'd like to just talk about for a few moments amen first of all a table being prepared a man is a sign of Welcome Amen brother Branham called it a the welcome table and and to welcome is to greet Hospitality uh hospitably whatever with courtesy to accept with pleasure to receive gladly into one's presence or companionship received with gladness or Delight amen so this is the type of table that the Lord Our Shepherd prepares before us in the presence of our enemy amen it's a welcoming table a man and and how uh uh it's a stark contrast a man in in the way that our enemy uh is toward us and and acts toward us and thinks about us and all of these things but also uh this this prepared table is the sign of peace a man it's a sign of peace and and in other words we're no longer an enemy to God a man and he's prepared a table to welcome us and it's a sign of peace I I looked at at second Samuel nine and one and I'm just going to uh uh read a few verses here but it says and David said is there any yet any that is left of the House of Saul that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake and there was of the House of Saul a servant whose name was ziba and and when they had called him unto David the king and said unto him our thoughts and he said thy servant is he and the King said is there not yet any of the House of Saul that I may show the kindness of God unto him and ziba said unto the king Jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet and the King said unto him where is he and zebra said unto the king behold he is in the house of of so and so there makira uh the son of amio in lodibar whatever I don't know if I'm correcting or sound uh pronouncing that correct but then King David sent and fetched him out of the house of Mercure the son of amuel from lodibar and now when uh meth uh meth this uh when the son of Jonathan the son of Saul was coming to David he fell on his face and did reverence and David said unto him uh uh uh called him by name and he answered Behold thy servant and David said unto him fear not now think of that here was Dave here was this this man uh with a long name and uh uh he he comes from David the house of David's enemy and now he's afraid David is a king and by All rights he he could have slayed this man he could have uh done whatever but David now looking at him and saying fear not everybody say fear not for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake and notice I will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually now David was doing everything that he knew to do to show unto this man that I'm not your enemy I'm your friend and you say man and to prove that you're my friend or that I'm your friend and not your enemy you're welcome to come and eat at my table you're going to eat at my table I'm going to make a place for you at my table and you'll eat there continually and I'm going to restore ain't that right well is that not what Our Shepherd has done for David's already said he restoreth my soul amen and now he prepares the table and the Lord is showing that you're not my enemy I am not your enemy amen I understand that the presence of the enemy is all around but my presence is that you're feeling is not the presence of an enemy that I am your Shepherd can you say amen and to show this see amen so therefore David is letting this man know that he has nothing to fear and I'm here to tell you that the Lord has spread the table Amen to let us know that we have nothing to fear it's your enemy that is telling you you're unloved it's your enemy that is telling you you ain't going to make it it's your enemy but the Lord has prepared a table before us to show us it's not him putting him thoughts in your mind it's not him saying that you're not loved it's not him saying that heaven is not for you it's not him telling you that the promises are not for you that's the enemy for he hath prepared a table David's not out to destroy him and you say Amen this man may have had a lot of enemies being kin to Saul but David was not one of them ain't that right so the Lord showing he's not our enemy by preparing the table Ephesians 1 and 4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love church when did he do it when you got saved at an altar when did he choose you before the foundation of the world how do we know that he's prepared a table having predestinated us right well for one he says uh uh chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy everybody say I should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us me you and do the adoption of children by Jesus Christ can you say Amen how did was he forced to do it that's not what Paul says according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved church is not your enemy can you say Amen he's actually gone and taken steps to make you accept it in his sight in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace no demands not nothing to demand that he did it it's according to the riches of his grace man now My Real Enemy your real enemy is Satan and he's the accuser of the brethren right so could you imagine what this scripture really means the he the Lord prepareth the table before me in the presence of my enemy the enemy's our accuser the the accusers there telling the Lord everything about us and by legal standpoint he's right by moral standpoint he's right we are no good we are worthless but something causes the shepherd not to look at that and he still prepares the table and he doesn't prepare the table in a secret place he prepares the table right in the presence of our enemy [Music] amen so he prepareth a welcome table in the presence of our accuser so again that feeling of rejection isn't coming from God is coming from your enemy you realize your enemy despises you he hates the righteous things you stand for he is out to destroy you he does not want you to exist now now Satan as we can see Satan can barely tolerate the fact that we're living and breathing in this physical body and he's destroying he's calling people to commit suicide he's he's people are getting more weaker dying more faster it's it's it's it's incredible but but Satan hates life period but the fact that there is a eternal life within you he hates that he despises it more than your natural life ain't that right so he's out to destroy you out to to to to to to make you lifeless and and these things and and he's the one that is constantly again telling us that that we we're without Mercy we've crossed the line and in the middle of all of this accusation in the middle of all this negativity God prepares the table a welcome table so it's him telling you that everything that the devil has told you is a flat lie every negative thought that the devil puts in your mind it's a flat lie for he hath prepared a table [Music] another thing about this table is he prepares the table because he wants to Fellowship he wants to fellowship with me I so he's not just wanting to be my leader we've had presidents that I've never met never will I'm sure I'll never have an intimate Fellowship and know him as a friend and that's not because of maybe political differences it's just he probably don't even he don't know I exist unless the IRS tells him and but see there's no relationship and yet he's my president I call him my president out of respect we follow the laws of the land but but her Shepherd is not just as our president he prepares the table for me to come and he wants to know me and he wants me to know him he wants to sit down and and talk it over amen it's one thing just for me to be a Christian and and treat God as as I would a president well I respect him he's God he's all powerful all that but I don't know him and then I live life as though he don't know me [Music] it's not the way God wants it he takes the initiative to prepare a conference table the prophet would call it a conference table it's not just a welcoming table it's a conference table you see man was born to Fellowship and it's because God wanted Fellowship it's not because you just desired to Fellowship it's it's God the Creator he had a reason for creating you had a reason for creating mankind if he wanted just to create he created the draft he created the hippopotamus secrete he ever realized that he's made so many different species of fish and we don't even know about we're just still discovering these these creatures and that one looks alike not one's the same shape not not one and and he does it just to do it so if he made man just for creation well he could have done anything like that but he didn't just make us for just to create and say look I mean they they say there's not a thumbprint not one of us has the same thumbprint now only god with his wisdom and his imagine whatever you want to call it imagination creativity or whatever can can make billions and billions of people without a a same thumbprint I don't know how they know this but but but they say that the snowflake never is the same that's right I don't understand that I don't know who keeps up a board with that one but but let's just say it is true ever just thought of it it's all these billions of snowflakes that's only going to melt but God just does it differently proves it that he just makes things different and yet it's it's who's to notice that I don't notice them things maybe some guy just bored with a telescope or microscope I don't know that he just decides to look at these things but but but but here we are things things that go so secretly by us that it had to only come from the intelligence of God he's so mighty he's so powerful that it surpasses our little old finite peanut brain and yet yet and here we are just on a little called the sack of of the space there's other Earths there's other stars and Suns and all that that we don't even know about the sun is is huge compared to so much huge compared to the Earth they say the Earth is like a quarter to the Sun and yet God would choose to put man on the Sun or on the Earth for fellowship with him that's what blows my mind he prepared a table amen for insignificant me not only to let me know that Satan is nothing to him all of his accusations be nothing to God he still welcomes me all right but also to have fellowship with me that I may know him and he would know me can you say man he wanted to have Fellowship brother Branham said see that's the Crave that's the reason it's a Crave in your heart it's a longing for something for a contact it's not just something by your personality it's something that God made now Satan just tries he's perverted that he's perverted all of that to where we want to we we don't want God we want something else and we're longing for something that's what drives people to drink and sex and and all that and yet it's never satisfying they just miserable people are miserable it's because God made man for fellowship with him in the Garden of Eden God would come down and fellowship with this company of men and women every evening and he would Fellowship think of that in the evening time the prophet said in the call of the evening God would come down under the big palm trees perhaps his sacred light that Pillar of Fire as it was and Shining down on Adam and Eve in that great cathedral in the opening see it was just fellowship with God had nothing to worry about as long as they were fellowshipping so you see what this table means in the presence of our enemy the greatest Fellowship that man could have any man could have is with Christ and so here he is he's preparing this table table I looked it up table in one place it's on which food is placed an eating place it's a banquet a feast and the prophet would tell us eating goes with Fellowship I think that's significant eating goes with Fellowship it's not just an empty table he's not just putting a table then you come up there and then but he's now he's going to make you comfortable and he prepares the table and he puts the food he puts the the wine he won't say it that way right King always has wine and and at his table and and so we we find that that you know the Bible tells us that enclosing of Jesus's life here upon the Earth that he wanted a little time of fellowship with with his disciples so he called them apart and set a table and broke the bread and blessed it and they ate and they and they they drank the wine he blessed the wine and they drank it and it was a longing in his heart just to talk with his disciples just before you go back to God the home to to to be the high priest just one of that that that place fellowship with him so he'd prepare a table in a room the fellowship and the prophet of God says the Holy Spirit then likes to eat and fellowship with the believer you believe that he likes to Fellowship he likes to eat with you what a time we're all gathered around the great table now see where the good things of God is just piled up and I'm talking of a literal table now but but see it's it's just symbolic of something God's got in his bounties of blessings everything everybody say everything everything that you have need of everything on this table he's prepared everything you have need of brother Bill yeah the presence of your enemy think of what Satan does he wants to Devour the Bible says he seeks to kill steal and destroy divide I mean you know reading about the church ages and what the prophet says about the church ages and and these things and about Satan has come in and he stole the joy he stole the he stole the fellowship he stole the peace he's he's taken he's destroyed everything remember the prophet Joel uh talks about it you know how he would the canker worm the Palmer worm the caterpillar and and and and and we find it's it's the four stages of the same insect it's just that evil devil and he's taken life from the church he's taken the doctrine from the church he's taken everything the gifts from the church he's taken it all to where we're just an empty shell but God promised I will restore saith the Lord everything that we needed God has provided at this table everything that we have need of all the vitamins everything that we have need of to make us fully sturdy healthy Christians filled with the spirit washed in his blood and what a time that we can Fellowship you see by Nature there's there's certain type of food that calls for a certain kind of Fellowship you ever thought of that by Nature you study in nature there are certain kinds of food that calls for certain kinds of Fellowship it's just you know we heard of the old saying many times birds of a feather flock together so let's look at just the bird life you don't see the dove and the scavenger that old crow fellowshipping together why their diets are different is that right that old scavenger he'll eat off of anything he can he can hop from this and hop from that and hop from that reminds me a lot of church hoppers they just go from place to place to place and they can eat off of anything no discernment no nothing it's just whatever go floats the boat ain't that right see prophesied her old crow can sit on a dead rotten carcass and eat but if that Dove ever done that it would kill her ain't that right she just can't eat it so she has to go over to the wheat field and eat the wheat she has to eat something that won't kill her and if she's if she's got a certain diet she's got to have a certain kind of discernment to know what is good and what's not ain't that right and brother Brandon talking about that Dove she Associates with her own kind talking about Fellowship amen Abraham said you have to watch them fellas that type that can sit in a meeting and pretend enjoy the meeting and go back out and take the things of the world you have to watch them they can enjoy the meetings and they have to have meetings or they can't survive [Music] they go from one meeting to another meeting into another meeting into another meeting meetings are good but they ain't giving you life you can't just live off meetings your personal experience with God is what makes you thrive feasting off of friends ain't gonna help you feasting off this word is what's going to help you getting into the message yourself is what's going to help you can you say Amen see and so therefore that Dove has got to have discernment now the crow don't need discernment he's just going to need anything that feels good that is good see but to see but you have to watch them fellas that can sit in a type of needing see and pretend to enjoy the meeting go back out and take the things of the world that's the way social Believers are today God didn't call you to be a social believer God didn't call you young people to be a social believer can you say amen he didn't call you to be that that's not how you're going to grow so he says see but we have to congregate ourselves together with those who have separated themselves from the things of the world called out and been made new creatures in Jesus Christ and fellowshipping around the blessing of the Holy Spirit ain't that right so then we find deep back by looking then at the scriptures and compared them to the day in which we live we see what Believers are to Fellowship around and what food they are to eat I hope it's all right but let's look let's look for just a few moments before we close but we we know that we're living in the time of Exodus the prophet preached the message the Third Exodus and he brings it down you go go listen to the token and he shows and he compares the time of the first Exodus to this Exodus and shows the comparison ain't that right and so we're living in a day just like the first Exodus so if we're living in the day like the first Exodus then we can be able to look at the scriptures in the first Exodus and and and see what we are to do in this Exodus ain't that right now we we find that that that that the death angel was going to strike in the land of Egypt in the first Exodus well look what we're doing we're experiencing today the death angel is striking in this hour today back then it was a natural death today is a spiritual death ain't that right but before the angel came God required them to do something first now this would be a symbol of Fellowship now another word for Fellowship is communion can you say it with me communion but the fellowship the communion had to be on a certain basis we're still talking about the table see being prepared God instructed them on what to eat God didn't just tell Moses now Moses the death thing is going to strike so now you just grab something to eat and put it on the table and then y'all just sat around the table and eat whatever have potluck that's okay you know that's not the way it was there was a divine order there was a Divine destruction instruction on the diet that they were to eat why it was time for Exodus it was time to leave can you say Amen see so thou they couldn't just Fellowship around anything ain't that right Psalms 104 27 these wait all upon thee that thou art Mass give them their meat in the season into season where it comes from God God orders that God prepares it and notice it the instructions came by a prophet through a prophet ain't that right Moses was the prophet of God led to lead the people out and God told Moses there in Exodus 12 and 3 they shall take to them every man a lamb everybody say a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house every house must have the lamb can you say Amen every house we've spent a lot of money on televisions people do all the time on movies and Xboxes and I don't know video game whatever they all got but the lamb God requires the lamb can you say man everybody just rejects the lamb these days but if you got to have the lamb it's time for Exodus ain't that Ryan she's and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb notice the requirement how the food is to be your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out of the sheep uh uh out from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it until up until the 14th day of the same month the whole assembly or and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening [Music] and they shall take of that blood of what not your neighbor the blood of the Lamb and they shall put it see up and strike it on the two side post of the door and on the upper part of the door upper door post of the house wherein wherein they shall eat it ain't that right and they shall eat the Flesh of what the cow the lamb see eat the lamb in that night the same night rose with fire fire is a symbol of the Holy Ghost don't you try to take this word on a formalism spirit it's got to be mixed with fire ain't that right roast with fire and unleavened bread no sin in it and with bitter herbs shall they eat it eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water don't you water it down but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertiness thereof ain't that right now the prophet of God says this shows what Israel did when they had Fellowship that night of of of Exodus they the time of Exodus there was a kind of Fellowship that they had to have and that was around the lamb the blood had to be around the door they had to be under the blood with the lamb can you say Amen every family of the house was to go under the blood and eat the body of the Dead sacrifice that died in their stead aren't you glad we have a something that died in our Stead see they were to Fellowship around the roasted lamb now notice he says the death's Angel could not touch them remember he couldn't touch him why because the blood of the Lamb God told Moses when I see the blood I will pass over you ain't that right the blood of the Lamb was over the door and they were in here having communion fellowshipping around the lamb that's the only that's the only kind of Fellowship that is acceptable to God he's already prepared the table you don't have to wander around for the fellowship you don't have to go to denomination for Fellowship you don't have to go out in the world for Fellowship he's prepared the table God wants to fellowship with you and you say Amen see and notice it's not a fellowship of condemnation there's blood he's put out a welcoming table now brother Brown said that's the way it is in our heart when we applied the blood of Jesus Christ taken away all sin then we can have Fellowship eating the word of God around the table of God fellowshipping upon The Godly things how do we Fellowship he says You Preach Divine Healing and every one of them cries amen that's right preach that we should lay aside all sin malice strife and things and thou whole congregation says amen what is it we're fellowshipping around the word of God amen see he says this the True Believer fellowshipping around the word see he prepared a table in the presence of our enemy in the time where where where the lid of hell is is is lifted off and demonic power is is filtrating in the world and possessing people ain't that right in the time that it would seem to consume us in the hour of the most deceptive age where it would deceive the elect Jesus said if it were possible God prepares a table think about a statement what what what a statement David is sand see man at one time had perfect fellowship with God Adam and Eve's Soul wasn't marred Adam didn't have anything to worry about when God was Fellowship one with him see everything was running smooth it was running right and all that Robert said he didn't have to worry about his clothes he didn't have to worry about what he was going to eat he didn't have to worry about sickness didn't have to worry about the sorrow and the death he didn't have to worry about all that why he was in Failure perfect fellowship with God ain't that right amen he he had freedom like a child he he was just worry free [Music] ain't that right see why he had a Heavenly Father that he fellowshipped with on a daily basis and the father watched over him ain't that right yes sir then what happened the enemy came along and marred the soul and caused a fellowship to be broken now man is defending for himself running from cover trying to you know running for cover trying to hide from the enemy but we're finding out you can't run out in the mountains too too deep and the enemy's still there because it's an it's a it's an unseen enemy it gets in your mind ain't that right but God still wanted Fellowship it didn't change the it didn't change his heart didn't change his desire so God had to come up with an agreement something an arrangement so that Fellowship could be restored again and the prophet said God found the plan and it was through the blood of an innocent victim through an innocent lamb ain't that right see Isaiah 1 18. we're going to try to hurry up now but Isaiah 1 18 it says come now let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow God found the remedy he found the remedy that you don't have to come and fellowship with God as a sinner as an old rotten no good filthy scumbag but now though your sins be a Scarlet they shall be white as snow ain't that right though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool see the prophet says when God looks through the blood of Jesus Christ amen to we who are Scarlet Red with sin and covered by the blood all he can see is us white as snow he can't see your sin he can't see how bad you are he can't see your faults against see your failure and therefore he's provided a way to make a welcome table yes he hates him yes he hates the feel for the world yes he hates what man is doing but there is an atonement for the elect that if they could get under the blood there can be a fellowship thank you you see God looking through the blood he doesn't see you as a sinner no more he sees you redeemed can you say that with me he sees me redeemed he sees me redeemed you say well I got all these faults but if you're under the blood he sees you as redeemed there is no such a thing as being saved today and lost tomorrow the Bible says that the Holy Ghost is the seal he sealed you to the day of your Redemption a seal is a finished work can you say amen amen so we're not talking about just fellowship with the God as saved today and then you know running from God as a sinner to Myra amen there's no such thing when he saved you he saved you when he called you he called you he well that's what the Bible says he Sanctified them once and for all once and for all ain't that right so now notice he said you're redeemed because he always sees you through Christ that's the reason we can be perfect not perfect in the sense of sinless we're perfect in the eyes of God when we're in Christ ain't that right so under the blood is where we have access to God ain't that right look at job under the blood fellowship with God and what did he do he had access and he interceded for his children and God answered why he had he had blood you say well but that was the blood of an animal yes it was and that blood spoke of better things ain't that right it was just a chemistry blood but that's what God required and because the Lamb of of God hadn't been slayed yet so he required the blood of an innocent lamb and when job amen killed that life it was a substitute it was showing that I should have died on this altar God but this lamb has taken my place and God accepted that and now job could have Fellowship by the dripping blood of that lamb if we could have access to God under the shed blood of an animal if job could how much more should we be able to have access to God under the blood of the Lamb of God and by the blood of the Lamb he has prepared a welcome table that we could come and have Fellowship ain't that right and notice he does it at the same time the death Angels coming ain't that right and see it's not just that God is having Fellowship not not just having fellowship with Mortal beings but God we know as the prophet taught us God dwelt Alone in the beginning before man he's eternal Gods Eternal self-existent one always been God is not a just a myth he's a person with a personality with thoughts he didn't just make this world random he didn't just create randomly he created it by thought the Bible says that he he wrote names down in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world they were in his thoughts in them name them names were his elect them names were his sons and daughters and he dwelt alone in the beginning with his thoughts but today he's not dwelling alone he'll never do that again ain't that right he'll never do that again because his thoughts those that was in his mind are now being made manifest in this age and God is fellowshipping with his thoughts being made manifest can you say amen and what are we eating we're eating the lamb aren't you glad for that yes sir dad and close and see Israel was under the blood of the natural lamb and they partook of a natural lamb they fell as shipped around a natural lamb they were brought out of Egypt by a little natural lamb to go to another Nation they had a prophet at that time they had the pillar fire leading them amen during that time and yet they murmured they complained they grabbed amen all of these things and the prophet said they'd done it to show that it was all under the blood of an ordinary lamb foreign God was showing the power of our bleeding but that was only a testament of what he was going to do in this age by his lamb that he would provide for you and I brother Bradham said see but today this election that is coming now see it's not it's just not going to another Nation it's going to Glory how many is going to Glory I'm going to Glory see you're going to Glory where their names are wrote on the Lamb's Book of Life not under the natural little animal lamb that brought Israel out and that yet they could backslide from there and go back but this can't everybody say this can't you cannot go back and backslide if you can't amen this is under the blood of the Lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world and their names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and there in their elected and when that light flashes over them like that you know them denominational walls drop away from them and here they come come out from them from among them saith the spirit in these last days thoughts not their unclean things and I'll be a God to you and you'll be my sons and daughters to me ain't that right so it's not my natural lamb a man but it's by the genuine lamb under the genuine atonement under the bloody bleeding word ain't that right oh isn't he wonderful now let's look at it Revelations 5 and 9 and they sung a new song saying the Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has what redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation aren't you glad for that by the blood of an animal no by thy own blood by God's blood has he redeemed us I think that's wonderful and notice Moses was the anointed leader under the pillar of fire and the pillar fire only Vindicated his message with signs and wonders and that Pillar of Fire LED them to the land that God had promised them to where he himself would become flesh among them but in this age this time the pillar of fire that we see Among Us the pillar of fire is leading us to a millennium where he will return to his people in that great Millennium Reign after this Exodus and we'll live eternally with him glad for that so what a table that we have today eating off the good things of God eating the word of God that Bloody bleeding word if the musicians will come Prophet said the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man the man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man see what a man is feeding on and fellowshipping with identifies as to who he is that right and those two things are going to bring a separation as to who and what associates with you feeding and fellowshipping feeding and fellowshipping can you say man and what you feed upon and what you fellowship with is your nature it tells you what the nature is hello but see he's prepared the table it's not going to get everybody to come but those that have that nature defeat off the word of God that unfailing body word they're going to come to the table and what they're going to find is they're going to find people Associates of lack precious faith people that have that same goal people that are overcoming people that are denying it all and staying with the word of God and that are resting and are drawing strength people are trying to draw strength in all kinds of things of this world but there's only one thing that can suffice us and that's the word of God can you say man do you love
