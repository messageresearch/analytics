them Father during this time of loss Lord of grief we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen Matthew the third chapter and um we're going to start at the 13th verse but it says then Jesus then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to to me and Jesus answering said unto him suffer it be to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness than he suffered him amen then if you'll turn to the Book of John the 13th chapter John the 13th chapter and uh we'll read the third and fourth verses there but the third the third verse um is really what I want to get to um but Jesus knowing everybody say Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself amen you can have your seats this evening and uh we we do want to remember communion this coming Sunday as well in the evening but um I if I have a title I I'm going to title it um understanding who we are and um we read where Jesus comes to John and um he didn't just happen to stumble onto John or just kind of wander that direction or whatever but he intentionally went to him and uh for Jesus recognized that John was a true Prophet on the earth and that the word had spoken of John and and of course the word comes to the prophets and so he knew that John was the prophet of the hour and John knew that Jesus was the Messiah of the hour and so the they had uh they both had a clear understanding of who each other was simply out of the word of God then you know the the scripture that we use often but Luke 17:28 Jesus says likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they solded they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and we we believe and know that this is a scripture that is prophetic of our day and and so therefore it it as it did for John and Jesus it requires us to have a clear understanding uh you see as as the the the prophet said that the scriptures are written so that the wise of the world will not understand and Jesus here in in Matthew 11:25 says I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou H has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes another scripture Paul there in in 1 Corinthians 2:9 it says but it as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by spirit for the spirit searcheth all things ye the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God so that that we uh that Paul is speaking of is a different class because brother brandham says that the world uh the worldly minded people will not understand but it is the spiritual minded people that understands amen and understanding is important because Daniel 12:10 it says that none of the wicked shall understand but the wise everybody say the wise the wise shall understand and and so the understanding that we were talking about is a spiritual understanding which the Bible speaks of and and and I want to just to put this uh here maybe for you young people and that is that it's it it it's being wise uh does not consist of being old um um of uh you know it doesn't consist of older people only um you know uh uh you you you you would think that men and women who are up in age uh would be the ones that were wise and then you know the younger in age would lack the wisdom but that's not true all the time uh for job 32:9 it tells us and and listen to this this scripture but it tells us that great men are not always wise and neither do the Aged understand judgment and and so we we would look at Jesus for an example that the Bible says he was filled with wisdom and yet he was only 12 years old the Bible says as a child child he was filled with wisdom and he increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man so then wisdom doesn't automatically come with with age uh uh for Paul even told the Hebrew church that the for the time that you you ought to be teachers you have need to be taught again and and so they they they they had been at a place that Paul would tell them you you should be at at a place to teach but uh uh you you're not there and and so in in Ephesians uh uh 1:16 Paul prayed that God would give unto us the spirit of wisdom and and uh so this is not that you you have to be uh you know 60 70 80 years old for this wisdom to come uh but but he says that he he prayed that he would give us the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of wisdom is none other than the spirit of truth it's the spirit of truth that Jesus promised to send in this last day and so brother Bram he would say this he said the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day that we're living in just just the same as Gabriel come to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep secret things ain't that right and so uh according to First John 5 and 20 uh he says the Son of God hath given on us an understanding that we may know him that is true so it is important that we have an understanding just as it was for John to have an understanding Amen to know of who Jesus was and for Jesus to even have an understanding as to John amen because if the word come to the prophet then Jesus had to know who he was that he was the word and that the prophet was upon Earth ain't that right he couldn't break the scriptures and go to the pope or go to some Bishop he went to a prophet ain't that right and so then John had to have this understanding well here the Son of God have given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and what and we are in him that is true ain't that right so where does this wisdom and understanding uh come from uh uh Psalms 119 uh actually tells us and it's a a pretty good uh uh uh uh chapter that we ought to to uh uh uh look at and but but but it says oh how I I love thy law and and he says it is my meditation all the day notice thou through thy Commandments which is Thy word h made me wiser than mine enemies for they are forever with me ain't that right so he kept the word of God with him at all times then 99 uh verse he says I have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies of Thy word are my meditation I understand more than the Ancients because I keep thy precepts uh of Thy word ain't that right I have refrained my feet from every evil way that I might keep thy word I have not departed from thy judgments for thou Hast taught me see how sweet are thy words unto my taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth through thy precepts Thy word I get understanding therefore I hate every false word or false way Thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light unto my path ain't that right so then it it would tell us how we get understanding and how amen we become wise and and these things and so uh this this wisdom it it it it actually it it it can come to all ages amen but it's it's again this wisdom doesn't come amen by being in movies and being in in video games and being in this and that and occupying our time out into the world and things but the wisdom comes by keeping the precepts and staying meditating upon the word of God ain't that right and and and and so so if if there is ever a a people on the Earth that has come to an understanding and who are wise it is the elect uh of today ain't that right more wise than any other people on the face of the Earth and and I'm not talking about worldly wisdom uh because that's that's what the children of the world have is that's the kind of wisdom that they have but but because the seals have been loosed and and the word has been made more clear than ever before in this age then we are a people that have a greater understanding a greater wisdom a greater knowledge as to uh uh what God has been after ain't that right so as Jesus said there in Matthew 3 or 13 and 17 verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them ain't that right see so the word spoke of John the word spoke of Jesus and and and the word that same word speaks of us today now you know and and we know these things but I pray that the Lord just really uh uh uh gets it into our our soul our being but in in Ephesians 1:23 Paul speaks of the church being the body of Jesus Christ and and the fullness of him and we've talked about you know uh uh how that the church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ and and that word mystical is is having a spiritual meaning or reality that is neither apparent to the senses or nor obvious to the intelligence amen it's involving or having the nature of an individual's direct subjective communion with God or Ultimate Reality so so we are the mystical body of Jesus Christ and and and and the relationship that the church has is is is the greater than than any other age I just believe that amen and and the the awareness of God is greater than any age because we are the body of Jesus Christ the body and so the ones who make up the body of course are the ones who've been baptized into the body by one spirit and as the prophet said it's not a water baptism it's a spirit baptism amen that puts the man into the body of Christ ain't that right and I I I I say to you that the body is the only body that God works in and lives in and is a reality amen uh uh uh in amen see so therefore we don't need his physical body we don't need that physical being to be on the earth and and how how wonderful that would have been to to to to to rub shoulders with Christ in his physical body and to sit there and to be able to talk and to communicate and and and and to shake his hand and to hear that voice and and all of that but how much greater is it than then we have it today simply because we are not just hearing his voice We Are The Voice amen for his voice is in us as it was in Jesus so it is in us and and we don't need to touch his body we are his body so the same life the same power The Same Spirit is in in US amen that was in him so so we don't need that physical body for he is and I'm not doing away with the body a man of Christ for we'll meet him in the air as the Bible says amen but I'm talking about on Earth amen but but Christ is the same in every aspect today than uh uh except the Corporal body can you say amen amen and so the purpose of his death at Calvary the prophet said was to save a sinner and produce to the church the power or the authority and the faith to do the same things that he did or to open up a heart and make a channel that himself could dwell in so that's the purpose of Calvary and if you have felt the effects of Calvary he only he he he allowed you to come into this and be for one one purpose and that is to make make you part of his body Amen to where he could have the preeminence can you say Amen so the mystical body of Jesus Christ is his own body that he himself has redeemed and therefore that makes us the channel we are the channel for God to work through we are his hands we are his eyes we are his lips we are his feet we are everything that he is we are that channel and so the same power that was manifested in that physical body of of of Christ is to be manifested in his mystical body do you believe that amen the same works that was done in his physical body is to be done through amen carried out in the mystical body amen so that God the same God and I may be repeating myself but I want to get it to us that the same God that lived in that body lives in the body today his mystical body and the body does not change the person or the personality ain't that right death doesn't change you it only changes your Dwelling Places but what you are amen here in this life you will be in that other life and so then then the the the church the Church of the Living God being the mystical body cannot change amen what God is it cannot change this person ality his nature his his power his his Essence amen it only amen reflects amen the life that is in it amen and so the body is actually under complete control absolute control of the life that is uh dwelling in it amen and so what God Was Before Time began never changed when he was manifested in the human body of Jesus Christ Christ and and so then uh today when we're looking at the body of Christ it is the only body amen where God can have complete preeminence in and operate in full ain't that right so now this testifies to me of the power of redemption and what God really done at Calvary amen see that God could take men and women who have this V um adamic nature that that it's a carnal nature Paul even says that it is not subject to the laws of God or the word of God neither can it indeed be amen it cannot be subject to that and yet he could redeem that group of people to where he could gain access in them and have complete preeminence in them amen so the m iCal body is a paradox because it is it is made up of people who were Misfits and and as the prophet would say born defeated we were born defeated but the power of redemption a and I I I think that's powerful because the Paul says I believe in Romans that we were we were Servants of sin we we were servants and I I think we could all uh vouch for that that that we were under the control of Satan and and whatever he wanted us to do we done it whether it be lying whether it be just a simple sin a a a wh lie to versus to Bad to the Bone or whatever we were all Servants of sin but we have been loosed by God's own blood to where we are free to be Servants of righteousness can you say amen and as the prophet said you know if it's perfect blood that has loosed us then it is a perfect loosening so your pardon is perfect your Redemption is perfect amen uh uh the transformation of your soul is perfect the seal that God put upon your life is a perfect seal amen it it cannot be undone so what we are is is not it's not a put on it's not something that we work ourselves into it's not something that we're imagining a ain't that right but there is a true reality to the power the blood of Jesus Christ now notice where we are today as the Church of Jesus Christ brother brandham says we believe as the church that the gospel has been just uh has has been just about completed we believe that the great Messengers Through the Ages has in these last days last several hundred years has fought for these great things the justification by faith Luther sanctification by Wesley the the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the Pentecostals we believe that those elements goals to make up the complete body amen so the body of Christ today is a complete body do you believe that it it's it's not just another phase of the body that we're in it's a completion of the body amen and and and you know uh uh 1 John 5:7 John would tell us for there are three that bear record in heaven and it's the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these trees are one and as the prophet would tell us you can't have the father without having the son you cannot have the son without having the Holy Ghost for they are one if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got the father you got the son and be because they are one and he says and there are three that bear witness in Earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these agree in one ain't that right so you can be justified without being Sanctified you can be Sanctified without having the Holy Ghost and the prophet says the Holy Ghost is the indwelling presence of Christ's power in the spirit amen see and it's dwelling in the body of Christ amen see so and another place he says the natural types the spiritual so the church everybody say the church is in its complete maturity now this is where we're at this is the understanding that we have been given the church is in its complete maturity now justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost another place he says you to see down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then it come out through the feet Luther come out and then through Wesley then into Pentecost the tongues and the lips and and now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that cuz that's the last thing there is ain't that right and he's the intelligence see so the next is the intelligence we have no intelligence of our own it's his intelligence this is where the body is this is where we're at see we're not in the foot we're not in the in in the building of the body we're in the completion of the body it's it's standing complete we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee those things he can't do it it it's God himself it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride it's revealed can you say Amen so God has built a complete church that is in His image and and as we've said that this body has been hewed it's been chopped out by the prophet of Malachi 4 it is a separate separated body from any other Church body or or any other body amen and and it's it's a body that is not been made up of Creeds and dogmas but it is a word body ain't that right it's it's not a body that is traditional in thoughts and and actions amen but it's it's a word body and every scripture concerning the church concerning the bride will be fulfilled in her and by her and through her praise the Lord and and so as the prophet said because this word body has come to its completion no man dare not must not add or take away from the word for to do so would be take away from the body ain't that right now brother brandham uh he he says in using God's word there's three things that a man must not do and I I I I think these things are important to us but we must not misinterpret the word we must not misplace the word and we must not dislocate the word he says if we do any of these things it throws the whole body in our Bible in confusion and Chaos so another place he says see to misinterpret Jes Jesus in the form of God in a man you would make him uh uh one God out of three to misinterpret Jesus Christ being the word you would make him one God out of three or you would make him the second person in a godhead and to do that you would mess up the whole scripture see You' never get nowhere so it must not be Mis interpreted if you say that a certain thing see you put an interpretation on it and you apply it to another time or it's been applied to another time you also make an incorrect interpreting amen so so I I want to apply this to our lives that no matter how insignificant that you may feel or we may look at ourselves and and think well it can never be well if you're the body of Christ every promise must be fulfilled through you as as a body so you cannot put that off to something else you have to accept it for what you are can you say amen and and so um uh another place brother Bram says Jesus himself is the interpretation of the Bible when he's made manifest in the age that the part of his body is being made manifest so if it's a hand age it must be a hand if if it's a head age see then or it can't be a head age if it's a voice age well it can't be a foot age and now we're at the I age and the next him next is him himself to come seeing prophetic can you say Amen so so we're we're we're we have this understanding as where we are as the body of Jesus Christ amen and I I pray that that understanding becomes enlightened to us amen see so EV every scripture in the Bible has the same application so you have to set it in its place the prophet said so to misplace the word he says then you might make him God of yesterday you could take it and say well yes he was God in with Samson he was God with David he was God in Christ he was God with Paul but then if you dislocate it uh or misplace it then you can take that same God Amen and make him a god of History amen you could view him as God God of yesterday but when you talk about him in this age then you can make him a god of history and that's to misplace the scriptures can you say Amen see to make him God in Christ and then not make him God in the church is to misplace the word amen to make him what Christ was he was in Christ in that day but then somehow to make God as though he doesn't do the things that he did back then is to misplace the word for the age that we're living in for Hebrews 13:8 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen see so then to dislocate the scriptures is to disfigure the body of Christ see you you would put his body together wrong ain't that right you'd have the foot where the head should be and the head where you know the knee should be or or whatever see cuz you're dislocating the body but you you we're we're not a dislocated body can you say Amen so in other words brother Bram said see you you might have Jesus teaching Moses's message or Moses teaching Noah's message but see we're living in the bright time do you believe that we're living in Bride time we're living in seed time we're we're living in adoption time we're living in a time where the bride is to speak and when she speaks it's it's God's speaking that's true the Lord you know we have we have lived in the day of the stock tsle and Shu yes and the prophet said but we're back at Sea time the Lord so it's it's not that God is planting its seed like he did on the day of Pentecost but we are the seed that has ripened or is ripening amen ain't that right so when we look at it the stock the tossle the shuck they're dead yeah amen and and that tells us that the Lutheran you know they had a Revival at one time and and now now but now they're dead and and all those that sprung from that Lutheran Revival that they sit dead today and and they the they were branches off that Revival but they're dead the wans once had a Revival but they're dead the Pentecostals once had a Revival but but they're dead and they're formal ain't that right brother brother brandham in speaking to the Pentecostal he said the Holy Spirit today is rejecting the Pentecostals and you're getting just as formal and cold as the rest of them and everybody can see that ain't that right but see where we're at today is the Revival is in the bride and it it's a bride's Revival I I don't think it's ever been called a bride's Revival except for this day but it is a bride's Revival and and and notice where the the Revival's coming from Luke 17:30 Malachi 45 and Matthew 25 Luke or Revelations 10 and 1-7 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and and on and on and on uh that these scriptures are are are bringing has brought a Revival to this bride because this is the age for it this is the time for it this is this is the the the thing we're we're not out of season we're not out of scripture amen we're we're not presenting another age this is the time that the bride is to rise up she is the Revival she becomes the Revival and up up until this time up until this age brother Bram said there's been no manifestation of God to steer the bride and and we know now that it took those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again amen and and so uh uh and the Thunders is the voices a voice of God Amen so brother Brown said if I taught you a Methodist message it would it would take no effect on you this is bright time and and so this is why we're studying the message this is why we're we're getting in and and and and we're not bringing Baptist thoughts and Pentecostal thoughts and traditions and all of these things because it will not affect the bride amen but but you see he says if if Moses taught the message of Noah it would take no effect if Jesus taught Moses message it would take no effect because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's GI for that seed can you sayen notice another place he said the supernatural being with Divine Healing and powers and workings and so forth by The Miracles of God has put the bride in a Revival that's got oil in her lamp so who is the bride the wise virgin that's got all in her lamp and the supernatural being the Divine with Divine Healing and powers and working so forth by The Miracles of God has put the bride in a Revival prise the Lord ain't that right that's good now if you notice you know uh Jesus said as it was in the days of lot and something that that I you know it it could become uh common to us that that are in the message but to to Really to to to see of the understanding that God has given us at the world has no understanding of and and and that is about you know brother Brown talks about the Three Angels that appeared two went down to Sodom and preached to the sodomites and blinded them but one State uh uh one of that third messenger stayed behind with Abraham the elected group and and there's one thing that that happened that the world fails to recognize I think most people you know religious in Evangelical can say that we're living in the days of Sodom and and Gomorrah and the days of lot but but you know the thing that they failed to recognize and that was the last sign given to Abraham where God manifested in human flesh and told what Sarah was thinking in the tent behind him ain't that right and that was the last sign that was given to Abraham and of course Abraham was the type of this last day people who would go in a Rapture amen and and brother briam said see it was not Jesus that was speaking to Abraham for he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the almighty God the self-existent one ain't that right now we we we we know uh that he later on become Jesus uh in in flesh amen but what Abraham was uh uh talking to was God Almighty in a theophany ain't that right a word body amen as a man that's right almighty God and and Paul would even tell us there in Hebrews 7 And1 for this MDC king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father Jesus had a you know father without mother can you say man without descent having neither beginning of days Jesus had beginning of days without ending of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually ain't that right see so so we look and and then when God came came into Christ for the Bible says God was in Christ reconciling the world he performed the very same sign that he did in the body of MDC amen uh in in a to Abraham but then he promised that that same thing would happen again in this day ain't that right and if you notice because now I think this is um you know uh significant to you and I as the bride but it this sign would be what Jesus would call a resurrection sign it would be a a resurrection sign that Jesus has not been replaced but he has risen from the dead ain't that right it's a sign that God is here the same Jesus Christ is here today amen and and and Jesus would tell us there in Matthew 12 and and you know uh uh 38 then then C certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign brother Braham said now he's speaking prophetic of this age and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for uh for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth ain't that right amen see and and so uh uh he's prophesying of this generation and and again it fits with Luke 17:30 as it was in the days of lot so shall it be when the son of man is revealed can you say amen and and what is it the sign of the Resurrection will be the same sign that was performed in the days of lot to that elect amen and brother said that same spirit that was represented in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim is to be revealed again in human flesh do you believe that Amen in human flesh another place Elohim will return back to the Roy Seed of Abraham and show that same thing that he showed in that day Elohim as it was why it will be the characteristics of God it will be it will be the characteristics so this is what brother bram's Ministry was was the characteristics of God manifested showing that God is able to get preeminence in a bride yes three Messengers have come in this day brother brandom identified him as old Roberts and Billy Graham going to the denominations sodomites Pentecostals and whatever they preached repentance they blinded the eyes of the people spiritually but the third messenger has stayed with the elect and if there wasn't a word for that to happen again for our day then we we would we would no have no reason to believe in it but we believe solemnly in in in in in God's messenger for this age amen because we believe it was more than just a man that came to us that Pillar of Fire was God so MDC right same Jesus Christ and so we have been given the same sign which has revealed amen the son of man and and notice now what is the revealing of the son of man to do notice what brother Brown said to join the church to the head to unite the marriage of the Bride you see where we're at see what's happening this message is uniting us with Jesus Christ amen it's a marriage it's not a Reformation it's a marriage can you say Amen am see and he says the bridegroom call will come through this what the message the message is the bridegroom call the revealing of the son of man is the bridegroom call can you say Amen the shout is the bridegroom call Revelations 10:1 the mighty Angels crying out with a loud voice with the book in his hand is the bridegroom call it it's a bridegroom call this message is the bridegroom calling his elect and how do we know it's him how do we know it's it's really the bridegroom because he performed the Messiah sign that's good ain't that right see and he's come down in human flesh or he says see the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word can you say that the church has to be the word word let's make it personal I have to be the word I have to be the word see just as John was the word and just as Jesus was the word amen they they fulfilled the word for their day and they had an understanding of who they were they even asked John are you that one he says no but I am that voice of one crying in the wilderness he took him to the word and showed that his ministry was the word well cannot we do the same thing in this age you bet we can we're not believing this message and just not knowing what we're believing we know what we're believing we know what it's doing to us yes sir it's more than just an excitement it's more than just an emotion it's scriptures being fulfilled I know they lay this emotion and all that's getting excited and all that because we get excited amen we are totally different than what the Pentecostals were you realize our shouting and our screaming and our dancing and our I mean our joy is scripture being fulfilled had nothing to do with about working up emotions and all we don't have to have music to get excited just preach the word word can you say Amen see the church has to be the word he is the word and the two everybody say the two see the church and him the church the word he the word unites together notice and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man thank God for a message thank God for what he's done in this age for it would take the revealing of the son of man to unite the church and him together yes sir not a clergyman he said I don't know do you see what I mean it's son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen can I say it ask you this is it becoming so real to you Lord amen that's that's what the message is about come on yes sir I see and and and and so it's so real that unite the church in him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper she's already united we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage see he says fill your flesh see self of all the Flesh of Mighty Men call The Marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the the word here unites with the person and they Two Become One amen that's what that that's what that picture shows is God had become United with flesh again God become United now that same Pillar of Fire is over this elect or in this church I believe that I I I believe that it's with the bride of Jesus Christ I believe didn't you say amen God so he says they two become one and then what does it do it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians God never intended us to be a church the loan amen he never intended us to be just church members amen it manifests son of man again not Church Theologian son of man the word and the church becomes one you love him the the the word and the church becomes one see Lord whatever the son of man done he was the word the church everybody say the church that's me does the same thing the church praise the Lord so what is this what what what is the understanding it's it's the mystery made known Christ in you the hope of glory now brother Brown says now the church has the church now has served the term through the church age in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but Jesus said here to make Malachi 4 and the rest of these scriptures real to you see that in the last days just before the coming the world setting will be like the Sodom and the son of man and is not or we not in the setting of Sodom and Gomorrah absolutely we're we're in that setting and it's getting worse and worse absolutely see and and just before the coming the world be setting like Sodom and the son of man will reveal himself as the son of man like he did in the days of Sodom he said blind pers prosecutor can't you see that his words are true not nail scars and prins and Thorns it's the Son of God impersonated in his church as son of man it has to fulfill Malachi for and the rest of the scriptures can you say amen and he says see so he says I called to the Court's attention look at that real good son of man like like God the Father God the son God the Holy Ghost the same God three different attributes of the same God now this is the son of David son of man revealed then as a prophet son of David the king and now the son of God to the church age as God isn't man God is a spirit and the spirit son is the Holy Ghost which is revealing the church age so God was son of man Son of God through the church ages as Spirit but promised here in the last days that the son of man would be revealed God would become flesh a God would become flesh aren't you glad for that never a day has anyone f fulfilled all scriptures of this bride but you sit here tonight because God called you and by the the the revealing of the son of man and the ministry of the son of man God has now been able to take preeminence in US headship ain't that right that's right and so he says see he said blind Pro prosecutor do you get that I want you to know blind prosecutor we see it we believe it these words fulfilled before us and we know that they are true amen so then we go to the scripture that we know use quite often John 1419 yet a little while the world seeth me no more they have no understanding of him but you see me amen because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I'm in the father and ye in me and I in you all right can you say amen amen amen I love the Lord amen John 14:12 verily verily I say unto you Jesus says he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also greater than the shall he do because I go to my father think of that the greater has been promised to you amen ain't that right now brother brandom here he says now God has identified the resurrection of his son from the dead he's identified this Resurrection by given the church the same characteristics that he had making Hebrews 138 exactly right no wonder they can't convince us that God is dead they'll never be able to convince us that Jesus Christ is just nothing but historic no no no he's given us the sign of Resurrection amen identified the resurrection by giving the church the same characteristics that he had oh do you love him Hebrews 1 and one and I'll wind it down but God who had SU by times and in diverse manner spake in times P unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds notice he here he is Among Us the prophet said after 2,000 years the same Jesus not one of the prophets this is the ministry that of of brother brandham that is to me so powerful because it's not just another Ministry of one of the prophets but it's actually the ministry of Jesus Christ raised from the dead can you say Amen Lord the same Ministry that Jesus had is the same Ministry that the Bride of Jesus Christ has today and this is why Mark 11 is so personal to to us and it should be it's the only time that the scripture has been made known or or unfolded to really what Jesus was saying was in this day but I'm going to read it as we close but Mark 11:11 and Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple when he had looked around about upon all things and now the evening tide was come and he went out unto Bethany with the 12 and on the marrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and Jesus and seeing a fig tree a far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee uh Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it and they come to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple and began to cast them out that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sowed doves and I'm going to go on down to the 19th verse and when even was come he went out of the city and in the morning they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance Sith unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou cursed is withered away and Jesus answering and said unto them have faith God I like that have faith of God he's talking to a body he's talking to a group of people that's going to be his body one day right and they would possess the very same faith that he had they would possess the same because it'd be the same God living in him that would live in them so have faith in God or have the faith of God for verily I say to you that whosoever shall say un this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have everybody say he shall have whatsoever he saith he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them ain't that right so what we are I I think this is uh we are the channel as his body we are the channel for the word to come we're the channel now brother brandom I'm going to read this uh but he says now if we could throw ourself completely to God and to his will and be lost to our own thoughts and just let the mind of Christ be in US them same operations of the spirit would work through us just as the Natural Things does just the same thing because we were first created for that purpose to control to rule and to praise God and to live for God that's what you were made for that's what the that's the reason you were created was to rule to control and to praise God and to serve God that's what we were made for now Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be given to you if you abide in me and my word in you now the father and his word is inseparable because the word is his son in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and God and His word is inseparable you cannot have god without having his word and when you have his word you have God prise the Lord and if you notice we're coming back to word made flesh again if you want to go back a little further just as far as historical you could see the word in the beginning was the word but what is the word a word is a thought manifested a thought spoken forth God first he perceived the thought and spoke it and it and and it become a word and the word become material so everything that God has spoke in his word received into the right channel will materialize that word for whatever the promise behind it is God will do it he's obligated amen be the channel that the word can come through can you say Amen bless name so then if you abide in me and my word abide in you and other words you're that channel see then you have God the word in you yes and you believe the word just as you believe God because it is God and it's Inseparable then if you have God's word in you you have God's life in you you have God in you and whatever God's word speaks forth out of [Music] you it'll have to come to pass just like it was spoke from God think about it praise the Lord isn't that awesome yes it is true Jesus said whatsoever you ask the father in my name I'll do it did you ever realize what that means do you realize that if we go before God In The Name of Jesus it's just the same as Jesus himself praying it isn't me praying anymore if I come in his name he recognizes his name and Jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name that I do right is that a promise sure it is then I go to the father in jesus' name it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus it's his Spirit praying through meise Lord that I've got to receive what I asked for because he said it and it's God's Own word it can't do nothing else but produce just what it said amen ain't that right right amen so then we believe see then this is the confidence that we have in God that we get what we ask for for he's God and cannot take back his word he's got to stay with his word if the musicians will come stay with his word so he says then if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it'll be given unto you isn't that simple Faith created see we was made for that purpose I hope you understand tonight you were not made to be defeated amen you were not made to go down in defeat you were not made for hell you were not made for the tribulation you were not made you were made to rule to control to praise God and to live for God that's what you were made for amen I believe ain't that right and so this is what the message is doing is what God has done through the message of the hour is to bring you back to Sons and Daughters of God that's right it had to take the seven unnown Thunders to wake us up yes right to bring us back into our right position as Sons and Daughters of God the way we were created to so all the challenges that you face is not to bring you down it's for you to rule to control and to praise God in that's good ain't that right yes sir so see he says see isn't that simple Faith created we was made for that purpose then through the fall why we was taken away from that and then in Redemption we was brought back to it again we talk about the seals we talk about the Redemption claims remp claims what's it for to bring us back into Sons and Daughters of God again amen the only thing that hindered the human race today from being Superior and controlling like they did in the beginning is because that the power lines of the outlet of God made in the human being has been clogged up and he said sometimes the all Theology and church doctrines have clogged up your faith line clogged up your lines till you have been taught that those things can't be and that puts a block in the way see that's That's what Satan has done through doctrines of men and Theology and all that stuff but he said could you imagine this building here being energized tonight for light by the electricity the electricity is an unseen Force when it's harnessed and brought on when Benjamin FR Franklin first found it he screamed I've got it yet he didn't know what he had he had something but Along come Edison and put it to work and today we can send a wireless program from right this place here to anywhere around the world by Wireless telegram see and look everything else that we got today right see it's an unseen force that moves it through space that no man can catch it only Machinery can catch it because it's too fast for the eye but yet there's a force that there's telegrams coming right through this room right now he said now if the law natural laws of God which is electricity and things once handed in the right capacity can do those things how much more could the power of the Holy Ghost once passing through to the human heart by faith what it could do we're enjoying what man has been able to accomplish with the electricity but what can God accomplish through us the power of God flowing through us get all the clogs out of the way may we have an understanding today tonight of what God is really called us to do and where we're standing today can you say Amen might have been fine one day just to come to church and en join a church Church it might have been fine because that's all the light they had they had the only light they had was you know that Jesus was savior you know and I think that's the way brother brandham said it you know and and things like that but that's all the light they had but our understanding has been so increased in this age to know that the word will work for us if we'll just be the conductor for we are the body don't look to something else don't look for someone else look at yourself God has put you on this Earth and has brought you in to be part of this body for the word to flow through you take your lips take your eyes Take Your Vessel and let the word flow through can you say Amen oh do you love the Lord so he says see God has not promised us electricity only just might have set them free but look what the Holy Spirit has promised to the believer today then we look back and see that God put electricity here for a certain thing and science is moving into the field of science and bringing it out but we as Christians we become too clogged up we just can't understand we think about well the doctor said I can't get well and as long as you think that then you're not thinking God's thoughts see you can't do it see if you say well I'm going to die the doctor said I was going to die well all regards to the doctor that's the best of his knowledge if he said you're going to die see humanly speaking well I believe the same thing but by the word word I can't believe it he's right in what he's saying humanly speaking but there is a word that if that word can have preeminence and we become the channel of not what the doctor says better channel for what God says we won't believe what that doctor says ain't that right amen you love the Lord love the Lord so he said if you was going to die he say but by the word I can't believe it that's right because he promised me that whatever I asked the father in his name would be granted and I believe that's the truth now if God could just clear that little Channel out and run that energy out to that place then something going to happen then you don't have to fear cancer you don't have to fear arthritis you don't have to fear what the devil's trying to put on you and your family and and everything else just be the channel for God to flow through have that understanding of who we are in Christ amen amen amen what oh in your presence where I belong in your presence oh Lord my God in your presence that's where I belong all seeking your face touching your grace in the cleff of the Rock in your presence oh god well I want to go where the rivers cannot overflow me where my feet are on the Rock and I want to hide

to uh I think they're going to try to put a cast on uh Monday and uh but he just in so much pain all he can do is lay around and that's what the doctor told him to do is lay around and so and Steve's not that kind of a person just to lay around so it's been a little rough on him and uh tried to tried to get up and he fa yesterday and and um and so caused him put pressure on that foot so he' been in a lot of pain so we want to keep him in our prayer keep Sister Kim in our prayer and that God will just help him and help her amen and so lot to pray about in there but we certainly know a God Amen
