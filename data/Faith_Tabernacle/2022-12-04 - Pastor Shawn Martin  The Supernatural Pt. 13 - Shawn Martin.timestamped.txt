[41:05] Bible says that men would become lovers
[41:07] of pleasure lovers of their own selves
[41:10] more than lovers of God
[41:13] and it shows that they've kicked him out
[41:17] and uh because I once you you really
[41:20] have that relationship with Christ
[41:23] uh you you just put yourself on the back
[41:25] burner and
[41:27] you put the world on the back burner and
[41:30] uh you just don't have them desires
[41:32] because he becomes the main focus he he
[41:36] has the main preeminence
[41:38] a man and uh but I'm so glad that there
[41:42] are a people that love the Lord
[41:45] and that are walking with him and and

[42:12] everyone and we just missed those that
[42:15] everyone and just uh whether you have to
[42:18] work or not able to make it for some
[42:21] reason

[42:27] man when you're not here and we want to

[42:56] at Faith Tabernacle
[42:58] that God has sent to us to help me amen
[43:04] labor in the gospel and um
[43:07] these men are a constant support
[43:11] to me and
[43:14] um and I'm I'm glad that we can work
[43:16] together in the Lord
[43:19] and uh you know everyone's got their
[43:22] different gift their gift different
[43:24] style
[43:25] and um and different approach you know
[43:30] there's we we all have a uh maybe a
[43:33] different approach to things it's kind
[43:36] of like climbing a mountain I I may come
[43:39] up on one side of the mountain and uh
[43:41] you know uh brother Amos may come up on
[43:45] another side of the mountain and brother
[43:47] Terry another side and we're approaching
[43:50] maybe the subject it uh in a different
[43:54] way and yet we're all coming to this the
[43:57] top and the same point and
[44:01] um I I just uh I'm so glad that God's
[44:05] got a variety
[44:07] and we always strive to to arrive at the
[44:12] same at the top at the same place and uh
[44:17] so I just thank the Lord and uh it's
[44:21] just we all got different
[44:23] um as as even as a group uh different
[44:27] personalities different ways of of
[44:29] looking at things and um and but yet
[44:34] it's it's something that is good it's
[44:37] it's good and and because we all love
[44:40] the Lord and as long as we're staying in
[44:44] scripture as long as we're following the
[44:46] message of the hour then that's what we
[44:48] want amen
[44:50] and so uh here in the book of Ephesians
[44:55] um we've been reading this and so I'm
[44:58] just going to
[45:00] um
[45:02] um just start at the 22nd verse
[45:06] read the two verses there but it says
[45:09] then hath put all things under his feet
[45:11] and gave him
[45:13] Christ to be the head over all things to
[45:16] the church which is his body
[45:19] the fullness of him that filleth all in
[45:23] all
[45:24] now let's just bow our heads and talk to
[45:27] our Lord
[45:30] how great you are our old father
[45:35] Lord you Reign on high and
[45:38] there's none else like you
[45:42] and Lord we are your children
[45:46] we are sons and daughters
[45:49] in your image Lord that have been made
[45:51] from your
[45:54] your hands the work of your hands Lord
[45:58] your word
[46:00] and father we just humble ourselves here
[46:04] this morning
[46:06] asking that you would just come Among Us
[46:10] we take all limitations all father
[46:14] that you would be free to move Among Us
[46:19] father May our faith be elevated to a
[46:22] place Lord that
[46:25] father we can believe all things
[46:28] but that's that's what we desire Lord
[46:32] I pray Lord that you would help us to be
[46:34] more established in your word
[46:37] give us the words to say Lord and anoint
[46:42] these lips of clay father
[46:45] and I pray that you had anoint the heart
[46:47] and ear of your people to hear and
[46:49] receive
[46:50] let it all be For Your Glory
[46:53] and we ask these things in your lovely
[46:56] name Jesus Christ
[46:58] amen and amen
[47:01] you can have your seats this morning
[47:05] and I'm just going to continue on the
[47:08] subject that we've been speaking on
[47:10] and there is a a reason I am going in
[47:15] this direction that I've gone the past
[47:17] two Sundays I have I have been
[47:20] um
[47:21] studying this for a little while and uh
[47:25] told I believe maybe my wife brother
[47:28] Andrew that I'm wanting to to go this
[47:31] way I guess a month ago or so and and
[47:35] but there's a reason why and and
[47:39] we know that there are two sides that
[47:41] exist really to everything
[47:43] and uh one side that we we see is that
[47:48] where people don't believe that you have
[47:51] to have a Pentecostal experience
[47:55] and also they don't believe in in the
[47:59] shouting they don't believe in dancing
[48:01] they don't believe in
[48:02] uh speaking in tongues or prophesying
[48:06] and they view all of these things as
[48:10] sensational
[48:12] emotional uh nonsense and fanatical or
[48:17] whatever and they consider these things
[48:20] as being part of the Pentecostal age
[48:25] they say well we're now in the opening
[48:28] of the word so these things are
[48:30] something that don't belong to us and so
[48:33] they they tend to have this era about
[48:37] them that the people back in the first
[48:41] church you know they were just as what
[48:44] the Bible would say just ignorant and
[48:47] unlearned and we are now you know they
[48:51] they have this attitude that now we're a
[48:55] better class we're better than what they
[48:58] are we're better off than what they are
[49:00] and uh and so we don't need really what
[49:04] they had and uh maybe not saying it but
[49:07] that's the attitude that's that's what
[49:09] they project when they when they're when
[49:11] they're talking preaching teaching
[49:13] whatever and and and so we don't need
[49:17] what they've got because we have the
[49:19] word open to us we have more knowledge
[49:21] than what they had and therefore we are
[49:24] better off than they
[49:26] and of course their teaching is just
[49:29] very dry intellectual no anointing and
[49:33] their worship is formal and orderly and
[49:37] and to be honest this seems to be uh
[49:41] more appealing to the upper class
[49:44] uh or people that try or want to be
[49:47] dignified
[49:49] and so they don't believe in the nine
[49:52] spiritual gifts being in the church
[49:53] today and they teach that the gifts were
[49:56] for the apostles now we're in the
[49:58] adoption age or or whatever and and so
[50:04] um or they they teach that you know
[50:07] there's some gifts that are for us and
[50:09] but not all the gifts and and and and so
[50:13] then you got some that don't don't
[50:15] believe in laying uh hands on the sick
[50:18] anymore because we've all gone to the
[50:21] spoken word and uh they criticize our
[50:25] prayer lines they create criticize the
[50:27] ministers for hollering and and you know
[50:31] going all over the place and spitting
[50:33] and they don't see the need to break
[50:36] down and cry and boohoo and uh they they
[50:40] don't they don't see the need for the
[50:42] shouting and the dancing and everything
[50:44] needs to be orderly you know and don't
[50:47] need to see the need for the excitement
[50:50] and all of that and and to be honest a
[50:54] lot of people lean that direction
[50:56] and uh then then on the other side of
[51:01] this we have people who who believe in
[51:06] all nine spiritual gifts they believe in
[51:08] the shouting the dancing the praising
[51:10] God they believe in speaking in tongues
[51:13] they believe in Prophecy and Visions
[51:15] they believe in the word of knowledge
[51:17] and and and I I will say that the the
[51:22] prophet lean more to that side than he'd
[51:25] done the other side
[51:27] uh uh for he said I'd rather have a
[51:30] little Wildfire than none at all and he
[51:33] said I'd rather be around a fire that's
[51:35] popping and jumping anytime if the
[51:37] world's cold then to be around an
[51:40] iceberg uh but as we we see and I hope
[51:44] to to uh show that the prophet had a
[51:49] balance to everything he he always had a
[51:52] balance now the problem with this side
[51:55] is that
[51:59] they use these things as a standard for
[52:03] having a good service or a good meaning
[52:05] meeting or and they tend to put these
[52:09] things above the word of God
[52:12] dreams are good
[52:14] but don't trust them
[52:16] right
[52:18] dancing and shouting is good but don't
[52:20] trust them
[52:22] you you cannot trust these things and
[52:25] base the your salvation off of any of
[52:28] this
[52:29] tongues are good but don't trust them
[52:33] prophecy is good but don't trust them
[52:37] and when I say that
[52:40] and and hopefully we can get more into
[52:43] it but prophecy is to be judged
[52:47] ain't that right before the church
[52:49] accepts it it's got to be judged before
[52:52] two or three Witnesses before it is
[52:55] you know from what I can see before it's
[52:58] even brought to the church before the
[53:00] congregation
[53:02] and so uh but but as it was in the
[53:07] Pentecostal age uh
[53:11] it it become a basis uh it become the
[53:14] foundation for everything and so uh uh
[53:19] this side base is a good service on
[53:21] these things they base their whole walk
[53:23] on these things shouting and and so then
[53:26] it becomes shouting and dancing speaking
[53:28] in tongues and and all the nine
[53:31] spiritual gifts become so important that
[53:35] uh uh it because it becomes now the
[53:38] standard for it all and and and and and
[53:42] that's where it becomes starts becoming
[53:44] a workup uh but you cannot base your
[53:47] salvation on anything but the word of
[53:49] God
[53:50] and and so do not and and I repeat that
[53:54] do not be led by dreams
[53:57] emotions Sensations
[54:00] uh uh or even prophecy judge everything
[54:04] by the word of God do you believe that
[54:09] now brother Branham uh he and and
[54:12] there's several places but
[54:14] um you know how it is when you're
[54:17] studying brother Terry and and you read
[54:19] this quote and and then you pass it and
[54:21] then you can't find it and you know you
[54:23] just read it well that's the way it is
[54:25] but I did find uh one uh where brother
[54:29] Brown said I don't care what any Angel
[54:32] would say if it ain't according to the
[54:36] word I don't believe it
[54:38] ain't that right and he said if that
[54:41] angel told me something different from
[54:43] that this word I wouldn't believe the
[54:46] Angel that's right God's words first
[54:48] above all angels and everything else so
[54:53] so you have what brother Branham called
[54:55] the formal side and then you have what
[54:58] brother Branham called The Fanatic side
[55:00] and that that was more Pentecostals
[55:04] in that in that rim and and but he says
[55:07] then the bride stands in the middle
[55:10] walking straight through it calling from
[55:13] both sides ain't that right now I want
[55:16] you to understand that that I'm not
[55:18] fighting with any side it's not a
[55:21] personal thing to me
[55:23] but uh and and what's bad when when when
[55:28] you address things is is because there's
[55:31] so many teachings there's so many things
[55:33] that maybe are are in Era that people
[55:38] automatically think that when you're
[55:41] hitting something if I if I hit on seven
[55:43] Thunders and they're teaching of seventh
[55:44] turn if people know who's teaching that
[55:47] stuff automatically goes right there and
[55:49] say oh he's talking about that group you
[55:50] know and uh or if we talk about two
[55:53] Lords if you know the group that that's
[55:55] talk about two Lords and we're dealing
[55:57] with two Lords it's automatically he's
[55:59] talking about that group but no we're
[56:02] just we're just preaching and we're just
[56:04] trying to say what brother Branham said
[56:06] I don't care who starts it it's just
[56:09] brother Branham
[56:11] is the one that's that come as a prophet
[56:14] and so so it's not a personal thing but
[56:17] it is important to be established in
[56:20] what brother Branham taught and to know
[56:23] what the word says about it as I read
[56:26] last Sunday no True Believer is any
[56:29] stronger and pers spiritually healthy
[56:32] and Alive than his knowledge of and
[56:35] adherence to the pure word of God
[56:38] amen so I'm I'm I'm uh as as a minister
[56:43] of the gospel and as your pastor I am
[56:45] responsible to preach what I believe and
[56:49] see that is in the scripture and in the
[56:51] message and so I'm not going to believe
[56:55] anything and uh by God's grace that
[56:59] would make me have to overlook the many
[57:01] quotes and scriptures uh in order to
[57:05] make my belief work
[57:07] and and if we have to do that if if if
[57:10] we start you know uh if if maybe you you
[57:15] start maybe leaning some way and and
[57:18] then all sudden you see several quotes
[57:20] where brother Brandon says this and it
[57:23] bothers you that he said that to where
[57:26] you can't quote them
[57:28] then something's wrong
[57:30] or so is it with the scriptures
[57:33] if if you're looking at quotes where
[57:35] brother Brown said this and then you and
[57:37] then I ask you well what does the Bible
[57:39] say about it too
[57:41] well brother Ram said this well what
[57:43] does the Bible say about it you
[57:45] understand what I'm saying well that
[57:46] means that your opinion or your
[57:49] interpretation of what brother Brown
[57:50] said ain't mansion because he never
[57:52] taught anything outside this Bible
[57:55] you understand so so you now so so you
[58:00] may hear me say something and
[58:02] automatically you say well he's talking
[58:04] about that individual or is that certain
[58:07] church or whatever that's not true and
[58:10] so don't don't think that okay he's he's
[58:13] taking the fight behind a Pulpit uh to
[58:16] get to get someone in a personal matter
[58:18] that's not true say you you got to let
[58:21] it let the preacher preach and just just
[58:24] let us let it let me just talk and and
[58:27] and if if the minister is preaching
[58:29] truth you know and if it's if if it's I
[58:33] don't care what it is if it's about
[58:34] trinitarian well we're not you know and
[58:36] if there's a trinitarian sitting here
[58:38] we're not singling that that guy out
[58:41] you know we're just preaching truth
[58:44] now and and I understand you know uh you
[58:47] always try to uh uh be wise in in these
[58:51] things but when it's just a church full
[58:54] of uh Believers then we're just going to
[58:56] preach and so it has nothing to do with
[58:59] in in a personal way and I'm not saying
[59:01] anyone has talked to me about it or
[59:03] anything I'm just wanting to make it
[59:05] clear that that uh that you can and I
[59:08] pray that you can have the confidence in
[59:11] me as your pastor uh uh to where uh uh
[59:16] you know that you can say well he's just
[59:18] preaching what the Bible says and what
[59:19] the message says and if it's against
[59:21] what I'm believing or if it's against
[59:23] what so and so is whatever that is truth
[59:27] and and so if if you can't do it that
[59:30] way then there's just no sense in
[59:32] preaching uh uh because uh uh there's so
[59:37] many things out there that any any way
[59:40] you preach any angle You Preach uh
[59:43] you're going to hit something hit
[59:44] somebody or you're gonna whatever if you
[59:47] understand so we we find I want you to
[59:50] listen to this quote brother Brown said
[59:53] when Jesus passed by the pool of
[59:55] Bethesda and seen all the people
[59:57] and he healed a man and the Jews
[1:00:00] questioned him why and he said I do
[1:00:03] nothing but what the father shows me I
[1:00:06] can't do nothing
[1:00:07] so he said whatever he does he shows me
[1:00:10] and then I go do that that's true in
[1:00:11] Saint John 5 19. and we noticed him he
[1:00:15] was a kind man a humble man and yet he
[1:00:18] was a man of power when he spoke see he
[1:00:21] was very humble and gentle but when it
[1:00:24] come time see between to separate
[1:00:27] between truth and error Jesus was very
[1:00:30] Stern picked up some ropes and tied them
[1:00:33] together and kicked over the money
[1:00:35] changers Chargers table and beat them
[1:00:38] out of the temple called the Pharisees
[1:00:40] those religious people said well you
[1:00:42] bunch of Hypocrites you serpent snakes
[1:00:44] in the grass and all these things see he
[1:00:47] was a man who could speak when it come
[1:00:50] time to speak and he was a man who was
[1:00:53] full of love
[1:00:54] notice what he says but he loved his
[1:00:57] father so much till he stayed in harmony
[1:01:00] with his father
[1:01:02] and anything that interfered with that
[1:01:04] Harmony then Jesus drew the line
[1:01:09] now this harmony is supposed to exist in
[1:01:12] the bride
[1:01:13] because he says this he says this
[1:01:16] harmony is now to exist between the
[1:01:18] groom and his bride he shows her his
[1:01:22] Word of Life she receives it she never
[1:01:24] doubts it therefore nothing can harm her
[1:01:26] not even death ain't that right so so
[1:01:30] now you as individuals y'all can do what
[1:01:33] you want to do I don't I don't care I'm
[1:01:35] just preaching yeah I just preached the
[1:01:37] word and and I I I'm I'm doing
[1:01:40] everything by God's grace to stay in
[1:01:44] balance with the message and and the
[1:01:46] word
[1:01:47] but and so but I'm going to draw a line
[1:01:50] between anything that would try to get
[1:01:54] in the way between Harmony and that
[1:01:57] Harmony and disrupt that Harmony between
[1:01:59] me and my father because as Jesus loved
[1:02:02] the father I love the father and I know
[1:02:04] you do too
[1:02:06] and so by God's grace I'm not going to
[1:02:10] teach you the Traditions that came from
[1:02:13] the Pentecostal age I just want to at
[1:02:16] this time to to take you as to what the
[1:02:20] Pentecostal the first church was now
[1:02:23] upon saying that I want to make a
[1:02:27] correction
[1:02:27] as to what I said last Sunday
[1:02:31] um and and and I I mentioned about
[1:02:35] brother John Ryan uh laughing in the
[1:02:38] spirit and speaking in tongues and
[1:02:41] prophesying over brother Branham
[1:02:43] when I got home or even after the
[1:02:46] service I just felt man I just felt
[1:02:48] something wrong and I I I got home and
[1:02:52] it just bothered it's just something
[1:02:54] there and and uh it just wouldn't let up
[1:02:57] for a couple days and and so in my heart
[1:03:00] I was wondering what what did I say what
[1:03:02] what happened what was wrong and so
[1:03:05] Tuesday night I I couldn't sleep I
[1:03:08] um just that just kept uh there uh in my
[1:03:13] mind and and so I I started just trying
[1:03:17] to find the story where brother Branham
[1:03:20] talks about it and uh got to searching
[1:03:24] through the message and and this is what
[1:03:25] brother Branham says he said I become
[1:03:27] acquainted with brother Ryan during that
[1:03:30] time
[1:03:31] um uh speaking of that uh the the uh
[1:03:36] Pentecostal meeting in Indiana that he
[1:03:39] went to and he said uh he said around
[1:03:42] that time he said but I met him at a
[1:03:45] service one day and hurting testifying
[1:03:46] Louisville and so he invited me and
[1:03:50] that's when he come to my house and he
[1:03:53] sat there one day and he said now
[1:03:54] Pentecost was a strange thing to me and
[1:03:57] how many times he tried to tell me about
[1:03:59] it and he was sitting there and he just
[1:04:01] raised up and he threw up his hand and
[1:04:03] began to speak with unknown tongue with
[1:04:06] an unknown tongue and he stopped and
[1:04:08] looked at me right straight walked to me
[1:04:11] laid his hand over on my shoulder and
[1:04:13] said brother Billy you're just a lad now
[1:04:16] there's a lot of Youth to you yet but
[1:04:18] someday that's going to settle down and
[1:04:20] almighty God is going to use you to
[1:04:23] steer the Nations and he walked out
[1:04:25] so it had been a long time since I had
[1:04:28] read this uh
[1:04:31] uh uh and for some reason I thought
[1:04:33] brother Brown said he laughed in the
[1:04:35] spirit
[1:04:36] and and so
[1:04:38] um
[1:04:39] but he didn't say that at all he just
[1:04:41] said he spoke in tongues and he
[1:04:43] prophesied
[1:04:44] so I got to looking into it more about
[1:04:47] what brother Brown said about laughing
[1:04:49] in the spirit and found out he didn't
[1:04:51] say nothing about laughing in the spirit
[1:04:53] at all uh and and unless you all know
[1:04:57] something that I don't that I I looked
[1:04:59] and I I'd spent some time uh trying to
[1:05:02] search it out and and so then the Bible
[1:05:06] doesn't even mention laughing in the
[1:05:08] spirit now the Bible talks about Rejoice
[1:05:10] sing it talks about being happy it talks
[1:05:12] about all these things but that phrase
[1:05:15] laughing in the spirit the the Bible
[1:05:18] doesn't even talk about it and and so uh
[1:05:22] um uh so as far as I know that it's the
[1:05:26] it's the it's something that happened in
[1:05:29] the Pentecostal age unless you all have
[1:05:31] history that I don't have or or whatever
[1:05:34] I I did not study in history I'm just
[1:05:37] taking it for what brother what where
[1:05:40] brother Brandon mentioned it or the
[1:05:41] Bible in that phrase laughing in the
[1:05:44] spirit and so it's something that from
[1:05:47] what I've gathered happened in the
[1:05:49] Pentecostal age and now as a child in
[1:05:52] the Pentecostal uh or whatever Rim uh
[1:05:56] age I I
[1:05:58] um uh I've seen people laugh in the
[1:06:01] spirit
[1:06:01] and and to be honest I I'm going to stay
[1:06:04] neutral with that I I I'm I'm gonna be
[1:06:08] because brother Brandon never mentioned
[1:06:09] it and and so I'm not going to say it's
[1:06:12] it's I'm not going to say either one I'm
[1:06:14] not going to say anything against or
[1:06:16] four uh now I have
[1:06:19] seeing it on internet laughing in the
[1:06:22] spirit charismatics and and to be honest
[1:06:25] it just looks it's it's it's demon uh
[1:06:29] knowledge uh from it just looked to be
[1:06:32] demonic uh there as as uh uh Kenneth
[1:06:37] Hagin and and them if you've ever
[1:06:39] watched that it's it's you know and and
[1:06:41] the Brownsville Revival in Florida
[1:06:44] They're laughing in the spirit and
[1:06:45] barking as dogs and and Howling and and
[1:06:50] they they've actually getting dog
[1:06:52] leashes and putting it around their
[1:06:53] necks and while they're on all fours
[1:06:56] laughing in the you know as laughing in
[1:06:58] the spirit and so I I I I looked up what
[1:07:02] that phrase means laughing in the spirit
[1:07:04] and they said it goes does come from
[1:07:05] Pentecost and and uh that it can last up
[1:07:09] to 15 seconds or to 10 minutes and and
[1:07:13] so uh these things and so uh anyways so
[1:07:17] I wanted to make that correction because
[1:07:19] calls I I am I'm if I'm going to tell
[1:07:23] you uh uh you know what what that that
[1:07:27] we are part of that Pentecostal what
[1:07:31] happened on the day of Pentecost then uh
[1:07:34] then then and that we need that type of
[1:07:37] experience and you know I just believe
[1:07:39] that the Lord wants me to not add things
[1:07:43] that maybe was in the Pentecostal age
[1:07:46] uh uh to what was the original you
[1:07:49] understand so I really think the Lord
[1:07:51] for for uh uh opening that up to me uh
[1:07:56] so what happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:59] was a supernatural event
[1:08:01] and more than that it was a supernatural
[1:08:05] God that came into man
[1:08:08] and and so uh uh brother Branham puts a
[1:08:12] correction uh you know where if you look
[1:08:15] at the the beginning of the book of Acts
[1:08:17] it says uh the the the uh what is it the
[1:08:20] the Acts of the Apostles and and
[1:08:24] um where brother Branham corrects that
[1:08:26] and said it wasn't the Acts of the
[1:08:28] Apostles it was the acts of the Holy
[1:08:31] Ghost and and so uh what the Holy Ghost
[1:08:35] did uh uh through these men uh came
[1:08:40] after the day of Pentecost ain't that
[1:08:43] right and so the the Holy Spirit was
[1:08:46] able to to uh um to do what he did
[1:08:51] through these men because of what took
[1:08:54] place on the day of Pentecost and and so
[1:08:58] and and we know uh what transpired on
[1:09:01] the day of Pentecost it was a birth it
[1:09:04] was the inauguration of the church ain't
[1:09:06] that right now in John 3 3 Jesus said
[1:09:09] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[1:09:13] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:09:16] kingdom then you go on the sixth verse
[1:09:19] and Jesus said verily verily I say unto
[1:09:22] you except a man be born of water and of
[1:09:25] the spirit he cannot enter into the
[1:09:28] kingdom of God so again what happened on
[1:09:31] the day of Pentecost was the birth of
[1:09:34] the church and and and anyone who is a
[1:09:38] part of that church must receive a
[1:09:43] supernatural birth which again is a
[1:09:48] Pentecostal experience so nothing that
[1:09:51] these people received was of man it did
[1:09:54] not come from man it was not inspired by
[1:09:57] man this was the action of the Holy
[1:10:00] Ghost this was God coming into the
[1:10:03] people ain't that right and so it's it's
[1:10:07] uh the church or anyone that belongs in
[1:10:11] that church you cannot be in that church
[1:10:13] without receiving the birth and I say
[1:10:16] it's the birth because there's is only
[1:10:18] one birth that counts your first birth
[1:10:21] don't count this birth counts can you
[1:10:24] say man and and and there's only one
[1:10:27] birth that is able to put a man in the
[1:10:30] body of Christ and so first uh
[1:10:34] Corinthians 12 and 13 for by one Spirit
[1:10:38] we are all baptized into one body ain't
[1:10:43] that right and in that body there are
[1:10:46] gifts I like what brother Branham said
[1:10:48] he he said it's kind of like let's say
[1:10:50] this room here this this room you know
[1:10:53] he says there's gifts uh uh there's a
[1:10:56] chair to sit in there's uh music to play
[1:10:59] there's uh uh you know different things
[1:11:02] that that are beneficial to us and and
[1:11:05] and and and they're here in the room but
[1:11:07] you cannot come into the room unless
[1:11:09] you're baptized into this room you
[1:11:11] understand what I'm saying so that's
[1:11:13] what brother Brown's saying you cannot
[1:11:15] come into that body unless you're bad
[1:11:17] baptized by one Spirit into the body so
[1:11:22] so uh uh we we uh experience uh brother
[1:11:27] Brandon would say we experience
[1:11:29] Pentecost by the new birth ain't that
[1:11:33] right outside of the birth you're making
[1:11:36] up Pentecost it's it's an impersonation
[1:11:39] of Pentecost but but but by that birth
[1:11:43] you will experience Pentecost ain't that
[1:11:47] right and so everybody has to have a
[1:11:49] birth Rich poor dumb smart educated not
[1:11:53] so educated and and these things and it
[1:11:55] doesn't matter who they are they had to
[1:11:58] be born ain't that right amen you all of
[1:12:01] us had to be born or you wouldn't be
[1:12:03] here today you wouldn't even exist amen
[1:12:06] uh and and and we know that that birth
[1:12:09] was a mess amen your mama can tell you
[1:12:12] about that the the your birth was a mess
[1:12:15] and any birth is a mess ain't that rhyme
[1:12:18] and so the educated sophisticated
[1:12:21] dignified guy a man when he was born his
[1:12:25] birth was a mess it was just as a mess
[1:12:28] as the homeless man
[1:12:30] ain't that right see and and so uh uh
[1:12:35] the king even had to his birth was messy
[1:12:39] as as his subject's birth was messy amen
[1:12:43] the birth is a mess it it doesn't
[1:12:46] qualify it doesn't matter if you're in a
[1:12:48] in a family of royalty you're being born
[1:12:51] from a a the queen and and King uh or or
[1:12:55] you're born from a uh just a pauper a
[1:12:59] man every birth is a mess can you say
[1:13:03] man we all had a messy birth when we
[1:13:06] come into this world brother Brown said
[1:13:08] most people don't want the new birth
[1:13:10] because the new birth is kind of messy
[1:13:13] it's like any other birth any birth is a
[1:13:16] mess I don't care where it's at if it's
[1:13:18] in a pig pen or in the barn or if it's
[1:13:21] in a pink decorated hospital room it's a
[1:13:24] mess and so is the new birth a mess
[1:13:27] ain't that right he said it'll make you
[1:13:30] you do things that you don't think you
[1:13:32] would do stand on a corner and beat a
[1:13:34] tambourine or sing glory be to God
[1:13:36] hallelujah praise God glory to God why
[1:13:39] you act like a maniac that's what it
[1:13:42] done to the apostles that's what it done
[1:13:45] to the Virgin Mary Mary she act like she
[1:13:48] was drunk she was a mess in society but
[1:13:51] it takes a mess for life to come out of
[1:13:57] and he said anything unless anything
[1:14:00] dies and rocks life can't come from it
[1:14:02] and unless a man dies and rots in his
[1:14:05] own thoughts Christ can't get into his
[1:14:07] heart ain't that right so so this is the
[1:14:12] only way for for people to get to Christ
[1:14:14] and you think of that a man is by the
[1:14:17] birth and and I know the prophet said
[1:14:19] we're not getting people to Christ we're
[1:14:21] getting them to a church but brothers
[1:14:23] and sisters I know people apply that to
[1:14:25] the message ranks amen but he was
[1:14:27] talking to people that was in Donald
[1:14:29] denominations he was talking to people
[1:14:31] that was holding on to Creeds and
[1:14:33] holding on to false doctrines and
[1:14:35] holding on to traditions and and holding
[1:14:38] on to all we have the remedy to get
[1:14:40] people to crash and that is a messy
[1:14:43] birth
[1:14:45] can you say man we have that remedy and
[1:14:47] if you ain't got that power to bring a
[1:14:49] person to Christ by that birth
[1:14:52] something wrong
[1:14:55] hello
[1:14:56] you can't tell me that these
[1:14:58] charismatics know what a birth is
[1:15:00] you can't tell me that that that these
[1:15:03] denominations know what a birth is
[1:15:05] but we know what a birth is
[1:15:08] because we see the standard of that
[1:15:10] birth and that is in Pentecost
[1:15:12] there's a day of Pentecost it changed
[1:15:15] them it changed their lives it changed
[1:15:18] them Peter from a coward to a a man that
[1:15:21] could have the boldness to preach the
[1:15:23] gospel
[1:15:25] change the way of thinking
[1:15:29] ain't that right
[1:15:30] so see so it's the only way for us to
[1:15:34] get people to Christ preach the pure
[1:15:36] word
[1:15:41] to their own sinking and Creeds of men
[1:15:44] and traditions of men will rot the
[1:15:47] desires of the world will rot
[1:15:50] and you say man and and and so we we
[1:15:54] find in and I'll say it this way you
[1:15:56] don't have to tarry and wait till you
[1:15:59] get the Holy Ghost
[1:16:00] amen they waited they tarried because
[1:16:04] the Holy Ghost said that the the day of
[1:16:06] Pentecost hadn't fully come yet
[1:16:09] but brother Branham tells us you don't
[1:16:11] have to wait you don't have to tear me
[1:16:15] can you say man but I will say this if
[1:16:18] you ain't got what they had then don't
[1:16:21] go out and say you got it
[1:16:24] and if you're not getting it the prophet
[1:16:26] said there's something wrong
[1:16:28] You Gotta Die Out
[1:16:31] I don't care if you got to die out to
[1:16:33] your pride I don't care if you gotta die
[1:16:34] out to your thoughts whatever it is
[1:16:38] some people don't want the Holy Ghost
[1:16:39] because they're afraid what it'll do to
[1:16:40] them
[1:16:42] y'all May it'll embarrass them I'd
[1:16:44] rather have the Holy Ghost than be
[1:16:45] embarrassed
[1:16:51] we need it
[1:16:53] we need it
[1:16:54] you wander away from that day of
[1:16:56] Pentecost you've gone too far
[1:16:59] hello
[1:17:00] every generation
[1:17:03] has a chance for this right there
[1:17:07] it's true we may have more knowledge of
[1:17:10] the word today but you'll never be able
[1:17:13] to walk away from that seed outgrow that
[1:17:15] what what God done what God planted it
[1:17:18] was life in them people
[1:17:21] he planted life
[1:17:23] his own life in the people
[1:17:26] then you say Amen
[1:17:29] and if that life is still here it's the
[1:17:31] same life
[1:17:35] now we we find brother Bram says when
[1:17:38] you're trying to think for yourself
[1:17:40] well now if I walk up to the Altar and
[1:17:42] say Yes Lord I'm a fine fellow I'll take
[1:17:44] you I'll pay my tithes I'll do this no
[1:17:46] you've got to die and rot right there to
[1:17:49] your thoughts let everybody say let the
[1:17:53] Holy Ghost take over
[1:17:55] and just do
[1:17:57] whatever he wants to do with you
[1:18:01] whatever he wants to do with you just
[1:18:04] let go and let God
[1:18:05] can you say Amen you say oh no I'm
[1:18:08] opening up to Devils when I do that
[1:18:09] that's not true when you open up to this
[1:18:12] word you're opening up yourself up to
[1:18:15] Devils when you deny the day of
[1:18:16] Pentecost is for us today that same
[1:18:19] experience that was there is for us
[1:18:21] today and if you can't believe that
[1:18:23] that's the devil lying to you you've got
[1:18:26] to have an experience
[1:18:28] you've got to have a new birth
[1:18:33] can you say man
[1:18:34] and so you've got to just let him do
[1:18:37] based upon this promise
[1:18:40] I ain't gonna accept blood in my hands
[1:18:42] I'm not going to accept oil in my in
[1:18:44] coming out of the forehead that ain't
[1:18:46] what the Bible promised that God
[1:18:49] whatever you promised in this word I'm
[1:18:51] gonna yield myself to it
[1:18:55] can you say Amen
[1:18:57] so let the Holy Ghost take over and just
[1:19:00] do whatever he wants to with you get
[1:19:02] kind of messy with it
[1:19:06] ain't that right I know these
[1:19:08] charismatics make fun of these women you
[1:19:10] know our our women and the women of old
[1:19:13] that would have them bee hives you know
[1:19:15] them hair dudes and they get to dancing
[1:19:16] and Bobby here you know I've heard them
[1:19:18] I've uh They're laughing and making fun
[1:19:21] of it but it's the Holy Ghost when a lot
[1:19:23] of them sisters that was doing that
[1:19:26] and they didn't care what people think
[1:19:28] and they still don't care
[1:19:31] they gotta dance their shoes off let
[1:19:33] them dance it
[1:19:36] and I say to you young people whatever
[1:19:38] God has you to do don't you be afraid of
[1:19:40] it
[1:19:41] don't be afraid of the scorners don't be
[1:19:43] afraid of the Skeptics because you're
[1:19:46] going to have them all through life
[1:19:47] anything you do for God and and some of
[1:19:51] you that are leaders in in the church uh
[1:19:53] you're gonna you know that there's
[1:19:55] people always going to fight you in
[1:19:57] whatever you're trying to do they're
[1:19:58] going to be Skeptics of this and
[1:20:00] Skeptics of that well that's the way it
[1:20:02] is with Believers with Christians the
[1:20:04] more you move up in God the greater this
[1:20:06] criticism is going to be
[1:20:09] but just get lost in the spirit
[1:20:15] get kind of messy with it
[1:20:18] he said that's that sounds horrible
[1:20:20] not sacrilegious but it's the truth
[1:20:24] it's the only way I know how to punch
[1:20:26] the thing out to make you understand it
[1:20:30] what was more of a mess
[1:20:32] than that dignified bunch of Jews that
[1:20:35] day to see them people come out there
[1:20:39] with stammering lips
[1:20:41] dignified people watching a bunch of
[1:20:44] people with stammering lips
[1:20:48] I look you know brother random talked
[1:20:50] about you know stammering wrote around
[1:20:52] said is like stuttering
[1:20:55] so they had stammering lips they
[1:20:58] couldn't speak
[1:21:00] all they done is uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:21:04] they they they they they they they were
[1:21:07] stuttering
[1:21:09] the Bible called it stammering lips
[1:21:14] hello
[1:21:16] Jesus see that and and and and and see
[1:21:19] they're they're pure tongue cloven
[1:21:21] tongues like as a fire and it's set up
[1:21:24] on each of them
[1:21:26] right that word cloven means part it's
[1:21:29] split like a a cloven hoof split see and
[1:21:33] the people couldn't say anything
[1:21:39] they weren't talking
[1:21:41] they weren't jabbering they weren't
[1:21:44] doing nothing the prophet said but just
[1:21:46] making noise uh uh
[1:21:51] now the prophet said see Mary had
[1:21:54] stammering lips which means clothing
[1:21:57] just a stammer trying to say something
[1:22:00] she was so full of the spirit she
[1:22:02] couldn't say it so brother Branham in
[1:22:05] imitates a stammering person and and
[1:22:09] say stammering lives and all of a sudden
[1:22:13] with another language they spoke out
[1:22:17] [Music]
[1:22:20] hello
[1:22:21] that's what the prophet says
[1:22:24] with another language they spoke out
[1:22:28] but see they were maniacs
[1:22:31] to a dignified bunch of people
[1:22:37] maybe you don't believe that but that's
[1:22:39] what the prophet says
[1:22:41] they were maniacs
[1:22:44] oh I got the Holy Ghost then you're
[1:22:46] trying to be friends with everybody
[1:22:48] you can't stand criticism
[1:22:54] hello
[1:22:55] so so we'll get more into that later but
[1:22:58] Jesus said except a corn of wheat fall
[1:23:00] in the ground and die and rot see so
[1:23:03] brother Brown said see messy get dirty
[1:23:06] with it that's right just die out and
[1:23:09] get down there
[1:23:10] he said a woman said to me one time said
[1:23:13] I'd be ashamed them people down there
[1:23:14] said I couldn't even hear you preach
[1:23:17] said why them women and men hollering
[1:23:19] hallelujah amen praise the Lord I
[1:23:21] couldn't hear what you were saying I
[1:23:23] said if they didn't say it it'd scare me
[1:23:25] to death
[1:23:27] hello
[1:23:29] if they didn't say it it would scare me
[1:23:31] to death she said when that woman got up
[1:23:33] there and started crying just run chills
[1:23:35] uh chills right up my back I said if
[1:23:38] you'd ever get to heaven you would
[1:23:39] preached to death the prophet didn't
[1:23:41] side with her
[1:23:43] say well I know them people need to be
[1:23:45] quiet I'm trying to teach them no he
[1:23:47] didn't side with him he said lady if
[1:23:49] you'd ever get to heaven you're going to
[1:23:51] freeze to death then
[1:23:52] if one woman's screaming and hollering
[1:23:55] and being excited about the word of God
[1:23:57] is going to run chills up in your back
[1:23:59] amen then you're going to freeze to this
[1:24:01] because they're going to be a millions
[1:24:03] of them over there
[1:24:04] then you say amen that's right he said
[1:24:07] see because everybody will be screaming
[1:24:10] and shouting and praising God do you
[1:24:12] realize you're only reflecting at the
[1:24:15] place that you're going to down here
[1:24:18] down here you're reflecting you're
[1:24:20] either a reflection of heaven or you're
[1:24:23] a reflection of the other place
[1:24:27] and there ain't gonna be people
[1:24:28] miserable there ain't gonna be people a
[1:24:30] man that is just uh so gloomy and
[1:24:33] talking negative and don't they they
[1:24:34] ain't going to be that way up in heaven
[1:24:36] and that same life is in a people today
[1:24:40] that gives us a a a an Outlook when
[1:24:44] there ain't nothing to look at positive
[1:24:45] about we can still see heaven we can
[1:24:48] still see that God is with us we can
[1:24:50] still see that God is going to answer
[1:24:52] our prayer
[1:24:55] that's what gets us excited
[1:25:00] what is it
[1:25:02] that life within us
[1:25:06] so he said see
[1:25:08] he said if you ever go to get to heaven
[1:25:11] you would preach to death I said because
[1:25:13] every everybody will be screaming
[1:25:15] shouting and praising
[1:25:17] he said what they're afraid of
[1:25:19] the new birth
[1:25:21] and you say man
[1:25:22] that's the reason we got grandchildren
[1:25:24] in the church they're afraid of the new
[1:25:26] birth afraid of the Holy Ghost afraid of
[1:25:27] the power of God afraid it'll wash some
[1:25:30] of the makeup off you or something
[1:25:33] afraid it'll clean them up afraid that
[1:25:36] they'll have to walk alone and lose all
[1:25:37] their friends
[1:25:39] they're afraid
[1:25:40] so they they want to make they want to
[1:25:42] make it a social gospel
[1:25:45] this message ain't Social Gospel if if
[1:25:48] you don't want to walk alone then don't
[1:25:50] follow the message I understand there
[1:25:53] are people that just want to be a part
[1:25:55] of the message but they don't want to
[1:25:56] leave that world they don't want to
[1:25:57] leave amen they're they're Pentecostal
[1:26:00] Traditions Baptist Traditions or
[1:26:02] whatever
[1:26:03] all right
[1:26:05] because it makes you act crazy
[1:26:13] you love him
[1:26:15] so what happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:26:17] brother Brown said deity fell out on the
[1:26:19] day of Pentecost
[1:26:20] and it's still falling
[1:26:23] that's what he said that's what it is it
[1:26:26] isn't about the shouting and the dance
[1:26:28] and all that let's just say what
[1:26:29] happened deity fell on the day of
[1:26:32] Pentecost and it done something to them
[1:26:35] people and it's still falling and it's
[1:26:38] still doing something to us
[1:26:43] that's the new birth
[1:26:46] and this is what made them a Christian
[1:26:49] and that's still what it takes
[1:26:52] to make a Christian
[1:26:54] and you say Amen
[1:26:56] brother Brown said see to be a Christian
[1:26:58] you must be christ-like
[1:27:00] tabernacling deity in you
[1:27:03] with the Holy Ghost that fell on the day
[1:27:05] of Pentecost not some emotion but I mean
[1:27:10] a real Pentecost
[1:27:15] foreign
[1:27:17] and then in another quote he says but
[1:27:19] Sensations come with it
[1:27:21] it's not a sensation that they receive
[1:27:23] but sensation came with it
[1:27:29] so you have a real Pentecost when deity
[1:27:32] is tabernacling in you like it did on
[1:27:35] the day of Pentecost what is it
[1:27:38] it is quickening
[1:27:40] quickening ain't that right
[1:27:43] see Ephesians 2 1 and you have to
[1:27:44] Quicken who were dead in trespasses and
[1:27:47] sins
[1:27:48] acts 1 and 8 and you shall receive power
[1:27:53] Supernatural power quickening power
[1:27:56] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[1:27:59] you ain't that right so that's what
[1:28:01] happened
[1:28:02] the Holy Ghost deity came into them
[1:28:05] people and they were quickened
[1:28:08] Hallelujah
[1:28:10] now this power that they received is the
[1:28:13] ultimate it's the Supreme
[1:28:15] it's the highest the absolute above any
[1:28:17] other power
[1:28:19] as I said it changed Peter and the rest
[1:28:21] of the people that had received this
[1:28:24] deity
[1:28:25] God in them
[1:28:27] ain't that right
[1:28:29] and when Paul received it it changed him
[1:28:32] when any man received it when any woman
[1:28:34] boy girl received it it changed them
[1:28:38] can you say man
[1:28:39] yes sir that's right for it's the only
[1:28:42] way that a man can change
[1:28:44] yeah and that's true now it's the only
[1:28:47] way a man can change
[1:28:49] and as I said that the gospel the church
[1:28:52] is not a zoo
[1:28:54] we are free to come and go as we please
[1:28:57] we are free to do whatever we want to as
[1:29:01] we please
[1:29:02] but something has got a hold of us
[1:29:05] it has changed us to where I no longer
[1:29:09] want the world I I don't there's
[1:29:10] Temptations but down in my soul it it
[1:29:14] there's something that says I don't want
[1:29:16] that
[1:29:20] it's true
[1:29:22] so the only way for a man to receive
[1:29:24] this power is by receiving the holy
[1:29:26] ghost in the soul
[1:29:28] that quickens deceit in them
[1:29:30] ain't that right notice what brother
[1:29:32] Brown said the power of God took over
[1:29:34] the church on the day of Pentecost
[1:29:37] it made them drunk
[1:29:40] yep the Bible says they were drunk
[1:29:43] Prophet says they went into the streets
[1:29:45] staggering swinging their arms and
[1:29:46] acting like a bunch of Maniacs oh boy
[1:29:49] formals don't like that do they we want
[1:29:52] to just stand there and be dignified
[1:29:56] try not to break a sweat
[1:30:01] now brother Brad you know what brother
[1:30:03] Brown said after that quote he said to
[1:30:05] say that that's wrong is to deny the
[1:30:07] Bible
[1:30:10] ain't that right
[1:30:12] you say that that's wrong is to deny the
[1:30:14] Bible
[1:30:15] another quote he says the mother of
[1:30:17] Jesus had to go up there and be included
[1:30:20] in that bunch of people so drunk on the
[1:30:23] spirit till she staggered like she was
[1:30:24] drunk on whiskey or something and you
[1:30:27] think you'll get to Heaven by sleeping
[1:30:30] over to the church putting your song
[1:30:32] book under your arm and walking over
[1:30:34] every Sunday morning and the build tolls
[1:30:37] and sit and listen at some and walk back
[1:30:39] and some of the and then then he just
[1:30:41] says and walk back he said you'll never
[1:30:43] do it
[1:30:44] just coming to church sitting there
[1:30:46] listening to a preacher and walking out
[1:30:48] they ain't gonna do it
[1:30:52] and you say amen he said you'll have to
[1:30:54] come that route
[1:30:56] the way Mary came and the way the others
[1:30:59] came you're going to have to come that
[1:31:00] route because that's the only everybody
[1:31:03] say the only route
[1:31:04] that God ever lay down and ever has and
[1:31:08] you'll walk it or you won't be there he
[1:31:11] said I'm not your judge but I'm
[1:31:12] preaching the gospel that's exactly the
[1:31:15] truth the Blessed Virgin was right there
[1:31:18] acted just like it just as idiotic as
[1:31:22] the rest of them did just as drunk as
[1:31:24] the rest of them
[1:31:32] another place brother Brown said they
[1:31:34] went out on the street to begin
[1:31:35] screaming and act like crazy people
[1:31:41] but they say the opening of the word
[1:31:43] changed all that
[1:31:45] nonsense
[1:31:49] the opening of the word is the fullness
[1:31:51] of the word right
[1:31:53] so that means you can't pick and choose
[1:31:57] you can't say well yeah we're we're I'm
[1:31:59] going to believe it all but then deny
[1:32:01] the experience that they had for you
[1:32:05] hello
[1:32:06] now now you're working all of it up
[1:32:09] that's that's Pentecostal age that that
[1:32:11] comes from Pentacles I'm not talking
[1:32:13] about that they didn't work it up
[1:32:16] they waited on a promise
[1:32:18] hello
[1:32:20] it didn't matter they didn't know what
[1:32:22] the Holy Ghost was going to do to them
[1:32:24] they didn't know
[1:32:26] so there was no standards there you
[1:32:28] understand what I'm saying they didn't
[1:32:30] know okay Peter now now when this thing
[1:32:32] comes we're going to be dancing we're
[1:32:34] going to be shouting we're going to be
[1:32:35] we're going to be speaking in unknown
[1:32:37] tongues or tongues and and stammering
[1:32:39] and all that when it comes that way
[1:32:40] we'll know we got it they had no idea
[1:32:44] but all they knew when it happened it
[1:32:48] happened
[1:32:49] they were changed
[1:32:51] then you say amen and then they acted
[1:32:54] drunk
[1:32:55] and I don't care what the Holy Ghost
[1:32:58] does for you
[1:32:59] that all I know when it comes you're
[1:33:01] going to be different
[1:33:03] and if it makes you emotional to where
[1:33:05] you sit and cry or you roll on the floor
[1:33:07] or whatever it is you're going to be
[1:33:11] changed from that moment forward
[1:33:20] the prophets at Sea the Holy Ghost fail
[1:33:22] and divided itself and tongues of fire
[1:33:24] set upon each of them
[1:33:26] and while they were influenced everybody
[1:33:29] say they were influenced not by man but
[1:33:32] by the Holy Ghost
[1:33:33] and while they were influenced by the
[1:33:36] Holy Ghost they went into action
[1:33:38] staggering like drunk men screaming
[1:33:41] speaking in tongues out into the street
[1:33:43] they went what was it they were
[1:33:46] influenced by the Holy Ghost
[1:33:51] another place brother Graham said it
[1:33:53] made them slobber
[1:33:55] oh
[1:33:56] stammer
[1:33:57] act like a bunch of drunk people
[1:34:00] but
[1:34:01] everybody say but
[1:34:03] they were receiving New Life
[1:34:07] God was placing his life into that 120.
[1:34:10] they screamed they shouted they spoke in
[1:34:13] tongues they ran they acted like drunk
[1:34:15] people because they was inoculated
[1:34:19] and you say man
[1:34:21] what were they inoculated from the
[1:34:23] prophet said from the styles of the
[1:34:25] world
[1:34:27] I think it was brother Terry that had
[1:34:29] mentioned uh a couple weeks ago or so
[1:34:32] that the 120 were scared then people
[1:34:34] that went in that upper room they were
[1:34:36] scared to death
[1:34:37] they were cowards and and and and well
[1:34:40] let's I don't want to set that way uh uh
[1:34:43] they they it made them cowardly
[1:34:46] because they were scared for their life
[1:34:49] and and I'm gonna be honest with you I I
[1:34:51] probably would be too
[1:34:53] you understand what I'm saying that's
[1:34:55] the human side of it
[1:34:56] right The Human Side
[1:34:59] and and and so they they were they were
[1:35:02] scared for their lives they you know uh
[1:35:05] they didn't they really didn't know all
[1:35:07] they knew was the command that Jesus
[1:35:08] told them go and tarry and so we we know
[1:35:12] that they went out into the upper room
[1:35:13] they hid themselves
[1:35:15] ain't that right
[1:35:17] they hid themselves in the upper room
[1:35:20] and but notice what brother Brown said
[1:35:22] it was a paradox how about them people
[1:35:25] up in that Upper Room they're afraid of
[1:35:27] the Jews and had walked out walked with
[1:35:30] Jesus but when the Holy Ghost came they
[1:35:33] wasn't afraid no more
[1:35:35] out in the street they went screaming
[1:35:37] and falling and acting like a bunch of
[1:35:39] drunk people that was a paradox
[1:35:45] then you say man it's a paradox and I
[1:35:48] think that's the same way it is today
[1:35:49] when we go through our trials when we
[1:35:51] see the fear and the things uh uh that
[1:35:54] are happening in the world today that is
[1:35:56] causing fear you know good and well that
[1:35:59] our our economy is is not stable they
[1:36:02] they are saying recession is coming they
[1:36:05] they they they they you know their their
[1:36:07] props signed Doom and Gloom and and all
[1:36:10] of that but why is it that we still
[1:36:12] Rejoice why is it that we're still
[1:36:14] thankful why is it that we're still
[1:36:16] praising God why is it that our churches
[1:36:19] there ain't a a gloomy Spirit over the
[1:36:21] church today is because we're not afraid
[1:36:26] We're Not Afraid
[1:36:29] and we're not trusting in our own
[1:36:31] ability but the same life that God
[1:36:34] filled himself Amen in US is quickening
[1:36:38] us to where we know that God is the one
[1:36:41] that supplies our needs
[1:36:42] can you say Amen he's the one that'll
[1:36:45] protect us he is the one that will keep
[1:36:47] us
[1:36:53] so out on the street they went screaming
[1:36:56] falling and acting like a bunch of drunk
[1:36:58] people that was a paradox
[1:37:00] see the Holy Ghost Came Upon them women
[1:37:02] and all they wasn't ashamed of the
[1:37:05] Gospel of Jesus Christ so the Holy Ghost
[1:37:08] took the fear away
[1:37:11] and so remember brother Brown said that
[1:37:14] on the day of Pentecost God planted a
[1:37:17] Pentecostal seed
[1:37:18] that's when the the church was
[1:37:20] inaugurated and and and brother Brown
[1:37:23] said God had a perfect Church
[1:37:30] he had a perfect Church
[1:37:33] and he says another place that church
[1:37:34] was a noisy Church
[1:37:37] they all staggered under the power of
[1:37:39] God full of new wine
[1:37:42] is that right
[1:37:43] we read this before he said that's the
[1:37:46] way the church was ordained that's the
[1:37:48] way that every church was ordained every
[1:37:51] time God has a church it'll be that same
[1:37:53] kind of a church because it ain't got no
[1:37:57] uncertain sound
[1:37:59] and you say amen and the preachers ain't
[1:38:02] preaching an uncertain sound we're
[1:38:05] telling you what God did for them you
[1:38:07] can have it today the same experience
[1:38:11] can you say Amen people our hearts are
[1:38:13] filled with fear in this world why they
[1:38:17] ain't got the experience that they
[1:38:18] needed they trusted in their Church they
[1:38:20] trusted in the preacher they trusted in
[1:38:23] their uh some experience but it wasn't
[1:38:25] based upon a Bible they they trusted in
[1:38:28] a dream they trusted in a prophecy they
[1:38:31] trusted in speaking in tongue they
[1:38:33] trusted it all but they never had a life
[1:38:36] change
[1:38:43] you love him
[1:38:48] so that was the birth of the church back
[1:38:51] then
[1:38:52] and every individual that receives the
[1:38:54] new birth
[1:38:56] will receive that same power
[1:38:58] and same Pentecostal experience
[1:39:01] and you say man
[1:39:03] and notice what they did
[1:39:05] afterward
[1:39:08] laughs
[1:39:10] the people went out the prophet said and
[1:39:13] done signs and wonders
[1:39:15] Peter
[1:39:17] who couldn't even write or read his own
[1:39:19] name couldn't read couldn't write his
[1:39:21] own name
[1:39:25] and yet that that same man
[1:39:29] the Bible says he and John I think was
[1:39:32] walking at the gate called Beautiful
[1:39:35] into the temple
[1:39:37] there was that lame man
[1:39:39] that man had been like that for many
[1:39:41] years or maybe even since birth
[1:39:44] I can't remember how the Bible talks
[1:39:46] about it but we know that he was begging
[1:39:49] for alms that was his way of life
[1:39:53] and he looked for rich people
[1:39:56] I'm sure
[1:39:57] people that had money
[1:40:00] But Here Comes these
[1:40:02] people that didn't have much
[1:40:05] but Peter says you know what silver and
[1:40:07] gold I don't have any
[1:40:09] but what I do have
[1:40:11] I give to you
[1:40:15] in the name of Jesus Christ rise and
[1:40:18] walk
[1:40:19] and the Bible says the man leaped to his
[1:40:22] feet shouting praising God
[1:40:25] can you say man
[1:40:27] that's right
[1:40:28] see so so we find that Paul upon
[1:40:33] receiving the same Pentecostal
[1:40:34] experience had so much God in him that
[1:40:37] he took the handkerchiefs off his body
[1:40:40] and sent it back to the sick person and
[1:40:43] he got healed
[1:40:44] see and and brother Branham said see the
[1:40:47] real Holy Ghost brings forth the same
[1:40:49] kind of an Evidence and proof that they
[1:40:52] had back there it comes with the same
[1:40:54] Holy Ghost
[1:40:56] you with me same Holy Ghost
[1:40:59] that's why we should be under
[1:41:01] expectation
[1:41:03] I want to challenge you to believe this
[1:41:06] morning
[1:41:09] I I hope that that that you're believing
[1:41:14] that when you're looking at the
[1:41:15] obstacles in your life and and maybe in
[1:41:18] your family whether it be your child or
[1:41:20] your husband or whatever that you can
[1:41:23] look and say that same holy ghost that I
[1:41:25] received will bring forth the same
[1:41:27] evidence
[1:41:29] are you with me now that same Holy Ghost
[1:41:32] I don't care I don't have to worry about
[1:41:34] it I don't have to ponder over it I
[1:41:37] don't have to fear about it
[1:41:38] can you say man the same promise that
[1:41:42] was back there is for you today
[1:41:48] think of what was given to that
[1:41:49] Philippian Jailer
[1:41:52] you just believed believe on Jesus
[1:41:54] Christ be in thy house shall be saved
[1:41:58] that meant a lot to that Philippian
[1:42:00] Jailer
[1:42:02] and Paul didn't even know his family I I
[1:42:04] don't guess
[1:42:06] but he gave the promise anyhow
[1:42:09] thee in thy family
[1:42:10] it's to thee in thy house
[1:42:12] can you say amen and then a prophet
[1:42:15] stands upon on on the Earth today to
[1:42:18] give us the same promise
[1:42:20] it's for thee in thy house
[1:42:22] lay claim to it
[1:42:25] can you say Amen see why you've got the
[1:42:28] same Holy Ghost receive the same power
[1:42:30] and you have the same evidence
[1:42:34] oh my I I'd encourage anyone here to
[1:42:38] read the book of Acts
[1:42:39] and go through it and see what what they
[1:42:41] done what that early church done
[1:42:45] hello because what they done is not an
[1:42:48] isolated thing
[1:42:50] because we are identified with that
[1:42:52] Pentecostal scene notice what brother
[1:42:54] Brown said the seed of Christ must come
[1:42:56] through his body not through a
[1:42:58] denomination now
[1:42:59] but through a word through a born again
[1:43:02] seed of the word must come through now
[1:43:05] remember what is it Christ's seed how
[1:43:09] does my seed come through the body how
[1:43:11] does the apple seed or tree seed come
[1:43:13] through the body see seed is through the
[1:43:16] body and the church is the body of
[1:43:19] Christ
[1:43:20] that right the Bible Church see uh this
[1:43:24] birth produces that's the new birth
[1:43:25] himself in body his church is his word
[1:43:31] so that people can see the confirmation
[1:43:33] of Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:43:36] yesterday today and forever
[1:43:39] you believe it
[1:43:40] see now not denominational hybrids now
[1:43:44] this is those that's in the in in the
[1:43:47] orbit waiting for the countdown you know
[1:43:50] what I mean fixing to take a a a a a
[1:43:52] Rocket's Glory see not these are not for
[1:43:55] denominational hybrids not standing in
[1:43:58] here and they're not no sir it's the
[1:44:01] seed
[1:44:04] I may seed
[1:44:06] well we're seed age
[1:44:08] that's what the prophet said were seed
[1:44:10] age
[1:44:12] see time bright time
[1:44:17] so what happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:44:19] is for us today
[1:44:21] and
[1:44:23] I believe this is true
[1:44:25] because also brother Branham Likens
[1:44:30] that experience that they had and the
[1:44:32] things that they did to the manna
[1:44:34] that fail in the wilderness in the Old
[1:44:38] Testament
[1:44:39] most of us know about it every day God
[1:44:43] sent manna
[1:44:45] from Heaven defeat his people
[1:44:47] and brother Brian said it was manna that
[1:44:49] fell on the day of Pentecost
[1:44:53] ain't that right
[1:44:54] and notice
[1:44:56] that manner that fell in the wilderness
[1:44:58] was bread
[1:45:00] remember Graham called it angel food
[1:45:03] it was bread which was a type of Jesus
[1:45:06] Christ
[1:45:07] is that right
[1:45:09] for Jesus said in John I am the bread
[1:45:13] that came from Heaven came down from
[1:45:15] heaven so the prophet said he was the
[1:45:18] word bread
[1:45:19] the word bread
[1:45:21] so then we find Matthew 4 4 Jesus said
[1:45:24] it is written just break it in here man
[1:45:26] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:45:28] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:45:30] mouth of God
[1:45:32] so he was the word manna that fell on
[1:45:36] the day of Pentecost
[1:45:37] ain't that right now as we said brother
[1:45:40] Brown said God planted a Pentecostal
[1:45:42] seed there but he also called it a bread
[1:45:46] grain
[1:45:49] right
[1:45:50] so what fell on the day of Pentecost was
[1:45:53] bread seed Pentecostal seed bread grain
[1:45:56] that's right see so it was bread green
[1:46:00] bread word bread
[1:46:03] grain Pentecostal seed all the same
[1:46:06] Manna it fell
[1:46:09] and now brother Brown says that Manna is
[1:46:12] a very beautiful type of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:14] that fell on the day of Pentecost which
[1:46:16] is our bread
[1:46:17] see men have failed just the same on the
[1:46:20] last day of their Journey as it did on
[1:46:22] the first day of the journey and it fell
[1:46:24] all through the Journey
[1:46:27] now brother Brad said today we'll
[1:46:28] continue falling till the millennium
[1:46:31] you say man
[1:46:33] now don't get quiet on me and disagree
[1:46:35] with that because I'll show you later on
[1:46:38] exactly where it's all coming down to
[1:46:41] where we're at the point I'm getting
[1:46:43] today is we're still at Pentecost in
[1:46:46] experience
[1:46:47] and it wasn't just something that just
[1:46:50] happened it was a manner that the church
[1:46:53] needed
[1:46:55] then you say man so we we find in the
[1:46:59] Old Testament you know the the God told
[1:47:02] the people he remember he told the
[1:47:04] people he says now now don't store up
[1:47:06] the manna
[1:47:08] don't store up the Manna uh for tomorrow
[1:47:12] you just take what you need for today
[1:47:15] ain't that right just take what you need
[1:47:18] today because
[1:47:21] it'll get
[1:47:23] it's full it'll ruin and so in in Exodus
[1:47:28] 16 20
[1:47:30] we found out that some of them didn't
[1:47:34] listen
[1:47:35] and some left of it until the morning
[1:47:38] and it bred worms and stank and Moses
[1:47:42] was Wrath with them
[1:47:44] ain't that right but that's not the end
[1:47:47] of the story
[1:47:49] we find in Exodus 16 33
[1:47:53] that Moses said unto Aaron take a pot
[1:47:56] and we know that this was a commandment
[1:47:58] from God take a pot and put an Homer
[1:48:02] full of manna therein and lay it out
[1:48:05] before the Lord to be kept for your
[1:48:09] Generations
[1:48:12] hello
[1:48:14] so what now is it this manner would not
[1:48:17] be left for everybody
[1:48:20] this would be a hidden manner
[1:48:25] hello
[1:48:26] and as the Lord commanded Moses so Aaron
[1:48:29] laid it up before the testimony to be
[1:48:32] kept
[1:48:34] see so where do they put it they had to
[1:48:36] put it in the holiest of holy
[1:48:39] not just anyone could go into the
[1:48:40] holiest of holy
[1:48:42] everybody had their had their Manna out
[1:48:45] here and out there nobody was able to
[1:48:49] keep it
[1:48:50] because it would spoil
[1:48:52] but in there
[1:48:55] that Manna would be kept for Generations
[1:48:58] after
[1:49:02] ain't that right
[1:49:04] so see and and the prophet said see that
[1:49:07] Manna was was kept where The Mercy Seat
[1:49:10] was
[1:49:13] it was kept where The Mercy Seat was and
[1:49:15] where the presence of God was
[1:49:18] ain't that right and it would last for
[1:49:21] future generations and only the elected
[1:49:25] called Chosen and ordained out of each
[1:49:28] generation were able to go behind that
[1:49:31] Veil amen and partake of the original
[1:49:35] manna
[1:49:38] foreign
[1:49:41] says every generation after that
[1:49:43] priesthood
[1:49:44] when a man comes to go becomes to go to
[1:49:47] be a priest to minister the word the
[1:49:50] first thing he gets to do after he is
[1:49:52] ordained is go in and get a handful of
[1:49:55] that original Manna and eat it
[1:49:58] and you say man
[1:50:00] now I'd say to you every ordained child
[1:50:03] of God that is called and elected and
[1:50:07] chosen to go behind the veil
[1:50:10] has every right to partake of that
[1:50:14] original manna
[1:50:17] can you say Amen
[1:50:19] that's right only the chosen
[1:50:22] now brother Brown says now you don't
[1:50:25] have to receive some duplicate or
[1:50:27] something wait till you get a taste of
[1:50:30] the original manna that fell on the day
[1:50:33] of Pentecost
[1:50:34] another place every believer that'll
[1:50:37] break behind the curtain Yonder and
[1:50:39] enter into this priesthood has a right
[1:50:42] to eat of the original manna that fell
[1:50:44] on the day of Pentecost a real
[1:50:47] old-fashioned Holy Ghost blessing
[1:50:49] another place every man that meets God's
[1:50:52] conditions and becomes a priest to come
[1:50:56] behind the veil and separate himself
[1:50:58] from the world receives not only a
[1:51:01] mouthful but a heartful of the original
[1:51:04] manna that fell on the day of Pentecost
[1:51:07] not something that looks like it but
[1:51:10] some of the real thing
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:16] another place that people who really
[1:51:18] want the Holy Ghost won't receive
[1:51:19] something that looks like the Holy Ghost
[1:51:21] but they've got a mouthful and a Heart
[1:51:24] full of the original manna that fell on
[1:51:26] the day of Pentecost God's laid it up
[1:51:29] for every generation
[1:51:32] and you say amen and where is that
[1:51:34] hitting man hat where the presence of
[1:51:37] God Is Where The Mercy Seat is
[1:51:43] ain't that right he's got it laid up for
[1:51:46] every generation hallelujah amen and it
[1:51:49] brings the same results staggering like
[1:51:51] drunk men filled with the spirit signs
[1:51:54] and wonders
[1:51:57] brother Brown in another place said the
[1:51:59] same Holy Ghost which was a type that
[1:52:02] fell on the day of Pentecost will
[1:52:04] continue the same until the Millennium
[1:52:06] sets in men will still have the Holy
[1:52:08] Ghost and the same things will take
[1:52:11] place all the way through until the
[1:52:14] Millennium age
[1:52:16] and you say man
[1:52:18] and if you'll notice
[1:52:20] that Manna is not contaminated
[1:52:26] it's hidden minute
[1:52:28] it's the original
[1:52:30] it's not contaminated with Creeds and
[1:52:32] dogmas and traditions of men
[1:52:34] it's not it's not contaminated with
[1:52:36] unbelieving spirits it's not it's not
[1:52:39] contaminated with the god saying well
[1:52:41] yeah you can't do that that's not
[1:52:44] supposed to be today and this ain't
[1:52:45] supposed to be happening that ain't and
[1:52:47] then putting rules to what the Holy
[1:52:48] Ghost can do
[1:52:50] can you say amen that's right if it's in
[1:52:53] the Bible the Holy Ghost still does it
[1:52:56] if they can do it you can do it
[1:52:58] I believe if Peter walked on the water
[1:53:00] you can do it
[1:53:02] hello and I ain't even going to
[1:53:04] spiritualize all that I I I'm saying if
[1:53:07] you need a literal uh a way to get over
[1:53:10] some water for some reason God can sow
[1:53:13] anoint you to you walk on that water or
[1:53:15] he can park the waters I don't care how
[1:53:17] he does it he just still can do them
[1:53:20] things
[1:53:22] God is God
[1:53:25] and you say Amen
[1:53:27] you love him
[1:53:29] so again it was word bread that fell on
[1:53:33] the day of Pentecost
[1:53:34] and Peter identified in the word as to
[1:53:37] what was taken place notice the people
[1:53:40] that were on the sidelines
[1:53:42] were All Amazed and we're in doubt
[1:53:47] saying to one another what meaneth this
[1:53:49] others mocked it saying these men are
[1:53:50] full of new wine
[1:53:52] but Peter in Acts 2 15 said these are
[1:53:54] not drunken as you supposing it is but
[1:53:56] the third hour of the day
[1:53:58] but notice but this is that
[1:54:01] which was spoken by the prophet Joel
[1:54:06] so he identified the experience with the
[1:54:08] word
[1:54:10] and you say Amen
[1:54:12] so showing that it was word bread that
[1:54:16] fell that day
[1:54:18] now we we quoted it uh but the church
[1:54:22] the prophet said the church natural
[1:54:24] don't want to be pregnated with the word
[1:54:26] because them screaming hollering blabber
[1:54:29] in Acts 2 38 miserable creatures she
[1:54:32] thinks they are see it's the only it's
[1:54:35] the only kind that the word can produce
[1:54:39] she don't want that being pregnant with
[1:54:42] that word and I'll be honest with you I
[1:54:44] don't care what age you're in and what
[1:54:46] word we're in and all of that that's
[1:54:48] what the word produces not some
[1:54:50] intellectual Bunch or crowd of people
[1:54:52] that we just sit there without an
[1:54:55] experience
[1:54:59] then you say Amen
[1:55:05] it produces it
[1:55:08] the word produces it screaming
[1:55:11] that's what the prophet says screaming
[1:55:14] hollering blabbering Acts 2 38 right
[1:55:20] you can amend that now
[1:55:22] that's what your Prophet said don't we
[1:55:24] won't we won't twist that we won't
[1:55:25] misinterpret that that's what the
[1:55:27] brother Branham said that's the only
[1:55:29] kind that the word can produce
[1:55:32] and the prophet says again the modern
[1:55:35] Church doesn't want any of this here
[1:55:37] screaming shouting tongues speaking Acts
[1:55:39] 2 38 youngins around her see she don't
[1:55:42] want any of them whooping and crying and
[1:55:44] screaming amen hallelujah she doesn't
[1:55:47] want that but that was the manna that
[1:55:50] fell and that's the manner that you can
[1:55:51] partake of
[1:55:53] that's not contaminated
[1:55:56] that's not what came from a Pentecostal
[1:55:58] age that came from a Pentecostal
[1:56:00] experience
[1:56:04] and you say Amen
[1:56:06] you love him
[1:56:08] the Lord is so wonderful
[1:56:10] amen now I'm getting ready to close
[1:56:13] but the prophet said he started on the
[1:56:14] day of Pentecost to build another
[1:56:16] Masterpiece The Original Seed word seed
[1:56:19] word
[1:56:20] started in the first church what was it
[1:56:23] the seed word the word manifest did
[1:56:25] everybody say the word manifested
[1:56:27] the promise that had been given
[1:56:31] see so the seed had perfect life in it
[1:56:34] because it was the life of Jesus Christ
[1:56:39] and the prophet said the life that was
[1:56:40] in Jesus was in the first church and
[1:56:43] they taught the pure word of God
[1:56:46] it wasn't mixed with denominations it
[1:56:49] wasn't mixed with traditions this was
[1:56:52] the original Church
[1:56:54] and you say man
[1:56:57] so their faith wasn't in the Creed it
[1:56:59] wasn't in a Dogma but it was in the
[1:57:01] presence of Jesus Christ brother Brown
[1:57:03] said they had Faith to heal the sick
[1:57:04] cast out Devils do Miracles and we still
[1:57:07] have that faith
[1:57:09] and all the great promises that Jesus
[1:57:11] made that first church held on to that
[1:57:15] now where he said it was there it was
[1:57:17] the lifeline ain't that right now we
[1:57:20] know that we're in an age where it's
[1:57:22] going to require greater Faith than ever
[1:57:25] but you cannot have that greater Faith
[1:57:27] than ever and deny white little faith
[1:57:29] they had if they had a faith to heal the
[1:57:31] sick we ought to have the faith to heal
[1:57:33] the sick as well if they had the faith
[1:57:36] to cast out Devils we must have that
[1:57:38] Faith as well
[1:57:40] brother Graham said we want to have
[1:57:42] faith for rapture we can't even have
[1:57:43] faith for a headache you understand what
[1:57:46] I'm saying so so the faith grows the
[1:57:49] faith has grown to where we're actually
[1:57:51] receiving the greatest Faith ever than
[1:57:54] any church age or whatever it's the it's
[1:57:57] the greatest for this is rapturing age
[1:58:01] and it has rapturing faith
[1:58:05] amen
[1:58:07] well praise the Lord
[1:58:09] all right if the musicians will come
[1:58:12] how do we know that it was a word seed
[1:58:15] because everything they'd done was based
[1:58:17] on the word
[1:58:20] how was it a word seed that was planted
[1:58:22] everything they'd done was based on the
[1:58:24] word
[1:58:25] can you say man now again there are
[1:58:28] people that don't believe in Divine
[1:58:29] Healing
[1:58:30] that ain't word seed
[1:58:32] they don't believe in speaking in
[1:58:33] tongues that's not word seed they don't
[1:58:35] believe in laying hands on the sick they
[1:58:36] don't believe in casting out Devils it's
[1:58:38] that's not word seed
[1:58:40] and you say man
[1:58:41] because look what was the first
[1:58:43] commission that Jesus gave his disciples
[1:58:45] Matthew 10 and 1 and when he had called
[1:58:47] unto him his twelve disciples he gave
[1:58:50] them power against unclean spirits to
[1:58:52] cast them out and heal all manner of
[1:58:54] sickness and all manner disease so the
[1:58:57] very first thing the prophet said of the
[1:58:59] Gospel is Divine Healing and casting out
[1:59:01] Devils ain't that right so he says then
[1:59:04] says what was the commission that Jesus
[1:59:07] gave to the church the last commission
[1:59:09] Mark 16 15 and he said unto them go into
[1:59:12] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:59:15] every creature
[1:59:17] mm-hmm he that Believers and is baptized
[1:59:20] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[1:59:23] shall be damned and these signs shall
[1:59:25] follow them that belief
[1:59:28] and you say Amen how many believers do
[1:59:30] we have we got Believers now that we we
[1:59:34] may be very few out in the world as far
[1:59:36] as worldwide a man Believers and that's
[1:59:39] why we ain't got healing campaigns and
[1:59:41] all of these things and and and that
[1:59:43] that that was that was for brother
[1:59:45] Brandon's Ministry if you want to put it
[1:59:46] that way uh and we'll get it more into
[1:59:48] that but but but
[1:59:50] every believer this is talking about to
[1:59:53] believers this ain't talking about
[1:59:55] worldwide this is talking if you're a
[1:59:57] Believer this is what follows
[2:00:01] then you say Amen see we're preaching
[2:00:04] the gospel ain't that right
[2:00:07] not just playing tapes
[2:00:10] we're preaching the gospel
[2:00:12] rotary we're called to that and no man
[2:00:15] gonna take us out of the pulpits
[2:00:21] and when we preach the gospel
[2:00:25] pastors evangelists teachers apostles
[2:00:30] profits you're preaching the gospel
[2:00:33] these things happen to everyone that
[2:00:36] believeth
[2:00:38] ain't that right
[2:00:40] in my name they shall cast out Devils
[2:00:42] they shall speak with new tongues they
[2:00:43] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[2:00:45] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[2:00:48] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[2:00:50] they shall recover
[2:00:52] and so what was the last thing heal the
[2:00:54] sick and cast out devils that is the
[2:00:56] message to the church ain't that right
[2:00:58] these signs shall follow every creature
[2:01:00] in all the world that is a Believer they
[2:01:03] shall cast out Devils they shall speak
[2:01:05] with new tongues that's a promise to
[2:01:08] every age not just to the day of
[2:01:10] Pentecost
[2:01:11] but every believer
[2:01:14] can you say Amen
[2:01:16] oh do you love him
[2:01:18] I hope it's helped you today
[2:01:20] amen
[2:01:23] oh I love him
[2:01:25] Lord is so good to us
[2:01:32] there's ever a time to be on fire for
[2:01:34] the lord it's now
[2:01:36] is there is ever a time to believe in
[2:01:38] the power of God it's now
[2:01:40] we're being challenged on every Hand by
[2:01:42] Devils whether in your mind whether it's
[2:01:46] trying to eat come to your children your
[2:01:48] spouse
[2:01:49] whether you're you're you're dealing
[2:01:51] with them at work at school and wherever
[2:01:53] it's at
[2:01:55] demons just everywhere and and the
[2:01:57] prophet already told us how it was
[2:02:00] Unleashed
[2:02:02] can you say man
[2:02:04] and and it's Unleashed in the Civil uh
[2:02:06] what is it the ecclesiastical rim
[2:02:09] and these things
[2:02:11] and if we don't believe
[2:02:13] that that that in in casting Devils out
[2:02:17] we're going to stand helpless
[2:02:19] we don't believe that we have that same
[2:02:21] power
[2:02:23] ain't that right
[2:02:25] then then we're going to just stand
[2:02:27] helpless
[2:02:28] but I I if I can just
[2:02:31] encourage you and and to bring to your
[2:02:35] remembrance that you are a believer
[2:02:38] you don't have to knock down to the
[2:02:40] devil you don't have to you don't have
[2:02:42] to answer to him
[2:02:43] you don't have to let him just defeat
[2:02:46] you and and just look like it's all
[2:02:48] hopeless even if your back is against
[2:02:50] the wall and you don't know what to do
[2:02:52] you still have hope
[2:02:54] can you say man for you're a believer
