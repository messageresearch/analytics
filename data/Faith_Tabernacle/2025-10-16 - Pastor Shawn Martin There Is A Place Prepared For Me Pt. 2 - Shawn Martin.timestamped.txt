[30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um
[30:50] bless the name of the Lord.
[30:58] We had uh I had spoke on this um read
[31:03] this scripture I guess last Wednesday
[31:06] and um I would like to
[31:10] uh just read it again
[31:13] starting at the first verse says let not
[31:16] your heart be troubled you believe in
[31:19] God believe also in me
[31:23] in my father's house are many mansions.
[31:25] If it were not so, I would have told
[31:27] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[31:32] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[31:35] I will come again and receive you unto
[31:39] myself, that where I am, there you may
[31:42] be also.
[31:45] Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in
[31:47] prayer. Father,
[31:49] Lord, we're
[31:51] comforting to know, Lord, that
[31:55] you are able. You're able to take any
[31:59] situation,
[32:01] Lord, work it out for the good. And
[32:05] Father, that's why we can trust you and
[32:09] be at rest, Father, and help us to be
[32:11] so. Now I pray, Father, that you would
[32:14] just take what simple words we'd have
[32:17] tonight and Lord just speak to your
[32:20] people, Father, as you have multiplied
[32:23] the fish and loaves, may you take the
[32:25] words and multiply,
[32:28] Father, and create something that is may
[32:32] be lacking within us, Lord. And uh and
[32:37] you can do that by your word. We ask
[32:40] that you'd bless the the people that are
[32:42] here. Father, may we just get caught up
[32:45] in heavenly places in Jesus Christ's
[32:49] name.
[32:50] Amen. And amen.
[32:53] You can have your seats. Praise the
[32:55] Lord. And um so uh if I were to use a
[33:01] title
[33:02] u again I would uh there is a place
[33:05] prepared for me
[33:08] and the scripture
[33:11] is a
[33:13] uh words of comfort
[33:16] uh here that we have just read uh Jesus
[33:20] talking about our future
[33:23] uh and and it's is the future to every
[33:26] believer. And I, you know, the word
[33:29] future means something that is to be
[33:33] existing or occurring at a later time,
[33:37] specifically
[33:39] uh after death. Existing after death.
[33:43] And um and so Jesus is letting uh not
[33:49] only his disciples know but letting the
[33:52] believer know that uh there is life
[33:55] after death that that when a man dies
[34:00] it's it's not the end and there is a
[34:03] land where we go that uh a man lives and
[34:08] and never dies. Yeah.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; And I I think that's powerful, you know,
[34:14] uh because men and women are trying to
[34:19] uh extend life.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Uh they're, you know, using the science
[34:24] and they're using all kinds of things to
[34:26] make life here better. And yet they want
[34:29] to remain young. And and we know that it
[34:33] it it's impossible for that to be here
[34:35] in this life. But Jesus says that there
[34:38] is a place to go.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; And so when when this life is over, then
[34:44] as the prophet said, there's a life that
[34:46] we go into.
[34:49] And it's it's a continuation
[34:52] of this same life in another world,
[34:55] another place.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; So then the believer doesn't go out of
[34:59] existence when he or she dies. and and
[35:03] we're we we know that we're living in a
[35:07] great time. It's a it's an important
[35:10] time. It's it's an awesome time to the
[35:13] believer because the prophet says that
[35:16] we're we're at a time where time is
[35:19] blending uh with eternity.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Uh which tells us that the rapture is at
[35:26] hand. I I know that through years, you
[35:30] know, um, no doubt, well, Paul even
[35:34] talked about the rapture and and being
[35:36] caught up in and this is something that
[35:39] we've all talked about, we've we've
[35:41] lived for, our ancestors have talked
[35:44] about it, believed in, and and all of
[35:46] these things. But I we can see more more
[35:51] that that that were here at at the time
[35:55] of rapture.
[35:56] And every believer looks forward to the
[36:00] rapture. Are you looking forward to it?
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're we're looking forward to
[36:05] this time. And be because we cannot go
[36:10] to the place that Christ has prepared
[36:13] for us uh unless we go into the rapture.
[36:18] Amen. Uh to be partake of it. So, so
[36:21] we're we're looking uh for this this
[36:24] event of of the rapture and and even
[36:28] those who have gone before us. Amen. Uh
[36:32] they're waiting uh uh for the rapture.
[36:35] They're they're they're waiting for this
[36:37] time uh because they can't partake of
[36:42] the things that all the things that have
[36:44] been prepared
[36:46] &gt;&gt; uh without the rapture. And and so
[36:50] that's Paul would say that they without
[36:52] us cannot be made perfect. And brother
[36:54] Brandham used that scripture for for
[36:56] this day and and the saints that have uh
[36:59] the New Testament saints that have
[37:01] throughout the ages, they they cannot be
[37:04] made perfect without us. And so, uh,
[37:07] first Thessalonians 4:16 says, "For the
[37:11] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[37:13] with a shout, with the voice of the
[37:15] archangel and with the trump of God, and
[37:18] the dead in Christ shall rise first."
[37:22] So, those that are already gone on,
[37:25] they're going to rise and be part of
[37:28] this rapture. Can you say amen? And then
[37:31] when we which are alive and remaining
[37:35] shall be caught up together with him in
[37:37] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[37:40] and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; So we we know that this event's going to
[37:47] happen any time.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Look look look at the things that has
[37:50] taken place.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's u I I know that's not a
[37:55] sign for us as believer. We've received
[37:57] our sign,
[37:58] &gt;&gt; but yet it it's it's just uh things that
[38:01] are letting us know just how close we
[38:04] really are.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; We we see that the lamb has has loosed
[38:09] the seven seals and the book is now
[38:12] open. How many believe that?
[38:14] &gt;&gt; And so the prophet would tell us, he
[38:17] says the lamb came, amen, for what he
[38:20] had redeemed. the lamb came and and and
[38:23] notice what Jesus said in our opening
[38:26] scripture. I go away, amen, to prepare a
[38:29] place. Uh uh but I'll come again and
[38:33] receive you unto myself. So he says the
[38:36] lamb came. Amen. When he opened that
[38:39] book, when when he took the book from
[38:42] him that sat upon the throne, loosened
[38:45] them seals and and and and and
[38:48] descended. Uh uh the lamb came for what
[38:51] he had redeemed. He come to claim what
[38:55] he had redeemed. He's already got it
[38:58] right here in the book, taken it from
[39:01] his hand. Now he's coming to receive
[39:05] &gt;&gt; what he has redeemed.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; That's that's his work. He's done. He's
[39:11] come to receive it. Ain't that right? So
[39:15] So Jesus says, "I will receive you unto
[39:18] myself." So he has come to claim his
[39:22] inheritance. The prophet said, uh, the
[39:24] church, the bride, ain't that right? And
[39:28] and we know that the mighty angel of
[39:30] revelations 1 has descended with that
[39:33] open book and he has declared that time
[39:37] shall be no more.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Time shall be no more. Now that's that's
[39:42] that's significant to us. Amen. And and
[39:45] so the prophet says the seventh seal is
[39:49] the end of time for all things.
[39:52] Everything runs out in this time. the
[39:55] end of the the of the seventh seal. He
[39:58] said, notice it's the end of the church
[40:00] age. It's the end of the seven seals.
[40:02] It's the end of the trumpets. It's the
[40:04] end of the vials. It's even ends the
[40:07] ushering in of the millennium. That's on
[40:10] the seventh seal. He said it's just like
[40:13] firing a rocket into the air. That
[40:15] rocket explodes here and it goes up.
[40:17] Then it explodes again. It puts out five
[40:20] stars and one of the stars explodes and
[40:23] blows out five stars from it and then
[40:26] one of them stars explodes and blows out
[40:29] five stars from it and it fades on out.
[40:32] That's what the seventh seal. See, he
[40:34] says it just ends the time for the
[40:37] world. It ends the time for this. It
[40:39] means the end of time for that. It ends
[40:42] the time for this. It ends the time.
[40:45] Everything just ended up on that seventh
[40:48] seal. And we know that that we're part
[40:51] of that seven seal that that that seal
[40:53] is open. And and brother Brandham says
[40:56] the seventh seal opens the coming of
[40:59] Christ.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So So he comes, I will come again
[41:05] and receive you unto myself. Well, the
[41:08] seventh seal opens this up.
[41:11] He also said that the second coming is
[41:14] the rapture.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is the rapture. So the the rapture
[41:21] happens under that seventh seal.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; And we know the rapture is the believer
[41:26] being caught up uh to meet the Lord in
[41:29] the air. And I believe with all of my
[41:32] heart, and I'm I'm sure you do, too,
[41:34] that there are people living on on earth
[41:37] today that will never taste death. and
[41:40] and that are going to receive a change
[41:43] in their body. And I I just believe in
[41:47] that. I I'm I believe that's how close
[41:49] we are that that it could happen just
[41:52] today. It could happen Amen. before we
[41:55] get out of church. It it it could
[41:57] happen. Amen. And and them people the
[42:00] people are going to be changed from
[42:03] mortal to immortality and and they're
[42:05] going to be caught away. Ain't that
[42:07] right? And then there's the those that
[42:09] are left behind, they're they're going
[42:11] to go into the great tribulation. And
[42:14] and so and and we realize that both
[42:17] events are upon us. The people that that
[42:21] are uh headed toward tribulation, the
[42:24] prophet said they're getting in the
[42:26] spirit. And I say they are in the spirit
[42:28] for this this event. But but the people
[42:32] that's going in in the rapture, they're
[42:35] in the spirit for such an event.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, uh, we we find a scripture
[42:42] that seems to be more standing out to us
[42:45] today, uh, than any other time, and
[42:48] that's 1 Thessalonians 5:1 through3. But
[42:52] of the times and the seasons, brethren,
[42:54] you have no need that I write unto you.
[42:57] For yourselves know perfectly that the
[42:59] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[43:02] the night.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; For when they shall say, "Peace and
[43:05] safety."
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Is that not what
[43:09] they're doing today? Peace and safety.
[43:12] Peace and safety. are they're they're
[43:14] they're they're they're pushing our
[43:15] president to get the Nobel Prize and
[43:18] saying he should have got it and and
[43:20] everybody applauding him for for for
[43:22] working peace in the Middle East and and
[43:25] all of these things. But notice now then
[43:28] sudden destruction cometh upon them as
[43:32] travail upon a woman with child and they
[43:35] shall not escape. This is the
[43:38] tribulation.
[43:40] Can you say amen? God's wrath is going
[43:43] to be poured upon the people. But just
[43:46] before this happens, the rapture will
[43:49] take place.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So remember what Jesus
[43:54] said. I will come again.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; I will come again. Don't forget that
[43:59] now. I will come again.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; And receive you unto myself that where I
[44:07] am, there you may be also.
[44:11] Now, I believe this coming, amen, is is
[44:15] what Jesus spoke of in Luke 2:17. And
[44:19] then they shall see the Son of Man
[44:21] coming in a cloud with power and great
[44:25] glory.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[44:28] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that they'll recognize
[44:30] him as the son of man, but they'll see
[44:32] it.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Here's another one. I I believe it's
[44:38] tied to Luke 17:30. the son of man being
[44:40] revealed. And we know that the son of
[44:42] man is is Christ. Ain't that right? And
[44:46] and so now many believe that uh Jesus
[44:50] will come to earth in his physical
[44:53] stature of what he was of 2,000 years
[44:56] ago when he walked the earth. But that's
[44:58] not what Jesus promised. Because here in
[45:02] John 14:18,
[45:04] he says, "I will not leave you
[45:05] comfortless. I will come to you." Is
[45:08] that what he says?
[45:10] &gt;&gt; I will come to you. Remember he says, I
[45:13] will I go up to prepare a place, but I
[45:16] will come again and receive you unto
[45:20] myself. And then now we're reading uh uh
[45:24] uh verses uh that that was John 14:1-3
[45:28] that we are opening scripture. Now this
[45:30] is John 8 14:18.
[45:32] I will not leave you comfortless. I will
[45:35] come to you yet a little while while and
[45:38] the world seeth me no more but you see
[45:40] me because I live you shall live also
[45:44] and at that day you shall know that I'm
[45:47] in my father you in me and I in you the
[45:52] world seeth me no more they will not
[45:54] recognize him but you will know can you
[45:58] say amen so what does this mean it's
[46:00] it's the mystery that Paul talked about
[46:03] Christ in you the hope of glory.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. This this coming is a mystery to
[46:10] the world.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; But but to those that he comes to, they
[46:14] have the revelation of who he is, where
[46:17] he is. You will know that I'm in my
[46:20] father, you in me, and I in you.
[46:26] The world will not see him but the bride
[46:29] will have the revelation
[46:31] &gt;&gt; of him being in the father. Amen. And
[46:34] and us in him and he in us.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; We have come as we know simple things
[46:46] simple now uh that we've listened to the
[46:50] message but the prophet said we've come
[46:52] through the age of Luther. We've come
[46:54] through the age of sanctification of
[46:55] Wesley. We've come through the age of
[46:58] Pentecost. But notice he says, "Now we
[47:01] come to the head, the capstone." Who's
[47:04] the capstone? Christ. He's the head.
[47:06] Ain't that right? Zechariah talks about
[47:09] it. The head coming and and the
[47:11] headstone. And he says, "See grace.
[47:14] Grace. The capstone cried. See the
[47:17] headstone crying what? Grace. grace
[47:20] passed from death and creed into a
[47:24] living word of the living God. God's
[47:27] only provided plan for his age. His sons
[47:31] in the word age, quickened by the spirit
[47:34] like a spark that's lit off something to
[47:36] make it alive
[47:38] &gt;&gt; and seated now in heavenly places in
[47:40] present tense already alive and subject
[47:43] to every promise in the word. Then what
[47:46] does that do? You being a part of God's
[47:49] gene, a part of the word, other men, a
[47:52] part of God's word, seated together,
[47:55] manifests the entire body of Christ.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So now, the prophet
[48:02] called it the bride coming of Christ.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? It manifests the
[48:07] entire body because there's no living
[48:10] among you. See just the word only seated
[48:14] in heavenly places in the door where he
[48:17] put his name Christ Jesus. Now notice he
[48:21] says no leaven among you. That brings
[48:23] the entire fullness of the godhead
[48:26] bodily among you.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Couldn't do it in Luther's age. Couldn't
[48:31] do it in Wesley's age. Couldn't do it in
[48:33] the Pentecostal age. But in the day when
[48:36] the son of man will be manifest,
[48:39] revealed, brought back the church
[48:41] together with the entire deity of God
[48:45] amongst his people, showing the same
[48:48] visible signs, manifesting himself like
[48:51] he did at the beginning when he was
[48:54] manifested on earth in a form of a
[48:56] prophet God. Can you say amen?
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my. See, so another place he said,
[49:02] see the Holy Spirit is here on earth
[49:05] looking out these individuals that God
[49:08] has ordained to life in this age. And as
[49:12] soon as it finds it, it does just like
[49:14] it did on Jesus Christ, the great super
[49:17] son of God who redeemed us all. So what
[49:21] did it do to Jesus Christ? What did it
[49:23] do? It quickened him.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? When when the spirit
[49:30] of God came into him, it quickened him
[49:34] to where he manifested every promise of
[49:38] the word that was promised for his day.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; That spoke of Messiah
[49:44] &gt;&gt; so much that he was the word made flesh.
[49:46] Do you believe that?
[49:47] &gt;&gt; So now the prophet talking of our day,
[49:50] the Holy Spirit has come down to
[49:53] quicken, make alive those people. That's
[49:57] for ordained of God to be in the
[50:00] rapture.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; He said that is, see, notice that is if
[50:05] he's a true eagle, he will understand
[50:07] the message of the hour. If he's a true
[50:10] eagle,
[50:11] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[50:12] &gt;&gt; So, I will come I will come again and
[50:15] receive you.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; And he tells us directly where he's
[50:21] coming to.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; I will come to you. Right.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; And the prophet is saying it's a
[50:26] quickening power.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; That quickens us
[50:31] &gt;&gt; to get us ready for a rapture.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[50:36] So, brother Brandham says in another
[50:39] quote, "Can't can you see the son of
[50:41] man?" The son of man in the form of
[50:44] prophetic message returning back again
[50:46] in his church in prophecy revealing
[50:50] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[50:53] and forever. It's never been done
[50:56] through the age till this time. It
[50:59] wasn't done on in the first stage. It
[51:02] wasn't done at the day of Pentecost. I
[51:05] know they they they they saying that
[51:07] that the son of man was revealed on the
[51:09] day of Pentecost. That is contrary to
[51:11] the Bible. There's only one time that
[51:14] the son of man is to be manifested or
[51:17] revealed and that's in the days of Noah
[51:20] like it was in the days of Noah. Like it
[51:22] was in the days of Lot which speaks of
[51:25] our day.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Now notice
[51:29] notice how he describes this. He says,
[51:31] "Now I saw seven angels come." He's
[51:34] talking about the event that happened in
[51:36] Tucson. I saw seven angels come. Didn't
[51:40] Life magazine pack it
[51:43] &gt;&gt; and the fall as the fog of it floated
[51:45] across here 27 mi high, 30 m across. He
[51:50] said, "Is not Fred Sothman, these other
[51:52] Gene Norman sitting back there, stood
[51:55] right there with them? Seven angels
[51:58] appeared right there on the hill. It
[52:01] shook the heels for miles around like
[52:03] that. There stood seven angels and
[52:07] throwed a sword in your hand and said,
[52:09] "Go home. Open the seven seals that are
[52:12] given." And here they are. The true
[52:15] mystery of marriage and divorce and the
[52:17] serpent seed and all of these things
[52:20] that's been fussed about. It's thus
[52:22] sayaith the Lord.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Notice the question. What is it?
[52:27] the quickening power coming to the
[52:29] church, making her ready
[52:33] &gt;&gt; this hour that we're approaching its
[52:36] quickening power.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Then the prophet says in another place,
[52:43] if it is the true Holy Spirit that has
[52:47] come to you, it'll manifest the promise
[52:50] of the hour.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Now, we know what it is. It's the token.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; So
[53:02] that's the true token that we're going
[53:05] in the rapture.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Is the word being made manifest for this
[53:11] hour.
[53:12] So now Jesus I I truly believe and I'm
[53:16] not doing away with the the corporal
[53:19] body as you know
[53:21] &gt;&gt; but I truly believe that Jesus has come
[53:24] &gt;&gt; to receive us.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen
[53:27] &gt;&gt; because there is a place that he has
[53:32] prepared for us.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[53:36] The Bible
[53:38] doesn't only foretell
[53:41] of uh events that are to happen in this
[53:44] mortal life,
[53:46] but it foretells of things and events
[53:49] that cannot be seen with the natural
[53:51] eye. Neither can they be known by the
[53:56] carnal mind and can't be understood. And
[53:59] this is why Paul would say in 1
[54:01] Corinthians 2:9, "But as it is written,
[54:04] I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither
[54:07] has it entered into the heart of man the
[54:10] things." Everybody say, "The things
[54:12] which God hath prepared for them that
[54:15] love him."
[54:17] &gt;&gt; But God hath revealed them unto us by
[54:20] his spirit. For the Spirit searchth all
[54:23] things, yay, the deep things of God. For
[54:26] what man knoweth the things of a man,
[54:28] save the spirit of man that is in him?
[54:30] Even so the things of God knoweth no
[54:33] man, but the spirit of God. Notice, we
[54:35] have now we have received not the spirit
[54:37] of the world, but the spirit which is of
[54:40] God that we might know the things
[54:43] &gt;&gt; that are prepared
[54:47] &gt;&gt; and that are freely given to us
[54:50] &gt;&gt; of God.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Things that the the carnal mind
[54:54] doesn't know about.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Things that the natural eye cannot see.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Things that cannot be heard with the
[55:02] natural ear. And yet it's there.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The Bible talks about
[55:10] things that
[55:12] couldn't be detected detected by the
[55:14] carnal mind. It had to be revealed. And
[55:19] you know uh
[55:22] ju Revelations 21:2
[55:25] it says that I John saw the Holy Spirit
[55:29] or holy city new Jerusalem coming down
[55:32] from God out of heaven. Ain't that
[55:35] right?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Out of heaven. Now now think of this
[55:39] that years beforehand
[55:43] Abraham the Bible says look for a city.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now think of it. Never been there.
[55:50] A carnal flesh and blood man.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Full of mistakes.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; And yet he's looking for a city
[56:00] &gt;&gt; whose builder and maker is God.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says he thought the city
[56:08] was upon earth and he went searching all
[56:12] over. He met the king of this city,
[56:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:16] &gt;&gt; And he had communion. The prophet said
[56:19] he had communion with the king on the
[56:21] very spot.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; That that city's going to come on down
[56:25] on
[56:26] &gt;&gt; think of that.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; But it was by revelation that he caught
[56:31] it.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; There's a city somewhere.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; There there's somewhere.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, years later, John
[56:40] is caught up in the spirit on the Lord's
[56:43] day.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; I truly believe this day.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; And he says in in Revelations 21:2, "And
[56:52] I, John, saw the holy city, New
[56:54] Jerusalem, coming down from God out of
[56:58] heaven, prepared."
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Everybody say, "Prepared."
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Prepared. As a bride adorned for her
[57:06] husband,
[57:08] The city is 1500 square miles, the
[57:11] prophet would tell us. And we can't see
[57:13] it, but he's gone to prepare it.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? In Revelations 21:18,
[57:19] John describes this city. The building
[57:22] of the wall of it was of jasper, and the
[57:25] city was pure gold likened to clear
[57:27] glass. And the foundations of the wall
[57:30] of the city were garnished with all
[57:32] manner of precious stones. The first
[57:34] foundation was jasper. the second
[57:37] Sapphire and the third um uh
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Caledon.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; That one
[57:45] Caledon.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Get it?
[57:49] and the fourth foundation and emerald
[57:51] and the fifth sardonics and and the
[57:54] sixth uh sardius and the seventh uh
[58:00] &gt;&gt; crystalite and the eighth barrel and the
[58:03] ninth topaz I guess tupaz the 10th a
[58:09] &gt;&gt; boy I'm brother Terry I'm glad you made
[58:12] it tonight
[58:15] so that one and the 11th uh jasinth I
[58:20] guess and the 12th um
[58:24] &gt;&gt; amethyst and the 12 gates were 12 pearls
[58:28] and several every several gate was of of
[58:32] one pearl in the street of the city was
[58:34] pure gold as it were transparent glass
[58:38] &gt;&gt; it's it's specifically prepared
[58:42] and and the prophet said the divine
[58:44] architect has prepared and designed
[58:47] behind this city with tender hands
[58:51] &gt;&gt; for his beloved bride.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; He's preparing for us,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; his bride.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Ram says, "What a
[59:02] place it must be when divine nature, a
[59:06] divine architect has divine designed it
[59:09] for a divine attribute, that's you,
[59:13] that's been divinely predestinated by a
[59:16] divine God who is the author of divine
[59:19] life."
[59:21] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't use the things of the
[59:23] earth to make it. He just creates it.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; He doesn't use the gold of this earth.
[59:30] He just creates the goat. Can you say
[59:33] amen? And and we know that this earth is
[59:36] going to receive a baptism of fire. It's
[59:39] the prophet said it's a holy fire from
[59:41] God. And this fire is to cleanse it from
[59:44] sin, from sickness, from uh uh diseased
[59:48] germs, from sinners, from the devil, and
[59:50] all of his group.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; And there God will be with his true
[59:56] attributes.
[59:58] Aren't you glad for that?
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; The trials that we go through, no more
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; the the enemy that we deal with every
[1:00:06] day. No more
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; uh no more anguish, no more tears, no
[1:00:11] more heartaches and no more trials. All
[1:00:14] of these things is is going to be over
[1:00:17] with.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; You'll never have to deal with him
[1:00:23] again. That's right.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; And God there in that place
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; that God has prepared there will God be
[1:00:34] with his true attribute sons and
[1:00:36] daughters where he can fellowship with
[1:00:38] them in holiness with their eyes blinded
[1:00:41] to any sin. There will never be no more
[1:00:44] sin from there on. All right.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Now to think of this. Romans 8:1 19 Paul
[1:00:53] says, "For the earnest expectation of
[1:00:56] the creature waiteth for the
[1:00:57] manifestation of the sons of God."
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; For the creature was made subject to
[1:01:01] vanity, not willingly, but by reason of
[1:01:04] him who has subjected the same in hope.
[1:01:07] because the creature itself
[1:01:10] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[1:01:13] of corruption into the glorious liberty
[1:01:15] of the children of God. For we know that
[1:01:18] the whole creation groanth and travaleth
[1:01:21] in pain together into now. And not only
[1:01:25] they, but ourselves also, which have the
[1:01:27] first fruits of the spirit. In other
[1:01:29] words, those that have the Holy Ghost,
[1:01:31] we're groaning. Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Even ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:01:36] waiting for the adoption to wit the
[1:01:39] redemption of our body.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; You see, remember the lamb come. He
[1:01:46] opened the seal and he brought
[1:01:50] he descended to reveal the book. Prophet
[1:01:55] said he he come to give his inheritance
[1:01:58] to his people.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:02] Why are we groaning?
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Why are we groaning for something? Is
[1:02:08] because we've been given an inheritance.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So the prophet said he
[1:02:16] gives the inheritance that he inherited
[1:02:18] becoming kinsman redeemer and he freely
[1:02:21] gives it out to us. It all belonged to
[1:02:24] him. He was the one who redeemed. But
[1:02:26] instead of keeping it himself, he gives
[1:02:28] it back to the people. That's his love
[1:02:31] for us.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; And he has revealed in this age the
[1:02:39] things that he's prepared for us.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Things that we would have overlooked
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; reading the Bible and we'd never see it
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; with the carnal mind. But he has
[1:02:53] revealed it. That's right.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; He went to prepare this place because he
[1:03:00] knows we're going to be there. This
[1:03:03] isn't something that is uncertain. He
[1:03:05] knows who's going to be there. It's such
[1:03:08] a certain thing that he don't have to
[1:03:10] wait
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; before uh for us to arrive before he
[1:03:15] starts. He goes to prepare it. He's
[1:03:17] prepared for our arrival.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And we're groaning. Think of that now.
[1:03:22] We're groaning
[1:03:24] within ourselves for the full possession
[1:03:29] of what belongs to us. Full and complete
[1:03:34] redemption.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad that our soul's been
[1:03:41] redeemed.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; But this whole body's got to be
[1:03:43] redeemed.
[1:03:45] Glory.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Not only is the body going to be
[1:03:47] redeemed, but this earth has got to go
[1:03:50] through the process of complete
[1:03:52] redemption.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; So, this groaning within ourselves is
[1:04:02] what the prophet called birth painans.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Nature is groaning. We are groaning.
[1:04:10] Everything is groaning because we
[1:04:13] realize there's something not right.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that tonight?
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; There's something not right.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can groan and wait
[1:04:28] for it is because there has been new
[1:04:31] life come in. That speaks of a new
[1:04:34] world.
[1:04:36] That's the only way we can groan. If
[1:04:39] you're groaning tonight, waiting and
[1:04:42] groaning is because there's a new life
[1:04:44] that has come in. That's speaking of a
[1:04:47] new world.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, I will come to you and receive you.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; See, our natural man or this old flesh
[1:04:58] man doesn't groan
[1:05:01] because it's of the natural. It speaks
[1:05:05] of the natural. It's earthbound. It's
[1:05:07] earthly.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; It's earthly minded. It's carnal minded.
[1:05:12] Can you say amen?
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; See, and so our natural life doesn't
[1:05:16] speak of a new world. It only speaks of
[1:05:19] this old contaminated world.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; If we let this this life uh this carnal
[1:05:26] man rule us, we'll live in depression.
[1:05:28] We we will live without hope
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; because there's no groaning.
[1:05:36] We live in this mortal realm, a world of
[1:05:39] darkness and chaos.
[1:05:42] The prophet said we live in three
[1:05:44] dimensions, light, time, and matter. I
[1:05:46] believe
[1:05:48] so. This this is the world of humanity,
[1:05:51] of corruption, of mortality.
[1:05:55] All of these things and and the senses
[1:05:58] that God gave us can only contact this
[1:06:02] world,
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:06] only contacts this world. But then a
[1:06:09] prophet would come and tell us that
[1:06:11] there's other dimensions
[1:06:13] that are our five senses cannot contact.
[1:06:17] There's no way we could contact the
[1:06:19] other world.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; It's another world that exists. It's an
[1:06:25] unseen world. And the prophet said
[1:06:28] there's another world and you don't have
[1:06:30] to leave very far. It's right with you.
[1:06:34] It's It's right around you.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; It's just in another dimension.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; It and it seems like it's millions of
[1:06:42] miles away be because we have nothing to
[1:06:46] contact with.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And so mortal man just
[1:06:55] common
[1:06:56] sexorn
[1:06:58] uh mortal man is so oblivious to it.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; The sinner thinks that this is life. He
[1:07:09] lives for this life. He invests
[1:07:12] everything that he has, his energy, his
[1:07:14] time,
[1:07:16] everything into this life
[1:07:20] because he doesn't know that there's a
[1:07:21] greater life than this.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram called this body a pest
[1:07:28] house. He said, "We live in a pest
[1:07:30] house."
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; And and you know, I looked up the pest
[1:07:33] house. It's a shelter or hospital for
[1:07:35] those infected with with uh pest nential
[1:07:40] or whatever or contagious diseases.
[1:07:43] And and he says the pest house that we
[1:07:46] live in, it just catches every disease
[1:07:48] that floats through.
[1:07:53] kind of been dealing with that, you
[1:07:55] know, in this weather change, sore
[1:07:57] throat and all all of that cuz we just
[1:08:02] living in a pest house.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; He says it's just full of sickness and
[1:08:06] disease and disappointment and trouble.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; But Jesus has gone to prepare a place.
[1:08:17] Who who would want to stay in this old
[1:08:20] body?
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; How can they say we're in the millennium
[1:08:24] in this old body?
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; That that is this world is full of
[1:08:28] trouble.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; It's because they have not been able to
[1:08:34] contact that other world. So they're
[1:08:36] trying to make a millennium out of this.
[1:08:44] So he prepares a place and promises that
[1:08:47] he'd come back and receive us. Brother
[1:08:50] Ram said it's a perfect place. Everybody
[1:08:52] say it's a perfect place where no evil
[1:08:55] exists, no sickness exists, no age
[1:08:58] exists or no old age, no death exists.
[1:09:02] It's a perfect place calling you to that
[1:09:06] perfection.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; You know, there are fish
[1:09:13] that swim way down deep in the ocean, a
[1:09:16] mile deep or more,
[1:09:19] and they're just now discovering things
[1:09:23] in in the ocean. And you know, if you
[1:09:26] watch documentaries or whatever, it's
[1:09:28] really cool.
[1:09:30] And but you go way down, you know, they
[1:09:33] they go way down in there and they with
[1:09:35] their lights and stuff and and it's so
[1:09:38] pitch dark. It's it's it's just like ink
[1:09:42] black dark. Black ink dark or whatever.
[1:09:45] And and and these fish have no eyes
[1:09:50] because it'd be no good to them. They
[1:09:52] they can't see nothing. It would do no
[1:09:55] good because that's where they abide.
[1:09:59] and and so but they got to eat. And so
[1:10:01] they're guided by another sense uh radar
[1:10:06] or whatever
[1:10:08] to where they could they they they could
[1:10:10] go and find their their way through and
[1:10:14] and and eat and and these things and uh
[1:10:18] uh these things.
[1:10:21] But the prophet says, "What if a human
[1:10:26] could could control that fish with his
[1:10:30] sight?"
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, if I could do that," he
[1:10:35] said, "I I would be able to help that
[1:10:36] fish out to get more food than what it
[1:10:40] does. I I would be able to lead it
[1:10:42] around if I could control him with my
[1:10:45] sight because my sight is greater than
[1:10:48] the radar that he has.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; But see, it's impossible for for that
[1:10:59] fish to surrender itself over to
[1:11:03] humanity.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:07] But then the prophet says, "But what if
[1:11:09] we could only surrender ourselves to
[1:11:11] God?"
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Now we have that ability. The fish
[1:11:15] cannot surrender itself to humanity to
[1:11:18] where humanity could take over and
[1:11:20] control it. But we actually have the
[1:11:24] ability to surrender to God.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; And and his sight, his senses are far
[1:11:34] greater than ours. That's right.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; We can only our senses only contact this
[1:11:40] world.
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; But see, God could guide us better to
[1:11:48] where take us to things that are far
[1:11:51] better than our natural eyes and our
[1:11:53] natural senses can detect.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:58] Prophet says the faith that he supplies
[1:12:00] us uh is the evidence of things not seen
[1:12:04] with our eyes. Can you say amen? Now we
[1:12:08] know that that fish cannot come to the
[1:12:10] to the top of the water because he's
[1:12:13] pressurized to where he's to be where
[1:12:15] he's at. And and if he were to ever come
[1:12:17] up, he'd just explode.
[1:12:19] And and and the prophet says we can't go
[1:12:22] any higher than what we are because
[1:12:24] we're pressurized to live in the place
[1:12:27] that we're living. If we would go way up
[1:12:30] there, you know, we would explode and
[1:12:32] and these things without uh uh help and
[1:12:35] aid and things like that. See? See? And
[1:12:38] and so that fish, you know, the prophet
[1:12:41] said, "If that fish that lives way down
[1:12:43] in the ocean so dark, that's all he
[1:12:46] knows. If he could come up and be one of
[1:12:49] us,
[1:12:51] he would never want to be that little
[1:12:53] fish again.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; He would never want to go back into the
[1:12:57] darkness
[1:12:59] again and and be what he's always been.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. Because he has
[1:13:06] actually become something greater than
[1:13:09] than a fish. He's become a man and his
[1:13:12] senses are greater. His understanding is
[1:13:15] greater. His intelligence is greater.
[1:13:18] And brother Bram says, multiply that by
[1:13:20] 10 million. Then you get what it is.
[1:13:23] When you pass from this into the
[1:13:26] presence of God where the human being is
[1:13:29] so much, he says, farther than what we
[1:13:32] are here, he said, you'd never want to
[1:13:34] be a human being like this no more down
[1:13:37] in this pest house of sickness and
[1:13:40] corruption.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. But see, so so he says what we're
[1:13:47] trying to do is tell the people that
[1:13:51] there's a heaven to gain, a hell to
[1:13:54] shun, and there is a God that loves them
[1:13:57] and is there there's a redeeming power
[1:14:00] that's laying here ready to pick them up
[1:14:02] at any time. They're ready to receive
[1:14:05] it.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Now, the thing of it is is that fish has
[1:14:08] no desire to be one of us because it
[1:14:11] doesn't know us. It doesn't comprehend
[1:14:14] our world. It's used to its world. A
[1:14:18] world of darkness. A world of no light.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; You could try to talk to it and say,
[1:14:26] "Yeah, if you you you just need to be
[1:14:28] like I am, it it would have no desire."
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; A lot of times, God talks to humanity
[1:14:36] the same way.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; And man don't have that desire to come
[1:14:41] up. Can you say amen?
[1:14:45] Because there's nothing in that little
[1:14:47] fish. There's nothing within him calling
[1:14:50] for something greater. He doesn't know
[1:14:53] that there's a greater life than what
[1:14:55] he's living. And if he ain't got nothing
[1:14:58] in him calling for something greater,
[1:15:01] then he's just going to be what he is.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; See, it would have to be a life within
[1:15:09] him that's not part of him.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. a greater life than what
[1:15:13] he is.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Be in him calling for something calling
[1:15:18] for it. Can you say amen?
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; A life that doesn't come from his world.
[1:15:26] Now the place that Jesus has prepared is
[1:15:28] a fairy tale to the carnal mind.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; The rapture is a fairy tale. Everything
[1:15:34] that we talk about and live for it is
[1:15:37] just a fairy tale. And this is why the
[1:15:39] Christian life is very strange to the
[1:15:42] world. You know, men of old uh just like
[1:15:47] you and I, they they wrote of of the
[1:15:50] future and things that are to be. They
[1:15:53] had faults like you and me. They they
[1:15:55] went through discouragements like you
[1:15:57] and I have and and all that. But not
[1:16:00] only did they write of it, they were
[1:16:02] persuaded of it.
[1:16:05] the things the future. They wrote of the
[1:16:08] future. They wrote of these things that
[1:16:10] are to be and and they believed in it
[1:16:13] and were persuaded.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11:13. These all died in faith,
[1:16:19] not having received the promises, but
[1:16:21] having seen them a far off. Seen them a
[1:16:24] far off and were persuaded of them and
[1:16:28] embraced them and confessed that they
[1:16:31] were strangers and pilgrims on the
[1:16:33] earth. Can you say amen? Oh, do you love
[1:16:37] him?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; How how could natural men write of
[1:16:40] things that they cannot contact? They
[1:16:43] have no way to see with the natural eye.
[1:16:46] They have no way to understand uh th
[1:16:50] these things and and all of that. But
[1:16:52] here second Peter 1:21 gives the answer.
[1:16:56] For the prophecy came not in old time by
[1:16:59] the will of man, but holy men of God
[1:17:02] spake as they were moved by the Holy
[1:17:05] Spirit.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? A greater life than
[1:17:09] more than than mortal life came on them
[1:17:13] and began to speak through them of
[1:17:15] things that are to be.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Come on now.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful?
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:17:25] See, as Christians, we talk about things
[1:17:27] that do not exist in our world.
[1:17:30] We we we
[1:17:33] believe in them. We're persuaded of
[1:17:35] them.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Hey, church, there's going to be a
[1:17:37] marriage supper of the lamb.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a table
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; on
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; that we're going to set at
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; and we're going to be there when this
[1:17:56] world is under judgment.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Where is it? I don't know. But there's
[1:18:04] something in me that says it's there.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's come
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; to receive me.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; And he's in me and he's speaking of the
[1:18:18] things he's prepared.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; You going to sit at that marriage supper
[1:18:28] table.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; I'll be there.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said over and over, it's
[1:18:34] there that he's going to dry our eyes.
[1:18:35] Sister Janice,
[1:18:37] all of our tears and all that. And
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; he's going to come by every one of us
[1:18:42] sitting at that table. He's going to
[1:18:44] say, "Don't weep no more.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; It's over."
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for that. Amen. There
[1:18:56] there's a place where the saints have
[1:18:58] gone. They didn't go out of existence.
[1:19:01] They're there
[1:19:02] and and they're walking on solid ground.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon went up there.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; He was he was caught in over into the
[1:19:11] curtain of beyond the curtain of time
[1:19:13] and he saw them.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; They were running.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; They weren't just floating.
[1:19:20] They were somewhere and they weren't
[1:19:23] here.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; But he said wherever he was, he looked
[1:19:26] down. He could see that old body in the
[1:19:28] bed.
[1:19:30] He was in another body, for he had hair.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; And all of these people that had gone
[1:19:38] before, they were young again.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; They talked.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; They laughed.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; we sing and preach about heaven.
[1:19:56] And we're not speaking of some
[1:19:59] fictitious place, but heaven is a real
[1:20:02] place. Do you believe that?
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; It's just it's it's just as real as this
[1:20:09] is.
[1:20:11] And the prophet said, "For God started
[1:20:13] us in our spiritual growth in this
[1:20:15] place." He said, "We don't set up in
[1:20:18] heaven for eternity and just sit there
[1:20:19] on a cloud. We don't just strum our harp
[1:20:24] all from here ever, but we're going to a
[1:20:27] real place where we're going to do
[1:20:29] things where we're going to live. We're
[1:20:32] going to work. We're going to enjoy.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; We're going to live. We're going to life
[1:20:38] to a real eternal life. We're going to a
[1:20:41] heaven of paradise. Just like Adam and
[1:20:44] Eve worked and lived and ate and enjoyed
[1:20:47] and in the Garden of Eden before sin
[1:20:49] came, we're on our road right back there
[1:20:53] again. The first Adam through sin taken
[1:20:56] us out. The second Adam through
[1:20:57] righteousness brings us back in again.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; And truly, there's no way for a sinner
[1:21:06] to comprehend it.
[1:21:09] There's no way for just a religious man
[1:21:11] to comprehend these things.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But a believer has new
[1:21:18] life.
[1:21:20] And that life within him speaks of a new
[1:21:23] world.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Something that he would have never
[1:21:28] caught. But the life
[1:21:30] contacts him.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; He has contact with the outside world.
[1:21:37] Can you say amen?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; David described it as the deep calling
[1:21:42] unto the deep.
[1:21:44] Brother Ram said, "The same Holy Spirit
[1:21:46] that led the children of Israel is
[1:21:48] leading us up into that waters yonder
[1:21:51] somewhere."
[1:21:53] That same pillar of fire that led Israel
[1:21:57] is here leading us
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; to a land yonder somewhere.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; You believe it? Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; People can't understand it, but it's
[1:22:07] there. As long as a human heart calls
[1:22:10] for it, there's got to be something
[1:22:12] there to respond to it.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; The deep calls to the deep. I'll send
[1:22:17] mine angel before you to lead you into
[1:22:21] the way.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; We know these things. But new life comes
[1:22:28] by spiritual birth. And this this new
[1:22:31] life is not of this natural life. It
[1:22:34] doesn't speak of this natural life.
[1:22:37] And we know it that when a mother is
[1:22:40] expecting a child,
[1:22:43] most the time she begins to crave things
[1:22:46] that she normally wouldn't crave.
[1:22:50] But she craves something. It it's it's a
[1:22:52] life that's in her, but it's apart from
[1:22:55] her.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Her own life. It's it's another life.
[1:23:00] And and yet that life isn't different
[1:23:02] from her life because it's come through
[1:23:05] the same way her life has come through.
[1:23:07] A sexborn life. Ain't that right?
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; And and so that life conceived in her.
[1:23:15] Amen. It's of the earth. Ain't that
[1:23:18] right?
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; And and so the prophet talks about our
[1:23:22] natural birth being pre-planned by God.
[1:23:25] He knew that we were going to come. And
[1:23:27] and before we got here, before the first
[1:23:30] man came, God created this earth, God
[1:23:33] created everything for us.
[1:23:37] You believe it?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Everything for us. And then when the
[1:23:42] child is in that mother's womb, it's
[1:23:45] craving something. It ain't craving
[1:23:48] things from the from Mars. It ain't
[1:23:50] craving things from Jupiter. It ain't
[1:23:53] craving things from way off out in some
[1:23:55] alien space.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; It's craving things of the earth because
[1:24:01] God prepared the earth for it
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; for that baby for us. Can you say amen?
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And and so so here we find Amen. The
[1:24:12] prophet said, see it's her the body her
[1:24:14] body the calcium and so forth of her
[1:24:17] body the vitamins that she needs. Juny
[1:24:20] is being made up or we'll say Zane
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; is being made up and he craves for
[1:24:29] things foods for this coming child. How
[1:24:33] the parents they try to get it so the
[1:24:35] baby will be born as perfectly and happy
[1:24:38] as possible.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; See how your parents will do that when
[1:24:42] there's something needed the mother
[1:24:44] gives witness of it. her system is made
[1:24:46] up and that's how that when there's
[1:24:49] something needed here to the oncoming
[1:24:51] child, the mother begins to crave for
[1:24:54] it.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; But it's not her craving it. It's the
[1:24:57] life in her
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; that's calling for it.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; And they can get it because the earth
[1:25:07] was prepared
[1:25:09] for its arrival.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Hope you understand. Yeah.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Well, when when the life of God comes in
[1:25:17] us,
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; oh yeah,
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; it's not craving the bar,
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; it's not craving entertainment.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; It's not craving the things of this
[1:25:29] world.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; It's craving another world.
[1:25:37] And the only reason it can crave it is
[1:25:39] because there's a real place
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; that's been prepared.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; See, you have to have eternal life in
[1:25:53] order to be a son and daughter of God.
[1:25:58] You were born from your mother's womb,
[1:26:01] a child of your parents.
[1:26:05] But that didn't make you a child of God.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; You were just naturally born sexorn in a
[1:26:11] pest house that attracted all kinds of
[1:26:14] things. You had your faults, your
[1:26:17] mistakes, your scars, and you know, you
[1:26:20] just you battle and Satan fights you and
[1:26:24] all of these things.
[1:26:26] But then that seed gene of God is inside
[1:26:29] of you.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; It doesn't need another body. It takes
[1:26:33] your body.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; God placed that in your body.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And then he comes and quickens that
[1:26:41] seed.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's the only way you can
[1:26:47] become a son or daughter of God
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; is that seed to be quickened. A son and
[1:26:52] daughter of God has a different life.
[1:26:55] Amen.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; It's controlled by another life
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; than sexorn life.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. So, Brother Brown says to
[1:27:05] be a son of God, you had to be in him
[1:27:07] always. The gene of your life, spiritual
[1:27:10] life tonight was in God the Father
[1:27:12] before there was even a molecule. And
[1:27:14] you are nothing but the manifestation of
[1:27:15] the gene of life that was in God as a
[1:27:18] son of God. Now, you're expressed after
[1:27:20] his word has come into you to light up
[1:27:23] this age. You're you are expressing
[1:27:25] God's life in you because you're a son
[1:27:28] or daughter of God.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; See, and so then not only did God know
[1:27:35] that you would be here by your natural
[1:27:38] birth,
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; but he also knew you to be a gene seed
[1:27:44] of his own.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And at some point in
[1:27:49] your earthly journey,
[1:27:51] that gene seed was quickened to life,
[1:27:56] new life.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And what you thought
[1:27:59] was life here, all of a sudden, you
[1:28:02] realize there's a greater life than
[1:28:04] this.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; There's a greater life. You'll never get
[1:28:07] that fish down there to understand
[1:28:09] there's a greater life.
[1:28:11] God somehow made it possible that his
[1:28:14] life could come into you which is a
[1:28:16] greater life than your sexorn life and
[1:28:19] be called and begin to call for
[1:28:21] something greater.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Greater.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Greater. That's why you can't be
[1:28:28] satisfied in the world. When a person's
[1:28:31] got a new birth, he's born again. He
[1:28:33] can't be satisfied.
[1:28:37] He may make mistakes but he'll rise up
[1:28:39] again because the new life is crying for
[1:28:41] another world.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; So at that time you become a dual person
[1:28:49] like Jesus was. The natural part of you
[1:28:51] is earthbound. The eternal part of you
[1:28:54] is heaven bound. There were times that
[1:28:57] Jesus grown with a headache. There were
[1:28:59] times that he was hungry. There was
[1:29:00] times that he was thirsty. There was
[1:29:02] times that he fought sickness and
[1:29:04] disappointments and discouragements and
[1:29:07] he felt lonely and he would cry and and
[1:29:10] all of these things. But then there were
[1:29:12] times that he would speak with authority
[1:29:14] and the dead would rise up.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; He would turn the water into wine. He
[1:29:24] walked on that water. Walked on the
[1:29:26] water. Can you say amen?
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Died as a man and yet rose as God.
[1:29:32] God. He raised himself up again. Can you
[1:29:35] say amen? Brother Brown said there's
[1:29:37] time he spake as a man. Other times it'd
[1:29:39] be God speaking.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; See, so he says, see, when the Holy
[1:29:42] Spirit comes into the heart quickly, um
[1:29:45] he the man person becomes then a
[1:29:49] two-fold being. One of the earth to die
[1:29:52] and one of heaven to live. In his body,
[1:29:55] he's still subject to death, but in his
[1:29:57] soul, he's passed from death into life.
[1:30:00] In his body, he has his earthly contact
[1:30:02] with his five senses. But in his spirit,
[1:30:04] he has a contact with God through the
[1:30:07] Holy Ghost. And the angels of God visits
[1:30:10] them and speaks with them. And they are
[1:30:12] messengers sent from God to reveal and
[1:30:15] to bring messages from God to the
[1:30:17] individual. Can you say amen? Amen. See,
[1:30:20] this is why we believe in the message of
[1:30:22] the hour. It was God speaking through a
[1:30:25] man and it's God in us believing that
[1:30:28] what was said through that man.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a supernatural
[1:30:34] fellowship.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; In closing, the natural side of us lives
[1:30:44] by earthly substance.
[1:30:48] The spir spiritual side of us lives by
[1:30:50] the word.
[1:30:53] Brother Brandham says before the little
[1:30:55] baby is born, it's craving for some
[1:30:57] vitamin. And the mother's words speak
[1:31:00] forth. Dad, I want a cantaloupe or
[1:31:04] watermelon. I want something or another.
[1:31:07] See? Why? He'll do everything he can to
[1:31:10] get that because he knows that he wants
[1:31:12] his child born as perfect as it can be.
[1:31:15] And he'll do everything that he's able
[1:31:17] to do to get it. How much more aler is
[1:31:20] he, God, to get it?
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; He's a creator.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Something down inside of you calling for
[1:31:29] something. It's not of this life, but
[1:31:33] don't worry about it. God sees it.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Your heavenly father knows and he can
[1:31:38] speak the creative word
[1:31:41] and supply it.
[1:31:43] He said, "See now think how able he is
[1:31:47] to prepare us a body to live like his
[1:31:49] own glorious body if we want to live.
[1:31:52] There is something in us called to live.
[1:31:54] And there is something in us that calls
[1:31:56] to do right. Then God will come call
[1:31:58] somebody on the platform or the pulpit
[1:32:00] that will preach the absolute truth."
[1:32:03] Why? See, it shows you. Then if you're a
[1:32:06] real child of God, you begin to cry out,
[1:32:08] "God, take it away from me." Yeah.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; You don't get mad.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Wow. I can't believe he's preaching at
[1:32:16] me. No.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, God, just take it from me.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Circumcise me from this. Take these
[1:32:24] things away from me." Why? It's needed
[1:32:27] for your heavenly home that you're going
[1:32:29] to where he's gone on to prepare for
[1:32:32] you've got to be a real word bride of
[1:32:36] Christ.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's why we can't
[1:32:39] believe in something that's not of the
[1:32:41] word. We We're not gullible. We have to
[1:32:44] take the full word of God. Ain't that
[1:32:46] right? So he says, "How can the Holy
[1:32:49] Spirit make you believe a creed that you
[1:32:52] that that you have to do something like
[1:32:54] this when the Bible said something else?
[1:32:57] We have to join a church and do this or
[1:32:59] do that when the Bible plainly tells you
[1:33:01] what to do." Then when you see that
[1:33:04] capital T and you jump right into it,
[1:33:07] capital I, you're right with it, then
[1:33:12] just keep moving right on up and it just
[1:33:15] grows like a germ coming into the womb
[1:33:19] of a woman with the egg. See, then when
[1:33:23] that little egg begins to develop and
[1:33:25] begins to bring forth germs, it don't
[1:33:27] put one human germ and a dog germ and a
[1:33:30] cow germ. It puts all human germs. Cell
[1:33:34] on top of cell. Can you say amen? And
[1:33:37] when a child of God, he says when that
[1:33:40] predestinated, that's a bad word to use.
[1:33:42] He said, but it's God. Here is God's
[1:33:44] Bible. The fornowledge of God can
[1:33:46] predestinate make everything work to his
[1:33:49] honor. And when that predestinated sea
[1:33:51] that you was that you was to be and God
[1:33:54] called you and that little eagle of a
[1:33:56] seed in there heard the word of God, it
[1:33:58] will build on top one word on top of the
[1:34:02] other one on top the other one on top of
[1:34:05] the other one. Can you say amen? And and
[1:34:08] that life is developing and becoming
[1:34:10] stronger and stronger and stronger. and
[1:34:14] everything that you need God
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; has prepared it.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will comeless
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; I love the Lord.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:44] Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that God knows and
[1:34:53] he's an ontime God.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Everything that he has done, he's
[1:34:58] prepared. He had the lamb prepared
[1:35:01] before we needed it. Because he knew we
[1:35:03] would need it. He had healing prepared
[1:35:06] before we even got sick because he knew
[1:35:09] we'd need it. He prepared everything.
[1:35:13] And not only that, but he's prepared a
[1:35:15] body. And as Paul says, we have an if
[1:35:17] this earthly body
[1:35:20] be dissolved, this earthly tabernacle be
[1:35:22] dissolved, we have one waiting.
[1:35:27] And brother Bram said, "It's already
[1:35:29] waiting. It's there."
[1:35:32] And I like that. Um, if I could read it
[1:35:35] to you,
[1:35:38] cuz I I think it's it's pretty cool.
[1:35:41] It's already waiting. See, so the
[1:35:43] prophet says, "Now, what if you didn't
[1:35:46] have the sight? You just had taste,
[1:35:48] feel, smell, and hear, and somebody
[1:35:50] received their sight and said, "There's
[1:35:52] another world, son."
[1:35:55] Them feelings, you bump into things, and
[1:35:58] what it is can tell you what it is. Why?
[1:36:02] You'd think the person was crazy cuz you
[1:36:04] don't have that sense of sight. Nobody
[1:36:07] ever had it that you know of. See,
[1:36:09] you've heard of people that said such
[1:36:12] things as that, but you doubted it. But
[1:36:15] we know by this sense that it's real.
[1:36:17] It's a real place. It's a place. See,
[1:36:19] your sense declares that. Now, the only
[1:36:22] thing you do when you die, you just
[1:36:24] change those five senses and you just
[1:36:27] receive another sense. You're alive with
[1:36:30] a higher sense
[1:36:32] a thousand times higher than this.
[1:36:38] The five senses that we have, the sense
[1:36:40] that you receive over there is a
[1:36:42] thousand times higher.
[1:36:46] It's just in another life. A life where
[1:36:48] there's no death, there's no sorrow.
[1:36:52] And the things that you don't know
[1:36:53] nothing about now, you see it plainly
[1:36:56] when you cross there.
[1:36:59] You don't understand it now
[1:37:03] because you're bumping into it.
[1:37:08] You haven't got that sense.
[1:37:11] So, we may not be able to see a heaven.
[1:37:13] We may not be able to see the angels. We
[1:37:15] may not be able to see those things, but
[1:37:18] we're bumping
[1:37:20] bumping into it. And and the prophet
[1:37:24] said, "See," he said, "you say, I feel a
[1:37:27] strange feeling here tonight. It looks
[1:37:30] like there's," he said, "I just want to
[1:37:32] cry and shout or something." He said,
[1:37:34] "It's the angels of the Lord.
[1:37:37] You're bumping
[1:37:40] like somebody say, you know, that never
[1:37:41] did have the sense of sight." Say,
[1:37:43] "Well, once in a while, I feel something
[1:37:45] real like a warmth feeling like warmth."
[1:37:49] And then you say, "It's sunlight." cuz
[1:37:53] you got the eyes to see. They don't. So,
[1:37:56] you're looking at it, they're feeling
[1:37:57] it, and you see it. And you tell them
[1:38:00] it's the sun shining upon you, right?
[1:38:05] Well, what is the sunlight? I never did
[1:38:06] see it. See, he never did see. He don't
[1:38:09] know what it is. See, someone over there
[1:38:11] has to tell him somebody that can see
[1:38:14] it. So, we just change.
[1:38:18] We just change. Don't be afraid of
[1:38:20] death. Death ain't nothing but a
[1:38:22] scarecrow. Jesus conquered it. Even when
[1:38:24] Paul come down at the end, he said,
[1:38:26] "Death, where's your sting? Where's your
[1:38:29] scare? Grave, where's your victory? You
[1:38:31] say you got me?" I want you to point you
[1:38:33] back to Jerusalem. There's an empty tomb
[1:38:35] there. And I am he that conquered both
[1:38:38] you. Death, hell, and grave. Can you say
[1:38:41] amen? Do you love him?
[1:38:44] Amen. Oh, sing it again. It won't be
[1:38:48] long.
[1:38:49] Oh, it won't be long
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:57] till we'll be leaving
[1:39:00] you.
[1:39:04] It won't be long.

[1:39:56] Yes. Count the weeks as days. Any day

[1:43:30] offerings.
[1:43:34] We'll be going home
[1:43:38] [Music]

[1:43:45] Amen.
