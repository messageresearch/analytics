[41:11] Lord we're just asking that you would
[41:13] feel welcome here this evening and that
[41:16] you would just be free to move and have
[41:21] your way father Lord and the things that
[41:25] may be that is not right with you or uh
[41:30] pleasing to you in our lives we'd ask
[41:32] that you would take it out father and
[41:34] God remode us and shape us and to your
[41:38] image for we want to be more like you
[41:40] father I pray father that you would just
[41:43] give us the grace now and help me to get
[41:46] myself out of the way and may the people
[41:49] be ready and willing to receive father
[41:52] is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name in
[41:56] the church
[41:57] says amen amen you can have your seats
[42:01] this
[42:03] evening and uh beautiful day today and
[42:06] um I'll take these kind of days amen and
[42:11] um uh nice and warm amen and uh well it
[42:16] was at our house anyways but uh we uh
[42:20] just appreciate the Lord
[42:22] amen and uh um I uh you know we we
[42:28] understand by the Bible and by the signs
[42:32] of the time that we are living in the
[42:36] age of rapture it is the time of rapture
[42:39] and and um
[42:43] uh that word rapture uh is means to be
[42:47] carried away caught up and so you know
[42:51] uh some people would would argue with
[42:55] you on that word rapture it's not in the
[42:57] Bible but really it it the Bible does
[43:01] say we will be caught up to meet the
[43:02] Lord in the air we're going to be
[43:04] carried away to uh to meet him and so so
[43:09] Rapture that's that's what Rapture is
[43:12] and I just looked up this word the
[43:15] phrase caught up I guess that's what you
[43:17] would call it but caught up means to
[43:20] seize to snatch to pluck to pull take by
[43:26] force to take for
[43:29] oneself and so th this is what the
[43:32] Rapture is and I believe that the
[43:35] Rapture has to do with more than just
[43:38] being CAU up in in
[43:41] Revelation uh I I think that's part of
[43:44] it but um uh Enoch being our type the
[43:48] seventh from Adam and he was the type of
[43:51] us um uh didn't just receive Revelation
[43:56] even though he did rece receive
[43:57] Revelation but uh uh Genesis 5:24 tells
[44:02] us that Enoch walked with God and he was
[44:06] not for God took him ain't that right uh
[44:10] uh so he was not for God took him so he
[44:13] was seized or caught up catched away uh
[44:17] without experiencing death and and so I
[44:22] I truly believe that there are people
[44:23] living today that is going to EXP exp
[44:27] erience that same thing that will not
[44:29] experience death but they're going to be
[44:32] raptured and and uh but at this time of
[44:37] rapture uh the the Bible tells us there
[44:40] in 1 Corinthians 15 and 26 The Last
[44:45] Enemy that shall be destroyed is death
[44:49] aren't you glad for that amen uh that
[44:52] that's going to be the Last Enemy um uh
[44:55] that that will be destroyed and and so
[44:59] the dead of course in Christ are going
[45:03] to be raptured uh at the same time and
[45:07] all uh who are part of this Rapture will
[45:11] be missing it's uh uh they're going to
[45:13] be gone and so uh uh uh brother Braham
[45:18] said standing there one moment and gone
[45:20] the next uh that that's the Rapture you
[45:23] you ain't going there ain't going to be
[45:24] no hair bones uh no nothing uh left uh
[45:30] uh because they're going to be
[45:31] transformed we will be transformed in a
[45:34] moment of time do you believe that so so
[45:37] our heart should be just anticipating
[45:41] under great expectation for this Rapture
[45:44] for the Rapture is at hand and and so uh
[45:49] uh then we we look at this and and read
[45:52] this the other night um but brother Bram
[45:55] said we've lived the time out amen and
[45:59] at the time of the Rapture is at hand
[46:03] and we're looking everybody say we're
[46:05] looking see we're looking for rapturing
[46:08] faith that can pull the church together
[46:11] and give it some Supernatural strength
[46:14] that can change these bodies that we
[46:16] live in ain't that right but then he
[46:19] says but don't worry amen it'll be there
[46:22] ain't that right it'll be there he says
[46:25] and when the power power of this church
[46:28] Rises it'll bring its Brethren see the
[46:31] power of that church Rises will bring
[46:33] its Brethren the power of that church
[46:36] will bring the other Brethren then there
[46:39] will be a general resurrection and we're
[46:43] looking forward to it how many's looking
[46:45] forward to it now we're looking forward
[46:48] to it because we know that he is a
[46:52] present help in the time of trouble amen
[46:55] he he's a present help now so so
[46:58] rapturing Faith he says will pull the
[47:02] church together and give it some
[47:05] Supernatural strength amen that can
[47:08] change uh uh these bodies amen it's got
[47:11] to take strength and if you notice he
[47:14] called it Supernatural strength amen
[47:17] it's it's a strength well uh God is
[47:20] Supernatural as we know we've been
[47:22] talking about it his actions are
[47:24] Supernatural and his life is
[47:27] Supernatural and and that's that's the
[47:30] token amen his life coming in you it's a
[47:33] supernatural life it's far superior than
[47:37] this old natural uh uh uh uh mortal life
[47:41] amen and and the the supernatural
[47:45] transcends the natural it goes beyond
[47:47] the limits of the natural it exceeds any
[47:52] restrictions amen that the natural has
[47:55] and and and so we know uh uh miracles
[47:58] happen because of the supernatural ain't
[48:01] that right every one of us uh have got
[48:04] testimonies of what God has done
[48:07] miraculously you know uh uh uh uh
[48:11] brother amamos talking about his arm uh
[48:14] uh hurting severely and and and we
[48:17] prayed and and God just instantly took
[48:19] that pain away uh we we we uh uh sister
[48:24] uh uh Janice uh there having isssues in
[48:27] her body and and uh it looked like she
[48:29] was going to have to have surgery and
[48:31] the doctor had had told her that and and
[48:34] but she went back for a checkup and and
[48:37] said you know no need for surgery and
[48:39] and these things but but there's
[48:41] something about that it we don't take
[48:44] these things for granted uh we know that
[48:47] there's something Supernatural Among Us
[48:50] how many believes that amen you have to
[48:52] believe in the basics and that is that
[48:54] God is Supernatural and that God there's
[48:57] nothing impossible with God Amen and
[49:01] then we have to know what he's trying to
[49:03] do in this last day so miracles happen
[49:06] the dead are raised and the blind see
[49:09] and and the crippled walk there there's
[49:12] nothing impossible amen the dead here
[49:15] and or the deaf amen uh uh they here and
[49:19] and so uh uh but but then we we find the
[49:23] prophet saying that Supernatural
[49:25] strength is needed in order to meet the
[49:29] challenge of the hour that's what a
[49:32] prophet said amen that it it's needed to
[49:35] meet the challenge of the hour and so we
[49:39] we look and this is how in the Old
[49:41] Testament this is how Samson could meet
[49:44] the challenge of of his day um uh uh
[49:48] when the enemy uh came and and uh a
[49:52] thousand Philistines he killed a
[49:54] thousand Philistines amen and and these
[49:57] were soldiers well-trained men uh with
[50:01] with armor and equipped weapon and yet
[50:05] he the spirit of the Lord came upon him
[50:08] and he took a just a Jawbone of a donkey
[50:11] and killed a thousand Philistines amen
[50:15] the Bible says that the enemy tried to
[50:17] surround him in a city and and he just
[50:20] walked to them Gates of that City amen
[50:23] and just picked them gates up and walked
[50:25] it up the hill and laid it down and
[50:27] Escape amen the Bible says that he
[50:30] killed a lion amen with his bare hands
[50:33] as it came at him now you know uh uh uh
[50:37] uh the intellectuals would maybe try to
[50:41] try to explain of how that was done but
[50:44] see we as Believers just look at it as
[50:47] that it was a supernatural strength amen
[50:50] Samson wouldn't have been able to do
[50:52] that it without a supernatural uh uh
[50:56] strength there Amen brother brandham
[50:58] said his strength was beyond anything
[51:01] the world ever had amen there was
[51:04] nothing that could match it for he had
[51:07] the strength of the Lord amen I'm so
[51:11] glad for that he had the strength of the
[51:14] Lord and when that strength Came Upon
[51:16] him there was no enemy there was no
[51:19] there was nothing that could take over
[51:21] him and destroy him but we find that
[51:24] when he revealed his secret amen uh to
[51:28] Delilah amen uh uh the secret of his
[51:32] strength amen then he lost that strength
[51:36] amen judges 16 and 18 it says when
[51:39] Delilah saw that he had told her all his
[51:42] heart she sent and called for the Lords
[51:45] of the Philistines saying come up this
[51:48] once for he hath showed me all his heart
[51:52] then the Lords of the Philistines came
[51:54] unto her and brought her money or
[51:57] brought money in their hand and she made
[51:59] him Samson sleep upon her knees and she
[52:02] called for a man and she callused him to
[52:05] shave off the Seven Locks of his head
[52:08] and she began to afflict him and his
[52:11] strength went from him now you think of
[52:15] that it was a sign that he was in a
[52:18] backsliding condition he had no strength
[52:21] uh uh there it had left him and in that
[52:25] condition he could not produce the
[52:28] strength Amen to meet the challenge of
[52:31] the hour in that backsliding condition
[52:34] there was not enough strength Amen to
[52:36] produce the challenge or to meet the
[52:38] challenge of the hour for we see in the
[52:40] 20th verse she said the Philistines be
[52:43] upon thee Samson and he awoke out of his
[52:47] sleep and said I will go out as the
[52:49] other times or as at other times before
[52:52] and shake myself and he wish not that
[52:55] the Lord was departing Ed from him and
[52:58] the Philistines took him and put his
[53:00] eyes out and brought him down to Gaza
[53:03] amen and bounded him with feathers of
[53:06] brass and he did grind in the prison
[53:08] house ain't that right see so he
[53:11] couldn't overcome the enemy amen as he
[53:14] had in times past amen now the prophet
[53:18] said the church in its present
[53:20] denominational condition cannot produce
[53:23] the strength Amen to challenge the time
[53:27] uh to call it a Time see the
[53:29] denominations will not take the
[53:32] Vindicated uh Vindication of the word
[53:35] ain't that right he said you got bigger
[53:38] more members bigger muscles but where is
[53:41] the strength of the Lord amen see we uh
[53:45] uh we we can't do it on our own our our
[53:48] nice choirs and and and
[53:51] professionalism uh uh it isn't enough
[53:54] Amen to defeat the enemy and to meet the
[53:57] challenge in this day he said your big
[54:00] muscles won't meet the challenge of this
[54:02] hour the rapturing faith to take the
[54:05] church out of this thing before judgment
[54:08] strikes the earthy and so the the the
[54:11] carnal church is trying to produce the
[54:15] strength amen they're trying to meet the
[54:18] challenge of this age of uh with
[54:21] intellectual strength the prophet said
[54:23] see amen it's just kind of like when
[54:26] when God brought Israel up to the
[54:28] promised land amen they saw the enemy
[54:31] see they they had thought that they they
[54:34] could take that Land by intellectual
[54:36] strength and of their own ability but
[54:39] when they saw the Giants and they saw
[54:41] that it was too uh uh to beyond their
[54:44] strength it was beyond their ability
[54:47] amen they they cowed down and they uh uh
[54:51] they they didn't have the strength to
[54:53] meet the challenge but see the believer
[54:56] had it Joshua and Caleb they had what it
[54:59] took to meet the challenge can you say
[55:02] amen amen see now what is our strength
[55:05] brother bradam said the strength of the
[55:08] church is in the word of God and the
[55:12] word is God can you say Amen so the
[55:16] strength of the church is in the word
[55:19] and the word is God so brother Brandon
[55:22] would say in another place this word is
[55:25] God that was given to his church to
[55:28] defeat the world and the Devils amen now
[55:31] you don't need anything else you don't
[55:33] need intellect you don't need uh Talent
[55:36] you don't need whatever amen the word of
[55:39] God was given to us Amen to defeat the
[55:42] world and the devils and the sickness
[55:45] and to cast out Devils how many believes
[55:48] that amen that's right see and the word
[55:51] of God is Not only given to to Grandpa's
[55:53] and grandmas it's given to the middle
[55:56] aged it's given to the young people this
[55:59] word of God is our strength Amen to
[56:02] defeat the enemy it was the thing that
[56:04] God gave his church to defeat the world
[56:07] I don't care what Temptation you have
[56:09] there's a a the word of God Amen was
[56:12] given to you to defeat uh uh the world
[56:16] and the devils and the sickness and to
[56:18] cast out devils and no denomination was
[56:21] given to the church see the word was
[56:24] given to the church that's her strength
[56:27] can you say that with me that's my
[56:29] strength that's my strength amen see
[56:32] don't don't depart from the word that's
[56:34] my strength you got to have strength in
[56:36] order for these bodies to be changed can
[56:39] you say Amen the word of God is our
[56:42] strength so you you remember what the
[56:45] prophet said the weakest Christian can
[56:47] take that word and defeat the Devil any
[56:50] place any time under any uh condition
[56:55] there is no problem
[56:56] that you cannot and I want to say that
[56:59] now there is no problem too hard to
[57:02] where you can't overcome you got to
[57:04] overcome it God's given you the best
[57:07] thing that you've got he can give you
[57:09] and that's the word of God take that
[57:11] word and I don't care how weak you feel
[57:15] how low you feel how unworthy you feel
[57:18] if you could take that word you can
[57:20] defeat the enemy with it amen yes sir
[57:23] but notice he uh as as the Ilah shaved
[57:27] off the power amen uh um from Samson's
[57:32] head amen then the prophet said
[57:35] spiritual Jezebel uh they're mentioned
[57:37] in Revelations amen that Harlot system
[57:41] has done the same thing to the church
[57:44] amen she said she found uh he said she
[57:47] found where that strength laid and took
[57:50] him down to NAA Rome and shaved off his
[57:53] locks see and now they took what's left
[57:56] out of it and now taking them back to
[57:59] the World Council of churches and they
[58:01] got their locks shaved again see it's a
[58:04] constant shaving taking this out and
[58:07] well this doesn't mean that and the days
[58:09] of Miracles has passed and there's no
[58:12] such thing as this and that and the
[58:14] other and see they found where the
[58:16] strength laid substituting baptisms and
[58:20] handshakes and all these other things
[58:22] for the UN true unadulterated word of
[58:25] God so that's how the church has lost
[58:28] its strength amen they it was shaved off
[58:31] amen by taking this little part of the
[58:33] word out and this little part of the
[58:35] word out and this little part amen see
[58:37] it was they they shaved it off ain't
[58:39] that right he said see they've cut uh
[58:42] they've cut this away they've cut that
[58:44] away and they've shaved off this lock
[58:46] and they shaved off that lock until she
[58:49] stands shn today like a Catholic sister
[58:52] Shor off until she has accepted a bunch
[58:55] of man-made Creeds for her Doctrine and
[58:58] just exactly what the prophet said she
[59:00] would do now notice and here she stands
[59:03] today the church humiliated the church
[59:06] stands humiliated where she ought to
[59:09] have been standing in her strength God
[59:13] gave her the word but amen but uh uh was
[59:16] shaved off amen and now she stands
[59:20] humiliated the church around the world
[59:22] Amen claiming to be Christian claiming
[59:24] Christ claiming all of the things and
[59:26] standing humiliated when she should be
[59:29] standing in her strength amen see but
[59:33] you know uh uh the Bible says that
[59:36] Samson's strength returned to him amen
[59:40] as his hair grew back you see God
[59:43] promised and and this is just one of the
[59:46] things that through that story God
[59:48] promises amen that the strength amen
[59:51] will return back to the church amen the
[59:54] strength will return turn back into the
[59:57] church aren't you glad for that amen and
[1:00:00] and so he promised amen as to to but in
[1:00:04] order to restore the strength to the
[1:00:06] church he would have to restore the
[1:00:09] original word amen pure word of God
[1:00:12] without Creeds and dogmas and all of
[1:00:14] these things he would have to restore
[1:00:17] the original word and he promised to do
[1:00:19] it in these last days how many believes
[1:00:21] that right at the time of rapture amen
[1:00:24] that's God's grace to you Amen in the
[1:00:27] time of rapture he knew that we would
[1:00:29] have to have a supernatural strength in
[1:00:32] order to change these bodies but I'm so
[1:00:35] glad he's a present help in the time of
[1:00:37] our trouble amen yes sir amen see God he
[1:00:42] says is going to restore by shining
[1:00:45] forth the evening light what restored
[1:00:48] the whole word of God again notice the
[1:00:51] full manifestation of Christ in his
[1:00:56] church and of course with the
[1:00:58] restoration of the word comes the
[1:01:00] restoration of power amen the
[1:01:03] restoration of the word brings the
[1:01:05] restoration of the power amen see so I I
[1:01:09] say to you that the supernatural
[1:01:11] strength has returned to the church in
[1:01:15] this last day amen we are not weak we're
[1:01:18] not beggarly amen we're not victims of
[1:01:21] of circumstances amen there's a
[1:01:23] spiritual strength amen that is flowing
[1:01:26] in the church today now if you notice
[1:01:29] it's amazing that when God would return
[1:01:31] Supernatural strength to this church
[1:01:34] also we would look that the tears would
[1:01:36] also have strength amen they'll have
[1:01:39] strength in this last day brother Bram
[1:01:42] said that that that the tears would have
[1:01:45] a a tremendous three-fold strength of
[1:01:48] political physical and satanic power see
[1:01:51] it's a manifestation of of of Satan now
[1:01:54] notice now he he talked about that uh uh
[1:01:58] we read the quote earlier that God going
[1:02:00] to restore the whole word of God again
[1:02:02] the full manifestation of Christ in his
[1:02:05] church but here amen is the
[1:02:08] manifestation of Satan amen working
[1:02:11] through the tears and and the system now
[1:02:14] anybody that's uh uh been around demon
[1:02:16] uh possessed people amen know that that
[1:02:20] their their strength is many times
[1:02:22] stronger than just as it would in the
[1:02:25] natural you can look at the man of
[1:02:27] gadera uh uh for example amen uh Mark 5
[1:02:31] and3 it says that no man could bind him
[1:02:34] no not with chains because he had often
[1:02:37] uh he had been often bound with FEDS and
[1:02:39] chains and the chains had been plucked
[1:02:42] toer by him and the feathers broken in
[1:02:45] pieces and neither could any man tame
[1:02:48] him ain't that right amen see it it it
[1:02:51] it it gave him a strength Beyond just
[1:02:54] human uh uh uh ability well in the first
[1:02:58] church age we we see that Satan amen
[1:03:01] started his ride Amen on the the the
[1:03:04] White Horse amen he was that the White
[1:03:07] Horse and and then uh after a while he
[1:03:10] switched to a red horse and then after a
[1:03:12] while he switched to a a black horse and
[1:03:15] and now he's riding a Pale Horse amen
[1:03:19] which is what death a ain't that right
[1:03:22] amen see and and all this time he been
[1:03:26] he's brought destruction he's brought
[1:03:28] perversion he's brought all kinds of
[1:03:30] things and and and and so he he's been
[1:03:33] riding a beast throughout the church age
[1:03:36] and we know what Beast is it's a power
[1:03:39] ain't that right it it's a power and so
[1:03:42] Satan's power Through the Ages has been
[1:03:45] exhibited and notice the prophet said
[1:03:48] his powers are political or national
[1:03:51] Powers that's why you don't need to get
[1:03:53] involved in politics amen don't need to
[1:03:56] get involved in politics his power
[1:03:58] Satan's Powers is National Powers
[1:04:01] political Powers amen uh uh that's one
[1:04:05] of them religious powers and demon
[1:04:08] powers so that's the powers that Satan
[1:04:10] has amen political National Powers
[1:04:14] religious Powers demon powers ain't that
[1:04:17] right and brother Bram taught us that
[1:04:19] all three powers are united in this age
[1:04:24] in The Pale Horse
[1:04:26] amen he said see three colors three
[1:04:29] powers represented in one a white horse
[1:04:32] a black horse a red horse see aen all
[1:04:35] gathered in that Pale Horse three crowns
[1:04:39] in one brother Braham said see three
[1:04:42] stages of his ministry makes him one
[1:04:45] person Satan incarnate and that's
[1:04:47] exactly where we're coming to Satan is
[1:04:50] coming more and more real or um making
[1:04:53] himself known more than in any other age
[1:04:57] is it is today and he will become
[1:05:00] incarnate can you say amen amen it it's
[1:05:03] amazing that the powers of the enemy
[1:05:05] amen that that is taken over the people
[1:05:08] to where even the policemen don't know
[1:05:10] what to do they it's hard to handle them
[1:05:12] amen because they're they're not dealing
[1:05:14] with just an individual they're dealing
[1:05:17] with individuals that are
[1:05:18] demon-possessed and and and and we're
[1:05:21] finding this uh uh uh uh uh this a a
[1:05:24] threefold Str stren in the tears now
[1:05:28] political physical and satanic spiritual
[1:05:31] Powers now the prophet says now he's
[1:05:34] he's he's these Powers they're going to
[1:05:36] attack the bride amen and that's what
[1:05:39] there there there's everything is
[1:05:40] setting up amen uh uh to get uh the the
[1:05:44] take the righteousness off away from off
[1:05:47] this Earth can you say Amen but notice
[1:05:51] now amen he is a present help in the
[1:05:54] time of trouble amen now listen this is
[1:05:57] a uh the these things are bringing on
[1:05:59] the tribulation amen these Powers uh
[1:06:02] that we just mentioned this three-fold
[1:06:04] strength amen is bringing on the
[1:06:06] tribulation it's setting in amen and to
[1:06:09] think you don't want to be here in this
[1:06:11] time of tribulation amen when the mercy
[1:06:13] of God has been lifted the hedge of God
[1:06:15] has been lifted and Satan has been able
[1:06:18] to Incarnate himself and have full
[1:06:21] dominion and full manifestation in human
[1:06:24] beings can you say Amen
[1:06:26] amen see and so uh uh it's this but we
[1:06:30] uh uh looking at this we've been
[1:06:31] promised that we're not going to
[1:06:33] tribulation the bride of Christ will not
[1:06:36] go through the tribulation amen so in
[1:06:39] the time of trouble amen he said he
[1:06:43] would be our help a present help now
[1:06:47] notice amen our strength what uh look
[1:06:50] what Psalms 18:32 says it is God that
[1:06:55] GED me with strength and maketh my way
[1:06:58] perfect Psalms 29:11 the Lord will give
[1:07:01] strength unto his people what is it
[1:07:05] Supernatural strength ain't that right
[1:07:07] amen 2 Samuel 22 and33 God is my
[1:07:12] strength and power amen uh uh uh so it
[1:07:17] it went just giving something to
[1:07:19] becoming something amen God just ain't
[1:07:22] going to give me strength he is my
[1:07:24] strength
[1:07:26] can you say Amen 2 Samuel 22:33 God is
[1:07:30] my strength and power Psalms 28:7 the
[1:07:33] Lord is my strength and my shield Isaiah
[1:07:36] 12 and2 behold God is my salvation I
[1:07:40] will trust and not be afraid for the
[1:07:43] Jehovah or for the Lord Jehovah is my
[1:07:47] strength oh bless the name of the Lord
[1:07:50] amen see so in I Isaiah 59:19 we know
[1:07:54] the scripture very well well amen but it
[1:07:56] says when the enemy come shall come in
[1:07:59] like a flood amen the spirit of the Lord
[1:08:03] shall lift up a standard raise up a
[1:08:05] standard against him amen not your
[1:08:08] intellect you are no match I am no match
[1:08:10] for him amen for this Old Devil this
[1:08:13] enemy amen it's proven that no man is a
[1:08:16] match for this enemy can you say amen
[1:08:19] amen but when he would come in like a
[1:08:21] flood God would be a present help in the
[1:08:24] time of trouble
[1:08:26] and he would raise up a standard against
[1:08:29] the enemy Hallelujah now how does he do
[1:08:31] it the prophet said by making the word
[1:08:35] amen that he's already said more
[1:08:38] positive all the time taking his same
[1:08:41] word and just making it more positive
[1:08:44] manifesting it making it more real and
[1:08:47] more real and more real it becomes more
[1:08:50] manifested so when Satan rode out on the
[1:08:54] White Horse with that power amen then
[1:08:57] God sent a certain power to meet it to
[1:09:01] combat it and that was the
[1:09:03] lion and then when Satan switched powers
[1:09:07] or switched uh horses uh uh and he rode
[1:09:11] on that red horse uh God sent another
[1:09:13] power to go forth and meet it to combat
[1:09:16] it and that was the ox ain't that right
[1:09:19] amen and when he came forth riding on
[1:09:21] the black horse God sent another power
[1:09:23] to meet him amen the prophet said it was
[1:09:26] a face of a man smart educated shrewd
[1:09:28] fine Anointed with the spirit of that
[1:09:31] day he went to combat him with the
[1:09:34] cunningness of God's wisdom with him
[1:09:37] that was the age of reformation Martin
[1:09:39] Luther John Wesley and so forth ain't
[1:09:41] that right see so God had showed that
[1:09:44] throughout all this time he was a
[1:09:46] present help amen and he would anoint
[1:09:49] the people that he has elect amen uh
[1:09:52] with a with that spirit and and they
[1:09:54] would rise up and and the Satan wouldn't
[1:09:57] be able to conquer them amen see amen
[1:10:00] now you look at Psalms 37 and and 39 it
[1:10:04] says the salvation of the righteous is
[1:10:06] of the Lord how many believes that the
[1:10:08] salvation of the righteous is of the
[1:10:12] Lord he is their strength in the time of
[1:10:16] trouble and the Lord shall help them and
[1:10:19] deliver them and he shall deliver them
[1:10:23] from the wicked and safe them him
[1:10:26] because they trust in him oh God's going
[1:10:29] to reward the people that trust in him
[1:10:32] God's going to reward his elect that
[1:10:34] just stands there when they ain't got no
[1:10:36] feelings and the and the emotions have
[1:10:39] left and the uh uh and and it just seem
[1:10:41] like their back is against the wall but
[1:10:43] they never cater from trusting God Amen
[1:10:47] they stay with trusting trusting him
[1:10:50] ain't that right now now notice he's
[1:10:53] going to send a standard he'll raise up
[1:10:55] a standard and and and you know God has
[1:10:59] showed that he's been with them in every
[1:11:01] Age and and every time Satan would come
[1:11:04] now we're living in the greatest age the
[1:11:06] most deceptive age the most uh uh uh
[1:11:09] evil age the most uh age of unbelief
[1:11:13] than ever before amen talking about
[1:11:15] breaking record history amen uh uh that
[1:11:19] there Satan is doing things that he uh
[1:11:22] uh like like never before in the in in
[1:11:24] man kind amen see and so notice what
[1:11:28] brother BR said our Great Hopes is this
[1:11:31] that one of these days this is in 59 the
[1:11:35] spirit of God will send back Jesus
[1:11:37] Christ to the Earth and then it'll be
[1:11:40] perfect then that will be the real
[1:11:44] standard oh my in the last days see the
[1:11:48] spirit of God will send back Jesus
[1:11:52] Christ to the Earth and then it'll be
[1:11:54] perfect thing
[1:11:55] that'll be the real standard so notice
[1:11:58] the last and final power that God sins
[1:12:03] to combat the enemy which is that pale
[1:12:06] horse rider which is is all powers of
[1:12:10] the previous ages mixed together amen
[1:12:13] they've come and United together God
[1:12:16] sends the uh uh uh the the right power
[1:12:21] to combat that thing amen see and that
[1:12:24] is the fly Eagle amen the last and final
[1:12:28] power that is to come to the church is a
[1:12:30] flying eagle ain't that right now to me
[1:12:33] that's what makes this message uh so so
[1:12:36] precious to us and wonderful a man is is
[1:12:40] because this message was sent from God
[1:12:44] it's a sign that he's a present help in
[1:12:46] the time of trouble and and see so he
[1:12:49] sends the Flying Eagle now notice first
[1:12:53] Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself
[1:12:56] shall descend amen with a shout a voice
[1:13:01] and a trump amen now now notice again
[1:13:04] what brother Bram says our Great Hopes
[1:13:07] is this that one of these days the
[1:13:09] spirit of God will send back Jesus
[1:13:11] Christ to the Earth and then it'll be
[1:13:14] perfect then that'll be the real
[1:13:16] standard and so here the Lord himself
[1:13:19] shall descend with the shout a voice and
[1:13:23] a trump and then notice what follows
[1:13:26] this dissension notice not that we just
[1:13:30] start another age and people just get
[1:13:32] you know excited but the dead in Christ
[1:13:36] shall rise first and then we which are
[1:13:39] alive and remain are going to be changed
[1:13:43] how many believes that we're all going
[1:13:45] to be changed and we shall be caught up
[1:13:49] and together with him to meet the Lord
[1:13:52] in the
[1:13:53] air right
[1:13:56] amen now that's the
[1:13:58] effect of the Lord coming yes sir prise
[1:14:02] the Lord can you say
[1:14:04] amen and he comes just before the
[1:14:07] tribulation sets in full now this
[1:14:10] disension of the Lord himself is the
[1:14:13] Fulfillment of Jesus's prophecy as we've
[1:14:16] read so many times there in Luke and
[1:14:19] then shall they see the son of man
[1:14:21] coming in a cloud with power and great
[1:14:23] glory and when you see these things
[1:14:25] begin to come to pass then look up what
[1:14:28] are you supposed to do look up can you
[1:14:30] say Amen you're not supposed to despair
[1:14:33] you're you're not supposed to be filled
[1:14:35] with fear after looking over those
[1:14:37] things that are coming upon the Earth
[1:14:39] that's not your your portion of
[1:14:41] scripture that's not your allotted
[1:14:42] promise when you see these things and
[1:14:45] you see the son of man coming with the
[1:14:47] cloud with great power and Glory look
[1:14:52] up amen amen your strength is is
[1:14:56] herey prise the
[1:14:58] Lord look up and lift up your head for
[1:15:01] your Redemption draweth nigh the
[1:15:05] changing of your
[1:15:08] bodies and you say
[1:15:10] Amen see if you notice he doesn't come
[1:15:13] to the Earth to die
[1:15:15] again he's come to
[1:15:17] claim come to claim what he has redeemed
[1:15:21] and the prophet said the seventh seal
[1:15:24] brings him back to Earth the lamb come
[1:15:27] and took the book out of the right hand
[1:15:29] of him and sat down and claimed what he
[1:15:33] had owned what he had redeemed what he
[1:15:36] owned what he had redeemed ain't that
[1:15:38] right see he says the son of man Jesus
[1:15:41] Christ will come down in human flesh
[1:15:44] Among Us and will make his word so real
[1:15:48] everybody say so real you see the
[1:15:50] standard god making his word more real
[1:15:53] more positive all the time now here it
[1:15:56] is the son of man Jesus Christ will come
[1:15:59] down in human flesh Among Us and will
[1:16:02] make his word so real that it'll unite
[1:16:05] the church in him as one the bride and
[1:16:09] then she'll go home to the wedding
[1:16:11] supper there's never been a standard
[1:16:13] such like this we thank God for the eag
[1:16:16] or the ox we thank God for the lion we
[1:16:18] thank God for amen the face of the man
[1:16:21] but it never was a power that could
[1:16:23] change and give the church a strength
[1:16:25] amen for a Rapture can you sayen but
[1:16:28] here we find God is our strength he
[1:16:31] himself
[1:16:33] comes he
[1:16:34] himself comes in human flesh now the son
[1:16:38] of man you see the son of man is Christ
[1:16:41] you believe that is what a prophet said
[1:16:44] the son of man is Christ yes sir what is
[1:16:46] Christ Christ is the word and the word
[1:16:49] comes to a prophet can you say Amen the
[1:16:53] son of man is Christ amen so if he comes
[1:16:56] amen it it's Christ amen and and Christ
[1:16:59] is the word and the word doesn't come to
[1:17:02] a theologian it comes to a prophet amen
[1:17:05] see so before the son of man Christ
[1:17:07] could come there had to be a prophet on
[1:17:09] Earth for him the word to come
[1:17:13] to this is why Malachi 4 is a promise to
[1:17:16] us it's our hope it's our life it's it's
[1:17:19] something we cling to for Malachi 4:5
[1:17:22] behold I will send you Elijah of the
[1:17:25] Prophet before the coming and of the
[1:17:27] great and Dreadful day of the Lord God
[1:17:29] knew what what he was going to do before
[1:17:32] the tribulation sets in and the wrath of
[1:17:35] God it goes full-blown he would send the
[1:17:38] prophet and he would come to that
[1:17:40] Prophet to give us strength Hallelujah
[1:17:44] can you say
[1:17:45] amen God Likens His prophets as Eagles
[1:17:49] right he Likens His prophets as Eagles
[1:17:53] so he promised to send us an eagle amen
[1:17:57] that's right but he also calls himself
[1:17:59] an eagle ain't that right brother Brian
[1:18:03] said he is the great Jehovah Eagle amen
[1:18:06] now so now notice what a prophet says
[1:18:08] now how fitting and
[1:18:11] matching it is to Luke
[1:18:13] 17:30 where the son of man Eagle will be
[1:18:18] revealing himself so when we're looking
[1:18:21] at Eagle age it's not just a prophet
[1:18:23] coming amen but it's it's it's Jehovah
[1:18:27] Eagle the great Jehovah Eagle coming to
[1:18:31] a prophet Eagle amen and revealing
[1:18:34] himself can you say Amen the son of man
[1:18:37] Eagle will be revealing himself to bring
[1:18:40] to not all other worship places such as
[1:18:44] denominations and so forth see church we
[1:18:46] can verify and and and positively rest
[1:18:50] and know that this is the eagle age how
[1:18:54] many believe that amen if you believe
[1:18:56] this message you got to know that this
[1:18:58] is the eagle age and it wasn't just a
[1:19:00] prophet Eagle it was great Jehovah Eagle
[1:19:04] coming to a prophet revealing
[1:19:09] himself now notice brother brah said as
[1:19:13] it was in the days of lot so will it be
[1:19:15] in the hours of the that the son of man
[1:19:18] will be revealed on Earth see not Son of
[1:19:21] God no more son of man come back as the
[1:19:25] prophetic message for the last day when
[1:19:27] that eagle will be flying not the lion
[1:19:30] not the ox in the sacrifice age see
[1:19:33] every time a religious power went forth
[1:19:35] to meet the challenge of the political
[1:19:37] power of the world see every time see a
[1:19:40] religious power went forth so when the
[1:19:42] line raised up the religious power see
[1:19:45] it went to meet the Roman power and when
[1:19:48] then when come the sacrifice hour the ox
[1:19:51] went because he's the sacrifice beast of
[1:19:54] the Lord
[1:19:55] then come the reformers down through the
[1:19:57] church Ages come the face of a man and
[1:19:59] the reformers had been since Luther
[1:20:02] Wesley oh Calvin and on down down
[1:20:04] Pentecostal age and all that but in the
[1:20:07] last message everybody say the last
[1:20:09] message see in the last message that
[1:20:12] went forth there came a flying eagle
[1:20:14] it's Eagle time it's revealed time the
[1:20:19] word of God made manifest the word of
[1:20:22] God proven can you say man
[1:20:25] it's Eagle time revealed time the word
[1:20:28] of God made manifest the word of God
[1:20:31] proven amen that's the standard God
[1:20:34] raising up a standard you can't get a
[1:20:36] greater standard than what we've got
[1:20:39] when the full word of God is being made
[1:20:41] manifest and real which is Jesus Christ
[1:20:45] amen manifested in Us in human
[1:20:49] flesh you see in the Old Testament it
[1:20:52] was Christ in Noah it was Christ in
[1:20:54] David it was Christ in Moses it was
[1:20:56] Christ in all the prophets amen Christ
[1:20:59] Christ Christ and all the types and
[1:21:01] shadows and Christ in the songs and but
[1:21:04] each one of them had a portion of the
[1:21:07] word but the prophet said the full
[1:21:10] manifestation of God's word the full
[1:21:12] everybody say the full
[1:21:14] manifestation not portion not part full
[1:21:18] manifestation of God's word was made
[1:21:20] known through Jesus Christ the spirit of
[1:21:23] God he was the full manifestation of
[1:21:26] Jehovah God made flesh to dwell Among Us
[1:21:30] aren't you glad for that the fullness of
[1:21:32] the godhead dwelt bodily in him he he
[1:21:35] was he was it he was the Psalms he was
[1:21:38] the Poetry he was he was what David
[1:21:41] lived and said and and and acted out he
[1:21:44] he was all the types and shadows amen
[1:21:46] that spoke of Messiah he was that one
[1:21:49] ain't that right amen so he was not just
[1:21:52] saying you know uh uh all the prophets
[1:21:54] he's coming there is to come thus sayith
[1:21:57] the Lord amen pointing the people Amen
[1:21:59] to a future coming of Messiah but when
[1:22:01] he got there he said I am he that that
[1:22:04] David spoke of I am he that Moses said
[1:22:06] wrote about I am he search all the
[1:22:08] scriptures and they testify of who I am
[1:22:11] can you say amen he was the full
[1:22:14] manifestation of Jehovah God made flesh
[1:22:17] to dwell Among Us now that same logos
[1:22:20] has a part amen see he has got a bride
[1:22:25] and the same logos this word that cannot
[1:22:27] be tampered with is brooding over the
[1:22:30] churches today trying to bring back the
[1:22:33] word to full
[1:22:35] manifestation why to give full strength
[1:22:38] to the church
[1:22:40] amen can you say amen amen yes sir amen
[1:22:45] see amen see another place he was only
[1:22:48] manifested in temporarily in the other
[1:22:51] churches in the form of justification so
[1:22:54] but in here the age that's coming now
[1:22:57] and we can say the age that now is the
[1:23:00] full manifestation of the Vindication of
[1:23:03] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:23:07] and forever this is that
[1:23:10] age it's a full
[1:23:12] manifestation full manif amen see what
[1:23:15] is it it's Eagle age amen when Satan has
[1:23:19] gathered all of his
[1:23:22] powersall God
[1:23:25] himself he reveals himself full
[1:23:30] manifestation where in a Corporal body
[1:23:33] no his
[1:23:35] bride that's the real
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:40] standard I hope that's all
[1:23:42] right so brother Bram says see today
[1:23:46] before Jesus comes again the full
[1:23:48] manifestation of the person of Jesus
[1:23:51] Christ is to be manifested in flesh
[1:23:54] think of it Jesus said as it was in the
[1:23:56] days of Sodom so shall it be at the
[1:23:58] coming of the son of man when the son of
[1:24:00] man is being
[1:24:02] revealed amen now notice what a prophet
[1:24:05] preached Christ is revealed in his own
[1:24:10] Worden to see Christ you got to see him
[1:24:13] in here ain't that right your strength
[1:24:16] is here amen your salvation is here
[1:24:20] Christ is revealed in his own word see
[1:24:23] that's why when they'd look at the cloud
[1:24:26] Amen in Tucson no one figured out what
[1:24:28] it was it went into Life Magazine across
[1:24:31] the the United States maybe around the
[1:24:33] world I don't know amen but but when
[1:24:35] they looked at it they had no idea but
[1:24:38] when we could see it in the word and we
[1:24:40] can compare it we see Christ has come in
[1:24:43] a cloud amen with power and great glory
[1:24:47] amen we see it see Christ is revealed in
[1:24:50] his own word now notice when the word is
[1:24:53] third L
[1:24:55] identified Amen to be Vindicated for
[1:24:58] that day that is the message of the day
[1:25:02] of the hour you believe that Hallelujah
[1:25:05] say that again when the word is
[1:25:06] Thoroughly identified it doesn't matter
[1:25:09] amen all kinds of interpretations of the
[1:25:11] word today but when the word is
[1:25:14] Thoroughly identified to be Vindicated
[1:25:17] for that day that is the message of the
[1:25:20] hour another quote he's revealed in this
[1:25:23] Bible what he would do in this age and
[1:25:27] we see him and when we see him do it
[1:25:30] when we see him do what he promised to
[1:25:32] do see not a virgin birth that was 2,000
[1:25:36] years ago but what he promised to do
[1:25:38] today what he said he would do today
[1:25:41] that's what he is today
[1:25:45] amen can you say amenl that's what he
[1:25:51] is so then we can say Amen with brother
[1:25:54] brandham when he said the message is
[1:25:57] Christ he's the
[1:25:59] word the message is
[1:26:02] Christ because this message fits right
[1:26:05] with the
[1:26:06] Bible everything that that that took
[1:26:09] place comes from the
[1:26:12] scriptures now he said the only way that
[1:26:14] he can
[1:26:16] reveal is to come into you see he is he
[1:26:20] can he is the word and the word in you
[1:26:24] then the Holy Spirit reveals Christ
[1:26:26] through the word after he gets in you
[1:26:30] he's in you and then you must take his
[1:26:32] word can you say amen amen now Psalms 28
[1:26:38] and7 it says the Lord is my strength and
[1:26:41] my shield my heart trusted in him and I
[1:26:46] am helped therefore my heart greatly
[1:26:50] rejoiceth I think if there's ever a
[1:26:52] people that should be rejoicing in this
[1:26:54] age it's us we should be the happiest
[1:26:57] people even when troubles come and
[1:26:59] Trials come we we should be thankful to
[1:27:02] the
[1:27:03] Lord amen my heart greatly rejoices and
[1:27:08] with my song will I praise him the Lord
[1:27:11] is their strength he is the saving
[1:27:16] strength of his anointed am think of
[1:27:20] that he is the saving strength of his
[1:27:24] anointed his
[1:27:25] elect amen see so he he the manifested
[1:27:31] word is the saving
[1:27:34] strength to his people can you say Amen
[1:27:39] now I won't take much longer but notice
[1:27:42] how strength comes to us he has come in
[1:27:45] his word he's revealed through his word
[1:27:49] that word's been Vindicated over and
[1:27:51] over to where we know that we don't say
[1:27:54] so so it it we see it clearly to where
[1:27:57] we say you know we don't need to get the
[1:27:59] message you know people to Christ before
[1:28:01] we get them to the message we see it so
[1:28:04] clearly that we know that Christ is the
[1:28:06] message when you get him to the message
[1:28:08] you're getting him to Christ if if and
[1:28:11] and that's just the truth now if if if
[1:28:13] you don't believe that then you don't
[1:28:15] see the message you you just you're
[1:28:17] missing the whole point amen because
[1:28:19] again brother bradam says amen that the
[1:28:22] word vindicat hated amen well look he's
[1:28:26] revealed in this Bible what he would do
[1:28:29] in this age when we see it do it and
[1:28:32] when we seek him do what he promised to
[1:28:34] do ain't that right not a virgin birth
[1:28:37] don't take him back to a virgin birth
[1:28:40] amen that was 2,000 years ago but what
[1:28:43] he promised to do today what he said he
[1:28:45] would do today that's what he is
[1:28:51] today so then the message is Christ
[1:28:54] that's right can you say Amen no wonder
[1:28:57] the prophet said we're getting them to
[1:28:58] church but not to Christ now he wasn't
[1:29:00] talking to about message people amen
[1:29:02] there wasn't message churches on the on
[1:29:04] the face of the Earth at that time he
[1:29:06] was talking to the Pentecostals and
[1:29:08] denominations and all of that they were
[1:29:10] getting them to a program they were
[1:29:12] getting them to a Doctrine they were
[1:29:13] getting them to their idea and not
[1:29:15] getting them to Christ amen but we see
[1:29:19] Christ in his word amen because it's
[1:29:22] been Vindicated amen can you say man and
[1:29:25] he's the saving strength now notice how
[1:29:27] this strink comes to us John
[1:29:30] 6:47 I am the living bread which came
[1:29:34] down from heaven If any man eat of this
[1:29:37] bread he shall live forever and the
[1:29:39] bread that I will give is my flesh which
[1:29:43] I will give for the life of the world
[1:29:46] 54th verse who so eateth my flesh and
[1:29:49] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[1:29:51] I will raise him up at the last day for
[1:29:53] my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is
[1:29:56] drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and
[1:29:58] drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and die
[1:30:01] in him as the father living father has
[1:30:04] sent me and I live by the father so he
[1:30:06] that eateth me even he shall live by me
[1:30:11] can you say Amen so
[1:30:13] so look now his body is the word that's
[1:30:17] what the brother Bram said that's what
[1:30:19] Jesus was trying to get to now the
[1:30:21] carnal mind in that day says oh now he's
[1:30:23] telling us to eat
[1:30:25] him you know he he's we're not cannibals
[1:30:28] right and so they want us to he wants us
[1:30:31] to devour his flesh and they walked away
[1:30:33] cuz they didn't understand and he didn't
[1:30:36] beg them to come back he just he looked
[1:30:37] at the others that still there and said
[1:30:39] would you go also but but but notice
[1:30:43] what he was trying to tell them is is
[1:30:47] I'm the word yeah I'm the word you you
[1:30:51] got to eat me the word hello amen if
[1:30:55] you're going to live you got to eat the
[1:30:58] word see so so his body is the word
[1:31:02] because he is the word manifested in
[1:31:05] flesh so he tells the church this this
[1:31:09] which I am giv you the word is a
[1:31:13] revelation of myself I'm the
[1:31:17] word I'm giving you a revelation of
[1:31:22] myself that's what you've got to
[1:31:27] eat that's why we're not eating
[1:31:29] doctrinal uh uh bapt Baptist doctrines
[1:31:33] and Presbyterian doctrines and and and
[1:31:36] what they they had Truth for back then
[1:31:38] that's fine I don't argue with any of
[1:31:40] you if you say well they have truth they
[1:31:43] had truth but what they have today is
[1:31:46] rotten
[1:31:49] amen can you say amen amen see and and
[1:31:54] so so we're we're but but in this age he
[1:31:57] has come to reveal himself son of
[1:32:04] man so now notice brother Bram said we
[1:32:07] receive him in the form of the word we
[1:32:12] receive him he is our strength amen we
[1:32:15] receive him in the form of the word
[1:32:18] Matthew 4:4 Jesus said it is written man
[1:32:20] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:32:22] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:32:24] mouth of God brother bramwood said it
[1:32:26] this way the man shall not live by bread
[1:32:28] alone but out of the bosom of God shall
[1:32:31] he nurse his
[1:32:34] strength hello every word that comes out
[1:32:37] of the mouth of God shall he receive his
[1:32:40] strength as he comes from the mouth of
[1:32:43] God the word so as the word comes from
[1:32:46] the mouth of God and and we know it's
[1:32:48] the Vindicated word and the word can
[1:32:51] only be come through a prophet
[1:32:55] and as that word comes amen we draw
[1:33:00] strength by receiving it by eating it by
[1:33:03] believing
[1:33:05] it can you say Amen so brother brandom
[1:33:09] said this he said we sit in like in the
[1:33:11] message this morning we listen our souls
[1:33:15] grabbing reaching grab that word we live
[1:33:20] by the word that's why every service is
[1:33:23] is important amen this is why playing
[1:33:26] the tapes is
[1:33:27] important amen because you you and and
[1:33:31] and not just playing it and so amen but
[1:33:33] listening to it let your soul reach out
[1:33:36] and grasp the meaning of
[1:33:42] it Matthew
[1:33:44] 24:28 wheresoever the carcass is there
[1:33:47] will the Eagles be gathered
[1:33:49] together Luke 17:37 says it this way
[1:33:53] where wheresoever the body
[1:33:55] is the
[1:33:58] word thither will the Eagles be gathered
[1:34:01] together yes sir what is the carcass
[1:34:04] brother bramon calls it this the fresh
[1:34:06] kill of the word the word that's raised
[1:34:09] up and fattened and being made manifest
[1:34:13] and give out to the food for the
[1:34:15] children it's given out for food to the
[1:34:19] children give out for food to the elect
[1:34:22] can you say Amen God wouldn't have
[1:34:24] wasted his time amen by sending this
[1:34:27] message if there was not anyone going in
[1:34:29] a Rapture but somebody's going in a
[1:34:31] Rapture and somebody's got to take this
[1:34:34] message as food and get strengthen for a
[1:34:37] body

[1:34:56] believe it you ain't going in the
[1:34:58] Rapture without this
[1:35:01] message it may be strong but that's just
[1:35:03] what I believe and I believe it's it's
[1:35:05] scriptural I believe it's it's message I
[1:35:07] believe it's everything this why we must
[1:35:09] not treat this message lightly let it be
[1:35:12] your daily diet can you say Amen now
[1:35:16] notice brother Bram says Christians will
[1:35:19] not eat on that dead carryon from old
[1:35:22] denominational doctrines and things they
[1:35:24] want the word of God
[1:35:27] fresh that's what Believers
[1:35:29] want they they they don't want what was
[1:35:32] given yesterday and and in the ages is
[1:35:35] pasted they want their food fresh see
[1:35:38] the word of God fresh the promise of the
[1:35:42] hour are you with me church God promised
[1:35:45] rabbits in the days of Luther he
[1:35:48] promised other things in the days of
[1:35:50] others but now he promised us a full
[1:35:54] Square meal the full seven course menu
[1:35:57] for all the Seven Seals are opened and
[1:36:00] everything is ready for the word of God
[1:36:02] to those who can receive
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:08] it rabbit DT ain't going to get you in a
[1:36:10] Rapture all this other ain't going to
[1:36:13] get you in a Rapture but God a present
[1:36:16] help in the time of trouble he came down
[1:36:19] with an open book amen and began to give
[1:36:22] strength and to his
[1:36:25] church he did Brother Bram said it's
[1:36:28] going to take more faith than ever was
[1:36:30] in any age for this has to be rapturing
[1:36:33] Faith to be taken up oh church I I I
[1:36:37] don't know I you know sometimes Satan is
[1:36:39] good at trying to get us to doubt our
[1:36:42] own our own uh uh relationship with God
[1:36:46] Satan is good to get us to question well
[1:36:49] whether he really loves me am I really
[1:36:50] in this and and and all these things but
[1:36:53] may God give us strength amen receive
[1:36:56] strength for yourself to where you can
[1:36:58] believe for
[1:37:00] yourself believe for yourself can you
[1:37:04] say Amen it's going to take more faith
[1:37:07] more faith right then than ever was in
[1:37:11] any age for this has to be rapturing
[1:37:13] Faith to be taken up see so rabbit food
[1:37:16] ain't going to get us chicken food ain't
[1:37:19] going to get us little whatever was back
[1:37:22] in the ages isn't going to get us amen
[1:37:24] it's going to take a rapturing faith in
[1:37:26] this age more faith than it ever was
[1:37:29] amen and brother brand called that
[1:37:30] rapturing Faith the faith of this hour
[1:37:34] you say well I got faith it's got to be
[1:37:36] rapturing
[1:37:38] Faith that's why brother Brandon would
[1:37:40] say Lord You're preparing your people to
[1:37:42] believe for all things that's
[1:37:47] right can you say Amen so that's what
[1:37:50] the prophet's desire was and this is
[1:37:53] God's desire is he wanted us to get
[1:37:56] built up in
[1:37:58] faith rapturing
[1:38:00] faith can you say Amen see because
[1:38:04] rapturing Faith again again rapturing
[1:38:07] faith is what's going to pull the church
[1:38:10] together and give it some Supernatural
[1:38:12] strength that can change our bodies amen
[1:38:15] now notice brother Braham said I believe
[1:38:18] that through those seven Thunders will
[1:38:20] be revealed in the last days in order to
[1:38:23] get the bride together for rapturing
[1:38:26] Faith oh my Lord hello
[1:38:30] church I believe that it's the seven
[1:38:33] Thunders I know everybody making big
[1:38:35] deal about seven Thunders and they're
[1:38:36] making Mysteries where there is no
[1:38:38] mystery yeah on the seven Thunders it's
[1:38:41] getting to the point you can't even
[1:38:42] preach talk about seven Thunders or they
[1:38:44] tie you to a certain
[1:38:46] movement but the Bible talks about them
[1:38:49] brother brandham talked about them and
[1:38:50] he said them seven Thunders is what's
[1:38:52] going to give of us the rapturing faith
[1:38:55] brother Brown said the Thunders is the
[1:38:57] voice of God
[1:38:59] uttering can you say amen amen it's
[1:39:03] opened the book it's revealed the
[1:39:05] Mysteries to us it's the voice of
[1:39:09] God hallelujah so we could say it the
[1:39:12] voice of God will be uh uh
[1:39:19] sounding opening the Mysteries
[1:39:24] to bring the church together and give it
[1:39:26] rapturing Faith he says because what we
[1:39:29] got right now we wouldn't be able to do
[1:39:31] it and he's talking about back then he
[1:39:34] what we got ain't going to do it he's
[1:39:36] trying to get them Pentecostals to
[1:39:38] understand all you're speaking in
[1:39:40] tongues and you're prophesying and
[1:39:41] rolling on the floor and shaking that
[1:39:43] ain't going to do
[1:39:45] it having emotional fits hey I'm
[1:39:48] emotional and I love the good old time
[1:39:51] but that ain't going to do it amen
[1:39:54] right on now it'll take them seven
[1:39:59] Thunders the revealing of them
[1:40:03] Thunders to get the bride together for
[1:40:05] rapturing Faith he said see there's
[1:40:08] something we've got to step further we
[1:40:10] can't have now notice we can't have
[1:40:13] enough faith for Divine Healing hardly
[1:40:16] we've got to have enough Faith to be
[1:40:17] changed in a moment and be swept up out
[1:40:20] of this Earth and we'll find that after
[1:40:22] a while the Lord will find where it's
[1:40:25] written see so so you
[1:40:29] know uh uh so here another place he says
[1:40:32] We Gather here which he's talking about
[1:40:35] you know coming like this but he says We
[1:40:38] Gather here for Spiritual
[1:40:41] strength we we're not gathered here to
[1:40:43] see what kind of a Preacher we get and
[1:40:45] about about the musicians how well they
[1:40:47] do and and and pick the service apart
[1:40:50] and all the we're just gathered here for
[1:40:52] Spiritual strength
[1:40:54] we realize that we're in a rapturing
[1:40:57] age Church don't disqualify
[1:41:01] Church don't don't don't just discount
[1:41:04] uh coming together seems like
[1:41:06] everybody's got so many things to do
[1:41:07] that that that you just hardly find a
[1:41:09] diseal for come to the house of God
[1:41:13] anymore and that's just getting
[1:41:15] everywhere but church if we can realize
[1:41:18] and I understand you got oxes in the
[1:41:19] ditch and things that you've got to take
[1:41:21] care of so I'm not knocking all that but
[1:41:23] I'm I'm just talking about we get more
[1:41:26] excuses every
[1:41:30] day but if we can understand we come
[1:41:33] here it may be an hour and a half two
[1:41:36] hours or whatever but these are precious
[1:41:40] times because we're gathered here for
[1:41:42] Spiritual
[1:41:45] strength any day the Lord is
[1:41:48] coming any day this body is going to
[1:41:51] change
[1:41:53] praise our God can you say amen
[1:41:56] hallelujah last
[1:41:58] Sunday you know I read where brother
[1:42:00] brand talked about this message being
[1:42:02] hidden
[1:42:03] food and he said help this morning Lord
[1:42:07] as we read the word May the Holy Spirit
[1:42:09] reveal it to us that the church might be
[1:42:12] fully established in the faith in the
[1:42:16] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:42:18] Saints to hold them and may as you gave
[1:42:23] the vision some two years ago to store
[1:42:25] up the food fine healthy looking
[1:42:28] vegetables that I saw in the vision
[1:42:31] being stored here in this Tabernacle may
[1:42:33] we today receive a whole barrel full of
[1:42:36] that Granite Lord or a tape full tape
[1:42:39] load that it might reveal Jesus Christ
[1:42:43] to us in the hour that we live to give
[1:42:46] us sustaining strength the spiritual
[1:42:49] strength for the task that lays ahead
[1:42:52] can you say amen so so we're again you
[1:42:55] know I can't say it enough and I hope
[1:42:57] I'm not just you know uh uh dragging
[1:42:59] this thought out you know in this
[1:43:01] subject amen but but I I just this you
[1:43:05] know this message is dear to me and the
[1:43:06] more I I you know and I don't understand
[1:43:09] at all I promise you that and and but I
[1:43:12] sure seek to but but I do I I I'm I'm
[1:43:16] understanding more of the value of it
[1:43:18] that that without this message we it's
[1:43:20] the grace of God that I can understand
[1:43:22] the message message believe the message
[1:43:24] able to hear the message go to a message
[1:43:27] church because I would be left without
[1:43:29] it
[1:43:30] Hallelujah I would have no hope that's
[1:43:34] right but I've got a food a food for
[1:43:37] this day the carcass has revealed it's
[1:43:41] revealed the son of
[1:43:47] man you love
[1:43:49] him bless Lord see so the Vindicated
[1:43:53] truth is God's provided way to bring
[1:43:56] Believers to a rapturing
[1:43:58] faith if the musicians will
[1:44:01] come brother Braham said Do you believe
[1:44:04] someday he'll come in and make us free
[1:44:07] he said I do too come to the grave and
[1:44:10] open the doors I'll come out from among
[1:44:13] the dead I'm trusting
[1:44:17] him he is here tonight isn't isn't it
[1:44:20] wonderful to know that we don't have to
[1:44:22] take some human philosophy we got a
[1:44:25] Bible here that speaks of this and here
[1:44:28] he is to identify his church to give it
[1:44:31] rapturing Faith to be taken away
[1:44:35] hallelujah hallelujah so what was the
[1:44:37] message what is the purpose of the
[1:44:39] revealing of the son of man to give it
[1:44:41] rapturing Faith he is our strength can
[1:44:45] you say amen amen that he's not dead
[1:44:48] He's Alive Amen brother BR said when we
[1:44:51] see the dead raised and when we see all
[1:44:53] all these Miracles and Supernatural
[1:44:54] things he said it ought to give us
[1:44:56] Rapture in faith amen it ought to bring

[1:55:42] glad you're

[1:55:46] going in a
[1:55:47] Rapture Church feed off the word of
[1:55:50] God build your
[1:55:53] strength build your
[1:55:55] strength and it's again it's not just
[1:55:58] playing the tape it's it's it's
[1:56:00] conditioning
[1:56:02] yourself you know brother Brian said you
[1:56:04] can't see things until you get in the
[1:56:06] spirit get in the spirit live in that
[1:56:09] Spirit walk in the spirit you know and
[1:56:13] and I know we got our daily
[1:56:15] things that we do but I believe that we
[1:56:19] can still live in the spirit as we go
[1:56:22] through life don't don't let the world
[1:56:24] take that from you you know I I know
[1:56:28] we sometime we we it's easy to get our
[1:56:32] minds wrapped up on social
[1:56:35] media and and I I think it's becoming
[1:56:37] more of a detriment than
[1:56:40] anything and and we should get away from
[1:56:43] that stuff to where we can Center our
[1:56:47] mind and our heart upon the word of God
[1:56:51] because you ain't going in Rapture by
[1:56:54] feeding off social media you just ain't
[1:56:58] you know but you
[1:57:00] will the rapt this message will give you
[1:57:03] that rapturing Faith so so stay with God
[1:57:08] stay with his word amen may God bless
[1:57:12] you and uh just want to say uh Heather
[1:57:16] and I and the boys will be headed to

[1:57:42] recording and his part and I'm going
[1:57:44] tomorrow so Friday and Saturday will be
[1:57:47] uh full of uh recording and I was going

[1:57:53] uh Jonathan uh brother Jonathan had
[1:57:56] asked if he had got wind that I was
[1:57:58] going to be in town and so he had asked
[1:58:00] if I would Minister and and U so uh just
[1:58:06] kind of waited for a little bit just
[1:58:08] wondering what to do but just
[1:58:11] felt uh comfortable with doing that and
[1:58:13] so we're going to be I'll be ministering
[1:58:16] the Lord willing for brother Jonathan on
[1:58:18] on Sunday morning and then we'll be
[1:58:21] heading back home

[1:58:41] that the Lord will just be with us help
[1:58:43] us in the recording thing and and also
[1:58:46] in the ministering of the Gospel um and

[1:58:54] around the corner it's actually next
[1:58:55] week next Wednesday so there will be no
[1:58:59] service
[1:59:00] Wednesday uh you know next Wednesday and
[1:59:04] so uh if I don't uh get to see you all
[1:59:08] before Christmas time Merry Christmas to
[1:59:10] you all and I just pray that you have a
[1:59:13] wonderful time with family and things
[1:59:16] but don't forget the reason why you know
[1:59:19] what this is all about you know uh don't
[1:59:22] don't get so wrapped up in the gifts and
[1:59:24] the the carnal side of things that uh we
[1:59:28] lose focus upon the real thing and
[1:59:31] that's what Christ has done for us can
[1:59:33] you say Amen so God bless you and um uh
[1:59:39] again remember service at
[1:59:40] 11:00 and brother Tim Farmer will'll be
[1:59:44] ministering and we want to just pray for
[1:59:45] different ones that are not feeling good
[1:59:48] and uh also uh just asking a special
[1:59:53] prayer for sister Martha and uh she's
[1:59:57] right now just needing our prayer and so
[2:00:01] uh just things are happening in her body
[2:00:05] and uh she's losing strength and I won't
[2:00:08] go into a lot of detail with it but um
[2:00:12] she's just she's exhausted just tired
[2:00:15] and uh something is is going on they're
[2:00:17] going to be doing blood work on the
[2:00:19] second and um you know and I understand
[2:00:22] the devil can put a lot of fear in in an
[2:00:25] individual and uh get them thinking the
[2:00:28] worst and things but she's been going
[2:00:30] through things for a while now and and
[2:00:33] um um just not able they they'
[2:00:37] discovered she's anemic but but
[2:00:39] something's causing this and anyways
[2:00:42] just some other things and so uh uh I'd
[2:00:46] asked if it was okay to and just ask you
[2:00:49] all to pray so uh uh if you don't mind
[2:00:53] hold sister Martha in your prayer uh she
[2:00:56] really needs our prayer right now you
[2:00:58] know and so take this to heart now and
[2:01:02] uh that God will be with her and uh I'm
[2:01:05] just believing God for a miracle he God
[2:01:08] done it for my mom uh you know and uh
[2:01:11] mom she was you know uh uh going through
[2:01:16] some issues kind of the same things uh
[2:01:20] and uh but that God just intervened and
[2:01:24] worked a miracle and so uh uh I know God
[2:01:29] can do the same for sister Martha in
[2:01:31] this just way we're believing so just
[2:01:34] continue to pray uh for that I just I
[2:01:37] know Daniel had ask but I ask you to
[2:01:39] pray for my dad and um you know he's
[2:01:42] he's been doing a lot better being in
[2:01:45] rehab but uh he's choking choking a lot
[2:01:49] and uh uh the doctor you know back in
[2:01:53] the day when this Parkinson first was
[2:01:57] diagnosed he you know he basically told
[2:02:01] us that's that's the final thing is the
[2:02:04] choking and uh so that's you know that's
[2:02:07] kind of hard but um so you know he's
[2:02:13] just just pray uh for that and um they
[2:02:18] can't get the fluid off his heart for
[2:02:19] some reason and so uh he'll be going
[2:02:22] home uh with oxygen and um and so but
[2:02:27] he's in good spirits and um uh you know
[2:02:31] doing doing good in that way regard and
[2:02:34] I know whether the Lord decides to take
[2:02:37] him or not I I believe he's ready to
[2:02:40] meet the Lord and uh but you know how it
[2:02:43] is you always like your dad to be around
[2:02:47] and been a certainly a help to me so God
[2:02:50] bless you is our prayer and uh just keep
[2:02:54] one another in our prayer may God just
[2:02:56] bind us together into real love deep
[2:03:00] love amen the love of God Amen and so
[2:03:05] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[2:03:07] prayer brother Amos would you want
