operate the gift that it's not a Showmanship um uh a minister when he comes he's not he doesn't come to to to to clown around and to excite us but he comes with the message and then we pull on that gift and that's what operates God it's not all on the preacher but it's it takes the preacher preaching preaching the message preaching the word being anointed in that way having that gift and then we pulling on that gift amen and then watch God just come down and move in a supernatural way and I believe he's going to be with us tonight amen so let's just sing this song God still moves in the heart

presence of God and somebody's life has changed somebody's heart's changed and and we can always expect good things from the Lord amen amen he he made promises in his Bible and that's why we have

myself there and all the saints and amen just want to say we love you all amen if we could bow our hearts tonight for a word of prayer amen we just want to thank the Lord for his mercy and if you have

thank you Father for your mercy Lord that would just bring a a comfortable anointing Lord for your word and Lord we want to make you welcome and comfortable in the house of God we want to just pull back the doors and invite you to come in Lord and and father not just in the things that on the surface Lord but we ask you Lord that you would just pull back the pages of the scripture Lord and open unto us your mind and will for the age we live in Lord we want to worship you in your secrets and in your mystery oh God and and just have that deep fellowship with you Lord and anything you would bring to us we just want to praise you for it and give you honor now Lord we're asking you bless your children Lord take this word and use it tonight Speak Lord For Your Glory we pray in Jesus name amen and amen and God bless you if you have your Bibles tonight we just like to look in the book of Ephesians uh the first chapter and we want to look in the ninth and the 10th verse man it's good to have brother Isaac with us tonight he drove us all the way down and amen he got that wife and little baby at home but he come to be a part of the services and we appreciate him driving us over and being a part amen Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 9 and verse 10 now having made known unto us us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation now that word dispensation you could use a different word that to it's it's actually the translation in the Greek would be Administration so if you say dispensation is like if you have a big tub of soap you know you got a big five gallon bucket of soap you want to put it in the put it in the bathro bathroom you don't put five gallon in the bathroom you put it in a dispenser so that's the dispensation or the way that something is dispensed he said that in the dispensation of the fullness of times that he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen we ask the Lord to bless his word you could be seated tonight uh I want to if I can just speak to you from these scriptures for a little bit here tonight and I want to take here from this topic amen last night speaking about he has come as the rain and I want to speak to you a little bit tonight on this he has come to reveal the mystery of his will he has come to reveal the mystery of his will amen God don't do anything without a purpose right so if he's so if he's coming in this age we're living in the there's a purpose behind his coming amen and I I want to uh maybe on the the front of this just read you something I think is very powerful it's a bit of a it's a bit of a uh just a uh a definition of the word mystery having made known the mystery of something amen making known unto us the mystery secret of his will his plan or of his purpose that is in accordance with his good pleasure his merciful intention which he previous purposed and set forth in him planned for the maturity of the times and the climax of the ages to unify all things and to head them up and consummate them in Christ both things in heaven and in Earth now this this word mystery here is the word Mysterion which means literally something into which one must be initiated before it is fully known the word mui is the word initiate or to instruct and that anything which is concealed or hidden we commonly use the word to denote that which is above our comprehension or that that's unintelligible but this is never the meaning of the word in the New Testament it means there is some Doctrine or some fact which has been concealed or which has not been before fully revealed or has been set forth only by figures and symbols then the doctrine is made known it may be as clear and plain as any other so it's something that has been laying in Scripture that has been hid but it's been laying there maybe in types like Ruth and Tamar and it's been laying there in all kinds of types and you remember brother Bram said the seven seal was in every type that was in the scripture but it was actually laying there now it was hid from the eyes and it was unknown but then when it's revealed it's as easily understood as any other Doctrine in the scripture because then it's revealed you have the answer to it now we find out the prophet tells us something in the adoption uh part part four brother R will say see there's there's something tied to this in the mystery and I want to give you something he says here he said there's three things in this mystery he said there will be the mystery of his coming amen number one the mystery of his coming and then there will be the mystery of his will and then the mystery of us sitting together now here's the beautiful thing according to Revelations the 10th chapter that when the seventh angel begins to sound the mystery of God would be finished so tonight we're not speaking amen of it in a mystery form we're speaking of it in a plain form yet we call it a mystery but it's no longer hid from the church and and and and any hillbilly preacher could could preach it plainly at this point because the prophet has made it clear to the church so so we don't we don't have to have some uh high class guy or some great intellectual mind amen we could just simply take what the prophet of God said and it would been just as clear because it's a reality Amen in this generation amen now we are living according to the Feast of the trumpets the prophet of God said he said the people he says now that's believe in him how will they know unless they're constantly in the word of what he is now Daniel said the wise would know but the foolish and the unwise they wouldn't know and they shall know their God now he shall appear in the last days to bring the people back to the word so the bride will know her husband her mate the revealed word now what's the mate of the church the revealed word what was brother bam doing bringing us the revealed word he says now see her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen it wasn't the reformers was it in Luther was it in Wesley was it in the Pentecostals he said scripture says it wasn't but it will come and that is his promise for this age we are living in the age his coming will be in amen oh my now we're not just talking about his physical body we're talking about the coming of the son of man we're talking about God revealing himself in the token manifestation amen apart from the Rapture of the church see the whole world knows about the physical Return of the Lord amen that we're supposed to go meet him in the air what the world missed was amen the revealing of the son a man on the earth before we meet the Corporal body that's in heaven simply told with Abraham that there was a coming to midic before there was a coming of Isaac amen now we see this that the mystery of course amen is the mystery of his coming that he would have a coming mystery of the coming the mystery of his will now listen the mystery now brother Ram says see the scripture packed me back and Sh it the mystery of his coming the mystery of his wheel the mystery of us sitting together now the mystery of his is coming it's a very powerful thing because amen many sitting here tonight when you say the mystery of his coming you're looking off into something you don't understand but really you have the uh most of you uh even our young people hold the knowledge of it but the terminology amen sometimes gets lost in it and then they think it's some big something that they couldn't able to accept but then the Lord would show us easily now we use the word in the church Elohim and how many ever heard brother mam talk about it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and brother M said see back there he said there it was God he said self-existent one and brother R will switch the word God and he'll use the word Elohim because he said the word God now you got to be careful he said because God means in the English an object of worship he said so you could worship your piano he said you could worship your car he said see you make it a God he said but none of them is Elohim which is a self-existent one who then became worshiped right so then when you look into this then you see that whenever you go into the the secular world and they believe in polytheism and they think about all these Gods amen then they're going to take the word Elohim and they're going to tell you Elohim is plural amen and it is a plural word it's a it's a Hebrew word which is plural for it means uh uh uh Elohim means more than one it's an Elohim but you got to understand that Elohim does not mean more than one person it means more than one attribute so God is plural but he's not plural in person he's plural in attributes and then therefore we see that this is the mystery that was given unto Abraham that caused now remember who Abraham was he was living down in the valley of shenar confusion the fall out of Babylon when all the tongues were there and everybody spoke different languages and different ideas and they had all these gods they were worshiping but the truth of the one God came unto him and and then later he was out on the plains remember why God called him out cuz he said it's easier for me to call you out of Babylon and to make you a nation under yourself CU you're never going to convince all these trinitarians that there's only one God so you come out of that denomination out here to a place where I will make you a nation under yourself and your stars and the Sea will and the Sands of the sea will number the number of your children that's going to believe in only one God now then you see the revelation of it come near that when Abraham was sitting at the tent door one day and three men walk up to him and he said Lord amen now there's the Revelation and brother B said that Revelation put him in condition for the changing of his body look at what that Revelation did he could see three of them and he could say Lord because he already understood that the god of Heaven cannot be confined to one attribute he is a one person but he has many attributes and that attribute of God came down in the form of a man had dust on his clothes amen was weary in his body they washed his feet they fed him meat he had conversation with him but Abraham called him Lord later amen Paul speaking of him amen talk about when Abraham met him as mdct and he was a man he was a king he was a priest and he met him but then then Abraham am man of course Paul said then he was a man and he said what kind of man was he that Abra paid ties to him so brother Bram said he was a man but then he also said he was without beginning of days or ending of life so whoever he was he's still alive tonight so what kind of man was he he was the kind of man that God had picked up the elements and stepped into a body and begin to speak now Jesus seeing that same picture looked into the Old Testament picked out the story of Abraham and told the end time generation that as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man he lives two Secrets out right he says lot and Noah but amen the hidden part is Abraham and Enoch amen but there would be a generation that would receive the revelation of Elohim and know that when God returns in the end time it will be the one God the same God in the power of the Holy Ghost will drop down in the church and he will pick up human bodies and use them so much that we will know it's the Lord speaking through a man to show the Dynamics of the revelation of Jesus Christ may I say tonight Jesus is not a second person of a godhead Jesus is the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man and that Jesus is not in a tomb tonight that Jesus has been raised up to sit on the throne of God and he sent back the spirit of God into the church hallelujah hallelujah that's not another God come on it's the same one it's the coming of Elohim now you can go look through these quotes and I don't have time to lay it all in there tonight so we're going to preach it but you can go look it up if you like to study the message it's a powerful study just type in Elohim and look at that Elohim back in the bride Elohim materializing it's been the picture of God the whole time Elohim he said there he was the very life that was in the thinking of God of you is in the body tonight and he's already seen us gathered around his throne in the end do you see the mystery of Elohim is that God doesn't change so you're dealing with an unchanging God now that's powerful Church he's an unchanging God in other words he never changes his nature that's the rule of Malachi when he said I am God and I change not so God doesn't change he never changes his nature so whatever he was he is that's why it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so if he don't change his nature then what does he change brother Ram reveals it to the church he said that's where the scripture said that God was in the form of a servant he said that word form there is the word imor I'll pour out my spirit in the last day the word Kos which in Hebrew and in the Greek is showing the Revelation that it would be God who would be changing his mask it would not be another God he wouldn't change his nature he wouldn't change his person he would only change the mask that he was wearing the God that was above us became the God that was with us and became the god that is in us that's why it is Body Spirit and soul the God that was only in the body realm went into the spirit realm but but tonight he's in the realm of the Soul because the Son of God didn't start on any day you were Eternal to begin with and you're as much a part of God as God himself is God you have received Zoe life eternal life my goodness we're not talking about another God we're talking about the same God in Bride form it's the same Jesus in Bride form let me just point a couple little quotes here she is y'all y'all know what I'm talking about the seven seal brought him back to the Earth she is the word coming in to the bride see it's the bride coming of Christ now it's powerful if you go listen to the rising of the sun it's a little different than the way it's written cuz whoever was transcribed describing it when they wrote it in the book If you read it it don't sound the same they put a little comma in there it's a good study go go look look and see where they put the comma you see people's Revelation amen the bride coming of Christ and then they put a comma in there and then they act like amen it's just coming out of the church this not talking about just the bride coming out of church it's talking about Christ coming in the bride form amen what are we talking about we're talking about him packing three names when when God comes brother B said he comes under three different now we're not talking about Redemptive names he comes under three manifestation of names he's the son of man he's the son of God and he also is the son of David now it wasn't a different person y'all remember this now cuz it remember it wasn't a different person because when Jesus was there on the earth it was blind bardus it was seeing him coming by and he said thou son of David have mercy on me and Jesus Stood Still and turned around and said what do you have need of and blind bardus got his eyes didn't he amen under the administration of son of David that same man standing there there was a little woman a sarapan which was a gentile and she said unto him thou son of David have mercy and he never even turned to look at her the Bible said she worshiped louder and he spoke not a word unto her but when she changed her approach under the person of Jesus Christ she said Lord have mercy on me there it is the son of man is Lord to the Gentile Church we're talking about restoring lordship we're talking about going back to the Garden of Eden where he is the lord of the church he's not just a king he's our Lord he's our savior he's our God the lordship of this church returns under the adoption anointing in the last days do you see it's the same person but a different Administration uh you you come down to these you come down to these little little small towns where they just got one person one clerk you know and they're working and they're working in the you going in the DMV or the vehicle place and you need a you need a license plate and you say I need a license plate on this old truck this he you can't get it here you got to go to the title department where's the title department it's down there at the end of the desk and you walk down to end of the desk and they roll their chair over to the end of the desk it's the same person come on but it's a different office and we're dealing with the same person in a different office it is the coming of the son of man it's not a mystery it has been revealed in simple Kentucky English to let the church know the coming of the son of man was manifested through a prophet of God to let you and I know that we have come to the time of the rapturing of the church we are a generation of people that shall not hinder them with sleep in the ground but we have come to the age of the glorification of the church by the voice of the son of man we shall raise from the dead it's the coming of Elohim see it's the mystery of his coming he had to come to Abraham as Elohim before Isaac could come brother M said you you you see it in the time he said Isaac they needed a change of that body they need needed a change of the body to meet Isaac Jesus is our Isaac and we need a change of body to meet him but what is it going to change our body I tell you what changed Abraham's body was the coming of Elohim amen and the thing that'll change the body of the church tonight is the coming of this message it is the coming of Elohim on the earth to a bride to manifest his life now I'll read you a couple quotes here for the message of the trial that y'all know so y'all know in 1933 the angel appeared to brother bam and said as John the Baptist was given a message you've been given one right and he said that would be amen the for run the second coming so brother B then goes around the world with this message and by 1964 he's putting it on trial and he's saying there's a lot of prosecutors out here asking me if I was supposed to do that where's he at that's what they were asking go back and listen to the message of the trial brother Brandon was saying they're saying you said you had a message to forun his coming where's he at where's he at and brother Ram begins to answer and he says I call your attention to the scriptural blind prosecutor all right this is going to sound ridiculous but they're scripturally blind he said in St Luke he said the 17th chapter as it was in the days of the son of man now you want to know where this man is he's the same yes yesterday today and forever you want to know where the nail scars and the prints and things are any hypocrite could do that the Life of Christ returns in the form of the Holy Ghost not nail scars wo brother amen to make intercession he said right now that body is setting at the right hand of God to make intercession but the Holy Ghost has come to carry out his works it's the Holy Ghost I want you to know in John 14-5 in the trial in Topeka 1964 brother Adam says see he said now listen every knee shall bow and every eye should see him and every tongue could confess he only promised to turn into Power of the spirit and vindicate the word he never Pro in this age he never promised I'm I read above it he said I'll call your attention to this Jesus being here with nail scars in the hand he never made such a promise woo Glory he never made such a promise now now let me just let me just pull you into this you remember brother brandom when he was talking about Martin and he said Martin saw Jesus appear with a crown and he said there he was with thorns Crown he had a crown he had th scars in his hands he said the Lord Jesus stood there crowned before him he said Martin picked up his ink well and threw it at him he said because he knew the scripture said that the Saints would crown him in the Millennium he knew whoever was standing there was an impostor he looked like Jesus but it wasn't Jesus because he knew the scripture of his age and brother Randon was saying look if there was a man walked in here tonight with nail prce in his hand we couldn't accept him because it wasn't the promise the promise was the baptism of the Holy Ghost living as a son of man among the church and that will carry a bride out of this Dimension and we will meet him in the air with all of his thorns and his crown and we'll see him in his glory and in his power there is a real Corporal body but we are going to meet that body in another dimension amen now might not fit tradition but it fits the scripture Christ according to the trial will return in the form of the word working in human beings showing the signs and wonders he said I love how brother B says things he said Jesus was God In the Flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifesting In the Flesh the son of man revealing himself the church in human flesh making himself known well I think we could I think we could preach right there for an hour I'm not going to do it but I think we could preach a while if that was God manifested In the Flesh then he's telling you the same thing in your flesh is still God manifested In the Flesh let me just say it to you like this the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with a voice how far is he coming down then okay amen so so we can get him down to a prophet almost everybody agrees he came down to prophetic form now amen let me ask you this did he just stay there is that as far as this message came to brother random himself and then there was nothing behind that but I believe that God came to a prophet to be introduced so he could work to the church as the word of God the word couldn't come to denomination it had to come to a prophet but once it came to the prophet it was introduced as a Vindicated word and then the church would be able to move into that and now him in you is the same word that was in the beginning and the glory of God is in the church by the word being in the church amen I want you to think about it tonight shake it off of you I don't care and what you think about yourself God has descended to the form of the Bride of Jesus Christ some of you are poor some of you are illiterate some are high some are big what difference does it make at Calvary we all became the same and God filled the church with the power and with the anointing of God hallelujah I don't know how to explain it any better than this let me just say it like this we y'all know what uranium is you know that stuff they got that skull and ex's on you know kills people they die uranium or or or let's just say a nuclear power let's just say you take a big pile of nucleus waste and you put it in a trash bag and hand it to somebody is it any less powerful because it's in a paper bag come on would you would you take uranium in a paper bag and say oh don't worry it won't hurt you because it's not powerful in that bag could you take it and put it in a plastic bag let me ask you what about a Lowe's bag what about a Walmart bag what amen what about a Gucci bag amen amen what about putting it in Amen in Louis Paton amen would it be would it would it be better then I don't care how much that bag cost you that uranium will still be uranium and listen God has come into this church in the last days and you can put it in a silk suit you can put it in a pair of coveralls you can put Oh Glory to God it ain't education it ain't Society it's the god of Heaven has descended out of heaven and he's in the Church of the Living God and if he's in you he's as much God as when he was in the days of our Lord Jesus he's as much God as he was in the days of Peter it's the mystery of the coming of the Lord hallelujah put it in a woman put it in a man put it in a child put it in an elder he's still God he still got the power tonight to raise the dead to change Hearts listen this ain't just God With Us it's God in us hallelu Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh so how far let me ask you where you where you going to put the barrier so he can come down to where am I wish I was a better exemplify but let me just let me just do this can I borrow his chairman amen we're going to preach on object lessons now all right here it is this is a this is a barrier and God is standing just out there and the church was trying to get to him but the denomination was here another denomination was here schools of Society was here and they all had that barrier what William brandham did is he come and did this and he just moved that thing right out of the way and he said look guys there he is and he broke through the barriers of unbelief and made a way for the church brother bam now here's the problem we got now amen people saw what God done in brother brandom so they take brother brandom now and they put brother random in that place so now you can't get to God because you're trying to act like brother bam you can't have a gift cuz you're trying to be like brother bam you can't have the word listen they won't even let us preach the gospel no more you got we can't even get it in a preacher we got to leave it in the tape or leave it in a book but God never come in this age to stay in a book or to stay in a tape he came to develop a bride in the image of God before the foundation of the world so I say tear down every barrier I say move every the image I say let the spirit of God flow in the church with authority and with power this message didn't come to block it this come it come to make a way Hallelujah he's returned to the earth I challenge you to believe I'll just use brother bram's words all right that Jesus is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh through the bride's body it's the bride coming of Christ brother brandom calls it the secret food not everybody can eat it give some people indigestion but to the church it's bride food amen Do You Hear What Paul was saying he said got some things to teach he said but see you can't hear them now he said having need for the milk he said there's a lot of things I'd like to say but you're dull of hearing that early Church couldn't take the revelation of mecdc it couldn't take the revelation of Elohim amen but he knew that was coming to day when he said it in Hebrews 11 they without us cannot be made perfect he knew there'd come a capping to this pyramid he knew there would come a day when the mystery of the son of man would become so real that our young people could take it our elders could take it everybody could believe it because they were born of God to believe it come on you were made to believe it Hallelujah now I'll take brother bram's own words his ministry was to declare him and he said and he's here now another way in Christ the mystery he said it the headship is here amen Christ the Risen Lord the headship is here now what has he come for to reveal his will yeah that's the mystery is the will of God that's what the church needed was to know the will of God you know uh I I was I had the privilege of being over in Israel and uh we were over and we watched the temple Institute they were building the Temple over there and uh I think it's Rabbi Rickman and them they got what they call a Sanhedrin Council basically and they're restoring everything and they can't build the Temple of course because you can't get on Temple Mount to rebuild nothing cuz it's uh it's just it's a Muslim stronghold so because the Muslims have a stronghold but you can go up there if you got the right guides and I we actually got the blessing of going up on Temple Mount but you can't pray up there you can't can't say the name of the Lord you can't bow your head pray nothing like that you can just be up there and the Muslims I think they're scared of prayer you know but amen but what we got up there is it was powerful some of you may have heard this before but I thought it was pretty powerful cuz we start we start walking and this guy brother brother Rickman he looks over at us and he goes they won't let us pray up here he said but you guys know the Book of Joshua don't you and we're all preachers you know we yeah we know the Book of Joshua he said then come and walk around it with me so there he was up there putting footsteps amen around that around that Temple amen now he took us down off of the Temple Mount took us in this room where they're building these artifacts and they got they got the manur the seven candlesticks they've got it built solid gold it's worth millions it's beautiful they've got pots they've got the ash plate and they've got the bronze Altar and they've got a lot of the articles that was needed in the in the uh in the temple that's already built cuz they said when the temple comes we we want these things finished cuz we can't work on the Temple we'll work on these then when the Temple's finished we'll just move them all in I said well that's pretty good thinking he said but right now he said now they may have figured it out since i' since that's been 10 years ago but he said the thing we're working on right now is the curtain that goes into the holies of holies and I said we're working on it I said well how long's that take to make he said well he said we're trying to figure out what shade of blue I said shade of blue he said yeah he said you know how many shades of blue there is see that they they had to have a is it a it's a blue curtain right they had to have a blue curtain I think it's golden labeled or something like that but it was a blue curtain they had to go in well the the shade of blue some of these guys had spent 20 years studying the scripture to figure out which shade of blue Moses was talking about now can you imagine dedicating your whole life to figure figing out what shade of blue the curtain was and it's important in their religion because that's life and death right now think about this because how many shades of blue are there and how many opinions are there of what shade blue that is now here's here's the thing you think about this so there's maybe there's some important guys and 40 or 50 of them decide it's this shade of blue and there's less important guys and they decide it's this shade of blue and then there's some uh maybe a group of sisters and they say it's this shade of blue so so what shade is it who's we who are we going to follow the most popular the most uh outdated are we going to who how what are we going to do how are we going to follow see but but what they need is they need Moses cuz if Moses would walk in the room he'd just say thus sayith the lord it's this shade the argument would be over do you see at the last 2,000 years we've had them arguing over water baptism we've been arguing over predestination we've been arguing over the order of the church we've been order all the baptism and we've been ordering over the new birth and we've been arguing over all these things but what we really needed was a prophet and thanks God we've got a prophet that revealed the will of God concerning the church in the last day he brought us out of confusion I don't know about you amen God brought us out I ain't going back I'm not going back in the man manmade ideas and he thinks this and he thinks that and they think that I believe there'll be a bride that'll stay right with this word it's the will of God for the bride to stay with the message of the hour hallelujah hallelujah when the word is opened up according to Daniel chapter 12 the wise is going to understand in Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 14 he says awaketh Thou that sleepest and arise from the dead Christ shall give thee light see then thou works circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days of evil be ye therefore not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is what makes one wise is to understand the will of God there would be no reason in this generation for us to not know the will of God we should know the will of God on his word in this season we have had a prophet among us there should be no question on it Amen brother Ram said see here's the thing the voice of his sign 1964 he tonight unless we know the word of God we don't know what to do we can have faith until we know what is the will of God then if we know it is the will of God the word of God says something then we can gladly follow it if a prophet gave you the word he gave you the will now how many knows the first two pools of brother Bam's Ministry was not the perfect will of God he said so he said actually what it done is it produced a lot of impersonations right amen but there was a true Vindication of the Messiah sign that was sent into the age but after brother bam left almost every charismatic preacher started with gifts of discernment because they wanted the people to look at them the way they looked at brother brandom and that's why you and I I'm not going to go to call the names tonight but there's some chis guys used to carry tents around and they go around and brother Roy ruseberry was in their meetings actually and he and I'm not going into all that but I'll say it like this hey man brother Roy said I've seen the real and I've seen the false and he said I stood right there and saw that man under an anointing but when he started prophesying it was completely wrong he said but I sat in brother brandom's meetings and I heard him prophesy and it was 100% correct but you see what happens is the impersonation is devaluing the reality of what it was and brother man said see they'll be able to impersonate these first two he said but now that third pull they won't be able to impersonate cuz they don't know what it is he said the devil y'all don't tighten up on me now I'm not calling you impersonators amen the devil see the devil amen he he can impersonate God but he can't be God is that right he can't be God that's why I always think never I got to be careful but I never thought much about one pre preacher impersonating another cuz they you know there's never two preachers identically the same so when you see two preachers the same one of them's a fake every time reminds me of a story brother told me one time he said he was down in a meeting down in down in Florida he said there's an old boy up there preaching he said there was a drunk sitting on the front row he's preaching away said this old boy is preaching away and and and he's preaching away and all of a sudden the old drunk hollered out Billy Graham that old boy he changed Tunes in a little bit old boy holled out or Roberts and little Betty changed Tunes holled out another famous preacher oh boy said hey would you shut up I'm trying to preach he said the real you amen see amen he was he was he was always somebody else you know amen but in the message of the hour amen we're not impersonating nothing amen the reality is amen you are the highest form of life that has ever been sent to the Earth we are not acting like other ages other Ages were acting like you we are not their type they were our type come on church amen we shout and dance but we're not acting like the Pentecostals we had the shout and dance in the beginning where where you before the foundation of the world come on it's been moving from the positive to the negative to the positive the whole time amen listen this has never been the perfect word prde until the hour you're living this is the mind of God concerning his bride hallah now that third pole is the perfect will of God now here's the here's the beauty of it is the word comes to a prophet right so when the word comes to a prophet that's the perfect will of God concerning the age now I just love how brother brandham says according to Revelations 10 the mystery will be finished see the real thing the real thing will be revealed now I I'm not going to have time to dig deep in this but I want to just I want to just put it out here in the beginning when Eve fell in the Garden of Eden what did she fall from she fell from the word right it was a word issue she fell from the word and everything else is an attribute of coming out of the word now watch so when God prophesied unto her that I'll give you a woman's seed brother bradam tells us what he's actually predicting is that the word would once again come to you see she lost her she lost her chance at it but God is prophesying the word is going to come back but between the time she lost the word and the time the word comes back people have to live they've got to make it so what does God do he begins the whole thing by going in and finding Adam and Eve in a in a garment remember they had dressed theirselves in fig leaves and brother B said and God wanted to have a Garden of Eden conference and they wasn't dressed for it he said so he stripped their fig Leaf off and killed a lamb and threw a bloody skin and said wear that to the conference so he gave them something to wear to come into the presence of God which would be a temporary garment until that immortal Ro would be restored back to the church again so everything from the time of Adam now look what they done they went right up to the gate and build an altar and shed the blood that was as close as they get to the presence of God the substitute couldn't go in the garden it was at the Gate of the garden right that runs deep now folks amen they couldn't get in they were at the gate but they couldn't get in and then it was there at that where the presence of God was and Cain fled but from the time of of Eve all the way to the time of Jesus everything they had was a substitute the Lambs of of the token and Moses's laws the Tabernacles it was all substitutes but what happened was is the people got so enriched in the substitutes that when the perfect word came to them they were not ready to release the substitute and take a hold of the word now brother brandom says here's the thing he said watch this he said they all missed it now now you think about this John prophesied from the book of Isaiah the Lord Jesus prophesied from the Garden of Eden and the the Pharisees missed it brother bam said the disciples missed it I can read you the Scripture it said the disciples asked him saying why is that El lias said must first come and he said see they missed John the Baptist they missed the prophet and they missed the Messiah all right they missed both the prophet and God Amen and they missed it brother B said the disciples missed it the people missed it the Pharisees missed it he said everybody missed it come on now now here's the here's the real catch it wasn't even prophesied to be a secret it wasn't even supposed to be a secret and they missed it anyhow because they were blinded by the substitutes amen but watch now when they turned it down brother BR said oh he said see that's the thing he said somebody said well if everybody's going to miss it he said well then he said there ain't no me need of me trying he said but see he said you got to have that kind of Faith he said the kind of Faith you got to have is if everybody else misses it I'm going to be there brother man said see there's no need to be trying but that shows you ain't got the right kind of faith yet he said because somebody's going to get it now watch somebody got it but it had to be showed to them watch this when when Jesus went to Apostle Peter he didn't have it he wasn't catching it but Jesus went to him to be sure he didn't miss it oh brother Amen brother B said when he went down there and he began to show that mexic sign over Apostle Peter he said he said oh there he was it ruffled his feathers he said he was all starchy and a religious man he said but when that struck over his life he said he said I love how how brother Ram says things he says it was that little eternal life seed down on the inside of Peter he said and when it be to strike over him he said see why it happened so quick because Peter immediately was ready to follow Jesus he said how did that happen so quick he said see back there in the beginning now this is third and fourth seal brother said it like this he said back there in the beginning when the heavens and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the Earth he said there were seeds laying underneath that Earth he said and darkness covered the seeds in the water but when God said let there be light he said the clouds parted back and the sun struck the seeds and they were already there so they come to life he said and that's what happened to Apostle Peter when the light struck the seed it was an immediate response because the seed was already there oh Church of the Living God can you imagine that little woman at the well as she stands with eternal life seed in her amen but there was a cloud that was covering her of an immoral life but when the Vindicated word of God came under her what it done it broke down the barriers of unbelief and the seed lived again can I say it to you it didn't take an all night prayer meeting folks it didn't take two nights and five days to figure out what it was she began to scream amen I know thou the prophet thou the Messiah and you know what she did she didn't then then she just decided Well you know what I've seen it I'll just sit down and quit no the Bible said she put down her water pot and ran into the City and said come see a man and many believe because of her testimony amen she was just a woman but she was so influenced by the Vindicated word that she was leading people to the word of God and they say tonight the word has returned and influenced the church there was a seed in you that's the reason believe it that was a seed in you and God wouldn't let you miss [Applause] it it's the will of God it's the will of God seeall now brother Ram said what did they do they missed him the Living Word now he said that second Eve done what the first Eve did remember he said they did it at NAA though right he said the first Eve did it in the garden and the second did it in nah she committed the same thing she let the word slip away from her and brother Bram said but watch when the word went away from her there was already a promise laying in the scripture and Malachi 4 said I shall restore by the spirit of Elijah in Joel chapter 2 said I shall restore sayith the Lord before she ever fail God had already made a promise of restoration isn't that powerful but until the time of restoration now here's the beauty because the Bible said in Acts chapter 3 that the heavens must receive Jesus Christ until the restitution of all things and they haven't even fail in NAA yet but there's prophecy of a restitution of all things according to Daniel 12:4 in the last days the book would be open according to Revelations 10: 7 the seventh angel will reveal the mysteries of the book and if those Mysteries are the word he would have to be a prophet and according to Malachi 4 Elijah should come before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord so it couldn't be restored until the last age amen and they fell back there in the third age but between the third and the seventh age God gave them the substitutes and he by Grace under the blood let them come to him smoking ptes having trinitarian baptisms now you explain it to me people said well the Bible's my absolute then Martin Luther didn't make it come on church so what is the absolute brother Wayne the revealed the will of God when God gives Revelation you got to go back in the Bible now you Enoch didn't have a Bible Abel didn't have a Bible job didn't have a Bible Noah didn't have a Bible there wasn't a written manuscript until Moses but they all had absolutes because God revealed to them and in the last days he said the Revelation would come to us through a prophet so when God revealed Reformation through Martin Luther they had a substitute until the time that another Revelation broke and when the Revelation broke on sanctification justification couldn't couldn't work no more but it was only a substitute sanctification and when the baptism of the Holy Ghost fell there in 1906 it wasn't the true baptism it was a Reformation of gifts that was a furtherance of the Son of God age under the dispensation of the Son of God it wasn't the true baptism of the Holy Ghost it was a substitute you see that it was a substitute because the word hadn't been restored what's the beauty of this the whole thing was waiting on the word and when the word comes the substitutes won't work no more now that matters to you more than you know let me just let me give you a phrase now let's get them to the Lord and then get them to the message now let's rephrase that let's get them to the substitute and then see if we can get them to the real that's like standing in the days of John the Baptist and saying let's take them to Mosaic law all right to see if we can introduce them to the present word come on come on so preacher what are you saying what I'm trying to be clear as I know how the message of the hour is not something different than the original word everything through the church Ages was a substitute until the original came this is the original thought God had concerning the Bride of Jesus Christ what is it it is the original thought come on everything else was a substitute until the word broke open and now by the third pool you're seeing what God really had in his mind to begin with this is the real thought God had this is not a substitute this is the resurrection of the reality of almighty God you are looking at the real real reality of what God thought in the beginning we have returned to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost listen Church it is the adoption of the church it is the Manifest St ation of the son of man it is a bride age a harvest age a son of man age an adoption age it's any kind of age am it's the fullness of the ages in one [Applause] moment what are we talking about we're talking about the will of God a prophet came to reveal the will of God concerning your life the original will think of it they missed it now let me let me let me just give you what a prophet said in the third seal it's always powerful he said that see the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no Revival no manifestation of God back there to wake that bride up we're looking for it it'll take the seven on none Thunders now it says it take Revelations 10 let's just say it like that so you can get it what it'll take to have Revival now is Revelations 10 because the substitutes have come all the way up all right to the word you see that the substitutes brought us all the way to the Reformation of gifts but not the word so the only way to break into a Revival past the Reformation of gifts was the word would come and when the restoration of the word would be a restoration of power when you restore the word you restore the church back to its original condition I tell you what don't you look back and say I wish we was like they used to be listen this bride has went all the way back to the back to the book of Acts back to the day of Pentecost amen but also back to the Garden of Eden when Eve stepped out of the will of God now there she is walking back in the will of God by the power of God what is it amen there's been no manifestation of the Bride now now you guys you guys got to got to bear with me saying this cuz there's a lot of revivals but brother Bram said no bride Revival third seal 19 19 63 we've already had Durban South Africa we've already had the India meetings we've already had World revivals in St Louis and and Jonesboro up in Canada around the world hundreds of thousands of Miracles have been done signs and wonders and manifestations of every kind you could think of he said but there's been nothing to wake up that bride wo brother what's it going to take to work that bride the original word and when the word is restored the bride is restored because she's a word bride of a word groom amen there will be no difference between the bride and her husband if he's the word she's the word if she's the word he's the word and how you going to have itless you got a profit Oh Glory to God we have received the word in our age hey we've returned back to manifestation of a real original bride church it's the bride on am what to restore the word I ain't even going to answer to all the intellectuals it's the word is the word intellectually listen the word without the spirit is dead on let's just dismiss all that in the beginning was the word the word was before there was written text it's Angelic right Loos of God now it's the original thought and pattern of God not a bunch of dry intellect getting together and teaching let me see what brother Bram said he said we passed out tracks but we've never had the gospel right cuz it comes with power and then he actually can you believe it Elijah making fun of preachers he he actually makes fun of them he said the preacher ain't got enough power to break an egg he said all they got is the power of argument it's intellectual power but the bride has received Rapture power they' received an anointing of the word that come from the beginning has been restored to the church the original thought process of God the bride hasn't had a Revival yet but it would take something to wake her up and brother Ram says see but if they would plead the promise it would become effective to them now you can't have Brides Revival till you know the promise of the age now now if if if all you're thinking about is the coming of the Lord as being his Corporal body and US leaving here then you're never going to see a bride's Revival because the bride's Revival is what takes place between a prophet bringing a message and the church leaving the Earth that section in there will be the ministry of the son of man Reviving the word that was written of you to begin with there Isaiah 7 Malachi Isaiah 7 was in the scripture but it was a dead letter wasn't it but it was Isaiah's words but one day we seen Jesus walking on the shores of Galilee it was the Revival of of Isaiah 7 standing there in shoe leather and people were looking for the Messiah and John was saying I'm not looking for the Messiah right there he stands come on church amen Jesus looked at philli and they said show us the father he said have I been so long with you and yet you have not known me when you see me you have seen the father amen people say well I'm looking for the bride I'm looking for the bride's revival can I say we've been so long with you and you don't know who the bride is come on Church this is God's Revival it's been written in the Bible for 2,000 years but tonight it lives it lives it walks it breathes it manifests itself this is the Revival of the word of God throughout the ages you are not a substitute you are not a partial word you are the full manifestation of the mind of God from the foundations of the world hallelujah it's the will of God hallelujah it's his will it's his will manifesting if you know the promise you can have Revival the promise is son of man that promise makes it live brother Bram said now here's the thing they're fasting and praying looking for the bride's Revival he said but see they've missed the Awakening of the Bride Revival see and Awakening of the bride are the same things we're looking for an Awakening what are we talking about the scriptures to awaken for for to live now see they didn't recognize it because they didn't know the scripture look at Jesus in that day he's fully manifesting the word and they're looking right at him right but instead of having reval they're crucifying him all they could have had the joy of the Lord the voice of the bridegroom was among them and they crucified him and they could have rejoiced in him come on church because they didn't know who he was that's why they cried out who is this yeah come on that's why they tried to that's why they tried to quiet down the church listen you ever get a you ever get a church seeing the promise of this age and you ain't got to pep her up come on all this all these people say well y'all's always pumping up the people no no and y'all got this all wrong amen if if you ever really see that the people are taught the promise amen then you you don't have to pump up a people amen what you got to do is just give them a place on come on Amen and and and you know what'll end up happening you'll end up hearing people tell you the way they told Jesus won't you calm these people down well I didn't pump them up so I don't feel like I already to have to calm them down hallu plead the promise can I read something to you here brother BR said God promised in this last day he would manifest and would vindicate his word to her and still she wouldn't do it God promised it to her by the servants the prophets God promised through Jesus Christ now if you'd like to take notes this is a good one God promised through Jesus Christ God promised through Joel God promised through Paul God promised through Malachi and God promised through John the Revelator he's telling you if you plead the promise you will see an effective Revival and he said now these promise came through these men Jesus Joel Paul Malachi John he said and Paul and he says it like this now if you want to write them down John Jes Jesus did it a promise in John 14:12 Joel promised it in Joel 238 Paul promised it in 2 Timothy 3 Malachi promised it in Malachi 4 John promised it in John in Revelation chapter 10 and Luke of course was in 17 amen now to this church what is it it's the Incarnate Word made flesh Among Us Again amen so watch what brother random says he said justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word see it was the Incarnate Word he'll say it again justification made a way for sanctification it made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down into Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself now somebody said well you are you saying 1906 was the true Bap no it was the Shu and the bride was the seed it wasn't the real thing it was the substitute waiting for the restoration of the word look at what it is amen Amen brother B says see but we would have missed it but God called our names see we would have never seen this but when God called our names what did he do he revealed that will and brought the anointed word to us now here's the thing when you see that the Revival of this last day amen comes from the word amen look at Luke 24 when they're walking on the road to EMAs and they're with the resurrected word now they don't know who they're with they don't know who they're talking to and they're talking about the wrong things and it's apparent they said Jesus said what's this conversation you're having and why are you so sad and they said well haven't you heard of these things and he what things you talking about see not nothing in in in his message concerning the things they were describing see but then he turned them and took the prophets and the promises of this hour all right and brother man said he began with Moses and preached it through the scripture but then he took them in the little room and showed the Messiah sign and ignited their faith and that what what what happened when the promise was pled they took a Revival two of them ran all the way back to the city amen he is not dead he is alive because the promise become effective to them look when I when I say this amen that's the thing that will cause Revival in our churches in the end time it's the promise of this message it's when you see that what God Said in the word actually is happening my it'll cause a it'll cause a strength to come into the church look what he says in John 3 and verse 29 he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase but I must decrease now look at what John's talking about he saying Jesus here is the bridegroom and he says these people are the bride he said but I'm just a friend of the bridegroom now watch here you got brother Ram standing in the same place John was standing in and he says and he re rejoiced at the voice of the bridegroom now that rejoicing was coming because the word was Vindicated among them when you see here the Josh John according to John chapter 3 it was the bridegroom's voice therefore their Joy was fulfilled when you're when when you're when you when you see the message that there's a voice in that Pillar of Fire see he didn't come just to come he came to reveal the will of God you you you see the adoption is to follow the leadership of God the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and the whole creation groaneth and waiteth until people are LED tell the manifestation of the sons how are you going to have manifested Sons until the will of God is released from his mind so no Baptist could adopt this church no lutherans could adopt the church it would take a prophet coming for our adoption that would bring a restoration of the word to bring the church into manifestation which would be the voice of God now here's the thing when the truth of the word is revealed it causes stimulating power amen brother Ram says it I I love how he says it in the third seal this whole thought line substitute to the promise it's in the third seal and in the middle of the third seal he comes down he said but I'm going to get to the good part now and he goes over to Revelation 6 and he reads it and he says it he says see there was a voice came out of the throne that said hurt not the oil and the wine and brother man said that wasn't one of the creatures that said that he said that was a lamb that said that don't hurt the oil and the wine now what's the oil brother Ram said it's a type of the spirit in the church he said what is the wine he said it is the stimulation of the revelation of the word so oil and wine go together in worship listen now now here's a word from the third seal don't hurt the oil and the wine because it was all they had left listen I I want to say tonight I I I I know I know that fanaticism comes and I I know we're living in fanatical ages amen but listen I I hear guys get up and preach against the movement of the Holy Ghost and it just Grieves me it just geves me to no in because I mean half the time oh God can can can I preach but Sean half the time the guys that are trying to straighten up the gifts in the church don't even have gifts in their church but they're watching somebody else's program and they're correcting some other Church in their church and they're killing the move of God because they're trying to correct other people other places come on Church they see somebody out there shouting so they come here amen or wherever their church is and they preach against shouting they preach against the move they preach against this and the next thing you know you can't even get enough moisture in the church to spit you go to have a meeting and everybody sits down they're scared to death something's going to be fanatical or something listen this bride will not be deceived this bride will not be deceived and we don't have to sit around like a bunch of fearful people fearing the move of God and fearing the Holy Ghost and fearing the gift of God listen there's a God that has come to set this church in order in the last day and if it gets too far out the holy spirit will do it himself come on we might as well go ahead and preach haven't we if we can get the pastors to keep from correcting all the other pastors and everybody criticizing everybody else and he watches him and he watches him and then they correct one another back and forth well I think it's time to preach to our people again amen amen if you got to shut off for streaming shut off for streaming but let's let's get back to having church amen hurt not the oil and the wine let the Holy Ghost return in power and in manifestation you know what we need we need an oldfashioned refilling of the Holy Ghost to come down through our churches it'll cause marriages to come back together it'll cause young people to be filled with God it'll cause homes to have the joy of the Lord you'll fill our churches with joy and peace and the power of God we [Applause] [Music] don't hey man y'all Y y'all know what I'm talking about the last thing we need now now some of y'all might have drove a couple hours to get here tonight on you did you really drive up here to hear me correct another preacher come on come on is that why you come over amen people don't come to church to hear you correct some other guy come on church we don't join together to criticize our brothers in the message of the hour on [Music] amen I mean I think it's time to get back to preaching the message of the hour and put our blinders on and don't worry what they're doing here and what they're doing there God is doing something in the midst of the church and I say shout aloud oh Daughters of Zion there's a Revival in the house of God forget what everybody else is doing forget what the Baptist and the Lutheran amen forget what they're doing God's got a message for this hour hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah don't you hurt the oil and the wine quench not the spirit of God what we need is a moving of the Holy Ghost what we really need we need it back in the church these dry intellectuals that's that's coming against the move of the spirit they just need a move of the spirit in the heart they just need a Revival come on church that's all we need a Revival in the church but the Revival is come by the message of the hour it's already here Hallelujah Rivals [Applause] here said preacher what are you saying I'm saying there's a stimulation of the revelation of this age coming out of these scriptures if we would plead the promise of this hour listen you won't have to pump nothing you won't have to pull at nothing you won't have to ask for amens and somebody say hallelujah you just preach this message come on now we do not have to suck on a Pentecostal baby amen we don't have to get some little bottle up here and suck like a Pentecostal to get enough anointing to find fire in the house of God Amen we do y'all y'all might as well go ahead and amen that because we're not looking to borrow from the Pentecostal and the charismatics to find our anointing our anointing is a word anointing it comes from the message of the hour and I believe as we preach this message the power of God returns in the church with anointing and truth hallelujah if it did it then it'll do it now if it did it then it'll do it now what's wrong with these people it's the promise where were you when the sons of God was shouting for Joy this ain't an oldfashioned religion or new religion it's an oldfashioned religion B what is it it's the truth of the promised word preached hey man we we could go ahead and preach here minute I picked the spirit up real quick I tell you what you do you quit receiving those texts from that preacher condemning them other preachers and your life will simple out your church will measure out things will smooth out Whispers and backbiters have caused more trouble among the ministry today than anything else that happened they run from church to church and they just mouth and Whisper and mouth and Whisper and they say little things and those inside jokes and all that come back to the gospel come back to the power of God come back to the message of the hour amen if you got to throw your phone away throw the thing away get back to the word of God it's time for Rapture it's time for the church to find the refilling of the Holy Ghost let the power of God Reign let the message rain turn the tapes back on turn the books back open break your Bible open amen get back in the house of God shouting and rejoice oh hallelujah it's a stimulation of the Revelation brother Bram said it'll have the same effect on you that natural wine has on a man you get to drink in this Revelation you know what'll happen Heen what you call it that I don't care brother Andrew just come by our Tre Church preached a powerful message I don't know if we leas the morning we evenings online if you want to watch it true word Tabernacle B but that morning he got into that I don't care and I like that well I like that I said he's talking about me right there I just don't care I'm very dangerous cuz I really don't care I don't care a thing about reputation I would not walk across the street to pick up a reputation cuz it don't mean nothing in the presence of God if you got one you got to keep one and you can't you got to be stately and you got to stand a certain way and you got to talk a certain way and you got to act a certain way I think it's time to act like the Holy Ghost wants us to I think I come on church amen remember when how when it was so easy just to shout down the aisle cuz you wasn't nobody and nobody was watching and nobody cared and all you did was just love the Lord and you just wanted to worship and serve God I said we ought to praise God again shake down the place and let her hair pins fall in the Floor dance up the eyes until the Holy Ghost moves in a scream and a shout list said I don't care what the world thinks about me and someday when I get up in heaven you're going to watch watch me sing and shout and dance it ain't going it ain't going to be no different up there it is right hereall the power of stimulation gives you the I don't cares come on you get a man drinking some wine come on get a man drinking some wine brother man said this message will have the same power over you the same stimulating power Hallelujah you know what happens to you I I was in the world for as in message
