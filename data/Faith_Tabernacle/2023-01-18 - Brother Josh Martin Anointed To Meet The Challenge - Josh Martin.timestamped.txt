[35:09] appreciate the love that you have all
[35:12] have for the message of the hour and
[35:15] um I believe God is doing something
[35:17] great in here in Faith Tabernacle and um
[35:22] um you know we we always you know you
[35:26] you always go through your bumps and
[35:28] your things that Satan's all fighting us
[35:31] over uh don't matter how great how small
[35:34] but you know what when we come together
[35:36] like this and just lifting up holy hands
[35:39] and singing songs unto him and amening
[35:43] the word and I tell you what it just
[35:45] shows that Satan don't know what to do
[35:47] with you amen he's trying every which
[35:50] way he can to destroy the body of Christ
[35:52] to destroy the Believers and uh you know
[35:56] I think I think he will be glad when
[36:00] we're gone
[36:01] amen I just think he's going to be glad
[36:04] when we're gone then he gets to have his
[36:07] way with this Earth yes to have his do
[36:10] what all the evils that he wants to do
[36:12] but as long as your little light is
[36:15] flickering he can't touch you he's
[36:18] limited he's it's it's off limits you
[36:22] know what I mean and and you know you're
[36:26] the people that God says you're the
[36:28] apple of my eye now you just think of
[36:31] that you're the apple of his eye so when
[36:34] he touches you when the devil touches
[36:36] you and he tries to God takes that as a
[36:40] personal
[36:40] insult you know and so I uh I do believe
[36:45] that uh they're they're all hell is
[36:49] going to break loose when we're gone but
[36:52] that's okay uh let it let it be uh we'll
[36:56] be with our bridegroom amen and so

[37:19] steal I just got to give him a bunch of
[37:22] candy or something and but uh so glad to
[37:27] have them and we want brother Josh just
[37:29] to preach what the lord has laid upon
[37:32] his heart and uh we're needing we're
[37:35] needing Ministry out on the field you
[37:38] know and and we're we're needing men of
[37:41] God that preach this message believe
[37:45] this message and not adding stuff to it
[37:47] but just preaching it and you know we
[37:51] got to thinking about that I don't know
[37:52] if y'all's heard but it's it's it's
[37:54] there but they voted brother Wayne
[37:56] Lawson and his Pastor in Ohio and so he
[38:00] is now the the official pastor and he
[38:05] called me you know before the meeting he
[38:07] said now I got to go back and you know
[38:08] he's I can't tell you why you know and
[38:11] and until it's over and and uh so he
[38:15] told me not you know after the meeting
[38:18] he said they're going to be voting me in
[38:19] and I just sit and cried you know I
[38:22] thought I'm losing a I'm losing a real
[38:24] buddy right there and and I thought well
[38:26] why does all these churches going to do
[38:28] if he's going to just be stuck at one
[38:29] Church you know and uh it's kind of
[38:32] being a little selfish but uh uh uh
[38:35] we're really just appreciate brother
[38:37] Wayne's Ministry he's been a help to the
[38:39] bride all around the world and uh but
[38:43] you know what uh I believe God's raising
[38:46] up these young men to carry the gospel
[38:48] and I thought you know what I'm kind of
[38:52] like what brother Brown said we need a
[38:53] rally around these young men and we got
[38:56] brother Andrew a young man a point there
[38:59] goes that's where he usually sets but
[39:01] he's he's about the only young man I I
[39:05] if I can say it that way just with the
[39:07] real power packed uh Ministry that is
[39:10] out there full time and we need to Rally
[39:14] around that gift and pretend affected
[39:16] and and
[39:18] just and and you say well how are we
[39:21] going to lift up a man no that's not it
[39:23] we need to pray for him and God just
[39:25] protects them keeps them and keeps them
[39:28] straight can you say amen and uh so we
[39:32] want to just all of us do our part for
[39:34] the gospel of Christ amen so I'm glad
[39:37] that God's raising up brother Josh to

[47:12] something can be said this evening that
[47:14] can be a blessing before we read the
[47:16] scriptures can we bow our heads dear
[47:18] gracious heavenly father and Lord you've
[47:20] been so good to us God Lord he gave us a
[47:23] desire Lord to come into your house and
[47:25] into your presence Lord and God as we're
[47:28] in worship you this evening father and
[47:30] we've created an atmosphere I ask the
[47:32] Lord that you would come and meet the
[47:34] needs Lord I ask that you and Lord speak
[47:36] to these lips of clay As I Lay myself
[47:38] aside Lord you know the needs that are
[47:41] in the building father I ask that you
[47:43] would meet him Lord May there be be a
[47:45] willing heart to receive what you have
[47:47] for him tonight we ask these things in
[47:49] your precious name amen Ephesians 6 and
[47:53] 10. finally my brethren be strong in the
[47:56] Lord and in the power of His might put
[47:58] on the whole armor of God that ye may be
[48:01] able to stand against The Wiles of the
[48:03] devil for be wrestle not against flesh
[48:06] and blood but against principalities
[48:08] against powers against rulers of the
[48:11] darkness of this world against spiritual
[48:13] wickedness in high places wherefore take
[48:16] unto you the whole armor of God that ye
[48:18] may be able to withstand on the evil day
[48:21] having done all to stand amen you may be
[48:24] seated
[48:26] amen if I had a simple subject tonight
[48:28] it would be anointed to meet the
[48:30] challenge and this just stood out to me
[48:32] how how the Ephesians here this the
[48:35] scripture was talking how there's a lot
[48:37] that's coming against us we wrestle not
[48:40] against flesh and blood but against
[48:41] principalities against Powers against
[48:43] rulers of Darkness against spiritual
[48:46] wickedness so there's a lot that's
[48:48] coming against the bride against the
[48:50] church and I believe we're living in a
[48:52] day where it's an all-out attack on the
[48:55] word on God on the bride the devil is
[48:57] challenging everything that is right
[49:00] everything that the word stands for the
[49:02] devil's coming against him you can take
[49:04] something simple like traditional
[49:06] marriage and the devil is even taking
[49:08] that the guy the Lord God set that in
[49:11] order in the very first book you know as
[49:12] man and woman though it's going to come
[49:14] together and so the devil is taking
[49:16] something simple like that and twisting
[49:19] it up Josiah was telling us earlier that
[49:21] there was a preacher that was saying
[49:23] that that God was a queer you know
[49:25] something simple all that we will look
[49:27] and say wow that's just insane but the
[49:29] devil is taking the truth or taking the
[49:32] simple values of Believers and twisting
[49:34] it up and there's the worlds falling for
[49:37] it they're falling right into the web
[49:39] and it's getting more wicked and more
[49:40] wicked but I believe right in the midst
[49:43] of the chaos right in the midst of the
[49:45] uh the confusion there's somebody that's
[49:48] not in confusion but is standing upon
[49:51] Waters right and we see throughout the
[49:53] Bible throughout the church ages that
[49:55] the devil's number one's Focus has
[49:58] always been the word it's always been
[49:59] the word brother Branham says in the
[50:02] beginning when he came against uh in the
[50:04] garden he says he didn't attack Eve he
[50:06] attacked the word then whenever he
[50:08] attacked the word and her belief or her
[50:10] her faith in the word started to get
[50:13] beat down and so now we understand why
[50:16] the devil's constantly fighting against
[50:18] the message constantly fighting against
[50:20] their faith because once he gets your
[50:22] faith down right there you're defeated
[50:25] without faith we can't believe in the
[50:27] promises without faith we can't believe
[50:29] that God can still heal but with faith
[50:32] we can stand upon what is right brother
[50:34] Brandon would say we know we've got we
[50:37] there's counterfeits everywhere that's
[50:38] right it's a battle you've got to know
[50:41] your enemy and you've got to know your
[50:43] armor your armor is the word and your
[50:45] enemy is something that a reason against
[50:48] it oh my anything that's reasoning
[50:50] against the word is the enemy and I
[50:52] believe we can say Amen to that anything
[50:54] that's coming against us the message is
[50:57] the enemy but anything that stands for
[50:59] this message is worth standing for it's
[51:02] worth standing behind a pastor it's
[51:04] worth standing behind behind a Ministry
[51:06] behind a church that is standing for the
[51:09] truth amen you see brother Branham says
[51:12] the devil is trying to unite man under
[51:14] head knowledge and he promises this is
[51:17] worth the authority is but brother
[51:19] Branham says that's a big lie The
[51:21] Authority only comes by the word and I
[51:24] believe that we're standing upon on the
[51:26] word but the Brandon would say that the
[51:28] devil is building a hybrid church with
[51:30] hybrid members hybrid by knowledge
[51:32] instead of the word oh my hybrid it's a
[51:35] knockoff there's no genuine to it but I
[51:37] believe there's a genuine bride that's
[51:39] standing under the genuine word brother
[51:41] Branham says that the Lucifer is trying
[51:44] to break the unity between God and man
[51:47] which is the headship is trying to break
[51:49] the headship between God and man how is
[51:52] he doing it by reasoning the word of God
[51:55] oh my but the challenge has been made
[51:57] but I believe somebody is going to meet
[52:00] the challenge brother Branham would save
[52:02] the enemy speaks today the enemy tries
[52:05] to say that the days of Miracles has
[52:07] passed there's no such thing as the
[52:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost this is only
[52:11] emotion it's only a workup so the enemy
[52:14] is challenged and his challenge must he
[52:17] didn't say maybe so not hope so but the
[52:20] challenge must be met he says the only
[52:22] way we can meet the challenge when the
[52:24] denominations are calling people away
[52:26] and putting them in organizations and
[52:29] let them women cut their hair and wear
[52:30] makeup men live all kinds of lives lives
[52:33] our trustees and deacons and pastors and
[52:35] churches because they got some PhD or
[52:38] lld and that's the requirement Jesus
[52:40] never did require a man to have that
[52:43] Jesus requirement was wait in the city
[52:45] of Jerusalem until you're endued with
[52:48] power from one High Venue or a witness
[52:50] to me that meets his challenge oh I like
[52:54] how he says that you're a witness to me
[52:56] not to some organization not to some
[52:59] denomination but you're a witness to me
[53:02] Christ the world is always going to have
[53:04] a witness for the Branham says God
[53:06] always has a witness on Earth it was
[53:09] David it was shamgar it was Samson but
[53:11] in this day it's not just one body or
[53:13] one person but it's a multi-member body
[53:16] that is standing against the tide
[53:18] standing against the challenge when the
[53:20] devil says God can't heal somebody
[53:22] stands up and says God Can Heal Me When
[53:25] God Devil's hands God don't fill with
[53:27] the Holy Ghost there's a young person
[53:29] that says I've been filled with the Holy
[53:32] Ghost I'm equipped to meet the challenge
[53:34] of the day oh my reminds me of the story
[53:37] brother Branham was talking to a man I
[53:39] believe it was a preacher and the
[53:41] preacher asked him and he says if you
[53:43] bet how have you been filled with the
[53:44] Holy Ghost but the Branham says yes sir
[53:46] I was filled with the Holy Ghost he says
[53:49] my that's wonderful he says yep I was
[53:51] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[53:54] I got the Holy Ghost and the man stopped
[53:56] and he says wait you don't get the Holy
[53:58] Ghost that way but the Branham looks at
[54:00] him and says it's too late I done did it
[54:02] so the devil can come and say that God
[54:05] don't move anymore it's too late we're
[54:07] still experiencing the power of
[54:10] Pentecost we're experiencing the power
[54:12] that is inside of this a message oh my
[54:15] the devil don't got enough to stop this
[54:18] bride how come because heavens and earth
[54:20] may pass away but this word this message
[54:23] will never fail oh we're standing upon
[54:26] shopping that has enough to meet the
[54:28] challenge oh my what's that mean to meet
[54:31] the challenge you're equipped with
[54:32] enough you've got the capability to
[54:36] stand against the challengers oh my
[54:38] Warner standing in our own ability we're
[54:40] not standing in our own strengths but
[54:43] we're standing with an anointing so the
[54:45] enemy is challenged and the enemy's
[54:47] challenge must be met you see he's
[54:49] challenging the word because once we
[54:52] throw away the word we throw away our
[54:54] resources and I believe the only way we
[54:57] can accept the word and believe the word
[54:59] is through the Holy Ghost oh my brother
[55:01] Branham says what meets the challenge is
[55:03] to be endued with power from on high oh
[55:07] my soul that's what meets The Challenge
[55:09] the Bible says in John 17 and 15. I pray
[55:13] not that thou shouldest take them out of
[55:15] the world but thou should keep a stem
[55:17] from Evil oh Marshall with the sin
[55:20] nature where Noah is going to go after
[55:22] evil there's no way to accept the truth
[55:25] when we up a nature of alive there's no
[55:28] way we can accept what's right when the
[55:30] Nature's on the inside is craving Rogue
[55:33] but but Jesus says don't take them off
[55:35] the earth I need some witnesses don't
[55:38] take them off but I want them to be
[55:40] right in the middle of the most evil age
[55:43] right in the middle of the most wicked
[55:45] age and you're going to keep them
[55:47] there's going to be an anointing that's
[55:50] going to stand against the tide that's
[55:53] going to stand against the odds when
[55:55] this one's falling away when that one's
[55:57] backsliding then this one's a disgrace
[55:59] there's somebody on Earth that's meeting
[56:01] the challenge we're anointed they're
[56:04] staying against the tide oh you may say
[56:07] brother Josh you don't know what I'm
[56:08] going through I don't care what you're
[56:09] going through there's an annoying thing
[56:11] that's on your life that can keep you
[56:13] through every trial and through every
[56:16] circumstance you see without the Holy
[56:18] Ghost there's no power to enforce the
[56:21] word you notice how the Bible puts it be
[56:23] strong in the power of His might which
[56:26] is the Holy Ghost then the next verse
[56:28] says put on the whole armor of God
[56:31] which is the word of God which is the
[56:34] message I believe but in order to put on
[56:36] the whole armor of God you have to be
[56:39] strong in his might
[56:40] oh so you can't take the word and make a
[56:43] live without his might without the Holy
[56:46] Ghost that's where many people hail they
[56:49] come to church they listen to the
[56:50] message they get ahead knowledge but
[56:52] there's no authority to make the word
[56:55] live there's no authority to produce
[56:58] what is on the inside you know the Bible
[57:00] the Bible says the word is the seed
[57:02] remember the parable and the yeah and
[57:05] Luke 8 the shoulder went out and sowed
[57:07] the seed the Bible says of Hell by the
[57:10] wayside of Hell by the thorns and this
[57:12] thistles and what stood out to me the
[57:14] Bible says it fell by The Rock and the
[57:16] Bible says it started to grow up it
[57:19] started to bring forth the life but
[57:21] there was no moisture to water it oh my
[57:24] source started to die even though the
[57:26] potential was there
[57:31] help the water without the moisture and
[57:35] started to fall away and brother Branham
[57:37] says the moisture is the type of the
[57:39] Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost the
[57:41] word has no authority to produce itself
[57:44] oh but with the Holy Ghost there's
[57:46] nothing in laodicea that can keep the
[57:49] word from coming to pass oh my you're
[57:52] seeing an apple seed has the potential
[57:55] of every Apple that was going to come
[57:57] forth but inside of the seed is just the
[58:00] potential no power to enforce it oh so
[58:03] you got to plant the seed in some ground
[58:06] and let them for sure let the water
[58:08] start to water that seed and then that
[58:11] then that quick and something on the
[58:13] inside to enforce the potential oh then
[58:16] it goes from potential to manifestation
[58:19] oh man right now the pride it has
[58:22] potentials on the inside to be an
[58:24] overcomer to be the the march of a lush
[58:27] the pornography but we needed something
[58:29] to bring that for potential it's a
[58:32] manifestation and that was the Holy
[58:34] Ghost that it forced the seed to come to
[58:38] life Oh Maya now we're not a potential
[58:41] bride we're not a potential Overcomer
[58:43] but we're manifesting the potential of
[58:46] the seed God's not coming after a
[58:49] potential Overcomer he's not coming
[58:51] after a potential bride but he that
[58:53] overcometh will share with me in my
[58:56] throat there's an overcomer on her
[58:58] that's not a potential but it's a
[59:01] manifesting the power of the Living God
[59:03] oh my you're part of that Pride that's a
[59:07] manifesting the power of the Living God
[59:09] oh my second Corinthians three and six
[59:12] who also has made us able Ministers of
[59:15] the New Testament not of the letter but
[59:18] of the spirit for the letter killeth but
[59:20] the spirit giveth life so the word has
[59:23] no Authority in your life without the
[59:26] water
[59:27] oh come on somebody oh the word has no
[59:31] Authority in your life without the Holy
[59:33] Ghost brother Brandon would say you're
[59:35] not even off first base we'll stop the
[59:37] Holy Ghost so we have to have the Holy
[59:40] Ghost to bring the seed from potential
[59:42] to manifestation and that's what meets
[59:46] the challenge you look at John 14 and
[59:48] 15. if you love me keep my Commandments
[59:51] and I will pray the father and he shall
[59:53] give you another comforter that he may
[59:55] abide with you forever so the anointing
[59:58] that's going to fall in your life ain't
[1:00:00] going to leave you tomorrow ain't going
[1:00:02] to leave you the next day but it's going
[1:00:04] to abide take a precedence oh mind's not
[1:00:08] moving out but he's going to abide
[1:00:10] forever and that distract me the other
[1:00:12] day if she'll love me keep my
[1:00:15] commandments so I believe that's talking
[1:00:16] about the seed he's placing a part of
[1:00:19] his love for himself that's what's going
[1:00:22] to draw you the Bible says no man cometh
[1:00:24] to me unless the father first draws him
[1:00:27] that's the predestinated seed I may have
[1:00:30] said it before but I don't believe
[1:00:31] predestination is a crutch where you see
[1:00:34] I'm predestinated so I can do this I can
[1:00:36] live way however I want that's not the
[1:00:39] way predestination works but what's the
[1:00:41] Bible say the wages of sin is death so
[1:00:44] that's far away from God but the gift of
[1:00:46] God is eternal life so what's
[1:00:49] predestination it draws you to the gift
[1:00:51] which is the Holy Ghost oh Hallelujah
[1:00:55] but if you love me keep my Commandments
[1:00:57] and I believe he knew it was going to be
[1:01:00] impossible to keep the word but then he
[1:01:03] says I'm going to send you a comforter
[1:01:05] I'm going to send an anointing I'm going
[1:01:08] to send the Holy Ghost so that the
[1:01:11] potential the love that is on the inside
[1:01:13] can start to manifest itself oh man I
[1:01:17] believe that the anointing can fall in
[1:01:19] every life in every home and every
[1:01:22] marriage on the job site where you're
[1:01:24] manifesting the love of God you're
[1:01:27] manifesting what the Lord's saying
[1:01:29] before the foundation of the world it's
[1:01:32] an anointing that gives you an authority
[1:01:34] to make the world live and I believe
[1:01:37] once the anointing comes upon a life we
[1:01:39] become bold we come bold with the
[1:01:42] promises of God we're not wishy-washy
[1:01:44] we're not blown away by every wound of
[1:01:47] Doctrine but something has anchored only
[1:01:49] inside that I become bored with the
[1:01:52] promises of God for the Branham says
[1:01:54] when something is revealed you become
[1:01:56] Fearless oh you become Fearless you're
[1:02:00] no longer worried about what the
[1:02:01] naysayers are saying oh they may say
[1:02:04] that this message is post that God don't
[1:02:06] fill with the Holy Ghost but I don't
[1:02:08] care what they're saying it's been
[1:02:10] revealed to me the potential that is on
[1:02:13] the inside has been revealed oh
[1:02:15] hallelujah it's been revealed and I've
[1:02:18] proven to the world that Jesus Christ is
[1:02:21] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:02:24] there's something about the anointing
[1:02:26] you look at acts 4 and 12. neither is
[1:02:29] there salvation in any other name for
[1:02:31] there was none other name under Heaven
[1:02:33] given among men whereby we must be saved
[1:02:37] and when they saw the boldness of Peter
[1:02:39] and John perceived that they were
[1:02:42] unlearned and ignorant men they marveled
[1:02:44] and took knowledge of them that they had
[1:02:47] been with Jesus
[1:02:48] they said that what they're producing oh
[1:02:51] my their manifestation
[1:02:54] ain't a part of them this ain't the men
[1:02:57] we remember
[1:02:58] these ain't the ones that that we
[1:03:00] remember them running up in the upper
[1:03:01] room they were scared because they were
[1:03:03] going to be you're going to be killed
[1:03:05] and they were being persecuted what made
[1:03:07] the difference and the only conclusion
[1:03:09] they could come up with was they had
[1:03:12] been with Jesus
[1:03:14] they had been with Jesus the anointing
[1:03:17] makes the difference no longer were they
[1:03:20] scared but they were standing up against
[1:03:22] the challenge it was the scribes and the
[1:03:25] Pharisees that was challenging Christ
[1:03:27] there was challenging Christianity and
[1:03:30] they was running from The Challenge but
[1:03:32] once the anointing Came Upon them there
[1:03:35] was no longer running but they had
[1:03:37] enough to meet it they had enough to say
[1:03:40] there's no other salvation but in Jesus
[1:03:43] Christ and they looked to send my
[1:03:45] whatever they got is the genuine thing
[1:03:48] whatever they caught changed them oh my
[1:03:52] brother Brandon must say let's notice
[1:03:54] Pentecost how they acted and see how
[1:03:56] they were quickened by this quickening
[1:03:58] power they were talking about on the day
[1:04:01] of Pentecost they were all waiting up
[1:04:03] there in themselves they were afraid so
[1:04:06] before the anointing they were afraid
[1:04:09] the Jews just what they were going to do
[1:04:11] so they got scared but what happened
[1:04:13] when this quick getting power fell from
[1:04:16] heaven there was a bravery that shed
[1:04:18] upon them
[1:04:20] there was a bravery that set upon them
[1:04:22] there was something in understanding
[1:04:24] where they wasn't too sure of it a few
[1:04:27] hours ago they knew he had died they
[1:04:29] knew he had risen they had talked to him
[1:04:32] on the way but was that for them or was
[1:04:35] it just for Jesus himself oh my but then
[1:04:39] they found the reality of it this
[1:04:41] anointing ain't Just for Jesus but it's
[1:04:44] for me you must say does God still fill
[1:04:46] with the Holy Ghost taste and see that
[1:04:49] the Lord is good this ain't just for the
[1:04:51] prophet just this this ain't just for
[1:04:53] the pastor or for the preacher but it's
[1:04:55] for everyone that's Gotta Love
[1:04:58] it's for everyone that has a desire on
[1:05:01] the inside this anointing is for you oh
[1:05:05] my is the quickening power the anointing
[1:05:08] that makes the difference
[1:05:10] you see what's separated David from his
[1:05:13] brothers they was from the same tribe
[1:05:15] they was from the same Heritage they was
[1:05:18] from the same parents they were brothers
[1:05:20] they were siblings but what made the
[1:05:23] difference the anointing
[1:05:25] how come there was I there I believe
[1:05:27] there were seven brothers I believe they
[1:05:28] were all hiding in the capes they was
[1:05:30] afraid to stand up against Goliath but
[1:05:33] then there was the youngest the one that
[1:05:35] didn't have no capabilities he didn't
[1:05:37] have no muscles he was a strong and
[1:05:40] stature but there was one thing that he
[1:05:42] had he had a response to the anointing
[1:05:45] oh there was something responding to the
[1:05:48] anointing we know how the story goes the
[1:05:51] God told Samuel the prophet to go anoint
[1:05:54] the king to choose somebody to be raised
[1:05:57] up in a position of authority oh man I
[1:06:00] believe that God sent the prophet in
[1:06:02] this day to anoint somebody for a
[1:06:04] position of authority we're not meant to
[1:06:07] serve we're meant to Reign you're not
[1:06:10] meant to be serving sin and to serve
[1:06:12] addictions and to serve the things of
[1:06:14] the world you're meant to Reign you're
[1:06:17] meant to Reign Over every Spirit you're
[1:06:19] meant to Reign Over everything the Lego
[1:06:21] Russia has oh you've got enough to meet
[1:06:24] it you've got enough to meet the
[1:06:26] challenge oh my soul so the prophet
[1:06:29] comes to Jesse's house and Jesse's own
[1:06:32] father didn't think the boy had What it
[1:06:35] Took
[1:06:36] he didn't think he had What it Took but
[1:06:38] the anointing had it the anointing had
[1:06:41] what David lacked oh my and the
[1:06:44] anointing hash what the pride lacks the
[1:06:47] anointing has what the world lacks it's
[1:06:50] their power to enforce the words oh my
[1:06:54] so he comes up before the before the
[1:06:56] eldest brother it says my strongest
[1:06:58] stature this has got to be the one that
[1:07:01] the Lord chooses and the Lord says no
[1:07:03] I've refused him I don't look on the
[1:07:05] outwards I don't look at the stature but
[1:07:08] I look at the heart I'll look at what's
[1:07:11] on the inside I look at the love I
[1:07:14] looked at what I put before the
[1:07:17] foundation of the world
[1:07:19] oh my if you don't got a seat there's
[1:07:22] nothing to be quickened the anointing
[1:07:24] the Bible says the rain falls on the
[1:07:26] jest and the unjust so if there's an
[1:07:28] apple seed sitting right here and
[1:07:30] there's a pear tree sitting right here
[1:07:32] the same rain is going to fall on both
[1:07:34] seats but the pair has nothing to bring
[1:07:37] forth apples
[1:07:38] all in the serpent seat has nothing to
[1:07:41] bring forth the Life of Christ but
[1:07:44] you're privileged your priv that's God
[1:07:46] placed a part of himself before the
[1:07:49] foundation of the world so that there
[1:07:51] can be something respond to the
[1:07:53] anointing oh come on somebody there's
[1:07:57] something that's responding to the
[1:07:59] anointing
[1:08:00] because you look at David that he with
[1:08:02] the the prophet Samuel went throughout
[1:08:04] the brothers and he said no this time
[1:08:06] put one and he looked at Jesse he says
[1:08:08] is there any other brothers is there any
[1:08:10] other sons and he says well there's one
[1:08:12] more but he's a nobody he he's ready
[1:08:15] he's not strong in stature but the
[1:08:18] prophet says that we're not going to sit
[1:08:20] till he gets here so go fetch him and
[1:08:24] there was somebody that went that's
[1:08:25] called David's name and so in order for
[1:08:28] David to be anointed he had to respond
[1:08:32] come on somebody that I'm sure there was
[1:08:34] a messenger that started calling out
[1:08:36] David hey David David somebody wants to
[1:08:39] talk to you and he would stop and he say
[1:08:41] me are you sure he's not talking about
[1:08:43] my brothers now is your name David yes
[1:08:46] my name is David he could call him by
[1:08:48] name oh there was something that was a
[1:08:51] deep calleth through the deep and there
[1:08:53] was something on the inside that started
[1:08:55] to respond to the tugging and as he was
[1:08:58] responding he was being anointed and as
[1:09:02] you respond to the tug of the seed there
[1:09:05] can be an anointing that can fall in
[1:09:07] your life and that can bring the life on
[1:09:10] the outside that can bring their seed to
[1:09:12] life and that it can manifest itself
[1:09:15] and so David would respond to the call
[1:09:18] and as he would respond to the call that
[1:09:21] the prophet would come up before him
[1:09:22] said this is the one the Lord chose and
[1:09:25] when I love about it he dumped he
[1:09:27] grabbed the anointing oil and dump it
[1:09:29] all on David he didn't spare any
[1:09:31] he didn't live not for another day he
[1:09:35] didn't leave none for another Age come
[1:09:37] on somebody or what was in God he poured
[1:09:40] into Christ and what was in Christ he
[1:09:42] pours out on the church they're in
[1:09:45] another day coming there ain't another
[1:09:46] Pride coming this is it he poured
[1:09:49] himself upon the bride so that you can
[1:09:52] have enough to meet the challenge oh
[1:09:55] Hallelujah so the Holy Ghost gives the
[1:09:58] ability to recognize what your true
[1:10:01] potential is it gives you the ability to
[1:10:04] notice what is in your midst oh my soul
[1:10:07] without remember without the Holy Ghost
[1:10:09] you can't make the word live hope this
[1:10:11] is okay without the Holy Ghost you can't
[1:10:14] recognize the word you look at First
[1:10:16] Corinthians 12 and 3 wherefore I gives
[1:10:19] you to understand that no man speaketh
[1:10:21] by the spirit of God College calleth
[1:10:24] Jesus a curse that no man can say that
[1:10:27] Jesus is the Lord but by the anointing
[1:10:30] so the only way you can notice notice
[1:10:34] the anointed is by the anointing
[1:10:38] come on somebody you can't recognize
[1:10:40] that this message is the truth without
[1:10:43] the anointing but with the anointing
[1:10:46] with the Holy Ghost it will lead you to
[1:10:49] the anointed
[1:10:51] oh my brother Brandon would say I tell
[1:10:54] you just as that eagle recognize the
[1:10:56] voice so does a real born-again
[1:10:59] Christian recognize the voice of God
[1:11:02] speaking through the word when they see
[1:11:05] it anointed and Vindicated the anointing
[1:11:08] always leads you to the anointed oh my
[1:11:12] that's why I believe brother Brandon
[1:11:14] even says it if you've got the real
[1:11:15] genuine Holy Ghost it will lead you to
[1:11:18] the message
[1:11:19] that's what he said if you've got the
[1:11:21] Holy Ghost the anointing it will lead
[1:11:23] you to the anointing you look at Luke 2
[1:11:26] and 25 and behold there was a man in
[1:11:29] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon a left
[1:11:31] how it identifies him because there was
[1:11:33] the many men in Jerusalem but there was
[1:11:36] only one that was going to be anointed
[1:11:38] oh come on I'm feeling good this evening
[1:11:40] there's many church members out here
[1:11:42] there's many of those billions of people
[1:11:44] on Earth but there's only one group
[1:11:46] that's Anointed with the anointing to
[1:11:50] see the anointed
[1:11:51] oh my there was a many there was many
[1:11:54] scribes there was many many Pharisees
[1:11:56] there was many preachers but there was
[1:11:58] only one guy that was called to save the
[1:12:00] anointed oh Hallelujah there was a man
[1:12:03] of Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and
[1:12:06] the same man was just and about waiting
[1:12:08] for the consolation of Israel and the
[1:12:11] Holy Ghost was upon him and it was
[1:12:13] revealed unto him by the anointing by
[1:12:16] the holy ghost that he should not see
[1:12:18] death before he had seen the anointed
[1:12:22] oh come on somebody and before he had
[1:12:26] seen the Lord's Christ I like how it
[1:12:29] puts it the Lord's Christ there's many
[1:12:31] anointed there's so many there's this
[1:12:34] many Christ and false prophets that's
[1:12:36] got a genuine anointing brother Branham
[1:12:38] says uh uh I can't remember the sermon
[1:12:41] right now anointed once at the end time
[1:12:43] he says it's a genuine anointing but the
[1:12:46] only way to separate the two is by the
[1:12:48] word and so here it is they're waiting
[1:12:51] for the Christ and there come a time
[1:12:54] well I'll read the next verse and he
[1:12:56] came by the spirit into the temple when
[1:12:59] the parents brought the Child Jesus to
[1:13:01] do for him after the customs of the law
[1:13:04] they took him up in his arms and blessed
[1:13:07] God and said Lord now let us thy servant
[1:13:10] depart in peace according to Thy word
[1:13:12] from mine eyes have seen thy salvation
[1:13:16] I'm brother Branham must say that there
[1:13:18] was thousands of people in Palestine I
[1:13:21] believe that's where it was he says
[1:13:22] there are thousands of people hundreds
[1:13:24] of mamas with babies but what made the
[1:13:26] difference he says he was being led by
[1:13:28] the spirit he was being led by the
[1:13:31] anointing to the anointed and there was
[1:13:34] the many scribes though I'm sure would
[1:13:36] walk right by Jesus and never paid him a
[1:13:38] bit of attention
[1:13:40] walks right by Mary and Joseph and
[1:13:42] didn't pay them attention but there was
[1:13:44] an old man that recognized the anointed
[1:13:47] oh man there's many people that has
[1:13:50] turned away this message and said no he
[1:13:52] was a false prophet they might not
[1:13:54] recognize it but I recognize what is in
[1:13:57] our midst it's the anointed word Jesus
[1:14:00] Christ and it's the anointing on the
[1:14:03] inside that is responding recognizing
[1:14:06] the anointed oh Hallelujah here's the
[1:14:10] quote I was talking about brother
[1:14:11] Branham says no matter how religious you
[1:14:13] are how many churches you belong to how
[1:14:16] many books your name is on if that
[1:14:19] genuine Holy Ghost is in you which is
[1:14:22] the word manifest you'll see the message
[1:14:24] and the hour
[1:14:27] you can't help but say it because the
[1:14:30] same anointing that anointed the word is
[1:14:33] anointing your life
[1:14:35] oh my the same anointing the simple word
[1:14:38] is anointing a vessel to receive the
[1:14:41] word come know somebody you're not
[1:14:43] responding in your own ability but the
[1:14:46] same anointing that anointed the word
[1:14:48] and shall let there be light was the
[1:14:50] same anointing thing that went with the
[1:14:52] word to make it come to pass
[1:14:54] oh Hallelujah and that same anointing is
[1:14:57] then a bride that is taking a hold of
[1:15:00] this message and making it come to life
[1:15:02] this message ain't just to stay on the
[1:15:05] tapes ain't the same on the iPads but
[1:15:08] it's coming inside of a multi-member
[1:15:10] bride and making the word live and show
[1:15:13] it to the world that God's not defeated
[1:15:15] God's not bad but there's a pride with
[1:15:18] the Life of Christ meeting the challenge
[1:15:21] oh my we've got enough to meet the
[1:15:24] challenge
[1:15:25] the anointing recognizes the anointing
[1:15:28] look at Matthew 12 and 49 but he
[1:15:32] answered and said unto them and evil and
[1:15:34] adulteration seeketh after a sign that
[1:15:38] struck me he didn't say the elect is
[1:15:41] seeking after a sign they found who they
[1:15:43] were looking for
[1:15:45] oh they found it but it was the
[1:15:47] adulterous generation the evil
[1:15:49] generation was constantly looking for
[1:15:52] something to come
[1:15:54] I'm preaching now there's many people
[1:15:56] that's still looking for Malachi 4.
[1:15:59] they're still looking for Luke 17 30
[1:16:01] still looking for the seals to be open
[1:16:04] but the anointed the anointing that is
[1:16:07] in the pride has opened our eyes where
[1:16:10] we're no longer looking but we're
[1:16:12] enjoying it we're now waiting for the
[1:16:15] bride's Revival I'm enjoying the Pride's
[1:16:19] Revival we have found truth oh my
[1:16:22] brother Josh how do you know truth
[1:16:24] because of the anointed word the the
[1:16:27] truth or we shall know the truth and the
[1:16:29] truth shall set us free so our eyes have
[1:16:32] been open has I we're no longer looking
[1:16:34] through confusion but we're looking
[1:16:36] through the truth and now our eyes have
[1:16:39] been opened look at Matthew 11 and 2.
[1:16:42] now when John had heard in the prison
[1:16:44] The Works of Christ he sent two of his
[1:16:47] disciples and said unto him or thou the
[1:16:50] the one that are your thou he that
[1:16:52] should come or do we look for another
[1:16:54] and Jesus answered and said unto them go
[1:16:58] and show us go show John again those
[1:17:01] things which you do here and see the
[1:17:03] blind receive their sight the lame walk
[1:17:06] the lepers are cleansed the death here
[1:17:08] the dead erased the poor have the gospel
[1:17:11] preached through the to them so Jesus
[1:17:14] was saying the Vindication of the
[1:17:16] anointed one was the word being flesh
[1:17:20] oh the Vindication what would Jesus say
[1:17:24] search the scriptures for when them
[1:17:26] testify of me so if you want to see the
[1:17:30] anointed word you will always say it
[1:17:32] through the Bible you will always seen
[1:17:35] through scripture and so Jesus was
[1:17:37] saying go tell John what you seem and
[1:17:40] what you hear the Vindication of who I
[1:17:43] am is through the manifestation oh and
[1:17:47] the Vindication of what this message
[1:17:49] really is is through your life
[1:17:52] oh my heart you know we there can be an
[1:17:55] argument that people can use then say
[1:17:58] the message ain't real the message ain't
[1:18:00] alive they died with brother Branham but
[1:18:02] the argument ceases when there's a young
[1:18:04] person on Earth with the life of the
[1:18:06] message in their body then that argument
[1:18:09] ceases remember the story of the blind
[1:18:12] man that had a sight the the the the the
[1:18:14] preachers went up to him and says man
[1:18:17] this is Beelzebub he's a liar he's this
[1:18:19] and he's that and he stops and he says
[1:18:21] whether he'd be a sinner or no I don't
[1:18:24] know all I know was I was blind but now
[1:18:28] I see the manifestation of the power of
[1:18:31] Christ was revealed through his vessel
[1:18:35] oh and a manifestation of the power of
[1:18:38] Christ is being revealed through your
[1:18:41] vessels our arguments have to cease
[1:18:44] oh my there's not a doubt that there's a
[1:18:48] message ain't alive because of a body on
[1:18:50] Earth that's a manifesting it
[1:18:53] so we're no longer looking but what I
[1:18:55] like about that was was John gonna have
[1:18:58] to see the physical body of Christ he
[1:19:01] just had to see the anoints of the word
[1:19:03] he had to see the manifestation and we
[1:19:06] might not see the physical body of Jesus
[1:19:09] Christ that was walked in the shores of
[1:19:11] Galilee but we know he's here because of
[1:19:13] the anointed word it's doing the same
[1:19:16] signs that was in Scriptures it has the
[1:19:18] same accents that was in scriptures it's
[1:19:21] doing it today it's Jesus Christ the
[1:19:24] same yesterday today and forever we're
[1:19:27] no longer looking but we have found it
[1:19:29] remember the parable of the lost coin a
[1:19:31] woman who lost her coin and she went out
[1:19:34] searching and searching but once she
[1:19:36] found it she was no longer searching but
[1:19:39] she was rejoicing
[1:19:41] come on somebody what's the bible say
[1:19:43] that she got the neighbors together I
[1:19:45] believe and says let's have a party
[1:19:47] let's Rejoice for the coin that I lost I
[1:19:51] have now found
[1:19:52] there was no there was no purpose in
[1:19:55] looking anymore because she found what
[1:19:57] she was looking for oh there's no
[1:20:00] purpose to keep looking for something to
[1:20:03] come there's no purpose in looking for
[1:20:05] somebody to open this house they're
[1:20:07] already open
[1:20:09] it's already open it's time to enjoy
[1:20:12] what was under the seals it's time to
[1:20:14] enjoy the bride's Revival it's time to
[1:20:17] rejoice and say thank you Lord for this
[1:20:20] message thank you Lord from Malachi 4.
[1:20:23] I'm no longer looking but I'm enjoying
[1:20:26] it let's Rejoice for we see what is
[1:20:30] under the seals it was John when the
[1:20:33] book was open the Bible says all under
[1:20:35] the Earth and above above the Earth hurt
[1:20:37] I John say he's seen his name and
[1:20:40] started to Rejoice because now he was no
[1:20:43] longer guessing oh Hallelujah that his
[1:20:45] name was on the book but because the
[1:20:47] seals was open he could now see his name
[1:20:50] on the book you may say brother Josh how
[1:20:54] come we can rejoice and get happy
[1:20:55] because I know that I know that I'm the
[1:20:58] serpent seed I'm the pride of Jesus
[1:21:01] Christ I'm not guessing because the
[1:21:03] seals have been open I can see my name
[1:21:07] oh I can see who I am
[1:21:10] oh my father never seen a reflection on
[1:21:13] myself I wouldn't know if I had brown
[1:21:15] eyes or if I had blue eyes
[1:21:17] I would be taking somebody's opinion
[1:21:20] oh Hallelujah I'll be using somebody
[1:21:23] else's Revelation uh and somebody could
[1:21:26] come by faith you could come up to me
[1:21:28] and say Josh you got blue eyes and I
[1:21:31] couldn't argue with her Revelation
[1:21:32] because I've never seen him I would say
[1:21:35] well Uncle Sean says I've got brown eyes
[1:21:37] and he would say no he's lying to you
[1:21:39] and now I'm passed in between two
[1:21:42] opinions it's only about an opinion
[1:21:44] until it's revealed
[1:21:46] that's pretty good the message is only
[1:21:50] an opinion to you until it's revealed
[1:21:52] then one is once it's revealed it's no
[1:21:55] longer an opinion but it's a revelation
[1:21:58] and now the devil's got no room with the
[1:22:01] Revelation Oh Glory to God I think it's
[1:22:04] time that we get a revelation of this
[1:22:06] message not a head knowledge but a
[1:22:08] revelation and when the Devil comes and
[1:22:10] he says this and he says that you can
[1:22:12] say no devil you don't know what I know
[1:22:14] you might not be able to see what's
[1:22:17] under the seals but I can see it oh I
[1:22:21] can see it with the Revelation oh my so
[1:22:24] now I'm torn in between two opinions
[1:22:26] what am I going to believe am I going to
[1:22:29] believe I got blue eyes or brown eyes
[1:22:31] and so the only way to settle the
[1:22:34] argument is to get a mirror then once I
[1:22:36] get a mirror I can see now with not with
[1:22:39] Uncle Sean's Revelation but with my own
[1:22:42] Revelation that I don't got blue eyes
[1:22:44] but I've got brown eyes and before you
[1:22:47] see your name in the book you're just
[1:22:50] guessing you're taking the pastor's word
[1:22:52] that you're going to make a Rapture come
[1:22:54] on somebody you're just taking your
[1:22:56] parents word that you're not reference
[1:22:58] hate but once you see your name what you
[1:23:01] see what's under the seals it's no more
[1:23:04] an opinion but it's a revelation you
[1:23:07] know your identity you know where you're
[1:23:09] going you know your future when you know
[1:23:12] your future you know not what you you
[1:23:14] know what's not going to happen when you
[1:23:17] know whether that's your virtuous blood
[1:23:19] what bride Blood Washed bride of Jesus
[1:23:22] Christ you know you're not going to the
[1:23:24] tribulation so you don't got to worry
[1:23:26] about it oh come on somebody you know
[1:23:29] you're not going to hell because you
[1:23:32] know your future and this this message
[1:23:34] has revealed to me my future I'm not
[1:23:38] going down I'm going up I'm not going
[1:23:40] down defeated I'm going up an overcomer
[1:23:43] I know my identity because of a
[1:23:47] revelation of what was under the seals
[1:23:50] I'm anointed I'm anointed to stand
[1:23:54] against The Wiles of the devil
[1:23:57] oh he has no right to come up or say
[1:24:00] your serpent seed with the anointing
[1:24:02] he's got no right but before the
[1:24:05] anointing thing he does got it right
[1:24:06] there's no power to enforce the word but
[1:24:09] once there's the enforcer on the inside
[1:24:12] you've got every ability every Power
[1:24:15] every authority to stand up against the
[1:24:18] Wows of the devil and say no it's not by
[1:24:22] might it's not by power but it's by by
[1:24:25] anointing
[1:24:26] it's by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:24:30] who am I so whenever you're looking for
[1:24:32] something you're you and it's right in
[1:24:35] front of you you're going to walk right
[1:24:36] by it because you're looking in the
[1:24:38] future
[1:24:39] and say oh I I was looking for my phone
[1:24:42] and my phone's sitting right here and in
[1:24:45] my mind my opinion is in the office and
[1:24:49] so if I never seen it right there I
[1:24:51] didn't know it was in my midst I'm going
[1:24:53] to walk down the stairs through one door
[1:24:56] through the other door and be farther
[1:24:58] away from it than I have ever been
[1:25:00] before because I'm following my own
[1:25:02] opinion
[1:25:04] I'm preaching now that's what happens
[1:25:07] with a man's opinions the anointing word
[1:25:10] is right in front of us right in our
[1:25:12] midst but because of men's opinions
[1:25:15] we're constantly looking somewhere else
[1:25:17] and he went to Father away all I need to
[1:25:20] do is to look and recognize that my
[1:25:23] phone is in my presence it's in my midst
[1:25:26] it's not a million miles away oh my the
[1:25:30] anointed word Jesus Christ ain't a
[1:25:32] million miles away but his presence the
[1:25:34] anointed one is right in this building
[1:25:37] it can be in your home it can be in your
[1:25:39] car it's not a Million Miles Away better
[1:25:42] right here with you
[1:25:44] oh don't miss it you got to recognize it
[1:25:47] if you don't recognize it you're gonna
[1:25:50] walk right by it oh my brother Brandon
[1:25:53] says the appearing of Christ and the
[1:25:55] coming of Christ is two different things
[1:25:59] he says he's appeared now in the
[1:26:01] fullness
[1:26:03] oh I love this in the fullness of his
[1:26:06] power not just a portion of it but his
[1:26:09] release the devil's released all of his
[1:26:11] anointing all of his authority but so as
[1:26:14] Christ he's released the fullness of his
[1:26:16] power but brother Branham says how was
[1:26:19] that how is it here by his presence
[1:26:22] being recognized so before you can use
[1:26:25] this under this Authority you've got to
[1:26:28] recognize what's in your midst
[1:26:31] oh my like I said I can't pick up my
[1:26:34] phone and operate it without me
[1:26:36] recognizing it
[1:26:37] oh and you can't pick up this message
[1:26:39] and operate it without you recognizing
[1:26:42] it it is the anointed word
[1:26:45] oh hope this is okay this evening
[1:26:48] oh my that they they uh they could see
[1:26:51] this message but without recognizing it
[1:26:54] what it really is you look at the
[1:26:56] soldier let's smack Jesus but no virtue
[1:26:58] was released to him there was no virtue
[1:27:01] but then there was a woman with an issue
[1:27:03] of blood that touched the same vessel
[1:27:05] but there was a Power released what made
[1:27:08] the difference one recognized the
[1:27:11] anointed
[1:27:12] oh and the other one didn't recognize
[1:27:14] who was in the midst so whenever you
[1:27:17] recognize the anointed that releases the
[1:27:20] power
[1:27:21] oh that releases an authority that can
[1:27:25] heal your body like those that can save
[1:27:27] your soul that can save your loved ones
[1:27:29] oh brother Branham says when the
[1:27:31] prostitute recognized the presence of
[1:27:34] Jesus at Simon's house that released to
[1:27:37] her her forgiveness
[1:27:39] oh come on somebody that released to her
[1:27:42] what she was looking for you know in
[1:27:45] every man that she went out with she was
[1:27:47] looking for something she was trying to
[1:27:49] find satisfaction you notice brother
[1:27:51] Brandon would say that God places The
[1:27:54] Thirst on the inside and the only way
[1:27:56] that that thirst can be quenched is by
[1:27:59] God himself so what that woman was
[1:28:01] trying to quench could only be quenched
[1:28:03] by the anointed oh come on somebody the
[1:28:07] only way that that's that she can be
[1:28:09] satisfied was by recognizing the
[1:28:12] anointed oh my you may be miserable you
[1:28:16] may you may feel like a wretch all you
[1:28:18] need to do is get the anointing
[1:28:21] that's what you're missing you may say
[1:28:23] brother Josh doesn't know I can't
[1:28:25] overcome pornography I can't overcome
[1:28:27] lust I can't overcome cussing you need
[1:28:30] the anointing you need something to
[1:28:33] bring the word to life
[1:28:36] hope this is okay this evening but you
[1:28:39] notice that she wasn't even that that uh
[1:28:43] uh she wasn't even the one that invited
[1:28:45] him invited him to the house it was
[1:28:47] Simon it was the other the the priest I
[1:28:50] believe that was all surrounding Jesus
[1:28:52] but they never recognized he was in
[1:28:55] their midst
[1:28:56] oh but there was a little woman that was
[1:28:59] she wasn't there I know she was a nobody
[1:29:01] she wasn't even allowed to be in there
[1:29:03] but something started to respond there
[1:29:06] was a deep responding to the deep and
[1:29:07] she says my that's who I'm searching for
[1:29:10] and you notice after she fell in love
[1:29:12] with Christ after her sins were forgiven
[1:29:15] she didn't go chased any more men
[1:29:17] because what she was looking for she
[1:29:20] found
[1:29:21] oh hallelujah what she was looking for
[1:29:24] she had found brother Branham says and I
[1:29:28] think that today we have much fun
[1:29:30] preaching many fine ministers able
[1:29:32] ministers that has brought us the word
[1:29:34] your pastors and evangelists and so
[1:29:36] forth comes through the city but I think
[1:29:38] the main thing that I'm trying to bring
[1:29:40] to you is the reality of the presence of
[1:29:44] Christ that you might see him and know
[1:29:47] him it's him by his identified promise
[1:29:50] for the day his identified he's
[1:29:54] identifying himself through the anointed
[1:29:56] word if you can just recognize the
[1:29:59] reality of the presence it will change
[1:30:03] your ideas it will change your thinking
[1:30:05] but you got to recognize it oh you've
[1:30:08] got to recognize it so once you
[1:30:10] recognize him it changes you like the
[1:30:13] like The Prostitute it changed her she
[1:30:15] was no longer following her own desires
[1:30:17] but now she was following Christ's
[1:30:19] desires and so what's your recognize the
[1:30:22] anointed word you're no longer following
[1:30:25] your own ideas your own opinions but
[1:30:27] know the words opinion has become your
[1:30:30] opinion the words idea has become your
[1:30:33] idea because the anointing on the inside
[1:30:35] has recognized the anointed and it's
[1:30:39] changed your ideas I hope you're
[1:30:41] following me this evening it's changing
[1:30:43] what you think is right brother Branham
[1:30:45] says would you deny what Jesus did
[1:30:47] himself what the Bible itself speaks out
[1:30:50] which is Christ the anointed word and if
[1:30:52] the word abides in you then you're the
[1:30:55] anointed person with the word you
[1:30:58] anointed to meet the challenge you're
[1:31:00] the one that's taken the word and saying
[1:31:03] up a might not by power but by my spirit
[1:31:05] I'm anointed the stand right here in the
[1:31:08] middle of laodicea and prove to the
[1:31:11] devil there is a bride there is a
[1:31:15] spotless Pride oh Hallelujah in that
[1:31:18] same quote you're the anointed person
[1:31:20] with the word here invited me my word
[1:31:22] abide in you then ask what you will
[1:31:25] it'll be done for you that's Christ in
[1:31:27] you the anointing anointing the word for
[1:31:30] this age oh wherever whatever age they
[1:31:34] lived in God divided his word to the
[1:31:36] ages and every time it comes to that
[1:31:39] time the church is all scrupled it up
[1:31:41] and God anoints somebody sends it down
[1:31:44] and makes the word act just exactly the
[1:31:47] way he said it would exactly there's a
[1:31:50] word promise for this day oh he knows no
[1:31:53] longer talking about another day in the
[1:31:55] past or a day in the future but he says
[1:31:58] there's a word for this present day and
[1:32:01] he says God is waiting to find somebody
[1:32:04] it's not too unusual that they can be
[1:32:07] Anointed with the Holy Ghost he's
[1:32:10] looking for somebody that's got the
[1:32:12] anointing that can recognize the
[1:32:15] anointed that to prove that Jesus Christ
[1:32:18] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:32:22] what's proven that to the world the
[1:32:25] anointing recognizing the anointed
[1:32:28] oh when those two come together it
[1:32:31] produces the life of Jesus Christ for
[1:32:34] the Branham says because of his parents
[1:32:36] agreement his life was brought forth and
[1:32:39] he says because of God crowded though
[1:32:42] the word and the Holy Ghost he says
[1:32:44] because of their agreement the life of
[1:32:46] God is now In Your Vessel
[1:32:49] oh come on somebody because the anointed
[1:32:52] were and the anointing Has Come Together
[1:32:55] In Your Vessel is producing Jesus Christ
[1:32:58] it's no longer in word form but now it's
[1:33:02] in body form just like Jesus was word
[1:33:05] made flesh there's another body that's
[1:33:07] word made flesh that's got the same
[1:33:10] Authority the same power the same
[1:33:12] Dominion you can speak to your Mountain
[1:33:14] you can speak to the illness you can
[1:33:17] speak to that addiction oh Hallelujah
[1:33:20] and it has to happen it has to obey why
[1:33:23] the anointing and the anointed Has Come
[1:33:26] Together inside of a vessel and it's a
[1:33:29] meeting the challenge
[1:33:31] oh my cancer is challenging the
[1:33:34] Believers but there's somebody that's
[1:33:36] got enough to meet it oh my oh that's
[1:33:40] the pornography is challenging young
[1:33:42] people but they've got enough to meet it
[1:33:45] and so no devil you're not taking this
[1:33:47] vessel you may take that one you may
[1:33:49] take this one but I'm anointed I've got
[1:33:52] God living on the inside that's proven
[1:33:54] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:33:57] forever
[1:33:58] oh my brother Branham says when Christ
[1:34:00] takes over he'll Express the word right
[1:34:03] through you he's not he said not some
[1:34:05] illusion but a real genuine Christ
[1:34:08] expressing himself right through you
[1:34:11] oh my so now we find where our Authority
[1:34:15] comes from
[1:34:16] it's when the two comes together when
[1:34:19] whenever we take the word as our head as
[1:34:21] our preeminence that produces an
[1:34:24] authority that releases something just
[1:34:27] like when the when the the The
[1:34:28] Prostitute recognize Jesus they're
[1:34:31] they're released to her what she had
[1:34:33] needed they're released to her enough
[1:34:36] the figure and when the bride recognizes
[1:34:39] the anointed that releases the authority
[1:34:42] of God
[1:34:43] that releases the authority to make the
[1:34:47] Challenge from hope this this is this is
[1:34:49] just ringing out to me this evening the
[1:34:51] definition of authority is the power or
[1:34:54] right to give orders to make the
[1:34:57] decisions and enforce obedience so
[1:35:00] before the devil had authoritate over
[1:35:03] the churches throughout the church ages
[1:35:05] they would rise up with the word then
[1:35:07] they would fall into denominationalism
[1:35:09] but in this day we're not falling down
[1:35:12] in confusion but we've got the right to
[1:35:15] give orders
[1:35:17] we've got the right to make the devil
[1:35:19] obey our confession we've got the right
[1:35:22] to save Devils I'm not going in chaos
[1:35:25] I'm not meant for the tribulation you
[1:35:28] can't take my mind oh my the devil will
[1:35:31] come with complexes and say you're a
[1:35:33] nobody who will come we're with anxiety
[1:35:35] and say you're going to fall captive the
[1:35:38] fear but with this Authority you make
[1:35:40] him obey you you're no longer obeying
[1:35:43] the complexes come on somebody you're no
[1:35:46] longer obeying the fear and the anxiety
[1:35:48] but now it's got to obey you there's an
[1:35:52] authority that has come on the inside of
[1:35:54] this bride oh there's a union that has
[1:35:57] taken place the word and the bride has
[1:36:01] become one that when they become one
[1:36:03] they've got the same name they've got
[1:36:05] the same objectives they've got the same
[1:36:07] motives and they've got the same voice
[1:36:10] they've got the same Authority oh come
[1:36:13] on somebody when me and my wife got
[1:36:15] married they didn't say I know I
[1:36:17] introduced to you Loretta Mast and Josh

[1:37:50] started to respond and she said that's
[1:37:53] nothing but the truth and that anointing
[1:37:55] didn't just stay with the prophet but
[1:37:59] the same power the spoken word the
[1:38:01] anointed word went through the vessel
[1:38:03] that recognized it
[1:38:05] oh come on somebody that no longer was
[1:38:09] it just a prophet speaking the word but
[1:38:12] it was the pride it was a member of the
[1:38:14] Bride that had the same Authority but
[1:38:17] the Branham says she she looked at him
[1:38:19] and says what do I ask for she says that
[1:38:21] you're poor if you win a million dollars
[1:38:23] ask for it and it'll be right here if
[1:38:25] you want your your sister to be made
[1:38:27] well ask for it and she be well she
[1:38:30] stopped and she says I want my boys to
[1:38:32] be saved I want my my family to be saved
[1:38:36] and brother Branham says those boys were
[1:38:38] laughing and making fun but when that
[1:38:40] anoint should work
[1:38:41] went out of the anointing oh come on
[1:38:44] somebody she wasn't no longer the
[1:38:47] anointed word just with brother Branham
[1:38:49] but now the anointed word was inside of
[1:38:52] a little vessel and she spoke the
[1:38:54] anointed word and that word had to come
[1:38:57] to pass and those boys come and fell
[1:38:59] over her lap and wept their way to
[1:39:01] Calvary it's something about recognizing
[1:39:04] the anointed word in your mist
[1:39:07] oh Hallelujah brother Branham says the
[1:39:09] real pride of Christ takes the headship
[1:39:11] of the word he says there's many
[1:39:13] impersonations but there's only one
[1:39:15] bride of Christ that's the one he chose
[1:39:18] before the foundation of the world yeah
[1:39:21] you haven't chose me but I've chosen you
[1:39:23] I am
[1:39:25] Hallelujah you see we didn't go out
[1:39:28] looking for the message there was
[1:39:30] something on the inside when the message
[1:39:32] come looking for me it responded
[1:39:34] remember the story of the the eagle the
[1:39:37] eagle was now looking for mama mama was
[1:39:39] looking for the eagle but once the eagle
[1:39:41] came in and submits there was something
[1:39:43] to respond oh Hallelujah with no voice
[1:39:47] started to come forth oh what's the
[1:39:50] Bible say my sheep know my voice and
[1:39:52] another they will not follow what's the
[1:39:54] voice this a message it's a message that
[1:39:57] was rung out and there's something on
[1:39:58] the inside that's not following
[1:40:00] denominations it's following the voice
[1:40:03] of God
[1:40:05] oh Hallelujah and as that ego was set in
[1:40:08] that chicken pen he never found his
[1:40:09] identity but there became his identity
[1:40:12] flying across this chicken pen flying
[1:40:14] across the Barnyard as she began to cry
[1:40:17] begin to scream and he started to
[1:40:19] respond and as he started to respond
[1:40:21] that equipped him to fly out
[1:40:25] that the potential was always in that
[1:40:28] eagle to fly out but he needed something
[1:40:30] to tell him that once he responded to
[1:40:32] that voice his potential went from
[1:40:35] potential to manifestation
[1:40:38] oh Hallelujah
[1:40:41] oh this is okay this evening
[1:40:44] hey man
[1:40:45] I believe there's somebody that's coming
[1:40:47] under the headship of the word brother
[1:40:48] Branham says now through this headship
[1:40:50] we have the answer to the devil's
[1:40:53] question
[1:40:54] we have the answer he says he said God
[1:40:57] has Vindicated himself today through his
[1:41:00] pride with the headship
[1:41:02] so you want to see God Vindicated in
[1:41:04] your life you got to take the headship
[1:41:06] of the word you got to let the word have
[1:41:08] preeminence over every opinion over
[1:41:11] every idea then wrap their releases this
[1:41:14] Authority brother Branham says that's
[1:41:17] the reason when a man dropped dead in
[1:41:19] his meetings that he could give back his
[1:41:21] life he says because there's an
[1:41:23] authority in this headship he says this
[1:41:26] is the reason when he was in Mexico and
[1:41:28] the little boy was dead for 15 hours and
[1:41:31] he caught back his life he says brother
[1:41:33] Brandon said it wasn't those people it
[1:41:35] was the headship of God
[1:41:38] there's nothing we can do it's us
[1:41:40] responding and taking the headship
[1:41:44] Hallelujah brother Branham says what is
[1:41:47] it not them people the headship and the
[1:41:50] body has become the headship and the
[1:41:51] body has become one unit it's the god
[1:41:54] manifested in his people that's the
[1:41:57] reason the husband and wife is no longer
[1:41:59] Twain they're one God in his church is
[1:42:02] one Christ in you God's Great Revelation
[1:42:05] glory to God even bearing his name his
[1:42:09] name is Jesus the anointed the reason is
[1:42:12] called Jesus he is the anointed it's the
[1:42:15] anointed Body of Christ proven
[1:42:17] manifesting God like that body did oh my
[1:42:21] so he says there's another anointed body
[1:42:23] on Earth it ain't the physical body of
[1:42:26] Jesus Christ but there's a body on Earth
[1:42:28] doing the same signs that that body did
[1:42:31] it's the same anointing with the same
[1:42:34] anointed as the musicians come
[1:42:37] oh my brother Branham would say
[1:42:40] that if if I could get the world to see
[1:42:43] that why there you are there is the body
[1:42:46] of Christ Living standing redeemed
[1:42:49] redeemed oh my justified in His science
[1:42:52] why are we Justified we are his victory
[1:42:55] the church is his victory we come forth
[1:42:59] in the last day with this glorious
[1:43:01] gospel showing his victory he died for
[1:43:04] this purpose and we are proof of his
[1:43:07] victory we're proof of his victory you
[1:43:11] want to see Jesus Christ the same
[1:43:13] yesterday today and forever look at your
[1:43:15] neighbor look at the one that's
[1:43:17] recognized the anointed and you will see

[1:54:37] we must keep our head up lifted up
[1:54:40] expecting him to come any moment any
[1:54:43] moment can you say Amen they're they're
[1:54:46] prophesying Doom and Gloom the economy
[1:54:50] everything is just in an uproar I uh
[1:54:53] Daniel had sent me what they had said
[1:54:55] today or sometime on the news that uh
[1:54:59] tomorrow
[1:55:01] is our deadline for the debt limit
[1:55:04] something to that effect

[1:55:09] and they said well what if something
[1:55:11] don't happen I mean she faults on her
[1:55:14] payments
[1:55:15] and they said it'll be a great financial
[1:55:17] catastrophe
[1:55:19] and I'm thinking well you know the
[1:55:21] prophet's already told us we're bankrupt
[1:55:23] amen and so we we're not looking for the
[1:55:26] materialistic things we've been looking
[1:55:29] in the mirror of his word through a
[1:55:31] prophet and we found out there's a
[1:55:33] greater land I've got a greater purpose
[1:55:36] than just to be an American
[1:55:37] amen and so keep your head up your
[1:55:40] Redemption draweth nigh can you say amen
[1:55:43] God bless you sure love you appreciate
[1:55:46] you we're going to uh those that would

[1:55:56] come
[1:55:57] uh I think there's nachos and and
[1:56:01] whatever else we have there and so if
[1:56:04] you'd like to come and and visit uh we
[1:56:08] we would sure be honored to have you and
[1:56:12] remember service
[1:56:14] um seven o'clock or 11 o'clock Sunday
[1:56:17] and just be praying that God would just
[1:56:20] move in a special way
[1:56:22] amen and next week we're going to get
[1:56:25] our tent
[1:56:27] a few of his brothers were going to to
[1:56:30] pick up the tent there in Oklahoma it's
[1:56:33] going to be a fast trip but we're
[1:56:35] excited about it and and
[1:56:38] people's just calling all around and um
[1:56:43] looking forward to the meeting and so
[1:56:46] we've got a lot to be looking forward to
[1:56:49] praying about and we just really want
[1:56:51] the Lord this could be our last meeting
[1:56:53] that we have you know if the Lord would
[1:56:56] come which would be fine with me but I
[1:56:59] just pray that God will just move maybe
[1:57:01] one more Soul one more soul
[1:57:03] amen that's that's what I'm looking for
[1:57:05] I just believe that God's still safe
[1:57:07] Souls I believe that I am thinking of uh
[1:57:13] there in Pawnee uh and I won't keep you
[1:57:16] but a a family move from New York
[1:57:20] to Cleveland Oklahoma all that's been
[1:57:24] there in round Pony it ain't nothing
[1:57:27] there I'm
[1:57:28] it's small and
[1:57:32] and so they moved from New York City to
[1:57:35] Cleveland they they wanted to get away
[1:57:38] from the city they're Pentecostal people
[1:57:41] and that didn't believe in Holiness and
[1:57:44] things like that never heard of the
[1:57:46] message but they they had the choice
[1:57:48] either to move to Texas or there and
[1:57:49] they moved there
[1:57:51] and what's amazing is is another brother
[1:57:54] from Seattle he moved his family to Paul
[1:57:58] me a year or so ago and and somehow he
[1:58:03] met up with that family and he invited
[1:58:06] them to church they had been looking
[1:58:08] they'd been in Cleveland for two years
[1:58:10] or so looking and just wasn't satisfied
[1:58:13] with nothing as far as the church and so
[1:58:16] they they they ended up coming and they
[1:58:19] came to the meeting
[1:58:21] and I
[1:58:24] they told Brother Wayne
[1:58:26] when he was preaching they told him says
[1:58:28] we about walked out on you three times
[1:58:31] and he said but every time we got ready
[1:58:35] to walk out you had magnified Jesus
[1:58:37] Christ so much
[1:58:38] that we had to say this has got to be
[1:58:40] right and what he's saying
[1:58:43] and so they they had been coming you
[1:58:47] know uh just periodically they're just
[1:58:50] really enjoying and uh uh I don't know
[1:58:53] if you my cousin Joe and his wife
[1:58:56] Stephanie I think brother Wendell had
[1:58:58] mentioned about their lives druggies I
[1:59:01] mean it's a scarred past and they ended
[1:59:04] up homeless and God got a hold of both
[1:59:08] of them she was on drugs I think she had
[1:59:11] been given
[1:59:13] cocaine or marijuana on her 16th
[1:59:15] birthday I think 14th birthday and she
[1:59:18] was hooked on all these things but God
[1:59:21] done a work so they began to talk to
[1:59:23] these this family what what God done for
[1:59:26] them and my cousin gave him three books
[1:59:29] to read serpent seed marriage and
[1:59:32] divorce and another one and said you
[1:59:36] will really enjoy this and so he uh he
[1:59:40] apparently read them and he told he told
[1:59:43] window says I got questions about these
[1:59:46] things and so he was able to have a
[1:59:51] meeting with him and at their house and
[1:59:53] have them over and begin to talk to them
[1:59:55] and they both just just wept and wept
[1:59:59] and they they said why why doesn't no
[2:00:01] one know about this why doesn't no one
[2:00:03] know he said it's predestinations they
[2:00:05] didn't know anything about
[2:00:06] predestination so he went through the
[2:00:08] Bible he said man the man jumped up ran
[2:00:11] him through the house hands lifted up
[2:00:13] just a ball and thank God I've been
[2:00:15] predestinated amen and and you know I
[2:00:19] just believe there's still somebody out
[2:00:20] there that we can reach can you say amen

[2:00:29] brings back the backslider or brings
[2:00:32] back a new or brings a new one in it'll
[2:00:34] all be worth it over there can you say
[2:00:36] man so God bless you as our prayer amen

[2:00:43] just bow our heads in a word of prayer
