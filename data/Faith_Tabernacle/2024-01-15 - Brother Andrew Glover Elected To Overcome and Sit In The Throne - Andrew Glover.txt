of Revelation but just before we read this morning let's just bow our hearts together and how many would just join your faith with me and invite him to come and be the speaker here among us today amen Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here on this Resurrection Sunday father Lord on the calendar this morning it does not say Easter but Lord in our hearts it screams Out Easter father Lord we don't serve you based on a day on the calendar of Easter but Lord your Prophet said to the believer every day is Easter so father we're here this morning honoring your Resurrection for Lord we know that you were born we know the Miracles you done we know the life that you lived the things you overcame and Lord we know that you went to the cross and you died for us but Lord our hearts Rejoice this morning that you not only died for us but you Rose again and Lord you're here this morning to manifest every promise that you died that we could have access to so father we're inviting you come once again in these meetings as you've moved Lord so mightily Among Us oh God and father I pray that your spirit Lord would come this morning and break the chains of the enemy father may you deliver hearts and Minds may you give us those things which you would have for us oh god father I pray you touch those that are sick and body I pray Lord that you would heal those that are not feeling well oh God for Lord as I heard your Prophet say you came that we would have life and have it more abundantly Lord you never intended for your children to suffer oh God so father May the sufferer May the suffering cease this morning I pray and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen in John 16 33 Jesus here speaking he says these things have I spoken unto you in me in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation so he's separating him from the world so in him you'll have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer now that's something to say right after he tells you you're going to have tribulation but be of good cheer now here's why I have overcome the world but be of good cheer I have overcome the world now in the Book of Romans the 9th chapter The Book of Romans the 9th chapter and in the fourth verse Paul here uh speaking in Romans chapter sorry Romans chapter 9 and verse4 we'll get it straight here in a minute Romans chapter 9 and verse 4en the Bible here says who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption how many believes in adoption who pertaineth to the adoption and the glory and the Covenant and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises whose are the fathers and whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed forever amen not as though the word of God had taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seat be called that is they which are the children of Flesh these are not the children of God but the children of Promise are counted for the seed amen I'm I'm thankful for that seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac now I love verse 11 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand that it's not of works but of him that calleth so the purpose of God stands in election now in one other place in Revelation 3 Revelation CH 3 and verse number 21 Revelation 3 and verse 21 this morning I want to trust the Lord will help us to bring these thoughts together in Revelation 3:21 now brother Bram brother Bram brings this down and says he's not speaking to the whole age he's speaking to the individual to him that overcometh I can put my name right there and you can put your name right there to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here today amen I want to take for a title this morning for just a few moments if the Lord would help me I want to speak to you on elected to overcome and sit in the throne amen I want to make that a very clear declaration to you this morning that you have have been elected to overcome and to set in the throne in 1 John 2:13 he said I write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning he says I write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children because you have known the father verse 14 he said I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning he said I have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of God abideth in you and ye shall or ye have rather overcome the wicked one now here in John 16:33 Jesus was saying tribulation will be in the world but be of good peace be of good cheer and he says for I have overcome the world here John is writing and saying now look amen be of good cheer in other words you're strong young men amen and you have overcome so amen the same one that overcome in John 16:33 is now the same one anointing John in 1 John 2 Amen to say that there's going to be some more Overcomers that are going to overcome the same way he overcame and the way he overcame was by the word now brother said in the message how can I overcome he said I chose this because I think that it's a Time amen that we should never let the spirit of Revival die now we're in the spirit of Revival right now amen but but just just give it a few days and the devil is going to do everything he can Amen to take that Revival out of our hearts but we've got to stay in the spirit of Revival constantly revived every day and we have to do that and the way we do that is we die daily amen that Christ should live so the way that we keep the spirit of Revival is we die daily so that he has already overcome amen can continue to overcome in us another place he said I begin to think of this text then it means over come means to keep life in you and when life went out brother talks about that log he said that's what brought the log in that condition amen was when the life went out now you remember he said that log was laying there and he said as long as life was on it he said you could step on it he said you could push it around he said anything you could do to it would not affect it as long as there was life in it amen but when the life went out when he stepped on it it got Doty amen and it give away now there's a beautiful lesson in there amen that as long as you're in the spirit of Revival amen it does not matter what happens to you as long as life is in you it does not matter what comes your way there is something in you amen that is greater than what's trying to come upon you amen and it'll push you through it now now let me say it like this sometimes amen people get all troubled and all bothered about this and bothered about that and bothered about this situation Amen in all reality the problem is amen that life has gone out of them amen because there was a time that those things didn't bother them there was a time amen that the way somebody looked at them didn't bother them there was a time the way somebody talked about him didn't bother him amen but when life went out they become susceptible Amen to everything the devil sent their way amen but there is a bride on the Earth today amen who is not falling susceptible Amen to every criticism to every look Amen to every negative thought because they know who they are amen and we might as well say it it does not matter what you heard about us what you think about us amen if we know who we are what you think about us what you heard about us amen does not change our identification we know who we are we know where we come from we know where we're standing and we know where we are going we are not going down we are not going back we are going forward we are anointed and elected to overcome by the word of God as I was reading a quote last night if it's okay I want to pick it up there again in the Mage Faith he said here I am standing here just shielding myself and the Holy Spirit to moveing now this is what you call amen Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen but remember now Satan's always a skeptic amen at the sons of God how many sons of God do we have here today amen at the sons of God see you know he always does that someone with a skeptic idea and when they do that amen just he's trying to interfere amen but Christians always overcome amen I think that's something we ought to put on everything we got amen that Christians always overcome now in the message how I can overcome brother said did you notice amen the arrangements of that amen see sat with me in my Throne amen not on my throne but in my Throne see amen that is his domain see and now as Christ is the ruler through the ruler at this time amen Throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God Amen so will the church be with him the bride will be with him in his throne in the entire domain see not on my throne but in my Throne are you with me amen not on my throne but in my Throne see where his domain reaches amen a throne is over a domain and a domain reaches just as far as its boundaries does amen and this is from eternity to Eternity Amen to him that overcometh will I grant you sit with me in my Throne as he also overcame and him sat down with his father in his throne now brother BR says it like this as Believers amen we have a Dominion in Romans 6:14 Paul said amen that sin shall not have dominion over you amen for ye are not under the law amen but you are under grace in the church age book he says our Dominion is the dominion over sin and it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of Christ amen that indwells us amen so our Dominion is over sin and the way we force that Dominion into effect is by the spirit of Christ that is dwelling in US amen every Kingdom on Earth is going to be tored down amen but ours will remain forever amen I think the scripture speaks of us amen not as just being church members amen but it's being of Kings amen and Priests under God Amen now can I say this you are Kings in the present amen as well as you are Kings in the future in Revelation 1 15 from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us amen and washed us from our sins in his own blood amen now watch this and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God Amen and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen brother said now watch those four words he ha made us he said there are certain truths amen that we need to emphasize amen and this is one of them amen now when a prophet says amen there's something to emphasize amen then we ought to emphasize it and he said he hath made us amen salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings We Are Spiritual Kings amen oh we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne amen but now we are spiritual Kings amen and we are reigning over a spiritual Kingdom amen Romans 5:17 for If by one man's offense death reain by one amen then much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life amen by one and that is Jesus Christ in Colossians 1:13 the Bible says who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom and that word Kingdom means the Reign amen of his dear son that I want to say this morning there is a bride on the earth who is not waiting to die and go to heaven Amen to become an overcomer amen but right here this morning you are spiritual Kings You Are Spiritual priest and you are already reigning in Dominion amen over the devil oh come on church over sin over the world over the Flesh and the devil amen and you are showing forth his praise and glory you are showing forth himself amen for it is Christ in US amen it is Christ in us who is willing and doing of his good pleasure amen yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now can I say this this is the age of the Overcomer we're not looking for the age we're in the age of the Overcomer the prophet of God said in adoption part one he said Canan does not represent the age of the Millennium it only represents the age of the Overcomer amen how many Overcomers have I got here this morning amen that Canaan only represents the age of the over Overcomer what is it it's the dispensation of overcoming now amen if it's okay we'll have a little church here this morning amen somebody's going to overcome somebody's going to overcome the world somebody's going to overcome sin somebody's going to overcome the flesh somebody's going to overcome the devil amen somebody's going to overcome leosia somebody's going to overcome sickness somebody's going to overcome amen 200,000,000 Devils that have been released from the river of youup Fates well listen I'm not looking for those Overcomers I'm looking at those Overcomers you are the Overcomers of the Book of Revelation amen they overcome the Devil by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony amen now we might as well preach since we here amen I know people talk about the Rapture and the resurrection and oh what a great homecoming day is going to be and they can't even overcome right now and make it to the house of God they can't overcome the way they feel and praise God anyhow they can't overcome what somebody thinks about them and what somebody said about them listen if I let what everybody thought about me said about me thought I did amen I'd never preach again amen but here's the reality I know who I am and the word has identified me as a part of the seed of God who will overcome this age so if I'm going to overcome the devil I'm going to overcome my feelings I'm going to overcome my emotions I'm going to overcome criticism and so will you because you are elected to overcome and sit in the throne in a spiritual Dominion now and there now so many promises have been laid in the future you all know that so many so many well we might as well say Catholicism Devils is that okay sister Jane Catholicism Devils have laid these promises in the future healings in the future deliverances in the future amen but here's a prophet saying no we don't need Divine Healing in the Millennium we don't need Deliverance in the future we need it right now I know some people they're waiting Amen on someday to start fighting amen but here's what a prophet said he said Now's the Time where we have to fight now is the time where we have to fight Amen to win the battle and to overcome the things of the world he said and there well there won't be any fight there see amen the last prayer will be made there won't be no prayer meetings there'll be no place for the people to get saved there'll be no sickness to be healed it'll just be one great glorious thing amen and what we could as human beings this morning what could we promise what could we look at anything that would be any greater than looking to the promise of that time so we're looking at the promise of that time can I say this we are living in a special time amen and the time that we're living in is what a prophet would call adoption time now you know that Paul very plainly speaks amen of the adoption in Romans 8 he says in the 14th verse amen for as many as are led by the spirit of God Amen they are the sons of God in verse number 15 he said you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption amen whereby we cry Abby father in The God Who is rich in Mercy he said I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine amen but to straighten it out amen it was already mixed up amen so here's a prophet straightening it out and says that you might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are listen you're not going to be amen but now you are the sons of God Amen see you always were the sons of God Amen how was I a Son of God Amen you was a Son of God by the seed of God and Paul said amen that the election pertaineth unto the ad adopted who are a part of the seed of God and the prophet said you're already his amen by predestination amen the seed has come to life amen how do you overcome you overcome by keeping life in you amen and what is in you is the seed of God and he is the seat of life amen listen there's 900 denominations and they're dead this morning but here's a little group of people amen that's got life in them amen because the seed of God was deposited into their soul from before the foundation of the world Amen the seed has come to life and no world can get in amen that's powerful brother Terry the seed has come to life and no world can get in see Christ and his alone already finished amen the seed was there I love that you didn't receive the seed at the altar the seed was there the seed was already amen when was it put there big question a lot of people's ask amen when was it put there he said before the foundation of the world Amen has predestinated us unto eternal life amen see so the seed amen is not in our head amen but the seed of life is in our heart amen so this adoption is not intellectual It's Supernatural you will not learn your way into this adoption you will not study your way in this adoption you will not memor I quotes in scriptures to get into this adoption amen this adoption comes by The Sovereign Grace and the election of almighty God Amen listen what the prophet said he said we today amen are God's spiritual church with a spiritual law that is written on the table of our hearts and we are LED in a spiritual form can I break that down we're a spiritual church we're operating under a spiritual law amen now watch this and that law is written written Amen in the tables of our heart but then he says and we are LED in a spiritual form amen then what is our leadership amen our leadership is the same Pillar of Fire that led Moses and led Paul and led brother Brandon is here leading the church now how many can I can I can I get a witness here that's not ashamed to say I'm a follower of the pillar of fire I am a I am a I am a thoroughly identified follower of the pillar of fire in the AG living in well can I tell you what the prophet said he said people who follow the pillar of fire will certainly have a rough time amen but they'll be ready for the translation at that time amen that's right they'll just be ready to go in other words amen the pillar of fire in you amen that brother Wayne spoke about put your foot on it the pillar of fire that's in you amen is the same Pillar of Fire it said tribulation will be in the world and but listen I'll give you peace amen and be of good cheer I have already overcome the world now right now there's a there's a lot between us and the Rapture there's a lot of pressures there's a lot of Trials there's a lot of situations there's a lot of ill feelings and weird feelings and weirdness y'all know what I'm talking about amen what can I preach here I don't know about y'all but I about reach my I about to reach my limit of weirdness amen I'm about tired of weirdness amen this is weird that's weird this is amen come on whatever happen to just being a normal amen come on now amen well if you look at this person that's weird and this person did that so that's weird amen have we forgot that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we are one body with one motive with one objective and that is to see Souls amen Born Into the kingdom of God I think we ought to get rid of all the weirdness what can I preach those somebody the other day I said I ain't seen so much weirdness since fifth grade on the playground well who are you friends with who are you hanging out with amen let's get away from all that and let's get back to following the pillar of fire and letting the spirit of God lead his church in a spiritual form with an anointing behind it amen that'll break the Yoke of the enemy and'll bring a power among the church amen it's going to be hard but if you'll follow the pillar of fire you will be ready for the translation at that time Paul picks it up in Romans 8:16 and says the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God not we were or we will be we are and if children then heirs and Heirs of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together amen so if you can suffer with him if you can stay under the pillar of fire you're going to have a rough time but you're going to be ready for the translation at that time for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US amen how many says Lord Reveal Your Glory in my life amen now the prophet of God said his glory is his word right and the message thingss are to be he said the church is growing each age it's allotted in the scripture here amen so God through the holy spirit amen Reveals His word by manifesting it and vindicating it his s amen showing that it's his word being brought to pass in the day that it's promised now that's a powerful quote church that God through this Holy Spirit Reveals His word by manifesting it and vindicating it hisself showing that it's his word being brought to pass in the day that it's promised so we are living then in the season amen where we are moving from just expectation into manifestation we're no longer just Gathering and saying I expect I expect I expect amen now we heard it on Monday nights Amen to expect great things amen expect great things well can I say this here we are seven days later amen and I'll say this we're not here saying expect great things expect great things God's going to do great things this week come on now amen we're not under a Pentecostal anointing where everything's built on expectation expect expect amen no we're under a bride anointing where we preach expectation but then we preach the same anointing that gives the expectation has the ability to give the manifestation and right here this week we have seen expectations transformed into manifestation we have seen people healed we have seen people delivered we have seen people restored we have seen people refreshed we have seen people renewed oh I know the devil's fighting on every hand amen but we ain't laying our sword down and we ain't taking back water we're going to keep on preaching we're going to keep on worshiping we're going to Keep On Believing because we are Overcomers and Overcomers keep life in them are you hearing me our expectations has become manifestation in Romans 8:19 Paul said for the earnest expectation of the creature amen waited for what for the manifestation of the sons of God and Satan is always a skeptic of the sons of God but Christians always overcome look at this word manifestation it means to be revealed so he's waiting on the revealing of the sons of God in the last days now can I give you some quotes from the adoption series paragraph 47 adoption part two he said now and in the Bible we are living in the last days amen at the top of the pyramid the cross fish of the cancer age in the Zodiac in the time of the coming of the Leo the line in the camping Stone Amen in the days of the manifestation of the sons of God in the Bible see where we're at we're right at the end time adoption part three he said but this is the day amen are you are you watching the prophet he's saying we're coming that day but then he turns and says but this is the day of the manifestation of the sons of God when the Myster that's been hid since the foundation of the world is to be made known amen this is the hour now come on Church in in adoption part four he said now this may just choke you to death but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur Gods how many how many ever know that how many knows Jesus said so see did you hear the law that self said you are gods and if you call them Gods which God said in Genesis 2 that they were gods because they F they had a full domain over the Dominion of the world he give him dominion over all things he lost his godship he lost his sunship he lost his domain amen and Satan took it over now don't get mad at me but that's why the devil wants us to stay amen a bunch of a bunch of Pentecostal babies amen that's trying to shout and trying to speak in tongues and trying to dance amen because he knows if the Bride Comes to the revelation of the adoption am then he said then Satan knows amen that we'll walk out in the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full Son of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out and take every Power that Satan's got away from him amen and take it back to him oh Church of the Living God you are the adopted sons who have been chosen for this generation I believe in shouting and dancing and I'll shout right with you amen but let's get some some substance to shout about and what we're shouting about is the adoption anointing has come back to the sons of God and there is an authority to walk out and look in the devil square in the face and say take your hands off my church take your hands off my baby take your hands off my family listen you're not a bunch of weak beat down weaking you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and there is an anointing in you to take Satan's power away from him are you hearing me we're not at the bottom we're not even halfway up the pyramid we're not even brother brother Shi can I say it like this we're not even at the near the top we have come to the top we have come to the top and the prophet said go right back to Genesis to the original what is it now the world and nature is groaning they're crying everything's moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons amen born sons and field Sons amen will speak and their word is back true Sons born Sons filled Sons I was preaching one time up at brother brother Bonte WS up in Minnesota and I was preaching on this quote brother Terry I said when true Sons born Sons filled Sons brother Bon stood up he said speak Sons amen when true Sons when born Sons when filled Sons will speak and their word is back I believe we're on the border of it now Church of the Living God if we was on the border in 1960 then I must be looking at the people who has got citizenship in the land of spoken word they have got Authority in the land of spoken word they're not on the border come on Church we're not on the border of the spoken word we're not on the border of the third pull we are not on the border of all the promises of God we have stepped over the border and we are living in a land where there's a power where there's an authority where there's a strength where there's an anointing to move from one promise into another promise into another promise well I feel a spirit of Caleb on me this morning amen give me my Mountain I'm taking my mountain in the promised land everything that God has promised me ain't no devil going to stop me ain't no Spirit going to bind me everything God said I can have I'm going to have it I'm going to enjoy it are you hearing me amen what for the manifestation he said yes sir you say to this mountain let it be so brother I desire so and so a certain thing done I'm a Believer in God I give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ there's a manifestation oh brother my crops are burning up yonder I haven't had any rain I'll send you a rain in the name of the Lord God bless your crop am been waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God are y'all ready for this that God ordained at the beginning so you didn't just get ordained in this meeting you didn't just get ordained when you heard the first tape you didn't just get ordained when you read the first book you was ordained at the beginning come on all the way back in the back part of God's mind before the Ephesian age before the Samarian age before the can I say it like this before the fall in the garden in the mind of God you had repres presentation as an attribute of God Amen as a part of the election of God and the devil's done everything he can to interfere with the election of God with the power of God but here this morning there's some born Sons there's some filled Sons there's some true sons that are speaking to the mountain and the mountain is moving they're speaking to the tree and the tree is withering amen why because it's the season of the manifestation of the sons of God now you go read Matthew 21 and there was an expectation for the manifestation of the Son of God which s so in PL or singular only one but when you go to Romans 8 it moves from expectation of manifestation of son Amen to Sons amen plural which means there will be more than one doing the same thing yeah in the days of Jesus there was only one that was speaking to the tree there was only one that was speaking to the water there was only one that was speaking to the form amen but in the last days when true sons and born sons and filled Sons will come to their original position by the adoption message there will be a many membered body will be manifesting the power of God all over this world now there's some people they get in their mind that we can't really believe these things because he's not here in a Corporal body can I say what I believe I believe what a prophet taught that Jesus has a Corporal body and he will return again someday in a Corporal body but can I say what he said that's in the future so if you let some devil tell you that you got to wait on the Corporal body then all you're going to be doing is going to church singing some songs preaching a few sermons and just living life as normal but if you can see that there is a Divine present tense promise of Jesus Christ being here now in the form of the Holy Ghost amen not in the Pew not in the pull pits not in the music amen not in the carpet but in the flesh of his adopted elected bride now let me just say what he said here it's a lengthy quote but give me some Grace he is the faithful and true witness right now we think of that word witness amen Jesus was a faithful martyr and the Holy Ghost is the witness to that amen see the spirit Bears record that amen the world hated Jesus so it killed him but God loved him and he went to the father see and the proof of that he went to the father is that the Holy Ghost came so the very evidence he went to the father amen is the evidence the Holy Ghost has come if Jesus had not been received of the father then the spirit would not have come now watch in John 16711 you can read it when you get time he says see there the presence of the holy spirit amen in this world instead of Jesus being here can I say it to you amen be of good cheer there'll be tribulation in the world Amen but I will give you peace amen for I have already over come and have gone to my father in other words the god you're servant went through the same things you're going through he faced the same situation you're facing but he was received into heaven amen and is sited at the right hand of the father and he released his Spirit to come into the church amen and to prove that Jesus was the righteous amen he was the son of God and watch what he said I will not leave you comfortless come on but I will come to you see he sent the comforter he was the comforter and he came back in spirit somebody say Spirit up on the true church he is the faithful and true witness in the midst of the church in the midst of the church but one day he's going to come back in flesh again so there we have it there will be a Corporal body return He will prove then who is the only wise potentate is he Jesus Christ the lord of glory amen now you say brother Andrew well that's in the future amen but you're saying amen this is a present tense message well let's say what a prophet said my Ministry is differeny my Ministry is to declare him that he is here Amen brother singer my Ministry is to declare him that he is here a prophet was not just declaring his own ability to preach the word or to tie the scriptures together or to speak for Mysteries that had been hid since the foundation of the world but a prophet's obligation was to declare that there is an appearing of the lord and there is a coming of the Lord and this is the the scriptural appearing of Jesus Christ amen he is here I think we ought to climb up on every Pulpit we ought to scream at from every church we ought to scream at from every meeting we ought to scream at every service he is here the Mighty God the only wise God is here he is here he is here well somebody ought to shout it right now he is here he is here I did a study one time on that cuz we say he's here then if he's here he must be here on purpose and his purpose of being here is to save he said it's to heal he said it's to Del he said is to reveal himself as Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now if he is here present tense if he is present tense here then where is he if he's here present tense where is he church amen is he in our is he in the piano is he in this wood is he in them flowers is he in that carpet is he in that cushion seat listen what a prophet said he said the lamb was one creature and the dove was another creature but when the Dove and the lamb United together God was manifested in the flesh that's right and now oh God somebody say now and now he's manifested in your flesh by being adopted sons and daughters in the kingdom of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's right and you become joint Arabs with the Lord Jesus Christ oh church you've got the power if you got the faith to use it with we are not waiting on power we are not waiting on Revelation we are not waiting on a message we are in possession we're in the possession of it now let me say this to you we are not just hirs with God according to Paul we are joint HS with Christ Jesus amen we are we we are Heirs of God but we are also joint airs with Christ Jesus in other words amen if me brother Jordan brother Landon were all Brothers In the Flesh natural Brothers it was all Brothers In the Flesh amen and our daddy died amen so there's a wheel going to be read so we're all brothers so that means we're all heirs so we all go to the reading of the wheel and the the testator comes out he breaks the seals and he begins to read the wheel and he says Jordan Robinson stand up I don't know it's going to be Robinson or Glover amen he says stand up amen and there he looks at you and he says your Daddy has left you a mansion on the on on West Palm Beach it's got a yach it's got everything you want and the value of that's $2.5 million woo brother you think he going to be sitting there like a bump on the pickle he got something you know he man I got a yard I got a mansion it's worth $2.5 million he says Landon amen stand up your father's past and he's left you a brand new Corvette brand new right out of the factory it's got everything you want on it amen he says Andrew stand up you know and I stand up and he says he left you a goat well we're heirs right we're all heirs so that means by being Heir we must get something but here's the problem it's obvious he loved them more than he loved me they got a mansion they got a cam or Corvette I got a goat are you hearing me but if we're join AES on come on church if we're join AES that means whatever he got is what I got and whatever I got is what they got in other words if we're join airs we all get the same thing so one is not going to get more than somebody else we're all going to get the same thing from the same father Oh Glory to God and there is a bride here today who is not just an heir of God she is a joint air with Jesus Christ and everything Paul got everything Peter got everything the apostles got everything brother brandom got is what this bride has fallen air too we get the same thing we get the same Holy Ghost we get the same anointing we get the same revelation we get the same inspiration we get the same power we're join AES in other words God has made us join AES by identifying himself in our flesh oh God if the world could only see that that God and man are one not going to be our the super sign was that first man that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church the super sign God and man together that was to be the Super sign of the last day are y'all hearing me when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days now can I say this the only thing we are waiting for then is the fullness of adoption which is the changing of our bodies amen Paul said to whom pertaineth the adoption he comes in Galatians 4 for and said when the fullness of time was come amen God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons not will be might be you are Sons amen God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts and he is crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then you are an heir of God through Christ in Ephesians 1:5 Paul says very beautiful he says having predestinated us unto the adoption of the children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now adoption part two he says what is adoption your can can we just say what he said your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing when you were born again John 1 I believe we're born of the spirit of God we are sons of God but we were pre be destinated unto the adoption now here's what I'm trying to get to you for this son to the last day see now this is what hurts Pentecostal little they say I got born again praise the Lord got the Holy Ghost fine you're a child of God but that ain't what I'm talking about you were predestinated unto adoption and adoption is placed in a son so can I say this election goes with the adoption which positionally places you in your position so without the election there will be no adoption and without the adoption there will be no positionally placing in your position Paul said it like this that the purpose of God according to election might stand he said in in Romans 11:28 touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake 1 Thessalonians 1:4 knowing Brethren beloved your election of God in 1 Peter 1:10 so sorry 2 Peter 1:10 wherefore rather the Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall I love that word election it is the act of picking out it is used of the act of God's Free Will which before the foundation of the world he decreed His blessings to certain persons so he didn't just throw it out there and Scatter it to whosoever will he decreed His blessings to certain persons and the decree made from Choice by which he determined to bless certain persons through Christ amen by Grace amen you are a chosen person listen friends if you're not in the election then you're not in the line of all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured in the church if you're going to be a recipient of the fullness of the godhead bodily you have got to be in the mind of God eternally as a seed of God waiting for the quickening power of the Holy Ghost Amen to Quicken you and to positionally place you in the age of the Overcomer how many believes in predestination how many believes in for ordination how many believes in election sure see if you believe the Bible you have to if you believe the Bible you have to believe in predestination if you believe the Bible you have to believe in for ordination if you believe the Bible you have to believe in the election of God because the only people brother Terry who is going to receive the mind of God is those who was in the mind of God in the season when the entire Bible will be revealed in the sons of the last day remember said God in his infinite grace by his election and for knowledge set these things in order and every will works just right I like that he said I would be a discouraged man this morning if I didn't believe in the election and the calling of God can I say this to you the Rapture is only for the elect the Rapture is only for the elect amen that's why brother R says amen there was a mechanic one day he was trying to start the car are you with me because the election is setting things in order adoption is setting things in order amen and listen we're not a bunch of confused people amen following this and following that and seeking after that amen we have got a Direction Church the mechanic was trying to start the car remember brother Billy was trying to start the car and he couldn't get it together and brother said this man walks out of the he walks out of the store or whatever and he's got a real nice suit on and he walks over there and that mechanic's working away you know he looks he looks like a good Pentecost I mean he looks like a good mechanic you know he's got the grease on his hands he's got the dirt on his clothes he's working real hard you know he's trying to get it done you know he's working I got a Time amen and all of a sudden adoption I mean the chief walks over and he looks at him and he says what are you trying to do he said I'm trying to start the car he said okay well you take this wire Tire to that wire and it'll fire up I love the words brother Terry that brother Ram uses he said and the man had sense enough to listen to him and so what he done was he tied the wires together amen he got in the car and the car fired up and he said in here in the last days the Pentecostals is trying to get a people in The Bride they're shouting them every service they're working them every service they're trying to pump them every service but here come the seventh angel under the chief designer and he walked in the church and he said get your house in order apply the token kick out sin get the Holy Ghost catch the Revelation it's not rapturing works it's rapturing Grace and there is a bride this morning who is in position by the word of adoption to change her body in the moment in the twinkle of an eye how are we going to get it off the ground the chief has got to come Among Us he knows what it takes to get the car going come on he knows the chief designer knows what it takes to put the church in Rapture order he designed it can I say this to you this is irreversible election this is irreversible election some of y'all been letting the devil wear you out that you're going to miss it if you have got a revelation in your soul that your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world that is more than an idea that is more than a Doctrine to you that is more than a note on your notebook but that is a spiritual Revelation in the depths of of your soul that my name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world Amen and it was put there with his own blood if that is a revelation to your soul amen there's nothing you can do to get away from that claim there is no mistake great enough there is no sin great enough there is no bad day good day in day out day up day there is nothing good enough Amen to take your election out of the predestinated plan of God God certified your election therefore I can say with everything within me you have been elected not to fall you say well I'm going to fall how can you fall when you've been elected not to fall sister Becky I'm going to fall how you going to fall when you've been elected not to fall come on Church some of y'all think you need somebody behind you to serve God all you need is God behind you to serve god well if I had so and so this and so and so this amen you don't need so and so this and so and so that what you need is a revelation and I am a part of God I was in the mind of God it don't matter what you think about me it don't matter what you say about me you can ridicule me you can scandalize my name but I'm going on with Jesus just the same I am a part of the sons of God in the last days you are a part of that bride born by the word and hell can't defeat you the grave Can't Hold You sin don't know what to do with you Satan don't know how to handle you you are the sons of God God manifested in the age you're living in oh the new birth is Christ right and it's a revelation so God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all the group together I love this when the Revelation brother Terry is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same action the same things he did amen making the word manifest oh if the church only knew it position if the church only knew its position if there was only a chief designer among us if there was only somebody who could put it in order and here shows up the pillar of fire and says here's the way it is amen and when the church comes in order the Rapture will go when it knows what it is can I say we've changed dispensations at Christmas we look at God With Us amen at God above us amen at Christmas we look at God With Us amen at Easter we look at God With Us amen but the prophet of God said this Holy Ghost dispensation come in and continued on and will continue on by the administration of the angels to the church truly but they ordained spirits of God sent from God to carry the things out every man was a special calling back All Through the Ages angels has visited men not a worship of angels amen but a testimony see that right it'll declare God it won't have some kind of mythical something that no one understands are y'all hearing me if it's an angel from God it will not have some mythical something that no one understands in other words when you ask somebody what they believe some y'all know what I'm talking about they won't say well uh you have to pray for it it's Revelation now there's been some moves around the message that when you really pinned him down and he said what do you guys believe oh it's a revelation well show me one quote Oh it's a revelation it's only a revelation and then there oh I'm getting in trouble now then there's been some some moves well we might as well preach for here there's been some moves and they say this well you know what amen I'm not saying it is but could it be come on but here's a prophet that's saying this is it this is it here's the understanding it's not a mythical Mind of a man it's not something so confusing no one can understand come on Church it'll speak of Jesus Christ and will testify of Jesus Christ and will produce Jesus Christ let me go on record and say this message has spoken of Jesus Christ it is testified of Jesus Christ amen and I can look at you this morning and say it has produced Jesus Christ to the people God is in his son God is in his people amen look what he done in the days of his sunship now look what he's doing here in the Holy Ghost dispensation how he raised up among the people he's showing the same signs and wonders quickening the dead is that right amen raising the dead that physically died amen raising them back to life again what do you Sayer one more he said we're living in the Holy Ghost dispensation where Christ has been glorified and the holy spirit's here come on that's what he said so be careful now and don't you judge it I'd just say nothing and walk away if you didn't believe it if you can't be a believer fell said not long go I don't care what happens I don't believe it I said it's not for unbelievers it's for believers see it's not not for unbelievers it was it intended for them can I say this as plain as I know how this adoption message of the election overcoming grace of God is only to the elect the prophet of God said that's why the message don't get the right away like it should have it's only to the elect to the church Abraham seed so in other words how many can say Lord I'm elect thank God I'm elect amen now can I say this only the elect can repent of their sins only the elect can resist the devil only the elect can receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost can I just bring it on down and only the elect can overcome only the elect can overcome can I say it to you like this we are elected to overcome in Revelation 3:21 to him that overcometh that word overcome means to carry off the victory amen now watch this it is to come off Victorious of Christ Victorious over all of his foes and of Christian that hold fast their faith even unto death against the power of their foes and temptations can somebody say Temptations and persecutions which one is arraigned or goes to law Amen to win the case and to maintain one's cause so there's a there's an overcoming to overcome the foes of the enemy to overcome the lies of the devil amen and to step into the victory of the blood of Jesus Christ amen and to win the case and to come to a complete Victory can I can I can I turn a corner here this morning amen I'm not going to preach all day but I want I want to lay this in brother preaches this message how can I overcome he preaches it in the form of a question and he says overcome means to stand the test that's right like all the old Saints did like Jesus did amidst all of his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood it in the very face of sickness and him being the Messiah he healed them in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of Calvary his own death he defeated Oh my he defeated it by surrendering himself why by the word he said you destroy this Temple but in three days I'll raise it up again amen and in the presence of death he defeated it in the presence of death he are you hearing me in the presence of death he defeated it Oh Glory to God in the presence in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell in the presence of the Grave he overcome the grave why all by the word and humility there's the real man there's the one to make your example see he defeated everything and overcome it so we now have the question how can I overcome by the word through humility you can overcome whatever is in front of you now can I say this overcome means to overcome Temptation in Hebrews 4:15 Jesus says or the Bible says of Jesus we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin now watch what he says Temptation was for him you know that he was tempted by drinking he was tempted by women he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are he was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him because overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people says there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil it's just as real as you are a real devil and you must recognize him real are you awake this morning you must recognize him real and the moment that you recognize he's real and that he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god that's in you is greater and mightier than he is that's the one that's in you has already overcome him glory to God Amen there'll be tribulation in the world there'll be Temptation in the world but there'll be peace under the believer and be of good cheer for I have already overcome the world and have taken residency in your soul by the revelation of who I am having preeminence oh you was predestinated to give preeminence to this word you were predestinated to give a life to this word you were predestinated and elected and for ordained and chosen of God to overcome leosia and to set in the throne not as the overcome as the Overcomer not as the defeated as the defeat not as the conquered as the conquered Oh Glory to God I want to say with everything that's within me hell will not conquer this bride we'll conquer hell come on church I might as well just preach I'm this close to it I don't believe I'm looking at people that's going to come out of lay out of sea by the skin of their teeth and barely holding on I believe I'm looking at some serpent bruising devil stomping Church Living God and'll overcome every devil overcome every sin overcome everything of world I'll tell you how sure I am of you by this word is an overcomer I don't believe on the day there'll be one devil be able to raise its head and say nobody could defeat me testing one two is it still working it's still working I'll tell you again how sure I am of you as a Believer by this word I do not believe on the day of rapture there'll be one devil be able to raise its head and say nobody conquered me nobody conquered me I believe every devil is going to have to bow his head and say I was conquered I think when God ask that devil who are you he'll say I'm the devil of lust and he'll say what are you he'll have to say conquered he'll say what devil are you I'm the devil of pornography I ripped in the lives of young boys and girls and tried to destroy them and defile them but I stand here today conquered come on I think cancer is going to have to bow its head I tell you how sure I am of you of this word cancer will have to bow its head and say he conquered me at Calvary he conquered me through the prophet within them Holy Ghost filled fire baptized Pillar of Fire following elected Church conquer me the same way he did well I'm this close to it it's okay that can I can I have a little liberty in preach I don't believe homosexuality will be able to raise its head and say nobody conquer me because you're looking at one preacher that's seen God come in a meeting and just a few days ago and deliver a two men sitting there of homosexuality living in the same house living a perverted lifestyle one of them raised in the message one of them not in the message amen God hooked up amen but they got to feeling something wrong they got to thinking about it amen and come in a meeting brother joshu was with me amen come in that meeting down there amen can I preach a minute come in that meeting there amen and and and I don't know how I to explain it then this I'm not crazy but this actually happened I literally felt brother Kevin a spirit just touched me just like go right across me I said I know that spirit and it's a wrong spirit I said I don't know what it is but it's a wrong Spirit there's something wrong here when when when somebody walked by me I felt that spirit amen push against me I got in the pull pit and begin to preach and I begin to tell about the soldier boy Pastor come to me afterwards he said but Andrew he said I don't know how you did it he said but I was sitting there and I knew the situation I knew what was going on he said I knew what you was preaching he said I knew you was either going to break it or it was going to break them amen can I say this when that service was over them boys was in the altar repenting to God getting delivered amen and they're serving God to today I'm talking about a God who has elected you to overcome the perversion of this age homosexuality is defeated perversion is defeated the world is defeated Hollywood is defeated we have been elected by the revelation of predestination to overcome every devil and rise in the power of the Cross of Calvary now you may think I'm crazy but I believe the demon of homosexuality can move out and the god of clean can move [Applause] in you've come too late there will not be one devil not one Devil unconquered by this bride that's right now I know what I'm talking about because before the Temptation there was already a way of Escape made so in other words when I was preaching those to those to those Brothers there was already a way of Escape made what do you saying I'm saying God's a god of Mercy he's a god of Deliverance he does the impossible he still breaks Spirits now come on either we believe this message or not I know you get to preaching like that and that little devil raises up amen well let me say this when the spirit's gone under the blood amen you ain't got no right to hold it against them any longer longer they've changed identities come on Rahab do you want to be remembered the rest of your life as a harlot or do you want to say thank God that he sent Joshua to aen me up to a revelation that I elected to escape the destruction that is coming up come on Church well bless God I was no homosexual and I was no drugie and I was no prostitute amen well what were you what were we it don't matter what we were what matter say there was a God who is rich in Mercy and he made a way of escape and we have been changed by the power of the Holy Ghost we are no longer what the world thinks we are We Are Holy Ghost filled Blood Washed fire baptized devil defeating Messi with a commission of God Upon Our Life when it's gone it's gone when it's forgiven it's forgiven I feel that right there and I'm going to push against that Spirit if it's the last thing I do today when it's under the blood it's under the blood and as long as you keep trying to dig it up you're going to get in trouble with God but won't you let it go in the blood well and put your shouting shoes on put your joy shoes on it ain't who I am no more it ain't who I am no more man one time Liv down the town every time you walk by they said morning drunk he said morning they said morning drunk he said morning they said morning drunk he said morning every single morning they said morning drunk he answered to it but one night he got in a holy ghost meeting and the Holy Ghost got a heart of his life and the Holy Ghost changed him from the inside out he got up the next morning same clothes same hairstyle and he walked down to town and they said morning drunk and he kept on walking I'm going somewhere with that they said morning drunk and he kept on walking they said hey mour and drunk and he kept on walking finally they said hey drunk amen what is wrong with you he turned turned around he said I don't know who you're talking to they said we're talking to drunk he said I don't know who that is They said That's you he said that was me yesterday but that's not me today they said what do you mean he said I got the Holy Ghost last night and my life has been changed so I'm no longer identified by the things I come out of come on you know why I'm not calling you sinner I'm not calling you unbeliever it's cuz the blood is not against you the blood is over you the word is not in feat you the word is overcoming through you and I can stand here tonight and I can say sinless spotless virtuous perfected bride of Jesus Christ I can announce to you that God above you has been god with you but he is now God in you you never did it in the first place you are the sinless Justified bride of Jesus Christ I ain't going to answer to drunk I ain't going to answer to depression I ain't going to answer to condemnation I ain't going to answer to my p no more the blood speaks for me the blood has taken my voice and the blood says I'm free the blood says I'm pure the blood says I'm holy the blood says God is in me and he's walking through me and the devil's under my feet when he was on the cross we were on his mind I don't have time to read it to you can I preach it to you three great assaults on Jesus Mal Matthew 4 how can overcome three great assaults right three great assaults brother said watch that third assault was to give him the kingdom to give him a domain without the cross he said he did not want him to shed his blood he said because the minute oh God the minute his blood was shed you were no longer claimed by just a feeling you were no longer claimed by just a sensation you were claimed by the blood and the devil knew if he was going to get you he wouldn't just go for your feelings he wouldn't just go for your Sensations he couldn't just go through your emotion but now if he's going to get you buddy he got to go through the blood but I want to say this morning the blood is greater and the blood is stronger and the blood still has power it still has the power to save it still has the power to come on church I think it's time we get up out of our feelings and get up out of our little weirdness and will so and so hurt me and so and so offended me I think it's time to come back to a revelation I'm covered by the blood I'm walking by the blood my f is under the blood my church is under the blood everything about me is under the blood sister Becky I'm standing here identified as a vessel who's been claimed for the manifestation of the adoption of the sons I'm not backing up to that devil I'm a born son I'm a field son I'm a true son and I'm going to walk out this morning and speak to that devil and take back everything that he's taken from me what about it Church Living God why don't we take it back this morning why don't we take back back our joy why don't we take back our peace why don't we take back our Victory why don't we take back our praise why don't we take back our worship look at somebody next to you and say take it back you told the wrong person tell somebody else take it back take it back take it back brother Bill take it back brother Josh take it back Church youve been put in condition regardless of the conditions Hallelujah regard of the conditions brother Terry one of our favorite points regardless of the condition you're back walking with the Creator he that's in you y'all forgive me sometimes brother Terry and I I grew up shouting next to brother Terry probably driving him crazy what this little boy shouting about but it give us a fellowship around this word watch this back and he that is in you how I'm going to just say it to you can I say it like this how can I overcome say that with me how can I over overcome ask it in the form of a question how can I overcome ready for the answer he that's in you well brother Andrew that wasn't very deep it's deeper than you think how can I overcome he that's in you he that was in him spoke to the winds and the wind stopped the minute you see the snow head for the camp the minute it be to rain head for the camp but he stands there oh God he stands there and says speak to those winds and storms and it'll go away now the Bible lays before me which is my life is in it oh God which my life is in it my overcoming is in it my overcoming is in this word amen watch was it not I that spoke to the squirrels was it not I I am God he said speak those winds I raised up and I said I do not doubt your voice Lord I said Cloud snow rain sleep I resent your coming in the name of Jesus Christ go to your places I say that sun must come out immediately and Shine for 4 days till our hunting trip is over and I leave with my brethren and a few days later and a few weeks later it was still gusting and still snowing and still no amen it was gushing brother Shi but then it went whoosh amen it was gushing and it went whoosh then it went and it stopped I stood real still my Breen up there wondering what was happening the Sleep the rain stopped there came a wind ring down through the mountains lifted up the clouds one went this way east north west and south within a few minutes the Sun was shining with a nice and warm sun that's the truth God knows that's the truth I just stood there looking around with my hat off I got numb all over I thought the very God of creation it's all in his hands what he's telling me what he's telling me and I picked up my gun I wiped off the scope I started to walk back and go down the hill and someone said to me are you hearing me and someone said to me why don't you stroll with me through this Wilderness amen walk with me I said yes Lord with all my heart are y'all hearing me church it was the end I'm preaching now this is me it was the end of a 7-Day meeting the power of God had been Fallen Devils had been losing Spirits were being defeated the Holy Ghost was moving amen and Monday was rolling around and we weren't going to be going to church every night and we was going to get back in a normal routine so we was just going to lay the Bible down and just go back and walk with the things we've been walking with amen but all of a sudden a voice said you've walked with that long enough I know you want to go back and do what you was doing before you heard my voice speak but now that you've heard my voice it's time to change walking partners and fake Tabernacle I'm telling you this morning if you're going to get above it if you're going to overcome it you got to change who you're walking with you got to quit walk with negativity you got to quit walking with complexes you got to quit walking with he hurt my feelings and she didn't shake my hand you got to put your walking shoes on and you got to walk like Enoch you got to walk with God because you're going to walk right into a body change are y'all hearing me you're going to walk right into a body change now did y'all catch something there when brother said that he said all of a sudden he said all of a sudden he said there was a wind come down are y'all hearing me there was a wind come down and when the wind come down the wind went swoosh it went roaring through the woods and the rain stopped and the Sleep stopped and the clouds parted and the sun come out do you know what changed that was the voice of the Creator as he was speaking as he was speaking through the wind the voice of God still the conditions oh the prophet of God said it like this amen can I can I close on this point right here the protag God said like this he said now now do you see this he said potentially it's in here talking about your body change what is it it's the word promised before the foundation of the world and it only reflects the negative or reflect the positive word and the same thing or the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you your body will materialize around that word the same as it did Sarah when that old body she had that first body it had to be changed order to produce a sun that body could not do it and this body cannot do it so it'll have to be changed the same way to receive the son can I say this brother Shaman brother BR started walking back he began to turn back to an 18year old man he be to look down and his beard wasn't gray as his tears begin to hit the leaves he be to look over there and see the deer and he be to talk to the deer and the deer wasn't scared of him he said here I was brother Josh I was walking through verg and Timber in other words he was walking in Eden conditions again and the final part of Christ is the mystery of God revealed is by the Revelation having preeminence in a body it's going to walk you back into a garden of eaten condition come on church it's time to walk with God it's time to quit walking with our problems it's time to quit walking with situations it's time to walk with God we're going to walk in the Rapture brother Matthew one of these mornings between 6 and 9 we're going to step out of time into eternity we're going home church I've heard his voice brother Ander I'm scared I'm scared don't be scared he's already overcome can you give me five minutes greater is he that is in you am come on can you say that with me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world not was in you or brother shemiah will be in you but is Right amen amen that's right but is present tense in you little children Amplified Bible Believers dear ones you are of God and you belong to him and have all already overcome them the Agents of the Antichrist because he who is in you is greater than he Satan who is in the world of sinful mankind amen now the first thing man he first made Man In His Image and returning back to that image to our first created image can I have your can I have your undivided attention for just five minutes I'm closing when God created me William brandham I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know of but I was there I could preach there for an hour I was there I don't believe you're getting that he said but now just a minute Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here that he chose to send him before the world began now there was some part of me or and Neville and the rest of you all here that's in Christ Jesus before the world ever began and here here's my analysis of that yes sir y'all want to take his analysis I think that the people today how many people today that are possessed with his Spirit or the spirit AP part of these Angelic beings Spirits which rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven amen amen can I tell you sister Anna why the devil hates you is you're a part of that and in the mind of God you resisted the devil's lie there that's why sister Leanne you're resisting the devil here if we could only receive this truth well brother Andrew it don't matter who well let me ask you this who spoke it well can I say this a Vindicated prophet and he said there only be one Prophet messenger and when he singular shall begin to sound now watch this he said an not only evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who will reveal the Mysteries as contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers thus sayi the Lord by his unfailing word stands and shall stand and be Vindicated there is one Prophet Messer of this age one of the bases of human behavior alone anyone knows that where there are many people there's a divided opinion on lesser points of a major Doctrine which they all hold together who then yeah who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last age for this last age is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride that means we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul I will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet Messenger as thoroughly Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than was any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day because this man will of necessity have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will show him forth are y'all ready for this he won't need to speak for himself for God will speak for him by the voice of the sign so in other words there's going to be a voice and that voice was up in the mountains one day and that voice changed the conditions of the woods so that a prophet amen could come back and tell the church that I didn't just speak and say are you with me he brother M didn't just stand there and say sun come out Moon stay still wind go back Shine for 4 days he didn't just say that and then all these conditions happen no there was a wind that come through the woods and all of a sudden brother the ter there was a whoosh and then there was a stop in other words he spoke but his words didn't just go out there but God heard his words and God turned back and spoke and he heard him speak you say brother Andrew I wish I'd have been amen out there in Colorado well if you got that clip that clip to play there in the quote I want you to hear [Music] this they never foret the holy come into heart just now and just move out all everything and all the sickness from their body I now challenge the devil to a debate Satan you are aware that you are whipped you have no legal rights Jesus Christ my Lord stripped you of every Authority you had when he died at Calvary to take away sin and sickness and you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your bluff amen you know that when our Lord came to the tree he cursed the tree the next day it was withering and our lord said to his disciples have faith in God Amen for if ye shall say ye shall say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart Hallelujah but believe what you have said is coming to pass you can have what you said amen Satan you know the scripture on that and I've just taught this people that God is in them and if God is in them and they speak to that disease and say be away from me and don't doubt in their heart right then that disease has to move for Christ said so for it's not them that speak it's the father that dwells in them that's speaking they're in need so come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ I say as God's servant by a message from an angel who anointed and has proved to the people that Jesus is here and the message is right so come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ iure you to leave every sick person and get into outer darkness in the name of the Lord Jesus christall did you hear that I'm sure you heard that how many heard that great Roar go through the building just saying that was it all right surely you won't down any longer that was God I'm speaking back can't you see Rise do you believe you're healed you believe that God answered prayer raise your hands to him thank him for it it's over you're healed Jesus said if you shall say what is it when you are out from Babylon you're out from under unbelief you're out from under Superstition you're out from under all these things and you're filled with God's own life your voice is his voice you are I spoke it in my room a while ago God told me to do this and here it is he's confirmed it right now amen and blessed be the name of the Lord oh what a time that's the first time that's happened since South Africa how long will you grow up in unbelief get that the wind swept through this platform here just now is the holy spirit crossed over here because it was the spoken word of God that did it amen I've just taught the people that God is in them you speak and the wind comes right back let our musicians come this morning brother Ander why did you say that because you are the manifested sons you're the born Sons you're the true Sons that's right you're the field Sons you're the sons that will speak and their word will be backed Hallelujah Glory the power of infallibility is back what he in The Bride of Jesus Christ I want you to stand to your feet with us this morning how many can say Satan give it back amen Satan get out of my way Satan move out of the way amen Satan take your hands off my children yes Lord Satan take your hands off my life Satan take your hands off my church yes I guarantee you this morning when you speak you will speak by the voice of the word and the power of infallibility has moved into true Sons born Sons field Sons yeah can I leave you this this is why why you must preach this message that's right it's the only infallible message yeah in the Earth today that's right now I'm going to say it it may not be popular but I'm not one that believes that if you get in the Revelation this message you'll dry up and become a cold intellectual [Music] no I know that's not popular to say anymore but he say well you can't get in the revelation of it and you can't study and you can't dig it out cuz you do that you won't be able to dance you won't be able to shout you be able to praise God you got I believe the reason why we're shouting is because this Revelation has quickened in our heart yeah we've already overcome because the one that's in us has already overcome that's right and we're walking every day of our life for the bill and we're speaking to Devils we're speaking to atmospheres we're speaking over our home we're speaking over our children and God is coming right behind it coming right behind it and manifesting the power of the infallibility of the spoken word of God how many can say Lord I

throne Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word this morning father I pray some way somehow that these precious Believers of your word these born Sons filled Sons true Sons I pray somehow some

says we will make amen amen we love you Lord Jesus did you enjoy the service today powerful powerful amen amen amen a people coming in harmony with the word of God Amen coming in agreement amen the word having the the preeminence in our lives and I thought of you know brother uh brother Andrew saying that the adoption is the positioning the placing the putting things in in order and God is a god of order in me I remember uh going uh taking the family uh uh just before we moved here i' gotten Faith a violin and and uh found a teacher for there back in Tulsa Oklahoma that played in the symphony and uh so she was teaching starting to teach faith and things and so she invited us to uh to a concert that she was part of and and uh so we got free tickets and we went and before the concert we we had sat there and all them musicians up there playing their own way they were and they were talented musicians but they were just doing their own thing and it hurt my ear so bad and I I to told uh my wife and said man if if that's what that is that's that's I don't want to be here that's that's horrible and and I knew they were talented musicians but but everybody was just doing their own thing and and and all of a sudden just it just got quiet and then the conductor come start walking walking and everybody stood up and started clapping and and he bows then he turns around and he looks at all the musicians and they're just all looking at him then he starts beating that stick and before you know what everything everybody was doing their own thing but now they come under control of that conductor man they begin to play the most beautiful music I was so just like whoa I appreciate our music musicians here you've heard this week and [Applause] [Music] [Applause] uh I I think they're some of the best in my opinion and and it's not that they're professional musicians but brother Kevin he's he's he's a professional guitarist and I've recognized uh that he's got something special about him now we've all got they're all talented musicians but I asked brother Kevin I said brother Kevin if you could take these musicians and start teaching them Harmony teaching them Unity how to play together because you know cuz I remember them talented musicians there in that Orchestra all playing they're just doing their own thing and I thought you know if you could take these musicians they don't have to be just so the best but take them to where they learn how to play together and he's been doing that and I I tell you what I think it's just beautiful and I appreciate all these other musicians not wanting to do their own thing but just just doing what brother Kevin has taught them and it's making the most beautiful sound in my opinion and it's just creating such an atmosphere and I thought well that's just what the Lord is trying to do and this is what what brother Andrew was doing God sent us a prophet everybody was saying well I'm Baptist I'm this and I'm that and I'm I'm Pentecostal and I'm this and well I got the Holy Ghost you know he's going to teach me this and he's going to teach me that and everybody's got their own ideas but he's taken a a a people now in our own selves we're nothing but we have come under subjection to a message and we're coming in harmony with this word and what is an average people that denominations have been trying to make out of us cannot do it but God would send a profit and we're coming under Harmony and the Very God is now been able to take our lips and deity speaking through US deity been able to reflect itself through us and it's nothing that we're doing it's just a people coming in harmony with his word aren't you glad you're a part of that amen a message that is actually bringing us into adoption it's the same spirit that uh uh uh Luther had it's the same spirit that Wesley had they had the spirit of adoption back then it's the same Holy Ghost but something the conductor has come to bring us in harmony with his word to where it's not my ideas it's not your idea it's not your idea it's not your idea we're just all saying Amen to the true word of God and that same holy ghost is now being able to have preeminence in US aren't you glad for that I'm glad to be a part of that I was thinking last night um it was probably about 2: or 3: in the morning and and I heard some groaning and um crying and so I woke my wife up I said I think someone's crying and Ruth and Levi was laying in our on the floor and it was Ru she was crying there and she said my my stomach is just really hurting and man she just threw up everywhere and had to go to the bathroom diarrhea and it was just bad situation and uh so when she had finished that she come up crawling up on the bed and she's just shivering just real cold and she said dad would you pray for me and I said you bet I will you know so me and her mom just began to pray I began to rebuke that thing and I I just thought Satan you have no right over this girl we rebuke that thing and I and I thought you know may she feel better today so she can go to church that's just the way I I believed it woke up this morning she's doing great I mean symptoms gone able to come to church that's the God we serve I believe that you don't have to fear nothing that's just God aren't you glad for that I pray that something in this meeting has done something for you that
