[6:09] [Music]
[6:13] so glad that there is a group of people
[6:16] that have given their all to the Lord
[6:19] amen so many
[6:21] um
[6:21] today different groups are pledging
[6:24] their allegiance to many things
[6:27] but we pledge the allegiance to our
[6:30] allegiance to the lamb
[6:32] a man of the musicians can be dismissed
[6:35] it's good to see everyone
[6:37] in the house of the Lord and brother
[6:39] Bill sure good to have you I'm back and
[6:41] pray your uh feeling better and amen we
[6:46] sure love and appreciate brother Bill
[6:48] very much and um great uh blessing to us
[6:54] but if you have your Bibles we're going
[6:56] to turn to the Book of John the 13th
[6:59] chapter
[7:00] amen
[7:01] and Ray uh you know you got some rest a
[7:06] little bit
[7:10] man
[7:12] but um John the 14th
[7:16] John 14.
[7:19] amen there's a little ringing I don't
[7:22] know what it is
[7:23] but um
[7:26] but before we go into the word could we
[7:29] just bow our heads and talk to our Lord
[7:32] father
[7:34] and truly we pledge our allegiance to
[7:38] you
[7:40] Lord in this day and we realize
[7:44] more and more how few it is father
[7:48] that is really sold out to you but
[7:52] Lord we're just thankful for what you've
[7:55] done in our lives and how you've touched
[7:57] us
[7:58] thank you for keeping us Lord and
[8:01] answering so many of our prayers and
[8:05] you're just taking care of us and we're
[8:07] so thankful for that
[8:10] I pray father that you would just move
[8:12] among us this evening
[8:14] Lord just take what simple words we
[8:17] would have and pray that you would
[8:19] anoint Lord
[8:22] these lips of clay and anoint both
[8:26] speaker Lord and hearer
[8:28] Lord let it just be the words be rooted
[8:33] and established in our Heart Lord
[8:36] father that we can be more like you give
[8:39] us a greater faith
[8:41] greater understanding is our prayer in
[8:46] Jesus Christ's name amen
[8:49] the um
[8:51] uh John 14 and just start at the 12th
[8:56] verse
[8:57] but it um
[8:59] says verily verily I say unto you
[9:03] he that believeth on me the works that I
[9:05] do shall he do also
[9:08] and Greater Works than these shall he do
[9:12] because I go unto my father
[9:16] and whatsoever you shall ask in my name
[9:19] that will I do that the father may be
[9:22] glorified in the son
[9:24] if you shall ask anything in my name
[9:29] I will
[9:31] do it
[9:33] everybody say I will do it
[9:36] ain't that a promise
[9:38] amen you can have your seeds
[9:40] and say Levi done a really good job at
[9:44] saying it man tell you what
[9:47] he uh he may not be able to get through
[9:49] that door now
[9:51] but uh
[9:53] uh enjoyed sister hope song as well amen
[9:58] but um uh thinking of this uh
[10:03] The Works that I do shall he do also and
[10:08] and of course brother Branham tells us
[10:10] that is the believer Jesus was speaking
[10:13] to the believer
[10:14] and he never he never put it as
[10:18] um
[10:19] um
[10:20] like he was speaking in general it was
[10:22] you shall do you shall do if you ask
[10:25] anything in my name I will do it for you
[10:29] and so it become a personal and and he's
[10:32] again talking to that believer there's
[10:35] still a ring Daniel I don't know what it
[10:38] is but so we realize that any promise is
[10:43] to the believer any promise of God and
[10:46] and you know the Bible says that every
[10:49] promise in him is yea and amen they are
[10:54] so sure they are so anchored uh it's and
[10:59] the promises of God are benefits for the
[11:02] believer to enjoy ain't that rhyme and
[11:06] so and and they are guaranteed to work
[11:09] for the believer every promise of God is
[11:12] guaranteed to work for the believer so
[11:16] doing the Greater Works is for the
[11:18] believer just as much much as salvation
[11:21] is for the believer now I think we could
[11:24] all believe that we're saved tonight
[11:26] right and we can all believe that we're
[11:27] saved well that that is by faith we we
[11:31] operate it now you know now that that's
[11:34] a real big step to believe that we're
[11:36] we're we're uh gonna make it in in the
[11:40] Rapture you know that because you know
[11:42] uh we see what the world is doing we see
[11:45] the world shaking in fear and and uh the
[11:49] the worst time uh is coming that that
[11:53] has never been seen on the face of the
[11:54] earth is coming of of this Great
[11:57] Tribulation that is at hand and yet
[12:00] while that is approaching and you can
[12:03] tell it's approaching because the people
[12:05] are nervous anxiety fear uh everything
[12:10] uh uh they're looking for answers
[12:13] they're trying to find the peace they're
[12:15] they're and yet we're in in in
[12:19] looking in the same in in the same
[12:22] direction in other words we we can we
[12:25] can see it coming we we see what's going
[12:27] on in the world and yet we realize that
[12:30] we're not part of it because we believe
[12:33] that we're saved we we believe that
[12:37] we're the Bride of Jesus Christ so if we
[12:40] can stand that way in faith knowing and
[12:44] believing that we are the bride of
[12:46] Christ uh uh then we can look at all the
[12:50] other promises and believe that we're
[12:54] able to do the Greater Works ain't that
[12:56] right we're able to do the Greater Works
[12:58] so Jesus said that um uh uh you know
[13:03] that he didn't do any of the works a man
[13:07] that was done through him he said it was
[13:09] the father that was in him that he's the
[13:13] one that done the works ain't that right
[13:15] so we we understand that Jesus was a
[13:18] dual person he he was he was man the son
[13:22] and yet he was God Almighty ain't that
[13:26] right amen so for the spirit in him was
[13:30] God as we have quoted you know it Paul
[13:33] says that uh God was in Christ
[13:36] reconciling the world unto himself so so
[13:40] uh
[13:42] um uh uh Jesus being a dual person
[13:45] brother Brian said the people couldn't
[13:46] understand him because uh there were
[13:49] times that he would speak as God and
[13:50] other times he would speak as man and
[13:53] and and and so uh uh you know he was
[13:58] hungering at one point and and then
[14:00] another point you know uh uh he was
[14:03] multiplying uh The Fish and Loaves and
[14:06] and these things because he was a dual
[14:09] person well we are I believe that we are
[14:13] a dual person the believer is a dual
[14:16] person a man in that amen we are human
[14:20] and yet that same spirit that was in
[14:24] Christ is in us can you say Amen now the
[14:28] skeptic might hear that and say well
[14:30] that's that's just bizarre but but you
[14:33] you got to remember that we're not uh
[14:35] we've got the Living God that is within
[14:38] us and and when when uh the Bible says
[14:42] that you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[14:44] amen well that ain't just a a cliche
[14:48] amen that ain't just something we just
[14:51] say Amen that is a reality that if if
[14:55] the Holy Ghost is in us which is none
[14:57] other than God Amen then God uh uh he is
[15:03] a person he's a personality and so when
[15:06] he comes in us he doesn't change himself
[15:08] amen because he came in US amen my
[15:12] nature may be whatever you know you may
[15:14] be shy in your nature but when God comes
[15:16] in you amen God's still the same God
[15:19] that he's always been amen you might be
[15:21] a little backward amen uh and have that
[15:24] that timid nature but when when God gets
[15:27] in you amen he's he's his own person
[15:30] he's his own nature he's his own
[15:33] personality can you say amen amen so so
[15:37] we find that that that God uh uh uh the
[15:41] prophet in speaking of the Bride said
[15:43] she is him she is flesh of his flesh
[15:47] bone of his bone life of his life
[15:51] power of his power she is him ain't that
[15:55] right
[15:56] so as we were talking amen uh this
[16:00] morning you know the the bride she is
[16:02] different from the rest of the world
[16:04] Amen she has been hewed out we have been
[16:07] hewed out amen now you think of that we
[16:10] were not uh um uh what would be that
[16:14] word we're not reformed we didn't become
[16:18] reformed from one thought to another
[16:21] thought or uh from maybe a Baptist
[16:25] thought to a Pentecostal thought or or a
[16:28] a Jehovah's Witness Doctrine to to the
[16:32] message we we weren't reformed amen we
[16:36] were hewed out
[16:37] can you say Amen totally different in my
[16:41] opinion we were hewed out see this bride
[16:44] has been hewed out from all unbelief
[16:47] remember the prophet preached the
[16:49] message God calls for a separation from
[16:52] all unbelief the only way that you could
[16:55] have been separated is by this message
[16:57] of the hour and God done it it wasn't a
[17:00] teacher of that done and it it wasn't
[17:02] even the prophet himself that done it it
[17:05] was God that done it by the message that
[17:07] the prophet brought amen we were hewed
[17:10] out from unbelief we were hewed out from
[17:12] the Creeds and dogmas of of man we were
[17:16] hewed out even from our own thoughts a
[17:19] man's seen and this bride has come to
[17:22] recognize her place and position she's
[17:26] recognized her day and her hour do you
[17:29] believe that well that's what the
[17:30] prophet said in the recognizing your day
[17:32] in this message amen the prophet said
[17:34] the brightest come to recognize her dad
[17:37] day and her hour amen that's that's
[17:40] that's right amen and and we even look
[17:43] at Israel how that Israel is has
[17:46] recognized she's she's in her Homeland
[17:49] not just there to be there but she
[17:52] realizes she's there Amen to see the
[17:55] Messiah she recognizes why she is in
[17:59] that land amen and we're talking about
[18:02] the true uh the the true seed of Israel
[18:05] the true elect amen see and so the
[18:08] prophet Hosea even prophesied that they
[18:11] would be gathered again and yet the
[18:13] prophet said at the same time that that
[18:16] Israel is recognizing what is going on
[18:19] for her this bride has recognized the
[18:23] evening light amen the prophet said the
[18:26] hungry Pentecostals have begun to
[18:28] recognize that them organizations hasn't
[18:30] got anything they was looking for
[18:33] they're so twisted and tore up it's the
[18:36] time of recognition mission do you
[18:39] believe that it's the time of
[18:41] recognition amen playing church is over
[18:43] it's the time of recognition fussing and
[18:46] fighting and feuding is over it's the
[18:49] time of recognition the name he says
[18:52] you've got to recognize the world has
[18:54] recognized the Nations I've recognized
[18:57] science is recognized the devil has
[19:00] recognized it's the time that he can
[19:03] wreck women wreck the church wreck the
[19:05] people he's recognized it think of that
[19:07] he's recognized that this is the time to
[19:11] wreck people's lives this is the time
[19:14] amen direct churches and and all of
[19:17] these things but God has recognized that
[19:19] there is a people on Earth that he has
[19:22] predestinated to life aren't you glad
[19:24] that God is recognized amen God is very
[19:27] well aware of this age amen it's not
[19:30] like he's oblivious to it it's not like
[19:32] all the angel ages just blending
[19:35] together amen if it had not been for a
[19:38] prophet Amen to separate the ages that
[19:40] we're living in and and that's been
[19:42] through amen God has recognized this age
[19:46] that he's got a predestinated People
[19:48] amen for his glory he's recognized that
[19:52] this is the time to send this message
[19:53] and he's done it see the people has
[19:56] recognized it the bride time has
[19:59] realized the evening light
[20:02] amen and what's happened under this
[20:05] recognition she comes under expectation
[20:08] amen we as a people the believer the
[20:11] bride are under expectation the bride
[20:14] she understands why she was put here on
[20:18] this Earth
[20:19] and it wasn't to have a a an 80-hour job
[20:23] and it wasn't to have all the
[20:25] materialistic amen that that that Satan
[20:28] wants to drive us to amen we've got a
[20:31] greater purpose than that
[20:32] can you say Amen it's true see and and
[20:36] so see you're you're you're you're not
[20:38] going the way of the mainstream ideas
[20:41] anymore amen you're not acting with the
[20:45] rest of the world anymore you don't have
[20:47] the same thought pattern as the church
[20:49] world anymore see you've been hewed out
[20:52] for a purpose
[20:54] no do you believe that that's why this
[20:57] this this church will never go back to
[20:59] denomination this message can never be
[21:02] organized again why we've been hewed out
[21:06] this has been the queuing out time that
[21:09] God would take out a people for his
[21:12] name's sake
[21:15] a man different you've broken the cycles
[21:18] now you think of that the message of the
[21:20] hour has broken the cycles that has been
[21:22] going on for ages and ages and ages and
[21:26] yet the message in it takes your life
[21:28] and breaks the Cycles in your life
[21:33] see God predestinated you to be a
[21:36] believer
[21:37] ain't that right
[21:39] so we're under expectation if God said
[21:41] it we believe it
[21:43] amen we're under expectation we expect
[21:45] nothing less than the supernatural to
[21:47] come Among Us
[21:49] we expect nothing less than to do the
[21:51] Greater Works we expect nothing less
[21:53] than to see miracles happen we expect
[21:56] nothing less than to see our children
[21:57] filled with the Holy Ghost we expect
[21:59] nothing less than to see amen uh God
[22:03] give us victory over in the things that
[22:05] we're struggling with in our life amen
[22:07] we've been hewed out can you say Amen
[22:09] we're not looking at the situation we're
[22:11] not looking at the impossibilities we're
[22:14] not considering anything we're looking
[22:16] at the word of God we've been hewed out
[22:19] in this age Amen to believe the word of
[22:22] God Amen separate from everything else
[22:27] all right yes
[22:29] yes ma'am
[22:30] brother Branham
[22:33] he Likens the setting of the world today
[22:36] as
[22:38] it was in the days of the judges
[22:41] in in the Old Testament with Israel
[22:44] and Israel had been playing with God
[22:49] and they would get into sin
[22:52] and then they would go into captivity
[22:54] then God would in his graciousness would
[22:57] deliver them from the enemy
[22:59] and it wouldn't be long too long after
[23:01] that Israel would go to sin and again
[23:03] and they would go into captivity God in
[23:07] his Mercy would come and deliver them
[23:08] again
[23:09] and God would show his Mercy toward them
[23:12] time and time and time again
[23:15] and it was like just putting up with the
[23:16] little old baby little old kid a man
[23:20] they go to sinning they're going to
[23:21] captivity amen you realize that Israel
[23:25] was God's people
[23:27] amen now think of that Israel was God's
[23:29] people and the enemy could not touch
[23:31] them the enemy couldn't hurt them the
[23:34] enemy could not defeat them the only
[23:36] time the enemy could do that is when
[23:38] they're in sin
[23:39] ain't that right because they were God's
[23:41] people God had taken them out of a
[23:44] Nation a man to display his power
[23:47] but and they're going to sin and they
[23:49] deserved it and they went into captivity
[23:51] but God rich in Mercy would bring that
[23:54] Nation back out and it was just
[23:55] constantly going constantly going see a
[23:59] man see and so you you find that that
[24:02] when Israel got to uh to sin and then
[24:05] they lost their ability to win Wars
[24:09] ain't that right they lost their ability
[24:12] they they lost that Supernatural they
[24:15] were still the people of God but they
[24:17] lost the supernatural hey man
[24:20] they didn't win their Wars Always by
[24:22] sword
[24:24] they didn't win their world wars Always
[24:26] by military
[24:28] ain't that right sometimes they'd sing
[24:32] amen and they would win the war
[24:35] sometime that March around the city and
[24:37] they would win the war
[24:39] sometimes the anointing of them ornament
[24:41] would come upon a little boy a man
[24:43] needed to take a slingshot amen and they
[24:46] would win a war
[24:48] sometimes they would take the anointing
[24:50] Upon A man amen did grab an ox gold amen
[24:53] and and go to the enemy amen and win a
[24:56] war amen it had nothing to do with man
[25:00] yeah the the science of man it it had
[25:03] nothing to do with the intellectual of
[25:04] man it had to do with the supernatural
[25:09] you believe that Amen to Supernatural
[25:13] but see the people of Israel they did
[25:16] not come out of Egypt by military power
[25:19] they didn't come out by scientific
[25:21] inventions or through educational
[25:23] programs they came out of Egypt by the
[25:28] power of the Living God
[25:31] ain't that right and they were sustained
[25:34] by the power of God so that no military
[25:37] power could ever conquer them
[25:43] amen
[25:44] no military power could conquer them
[25:48] because they were sustained by a
[25:51] supernatural power
[25:54] I feel sorry for those these
[25:57] make-believers that are looking toward
[25:58] the White House for help
[26:01] as if they've got the answers as if
[26:03] Trump has the answers
[26:05] you know you know as if the next
[26:07] republican or democrat or whatever has
[26:09] the answers amen the believer has been
[26:12] hewed out of all of this
[26:14] can you say amen amen we're not like
[26:17] Israel that wanted a natural King a
[26:19] natural government they should have
[26:21] known better there was no King that
[26:22] could have taken them out of Egypt
[26:25] it was God that done that
[26:28] can you say amen and there ain't no
[26:30] president that's going to help us in
[26:32] this hour
[26:34] there ain't no hope in this hour except
[26:36] getting out of here
[26:38] there's a Rapture at hand
[26:42] can you say amen that's right see see
[26:45] but when they no longer had the power of
[26:48] God with him then they were as weak and
[26:51] helpless as any other Nation
[26:55] ain't that right
[26:57] yes sir
[26:58] now today look at the day
[27:01] amen God is put up
[27:04] with with the church all the way through
[27:06] the ages
[27:07] and going to one ISM God would take him
[27:10] out
[27:11] and they would go into another ism and
[27:14] he's going to captivity
[27:16] ain't that right study the Masterpiece
[27:18] study the the church ages study all
[27:20] these things amen study the the the the
[27:23] the seals and all that there was an
[27:26] enemy that was writing
[27:28] in the church ages ain't that right amen
[27:32] and when Israel or when the church began
[27:35] to backslide amen remember they lost
[27:38] their first love in the first church age
[27:40] amen and they took dogmas instead of
[27:43] Amen instead of the word of God they
[27:45] they adopted titles instead of the name
[27:47] of Christ and and all of these things
[27:50] and what happened amen the enemy was
[27:52] able to come in there
[27:57] God brought him through with Wes with
[28:00] Luther
[28:01] and I go right back in
[28:03] and defeated
[28:05] conquered
[28:06] right
[28:08] he brought him out through Wesley there
[28:10] they go back right in again
[28:12] brought him out through Pentecost
[28:15] and there they go back in again
[28:17] you say Amen yep Pentecostals is just as
[28:20] helpless as any of them
[28:23] they're just as helpless see see the
[28:26] word has been Twisted in every way to
[28:29] fit everyone's ideas
[28:31] amen ain't that right now I want you to
[28:33] listen I'm going to shoot straight here
[28:34] for a few moments but people wonder why
[28:37] things are going wrong in their life
[28:40] a man and their family or or whatever
[28:43] and you know first of all they ought to
[28:47] check
[28:48] all of us here if it's happening here uh
[28:52] internet whatever you ought to check to
[28:55] see where you are with the word of God
[29:00] you see the churches look look at
[29:02] laodicea we're just going to look at
[29:04] laodicea the churches have gotten away
[29:07] from God
[29:09] you believe that yep yep they've gotten
[29:12] away from God now now the prophet even
[29:16] told us you know about Russia having
[29:18] their their
[29:19] um uh their Pentecostal movement you
[29:23] know and how it was great and all that
[29:25] but then they got away from God and they
[29:27] set their dead today
[29:29] now I know they say they've got their
[29:30] little Pentecostal moves and and their
[29:32] little tongue speaking in their little
[29:34] prophecies and all that but the church
[29:36] says they're dead
[29:37] you see we understand then that just a
[29:41] little prophecy
[29:42] that that ain't what we're looking for
[29:46] just a little speaking in tongues that's
[29:49] not what we're looking for that's what
[29:52] they had in the Pentecostal movement
[29:54] and yet the prophet said there's been no
[29:57] Revival to wake this bride up yet
[30:02] don't get me wrong I believe in gifts
[30:03] and all these things but that's not
[30:04] that's not the the icing on the cake
[30:08] so here they are the church is second
[30:10] dead and yes they're prophesying yes
[30:11] they're speaking in tongues yes they're
[30:13] Discerning yes they're doing all these
[30:15] things uh uh but yet the church is set
[30:17] dead no life
[30:19] hey man look at the home life
[30:21] the home life is in disarray
[30:25] ain't that right
[30:27] now now you know just talking to a
[30:30] gentleman the other day but
[30:33] men don't know how to lead their homes
[30:35] anymore
[30:37] they just don't or they refuse to do it
[30:40] or they're too intimidated by the wives
[30:42] to do it
[30:43] but they don't know how to lead their
[30:45] homes
[30:46] and and this idea is a new thing
[30:51] it's hard to believe
[30:53] to the world to laodicea
[30:56] women don't want their husbands being
[30:58] head of the home and they refuse to come
[31:00] under the headship they want to be their
[31:03] own head they want to have their the the
[31:05] the things their own way can you say
[31:08] amen and yet did you know that brother
[31:11] Branham said as you serve your husband's
[31:13] sisters you serve the Lord
[31:17] that's right and the prophet said the
[31:21] greatest curse in the world is a
[31:24] dominating female
[31:27] can you say Amen
[31:29] so we we find that not only has it that
[31:33] has it just affected the home but it's
[31:37] tried to slip into the church
[31:41] where they've done their best to try to
[31:43] rule the church
[31:45] can you say Amen but it's against God's
[31:49] word
[31:51] are you with me now now Leota Sia has
[31:55] gone that direction
[31:56] but this bride has been hewed out by the
[32:01] word
[32:04] ain't that right
[32:05] men in this age are becoming more
[32:07] material minded
[32:09] and they're leaving off the spiritual
[32:10] things of God
[32:12] and of course they they quote their
[32:15] scriptures you know if a man doesn't
[32:17] work he doesn't eat he's got to be
[32:19] provider and he's got to do all of this
[32:21] but they never consider what Jesus said
[32:23] but seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[32:26] his righteousness and all these other
[32:28] things shall be added unto you
[32:31] can you say Amen they don't believe what
[32:34] Paul said my God shall supply all your
[32:38] need according to hisra not your riches
[32:42] he is riches not according to your bank
[32:45] account but he is riches
[32:49] ain't that right
[32:52] they say well we're barely you know
[32:54] we're barely making ends meet as it is
[32:58] and my answer to that is quit living so
[33:00] high on the hog
[33:02] to where you're constantly in debt
[33:06] I know we're we're in a we're in a
[33:09] materialistic world where we all got to
[33:10] have nice things
[33:12] you don't have to have nice things
[33:14] and if that in if that is interrupting
[33:16] your spiritual life
[33:19] can you say Amen
[33:21] if that's interrupting your spiritual
[33:22] life see now I know we we want our
[33:25] families to live life in Comfort here on
[33:28] this Earth and that's I I commend men to
[33:31] do that amen but if it cost you your
[33:34] spirituality
[33:38] brother Branham already told us we pray
[33:40] for comfort and peace
[33:45] they said God doesn't give us comfort
[33:46] and peace
[33:49] I wished I had the quote
[33:51] right before me but he just verb just
[33:53] just phrasing
[33:55] he's in this turmoil
[33:57] he sends us trials
[34:00] he sends us testings
[34:02] then you say man and then he says our
[34:05] comfort is over there
[34:09] and can you say man
[34:11] our comfort is over there
[34:14] so I I I believe that Satan in this age
[34:18] is convincing more and more people
[34:22] that they can go to church at their own
[34:24] convenience
[34:26] now I know this is becoming more touchy
[34:28] as as time goes
[34:31] but listen the Bible Still Remains the
[34:34] Same
[34:36] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[34:39] together even the more as you see that
[34:42] day approaching
[34:45] and I don't care who is teaching it that
[34:48] it's okay it's not okay
[34:54] are you with me
[34:56] we got women that'll trim their hair and
[34:58] I'm not saying in the church but it's
[35:00] just it's everywhere it was so much even
[35:03] in in the apostolics
[35:05] when we when we were in that Pentecostal
[35:08] yet trimmed their hair and then try to
[35:09] hide it
[35:11] so-called Christians watching all kinds
[35:14] of movies
[35:15] foreign
[35:16] God have mercy
[35:18] listen all kinds of ungodly music
[35:21] so wrapped up in sports
[35:24] they're not wrapped up in church they're
[35:26] wrapped up in sports
[35:28] then they come to church they want to
[35:30] say like a knot on a log
[35:32] sleep wonder why the preacher's
[35:34] preaching too long
[35:38] but you get them out there and they're
[35:40] wrapped up in every ungodly thing and it
[35:43] may not even be ungodly but if it's
[35:45] distracting your mind and your attention
[35:47] from the word of God something's wrong
[35:51] if the supernatural ain't happening in
[35:54] your life I'm just telling you church we
[35:56] can we can look and we can sit here all
[35:57] day long and say well I've heard about
[35:59] it I've heard about them good works but
[36:01] where is it
[36:04] well then that that question should look
[36:07] at us
[36:08] don't blame the preacher
[36:10] don't blame the Deacon don't blame your
[36:12] you know the guy next to you look at
[36:15] yourself
[36:15] [Music]
[36:17] right
[36:18] that's right see and and so these things
[36:21] have occupied the people's minds hearts
[36:25] and their time
[36:30] to where they have no time for the Lord
[36:32] if I would ask him he's got time for
[36:34] prayer this week
[36:36] oh yeah I prayed three minutes two
[36:38] minutes one minute
[36:42] getting into real prayer
[36:47] we're just going to talk for a moment
[36:49] all right
[36:50] because we wonder why the situations are
[36:53] there
[36:53] why is it
[36:55] why is it now we're having a hard time
[36:58] overcoming lust
[37:00] why is it
[37:01] that we're having over a hard time
[37:03] overcoming this why is it
[37:06] the troubles are around me
[37:08] and I'm just sitting here just like like
[37:10] I'm just a you know a a
[37:13] second duck
[37:16] God's just left me
[37:18] what are we entertaining
[37:21] see Israel as long as they walk they
[37:24] didn't follow the Commandments of God
[37:28] you say but I I've got I've got long
[37:30] hair I've we we've got Holiness
[37:32] standards you know good and well that's
[37:34] more than just that
[37:38] can you say Amen
[37:40] that's exactly right
[37:42] when we can't respect the house of God
[37:44] when we can't respect our husbands
[37:49] hello
[37:52] and and I'm just showing you it may not
[37:54] be here but I'm just showing you what it
[37:56] is out there
[37:58] somewhere the word of God and the
[38:00] presence of God left the World Church
[38:05] and I want to tell you young people
[38:07] there's a white reason why we are
[38:09] different
[38:10] it's more than just a message it's more
[38:13] than just a Doctrine
[38:16] it's more than just making us different
[38:18] because we believe Brother Brad and be a
[38:20] prophet we want the supernatural
[38:26] that's what God cut you out for
[38:30] not so you can come out of Baptist and
[38:32] come into a message and bring your old
[38:34] Baptist ways
[38:37] or your old Pentecostal ideas are your
[38:39] old legalistic ideas all that Junk's
[38:42] Gotta Die
[38:44] then you say Amen
[38:47] it's exactly right
[38:49] see so their mind is so cluttered that
[38:52] they hardly have time to think on the
[38:54] Lord
[38:55] hello
[38:57] amen children get sick we immediately
[39:00] want to go to the doctor we mentally
[39:01] start panicking we immediately start
[39:03] looking for scientific things why not
[39:06] just look to the Lord
[39:17] not against doctors as you know
[39:20] foreign
[39:23] that our minds are so cluttered up
[39:26] that the Lord becomes the last resort
[39:30] hello
[39:32] hey you know I'm just going to be honest
[39:34] with you we fight these we fight these
[39:37] things
[39:38] you know and and me and my wife we've
[39:41] had our discussions about things
[39:43] you know where is this coming from and
[39:46] what what's what's what about the
[39:47] finances and what about this and what
[39:49] about that and what about you know
[39:52] where you you you literally begin to
[39:54] panic
[39:55] it's okay what what what's what's next
[39:57] for my future I'll tell you what's next
[40:00] for my future God's with us
[40:03] and we're going to see victory
[40:05] you understand what I'm saying you might
[40:07] be struggling in your marriage and
[40:08] you're like well this this might be the
[40:10] end of it don't look at it that way look
[40:12] at the supernatural
[40:16] and you say Amen your back may be
[40:18] against the wall a man to where it looks
[40:20] like there's no absolutely no hope don't
[40:23] you look at it as that way
[40:26] there is a supernatural that is with the
[40:29] people of God
[40:34] well the doctor says I'll always be like
[40:36] this and I'll just I've got to carry
[40:38] this all my life you don't have to
[40:40] listen to that
[40:45] right
[40:47] Let's see we we got now we you've got
[40:50] people more you know they're more
[40:52] interested in in the football
[40:54] getting their children to football
[40:55] practice and making sure they attend
[40:57] their games
[40:59] and then they wonder why the children
[41:01] their own children don't have much
[41:03] enthusiasm about God anymore
[41:09] hello
[41:10] it's because we never presented God in
[41:12] that way
[41:13] that you need God more than you ever
[41:15] need anything else before you ever
[41:18] needed money you need God before you
[41:20] need a home you need God that's why the
[41:23] prophet said I'd rather live under a
[41:25] bridge eating soda crackers amen than
[41:27] the compromise on the word of God I need
[41:30] God
[41:33] can you say man
[41:35] young women today are more interested in
[41:37] getting prepared for a career than about
[41:40] their position in the home
[41:42] they want to get out and work
[41:44] and the churches and parents both are
[41:46] promoting such nonsense
[41:48] can you say Amen you know what the
[41:50] prophet said woman was made to be a help
[41:53] meet at the house
[41:54] [Music]
[41:56] that goes out the window many times but
[41:59] I'll tell you if you've been hewed out
[42:01] by the prophet's message you'll believe
[42:03] that
[42:05] it rain
[42:06] so well I just can't respect my husband
[42:08] you shouldn't have married him then
[42:15] and if you had dads to look at things
[42:17] and and be the head of their home when
[42:19] that old time is coming in trying to
[42:21] sneak around
[42:27] then you say Amen
[42:29] now brother Brown said if your husband's
[42:31] sick everybody say if my husband's sick
[42:33] not you men
[42:36] women
[42:39] if your husband's sick then you need to
[42:41] go out and work
[42:43] but if it isn't listen to your sister
[42:46] God Made You for one place
[42:51] the kitchen
[42:55] and when you get out of there you're out
[42:57] of his will
[42:58] remember that
[43:00] women was made to be a help mate at the
[43:03] house she never was made for office work
[43:06] and it's caused more disgrace and more
[43:09] divorces and things
[43:13] I've had young women come and tell me so
[43:15] well I'm just not made to be that way I
[43:17] hate to cook and be stuck in the house
[43:21] you know what I got to say it's a
[43:23] perverted spirit
[43:28] it's just like them homosexuals trying
[43:30] to tell us
[43:31] that we were born to be homosexuals no
[43:33] you wasn't
[43:35] you got a demon on you
[43:37] that's making you believe that junk
[43:42] God wouldn't make the woman for that to
[43:44] have a prophet to set the standard for
[43:46] the household amen and then make her to
[43:48] where she wants to go out and she can't
[43:50] be what she's supposed to be
[43:52] it's the spirit of the age that's what
[43:55] it is
[43:58] and you say Amen
[44:00] just like the woman you know years ago
[44:02] that told me that she has to cut her
[44:04] hair because having long hair causes her
[44:06] to have headaches
[44:09] what an excuse
[44:12] me be honest with you there ain't no
[44:13] excuse that's going to hold up in God's
[44:15] courts
[44:19] and you say man
[44:21] he promised he'd give us Grace
[44:26] foreign
[44:27] you ain't cooking cooked by the grace of
[44:29] God
[44:31] hate working go work by the grace of God
[44:35] can you say man he never made men to sit
[44:38] there on their phones and and and and
[44:40] and do video games all day
[44:42] what such Tommy rot
[44:54] so when we get down to the root of it
[44:56] all it's an evil spirit that's anointing
[44:58] to people to be the way they are
[45:02] thank you
[45:03] hello
[45:06] they started entertaining thoughts
[45:09] well I got to do something for my child
[45:12] they're just sitting in the church dead
[45:13] they just ain't got no friends they
[45:15] ain't doing all this and you know what
[45:16] it is it's Satan that is is is pulling
[45:19] them away
[45:21] to whether they're not comfortable in
[45:23] church they're not a comfortable around
[45:24] comfortable around Christians
[45:27] more comfortable out there in the sports
[45:29] team
[45:30] more comfortable out there in the world
[45:34] can you save it and I don't care the
[45:36] best of them amen they they say well I'm
[45:39] a churchgoer the best of them ain't got
[45:41] the Holy Ghost if they're wearing their
[45:43] shorts I don't care how good they are
[45:45] they are anointed of a devil to do that
[45:50] that's what the prophet said and if you
[45:52] are hewed out by the prophet of this age
[45:54] you'll believe that
[46:01] it's an evil spirit
[46:03] brother Brown said when people claim to
[46:05] be Christians or personate Christianity
[46:07] or try to act like they're Christians
[46:09] when down in their heart they don't have
[46:10] the peace of God you only become an
[46:12] actor
[46:13] you know people really know that see
[46:16] your neighbor neighbor knows that you're
[46:18] just acting that way certainly she sees
[46:20] you get mad and fly loose beat the dog
[46:22] around the house and holler at your
[46:24] husband and Scat him under the bed when
[46:26] he comes in and you do the same see they
[46:28] know that's not Christianity
[46:36] he said when you really get saved
[46:39] he changes you
[46:41] when that homo really gets saved he'll
[46:44] never be a homo again
[46:49] when that man that's acting feminine
[46:51] and all wearing them tight jeans
[46:54] he gets saved he'll never do that again
[46:58] and that woman trying to be a man and be
[47:00] masculine like a man she gets saved
[47:03] she'll never be that again
[47:07] can you say Amen
[47:08] why when you really get safety changes
[47:11] you
[47:12] can you say man seed The Works that I do
[47:14] shall you do also
[47:18] you can't do it by going to the movie
[47:20] theaters
[47:23] can doing it by watching these ungodly
[47:26] filthy movies
[47:32] amen
[47:33] people won't take communion
[47:36] because they have believed the LIE of
[47:37] the devil
[47:43] you'll either have to believe the
[47:44] prophet what the prophet said about you
[47:48] or you'll continue believing that lie
[47:51] [Music]
[47:56] because communion is something that God
[47:58] requires us to park take in
[48:05] you say well I don't feel I just don't
[48:07] feel Worthy
[48:09] the prophet said there's a blood to make
[48:11] you Worthy
[48:16] you see if we're not hiding behind the
[48:18] word of God
[48:20] then we become susceptible to anything
[48:23] we're the only thing that makes us
[48:26] different
[48:27] a different group of people from the
[48:29] rest of the people
[48:31] is the blood
[48:33] is the word of God
[48:36] the word of God is our Fortress
[48:39] and once that is taken away if we start
[48:42] allowing little sins in our life it
[48:44] strips us of the supernatural
[48:48] and we become as the Pentecostal as
[48:51] Samson
[48:53] that God never did intend us to be like
[48:56] that
[49:00] can you say Amen
[49:06] see if you open up a little gate the
[49:09] devil takes takes control
[49:11] and then we wonder why he's wreaking
[49:13] havoc in our lives
[49:14] we wonder why this is going on and we
[49:16] ain't got no power to stop it I'll tell
[49:18] you why
[49:19] is because we're allowing things in our
[49:22] life that God never did a lot
[49:26] on
[49:29] I'm gonna tell off for myself okay
[49:36] sometimes as a I guess my
[49:39] my disposition or whatever I whatever it
[49:43] is
[49:45] I can go into depression
[49:49] and I I go dark deep in in my mind I'm a
[49:53] deep thinker
[49:56] and I start thinking about things things
[49:59] that are going on things that are
[50:00] happening maybe it's in the church or
[50:02] maybe it's in the family or maybe it's
[50:03] in the world and I start thinking about
[50:05] them and start thinking about my
[50:07] Ministry I think about what you know the
[50:09] past or I start thinking of this and and
[50:12] now and I'm telling you for a reason
[50:16] them things should never be allowed them
[50:18] things should never be because the
[50:20] prophet told us
[50:22] to be positive always positive never let
[50:26] a never negative thought into your mind
[50:33] but I had hit that low I hit a low
[50:38] I was in a church service the power of
[50:40] God was moving
[50:43] the the brother that was preaching wow
[50:45] he was tearing it up and I was agreeing
[50:48] with everything he said
[50:50] the service started going
[50:52] the song service was great
[50:54] people really worshiping God
[50:59] and somewhere a little thought hit my
[51:01] mind
[51:04] and I let it drift
[51:07] and I started thinking on a negative
[51:09] thought
[51:11] just about my own life negative
[51:15] and before you know it such a spirit of
[51:18] depression grabbed a hold of me
[51:21] I felt my chest tightening up
[51:25] I'm hearing the message
[51:27] and I'm saying amen but it's Amen
[51:31] amen
[51:32] a minister sitting there by me
[51:35] he's rejoicing and he just turns around
[51:37] and looks at me
[51:40] what in the world's happening
[51:43] on and I couldn't break it
[51:47] and and it was just it was such a power
[51:50] I don't know how to explain it but it
[51:52] was just a power
[51:56] and the whole service I couldn't lift my
[51:59] hands
[52:01] I was agreeing with the message I was
[52:03] hearing it it was right it was a man it
[52:05] was true
[52:06] but I couldn't rejoice
[52:09] in my heart I think God please help me
[52:12] God help me
[52:13] whatever the spirit is doing help me
[52:17] I wanted to leave the church because I
[52:19] thought I was being an embarrassment or
[52:21] thought of being a hindrance to the
[52:22] ministers that was sitting there
[52:24] now I'm really telling off of myself
[52:28] but I told the Lord Lord please if you
[52:30] deliver me I don't want to ever go this
[52:32] road again
[52:33] I'll never listen to that Spirit again
[52:37] God please help me be think on the
[52:39] positive give me that Grace
[52:43] and it was by God's grace that that
[52:45] thing lifted
[52:46] it was it was at the end of the service
[52:49] and the thing finally just lifted away
[52:53] the minister said what what was going on
[52:55] he I mean he's looking at me
[52:57] it's what was going on I saw I I don't
[53:00] know
[53:01] all I know is that some Spirit came it
[53:03] was a depression depressive spirit
[53:06] my chest started her I thought I was
[53:08] just I thought my heart was going to
[53:10] blow I I just it was the most awfullest
[53:13] weirdest feeling ever
[53:15] that I told I told the Lord I'll never
[53:17] think of thought and negative thought
[53:18] help me never to go that direction
[53:21] now that opened my eyes to what what I'm
[53:23] talking about to you right now
[53:25] that you give the devil one inch
[53:30] he's going to rule
[53:33] he's going to take over
[53:36] if if you are if you are a person that
[53:39] like to talk negative think negative
[53:40] don't you do that
[53:43] get away from that
[53:45] if you are a person that that you know
[53:48] that that just says well I can do
[53:50] whatever you know uh I know it says
[53:53] there but you know and you're letting
[53:54] the devil twist the scriptures in your
[53:56] mind to you get away from that
[53:59] now see God has hewed us out for a
[54:02] purpose
[54:06] it's true
[54:08] that's all right
[54:12] the enemy is doing everything to attack
[54:18] and you may be having life easy right
[54:21] now but remember
[54:23] if you're giving in today
[54:26] Satan's going to press and press and
[54:28] press and get you more relaxed
[54:32] there's a man in Pennsylvania and I I
[54:35] love the brother I I think dearly of him
[54:38] and
[54:40] he was a big help to us at our church in
[54:43] Erie Pennsylvania
[54:44] great great help loving
[54:47] but he had children
[54:49] Levi's age and Ruth Sage these voices
[54:53] that want to go Church all the time but
[54:55] he would never go to church maybe on
[54:57] Sundays
[55:00] why don't I just talk to him and so
[55:03] Darren
[55:06] you better get them boys in church
[55:08] he had one teenager that really wanted
[55:10] to get in church
[55:12] I said you better get them boys in
[55:13] church yeah yeah yeah yeah I know I know
[55:16] I know I said no no no you're not
[55:18] listening to me
[55:19] you're not listening to me listen to
[55:21] what I'm trying to tell you it's the
[55:22] grace of God that your children want to
[55:24] go to church
[55:27] it's the grace of God that your family
[55:29] wants to go to church get them in church
[55:30] quit playing around in this thing
[55:33] yeah yeah yeah I know I know I know but
[55:36] he never would change his mind about it
[55:40] I was very strict with him
[55:42] because I'm telling you right now Darren
[55:45] your children ain't gonna be the same
[55:47] once the devil gets a hold of him
[55:52] went up there this time divorced
[55:56] not one of them children have a desire
[55:57] to serve God
[55:59] he got him out in sports
[56:03] and there he is still the same old same
[56:06] old person I love him to death he loves
[56:08] me to death
[56:09] but he never saw the impact of what
[56:12] Satan was doing to him
[56:14] [Music]
[56:16] can you say Amen
[56:19] now let's look now there are people who
[56:21] make excuses as to why they can't get
[56:23] baptized you see the devil will he we
[56:27] will let the devil just to any fire
[56:29] justify anything in our minds
[56:34] then you say Amen
[56:36] but there is no excuse
[56:41] you with me
[56:45] people will never get any further with
[56:47] God until they get rid of the unbelief
[56:49] and come into obedience to the word of
[56:52] God
[56:53] I don't care how much you've got to
[56:55] sacrifice I don't care how much we you
[56:58] know we we've got to uh uh get down to
[57:01] business and get rid of this and get rid
[57:02] of that and how much it hurts amen and
[57:04] the devil say you're just becoming a
[57:06] fanatic no we've been you'd ouch
[57:11] for a purpose
[57:17] you realize the devil can't set a foot
[57:19] on a person until he gets away from God
[57:22] can you say man
[57:24] he can't he can't destroy a family
[57:26] unless they get away from God when Daddy
[57:29] quits doing what he's supposed to be
[57:30] doing in that headship in that house and
[57:33] I'm not just talking about leading I'm
[57:34] not just talking about work guys can go
[57:37] work and they become Workaholics and
[57:38] they become that's the easy thing for
[57:40] this layout of SIA is to become
[57:42] pleasure-minded materialistic minded
[57:47] but very few people know how to lead
[57:50] their family in the spiritual things
[57:54] very few men
[57:57] can you say Amen
[57:59] that's right
[58:01] now he may not get you to wear your full
[58:03] blown out in the world
[58:04] he may get you to where you're just cold
[58:06] lukewarm church member where you have no
[58:09] Supernatural power in your life you
[58:11] don't understand the spiritual things of
[58:12] God he may get you to where you just
[58:14] can't believe for the impossible anymore
[58:16] and every little thing that comes along
[58:18] in your life just upset you and trips
[58:20] you up and and you're just wondering why
[58:25] you understand what I'm saying
[58:28] I'm Gonna Let You Go
[58:31] brother Brandon talks about this
[58:33] Minister y'all y'all would remember
[58:36] Branham he asked brother how's your
[58:39] church doing well doing good we're
[58:40] feeding them you know pills pills like
[58:43] kind of pills Gospels
[58:47] and he said How's your church doing well
[58:49] we we just you know he's I just made all
[58:51] my congregation to
[58:53] sign a pledge a thing piece of paper
[58:56] pledging that there'd be at least Church
[58:58] six months out of the year
[59:05] and as they're talking about this
[59:07] they're in a they're in a in a building
[59:08] and a girl you know brother Brown called
[59:12] her a wild cat
[59:13] you know she'd come banging on the door
[59:15] and I think brother Brown was working
[59:17] there the someone was working there and
[59:18] so brother Brandon Moses she flies right
[59:20] by Brother Branham
[59:22] forgets about brother Brandon being
[59:23] there
[59:24] and then there's a DJ on the radio
[59:26] that's that's whatever
[59:28] doing his thing
[59:29] and the girl blows the kiss
[59:32] at the radio
[59:34] and as she's leaving she walks out or
[59:36] she bumps and brother oh excuse me I
[59:38] forgot you're here
[59:39] and she looks at the radio and says I'll
[59:42] see you tonight
[59:45] and walks out they're going to have a
[59:46] big old dance
[59:49] now brother Brian said when that
[59:52] Minister told me about his people
[59:53] signing those pledges
[59:55] he said I asked him do you think that
[59:57] Wildcat player on that radio
[59:59] would have to make that girl sign a
[1:00:01] pledge that she would be over there that
[1:00:03] tonight
[1:00:04] not at all
[1:00:07] she would Pawn what clothes she had on
[1:00:09] to get there
[1:00:11] why
[1:00:12] it's something in her that's connected
[1:00:14] her a spirit to that worldly amusement
[1:00:19] and he says until the Church of the
[1:00:21] Living God that's called the bride of
[1:00:22] Christ gets herself connected with God
[1:00:24] like that she'll still wallow in the
[1:00:27] world and in the miracle of sin until
[1:00:29] she's connected with God in such a way
[1:00:31] till her heart is so filled with glory
[1:00:34] and power of God until she can't see
[1:00:36] nothing else but Christ
[1:00:38] can you say Amen if you allow me just a
[1:00:41] few more moments amen the prophet said
[1:00:43] see God finally got tired of playing
[1:00:46] games with Israel
[1:00:48] he finally got tired of it and he's
[1:00:50] tired of playing church with people or
[1:00:53] uh yeah yeah people playing Church in
[1:00:55] this day and and and the prophet said
[1:00:58] today right now is the time to get down
[1:01:02] to business with God
[1:01:05] that's what you're made for
[1:01:10] can you say Amen
[1:01:11] he said it's time for action
[1:01:14] it's time to act upon what we know it to
[1:01:17] be the truth
[1:01:18] and he said you cannot act unless you
[1:01:21] have faith and you cannot have faith
[1:01:23] unless you know what you are standing
[1:01:26] for or what you are doing
[1:01:28] ain't that right
[1:01:30] amen someone said someone said to me one
[1:01:33] time says no and no the doctor was
[1:01:34] talking about a miracle that happened
[1:01:36] among sick people and he said to me
[1:01:38] preacher don't you believe that if you
[1:01:40] told them people to go out and touch a
[1:01:41] tree or a post the same thing would take
[1:01:43] place I said no sir I said because you
[1:01:46] cannot have faith in touch in a tree or
[1:01:48] a post faith is not that loose
[1:01:53] and I'm gonna be honest you cannot have
[1:01:55] faith
[1:01:59] trimming your hair
[1:02:02] Faith ain't that loose
[1:02:04] you you can't have faith listen to the
[1:02:07] worldly music Faith ain't that loose
[1:02:10] so you understand where a Believer is he
[1:02:12] knows where he's at
[1:02:16] ain't that right see faith is not that
[1:02:18] loose it's got to be based upon some
[1:02:20] noted fact you've got to know something
[1:02:23] about what you're having faith in before
[1:02:25] you can have faith in it
[1:02:27] so we first must know how and what what
[1:02:30] God's desire is what God's plan is and
[1:02:33] how to approach God by that plan
[1:02:37] then when we walk up boldly to the to
[1:02:39] the throne of grace and plead what the
[1:02:41] plan is promised to us we shall have
[1:02:45] what we've asked
[1:02:48] so God got tired of messing with the
[1:02:51] people
[1:02:52] so he called the halt he got tired of
[1:02:55] the people messing around so he called a
[1:02:57] halt and you know what he done when he
[1:02:58] called the heart he sent a prophet
[1:03:01] now I want you to realize that's what's
[1:03:02] happening in our day
[1:03:04] he sent a prophet
[1:03:06] he says when God's people gets in
[1:03:08] trouble listen now when God's people
[1:03:11] gets in trouble God always sends them a
[1:03:13] prophet with a true word to bring them
[1:03:14] out
[1:03:16] now you realize God ain't gonna send
[1:03:18] another Prophet right
[1:03:21] he sent this Prophet to get us to select
[1:03:24] out of our trouble
[1:03:25] [Applause]
[1:03:27] it's never a time that God's people ever
[1:03:29] gets in trouble unless God sends them
[1:03:31] his word
[1:03:32] God always in every case sends the
[1:03:35] people a true servant a true Prophet
[1:03:38] that'll bring them the true word of God
[1:03:40] and the word of God is what delivers the
[1:03:43] people always
[1:03:45] can you say Amen so the intellectual
[1:03:47] mind will not deliver the people
[1:03:49] psychology will not deliver the people
[1:03:51] politics will not deliver the people
[1:03:53] military force will not deliver the
[1:03:56] people always the prophet with the word
[1:03:59] of God will deliver God's people
[1:04:04] now notice what the prophet said man is
[1:04:06] not surviving by military power man
[1:04:09] survives by the power of the
[1:04:11] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:13] not by military power and by sputniks
[1:04:17] and so forth we survive and live by the
[1:04:22] power of Jesus Christ
[1:04:25] oh
[1:04:26] this bride
[1:04:29] God hewed us out
[1:04:32] that we would survive only by his power
[1:04:37] where's the power at today Luke 21 25
[1:04:41] and there shall be signs in the Sun and
[1:04:43] the Moon and in the stars and upon the
[1:04:45] Earth's distress of nations with
[1:04:47] perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring
[1:04:49] men's Hearts failing them for fear and
[1:04:52] for looking after those things which are
[1:04:53] coming on the earth for the powers of
[1:04:55] Heaven shall be shaken are we here then
[1:04:58] shall they see the son of man coming in
[1:05:00] a cloud
[1:05:01] foreign
[1:05:03] with power
[1:05:05] everybody say with power and great glory
[1:05:08] and you know what in another place
[1:05:11] brother Branham said he is coming in
[1:05:12] power for the bride
[1:05:15] he's coming in power for the bride
[1:05:22] don't it make you want to just get rid
[1:05:23] of all the world
[1:05:25] don't want to make you just want to get
[1:05:26] rid of everything all the excess and
[1:05:28] just stay right there in his word
[1:05:30] that's where the power is he's coming in
[1:05:33] power for his bride
[1:05:35] Church we're getting ready to leave here
[1:05:37] can you say Amen
[1:05:39] amen I read this uh this morning but
[1:05:41] National Force put Israel in her
[1:05:43] Homeland National Force put the church
[1:05:45] in the world Council of churches but the
[1:05:47] power of God will put the people in The
[1:05:49] Bride the world forces this way the
[1:05:52] world forces that way but God forces
[1:05:54] upward the spirit of God which is the
[1:05:56] word of God my word is spirit and life
[1:05:58] will put the bride in her place because
[1:06:00] she'll recognize her position in the
[1:06:02] word then she's in Christ we'll put her
[1:06:04] in her place and no National Force will
[1:06:07] do it can you say man and did you know
[1:06:10] what brother Brown has called this power
[1:06:11] that has come astronaut power
[1:06:15] that is lifting us up off from the world
[1:06:18] We Are Spiritual astronauts
[1:06:23] can you say Amen notice the prophet said
[1:06:26] she is getting resurrected power in her
[1:06:28] to fly beyond the things of the world
[1:06:29] seeing him out here in the church making
[1:06:32] himself the same yesterday today and
[1:06:34] forever I'm going to read that again
[1:06:36] because that's a powerful statement she
[1:06:38] is getting resurrected power in her
[1:06:43] where is it coming from seeing him
[1:06:47] in the church
[1:06:49] making himself the same yesterday today
[1:06:52] and forever and that power she's getting
[1:06:54] resurrected power to fly beyond the
[1:06:56] things of the world
[1:06:57] brother we're here

[1:07:02] it's over
[1:07:04] it's going home time
[1:07:06] and you say Amen
[1:07:08] this Bride is a believer
[1:07:10] do you believe it
[1:07:14] she's a Believer if the musicians will
[1:07:16] come
[1:07:17] brother Branham in 1962 now listen now
[1:07:20] this is before the seals this is this is
[1:07:23] in 1962 brother branham's foretelling
[1:07:26] now brother Brown said Jesus is so close
[1:07:28] to coming to the earth now until his
[1:07:31] power has begun to catch the people and
[1:07:34] winding them up getting them ready for
[1:07:36] the bride getting ready to be caught up
[1:07:39] in the Rapture a church that'll just fit
[1:07:42] just that'll fit just exactly to be
[1:07:45] taken up though it's through its power
[1:07:48] we'll draw all the rest of them that's
[1:07:50] born again out of the earth think of
[1:07:52] that that power that's abiding in you
[1:07:56] is the power that's going to draw the
[1:07:59] the Saints out of this Earth and we're
[1:08:01] going to be caught up to meet the Lord
[1:08:03] in the air can you say man you have to
[1:08:06] do something about this Resurrection
[1:08:09] you have something to do about this
[1:08:11] resurrection that power that is in you
[1:08:14] that you're yielding to is becoming so
[1:08:17] great in this bride
[1:08:20] that it's going to affect the Dead
[1:08:22] [Music]
[1:08:26] through its power we'll draw all the
[1:08:29] rest of them that's born again out of
[1:08:31] the Earth
[1:08:32] then you say man
[1:08:34] notice God sent the prophet the people a
[1:08:37] prophet and the word came to them
[1:08:40] and he called the people back to
[1:08:42] repentance and to an understanding that
[1:08:44] God was the a God was there that that
[1:08:47] God that their God was a god of Might
[1:08:50] and a god of Deliverance
[1:08:52] that Prophet The Prophet said reminded
[1:08:55] the people that God was the god of
[1:08:57] Miracles he snatched him out of the
[1:09:00] hands of the Egyptian he opened up the
[1:09:02] Red Sea and fed them in the wilderness
[1:09:05] can you say man
[1:09:07] how do you know you know
[1:09:10] do you know how he sensed
[1:09:13] Israel out of Egypt
[1:09:15] a prophet
[1:09:18] he sent him a prophet Moses
[1:09:21] and and I got to say this
[1:09:24] where we close
[1:09:26] you see for Israel for Egyptians when
[1:09:29] that Prophet come
[1:09:31] it was assigned to the Egyptian that
[1:09:33] their power had come to an end
[1:09:34] [Music]
[1:09:37] tell the people of of God for 400 years
[1:09:39] or over
[1:09:41] but when the Prophet come on the scene
[1:09:43] it was a sign to that enemy that his
[1:09:45] power had come to an end no more to be
[1:09:48] Israel Egypt never rose up again as a
[1:09:52] superpower
[1:09:53] it was over because God sent a prophet
[1:09:57] can you say Amen
[1:09:59] listen and the prophet's brother Brown
[1:10:01] said Moses was a sign Moses stayed with
[1:10:04] the Lord he was assigned he was assigned
[1:10:07] to Israel that their day of Deliverance
[1:10:09] was at hand
[1:10:10] he was assigned to Egypt that third day
[1:10:13] uh that the day of their end was at hand
[1:10:16] because they drowned there in the Dead
[1:10:18] Sea later the whole Army of pharaoh they
[1:10:21] were in at the end of their military
[1:10:24] power and a prophet was a sign of a
[1:10:27] national end
[1:10:29] do you realize our Prophet is the same
[1:10:30] way we stand here today
[1:10:33] our Prophet stood here in this age as a
[1:10:35] sign of national end
[1:10:37] but not only as a national end but the
[1:10:39] end of the world
[1:10:41] and the end of your suffering on the end
[1:10:44] of your slavery on the end of everything
[1:10:46] that has has bound you it's an end he
[1:10:49] was a sign that it was an end your
[1:10:52] Victory is here
[1:10:56] can you say Amen
[1:10:59] we're standing at that place again
[1:11:03] no more slave to the Enemy No More being
[1:11:05] a victim of circumstance
[1:11:07] oh my
[1:11:09] God and the prophet reminded the people
[1:11:12] that God had
[1:11:15] taken a people
[1:11:18] that was dwelling in a certain land and
[1:11:20] defeated them and gave the land over to
[1:11:22] them
[1:11:23] you say man
[1:11:25] God took the land from someone else and
[1:11:27] gave it to them God LED them to the land
[1:11:29] and gave that land to them under a
[1:11:31] prophet's message
[1:11:33] and listen did not God do the same thing
[1:11:35] for us in this age
[1:11:36] did he not
[1:11:38] what Luther had
[1:11:40] they no longer have
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:11:43] Walt Wesley had
[1:11:45] what the Pentecostals had has been taken
[1:11:48] from them and has been given to the
[1:11:50] people that's been called for his
[1:11:51] namesake
[1:11:53] the Revival that they had no longer the
[1:11:56] move of God whatever Supernatural power
[1:11:58] they had is gone but where is the
[1:12:00] Revival at today in this bride
