remaineth therefore a rest do the people of God for he that has entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his amen I want us to speak this evening on rest a very simple thought let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you tonight for your many blessings that you have given us thank you for this opportunity to stand behind this sacred desk again Lord and how we love this congregation and and father we're just so honored to have friends over here in Virginia and I just pray Lord that you would help me as I would speak tonight that I would say something that would be of benefit to everyone Lord that your glory would be with us God if there's any sick among us we ask that you would heal if there's any discourage we're asked that you would encourage I pray Lord that the anointing of the Holy Spirit would be with us Lord both speaker and hearer we love you Lord and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen I I've been dealing along the Oneness of of God and man for just a for a little while now and I'm not really um a teacher like brother Sean and um uh not near the preacher is he and and brother Andrew but um my my thoughts here uh I want to deal a little bit tonight on rest I I think 2023 I want it to be the year of rest for God's people amen arrest arresting of the soul the amen that that rest of the soul that regulates the thoughts and the emotions of the flesh now the Old Testament amen a type of the believer's position in Christ was the Sabbath amen it was it was a day of rest there was six days of Labor amen now six days of Labor six means a man it's a man's number amen it's man laboring and striving to to Really to no avail the uh their the the the wisest man or that that ever lived Solomon he said amen all is Vanity he all comes and all all goes to an end so anything that man has a man ends in vanity and death and sorrow so so six days of Labor that's that's man's number but the seventh day man was to rest from all his labor so they they he had that one day that seventh day amen it was the completion of the week it was the it was the ending of the six days of Labor and it was a resting from all the labors where you could rest and be in the presence of God Amen there was a there was a Sabbath for the land for the land to rest there was uh amen so so the Sabbath was was important because it was dealing with the rest that God was going to give his people now we know that that is just a type of you and me because we are in that sixth day amen we are man and everything about man is laborious amen we we labor we have to struggle where we strive to breathe we strive to to continue to live everything about man is is a striving where we can't live forever you have to you have to keep painting your house you have to keep uh your your car up you have to keep everything up everything is is is a constant labor Amen in order to keep things up can you say man so but when it comes to your soul Christ wanted to give you a rest amen arrest a seventh day Amen brother brother Brandon would say this entering in is not only an entering in but a remaining in amen the Bible teaches us about the Sabbath wrath rest for he that is entered into his rest amen it's not so it's not only an entering end but a remaining in the rest it's an eternal rest of which the seventh day is but a type seven is completion eight is the first day again and Jesus resurrection was on the first day of the week giving us eternal life and eternal Sabbath thus we see why God could not give us any one certain day of the week as the Sabbath rests amen we've entered into and do remain in our rest which Israel could not do having only a shadow of the true substance which we enjoy why go back to a shadow which we have a reality now how can we receive the rest or the continuing Sabbath is an invitation of Jesus Amen there in in Matthew 11 and 28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of Me Jesus says and you shall find rest or the keeping of the Sabbath not a day but eternal life the Sabbath unto your souls Amen brother Adam says don't matter how long you have been laboring under the load of sin whether it is 10 years 30 years or 50 years or longer amen would you come with your tired weary life and you will find his rest the true Sabbath Jesus will give you rest I want to tell you something tonight the world is looking for a rest but there's only one rest and that's in Jesus Christ amen we're not coming to church looking for a rest we come to church because we have found that rest in Christ we have found him to be the satisfier of the soul we'll praise the Lord amen there they're in Isaiah it talked about amen this coming rest that was coming and brother Brandon would say it would come to pass about 700 years later at Pentecost when they were all filled with the Holy Ghost exactly as it was said they would be that is the true Sabbath that was promised thus when they were filled with the Holy Ghost they ceased from the worldly works the worldly doings their evil ways and the Holy Ghost took charge of their lives and they entered into rest there is your rest that is your Sabbath it's not a day nor a year but the eternity of being feel and blessed in the Holy Spirit oh he says it is you ceasing and God doing amen it is God in you willing and doing of his good pleasure I see tonight there is a rest for the people of God oh God don't want us anxious in her heart anxious in her soul God wants us living in a rest that only he can be Amen brother radam talks about being in Christ believing I I I love this quote here that I'm fixing to read you amen he says now he says Jesus going to the lady the grave of Lazarus he said I am I am the resurrection and life he that believeth in me though he be dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth in me not on me but in me being in him be leaving if you abide in me and my words in you in him believing he says oh my I hope the Holy Spirit gets that right down to you can you say Amen so we're not believing on Christ but we have been baptized into this sabbath we have been baptized into the life-giver when you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost you have been baptized into rest when you've been baptized into the Holy Ghost the Eternal powers of God are all around you well glory to God that should make you want to shout hey man he's just believing in him you cannot believe in him until you come in him or he comes in you and then you're believing in him then you have eternal life you're believing on him until you receive eternal life and then eternal life is God's life in you you are believing in him well glory to God Amen the Apostle Paul says Aaron First Corinthians 12 and 13 by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body Jesus Christ can you say Amen what is what does baptize me it means submers it doesn't mean sprinkle it doesn't mean poor but it means to bury yourself well glory to God you realize that when you are baptized by the power of the Holy Spirit you are now engulfed in everything that God is you are now engulfed in every Hall of God's Eternal Powers you have surrounding you abiding now it's not work related some people say well in order to be in him you have got to pray every day that's abiding in him some people would say reading the Bible is abiding in him man good deeds is abiding in him but these are all simply these are simply tokens of your love to him that doesn't that doesn't make you anything to do with Christ can you say man use the things you do because you love him amen but you have to be baptized into him because God's looking for a Oneness amen God's desire for Redemption is to bring you back to your original position of being God again amen you are the miniature gods that he created to put here on the earth he didn't call you amen he said in a Pew and amen and you know and go through the motions but God called you to be at one with him and the only way you're going to be at one of them the only way you're going to find rest is to come into him can you see man in him oh I want to be lost in him hey Faith I want I want Stephen and swear I can't find my way back out hallelujah amen some you know when you go snorkeling sometimes you can get things can get a little bit scary even you go under the water and you think oh what if I go under a rock or what if I go under this and I never come back out hey remember when you when you dive into God when you dive into Christ I want to get lost in it I don't ever want to come back out again I I don't want to see things the way I used to see things I don't want to understand things the way that I used to understand things I want to be lost in his love church if we were ever getting lost in his love and we find that presence of God and we are so surrounded we would never see life again the way this world sees it I think we should pray like Jonah prayed amen he says that was cast me in the Deep in the midst of the Seas and the floods come past me about and all thy Billows and thy waves passed over me I say God let me be that let the holy spirit so take me in let me be so overwhelmed so submersed into the presence of God into that Eternal Fountain so swallowed up into Christ until he is my every thought until he's my ever pattern unto my every desire is him until everything that I I in my in him I move and I live and I have my being in him is where my desires and in him is where it is where I find my joy at can you see man amen listen who can surpass the depths of that great Fountain when you come to that Fountain you will never thirst again when you come to that Fountain oh come on church it's the very source of Grace it's the very source of love it's the very source of power it's the very source of eternal life when you come to that Fountain get lost in it hey it's not quotes in Bible verses I believe it was the Apostle Paul says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or any man nakedness or Pearl or sword I am persuaded somebody say I am I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor principalities nor angels nor anything present anything to come shall ever separate me from the love of God I don't care whether it's the Heights or the depths he says nothing shall separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus can you say man you see God's desire was to provide rest now we want rest from our jobs and we need those but the rest that we need is for our souls it's the soul of man that is constantly struggling come on Church a good Hard Day's Work Ain't Gonna Hurt none of us but it's this right here Amen in that heart the heaviness of the heart oh come on Church Hallelujah but do you realize that when the Dove came down and landed upon Christ it was once again Heaven and Earth kissing one another it was God's holy spirit the devil's always symbol peace and rest it was the Holy Spirit resting Upon A man oh can you say man there's never been a time since Adam's fall that the dove could settle down upon a man and continue There oh come on now there's been doves that's come there's been Birds that's come and gone but this one the scripture made it very clear amen God told the prophet he says the one that you see the dove descending upon and remaining he's the one that's going to baptize into my rest he's the one that is going to baptize with the Holy Spirit oh come on Church oh we struggle too much amen we struggle and we win and we push and we scribe and we struggle amen when God is looking for you to take your position as Sons and Daughters of God can you say Amen the day the dove come brother Branham said Heaven and Earth kissed not mean much to you but knows that they're asked was coming to all of God's seed oh ye that are weary and you're heavy laden come unto me I'm the Sabbath I'm the baptizer I'm the one I'm God's gift to humanity to bring them back back into that rightful place free of condemnation free of distress free sin free free I'm Bracken to a rust oh come into me there's no condemnation in me come into me there's no tiredness of your soul in me coming to me Satan can't get to you in me hey hey man or do you love him amen yes now brother Branham would say he said now many bypassed that scripture but to me it's one of the most outstanding scriptures of the Bible That's when Heaven and Earth embraced when God came down in the form of a dove and went upon his son in the form of a lamb why did he choose the lamb and the dove because the dove could not abide with anything else but the lamb their Natures are the same and that's the reason the two could get along together their Natures were meek and humble and lowly and that's why they could dwell together when God and Christ became one when the Dove came and down on the lamb Heaven and Earth kissed each other God and Adam was reconciled together when you're baptized into him is the only time that you can ever become a lamb until then you're striving you're stickery yeah can't get along with anybody Hallelujah come on come on you can't you couldn't even get along with yourself before you got the Holy Ghost but Jesus was the first of the new creation Jesus didn't need to be born again he came that germ word seed right from the world oh but you are born again you're born of not the sexual seed but The Incorruptible seed of the word of God can you say man now your nature is a nature that doesn't just get along with God but you get along with yourself and you get along with your husband and you get along with your wife and you get along with Mom and Daddy and you get well praise the Lord some of us need to come into Christ well brother just come on into Christ he will give you rest for your souls yeah Hallelujah I've got some grandbabies amen I used to have kids but they're gone so now I've got these grand babies and they get so cranky and and when they get tired they'll get cranky and the little lovable little lovable thingamajiggers turns into tyrants they're mad they can't get along with nobody they can't oh my goodness huh you tell them come here Hallelujah Hallelujah and who are they looking for well I wish they were looking for poppy but they were looking for Mama looking for their mommy why they come out of mine is that long that can love them do you do you not realize Jesus says I come from God laughs and I'm going back to God do you realize that you came from God that you were the Egypt you are part of the genetics of God the Eternal Gene seed of God was there in your heart when you were created when you were brought forth in in your sexual birth can you say man amen but there you you you're you're you're you're bound in a present House of enmity you're bound in a prison House of Labor you are a man and man is the number of six it is labor but the Sabbath was coming and when the Sabbath comes this sabbath the right it's Papa coming to you and say Come All You that are weary God all you that labor come God come unto me I will give you that but what do we do faith we kick and scream come on you ever get cranky not you but Ruthie does no Ruthie don't get cranked okay so Mama that gets cranky amen now just joking we get laboring in our spirit come on the Christ has come to give us rest and you realize when that little baby comes up and I love it when they come to Poppy and they'll come up and I'll just lay I sit there and I'll hold them and I said you know what poppy loves you I said you know what mommy loves you you know what and they just all and then all of a sudden they're snoring they're sleeping they're resting God says come I want to give you and if God gave it to the to them the man Adam and told him you're going to labor for six days old Church of the Living God if we could just look at that type we have been on Earth for six days six thousand years and we're fixing to go into that Millennium we're fixing to have a day of rest no more labor no more worry no more heartache No More Death no more sorrow no more sickness we will be with him amen Hallelujah can you say man now so the new birth takes the old Stony heart and gives us the heart of a lamb you know he says now the reason they could dwell together the Bible says he saw the spirit of God like a dove and he said the Lamb of God Behold the Lamb of God the Dove came on the lamb and abode I like that abiding now if it was a lamb if the lamb would have snorted like a wolf or the dove wouldn't would have gone been gone and you know sometimes I wonder if that's the reasons that there's so much trouble in the church if we are the Lambs of God we should have the nature of lambs if we expect the dove to abide do you believe it amen he's asking the congregation do you believe it I'm asking you do you believe it and then brother Branham says I do if we'll watch that Dove the reason it stayed on the lamb because their Natures was the same and the reason that the dove stays on Christian Old Church of the Living God the reason the doves oh amen somebody say in him resting in him rest is the settleness of heart rest has the confidence that everything is okay rest is I am his creation rest is Philippians 1 and 6 being confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work and you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ resting is Psalms 40 and 2. he brought me out of a horrible pit out of the my reclaim and has sent me my feet upon a rock and established my goings rest yeah and he put a new song in my mouth he even prays into our God many shall see it in fear and Trust can you say Amen it's no wonder when you come into him the scripture says the fruit of the spirit now he gives us the fruit of the flesh and then and and then the Apostle gives us the fruit of the spirit now this is both happening in the same in a body the fruit of the flesh he's enmity and strife jealousy murder and can you say man but with the dove coming Upon Us whole church now he says there's another fruit coming out naked and it says but the fruit they're in Galatians 5 and 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law it's no wonder that Jesus is there in John 15 and 7. if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done why because God and man have come together once again hey man hey man all right it's God to himself oh Church throw your Labor's behind throw your trucks down and run to Daddy through all of your nonsense away and come into him who gives and baptizes us into rest [Music] young man young woman I know the pressure's on us I know you young men and you young women the pressure is on you to conform to this world but it's all vanity it's all vanity and you find yourself fighting so when the when the pressure and the peer pressure is pulling on you to come one way Hallelujah and you happen to fight against the will of God and you're fighting over here oh it's a struggle to be torn in between two opinions it's a struggle when Satan's pulling on over you here and God's over here and you're here in the middle and you know you belong over here and you know the door is wide open but at the same time your will is wanting to come this way but I say denying oh God surrender that what Jesus had to come to that he said not not my will but thy will be done I want to please you I want that rest in you can you say man and Church of the Living God there remains a rest there remains a rest in 2023 there remains a rest for your soul [Applause] amen now Jesus says I'm come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness that word abide is to continue without fading to continue without being lost that what abide means to live in to dwell to endure to remain permanent steadfast to abide is opposite of fade disappear short-lived to abide is the opposite of here today and going tomorrow to abide is the opposite of having Joy today and upset tomorrow Amen to abide is is is is opposite of starting in Christ and then over here and having the prophet say who hath Bewitched you foolish Galatians permanent place it's not a tent it's not here today and going tomorrow you're living in a world of here today I'm going tomorrow but you are baptized into eternal life therefore there's nothing I see there's no turmoil around me there is nothing that is going to take me from that gentleness that sweetness that preciousness of the Holy Spirit I want to love I want to give I want to be everything that he is amen everything you are I am now baptized into I have a right to love I have a right to Joy I have a right to these things I'm living in it hey man come on can you see man it's no wonder that the command of God is to be ye steadfast how how could God expect that faith of us humans who are up and down and up and down and up how could God say Dee steadfast right because the labor is over you've been baptized into the logos himself do you realize that when you receive the logos or when you receive the Holy Ghost it is the very same spirit that was in Christ Jesus it's the life of the word in you Jesus the Apollo brother random said it he said you are baptized into that Lucas there's no labor is living its life in you just exactly like it was through Jesus Christ well praise the Lord I know y'all weren't expecting much on a Wednesday night but here it is Hallelujah living at him living his Divine Life In Need pulling his power through me conquering this flesh through me brother Branham says if I could get the world to see that why there you are it's the body of Christ Living standing redeemed redeemed whom I justified in the sight why are we Justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in these last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for it and we are the proof of his victory well that should make you want a shot I'd give you permission right now if y'all want to get up and do a little jig like this you can't Hallelujah we are his he has brought the rest you were in the prison house you were in Chains you were in Chains of of of of alcohol you were in Chains of perversion you were in Chains of jealousy you were in Chains of bitterness but he has come to give you the victory the lamb and the dove has come in one again brother Benham gives himself a big amen amen when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory it shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave and neither can they keep us we're already potentially raised because we've been raised from the dead unbelief in in in his word from denomination and Cree to the Eternal Word of the Eternal God which is himself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever can I hear an amen man they're stressed he said that's God's purpose his purpose has father Supreme was to be one with his family his Earthly family Adam and Eve and the only way they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in him so that made them with God's nature in them and then with each other and God they'll become a one isn't it a beautiful picture God in his family father over all Supreme no death no sorrow no heartache no nothing just joy unspeakable never sick never have a heartache just one God what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people now he's given us the clear he's given us what made the difference now watch he says now and Jesus prayed in John 17 chapter 11 verse you want to put the verse down for Sunday school's text I have many of them this morning but Saint John 17 11. Jesus prayed that the church and he would be one like he and the father were one that church that the church we as the members of his body of Christ would be one together just like he and the father are one at that day they will know that he was in the father or the father in him and he in us and that together we were one shout yes amen what a union a Oneness that would be uh to see God in his church till every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other and with God that's the church that Jesus is coming for oh yeah one not me here and God here and baptized into him we're one now he says now it's not that you're one as my finger Hallelujah and Jesus was not as one as your finger Jesus and God hallelujah praise the Lord I mean now the trinitarians have got God the Father God the son got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah claiming that the father was the father of Jesus that's how he got his name father but then of course when you read there in Matthew the first chapter the Bible says in two different places in that first chapter that he was that she that he was born of the Holy Ghost so now we've got two guys flirting with the same girl amen so we've got God the Father claiming to be the father and we got God the Holy Ghost claiming to be the father does that make sense to y'all so let's just go and get the third person out Hallelujah so now we've got God the Father amen the father God and we've got the son Jesus Christ and my scripture and my own scripture here father God and the son Jesus Christ that says that that's the way we believe it on that day on the on the Jordan River when God came down he is now living in the body he's now living in the body of Jesus one not one in a way that God died on Calvary God can't die Jesus says my father why hast Thou forsaken me the God had to leave that body so he could die a sinner's death for you come on now then he raised him up we'll praise the Lord the Apostle Paul says he is the image of the invisible God you'll never see God but you'll find his body come on now it pleased the father that in him should all the fullness dwell God created a body and he poured all of his glory in that body come on church he poured all of his glory in that body Oh Glory to God you'll never seek any other God than the God Jesus Christ hey because Christ Jesus and his body are now synonymous with God God will never leave that buddy but in this last day he's built himself a bride Hallelujah I wish I had me another cup Hallelujah and now here's his bride and he says I'm going to pour all of my glory inside that bride everything Christ is you will be in fact this is the bride coming of Jesus you don't see him you don't see him he's there he's there in the heavens that body is still there but that same Spirit Well glory to God Hallelujah now I'm just a member and you're just a member and you're just a member but together we all this is the reason why you have got to be baptized into him because you won't get along with each other without come on that's the reason why every family that's the reason why you married couples or are you you teenagers you better pick somebody with the Holy Ghost can you say man they'll never they'll never understand you but there's coming a reunion where that physical body is going to come and this body is going to meet him in the air come on oh come on all of that Glory all of his presence in you God is looking for a Oneness between you and him it must be his prayer was that you would be just as same in Oneness as he and God were the same in Oneness Jesus said it's my will it's not it's it's my meat to do the will of the father I do nothing except he foreshow me can you say Amen now brother Branham says the only grounds of Fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself in his church is the Oneness of himself and the people that's the only grounds of fellowship and the only way that you can ever come on you can have those grounds is by a union to be United with him forever and just like when you Unite with your husband the woman to unite with their husband it's a valentil death and now then when you Unite with God it's the same thing that the church United with Christ until death we part somebody shout hallelujah and then if you never sin or do anything wrong you're eternally United and he's talking about the willfully sinning there he goes on to share that we're going to have our ups and our Downs we're going to we're going to fail we're going to make a mistake but that's what the blood was for and only death can take you away from God not physical death but this the sin of death sin is death and that takes you away from God so to be United with him in the spirit of his power is eternal life you're eternally United with god oh I want that to I want to get to that after a while United eternally with eternal God and perfectly in harmony with him perfectly United together a church that all both God and his church is one United together we'll praise the Lord no he's going to share with us can I have a little more time he's going to share with us this was all a part of predestination he said just as Adam had both masculine and feminist spirit I know this is Elementary but I'm it but it's but it but it's good for what I'm saying here just as Adam and Eve were in Adam's spirit he was female and male can you say Amen Hallelujah not in body but in fact in in spirit then God separated it and put it in that body now brother Brandon would put it this way he says now notice Eve United with Adam Genesis 1 27 he created the male male and female the man male and female created them amen both male and female when it come to being Spirit the man was uh uh both male and female when it came to being in spirit a finished masculine then God took from the side a rib did you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished God took from the side of Adam a ribbon made the woman but not the spirit the spirit was part of the original well pray I I just want to shout right now the spirit was a part of Adam for he was both man and woman spiritually speaking but masculine and feminine don't you see the great picture we in flesh are different we're a byproduct we're created being by holy wedlock but in the spirit we are Sons and Daughters of God not some other Spirit but the spirit of the Living God we are in his likeness we are in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become Sons and Daughters not separated but the Same Spirit the same God the same person joined in wedlock to the eternal see how God planned it to be not different not different some of you are wondering how can God pour all of him and then God then Christ pours himself in the air now we've got an empty body in the godhead and you were part of him the feminist side was taken from God and placed in a body same foreign thoughts come into you when you're baptized into that rest can you say Amen now do you love him a woman outside of the headship of her husband is in labor it's a struggle it's a struggle that sisters you're not supposed to struggle you're to rest in him if you love him and you respect him then honor his his leadership on her his direction that he is leading you as a family don't ever get married boys don't get married if you can't be a leader teenage girls don't get more or you you unmarried girls don't get married until you know a guy that you can love that you can respect because you're not supposed to labor he does all the laboring for you you say well around our house I can die now you know I have to labor on the stove and I have to label oh but listen here listen here you you just rest he's taking care of all of the hard stuff and you're just taking care of making him look pretty and fat and giving him rest his responsibility take care of you that's his responsibility come on and you men should never be looking at you why I live in all this all this you fat thing you you have called you have chosen her to be your girl there's no friction together masculine and feminine and together you're walking and conquering can you say that ain't no fat girls in the church amen so y'all quit looking at you waiting amen somebody's saying who was he talking to right I will go on preaching Hallelujah now he said see how God planned it that we should be not a different but him not some other being of some other tribe but a real Union an offspring of the almighty done by a holy Union and the body comes from father and mother but the spirit come from God God separating himself as Adam was created somebody shout hallelujah yes there's no more labor he's provided it then he goes on and tells us how it came from here to here he says on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire separating itself and setting upon each of them remember remember the great Pillar of Fire came down upon him in him dwelt the fullness of all the godhead masculine and feminine in him was the fullness of the godhead masculine and feminine demon did not did did not Jesus say is it not written in your laws where I said ye are gods he was talking about there in in Psalms your Gods but you die like men can you say Amen separating itself and setting up with each of the member of the church God here we go somebody punch your neighbor and tell them this is going to get good right here God putting himself together then when that group of people together what does it do it brings back the unified body of the Lord Jesus joined in Heavenly wedlock to the Eternal God well if you ain't going to shout I am hallelujah amen oh isn't that just wonderful amen I'm here to tell you amen let this be the year come on church this is the beginning this is this is January 2023. let this be the year of no condemnation let this be the year of I believe God regardless let this be the year of rest amen brother random says no there's one thing the Tabernacle needs up there at our church at the Tabernacle of Jeff is a rededication and refilling of the Holy Ghost that's right everyone to get down to the Altar and pray until we get a renewing of the Holy Ghost the holy the whole church be filled with the power of God that's what we need not only the Tabernacle there but the body of Christ Universal it needs a refilling David said one day restore to be the joy of my salvation now he had not lost his salvation but the joy of it and when it come to a place that when I can't enjoy my religion my salvation there's something wrong somewhere because it is joy unspeakable and full of Glory one of them said taste and see that the Lord is good it tastes like Honey in the Rock oh I'm so glad that I've tasted that the Lord is good I love honey but I've never tasted any like that that's the best that I know Hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God aren't you glad that you're living in this world of perversion you're living in this world oh but you're living in a world all alone with you and God amen amen another place brother random says the holy spirit is here if you've Fallen weak and lukewarm in your experience and you'd like to be renewed Again David said restore to me the joy of my salvation he had not lost to Salvation but he lost the joy and I think that goes to about 95 percent of the church today another place he says in order to stay with God stay gentle God is gentle in order to stay with God stay with love God is love stay meek never be self-sufficient always rely upon him never use your own mind take his thoughts let his thoughts be your thoughts hey man are you seeing where rest comes from Oneness rest Jesus could give rest because he was at one with the father you can fulfill your purpose here on this Earth and when the world doesn't understand it there is such a peace that passes all understanding are y'all hearing me tonight Hallelujah Hallelujah the world all going every which direction a woman came to brother Branham now sometimes we get we we get caught up how many ever gets caught up in this old flesh maybe I maybe I ain't got the right kind of glasses on because I sure didn't see anybody Amen in a reason buddy I'm still living I'm still living in this byproduct and this byproduct can sure try to get me out of those heavenly places Amen brother Branham a woman in was really condemned she had fallen and was wallowing and guilt and she had came and she said can you lay hands on me or she sent it in in question answers in 62 can you lay handsome I've fallen and brother Brandon says yes yes sister brother who whoever wrote this if you're falling down there that don't mean you're lost you're just an ego got into the pen that's all you're caged up down there in sin again you don't want to be there that's the reason you're looking upward there you are oh brother Branham I once lived up there is there a way here yes brother Branham says and he puts it about like that yes reminds me of one day oh a little boy I was walking around behind the farm somebody had tied an Old Crow to keep him out of the Corn a little fellow just about starved to death and I I couldn't I couldn't be that mean to do that I told he tied the old crow by the foot and the old fella had eat everything that was around and and he couldn't he couldn't get nothing else and the farmer had just left him and he was so poor he couldn't even get up crows flying over and said call call in other words come on Johnny Crow winter time is coming let's go south but he couldn't do it because he was tired so one day a certain fella came by and seen the poor poor old crow and he went over there and caught him and untied him and he says go on boy you're free so then the first thing you know he kept walking around and these little crows over hollering come on Johnny Crow call call call let's go south the Winter's coming you're going to freeze to death and he could look or look back and say can't do it see he had been so used to being tired see he just thought he was still tired and let me just let me just hit this thing hard I don't care what Satan has done in your life I I don't care what cut maybe maybe you have been going around a mountain and deep inside your heart you have been saying I just want rest I want peace I want to tell you the Holy Spirit has already cut the rope Satan wants to keep an eye Satan wants to keep you in condemnation he wants to keep you in condemnation but for God's sake God says live that life the way you are Desiring to live it down deep in here spirit you're trying to judge yourself by your mistake and by this it's time to take it all to the blood and get rid of it all and say God I will go free man you'll do it for every one of you you'll do it to every one of us can you say man now he says you may think you're tied too brother sister that wrote this question you may think the devil has got you tied down here but he's lying there's one time a man came to work Jesus Christ the son of God he untied you don't you believe it do you you don't have to stay down there no sir you're free that's right he died in your place to take away your sins you just believe him and flop on flop your wings and fly away with the rest of them don't stay in the pit of the devil no sir now will you lay hands upon me and free me from that sister dear or brother dear sure odd lay hands on you but that would not free you what would free you is to understand that you are you're already free you're already untied you don't have to worry about being free you're already free Jesus made you free don't be entangled in the Yoke of bondage seat you're free as can be you don't have to be Tangled Up can I hear an amen [Applause] laying my hands on you as a tradition you might we might do it and that while I could do that but that won't that still won't set you free until you accept what he has done for you and that's just me saying Lord I believe it well you just lay lay your hands by faith upon him and say Lord I believe it like I hope you come that's right confess your sins see he that hides his sins will not Prosper covers his sins but he that will confess his sins there's where you get the freedom and the justification is when you're willing to say I've sinned I'm wrong and that's what you've just said here I've fallen I've sinned I'm dead wrong is there a chance for me to be whole again and brother random said absolutely the minute that you desire it that shows that God dropped a Lifeline down to pick you up ah why he's at one with you you are his purpose can you say man the minute you desire it amen just rise up on me his Lifeline of faith and prayer and move right on up into the rest with the arrest the Eagles like that and go flopping away that's right yes laying on of hands is a great thing I believe in it I believe in the laying on of hands I sure do but that isn't what does it I could lay hands on people week in and week out and still it would do no but until you accept it what Christ did for you can you say man if my words if you abide in me and my words abide in you how are those words going to abide in you that's when the logos himself comes down and lives in you the message of this day lived through mortal beings like you amen mortal beings it's not you making it it's not me making it brother Branham says if there's ever been an age that should be zealous to repent repent it's this age he says if there's ever an age that you'd expect the supernatural it should be this age you know why oh because in the evening time it shall be light rest is come to the elect of God we've been shown who we are who he is and we're standing upon it it's when we can come how long have I been amen boy I've gotten long-winded amen it's when we can come to the reality and look in the mirror of that word and as we're walking up as that boy walking up to that mirror never seen that mirror before never seen never seen nothing like this any waves and it waves back and he gets closer and Mama she's back behind in there watching and he's he's given enough and then he goes up and he touches it and he turns around to his mom and he says that's me that's me and we blunt oh we've always looked we've always we've looked Hallelujah stay and we've looked and we thought oh oh man there's something about that word could it be there's something oh wow oh it's just attracting me it's huh hey papa that's me [Applause] I'm part of the eternals that's who I am and if you are at one with God then you can ask what you will and it shall be done for it's not you and then him it is you in him [Applause] he says ye and me and I in you that they may be one father even as you and I are one God in Christ Christ in the church just as we are one so so they be one then how can you be one if you abide in me and my words abide in you my words in you then ask what you will it isn't you no more it's the word that's in you and the word is God can I hear an amen good it's a rest yes he says the word of God is a sword Hebrews the fourth chapter says amen for 12 he's known as a sword sword is perfectly dormant if it is yielded by if it isn't yielded by a hand or power but it takes a hand to hold the Sword and the hand that holds this sword is the hand of faith you can't have faith in condemnation you can't be you can't you can't be resting and laboring at the same time you've got to come into this rest and the Hand of faith it depends on how strong it is the hand of Faith might be just strong enough to cut a little hole through the darkness and save by faith I'm saved that's a great cut but then if that's all the stronger the hand is to yield that sword that's all it can cut but if it's a strong man it'll cut through everything the devil can put out there and make every promise of God shine forth in the power of his resurrection if it's a strong hand of Faith the days of Miracles Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it'll cut its way through it depends on the power of the hand behind the sword amen now I'm talking to you we know what this world will do we know this is right can I hear an amen but now he's saying if it ain't working it's the hand and the Hand can't have faith it's not walking with God you gotta walk with him on the job in the home in school can you say man are you hearing me when you watch he says now the sword is plenty Sharp it's plenty sharp I I I you just oh I just love it I just love it if you've got if you got an enemy coming about you if you're shamgar and the enemies around you and you've got that Ox gold and you know that you are you are you are the the the chosen seed of God and you know that there's righteous indignation coming up saying I can do this buddy there ain't nothing but I'm not talking about I'm not talking about the ox gold of shamgar I'm talking about the very sword of God is put in your hand what well prayed that sword has been put in your hand in this day when brother random when when the age of the Lord's trying to tell brother Brian about that third pool his name brother Brown is trying to think am I fixing to die this is explosion mean I'm dying what what does this mean and then God comes and he has his hands pray and then all of a sudden a sword hits him and he says oh and he's scared of a sword and he said well maybe maybe I'm supposed to Knight preachers or something and and and then the then the then the the words came across the canyon King just bawling across amen this is the King's sword this is just the fervance of your ministry well what did he do with that King's sword he came to Jeffersonville and he preached and he empowered you with the king's sword you can rest knowing that that sword come on in my house buddy I've got a hallelujah amen down in Texas you don't have to worry about nobody coming into your house amen it's a it's a shoot and ask later law amen someone's over there moving on your door handle just start shooting amen and I'm here to tell you it's about the time I don't know if that's exactly the law amen but I I I'm here to tell you it's about that weight we need to start doing that with the devil I'm not going to entertain you anymore you're not coming into my house anymore you're not opening my door anymore it is a shoot now and ask later law you are dying devil I've been equipped by the Holy Ghost I I've Got The Power I've got the sword and I'm willing to use it willing to use it how many is willing to use it use him on church are you willing hey man if the musicians would come he says if you've got a strong enough arm behind it that sword amenances now the word will cut in there if there's a strong enough by harm behind it to push it in it'll find its place and cut every promise out and give it to you if you've got the strong enough arm behind it the sword pick it up in the arm an arm of Faith grip it tight hold on to it and walk into the face of an enemy how can the uncircumcised enemy ever stand in the presence of the Eternal God I found a permanent place it's no wonder the Psalms 91 says he that dwelleth that word dwell means abide it's permanent he correct place of the most high she'd Under The Shadow [Music] of the almighty and I will say of the Lord he is my refuge my Fortress my God and him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler [Music] have I made any sense tonight rest he says the Christian faith is based Softly a Christian is not tossed about a Christian doesn't run from place to place a Christian doesn't fuss and few Christian doesn't worry about things a Christian rest it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary that's right sickness May comes and disappointments but the Christian at but the Christians at rest knowing this that God is able to keep that which he has performed knowing that no matter what the thing is how it looks there's neither sickness sorrow death there's neither starvation or anything can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus we're at rest Just Let The Old Ship tossed any way he wants she wants her holds Let It Go however it wants the anchor hosts let the enemy do what he wants The Anchor Holds oh come on church I just want to tell you we have an anchor of the Soul here tonight I'm talking about a genuine rest hallelujah it's a rest it's a rest hey man amen you talked about that he says it's seen I came to an arbor one time the big old ship was there and he said the sales had been let down you know and the storm on the sea mine she was a toss and I sing that Old Ship there rocking back and forth waves would go in some ways would go under and everything and I said wonder why that is the fella standing there said it's got a sea anchor on it therefore the ship can't sink it can go through the waves but it can't sink because it's anchored and I said oh praise be to God we got an anchor some ways can go over some we can go under but regardless if the anchor holds it isn't the ship doing the holding it's the anchor doing the holding it isn't what I am or what I will be or what I was it's what he is right now and what he did for me and you it can't it ain't what I can do
