day here at the church on the 25th of March which will be on a Saturday and a lot of work around the outside and so any of you brothers that would like to help we would love to have you and we'll welcome the help and if your sisters any of you would like to come and and do some cleaning here inside the church it would definitely be appreciated and so so just remember that March the 25th on Saturday and I think it's the last Saturday of March so they should be pretty easy to remember and our meetings are coming up and so uh just looking forward to what God has in store for us there and leaving God to do great things Amen in the Lord but before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father who is the author of this word Lord your prophetis that reading the Bible doesn't help us to understand if we if we aren't in love with the author I believe everyone this morning is Desiring a greater love for you I know I do Lord I I want to know you more I want that relationship to grow father for that's the only way Lord that we would really understand the Bible for it's a love letter Lord and if we can know your heart then we can really know the meaning of what you've spoken what you've written and I pray father that you would just be with us this morning father just come in a special way and and not only anoint myself as we would Minister the word but anoint those that would hear the word father and help us just to all be receptive and things that we may already know but father let it find a betting ground and in a young heart father may just stir up the the remembrance of her mind father we ask it Lord and we love you in Jesus Christ's name amen we want to turn to the book of Acts the first chapter I believe it is or the second chapter I should say and we're going to read a few verses here and um it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how here we every man in our own tongue we're in we were born if you go to the 12th uh verse here and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this others mocking said these men are full of new wine but Peter's standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judah Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose saying it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel so then if you'll go to this 37th verse now Peter the rest of these verses up to this 37th he's ministering uh and and preaching to them but here in the 37th verse it says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and do the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do in other words what shall we do to be saved they're asking the question and Peter's said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord are God shall call amen you can have your seats this morning and um I I want to say we want to keep brother Walker in our prayer as he's uh you know going through a lot of trial right now and making you know it's been uh he's having a major transition in his life and of course Sister Walker as well and they don't think that he will you know be able to go home and so um they're going to keep him at right now at the uh the place that he's at Pulaski Health and Rehabilitation Center and I don't know how long he will be there but eventually they're going to be putting him in a nursing home and I'm praying that he'll get to stay there you know and or somewhere close by you know but uh we we had got there the other day and so they were breaking the news to him and it's taking it pretty hard and uh so um so we we went in you know and so he's explaining to me and just his heart was just broke you know and um uh you know I I I about bald you know I was trying to keep it all in but it was just really heartbreaking sister Sue was there and Carla and the aid worker whoever she would be but you know I just try and told him said well let's look at the positive here you know if you stayed home if you're home at the four walls you ain't got nothing to do you know man you're still a minister and you can't preach you know behind the pulpit anymore you know last time we had him to preach here it really done him in and and he knew that he told his man I don't know if I could do that again and um and so he's a people's person he needs he needs people and so I really uh just encouraged him that I don't believe that God is done with him and uh that you know maybe God is you know as Christians we have to look at the purpose of God more than anything else and we have to rely on that and so you know I told him you know that the purpose of God may be for him to be in that place that maybe somebody could be reached through his ministry and um because I don't care how old you are you're still a minister because it's a gift it don't leave at a certain age and so as we begin to just to talk to him and and of course he you know he he was comparing his situation with my situation of losing my wife and and I had to tell him I said but that's not really the case I I said I you know my wife left I mean I can't talk to her I can't hold her hand I can't I can't do them things but you know sister Sue was right there I said you know she's she's there you know she'll be able to come and visit you she'll be able to come to see you you'll get to hear her voice you'll be able to hold her hand you'll be able to you know what I'm saying and so it really even though he was still shedding a little tears it it really helped him and so he told the the worker he says okay I'll stay and so when you if you go visit him just encourage him you know really pump him up and uh because he really needs that right now and I understand I I wouldn't want to you know leave my wife I mean the Lord's blessed me with a wonderful lady you know and uh there's a thought that I'd have to separate in way like that I don't know how I could take it but at the same time um this this must be the Lord's plan for him at this point and so you know he needs all of our encouragement if you have time to go visit him he needs that and um and I told him I'd assured him that we won't forget him you know it's it's not that at all and so I know he would appreciate that the other day uh sister Rihanna had texted me letting me know that the Lord had been dealing with her to be baptized and it just thrilled my heart to to to see that and so after service we're going to be uh Lord willing baptizing her and if there's anyone else that does feel the need to be baptized um you know we'd the water's there and so we would be glad to to do that though I have talked about baptism uh before I'm going to talk about it again and I always kind of like to do that just for the individual that may not um that if they're going to get baptized I want to make sure that I can explain it the best I know so they know beyond the shower without what they're doing and um you know and and so I'm going to to hit on it again um so we we know that baptism is one of the the three physical Divine orders that Jesus left us to do uh the other two uh are communion and foot washing and so these things that we are to do as Christian Believers and I I think we all believe that that even in in in spiritual or in communion it's not spiritual communion like many and some even in within the message ranks is leaning to that it's spiritual communion it's not it's it's a physical divine order of God that we would take that and so Peter in our opening scripture gives the formula as to what it takes to be born again a born-again Christian and and first of all he says repent then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost two two things that we are to do and that is repent that's something that we do in a um physical way if you want to say it that way and then be baptized but receiving the Holy Ghost no man can do that it's God that does that and and so uh but we see that baptism is essential in the process of being saved uh you cannot bypass baptism and be saved you you can't uh for this was the scripture or the question what shall we do and uh to be saved and then this was the formula repent be baptized and you shall receive to the gift of the Holy Ghost the prophet said you're not even converted until you receive the Holy Ghost potentially you are but you're not until you receive the Holy Ghost and so Mark 16 15 Jesus said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and so I I personally you know uh don't think that the devil would encourage anyone uh to get baptized as much as the devil doesn't encourage anyone to repent uh it's it's it's not just there and unless unless it's being baptized in titles or a a perverted way of doing things of baptism and then of of course he'll push you in in that direction but to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ there's I don't see there's any way that the devil encourages an individual uh uh to be baptized now he will encourage you to go to church he'll encourage you to do that he don't mind you doing that but uh to to follow the steps on being saved and and and these things he ain't going to do that um uh he'll get you messed up in some Doctrine you know uh just some off the wall thing but to really to follow the pattern of of the Gospel he he won't do that and so uh uh he would actually be the one to discourage a person uh to from obeying the the word of God so then we see that repentance is the first step and a person must repent before baptism can be effective in any way or have any meaning it's repentance before God and that's the first step that a person must receive and brother Branham said the first step is repentance towards God then follows after that is water baptism repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see water baptism follows showing that repentance was genuine I'll say that again water baptism shows that repentance was genuine or to remit our past sins and that has nothing to do with future sin it only remits past sins so repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for what remission everybody say remission so see taking away of past sin has nothing to do with the future just your sin has been chopped off of what you've done see you can't repent for what Adam done you've never done it Adam did it you just get forgiveness for what you've done ain't that right so then again baptism shows that repentance was genuine it a genuine repentance was made and and and it doesn't matter as to what age a person is baptized um um I I think the the person needs to be of the age of accountability and and really there's no certain age uh as long as they know that the Lord is dealing with them and and so uh there there were uh uh two children that that had been baptized or had repented uh and they were at the ages of six and eight and uh they gave their heart to to the Lord that morning at an altar call and so the question was asked brother Branham because now they wanted to be baptized and so the question was asked brother Branham how soon should they be baptized at ages six and eight they just gave their heart to the Lord at the altar that day so they're asking and brother Brandon replied just as soon as you can just as soon as you can repent immediately and be baptized that's in the name of Jesus Christ see he said now uh so it was kind of question answers and he said so that's now that's the question number one and he said I would advise that right and so and if you notice that is actually according to the scripture for Acts 2 and 40 uh uh it says and with many other words did he Peter testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day were there were added unto them about 3 000 Souls now what a service what a baptism service right every one of them 3 000 Souls need to be baptized and uh uh that would have been pretty neat to be there you know uh see everybody lined up and and getting baptized but and so brother Branham said as soon as you believe on the Lord and accept him as your savior go right straight to the water and make your confession and say start right there young or old no matter who it is so then being young doesn't matter see um as uh uh Jesus said here in Mark 10 and 14 suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such of such is the kingdom of God ain't that right so now baptism though isn't just a thing that we do just because we know it is needed to be done I think everything has to be by a revelation I you know uh and and I know uh sometimes us being uh maybe those raised in church and uh you know uh maybe you you've been taught that you need to repent and you've been taught you need to be baptized you need you're taught these things and you should be taught and and maybe then there there could be some type of a pressure uh well you know you need to get to an altar sometime soon you know you need to you know you need to get baptized you need to whatever um and and these things um um but but but we find that it it should only be a thing done if God is revealing it to you I I think because it calls salvation Salvation is a personal thing it's something that is personal between you and the lord it's it's nothing that that we do now we'll preach it you know and and you say man he's you're preaching at me to get baptized or something I just feel pressure no no that could be the devil just trying to stop you uh because if it needs to be preached we're going to preach it if it's if it's something that needs to be there but at the same time I think God needs to deal with the heart do you believe that and and so uh uh baptism should follow when as as when God is dealing with the heart and and uh We've repented and and if you will notice that's what happened after Peter had preached to these people is is the Bible says they were pricked in their heart while he was preaching they were pricked in their heart and then they I asked what they must do to be saved and so I looked up that word pricked it means to pierce through um thoroughly through the heart to pierce thoroughly through the heart that doesn't and and another Webster gives the definition of a nagging a sharp feeling of remorse regret or sorrow so so here Peter is preaching the gospel and while he's preaching the Holy Spirit was moving upon them and it was piercing them them words were piercing them and it wasn't bringing a condemnation but it was bringing a sorrow it was convicting them to where they cried out see they had this feeling of remorse they uh of regret of sorrow and and Peter couldn't have done that on his own but the Holy Ghost was doing that the Holy Ghost was working on both ends it was talking to prayer Peter a man Peter was under that unction of the Holy Ghost and he was given the message and and and the Holy Ghost was working on the people to where they would ask what do we do to be saved what what is this see and so we we find there Paul said in Romans 2 2 that it is the goodness of God everybody say the goodness of God that leadeth thee to repentance it is the goodness of God I got a lot of scriptures um so you don't have to keep up amen but uh it is the goodness of God that leadth to repentance and so an in an individual who had been baptized at the age of 13 now was an adult and and so maybe they'd been raised in church and at 13 years old they had they had been baptized and so as an adult now they're out skin brother Branham a question and says I was baptized at 13 shall I be baptized again now notice what brother Branham would say if you've been a Christian all along then since you was 13 a believer in Christ I would remain like you are I would now he says see if God has blessed you and give you the holy ghost or Holy Spirit since then see see so baptism is only a form to show that again uh uh uh that a genuine repentance was made and it's it's it's it's it's to those that are watching so brother Graham says it's to show the world or those that are watching an audience like today sister Rihanna will be going in the water but it's showing everyone that are there as a witness that a true genuine repentance has been made see and and so um and he said see you're you're proving you are proving before witnesses that you have believed that God is his son and he died and rose again on the third day and you was buried in to him and have risen to walk in newness of life so this is why brother Branham would say if you were baptized as a young age and yet then you you start living like the world and all that then that baptism just wasn't true uh because um uh uh that's what baptism is to do I know baptism today is is just taken so lightly it's just taken for granted it's just something we do let's do it it's a it's a It's Christian Duty it's Christian ritual but but there is a meaning to baptism and and brother Branham even talked about those that would come to the altar you know in Billy Graham uh they would come to repent and and they actually would leave thinking they're repented but they're chewing gum they're they're just talking laughing there was nothing sincere but they would leave uh but they can because they they that was the thing to do you know what I'm saying maybe they come with their buddy or they come because it was Billy Graham or they come because of whatever ever or or they were drugged to the altar well that's why we don't drag people to altars and and all of these things it's it has to be a genuine thing and so brother Bradham said now those same people that watched you when you when you received a baptism is going to meet you at the Judgment see and and so the uh uh so this baptism is not a ritual it is is it's a testimony that that that that a genuine repentance has been made I am now going to serve god with everything I've got and and and you know you're you go down into that water and you're raised as a testimony of newness of life of newness of life and so uh baptism is essential and it is a must everybody say it's a must it's a must and so uh there John 3 3 Jesus said verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again uh uh um of of water everybody say of water and of the Spirit uh I I gave you the wrong uh uh uh chapter my my bad you know and so verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit ain't that right so it's implying two baptisms water and spirit one is a natural baptism water baptism brother Brown said the other is a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost of water and spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God ain't that right and so you it takes all three to come together amen just like you you are a individual but you're made up of three parts right Body Soul and Spirit got to have all three amen that's right and so we believe in being immersed in water brother Brown said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to and to be raised again in newness of life to walk after the Commandments of God and so now brother Brown said he had baptized many children uh the question was asked him well have you baptized children and then re-baptized him later on he says I've done it many times and he says um uh but he said it's not essential that a person to do that and and again if you've been living that Christian life since you was at uh for that person at 13 years old he said now if you want to be baptized and I want you to listen to this he said if you want to be baptized if that's something that's standing in your way if that is something that is nagging you in the back of your mind he says and you feel you should do it then you go do it you understand what I'm saying see you go do it don't let nothing stand in your way you make yourself perfectly clear see get all whatever is there get it all clear if you feel like you need to do it do it just get it all clear right so he says now if you've taken something years ago and you feel like you should go make that right you go make that right no matter what it is you keep everything clear cause you'll come up to that thing notice that you'll come up to that thing and you can't go any further till you get that out of the way so he says you just got to lay aside every weight and the thing that so easily besets you so if there's something that is nagging you uh uh say man you know I I need to be baptized again you know uh uh maybe because of I haven't lived right or you know I've went out in the world and I've done all kinds of uh nonsense and all that and and if that's going to stop you if that's going to hinder you then then it would be best to go ahead and do it and someone said well you don't need to be baptized but if that's something that is bothering you you need to go do it you understand what I'm saying and and so um uh uh then that's what's anything again he uses even stealing if you stole something in that years later it's nagging you and he said you'll never go any further with God until you go get that right see so so there's things and that's even with unconfessed sins that's healing even people can there's a lot of times people can't get healed because there's something in there that's laying in there that they have to go get right right and so uh then then now notice then brother Brandon right after brother Branham says that he says see but you just saying that you were baptized in Christian baptism at the age of 13 and you've lived a Christian Life all the way along or if you've just or if you've backslid a few times he said said and and I want to make a point on on uh you know um uh I want to get into baptism but I also want to make a point right fast about backsliding because this person had been grown up now and and it'd been a few years since they had been baptized see and so no doubt as it is with any Christian Life you're going to make mistakes you're going to make blunders you're you're going to have your ups and downs but they lived a Christian Life all along right so so you know the uh and and so but the individual is wondering well it's been set long and and so do I need to be baptized again and and so the reason that this person was asked uh had asked this question uh and and brother Branham actually if you look it up he actually mentions this scripture that and says you were referring to this scripture and that was in Revelations 2 5 where it says remember therefore from when thou art fallen and repent and do the first works so so they they were thinking well then I need to go back and do the first works again he says do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but notice brother Branham addressed this scripture when answering this person's question and he says now to that scripture that you're referring to that wasn't talking about the individual he said that was to the church see what the church had done they had lost their first love the real cream that they had in the beginning and he said unless you repent and do this first works over start right back get the things see that he's talking to the church instead of an individual so so there's many things that we have to repent over as Believers as Christians we make mistakes many times we don't feel like CR being that that we're Christians many times amen we don't even feel the Lord and we wonder where he's at you understand what I'm saying many times there's there's there could be points that where you just feel like you're even lost you know and yet you you know that you you you you you you you repented uh you uh of your sins back then you you knew that the baptism was gentle uh uh uh genuine you knew that you were filled with the Holy Ghost and yet you're you're in the swamp and and and and and and yes in them time Satan will bring up all your faults and your failures and your your unbeliefs and your this and you're that if if you haven't been there you ain't lived long enough you know what I mean we all have that but that doesn't mean that you got to go back and repent and or or do your work first works over again as he was talking to the church age can you say man sin see Christians as individuals backslide every day you believe that we backslide every day and so brother Brandon even says this here he says you backslide every day there's no way everybody say there's no way there's no way at all for you to keep out of it right now I'll take the prophet's word over anyone else's you backslide every day and there's no way at all for you to keep out of it but you backslide to the people in the church but not before God you backslide on Christ but you don't want God see because when you're uh see when you sin he says because if you when you sin you're gone but you constantly you're constantly falling Paul had to die every day is that right he had to die every day repent every day and just constantly repenting all the time and if Paul had to do that then I'm going to have to do do that as well he says and all of us will have to do that Holy ghost-filled Believers have to do that ain't that right so now brother Branham a few years later from from that statement he shows what backsliding is he said temporarily everybody say temporarily and keep that in mind temporarily minor every one of us backslide many times a day we know that we're all guilty every one of us there's not there's none of us perfected perfected yeah and as long as we're in this body see we are still he says no matter how much people try to tell you well I've got I've been Sanctified I can go kiss that woman and do this and he's he's lying he cannot brother random talked about Holy Ghost people he told all of those people don't rub up you know he said you a man rubbing up against another woman it brings strange feelings that's why we we don't hug hello we don't do them things a holy ghost-filled man still has human elements ain't that right so if he's telling you well I'm Sanctified so I can go kiss that woman he needs that lust devil cast out bro Graham said he's lying see and he cannot he's that's all now he says now see I don't tried to say now brother Brian tell me about his life and it goes for all of it I don't try to say Lord let me see how close I can go it's Lord keep me as far as away as I can get keep me far away as I can get right just stay as far away remember you are still human beings is that right so now if you make a mistake and this little message if you make a mistake or do something wrong you won't do it willfully for you are a Christian and you say man and if you're a born-again Christian said you don't mean to do wrong so this this this person asking do I need to be baptized all over again I was baptized 13. well maybe she was looking at that scripture do the first works over again repent and she was looking at it as well I have made blunders but but she wasn't one that would go out in the world and drinking and out in the bars she wasn't one out there uh uh sleeping with all the men and acting like this and then coming back and getting saved and and giving her heart and said well I was baptized uh uh when I was 13. and so do I need to be baptized again bro Brown said if you've been a Christian all along then you don't need to be if you've gotten a Holy Ghost and and and and and God has approved of Your Action because remember the Holy Ghost is God approving of you right the Holy Ghost see see when you you get you repent you get baptized and God approves of it by giving you the seal a circumcision see so so again back to being mistakes Born Again believers do wrong but they don't mean to do wrong so brother Brown said your intentions and everything is right so here another place said if you do anything wrong it don't condemn you and you go on like that then remember you wasn't saved at the beginning there there there's there's you know preachers that have have committed adultery and slept with women you know and even have a child buyer living like that for 10 years and then want to get back into church and get behind the pulpit you can't do that at least that's my thoughts on it you can't and and and and I I don't think he had the Holy Ghost I don't think them type of people have the Holy Ghost to live out there so long and to do them things amen so so we find that that I you know we're all going to make mistakes but but for me to go to to pick up a uh uh uh go get a bottle of whiskey and and and keeping that in my life I don't think that's the type of mistakes that brother brandeman's talking about so I'm just trying to make that clear to us all that that there there is that that that that yes you you do have to repent but I I believe the Holy Ghost Keeps Us from acting like the world and bringing shame on the name of Jesus Christ in that way so now notice again brother random said see you wasn't saved if if you do anything wrong and it don't condemn you and you go one like that one out remember you wasn't saved at the beginning that's right you wasn't saved and you just had a make-believe you wasn't safe but when you're saved you have a different spirit you're a different nature you're a new creature in Christ and the old things have passed away and they are dead and buried in the sea of forgetfulness you see but you're living here in the world here there's traps set for you everywhere and you're walking with your eyes on Christ and remember that when you make a mistake a real Christian will always come back quickly for reconciliation ain't that right so our our repentance at the beginning is a repentance of a sinner it it's it's repentance of a sinner now uh uh but then you go John 1 and and first John 2 and 1. my little children these things I write unto you that you sin not now who is he talking to first of all he's not talking to Sinners he's talking to believers he said my little children I write unto you right so he says that you sin not and if any if I say if any man sin in other words if any of you my little children sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous now John is talking to people that's received the Holy Ghost and he's telling them now we we we we have a new walk we we have a different nature we're not to sin we're not to willfully go out there and do all that stuff but if you do sin tell that little white lie right getting a spat getting an argument whatever and if you do sin we have an advocate ain't that right so what we find here is Christians sin right it's what the prophet said Christians sin Sinners don't sin why why doesn't Sinners sin he said Christians sin but a sinner cannot sin a sinner doesn't sin because he's a sinner he's just a sinner to begin with that's all here take the back of the book you know we could even use this it's black see well how much of that is black it's all black right so so see there's just no white to it it's black you you say well this much here no it ain't it's it's the whole thing's black it's all black that's the way a sinner is he's just condemned to start with well you say well what about if he commits adultery if he refers to some woman if he gambles if he shoots somebody that's none of our business we got laws down here to take care of that we're not reformers we're preachers of the Gospel so we don't condemn him for what he done we don't condemn him for committing the adultery we don't condemn him because he's a sinner them things are expected of him if he was a Christian he wouldn't do that that's right you see if he's been changed he won't do that but because he's a sinner that's what makes him do that so Christians make temporary minor mistakes every day every day ain't that right but I don't believe that a a real true Holy Ghost filled believer a man is going to act like the world and indulge in the putrid things of the world and be at home with all of that and you say man so we we find again that because baptism uh is something that is a natural act that we do many people baptize get baptized and it does nothing for them simply because either they're pressured into it many get baptized because they've heard it's the right thing to do it so they ought to do it their friends got it and I'm going to do it and other kids other people get baptized without truly being repentant and and these things and and uh um so so there's all kinds but I do want to say this water doesn't save a man water does not save save man sister rayanna coming into the water today that's not going to save her you with me see brother Brown said we're not baptized taking this baptism unto regeneration and the word regeneration is rebirth or restored so now there are people that believe that that when you get baptized you're doing it for regeneration for a rebirth but it doesn't but if if brother Brown said if we are if we baptize unto regeneration then we don't need the blood of Jesus Christ then we'll stick with the water but but that's that it takes the blood of Jesus Christ can you say Amen see so then with the baptism must be based off of our repentance to God that's what it's based off of to show our repentance was genuine it's a outward display that regeneration has taken place and you say amen and we repent why do we repent we repent Believing on the finished work of Jesus Christ he is our substitute he's the one that died for us he is the one that Rose for us he is the one that took our place ain't that right so we repent based upon what he has done not on what we do and and notice what does repentance mean it means to turn from turn from and and repentance is a Godly sorrow everybody say Godly sorrow Godly sorrow there's people that that are sorry because they got caught but then there are people that repent of a Godly Resort a Godly sorrow there's people that repent because they're afraid to go to hell you don't repent because you're afraid to go to hell so second Corinthians 7 and 9 it says now I Rejoice not that you were made sorrow but or sorry but that you sorrow to repentance for you were made sorry after a Godly manner that you might receive damage by us in nothing is that right for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death ain't that right so Godly sorrow cometh by conviction you know there's a difference in conviction and condemnation if God ever convicts you it will not be a a condemnation to you ain't that right amen you know condemnation Works death conviction Works life conviction brings you to repentance condemnation makes you hide things you're doing it out of fear you're doing it out of out of you know uh uh well condemnation and and so Godly sorrow comes by conviction with which works which works repentance and only God can bring conviction now he'll use the preacher to preach something that you need to bring that conviction that I cannot bring that conviction upon you if I ever tried to bring the conviction it actually will work to condemnation and a lot of a lot of preachers have tried to do that especially your legalists that have tried to get the people straightened out and it just brings condemnation but when God deals with the individual it brings conviction ain't that right that's why we need the spirit of God in the churches today so now the sorrow of the world comes by condemnation which works death ain't that right I've thought about this repentance and and you know that that woman that that prostitute that washed Jesus's feet you realize she had nothing to wash his feet with wow you know what she washed his feet with tears of repentance [Music] and brother Branham said that as she with them tears of repentance she's crying out unto him and the tears just dropping washing his feet he said she was washing the reproach from him and bearing his reproach tears of repentance mean a lot that's why brother Brandon was against these dry-eyed confessions can you say Amen tears of repentance and so if if a man is truly repentant in his heart notice what happens God will give him the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't you worry he will he will you say man I don't think you have to beat an altar to get the Holy Ghost I don't think you have to pray and fast and pray and fast and tarry and wait and Terry to get the Holy Ghost amen now brother Brahm says I don't believe that there's any man or woman in any of the groups could ever face Jesus Christ and truly repent of their sins with a truthful surrendered heart saying Lord I truly believe but what God would place on them the baptism of the Holy Ghost right at that time so to to to to to beg God to sink and that was the Pentecostal thought was that you had to get at an altar and you had to stay there and and plead and beg and cry and and all that for you get the Holy Ghost I think a moment a person truly believes and truly repents in their heart God will give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost now you know and that's what the prophet says now I I you know I know there's other times that people get the Holy Ghost in different times so I'm not saying that but I'm I am just telling you God will give it to you God's more than able to it ain't God it's us so according to acts 10 47 a person can receive the Holy Ghost before they are baptized Peter said unto them can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we ain't that right brother Brian said that's the apostolic way God had no set rule when the heart is hungry he will give you what you're hungering for if you want the Holy Ghost it can fall on you right now yeah he says it's the condition of the heart if a man's hungering and his heart is right God will give it to him you don't have to sit there and have a week of Revival you don't even have to go through a prayer line to get it that's right you can get the Holy Ghost right in your pew that's the God we serve because it's the condition of your heart it's it has nothing to do with rituals and forms you understand what I'm saying see we make it all about rituals and form but God doesn't that's right see so the Bible tells us that if you notice Peter stayed with them people until they were baptized in Jesus name he stayed with them they had already received the Holy Ghost they didn't leave them say okay you got the Holy Ghost now let's go see ya he stayed with them until they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost one other place I I ain't got it here but brother Brown said God gives you all the ghost because he knows you'll get baptized he already knows it's in your heart it's it's something there [Music] now did you notice though that anyone in the New Testament that was baptized outside of the Lord Jesus Christ had to be re-baptized in the name of Jesus Christ before they received the Holy Ghost if they had been baptized in titles or in the name of well in in this case it was John they were baptized under repentance under John's baptism and they wanted the Holy Ghost or or they they were talking I I think it was to Paul and he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said well we didn't even know he said well then what was you baptized under well under John well then he began to preach unto them the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and they got baptized and then they got the Holy Ghost now brother Graham said see when they found people that had been immersed some other way besides the name of Jesus Christ they were commanded to be baptized over again in the name of Jesus Christ before they could receive the Holy Ghost see those who were baptized different had to come and be re-baptized to get the Holy Ghost in other words God ain't going to bless a trinity baptism is ain't gonna do it now I want to go more into baptism right fast as into why baptism is important of course bad water baptism is a commemoration of the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ and it it's how a a person becomes identified with the Lord Jesus Christ and and all of us want to be identified and and and most of us I believe here have been identified in this way brother Brown said it is an outward expression that an inward work of Grace has been done ain't that right so now we're not like a Baptist I believe one saved always saved and you can go do anything I had you know as a kid you know we lived among the Cherokees and and and and Cherokees they believed the moment you were born a Cherokee you're Baptist you know and and so a lot of them been been baptized and all that but man they were raunchy Cass well I even went to a church where the preacher smoked I I I I so remember that I I was with some my friends and his family my friend and his family Church going on I mean right in the middle of service everybody just stops stops leaves the leaves the place and it's just me and his family now look at Mike I said what just happened and why aren't we going he said oh they'll all be backs is they're taking a smoke break I'm like you got to be kidding I said is the preacher out there too he said yeah I said okay anyway but that's their ID there is if you get baptized or saved one's always saved you know and they listen to rock and roll because I mean they were some vulgar guys you know and uh uh I've really felt sorry for him but so you you find though that baptism is an expression only to show that an inward work of Grace has been done see so see we we that are watching cannot see what God has done in you not on the inside but see we we find out see when I got baptized you know I was telling the people I'm I'm saved God done something for me well they couldn't look at the heart and see what changed because it was a spiritual thing that changed and so they couldn't go take X-rays but I would got baptized I wanted to let them people know that I've been identified with Jesus Christ his death burial and Resurrection was for me I was buried with I died with him I was buried with him I'm gonna rise with him talk in his life now he's the one smart representing me so it was an outward expression to let them know that God had done something for me so baptism what is baptism it's a burial ground yeah for a believer it's a burial ground because why it's the death Burl of uh death and Barrel of of your old nature the old you has got to die and rot Paul would even say I am crucified with Christ ain't that right you died yeah uh uh no more of the world no more of these things and so you you've repented with that Godly sorrow and remember that that repentance is genuine that won't last just for a week it only lasts for a month you you sold it all out to him ain't that right and the old man is crucified with Christ see you remember Abel in the Old Testament when he died who did he die with he died with his lamb ain't that right and we've got to die with our lamb yeah your lamb died and and you can't remain alive and serve him amen Abel was a type of us that we've got to die with our lamb ain't that right that lamb was his sacrifice to God that lamb was his propitiation and so is our lamb today that's our sacrifice and if he would die with the natural lamb we ought to die with harlam which is the true land we want to have identified with him not with the world you know how people get especially young people get identified with the world as they start going with the trend of the world when Hollywood starts coming out with these skinny jeans boys start taking on the skinny jeans what are they it's an identification when they start having these weird haircuts well everybody else got to go get the weird haircut it's an identification what is it they're of the world it's the spirit of the world they everybody starts painting their hair green blue red could you imagine going to bed with such a thing as that and call that beautiful I think that I think it would stop right there I'd quit saying honey you're beautiful I I mean that's me you look like where's the circus when did we join but but but but see they're doing it because they're identifying with something true everybody getting tattoos today used to when I was a kid it was it was a it was a filthy thing to get tattoos I'm serious it was just scum but everybody's doing it and and it's not just a little thing on the ankle or there is it's everywhere and they call it beautiful but why do they do it to identify well see we want to do something to God to be identified with him and the prophet said what is that baptism I want there should be no shame to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if they can do what they're doing and they say that's natural then it's natural for me as a Believer to do something that I can show that I'm identified with his death burial and Resurrection hate that Ryan so we baptized brother Brown said we go down in the water amen and come back up to witness that we believe in the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ he died I died he was buried I was buried he rose High Rolls Hallelujah and God recognizes them things you realize that it may be just some little simple thing going in the world that God Of Heaven recognizes that that little simple thing will so recognize that before God he'll fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost everything else the world wants to be recognized the president doesn't recognize all the all the the the druggies out here the president all the high UPS doesn't recognize all of these things as an individual but let a Believer amen go down into that water death burial and Resurrection in the name of Jesus Christ and the fairy god of heaven will recognize you as an individual as one of his people identifying with things that are so empty in their soul but God will make sure you're not empty he'll fill you up why you're identifying yourself with him Romans 6 3 Paul says know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death say you you in the likeness of his death that that and he keeps bringing that point out because no one wants to die but see in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that's what happened when you repented with a genuine Godly sorrow you died right there at that altar with your lamb ain't that right see and so he says see uh uh knowing this our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed you realize that once God fills you with the Holy Ghost and again there's that three repent be baptized be filled with Holy Ghost once you are sealed with that you'll never stand before God is a sinner again you'll that's why you cannot go through the tribulation you've already bypassed death ain't that right you went from Death unto life now you can never be condemned before God there it you died with your lamb that lamb is standing as a token for you today you cannot sin you may fall you may make mistakes but there's always an atonement for you that when God looks at you he cannot see you he sees the the lamb your sacrifice he can hear your voice that he doesn't see the sacrament or he doesn't see you he sees his sacrifice ain't that right see so the old man is crucified with him our lamb a man and the bot that the body of sin might be destroyed you see that I got faults it's already destroyed he's already told us you're a human you've got human element amen and that but that there's something that God has done for you that you'll never be a sinner in his sight again I hope that makes sense to you Lord notice the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin coming's free he that's dead is free from sin God have mercy it has shut the accuser's mouth [Music] hmm now if we be dead with Christ Our lamb we believe that we shall also live with him because now now Abel's lamb he died with his lamb but that lamb didn't rise ain't that right it had to be a greater lamb for Abel to rise and that lamb did come amen and brought forth a resurrection and when that lamb rose from the dead all the Old Testament Saints rose with him and even Abel rose with the lamb can you say Amen now if we have been buried with if we died with him we're buried with him then and we sold that we come out of that water that now we're risen with him don't you worry amen you're going to be around have that Resurrection Life in you if you go by the way of a natural grave you will rise again if you don't go by that way there's a resurrection life that's in you that'll change your mortal body I'm so glad for that why because we're not dying with the natural lamb like Abel there's another land ain't that right so see if we Dead with him if we'd be dead with him we believe that we shall also live with him knowing everybody say knowing that Christ being raised from the death dieth no more man knowing that Christ's been raised from the dead doeth no more that's why you can never die can you say man for him that he died he died unto sin once amen but in that he liveth he liveth unto God ain't that right that's why we want to be identified with him we want to be identified with his power we want to be identified with his life you can't be a Christian without him I want to be so identified with him that they can't tell me apart I want to be identified with his blood amen that the sinner has lost his accusations that where the devil can't even accuse me I'm identified with him and if I can be identified in that desk and that burial I'll be identified in him with him in the resurrection and he can no longer die I can no longer die if he comes today he cannot die again there's no need for him to die again oh my well that's the same thing if if he would do that once for all remember that the sacrifice of Christ had perfected them once for all he don't need to come and die again and if you were identified with him in that death burial and Resurrection you can never die again now that's exciting don't let the devil condemn you don't listen to them lies again that's what it means to have the Holy Ghost ain't that right likewise wrecking yourself also dead to be dead undeed indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin ever I say let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof so brother Brown said be buried in water to rise to newness of life newness of life so that that that simple Act of being baptized has a lot of meaning to God and to us now buried this why we don't sprinkle a little water on a person because it's a barrel you you you you you're gonna you're gonna take a dead person sprinkle dirt say okay he's died so let's get a little dirt [Music] it's done no you bury him now people that don't understand that there's a lot of denominations that just sprinkle I don't know why but they just I want to be buried give me some deep water I want every part of me I want to be buried I don't want a fingernail showing I want I want to be buried ain't that right amen see our lord Jesus was completely sealed away buried and baptism means submersion uh immersion emergence to dip to plunge to drench is used by the Greeks to signify the dying of a garment uh or or the drawing of Water by dipping a vessel into another see so we are baptized again and I'm I'm not going to take much longer but we are baptized for the remission of our sins and that word remit is to forgive or to take away and and so uh uh John 20 and 23 whosoever sends you remit he's talking to the church they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained and actually this is the part of the greater that Jesus said that we would do and that's imparting eternal life to others and brother Brown says now here's where the Catholic church and many of the others made their big mistake they go out and say I forgive your sins but that's not what Jesus was talking about how did they get sins forgiven in the Bible how did they do it Peter answered their question on the day of Pentecost they said what can we do to be saved how can we get this that you all got he laid down the prescription and told them what to do repent every one of you towards God be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for what the remission of sins there's the Greater Works can you say man and only the word can forgive sins and this is what we are bringing to you is the word formula ain't that right on how to have your sins repented now you say well I I I have repented and yet yet to be re refused to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then your sins haven't been remitted yet hello now again we don't baptize for regeneration as some other churches a man or yeah some denominations or whatever do Hebrews 9 22 without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sins there's no remission ain't that right so baptism will not work unless you have thoroughly repented of your sins repent be baptized for the remission of sins and sins will never be remitted through titles can you say Amen remember the formula be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's right you love him amen he said if you want to be saved repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins that's how they're remitted amen so why do we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ I'm going to go through this quickly I'll cut some of it off because I got a lot going to go first of all that's how Jesus taught us to baptize if you go back Matthew 28 19. Jesus said go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them everybody say baptizing them in the name of father son and the Holy Ghost now I'll say that right the father the son the Holy Ghost right that note is baptizing them in the name so he didn't say baptize them in names plural baptize them in the name singular ain't that right so never has the word names being in the Bible when it comes to reference to God it's always been name singular as when it comes to God name can you say man man is the one that makes the word names plural as though it's plural ain't that right because they believe there are three Gods Mark 12 32 tells us there is one God and there is none other but he Ephesians 4 6 tells us that there is one God and Father of all First Timothy 2 and 5 tells us there is one God and one mediator between God and the man and men and that's the man Jesus Christ right James 2 18 thou believes that there is one God thou do as well the Devils also believe what do they believe in that there's one God and they tremble ain't that right so it's one God with one name now you might ask say well what about all these Redemptive the seven Redemptive names and all these other names of of Jehovah and all that they are titles everybody say they are titles to depict as to what he is ain't that right but every title that God uses to depict uh his character are under the umbrella of one name ain't that right if you need a Jehovah if you needed a provider it was Jehovah Jireh if you needed peace it was God Shalom Jehovah shalom right uh uh yeah if you need to rock what is a Jehovah disc knew yeah that was Jehovah something anyways seven Redemptive names but when it comes to Jesus Christ if you need a provider it's under the name of Jesus Christ if you need a a a a a a a a uh a piece it's under the name of Jesus Christ if you need a banner it's under the name of Jesus Christ ain't that right see they all come under that one name so it's in CR it's crucial to find out what name singular that he is speaking of now Luke 1 33 because it says the name Father Son and Holy Ghost the whole Thou shalt conceive in thy womb now it's the angel speaking to to Mary behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a ghost bring forth a father bring forth a son right and thou shalt call his name what Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of Mary no the son of Joseph he shall be called the son of the highest ain't that right so the highest uh uh the Father the god uh is his is the father amen so the name of the son is what Jesus that's right so so now what did the son tell us in John 5 43 I am come in my father's name ain't that right this is the son himself saying I am come in my father's name and you receive him not so the name of the father is Jesus ain't that right and who is the father Luke 1 32 and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of these shall be called The Son of God ain't that right Matthew 1 20 but while he thought on these things speaking of Joseph behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost is the father ain't that right and his name is Jesus Christ that's what the Bible tells us and you say Amen acts 4 10 if the musicians will come acts 4 10 it says be Noah be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was said at not of you Builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is no other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved Colossians 3 17 and whatsoever you do in word or D do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him oh we could go on about the importance of a name and what that name represents and you know names represent characteristics it represents the nature of an individual the history and even God considers names to be important and and he promised that he would bless those that thought upon his name that gave reverence to his name there's blessings to that name Hallelujah I love the Lord do you love him can we just sing that song his name is wonderful I don't know let's just uh it's an older song try if maybe his name is wonderful his name is wonderful his name is wonderful cheap
