[14:51] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[14:57] hand. And I
[15:00] know it's going to
[15:04] rain. In a time when it was dry, not a
[15:09] cloud up in the sky, the children of
[15:13] Israel began to reason
[15:16] why. Oh, they went to God's man cuz they
[15:22] didn't understand. He said, "Go look.
[15:26] It's written in the
[15:29] sky." Oh yes. Now I see a cloud like a
[15:34] man's
[15:36] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[15:42] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[15:49] hand. And I
[15:51] know it's going to
[15:55] rain. Now they opened up the door a
[15:59] seventh time. And they looked once more.
[16:02] A tiny cloud was rising from the
[16:07] sea. They began to
[16:10] understand. The time for rain was at
[16:14] hand. Just like God said it would
[16:19] be. Oh yes. I see a cloud like a man's
[16:25] hand.
[16:27] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's hand. Oh,
[16:34] I see a cloud like a man's
[16:38] hand. And I
[16:41] know it's going to
[16:44] rain. So today we have no fear for a
[16:49] cloud did appear. The prophets bring my
[16:53] bride. Go through that
[16:56] door. Oh, have faith and just believe. A
[17:01] new spirit you'll
[17:03] receive. The rain is just about to
[17:08] pour. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[17:14] hand. Yes, I see a cloud like a man's
[17:20] hand.
[17:22] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's hand, and
[17:27] I
[17:29] know it's going to
[17:32] rain. Now the bride is looking above for
[17:37] the chariot rain of love to fill their
[17:40] hearts with peace they have never known.
[17:45] And soon his bride shall be. God's
[17:48] unfolded mystery. The promised word has
[17:53] already been
[17:55] sold. Oh yes, I see a cloud like a man's
[18:02] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[18:07] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[18:12] hand.
[18:14] And I
[18:15] know it's going to rain. I like this
[18:19] verse. So today we have no fear for a
[18:23] cloud did appear. The prophet scream,
[18:27] "My bride, just go through that door."
[18:31] Oh, have faith and just believe. A new
[18:35] spirit you'll receive. The rain is just
[18:40] about to pour.
[18:43] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[18:48] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[18:53] hand. Yes, I see a cloud like a man's
[18:59] hand. And I
[19:02] know it's going to rain as they come for
[19:05] the offering. Oh, I see a cloud like a
[19:10] man's hand.
[19:12] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[19:17] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[19:22] hand. And I
[19:25] know it's going to
[19:30] rain. Amen. Brother

[23:46] [Music]
[23:49] Amen. Amen. So good to be in church
[23:52] again this morning. I was thinking just
[23:55] a little while I come down coming down
[23:56] the road, you know that the bride was
[23:59] chosen. This church was chosen before
[24:00] the foundation of the world. And I
[24:02] thought to myself, what did I do? What
[24:04] did we do? What did we do? It was chosen
[24:08] millions of years ago, perhaps. What did
[24:10] we do to be one of those that was
[24:12] chosen? What What could we have
[24:15] done? Just think about that. We're
[24:18] thankful. And to send us a prophet and
[24:20] let us have a representation to hear and
[24:22] understand what's happened this
[24:25] generation. Oh God, how thankful. Lord,
[24:28] we come before you this morning with
[24:30] such exceeding thanksgiving in our
[24:31] heart. Lord, where we would have been,
[24:34] could have been had we not been under
[24:36] the umbrella of this wonderful end time
[24:39] message. We're so thankful, Lord, to to
[24:41] know what you've done in this day, to
[24:43] have an understanding, as the prophet
[24:44] said in future home, a clear
[24:46] understanding. We're thankful, Lord, for
[24:48] that new birth that you given, that
[24:50] token, Lord, the not only just the
[24:52] baptism, but the life of Christ, the
[24:54] token life that's been given in this
[24:55] day. And Lord, you came down not only
[24:58] just only in your spirit, but the person
[25:00] of Christ, the full word, Christ
[25:02] himself. Oh God, how thankful. Just so
[25:05] many things we could say. I pray God now
[25:07] as you would anoint brother Andrew to
[25:09] speak. Give him the words to speak.
[25:11] Lord, let it be spiritual food in due
[25:12] season, everpresent water from the rock.
[25:14] We pray for those Lord who are traveling
[25:17] back from Ohio, different ones. Each one
[25:19] keep them safe on the highways, Lord.
[25:21] And we just be careful to praise you.
[25:23] Bless all that's done and said this
[25:25] morning. May our lives be drawn closer.
[25:27] Lord, may our focus be on the word. As
[25:29] we see, as the prophet of God said, the
[25:31] major sin of the day is worldlyism.
[25:33] Lord, we don't want anything to do with
[25:35] that lays in life. But as the Jewish
[25:38] people are always separated, Lord, we
[25:40] want to be a separated people, Lord,
[25:42] unto you. Oh God, help us to be that. We
[25:45] love you. Thank you for our gathering
[25:46] this morning. We just pray that you'll
[25:49] meet with us when the word is brought
[25:50] forth. Lord, may it be uh come in power
[25:52] and demonstration of the Holy Ghost. We
[25:54] love you so much. We thank you again in
[25:57] Jesus' name. Amen.

[35:19] F. There are some things C almost go up
[35:24] the key.
[35:26] There are some
[35:30] things I may not
[35:34] know. There are some
[35:38] places that I don't
[35:43] go. But this one
[35:48] thing, I truly do
[35:52] know. My God is real. For I can feel him

[43:52] Lord. We're so glad. Amen. to serve a
[43:56] God that is tremendous,
[43:59] victorious. Amen. I was listening to
[44:02] brother Brandham
[44:04] um well early this morning and he was
[44:08] talking about how that the difference
[44:10] between Satan knowing the word and Jesus
[44:13] knowing the word. And he said Satan knew
[44:16] it by knowledge. He said, "But Jesus
[44:19] knew it by experience." He said, "That's
[44:22] the way Jesus knew the word." And I'm
[44:24] thinking, "Oh, that's so true. That's
[44:25] the way we know our God. We don't know
[44:28] God by knowledge. We know him by
[44:29] experience.
[44:31] And I'm so glad for that. And we love
[44:34] the Lord. And you can be seated for just
[44:36] a moment. Amen. We're just glad to have
[44:39] everyone in the house of the Lord and uh
[44:42] to serve the Lord. And it's a beautiful
[44:45] day today. So, we thank the Lord for
[44:47] that. And um um good to have brother
[44:51] Andrew and sister Mariah with us. Amen.
[44:53] and little Malachi. Praise the Lord. And
[44:57] u um we want to just uh keep brother
[45:00] Andrew in prayer. He's not feeling good.
[45:03] Have an ear ache. Uh pretty pretty bad
[45:07] ear infection, but uh we just believe
[45:10] the Lord will help him and uh deliver
[45:13] what's on his heart. Amen. And
[45:16] um um I wanted just to say we want to
[45:20] congratulate brother Mark. Uh he has
[45:23] retired. Amen. Last Wednesday. Amen. And
[45:28] u uh entered into retirement. uh 35
[45:33] years was it 35 years of uh service to

[45:43] big time uh change in his life and and
[45:48] we just pray that the Lord will just
[45:50] really bless him and and uh uh we really
[45:54] appreciate brother Mark and love him
[45:57] dearly and he has been a real blessing
[46:00] to us um throughout the years and uh
[46:05] just a real humble heart and uh I I just
[46:09] really appreciate brother Mark and so
[46:11] congratulations
[46:13] uh to him and and also want to say uh
[46:16] thank you to brother Terry for mowing
[46:19] yesterday at the field and uh getting
[46:22] ready for us to put up that tent today
[46:25] and uh that really means a lot to us and
[46:29] Um, brother Terry drove all the way. Now
[46:32] he lives, uh, he lives a good hour and
[46:35] 20 minutes, 15 minutes, something like
[46:38] that. And so, um, uh, they drive every
[46:42] Wednesday to church and Sunday to church
[46:45] and then driving yesterday to help us
[46:48] out there. And Mo, we just really
[46:51] appreciate that very much. And um uh but
[46:56] uh just always good to to to I'm glad to
[46:59] be around the body of Christ, to belong
[47:01] to the body of Christ. Amen. And um uh
[47:05] it's good to have uh uh brother Jerry
[47:08] and Sister Tony back with us. God bless
[47:11] you all. And uh just uh everyone that
[47:15] have uh been sick and we've been missing
[47:18] and uh just good to have uh each and
[47:21] everyone this morning. looking forward
[47:23] to a wonderful time in the Lord is
[47:26] around the word of God and uh we know
[47:29] that um the word of God is the most
[47:32] important thing and um it's not just
[47:36] hearing the word but it's getting our
[47:39] hearts to where God just helps us to
[47:42] believe the word to believe the word and
[47:45] then act upon that word and uh you know
[47:48] brother Brandham talking he said it's
[47:50] Satan's job is to get us to doubt our
[47:53] weapon. And our our weapon is the word
[47:56] of God. Ain't that right? And we do not
[47:59] have a leg to stand on if we if we doubt
[48:01] the word. If and and you say, "Well, I
[48:04] believe that word, but what about
[48:05] believing that word for us? For for you
[48:08] personally, for me personally, I think
[48:10] that's where the struggle is is when we
[48:13] see all of our ups and downs, our
[48:15] failures, our things that maybe we want
[48:18] to be, but yet we're not there. and it
[48:21] just the struggles and things. And then
[48:23] we hear the promises of God about being
[48:26] the bride and speaking the word and
[48:28] being invincible and and invincible army
[48:31] and all of these things. It's hard to
[48:33] put ourselves in that. Amen. To say,
[48:36] "Well, that's me." Amen. But you got to
[48:39] look past your struggles. You got to
[48:40] look past your incapabilities. You got
[48:44] to look past your weaknesses. And you
[48:46] just look past yourself cuz brother
[48:49] Brandham said you're your biggest enemy.
[48:51] We all are our biggest enemy. Ain't that
[48:54] right? And we fight every day. But if we
[48:57] can take a hold of that word and apply
[48:59] it to our lives, say that is me
[49:01] regardless, that's me. And start
[49:03] confessing that word. Amen. That's
[49:06] that's your weapon. Ain't that right?
[49:08] Amen. And so, uh, Brother Andrew is
[49:11] going to minister the word of God to us.
[49:14] But don't just receive it as in general.
[49:16] Oh yes, I believe that. But take it for
[49:18] yourself and say, "Now that's for me.
[49:21] I'm going to take that for me. I'm going
[49:24] to use that and I'm going to whip the
[49:26] devil in my life and I'm going to get
[49:28] stronger by the word of God." Can you
[49:31] say amen? And it's not just just mind
[49:34] trying to believe it, but may God give
[49:36] us the revelation to see ourselves in
[49:39] that word. Can you say amen? So let's
[49:42] just stand to our feet as we invite
[49:45] brother Andrew to come and we want him
[49:47] just to take his time deliver his heart
[49:49] to us and we just say oh God speak to us
[49:53] today uncover it so we can see for
[49:57] ourselves what uh is being ministered
[50:00] and the true value of the word of God
[50:03] for today. Amen. What
[50:07] song? Yeah, that was a good one.
[50:12] Let's sing it now. How great are you,
[50:14] Lord? Oh, how great are you,
[50:21] Lord. How great is your
[50:26] [Music]
[50:27] mercy. How great are the things that you
[50:32] have done for me.
[50:35] [Music]

[50:42] Lord? Your loving
[50:47] kindness is stealing my heart as I sing.
[50:52] How great are you,
[50:56] Lord? How great are you,
[51:01] Lord? How great is your mercy, isn't it
[51:06] great to
[51:08] us. Great are the things that you have
[51:12] done for
[51:16] me. How great are you,
[51:19] [Laughter]
[51:21] Lord? How great is loving
[51:27] kindness is filling my heart as I sing.
[51:32] How great are you,
[51:35] Lord? How great is your
[51:39] love? It reaches to the
[51:45] heavens. How great is the
[51:48] heart that sought and rescued me.
[51:55] How great are you
[51:58] [Music]
[51:59] Lord? Your loving
[52:05] kindness. Oh, is feeling my heart as I
[52:09] sing. How great are you, Lord? Can we
[52:12] lift our hands and sing How Great are
[52:16] you,
[52:17] Lord? Glory, glory to God.
[52:22] How great is your
[52:24] mercy? How great
[52:27] is your
[52:31] [Music]
[52:33] mercy? How
[52:35] great. Oh
[52:39] yes
[52:43] kindness is filling my heart as I sing.
[52:48] How great are you,
[52:50] Lord? Amen. How many can testify this
[52:53] morning? Amen. That he's a great God.
[52:56] Amen. There's no God like our God. Amen.
[52:59] The world has they've made many gods.
[53:02] Amen. But they're all idols this
[53:03] morning. They're dead. Amen. Myths and
[53:06] imaginations, but we stand here today
[53:08] serving the one true living God. And
[53:10] Amen. What a what an honor it is to know
[53:12] him. And Amen. I never can I never can
[53:15] think about knowing him without thinking
[53:17] of Abraham when he met Melzdc there that
[53:19] day. And the Bible said that Abraham
[53:21] blessed Melzdc. But I love it because
[53:24] the Bible said Melzdc blessed him back.
[53:26] Amen. So it wasn't just that Abraham
[53:29] knew who God was, but God knew who
[53:31] Abraham was. Amen. What an honor it is
[53:34] to know our God knows our name this
[53:36] morning. And Amen. Maybe we just bow our
[53:38] hearts for a word of prayer this
[53:39] morning. How many have a special need
[53:41] upon your heart? something you would and
[53:43] desire from the Lord this morning. Amen.
[53:46] I know he's able to move this morning on
[53:48] the needs. Heavenly Father, Lord, as
[53:50] we've gathered here on this beautiful
[53:51] Sunday morning, this resurrection Sunday
[53:54] that you've given us, Father, Lord, to
[53:56] the world, it's just another day in the
[53:58] week. It's another Lord day to go about
[54:01] activities and do the things of the
[54:03] world, Lord. Father, as we were just
[54:05] driving to church this morning and Lord,
[54:08] just watching the people, Lord, as they
[54:10] were just going about as if there was
[54:12] nothing spiritual about this day, Lord,
[54:14] it just shows us the condition that the
[54:16] world we live in is in, Father. But
[54:19] Lord, we're so thankful for your word
[54:21] where you said we are in the world, but
[54:22] we're not of the world. Lord, we're so
[54:25] thankful that in this Leoysian age, this
[54:27] Leotian lukewarmness has gripped the
[54:29] hearts of humanity. But Lord, we thank
[54:32] you this morning that there is a fire
[54:34] burning in our hearts to serve you,
[54:36] Lord. A desire to live for you and to
[54:39] love you and your people, Lord, and to
[54:41] honor your word, to recognize what
[54:43] you've done in this age we're living in,
[54:45] oh God, this morning. We're so grateful,
[54:48] Lord. Truly, Father, we say how great is
[54:50] our God this morning. Lord, as we gather
[54:53] here around the carcass of your word, we
[54:55] know that we're the carcasses there. The
[54:56] eagles will be gathered together. And
[54:59] Lord, whenever eagles get together,
[55:01] there's always needs. But Lord, we're so
[55:04] thankful this morning to know you're
[55:05] still Jehovah Gyra. So Lord, come among
[55:08] us this morning in the power of your
[55:10] word. Lord, may sicknesses be healed. Oh
[55:12] God. May, Lord, believers that are
[55:14] battling things in their hearts and
[55:16] lives. May the word bring deliverance
[55:17] this morning. Father, I pray the
[55:20] anointing of the word would just break
[55:21] the yoke of the enemy here today.
[55:24] Father, if there be anyone here today
[55:25] that don't know you in the power of your
[55:27] resurrection, I pray, oh God, this would
[55:29] be the morning that they would meet you,
[55:31] Lord, in the power and the authority of
[55:34] your resurrection, that they would
[55:35] accept their salvation, oh God. Lord, if
[55:37] there be one here that's empty and don't
[55:39] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[55:41] fire. Pray, oh God, this morning, you
[55:43] would open the windows of heaven as it
[55:45] were on the day of Pentecost. And may
[55:47] you fill every vessel here, Lord.
[55:49] Father, forgive us of our failures.
[55:51] Forgive us of our shortcomings, Lord.
[55:53] Father, we don't just want to gather
[55:54] here and fulfill a religious duty today,
[55:57] oh God, but Lord, we want to be
[55:59] transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[56:01] Now, Father, we commit this meeting and
[56:03] this day into thy faithful hands. In the
[56:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray
[56:08] and all the believers says, "Amen and
[56:11] amen." God richly bless you today. Amen.
[56:14] It is a real honor to be with you. Amen.
[56:16] The musicians can be dismissed. It's a,
[56:18] as we said, it's a real honor to be here
[56:20] today and to be back with brother Shawn
[56:22] and the church here and Amen. this
[56:24] beautiful day the Lord's gi us. Amen. To
[56:26] Amen. put up that tin and Amen. I was
[56:28] thinking this morning, hard to believe
[56:30] this think this will be the fifth year.
[56:32] Amen. But to see the power of God moving
[56:34] in the vision of the Lord and Amen to
[56:36] see it to see it succeeding and the
[56:38] blessings of God upon it. We we're sure
[56:40] honored to see what the Lord is doing
[56:42] and Amen. Sure. Good to good to be here.
[56:44] And I heard brother uh seeing brother
[56:46] Shamai and sister Bethany pulling out
[56:48] there and I thought in my heart there's
[56:49] Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac. Amen. We we
[56:53] sure glad to see you all and that
[56:55] beautiful little baby boy the Lord's
[56:56] giving you. Amen. Amen. What a miracle
[56:59] stands here today. Amen. We say God
[57:01] bless you all and sure good to see you.
[57:03] And if you have your Bibles this
[57:04] morning, we want to go to the book of 1
[57:06] Timothy the 3 chapter. Amen. We want to
[57:09] go to 1 Timothy 3 and then we're going
[57:11] to go to Daniel chapter 11. Amen. I
[57:14] heard brother brother Seawn mention in
[57:16] brother Mark's retirement and amen I was
[57:18] out in Oklahoma a few years ago right
[57:20] after brother Merl uh retired and he had
[57:23] a t-shirt on said under new management
[57:25] had all of his grandkids there. So amen
[57:28] I guess retirement you change management
[57:30] to the grandkids right. Amen. God bless
[57:32] you brother Mark. Congratulations on
[57:34] that. And amen. Just a just a joy in our
[57:36] heart today to be in the house of God.
[57:38] And Amen. The book of 1 Timothy chapter
[57:41] 3 and verse number 15. Paul here writing
[57:45] to Timothy he says but if I tar long
[57:49] that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
[57:51] to behave thyself in the house of God.
[57:55] Now, I love here because he don't just
[57:57] stop there and leave it at the building,
[57:59] but he moves from the from the structure
[58:02] and he says from the house of God, which
[58:04] is the church of the living God, which
[58:07] is the pillar and ground of the truth.
[58:11] Amen. So this morning, the two befores
[58:13] are not the pillars of truth. The carpet
[58:16] is not the ground of truth. So Paul is
[58:18] moving the church from the structure
[58:20] into the body. Now watch in verse 16.
[58:23] and without controversy. Great is the
[58:25] mystery of godliness. For God was
[58:28] manifested in the flesh. I could say it
[58:31] like this. God was manifested in the
[58:33] church. God was manifested in the flesh.
[58:36] He was justified in the spirit, seen of
[58:39] angels, preached unto the Gentiles,
[58:41] believed on in the world, and received
[58:44] up into glory. Now, in the book of
[58:47] Daniel, the 11th chapter, Daniel chapter
[58:50] 11, and man, I love the words Paul uses
[58:52] there, that God was manifested in the
[58:55] flesh. Of course, we know the world
[58:57] always failed to see the manifestation
[58:59] of God. But here in Daniel 11 and verse
[59:02] 32, a very, very familiar scripture. We
[59:06] can all read it by heart. The Bible
[59:08] says, "And such as do
[59:10] wickedly against the covenant shall he
[59:13] corrupt by
[59:14] flatteries, but the people." Somebody
[59:16] say, "The people." But the people, or
[59:19] could I say, "But the church." But the
[59:22] people that do know their God shall be
[59:25] weak and barely making it and barely
[59:27] holding on. No. My Bible says, "The
[59:30] people that know their God shall be
[59:32] strong and do exploits." So there is a
[59:36] strength in the church to do great
[59:38] exploits of faith. Amen. We ask the Lord
[59:40] this morning to add the blessing to the
[59:42] reading of his word. As you can have
[59:43] your seats here today, if I would if I
[59:45] would take a title this morning, I want
[59:47] to talk to you on this. The certainty of
[59:50] the church of the living God. The
[59:52] certainty of the church of the living
[59:54] God. I recently spoke a thought on the
[59:56] thought of on the unlimited powerful
[59:58] church of the living God. And I just
[1:00:00] began a little bit of study. You
[1:00:02] ministers know how that goes when you
[1:00:03] start looking at something and something
[1:00:05] else opens up. And I just began studying
[1:00:07] a little bit on the fault there of the
[1:00:09] church of the living God. Of course,
[1:00:11] brother Brandham preaches two very
[1:00:13] powerful sermons concerning this
[1:00:15] subject. 1951, he'll call it the church
[1:00:17] of the living God. Then in 1960, he
[1:00:20] calls it five definite
[1:00:22] identifications of the true church of
[1:00:24] the living God. Now, at the message of
[1:00:26] the hour, if you ever get time and want
[1:00:28] to look at that term, Amen. The church
[1:00:30] of the living God. There's about 420
[1:00:33] different times or quotes, amen, that
[1:00:35] brother Brandham actually mentions,
[1:00:37] amen, the church of the living God. 1960
[1:00:40] when he preaches that five definite
[1:00:41] identification, he said, now the word
[1:00:44] church on each one of these subjects
[1:00:45] that I've chosen tonight, he said to try
[1:00:48] to speak to you on one of it is what is
[1:00:50] the church? Who set it up? What is its
[1:00:52] message? How do we become a member of
[1:00:54] it? And can we get to heaven without
[1:00:57] being a member of it? Now, amen. If you
[1:00:59] listen to that tape, you realize that
[1:01:01] every one of those questions deserves an
[1:01:03] entire service. Amen. In itself. But
[1:01:05] here, he's just breaking it down very
[1:01:07] quickly, showing us what is the church,
[1:01:09] who set it up, what is its message? How
[1:01:12] do we become a member of it? And can we
[1:01:14] get to heaven without being a member of
[1:01:16] it? He said, now each one of those texts
[1:01:18] could last for hours. See, amen. Combing
[1:01:21] back and forth. He said, "But I wish
[1:01:23] just to hit, amen, a few fundamental
[1:01:25] points to show, amen, what the real
[1:01:28] church is." So out of these questions,
[1:01:30] he's going to identify, amen, what the
[1:01:33] real church is. He said, "And now I want
[1:01:36] you to have your Bibles." Now, I know
[1:01:38] that may just be a passing quote to
[1:01:40] some, but to me, it is very powerful
[1:01:43] that the prophet is getting ready to
[1:01:45] identify, amen, what the church of the
[1:01:47] living God is. And he's not going to do
[1:01:49] it from a commentary or not going to do
[1:01:51] it from some system of denominational
[1:01:53] handbook. Amen. But rather he's going to
[1:01:56] take the Bible and he's going to
[1:01:58] scripturally identify, amen, who and
[1:02:01] what the real church is. Now he'll go to
[1:02:03] Revelation 12 and verse one. And the
[1:02:06] Bible said, "And there appeared a great
[1:02:08] wonder in heaven. And there was a woman,
[1:02:10] amen, that was clothed with a sun, and
[1:02:12] the moon was under her feet, and upon
[1:02:15] her head was a crown of 12 stars."
[1:02:17] Brother Bram picks that up in the mark
[1:02:19] of the beast. He said, "Now what does a
[1:02:21] woman represent?" He said, "The church,
[1:02:24] this is the bride here." Amen. This is
[1:02:27] the church, the real church again in the
[1:02:29] seal of God. The real church of the
[1:02:31] living God. Now, watch this. Will be
[1:02:34] condemned by Catholic and Protestant.
[1:02:36] Amen. Because they will unite together.
[1:02:39] Amen. They're already together as one.
[1:02:41] Amen. As mother and daughter. Amen. Now
[1:02:44] I want you to catch something that the
[1:02:46] real church of the living God. Amen. Is
[1:02:48] neither Catholic and neither is it
[1:02:51] Protestant. Amen. Because the Catholic
[1:02:53] has come from Rome. Amen. Protestant
[1:02:56] have become her daughters. Amen. But
[1:02:58] there will be a real church that will be
[1:03:00] called out. Amen. Of the middle of such
[1:03:03] religious confusion. He said see if our
[1:03:05] hearts condemn us then we want complete
[1:03:07] deliverance. Right? Amen. We don't want
[1:03:10] to be a halfway church. He said, "We
[1:03:13] want to be a real church." Amen. Or no
[1:03:16] church at all. Amen. We want to be real
[1:03:18] Christians or no Christians at all.
[1:03:20] Amen. I'll say this, and no offense,
[1:03:22] Amen. But they're not real Christians.
[1:03:24] Amen. Amen. They're they're mimics of
[1:03:27] Christianity, Amen. But God who is rich
[1:03:29] in mercy has allowed a prophet, amen, to
[1:03:32] come into this generation to take the
[1:03:34] word of God, amen, and to scripturally
[1:03:37] identify, amen, who the church is, what
[1:03:40] the church is, and what the message is
[1:03:43] that it believes. And he said it like
[1:03:44] this. He said, "There's only one true
[1:03:47] living church." How many agree? Amen.
[1:03:50] There's only one true, amen, living
[1:03:52] church. He goes to David and said David
[1:03:54] was in the worst of his time when he was
[1:03:57] a fugitive, but he had already been
[1:03:59] anointed. Amen. He knowed what he was to
[1:04:01] be. Amen. He was to be king. God said
[1:04:04] so. Yet he was hated and he was standing
[1:04:07] in between two great deep fires. Amen.
[1:04:10] Here was the Philistines on one side.
[1:04:13] Amen. Here was the Here was Saul on the
[1:04:15] other side. Amen. And he was a man
[1:04:17] without a nation. How many knows a
[1:04:20] prophet can see things? Amen. that a
[1:04:22] commentator can't pick up. Amen. He can
[1:04:24] see things that a theologian will never
[1:04:26] see. And here he sees a type of the
[1:04:29] church. Amen. In David's situation, he
[1:04:32] said, "And just as the church stands
[1:04:34] today." Amen. The true church of the
[1:04:37] living God. Amen. Without a denomination
[1:04:40] or anything else. Amen. She stands
[1:04:43] alone, but yet she's had the anointing
[1:04:46] poured on her. Amen. She knows what she
[1:04:49] is. Amen. Just as David stood, amen,
[1:04:53] between Philistines and Saul, amen,
[1:04:56] there's a real church that is standing
[1:04:58] on the face of the earth. And she's
[1:05:00] standing between the Catholicism spirit
[1:05:02] and the Protestant spirit. Amen. None of
[1:05:05] them is backing her up. Amen. But that's
[1:05:07] okay. The anointing has already been
[1:05:10] poured upon her. And I want to tell you
[1:05:12] this morning, folks, Amen. There might
[1:05:14] not be an organization behind us. There
[1:05:17] might not be a denomination supporting
[1:05:19] us. Amen. But what do we need a
[1:05:21] denomination for when we got the
[1:05:23] anointing? Amen. That destroys the yoke
[1:05:26] of the enemy. Listen, this bride is not
[1:05:29] backed up by man. Amen. She is anointed
[1:05:31] by God. And that's the reason Satan
[1:05:34] hates. Amen. The true church of the
[1:05:37] living God. He said that all that live
[1:05:40] godly in Christ Jesus will suffer
[1:05:42] persecution. He said the devil has
[1:05:45] always been after the church of the
[1:05:48] living God. Amen. You realize that the
[1:05:51] devil has always been after the church
[1:05:54] of the living God. Is that right? It's
[1:05:56] always had a black name. Amen. Jesus was
[1:05:59] born in this world with a black name.
[1:06:02] Amen. As an illegitimate child. Did you
[1:06:04] know that he was supposed to be born a
[1:06:06] child out of holy wedlock? Amen. Jesus
[1:06:09] had that hanging on him. Now watch
[1:06:12] something, folks. He had that reputation
[1:06:14] hanging on him. But in his heart, he
[1:06:17] knew he was the son of the living God.
[1:06:20] Amen. Can I show you something? Amen.
[1:06:23] Greater is your revelation, Amen. than
[1:06:25] your reputation. Amen. Your reputation
[1:06:28] don't really define you. Amen. But
[1:06:30] what's in your heart, Amen, defines you.
[1:06:33] Listen. And what they thought about him
[1:06:35] did not define who he was. But the
[1:06:38] revelation that was in his heart that he
[1:06:40] was the son of God. He had come into the
[1:06:42] world to manifest God. Amen. That was
[1:06:45] the identifying revelation. Listen, I'll
[1:06:47] say that about you. Amen. We got a bad
[1:06:50] reputation among the world. Amen. We're
[1:06:52] considered a bunch of rebels and a bunch
[1:06:54] of headless people that don't have no
[1:06:56] denomination we answer to. Oh, but if
[1:06:59] they only knew, Amen. that our
[1:07:01] reputation don't deter us. Amen. Our
[1:07:04] reputation don't discourage us. Because
[1:07:06] in the heart of every member of the
[1:07:09] church of the living God, Amen. lays the
[1:07:11] revelation that if God be for me, then
[1:07:14] who can be against me? Hey, if the devil
[1:07:16] is one one side and 10,000 on the other,
[1:07:19] it'll not come nigh thee because there
[1:07:22] is a revelation in my soul. Listen, we
[1:07:25] know who we are. Hey, that's why he said
[1:07:28] you know where you stand tonight and
[1:07:30] there's only one more person knows it
[1:07:32] and that's God. Amen. He knows where you
[1:07:34] stand. So if your heart is right with
[1:07:36] God, then really live for him and be
[1:07:39] true to him. Amen. Love him so much that
[1:07:42] everything else becomes secondarily. And
[1:07:45] then you'll love the Lord with all your
[1:07:47] heart,
[1:07:48] with all your strength, with all your
[1:07:51] soul, with all your might. Now watch.
[1:07:54] And God will lead you. Then the
[1:07:56] footsteps of a righteous man, Amen, is
[1:08:00] ordered by the Lord. I love that. Jesus
[1:08:03] knew he was the son of God. I'll say
[1:08:06] this. This bride knows that she is the
[1:08:09] anointed, amen, true church of the
[1:08:12] living God. In Matthew 16, Jesus said,
[1:08:15] "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, amen,
[1:08:18] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:08:20] unto thee, but my father which is in
[1:08:23] heaven." I want you to catch something.
[1:08:25] And I say also unto thee, amen, that
[1:08:28] thou art Peter. And upon this rock,
[1:08:31] amen, I will build my church. Amen. He's
[1:08:34] not building Mary's church. He's not
[1:08:36] building Pope John's church. He's not
[1:08:38] building the Protestant denomination. He
[1:08:41] said, upon this rock, amen, I will build
[1:08:43] my church and the gates of hell shall
[1:08:46] not prevail against it. When you look
[1:08:48] there at that word build, it means to
[1:08:50] build up from the foundation. Listen, it
[1:08:53] means to restore by building. Amen. When
[1:08:56] you look at that word church, it is the
[1:08:58] whole body of Christians that are
[1:09:00] scattered, amen, throughout the earth.
[1:09:03] Listen, the prophet of God said the
[1:09:04] seventh church messenger, amen, was to
[1:09:07] restore the faith of the children, amen,
[1:09:10] back to the fathers. In other words, he
[1:09:12] will rebuild the church again, amen,
[1:09:15] under the power of the spirit. He will
[1:09:18] not do it by power, not by might, but by
[1:09:20] my spirit, saith the Lord. Amen. Not by
[1:09:23] organization. Amen. Not by denomination,
[1:09:26] but by the Holy Spirit. God will bring
[1:09:29] forth the church in the last days. He
[1:09:32] will bypass the Roman church. He will
[1:09:34] bypass her daughters and he will send an
[1:09:37] uneducated prophet into the earth with
[1:09:39] the word of God. and he will tear
[1:09:41] everything down to the foundation and
[1:09:44] say, "I will restore this church. But
[1:09:46] I'm not going to build it under
[1:09:47] education. I'm not going to build it
[1:09:49] under man's ideas. I'm going to build
[1:09:51] this church under the spirit of God,
[1:09:53] which were the sons of God. We'll be led
[1:09:56] by the spirit of God." Listen, church, a
[1:09:58] prophet took two sermons and preached
[1:10:00] why I'm why we're not a denomination.
[1:10:03] Amen. And why I'm against organized
[1:10:05] religion. Y'all ever heard them powerful
[1:10:07] tapes. Amen. There's about two and a
[1:10:09] half hours of preaching on both sermons.
[1:10:12] Amen. Can I sum up four hours of
[1:10:14] preaching for you in one in one
[1:10:15] statement? Amen. It's not the people,
[1:10:18] it's the system.
[1:10:20] Come on. It's not the people, it's the
[1:10:22] system. Amen. I tell you, if you get
[1:10:24] time, go listen to those. Amen. Cuz a
[1:10:26] prophet is not asking a question. Amen.
[1:10:28] He's making a declaration. Amen. He's
[1:10:31] saying the church is not a denomination.
[1:10:33] He said God never was in a denomination.
[1:10:36] Amen. And he's not an organization. He
[1:10:38] said the church is persons who have come
[1:10:41] in contact by the Holy Spirit with this
[1:10:43] person. Amen. Jesus Christ which is God
[1:10:47] revealed. Now listen I say this and you
[1:10:50] identify. Amen. That that is the one of
[1:10:52] Matthew 16. Amen. What is it? It's
[1:10:55] spiritual revelation. Amen. That the
[1:10:57] message sent to you is the person of
[1:11:00] Jesus Christ. Amen. To rebuild you into
[1:11:03] the stature of a perfect man. That's why
[1:11:06] the prophet said the word church means
[1:11:08] the called out. He said Israel was not
[1:11:10] the church of God. As long as they were
[1:11:12] in Egypt, they were the people of God.
[1:11:15] But when God called them out of Egypt,
[1:11:17] hallelujah, they become the church of
[1:11:19] God because they were the called out
[1:11:22] ones. He said, "See, you've been called
[1:11:24] out. You've been separated and made
[1:11:27] different. You've been called out.
[1:11:29] You've been separated and made
[1:11:31] different." Now in the Old Testament,
[1:11:33] the known church was called the kingdom
[1:11:35] of God. In other words, God is a king
[1:11:38] and the church is his domain. The church
[1:11:41] is not Mary's domain, folks. Amen. The
[1:11:44] church is not a bishop's domain. Amen.
[1:11:46] The church is God's domain, which is
[1:11:49] God's kingdom. In the Old Testament, it
[1:11:51] was God's kingdom. In the New Testament,
[1:11:53] it's called the Messiah Empire. He said,
[1:11:56] see, in other words, the Messiah's
[1:11:58] empire where the Messiah rules and
[1:12:00] reigns. no denominational barriers or
[1:12:03] nothing. Amen. The Messiah rules in his
[1:12:06] empire. It wasn't that. He said,
[1:12:08] "Therefore, the church is not an
[1:12:10] organization." He said, "The church is
[1:12:13] not a gathering of people." He said,
[1:12:15] "The church is the people of God that's
[1:12:18] been called out of the world." Amen. To
[1:12:21] serve in another kingdom. Brother Amos,
[1:12:24] the church is not a building. The church
[1:12:26] is not an organization. It's not a
[1:12:28] gathering of people. But the church is
[1:12:31] the people of God that have been called
[1:12:33] out of the world. Amen. To serve in
[1:12:35] another kingdom. Listen, you can gather
[1:12:37] 500 folks and have a meaningless
[1:12:39] gathering. Amen. You can gather a
[1:12:41] thousand and have a meaningless
[1:12:42] gathering. And don't get mad at me, but
[1:12:44] there's thousands up on top of thousands
[1:12:47] of meaningless gatherings around the
[1:12:49] world today. But here in Faith
[1:12:50] Tabernacle is some Holy Ghost filled
[1:12:53] sons and daughters of God that have been
[1:12:55] called out of this confusion. This is
[1:12:57] not just a service. This is not just a
[1:13:00] gathering. This is the revelation of
[1:13:02] Jesus Christ taken preeminence in the
[1:13:05] flesh of his people by the authority of
[1:13:07] the message of the hour. Listen, he's
[1:13:09] not our he's not our Aaron boy. He's our
[1:13:12] king.
[1:13:14] He's not our He's not our pinch in the
[1:13:16] our help in the time of a pinch. Amen.
[1:13:19] He's our life. Amen. He's our head chef.
[1:13:22] Listen, we don't do anything without
[1:13:24] him. We don't go anywhere without him.
[1:13:26] We don't pursue anything without him
[1:13:28] because we are his people. He is our
[1:13:31] king. Where the Messiah rules in every
[1:13:34] life in his dominion. Amen. Ruling the
[1:13:37] lives of his people. Amen. A called out
[1:13:41] people from every walk of life,
[1:13:44] gathering them together in a group. He
[1:13:46] said then calls it, Amen. his church or
[1:13:49] his called out ones. Amen. I love this.
[1:13:52] The church of God today is the same
[1:13:54] thing. It's called out of everything of
[1:13:56] the
[1:13:57] world. It's called out of every
[1:13:59] religious cult. It's called out of every
[1:14:02] religious denomination. It's called out
[1:14:04] of every religious organization. Amen.
[1:14:07] To walk with God. Not being governed by
[1:14:09] a bishop. Now, can I preach? Not being
[1:14:12] governed by a bishop, but being governed
[1:14:15] by Christ in the Messiah kingdom that we
[1:14:18] live in. Christ is the king. Amen.
[1:14:20] Christ is the one. Now watch a prophet
[1:14:23] bring it on down in paragraph 34. He
[1:14:26] says, "But the real church is the
[1:14:28] mystical body of Jesus Christ." Now you
[1:14:32] cannot organize, amen, the mystical body
[1:14:35] of Christ. Amen. So we've just
[1:14:37] identified, amen, what the real church
[1:14:40] is. It's not an organization. It's not a
[1:14:43] denomination. It's not a bunch of people
[1:14:46] gathered together in a building. Amen.
[1:14:48] It's not a bunch of people gathered
[1:14:49] under a headship of some denomination.
[1:14:52] Amen. But it's the mystical body of
[1:14:55] Jesus Christ. Now I'll say this. If we
[1:14:57] know what the real church is, then we
[1:14:59] have been given a scriptural description
[1:15:02] of what that church was to look like.
[1:15:04] 1951 expectation. He said Jesus
[1:15:07] described to us. Amen. Just what the
[1:15:10] church of the living God will look like.
[1:15:12] Amen. How many believes the prophet's
[1:15:14] interpretation? Now watch him. He says
[1:15:16] that and then he turns and he said in my
[1:15:19] name they'll cast out devils. They'll
[1:15:21] speak with new tongues. They'll take up
[1:15:23] serpents. They'll drink anything deadly.
[1:15:25] It will not hurt them. They'll lay their
[1:15:27] hands on the sick, brother Sean. And
[1:15:29] they shall recover. And he said, "The
[1:15:31] things that I do, Amen, shall you do
[1:15:34] also." Amen. So when you read Mark 16
[1:15:37] and you read John 14:12, you are reading
[1:15:40] a definite description of what God said.
[1:15:44] Amen. His church was going to look like.
[1:15:46] It was not going to look all fancy. It
[1:15:48] was not going to look all pretty. Amen.
[1:15:50] Amen. But it was going to look like God
[1:15:52] being manifested in the action of his
[1:15:54] word. What is the action of his word?
[1:15:56] Building hospitals? No. Building
[1:15:58] schools? No. Amen. Preaching the gospel.
[1:16:01] Laying hands on the sick. Casting out
[1:16:04] devils. believe it in the supernatural.
[1:16:06] Yes, sir. Amen. That is a definite
[1:16:09] description of what the church of the
[1:16:11] living God is going to look like. In
[1:16:13] Ephesians 1:22, Paul goes on to say
[1:16:16] this, "And hath put all things under his
[1:16:19] feet, and gave him to be the head over
[1:16:22] all things to the church."
[1:16:25] Look at verse 20 23. Which is his body,
[1:16:29] brother Terry. which is his body, the
[1:16:31] fullness of him that fillth all in all.
[1:16:35] In Colossians 1:17, Paul again, he is
[1:16:38] before all things, and by him all things
[1:16:41] consist. Now listen, verse 18, and he is
[1:16:44] the head of the body, which is the
[1:16:47] church, who is the beginning, amen, the
[1:16:50] firstborn from the dead, that in some
[1:16:53] things he might have the preeminence.
[1:16:55] Amen. In a few things he might have the
[1:16:57] preeminence, but in all things he might
[1:17:00] have the preeminence. Brother Bon said,
[1:17:02] "Who is the head of the church?" Jesus
[1:17:04] Christ. Amen. A church, a mystic body to
[1:17:08] which Christ is the head. Oh, I love
[1:17:10] that. Walking in the spirit and obeying
[1:17:13] the king, foolish to the world, precious
[1:17:16] in the sight of God, misunderstood,
[1:17:18] laughed at, made fun of. Amen. That's
[1:17:21] the church of the living God. Amen. The
[1:17:24] church of the living God is the body of
[1:17:28] Jesus Christ who has been called out of
[1:17:31] Leosa under the headship of the message
[1:17:34] and we're walking in the spirit obeying
[1:17:37] the king being made fun of by the world
[1:17:40] being ridiculed by society being
[1:17:42] pressured by religion but it don't
[1:17:44] change the fact that we have heard the
[1:17:46] eagle scream and we know where we come
[1:17:49] from we know where we're standing we
[1:17:51] know what we're preaching and praise God
[1:17:53] we know where we're going. We're not
[1:17:56] following a man, folks. We're following
[1:17:58] Jesus Christ who is the head of this
[1:18:00] church. Yes, sir. Paul goes on in
[1:18:03] Ephesians 4 and he says verse four, he
[1:18:05] said there is one body. Somebody shout
[1:18:07] one body.
[1:18:09] There is one body and there is one
[1:18:11] spirit even as ye are called in one hope
[1:18:15] of your calling. So there's one body,
[1:18:17] one spirit and one hope of your calling.
[1:18:20] He said there is one, now watch this.
[1:18:22] There is one universal mystical body.
[1:18:25] Can I say this? No local assembly is the
[1:18:28] whole
[1:18:29] body. Oh my. Can I preach? Amen. No
[1:18:33] pastor of one local assembly is the head
[1:18:35] of the whole body. But every assembly,
[1:18:39] amen, is a part of a universal mystical
[1:18:42] body. In other words, there is one body,
[1:18:44] amen, but it has many members within it.
[1:18:47] I love what the prophet said. He said
[1:18:49] God chose Paul and man chose Mias. He
[1:18:52] said they cast lots but he never did
[1:18:54] nothing. They chose what a power the
[1:18:56] church has then. Amen. To make a choice.
[1:18:59] Amen. To elect their deacons and send
[1:19:01] their preachers to different places. He
[1:19:03] said that's carnal. Many times he said
[1:19:05] let a man go where God leads him to go.
[1:19:07] He said I like that if the people have a
[1:19:09] conference just say well here's a nice
[1:19:11] church. Amen. Here's this. He put you in
[1:19:13] as a deacon. No. He said that only
[1:19:15] weakens the church. He said, now I want
[1:19:17] to say this very plainly if that's okay.
[1:19:20] He said, I believe in the supreme
[1:19:22] authority of the local assembly. Amen. I
[1:19:27] believe in the supreme authority of the
[1:19:30] local assembly. Now, I know this may get
[1:19:32] touchy, but let me just preach. Amen.
[1:19:34] Because it seems like that's becoming a
[1:19:35] thing of the past. Amen. All of a
[1:19:37] sudden, every church got to act like
[1:19:39] every other church, and we got to do
[1:19:40] everything somebody else is doing. If
[1:19:42] this church No, listen. This message is
[1:19:44] not a denomination. And we're not
[1:19:46] following some YouTube preacher. We're
[1:19:48] not following a bishop. We're not
[1:19:50] following a pope. Listen, if I'm not
[1:19:52] following the pope in Rome, I'm not
[1:19:54] following any pope around this message.
[1:19:56] If I'm not following what some man
[1:19:58] thinks I ought to do out of
[1:19:59] Jeffersonville or anywhere else, I'm not
[1:20:01] doing it. I have been called out of that
[1:20:03] confusion to be a walking, living,
[1:20:06] breathing member of the Church of the
[1:20:08] Living God. And I'll say this till my
[1:20:10] dying breath. Every local assembly is a
[1:20:12] sovereign assembly. And there's no
[1:20:14] headship outside of a local pastor over
[1:20:17] that church. Yes. He said, "Let each
[1:20:20] church be its own." Amen. Choose its
[1:20:22] pastors. Choose its deacons. Whatever it
[1:20:24] is. And then the way Amen. The man in
[1:20:26] there has no bishop over him. I love
[1:20:28] this. Amen. Brother Sean is a pastor.
[1:20:31] The Holy Spirit want to speak something
[1:20:33] that church. You don't have to ask
[1:20:34] anybody whether you can do it or not.
[1:20:37] Amen. It's the individual in contact.
[1:20:40] Amen. With the Holy Spirit. I say thank
[1:20:43] God for the message of the hour. I say
[1:20:45] thank God for the revelation being
[1:20:48] restored to the church that the church
[1:20:50] is a local sovereign assembly.
[1:20:54] He said, "Show me by the Bible what's
[1:20:55] greater than any local elder in the
[1:20:57] church." Yes, sir. The sovereignty of
[1:20:59] the local church. Each church in itself.
[1:21:02] Now, brotherhood, that's wonderful. All
[1:21:04] churches ought to be in brotherhood. But
[1:21:06] it's the sovereignty of the local
[1:21:08] church. Now, y'all know where I'm
[1:21:09] talking about. Amen. You know where I'm
[1:21:11] at. I'm right here in Leosa where
[1:21:13] religion has become society. It's become
[1:21:16] who's got this, who's got that, what
[1:21:18] programs can we offer? Amen. Who can do
[1:21:20] this, who can do that. And I say, God
[1:21:23] forbid that they ever come around our
[1:21:25] message. Amen. That our young people are
[1:21:27] drawn to some gymnasium or they're drawn
[1:21:29] to some some program or some system. I
[1:21:32] say if we ever get to that spot, let's
[1:21:34] dust the dust off the altar and pray the
[1:21:37] power of God back in the church. Our
[1:21:39] young people shouldn't be joining
[1:21:40] because of some program or some
[1:21:42] gymnasium or some some something we got
[1:21:45] to offer. They ought to be joining
[1:21:46] because in their soul is a gene seed of
[1:21:49] God that was placed there from before
[1:21:51] the foundation of the world. And that
[1:21:54] gene is looking for somewhere it can
[1:21:56] express itself as a manifested attribute
[1:21:59] of God in the age it's living in.
[1:22:01] Listen, this message is not a
[1:22:02] denomination and it's not an
[1:22:04] organization and no devil has any right
[1:22:06] to try to turn it into that.
[1:22:10] Well, you might as well shout amen out
[1:22:11] ouch. Oh, me my or something cuz I'm
[1:22:13] going on anyhow with Jesus just the
[1:22:15] same. I refuse to lose amen the
[1:22:18] sacredness of what this message come to
[1:22:21] produce. Refuse to lose it. He said the
[1:22:24] real church living God has no forms. It
[1:22:27] has no creeds. It's led by the power of
[1:22:29] God. Listen, that's in every
[1:22:31] individual's heart. He said, "Now, we're
[1:22:34] not trying to ask you, Amen, to join
[1:22:36] church or join some society. You must
[1:22:39] find yourself, Amen, a good church, a
[1:22:41] church of your choice." Listen, and
[1:22:43] there be a royal member of the family of
[1:22:45] Christ until death sets you free. He
[1:22:48] said, "See, Amen. Not trying," He said,
[1:22:50] "the world today, they're not trying to
[1:22:52] find the most spiritual church." Come
[1:22:54] on. He said they're looking, amen, for
[1:22:57] the biggest crowd, best dressed clothes,
[1:22:59] the biggest celebrities. He said that's
[1:23:01] called a better class. He said, in that
[1:23:03] church, then they'll try to find a
[1:23:04] minister, amen, that they called not too
[1:23:07] narrow-minded, that'll just about let
[1:23:09] them live any way they wish to and
[1:23:11] belong to that church. He said, but the
[1:23:13] spiritual man on the inside, if you'll
[1:23:15] give him the right away, he'll lead you
[1:23:17] to a little mission somewhere. Amen.
[1:23:19] Where the spirit of the living God is.
[1:23:21] Because the inside man feeds on the
[1:23:25] word. I say thank God for every
[1:23:27] lighthouse around this message. Amen.
[1:23:30] That's preaching this message. They're
[1:23:32] not promoting personalities. They're not
[1:23:34] promoting churches. They're not
[1:23:36] promoting directions. They're just
[1:23:38] standing on the side of the road
[1:23:39] somewhere holding up the message of the
[1:23:41] hour and saying, "My God is a savior. My
[1:23:44] God is a healer. My God is a deliverer.
[1:23:47] Yes, it may be ridiculed. Yes, it may be
[1:23:50] made fun of, but at least the anointing
[1:23:52] is upon it. Hallelujah. Amen. Is this
[1:23:55] okay? Amen. The prophet of God said it
[1:23:57] very beautiful. He said Jesus didn't
[1:23:59] come, Amen. contrary to the word, did
[1:24:02] he? But he come contrary to the
[1:24:05] organizational interpretation of the
[1:24:07] word. Amen. Now watch. Amen. He did not
[1:24:10] come contrary to the word. He come
[1:24:12] contrary, Amen, to the organizational
[1:24:15] interpretation of the word. That's why
[1:24:18] the church is not an organization.
[1:24:22] That's why it's not a denomination. He
[1:24:24] said, "Listen, you might think this
[1:24:26] little church is despised." Amen. This
[1:24:28] Holy Ghost gospel is ridiculed. He said,
[1:24:30] "Now listen, it might be despised, but
[1:24:33] it's reliable.
[1:24:36] It might be despised, but it's
[1:24:39] reliable." Y'all know what I'm talking
[1:24:40] about. Amen. When you know something's
[1:24:42] reliable, you don't care how much
[1:24:44] ridicule you got to bear. Amen. At least
[1:24:47] you know it's going to fire up when you
[1:24:48] need it. I got to thinking the other
[1:24:51] day. Amen. My grandfather, he was a big
[1:24:53] a big Ford guy, you know. God bless him.
[1:24:56] Amen. I'm a Chevy. He was a big Ford
[1:24:58] guy, you know. Amen. Brother Will had to
[1:25:00] have that old Ford. Amen. And I don't
[1:25:02] mean it's bad, but
[1:25:04] Amen. We went to school in them 56 rust
[1:25:07] buckets.
[1:25:08] Come on. And pull us up there and drop
[1:25:10] us off in that that 56 rust bucket or
[1:25:12] that 66 rust bucket. And I remember one
[1:25:15] day we went in the supply store and
[1:25:16] there was this guy just come in and he
[1:25:18] had just bought this brand new Ford
[1:25:20] F-150 ched out logos on it, business, I
[1:25:24] mean everything, you know. And he comes
[1:25:25] in there and he's just bragging up this
[1:25:27] truck and how powerful of a truck it is
[1:25:29] and how it's got all these features. Of
[1:25:30] course, this was early 2000s, so
[1:25:32] probably a CD player and heated seats
[1:25:33] was a big deal back then. He's bragging
[1:25:36] this truck up and how great it is, you
[1:25:38] know, and he gets in it and he's making
[1:25:40] fun of our my grandfather's little old
[1:25:42] 66 red truck there. And so we go out
[1:25:45] there and he climbs up in this big
[1:25:46] truck, bragged it all up, puts the key
[1:25:48] in the ignition, turns it over, and it
[1:25:50] won't
[1:25:51] start. Never will forget it, Brother
[1:25:53] Tim. I'm sitting in the passenger seat,
[1:25:55] probably on a bucket cuz the floor is
[1:25:56] about to fall out this. I'm sitting in
[1:25:58] the passenger seat and and my
[1:26:00] grandfather says, "I mean, let me roll
[1:26:02] the window down." So I roll the window
[1:26:04] down. I never forget it. And he hollers
[1:26:06] out the window. He says, "Hey, but it's
[1:26:08] reliable." Yeah. Yeah. Make fun of it
[1:26:12] all you want to, but it's reliable. It
[1:26:15] may not have all the bells and whistles,
[1:26:17] but it's reliable. At least it'll start
[1:26:19] and get you out of the parking lot. And
[1:26:21] sometimes, folks, I think we let the
[1:26:23] pressure of Leona, Amen, try to
[1:26:25] modernize our worship and modernize our
[1:26:28] praise. I think it's time to get back in
[1:26:30] the message of the hour. No matter how
[1:26:32] little, no matter how insignificant, no
[1:26:34] matter how despised it may look, Amen.
[1:26:37] Get back in them books and tapes and
[1:26:39] look that devil square in the face and
[1:26:41] say, "But at least it's reliable. At
[1:26:43] least it'll heal my babies when they're
[1:26:45] sick. At least it'll save my marriage
[1:26:47] when it's on the rocks. At least it'll
[1:26:49] revive my joy and restore unto me the
[1:26:52] peace that passes all understanding. It
[1:26:54] may be despised, but at least it'll
[1:26:57] start. At least it's reliable. At least
[1:26:59] it's going to take me out of time back
[1:27:01] into eternity where I come from.
[1:27:05] Yes, sir. Amen. It may be despised. It
[1:27:08] may be made fun of because it's not a
[1:27:10] part of the Philistines or a part of
[1:27:12] Saul, but at least it's reliable. At
[1:27:14] least it'll kill the bear. He said, "See
[1:27:17] what it is? It's that old reliable
[1:27:18] institution that was founded on the day
[1:27:21] of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came
[1:27:24] down." Somebody say, "The Holy Ghost.
[1:27:26] It's the most reliable firm I know to
[1:27:29] invest your soul and your future in
[1:27:32] eternity is in an old-fashioned
[1:27:34] Pentecostal experience. It's been
[1:27:37] time-tested, but it's proved to be the
[1:27:39] truth. 2,000 years and it hasn't changed
[1:27:42] a bit. See what it is? It's the
[1:27:45] spiritual revelation. Amen. Producing a
[1:27:48] spiritual
[1:27:49] church. Amen. The church of the living
[1:27:52] God. Amen. Is a spiritual church. He
[1:27:56] said the spiritual church still has the
[1:27:58] pillar of fire. It still has the signs
[1:28:01] and the wonders. It still has the same
[1:28:04] Christ which vindicates it all the way
[1:28:06] from the dying lamb in the garden of
[1:28:08] Eden until the second coming of the
[1:28:10] lamb. Absolutely. And it's the same
[1:28:13] yesterday, today, and forever. It's the
[1:28:17] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:28:20] Listen, brother Bam preaches another
[1:28:21] sermon and he calls it the uncertain
[1:28:23] sound. How many's heard that? He
[1:28:26] preaches it about seven times. And he
[1:28:28] reads 1 Corinthians 14:8 and says, "If
[1:28:31] the trumpet give an uncertain sound,
[1:28:34] then who shall prepare himself to the
[1:28:36] battle?" If the trumpet give an
[1:28:39] uncertain sound, then who shall prepare
[1:28:42] himself to the battle? He said, "Now,
[1:28:44] you've got to have the certainty of
[1:28:46] anything." We got to know, amen, whether
[1:28:49] it's right or not. So if you're going to
[1:28:52] have something, you got to have the
[1:28:54] certainty of what you have. You got to
[1:28:57] know if it's right or not. He said you
[1:28:59] then you say, "Brother Brandon, you're
[1:29:00] sure taking us out on a limb. Is there
[1:29:03] anything that is certain?" He said,
[1:29:04] "Nations is uncertain. Who knows that
[1:29:08] jobs is uncertain. Politics is
[1:29:10] uncertain. Church is uncertain. Home
[1:29:13] life is uncertain. What is certain? Is
[1:29:15] there anything that's certain?" He says,
[1:29:17] "Yes. There's one thing I'll guarantee
[1:29:20] you is certain, and that's the word of
[1:29:23] God. Listen, folks, if there's anything
[1:29:26] that you ought to be able to bank your
[1:29:27] life on is the word of God. Your job
[1:29:30] could be gone tomorrow. Amen. Homes
[1:29:33] could be gone tomorrow. Amen. Politics
[1:29:35] could fall apart. Nations have already
[1:29:37] fallen apart. But praise be unto God, we
[1:29:40] have received, hey, the word of God. And
[1:29:43] we finally have something that no matter
[1:29:45] how low we go, no matter how dark it
[1:29:48] gets, no matter how many trials we face,
[1:29:51] there is one thing we can raise our hand
[1:29:53] and say will never change. And that is
[1:29:55] the word of God. It'll be there on
[1:29:58] Monday. It'll be there on Tuesday. I
[1:30:00] feel like David when he said, "I may be
[1:30:02] forsaken, but oh God, you have never
[1:30:04] left me." Hey, what is the certainty?
[1:30:06] It's the word. Come on. It's the word.
[1:30:09] Look at this word certainty. It's the
[1:30:12] firm conviction that something is the
[1:30:14] case. It's the quality of being reliably
[1:30:17] true. It is a fact that is definitely
[1:30:20] true and it's an event that is
[1:30:22] definitely going to take place.
[1:30:26] Glory to God. I don't think it's a
[1:30:29] strange thing, brother Tim, that he
[1:30:30] preached the uncertain sound. I don't
[1:30:33] think it's a strange thing that he
[1:30:34] preached the five definite
[1:30:36] identifications of the church of the
[1:30:38] living God. Let me say this as plain as
[1:30:40] I know how. Amen. The certainty of the
[1:30:43] church is the message that it preaches
[1:30:46] and teaches. The certainty of this
[1:30:48] church, hey, is the message that it
[1:30:51] preaches and teaches. Can I say
[1:30:53] something to you? The certainty of any
[1:30:55] message church ought to be the message
[1:30:58] of the hour. It ought to be the firm
[1:31:01] conviction in the soul of every
[1:31:03] believer. It ought to be the firm
[1:31:05] reliable truth. Hey, that no matter what
[1:31:07] happens, Amen. we're going to hear the
[1:31:09] word of God. Amen. Can I just say this?
[1:31:11] When's the last time you thank God,
[1:31:13] Amen, for a local assembly that is under
[1:31:16] supreme authority of the message of the
[1:31:18] hour? When is the last time you got in
[1:31:20] your car and drove over to the church
[1:31:22] house and the whole way there you just
[1:31:25] raised your hand and said, "Thank God. I
[1:31:27] know this one thing. When I walk in the
[1:31:29] doors of Faith Tabernacle, I hear
[1:31:31] Brother Sean preach. It's going to be
[1:31:33] the message of the hour. When I hear the
[1:31:35] men of God behind that pull pit, it's
[1:31:37] going to be the message of the hour.
[1:31:39] Listen, I think it's time to get some
[1:31:40] joy, amen, back in our step. I think
[1:31:43] it's time to get some praise and
[1:31:45] thanksgiving back in our hearts. Listen,
[1:31:47] we may have a lot of problems and we may
[1:31:49] have a lot of situations, but when the
[1:31:51] dust settles and the smoke clears, the
[1:31:54] message of the hour will still be being
[1:31:56] raised as the end sign to this
[1:31:59] generation. Hallelujah. Somebody shout,
[1:32:02] "Thank God for the word." Thank God for
[1:32:04] the message of the hour. Thank God. Come
[1:32:07] on, parents. You ought to be thanking
[1:32:08] God that you can bring your babies to a
[1:32:11] church where they're going to hear the
[1:32:12] message of the hour. Listen, hey, I know
[1:32:14] it's got to where people say, "We got to
[1:32:16] have this program and have this event."
[1:32:18] I say, "Thank God we got some young
[1:32:20] people that's not looking forward to
[1:32:22] popcorn night and movie night out in the
[1:32:24] house of God. They're looking forward to
[1:32:25] Holy Ghost filled meetings." I say thank
[1:32:28] God we got some young people that ain't
[1:32:30] looking for recreation. They're just
[1:32:32] looking to get in the presence of God
[1:32:34] and get lost in the spirit and get
[1:32:36] consumed by the anointing till their
[1:32:38] problems fade away and their situations
[1:32:41] begin to
[1:32:42] change. Yes, sir. I'm talking about the
[1:32:45] message and I'll die on this mountain if
[1:32:47] I have to. The message of the hour ought
[1:32:50] to be the most thing your church is
[1:32:51] known for.
[1:32:55] ain't popular, brother Sean, but it's
[1:32:57] the truth.
[1:33:00] Well, glory to God. I feel good in the
[1:33:03] house of God on Sunday morning.
[1:33:07] Wherever we go, we're known for the
[1:33:09] message. Yes, sir. Now, probably God
[1:33:12] said, see, he said the message is true,
[1:33:15] right? Listen, and there's going to be
[1:33:17] an event. So when there's a certainty,
[1:33:21] that is a fact that something is true
[1:33:23] and there's a definite event going to
[1:33:25] take place as a direct result of what's
[1:33:28] been deemed certain. Are you with me?
[1:33:31] Brother said this. He said, "For we're
[1:33:34] looking forward to the greatest event
[1:33:35] that has ever happened in all human
[1:33:37] history or ever will." Amen. The second
[1:33:40] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, the son
[1:33:43] of God, to catch a church to himself and
[1:33:47] to take her to himself. What a glorious
[1:33:49] time that will be. There has been many
[1:33:52] great events has happened in the world.
[1:33:54] There's been many great things, but
[1:33:56] nothing like that. Listen, he said in
[1:33:59] end time evangelism, the end time
[1:34:01] message is to get the bride ready.
[1:34:05] And prepared for the rapture. Listen
[1:34:09] folks, don't get mad at me, but ball
[1:34:10] games ain't going to do it. Volleyball
[1:34:13] tournaments ain't going to do it.
[1:34:14] Recreational rooms ain't going to do it.
[1:34:17] only. And they say, "Well, you ought to
[1:34:18] be careful." No, that devil's trying to
[1:34:20] creep right around our own message.
[1:34:21] There's only one thing that's going to
[1:34:23] equip this young generation to withstand
[1:34:26] Goliath, and that is the preaching of
[1:34:28] the anointed word that has been revealed
[1:34:31] in the hour they're living in. And what
[1:34:33] can do it, brother Terry? Nothing but
[1:34:35] Malachi 4. He said, "I will restore,
[1:34:38] saith the Lord." That's the real event.
[1:34:41] Amen. That's the end time evangelism.
[1:34:45] The end time evangelism is the preaching
[1:34:48] of the message of the hour which is not
[1:34:51] coming from Rome and it's not coming
[1:34:53] from Cleveland or coming from some
[1:34:55] denomination. It's coming from the word.
[1:34:59] Hallelujah. He said see the first
[1:35:01] message of the church then it ought to
[1:35:03] be repentance. He said see Luke 24 he
[1:35:06] said the second message ought to be that
[1:35:08] Jesus is the king and he is alive
[1:35:10] forever more. Matthew 28. He said that's
[1:35:13] the message of his church. He said doing
[1:35:15] the works that he did. He said then the
[1:35:17] church ought to teach John 14:12. Amen.
[1:35:20] That greater works than this shall you
[1:35:21] do. For I go unto my father. He said
[1:35:24] that's the message of the church. If the
[1:35:26] church isn't teaching that than is
[1:35:29] teaching some false theology. Now I know
[1:35:32] folks, I know we got guys that sang
[1:35:34] through commentaries and sang through
[1:35:36] YouTube and sang through history books.
[1:35:38] Hey, but I say thank God we still got a
[1:35:40] few men. Amen. Will dedicate themselves
[1:35:43] and sing to the confines of this
[1:35:45] message. Amen. Because anything outside
[1:35:47] of this message is some false theology.
[1:35:52] He said that's what Jesus commanded him
[1:35:54] to preach. And he said, "Look, that's
[1:35:56] definite." Amen. I love that word
[1:35:58] definite. It means clearly defined. It
[1:36:01] means exact or certain. It is implying
[1:36:04] that something is fixed. It is settled.
[1:36:07] And it is known without a doubt. I want
[1:36:10] to say this morning, the message of the
[1:36:11] hour is fixed in my heart. It is settled
[1:36:15] in my spirit and my body knows without a
[1:36:18] doubt that one of these days, this
[1:36:20] message is going to lead me to a change.
[1:36:23] Listen, folks, there's a great event
[1:36:25] coming. It's called the rapture. But you
[1:36:27] got to stay in the church of the living
[1:36:31] God. Hallelujah. Mark 16 ought to be
[1:36:34] preached. He said, "Let that be his last
[1:36:36] message." Amen. Follow out the
[1:36:38] commission. Now listen. Mark 16:14.
[1:36:40] Afterward, he appeared to the 11 after
[1:36:42] his resurrection, and they sat at meat
[1:36:45] and it breathed them with their unbelief
[1:36:48] and the hardness of heart. Now, I want
[1:36:50] you to watch something here. Because
[1:36:52] they believe not. Now, notice
[1:36:54] this, brother Terry. It doesn't say
[1:36:58] because they believe not on
[1:37:01] him. Does it say that because they
[1:37:05] believed not on him which had seen him
[1:37:06] after he was risen? No, because they
[1:37:09] believed not on them. Oh, God. Because
[1:37:13] they believe not on them which had seen
[1:37:16] him after he was risen. So there is some
[1:37:20] them. There is he and there's a
[1:37:22] resurrection. Come on folks. Brother
[1:37:25] Brandham said all the coldest winter has
[1:37:27] killed out. The nearing of the presence
[1:37:29] of the son of God will resurrect in the
[1:37:32] last days. I don't mind telling you,
[1:37:34] brother Judah. I'm one of them. I'm one
[1:37:36] of them. Mark 16:14 believers who has
[1:37:39] seen him. I have seen his appearing. I
[1:37:42] have heard the eagle scream and I have
[1:37:44] believed on him. He is not in a grave in
[1:37:47] Jerusalem. He is not in a tube in
[1:37:49] Jeffersonville. He is alive and well.
[1:37:52] And he's right here this morning in the
[1:37:54] church of the living God giving witness
[1:37:56] that he is the same yesterday, today,
[1:38:00] and
[1:38:01] forever. Brother Kevin, where's he doing
[1:38:03] it? In our flesh.
[1:38:06] Somebody had seen him. Somebody shout,
[1:38:09] "I seen him." I seen him. Anybody seen
[1:38:13] him? Has anybody seen him? I seen him. I
[1:38:18] seen him this morning. I seen him in the
[1:38:20] trees. I seen him in the birds. I seen
[1:38:22] him in the mountains. I seen him in the
[1:38:24] church. I seen him in his word. I seen
[1:38:27] him in the
[1:38:28] message. Hallelujah. I have seen him. If
[1:38:32] that isn't the same thing today, Amen.
[1:38:34] seen him do that. How many seen him do
[1:38:36] it? Sure, we know he does it. They
[1:38:38] didn't believe it then. They don't
[1:38:40] believe it now. They believe he died in
[1:38:42] that settled. And we got some kind of
[1:38:44] historical thing that some fellow raised
[1:38:46] up a few years ago and established a
[1:38:48] church. Now listen, and wrote a
[1:38:50] catechism and that's what we hold on to.
[1:38:53] Can I say what he said? That's pagan.
[1:38:57] That's pagan. Yes, sir. He said, "No
[1:39:00] truth to it. God don't control his
[1:39:03] church like that. He said, "Now go you
[1:39:05] into all the world and preach the
[1:39:09] gospel. Go ye into all the world and
[1:39:12] preach the gospel to every creature."
[1:39:15] You say, "Well, brother Andrew, I'm not
[1:39:16] a preacher. I don't hold a microphone."
[1:39:18] Do you realize the prophet of God said
[1:39:20] you live a sermon rather than preach a
[1:39:22] sermon? Brother said like this. He said,
[1:39:25] "The gospel is the power of God to make
[1:39:27] the word act what it says it'll do." He
[1:39:30] said, "Preach the gospel to all the
[1:39:32] world. Preach it to the black, the
[1:39:34] white, or the yellow or red." No, to
[1:39:36] every creature. Amen. Every creature.
[1:39:39] You believe that means it. He said, "I
[1:39:41] seen God baffle a bull one day." He
[1:39:44] said, "I seen him cause hornets." Amen.
[1:39:46] Not to sting. I seen him raise up a
[1:39:48] possum that been laying dead. Amen. All
[1:39:51] night. Are you hearing me? Amen. A
[1:39:53] prophet preached the gospel to a bull.
[1:39:56] He preached it to hornets. He preached
[1:39:58] it to a possum. He said, "Because the
[1:40:00] gospel will take effect upon anything
[1:40:02] that you ask." Oh, that is why I'm on
[1:40:05] the field. That is why I'm traveling
[1:40:07] preaching. It's not because of Andrew
[1:40:09] Glover or any other preacher around this
[1:40:11] message. It's because in my soul is a
[1:40:14] certainty that if I'll preach this
[1:40:16] message and ask God to back it up, it'll
[1:40:19] take an effect on a teenager. It'll take
[1:40:21] an effect on an adult. It'll take effect
[1:40:23] on an
[1:40:24] elder. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's let the
[1:40:27] restraints off and have church this
[1:40:29] morning. This is a full gospel bride. We
[1:40:32] believe in the authority of the gospel
[1:40:34] of Jesus Christ. It still heals the
[1:40:36] sick. It still cast out devils. It still
[1:40:39] raises the dead. It still speaks in
[1:40:42] tongues. It still sees visions. Angels
[1:40:44] still visit the church because this is
[1:40:47] not a denomination. It's the
[1:40:50] church. It's the church of the living
[1:40:54] God. the gospel was preached. Let me say
[1:40:57] this. Why do you preach his message with
[1:40:59] such authority? Because I know if I
[1:41:01] preach it, it'll curse anything. I ask
[1:41:03] God to curse it. Come on. Bam said,
[1:41:06] "Jesus walked by there that day and he
[1:41:08] cursed that tree and said, from this day
[1:41:10] forth, henceforth no man eat fruit from
[1:41:12] you." He said, "And the gospel killed
[1:41:15] the
[1:41:16] tree." Glory to God. Brother Sean, the
[1:41:19] same gospel that killed the tree is the
[1:41:22] same gospel that raised Lazarus.
[1:41:25] Y'all thought about that? The same
[1:41:27] gospel, Sister Jane, that killed that
[1:41:30] tree is the same gospel that raised up
[1:41:33] that mama
[1:41:34] possum. That's right. The same gospel,
[1:41:37] hey, that destroyed, Amen. nations and
[1:41:40] destroyed kingdoms has raised up a
[1:41:42] bride. And listen, we're here to give
[1:41:44] witness to it. These signs shall follow
[1:41:47] them that believe. Who's going to preach
[1:41:50] it?
[1:41:53] Who's going to preach it? Come on. Amen.
[1:41:55] I think every believer, honestly, I'm
[1:41:57] going to. That's right. No, you ain't
[1:42:00] going to take a microphone, sis. But
[1:42:02] you're going to live a sermon. And your
[1:42:04] life is going to preach that Jesus
[1:42:06] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:42:09] forever. He's a God of repentance. He's
[1:42:12] a God of forgiveness. He's a God of
[1:42:14] divine healing. He's a God of water
[1:42:16] baptism. Come on, folks. I think it's
[1:42:18] time, amen, to clean out the rose and go
[1:42:21] back to the old landmarks of what this
[1:42:23] message is. It is the preaching of the
[1:42:26] authoritative word in the hour that
[1:42:28] we're living in. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:42:32] It preaches divine healing. It believes
[1:42:34] in water baptism. Yes, sir. Because all
[1:42:37] the power of God ever puts forth another
[1:42:39] church, it'll be another Pentecost.
[1:42:42] Another book of Acts will be wrote
[1:42:44] behind it. Amen. Because it's the church
[1:42:49] of God. How many knows Jesus said, "I am
[1:42:52] the vine. Ye are the branches. You
[1:42:55] cannot bear fruit in yourself." Brother
[1:42:57] Sean, I love a prophet's interpretation.
[1:43:00] He says, "But I throw my own self into
[1:43:03] the branch." Woo! Glory, Sister Alice.
[1:43:06] God has thrown himself into you. He has
[1:43:10] thrown himself into you, sis. Amen. Come
[1:43:12] on, young people. God hath thrown
[1:43:15] himself into you. Why has he thrown
[1:43:17] himself into you? Because a little while
[1:43:19] and the world seeth me no more, but you
[1:43:21] shall see me. For I will be with you,
[1:43:24] even in you every branch to the end of
[1:43:28] the world. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If
[1:43:31] Christ, Amen, would let not let a bunch
[1:43:34] of men who walked with him for three and
[1:43:35] a half years go preach any gospel or
[1:43:37] could not preach any gospel until they
[1:43:40] waited for the Holy Ghost. He said the
[1:43:42] church today has to do the same thing.
[1:43:46] The power of the church. Come on, folks.
[1:43:49] How many can agree what we teach and
[1:43:50] preach is under the authority of the
[1:43:52] word of
[1:43:55] God. Brother Sean, we've been down them
[1:43:57] battles before. Well, brother taught
[1:43:59] things that ain't scripture. Yeah, he
[1:44:00] did. He's got a scripture for everything
[1:44:02] he taught. It's real simple. Malachi 45
[1:44:04] and 6.
[1:44:09] Well, amen.
[1:44:11] The power of the church comes from the
[1:44:13] authority that it's under. Said, "We
[1:44:16] don't have any power, but we have
[1:44:18] authority." Yes, sir. It don't take
[1:44:20] power. Someone said, "You got any
[1:44:22] power?" I said, "No, but I got
[1:44:23] authority." He said, "Like little
[1:44:25] policeman down here." Amen. His hat is
[1:44:27] too big for him. It sets down over his
[1:44:29] ears. He hasn't got power to stop
[1:44:32] nothing. Come on. But let him walk out
[1:44:35] here and a car coming down the street
[1:44:37] with a 300 horsepower engine and let him
[1:44:40] raise up his
[1:44:42] hand. Let him raise up a hand and watch
[1:44:45] the brake slide. Why? He hasn't got no
[1:44:48] power but he's got authority. And when a
[1:44:51] man or woman is anointed with the
[1:44:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost, when a man or
[1:44:55] woman is anointed with the baptism of
[1:44:57] the Holy Ghost, he might not be able to
[1:45:00] read his name in box cariz with
[1:45:03] education, but he has got authority from
[1:45:05] God. He is a son of God. So let him take
[1:45:08] his authority and stand up and say,
[1:45:11] "Stop." And Satan's wheels will slide
[1:45:14] and his brakes will too. Woo! Glory. Do
[1:45:18] you see who you are? You are the church
[1:45:21] of the living God who a prophet
[1:45:23] fundamentally established you under the
[1:45:26] scripture of the hour that you're living
[1:45:28] in. You got a right today to stand up
[1:45:30] and look that devil's prayer in the face
[1:45:33] and say stop.
[1:45:36] You got a right, brother Amos, to tell
[1:45:37] that devil, stop. That devil racking
[1:45:39] pain in your body, you got a right to
[1:45:41] say stop. That devil got you all nervous
[1:45:44] and tore up. You got a right to say
[1:45:46] stop. That devil got your family all
[1:45:48] messed up. You got a right to stand up
[1:45:51] on the authority of the definite
[1:45:53] identification of the church of the
[1:45:55] living God and say, "Devil, you've gone
[1:45:57] as far as you're going to go. You rode
[1:45:59] as hard towards me as you're going to
[1:46:00] ride.
[1:46:02] Stop. Come on. Stop." You said,
[1:46:05] "Brother, that ain't going to do
[1:46:06] nothing. It's doing something right now.
[1:46:08] Stop. Devil, stop, devil." Devil says,
[1:46:11] "I'm gonna take your kids." Say, "Devil,
[1:46:13] stop." Devil say I'm gonna take your
[1:46:15] health. Devil, stop and restore it
[1:46:18] back. Brother Daniel, I'm not a crazy
[1:46:21] man. I'm a David. I'm a king. I'm a son
[1:46:24] of God. I'm between Saul. I'm between
[1:46:27] Philistines. But in my soul is the
[1:46:30] anointed word as the church of the
[1:46:32] living God. The Baptist ain't behind me.
[1:46:34] The Pentecostals don't like me. That's
[1:46:36] the message probably trying to shut me
[1:46:38] up. But I have an authority by the
[1:46:40] anointing of the word of God to tell
[1:46:43] that devil, Satan, you've gone as far as
[1:46:45] you're going to
[1:46:46] go. God is not just
[1:46:50] was. Come on. God was not just manifest
[1:46:53] in the flesh. God is
[1:46:56] manifested in the flesh in the church of
[1:47:00] the living God.
[1:47:03] Hallelujah. something will take place
[1:47:06] because you've been given authority by
[1:47:08] the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:11] It's written over in John 1, I think
[1:47:13] about the 15th chapter. If you abide in
[1:47:16] me and my word in you, here it is. The
[1:47:20] word abides in you. Oh, glory. That
[1:47:24] makes me want to shout hallelujah.
[1:47:26] Hallelujah. The word abides in you. then
[1:47:30] ask what you will and it'll be done
[1:47:33] because it's not you.
[1:47:37] Well, I'd say something, but I just want
[1:47:39] to be humble, you know, and I I I'd stop
[1:47:41] this devil, but I just want to be a
[1:47:43] humble little old Christian.
[1:47:45] And y'all heard me say it before. My
[1:47:48] high school teacher said the Bible said
[1:47:49] be meek didn't say nothing about being
[1:47:51] weak.
[1:47:54] Come on. You can be a meek, weak
[1:47:56] Christian or you can be a meek,
[1:47:58] authoritative Christian. That's right,
[1:48:00] brother. Come on, folks. Are you hearing
[1:48:03] me? Amen. Do you think the president
[1:48:05] walks around? I better not use him as a
[1:48:07] bad. Amen. Amen. Do Do
[1:48:10] you Come on. I got to move on. I got in
[1:48:13] trouble right there. Ain't a ain't a
[1:48:15] humble bone in that man's
[1:48:17] body. But you can be humble and still
[1:48:20] have authority. Come on, church. William
[1:48:22] Brandom stood on platforms. Amen. A
[1:48:25] five, six foot, five, five or six foot
[1:48:27] little frail man. Amen. Body depleted of
[1:48:29] strength, but he stood there and them
[1:48:31] demons come up before him. Then demons
[1:48:34] were wrecking lives. But he stood there
[1:48:36] as a member of the church of the living
[1:48:39] God. And he said, "Satan, I take every
[1:48:42] spirit in this building under my control
[1:48:44] for the glory of God. Satan, I adjure
[1:48:47] thee in the name of Jesus Christ. take
[1:48:50] your hands off of God's property. And
[1:48:53] people that was on the way to the
[1:48:54] graveyard met the pillar of fire and
[1:48:56] they went from the graveyard to a
[1:48:58] hallelujah meeting because they met the
[1:49:01] power of God in the
[1:49:04] church. Come on. Y'all heard y'all heard
[1:49:06] what's his name? Uh TL Osborne. Y'all
[1:49:09] heard his testimony. He said, "I sit
[1:49:11] there and watch that frail frame of a
[1:49:12] man stand up before them sick people.
[1:49:15] Watch the demon manifestation."
[1:49:18] Y'all know he said that, right? He said,
[1:49:20] "I watched a demon manifestation." He
[1:49:22] said, "I was a good
[1:49:24] Pentecostal." He said, "I was in the
[1:49:26] balcony." And he said, "I was watching
[1:49:28] him." And he said, "They brought this
[1:49:29] demonic manifestation in front of
[1:49:31] Brother Brandham." He said, "Brother
[1:49:33] Brandon, just stood there for a second."
[1:49:34] And he said, "Now, me a good
[1:49:36] Pentecostal." He said, "I was raring to
[1:49:38] go." You know, he said, "I had to get
[1:49:39] the music going. Had to get everything
[1:49:42] fired up." He said, "I knew the right
[1:49:43] words to scream." He said, "We had to
[1:49:45] get it real loud for that devil to go."
[1:49:47] He said, "But before," Oh, God. He said,
[1:49:50] "But before I could look," he said, "I
[1:49:53] opened my eyes and the person was
[1:49:56] completely gone." He said, "The demon
[1:49:58] was completely gone. They were
[1:50:00] completely changed."
[1:50:03] He said, "And all that done it," he
[1:50:05] said, was brother, stood there and he
[1:50:07] said, "Satan, in the name of Jesus
[1:50:09] Christ, by the authority of Almighty
[1:50:12] God, I adure thee in the name of Jesus,
[1:50:15] take your hands off of God's property."
[1:50:17] And he said that demon fell off and he
[1:50:19] said the person went free. Come on,
[1:50:21] folks. We made it too
[1:50:24] complicated. Now, listen, I believe in
[1:50:26] praying, don't you? And I just be honest
[1:50:29] with you. Amen. I like somebody to pray
[1:50:31] for me that's got some feeling in
[1:50:33] it. Well, somebody shout hallelujah.
[1:50:36] Hey, brother Sean. You like somebody
[1:50:38] pray for you got a little feeling in it?
[1:50:40] A I tell you what. Amen. I know guys go
[1:50:42] around knocking people for praying loud
[1:50:44] and Amen. It don't take all that loud
[1:50:45] prayer. And hey, I understand God moves
[1:50:47] on quiet prayers and he moves on loud
[1:50:49] prayers. Hey, but I tell you something
[1:50:51] like this. Amen. I grew up in the Jewel
[1:50:53] Fory days. I grew up in those days,
[1:50:55] amen, where you got spit on, sweated on,
[1:50:57] and the devil got stomped on. But when
[1:50:59] it was all said and done, hey, the devil
[1:51:01] left because the son of God knew his
[1:51:04] position as a child of God. Come on,
[1:51:06] folks. I think it's time, amen, to quit
[1:51:08] putting everybody in a box and say you
[1:51:10] got to pray this way or preach this way.
[1:51:11] I say, let everybody be who God called
[1:51:14] him to be. If you want to shout that
[1:51:16] devil down, shout him down. You want to
[1:51:18] praise that devil down, praise him down.
[1:51:20] You want to wave that devil down. Or you
[1:51:22] want to sit there and say, "Devil, go."
[1:51:24] But just know who you are as a church of
[1:51:28] the living God.
[1:51:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I probably
[1:51:36] shouldn't tell this, but I'm going to
[1:51:37] tell it. Brother Tim, I was a little boy
[1:51:39] about 9 years old. We was having a
[1:51:40] meeting there and Juel, Brother Juwel
[1:51:42] come down and this I never will forget
[1:51:44] it. Brother Terry, you probably sitting
[1:51:45] there beside me. Brother A was shouting
[1:51:47] on one side of us or something sitting
[1:51:49] right there. And brother Juel come up
[1:51:51] and this lady come up and I never will
[1:51:52] forget it. She poured her heart out. She
[1:51:55] like, she gave every detail on top of
[1:51:57] details on top of details. That's
[1:51:59] probably about five minutes.
[1:52:02] I want Brother
[1:52:03] Juwel. He just stood there and he stood
[1:52:05] there and all of a sudden he just raised
[1:52:06] his head. He said, "Spirit go in the
[1:52:08] name of Jesus."
[1:52:11] Turned around, walked off.
[1:52:14] That woman's free today, folks.
[1:52:17] Hallelujah. I know her. What are you
[1:52:19] saying? I'm saying sometimes we stay in
[1:52:21] the past too long. Sometimes we keep
[1:52:24] trying to relive it and rechange it.
[1:52:25] Listen, there's got to come a time we
[1:52:27] let it go and recognize that our our
[1:52:31] position is not determined by our
[1:52:33] reputation. Sister Lisa, our position is
[1:52:36] determined by the revelation in our
[1:52:39] soul. If you've been in wisdom versus
[1:52:40] faith, you've been hearing it all week.
[1:52:42] Are you hearing me? You got to know who
[1:52:44] you are. 150 votes coming one way and
[1:52:47] 150 coming another way. And the devil's
[1:52:50] got to flee because when the church
[1:52:52] recognizes who she is,
[1:52:55] hallelujah, then the rapture will go.
[1:52:59] It's not you. It's the word that's in
[1:53:02] you.
[1:53:04] And the word is God. See, God is in you.
[1:53:08] God is the word. In the beginning was
[1:53:11] the word and the word was with God and
[1:53:15] the word was God. and the word was made
[1:53:20] flesh and dwelt among
[1:53:23] us. Now, I know what that devil says.
[1:53:25] That devil says, "Well, praise God.
[1:53:28] Everybody's everybody's just sitting
[1:53:30] around waiting on Brother Brandon to
[1:53:31] come back cuz there ain't no corporal
[1:53:32] body
[1:53:33] here." Well, read the rest of what he
[1:53:36] said. He said, "But now in the return of
[1:53:40] the Holy Spirit, he is bringing the word
[1:53:43] in us and it's abiding in there." Then
[1:53:46] it's not you that speaks, it's the word
[1:53:50] itself coming out.
[1:53:52] Amen. So it the word will
[1:53:56] perform the work.
[1:53:59] It's not you, it's the word. Can I say
[1:54:03] this to you today? The days of presuming
[1:54:07] are over.
[1:54:09] The church of the living God does not
[1:54:11] just have authority. We have supreme
[1:54:14] authority. And supreme authority is the
[1:54:17] authority or an office. Now listen.
[1:54:21] Okay. Authority is is the is the office
[1:54:25] or it's the Amen. I'm I'm I'm hurrying.
[1:54:28] It's the office or it's the recognition
[1:54:31] of a position. But supreme authority is
[1:54:35] when someone holds it.
[1:54:38] Glory to God. Supreme authority is when
[1:54:42] somebody steps into that office and
[1:54:45] holds that office. Hallelujah. Their
[1:54:48] being in that office identifies them as
[1:54:51] supreme authority. Now you know I can't
[1:54:53] say that without going to Matthew 17 up
[1:54:56] on Mount Transfiguration. And they all
[1:54:58] heard a voice. And it said this, "Hear
[1:55:01] ye
[1:55:03] him. Hear ye him." Rebraham said,
[1:55:06] "There's many voices in the world today.
[1:55:08] There's many things going on. There's
[1:55:10] many doctrines." How many can agree?
[1:55:12] There's many isms, but hear ye him. He's
[1:55:16] the voice of final authority. He's the
[1:55:19] one that'll speak. He's the one, Sister
[1:55:23] Jame, that'll speak. He's the one that
[1:55:25] said, "Heaven and earth will pass away,
[1:55:27] but my word shall never fail. So hear ye
[1:55:31] him." He's the one to listen to. Luke
[1:55:36] 16:16, "The law and the prophets run
[1:55:38] till John. And since that time the
[1:55:40] kingdom of God is preached, and every
[1:55:43] man presseth into it." Amen. The kingdom
[1:55:47] of God is preached, and every man
[1:55:50] pressth into it. Amen. Hebrews 1:1, God
[1:55:53] who at sund dry times and in diverse
[1:55:55] manner spake in times past, amen, by
[1:55:58] unto the fathers by the prophets, but
[1:56:01] hath in these last days, somebody say
[1:56:03] last days, hath last days spoken unto us
[1:56:06] by his son, whom he hath appointed heir
[1:56:09] of all things, by whom also he made the
[1:56:12] world. Can I tie something together?
[1:56:14] Whom he hath appointed here, ye him.
[1:56:18] whom he hath appointed hear ye him. You
[1:56:22] say, "Well, praise God." Amen. Then the
[1:56:24] days of prophets are over. Oh, but wait
[1:56:26] a second. But in the days of the voice
[1:56:29] of the seventh angel, when he shall
[1:56:31] begin to sound, the mystery of God
[1:56:34] should be finished as he hath declared
[1:56:36] to his servants, the prophets. Watch a
[1:56:39] prophet. Revelation 18, he said, "This
[1:56:41] angel li remember the last angel is the
[1:56:44] angel in the church age to the Leosa.
[1:56:46] It's the Leodysa messenger. It's the
[1:56:49] last because the very next chapter is
[1:56:52] 19th chapter which is the coming bride.
[1:56:55] He said this angel's messenger come from
[1:56:57] God. He was echoing his message on the
[1:57:00] earth to come out of Babylon to come out
[1:57:04] of the organization. Listen, the Holy
[1:57:06] Spirit today, the manifestation of the
[1:57:09] Holy Spirit is that angel trying to get
[1:57:12] the people back to the word because the
[1:57:16] Holy Spirit will only vindicate the
[1:57:18] word.
[1:57:21] God's voice speaking to his
[1:57:23] predestinated people saying, "Come out
[1:57:26] of her. Come out of her. Come out of
[1:57:29] her." Listen, folks. I know we're beside
[1:57:32] the Catholics. I know we're between the
[1:57:34] pro Protestants. I know there's
[1:57:36] pressures on every hand. I know
[1:57:38] situations were rising. But we've had a
[1:57:40] vision among us. I'm going to pick it up
[1:57:42] in paragraph 270. Knoweth it not. He
[1:57:44] said, "And I seen it coming and I
[1:57:46] watched it." And what it was, it was a
[1:57:48] man on a horse. Anybody want to hear
[1:57:49] this today, you can go home and listen
[1:57:50] to it. Knoweth it not. Find the place
[1:57:52] where brother says if you give me a few
[1:57:54] more minutes and listen from there to
[1:57:55] the end. I don't have time to read the
[1:57:57] whole thing. He said, "But I watched
[1:57:58] it." What it was? It was a man on a
[1:58:01] horse and said he was coming with
[1:58:02] lightning speed and said I seen he was
[1:58:04] going to come down in front of me and I
[1:58:06] stopped my car and I jumped out and when
[1:58:08] it did said the car said the horse was
[1:58:10] standing in the road a great white
[1:58:13] military horse walking in a branch. I
[1:58:16] love that brother Terry. He said that's
[1:58:17] the word of course you know walking in a
[1:58:20] branch and said there was a man sitting
[1:58:22] on there. Glory to God. Hallelujah. We
[1:58:26] now have God. Hallelujah. The horse was
[1:58:30] representing that word, right? He said
[1:58:32] that was the word. He said, but there
[1:58:34] was a man sitting on there and said he
[1:58:36] was dressed in western garb. He wasn't a
[1:58:39] cowboy, but he said look like a chief
[1:58:41] over rangers or something and see all of
[1:58:43] his chief authority from the west, the
[1:58:46] Indians over the Indians, rangers
[1:58:47] overseas. And the man had his hat pulled
[1:58:50] down and was looking sideways and said
[1:58:52] when he turned sideways said, "It was
[1:58:54] you, brother Random." Glory. We had the
[1:58:58] word which was the authority but until a
[1:59:01] voice came upon that authority we didn't
[1:59:03] know what to believe but he said oh you
[1:59:06] never talk like you did you said junior
[1:59:08] called him three times said I'll tell
[1:59:10] you what to do said then you pulled up
[1:59:12] on the range of the horse you made about
[1:59:14] three lops and took to the skies you
[1:59:16] were gone towards the west can I tell
[1:59:18] you what happened we now have supreme
[1:59:22] authority on the word we don't just have
[1:59:25] a headless horse or a headless word. We
[1:59:27] now have a voice to interpret that word.
[1:59:30] I say to you this morning, Faith
[1:59:32] Tabernacle, take off your sad shoes. Get
[1:59:35] your harps out of the willow tree. Put
[1:59:37] on your shouting shoes this morning. We
[1:59:39] have supreme authority from Genesis to
[1:59:42] Revelation. Brother Levi, there ain't no
[1:59:44] question in my mind on where this bride
[1:59:46] is headed. We have heard the message. We
[1:59:49] have been identified by the word and we
[1:59:52] are headed to translation.
[1:59:54] Sister Jane, you didn't know it, but on
[1:59:56] the way to church Wednesday night, I was
[1:59:57] listening to you singing. I singing in
[1:59:59] the car with you. Press on. Press on.
[2:00:02] Are you hearing me this morning? Listen
[2:00:04] to me, little bride. Get back in the
[2:00:06] message. Get back in the tapes. Break
[2:00:08] open the books. Thank God for streaming.
[2:00:11] But somewhere or another, we going to
[2:00:12] have to get back to what the prophet
[2:00:13] said and stand on supreme authority and
[2:00:17] say, "Devil, stop.
[2:00:20] Devil, stop. Let the musicians come this
[2:00:25] morning. We now have someone holding the
[2:00:28] office of supreme authority, brother
[2:00:31] Sean, among the
[2:00:34] church. Who is it, brother Terry? Is it
[2:00:37] brother so and so? Or is it this
[2:00:39] preacher or this pastor? Brother Bramman
[2:00:41] said they turned and he turned to the
[2:00:43] side and they said, "Well, brother B,
[2:00:44] that's
[2:00:45] you." It was him on that word.
[2:00:49] That's why when the dust settles and the
[2:00:50] smoke clears, make sure you're found
[2:00:53] saying what he said about the subject.
[2:00:57] Amen. He said he was on that horse and
[2:01:00] you were chief authority. Hallelujah. I
[2:01:03] I ran out of time, but y'all know
[2:01:04] there's three pools right there.
[2:01:07] John 13:20 says this, "Verily, verily I
[2:01:09] say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever
[2:01:12] I send receiveth me." And he that
[2:01:15] receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
[2:01:20] He said, "There's no need to look back.
[2:01:22] Look up. Behold him who is even now
[2:01:25] walking in the midst of the churches
[2:01:27] through all ages. Behold him who is the
[2:01:30] same yesterday, today, and forever. Who
[2:01:32] never changes either in essence or in
[2:01:34] his ways. where two or three are
[2:01:36] gathered together in his name, there he
[2:01:37] is in the midst. And not only in their
[2:01:39] midst as a complacent onlooker or as a
[2:01:42] recording angel, but he stands
[2:01:44] expressing exactly Hallelujah.
[2:01:48] But there he stands expressing exactly
[2:01:51] what he is. He is the life, the
[2:01:55] sustainer, and the giver of all good
[2:01:58] gifts to the church. Amen. What are you
[2:02:00] saying, brother, Andrew? I'm saying he
[2:02:03] is manifesting his
[2:02:04] authority through his church.
[2:02:07] And you are that church.
[2:02:11] You are that
[2:02:13] church between the Protestants and
[2:02:16] Catholics just like
[2:02:18] David. But coming into power,
[2:02:23] coming into power.
[2:02:25] I know sometimes I know sometimes people
[2:02:28] probably think I'm
[2:02:29] crazy, but there ain't nobody I'd rather
[2:02:32] hear than somebody in this bride
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:36] sing. You know why? Cuz they're singing
[2:02:39] with
[2:02:41] power. Nobody I'd rather hear preach
[2:02:44] than men of God in this
[2:02:46] message that are preaching this
[2:02:49] message. Cuz there's no question.
[2:02:52] There's no
[2:02:54] question, nobody I'd rather hear
[2:02:56] pray than believers in this
[2:03:00] message because they're praying with
[2:03:03] authority.
[2:03:05] No other meetings I'd rather go
[2:03:07] [Music]
[2:03:09] to than message
[2:03:13] meetings,
[2:03:14] despised,
[2:03:17] ridiculed, but at least they're
[2:03:18] reliable. Amen.
[2:03:21] You love him this morning. Won't you
[2:03:24] stand to your feet with us?
[2:03:28] Brother Bram said Jesus Christ is in the
[2:03:30] building
[2:03:31] tonight to perform miracles, but he does
[2:03:35] it through his church, his people. Mark
[2:03:38] 16. The commission's given to the
[2:03:40] church. That's what's the matter with
[2:03:42] the church today. It don't know its
[2:03:45] position. If you knowed positionally who
[2:03:48] you was and what you are tonight, there
[2:03:51] wouldn't be a feeble person in here in
[2:03:53] the next five minutes. The thing of it
[2:03:56] is you're looking off into a millennium
[2:03:58] for something to happen when it's
[2:03:59] already here. Now, somebody say now. We
[2:04:03] are the sons of God. Not we will be. We
[2:04:07] are right now. when this night, right
[2:04:11] now, this minute, we're seated together
[2:04:15] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Now,
[2:04:19] oh, if you would only recognize that,
[2:04:22] and the supreme authority, hallelujah,
[2:04:25] that Jesus Christ has given to every
[2:04:29] believer. You have need of something,
[2:04:32] you desire something, only thing you
[2:04:34] have to do is ask and receive it.
[2:04:39] receive it
[2:04:41] today. You're only as authoritative as
[2:04:44] you are under this
[2:04:46] message. The minute you get out from
[2:04:49] under the voice of the seventh angel is
[2:04:50] the minute you're
[2:04:52] presuming. But every believer under the
[2:04:54] voice of the seventh angel has been
[2:04:57] given supreme
[2:04:58] authority. Can I say this to you? I'm
[2:05:01] I'm I'm I'm looking at these and they're
[2:05:03] burning my heart up. Presume not little
[2:05:05] flock. Fear not, little flock, he said.
[2:05:08] Oh, if that great holy church only
[2:05:10] realized its power to do these things,
[2:05:12] but there's so much doubt and fear and
[2:05:14] trembling, wondering if it will, could
[2:05:15] it happen? As long as that exists, the
[2:05:19] church will never stand upright. But
[2:05:21] when every talk of fear is vanished and
[2:05:24] the Holy Spirit is in complete control
[2:05:27] of the church, then all fears are gone.
[2:05:30] And that church has the power. See,
[2:05:32] while they have everything that heaven
[2:05:34] owns behind them, they're ambassadors of
[2:05:36] the throne. Absolutely. An ambassador of
[2:05:38] Christ has the authority. And everything
[2:05:40] that Christ owns belongs to that
[2:05:43] ambassador. And he said, "Go you into
[2:05:45] all the world. You're my witnesses." And
[2:05:47] what is a witness? He's an ambassador.
[2:05:49] Is to come witness something. Are you
[2:05:51] ready for this, folks? The whole powers
[2:05:54] of heaven is right in your hands. Oh,
[2:05:58] why do we set and the church is barren?
[2:06:01] we set dormant is because we don't
[2:06:05] recognize these
[2:06:06] things. Folks, I think it's time to get
[2:06:09] back in the books and tapes like never
[2:06:11] before recognizing your position and
[2:06:15] tell them that devil,
[2:06:18] stop.
[2:06:19] Stop.
[2:06:21] Stop.
[2:06:23] Stop. Stop. No. Not Mr. Devil. Please
[2:06:28] stop.
[2:06:32] in your position, knowing who you are. I
[2:06:35] want you to bow your hearts with us this
[2:06:37] morning. Maybe you're here today like
[2:06:40] David. This church of the living God is
[2:06:42] like
[2:06:43] David. in between the
[2:06:46] Philistines, in between Saul, no nation
[2:06:49] to back him up, no denomination to
[2:06:52] support
[2:06:53] it, no no recognition of an
[2:06:58] organization. But that's okay. The
[2:07:01] anointing's already been poured on it.
[2:07:03] The anointing's already on your
[2:07:06] life. Maybe you're here today like
[2:07:08] David. You say, "Lord, quicken that
[2:07:11] revelation in my soul. I know who I am.
[2:07:15] Maybe you can look up and see that devil
[2:07:17] running straight at you. It's time
[2:07:19] today, folks. It's time to look at that
[2:07:22] devil and say,
[2:07:23] "Stop.
[2:07:25] Stop. You've come as far as you're going
[2:07:27] to
[2:07:28] come. This church is not controlled by a
[2:07:30] man. It's not led by a pope or a
[2:07:34] bishop. It's underneath the authority of
[2:07:36] the word of almighty God. We're
[2:07:39] underneath supreme authority. A prophet
[2:07:43] has taken his position as an angel
[2:07:46] messenger on the word and we now have
[2:07:48] clear
[2:07:50] direction. Hallelujah. Almighty God, we
[2:07:53] bow our hearts in your presence today.
[2:07:56] Lord, as my heart is just overflowing
[2:08:00] with the things your prophet has
[2:08:02] taught, Father, just riding down the
[2:08:04] road yesterday listening to why we are
[2:08:06] not a denomination and why I'm against
[2:08:09] organized religion just back to back,
[2:08:11] Lord. Father, I I I couldn't help I
[2:08:14] couldn't help but just cry out my soul
[2:08:16] and thank you, Lord, that we're not
[2:08:19] we're not recognized by the world.
[2:08:21] That's fine. We're not we're not
[2:08:24] approved of by religion. That's
[2:08:27] okay. We may be small and insignificant
[2:08:30] in the eyes of churches. That's
[2:08:33] fine. But Lord, the anointing's on us,
[2:08:36] Father. We have a we we have a
[2:08:39] vindicated word. Lord, Father, when we
[2:08:42] gather in the house of God, every
[2:08:43] message church that gathers around this
[2:08:45] message, whether there be five or 50 or
[2:08:49] 8 or 10 or 100 or 200 or 500, it don't
[2:08:53] matter, Lord, if the message of the hour
[2:08:55] is being preached, supreme authority is
[2:08:59] resting upon the lives of those
[2:09:01] believers. And devils hate the church of
[2:09:05] the living
[2:09:06] God. The devil hates this church. He
[2:09:09] hates this bride. He hates this people.
[2:09:11] But Lord, I pray for the times in which
[2:09:13] we live. I pray the anointing of God
[2:09:16] would be poured out like never before on
[2:09:18] every believer. Father, right here in
[2:09:20] this community, right here stands a
[2:09:23] faithful church, faith tabernacle. Lord,
[2:09:25] Father, the certainty of this church is
[2:09:29] the message of the hour. Lord, they're
[2:09:32] not ashamed of it. not ashamed to
[2:09:35] display the the beautiful things you've
[2:09:37] given us concerning it, Lord. Now,
[2:09:39] Father, I pray today, Lord, that we
[2:09:41] would never get to a place that we would
[2:09:43] allow the pressures of this modern age,
[2:09:47] of this modern world to cause us to
[2:09:49] start questioning who we are. Father,
[2:09:52] may we recognize when we start
[2:09:54] questioning, the devil starts moving.
[2:09:56] But when we stand in our position and
[2:09:59] say, "Satan, stop.
[2:10:01] You've gone as far as you can go. That
[2:10:04] devil's
[2:10:05] bound. Lord, we love you this morning.
[2:10:08] If there be one here today, God, that
[2:10:10] needs to look at that devil, may this be
[2:10:11] the moment they do it. They need to look
[2:10:14] at that devil and say,
[2:10:15] "Stop. Stop. You've gone as far as
[2:10:19] you're going to go. The word is against
[2:10:22] you. Give them the grace to do it this
[2:10:24] morning,
[2:10:25] Father. This is the real church, Lord.
[2:10:29] Father, that's why I don't have to be in
[2:10:31] a building or have to be in a a certain
[2:10:33] location. Lord, you could put this group
[2:10:35] of people under an oak tree somewhere.
[2:10:38] Father, we seen it during CO. Put us out
[2:10:40] in a field. We'll turn it into the house
[2:10:42] of God. This church is God word made
[2:10:46] flesh and redeemed flesh. And how we
[2:10:50] thank you for it in Jesus
[2:10:54] name. In Jesus name. Do you love him
[2:10:58] today? Amen. Sing it for us, brother.
[2:11:05] Testimony overr.
[2:11:08] Oh yes. I'm an overr. Hallelujah. By the
[2:11:12] blood of the lamb. How many can testify
[2:11:14] of that today? By the word of my
[2:11:18] testimony. Overcomer. Oh yes. I'm an

[2:11:50] I've never been the same. I can lift my
[2:11:54] hands and
[2:11:55] say, "Thank you for your
[2:11:59] grace.

[2:12:28] you? He rescued. He rescued you.
[2:12:32] Hallelujah. He delivered me. Maybe right
[2:12:34] here this morning, he's delivered you
[2:12:35] and set you free. Set me free. Maybe
[2:12:38] right now things are changing. Things
[2:12:40] have been changed. Hallelujah. I've
[2:12:43] never been
[2:12:44] ashamed. I can lift my hands and say,
[2:12:48] "Thank you for your grace. Overcome
[2:12:52] [Music]

[2:13:45] have here today? How many overcomers do
[2:13:48] we have here today? Overcomers by the
[2:13:51] blood of the lamb. By the blood and by
[2:13:53] the word of my
[2:13:56] testimony. Hallelujah. How many can say
[2:13:58] today Lord the word has come open. I can
[2:14:01] identify myself in that word. I can take
[2:14:04] my position today and I can say, "Devil,
[2:14:07] stop." In the name of Jesus, it's going
[2:14:10] to see a miracle. We're seeing miracles.

[2:14:16] in it. See, it's the it's the authority
[2:14:19] of the church of the living God. Listen,
