[43:44] Corinthians
[43:45] 13 and 8.
[43:48] just one verse
[43:50] and we'll turn to Second Peter 1 and 12.
[44:02] for we can do nothing against the truth
[44:05] but for the truth
[44:08] one more time
[44:09] we can do nothing against the truth
[44:12] but for the truth
[44:15] and in second Peter 1 and 12
[44:21] wherefore
[44:23] I will not be negligent but you always
[44:27] remembers of these things
[44:30] though you know them
[44:32] and be established
[44:35] present truth
[44:38] brother Brandon preached the message and
[44:40] absolute
[44:41] 1963.
[44:45] in his head lives
[44:48] now we when I was looking this text up
[44:52] I went to the dictionary
[44:54] I thought what
[44:57] somebody keeps saying that's absolute
[45:00] the truth
[45:02] absolutely this is it
[45:04] about what is that word
[45:07] what does it mean absolute
[45:09] I went to the dictionary to find out
[45:11] what it meant
[45:12] Webster says it is perfect in itself
[45:18] Unlimited in his power
[45:20] primarily an ultimate see
[45:24] a limited in his power perfect in
[45:27] himself
[45:28] and it really is an Ultima the word
[45:31] absolute
[45:33] in the day that we're living in now
[45:35] and everything is so breaking up
[45:38] so fragile and carried away
[45:40] I think that this message will be a very
[45:43] appropriate
[45:44] appropriate thing
[45:46] especially to Christians when they're
[45:49] going through their deep Waters now
[45:52] the Christian church is passing through
[45:54] the deepest water
[45:57] it's had for the last two thousand years
[46:01] because we're coming to a spot
[46:04] to where there is something presented to
[46:06] Christianity
[46:08] something they have to make a decision
[46:10] on
[46:11] I think that the Christian Church ought
[46:13] to have something that they know they
[46:16] are tied to
[46:18] instead of just floating about like a
[46:20] leaf up on the water the wind
[46:23] the Bible said cared about the devil
[46:26] went to the doctor
[46:27] the winds come and roll the little
[46:29] length this way
[46:30] and then another win Comes The North
[46:33] Wind the South
[46:34] wind East Wind
[46:36] the West when
[46:37] you never get anywhere
[46:40] you're not stable
[46:42] the Christian Life should be a stable to
[46:44] act
[46:45] it should be something
[46:47] that's a principle that you're a time to
[46:50] that is more than life itself
[46:53] amen you've received it
[46:55] foreign
[46:58] time
[47:04] we need to know where we stand
[47:07] and
[47:08] I know the things that I'm going to talk
[47:10] about this morning you've heard before
[47:13] but as Peter said though you know these
[47:16] things
[47:17] and be established
[47:19] I want to put you up your minds
[47:21] and we're going to remember this again
[47:24] you know you'll be establishing the
[47:25] present
[47:26] truth
[47:28] and Truth
[47:30] the word of God
[47:32] is ever present so is the truth it's not
[47:35] something that
[47:37] just slips upon us
[47:40] it's not something that slipped upon God
[47:43] but God is truth
[47:45] I was talking with Sean
[47:49] and just kind of rehearsing some things
[47:53] that I've experienced in my life
[47:56] and um
[47:57] he looked at him and said dad said you
[48:00] really need
[48:01] to write these things down
[48:04] I need to get them
[48:05] recorded
[48:07] and I told him as well
[48:09] what if I would just give a short
[48:11] testimony Sunday morning
[48:14] concerning these things
[48:17] it's not nothing to be wonderful
[48:19] so I'm going to speak
[48:21] of you on a few things that happened to
[48:23] me
[48:25] that prepared me for this message
[48:33] the Lord is certainly
[48:36] certainly been gracious
[48:38] to me and the fact
[48:43] when I look at how far we've come
[48:46] and the way we've come
[48:48] it's nothing more than God's Sovereign
[48:50] race
[48:53] but my story action begins when I was
[48:55] 15.
[48:56] I was going with my dad and my brother
[49:01] to a place in Oklahoma Miami Oklahoma
[49:05] my dad had bought a piano
[49:08] and so we were coming back
[49:11] from Miami
[49:12] and passing through a town called
[49:15] Claremore
[49:17] and I was in the front seat looking out
[49:19] the window to the West
[49:21] and suddenly
[49:25] I was impressed
[49:27] that I live in Claremore one day
[49:30] and I kind of shook myself and I thought
[49:33] what was that
[49:35] you live in Clermont one day
[49:38] and so about four years later three
[49:41] years later
[49:42] my wife and I married at 18 years old I
[49:44] was 15 when that impression come upon me
[49:49] three years later we married at 18.
[49:51] a month after we'd been married I told
[49:53] her
[49:54] I said listen let's move to living in
[49:58] Tulsa Oklahoma
[49:59] and she said move
[50:02] and she said where to
[50:05] and I thought a little bit I said
[50:06] Claremore let's move to Claremore
[50:09] and
[50:10] we moved to Claremore
[50:12] I was unaware at the time that I had
[50:15] was fulfilling that impression three
[50:18] years earlier
[50:19] because I forgot all about it
[50:22] and so moving to Claremore
[50:26] um the rest of our folks her dad and mom
[50:28] and
[50:29] family and my brother and his wife
[50:32] they all Fallen just to Claremore
[50:35] one day when I was 19
[50:39] my dad and father-in-law was
[50:42] Standing Outside they were talking
[50:45] and as they were talking one of them
[50:47] brought up the name of William Branham
[50:50] and uh
[50:52] I said who's William Branham
[50:56] and he said he's an advantage the mighty
[50:58] man of God
[50:59] properly used of the Lord
[51:01] and that's all that said it's all the
[51:03] reader news
[51:04] and so
[51:06] I didn't think anything more about it
[51:09] but about the same time
[51:12] I guess that's about 20.
[51:14] this
[51:17] we had a a church
[51:20] her father my her father my
[51:23] father-in-law
[51:24] pastored
[51:25] a small Church
[51:28] and it was an open assembly
[51:30] time Church
[51:32] where anybody that felt a legend saying
[51:35] a song or give a testimony or preach the
[51:38] message
[51:39] the pulpit was open
[51:41] and so
[51:43] one nine
[51:45] there was a man and his wife
[51:48] had come to church
[51:50] and she played the accordion they sang
[51:53] and so he wound up preaching
[51:57] and at the end of his message
[52:00] he looked out there at me and said Son
[52:04] he said God has showed me that you've
[52:07] been taught in the error
[52:09] and God's going to send you through the
[52:10] fire
[52:11] and going to purge you and bring you
[52:14] forth this pure gold
[52:16] and God is going to teach you
[52:18] and so of course that you can imagine
[52:22] how that went over
[52:24] and nothing was said during the service
[52:26] but after the service I got cornered
[52:29] and boy they
[52:31] climb to one side of me and down the
[52:33] other
[52:33] and some of the brothers
[52:36] and of course I didn't do any better
[52:38] and they said it was a false prophet
[52:41] and I I agree this yes sir
[52:45] and uh
[52:47] his own option to hand you know any
[52:49] better
[52:50] and so
[52:51] there was a young couple
[52:55] that that started attending church and
[52:58] and they
[52:59] about a year older than my wife and I
[53:02] and then one night they invited us over
[53:04] for supper
[53:06] so after the supper of the women were
[53:08] cleaning up the kitchen dining area
[53:11] and
[53:12] the man looked at me and said
[53:14] what do you know about the seven Church
[53:16] ages
[53:18] and I said nothing
[53:19] because once the seven Church ages
[53:22] and so
[53:24] he began to explain to me
[53:27] or little he knew and it was just a
[53:28] little now that I'm
[53:31] familiar with the church ages
[53:33] but nevertheless
[53:35] it was enough
[53:36] to get me curious
[53:38] and to make me hungry hungry
[53:41] and so anyway the
[53:45] Church folded up
[53:47] I wound up with my brother and his wife
[53:50] my wife
[53:51] going to church in Tulsa
[53:54] had brother Angelo's
[53:57] and so they had an open Pulpit to happen
[54:00] format
[54:02] and uh
[54:03] but while I was there
[54:05] I'm just so discontent
[54:08] so unhappy they were a good group of
[54:11] people
[54:12] had three people
[54:14] and they took me in and played guitar
[54:16] and
[54:17] just had a good time with him but I was
[54:20] dissatisfied
[54:21] and the Lord spoke to me
[54:24] fought in prayer he said go back
[54:27] Claremore I've got to work that you'll
[54:30] be a part of
[54:32] and so not knowing where to go I told my
[54:35] wife said we're going to go to church in
[54:37] Claremore
[54:38] and we looked around and found a little
[54:41] church called The Lighthouse
[54:43] of Ronaldo
[54:45] and we started Church there
[54:48] and of course they found out I played
[54:50] guitar and a little guitar playing
[54:52] and uh
[54:54] we
[54:55] played guitars sang and preached
[54:58] but
[55:00] they
[55:03] were not had a man a brother a black
[55:06] brother come and preach
[55:08] and he preached after the message
[55:12] he called my wife out and told her I
[55:15] said sister
[55:16] I see you working with young children
[55:19] teaching them
[55:21] well
[55:22] four years later
[55:24] had come to pass
[55:26] she taught kindergarten in first grade
[55:28] in a Christian School
[55:32] and so right after that
[55:35] he called me up
[55:37] and he said brother
[55:39] God has showed me
[55:41] that you've been taught in error
[55:44] and God's going to send you through the
[55:46] fire it's going to purge you and bring
[55:49] you forth as pure gold
[55:51] and God is going to teach you there's
[55:54] the second time that happened
[55:56] this time there was no one there to warn
[55:58] me
[55:59] or to chastise me
[56:01] and even if there were I wouldn't have
[56:03] received it
[56:04] because this is more the coincidence
[56:07] so we wound up leaving that church at
[56:11] church was an organization
[56:13] and they had brought a set of bylaws on
[56:16] a piece of paper eight and a half but
[56:18] seven and a half
[56:20] and asked me to read it and then sign it
[56:22] in order to have further participation
[56:25] in the services
[56:28] and so I read it
[56:29] things under I couldn't agree with
[56:32] and above all
[56:34] I couldn't agree that God would be
[56:36] confined to an eight and a half or
[56:37] eleven a half piece of paper
[56:40] he's bigger than that
[56:42] and so I left that church to know where
[56:45] it goes I drift again
[56:48] and my mother-in-law she said I know of
[56:50] a church
[56:52] I heard of a church across the tracks
[56:55] and let's go check that out
[56:58] so when we went over
[57:00] and I sat down the back row
[57:03] and looked up and there was a young man
[57:05] on the platform
[57:07] and immediately my heart was drawn to
[57:09] him
[57:10] and he got up and he walked back we
[57:12] introduced himself to each other his
[57:15] brother David Burris
[57:16] and he
[57:19] said you're a preacher I said yes sir
[57:22] he just wanted to preach tonight
[57:25] and so
[57:26] I preached to the guitar and I sang
[57:29] preached
[57:31] and I was there for almost 30 years
[57:35] but he had told me later on
[57:37] he said brother Durham
[57:40] he sighed we've been praying he was a
[57:43] young Christian about two years old
[57:45] Christian
[57:46] never Pastor never just preached one
[57:49] message really
[57:50] but it had a burden while living in
[57:53] Georgia it was converted
[57:55] to come back to Oklahoma
[57:57] and witnessed to his friends as House
[57:58] Church started
[58:00] and so he said but I I've been praying
[58:03] and I I thought I told the Lord I said
[58:06] Lord if you would send me a man
[58:08] that would stand with me and stand
[58:10] beside me
[58:11] he said I think I can do this
[58:13] he said you're that man and I feel the
[58:16] widows also
[58:18] but
[58:19] later
[58:21] about six months later he told me that
[58:24] I'm at my pastor
[58:26] from Atlanta Georgia from Stone Mountain
[58:28] Georgia
[58:29] to come and hold a Revival
[58:31] and so I happened to be there when
[58:34] brother Abernathy pulled up
[58:36] in front of the name of his home
[58:38] and the Lord spoke to me he said I've
[58:42] given this man something to tell you
[58:44] receive it
[58:46] and so that night in that service
[58:50] first thing he said I was mouth
[58:53] he said William Branham there was never
[58:56] a greater man walking shoe leather than
[58:59] William Branham and there's that name
[59:01] again
[59:02] and so after service that night I was so
[59:06] sure
[59:07] that God has spoke to him
[59:10] to me that I went to where he was saying
[59:14] and I said brother Abernathy
[59:16] I said that God has God shown you
[59:19] anything to tell me
[59:21] and says yes he has
[59:24] that's what is it he's not telling you
[59:26] for the survive is over
[59:29] but I don't feel to tell you now
[59:31] and so he snives on pins and he was with
[59:35] us be the night with this be the night
[59:36] five nights later the last night of the
[59:38] meeting
[59:39] he called me up he said brother Dern
[59:43] he said God showed me that you've been
[59:46] taught an error and gospel singing
[59:48] through the fire
[59:50] God's going to teach you or bring you
[59:52] forth the pure gold
[59:53] and God's going to teach you
[59:55] same thing
[59:57] three different times
[59:59] that time I can't explain it
[1:00:02] but my mind went blank
[1:00:05] everything that I had hung on to
[1:00:07] everything I had believed
[1:00:10] everything I thought to be the truth
[1:00:12] was gone
[1:00:13] my mind was a total blank I could I
[1:00:16] couldn't tell you scriptures to quote
[1:00:18] I couldn't do anything
[1:00:20] and it is bewildering and so it was a
[1:00:24] journey for me
[1:00:25] the beginning of a journey
[1:00:27] in which God taught me
[1:00:30] the very first thing that he taught me
[1:00:33] was is that God is his own interpreter
[1:00:36] that he doesn't need man to interpret
[1:00:38] for him
[1:00:40] God is his own interpreter
[1:00:42] and
[1:00:44] we had been taught
[1:00:46] that one of the things that I've been
[1:00:49] taught
[1:00:49] was that Israel
[1:00:51] God had for cast the Israel off giving
[1:00:54] her a bill of divorce
[1:00:56] I would never deal with her as a nation
[1:00:58] again
[1:00:59] and so
[1:01:01] I had believed that right along I was
[1:01:04] taught that
[1:01:05] but in 1974 when the Yom Kippur War
[1:01:09] broke out
[1:01:11] and he caught my attention it was got my
[1:01:13] attention
[1:01:14] and I began to thank him
[1:01:16] about that about the war that won
[1:01:20] and I thought that can't be but the Lord
[1:01:22] spoke to me
[1:01:24] said I asked your advice
[1:01:27] harassed your counsel
[1:01:30] have asked you how to do things
[1:01:33] not to do things
[1:01:35] and if you stop it at my tracks
[1:01:38] and I just talked to the Lord I said no
[1:01:40] I said you have it
[1:01:43] he's not my own counselor
[1:01:46] he said I root of the kingdom of man
[1:01:48] turned the hearts of the Kings has
[1:01:50] Rivers
[1:01:52] and so they begin
[1:01:55] to change my way of thinking
[1:01:57] so I began to realize
[1:02:00] that all I had to do was set back
[1:02:03] and watch God's word unfold
[1:02:08] so Brother David
[1:02:10] called me one even if I'm going to Prior
[1:02:12] Oklahoma to visit his brother Everett
[1:02:14] Thornton
[1:02:15] would you not with me
[1:02:17] and so I went with him
[1:02:19] after Services over Brother David
[1:02:21] brother Thornton were visiting and I
[1:02:23] glanced around and looked there's two
[1:02:25] books on the table
[1:02:27] and as brother Torres one of those books
[1:02:30] there
[1:02:31] and he said there's the book two books
[1:02:34] the seven Church ages
[1:02:36] and the seals
[1:02:37] and he said
[1:02:39] the Revelation given to God's Prophet
[1:02:42] William Brad him
[1:02:44] and that's he would like to have him I
[1:02:47] said yes
[1:02:48] so I took the books
[1:02:51] and he also gave us four real real tapes
[1:02:54] it's important we had possessed folks
[1:02:57] Mercedes
[1:02:59] real real tapes
[1:03:01] he was four of them I took one of them
[1:03:05] uh emergency divorce
[1:03:08] and I took that got my little pentaton
[1:03:10] the quarter out and strung her up
[1:03:13] listen to it
[1:03:15] shook my ass is my style stuff
[1:03:19] turn it off put the tape up
[1:03:22] a couple days later I was thinking you
[1:03:25] know that man sure sounded
[1:03:27] sincere and humble
[1:03:30] I thought now let's do it some more
[1:03:33] it took me two weeks to get that message
[1:03:36] but at the end of two weeks I said hey
[1:03:38] man's every word
[1:03:43] choosing law for Grace
[1:03:46] and listen to that
[1:03:47] and that message so moved me we had a
[1:03:51] little lateral broadcast at the time
[1:03:53] and so I preached on that message
[1:03:57] if he was knew me saw me on the street
[1:04:00] that message
[1:04:02] it sounds really powerful
[1:04:04] and that's William Bradham
[1:04:08] oh
[1:04:09] and so I've listed all four tapes
[1:04:12] and that was all we had for for many
[1:04:15] years just in four tapes
[1:04:18] but
[1:04:20] that is the way
[1:04:22] part of the testimony that I come in to
[1:04:26] this message
[1:04:27] it would be 10 years later that I got
[1:04:29] the book
[1:04:30] a man sent from God
[1:04:33] by Gordon Lindsay
[1:04:34] when I read that book I just
[1:04:38] cried and I cried to cry
[1:04:42] I thought I've never seen anything like
[1:04:43] this
[1:04:45] and uh
[1:04:48] in earlier teenage years I had
[1:04:52] listen to the man the name of Kenneth
[1:04:55] Hagin
[1:04:56] and Kenneth Hagin was really quite a
[1:04:58] teacher on faith
[1:05:00] and uh I used to attend his service
[1:05:03] every time I was in Tulsa
[1:05:05] and so I heard brother Bradham
[1:05:08] has got
[1:05:10] a red red medicine from God
[1:05:13] and
[1:05:14] the rest listen to some other things
[1:05:18] and I realized
[1:05:20] here's where everybody's getting their
[1:05:21] messages
[1:05:23] why should I
[1:05:25] listen to them I get it straight from
[1:05:27] the author
[1:05:29] and so
[1:05:30] that's what changed my life in my heart
[1:05:35] now
[1:05:37] we come into this message
[1:05:40] and as I said
[1:05:42] it's just nothing but sorry God
[1:05:44] Sovereign Grace
[1:05:46] that led us to what he letters
[1:05:49] and it caused the Great
[1:05:51] separation between my brother
[1:05:54] and his wife my wife
[1:05:57] we
[1:05:59] had been very close
[1:06:02] we had
[1:06:04] my brother and I married sisters
[1:06:06] we had a double wedding
[1:06:09] we took our hormones together
[1:06:11] we went to church together
[1:06:14] he wouldn't answer the woman without the
[1:06:15] other
[1:06:17] but
[1:06:18] I come into this message begin to see
[1:06:21] things differently
[1:06:23] although I I was in full pleasure of the
[1:06:26] message yet but I I knew there was more
[1:06:30] than what we've been taught
[1:06:33] and
[1:06:34] it caused a rift between us
[1:06:38] a big ribs
[1:06:40] and there's something we couldn't help I
[1:06:42] couldn't help
[1:06:44] and I tried to explain to him where I
[1:06:46] was going
[1:06:47] they didn't understand that
[1:06:49] and they stated where they're at but
[1:06:54] I want to pick up this message now
[1:07:01] I mean
[1:07:05] I want to quote brother Branham in the
[1:07:08] absolute again
[1:07:09] that was a little bit of a laugh story
[1:07:12] My Testimony
[1:07:14] there's a lot more but I want to give
[1:07:16] you this message
[1:07:17] but that that's enough time
[1:07:20] if we understand
[1:07:22] three different times
[1:07:23] men prophesied over me
[1:07:25] a word for word none of them know each
[1:07:28] other
[1:07:30] here's God speaking directly to me
[1:07:32] at this from an evening
[1:07:36] so brother rather than again the
[1:07:37] absolute definition
[1:07:39] he said it's perfect it is perfect in
[1:07:42] itself
[1:07:43] are named it in his power
[1:07:45] primarily in Ultimate
[1:07:48] it's Unlimited in his power
[1:07:51] perfect in itself
[1:07:53] and it really is an absolute penultimate
[1:07:56] now in Psalms 119 and 89
[1:07:59] and 90.
[1:08:01] the psalmist wrote saying forever O Lord
[1:08:04] Thy word is settled in heaven
[1:08:08] and thy faith faithfulness is unto all
[1:08:11] generations God has established the
[1:08:14] Earth and anybody
[1:08:16] forever O Lord Is Thy word settled in
[1:08:19] heaven
[1:08:20] and I can remember a time uh you know by
[1:08:23] Nature I'm kind of Miller caller caller
[1:08:27] and then have it used to be up and down
[1:08:30] up and down up and down and that spilled
[1:08:33] over my spiritual life
[1:08:35] one man God loved me the next minute God
[1:08:37] didn't love me one way I was called to
[1:08:39] preach next minute wasn't called to
[1:08:40] preach and just everywhere
[1:08:43] and one day God spoke to me
[1:08:45] said forever
[1:08:48] because my word settled in heaven
[1:08:51] said the problem is not my word the
[1:08:54] problem is with you
[1:08:56] you've got to get it settled in your
[1:08:59] heart
[1:09:00] it's not my word but the fault is you
[1:09:04] and so I I thought about that I thought
[1:09:06] you know that's right
[1:09:08] and so
[1:09:09] I begin to wean myself from feelings
[1:09:13] and based my walks strictly upon God's
[1:09:16] word
[1:09:17] for Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:09:20] by the word
[1:09:21] so I
[1:09:23] I took that as my absolute My ultimate
[1:09:26] and from then on my life just plained
[1:09:29] out
[1:09:30] I settled down
[1:09:32] I was nothing down up and down all
[1:09:34] around I'm just
[1:09:38] set it out
[1:09:40] but
[1:09:42] I was thinking
[1:09:44] that if God's word is forever settled in
[1:09:47] heaven
[1:09:49] then he's got to get that word here on
[1:09:53] Earth
[1:09:53] among the people
[1:09:55] because it's not going to do no good for
[1:09:57] me it's heaven in heaven
[1:09:59] if he can't get it
[1:10:01] down here
[1:10:04] so Psalms or Isaiah 55
[1:10:08] verses 7 to 11.
[1:10:10] so let the wicked forsake his way in the
[1:10:12] unrighteous man his thoughts
[1:10:17] and let him return unto the Lord
[1:10:19] and he will have mercy upon him and to
[1:10:22] our God for he will abundantly pardon
[1:10:26] for my thoughts or not your thoughts
[1:10:30] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[1:10:33] Lord
[1:10:34] because the heavens are higher than the
[1:10:36] Earth
[1:10:37] is higher than your ways and my thoughts
[1:10:41] and your thoughts
[1:10:42] for as the rain coming down and the snow
[1:10:45] from heaven and returneth not through
[1:10:48] there but water of the Earth and make it
[1:10:50] bring forth and Bud
[1:10:52] that it may give seed to the sore and
[1:10:54] bread to the eater
[1:10:55] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:10:58] of my mouth
[1:10:59] it should not return unto me void
[1:11:01] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:11:04] please
[1:11:05] and you shall prosper in the thing we're
[1:11:07] too I sent it
[1:11:10] now
[1:11:12] I'm going to take this the remainder of
[1:11:14] this message
[1:11:15] and explain why
[1:11:18] that I believe God sent a prophet
[1:11:21] by the name of William Branham
[1:11:23] I would ask you to go on record
[1:11:25] did I believe this message is one
[1:11:27] thousand percent
[1:11:29] there's no cutting Corners with it
[1:11:31] there's no evidence and buts I believe
[1:11:34] this message to be divinely inspired of
[1:11:37] the Lord and I'm going to explain why
[1:11:41] now God had thoughts and he had ways
[1:11:45] we just read in the scripture they were
[1:11:48] far above us they were in the heavens
[1:11:51] so God had to have a way
[1:11:53] to convey his thoughts
[1:11:55] and make known as ways here on the Earth
[1:11:59] now you can't see God I've explained
[1:12:01] this before but God is a spirit they
[1:12:04] worship he must worship Him in spirit
[1:12:07] and in truth
[1:12:10] but you can't see God
[1:12:13] so God in order to communicate with man
[1:12:16] in order to make his ways known as the
[1:12:18] man and his thoughts in order to man
[1:12:21] he ordained men called Prophets
[1:12:23] they called also called Sears the reason
[1:12:27] we're called Sears is because the spirit
[1:12:30] of God would Elevate them up
[1:12:33] above
[1:12:35] Humanity
[1:12:37] would anoint them
[1:12:39] and show them things that
[1:12:41] no one knew
[1:12:43] I think they were to come
[1:12:45] and sort of created a hardship
[1:12:47] because
[1:12:48] men brother one time said that the
[1:12:51] hardest thing that God ever had to do
[1:12:53] was to get one mortal to believe another
[1:12:57] and I think this is so among preachers
[1:12:59] because preachers are are really quite
[1:13:02] jealous I'm going to be honest they're
[1:13:04] jealous
[1:13:06] on their territory they don't want
[1:13:09] anybody infringing on their Glory
[1:13:11] we're called
[1:13:13] you're called that's good but I'm called
[1:13:15] too
[1:13:18] and so they they lack the respect they
[1:13:21] lack the reverence they lack all of
[1:13:23] these things
[1:13:25] and this is what separated brother
[1:13:27] Branham
[1:13:28] brother Branham was not seeking his own
[1:13:31] Glory
[1:13:33] brother Bradham was the humble man
[1:13:35] brother Madam depended solely upon the
[1:13:38] leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:41] he was sat there having this gift of
[1:13:44] healing and discernment but he was
[1:13:47] standing there and say you're probably
[1:13:49] wondering why I'm standing here
[1:13:52] he's I'm waiting on him
[1:13:54] brother Brandon would not venture
[1:13:58] force that authority to preach the
[1:14:00] message presuming
[1:14:01] he would not mention four without
[1:14:03] Authority but he would wait upon the
[1:14:06] Lord
[1:14:07] then he would say he's here every time I
[1:14:10] hear him saying that
[1:14:11] you've seen his shoes done my spine
[1:14:14] because you know that it's not a man no
[1:14:18] more it's God can you say Amen
[1:14:22] working through a man
[1:14:24] and he would sit there and say brother
[1:14:26] or sister so and so and so and so and so
[1:14:30] and so he would look out at the crowds
[1:14:32] and say sin brother so and so call him a
[1:14:36] name read him off like a book
[1:14:39] man couldn't do that
[1:14:41] and so these Prophets
[1:14:45] were the same way
[1:14:48] brother Branham said in God keeps his
[1:14:50] word
[1:14:51] he said God always always from Genesis
[1:14:54] to revelation
[1:14:56] God has always had at least one man that
[1:15:00] he can put his hand on he's never been
[1:15:03] without a witness
[1:15:05] now
[1:15:06] God had to have a mouth please so he
[1:15:09] chose man he ordained them to be
[1:15:11] prophets to be seers and Amos 3 verses 7
[1:15:15] and 8 the scripture says surely the Lord
[1:15:19] God will do nothing but he reveated his
[1:15:22] secret unto his servants the prophets
[1:15:26] God would do nothing except he revealed
[1:15:29] his Secrets first reveal the secrets
[1:15:32] unto his servants and Prophets
[1:15:34] the lion at the roared who will not fear
[1:15:38] the Lord God the Lord God hath spoken
[1:15:41] who can but prophesied
[1:15:44] now in second Peter 1 verses 20 and 21
[1:15:49] Peter said knowing this first
[1:15:52] that no Prophecy of the scripture is of
[1:15:55] any private interpretation
[1:15:57] for prophecy came knocked in Old Time by
[1:16:00] the will of man but holy men of God
[1:16:03] spank as they were moved by the Holy
[1:16:06] Ghost
[1:16:07] now you've got to put first things first
[1:16:10] before you can have confidence and
[1:16:12] submit yourself to God's word
[1:16:14] you first got to acknowledge his author
[1:16:17] in acknowledging then you must also
[1:16:20] agree that he and he alone is Sovereign
[1:16:24] in his interpretation
[1:16:27] brother Brandon preached the message the
[1:16:29] testimony of a true Witness
[1:16:31] he said this what struck those Prophets
[1:16:35] what inspired them that perfect accuracy
[1:16:38] not only that but the prophets told what
[1:16:42] he would do the prophecyman saw him born
[1:16:45] where he'd be born how he'd be born not
[1:16:49] an ordinary baby just a baby born to
[1:16:51] some woman is said he would be born in a
[1:16:54] mysterious way
[1:16:56] he would be born of a virgin a virgin
[1:16:59] shall conceive
[1:17:00] what would strike a mortal man to make
[1:17:04] him see that hundreds of years before it
[1:17:07] happened
[1:17:08] perfectly accurate exactly on the line
[1:17:11] talk about testimony of a supreme
[1:17:14] Supreme Being a living God
[1:17:18] not only that but told where to be born
[1:17:21] how he would be born told what the world
[1:17:23] would say about him told the various
[1:17:25] signs and things that would follow him
[1:17:28] to prove he was a messiah
[1:17:30] proved that he'd be rejected and even in
[1:17:33] the spirit grown his words
[1:17:35] from the cross hundreds of years before
[1:17:37] he before he was born
[1:17:42] now brother random said prophets were
[1:17:43] born
[1:17:44] a messenger for the age who God by
[1:17:47] foreknowledge knows the age and has his
[1:17:51] agent there to call out sin
[1:17:56] one of my favorite scriptures
[1:17:58] and I know I'm I'm reading some things
[1:18:00] that I've read here before but I've just
[1:18:03] got to read it again
[1:18:05] but in Jeremiah Verses 4 through 10
[1:18:09] then and I want y'all to really notice
[1:18:12] these scriptures
[1:18:14] then the word of the Lord
[1:18:17] came
[1:18:18] unto me
[1:18:21] now can you imagine
[1:18:23] standing there before a group of people
[1:18:26] and saying the word of the Lord
[1:18:29] came unto me
[1:18:33] that's going to raise Flags
[1:18:34] automatically in people's minds
[1:18:37] who are you
[1:18:42] that's going to be the response who are
[1:18:44] you
[1:18:45] what do you mean the word of the Lord
[1:18:46] came unto you
[1:18:50] gets worse
[1:18:54] and before that came his forth out of
[1:18:57] the womb I Sanctified thee
[1:19:00] I ordained thee a prophet unto the
[1:19:04] Nations
[1:19:05] then said I oh Lord God behold I cannot
[1:19:09] speak for I Am a Child
[1:19:11] but the Lord said unto me say not I am a
[1:19:14] child for Thou shalt go to all that I
[1:19:18] shall send thee and whatsoever I command
[1:19:21] thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of
[1:19:24] their faces for I am with thee to to
[1:19:27] deliver thee saith the Lord
[1:19:30] then the Lord put forth his hand and
[1:19:33] touched my mouth and the Lord said unto
[1:19:36] me behold I have put my words in thy
[1:19:40] mouth
[1:19:41] I have set thee over the Nations over
[1:19:44] the kingdoms to root out to pull down to
[1:19:48] destroy to throw down to build and to
[1:19:52] plant
[1:19:54] no wonder the prophets were slain
[1:19:58] that's why they treated the prophets
[1:20:01] they stoned them they saw them asunder
[1:20:04] because they stood with boldness
[1:20:06] and said the word of the Lord came to me
[1:20:12] now
[1:20:14] when God sent them Prophets
[1:20:17] they had the word of the Lord
[1:20:19] God always sent a prophet
[1:20:22] when things were starting to deteriorate
[1:20:27] the spirituality of the nation
[1:20:30] they were getting into idolatry such as
[1:20:33] Ahab American Jezebel
[1:20:35] and Marion
[1:20:37] the spiritual with the natural
[1:20:39] of political marriage
[1:20:42] doing all of this and
[1:20:45] started going to idolatry God raised up
[1:20:48] a Prophet by the name of Elijah we know
[1:20:50] the story
[1:20:52] and so
[1:20:53] God always had a prophet on hand
[1:20:58] to pronounce God's blessings
[1:21:01] upon Israel
[1:21:05] he also had a prophet on hand the same
[1:21:07] prophet
[1:21:09] Amen to rebuke Israel
[1:21:13] so that Prophet was important Israel
[1:21:17] but again
[1:21:18] that could not receive the prophets
[1:21:22] so here's what Amy said in the name is
[1:21:24] eight eight eleven through twelve
[1:21:27] behold the days come
[1:21:29] saith the Lord God that I will send a
[1:21:32] famine in the land not a famine of bread
[1:21:35] nor thirst for water
[1:21:37] but of hearing the words of the Lord
[1:21:39] and they shall Wander from sea to Sea
[1:21:43] and from the north even to the east they
[1:21:46] shall run to and fro to seek the word of
[1:21:49] the Lord and shall not
[1:21:51] find it how come because they had killed
[1:21:55] off the prophets
[1:21:57] and that's the way the word of the Lord
[1:21:59] come the Lord God knew nothing except he
[1:22:02] personally been a Secrets unto servants
[1:22:04] the prophets
[1:22:05] so the secrets were God's thoughts and
[1:22:08] his ways above us being brought down to
[1:22:11] man
[1:22:12] and God and people rejected the prophet
[1:22:14] the voice of the Lord that God ordained
[1:22:18] and anoint rejected him
[1:22:21] and so as a result of that there was a
[1:22:23] famine for the hearing of the word
[1:22:26] the reason why there was orange to speak
[1:22:29] it was gone
[1:22:31] they killed them all Malachi was the
[1:22:33] last prophet
[1:22:37] and so you're going to wonder from CDC
[1:22:39] you're going to go from the north to the
[1:22:41] West the East you're going to want to
[1:22:43] look everywhere
[1:22:45] and not be able to find the word of the
[1:22:46] Lord
[1:22:47] you're in trouble
[1:22:50] so 400 years passed
[1:22:53] from Malachi
[1:22:55] unto John the Baptist
[1:22:58] there was no word
[1:23:01] so man was left up to his own devices
[1:23:05] his own thoughts his own way and what a
[1:23:09] mess that man made out of it
[1:23:12] interpreting
[1:23:14] the word
[1:23:15] applying his own interpretation to it
[1:23:19] may have done that
[1:23:22] totally messed up
[1:23:28] the scripture said in Isaiah 59 14.
[1:23:31] and judgment is turned away backwards
[1:23:35] and Justice standeth the far off
[1:23:38] for truth is fallen in the street
[1:23:43] and Equity cannot enter
[1:23:45] now starting the scripture was you can
[1:23:47] do nothing against the truth but only
[1:23:50] for the truth
[1:23:52] and so here truth is fallen in the
[1:23:56] streets
[1:23:57] what's happened man casted away from him
[1:24:01] kill the prophets shut off the
[1:24:03] mouthpiece
[1:24:04] and so there's no more truth and lay
[1:24:07] dormant is falling in the streets
[1:24:10] the problems have been slain to whom the
[1:24:12] word of the Lord came true came true
[1:24:14] truth is now fallen in the streets it
[1:24:17] would be 400 years before a prophet
[1:24:19] would come on the scene
[1:24:21] they sought for the word of the Lord but
[1:24:23] could not find it for The Messengers to
[1:24:25] whom the word of the Lord came they
[1:24:27] silent beneath the sod
[1:24:29] but they could do nothing against the
[1:24:31] truth
[1:24:32] only for it for what drives again in his
[1:24:34] season
[1:24:36] Isaiah 40 verses 3 and 5.
[1:24:39] the voice of him that crieth in the
[1:24:41] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:24:43] Lord
[1:24:44] make straight in the desert a highway
[1:24:46] for our God
[1:24:48] every Valley should be exalted Every
[1:24:51] Mountain and huge shall be made low and
[1:24:53] the Crooked should be made straight and
[1:24:55] the rough place is plain
[1:24:57] and the glory of the Lord shall be
[1:24:59] revealed listen to this and the glory of
[1:25:01] the Lord shall be revealed
[1:25:03] and All Flesh you'll see it now they may
[1:25:06] see it
[1:25:07] but not all flesh is going to accept it
[1:25:12] All Flesh you see it together
[1:25:14] for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it
[1:25:19] is identifying himself as the mouth of
[1:25:24] the Lord
[1:25:25] has spoken it Malachi 3 and 1.
[1:25:29] behold I will send my messenger he shall
[1:25:32] prepare the way before me
[1:25:33] and the Lord whom he seeks should
[1:25:35] suddenly come to this Temple even the
[1:25:38] messenger of the Covenant whom he
[1:25:40] Delight in behold he shall come saith
[1:25:42] the Lord
[1:25:43] Malachi Verses 4 verse chapter verse
[1:25:47] chapter 4 verse 5-6 behold I will send
[1:25:51] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[1:25:53] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:25:55] Lord
[1:25:55] and he should turn the heart of the
[1:25:57] fathers to the children
[1:25:58] and there are the children of the
[1:26:00] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[1:26:02] with a curse
[1:26:04] now the great and Dreadful day we all
[1:26:06] know that there's two days mentioned
[1:26:08] there
[1:26:09] the great day was before the first
[1:26:11] coming of Christ as the great day the
[1:26:14] Dreadful day before the Great
[1:26:15] Tribulation
[1:26:17] Luke 1 and 17
[1:26:20] said he should go before him in his
[1:26:21] spirit and power of Elias to turn the
[1:26:24] hearts of the father to the children
[1:26:26] so you can't do nothing against the
[1:26:28] truth only for the truth
[1:26:31] so here's John the Baptist now
[1:26:34] in the distance he should turn the going
[1:26:36] before him in the spirit and power power
[1:26:39] of Elias to turn the hearts of the
[1:26:41] father to the children
[1:26:43] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:26:45] just to make ready people prepared for
[1:26:47] the Lord
[1:26:48] Mark 1 verses 1-4
[1:26:51] the beginning of the Gospel Jesus Christ
[1:26:53] the son of God
[1:26:55] as it is written in the as it is written
[1:26:57] in the prophets behold I send my
[1:27:01] messenger before thy face which shall
[1:27:05] prepare thy way before thee divorce the
[1:27:09] one crying in the wilderness prepare you
[1:27:11] the way of the Lord make his path
[1:27:14] straight
[1:27:15] now
[1:27:17] I want to look at this preparation
[1:27:18] because after all it had been 400 years
[1:27:22] since the prophet
[1:27:25] as I said earlier that they had got
[1:27:28] everything all twisted up
[1:27:31] it's all messed up
[1:27:33] to throw an interpretation
[1:27:35] their own thoughts
[1:27:37] you know when I think about that this is
[1:27:40] why in The Book of Revelation
[1:27:42] he said If any man take anything or add
[1:27:45] anything to this book
[1:27:49] any word
[1:27:53] so John the Baptist was
[1:27:56] the word originally came to the prophet
[1:27:58] whom God ordained to be his mouthpiece
[1:28:01] therefore would take a prophet
[1:28:03] to give the proper interpretation
[1:28:07] thereby place and placing it as present
[1:28:11] day truth
[1:28:15] can you say Amen
[1:28:18] John the Baptist was that Prophet sent
[1:28:20] to prepare the way of the messenger of
[1:28:22] the Covenants
[1:28:24] it was a son of man
[1:28:27] it was a son of man
[1:28:31] revealing the son of man
[1:28:36] just like we're seeing in our day right
[1:28:38] here
[1:28:39] fulfilling
[1:28:41] Luke 17 and 30.
[1:28:43] when the in the day when the son of man
[1:28:45] is revealed
[1:28:47] it was a son of man brother Bradham
[1:28:50] revealing these son of man Christ the
[1:28:54] word
[1:28:56] you remember that's what John was
[1:28:57] revealing the word was made flesh
[1:29:02] so it was John the Baptist a son of man
[1:29:05] revealing these son of man while John
[1:29:09] the Baptist done
[1:29:10] and she took all them loose sins all
[1:29:13] them prophecies
[1:29:15] and brought him right on down amen
[1:29:17] resurrected him out of the street
[1:29:20] say here's the truth
[1:29:24] here's the proper interpretation
[1:29:26] repent
[1:29:28] bring forth made
[1:29:31] me approved meat for repentance can you
[1:29:34] say man
[1:29:36] repent
[1:29:38] see
[1:29:39] and so
[1:29:41] John said
[1:29:44] there's one among you whom ye know not
[1:29:48] now I love this in John 1 22-27
[1:29:54] then said they unto him who aren't thou
[1:29:56] that we may give an answer to them that
[1:29:59] sent us what says Thou of thyself
[1:30:02] he said I am the voice
[1:30:06] of one crying in the wilderness
[1:30:08] make straight to where the Lord has said
[1:30:11] the prophet Isaiah
[1:30:14] and they which were sent were the
[1:30:16] Pharisees
[1:30:17] and they asked him and said unto him why
[1:30:20] baptizes thou then if thou be not that
[1:30:23] Christ nor Elias nor that Prophet John
[1:30:27] answered them saying I baptized with
[1:30:30] water but their standeth one among you
[1:30:35] who mean or not
[1:30:37] here it is he it is Who coming after me
[1:30:40] is preferred before me whose shoe
[1:30:43] latches I am not worthy to lose
[1:30:45] these things were done in myths
[1:30:48] bethabara
[1:30:50] behind Jordan where John was baptizing
[1:30:53] the next day John would see if Jesus
[1:30:56] coming unto him and saith Behold the
[1:31:00] Lamb of God was taken away the sin of
[1:31:03] the world
[1:31:05] this is he whom I said after me cometh a
[1:31:09] man which is referred before me for he
[1:31:12] was before me and I knew him not and I
[1:31:15] noticed what John said here
[1:31:18] I'm just like the rest of you
[1:31:20] I knew him not
[1:31:22] but there's one thing that was revealed
[1:31:24] unto me
[1:31:26] that when I see this the spirit of the
[1:31:28] Lord
[1:31:29] descending on him in the form of a dove
[1:31:31] that would be the one
[1:31:34] now no one else had that revelation
[1:31:37] God never told anyone else
[1:31:40] describes the Pharisees everybody
[1:31:41] standing there questioning John
[1:31:44] he never told him anything
[1:31:46] but it was revealed unto John divorce
[1:31:50] one crying in the wilderness a prophet
[1:31:52] can you say Amen that was the only way
[1:31:56] that they could identify who Christ was
[1:32:00] he says Christ is in your midst and you
[1:32:03] know I'm not I don't either
[1:32:08] but it's been revealed unto me
[1:32:12] I knew him not but that he should be
[1:32:15] made manifest to Israel
[1:32:17] therefore him I come baptize them with
[1:32:19] water
[1:32:20] and John bear records saying I saw the
[1:32:24] Spirit
[1:32:25] descended from heaven like a dove
[1:32:27] and did Abode upon him and I knew him
[1:32:30] not but
[1:32:32] that he sent me to baptize the water the
[1:32:35] same said unto me
[1:32:37] upon whom thou shall see the spirit
[1:32:40] descending and remaining on him
[1:32:44] the same is he was baptized with the
[1:32:47] Holy Ghost
[1:32:48] and I saw
[1:32:50] and bear record that this is the son of
[1:32:56] God
[1:32:57] amen amen now not what I'm saying that
[1:33:01] dove
[1:33:02] on a Job saying the spirit of the Lord
[1:33:04] descendants
[1:33:06] the others had no choice
[1:33:09] but to believe what John said
[1:33:11] but did they believe it they did not
[1:33:13] believe it
[1:33:15] why because truth you can do nothing
[1:33:18] against the truth only for the truth
[1:33:21] Isaiah prophesizing you got ears but you
[1:33:24] can't hear them eyes but you can't see
[1:33:27] can you say Amen
[1:33:29] you can do nothing against the truth
[1:33:32] if they said that wasn't the Christ
[1:33:34] which they they come against Christ
[1:33:37] that didn't make no difference
[1:33:39] he was still Christ
[1:33:43] if they rejected John the Baptist then
[1:33:45] there and make a difference he was still
[1:33:47] divorce the one crying in the wilderness
[1:33:51] so I had the reason I'm saying these
[1:33:53] things is you and I testifying
[1:33:57] that we believe
[1:33:59] in William Bradham to be the messenger
[1:34:02] for this age
[1:34:04] with all the world denying it the church
[1:34:07] coming against it
[1:34:10] does it make any difference
[1:34:12] no
[1:34:14] you can do nothing against the truth
[1:34:15] only for the truth
[1:34:18] [Applause]
[1:34:21] seen I don't know 100 years ago when I
[1:34:24] was a kid just a new convert
[1:34:27] I I would witness everybody just
[1:34:29] witnessed witness witness love to
[1:34:31] witness love to talk to people about the
[1:34:33] Lord
[1:34:34] I got into his hornet's nest
[1:34:37] I mean I come across men that were
[1:34:39] intellectuals that were smart they were
[1:34:41] brilliant they were intelligent they'd
[1:34:43] take this Bible and turn their voy but
[1:34:45] Loose me with it
[1:34:49] leave me rattled
[1:34:51] Northern thing I had to come back to
[1:34:54] is what I had personally experienced
[1:34:58] I may not be a scholar I may not
[1:35:00] understand every word
[1:35:02] but I understood this one thing
[1:35:04] whereas once I was lost and I'm found
[1:35:07] once I was blind but now I see
[1:35:11] if God is dead who's just living in my
[1:35:13] heart
[1:35:14] can you say I knew that
[1:35:17] and I stayed with that
[1:35:19] then do whatever they want to do it's
[1:35:21] like I heard one time you know I was
[1:35:24] pretty good on guitar
[1:35:27] kind of trying to keep up with me and he
[1:35:30] said
[1:35:31] he said you know somebody asked me one
[1:35:34] time said how come you don't run all
[1:35:36] over that neck like Chet Atkins
[1:35:39] he's because I already found what he's
[1:35:40] looking for
[1:35:45] and that's what
[1:35:47] agnostics you go ahead and run
[1:35:49] on to
[1:35:50] go through the south Florida the bushes
[1:35:52] the bars and everything
[1:35:53] I'm standing right here farming in this
[1:35:57] cast or what I know to be the truth
[1:36:05] I bear record that this is the Son of
[1:36:07] God in John 3 29
[1:36:10] and I I really want you to catch this
[1:36:13] John said
[1:36:15] he that hath the bride
[1:36:18] is the bridegroom
[1:36:21] but the friend of the bridegroom would
[1:36:24] stand up and heareth him rejoiceth
[1:36:27] greatly because of the Bride groom's
[1:36:30] voice
[1:36:32] this my joy therefore is fulfilled
[1:36:37] now I'm gonna bring in this scripture
[1:36:38] real quick in Psalms
[1:36:40] 19 verses 5 and 6.
[1:36:44] which is as a bridegroom coming out of
[1:36:48] his chamber and rejoices as a strong man
[1:36:52] to run a race
[1:36:55] have taught the scripture before
[1:36:58] what a wonderful scripture so here's the
[1:37:00] bridegroom
[1:37:02] fulfilling this prophecy
[1:37:05] the feeling of Truth come out of his
[1:37:07] chamber
[1:37:10] and as a strong man to run a race
[1:37:13] so John says here's the bridegroom
[1:37:18] he that hath the bride is the bridegroom
[1:37:22] so this is he
[1:37:27] now the truth manifested
[1:37:31] in Luke 19 41 and 20 and 40 41 and 42.
[1:37:38] Luke 19 41 and 42.
[1:37:42] oh I'm not dragging this out too much
[1:37:47] and when it was come near
[1:37:49] he beheld the city and he wept over
[1:37:52] saying if thou Hast known even thou at
[1:37:57] least in this thy day
[1:38:00] the things which belong unto thy peace
[1:38:02] but now they hid from thine eyes
[1:38:05] in Luke in Isaiah 40 and verse 5
[1:38:09] and the glory of the Lord shall be
[1:38:11] revealed
[1:38:12] and All Flesh will see it together
[1:38:14] for the mouth of the Lord unspoken we
[1:38:16] read that earlier
[1:38:17] so John and John Saint John 4 1 and 14.
[1:38:22] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:38:25] Among Us
[1:38:26] and we beheld his glory
[1:38:29] the glories of the only god of the
[1:38:31] father full of grace
[1:38:33] and truth
[1:38:37] so truth that lame foreign years
[1:38:41] in the streets
[1:38:43] was now standing before him
[1:38:46] John wrote and said we've been held as
[1:38:49] his glory
[1:38:51] full of grace and truth
[1:38:55] amen
[1:38:58] John 14 and 6.
[1:39:01] Jesus said unto him
[1:39:03] I am the way the truth and the life
[1:39:07] no man cometh unto me
[1:39:10] unto the father but by me
[1:39:14] I am the way the truth and the life
[1:39:17] now in John 18th chapter
[1:39:20] verses 37-38
[1:39:23] Jesus
[1:39:26] had already
[1:39:29] just if I come to the end of his
[1:39:31] ministry
[1:39:32] he told one point he said look
[1:39:35] if you can't believe me
[1:39:38] for the works for the words
[1:39:41] that I speak
[1:39:43] then believe me for the very work's sake
[1:39:46] for there they was due testify of me
[1:39:51] so I told him I am the way the truth and
[1:39:53] the life
[1:39:54] now he's standing before a pilot
[1:39:56] pilate said unto him or thy King then
[1:40:00] Jesus answered thou says that I am a
[1:40:04] king
[1:40:04] to this sin to this end was I born and
[1:40:09] for this cause came out into the world
[1:40:12] that I should bear witness
[1:40:14] unto the truth I didn't bear witness to
[1:40:19] the works that he done
[1:40:21] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[1:40:25] voice
[1:40:26] pilate said unto him
[1:40:29] what is truth
[1:40:32] and he's sitting there standing there
[1:40:34] looking right at it
[1:40:37] what is truth
[1:40:40] and when he said this
[1:40:43] he went out again under the Jews and
[1:40:45] said unto them
[1:40:47] I find no fault
[1:40:49] in him at all
[1:40:55] what is truth
[1:41:01] so amazing
[1:41:04] that Pilate
[1:41:05] was fulfilling truth right then
[1:41:12] he took a lamb just like the Jews were
[1:41:14] doing at the same time
[1:41:16] the Jews were taking a lamb keeping it
[1:41:18] up putting it up try it check it out
[1:41:21] make sure there's no spot there's no
[1:41:22] blemish on it
[1:41:25] Christ has been examined they've been
[1:41:28] beaten have been scorched
[1:41:33] truth is being fulfilled
[1:41:37] the priests high priest says there's no
[1:41:40] fault that I am
[1:41:42] that's a good lamb
[1:41:45] taken for the slaughter
[1:41:49] Ed anything Justice had Christ examined
[1:41:54] crisis standing for a pilate
[1:41:57] pilot says I find no fault
[1:42:02] he's without blemish
[1:42:05] that spot
[1:42:07] amen perfect lamb
[1:42:09] I find no fault
[1:42:15] I said the other day songs talking
[1:42:20] and I said at that moment
[1:42:23] s
[1:42:24] a little more spiritual
[1:42:28] than the priest
[1:42:30] because they think say I find no fault
[1:42:35] the Jews said crucify him
[1:42:39] but they were all fulfilling truth
[1:42:43] couldn't do nothing against truth on
[1:42:45] fulfill it
[1:42:50] in the voice of the sign brother random
[1:42:51] said we noticed now that Jesus
[1:42:55] when he came on the scene
[1:42:57] he was the prophesied word
[1:43:00] he had a Ministry to fulfill
[1:43:04] do you believe that he asked
[1:43:07] sure he had a Ministry notice to be
[1:43:10] fulfilled what was written of him
[1:43:18] old fools slow of heart to believe the
[1:43:21] word of God don't you know that Christ
[1:43:24] has suffer these things didn't all the
[1:43:27] prophets
[1:43:28] speak that he should do this and then
[1:43:31] enter into his glory
[1:43:33] he has to fulfill everything that he
[1:43:36] come he come to heal that it might be
[1:43:39] fulfilled he did this that it might be
[1:43:42] fulfilled everything he done was to be
[1:43:44] fulfilling because he had to be the
[1:43:47] voice of that scripture
[1:43:50] but before he done it he went forth to
[1:43:54] The Healing Ministry he in the sick
[1:43:57] everybody wanted to see the sign
[1:44:00] sure they believed the healing but the
[1:44:03] voice changed it
[1:44:06] one day when he said I and the father
[1:44:08] are one
[1:44:10] that was too much for them
[1:44:12] you make yourself God being a man
[1:44:16] when the sign they believed it
[1:44:18] but when they heard a voice behind it
[1:44:22] a Ministry that followed that sign they
[1:44:25] didn't get it
[1:44:27] that's when trouble set in
[1:44:31] he told the disciples and told the crowd
[1:44:34] said the multitude
[1:44:35] said accepted my flesh drink my blood
[1:44:38] you have no life in you
[1:44:40] and from that moment they
[1:44:42] turned away from him
[1:44:44] no longer followed him he turned to the
[1:44:46] twelve said will you leave me off soon
[1:44:49] but they heard the voice
[1:44:52] to whom shall return for thou Hast the
[1:44:55] words of
[1:44:57] eternal life
[1:45:00] can you say Amen
[1:45:03] I promise I'll hurry
[1:45:06] but in Saint John 10 24-30
[1:45:10] then came the Jews around about him and
[1:45:13] said unto him
[1:45:15] how long does thou make us to doubt
[1:45:18] if thou me to Christ tell us plainly
[1:45:22] Christ had already
[1:45:24] fulfilled his ministry
[1:45:27] had told them
[1:45:30] The Works bear with us who I am
[1:45:35] tell us plainly
[1:45:37] don't make this doubt
[1:45:39] well if you knew the word if you knew
[1:45:41] the scripture if you'd heard if you had
[1:45:43] done what John
[1:45:45] said to do repent
[1:45:49] and catch his message
[1:45:52] then you'd understand who I am
[1:45:56] that's the truth
[1:45:59] but they didn't do that
[1:46:01] so there's two wondering how long does
[1:46:04] thou make us doubt
[1:46:06] he fulfills every scripture how long
[1:46:09] does thou make us doubt tell us plainly
[1:46:11] it's just as plain as the nose in your
[1:46:13] face
[1:46:15] just as plain as that word that you read
[1:46:18] every Sabbath
[1:46:23] I told you you believe not
[1:46:25] The Works that I do in my father's name
[1:46:27] they bear witness of me
[1:46:29] but you believe not because you're not
[1:46:31] of my sheep
[1:46:32] as I said unto you my sheep hear my
[1:46:35] voice
[1:46:36] and I know them and they follow me
[1:46:39] and I give unto them eternal life they
[1:46:41] shall never perish he said any man plug
[1:46:43] them out of my hand
[1:46:45] My Father which gave them me is greater
[1:46:47] than all and no man is able to pluck
[1:46:51] them out of my father's hand
[1:46:54] now I'm gonna
[1:46:57] preach through this
[1:46:59] but in Saint John 14 15.
[1:47:02] John Torres Christ told him the
[1:47:04] disciples
[1:47:06] he said I'm not going to leave you
[1:47:07] comfortless I will send unto you the
[1:47:09] comforter even the spirit of Truth
[1:47:15] he dwelt with you and shall be in you
[1:47:19] now
[1:47:22] I won't say this
[1:47:24] that the disciples
[1:47:27] when we're talking about a voice
[1:47:30] and we're talking about a prophet
[1:47:33] and God ordaining a man
[1:47:36] for specific office
[1:47:39] for setting up a specific part
[1:47:46] most people can't receive that
[1:47:49] because they think we're exalting a man
[1:47:52] they think the man is being exalted
[1:47:54] himself
[1:47:57] it's the hardest brother Bradham said
[1:47:59] it's the hardest thing to get one mortal
[1:48:01] to believe in others
[1:48:05] but the disciples
[1:48:08] were not given the Mysteries
[1:48:11] they were promised
[1:48:13] unto you it is given to know the
[1:48:15] Mysteries
[1:48:17] but it was the Mysteries were not given
[1:48:19] unto them
[1:48:22] they all bear with me
[1:48:25] II Peter 1 16-18
[1:48:28] they bore Witness
[1:48:31] what they had seen
[1:48:33] what they'd heard
[1:48:35] until protect them
[1:48:37] but as yet did not understand the
[1:48:41] Mysteries
[1:48:44] for example
[1:48:45] second Peter 1 16-18
[1:48:48] for we have not followed cunningly
[1:48:50] divised Fables
[1:48:52] when we made known unto you the power
[1:48:54] and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:48:58] where I Witnesses of his majesty
[1:49:02] for he received from God the Father
[1:49:03] honor and Glory
[1:49:06] when there came such a voice to him from
[1:49:08] the excellent Glory
[1:49:09] this is my beloved Son whom I'm well
[1:49:12] pleased
[1:49:13] and this voice which came from the
[1:49:15] heaven from heaven we heard when we were
[1:49:18] with him in the Holy Mountain
[1:49:20] first John 1 verses 1-3
[1:49:24] that which was from the beginning which
[1:49:27] we have heard we have seen with our eyes
[1:49:30] we have looked Upon Our Hands have
[1:49:32] handled the word of life
[1:49:35] for the life was manifested we have seen
[1:49:38] it and bear witness and shown you that
[1:49:41] eternal life which is with the father
[1:49:43] and was manifested unto us
[1:49:46] that which we have seen and heard
[1:49:47] declare we unto you that you may also
[1:49:51] have fellowship with us and truly our
[1:49:53] fellowships with the father and with his
[1:49:55] son Jesus Christ
[1:49:57] now I was not until the Paul and the
[1:49:59] Apostle Paul's conversion
[1:50:02] that these Mysteries were made known
[1:50:05] the other just sent me testified
[1:50:08] what they had seen witnessed handled the
[1:50:11] word of life these things
[1:50:13] but it was the misses were not revealed
[1:50:16] unto them Jesus simply said unto you it
[1:50:19] is given to know
[1:50:21] the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:50:23] so in Acts 26
[1:50:25] 13-16 amid day O King I saw in the way
[1:50:29] alive from heaven about the brightness
[1:50:31] of the sun shining round about me and
[1:50:34] then was journeyed with me
[1:50:36] and when we were all Fallen to the earth
[1:50:39] I heard a voice speaking unto me and
[1:50:41] sang in Hebrew tongue saw Saul why
[1:50:45] persecuted thou mean it is hard for thee
[1:50:48] to kick against the Pricks and I said
[1:50:52] who art thou Lord he said I am Jesus who
[1:50:55] now persecuted us
[1:50:57] but rise and stand upon thy feet for I
[1:51:00] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[1:51:03] to make thee a minister
[1:51:06] and a witness both of these things which
[1:51:09] thou has seen
[1:51:11] and if those things in the witch are
[1:51:14] will appear unto thee
[1:51:17] and the voice of the son brother said
[1:51:19] this
[1:51:20] he couldn't understand how the pillar of
[1:51:22] fire was this was the one that had led
[1:51:25] his people out of Egypt that was the one
[1:51:28] who remember the Hebrews all through the
[1:51:30] age and here he is he's seen him he said
[1:51:34] Lord what is it that you wanted with me
[1:51:37] he said I am Jesus
[1:51:39] he's saying that this one that had led
[1:51:43] his people that he knowed all the time
[1:51:46] that Moses meant the I am ever present
[1:51:49] same yesterday today and forever was
[1:51:53] manifested in the flesh it was his
[1:51:56] revelation
[1:52:00] he had it above any of the rest of them
[1:52:05] so what did that seven do
[1:52:08] they get jealous
[1:52:11] did they quit inviting Paul to their
[1:52:14] camp meetings
[1:52:16] did they put him aside what do they do
[1:52:21] they feel him a threat did they compete
[1:52:23] with him
[1:52:25] come on
[1:52:32] what did he do
[1:52:33] brother Brown continues
[1:52:36] what did Paul do his Revelation was
[1:52:38] prophecy for today
[1:52:41] it was the voice coming forth
[1:52:44] wrote in the Bible to be Vindicated
[1:52:46] today again
[1:52:49] Hallelujah says it's the voice being
[1:52:52] Vindicated again what he wrote because
[1:52:55] he was God's prophet
[1:52:59] revealing the sign was speaking of
[1:53:02] something
[1:53:03] remember
[1:53:05] he chose 12 he said he chose them from
[1:53:07] before the foundation of the world
[1:53:10] he said I have chose 12 and one of them
[1:53:12] is the devil
[1:53:13] Paul had to take that place to be the
[1:53:17] chosen one
[1:53:21] now there was no hesitation on the part
[1:53:23] of the disciple was in jealousy there
[1:53:26] was no competition
[1:53:28] there was nothing
[1:53:29] they embraced Paul
[1:53:33] in Galatians 1 21-24
[1:53:37] afterwards I came to the regions of
[1:53:39] Syria and Celestia
[1:53:41] and it was Unknown by faith under the
[1:53:43] churches of Judea which were in Christ
[1:53:46] but they had heard only that he was
[1:53:49] persecuted Us in times past now preaches
[1:53:53] the faith which he once destroyed and
[1:53:56] they glorified
[1:53:58] God in Me
[1:54:06] just talked my heart
[1:54:09] I swear
[1:54:10] you through
[1:54:14] Paul being a prophet
[1:54:16] one place Peter wrote and he said
[1:54:19] you know Paul spoke things that were
[1:54:22] hard to be understood
[1:54:24] how come
[1:54:26] because he was caught up to the third
[1:54:28] heaven
[1:54:29] he's seen things that were not often to
[1:54:31] be uttered
[1:54:33] he was the abundance of Revelation that
[1:54:35] was given to him
[1:54:37] God gave him a thorn in the flesh a
[1:54:40] measure of Satan Buffet to him
[1:54:42] that's how great that Revelation was
[1:54:46] I mean he
[1:54:48] as a prophet he was able to discern the
[1:54:50] spirit of antichrist already it worked
[1:54:56] he's seen all these things
[1:54:59] and warned the Church of it
[1:55:02] says as a prophet
[1:55:05] he was the first church age messenger
[1:55:08] in that right
[1:55:11] and he fought and he fought against the
[1:55:13] Beast of Ephesus
[1:55:15] he fought against the spirit of the
[1:55:16] Antichrist
[1:55:17] he warned but told him he told the
[1:55:19] church you no longer Children of the
[1:55:21] Night your children of the day
[1:55:23] that these things should not creep upon
[1:55:25] you
[1:55:27] a real prophet
[1:55:30] now
[1:55:35] we find that
[1:55:38] truth Jesus had said
[1:55:41] I will never leave you nor forsake you
[1:55:46] he told them said men are gonna
[1:55:50] Cast Your Way for their presence
[1:55:53] they're going to treat you all the men
[1:55:55] of things unto you
[1:55:57] but I will never leave nor forsake you
[1:56:01] I'm going to come unto you
[1:56:04] I'm going to dwell in you I'm going to
[1:56:07] send you the spirit of Truth
[1:56:10] so you know brother Brandon in the
[1:56:13] Smyrna Church age
[1:56:15] he said
[1:56:17] that
[1:56:19] when they went through
[1:56:21] horrendous things that they went through
[1:56:26] he said you with them because God is the
[1:56:28] god of love
[1:56:30] daddy would take all the suffering away
[1:56:32] from me
[1:56:33] would not allow them to go through the
[1:56:35] Temptations they went through
[1:56:38] but he said God's love is not a Panzer
[1:56:41] so to speak a panda love
[1:56:44] but it's love that it's able to keep you
[1:56:47] and to carry you through all the dark
[1:56:50] hours
[1:56:51] so just like he was with it Hebrew
[1:56:54] children in the fire furnace
[1:56:57] the king looked up and now we cast in
[1:57:00] three
[1:57:01] how did I see four
[1:57:03] Christ they're all alone
[1:57:07] and so Christ in his church
[1:57:10] he told them I will never leave you nor
[1:57:11] forsake you
[1:57:13] he come to them as the word of God made
[1:57:15] flesh
[1:57:17] he was truth revealed in every age
[1:57:22] now the masses
[1:57:25] tried to destroy truth
[1:57:27] but they wrote a fulfilling truth
[1:57:30] because you knew nothing against the
[1:57:31] truth only for the truth
[1:57:34] and so when we had read the scripture
[1:57:36] earlier
[1:57:37] about
[1:57:39] he that had to Bryden is the bridegroom
[1:57:45] Paul said it in second Corinthians 11.
[1:57:49] I would that you would bear with me my
[1:57:50] father didn't need to bear with me
[1:57:54] they were
[1:57:56] attacked and criticizing
[1:57:58] the messenger
[1:58:00] he told us that may be rude in speech he
[1:58:03] was a stutterer
[1:58:05] but I'm not rude knowledge
[1:58:09] he told me he said our fearless by any
[1:58:11] means his serpent but God lean
[1:58:14] he's also corrupt your
[1:58:17] Minds
[1:58:19] from Simplicity as in Christ
[1:58:24] so The Voice
[1:58:27] that Christ was
[1:58:30] was not as Church
[1:58:35] Paul knew
[1:58:36] the responsibility committed unto him
[1:58:42] because the bride had been placed in his
[1:58:46] hands
[1:58:49] so understand that
[1:58:51] so we find through each successive
[1:58:54] Church age
[1:58:56] that that bride is like Eliezer
[1:58:59] carried the bride Rebecca
[1:59:01] all the way to
[1:59:05] Isaac
[1:59:08] she had there was marauding bands
[1:59:12] there's all kinds of dangers
[1:59:15] all kinds of things the L Israel was
[1:59:17] responsible for her
[1:59:19] to get her from point A to point B
[1:59:25] we find it all the way through
[1:59:28] the next thing you read it's in the
[1:59:30] evening time
[1:59:34] when Isaac comes out the tent
[1:59:38] and she joined with Isaac isn't that
[1:59:40] right
[1:59:42] and so the spirit of God
[1:59:44] said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:59:46] you
[1:59:47] scared this by through each successive
[1:59:49] Church age
[1:59:52] and it looked like the truth
[1:59:55] was buried Lion's tree once again
[2:00:00] the masses reject the truth and cast it
[2:00:03] away
[2:00:04] but the bride because she's kept by the
[2:00:08] spirit
[2:00:09] fulfilling Truth for in the word
[2:00:13] this
[2:00:14] the spirit of God is always carried
[2:00:16] right on through
[2:00:18] to where we're at today
[2:00:23] and so we find what I'm going to use a
[2:00:25] couple of scriptures and find them
[2:00:28] turn over to Psalms
[2:00:34] say I think Psalms 19.
[2:00:59] I'm sorry let's turn to Joel
[2:01:02] turn the jaw
[2:01:06] the second chapter
[2:01:10] and the 16th verse
[2:01:19] in Psalms 19 I think we did that earlier
[2:01:22] who talks about the bride's room coming
[2:01:25] forth out of his chamber has a strong
[2:01:27] man to run the race remember that
[2:01:30] we read that scripture
[2:01:33] the soul man's running right side I love
[2:01:34] these scriptures because
[2:01:36] Paul said look
[2:01:38] the whole book of Hebrews if he you
[2:01:41] understand it
[2:01:43] was Paul's defense
[2:01:46] of the Gospel
[2:01:49] because there have been men that come in
[2:01:52] trying to subvert to hear
[2:01:55] and bring them back under Judaism
[2:01:59] unsacrifices of Moses
[2:02:02] and this is why the Paul
[2:02:05] started that first chapter of Hebrews
[2:02:08] and he said
[2:02:10] God who spoke to us
[2:02:13] nine
[2:02:15] just hundred times diverse manners
[2:02:18] hath not spoke to us this last day
[2:02:21] bye to his son
[2:02:23] Jesus Christ
[2:02:25] the last day he's spoken of
[2:02:28] his last days of Israel
[2:02:32] so what he done
[2:02:35] she explained in that first chapter
[2:02:38] about Christ's been there of all things
[2:02:42] he goes to the second third and fourth
[2:02:44] chapter
[2:02:45] warning them
[2:02:47] she looks at your forefathers back under
[2:02:50] Moses
[2:02:53] they say my Works probably for 40 years
[2:02:58] but didn't blame me
[2:03:03] sorry he's trying to get the horse
[2:03:05] smacked focused
[2:03:08] and it starts in the fifth chapter
[2:03:11] and begins to teach who Christ was
[2:03:16] so it comes all the way down to the 12th
[2:03:18] chapter
[2:03:20] and he said after going through the 11th
[2:03:22] chapter
[2:03:23] the chapter of Faith he rose the faith
[2:03:27] how they all died looking I'd ever seen
[2:03:30] the promise or received the promise but
[2:03:33] haven't seen it afar off embraced it
[2:03:36] they all died for that
[2:03:41] so it starts with 12 1 of Hebrews and it
[2:03:44] says
[2:03:45] sing therefore we're capacity Baptist
[2:03:48] the word cloud of witnesses
[2:03:49] let his left side every way to the sin
[2:03:52] the unbelief was thus so easily beset us
[2:03:57] let us run this race with patience
[2:03:59] looking under Jesus Christ the author
[2:04:02] and the picture of our faith
[2:04:06] so in Joel here we read this
[2:04:09] or
[2:04:12] you know
[2:04:14] Psalms 19 we read about so many run the
[2:04:17] race
[2:04:18] so Christ run that race right along the
[2:04:20] church
[2:04:21] all we went through
[2:04:24] you know when they
[2:04:27] run a marathon
[2:04:29] the Baton
[2:04:31] start off at the same baton
[2:04:35] but the appetite takes on greater
[2:04:37] meaning
[2:04:39] The Closer You Reach
[2:04:41] get to the end
[2:04:43] them Runners are timed perfectly
[2:04:46] they don't get out of Step
[2:04:49] how many of them they struggle with a
[2:04:53] strong leg for the strong beginning
[2:04:57] and then whatever the second runner sees
[2:05:00] them coming
[2:05:01] he already starts
[2:05:03] build a speed up
[2:05:06] to that Runner that holds the head up
[2:05:08] behind
[2:05:09] never leaves in his eyes off that track
[2:05:12] straight ahead
[2:05:13] and that Runner coming up
[2:05:17] it's being built up ladies right in that
[2:05:19] Palm yeah not stretched he takes that
[2:05:22] button he runs
[2:05:24] and come up the next Runner and run
[2:05:26] season coming he starts to build up a
[2:05:28] speed yeah and he gets up to the same
[2:05:30] pace
[2:05:31] the hand stretched back
[2:05:33] the same baton
[2:05:36] Jesus Christ
[2:05:37] same yesterday today and forever
[2:05:40] the seven Church ages
[2:05:42] but that baton took on new meaning
[2:05:45] because now we're at the end
[2:05:52] so I'm just strong man I would never
[2:05:53] leave you nor forsake you
[2:05:55] a strong man come forth as a strong man
[2:05:57] to run the race
[2:06:00] with Adam with his bride
[2:06:03] so enjoy
[2:06:05] two and
[2:06:07] 16 gather the people together
[2:06:09] sanctify the congregation assemble the
[2:06:12] elders
[2:06:13] gather the children and those who suck
[2:06:16] the breast
[2:06:17] let the bridegroom go forth out of his
[2:06:19] chamber and their bride out of her
[2:06:21] closet
[2:06:24] so
[2:06:26] the Mysteries
[2:06:29] Jesus said when you prayed
[2:06:31] don't pray open us
[2:06:33] like hypocrisy
[2:06:35] enter your closet
[2:06:37] and the father sent me a secret
[2:06:40] sure wore the opening
[2:06:42] so the bride
[2:06:44] come in that closet
[2:06:47] the bride room was with her and then her
[2:06:51] she deserves to the mystery
[2:06:53] for her age the message for her age
[2:06:57] you come down through each successive
[2:06:59] Church age
[2:07:01] but the scripture said about how we all
[2:07:03] know scripture in Malachi 4 verses 5 and
[2:07:07] 6.
[2:07:09] that
[2:07:12] Elijah the prophet would come
[2:07:15] in their right
[2:07:16] for the great and dredgey of the Lord
[2:07:19] and so we find in Luke 17 30. and other
[2:07:23] scriptures
[2:07:24] that are being fulfilled truth being
[2:07:27] fulfilled in this day
[2:07:29] but people have not been able to
[2:07:31] recognize the vindication
[2:07:34] they rejoice in the first and second
[2:07:36] pool
[2:07:37] my brother got his ministry
[2:07:39] but in the third pool that was a secret
[2:07:42] there was no sign to that
[2:07:44] it was a voice
[2:07:47] just a voice
[2:07:49] Sciences had a voice
[2:07:52] but we find that at last
[2:07:55] for his third pool
[2:07:58] had no sign
[2:08:01] it was a mystery president said whatever
[2:08:04] that tent said
[2:08:06] said God never tell right this will not
[2:08:09] be impersonated
[2:08:12] this is the bride's Revival
[2:08:17] so
[2:08:19] we find it together people together
[2:08:23] the bride the inner closet
[2:08:26] and God kept her through these Mysteries
[2:08:28] oh Atlanta Church age
[2:08:31] but now we read over name is
[2:08:35] the line of the Lord
[2:08:37] who can never prophesy
[2:08:42] you got to understand
[2:08:44] the verb above verses
[2:08:46] he talked about the lion
[2:08:50] would not Roar except he was taken
[2:08:54] meat
[2:08:56] the young lives did not answer
[2:08:59] can say the young wolves
[2:09:01] they would not answer
[2:09:04] the
[2:09:12] the lines were substitute of praise
[2:09:17] and they hunkered down and saw the Dead
[2:09:19] would make our noise anyone who found
[2:09:22] out that was sealed away
[2:09:25] but when that line roared
[2:09:29] everything quieted down
[2:09:31] everything pulled back
[2:09:35] then the young webs recognized
[2:09:38] that voice
[2:09:40] and they answered back
[2:09:43] because they knew now
[2:09:45] that it was a spiritual meeting new
[2:09:47] season
[2:09:50] so people fall into the practice
[2:09:51] Ministry
[2:09:53] I mean they together they're about
[2:09:55] hundreds of thousands
[2:09:58] but when he begins the third pool
[2:10:04] they forsook him
[2:10:08] but the Bride come out of the closest
[2:10:11] can you say Amen
[2:10:13] why because it was so Vindicated
[2:10:17] cloud in the heavens
[2:10:20] accostation angels
[2:10:25] Christ
[2:10:28] or the head of we brought him
[2:10:30] Harrisons
[2:10:32] such a vindication
[2:10:36] that we knew
[2:10:38] we knew according to the scripture
[2:10:42] that was being fulfilled
[2:10:46] this is our day
[2:10:49] they had tried to step out Truth All
[2:10:51] Through the Dark Ages to the days of the
[2:10:54] modern the Dark Ages they tried stuff
[2:10:57] out truth
[2:10:58] but all they did was fulfill truth
[2:11:03] they tried to
[2:11:05] criticize us
[2:11:08] and there have been men that have come
[2:11:10] against this message
[2:11:12] starting this message
[2:11:13] become against this message
[2:11:17] but they're doing nothing more than
[2:11:18] fulfilling truth
[2:11:20] their part
[2:11:24] called Scripps said it must need to be
[2:11:26] heresies among you if they which are
[2:11:29] approved to Christ they may manifest
[2:11:33] y'all hear me okay
[2:11:37] so here we are and I really
[2:11:40] have said it's concerned the absolute
[2:11:44] then this day right here
[2:11:46] the things that Paul prophesied
[2:11:48] are now unfortunately some of the things
[2:11:50] said
[2:11:53] we're living at a time I tell you
[2:11:57] I'm 72 years old I've never seen
[2:11:59] anything like this in my life
[2:12:06] but Paul said God has not given us a
[2:12:08] spirit of fear but a power and of love
[2:12:12] and sound a sound mind
[2:12:15] stabilized mind
[2:12:19] stabilized by an absolute truth
[2:12:26] the Lion's roared
[2:12:28] 10-3
[2:12:30] who can have Revelation 10 and 3. who
[2:12:33] can never prophesy
[2:12:39] somebody pulled back in the line
[2:12:43] in the prophet
[2:12:45] stood up
[2:12:47] since thus said the Lord
[2:12:52] 1963 Sears are open
[2:12:57] and brother the bride
[2:12:59] flock to him
[2:13:01] because he recognized that voice
[2:13:07] I'm glad for that
[2:13:09] I'm sorry took so long
[2:13:12] I hope I'm here
[2:13:14] for your minds a little bit this morning
[2:13:19] to stay with it
[2:13:22] don't turn away from that
[2:13:25] you stay with the truth
[2:13:28] people cast truth in the street and
[2:13:31] trample over it
[2:13:33] they'll Mark the man of God
[2:13:36] to criticize the message
[2:13:39] they'll do everything like that they can
[2:13:40] they just
[2:13:42] help people for them really feel for him
[2:13:46] but based on my own personal experience
[2:13:48] what I went through
[2:13:50] how God led me
[2:13:53] told me three different times
[2:13:56] he's been taught in there
[2:13:58] that third time everything that I've
[2:14:00] been taught everything I believe left me
[2:14:02] and just totally left me
[2:14:05] it was a great board in my life
[2:14:07] but God filled that void
[2:14:10] he gave me spiritual meat and due season
[2:14:13] I can't deny him no more
[2:14:17] no one knew that
[2:14:20] and so I encourage you all just keep
[2:14:23] pressing the word we're at the threshold
[2:14:25] of going home
[2:14:29] Fred we just don't realize how close we
[2:14:31] are
[2:14:35] we sometimes wonder why
[2:14:38] to all these there are things that
[2:14:40] happen in our lives
[2:14:42] that serves as distractions
[2:14:46] to turn our hearts and our minds away
[2:14:47] from these really crucial
[2:14:51] but this is why Paul taught us in
[2:14:54] First Corinthians 13.
[2:14:56] concerning charity
[2:14:59] he said look here if I have all the
[2:15:01] knowledge
[2:15:03] so I understand all Mysteries
[2:15:06] and I have all faithful I have to move
[2:15:09] mountains I get my body to be burned
[2:15:12] I mean he bases he's lying out
[2:15:15] what's going to happen in seven Church
[2:15:17] ages
[2:15:18] and have not charity it probably
[2:15:24] nothing and so we go through so many
[2:15:26] things
[2:15:27] you don't go through it and physically I
[2:15:29] go through sometimes because my physical
[2:15:32] I go through sometimes mentally
[2:15:35] and it's just a battle
[2:15:38] but I can't let myself be distracted
[2:15:42] though God slay me yet will I serve him
[2:15:48] God allows me to stay on Earth
[2:15:50] his condition
[2:15:52] it's got to be for a reason
[2:15:54] because God knows all things these
[2:15:56] Sovereign judgments
[2:15:58] Sovereign in his actions
[2:16:00] but I want to encourage y'all just to
[2:16:03] mail together
[2:16:05] Stay Together
[2:16:06] let your heart be filled with the love
[2:16:08] of God
[2:16:09] and the peace that passes all
[2:16:11] understanding
