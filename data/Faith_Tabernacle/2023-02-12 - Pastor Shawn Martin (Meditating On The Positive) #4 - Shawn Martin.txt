the Lord there's one thing we can boast on and that's the Lord amen and I'm so glad for that amen well I trust you had a good afternoon and the musicians can be dismissed and and you've just come to Worship the Lord this evening I'm glad the well weather has held off amen and we're able to meet today and just to glorify the Lord amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms and the 19th Chapter praise the lord it's just good to be a Christian and I can't just thank God enough for um bringing me to the message of the hour and giving me a heart to believe in amen you know you you think of the so many in the world today that trying to find the answers or think they have the answers without vindication and but we're a people that know that we have the answers simply because we've seen the Vindication of God over and over and over amen and um we may not understand everything that God has done today but we know that he has done something and I'm just so glad for that amen it just puts my heart at rest and um we know that we can see the time that we're living in the day that we're living in and when the things that are going on out in the world Amen we we know that it's just exactly the way God's ordained it to be amen but we've been told to lift our head up amen for our Redemption draws tonight amen before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and talk to our father Lord Jesus it's words just can't express Lord what you are we tried Lord and even your spirit coming upon man to write the songs that we sing and yet Lord it it just can't express All That You Are the Lord we sing them because it's an expression of our heart to you Lord and let the world know that you are tremendous that your strength never fails Lord that you're high and exalted and You Are God Alone father and in our feeble efforts to describe you Lord we pray that it's pleasing in your sight and Lord may you just feel welcome in this place this evening Lord among your people among Believers father for We Believe Lord in the impossible We Believe father we don't limit you just to science or technology or even what our own mind can fathom that we believe beyond that Lord that you work when no one else can we know your work and even when we can't see it with our natural eye and oh God if you just come Among Us now and just do a work within every one of us Lord and we give you the room to do so we give you the Liberty to do so for your God and all we thank you Lord anoint the word not the speaking anoint the hearing of your word we ask it in Jesus name amen we look at Psalms here the 19th I believe chapter and I just want to read the uh 14th verse praise the Lord but it says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord my strength and my redeemer amen you can have your seats this evening praise the Lord you know just going to be simple this evening and not to take you time too much but before the world God chose to work through man and as I've said it today and and we all know it but God chose a specific people that he would work through but but yet uh uh I I believe that he he had predestinated a people to every age and as the prophet would tell us that he would lay his word out for each age and then there would be a people come along in that age to fulfill and to manifest that word but we know that he can work through most any man um you know he he has that right he has that ability to do that and um he came and has anointed uh men who are converted and would never be saved they're they're lost and uh and we read about it throughout the Bible um you know just comes to my mind Balaam and how that Balaam was a false prophet but he was a prophet and he come to to um to curse Israel and yet when he every time he opened his mouth he blessed Israel uh and then prophecies still stand because it was the word of the Lord coming through that man we we look at it all the way even down through uh to Judas uh which was the son of perdition and uh yeah he was among those that was anointed to heal the sick cast out devils and and these things and yet we see the end and and uh the Bible says he was the son of perdition he was of that Wicked one and so uh when the anointing though goes off of them then they they return back to what they were before the anointing Came Upon them and so uh uh so God can use anyone that he wants to and some people again when the anointing comes their use for specific specific reasons specific purpose and when the anointing lifts they go back to what what what they were um and and so and such again was the case of Caiaphas uh he prophesied among among them and and um and and and then yet had Jesus crucified and these things but he was truly anointed ain't that right so but then there is a people that God has Supreme control over and uh and these are the ones that are the Overcomers these are the ones that are changed forever these are the ones that's been purchased with the blood of Jesus Christ and and they are the ones that Paul would say you're not your own uh you've been bought with the price therefore glorify God in your body and so they are the ones that God works through not just to prophesy not just to dance not just to preach not just to play music not just to whatever amen but these are ones that God has uh called for himself uh to to defeat demonic Powers um and to they are the ones at the third pool operates in they're the ones that comes into this adoption they are the ones as Adam that has dominion and so um I believe that God strategically made us for this purpose and the way he designed us is important and it's something that I guess that we should know how does he use us how how do we overcome how do we make the word work for us and again my my thought is meditating on the positive um I think these are legitimate questions um it's it's we we should think about things we we should want to understand things I you know it's fine to go to church and have have a good Rendezvous and go home and then but what did the service mean to us what what what what is my life here as a husband as a uh you know I was going to say as a wife I'm not a wife but what what what does what what does the meaning for you women to be wives or to be mothers dads to be husbands and why would God choose us and and and and these things why does God bring us into the message of the hour um you know and what makes us different what what is behind it all what's his plans and and things like that and and so now you know um I think these are legitimate questions simply because uh we know that his word is a seed and that his word has to fall in ground it's it's going to fall uh and we are that ground that the seed falls upon ain't that right and so Jesus spoke of the four types of ground and Matthew uh 13 and 3 starting he says in breaking in it just says behold A sower went forth the soul now he's saying this for a reason he ain't just telling you a past history lesson that he's this is prophetic and uh that applies to you and I and he says or into this world it applies to the world in mankind and when he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and divired it up uh some fell up on Stony places where they had not much Earth and forthwith they sprang up because they had no deepness of Earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away and so talking about the word right and so some fail among thorns and the Thorns sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit and some hundredfolds some 64 some 34 ain't that right so we know that the seed is the word of God and so the seed is thrown out there it's sown but not not everybody produces the word not the word is not productive in every ground but there's some that is good ground that brings forth the word and so if we are the good ground which I I believe that I'm good ground and I you'd believe that way yourself uh then the word is sown into us that word that is sown into US is to prosper ain't that right it it's got to prosper God means for the word to prosper so God's left us tapes God's left us books to read of the message of the hour not every book that is written out out that you see in the Bible book story that's not for you good books maybe but not for you but there are books and that is the message of the hour there are tapes and uh and I know Ministries make a lot of tapes but there are tapes that that are for you and that is the message of this hour ain't that right and and so uh uh and then then we come to church what's the purpose of Us coming to church just so we do our duty that I don't believe that I I think God wants us to come to church God's brought ministers you've got you know you've you've we've got pastors we've got evangelists we've got teachers and we've got uh missionaries and and all of these things and everyone's got their part and yet we've got we've got them all out there that uh that that in all kinds of denominations and all of that and I'm going to exclude a lot of that and and tell you there that there's Real Men of God that are preaching the message of the hour and and we should be concerned about these things because you know uh brother Branham talks about how that if you've got a bowl of soup and at from a restaurant and you saw fly and here's that soup or even a hair I mean that's for me you know if I see a hair in my food that's it done you know I ain't touching that food you know well brother Brown says if you're going to do that on the natural what about what we put in the soul because it's important do you believe that so then we we find that that we we we we've got to realize that we're ground and and and and and again we're looking that we're good ground and so then then we're whatever Falls uh in US then then it's meant to to grow it's meant uh you understand what I'm saying and so if we receive just any word if we receive I and and you just have to forgive me I'm gonna try to get somewhere in just a moment but I'm thinking of how uh uh acceptable children are if you take the child and you belittle that child and constantly tell him he's no good and he's he's this and he's a failure and and these things well what you're doing is you're planting words into that child you're planning them and what you're doing is You're Building complexes in that child before you know it he begins to believe it an innocent little baby grows up and he becomes a teenager he becomes a grown man and and he can actually even be get married and all that and he still has these complexes he still battles the words that you were planning as when he was just a little kid and ain't that right you can plant fear in a child you can plant you can plant positiveness in a child you can put because words are seeds ain't that right and and so I I think every chance we get we we ought to tell our child and this is just naturally how good they are and how positive they are even when you correct them you know how much you love that child and you love them and and you you you you and it's because even though through the correction you're planting seeds in that child that you're positive God's got something for you amen you're you're you're you're God's God's got a Rapture for you don't just leave them for the world to put things in that plant seeds ain't that right because after all we we are ground amen I think we could even do that with marriage at the same time amen you know but I love to tell my wife I love her and I I um how she's beautiful how she's uh means so much to me you know now we may have our spats we may have our little differences but if I just leave it to that then it'll build complexes and all that and I know how Satan does he tries to work them complexes you know he tries to plant them and there might be some things that I say that I shouldn't say that I always want to plant good things that that she's the love of my life and I ain't just saying that I mean that you know well because she she's ground she's she's a ground and so I want to plant seeds you understand what I'm saying just want to plant seeds well if if we understand that we are uh we are aground then then we we get that understanding based off of the Bible because Jesus calls us ground we are ground for God's word to be productive ain't that right so that's why you should never look at the word of God in a negative way because I don't believe that's what God intends us for us to understand the word of God Amen brother Ryan tells us the word of God is a love story it's a love letter to his bride and it's it's actually a word of God is God revealing love Secrets Whispering love secrets to his bride why he's wanting to instill seed in US it's it's something that he's building his bride up you believe that words are are something that is is is so we say stick sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me that's a lie words do a lot of damage and so we we we look at it and and by our opening scripture we understand that not all words and not all meditation uh is acceptable unto God ain't that right for for the uh the the the writers asking Let My Words and the meditation of my heart the words of my mouth the meditation of my heart be acceptable in unto thee ain't that right and so now we know that we can sin with our words and with what we meditate upon amen The Book of Job tells us that job did not sin with his lips ain't that right now I'm going to read some scriptures here Psalm 17 3 uh breaking in I believe it's David that said I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress another place says Psalm 71 8 let my mouth be filled with thy praise and With Thine honor all the day Psalm 71 15 my mouth shall show forth my mouth a man shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day so in other words I'm going to speak I'm going to project my words will project thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day Psalms 89 1 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever and with my mouth will I make known Thy Faithfulness to all generations so it's important what we say it's important the words that come out it's important what we say to the generations that is coming up how we project God how we project his word how we understand his word because if we have no understanding of his word then we cannot project his word right to the Next Generation ain't that right so I'm going to sing of the mercies of the Lord forever and with my mouth will I make known Thy Faithfulness to all generations in Proverbs it says Break It In My Mouth shall speak truth ain't that right now now we know what the Bible says Thy word is truth so my mouth shall speak Thy word ain't that right so now I as as I have said before you know Adam before he fell he didn't think anything of he didn't think of anything else but the word that's all he had was the word ain't that right it was the word he didn't speak anything but the word he didn't think anything but the word he had Dominion by the word it was the word that gave him that Dominion ain't that right amen he had power what he said came to pass you believe it that's why he just didn't have idle thinking he didn't just have all these kind of thoughts and he didn't meditate on us all these stocks he he was behind the word it was before sin came he had power with his words so he didn't just speak anything because he knew that what he said came to pass ain't that right so he didn't speak out of words like men do today he didn't think vain thoughts like men do today see he knew that his words had power it was only after the fall that Adam spoke words that expressed doubt and fear it was then that you know uh Adam would speak after the fall it was he spoke as one without Authority Jesus spoke with one as one with authority but now Adam how different that was Adam had once come to a place of authority he had that Authority his words had power brother Ram said it he could speak to a tree tree be plucked from there and be planted here he he could rearrange anything because he was God of the Earth and his words had the power but when sin came he lost that power now he was speaking negative things and look what the effect it had so but Redemption brings us back to what Adam lost and fell from ain't that right so now through Redemption God has provided a way and it's all based off of Calvary Redemption but God has provided us a way to where we could come back as Adam ain't that right God thinking for just a moment of God's plans he knew what he was going to do he knew he knew the sin and so he knew he was going to destroy so he sent Noah and Noah built an ark and he prepared that Ark and and brother Branham would ask the question why why would Noah come and prepare an ark and the answer he said was God was going to destroy the enemies of the world so God had to build a way to prepare to ride through it and so I got to say get to that and I'm looking it up because looking at this they hear Brother Branham begins to speak of the conditions of the world that that we're living in today and and he would talk about it and look where we're at today and we can identify and but he talked about how man is getting weaker and is becoming more susceptible to diseases he said the inner breeding and so forth has broke down the structure of the human being till it's nothing but a bunch of muck a ball of sickness and what done it science he said see look it's caused the genes between the man and the woman to weaken the physical weakness of the human being through the genes and the increase of of children is around 30 percent uh Mongolian uh is on the great climb and these weaknesses of breed interbreeding of the foods that we are eating for life is weakening the body which causes cancer mental troubles all kinds of diseases is setting in upon the human body because it's weakness yeah ain't that right we have we have found there there's not a more age than what is today of mental problems having mental everything becomes mental young people fighting mental battles uh brother Brown said it's a neurotic age mental and we're fighting mental pressures are we not and and and so now brother Branham is given us a an Insight is of what is causing these things that that are happening and it's the foods that we're eating it's it's something that is starting to break down and I uh um uh autistic children and things I've listened to the radio about a year ago and they said that it never uh has it been since in this this time that autistic children is is coming more autistic children are being born and things and you know what they place it upon Foods I thought wow you're a prophet told us years ago and here now they're they're describing describing this as the as as the foods now brother Brandon said 30 years ago he said about I gave a prophecy that it would come to pass that in the last days there would be diseases amongst animals amongst cattle eggs even to eggs and it would come to pass that there would be eggs that wouldn't be fit to eat and it would come to pass that people living in The Valleys he said now remember I prophesied that way back 30 years ago that it would come to pass that people living in valleys that I'd ask the Christians to move from the valley and then not to eat and different meats and things like that would be poison it'd be dangerous he said I believe I had it like that or for people to live in valleys and and things like that now we're we're coming into a place of of of these things happening uh uh uh diseases and breaking out and these things but what I got to thinking about this that we're not to fear everybody say we're not to fear we hear Jesus say fear not he says it quite often fear not and here in in the Book of Revelations I believe the the the first chapter Jesus as he's revealing says fear not for I am he that was dead and is alive again and I have the keys of death hell in the grave so we're not to fear because he is showing himself as the Conqueror ain't that right and what is he he's the word he is the word I'm I'm getting to a point brother random says you know because we're you know as I say we're not to fear because a way has been provided for us just as God provided a way for Noah the the danger was coming destruction was coming but God would provide a way that that Noah and that that elect could ride through it ain't that right brother Brandon says this God has made a way to destroy that cancer God has made a way to take blindness out of them eyes God has made a way do you believe that I believe that God has made a way to take away arthritis I believe that God has made a way to take away the heart conditions believe that God God has made a way I know the diseases are coming upon the land that God has made a way a man to take them from his people I just believe that I believe you you look at even Moses of how that that uh um uh when he come the plagues fell and they failed but they didn't fall on everybody they just fell upon a certain group but when it came to Israel God's people it never fell on them ain't that right never fell on them amen and so see God has made a way and that's what we've got to look at God has made a way now brother Bradham says now and I think this is important uh you know he just he just says it calmly and yet uh I I think how he brings that in it's important he says and what we are trying to do with this word this morning is to build something everybody say build something to build something for you to ride through on your Victory and that's God's word ain't that right see God's word thus saith the Lord see right through on his word God said so ain't that right so we're seeing it all come to pass destructions are in the land the death angel is rioting it's affecting the the physical being it's affecting the the mental it's affecting the soul it's affecting everything ain't that right our church is being that the churches around the world being affected by politics being affected governments everything is being affected because God Made A Way he's made a way for you to ride through victory and that is the word of God [Music] now thinking back again let the meditation of my heart the words of my mouth be acceptable we are a threefold being bodies spirit and soul the body is the outside man the spirit is the Inside Man and Satan has access to both just as much as God has access but Satan has access to these things but it's the Inner Man the soul is the inner man that's on the inside of the inside right that's the soul and so each of us if I could say it this way each of us determines who has access to that and and so uh uh these three things determine what we meditate and speak and I I really pray that the Lord helps me make it clear and again I'm not going to take long so you just hang in there with me see the words that we speak are the meditation of our thoughts because a word is just an expression of a thought it has to be a thought first then it becomes a word ain't that right even your actions are a result of your thoughts brother Ram says anytime a woman takes a wrong step she has to First receive it in her mind some Slicker has to persuade her she listens to it against her own judgment then the ACT is committed so first Satan hit his mind in the womb of her mind she doubted God's word then come the actual Act you see what I'm saying so another place Eve believes Satan's lie see and received it into the womb of her mind and that polluted her soul and set death in the soul then the natural Act take place ain't that right but notice then we find brother Brown talking about Mary how of her physical mind was the womb ain't that right it was the physical womb of uh a virgin wound her her physical mind was the Virgin womb why because she believed everybody say she believed she believed God's word regardless of what anybody else said she believes regardless of how impossible it was she believed regardless whether whether uh uh the preacher believed it whether Joseph believed it whether the the Deacon believed it she just believed it because her mind was virgin wound can you say mine brother Brown said see first it was her mind he says before the act ever taken place in her literal womb the ACT took place in here first see to let the script or the Spirit come in to do the rest of the work before the actual spiritual birth can take place the word has to find itself through your mind to believe it and you say Amen now if you notice the word the word because he says I'm going to lay the word out for you to ride through I'm I'm laying that word so see the word is important ain't that right the word is important and the word came to both Eve and Mary two women came came to both and Satan's lie came to both women as well Eve chose to receive Satan's lie she received his lie into her mind ain't that right but Mary chose to receive the word into her mind the word of God into her mind now the prophet said that Satan came to her just as well you know it can't happen you know what they're going to say you know how ridiculed they're gonna they're gonna laugh at you they're gonna make fun of you you know that can never happen when has it ever happened he came to her in her reasoning but she cast it all aside and accepted the word of God ain't that right now you're going to receive something in your mind ain't that right you're going to receive something in your mind and and there's no way of getting around it there's going to be meditation of your mind and and you're gonna think on things I I don't care what it is what you watch you're gonna think on it what you listen to you're going to think on it tonight you're going to think on things ain't that right what you've seen you're going to think on it what you've heard what what whatever it's going to enter and you're going to have uh uh the meditation now God gave Adam and Eve his word for them to meditate upon you believe that and not only just to meditate on but to speak it and his word was meant to bring life to them life upon the Earth ain't that right she was to receive the word and it was to prosper Eve wants to receive that word and it was to prosper can you say Amen remember there was no other word given to them until Satan came along Satan would enter into that Serpent and begin to tell his lies to Eve Satan's lies had no power over her Satan's lies had no dictate over her ain't that right Satan's lies Could Do no harm to her that's true he was only just giving them to her he was only just tell it he was only just speaking but what did Brother Brown say she stopped to listen to him and she began to reason with it and remember he was twisting that word up just enough to get her attention ain't that right now the problem was she was already lusting for something greater that's what the prophet said she was looking for no more light and Satan was promising her more light and it caused her to stop and to listen ain't that right see but it could have done her no harm until she listened and then she received it ain't that right now today you've not only got the word but you got Satan's lie that's the battles we battle ain't that right go through the battles amen you've got we've got God's word and we have Satan's lie remember in second Thessalonians 2 9. uh through 12 it says even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and line wanders with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved for this cause now notice the truth would have saved them do you believe that the truth would have saved him and the word is truth God sent a prophet to save the people can you say amen that's right he knew what was coming just as he knew he was going to destroy the Earth but he sent a prophet to make a preparation and it was only eight that he come toward but that was enough and if it was just one for this day God would have still done it but he didn't waste time to send a prophet he sent a prophet for a reason can you say Amen now and so we find that with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved for this calls God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe alive brother Brown said velai ain't that right the same lie that was Satan presented to Eve it's the same lie he's done today amen see that they might all be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness now I'm telling you amen for a believer that believes the truth he cannot be damned he cannot be destroyed he cannot be cursed he cannot be amen Satan can't have no power over him ain't that right it's to them that has not a love for the truth they might believe not the truth then God sends a lie to them now that lie Satan Satan torments our minds you know because the Battleground is in the mind ain't that right but now listen the truth is presented and the LIE is presented God presents his truth and he's more record by Vindication that it's the truth and then Satan brings his own lies ain't that right but now what does God's word tell us because now we're talking about every individual here what does God tell us as individuals cast down everybody say cast down every imagination do you have the power to cast them down yes you do have that power God's word God's word eve had the power to cast it down but she didn't do it but you have the power to cast it down the same word that came to Eve has come to us it's been restored to us can you say Amen this message this this message did not come mixed up amen with all kinds of ideas and all that is the perfect word perfect interpretation can you say Amen now that word tells us to cast down every imagination don't you sit there and say well I just can't do it I just don't know I just you've got the power with the word of God and the and he says cast down every imagination and the high thing that exalteth itself above the knowledge of God or the word of God right the knowledge of God the word of God that's right and then as we've we've quoted the script or read the scripture before read it again that we're told to think upon things that are true think about things that are honest think about things that are just think about things that are pure think about things that are lovely think about things that have a good report can you say Amen now why because that come from God's word Satan's lie is not honest Satan's lie does not have just in it there's nothing about Satan's lie that God tells you to think about then lies you've got to cast out cast down can you say Amen how do you cast down the word gives you the authority to do so yeah why you're gonna ride through this thing right to it why because they're going to be people that spot wrinkle or blemish and we ain't like the Baptist that now now you have to excuse me here but but we're not like the Baptist say well God you know God save me and I'm good and so and then we just live oh like a hell hole our house is just a hell trap hello I don't believe that I understand we got weaknesses and I understand we fall and I understand these things but I believe there's a power I believe there's a power power to write through this thing unscathed that we will overcome and the brother said God ain't going to overcome for you you've got to overcome yourself he gave you the ability to overcome he should have overcome that serpent but she didn't but Mary overcame it can you say man why eve took the devil's life Mary took God's word and now it's presented to us again can you say Amen that God would send a prophet amen with the word amen to help us to ride through it you can ride through this thing I know we got that internet pornography is so easy but you can ride through it I know this is the age of adultery and and and husbands wives you know God they they got people on the side and Honey Buns on the side but you can ride through it you understand what I'm saying you can be faithful you you you can live holy you can live righteous you don't have to be they're stuck in the muck of this world even Peter said we've escaped the corruption that is in this world through lusts see you can ride through this thing [Applause] you believe it goes on to say we are to think on things that have virtue think on things that have praise another place that says let God's word be true and every man alive let God's word be true so you build your thoughts on God's word you build your meditation upon God's word ain't that right sure you're going to have all kinds of thoughts that come into your mind but why how you receive them all right amen come on now did not what what did Jesus say a sweet water and bitter water can't come from the same fountain so you you can't have victory you we can't have Victory meditating on negative thoughts and meditating on on the word of God meditating on this and meditating on that things that are contradicting one another so we have to we we have to make that decision as to what we are I'm a shout of God then what does that mean to be a child of God well I go to church devil goes to church well I believe in the message what does the message do for you then that's wonderful you believe the message can you imagine many people don't have the truth oh wow I thought of that you know where Terry just the thinking how blessed I am amen I could have been raised in a home that all it was was just a television going on I could have been raised in a home when it was just parents playing rock and roll music these children could be raised in homes that all it is is just smoking cigarettes and they don't know nothing else but that's right but here we have the truth we literally have truth to help us right through this thing I hope it's a help to you God's word is truth and if I can tell you young people really take seriousness about your life right now I know you might be young and some of you might be just just coming into teenage years I've got a young boy I've got a boy coming into teenage years and ah you know I've already raised two boys and I understand the things that they were going through and now it's it's showing here and as a dad I had to cry sometimes said God is in God have mercy but you know what I I thought y'all I'm so glad that I can come to you as a father foreign I know there's temptations there I know it but I I steal into him son there's a word for you there's times that I'll hear him you know playing playing the message in a room it's not that oh God let that word stick why would God do it for us I don't know it's just his grace it's his Mercy what if as a father I didn't have no way to help him they'll go see a psychologist son or well it's just the norm these days but it don't have to be the norm there's a word that helps us ride through these things and and and it'll help you with you teenage years it'll help you in your adult Years it'll help you I thought of brother Walker there that is just suffering with with things and and I know the discouragement's there I know the Mind battles that he's going through but every time I go visit him he's not talking about all that he's talking about the word of God he's talking about the message he's talking about how good God is why there's a word that's helping him right through this thing there's a word that helps you can sit there and meditate upon all the negatives but he chooses to take the word of God as the positive and it helps him ride through it you see God's word is the only positive thing that there is the only thing that has virtue it's the only thing that has a good report you believe that Psalms 119 97 little lengthy but it says oh how I love thy law you love it what is his law his word that's what he's saying how I Love Thy Word now that's got to be settled in US I love that word we can see the importance of the word of God and how it's our life it's our it's our refuge it's it's everything that we have need of now notice what he says it is my meditation all the day through thy Commandments Thy Word has thou through thy Commandments Thy Thy Word in other words has made me wiser than mine enemies for they are forever with me can you say Amen see he's going to teach us how to ride through things I I have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies which is his word are my meditation I understand more than the Ancients because I have kept for I keep by precepts by word I have refrained my feet from every evil way that I might keep thy word I have not departed from my judgments for thou has taught me how sweet are thy words under my taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth through thy precepts Thy word I get understanding therefore I hate every false way Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path ain't that right then you go Psalms 119 11 Thy word notice I put Thy word have I hid Thy word have I hid in my heart now I that I might not sin against thee so this is the important thing it's not God hiding the word he hides it now I think that's important it starts with our thoughts and I'm not going to keep you much longer but it starts with our thoughts meditation and and and and please keep this remember that I'm not addressing a people who are unconverted I'm not as the world that is trying to bring on a millennium without repentance I'm not trying to make better people without them having a new birth this is no way in any way trying to bring Reformation but the word is for those who are predestinated to catch it ain't that right you remember we've talked about David speaking of the man in in the first chapter of Psalms where he said you know he shall be as a tree planted by the rivers of water and and brother Brown said see he's planted not set out transposed from this to that he is predestinated to be there right he is predestinated so David is showing us that he's predestining he's showing what a predestinated man does all right Thy word have I hid in my heart it went from here all the way down into the soul and you say man if the word stays in your intellect Satan can take that word out is that right Betty let that word get down to the soul to where Satan couldn't take it out brother Brown said he's predestined to be there that thought of God before the foundation World placed him there not stuck out not by chance but was planted predestinated ain't that right he is predestinated to be there not just by chance he noticed he was predestinated to catch that word when it was sold now you might hear it intellectually naturally it might be your body that your five senses will well we'll catch it there then it comes into your spirit to where you start reasoning it out and if you're not careful Satan will start using that you mishear it or you'll start reasoning it all right and you say amen he comes to you and starts working on you and messing that word and all that but you've got to let it drop down into that soul because see if you're predestinated then you're predestinated to catch that where not intellectually but it comes down into the soul that's right that's that word see God wouldn't have said behold a virgin shall conceive if there was nobody to catch the word in that season Prophet said he wouldn't have given the last commission to the church if there was no one to catch the word can you say man see he wouldn't have said the works I do shall you do even greater see if there was nobody to catch that word see thank God for the word thank God for the promises every one of them are positive it says you will overcome it says there will be a bride without spot wrinkle or bleming that somebody got to catch the word ain't that right and so but he would say that he would say these promises he would tell us about what belongs to us because he knew you would be able to catch it you'd catch that word predestinated to it so you're not living in this age by coincidence don't just go through this age don't go through life just just hum drum act as if well nothing's happening and I believe she's just floating by no no no no you got to catch the word and God knew you would catch the word that's why I sent you that's why you're here for the message of the hour ain't that right see he knew you wouldn't be just be intellectual with it but you would catch it and it would get down into that soul and it would actually prosper ain't that right see you're predestinated to be here God had a word for this age to be fulfilled ain't that right he said there's going to be a rapture we are in that Rapture age well how's there going to be arriving you know how there's going to be a Rapture in this age because there's somebody to catch that word true Paul talked about the manifestation of the sons of God do you know why he would do that because somebody would catch the word in the season and this is the season Now by being predestinated to catch the word then you have the ability to discern what is of God and what is of the devil now brother random says you hear so much today about positive thinking you just put your mind on anything and think positive on it the devil can do that so we're not we're not talking about positive thinking as the world would he said the devil can do that there's only one thing that rules overall and that's God's word ain't that right and if you're thinking contrary to the word forget your thinking think on the word ain't that right when the five senses of your body starts going contrary to the word forget it stay with the word when the five senses of your spirit your reasoning your affection your conscience your memory and all that starts to stray and amen from the word of God bring it back into subjection is that right so now positive thinking is taught to all kinds of people because it bypasses the supernatural birth amen it's a human effort to make Man Superior without the word of God and psychology is the same thing it bypasses the supernatural it deals with the human mind but when it comes to the word and understanding it and receiving it well you know they cannot do that they only get an intellectual conception of the word right Jesus Judas had a mental conception of what Jesus was saying and who Jesus was but that's as far as it went he couldn't understand the ministry of Jesus couldn't understand what he was all about couldn't understand anything and and Jesus was the word ain't that right he couldn't catch that word did you even go back into Cain he had intellectual conception of God that he couldn't catch the word ain't that right so Judas intellectually he heard what the other disciples were hearing he saw what the other disciples were seeing and he believed it in his mind but in his heart he didn't believe it yeah you're just gonna believe it in your mind you better be careful because Satan will mess with your mind the word cannot remain cannot be planted in you just in your mind it's got to drop ain't that right I hope it's all right but so he couldn't catch the meaning of what it was all about but notice what the prophet said but the real ordained of God that real Gene that real germ a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world remember you that's really got the spirit of God in you tonight you were here in Christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he said do you believe that look he was in Christ then if you were in God a gene a word an attribute from the beginning then you walk with him here on Earth you talked with him on Earth you suffered with him on Earth you died with him at Calvary you Rose with him again and now you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus communing with him the word as it feeds into your soul that man shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God ain't that right as we try to close it's the soul is that counts that's so that you have is either a gene seed or it's not is either before the foundation of the world or it's not and we know what the soul controls the spirit the spirit controls the body but the soul is where the domain the soul is where the domain is ain't that right you believe that not your body not your spirit your soul is where the domain that's right see and so whatever is in the soul would determine what you do with the thoughts that come in your mind amen again we talk of the five senses of the body taste feel hear smell and seed and there's the five the spirit has the five gates of memory affection reasoning conscience and Imagination and what is a gate it's an entrance it's it's an entrance to something I looked at it Webster says it is a door a valve or other device for controlling the passage right so the body has five entrances the spirit has five entrances see but when it comes to the soul the prophet said there's only one Avenue to it and that's free moral agency you can accept doubt or you can accept Faith either one you want to work on see therefore Satan began at the principal part to cause the spirit of man to doubt God's word god began at the principal part to lay his word into that Spirit ain't that right so there you are that's what does it now you we we all know in 1953 is what when he said that and and brother Branham taught that we were Body Soul in spirit and but later on in his ministry he corrects it and says we are Body Spirit and soul ain't that right and so so so what you see what you taste hear smell uh whatever these five senses of the body actually is a gate it it it it it it can affect a man the the inner man your spirit man because it what what you see amen then it comes into your memory or it comes into what you hear then it becomes into you can re then you start reasoning out in your spirit ain't that right that now now and if I can get this uh uh to you clearly amen see uh uh but in order for it to get down into your soul you have to receive it come on now how many people saw they they saw the the the the supernatural Saul why did not they why didn't they believe it they saw it there's people that testified that saw that Pillar of Fire it's all the angel yet they didn't they didn't accept it because they saw it and time it got to into their Spirit they began to reason it reasoning and they explained allowed the devil to explain it away hello and they never received it see so you're a free moral agent and and there's again there's only one gate to the soul and that's either Faith or doubt and brother Brown said it all depends as to what kind of nature the soul is so you're either going to believe it or you'll reject it ain't that right and so what you are in your soul is what counts yeah you you can be affected in this body by by the five by the five senses you you can be affected a man in the in the in by the five senses of the spirit and Satan can control all all of them Satan has his way with them all but then you have the power to reject it or to accept it you have the power to cast it down or to meditate on it you love the Lord Amen brother Branham says the devil can get into these five senses and lie to you he said but he cannot touch that super sense which is faith it's far beyond his reach for it came from God that's why your physical being you could you could be blind deaf dumb whatever or or whatever you could be affected uh by diseases or whatever and then Satan can come into that reasoning and say look how long you've been sick God doesn't love you God doesn't heal God doesn't this and God doesn't that if God loved you you wouldn't be the Way You Are right well you must have done something wrong or you you must not have faith right what is it you're feeling the symptoms and Satan's working on it but if you're a Believer you disregard all of that and you count every symptom as a lie just as Mary did you can be as an eve that accepts the LIE or you can be as a Mary but there's a people that's a Mary in this age and God did not promise us a Bed of Roses he did not promise us a life of ease ain't that right you're going to go through your hell you're going to go through your pain you're going to go through whatever but it proven that you're a son of God oh I I love him now brother Brown said see the five senses does not control the sixth sense but the Sixth Sense controls the five senses the super sense controls the natural senses the five senses the states feel he'll uh hear smell and uh uh see he says see the the super sense is something that'll make you believe God's word but where's the Super sense down in the soul it'll make you believe God's word whether you see it or not it'll make you believe it ain't that right you might have every reason to reason it away but that Sixth Sense down in that soul will make you believe it regardless it'll make you believe for things that you cannot see taste feel smell or hear because it'll take God's word and it will deliver that word to you and make you walk contrary to any other thing there is but God's word by faith faith does it can you say Amen oh do you love him isn't he wonderful so here Eve heard the word of God and she said okay that sounds good intellectually she heard it but that's as far as it went then Satan began to take that word and begin to reason with her work on that reasoning reason and see and she listened to it against God's word and by that she accepted Satan's lie over God's word ain't that right and you would think you you you would think that everyone that sees the supernatural would believe it but that's not the case God sends preachers to preach his word faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word God performs the supernatural so that men can see it with their own eyes right then it enters into the five one of the five gates of the of the spirit if we can say it that way but it never gets into the soul as we get ready to close now brother Brown said you got five senses that controls the body you got five senses that controls uh of the spirit conscience and so forth he said your body there's a seed taste feel smell in here but there's only one channel to the inside of that soul to show uh that shows that you are a seed your soul body experiency and then one channel Avenue one way into that your free moral agency that is you can receive it or reject it you do whatever you want to therefore Eve was on the same basis she could take God's word and and said God said not to do it get away from here and that would have been all right but instead of that she tried to hybrid it with Satan's lie and it brought death but when it come to Mary it was different behold the hands maiden of the Lord how's it going to be that doesn't matter it's going to be anyhow you have spoke it it's the word of God I receive it behold the hands made of the Lord be it unto me even as thy word see there it was that settled it she was all right then she brought forth that germ of Life which was the word of God made manifest in a form of a man and through death of that one just paid death the death and the debt for every one of us that's unjust and by accepting then his word brings life and brings Christ back in us because Christ is the word the spoken word and it will mature if you can receive it you that sick accept it believe it no matter what it's got to mature and we'll come forth in its season it's got to oh do you love him oh praise the Lord that the musicians will come I pray he had some sin made some sense to you today I am going to read this here because it did not stay in Mary's intellect but it went into the soul she heard it but didn't walk away and allowed Satan take it from her she received it down inside she was predestinated to catch that word and she meditated her meditation was upon the word her confession was the word right there's other people that probably said well how can that be even Joseph even questioned it there but yet she wouldn't listen to it right now brother Branham says this and I want you to listen now he said now this outside man is the Flesh and that's what we look at what we see and it has five inlets to that body any grammar school child as myself would know there is five senses that control the body see taste feel hear smell and so he says without that without them senses you can't touch the body that's the only way you have uh that's the only way you have to the body see taste feel smell here you see it taste it feel it and that is the evil one on the outside now inside of that is a spirit which you become when you're born in the Earth and the Breath of Life is breathing to him that spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God but it was permitted by God now you got that every child that's born in the world is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that right so that person inside there is a sinner to begin with it's got five inlets see I don't know whether he said I can count them off but he said conscience and reasoning and things he said there's five inlets to the spirit you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental factualities at all your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit see you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being because reason don't see taste feel smell or hear reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or or you're out your body is lying there dead but your spirits can steal reasons see so there's five senses that control that Inside Man now to the last man which is the soul there is only one sense that controls that and that is free moral agency free will to choose or to reject now now the reason that people is don't forget this you'll see he says now people can live in the spirit they can dance in the spirit shout in the spirit go to church in the spirit and they can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointed on that Spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be with that spirit because watch that's the reason you couldn't tell that woman wearing shorts was wrong you couldn't tell her bobbing her hair was wrong well what what's your hair Got to Do With It see she's starting to reason with that well uh he did the Samson see well whosoever shall add one word to this or take one word from it you've got to have an ultimate somewhere for instances if I was a Baptist man you come down and told me I must be baptized in Jesus name it's in the Bible well the first thing you'd know I'd say I'll ask my pastor I go to the pastor he says oh that's something back Yonder yeah we Baptist here's what we believe we believe that we should be in immersed in titles Father Son and Holy Ghost that's all the way the church has done it see since John Smith found it and that's the way it's done well see that's your ultimate heck with that guy you know with what that guy says see well it what if you're a Methodist and sprinkling is your system and and you are told that you must be immersed see what I mean you go back to the Methodist Pastor he'll write and ask the bishop and it's sold and so and so and so said about this see well but we the Methodist Church we was founded three or four hundred years ago in England by John Wesleyan Whitfield and Dad see we founded this document following John Wesley that we are to be sprinkled and see because it's just an outward in form emotion form and we think sprinkling is just as good as it is any other way if you're It is Well if the Methodist Church is your automation that's as far as it you can go see the word stops right he said if you're Catholic same thing not you know it's in the you know I'll tell you it's not in the Bible not to eat meat on Fridays and all those things like this that Holy Eucharist isn't a wafer because it's a spirit and so forth you go to your priest the priest says here it is room right in our documents see well if the church is your ultimate you don't give a hoot what anybody says that's your ultimate oh God he's says help this to sink into me the whole thing is wrong God's word is the ultimate whatever that word says then that's right and now the only way up here in the Spheres that you could ever be in this little Inside Man you have to be predestined for ordained because you was with God you were a part of God can you say amen that's right see so we find he says he never came to save the devil's children they will never know it they are so shrewd in their ways of their intellectual learning that you cannot compare with them at all you cannot out talk to them at all but by faith you see it can't explain it but the word is able to get past your your five senses of the body your five sins of the spirit and it drops down into the soul and the faith controls your body it controls your spirit it whatever is in that Soul controls can you say man I am the Lord wonderful [Music] brother Ram talks about in Africa he says I go in Africa and one they see one Miracle one Supernatural sign and the people flock thousands he said but it doesn't work in America he said I come to American he said man he says or he talks about Africa he says you know he says tell person what was wrong or something like that every person would do just exactly what you told them to do and if they were laying Twisted bound up they'd be wiggling and trying their best to get off that cough they do they they'd keep doing it until they could get up and do it no defeat with them there they said America it never works he said because there's so much teaching in America so much different teachings until everyone has their own idea and they say well my pastor said that that man was a spiritualist well then that settles it with you see the word could never come into their soul and have an effect and oh you say well I don't believe that now brother Branham he spent way down in that subconscious it's still there you usually move by your subconscience and you say amen and that's where we got to get that t that that that subconscious got to be clean to where God can move in that subconscious that's right and he and he goes on down I'll get down to it later but he says see you can say oh I believe it I believe it yes sir I believe it but down then in that subconscious if there's a doctrine that you've been taught that is against that it throws that out because you hold on to that Doctrine you hold to that teaching and that's why so many people called what God done this day of the devil they called it BLS above because their Pastor taught them that because the pope taught him that because some bishop or the church taught that well the days of Miracles and as I've told you I've talked to that one gentleman that that told me that March 16 was not inspired and that God does not do Miracles today amen and I tried to tell that man I showed him I told him my daughter I said look I said this is my daughter Anne and and I said she was born I got proof that that she didn't have a hip socket in in when she was born and and and God created a hip socket just uh days later and and I got the proof of that and and and wouldn't believe it why because the church became his absolute but I'm so glad we've come out of her my people we've come out so that the word can have an effect I hope it's helped you God bless you is our prayer amen what song give me the
