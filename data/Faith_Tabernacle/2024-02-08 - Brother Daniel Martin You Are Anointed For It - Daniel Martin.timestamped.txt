[46:10] Samuel amen I'm not going to promise you
[46:13] anything but I'm going to try not to
[46:14] keep you long tonight I know it's a
[46:16] Wednesday
[46:17] night but 1 Samuel
[46:24] 17
[46:33] 1 Samuel
[46:35] 17:31 and it says and when the words
[46:37] were heard which David spake they
[46:40] rehearsed them before Saul and he sent
[46:43] for him and David said to Saul let no
[46:46] man's heart fail because of him thy
[46:48] servant will go and fight with this
[46:51] Philistine and Saul said to David thou
[46:54] are not able to go against this Phil to
[46:56] fight with him for thou are but a youth
[46:58] and a man uh and he a man of war from
[47:01] his Youth and David said unto Saul thy
[47:04] servant kept his father's sheep and
[47:07] there came a lion and a bear and took a
[47:09] lamb out of the flock and I went after
[47:12] him and smokee him and delivered it out
[47:16] of his mouth and when he arose against
[47:18] me I caught him by his beard and I smote
[47:21] him and slew him thy servant slew both
[47:24] The Lion and the Bear and this
[47:26] uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one
[47:28] of them seeing he hath defied the armies
[47:31] of the Living God David said moreover
[47:35] the Lord that delivered me out of the
[47:37] Paw of the lion and out of the Paw of
[47:40] the bear he will deliver me out of the
[47:43] hand of this Philistine amen you can be
[47:47] seated amen if I were to um give a title
[47:52] uh tonight I would like to maybe title
[47:54] it U you you were anointed for it and um
[47:59] so we see that David was a man after
[48:02] God's Own Heart and uh you know David uh
[48:06] was positionally he was POS positionally
[48:09] born by election and uh he was born
[48:12] elected as a servant of God Amen and
[48:15] when he was a little boy Israel had
[48:18] during that time had gotten away from
[48:21] God and uh they went out and chose them
[48:25] self a king uh they wanted to act
[48:28] brother brandham says they wanted to act
[48:30] like the rest of the
[48:31] Nations um they and U God was their King
[48:36] but they wanted to act like the rest of
[48:37] the people the hats when they got in
[48:39] trouble brother brandham said and they
[48:41] tried to be something they wasn't and
[48:43] whenever you're trying to impersonate
[48:45] someone else you can always expect
[48:47] trouble to be with there with you amen
[48:50] and if Israel had just stayed in that
[48:54] condition uh but they said well now
[48:56] looky here the rest of the Nations has
[48:58] got a king so why can't we have a king
[49:01] brother brandham says that's what the
[49:03] Pentecostal people thought well the rest
[49:06] of the churches they got all their show
[49:08] they go to the shows and their women
[49:10] they cut their hair and they wear their
[49:11] short dresses and they say they're
[49:14] Christians why can't we and uh brother
[49:17] brandham says an old Methodist preacher
[49:19] used to sing we let down the bars we
[49:21] compromised with sin we let down the
[49:23] bars and the Sheep got out but how did
[49:26] the goats get in because you let down
[49:28] the bars amen and now Israel wanted to
[49:32] impersonate uh other people and that's
[49:34] what the church wants to do is to
[49:37] impersonate uh um and become a b and
[49:40] become a uh backsliding condition they
[49:43] wanted to become something they wasn't
[49:46] and uh um and they got them um and and
[49:51] in this condition they they said what
[49:53] what do they do and and they got them a
[49:55] king and when they did they found the
[49:57] biggest most handsome man they could
[50:00] find great big seven-footer with black
[50:03] shaggy hair and dark sparkling eyes that
[50:06] would uh that would be attractive to the
[50:08] people and they thought well he would
[50:10] make a wonderful King and as God said to
[50:13] Samuel man lookth on the outward
[50:16] appearance but God lookth to the heart
[50:19] amen so when Israel selected their King
[50:22] they wanted a great big handsome strongl
[50:24] looking fellow
[50:25] with great big shoulders that could
[50:27] stand straight stand Head and Shoulders
[50:31] above all of his army and when God
[50:34] selected his King for them when God
[50:36] selected a king he was a little old
[50:38] Ruddy fellow he was a little sapling
[50:41] looking kind of fellow like uh look like
[50:43] he a little brother brandham said
[50:46] and that's what God's pick uh of it was
[50:50] and what a difference that is why while
[50:52] everyone was looking for someone that
[50:54] looked handsome and
[50:56] strong and big built and uh goodlooking
[50:59] good uh looking to the eye but God chose
[51:02] someone else God had a decision and his
[51:05] decision was something that just that
[51:07] that anyone would just throw away no one
[51:09] would want on them on his team you know
[51:12] when uh uh sometimes when we play sports
[51:14] or something or volleyball or something
[51:16] with the church we want to pick the best
[51:18] cuz we want to win so we want someone
[51:20] who knows how to just do it just right
[51:22] right and so when they chose their King
[51:24] they wanted someone who knew how to
[51:26] fight they wanted someone who knew uh
[51:28] their uh uh knew who was very skilled
[51:31] and they also wanted someone that had
[51:33] the looks amen and they see seen how
[51:36] tall he was and they said wow what a man
[51:39] well this guy would be good for a king
[51:41] and uh so uh you know and but God when
[51:45] he chose a king he didn't want someone
[51:48] that just looked pretty to the eyes but
[51:50] he looked at David's heart he said this
[51:52] is the man after my own heart amen man
[51:55] and the doctor will say you know well
[51:57] you're going to die with cancer you'll
[51:59] never recover well that's the doctor's
[52:01] opinion and he's looking it as from a
[52:04] medical standpoint but see God's
[52:06] standpoint is I'm the Lord that Health
[52:09] thee amen one looks at it from one way
[52:12] the other looks at it from another way
[52:14] and looks at it from wisdom sense and
[52:16] the other looks at it from a spiritual
[52:18] sense amen so it's just uh it's just
[52:22] whichever way you base your faith right
[52:24] amen if the doctor says it and it's
[52:27] finished and you believe that then that
[52:28] settles it that's all you're going to
[52:30] receive that's all you're going to get
[52:32] but if the doctor says it's finished and
[52:35] you don't believe it because God said
[52:37] something different Watch What Happens
[52:40] and see just depends on which way you
[52:42] Let Yourself Go amen who you yield your
[52:45] members to that's whose servants you are
[52:49] amen now Saul when he was chosen a great
[52:52] fellow fine looking strapping uh
[52:55] straight shoulder oh great Head and
[52:57] Shoulder above the his whole army they
[53:00] said that's our King and that uh and
[53:02] what did it lead them to it finally LED
[53:05] them to a backslid condition their King
[53:09] backslid my and now when God sees that
[53:12] their choice was no good God went to
[53:15] choose himself a king amen so he told
[53:18] Samuel he said fill up the horn with oil
[53:21] and go out to Jesse and call uh uh his
[53:24] sons up and I'll tell you who I have
[53:26] chosen to be king amen so uh Samuel went
[53:30] out there and Jesse thought too like
[53:33] Samuel rather the oldest one of them
[53:35] would would come out and this great big
[53:37] fine young fellow a big strapping
[53:40] looking fellow he said this is the one
[53:42] that will be king So when Samuel went
[53:44] out he asked Jesse said bring out your
[53:47] sons I'd like to see them all and one by
[53:49] one you know they all just just tall
[53:51] they just all just just handsome looking
[53:54] and and and
[53:55] and Jesse and and Samuel said well
[53:57] surely this is the one surely this is
[53:59] the one to be king and that's what
[54:02] happened to the world today they have
[54:04] turned down a real simple Gospel of
[54:07] Jesus Christ and went out for something
[54:09] great scholarly uh educated and smart
[54:12] and shrewd that studied psychology and
[54:15] got bachelor's degree and all them other
[54:17] things and it's gotten us to a place how
[54:20] we want big things oh man we want to we
[54:23] want to go to the biggest church there
[54:24] is in the city we want to uh we only say
[54:28] Amen to our favorite preacher you know
[54:31] and and we want the biggest church and
[54:34] and many times just exactly like Israel
[54:36] did when they chose Saul Head and
[54:38] Shoulders above everything else you know
[54:40] that's the way you get in trouble right
[54:44] amen when you start looking at the big
[54:47] things when you start looking at your at
[54:49] your wealth when you start looking at
[54:50] the fine things of the world that's when
[54:53] you're going to get in trouble amen but
[54:56] the very principle that he set for us to
[54:58] do we've let down and took secondarily
[55:01] my we have built great hospitals schools
[55:04] and great places and seminars and and
[55:07] educated our preachers to make them so
[55:09] they can speak with fine swell words and
[55:12] use psychology and what has it gotten us
[55:15] a great big bunch of backsliding people
[55:18] hey man nothing but a backsliding people
[55:22] my amen and uh so when uh sorry my uh my
[55:29] notes so when Saul went to Samuel went
[55:33] out to choose them a king you know uh he
[55:36] wanted the great big things he was
[55:39] looking at at the great uh uh at what uh
[55:44] of what he thought would be king I mean
[55:47] you know Saul Saul was great big and
[55:49] handsome you know so so he was like well
[55:52] you know surely this is what we're going
[55:53] to have to do you know we'll just take
[55:55] another big handsome fellow you know and
[55:58] uh um but see and it's but it's gotten
[56:01] us back to a bunch sliding people amen
[56:05] satisfied with just God sending a
[56:06] prophet people are just satisfied with
[56:08] just God sending a prophet they're just
[56:10] satisfied with going to church and being
[56:12] a bench warmer can you imagine people
[56:14] are just satisfied at just sitting in
[56:16] the on a bench and just coming in
[56:18] warming up the bench and then when
[56:19] service is over well you know they they
[56:21] they they they just kept the bench warm
[56:24] you know and
[56:26] and satisfied with just justification
[56:28] satisfied with just sanctification but
[56:30] never come into the baptism of the Holy
[56:33] Ghost my you know uh well God God God
[56:38] just don't do that them things no more
[56:40] amen let me tell you something he's the
[56:42] same yesterday as he was today and he
[56:45] will be the same forever amen if he can
[56:48] feel me with the Holy Ghost he can feel
[56:50] brother Amos and if he can feel brother
[56:52] Amos he can feel brother Bill he can do
[56:54] the same for sister Faith for brother
[56:56] shemiah amen our God is the same
[56:59] yesterday today and forever amen my God
[57:02] will never fail amen God told Samuel
[57:06] said get a cruise of oil and go out
[57:08] there and I'll tell you who to anoint
[57:10] well Jesse come out there and brought
[57:12] his eldest son out which is the great uh
[57:15] which is a great big six-footer or
[57:16] better said that's the one to be king
[57:19] and he passed by Samuel got the uh old
[57:22] cruise and said surely that's him
[57:25] and and when when he passed by God said
[57:28] no that's not him I've refused him he uh
[57:32] my he said well this fellow is nearly
[57:34] his size we'll bring him out he's a big
[57:37] handsome looking fellow he's he looks
[57:39] good with the crown he'll look good with
[57:40] the crown setting on his head and on his
[57:43] side of his head with a new suit on and
[57:45] how you uh uh how look to stand before
[57:48] the people and that's the way the people
[57:50] judges their pastors today brother
[57:52] brandham says what a shame you know and
[57:54] and so when he passed by Samuel got his
[57:56] Cruise of oil and run out to pour it on
[57:58] him and he said don't receive him I've
[58:01] refused him and he kept on bringing them
[58:03] out until he got down to the seventh one
[58:06] that was it and Samuel said well is this
[58:08] all you got is this all you got and
[58:10] Jesse said no I've got I've got one
[58:14] more we're not going to sit down till we
[58:17] go get them so they went back there and
[58:20] and I can see them brother Bram says now
[58:22] some of them with a great discouraged
[58:24] look on their face thinking well surely
[58:26] that wouldn't be the King David come
[58:28] running you know little old Shaggy
[58:30] little little boy come running
[58:32] down and then Jesse says well that's him
[58:35] right there he's he's my last one Samuel
[58:37] well surely he's not going to be the
[58:39] king surely not surely God hasn't chosen
[58:42] him why he's just he's puny he's little
[58:45] well he ain't worth but he can probably
[58:46] barely handle a sword you know notice uh
[58:50] brother BR says I can see David then
[58:53] here he comes running in with a Little
[58:54] Shepherd's coat on made out of sheep
[58:57] skin perhaps he runs in a a little old
[58:59] looking boy the Bible said he was
[59:01] ready and he wasn't nothing but just a
[59:03] little old spinley fellow kind of a
[59:05] little Fair Lookout little B old
[59:07] fellow running there and the Holy Ghost
[59:09] come upon the prophet and said pour the
[59:11] oil on his head I've chose him what a
[59:14] disappointment it was to them people
[59:16] standing there expecting these big men
[59:19] these big handsome strong looking
[59:20] fellows to be the king but he poured the
[59:23] oil on little old David's head and from
[59:26] that day the Holy Spirit was with David
[59:28] and God chose
[59:31] him and God was with
[59:34] David heyen see the world has chosen
[59:37] their soul to be king they chose their
[59:40] money amen but Rapture ain't going to
[59:42] get you or money ain't going to get you
[59:43] in the Rapture amen they they uh I seen
[59:47] this video the other day uh this this
[59:50] preacher got on there and he this was a
[59:53] legit video he gets on there before his
[59:55] people and he says the reason why the
[59:57] Rapture ain't happened yet is because
[59:59] you guys ain't given
[1:00:02] enough I just that blew my mind see
[1:00:06] they're just focused on their money
[1:00:07] that's all they're not worried about the
[1:00:09] people they just they just build the big
[1:00:11] churches so they can get more people in
[1:00:13] to pay more ties my the world chose
[1:00:16] their big churches they chose their fine
[1:00:18] speakers who spent years in a seminar
[1:00:21] they judge a a preacher by uh how many
[1:00:23] title he can you believe that well this
[1:00:26] preacher has PhD has his PhD and this
[1:00:29] one went to the Bible College and went
[1:00:31] to seminar and that one while he must be
[1:00:34] a real man of God
[1:00:36] Amen but when what has it done it's put
[1:00:40] the people in a backsliding condition
[1:00:43] they're trying to get the people to
[1:00:44] Christ by porting them to a social clubs
[1:00:47] trying to hold the young people by
[1:00:48] bringing in the uh the games in the
[1:00:50] church holding them to traditions and
[1:00:53] well uh it's been taught for many years
[1:00:55] why change it now amen Christ don't
[1:00:58] identify himself with Traditions God
[1:01:01] don't identify himself with video games
[1:01:04] God don't identify himself with show
[1:01:06] Social Clubs and
[1:01:08] formalities amen Christ is the word he
[1:01:11] identifies himself with the
[1:01:14] word amen do you believe
[1:01:17] that amen Christ is the word brother
[1:01:20] Bram says that the angel of the Lord
[1:01:23] accompanies this message Jo alwayss that
[1:01:25] is why we believe this message that is
[1:01:28] why we stand on this
[1:01:30] message
[1:01:31] amen preachers want to try and separate
[1:01:34] Christ with Christ in the message they
[1:01:37] want to try to separate the two well
[1:01:39] they say well we'll get them to a
[1:01:40] Baptist idea and then bring him to
[1:01:42] Christ it don't work oh it don't work
[1:01:46] you can't do it Christ in the message is
[1:01:48] one amen you want to start seeing God
[1:01:51] move in your life get under the message
[1:01:54] you want to see God move in your homes
[1:01:56] get under the message you want to see
[1:01:58] God move on your on your job site get
[1:02:01] under the message amen this message is
[1:02:04] life to
[1:02:05] us
[1:02:07] amen God accompanies this message
[1:02:11] always God Amen the people forsook God
[1:02:14] and forsook their King and chose a man
[1:02:16] to lead them and Saul LED them into a
[1:02:19] backsliding condition so God said I will
[1:02:22] choose a king I will do the choosing for
[1:02:24] this this time so what did he choose he
[1:02:26] chose a man after his own heart see what
[1:02:29] happens when God does the choosing it's
[1:02:32] different when God does the choosing
[1:02:34] amen he doesn't look for big muscles he
[1:02:36] doesn't look for H popularity he doesn't
[1:02:39] look for uh the prettiest or best
[1:02:42] lookest person but he chooses a person
[1:02:45] with character he chooses a person after
[1:02:48] his own
[1:02:49] heart oh my David wasn't big bad and
[1:02:53] buff David had god with
[1:02:55] him amen he was a scrawny little fellow
[1:02:59] but he was chosen for a purpose and if I
[1:03:02] can tell you tonight you're chosen for a
[1:03:05] purpose and it's the same today the
[1:03:08] world has made their decision and
[1:03:10] they've rejected God they've chosen the
[1:03:13] leadership of a man's idea instead of
[1:03:15] the word so God said I will do the
[1:03:18] choosing in the last days I will pour my
[1:03:21] spirit out on
[1:03:23] my my my people I will pour my anointing
[1:03:26] out on my people John 15:16 says you
[1:03:30] have not chosen me but I have chosen you
[1:03:33] and I have ordained you I have anointed
[1:03:36] you amen he's anointed you for a purpose
[1:03:40] he's anointed you for a
[1:03:42] purpose amen amen you may not look
[1:03:46] pretty in the world's
[1:03:48] eyes you may not be the richest or the
[1:03:50] most powerful worldl person in the world
[1:03:54] but he's chosen you for a purpose he's
[1:03:57] poured out his anointing on you for a
[1:04:00] reason amen don't question God just take
[1:04:03] God at his word amen amen believe it so
[1:04:08] this little boy David was born in the
[1:04:11] world for a purpose amen do you believe
[1:04:14] that amen he know God was with
[1:04:18] him brother Bram says he was a crackshot
[1:04:21] he was a Woodsman he had a little
[1:04:23] slingshot out there and and bear one day
[1:04:27] run in and grabbed a little sheep and
[1:04:28] started out with it and David took his
[1:04:30] sling and knocked the lion down and took
[1:04:33] the Sheep right out of its mouth and
[1:04:35] when the lion come to himself and Rose
[1:04:37] David caught by the beard and took his
[1:04:39] hunting knife to him and that ended it
[1:04:42] he killed the bear also and he knew God
[1:04:45] was with
[1:04:47] him if you're going to come after the
[1:04:49] enemy you must first know that God is
[1:04:51] with
[1:04:52] you amen and now the next thing he did
[1:04:55] he played and cast out Devils if that
[1:04:58] ain't a Spirit-filled man I never seen
[1:05:00] one he might be a little and ready but
[1:05:02] he was a Spirit-filled man God was with
[1:05:04] him and then the first thing you know
[1:05:07] there broke out a war and the
[1:05:08] Philistines come out and he said well
[1:05:11] we're just going to have war with Israel
[1:05:13] and Saul called up uh and Saul got

[1:10:14] out the whole uh the oil upon him just
[1:10:16] when he went over uh whole horn full is
[1:10:19] not sparingly and that's the way God

[1:11:07] teach us to swim to let us drown right
[1:11:10] amen amen he didn't pour pour enough
[1:11:13] just to get through one day but he

[1:11:19] get us through a year to get us through
[1:11:20] 5 years to get us through the rest of

[1:11:55] gospel gets a hold of a person it just
[1:11:57] don't it don't make them still crave the
[1:11:59] things of the world but when the gospel

[1:19:57] you for it amen here we are David said
[1:20:01] sure I know how to trust this slingshot
[1:20:04] so he goes out there and he gets in and
[1:20:05] gets ready to go fight now imagine Saul
[1:20:09] saying I've trained men for years how to
[1:20:11] carry a sword how to carry a shield and
[1:20:13] how to fight I've trained them in my
[1:20:16] greatest seminars or my Bible colleges
[1:20:19] I've trained them the best I know how
[1:20:21] now that fell has refused I wonder what
[1:20:24] he's going to do I wonder what this kid
[1:20:26] is going to do I've offered him my armor
[1:20:29] I've offered him my own ideas I offered
[1:20:32] him this book and I've offered him that
[1:20:34] book and I've offered him these ideas
[1:20:36] and that ideas but he won't take them
[1:20:38] what is he going to do I tell you what
[1:20:40] he did amen the greatest seminars or
[1:20:44] Bible College I wonder what he's going
[1:20:45] to do so now David out there looking
[1:20:48] along picking up five some Stones David
[1:20:51] out there picking up some rocks would
[1:20:52] you imagine a country boy right picking
[1:20:54] up some rocks pulled out his little old
[1:20:56] slingshot and unwounded it like that he
[1:20:59] said well wonder what he's going to do
[1:21:01] with this and when David went to meet
[1:21:03] Goliath Goliath looked at him and
[1:21:05] laughed and he said why am I a dog you
[1:21:08] coming out here to meet me like that a
[1:21:10] little old Ruddy looking boy little old
[1:21:12] fellow probably shoulders stooped
[1:21:15] over and here he comes with this little
[1:21:17] sling but he know that God when that's
[1:21:20] the main thing and he was a believer he
[1:21:23] was elected he was called he was
[1:21:26] anointed and he was placed amen and you
[1:21:29] say well I wasn't called to be a
[1:21:31] preacher but you might be called to be a
[1:21:34] contractor you might be called to be
[1:21:36] this you might be called to be that come
[1:21:39] on now you might be called to be a
[1:21:41] housewife but as long as he's got you
[1:21:44] positioned in Christ Jesus by the Holy
[1:21:46] Ghost and has anointed you you're just
[1:21:49] much as a David as the rest of them you
[1:21:53] don't have to be some big famous
[1:21:54] preacher you don't have to be some
[1:21:56] well-known person over here or some
[1:21:59] well-known person over there but as long
[1:22:02] as you're positionally placed in Christ
[1:22:05] you're a David as the rest of
[1:22:10] them amen so the battle's on the
[1:22:13] Philistines are standing there Goliath
[1:22:15] made his charge and here goes David he
[1:22:18] reaches down he looks out there and he
[1:22:19] looked at Goliath up and down like that
[1:22:22] but Beyond Goliath he saw the victory
[1:22:25] because he trusted in God he thought how
[1:22:27] much more dangerous that line is than
[1:22:29] this Goliath that's a wild beast I
[1:22:31] trusted God to direct this shot of mine
[1:22:33] right straight to the head of that beast
[1:22:35] and I trust God to direct to direct the
[1:22:37] shot here for I killed the lion to save
[1:22:40] one sheep that's right God let me save
[1:22:43] the Sheep because I had faith that he
[1:22:45] would save the Sheep he know where he
[1:22:47] was and every David sitting here tonight
[1:22:50] you're positionally and placed in Christ
[1:22:52] God has confirmed it he's uh his
[1:22:55] election calling anointing placing he
