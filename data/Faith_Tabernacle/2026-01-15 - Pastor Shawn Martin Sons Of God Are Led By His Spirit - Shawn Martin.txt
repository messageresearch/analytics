Where unfailing love surrounds me when I need it most. You're my hiding place. Safe in your embrace. I'm protected from the storm that rages. And when the waters rise and I run to hide, Lord, in you I find my hiding place. I'm not asking you to take away my troubles, Lord, for it's through the stormy weather I learn to trust you more. So I thank you for your promise that I have come to know. Your unfailing love surrounds me when I need it most. You're my hideing place, safe in your embrace. I'm protected from the storm that rages. And when the waters rise and I run to hide, Lord, in you I find my hiding place. You're my hiding place. Safe in your embrace. I'm protected from the storm that rages. And when the waterers rise and I run to hide, Lord, in you I find my hiding place. Maybe we could just stand to our feet as we get ready to turn it over to brother Sean. We'll sing that. Yeah. Let me fall in love with you. Oh, let me fall in love with you all over again. Let me know you as never before. Let me hear your tender voice saying, "Let me come in. Let me willingly open the door. Let me fall in love with you all over again. Let me know you as never before. Let me hear your tender voice saying, "Let me come in. Let me willingly open the door. Let me fall in love with you all over again. Let me know you like never before. Let me hear your tender voice. Let me come in. Let me willingly open the door. Oh, falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus is the best thing I've ever done. In his arms, I feel protected. In his arms, never disconnected. In his arms, I am protected. There's no place I'd ra be falling in love with Jesus. is the best thing I've ever Well, is it the best thing you've ever done? Oh, in his arms I am protected. In his arms, never disconnected. In his arms, I am protected. There's no place I'd rather. Can we go up a key? Amen. Oh, falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus is the best thing I've ever done. Well, are you in love with him? Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's just sing this song. I'm so glad the Lord saved me. I'm so glad that the Lord saved me. I'm so glad that the Lord saved me. If it had not been for Jesus, where would I be? I'm so glad that the Lord saved me. Oh, I'm so glad that the Lord saved me. I'm so glad that the Lord saved me. And if it had not been for Jesus, where would I be? I'm so glad that the Lord save me. One more time. I'm so glad that the Lord saved me. I'm so glad that the Lord saved me. Well, if it had not been for Jesus, where would I be? I'm so glad that the Lord saved me. Well, are you glad you're saved? Amen. Well, maybe some of us are. Are you glad you're filled with the Holy Ghost? Amen. Glad you're going to heaven. Praise the Lord. Amen. Well, it's good to have uh Sharon with us. Amen. God bless you. And uh I don't know what's happened to you, but I'm uh glad I'm not in your shoes, but we'll certainly be praying for you. Amen. And uh good to have uh Daniel and uh Britney and the girls back. And Amen. A lot of folks are out. Amen. Due to sickness and pain and you know, just uh it's just running rampant everywhere. Amen. But uh I'm so glad that we could come to church and worship the Lord. Hold the fork down. Amen. Amen. Um the musicians can be dismissed. We'll turn to the book of John, the 10th chapter and the 24th verse. Amen. I hear it's supposed to get pretty cold tonight and tomorrow and but uh doesn't look like any snow in the forecast, but uh so sorry for the snowbirds and u maybe next time. Amen. Praise the Lord. Um, but before we go into the word, let's just bow our hearts and talk to the Lord. Amen. Lord Jesus, how we're thankful that you've saved our soul that you filled us with the Holy Ghost, Lord, and you've now bringing us into that adoption of sons. And Lord, we're got a bright future looking for the translation of our bodies. And God, it's uh no room, no room to be down. And Lord, in unbelief and hanging our heads down, but Father, we are to look up and lift our head for our redemption drawth nigh. And Father, as we're doing so tonight, I pray that you would just minister your word to us, Father, as you alone know the the meaning. You have the revelation, Lord, of it. And Father, we certainly need it tonight, Father. And I just pray your spirit would move among us now and help me to yield myself to you. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord. So we look at St. John uh the 10th chapter and um going to start at the 24th verse. Then came the Jews round about him and said unto him, "How long dust thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly." Jesus answered them, "I told you and you believe not. The works that I do in my father's name, they bear witness of me. But you believe not because you are not of my sheep as I said unto you. My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish. Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; My father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand. I and my father are one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then if you'll turn to uh Romans the 8th chapter, 14th verse, very familiar passage of scripture. Romans 8:14. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Amen. And for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, abba, father. The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have your seats this evening. And u my title would be sons of God are led by his spirit. And uh we see that um Jesus is talking to his critics cuz they they could not believe uh who he was even though he told them, even though he showed them. Uh but he said the reason why they they couldn't believe is simply because they were not his own. &gt;&gt; They did not come from him. So no matter how clear he made it, no matter what depths he manifested the father, &gt;&gt; uh there was nothing that would get them to believe it. And so uh he wasn't sent to try to convince people uh to believe. He he knew that there would be those that who who would believe and those who wouldn't believe. And he knew that those who wouldn't believe wouldn't be his. &gt;&gt; And those that would believe would be his. And so he come to seek his own. &gt;&gt; He come to save his own. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so from what we've read there that that we as sons, how many believes you're a son and daughter of God? &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen. I I think that takes faith and we we must be confident in that. And we we don't we don't regard our feelings or uh anything of this flesh. We just there's something that bears witness that we are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; And if we are sons and daughters of God, then we are to be led by the spirit of God. And being led of the spirit of God is a quality that only sons and daughters of God have. Um um you know we we just have that and it's a it's a sobering thought and yet it's a blessful thought &gt;&gt; because we are able to do things that a the average person cannot do. &gt;&gt; We are able to avoid things &gt;&gt; uh that the average person cannot avoid. We are we are able to come in contact with another world that no just your average person can't can't do. &gt;&gt; We are able to see things and to know things that the average person cannot see and know and that's because we are led by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Uh there is so much mockery around Christianity that it just really just it just turns my stomach when I see it and I hear it. Uh and there is so much impersonation of Christianity. &gt;&gt; But I I will say this that no man can be a Christian and I'm talking about a true Christian without the spirit of God dwelling in him or her. And and you know uh the only way that Christianity can be lived is by the spirit of God. Uh God would show this in several instances in the Bible. And and it may be just natural things, but it's it's it's to show us that it that that uh uh uh more of a supernatural thing. But look look at a man like Samson. Uh you hear of him taking the gates off of a city that it wasn't just a normal door. It was it was gates that weighed tons and yet he took them off and and and carried them up the hill and and uh now the world's carnal mind of this is they view Samson as some muscular man uh that just very strong. But the prophet would tell us that he was he was he was just a skinny kid, skinny boy, mama's boy, just a little shrimp, I think he would call him. Uh uh just just a a a peeon of a of a guy. And yet, but he done it by the spirit of God, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and how could the Hebrew boys come out of the fiery furnace without even having the smell of smoke uh uh uh upon their clothes and and things? How how could an axe head swim uh in the Old Testament as the Bible talks of uh there? How how could a man uh stand there and call fire out of heaven? Amen. and and and then a man uh uh look up at the sun and speak to it and command it to stand still and it stood still. How how can these things happen? How can a man foretell of uh or maybe tell someone of their past and then able to discern what is happening in the present and and fortell of future events and it be perfect to the dot. See, it took the spirit of God to do all of these things. Uh what what would cause Abel to uh uh offer a sacrifice that would be pleasing to God? Well, he couldn't do that on his own, but he done it by revelation. The the spirit of God moved upon him. And and so what what it would tell us is that uh uh it it takes the spirit of God. It's not a natural thing what makes uh you know the sons of God worship and lift their hands un unto the Lord and it it's the spirit of God. Something moves upon them. Amen. And uh uh uh and and and they act accordingly according to what the spirit is is is telling them or whatever. How will the bride Amen. Have you ever just thought, "How will this bride overcome in this day, this evil day, the most deceptive day, and yet they're going to overcome?" It's it's a paradox. It's something that cannot be explained. It's something that the the carnal man looks at it and says, "Well, I can do that, too." But it's something that cannot be copied because it's the spirit of God that is actually doing it. Zechariah 4 and6 it says this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit everybody say by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts. Amen. Amen. So so it's not by might not nor by power. Amen. But by my spirit. You know people misjudge the sons of God and and and by thinking that they're doing things on their own power. uh uh but but it's not it's it that that's far from the truth naturally. You know, we can think for ourselves. You know, a person uh can sing. If he has the ability to sing, he can sing. If a person has the ability to preach and and put things together, well, he he can preach. A person that can play music, if they have that ability, that talent, amen, to play to play music. And he can they can do that with the natural ability or or whatever they've been uh they they have that they can do they can do that with the natural ability uh uh and and but but how many people do it by by without being led of the spirit of God? Amen. Uh you know it it's it's one thing to to be able to do it. It's one thing for a man to preach. It's it's one thing for a man to uh to sing or or whatever, but it's another thing to do it under this by the spirit of God. Amen. See, it's and and that's the key is is the spirit of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh since the beginning of time, man has has wanted to lead himself. But God God ordained that that he would lead man. God wants to lead man. &gt;&gt; Uh and so he designed man for that that reason. He uh to where he could lead man. And you know the b uh the prophet says that God made himself a little control tower in the heart of man so that man would be led by his spirit. Ain't that right? See, and so when man uh uh decided to lead himself, the prophet said, "Now that's what separated him from God." You know, if if and I I pray I can take what words we have to say and and really God just use that to help us. But uh uh we don't want to be separated from God. We we don't want the name Christianity and and yet not have that connection with his God's spirit be because we're nothing without the spirit of God. Even even Jesus said without me you can do nothing. Ain't that right? You you can do nothing. And so we we find that uh uh uh an unconverted man, take take that, an unconverted man, all he does is he he walks after the flesh &gt;&gt; and and maybe he he does things after the flesh and he looks at at at the the believer and he says, "Well, I can do just that." So he comes to church with his Bible. He he dresses and she dresses just like like uh uh someone, you know, uh like the believer and and maybe even go as far as not to cut their hair, the woman. And and maybe to say, "Well, I I can wear a dress just like the the rest of them, so she wears the dress." And and and someone the man says, "Well, I can preach just like they do." So So he he says, "Well, I I'm just going to be a preacher." And so he can put notes together and he can do these things and all of that. But you you see uh uh uh what a man does in the flesh. Amen. Is is and what a man does in the spirit is two different things. C can you say amen? Uh uh see and and so uh uh what we're not to walk after the flesh now and and like I say I I pray that it it will help us because a man walking in the spirit and a man uh walking after the flesh produces two different results. Can can you say amen? Amen. See, and and so we we look Romans 8 and5. It says, "For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, &gt;&gt; but they that are after the spirit, the things of the spirit, for to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace." Ain't that right? So because the carnal mind is immity against God, for it is not subject uh to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So they in then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. Now I want you to understand that now. The carnal mind walks after the flesh. The carnal mind sees no need for the spirit of God. Whereas those that are walking in the spirit, the sons of God, they realize that if they're walking in the flesh, then then they're nothing. It it would take the spirit of God to come. Amen. I think it takes the spirit of God in our singing. I think we need the spirit of God in the preaching. I think we need the spirit of God. Amen. In in in in the music. I I think we need THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN OUR TESTIFYING. I I think we need THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN OUR AMENS. I think we need the spirit of God in our worship. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, now all of these things can be done after the flesh, but it would take the spirit of God. Amen. Uh uh that that we need. Now, brother Brandham says it's a dangerous thing when we go to think that many times Christians who are filled with the spirit of God or Holy Spirit will still walk after the flesh. Oh, did you know that they'll do it and then the Holy Spirit gets away from them? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, and so so we we don't want to walk after the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, you know, I think it was Paul that said, "How is that? You began in the spirit and then now you're being made perfect after the flesh, relying on the flesh, works of the flesh, the abilities of the flesh, talents of the flesh." Can you say, "Amen." What the flesh can do. Amen. You started out needing God. You started out depending upon God. You started out looking for his spirit. Amen. But somehow something's changed and you're looking after the flesh now. Depending upon the flesh, relying on the flesh, looking after the flesh. Ain't that right? And and the moment that we get in uh uh away from the spirit. Amen. And and walking after the flesh, well, the the prophet says the Holy Spirit gets away from from them. He said, "See, you see people sometimes someone will raise up and speak in tongues which will be God and maybe someone says, "Well, glory to God. I can do that, too." Well, see, that's flesh. He said, "You have to be led by the spirit." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. You have to be led by the spirit. Amen. Anything that we do, we don't want to just do it. We don't want to just be a preacher. We want to be anointed preachers. We don't want to just be musicians. We want to be anointed musicians. We don't want to just be deacons. We want to be anointed deacons. WE DON'T WE DON'T WANT TO BE JUST PARENTS. We want to be anointed parents. You You understand what I'm saying? AMEN. PEOPLE THAT are led by the spirit of God. Amen. There are there are a lot of parents that that are out there that are parenting children that DON'T EVEN KNOW GOD, DON'T EVEN CLAIM TO KNOW GOD. THEN THERE'S SOME THAT ARE just going to church and they're caught in religious things and and and they go for through the form of formality and rituals and and all that. But then there are parents that are led by THE SPIRIT OF GOD. CAN YOU say amen? Well, if you you'll see that there is a difference uh between the two. &gt;&gt; So, so you have to be led when when when people look at and say, well, you know, I I see this, so I can do that. I I can do that. You know, that's that's no problem. It it reminds me of of the sons ofKeva uh for example um where you know they they saw Paul casting out devils and and um and they thought well we can do that too and and so um uh they go to this demon-possessed man and says you know uh in the name of Paul Jesus who Paul preaches amen we rebuke you we command you to get out you know well that that demon looked at him says, "Well, now Paul I know and Jesus I know, &gt;&gt; but who in the world are you?" &gt;&gt; And and the Bible says that they made that devil mad. Amen. And and that demon whooped up on them guys and sent them down the street without clothes. Amen. See? Well, see, so what it was is they were doing something that Paul was doing in the spirit. They were doing it in the flesh. See, and they didn't see the difference between the two. They just thought, "Well, Paul's done it and he's doing a pretty good job, so let's go. Let's start us a ministry." Well, but but the the difference was was was Paul was led by the spirit to do it. And and these men, amen, were clueless about the spirit of God. So, so we find, brother Brandon puts it like this. A man or woman that tries to walk after the things of the world can never please God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, we got a lot of of of man's achievement. We're living in the day of man's achievements. Uh and and man, we've got quite a bit achievements of man and they just keep getting they're growing and getting smarter and and producing quite inventions. It's it's an amazing thing. I mean, they've got, you know, uh, uh, robots now, you know, and and, uh, and that's only just getting they're just getting started with what they're, you know, if the Lord would terry uh, uh, you know, you you hear, uh, I heard Elon Musk the other day and he was given a uh, speaking at a conference and the things that he was talking about blow your mind of what things that he's they've tapped into and what they're they're coming to in the human mind and how that they can read thoughts and and and by your thoughts you'll be able to control things and uh he it was an incredible thing and uh but but see it's after the flesh and and their achievements are done at in the in in the and I'm afraid that the achievements of man has entered into the church to where we're looking at at the at the the depending upon our own the flesh and I'm just talking about the church world uh for an example. Amen. And and you know it's it's incredible. And to where everybody thinks, well, that's the way to go. If you want a good business, if you want a good uh thing going, start a church. get people in, you know, and and you got businessmen running or great organizations as a church, you know, and and they're able to do this and they're able to do that and and no difference than a man that's got, you know, uh uh a thousand employees uh under him and he's doing a business with tech and and whatever he does. Amen. Get that same guy and put him behind the pullpit. Amen. He can he can start a church and he can he can he can go all kinds of things with it. They putting coffee shops in the church and they're doing this in the church and they're doing this in the church and it it's a great organization and it's it's an appeal uh to the church and they're bringing in millions of dollars with it and and all of that. it it's it's it's set aside the spirit of God and and now you find people walking after the flesh. Amen. And it's it's actually an impersonation so to speak of the real spiritual church. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So we we find amen that first Timothy 1 and12 uh Paul says, "And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who hath enabled me." Somebody say, "He's enabled me." See, who hath enabled me? See, so so it wasn't a a certain church or a certain ministry. It wasn't uh a college or seminary or or whatever. He's he's putting that I got my start because Christ, the spirit of God, hath enabled me. And for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So so we find this word to enable according to Webster is to make able to supply with power physical or moral to furnish with sufficient power or ability. see to furnish with legal ability or competence to uh authorize see to furnish with competent knowledge or skill and in general with adequate means. So when Paul is saying he's enabled me, he he's he's saying I'm not going by my smarts. I'm not going by what I've learned through Hebrew law and and and uh all of these things. He said under the greatest uh teacher of that day, Gale, I believe it was. And and and yet he SAYS, "BUT IT WASN'T THAT THAT put me in the ministry. IT WAS GOD THAT put me in the ministry. He's enabled me. Therefore, he that hath anointed us," he says in another place, is God. A ain't that right? See, so then a ministry uh should not be operated by the flesh. Amen. Nothing a gift should not be operated by by the flesh. Can you say amen? Amen. Uh it would take God to enable us. And and we want to realize that uh it takes God to enable us. If if God has put a call upon your life, then it would take God to open the doors. It takes God to anoint. It takes God to to to to uh uh bring an enlightenment. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? If if whatever it is, it's God. It's God gives you the ability. It's God that gives you the strength. It's God. It's all the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Now, Isaiah 40 28, I believe, it says, "Hast thou not known? Hast thou not heard that the everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, faintth not? Neither is weary. &gt;&gt; He's not weary. There is no searching of his understanding. He giveth, notice, he, everybody say, he he giveth power to the faint. &gt;&gt; And to them that have no might, he increasth strength. Even the youth shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fail. But they, everybody say, they, &gt;&gt; that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now, this is scripture. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. THEY SHALL MOUNT UP WITH WINGS as eagles IN A TIME WHERE EVERYBODY'S failing and uh they're getting weary and they're they're faltering. Amen. THERE IS A PEOPLE THAT'S just waiting UPON THE LORD. &gt;&gt; FOR THEY HAVE THE PROMISE NOT BY MIGHT nor by power but by my spirit. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; See, THEY SHALL MOUNT UP WITH WINGS as eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. &gt;&gt; See, so sons of God are enabled to do what they do. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They are enabled to withstand the enemy. They are enabled to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the spirit of God that in equipss them and makes them uh sufficient. Amen. uh uh ready, able to withstand the the things that they go through. It's the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, so now sons of God are enabled to see things that the carnal mind cannot see. And and this what sets us apart in my thoughts. Amen. Is being led by the spirit of God. I my battery might be low, so I'm going to go uh to this Judah. Uh so we see Amen. Uh you have to put it in my ear monitors. Uh 1 Corinthians 2:9, but as it is written, praise the Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; as it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard. There it is. Neither hath entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, say that again. Eye hath not seen and cannot see. Ear hath not heard and cannot hear. See, neither has it entered into the heart of man and cannot enter into the heart of man. Those things that God hath prepared for them that love him. But God, everybody say, "But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit." See, it's been revelation all the way down through through the ages. It It's been a revelation, a a a a a an eyeopening. Amen. The spirit of God revealing. Amen. So God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. Now the deep things they're they're not things that uh uh only a smart intelligent person can can comprehend. Amen. But they are things that are hidden. They are things that a a carnal smart genius could never understand. &gt;&gt; But these deep things are things that are hidden and cannot be seen EXCEPT GOD REVEALS THEM. These deep things are mysteries unto the world. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But it says now, for what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of a man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God. Who's we? The sons and daughters of God. We have received the spirit of God which uh that we might know the things the deep things that are freely given to us of God. So it takes the spirit of God to reveal them. It's not given to the intellect. It's not so that man can we're we're not walking after the flesh understanding these mysteries. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? We're we're sons of God that are led by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So it takes the spirit of God to reveal the things that are given of God. So I if if a person has received the Holy Spirit, it's it's because there the deep things there's deep things that God has given him or her AND GOD WANTS TO SHOW THEM TO her to him. Can you say amen? That's right. That the the Holy Spirit isn't there just to tickle our fancy and to get us to shouting and excited. I I believe the spirit of God moves in that way, but that's not ex that's not the purpose. Amen. God wants to show us things and and reveal things. You know, it's that's why the prophet said, "You don't read this Bible," Amen. like a newspaper. Amen. You don't read it like a book, a a fantasy book or a uh mystery book or or whatever. You you don't read it like that. Amen. It takes the spirit of God, amen, to move upon us to understand this Bible. &gt;&gt; See, led by the spirit of God. Now Deuteronomy 29:29 and the secret things belongs unto the Lord our God. But those things that he hath revealed belongs unto us and to our CHILDREN FOREVER. HOW MANY WANTS GOD to reveal it to you? Well, I do. I I I DON'T WANT TO SIT WITHOUT THE SPIRIT OF GOD. I I DON'T WANT TO BE A MAN THAT LIVES MY LIFE WITHOUT THE leading of God. I want God when I read this Bible. AMEN. I WANT GOD WHEN I hear the message and I I WANT GOD to lead me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those things that are found in the word that that that's the things that are secret things. That's the deep things. They're found in the word of God. &gt;&gt; And according to what Jesus said in John 16:13, it is the spirit of truth. Everybody say, "It's the spirit of truth that is to lead us and guide us into all truth." All truth. Ain't that right? And and and and of course you we understand that the word Amen. Uh uh comes to a prophet, a vindicated prophet. Ain't that right? Amen. The prophet said, "A true prophet is a divine interpreter of the word of God." That's that's what a prophet is. But notice the true prophet is the Holy Spirit himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that? That's what the prophet of God said that that. So he's trying to tell us that that a man that we would call a prophet, he's not the one that's sitting there, a man opening up the word to us and divining the word, interpreting the word. The Holy Spirit is the prophet. &gt;&gt; Not walking after the flesh. God wanted us to understand that it wasn't after the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's why he didn't bring an intellectual man and raise him up to be a prophet. &gt;&gt; He called a a hillbilly Kentucky and uh seventh grade education that couldn't talk. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And so the true prophet is the Holy Spirit. And he's the one, the prophet said, that has the true vision and is leading the church. The Holy Spirit was the prophet of Moses hour. The Holy Spirit was the prophet of Meaya's hour. The Holy Spirit is the prophet of this hour. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; But then we see that God had has for ordained certain men. Amen. Throughout time to bring forth the word uh to the people and that he would speak through these men, amen, and bring forth the word through them. Now, we call these men prophets. Amen. Ain't that right? A prophet. See, but a man cannot be a prophet without the word of the Lord coming to him. Amen. Without the spirit of God, God anoints these men. Amen. EVERY PROPHET THAT GOD HAS SENT WAS ANOINTED by the spirit of God. Amen. That they would utter things THAT THAT THEY THEMSELVES couldn't even understand. THEY THEMSELVES, AMEN, would never have spoken it, &gt;&gt; but it was the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; They were led by the spirit of God to speak those things. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? I believe that's exactly what our prophet was in this day. God anointed that man. And that man was so led by the spirit of God that he could utter things and believe things and and and speak things that would be a paradox and hard to understand to the carnal mind. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; See, these men are anointed with with what brother Brandon would call a prophetic spirit. That's what the spirit of God is. It's he's a prophetic spirit. Amen. And so when a prophet comes to the earth, it means that God is wanting to speak to his people and and to lead them in in a higher path. &gt;&gt; And so the prophet now is so in tune with God and yielded to the spirit of God that brother Brandham says that that a prophet never stands to be judged by any man. &gt;&gt; No, no man stands he stands before no man to be judged. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know we got a lot of judges on this earth today. Amen. That's trying to judge the message. But a prophet never stands before man and is judged. &gt;&gt; It's man that stands before a prophet because the word of God comes to a prophet &gt;&gt; to judge man. &gt;&gt; So the prophet said there are spirits that's in the church. That's true. Such as gifts of prophecy, healing, and so forth. But they're in the entire body. They may fall upon one person tonight, a prophecy, and it might never fall upon that person again. It might be somewhere's else in the body. And those spirits are supposed to be judged. Let one speak and two or three judge. See, said Paul. Now, those are spirits of the gifts that's in the church. But the only person that has a right to thus sayith the Lord is a vindicated prophet. And you never seen anybody judging Isaiah or Jeremiah or those people. They were prophets for ordained and born in the world to be prophets. They foraw the thing by vision and THEN SAID, "THUS SAYITH the Lord, for the Lord had already said it." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and a prophet always comes right at the time of junction. Amen. And a junction always comes at the end of the road. The prophet said, &gt;&gt; he says, "Every time the people are gathered together at the end of the road at a junction, God sends a true prophet and the devil sends a false prophet." Ain't that right? Well, I know you know these things, but just to reiterate it, there's only one prophet that God promised to send in this last day, and that's the prophet of Malachi 4. Amen. At the end of the gentile dispensation. Do you believe that? He is the the the last messenger of the the to the church age that John saw the seventh angel messenger. Amen. And when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished. How many believes that? So we're not waiting for a prophet. Amen. God sent a prophet. Not looking to another prophet. God syndicate vindicated a prophet of of brother Brandham and vindicated his ministry. for he was the seventh angel and he was the prophet of Malachi 4 and no other ministry will ever fit that description. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So the spirit of truth through that ministry has opened the word of God to us. Not just part of the word but all of the word. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. But I will tell you this that a person will not understand the message without having the spirit of truth within them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You'll not understand this message. You'll not understand the word just by your association with the message. &gt;&gt; Every person has to have the Holy Spirit for themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because each of us are individuals. Ain't that right? And the Bible says the spirit of the prophet, which is the Holy Spirit, is subject to the prophet. &gt;&gt; So you don't receive a different baptism of spirit than what brother Brandham had. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? The same Holy Spirit that he had. Amen. Is the same Holy Spirit you received. The same Holy Spirit that that that gave the word and revelation to brother Brandham of this Bible is the same spirit that you receive that will MAKE YOU COME SUBJECT TO THE WORD that he himself brought through that prophet. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, so the Holy Spirit will not show us things that that the prophet that he did not show the prophet. I'm just that's just my beliefs. &gt;&gt; There are many people who get their own revelation &gt;&gt; of things and they go out on what they brother Brandham called limbs. They go out off on limbs. &gt;&gt; They get so far out there they can't come back &gt;&gt; and before you know it they're claiming to be in the message and preaching no rapture, &gt;&gt; no resurrection, no bride age. &gt;&gt; Hello. saying that we're in the millennium, &gt;&gt; TEACHING TWO SOUL DOCTRINES. That's right. &gt;&gt; TEACHING SOME DOCTRINE OF PERUSIA THAT IS SO MESSED UP. &gt;&gt; SEE, PREACHING, you know, polygamy. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and they'll take portions of the word, portions of the message. Amen. And and yet IT'S IT'S TOTALLY AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT A PROPHET STOOD FOR. &gt;&gt; PROPHET never stood for polygamy. PROPHET NEVER TAUGHT two lords. &gt;&gt; Prophet didn't preach two souls either. &gt;&gt; See, THE PROPHET DIDN'T PREACH THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; So then IT WOULD REQUIRE US. AMEN. IF WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE MESSAGE, WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE SPIRIT OF THE PROPHET &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD COME INTO US AND teach us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; do you believe it? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not lean upon the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit. First Corinth 1 Corinthians 14:33. God is not the author of confusion. 1 Corinthians 1:10. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, that there be no divisions among you, but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Ain't that right? Not one saying, "Well, everything's, you know, the message is all right." But, you know, he, you know, it's part of it's inspired and part of it's not. That's the same old devil that's causing people for years to say this this Bible is part inspired and part not. &gt;&gt; That's right. It &gt;&gt; It's just the same thing. If If he's been attacking the word, then why wouldn't he attack the message for it is the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, so there then there comes A UNITY BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD, A LEADERSHIP because we come under the same leadership. Amen. Brother Brandham said, "Listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last stage. What he says FROM GOD, THE BRIDE will say." &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; The spirit, everybody say, "The spirit." &gt;&gt; The prophet &gt;&gt; and the bride. &gt;&gt; The bride &gt;&gt; will be saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. and what they will say will have already been said in the word. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? SO THEN THERE'S NO CONTRADICTION. You cannot say that that uh that the word of God is in continuity but all of a sudden this bride in this age is speaking something contrary to this. &gt;&gt; It all speaks together. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Why? Because from beginning to end, man, that elect has been led by the spirit of God. So the spirit of truth is going to lead us, every son, every daughter into all truth. He's not going to lead some people just in Jesus name baptism and refuse to lead them the rest of the way. &gt;&gt; He's not going to lead some people, you know, lead a person to see the the truth of the serpent seed doctrine &gt;&gt; and then they can't see the truth of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, this is exactly what the Bible says. He will lead and guide us into all truth. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, so if we're going to speak the same thing, it's going to take the Holy Spirit to bring a revelation that we can understand exactly what a prophet said. Now, you may not be able to teach it just like a prophet. You may not be, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN IN YOUR HEART THAT SAYS THAT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE spirit of God leading you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "If the Holy Spirit is in you, it'll lead you right to the word." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, it means that he'll lead you to the vindicated. If anyone's got the spirit of God truly has the spirit of God, isn't that so? It'll lead him to the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. For this age, because the word comes to a prophet. Even our Lord Jesus when he was on earth went straight to the prophet &gt;&gt; for he was the word. &gt;&gt; So the prophet explained exactly why Jesus went to a prophet before he started his ministry. BEFORE HE DONE ANYTHING, he went straight to the prophet &gt;&gt; to fulfill the word. It all had to be together. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. I love the Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; So then if you notice, he the spirit of truth is to show us things to come. It's the spirit of revelation. Then &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; How we need that not just in understanding the word but just in our life in general. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is exactly what the Holy Spirit does when he comes into an individual. He reveals things to us. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; The prophet talks about Jesus. There he is, a man. Tears filled his eyes at times. When he's at the the grave of Lazarus, the Bible says he wept. He was full of compassion and and and tears flowed from his eyes. And you know uh because of just the sympathy for the people and yet he was GOD &gt;&gt; CLOTHED IN HUMANITY TO TAKE AWAY OUR SIN. Right &gt;&gt; now the prophet said see yet behind that humanity he had something behind him that could look right down into the heart of a man and know all about him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; See, spirit of revelation, prophetic spirit, &gt;&gt; spirit of discernment, &gt;&gt; a man that was well, he said it was only given to the father to know &gt;&gt; the end time, to know when he's coming back. &gt;&gt; He said he didn't even know. And yet the God in him could look through these eyes and when he looks at a human being could know all about him. &gt;&gt; Ain't that amazing? &gt;&gt; See now now the people didn't know who he was. HE WAS CLOTHED IN FLESH. HE WAS A MAN standing there. Yet something was in that flesh that was God. &gt;&gt; People didn't know who he was. That flesh was a veil that God hid behind. Ain't that right? Yet Jesus said to them in John 8:24, "If you believe me not, if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins." &gt;&gt; PROPHET SAID HE TRIED TO GET THE MESSAGE, THE REVELATION to them of who he was. He was a man whose eyes looked at the face of the suffering and wept for them. And yet THE SPIRIT OF GOD WAS IN HIM would get behind that human vision and see all things. &gt;&gt; He could see things that was things that were present and things that were yet to come. &gt;&gt; He could foretell the end FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE GOD WAS behind those human eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now notice what he says. Still talking about being led by the spirit of God. Now, he says, "Let God come into your life and take control of you, and he'll show you things to come. For it's not you no more. It's the Holy Spirit in your life back there looking through them mortal eyes to pick out things." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, we're in a we're in a world where no one sees wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because they're blind. did not did not in Leoa Jesus told them you're blind, naked, and miserable and you know it not. &gt;&gt; They're blind and they cannot see the sin even though the sin is there. &gt;&gt; There's no conviction. There's no repentance. There's nothing because they don't see the wrong in it. But see what then then what would cause us to look and and see the sin so much that it would cause our hearts to grieve &gt;&gt; and we would be burdened for the lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of God that is showing us things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hope you understand. See, it's not you no more. It's the Holy Spirit cannot be led. Well, you well, the Holy Spirit led me, you know, to pray for someone and the Holy Spirit leads me here, you know, to go here and to go here. So many people saying, claiming the Lord speaking to them and and all these things, but yet they can't even see the simple wrongs. &gt;&gt; They can't see the wrongs in a woman cutting her hair. They can't see the wrongs in in the fact of just not coming to church. &gt;&gt; They can't see the wrongs in in in uh uh uh man and woman living uh in adultery. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING THERE TO TO TELL THEM THAT'S WRONG. &gt;&gt; Hope you understand. &gt;&gt; See what about women preaching? What what what about those things? And yet the spirit leading them here, they say, and leading them here and leading them there. that can't can't open their eyes to see the things that are that are evil before God's eyes. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; See, so so we find then that it takes the spirit of God in a man to show us &gt;&gt; they that are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello. See, now notice when we when we read the word of God, then see, we want God in us to look through our mortal eyes. &gt;&gt; Have you ever had him do it &gt;&gt; to where you're reading and maybe you you you didn't know what the scripture was before, but as your eyes fall upon it and and and something begins to enlighten you about that scripture, well, what is it? IT'S THE SPIRIT OF GOD. THAT'S ACTIVE IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We don't want the spirit of God to lay dormant. &gt;&gt; Well, I got the spirit of God. Well, then he's got to be active. &gt;&gt; He's got to be leading us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. It It's just the truth. God, take my eyes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God, show me things through my eyes. Can you say amen? Not so I can be judgmental. Not so I can BE A KNOW-IT-ALL. NOT SO I CAN BE WHATEVER, BUT TO KEEP ME RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so so he he takes things God in us begins to lead us into things and we begin to see things that maybe just our carnal mind would have never been able to see. Well, you know, uh uh it it just shows that we're not just making things up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we're we're not just guessing at things. It's the spirit of God that is leading us. We're being led. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Well, this takes a total surrender. And I I pray God just makes sense out of it all. But but brother Brandham said you've got to completely surrender your own thoughts, your own will, your own mind, and let the mind of Christ operate in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Says, now do you think Christ uh the mind of Christ in you would say the days of miracles is passed? Do you think the mind of Christ in you would say the Bible's right in some places and not in others? You think the mind of Christ would sanction every word that Christ ever said? See? Well, it's your wood. See, it's right. So, if you don't use your own mind, just use his mind. He said, "That's how visions at nighttime come." See, I don't use my own mind. See, I couldn't do nothing but just yield myself to him. Then he uses my mind, my eyes, MY MOUTH. HE'S MY ALL. &gt;&gt; JUST YIELD. That's the way you do it. That's the way these ministers do when they're preaching the gospel. They get up here and take a text. Why? They just start off to preach and yield themselves to God. They're ministers. See, first thing you know, the Holy Spirit maybe take them on another text. Take them somewhere's else. See? Amen. See, what is it? It's the spirit of God in operation. &gt;&gt; It's letting the spirit do whatever he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; It's very important that we're led by the spirit. True. &gt;&gt; You see, God made us to where he can use us. God, man is God's agent, as the prophet would tell us. God uses man to work his will. &gt;&gt; Parents, God wants to use you. Ministers, God wants to use you. &gt;&gt; Deacons, God wants to use you. &gt;&gt; Trustees, whoever, mamas, uh, you know, God, God wants to use us all. Maybe you're the boss. Maybe you're the employee. But wherever God has put you, he wants to use you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Now the prophet said, "Even though the Holy Spirit covers the earth, it is almost helpless until it gets into you and me." The spirit of God cannot operate until it comes into us. We human beings to operate. &gt;&gt; So then God is depending upon you and I. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And we're not just the general person that he just says, "hm, I'm going to try them and see if I can work. If I can't, I'm going to try this one and see if I can't. If I, well, I'm going to just try to find somebody here." No, we are chosen for this age as SONS OF GOD. AMEN. GOD'S GOT CONFIDENCE in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's dependent upon you and I. Brother Bram talks of holding a meeting in Mississippi, I believe it was, and y'all's heard it, but you know, he talks about that little mother walking around packing a little baby. And he said there was another little mother sitting there, just typical little southern mother with a little gingham, calico, whatever dress on and just a little housewife. But the Lord kept dealing with that woman. Go pray for that baby. while she looked and the woman had a prayer card and she says, "Oh, I'd be afraid to go pray for that baby. Brother Brandham's going to pray for that baby tonight." The woman said, the woman said, "The woman's got a prayer card." And so I I wouldn't do it, you know, and she turned around. The Lord said to her, just revealed to her heart, "Go pray for that baby." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, it's the leading of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; See, and he said, "Well, it just kept haunting her so much. She said, 'Well, if the woman comes back through here again, I'm going to stop her. So, she said, 'Lady, would you take my seat and sit down here? I know you're just wore out with that baby and he won't be here for a couple hours yet. And the lady said, "Thank you, sister. I appreciate that. I hate to take your seat." And so, finally, she says, "Would you mind if I just offer a little word of prayer for that baby? I see you got a prayer card. perhaps brother Brandham will pray for that baby tonight but just to relieve my feeling would you mind if I offer a little prayer and she said why certainly not dear sister you know and she held the baby out and the little mother laid her hands on that baby and began to pray a simple prayer now brother says that that woman with that child got called in the prayer line when that woman came up &gt;&gt; Amen he says now he says the Holy Spirit began to talk to the woman and tell her who she was, what was the matter with her baby, but said, "You know, your baby's already healed cuz a lady has already prayed for her." &gt;&gt; See, and standing up there in that balcony, God's already heard her prayer and the baby is already healed. You don't have to worry about it. It's all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Led. Led. See? Well, WELL, WHAT WHAT IF he says the mother failed to do what God told her to do? See, it wasn't the evangelist place. &gt;&gt; God works in all the ley. WE HAVE CERTAIN JOBS to do, but you have to pray for one another and God will take care of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; I hope in this little sermon tonight that it can make some sense to you. Whatever job you have to do, don't try to do it in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Be led. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have the ability to preach and put a sermon together, but it doesn't make you God's minister. &gt;&gt; You may have a great voice, be ranked among the top best singers. You could sing like a mocking bird, but that doesn't make you God's singer. &gt;&gt; See, God has to lead you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Amen." God has to lead you. Brother Brandon tells us how the visions come to him. It wasn't just a natural thing, but the visions came to him. He said, "It's just yielding yourself to the Holy Spirit, getting yourself out of the way, your own ideas, and just be led by the spirit of God." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, he was already designed to have visions because he was a prophet. But that man had to yield himself to God. Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; had to yield himself to the spirit. You may already be ordained to be a preacher, but you have to yield yourself to the spirit of God. You may already be ordained to be a musician and called with the gift to sing or whatever it is, but you have to yield yourself to God in order for God to use that gift, for God to use that talent. Can you say amen? Amen. See, it's it's an anointing. Gifts and callings are are are without repentance. And and we know these things, but but you know, and and you couldn't be what you are without the ability. Amen. God given you that ability. Ain't that right? But what you do with it is is up to you. &gt;&gt; God gave Elvis the gift to sing and he gave it to the devil. &gt;&gt; Yielded himself, surrendered himself to the devil. And a lot of these gospel groups, the Isaac's and the Gaithers and I don't know, I could name a bunch of them, but that's what they're doing. They're just yielding themselves, them gifts to the devil. &gt;&gt; I was starting to sing country music. I one one saw where one uh the Isaacs were introduced the other day as the uh uh the group of gospel and the group of country. They walked up there like it was a some proud thing to have. &gt;&gt; I thought, "What a shame. Shame on you." &gt;&gt; Shame on you. You owe Judas. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what they are. They start out with the gift of God, using it for God, and they get up in their minds and they think they're something else, and they think they're doing it all. They're walking after the flesh. &gt;&gt; It's nothing but a Judas. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "They're not even fit to sing a gospel song. That's right. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; But see, what we want to do is yield ourselves to the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to surrender. Amen. Brother Brandham says, "Now, I'm going to tell you a secret as I leave. You've been sweet and kind. I've never exactly expressed this I know of public before." You say, "Brother Brandham, what is that gift?" It's a gift of knowing how to get William Brham out of the way. So Jesus Christ can live through a vessel. See, it's just getting yourself out of the way. Another place, what is a gift? Not something you take and chop and turn. No, it's knowing how to get yourself out of the way that God can use you. &gt;&gt; A gift is only getting yourself out, then God uses it. Another place it's finding God to getting yourself out of the way and letting the Holy Spirit use you to whatever he wants to do. That's it. The main thing of any gift is getting your own ideas away and let Christ. Then whatever it said, if you want to know whether it's Christ or not, just a sensation, leave it alone. If it's just an emotion, leave that alone. But if it's written in the word, then it's God. Always judge everything that any spirit tells you by the word. The word don't never get away from that word. If you do, you're lost. &gt;&gt; So it a gift is not, well, I've got power to do this and I've got power. Your power of a gift is get yourself out of the way. And the gift that God has given you operates through that after you're out of the way. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. And if the musicians will come, &gt;&gt; bless his name. &gt;&gt; Another thing I believe that God has the answers to life's problems. &gt;&gt; And I think it's very important for us to comprehend. He has the answer to life's problems. He knows the challenges. He knows knows the ups and downs before you get there. He knows the giants in your way. He knows the the the the troubles that you have and he knew that before the foundation of the world. But he knows what to do when you don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're a family crisis faces a crisis and you don't know what to do. God knows what to do. And if we can learn not to handle it after our flesh, not to handle it after our own way, but to yield to the spirit of God and wait until the spirit of God leads us. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. He knows what to do. See, and even when we think we know what to do, he knows even better. He's always got the right answer for us. Do you believe it? That's why Proverbs 3:5 says, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes. Fear the Lord and depart from evil." Amen. So, a son of God, he's not just to be led, you know, when they're using their gift to preach or to sing or whatever. Amen. But we are to be led by the spirit every day of our lives to where we become sensitive to his spirit. till we become sensitive to his auctioning to where we understand that not everything that is happening is for our bad. God's using it for our good. Amen. Amen. You know, he's not just the spirit of truth, but he's the spirit of prophecy, knowing what will be. Do you realize that he can help us sidestep trouble if we'll just yield ourselves to him? He can save us a lot of headaches just by yielding and being sensitive to his spirit. Amen. Amen. Spirit of wisdom. He is the spirit of wisdom. The Bible says he can give us wisdom to handle things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Give us wisdom to speak words. He's the spirit of grace. The Bible says grace to keep us from things. Keep our feet from falling. Oh, do you love him? I think we need the spirit of God more than ever before. need the spirit of God. You know, Brother Brandham in a prayer of his, he said, "Lord, we're living in a day when people are taught so hard against this." Talking about discernment of the spirit, said they're against you, against your word, against your spirit, they don't know what to believe. And church, that is the truth. We're living in a day that people just don't see the importance of the spirit of God. They they just want to go with what they want to do, what they want to say, what what how they want to act, what they're the boss. But every one of us. We are to be led by the spirit of God. But people have no time for the spirit of God. I've, you know, you you watch it. You know, even in churches, but not just I I'm not saying here. I'm just saying just in general, people ain't got time. They want to hurry church up where God just ain't got time to move. They keep a preacher on time clock. They teach the song leader on time clock cuz they they got to get up and work. But but we find it it ain't only on Wednesday nights, Sunday. They got more things to do. Everybody's got something to do except get wait upon the Lord. And that's the most important thing is is letting God have his way. Cuz I'm telling you, church, if if we ain't got him and if we can't wait upon him and and we can't let him just have his way and and and these things, then what are we going to do? Can you say amen? You love him. God bless you is our prayer. Amen. me Lord. The fire of your spirit, oh consume me, Lord. Oh, come and make me Lord. Bless the broken pieces of my life. Let me be used Lord for you. Oh, sing it again. Oh, consume me Lord with the fire of his spirit. Consume me Lord. Make me just like you. Come and break me Lord and bless the broken pieces of my life. Let me be used long for you. Sing it as a prayer. Oh, consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit. Consume me Lord. Make me just like you. Come and break me, Lord. and bless the broken pieces of my life. Let me be used, Lord, for you. I need more of you. That's the way it's got to be. I need more of you. That's the way it's got to be. I need more of you. Oh yes. Till there's just no room for me. All those wasted hours and minutes. Yeah, Lord. They're yours now. From the start to the finish. I need more of you in me. I need more of. Is that the way you feel tonight? Can you sing it as a prayer? Oh, that's the way it's got to be. Oh, I need more of you. Glory. till there's no room left in me. And all those wasted hours and minutes, they're yours now. From the start to the finish. Oh, I need more of you in God bless you is our prayer. We certainly love the Lord. Amen. there's ever a time that we need to meditate upon him, not meditate upon our problems, not meditate upon others problems, but just meditate upon God, not meditate upon the news, but just focus upon God and where he becomes such a reality in our own personal lives and we can become sensitive to his spirit. Can you say amen? Amen. We could stand to our feet. Amen. We want to remember those that are sick, not feeling good. Uh there's uh quite a few uh that are just not uh doing good tonight. And so we want to uh keep them in our prayer and u uh that the Lord will just touch them and help them. Um, uh, Sister Kim, she had gotten her result back of the CT scan and, uh, there's nothing there to be seen. Um, you know, there was a bag of fluid. Well, they didn't take the bag out. She found out that they've left that bag there, and that was probably why they were afraid that something's going to start back and grow. Uh but um so they said that's that's what's hurting her back and um then they've got you know two metal stints around that stone. Um and uh that bile and infection and all that's going through there and they're hoping the point is is they're hoping that bile and stuff will kind of wear that stone down and get it to move. Uh they said it's the largest stone they've ever seen. And uh so just to be honest, they're perplexed at what to do with it, but that's what's causing the pain in the stomach and u you know, bless her heart, they're not wanting her to do surgery uh at this point. uh waiting for a few months unless it's just an absolute have to where she just can't handle the pain and and uh all of that stuff and uh so she's just you know she's kind of left in a quandry there but uh I I you know when the physicians don't know what to do God knows and so we don't lose heart we don't lose our confidence God loves to move when the doctors don't know what to do. And I'm just believing God to just cause that stone to move or to dissolve or something. And uh God will just help Sister Kim, give her the grace to to press on. Amen. And uh so uh but uh just keep sister Martha in our prayer and uh God just continuing to help her and and just so many needs not just present but around the world among the bride of Christ. And so a lot to pray for. Amen. And so God bless you. Remember service uh Sunday and um we look forward to seeing you again. Uh, Sister Sharon, God bless you. Good to have you. Amen. And u uh we'll this dismiss in a word of prayer. Amen. Let's just pray. Father, we thank you Lord for all
