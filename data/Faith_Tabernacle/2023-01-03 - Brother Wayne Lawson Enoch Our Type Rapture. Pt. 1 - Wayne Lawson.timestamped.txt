[0:00] we do not know each other but the Lord
[0:02] Jesus knows who the both of us doesn't
[0:04] he and realizing his man together
[0:07] someday we must answer
[0:10] God
[0:12] answer in his presence give an account
[0:15] for all that we do
[0:18] that's right isn't it
[0:21] if God will tell me where your trouble
[0:23] is and what's wrong with you will you
[0:25] accept your healing if it's that's what
[0:27] it's for
[0:29] knowing that we're strangers first time
[0:32] ever meeting in life
[0:36] your trouble is in your leg
[0:40] isn't it it's your left leg
[0:44] and it's a tumor and the tumor is back
[0:47] behind the knee on the left leg covered
[0:50] over by your trousers now that's true
[0:54] do you believe now with all your heart
[0:56] come here Dicky
[0:58] our heavenly father I bless this my
[1:02] brother and lay my hands up on him to
[1:04] take this curse of the devil from him
[1:06] and may he be made completely whole in
[1:09] Jesus dear name I asked it amen

[1:42] what'd you think about that mother
[1:43] sitting here on the end of this seat
[1:45] there
[1:48] you were praying then for God to take
[1:50] that gallbladder trouble when he's from
[1:51] you
[1:54] he did
[1:57] raise up your hand if that's true
[1:59] [Music]
[2:00] you just asked Jesus have him turn and
[2:03] talk to me wasn't that right raise up
[2:05] your hand if that's true that's right he
[2:07] heard your prayer you're healing
[2:10] you won't vomit with it no more

[2:16] have faith in God
[2:19] believe with all your heart
[2:22] how'd he do lady
[2:25] you believe with all your heart
[2:28] I believe that just a bit nervous now
[2:31] because it's I wish you'd walk out of
[2:34] your brother if you were out there if
[2:36] you will
[2:38] the spirit is moving across the man
[2:42] um
[2:44] I want you to look this way just a
[2:46] minute I want to talk to you we are
[2:49] strange to each other are we lady
[2:51] this is our first time of meeting in
[2:53] line is that true
[2:55] but the Holy Spirit has no Jew ever
[2:57] since you were born
[2:59] and now I want to ask you something
[3:02] you're aware that you're in the presence
[3:04] something of something
[3:06] you're it's a feeling that you have at
[3:09] this time that's kind of odd to you it's
[3:13] um it's uh you haven't felt like this
[3:15] before if that's right raise up your
[3:18] hands so if the people will know
[3:20] well that's nothing to harm you do you
[3:23] see the picture there at that line
[3:24] that's what's over you right now that's
[3:26] what makes you feel that way see and
[3:29] that's what see as as he when it comes
[3:32] in anoints us both now then I won't talk
[3:35] no more he'll use my voice and talk
[3:37] he'll tell you what he wants you to know
[3:39] then you you'll know whether it's true
[3:41] or not then you're being just a little
[3:44] shaky and nervous that's the reason it's

[5:21] said these signs shall follow them that
[5:22] believeth if they lay their hands on the
[5:24] sick they shall recover the Bible said
[5:26] that the last words Jesus said before he

[38:30] in a lowly place of birth came a light
[38:34] down to the Earth for it was proof a
[38:37] mighty gift had blessed our land now the
[38:40] time of changes here and the sign he
[38:44] said was clear that when a stake was
[38:46] driven down into the ground where he was

[38:54] be blessed it was a season that the
[38:56] Thunder should sound I'm telling you

[51:34] Conference with Brother Scott and

[51:39] uh the Rapture a little bit from what
[51:42] what prophet taught on it and um and
[51:46] that's it's been several years back some
[51:47] of you may have been there during that
[51:49] time we just just been uh did another
[51:52] one out in Branson Missouri and the lord

[52:01] series uh and just a little bit deeper
[52:04] and a little bit of different directions
[52:06] and and looking into it and we've just
[52:09] been praying about we've got three four

[53:40] Lord the brother Sean would have a
[53:42] confidence to bring us here

[54:43] and amen and amen and God bless you if
[54:46] you have your Bibles tonight we'd like
[54:48] to go into first Thessalonians chapter
[54:50] four uh and we'll just read from there
[54:56] amen first Thessalonians chapter 4.
[55:08] I'd like to bring you greetings from
[55:09] Brother Erickson and the church there
[55:11] true word Tabernacle and amen uh
[55:17] first Thessalonians chapter 4.
[55:20] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[55:23] heaven
[55:24] with a shout
[55:27] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[55:30] the Trump of God
[55:31] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[55:36] then we which are alive and remain
[55:39] shall be caught up together with them in
[55:42] the clouds
[55:43] to meet the Lord in the air and so shall
[55:46] we ever be with the Lord
[55:50] we ask the Lord to bless his word
[55:51] tonight shake somebody's hand and have
[55:54] yourself a seed and amen y'all pray for
[55:56] us and
[55:57] amen
[56:04] I want to if I can to speak to you a
[56:07] little bit tonight on this subject and
[56:08] uh we have a little bit of things to
[56:11] share with you and uh and uh so we just
[56:14] want to get right into it if it's okay
[56:16] with you I believe that this specific
[56:18] subject of the Rapture is my favorite
[56:21] subject it's my favorite subject to talk
[56:24] about it's my favorite favorite subject
[56:26] to preach about uh because I believe uh
[56:29] that this is the generation of of the
[56:32] Rapture and I believe it's the time that
[56:35] we have and I believe it's supposed to
[56:37] be taking place I believe we're the
[56:39] generation for this to happen and uh so
[56:42] we're we're trusting tonight that
[56:43] something could be said and that would
[56:45] be a blessing to it and I just happened
[56:47] to look back here and sing Barry Coffey
[56:49] said it was you in here when I walked
[56:51] out
[56:51] no okay I was gonna say man I completely
[56:55] missed him God bless you brother Barry
[56:56] amen it's good to have him here tonight
[56:58] I actually heard a little bit of your
[57:00] sermon there at Brother Paul's the other
[57:01] day and I was going to text you today
[57:02] and tell you how much I enjoyed it I I
[57:05] don't know if you all have heard it but
[57:06] he talked a little bit about the time of
[57:08] Esther and the delay uh that that she
[57:11] had to wait and I thought that was
[57:13] phenomenal brother Berry it was a
[57:14] blessing amen it really blessed our
[57:16] heart and God bless you for that amen
[57:19] and uh I think it's a tremendous thing
[57:21] to see that God has delays for a reason
[57:24] and as a church waiting on a Rapture uh
[57:27] it sure helps to explain sometimes why
[57:29] we've been so long between the time that
[57:32] a prophet preached something and uh to
[57:35] the time that we're living now amen and
[57:37] uh so God's not slack concerned his
[57:39] promises now when you think about
[57:40] Rapture tonight you have something that
[57:44] you think about when someone says to you
[57:46] the word rapture you there's there's
[57:49] there's a definition that comes there's
[57:51] a thought there's something that rises
[57:54] up in your mind and you think Rapture
[57:56] now if you're if you're if you're
[57:58] listening to that word now there's a a
[58:00] myriad of ideas and many conclusions
[58:04] that will pre-exist uh brother random
[58:06] speaking on the subject of the Rapture
[58:08] uh there's right now in the world we're
[58:11] living there's movies there's sermons
[58:13] there's books there's media there's
[58:15] words it's like a rain or a flood of
[58:18] ideas concerning the Rapture if you do
[58:21] much secular studying on the Rapture
[58:23] most everyone will tell you that it's
[58:25] pretty much a 20th century doctrine that
[58:27] is not something that was taught much in
[58:28] the early ages up throughout the church
[58:31] ages but it but but most people will say
[58:34] they're in the charismatic and
[58:35] Pentecostal moving that that's where the
[58:37] that's where the main thrust of lots of
[58:40] people talking about something was
[58:42] during that time and so of course it's
[58:45] been in the Bible the whole time but
[58:47] it's when it's become a part of the
[58:49] focus and so there's so many so much
[58:52] being said about it now so many people
[58:54] so that of course everyone has a
[58:56] different definition concerning this and
[58:59] uh I think if there's a there's a I
[59:01] think if there's a word and there's a
[59:04] need then God has a way to define
[59:06] something and there has to be an
[59:08] authority on that definition and so what
[59:11] we needed to as a church was a
[59:14] definitive Revelation or a definitive uh
[59:18] a definition concerning the Rapture to
[59:21] know what is the expectation of the
[59:24] church now the word rapture brother Bram
[59:26] says is not even in the Bible it's not
[59:28] even used at all and we just put that
[59:30] word in there but the Bible actually
[59:33] says caught up or being caught up and we
[59:36] read in first Thessalonians it is order
[59:38] of the great Rapture that will take
[59:40] place in the last days now of course
[59:42] when we read first thesalonians in
[59:44] chapter 4 and verse 17 you'll find out
[59:47] the Bible says and we which are alive
[59:49] and remain shall be caught up so that's
[59:52] where the word the Rapture is put in
[59:55] scripture is that they that alive and
[59:57] remains shall have Rapture Brothers
[59:59] actually talks about the difference
[1:00:00] between catching up and being caught up
[1:00:04] he's you know a man so catching up and
[1:00:07] caught up but there'll be a Rapture now
[1:00:08] if you go to the definition of the
[1:00:11] actual word rapture or the root meaning
[1:00:13] of the of the of the word we use Rapture
[1:00:15] it's derived from a middle French word
[1:00:18] rapture or a medieval Latin raptura
[1:00:22] which means a seizure or a kidnapping
[1:00:25] which derives from the Latin raptus a
[1:00:28] carrying off so if we're going to define
[1:00:31] the word rapture we're going to Define
[1:00:32] it as a seizure as a kidnapping or a
[1:00:36] carrying off now this is a little
[1:00:38] different than what many people use
[1:00:41] about the Rapture because a lot of
[1:00:42] people are thinking the Rapture is
[1:00:44] something that if you work hard enough
[1:00:46] you're going to get to be a part of it
[1:00:48] but what brother Branham was
[1:00:50] representing to the church or saying to
[1:00:52] the church is that this is more of a
[1:00:54] kidnapping or a seizing or a carrying
[1:00:57] off of something that belongs to God
[1:01:00] it's not something where that if you
[1:01:02] pray hard enough or you fast hard enough
[1:01:04] or that you're going to get to be a part
[1:01:06] of this but one solid point that William
[1:01:09] Branham made over and over and over is
[1:01:12] that the Rapture is by election and
[1:01:14] predestination according to Matthew 25
[1:01:17] there are five wise virgins so this is
[1:01:20] not someone that we can just uh we could
[1:01:23] if we just jump hard enough or we work
[1:01:25] hard enough or if we pray hard enough
[1:01:28] that we're going to get to be a part of
[1:01:29] this but this Rapture is for an elected
[1:01:32] people amen God is not going to be
[1:01:34] unjust in kidnapping somebody else's kid
[1:01:37] he's just going to take his own children
[1:01:39] home amen that's what's about to happen
[1:01:42] destruction is falling upon this Earth
[1:01:44] and God is going to take his own
[1:01:47] children home I say this that God Amen
[1:01:50] is is going to carry off amen it it
[1:01:53] changes the way you view that
[1:01:54] automatically doesn't that God's going
[1:01:57] to carry somebody off or he's going to
[1:01:58] see someone or he's going to catch him
[1:02:01] or he's going to take a hold of them
[1:02:03] look in John 6 44 or brother random uses
[1:02:05] this over and over throughout his
[1:02:07] ministry that no man can come to me
[1:02:09] except the Father which sent me draw him
[1:02:12] and I will raise him up in the last day
[1:02:16] amen uh the word there draw him actually
[1:02:19] means to drag off amen by an inward
[1:02:23] power and isn't that powerful it's so
[1:02:25] much different than what we would think
[1:02:27] that if we if we could work our way into
[1:02:29] this if we could do it somehow amen it
[1:02:32] be done but do you recognize that this
[1:02:34] is not at all that way this is a work of
[1:02:37] the grace of almighty God for a seed
[1:02:40] that has been ordained before the world
[1:02:42] has ever begun the Rapture is for those
[1:02:45] who are in the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:02:48] the Lamb's Book of Life is not names
[1:02:50] being added to it and it's not names
[1:02:52] being taken from it but it's those that
[1:02:54] are already elected upon it amen now
[1:02:57] this is a dragging off a seizing a
[1:02:59] kidnapping of those who have their names
[1:03:02] already written in that book I want to
[1:03:04] start up by saying this brother Branham
[1:03:06] says this we believe there will be a
[1:03:08] Rapture and all Christians believe that
[1:03:11] the Bible readers that pair will be a
[1:03:14] Rapture Amen brother Brandon believe
[1:03:16] there's a Rapture I believe there's a
[1:03:17] Rapture and anybody that believes the
[1:03:19] Bible believes there's going to be a
[1:03:21] Rapture now there's a lot of people with
[1:03:23] a lot of ideas and brother Adam says it
[1:03:25] like this I'm not up here trying to just
[1:03:27] say something I think that's going to uh
[1:03:29] maybe please the people he said but I'm
[1:03:32] going to take a different Avenue and
[1:03:33] I've always loved this paragraph 30. he
[1:03:36] said I'm going to take a different
[1:03:37] Avenue and boy many Bible teachers will
[1:03:39] approach the Rapture of the church he
[1:03:42] said or the catching away he was going
[1:03:44] to approach it differently now if you
[1:03:46] think about this amen since the time
[1:03:48] that Paul wrote about the Rapture in
[1:03:50] first Thessalonians 4 Paul said it's
[1:03:53] according to the word of the Lord I say
[1:03:55] unto you by the word of the Lord which
[1:03:57] he's speaking of Revelation because
[1:03:58] there's nothing in the Old Testament
[1:04:00] that actually speaks about the Rapture
[1:04:03] per se but but Paul is putting together
[1:04:06] Elijah and Enoch and the resurrection
[1:04:09] and he's taken all that together in a
[1:04:11] revelation and putting it together and
[1:04:13] saying I say unto you by the word of the
[1:04:15] Lord then then again in the book of
[1:04:17] Corinthians he'll call it a mystery so
[1:04:20] what we're looking at then is that that
[1:04:22] Paul is teaching this in scripture but
[1:04:25] from the time of Paul unto the time of
[1:04:27] William Branham what we have is a lot of
[1:04:29] different ideas being spoken about
[1:04:32] something amen without an understanding
[1:04:34] of what they're talking about so all
[1:04:36] these ideas the root bases of them come
[1:04:39] from what Paul said but this
[1:04:41] denomination took it this way and that
[1:04:43] denomination took it another way but
[1:04:45] according to Malachi chapter 4 the Bible
[1:04:48] said the Lord would return the children
[1:04:50] back to the faith of their Apostolic
[1:04:53] fathers or the Pentecostal fathers uh
[1:04:55] Revelations 10 and verse 7 says the
[1:04:58] seventh angel which is the seventh angel
[1:05:00] of the laodicean Church of Revelations 3
[1:05:03] the seven star are of Revelations 1 that
[1:05:06] his ministry would be to unfold The
[1:05:09] Mystery of the Bible in the end time
[1:05:12] which would restore what Paul said in
[1:05:15] the beginning somebody said well it
[1:05:16] might be something different than Paul
[1:05:18] had then Paul was wrong when he said if
[1:05:21] an angel would come from heaven and say
[1:05:22] any other thing then what I have said
[1:05:25] let him be a curse so Paul had put the
[1:05:28] Revelation there now just as Jesus amen
[1:05:31] come out of the scripture he began as
[1:05:33] the woman's seed in Genesis 3 and then
[1:05:36] became Abraham's seed in Genesis 12 and
[1:05:38] Genesis 15. it was only an unfolding of
[1:05:42] the original word that was spoken what
[1:05:44] Paul spoke originally was not fully made
[1:05:47] known or revealed in the days of Paul
[1:05:49] but under the Seven Seals there would
[1:05:52] come a full revelation of the rapturing
[1:05:54] of the church which would be the
[1:05:57] ministry of the seventh angel or Elijah
[1:05:59] which by Grace we have today by Divine
[1:06:03] vindication we know that man's name is
[1:06:06] William Miriam Branham there's no
[1:06:09] question in our heart God has Vindicated
[1:06:11] this ministry and proved it to us and he
[1:06:15] had a right to take a different avenue
[1:06:16] than the Baptist did than the
[1:06:18] Pentecostals did than the Lutheran did
[1:06:20] amen and he took an Avenue come on
[1:06:23] Church The Avenues of denomination would
[1:06:25] not lead you to the Rapture in other
[1:06:27] words they're not uncovering a path
[1:06:29] that's going to lead you to the Rapture
[1:06:32] but if you'll stay with a message of
[1:06:34] this hour the prophet of God has
[1:06:36] revealed a path that will lead this
[1:06:39] church back to an even condition and we
[1:06:43] will walk from one dimension to another
[1:06:45] on the Avenue that has been preached by
[1:06:47] the message of Malachi 4. somebody said
[1:06:50] brother Wayne this guy's going this way
[1:06:52] and this guy's going this way which way
[1:06:54] are you going to go I'm going to stay
[1:06:56] with the message of Malachi 4. I'm going
[1:06:59] to walk the path that William Branham
[1:07:02] taught us to walk that's where I'm
[1:07:03] walking that's where I'm staying and you
[1:07:06] say preacher amen what about things that
[1:07:08] are coming up well by God's grace we
[1:07:11] took the last corner of redemption amen
[1:07:13] justification Made A Way sanctification
[1:07:16] we made a corner didn't we baptism the
[1:07:18] Holy Ghost we made a corner back there
[1:07:20] in Azusa but then the word returned to
[1:07:22] the church and the last Corner was made
[1:07:25] and I say today that there is no there's
[1:07:28] nothing between the bride and the
[1:07:30] Rapture today I don't know when it'll
[1:07:31] take place but I know this when we get
[1:07:34] there we'll get there by the word of the
[1:07:36] Lord according to Malachi 4 in the last
[1:07:39] days now I know there's going to come
[1:07:42] something to upset this there always is
[1:07:46] when the prophet preaches the Rapture he
[1:07:48] begins by saying know this verse
[1:07:50] scoffers shall come in the last day he
[1:07:53] spends the first 20 minutes of the
[1:07:54] Rapture take talking about scoffers and
[1:07:57] he's showing you the reason that there
[1:08:00] will become scoffers is because they're
[1:08:02] looking back to what denominations have
[1:08:05] said about the Rapture so when the truth
[1:08:08] on the Rapture came they have all these
[1:08:11] different doctors and Dr so-and-so said
[1:08:13] this and this man said this and this
[1:08:15] professor said this and so they're going
[1:08:17] to scoff at this man with such a
[1:08:20] low-grade education having this idea of
[1:08:23] the Rapture that's been ministered to
[1:08:25] him by an Angel so the prophet of God
[1:08:28] said the scripture says as it was in the
[1:08:31] days of Moses the scripture says they'll
[1:08:33] come in the last days again Janice and
[1:08:35] Chambers wished Moses so with these men
[1:08:39] of reprobate mind concerning truth
[1:08:42] impersonations and everything to upset
[1:08:45] these people now notice this scoffer
[1:08:47] shall come that's the book of Peter
[1:08:49] right now we're in the book of Timothy
[1:08:51] so he shows the scoffers in the book of
[1:08:53] Peter are also the impersonators in the
[1:08:56] book of Timothy now somebody said how is
[1:08:59] impersonation how is that scoffing I'll
[1:09:01] tell you how it is in the days of Moses
[1:09:03] when God sent Moses in the first Exodus
[1:09:06] to take I've prepared people into the
[1:09:09] out of the Egypt you remember what
[1:09:11] happened Moses's first sign is he throw
[1:09:13] down a staff and it turned into a
[1:09:15] serpent now he had done that in the
[1:09:17] presence of God and God sinning to
[1:09:19] deliver the people and I'm sure Moses
[1:09:21] thought if I throw down this staff it
[1:09:24] turns to a serpent everybody's going to
[1:09:25] follow me and out we're going to go but
[1:09:27] as soon as he threw down his staff amen
[1:09:30] there was some magicians stood up beside
[1:09:32] him and did the same very thing and this
[1:09:35] is what hardened the heart of pharaoh
[1:09:37] and it devalued what Moses was doing and
[1:09:41] made it look like any cheap magician
[1:09:43] trick so the impersonators actually were
[1:09:46] scoffing and devaluing what the prophet
[1:09:49] was doing and it reduced the value of
[1:09:52] that sign that was being made so the
[1:09:54] Bible tells us that Pharaoh's heart was
[1:09:57] hardened by the scoffing see amen he
[1:10:00] didn't believe it because anybody could
[1:10:01] do it now the prophet is clear and I
[1:10:04] don't want to take a lot of time but I
[1:10:05] think it's powerful he said where did
[1:10:07] those uh he said where did those other
[1:10:08] where did those other sticks end up he
[1:10:11] said Moses is sticks ate them is that
[1:10:13] right they swallowed them up amen it's
[1:10:16] like he said there was a group of Ohio
[1:10:17] ministers wrote me the other day and he
[1:10:19] said they got on to me for preaching
[1:10:21] amen predestinated sons and he said they
[1:10:24] said well that we've seen guys that were
[1:10:25] saved and they went and done this and
[1:10:27] we've seen guys that were saved and done
[1:10:29] that how can you say that when a man was
[1:10:31] saved he's always saved and brother Bram
[1:10:33] said well see he said but where did they
[1:10:35] end up at he said there was an original
[1:10:37] before that was the impersonation he
[1:10:40] said but you're looking at the
[1:10:41] impersonation saying there's no real
[1:10:43] thing he said but see the real the
[1:10:45] empire impersonation is swallowed up in
[1:10:48] the real do you hear what I'm saying to
[1:10:50] you amen the the real was first the
[1:10:54] other is only an impersonation of the
[1:10:56] real but it's given to cause a mocking
[1:10:59] and an intimidation so you won't preach
[1:11:02] the message every hour it'll make people
[1:11:04] back away from believing the message and
[1:11:07] devalue the word of a prophet amen but I
[1:11:09] thank God Amen that if the Satan's gonna
[1:11:12] throw something in the way of God God
[1:11:14] has another level for the church and
[1:11:17] every time the devil ever tried to
[1:11:19] follow God he just swallowed him up and
[1:11:22] brother Adam says see what it is all
[1:11:23] these things but this Rapture which is
[1:11:25] coming to pass anything that God has in
[1:11:28] the line of his word there's always
[1:11:29] something to come out and upset that
[1:11:32] it's Satan's purpose to do it
[1:11:36] it's Satan's purpose to do it see now
[1:11:40] watch in in anything too hard for the
[1:11:42] Lord Brother man says sometimes when
[1:11:44] things are going wrong We Know by Nature
[1:11:47] it's the darkest before the day and many
[1:11:50] times we see during disastrous things
[1:11:52] like that especially to Believers we
[1:11:55] must bear this in our mind it's Satan
[1:11:58] trying to block the blessing that's on
[1:12:01] the road listen why is all these isms
[1:12:04] rise up in the message of the hour and
[1:12:06] to your point I honestly almost text you
[1:12:08] today beautiful thought on delay it
[1:12:10] allowed time for the seeds all to come
[1:12:12] out why is all the isms why is everybody
[1:12:15] seem like they have their own Direction
[1:12:17] now it's either they're in one ditch or
[1:12:20] the other amen half of the I'm not
[1:12:22] trying to be a a a critical it just
[1:12:25] seems like people are one ditch or the
[1:12:27] other what happened to just preaching
[1:12:29] the message of the hour what happened to
[1:12:31] just saying what the prophet said and
[1:12:33] then let the grace of God lead the
[1:12:35] church into the into the Rapture see
[1:12:37] sometimes amen it seems like amen that
[1:12:40] Satan is doing these things to brought
[1:12:43] the blessing to get the people's minds
[1:12:45] on this thought or on that thought or is
[1:12:48] this guy riders that guy right amen I
[1:12:50] think we ought to just all stand up
[1:12:52] together and say we're all wrong the
[1:12:54] message is Right amen we're all wrong
[1:12:57] the message is right let's just follow
[1:12:59] the message of the hour amen I have
[1:13:02] young ministers ask me I said brother
[1:13:04] Wayne what do you think about this
[1:13:05] teaching what do you think about that
[1:13:07] teaching I said I think if you'll study
[1:13:09] the message and just preach the message
[1:13:10] what God reveals you'll be a blessed man
[1:13:12] that's what I believe and I know that we
[1:13:14] are to know scoffers are coming we ought
[1:13:17] to know that it's in the scripture that
[1:13:19] there's men that have been raised up to
[1:13:21] intimidate people by the mocking of the
[1:13:24] truth they'll scoff it they'll mock it
[1:13:26] they'll make fun of it and by doing so
[1:13:28] they're intimidating you to not follow
[1:13:31] after it that's exactly y'all know what
[1:13:33] I'm talking about and the funny thing is
[1:13:35] is look at those that are talking it's
[1:13:37] funny Tanya sometime ago Chris and I
[1:13:39] were down at the mall and we're walking
[1:13:40] down the mall and I see two old girls
[1:13:42] standing over there I shouldn't say it
[1:13:43] like that two women standing there and
[1:13:45] there and they they look like they
[1:13:47] walked through a jewelry store with a
[1:13:48] magnet on they got earrings from the top
[1:13:51] I mean they just pierced all up and the
[1:13:53] hair colored weird and hey man one of
[1:13:55] them I better not get into all this but
[1:13:57] anyhow they ain't got enough clothes on
[1:13:58] the water shotgun and and they're
[1:14:00] standing it's a horrible sight and I'm
[1:14:03] standing off to the side kind of waiting
[1:14:05] on my wife to come out of the store and
[1:14:06] when she come out both of them just
[1:14:08] turned and looked at her like she was
[1:14:09] the weirdest thing that had ever hit the
[1:14:12] planet and I thought that is the oddest
[1:14:14] thing to me that is looking at that is
[1:14:16] weird
[1:14:17] somebody changed normal I mean your
[1:14:19] normal used to be a certain way and
[1:14:22] somebody changed normal but now you're
[1:14:24] going to Market to intimidate people to
[1:14:27] not follow after the word of God well
[1:14:28] I'm not intimidated
[1:14:30] I'm not intimidated you can mock me you
[1:14:33] can mop this message you can mock the
[1:14:34] way of life I am not intimidated by
[1:14:37] mocking amen I will believe this message
[1:14:40] see because the church the bride the
[1:14:42] Rapture is a revelation to her it's been
[1:14:45] revealed to her the Revelation the true
[1:14:47] bride of Christ will be waiting for this
[1:14:49] revelation of the Rapture now it is a
[1:14:52] Rapture of the Revelation we'll be
[1:14:54] waiting for the revelation of the
[1:14:55] Rapture now I don't mean to intrude on
[1:14:57] anybody's ideas but I'll just say this
[1:14:59] amen if you're studying the message and
[1:15:02] you want to know what the revelation of
[1:15:03] the Rapture is brother Ram says here in
[1:15:05] paragraph 65 we're waiting on the
[1:15:08] Revelation and many people stopped right
[1:15:10] there and now they're still waiting on
[1:15:13] the Revelation if you will just continue
[1:15:15] reading a couple Pages he takes first
[1:15:17] Thessalonians 4 and divides the Rapture
[1:15:20] into three parts a shout of voice of
[1:15:22] trump the Rapture Revelation is the
[1:15:25] message is the shout the people become
[1:15:28] the voice of the message by moving into
[1:15:31] the Flesh and then when that flesh has
[1:15:34] been brought by the word there's a
[1:15:36] carrying away of the Bride it's a shout
[1:15:39] it's a voice it's a trump right it's the
[1:15:43] Revelation it's a revelation and that
[1:15:45] Revelation is Faith now you cannot have
[1:15:47] Revelation without it being faith faith
[1:15:49] is a revelation because it's something
[1:15:51] that is revealed to you faith is a
[1:15:54] revelation faith is something that's
[1:15:56] been revealed to you like it was to
[1:15:58] Abraham that you could call anything
[1:16:00] contrary to what had been called
[1:16:02] revealed as though it was not see Faith
[1:16:04] that's what faith is it's the revelation
[1:16:07] of God the church is built upon the
[1:16:10] revelation of the entire body
[1:16:13] it's faith faith is a revelation
[1:16:15] somebody said well brother Wayne Amen I
[1:16:17] think there's a revelation coming
[1:16:18] brother banham says it like this he said
[1:16:20] now listen he said the first poll was a
[1:16:23] healing the second pull is a prophesying
[1:16:25] the third pull is the opening of the
[1:16:28] word the Mysteries that are revealed now
[1:16:31] there is no more higher order to reveal
[1:16:34] the word than a prophet and the only way
[1:16:36] a prophet can be Vindicated is Bible
[1:16:38] word and remember the opening of them
[1:16:40] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth
[1:16:42] that's been sealed in the word so either
[1:16:45] we have received the Revelation for
[1:16:47] Rapture or we're waiting for a prophet
[1:16:50] to come and give it well I don't believe
[1:16:51] we're waiting for a prophet to return I
[1:16:54] believe it's already in the word
[1:16:57] amen now somebody I better explain this
[1:17:00] because I can feel it somebody said well
[1:17:01] brother Wayne how in the world could you
[1:17:02] get that you remember when God came to
[1:17:04] Elijah he gave him three things didn't
[1:17:06] he he commissioned him to do three
[1:17:08] things how many knows what Elijah did he
[1:17:10] only did one of those things and then he
[1:17:13] anointed Elisha's the only part he did
[1:17:15] and Elisha fulfilled the next part and
[1:17:17] Elisha himself didn't even fulfill the
[1:17:19] next part somebody he anointed went and
[1:17:21] done it himself so but it all came to
[1:17:24] Elijah and all of it came to a prophet
[1:17:27] but the prophet might not even be here
[1:17:29] when it is fulfilled but it's came to
[1:17:32] him and now it's coming into the Church
[1:17:34] of the Living God now this Rapture we're
[1:17:36] talking about is only for the bride the
[1:17:39] Rapture other people are talking about
[1:17:40] is probably for anybody the Rapture
[1:17:42] we're talking about is for the bride is
[1:17:45] that right the bride the one that's
[1:17:48] going to be in the Rapture is nothing
[1:17:49] but the bride the elected ones the
[1:17:52] foreknown of God from the beginning the
[1:17:54] father's spiritual genes now that's how
[1:17:57] God's Gonna kidnap somebody he's taking
[1:18:00] his own kids he's taking it it's not
[1:18:02] somebody else's son it's God's son that
[1:18:05] he's taken it's his own children and
[1:18:07] he's taken this is the problem many
[1:18:09] people around the message get caught up
[1:18:11] in this because the Rapture is only for
[1:18:13] the bride so then they get to thinking
[1:18:15] salvation is only for the bride that's
[1:18:17] the problem there's a lot of people
[1:18:19] that'll be saved has nothing to do with
[1:18:21] this Rapture but the Rapture is for the
[1:18:24] elected and the Bible said the rest of
[1:18:26] the Dead live not for a thousand years
[1:18:29] and then they'll come up in the great
[1:18:31] white judgment right and then been
[1:18:33] judged out of the books and many of them
[1:18:35] will be saved Matthew 25 said they'll be
[1:18:37] separated left and right even people who
[1:18:40] were never had a new birth will be there
[1:18:42] because they were good
[1:18:44] to the Brethren right so there's a lot
[1:18:47] of people saved that don't even know
[1:18:48] about the message so don't treat them
[1:18:50] like that they're they're junk they
[1:18:52] might be a penny in your silver dollar
[1:18:54] don't worry about them being a penny
[1:18:55] just thank God he made you a silver
[1:18:57] dollar this this focus on the idea of
[1:19:00] what you are but if you hear somebody in
[1:19:01] the message preaching it almost sounds
[1:19:03] like we don't believe anybody else will
[1:19:04] be saved well we really don't believe
[1:19:06] that or at least anybody that studies
[1:19:07] brother Branham don't really believe
[1:19:09] that because he said the blanket covers
[1:19:11] a lot more than you think it does
[1:19:13] right but we're talking about the
[1:19:15] Rapture the Rapture amen somebody said
[1:19:18] well what amen there's actually in the
[1:19:20] mouth of three Witnesses let everything
[1:19:22] be established there's three that bear
[1:19:23] record Amen in the Old Testament we have
[1:19:26] Enoch amen remember we have Elijah and
[1:19:30] then we have Jesus so there's three
[1:19:31] raptures in the Old Testament now I want
[1:19:34] to maybe say this there's three of them
[1:19:36] and and the Rapture in the Old Testament
[1:19:38] can I just take one of them for a little
[1:19:41] while tonight Enoch is our type I I love
[1:19:45] Enoch Enoch is a tremendous character if
[1:19:48] you like to study Enoch how many knows
[1:19:50] Enoch is a type of the raptured church
[1:19:53] in the end time
[1:19:54] sure Enoch is a type of the Rapture
[1:19:57] church now if he's going to be my type I
[1:20:00] want to know what does the man's name
[1:20:02] mean if he's my type you know the
[1:20:05] prophet said you'll never outlive your
[1:20:06] type so what kind of type is he his very
[1:20:10] name has a meaning so brother Amos we
[1:20:12] ask the question what does the name
[1:20:14] Enoch mean it means dedicated trained
[1:20:18] and disciplined now that's pretty
[1:20:21] powerful isn't it amen the very name of
[1:20:23] Enoch means dedicated trained and
[1:20:27] disciplined amen this bride will be
[1:20:30] dedicated to a message trained by a
[1:20:33] message and disciplined by a message now
[1:20:36] that'd be about a three-hour sermon if I
[1:20:38] had time to preach it tonight but
[1:20:40] dedicated trained and disciplined
[1:20:42] dedication time y'all heard the sermon
[1:20:44] brother man preached dedication time
[1:20:46] that was the time you built the temple
[1:20:48] there's a Time the word come in the
[1:20:49] temple amen there's a Time the temple is
[1:20:51] dedicated right now we're here
[1:20:54] dedicating ourselves to a message that's
[1:20:56] already come we're not trying to wait
[1:20:58] for a message we're not trying to create
[1:21:00] a message we're dedicating our lies to a
[1:21:04] message and we're disciplined by it amen
[1:21:07] and we're trained by it I I'd like to
[1:21:09] preach a whole sermon right now
[1:21:10] dedicated trained and disciplined
[1:21:12] training y'all know what I'm talking
[1:21:13] about child training
[1:21:15] for the placing of sons that's exactly
[1:21:18] what the prophet says now in Genesis
[1:21:20] chapter 5 we'll read this in the 18th
[1:21:23] verse and Jared lived 162 years and he
[1:21:26] begot Enoch and Jared lived after he
[1:21:28] began to Enoch 800 years and begot sons
[1:21:31] and daughters and all the days of Jared
[1:21:34] with 960 in two years and he died and he
[1:21:37] not lived 60 in five years and begot
[1:21:39] Methuselah and Enoch walked with God
[1:21:43] after he begot Methuselah 300 years and
[1:21:47] he begot Sons and Daughters now that's
[1:21:49] an important thing to me he begots Sons
[1:21:51] and Daughters 300 years of life and all
[1:21:54] the days of Enoch were
[1:21:56] 365 years and Enoch walked with God
[1:22:00] that's the second time that it says this
[1:22:02] and Enoch walked with God and he was not
[1:22:07] for God took him that's a pretty good
[1:22:10] way of saying it isn't it God took him
[1:22:12] to the definition of what we believe
[1:22:15] Rapture is God took him amen he was
[1:22:18] walking with God and God took him he
[1:22:20] caught him he seized him he meant he
[1:22:23] stole him away out of the middle of
[1:22:25] things because he's your type amen he
[1:22:28] took him amen don't you think God is
[1:22:30] snatching this bride out of the hands of
[1:22:33] this evil and wicked generation he
[1:22:36] snatched you like a like a man snatches
[1:22:38] a child out of a fire God has snatched
[1:22:41] us out of laodicea he's snatching us out
[1:22:43] out of denominationalism God is
[1:22:45] snatching now you've been leaving one
[1:22:47] take him one thank God he's taking the
[1:22:49] church amen he walked with God and God
[1:22:53] took him amen and God took him in
[1:22:56] Hebrews 11 and 5 New Testament Paul
[1:22:58] talks of this figure and he said by
[1:23:01] faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:23:03] should not see death now there's brother
[1:23:05] Adam's Revelation the Rapture is a
[1:23:07] revelation by faith Enoch was translated
[1:23:10] that he should not see death and was not
[1:23:14] found because God had translated him and
[1:23:18] before his translation I got to say that
[1:23:21] again before his translation he had this
[1:23:25] testimony that he pleased God what's the
[1:23:27] next verse without faith it is
[1:23:29] impossible to please God so whatever
[1:23:32] Enoch needed for translation he had it
[1:23:36] before translation is that right he had
[1:23:39] it before translation and whatever the
[1:23:40] bride needs I'm talking about your type
[1:23:42] whatever the bride I need she will have
[1:23:44] to have it before translation she has to
[1:23:48] have faith before translation how many
[1:23:50] knows that Jesus always done that which
[1:23:52] pleased the father brother Brown said
[1:23:55] God's going to raise up a child until he
[1:23:57] gets one that pleases the father now
[1:23:59] we're talking about adoption aren't we
[1:24:01] so Enoch's faith is Jesus Faith it's
[1:24:04] also abrahamic faith and that is the
[1:24:07] faith that is the faith that God is
[1:24:09] restored in this age unto the message of
[1:24:12] Malachi 4. if you don't have faith where
[1:24:14] does faith come Faith cometh by the
[1:24:16] hearing and by the hearing of the word
[1:24:18] of God wraps your faith is not coming
[1:24:20] through CNN Rapture faith is not coming
[1:24:23] through Fox News Rapture faith is not
[1:24:26] coming through your local denominational
[1:24:28] Church Rapture faith is a revelation
[1:24:30] that is released under the message of
[1:24:33] this hour and by God's grace there is a
[1:24:35] five-fold Ministry and it's been raised
[1:24:38] up under this messenger I know we're in
[1:24:40] a generation they don't even want us to
[1:24:42] preach anymore I get it but let me say
[1:24:44] this amen we finally have a group of
[1:24:46] ministers that have something to preach
[1:24:48] they finally have a message to preach
[1:24:50] amen I believe in all of my heart that
[1:24:53] this bride is perfected under the word
[1:24:56] preached in the hour of the that we're
[1:24:59] leaving today without faith it is
[1:25:01] impossible to please brother man said
[1:25:02] God will keep raising one till he gets
[1:25:04] one that pleases God Amen what is it
[1:25:06] it's a pleasing that this Rapture is a
[1:25:10] revelation he had it before his
[1:25:14] translation
[1:25:16] he had it before his translation I think
[1:25:19] that's a powerful thing church he had it
[1:25:22] before his translation I'll get to the
[1:25:25] point in the morning Jude 1 and 14 Jude
[1:25:27] writes of Enoch and said Enoch also the
[1:25:30] seventh from Adam prophesied now watch
[1:25:32] this Enoch the seventh from Adam now
[1:25:34] there's your timing of the church Enoch
[1:25:38] is the seventh from Adam we are the
[1:25:41] seventh from the second Adam that first
[1:25:43] Enoch took the Rapture being the seventh
[1:25:46] showing that allowed to see a church
[1:25:48] takes the Rapture is that right the
[1:25:50] bride comes out of the loudest seal
[1:25:52] church you can read Revelations 3 as
[1:25:54] well as I and the Bible tells you the
[1:25:56] condition of laodicea and John has no
[1:25:59] way out of laodicea until he hears the
[1:26:01] voice and says come up here John and the
[1:26:04] door opened up in heaven it was the word
[1:26:06] that gave him a way out watch this every
[1:26:09] other age they went from one age to
[1:26:11] another brother Mark they just kept
[1:26:12] changing ages but when it come to the
[1:26:15] seventh age there wasn't anywhere to go
[1:26:16] all remember Revelations 18 4 called you
[1:26:19] out of laodicea but you can't go out to
[1:26:22] another age the bride's going out of
[1:26:25] layout to see it into the rapturing of
[1:26:27] the church amen I believe I believe this
[1:26:29] message is calling the bride to change
[1:26:31] bodies we're not being called to go to
[1:26:34] another church age we're not being
[1:26:36] called Amen to just build another church
[1:26:38] or build a kingdom or just preach a
[1:26:40] message we're being called to walk with
[1:26:43] God and our bodies might be changed in
[1:26:46] the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:26:48] we're the seventh from Adam the second
[1:26:50] item showing us we are at the time I'm
[1:26:54] Vindicated tonight to say I believe this
[1:26:57] is a generation to do it
[1:26:59] the timing is here the message is here
[1:27:02] we are on the scene hey can I say this
[1:27:05] Sister Kim the troubles here the
[1:27:08] scoffer's in place right they're
[1:27:10] everywhere scoffers are everywhere I
[1:27:12] meant that the scriptures are true
[1:27:14] everybody's in their place well the
[1:27:16] bride getting in position is the time of
[1:27:19] change y'all know the adoption the
[1:27:21] fullness of adoption is the change of
[1:27:22] the body right it's the fullness of it
[1:27:24] it's the change of the body Enoch the
[1:27:27] seventh from Adam prophesied to these
[1:27:29] things preached
[1:27:31] these things
[1:27:32] prophesied preached these things isn't
[1:27:36] that powerful the man was preaching the
[1:27:38] Rapture Revelation before he changed
[1:27:41] he said the Lord cometh with ten
[1:27:43] thousand of his Saints if you'd like to
[1:27:45] study the prophet brother random over
[1:27:47] and over said when Jesus went down and
[1:27:49] preached the souls in prison according
[1:27:50] to Visions before he ascended he
[1:27:53] descended to preached the souls in
[1:27:54] prison he said Jesus told them he said
[1:27:57] why didn't you receive me when Enoch
[1:27:59] preached of me
[1:28:01] why didn't you take me when Enoch was
[1:28:03] preaching to preacher what are you
[1:28:04] talking about he's our type scoffers
[1:28:06] shall come in the last day they will
[1:28:08] hear the message of the Rapture and
[1:28:10] scoff at it and go into judgment the
[1:28:13] same as the days of Noah Enoch preached
[1:28:17] the Rapture Revelation and they scoffed
[1:28:20] at it and went into the floods of Noah
[1:28:23] they went into the Judgment rather at an
[1:28:26] end to the Rapture of the church Enoch
[1:28:29] had the Revelation before he was changed
[1:28:35] it's a preacher what are you preaching
[1:28:36] on I'm telling you if it's your type the
[1:28:39] message has give it to us
[1:28:41] it's it's it's here
[1:28:44] and Satan's trying to distract you with
[1:28:46] everything in the world to get your eyes
[1:28:48] off that it's here it's it's right here
[1:28:50] it's here the Revelation is here it's
[1:28:52] already in the books it's already there
[1:28:54] and he's trying to get us to look this
[1:28:56] way and look this way and look at that
[1:28:58] and this is happening that's happening
[1:28:59] why that's happening amen but there's
[1:29:01] somebody going to keep their eyes
[1:29:02] somebody's going to walk somebody's
[1:29:05] going to dedicate somebody's going to
[1:29:07] translate because of the grace of God
[1:29:09] Enoch of course is a type brother Madam
[1:29:12] I'm just going to read a couple of his
[1:29:13] quotes here when we've seen Enoch was
[1:29:15] taken up he said Noah it was time to
[1:29:17] start he knew that would be a sign at
[1:29:19] the beginning of the end of the near
[1:29:21] Enoch of course was a type of the
[1:29:23] Rapture church if you take Enoch's life
[1:29:25] Enoch actually he he actually takes a
[1:29:29] Rapture 57 years after that Adam died
[1:29:32] somebody didn't like me saying that the
[1:29:34] other day that Enoch took a Rapture so
[1:29:35] I'll just call it translation I don't
[1:29:37] know folks are different aren't they hey
[1:29:39] man I'll call it translation so if
[1:29:41] somebody hears this they'll know that I
[1:29:43] was well corrected you know but he took
[1:29:45] a translation amen so but it happened 57
[1:29:49] years after the death of Adam so can I
[1:29:52] just say it to you like this amen
[1:29:55] Adam and Enoch were on the earth 300
[1:29:58] years together
[1:30:00] can you imagine the conversations
[1:30:04] can you imagine here is one man that
[1:30:07] walked out of the Garden of Eden and
[1:30:10] here's a man gonna walk back in
[1:30:13] here's a man in the same generation
[1:30:16] one atom came out
[1:30:19] and Enoch's gonna walk back in
[1:30:22] he's going to walk into immortality are
[1:30:25] you hearing me at the same the state
[1:30:27] they're the live at the same time God
[1:30:30] was testifying somebody came out but
[1:30:32] somebody's going to go in this bride
[1:30:35] amen she's not returning back to the
[1:30:37] Garden of Eden beaten and broken come on
[1:30:40] she's not returning that way there's
[1:30:42] been a blood that this bride can walk
[1:30:44] back into the Garden of Eden in victory
[1:30:47] robed in the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:30:51] I got to thinking about the other day
[1:30:52] and y'all got to forgive me I'm an old
[1:30:53] hillbilly and I get to thinking about a
[1:30:55] couple guys walking along game Trails
[1:30:57] you know and talking and fellowshipping
[1:30:59] and walking along and and Enoch's
[1:31:00] Walking with God
[1:31:02] and I you know I can just imagine him
[1:31:05] phoning uh Adam uh or maybe texting him
[1:31:08] or whatever it means a devices they had
[1:31:10] in that generation uh it was a pretty
[1:31:13] civilized place at that time uh I don't
[1:31:15] know what means they had you know but
[1:31:17] I'll say this can you imagine them
[1:31:19] getting together and Enoch explaining to
[1:31:21] Adam what experience he had with that
[1:31:25] Pillar of Fire that afternoon and he's
[1:31:27] asking him is this something like it was
[1:31:29] when you were back there in the garden
[1:31:32] can you imagine the questions of Enoch
[1:31:34] to Adam about how was The Fellowship
[1:31:37] there is it something like what's
[1:31:39] happening here with me
[1:31:41] hey man I I I got to think about this
[1:31:43] you know
[1:31:44] now this is unveindicated this is just
[1:31:47] one Lawson so y'all don't have to you
[1:31:49] don't have to carry it home you can
[1:31:50] forget it but I got to think about this
[1:31:52] I got to think about how how Enoch and
[1:31:55] Adam can you imagine maybe maybe Enoch
[1:31:58] says to Adams Adam you know we've been
[1:32:00] walking by this same place uh for days
[1:32:03] the Lord just keeps walking me by this
[1:32:05] same little little dim Trail heads up
[1:32:07] over the mountain there and you know
[1:32:08] every time we walk by there I see the
[1:32:10] Lord just kind of looks over that way
[1:32:12] you know he just keeps looking over that
[1:32:14] way what did that path look like that
[1:32:16] y'all took out of Eden what was the what
[1:32:19] was the trail what was it like can you
[1:32:21] imagine he he could literally describe
[1:32:23] to him the very thing that had happened
[1:32:26] and how it happened and what took place
[1:32:28] Enoch's Revelation was greater than you
[1:32:30] think
[1:32:32] Enoch had the revelation of the Garden
[1:32:35] of Eden he knew what happened come on
[1:32:37] church he can I just say it he had the
[1:32:41] whole thing
[1:32:42] right the bride will have the entire
[1:32:45] story before she changes Dimensions the
[1:32:50] message has gave us you'd even know what
[1:32:52] color eyes that she had
[1:32:54] who else knows that Eve was
[1:32:56] blonde-haired in blue eyed who knows it
[1:32:58] the world thinks she was a nephe Android
[1:33:00] said the most beautiful woman in the
[1:33:02] world
[1:33:04] you've been told so much in this
[1:33:06] generation
[1:33:07] you've been told so much of course Enoch
[1:33:10] is your type now the prophet of God said
[1:33:12] Enoch was a type of the real message of
[1:33:15] translation of the church
[1:33:16] brother Brandon says it like this he
[1:33:19] said God wanted to show a type how he
[1:33:22] could do it if he didn't want Enoch to
[1:33:24] die so he made a translation for him he
[1:33:27] just made a Rapture for him in case that
[1:33:30] brother's watching I want to read this
[1:33:31] for you he made a Rapture for him
[1:33:34] God had to do it in order to make a type
[1:33:37] out of Enoch
[1:33:39] in other words can you imagine this God
[1:33:41] God picture you by the market he said
[1:33:42] look I've got a bride coming to the end
[1:33:44] and I'm going to I'm going to Rapture
[1:33:46] her before they endiluvian or before the
[1:33:48] great fire falls upon the Earth and I'm
[1:33:50] going to Rapture her but to do it she's
[1:33:52] a word bride so she can't do anything
[1:33:54] that's not in the word so I'm going to
[1:33:56] use you and I'm going to translate you
[1:33:57] and you'll be the type I'll use in the
[1:33:59] end because she will have to fulfill
[1:34:01] something in the word this bride don't
[1:34:03] do things that's not in the word folks
[1:34:05] everything this bride does is in the
[1:34:07] word every step of this bride is already
[1:34:11] in the word of God we are not a headless
[1:34:13] Church come on we're not walking around
[1:34:16] without a head wondering how to handle
[1:34:18] this and how to handle this and how to
[1:34:19] handle this we've had a message among us
[1:34:21] we know how to walk we know how to talk
[1:34:24] we know how to have church we know what
[1:34:27] should be done and shouldn't be
[1:34:31] y'all know I'm telling you the truth
[1:34:34] he was a type of the raptured church
[1:34:36] Enoch want with God and had a testimony
[1:34:39] that he pleased God I like this brother
[1:34:40] bam said Enoch's whole body was
[1:34:43] transformed to make a type
[1:34:45] his whole body was transformed to make a
[1:34:48] type Enoch was a prophet ah
[1:34:51] isn't that powerful Enoch was a prophet
[1:34:54] now I had to tell you that to tell you
[1:34:55] this he knew he was a type
[1:34:58] so somebody's asked me said well how did
[1:35:00] he not know he was the type he was a
[1:35:02] prophet
[1:35:03] so he was saying
[1:35:06] he was saying the revelation of the end
[1:35:09] time and he put it in the Revelation he
[1:35:12] was preaching back there before the
[1:35:14] flood amen I I think Enoch seen all the
[1:35:17] way to the new heavens and the Earth
[1:35:18] I think he sing the whole thing you say
[1:35:21] what are you talking about Enoch knew it
[1:35:22] that the flood's coming and he had to
[1:35:25] have an example so one afternoon it was
[1:35:27] becoming to him to take a walk it was
[1:35:29] becoming to him that he should take a
[1:35:31] walk with God I think it's beautiful
[1:35:33] somehow that day they changed past
[1:35:34] instead of going around the side of the
[1:35:36] Hill God took him on the King's Highway
[1:35:38] and he just kept walking amen it
[1:35:41] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[1:35:43] brother Adam says it like this he said
[1:35:45] listen he said I see Enoch as he knowed
[1:35:48] it was becoming to him he was a prophet
[1:35:50] he knew what was going to happen so I
[1:35:53] can see him kiss his wife goodbye and
[1:35:55] say darling I'll see you later take up
[1:35:58] his children and kiss them goodbye and
[1:36:00] go down to his marriage son and daughter
[1:36:02] and kiss them goodbye and they said
[1:36:04] where are you going father he said are
[1:36:06] you going for a little walk he said yeah
[1:36:08] I'm going for a little stroll he said
[1:36:11] never took that old familiar path that
[1:36:13] day he took the King's Highway and went
[1:36:15] on to the glory it was becoming to him
[1:36:17] he didn't want to leave
[1:36:20] all right wow he didn't want to leave
[1:36:24] but it was becoming to him to fulfill
[1:36:26] righteousness because he was a type of
[1:36:29] the church today
[1:36:32] he said preacher what are you getting at
[1:36:34] I'm saying that he wasn't a Superman he
[1:36:36] was a normal man
[1:36:39] he had sons and daughters and he lived
[1:36:42] 300 years with a wife
[1:36:46] I'm sorry folks but a man lived 300
[1:36:49] years with the same woman I guarantee
[1:36:51] you that was intense Fellowship
[1:36:54] manly like brother Charlie said about
[1:36:57] her about your mom he said we never had
[1:36:59] a fight one brother Ron said there's an
[1:37:02] intense Fellowship then
[1:37:07] he grew up in the house
[1:37:12] 300 years
[1:37:13] this man was not a Superman he was a
[1:37:15] normal man
[1:37:16] he was like you
[1:37:18] right he had an everyday life
[1:37:22] he's like you he had discussions he had
[1:37:26] issues he had problems he had he had
[1:37:28] blocks he had things that got in his way
[1:37:31] but every day he walked with God
[1:37:35] he every day he walked with God he had a
[1:37:37] normal life
[1:37:38] he had children he had to feed so he
[1:37:40] would have had to have worked
[1:37:42] it's the nature of God they wasn't all
[1:37:44] on vacation back there
[1:37:46] when Adam left the garden God told him
[1:37:48] remember he said you'll earn your living
[1:37:51] by the spread of your sweat of your brow
[1:37:52] so they had to work they had to make a
[1:37:54] living they had to they had to function
[1:37:56] normal life had to live had to y'all
[1:38:00] know what I'm talking about because we
[1:38:01] got this image of Enoch that he just
[1:38:04] strolled out one day and there he went
[1:38:06] away you know he didn't have no troubles
[1:38:08] he didn't have no problems there wasn't
[1:38:10] no situations
[1:38:13] that's not a Biblical image of Enoch at
[1:38:16] all
[1:38:17] you say what do you think he not was
[1:38:19] like a whole lot like you
[1:38:21] he was your type
[1:38:25] he had to overcome he had to struggle
[1:38:27] through he had to shake loose of ideas
[1:38:30] and feelings and he had to die out to
[1:38:32] decide well I am I'm mad at my neighbor
[1:38:35] I'm not going to walk with God today
[1:38:38] yeah well that old boy down there he
[1:38:41] said this about me and that guy said
[1:38:42] that about me and this person over I
[1:38:44] just can't get through it I don't think
[1:38:45] I'm gonna walk with God today but he
[1:38:48] walked With God all day every day for
[1:38:51] 365 years because he was our type
[1:38:55] telling us somebody is going to walk
[1:38:57] with God in this evil generation they're
[1:39:00] going to break through they're going to
[1:39:01] push through they're going to press
[1:39:03] through they're going to overcome
[1:39:04] they're going to put one foot in front
[1:39:06] of the other and somebody's gonna say
[1:39:08] you can't make it but they're going to
[1:39:10] go anyhow they're going to be broke or
[1:39:12] poor but they're going to go anyhow
[1:39:14] they're going to be uneducated maybe
[1:39:16] Blue Collar maybe White Collar who knows
[1:39:18] but they're going to go anyhow because
[1:39:20] it is your type
[1:39:23] it's who you are
[1:39:25] not just watching it's who you are
[1:39:28] you got to understand that God has a
[1:39:30] type you was first that was that
[1:39:33] this was first God was making a tight to
[1:39:36] represent what was going to happen
[1:39:39] amen Enoch testified
[1:39:42] of the Lord Before the Flood
[1:39:44] amen
[1:39:46] Jesus actually demonology said why
[1:39:48] didn't you listen to Enoch
[1:39:50] he was talking to the people and souls
[1:39:52] in prison why did you listen I am he
[1:39:54] that Enoch had a spiritual revelation of
[1:39:58] are you
[1:39:59] I'm the one Enoch had a spiritual
[1:40:01] revelation of all the way back there
[1:40:03] somebody said brother Wayne I don't know
[1:40:05] if Enoch really had the Revelation prior
[1:40:08] to his change maybe he maybe he got it
[1:40:10] the day he changed you know that's a
[1:40:12] good idea that's the way some people
[1:40:14] teach the message like we're going to
[1:40:16] just be living and you're you're you're
[1:40:18] you're not going to have any fellowship
[1:40:19] with God and you don't know nothing
[1:40:21] about the word but one day this
[1:40:23] Supernatural Miracle is going to happen
[1:40:25] and you're just going to step from one
[1:40:27] dimension to another wow
[1:40:28] you can live a certain way all this time
[1:40:30] and then all
[1:40:33] no he had it before
[1:40:36] he had it before and watch this
[1:40:39] brother Brandon says see God's first
[1:40:42] Bible he ever wrote was in the sky as a
[1:40:44] zodiac
[1:40:45] starts with a Virgin Goes to the line
[1:40:47] the second coming written in the first
[1:40:49] Bible the second Bible written was
[1:40:51] written by Enoch
[1:40:53] now Enoch wrote his Revelation in the
[1:40:56] pyramid before his change
[1:40:58] so he must have had it more in a day
[1:41:01] he must have had it more in two days
[1:41:03] I don't know how long it took him to
[1:41:05] Mill that pyramid but I guarantee you it
[1:41:07] was some time consuming work
[1:41:09] but he built his Revelation in the
[1:41:11] pyramid and then Vindicated his
[1:41:14] Revelation by a body change amen the
[1:41:17] pyramid is not an unvindicated message
[1:41:20] it had the Vindication of a man walking
[1:41:22] from one dimension to another now if I'm
[1:41:24] going to listen to a man it's that man
[1:41:27] the one that preached a Vindicated
[1:41:29] message that's the one I'm gonna
[1:41:31] amen I believe we're following
[1:41:33] Vindication church amen and Enoch put it
[1:41:35] in a pyramid and the third Bible were
[1:41:37] ever written was the one written in
[1:41:39] paper of course one we're reading now
[1:41:40] and all of them holds the revelation of
[1:41:43] the Rapture amen Enoch wrote it and put
[1:41:46] it in a pyramid brother Adam says he
[1:41:48] built the built it before the flood as a
[1:41:50] memorial of reason it was never
[1:41:53] destroyed in the flood isn't it amazing
[1:41:54] Enoch's pyramid was built amen probably
[1:41:57] 100 years amen after the Finish after
[1:42:00] his death amen the flood don't come for
[1:42:02] uh several years and it survived the
[1:42:05] entire flood and here we are amen uh
[1:42:09] what with three thousand years four
[1:42:10] thousand years the other side of the
[1:42:11] flood and it's still standing there
[1:42:14] it was 2140 BC they they believed the
[1:42:17] Finish date of the pyramid amen so
[1:42:19] you're you're looking at something that
[1:42:21] is a memorial that has withstood the
[1:42:23] test of time and watch it starts out as
[1:42:26] a as a as a as a pyramid and somebody
[1:42:28] says well why is it a pyramid brother
[1:42:30] man said if you'll watch the dimensions
[1:42:32] he said it'll draw you down to the very
[1:42:35] hour you're living in
[1:42:37] amen that pyramid actually it's a
[1:42:40] powerful thing it was built in a pyramid
[1:42:42] it's Enoch sign amen of the future home
[1:42:45] is that right it's not only the Rapture
[1:42:47] in it it's the future home testified of
[1:42:50] Revelations 21 what John writes of the
[1:42:52] new Heaven and the new Earth is being
[1:42:54] testified before see God don't do like
[1:42:57] we do we start and then progress God
[1:43:00] finishes and then he goes back and tells
[1:43:03] you how he got there
[1:43:06] God before he ever Justified the Earth
[1:43:09] he had the finished product in Enoch's
[1:43:11] testimony before the sanctification of
[1:43:14] the blood before the Holy Ghost purges
[1:43:15] the Earth it was already in the pyramid
[1:43:18] and before God ever started with you he
[1:43:21] started with a seed on the inside of you
[1:43:23] and then he justified it and then he
[1:43:25] Sanctified it and then he filled it with
[1:43:26] the Holy Ghost God does not work like
[1:43:29] man God begins with the finish and then
[1:43:32] Works toward it so amen that's why the
[1:43:34] Bible said he is the author and the
[1:43:36] finisher and God never started something
[1:43:39] he can't finish I don't care how long it
[1:43:41] takes God started this God will finish
[1:43:44] this and if you go before the Rapture
[1:43:46] he'll raise you up out of the ground and
[1:43:48] change your body to finish this Rapture
[1:43:51] amen I'll tell you this message is true
[1:43:53] have this pyramid coming down upon the
[1:43:56] Earth it's the Gospel Church brother man
[1:43:58] says spoken word Original Seed he said
[1:44:00] it represents what Enoch built is what's
[1:44:03] taking place it's like the god Gospel
[1:44:05] Church coming of course it starts wide
[1:44:08] in the bottom and goes to the top you
[1:44:11] got that first picture of the pyramid
[1:44:12] hey I I hijacked these off of the
[1:44:14] internet so I hope it's okay with y'all
[1:44:15] if somebody sees this and they belong to
[1:44:17] y'all please forgive me and if I had to
[1:44:20] pay for it I'll give them Sean's number
[1:44:23] you can just call the church here and
[1:44:25] he'll pay you royalties
[1:44:29] that pyramid right there is just a
[1:44:31] picture of the Pyramid of Enoch It's the
[1:44:33] Great Pyramid it's just a pyramid and
[1:44:35] brother man will say watch the
[1:44:36] capstone's not there right looking at
[1:44:39] just a nice building now if you go to
[1:44:42] that next picture
[1:44:43] you'll see that this picture shows that
[1:44:47] it's built
[1:44:48] in a way that it divides the mass of the
[1:44:51] Earth in four quarters
[1:44:53] in other words the mass of the earth is
[1:44:55] not directly in the center of the earth
[1:44:57] it divides the mass of the Earth
[1:45:00] perfectly in four quarters
[1:45:02] amen now I don't know about y'all
[1:45:05] I really don't think Enoch probably was
[1:45:07] that good of a mathematician
[1:45:10] but I'm believing the man was under some
[1:45:13] kind of inspiration
[1:45:14] hey
[1:45:16] let the one that created the Earth knew
[1:45:18] exactly how big the land masses were
[1:45:21] and set it in the right place
[1:45:23] now you see that this thing's being set
[1:45:26] in the right place gives it something of
[1:45:28] a positioning telling the church
[1:45:30] positioning is everything
[1:45:34] God knows just how to position a man a
[1:45:38] woman a church
[1:45:40] now this this next picture let's start
[1:45:42] with this one this next picture there's
[1:45:44] a lot on the pyramid I'm not going to
[1:45:45] preach to you I got a few things I want
[1:45:47] to bring to you this next picture is
[1:45:49] actually a tremendous picture it's okay
[1:45:51] if I just slow down and talk to you a
[1:45:52] minute about this okay this next picture
[1:45:54] is pretty amazing if you look down here
[1:45:56] this is the entrance that was first
[1:45:58] found when they discovered the Great
[1:46:00] Pyramid and they were they were actually
[1:46:02] treasure hunting and a lot of the
[1:46:04] pyramids back there actually were
[1:46:06] destroyed now most people who study the
[1:46:08] pyramids amen they think that it was all
[1:46:11] Egyptian but it's amazing to me that I'm
[1:46:14] just sorry but I'm the guy I believe
[1:46:16] there was more than one boat in the days
[1:46:17] of Noah but I believe he had the first
[1:46:19] one
[1:46:21] and I believe there is a lot of a lot of
[1:46:24] pyramids in Egypt
[1:46:25] right but there ain't none of them like
[1:46:27] this one
[1:46:29] so if you impersonate something you
[1:46:32] devalue it
[1:46:34] right right
[1:46:36] do you see do you see the the beginning
[1:46:38] of it now this guy that was that
[1:46:42] discovered this and blew this hole in
[1:46:43] this pyramid worked his way in he he was
[1:46:46] treasure hunting
[1:46:48] they were looking for gold and silver
[1:46:50] the thing the beautiful thing about the
[1:46:52] pyramid is that most pyramids were
[1:46:54] actually Tunes to Great Kings
[1:46:56] and they had a lot of gold in them and
[1:46:58] they were gold hunting and they were
[1:46:59] looking for them and they blowed a hole
[1:47:01] but it's amazing in this pyramid they
[1:47:04] didn't find treasures
[1:47:06] isn't it amazing the treasure that when
[1:47:09] they was disappointed when they found
[1:47:10] this
[1:47:11] because it didn't hold any gold or no
[1:47:13] silver or no monuments it wasn't rubies
[1:47:15] and it wasn't but the treasure that it
[1:47:18] held was a treasure they didn't
[1:47:19] understand
[1:47:21] see some things are a treasure above the
[1:47:24] money it's a treasure above the silver
[1:47:27] it's a treasure above the gold the
[1:47:29] message of the hour when you found it
[1:47:31] you didn't find wealth you didn't find
[1:47:33] gold but what you found was The Treasure
[1:47:36] of the understanding of the changing of
[1:47:39] our body and and inside this pyramid
[1:47:42] held the revelation of how a man walks
[1:47:45] from one dimension to another with God
[1:47:48] now it's amazing when you look at it
[1:47:50] when they entered right here of course
[1:47:52] this was the entrance but the actual
[1:47:53] entrance that they built that Enoch
[1:47:55] built was up here and when they finally
[1:47:57] discovered this entrance you can see
[1:47:59] that man began on a downward path of
[1:48:01] course I could preach a message of
[1:48:03] redemption from here but he began on a
[1:48:05] downward path now look here a little
[1:48:07] time and then man begins on a downward
[1:48:09] path showing the fall of mankind you can
[1:48:12] see it pretty plain he falls down here
[1:48:14] to a bottomless pit do you know that
[1:48:16] bottomless pit at some point it falls in
[1:48:18] it's literally done away with and there
[1:48:21] is a and emptying a paradise
[1:48:23] but you can watch this entrance right
[1:48:25] here as man comes down but look right
[1:48:28] here at this point it's called the
[1:48:30] ascending passage to the Grand Gallery
[1:48:32] right here when they first discovered
[1:48:34] this pyramid there's there's a couple
[1:48:37] Granite blocks right here in this part
[1:48:39] and they don't know this is here for a
[1:48:41] long time all they know about is this
[1:48:43] downward path but some words about
[1:48:45] Calvary man discovered that there's a
[1:48:48] place that could be unlocked and there
[1:48:51] could be a path made that a man could
[1:48:53] begin to ascend unto God Amen that path
[1:48:57] was blocked until Calvary it's beautiful
[1:48:59] that it was red granite blocks I thought
[1:49:01] it was pretty powerful but anyhow when
[1:49:03] they unblock that man begins begins to
[1:49:06] ascend unto God now here's the thing if
[1:49:09] you're studying this brother by Adam
[1:49:10] talks about the grand gallery and he
[1:49:12] talks about the steps that go up there
[1:49:14] in the Ascension passages uh when when
[1:49:17] we're when we're actually studying this
[1:49:18] you can look from a distance and see
[1:49:20] that it goes to the Grand Gallery when
[1:49:22] it gets up here it goes to this called
[1:49:25] The King's chamber which is actually an
[1:49:28] inlaid red granite
[1:49:31] there's not another tomb in Egypt that
[1:49:34] is inlaid red granite because this is
[1:49:36] not a tomb
[1:49:38] this is not a place of the Dead
[1:49:41] this is a place of the living
[1:49:43] when you start studying it actually has
[1:49:45] air vents in it but when you when you go
[1:49:48] up to this gang gallery of course you're
[1:49:50] looking at the church ages in their
[1:49:52] Ascension going up to the the the the
[1:49:55] the going up to the king's chamber uh if
[1:49:59] you go to the next if you go to the next
[1:50:01] pitcher we're going to get closer on the
[1:50:03] king's chamber as you were seeing that
[1:50:05] at the top of the Ascension pattern now
[1:50:07] brother Adam said Enoch completed this
[1:50:09] in his day or back in the day the
[1:50:11] Pyramid of course we haven't got time to
[1:50:13] background and show the pyramid come up
[1:50:15] through the chambers and so forth but it
[1:50:18] speaks right straight to the end time
[1:50:20] now
[1:50:22] theirs in the king's chamber Now by
[1:50:26] measurement so a prophet is telling you
[1:50:28] if you're looking at this picture the
[1:50:31] Church of the Living God is now to out
[1:50:33] 30 entrance we're not up in the
[1:50:35] Ascension chamber we are at the king's
[1:50:37] chamber that by measurement tells the
[1:50:39] bride where she's at in this pyramid in
[1:50:42] this generation now brother Branham will
[1:50:44] tell us in the future home he'll tell us
[1:50:46] like this he said this is what an answer
[1:50:48] Enoch sign of Egypt and pyramid of
[1:50:51] course he's talking about the new
[1:50:52] Heavens but the antelope destruction
[1:50:53] justification was coming he brought
[1:50:55] forth a sign the pyramid is seven steps
[1:50:57] going to the king's chamber now if
[1:50:59] you're looking at the Ascension it's got
[1:51:01] a bunch of steps and you think well what
[1:51:03] was he talking about but those steps
[1:51:05] were put in there by man but when they
[1:51:07] built the Ascension chamber there's
[1:51:09] seven layers of stone and they get you
[1:51:11] you you Builders know what that is you
[1:51:14] lay one short and then you lay the next
[1:51:16] blocks higher and you lay the next
[1:51:18] blocks higher well there's seven layers
[1:51:20] of rock that leads to the king's chamber
[1:51:23] as you're going up the Ascension when
[1:51:25] you get to the seventh it brings you to
[1:51:27] this What's called the Great step right
[1:51:29] here is the end of the Ascension chamber
[1:51:32] some some estimate this to be about
[1:51:34] three foot tall I thought that's pretty
[1:51:36] good being we're talking about third
[1:51:37] pull that this is three foot tall now
[1:51:40] the thing is is a man coming to the
[1:51:42] king's chamber didn't just come up in
[1:51:44] the chamber from the Ascension by
[1:51:46] himself but what's the prophet says it
[1:51:48] like this he says now in the seven steps
[1:51:50] watch on that seventh step that's what
[1:51:52] you're looking at if you've ever studied
[1:51:55] the dimensions of the pyramid what comes
[1:51:57] out to take the oncomer to introduce to
[1:52:00] the king watch the station that is where
[1:52:03] that is standing there you'll see the
[1:52:06] day you're living in the pyramid
[1:52:10] the day you're living in the pyramid is
[1:52:12] that step right there that was in

[1:54:32] a Lutheran you can walk with him but
[1:54:34] till God sends a prophet you can't walk
[1:54:36] with a word but in this generation there
[1:54:39] is building utterance of a prophetic
[1:54:41] word that has gave us the ability oh my
[1:54:44] goodness amen I'm sorry preacher coming
[1:54:48] out here amen you watch this what God

[1:55:18] God and manifested word a Vindicated
[1:55:20] word god living among us that's the
[1:55:22] Messiah he promised it he would be that
[1:55:25] Pillar of Fire again he would be that
[1:55:27] same Messiah that led Israel he would be
[1:55:30] that same come on church that picture of
[1:55:32] the pillar fire we got here is not about
[1:55:33] the man brother random he ain't even
[1:55:35] here tonight amen but the one he
[1:55:38] introduced us to he said he would always
[1:55:40] accompany this message the pillar of
[1:55:43] fire is still with the Church of the
[1:55:45] Living God the same one he said who is
[1:55:47] this he said it's the same one that led
[1:55:49] the children of Israel out of Egypt into
[1:55:51] the promised land he has come for
[1:55:54] another Exodus he's come to lead the
[1:55:56] bride to lead us through the through the
[1:55:58] Scallywags and the impersonations and
[1:56:01] all the intimidation and a bride could
[1:56:03] walk with this word amen you say Amen
[1:56:06] what are you talking about this God's
[1:56:08] Messiah is the anointed word
[1:56:12] the anointed word
[1:56:14] amen there he is brother bam said them
[1:56:17] predestinated people is going to receive
[1:56:19] it too
[1:56:20] preacher what are you talking about
[1:56:21] let's go back to us let's go back to our
[1:56:23] chart a minute here there's the great
[1:56:25] step and a prophet comes to meet to
[1:56:28] bring us in the king's chamber
[1:56:30] and he's saying the Messiah will be in
[1:56:32] that chamber let's go to the next
[1:56:33] picture
[1:56:34] the Messiah will be in that chamber it's
[1:56:36] odd that there's just an empty box there
[1:56:39] isn't that odd just the empty box
[1:56:41] but if you check it out
[1:56:43] this box has the same volume
[1:56:47] as the Ark of the Covenant that Moses
[1:56:49] builds thousands of years later
[1:56:52] somebody said what are you talking about
[1:56:53] you remember Noah's you remember when
[1:56:55] Moses built a ten of meeting and the
[1:56:58] people would go into divine presence and
[1:56:59] in that divine presence was the Ark of
[1:57:01] the Covenant and the Word was in the Ark
[1:57:04] of the Covenant which was no more than a
[1:57:05] box like this one but it was made of of
[1:57:07] wood over of recovered but gold but up
[1:57:10] on top of it remember there was a lid on
[1:57:12] top that was The Mercy Seat and it was
[1:57:15] blood put on The Mercy Seat and it was a
[1:57:17] covered word with the blood between the
[1:57:19] people but when this end time amen now
[1:57:22] we're not looking oh God we're not
[1:57:25] looking at a word that is covered up
[1:57:27] we're not looking at a book that is
[1:57:29] sealed we're looking at something that
[1:57:32] the the the historians say that it never
[1:57:34] was a lid on this amen that Enoch was
[1:57:38] showing us when the bride gets to the
[1:57:40] last step she'll be brought into the
[1:57:42] presence of an open word do you know
[1:57:45] that the revelations to him that Malachi
[1:57:47] for is to open the word to this
[1:57:49] generation the secret of the rapture is
[1:57:53] that the word will be opened up as the
[1:57:55] bride can walk with God Amen she can go
[1:57:58] back to the mind of God where she came
[1:58:00] from it's an ark of the covenant with a
[1:58:03] lid that's been opened according to
[1:58:04] Revelations 10 it will be the open word
[1:58:06] no wonder we're not living under the
[1:58:08] first pool
[1:58:09] no wonder we're not living under the
[1:58:11] second Paul come on church this is a
[1:58:13] third pool administration of the son of
[1:58:16] man amen what are we talking about the
[1:58:18] third pool is the opening of the word
[1:58:20] that's why we're a part of it we're not
[1:58:23] a part of the first pull we're not a
[1:58:25] part of the second poll it was brother
[1:58:27] Adam's Ministry to the church but the
[1:58:30] third poll was the creation of a bride
[1:58:32] and a groom to make him one unit the
[1:58:35] bride has become Christ in this
[1:58:38] generation she's walking with him
[1:58:40] talking with him amen but he ain't just
[1:58:43] with us brother Mark he said yet a
[1:58:45] little while and the world see me no
[1:58:47] more but I will be with you even in You
[1:58:50] Until the End of the Age that's why that
[1:58:53] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:58:55] word and the age you're living in
[1:58:57] how can you deny this message and say
[1:59:00] it's the Holy Ghost
[1:59:02] come on Friends
[1:59:03] it's got to be that word
[1:59:07] can I can I can I continue a minute
[1:59:10] go to the next one
[1:59:12] this one right here blew me away look at
[1:59:14] this one this Granite Leaf right here
[1:59:16] which is in the entrance of the king's
[1:59:18] chamber you saw it while ago here's the
[1:59:21] back side of it's a granite Leaf they
[1:59:23] actually call this the Boston
[1:59:25] go to the next one
[1:59:27] you have got to climb
[1:59:29] all the way to the top
[1:59:31] to get the key to the entire thing
[1:59:34] Nobody Knows the measurements
[1:59:36] of this pyramid until you get to the
[1:59:39] king's chamber when you get there
[1:59:40] they've actually they've actually drawed
[1:59:42] this for you but it looks like a loaf of
[1:59:44] bread cut doesn't it but it measures
[1:59:46] five by five
[1:59:48] five pyramid inches
[1:59:51] so you you ever seen a set of plans and
[1:59:53] they got a scale on them
[1:59:54] this is the scale of the pyramid
[1:59:57] but it was hid
[1:59:58] all the way in the end
[2:00:01] if you get the key now you can turn
[2:00:04] around and look at the entire thing
[2:00:06] you can go down and measure out the
[2:00:07] beginning and you can measure out what
[2:00:09] happened here you can measure out what
[2:00:10] happened here see the message comes to
[2:00:13] the end and once you get the message now
[2:00:15] we understand Luther we understand the
[2:00:17] fall we understand Redemption we
[2:00:20] it's the boss Stone
[2:00:24] it gives you the key to the measurements
[2:00:27] of the entire Temple uh this this this
[2:00:29] art of the Covenant now if you're using
[2:00:31] this let's go to the next one if you're
[2:00:33] using this
[2:00:35] you will see 2140 BC is when this is
[2:00:37] built if you come into that you remember
[2:00:40] that entrance I showed you all ago you
[2:00:41] come down that line if you're going down
[2:00:43] that line just after you enter in
[2:00:46] there is actually on the wall
[2:00:49] is Big scored lines
[2:00:51] and they didn't know what they meant
[2:00:54] but after they found that key
[2:00:56] they come back and measured it
[2:00:58] this thing was built in 2140 BC
[2:01:02] 2140 inches pyramid inches down that
[2:01:05] Hall that line scored
[2:01:08] if you follow that line it goes directly
[2:01:12] and ties into the Stars which is the
[2:01:14] first Bible
[2:01:16] and it ties into Pleiades
[2:01:18] which is the Throne of God
[2:01:20] if you tie in the actual descension
[2:01:23] chamber which we've been looking at if
[2:01:25] you look at the dissension it comes out
[2:01:27] and ties in directly with dragon which
[2:01:30] is the alpha draconis it's draconius so
[2:01:33] so you have you have showing here Enoch
[2:01:37] in the pyramid is telling you about
[2:01:40] leadership
[2:01:41] it matters what you follow
[2:01:46] if you want to go in a Rapture you've
[2:01:49] got to understand leadership I'm on
[2:01:52] Church somebody said well by the way
[2:01:54] what is true leadership brother Brown
[2:01:55] said leadership was following the
[2:01:58] Vindicated word of the hour
[2:02:01] direct quote 1965 leadership we must
[2:02:04] follow he meant to have eternal life
[2:02:06] Leadership of God is to follow the
[2:02:09] Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy
[2:02:12] Ghost
[2:02:13] you can't go in this Rapture without
[2:02:16] leadership
[2:02:17] somebody's got to lead this bride I
[2:02:20] can't do it you can't do it you can't do
[2:02:22] it God said I'll send the Messiah and he
[2:02:25] will lead this bride
[2:02:27] then that means you might not ever met
[2:02:29] me and we can meet in the rapture
[2:02:32] there's this uh I probably leave that
[2:02:35] off it's okay if I say yeah I just
[2:02:36] appreciate there's a a big teacher there
[2:02:39] in Ohio years ago and and there's a
[2:02:41] group got in behind him and sometimes
[2:02:43] the group does more than the teacher you
[2:02:44] know but a group got in behind him and
[2:02:46] they got they got it spread over a
[2:02:47] certain part of Ohio I'm in that if you
[2:02:49] don't hear this certain teacher you
[2:02:51] can't even go in the rapture
[2:02:54] so one day I met some of us real famous
[2:02:57] followers you know and I was friends
[2:02:59] with some of them they introduced me to
[2:03:00] this fella and he's talking to him and I
[2:03:02] said hi my name is Dwayne Lawson he said
[2:03:04] I never heard of you I said that's a
[2:03:06] shame brother
[2:03:07] he said why is that I said didn't you
[2:03:09] know if you didn't hear me preach you
[2:03:10] can't go into rapture
[2:03:13] he said well that's silly I said it
[2:03:15] ain't no more silly than what you
[2:03:16] believe
[2:03:18] that we had to hear a certain preacher
[2:03:22] see there you go what's your leadership
[2:03:25] is it some fellow is it some man is it
[2:03:27] some personality come on Church
[2:03:30] he said what do you follow the message
[2:03:32] of the hour
[2:03:35] so don't you believe in pastors yes I do
[2:03:37] brother Brown said and a pastor will
[2:03:38] lead by the word
[2:03:41] we must follow it now watch this
[2:03:44] this building somehow is built True
[2:03:48] North let's take the next level next
[2:03:50] picture this building is built True
[2:03:52] North at that some reason that's not
[2:03:54] coming up I've got it on a it you have a
[2:03:56] pyramid on a compass
[2:03:58] you don't have it I got it down here
[2:04:00] sorry as it actually shows a true north
[2:04:02] this pyramid is the most True North
[2:04:04] built building I think in the entire
[2:04:06] world
[2:04:07] there's nothing you know like if you're
[2:04:08] trying to build a directly north you
[2:04:10] ever build a building you go out there
[2:04:12] and you go how do we lay that out it's
[2:04:13] going to be cockeyed to the highway or
[2:04:15] is it going to be you know how do you
[2:04:16] lay it out in the somebody laid this
[2:04:18] thing out where it was true north with
[2:04:20] the entire world
[2:04:22] that's pretty powerful
[2:04:24] but being that it's built so truth there
[2:04:26] it is
[2:04:27] amen being that it's built True North
[2:04:29] the pyramid look what it's actually
[2:04:31] built true north
[2:04:34] how did that man do that
[2:04:37] how did he built that true north sister
[2:04:39] hope he's got the entire file and you
[2:04:41] can have it amen it's built true north
[2:04:44] and and and the thing about it is
[2:04:47] because it's built this way you can tie
[2:04:49] it into the heavens take that next take
[2:04:51] that next uh slide and you're going to
[2:04:54] go into the Orion's Belt now the one the
[2:04:56] one with the guy standing there in the
[2:04:58] build on Orion's belt
[2:05:00] there he is Orion's Belt this is this is
[2:05:03] Orion's Belt which is the consolation
[2:05:05] you can see it's called Orion's Belt
[2:05:07] because of the three major Stars here
[2:05:10] because this thing's built so true north
[2:05:12] now the next one you can take and if you
[2:05:14] were looking down through Orion's belt
[2:05:17] from the heavens
[2:05:18] they lay over the three pyramids
[2:05:21] exactly
[2:05:24] the three stars hit exactly
[2:05:27] and look they get brighter
[2:05:29] with the size and their exact distances
[2:05:33] between them
[2:05:34] now how did how did this man Enoch
[2:05:39] get that so perfect
[2:05:42] was it it was like the man was above
[2:05:46] Orion's Belt looking down
[2:05:51] a little left
[2:05:53] no no back back right just a little bit
[2:05:58] folks
[2:06:01] this is not accidental
[2:06:05] it's it's so perfectly accurate
[2:06:09] with the heavens now go to that go to
[2:06:11] that next one
[2:06:13] now it's amazing because this king's
[2:06:16] chamber is built it's built with Vince
[2:06:23] if it's a if it's a tomb
[2:06:25] there's no need no vent in there
[2:06:28] but the king's chamber was vented
[2:06:31] it was actually had a southern vent now
[2:06:34] the beauty of this Southern van is in
[2:06:36] the Book of Joel 9 and 9 it said which
[2:06:38] maketh our Arcturus Orion and Pleiades
[2:06:42] and the chambers
[2:06:44] of the South can you imagine that job
[2:06:46] talked about the chambers of the South
[2:06:50] in Orion
[2:06:52] all the way back during the Book of Job
[2:06:54] now can thou Job 38 canst thou bind the
[2:06:58] sweet influences of pleadies remember
[2:07:01] that one 2400 BCS points straight up
[2:07:04] where is it pointing please
[2:07:07] and job says can thou bind the sweet
[2:07:09] influences
[2:07:11] the Pleiades
[2:07:13] or loose the bands of Orion
[2:07:16] and why is he mentioning these
[2:07:18] consolations
[2:07:20] watching Amos 5 and verse 8 seek him
[2:07:22] that maketh the Seven Stars and Orion do
[2:07:26] you know Pleiades is actually
[2:07:28] the the Pleiades consolation is the
[2:07:31] consolation of the Seven Stars
[2:07:34] the influence of the Seven Stars is what
[2:07:37] the leadership
[2:07:39] he was trying to get the church to
[2:07:42] the leadership of the Seven Stars
[2:07:45] Pleiades is a consolation of seven stars
[2:07:49] now friends
[2:07:51] I don't believe that these things are
[2:07:53] just accidents
[2:07:55] but I believe the Enoch wrote a
[2:07:57] revelation
[2:07:59] and then God Vindicated it with a body
[2:08:01] change
[2:08:03] and left it as a memorial to you and I
[2:08:06] that it ties with the Bible
[2:08:09] and it ties
[2:08:10] with the heavens
[2:08:12] of the Walk of a man that walked upon
[2:08:15] the earth now when the prophet preaches
[2:08:17] his Revelation the next one
[2:08:20] when the prophet preaches his revelation
[2:08:22] it's also a pyramid Revelation stand to
[2:08:27] your feet with us tonight
[2:08:28] we'll start that tomorrow night
[2:08:32] it's also
[2:08:34] a pyramid
[2:08:36] revelation
[2:08:41] just keep on walking
[2:08:45] you don't know how far you've come
[2:08:46] friend
[2:08:49] let's keep on walking
[2:08:51] it's your time
[2:08:53] we get weary
[2:08:59] 300 years
[2:09:02] he had every situation
[2:09:05] that you have
[2:09:08] he was not a Superman
[2:09:11] he was a man
[2:09:14] that walked with God
[2:09:17] brother Brown said this is thing he
[2:09:18] never turned down nothing God asked him
[2:09:21] to do
[2:09:23] he'd done the word if the word said it
[2:09:26] he was dedicated
[2:09:27] he was trained he was disciplined
[2:09:31] Amen brother I believe in it I believe
[2:09:33] that's what the Church of the Living God
[2:09:34] ought to be tonight
