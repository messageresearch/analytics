Glover asked me to greet you all uh he asked me to do that Sunday and I forgot and uh so I thought I'd better do it while I'm remembering praise the Lord Lord but if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of James amen and um we will um James chapter 5 we had read this last Wednesday and wanted to speak on it again tonight and um so good to be a Christian amen amen to have a hope amen for a bright future praise the Lord amen before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we as your children come humbly before you Lord realizing that you are our father and Lord that you desire to meet with us father and we desire to meet with you tonight Lord we believe that this meeting has been ordained by you and we have felt the pool to come and Lord now we're just asking that you would uh have your way here in this part of the service we believe the word to be the most important father and Lord we pray pray that the songs and the worship be pleasing in your sight father and that you would feel at home that you would just do a creative work within each and every one of us and may your word have its effect Upon Us father Lord if there's any sin that has been committed that's not under the blood we'd ask that you'd forgive us Lord of it and we just pray now that you just have your way we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen and amen James the 5th chapter and the 14th verse but it says is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith everybody say the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him amen you can have your seats this evening and as we have um mentioned last week that this of course James is talking about the laying on of hands and and um and praying the prayer Faith but I believe that the the that prayer of faith is always important and not just when it comes to laying hands on the sick and um um it is of course important that we pray and we've talked about it 1 Timothy 2 and8 uh uh here it says I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and and doubting and we know that Jesus spent much time in prayer when he was on the earth and and if he had to spend much time in in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him then how much more do you and I have to spend time in prayer and uh um you know the prophet said if you only knew what much time in prayer meant what time in prayer but you can't hide a Believer from prayer uh uh there's something that uh uh connects us uh with God when we when we come to pray uh Believers Believers pray ain't that right and so uh praying to God uh means that we're looking unto him to supply our needs um we we we're devoting not just our prayer to him but we're devoting our heart we're devoting our request and we're we're not approaching the enemy uh uh so to to make a deal in hopes that he will be satisfied and that he'll make us you know let us live and let us have comfort and let us uh whatever but we are approaching the god of Heaven amen and and you know many times people have prayed prayers without understanding the one that they are praying to and uh uh the they and and and they're they're praying but while all along they're praying with fear in their heart they're they're they're praying still worrying and and fretting and their attitude and prayer to God is is is basically like how a beggar or a stranger would approach a a a uh someone on the streets um just hoping that that someone will have pity upon them and and hoping that someone will will give them money and hoping that you know uh they'll get some food or hoping you know and and a lot of times prayer uh pray to God is is really the the same approach is we're just hoping that he'll pity us and we're hoping that he'll he'll see the need and you know just somehow that we can get his attention and and and these things but here Philippians 4 and six Paul would tell us be careful for nothing can you say that with me be careful for nothing Amen in other words be be be don't be anxious don't fret don't worry for anything see but in everything everybody say everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God so so this is the type of prayer that we are to pray with Thanksgiving ain't that right and with supplication let your request uh uh be made known unto God so so prayer is to be made to God who is uh omnipotent and and and I I think it's important if we're going to pray the prayer of faith we have to know who we're praying to and God is omnipotent and the word omnipotent means having unlimited power or unlimited Authority and and so uh there there is only one who is omnipotent and that is God ain't that right amen and and so he's not limited to your situation uh or to uh any man's uh incapabilities God is Not uh on the level of of of just finite man amen so we cannot uh uh pray uh with this with this thought that God is limited uh uh when it comes to our situation I know God can move for so and so but I don't know if he can move for me well then you're you you you you cannot have the prayer of faith when you're approaching God in that way we have to know we have to believe we have to be assured and have the confidence that the god that we're praying to is omnipotent ain't that right and and and what what is he an omnipotent in he's omnipotent in healing in other words he's unlimited no matter what the name is no matter what disease is God is omnipotent in healing he is omnipotent in Salvation it in other words he can reach the farest the lowest to the lowest Sinner and and and rescue and save and deliver amen uh the worst sinner on the face of the Earth ain't that right he's omnipotent in in Deliverance he's omnipotent in transformation amen no matter what your habits are no matter what you go through God is omnipotent ain't that right and so therefore that that that when we really catch that amen then we can pray the prayer of faith but you cannot pray the prayer of faith if you don't know and and I mean really a revelation that God is omnipotent a a ain't that right amen because we will always limit God when we can't see a way out but when you can't see a way out you can still pray a prayer faith knowing that God is on omnipotent when your back is against the wall God is omnipotent and so we're we we're not basing our prayers based on the situation and based upon our limitation we are praying to a god that is omnipotent ain't that right this is why we are told to ask for big things because God can answer any prayer God can answer any request God can meet any need amen that you have here tonight this is why in mark 11:24 Jesus said whatsoever things that you desire When you pray believe everybody say believe that you receive them and you shall not might you shall have them ain't that right well who's going to give it to you well God's going to give it to you he's omnipotent and if he has to create it he'll give it to you you shall have it ain't that right now in 2 Kings the the uh 7th chapter it talks about the time when uh the enemy had uh encamped around the city of Samaria and they had been there for a while and and they had done it it was a Siege on the city and and they had stopped the food supply they had stopped up the water supply people were dying it was a drought they were hunging they were starving and it was a bad time uh uh for the people of Samaria but there was the Bible says there was four lepers sitting outside the city at the gate and uh um so so they they thought well if we go inside the city we're going to die if and so they said but but you know uh if if we go to the enemy well there's a chance that they might let us live and and you know they could kill us but we're going to die anyway so let's let's let's try the enemy and so the Bible says that they they they uh uh went and and and uh um uh to the enemy's camp and brother brandom says they moved out by faith and God rewarded them not they not only saved themselves but they saved the city of Samaria ain't that right amen but then we uh uh uh uh go uh brother brandom in his prayer he said Lord help the people Amen to understand and to know amen that that we don't have to take a chance by going to the enemy's Camp amen God our hope is not going to the enemy's camp but we we we can come on our knees to our loving father at the Throne of God aren't you glad for that amen see you've got a way and an approach to God Amen through prayer that you don't have to just keep dealing with the Enemy and begging the enemy and hoping the enemy will spare your life and spare your children spare the church spare the home spare whatever amen and just leave you a crumb you can go to the king of king and the Lord of Lord amen before the throne of grace because you amen have access to God can you say Amen so you don't have to take a chance tonight amen you see uh uh Hebrews 4:16 Paul I believe or Peter I know Paul says let us therefore come boldly before unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need ain't that right so then when we pray the prayer of faith then it is a sign that we truly understand the one who we're praying to amen we're not likening him to a politician or to a president to a king or to some Earthly uh dictator some Earthly power amen we we're we're likening into him as to who he really is and that is the omnipotent Supreme being a man that can do anything he wants to he's Sovereign in any act in any situation under any circumstance amen so now in the Old Testament God appeared uh uh to Mankind in seven compound Redemptive names and and in those Redemptive names he represented himself to the human race for everything that we have need of while in this journey amen uh uh in our fallen State and all the way to Glory ain't that right amen and so God would represent him and and so we know him as God that Health thee we know him as God that would supply all of our needs we we know him as Lord our Banner the Lord that would provide himself a sacrifice and and the prophet says what he appeared as God to the human race race in the beginning he has to continue on under those names and under that provision can you say Amen if God is eternal and he revealed himself back then as Jehovah Gyra and if he's still God then he still is Jehovah Gyra he cannot change his nature he cannot change his ways he cannot change his habits he cannot change uh what he is ain't that right so he has to remain that because he reduced himself to the human race by those names and if none of the Redemptive names appli to Jesus then Jesus Christ Isn't Our Savior he's not our healer he's not our deliverer he's not our way maker he's he's nothing to us ain't that right but if all of these Redemptive names amen belong to him and are in him then he is the saying yesterday today and forever ain't that right amen yes sir so notice as as we read the prayer of faith shall save the sick and if he hath committed any sin it shall be forgiven him what will the prayer of faith can you say that with me the prayer of faith the prayer of faith will amen see so it's not just praying to God that counts amen but it's praying the prayer of faith amen the prophet would tell us what I'm trying to do is get to the Pentecostal people to let them realize who they are if you only knew who you was tonight amen there had come such a spontaneous world of Faith through here till there wouldn't be a sick person now you think of that such faith that there wouldn't even be a sick person there would be no need of having a prayer like if people if the people that's here realize who they are that's the only way you can do it ain't that right it's through faith amen so he says how do you think it is in foreign Nations walking against demons and powers and everything you have to know where you're standing see Satan don't care how loud you holler Satan don't care how much you jump up and down Satan will lay right there but he has to recognize faith and it will move him every time ain't that right so a prayer of faith amen it's different than just praying you can you can beg and you can make your prayer a prayer of begging you can make your prayer a prayer of of wandering you can make your prayer a prayer of wishing you can make your prayer a prayer of anything amen trying to get God's attention trying to appeal to him trying to whatever but it takes a prayer of faith and when when not only does God recognize the faith but Satan recognizes the faith ain't that right see so he says I you know the devil don't care how much you holler he's not deaf amen he don't care how much you scream that doesn't mean a thing to him he'll never recognize that but he will recognize Faith Hallelujah my desire is that God would make us a people of prayer and the people of Faith amen I ask God quite often to to make me a man of prayer the Lord but I I don't want my prayer to be filled with fear and doubt and wandering and unbelief and and to be honest I I I don't I don't want to just pray to God because I am in need I don't want to make him my errand boy but but here's where I really want why I want to pray is because I want to pray to him because I'm his son I'm his son and and you know we talk about prayer of faith it has to go both ways you have to know who he is but then you have to know who you are come on now and and and and so see so the relationship that that God and I have is that of a father and son a ain't that right and and not only a son that is wavered but a son who has been reconciled to his father can you say Amen talking about prayer of faith now amen that that that you see that that relationship is is is is between me and God father he the father I am his son that has been reconciled and there is harmony between us we we lived all of our sinful lives with no Harmony we were doing our own thing God doing his thing and and we were bucking and we were we were just just rebelling and all that but he come and saved us and He restored a relationship and it was all because the reason we rebelled is because we were under Satan's domain that God broke that thing from our lives and loosed us from his grip that we can now come in agreement to his will to his word can you say Amen so so therefore to me to me coming in being a son and knowing I'm a son and and and knowing that there's a Reconciliation and now there's a Harmony between me and my heavenly father father see then then to me it that's what gives me Faith to approach him and pray differently to to quit praying the prayer as though I'm a stranger to God and and and and and to quit praying a prayer as though God sees me as a beggar amen can you sayen amen see my my prayer as a son is different than it would be if I was just a servant or a beggar amen my prayer is different see as a son then it would be if I had the mentality of a servant or a beggar praise the Lord can you say Amen so God doesn't want us to have that type of mentality brother Bram said see he he sent his son on earth made in likeness of sinful flesh and he died that we might be redeemed aren't you glad for that amen that we might be redeemed and brought back to God to be Sons and Daughters of God to walk with him again relationship right we we God doesn't want us to spend our whole life as church members without relationship Amen on Now 1 John 3 And1 says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God Amen notice therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not amen ain't that right so God's love is bestowed upon you and I right so to identify us as sons of God prise the Lord ain't that right amen the purpose of his love bestowed upon us is to identify us as his sons and his daughters and and you know the love of God is is so much talked about and yet misunderstood you know the bi the Bible says whom the Lord loveth he Chast chastens he he correct ain't that right so so then this love that God bestowed upon us see his love is corrective love he he does not leave us in sin and wallowing in in the muck and the M he he does not leave us in a sinful State and nor does he leave us in a religious State amen but see he is molding and shaping his children to his original thoughts of what he thought about us hello God being Eternal he had thoughts and them thoughts are Eternal he didn't just think of you when you was just born in a certain year I was born in 1973 but that's not when Jesus and or or God started to think of me I I am an eternal thought of God can you say Amen so he died to redeem me back to that thought praise God whatever Satan done to me whatever Satan done to you there a blood there Amen to loose you from that to take all your past away and your scars away and everything to where Satan cannot accuse you before the father amen ain't that right so God is molding and shaping his children and and the prophet said this is what end time evangelism is he said what what good is the stones if you haven't got a a stonemason to shape them out confessions is Stones when Peter made his confession Jesus said Thou Art Peter a little Stone but what good is a stone if there isn't a stone Mason there to shape him into a Son of God Amen you're just piling a bunch of rocks is that right it isn't doing a bit of good amen think of that all the all the preaching all the singing all the the concerts and all the all the seminaries and all that ain't doing any good if if it ain't shaping us into sons of God it's got to shape us that's right see the water wearth away the stone that's right that's the people see what good is Stones if you haven't got a true Mason with a good sharp tool to shape him into The Fitting Place in the house of God just want you to want to ask you what's good what goods the decision what good you putting your name on the book see what good is coming and joining the church if the stonemason isn't there that'll shape that and make them quit this and quit that and cut them and make them over this way and square them up and make them like Christians that sits in the house of God with signs following the believer he said that's end time evangelism is taking the stones and shaping them prise the Lord amen aren't you glad for the stone Mason praise God prise lord now that's his love for us that's his love to us amen that we should be called the sons of God he makes our life different he makes our confession different he makes our prayer different he makes our relationship with God different amen see 1 John 3:2 beloved now are we the sons of God now everybody say now not going to be but now are we the sons of God we're not being Sons and Daughters of God when we get to heaven we are sons of God right now amen see and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know this that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is all right so now we are now can you say now I am a Son of God now now I am now present tense now I am so now Satan's not messing with a sinner he's messing with a son of God ain't that right now I'm not praying as a sinner I'm praying as the Son of God yes sir it's true now amen see we that's that's that the prayer of faith see so now not only is God omnipotent amen but man sons of God is omnipotent go ahead ain't that right amen well the prophet taught it he says man is omnipotent he said you don't believe that but he is a man notice a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent a a man a woman boy or girl that has totally surrendered their life to God Amen is omnipotent prise the Lord then why can't you pray a prayer of faith amen did not Jesus say there in Mark 11:22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you say Amen yes sir yeah but but you don't understand I'm going through a lot but you can have what you say praise the Lord I don't care how big the devil is quit dwelling on how big the devil is look at what God made you to be amen ain't that right see so what happens when two omnipotence meet when God and man comes together through omnipotence something's got to shake all right something's got to give see so whatsoever you would say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it right not wondering knowing he's promised it I I think it's good to know what God's promised for this age amen praise and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out you and brings things to pass things that are not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotence have met God and His redeemed son have met thank you Lord Jesus Lord ain't that right yes sir and when God and a Believer meets there's two omnipotence because see man man is a part of God he's a Son of God and what little he is joins see with the uh uh is joined with the entire body so we we find see believe that what you said and a Christian is so marked that around him is an atmosphere a creative atmosphere and notice what a prophet says now prayer from a saint will go a million times higher than an angel because he's a son you have more more power with God than an angel would because you're a Son of God true ain't that right see so so he says see he says now I don't believe this sight of Eternity how will ever realize uh what what you are the church uh he said the position that you are that God has placed you Spirit-filled people you are sons of God praise the Lord and why an angel's a servant you're a son an angel can only bring you a message but you have to act see you're the actor on the scene you're the son the angels are servants to bring you the message and says here I brought this message for you to do so and so this is from the father I bring it to you that's all it is see but you are Sons and Daughters of God praise the Lord ain't that right so so we look at it today according to the scriptures and according to what we see in the age of that we're living in the angel of the Lord has given us the message in this day but we are the actors prise the Lord are you with me now we are the actors amen the message is here the mighty Angel according to Revelations 10:1 has come amen has descended with an open book in his hand so we're not waiting for the message hallelujah it's been given can can you say Amen so we have an open Vision so so we are not ident identified with the people that have no vision right ain't that right Proverbs 298 where there is no vision the people perish ain't that right but notice in habach habach uh 2 and 2 and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that reth it can you say Amen so the vision has been made plain it is an open Vision the message says that we are Justified as though we never did it the message says that we have been pardoned the message says that we are the Eternal attributes of God manifested in this age the message says that since it is uh H uh uh we have been loosed by a perfect blood then it is a perfect loosening ain't that right amen the message says now the power of the believing Church Christ has all power in heavens and earth he said do you believe that well then what if he is in you amen what does that mean Christ in you the hope of glory Jesus is the one that said all heaven or all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me now that same God is inside of you then what does it mean then see all right he is the seed word in his body he in US becomes the seed word in US what all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church church the vision is open the message has been made clear amen yes sir so I say as the Apostle Paul run that you may obtain amen run Don't just run in circles don't just wander around the vision has been made plain all right praise the Lord can you say amen amen notice as we read the world knoweth us not because it knew him not now we are a people who know who we are we should by the open Vision the message coming God doesn't send an open open the word to us and then we just sit there in dilatory wondering what to do next you're the actors the Angel's done his part can you say Amen so we know who we are but the world doesn't know then see I I I if you don't know who you are I I pray this evening that that you could receive such an experience with God that you know yeah that you know who you are amen sure you can't pray the prayer faith without knowing who you are can you say amen and when you truly experience the love of God then then you know then then you can say as Paul said in Romans 8:35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or swart see as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present or things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord see it gives us confidence to know the love of God can you say Amen Faith worketh by love amen but the world knoweth us not therefore we should never base our prayers according to what the world thinks of us amen for knows us not neither knoweth it knoweth him not it knows him not knew him not and it knows us not so therefore our prayers cannot be conformed to what the world thinks of us can you say Amen they have no relationship with him for they know him not they know not the power of redemption for they know him not they know not the power of his blood they have not the promises available to them amen because they know him not yes true but if you've experienced his love then you know one thing that is brought to us is that we are sons of God praise the Lord I know people say well the lord loves me just as I am that's God's love I beg to differ he does love you the way you are but if his love has ever come upon you it'll transform you it'll change you amen right to me that's love amen that's the love of God takes me from what I was to what I am brings me closer to him makes me more like him yes sir for he predestinated us to be conformed to His Image amen not the way the devil wants us to be not the way a church wants us to be not the way a theologian wants us to be but the way God wants us to be and that's to be conformed in his very own likeness His Image right and he's the word that's right so you cannot judge God by how the world judges him because they know him not right true many many pulpits depict God as something weak that's why we have to depend upon politicians for our Victory on that's why churches members are going getting so involved in politics because it seemed like if they can get the right candidate then they're like will be more easier and it's the church's fault because they don't bring and cannot produce a powerful God a god of omnipotence but it doesn't matter what this world thinks God rules and he's omnipotent can you say Amen but the world knoweth him not so we should never conform our prayers to the prayers of of the world and and you must not see yourself as the world sees you for it knoweth you not either amen as sons of God they may look at you as a sinner but God looks at you as a son how can a holy God look at me as his son because he looks through the blood through the blood true ain't that right when he looks at you he sees you through the blood and he's confirmed that the blood is with on you he's confirmed it by giving you his own life his own spirit is that right amen so you're a son and daughter of God and this is why we are not to be conformed to this world as Paul would tell us but we are to be transformed by the renewing of our mind the world gropes in darkness and and are the children of Darkness but the Bible says we are the children of light and we walk in the light as he is in the light amen as I get ready to close therefore we are a people of understanding yes amen we pray with understanding Paul would tell us we sing with understanding if I sing I'm going to sing with understanding if I pray I'm going to pray with understanding we worship with understanding we worship not knowing you know we we're not one that worships not knowing who we're worshiping to but but we have this understanding and and it's because we've been brought to him we we have seen him we know him for what he is we're not serving a god of our own imagination we're not the serving a god of someone else's imagination it's not a god of stone it's not a you know there there's a lot of heathens that work ship God a a god of stone a god of wood a god of of marble or some precious stone or or or whatever but a lot of people within the christiandom the rims of christiandom worship a god of their own imagination true amen and they prayed as such but I understand that as a Son of God I have been redeemed to every Divine promise amen that God has made amen can you say amen amen amen so then this understanding that I'm speaking of is not a childlike understanding but rather the understanding of a matured Son of God right totally different in the understandings yes sir I can't talk to my 8-year-old as I would my 25 24 26 year old and as they grown and as they've matured then we become talking on a different level it becomes a different discussion right yes I don't I don't talk to an 18 and talk to her about Barbies now I used to because that was where her understanding was right but now you know I have to lecture her how she drives so Faith cometh by hearing or understanding the word praise the Lord as we close David understood by the word of the Lord as to who he was Lord he understood that that Goliath that was making his boast against the army of the Living God was already a defeated foe amen that's what he understood he understood that by the Covenant that God had made by the Covenant ain't that right shamard understood by the word or the Covenant that he was in or by the word that he was in the Covenant and that the enemy was powerless before him that's why he as one man could face what to could whip 600 well-trained men soldiers because he understood that he was greater because the Covenant was greater than just military training amen the Covenant that he was in was greater than just a natural man and he understood that therefore he could take and face and defeat 600 men yes sir amen Joshua and Caleb understood by the message of the hour and by the supernatural works that were being done through the prophet Moses ain't that right they understood that it was God leading them to the promised land they understood that the promised word was being fulfilled right before them and it gave them a faith they understood that no matter how many Giants was in the land they they understood that no matter how strong them wal cities were they would conquer every last one of them because they understood by the word can you say Amen they understood oh do you love him praise the Lord thinking of the prophet he says I'm he says now I'm I'm going away to pray get ready for healing service he said you can get the phones or whatever you wish to and bring any in anybody that you want to for this coming revival and tell them not not to come in a hurry now not not come and say well I'm going to run in and be prayed for tonight and tomorrow night and that it's all see you don't do that you come in and listen a while cuz we want to take our time and lay that word out so close that the devil won't even have one little speck of room to ever move and what did the prophet do night after night he laid that word out so clear and so plain to to to to where the people could see what was being done right before them can you say amen he was able to take that word and show them and to show us that what God was doing was fulfilling his word in this age can you say amen and after God see uh uh had confirmed the Covenant I I thought you know the Covenant that God made to Abraham amen what was it being done in this age it was God confirming the Covenant Amen to you and I of what he had promised Abraham now you know good and well that Paul talks about that we are the children of Abraham and that we are the true children of Abraham and that we are part of the Covenant ain't that right yes sir the natural the natural Seed of Abraham they they destroyed their enemy they they they had great great things that was done amen but now we are not just a we're not the natural seed we are the Royal Seed of Abraham and every promise every Divine promise amen God made belongs to you and I thank you Lord and what we have seen is God fulfilling that Covenant Amen in this day and brother Bram says after God had confirmed the Covenant or the Covenant was made manifest to him it gives Faith to the true sons of God the word gives Faith the breasted one see it does something to them when the word or when the Covenant is made manifest it gives Faith to the true sons of God can you say Amen so our understanding doesn't come from some theological amen reading and and discussion of the book to where we just all sit there and we're learning from our intellects well the Bible does say this and we're putting words together in the scriptures together and we wo wow he is awesome when he can get up there and put all this stuff together amen but that's not where we're at today we are getting our understanding by this word being fulfilled right before our eyes what a greater understanding Hallelujah bless the Lord a greater understanding can you say amen God can do nothing greater to make the vision plain to us than coming down himself in this day yes and confirming the Covenant to us all you have to do is believe if the musicians will come amen do you love the Lord yes brother Bram said now you that's got strength enough to yield a sword now that you've got understanding enough in God's word to claim it to be your personal property right what is that our understanding what is the understanding that we've got to take this word and claim it to as our personal property prise Lord every Divine promise of this age now we're not in a hurry right now we're not in a hurry every Divine promise that God made our understanding is becoming more clear and more clear that it is our personal property then we can pray the prayer of faith that's right knowing who has has redeemed us right knowing the god that bestowed his love upon us to make us sons of his right and to call us sons of God there's nothing between us he's broke the middle wall a partition he's redeemed us to every promise he's made we understand that the Covenant that he made belongs to us we understand that our faith makes us omnipotent prise God because all things are possible Hallelujah to him that belief can you say amen he said who can pick up that he said you that's got strength enough to yield a sword now that you've got understanding enough in God's word to claim it to be your personal property who can pick up the word of God now in your hand hold it out in the hand of faith and say I take my side with the Lord I'll be Oneness with my God from this on I'll yield this sword of the spirit in this word and I'll cut the devil to every promise that God promised me can you say Amen do you love the Lord amen I am redeemed I've been bought with a [Music] [Applause] price oh yes he has and if anybody he asked you just who I am tell them I am well are you the redeemed of the Lord sing it now oh yes I am redeemed I've been bought with a price oh Jesus he's changed my whole life and if anybody ask you just who I am tell them I am am redeemed oh sing it one more time oh I am redeemed wash we bought with the price for Jesus he's changed my whole life and if anybody ask you [Music] just who I am tell them I am redeemed can you lift your hands unto the Lord what a blessing to know that we're redeemed what a blessing to know that the god of Heaven bestowed his love upon us that we could be called the sons of God that our prayer just wouldn't be an empty prayer but it could be a prayer of faith knowing who we are and that he's redeemed us to every promise that he has made oh Father we're so thankful for it we love you oh Father may we walk handin hand with you father may we have a greater relationship strengthen our faith strengthen our courage give us a greater understanding than we've ever had before we ask it in Jesus Christ's name hallelujah hallelujah do you love the Lord amen amen amen let's
