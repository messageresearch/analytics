and the musicians can be dismissed enjoyed the songs and uh just the worship amen the Lord is certainly good to us and um bringing us here on a midnight or midweek and just to Worship the Lord amen and um if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Deuteronomy om my the 7th chapter and uh good to have um Sister Lisa back with us amen and enjoyed that song and the uh sister Bonnie and just all those um well just everyone amen praise the Lord uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we realize just how desperate the hour is and we realize more and more our need for thee and Lord we have come under expectation Lord for you to just work your work in US Lord for we know it would be an eternal touch an eternal work I pray father that you would help us just to yield ourselves to thee and there's anything that uh has we've done that is displeasing to you we pray that you would forgive us of them Lord and father for you know our heart you know uh that we're just but dust Lord but father you've done a creative work within us you started something Lord within us and we believe that you have called us here Lord to continue that work and no doubt there are needs here that are present and I pray that you would touch every need Lord no matter how great or how small it would be father anoint the ministering of your word as well as the hearing we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen the book of Deuteronomy the 7th chapter and want to start at the the sixth verse but it said for thou art and holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt know therefore everybody say know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with him that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations amen you can have your seats know therefore that the Lord he is God God the faithful God and I'm so glad he's my God and that we can know him in a personal way praise the Lord and uh this evening uh I'm going to uh just uh speak on the faithfulness of God again for we know that he is faithful how many believes that and uh this this word faithful uh it means loyal unwavering uh steadfast unmovable uh dedicated uh or devoted so so he is dedicated he's firm he's steadfast he's devoted and he's faithful he's loyal aren't you glad that he's loyal amen and so Jesus said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee but I'll be with you till the end of the world the end of the age and and so then he is faithful God is faithful we talked about it last Wednesday but he's faithful because he is eternal God being Eternal and and that word Eternal is having an infinite duration continued without intermission endless Timeless existing at all times without beginning and Without End so these are just uh some of the words that we would try to describe what Eternal is uh uh but but God being Eternal then he always was he always will be uh and and with that he cannot change he cannot be diminished and he can't even get greater than what he already is he becomes greater to us because he's he's revealing himself all the time but in himself he does not improve at all he he is is what he is and so if he is eternal then everything that comes from him is eternal so his thoughts are Eternal his word is eternal uh his love his faith is eternal his strength his Joy his peace it it's all Eternal his plan his purpose uh it's the these things are are Eternal his ways are Eternal and and so an eternal God cannot lie ain't that right if his word is eternal then he cannot lie he cannot take back his word he cannot um I think the Bible says that he's not the son of man that he should uh uh repent um uh man that he should repent he's not a man that he should lie and so uh uh then then his eternal thoughts cannot lie his word cannot lie his love cannot lie he cannot he cannot put put on a front amen uh because that would be lying there's no hypocrisy in God so his his love is true it cannot lie his eternal plan his eternal purpose cannot lie see his peace is not a fake peace it it it is a true peace and it cannot lie for it is eternal it cannot pass away ain't that right amen so he cannot love you today amen and then despise you tomorrow uh that that just can't uh he cannot have a place prepared for you today and then give it to another tomorrow amen because his word is eternal so in John 14 and2 Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you ain't that right and if I go and he's revealing his plan to us that if I go and prepare a place for you then I will come again and receive you not receive another but if he preparing a place for you then he's going to come back and receive you that you may live with him ain't that right wherever he is you may be there also ain't that right amen see well that's God's Eternal Word so that that he's faithful he's a faithful God so he cannot lie Amen in in that and and so if if he said I go to prepare a place for you then that means you amen so then no one as the prophet said can take your place amen he's not preparing a place for you amen you could buy maybe someone bought you something and you've disappointed them so they say well I I forget that I'm going to give it to somebody else well that's not God you can't disappoint God enough Amen to make him give the place that he prepared for you to somebody else it it just God is faithful ain't that right amen James 1:17 it says there is no variableness or changing neither shadow of turning with the Father of Lights in other words the uh uh the one who gave uh uh gives light amen he's the father of lights and and and uh he gives light and yet there's no there there's no variableness there's no uh changing there's there's no shadow of turning around because God cannot lie you understand what I'm saying you you can't hold him responsible enough he holds himself responsible it's his nature it's his character it's it's what he is ain't that right amen so the prophet said God has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real see they're not simply like a man with blue a blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and are Eternal and part of God aren't you glad for that amen so so everything that is a part of God is eternal amen and what we're seeing is the faithfulness of God Amen we don't need a new book God's not writing a new Bible every word that he promised in this Bible he is fulfilling amen that that's exactly right your salvation wasn't new to God he ought already ordained that he's just showing his faithfulness to you in at this point amen see so in in Isaiah 5511 God said that my word that goeth forth out of my mouth shall not return unto me void it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sin it ain't that right Jesus said another place Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never it shall never pass away ain't that right so Paul would tell us in Hebrews 10 and 23 let us hold fast the profession or confession of our faith without what without wavering and I I think that that means something to us right there Amen Let Us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering don't don't let it go up and down without changing for he is faithful everybody say he is faithful that promised amen see so our our our uh uh one one uh uh um translation it says let us hold fast the confession of our faith keep it firmly secured without wavering see without fluctuating in opinion Allegiance or for direction can you say Amen see well God is faithful to his word so he will never fluctuate in his opinion of you he will never uh uh alter his his idea of you he will never change direction for you amen everything that he has said about you it's already Eternal it's the it's it's forever the same so he does not fluctuate in his allegiance to you his opinion to you or his direction to you ain't that right so now we are told amen that if we're going to base our our confession upon the word of God we have to know that he's faithful that promise so he'll never change he'll never alter he'll he he he will never fail so let us let us keep the confession of our faith without wavering let us not fluctuate let us not change in our opinion of him let us not change our Allegiance can you say Amen see the Promise is sure because he is faithful you see God will move the mountains to show that he is faithful he will roll back the Red Sea because he is faithful he wants to show himself as a faithful God can you say amen amen a lot of times he doesn't keep us from from uh uh from the Lion's Den he doesn't keep us from the things amen that would seem to devour us he allows us to face things but he wants to show to us that he is faithful to his word amen that's right he'll roll back the Red Seas he'll close the mouths of the lion to show that he is faithful to his word ain't that right to think of it he was made flesh and became Our Redeemer to show that he is faithful to his word amen we know what Redemption means it means to bring back Amen to uh uh bring back that which had fallen amen put it back to its rightful place its rightful condition ain't that right amen and he to show that he's faithful to his word amen became Our Redeemer amen he's the faithful Redeemer ain't that right amen and it goes to show that no matter how low a man has fallen and a woman has gone it doesn't matter how far amen as the song says God reach way the bottom for me amen he can do that because he's the faithful God ain't that right see amen could you imagine if he could not redeem all of his subjects amen then what's the point of trying to be a redeemer if he was limited in what he could do but he to show that he is faithful he allows us to go through all kinds of Hell allows us to go through all kinds of things allows us to be scarred and battled and and and all of the these things and yet here we stand tonight because God is faithful God is faithful can you say that God is faithful amen see now the prophet said the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption see people might be thinking like uh uh making like and think they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestinated amen see predestinated so God is faithful amen so we are loose by his own blood ain't that right which is a perfect blood Amen in Hebrews 10:4 for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified ain't that right he ain't going to do a halfway job amen God is faithful ain't that right amen he doesn't he doesn't make you a Halfway Christian amen if any if anything the devil makes a guy halfway amen but God will never make you a Halfway Christian you'll never be a halfway son a halfway daughter of God ain't that right God is faithful to his word and so by one offering he ha perfected forever amen them that are Sanctified now notice Hebrews 2 and7 it says wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest aren't you glad you got a faithful high priest amen amen he became and the faithful God became the high priest amen that he could we could have a faithful high priest amen no other high priest can be faithful amen but here is a faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sin of the people aren't you glad for that well what is a high priest it it makes uh uh intercession amen for the worshipper so he is the faithful high priest who Faithfully makes intercessions for you and I aren't you glad for that amen so so your your cloudy days doesn't affect him amen your ups and downs doesn't affect him your trials doesn't affect him your mistakes doesn't affect him he's the one that is faithful he's the one that is merciful he's the one that is Faithfully making intercession for you and I amen how else can you make it here tonight can you say Amen so we find Hebrews 7 and 24 this man because he continueth continueth forever a man hath an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them can you say Amen now but according to Hebrews uh 3 and 1 it says he is the high priest of our profession or confession he is the high priest of our confession and confession means to say the same thing as ain't that right amen see so he's the high faithful high priest priest of our confession brother brandham said he's the high priest of our confession then he cannot do one thing for you cannot make any intercession until you confess that it's done so now don't you waver hold fast to that confession of faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise can you say amen amen see so the the every the moment you start making your confession he is faithful to make intercession to that confession ain't that right he said see you until you confess that it's done see is that scripture he's the high priest of our confession then he can only act when we confess now there is no human being on the face of the Earth from time from the beginning of time to now or even till the end of time that could ever accuse God of not being faithful that's right amen that's right see amen the prophet says see when a man uh uh comes God's provided way amen then he will see him in his faithfulness when you come God's provided way because God is Not faithful Amen to the stock market God is Not faithful Amen to the president and what he says and the lies and and the things that are going on in a politician amen a politici can say it but God's not faithful to that he's faithful to his own word ain't that right yes sir he's faithful see so then John 1 John 1:9 says if everybody say if now that's a big one now if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness ain't that right amen see so first of all we've got to confess our sins and then we see his faithfulness step in amen and he's faithful and just to forgive our sins oh aren't you glad for that Amen to think that God was faithful he was fixing to send uh uh uh his wrath upon the Earth in the time of Noah that God's faithfulness to that elect amen that he would provide a prophet amen and through that Prophet would be established an ark amen as a way of Escape God was faithful to provide the ark as a way of Escape amen and then the elect amen were faithful everybody say faithful they were faithful Amen to believe the pro the the message that that Prophet was bringing and they got into the ark ain't that right and God was faithful to them for he his faithfulness he carried them over in all that Troubled Water he would never let that Ark drown his faithful elect was in that Ark and he was going to prove his faithfulness it was impossible for that boat to float amen but God was faithful they were not just resed in that Ark and the ability of that Ark they were resting in the god that they had believed in yes sir amen and God took them over into the new world Amen just before the death angel amen was getting ready to strike the land of Egypt amen God was faithful Amen to give them amen a divided way and told them to slay a lamb through the prophet of that day amen to slay the lamb and put the blood upon the door of the of the post amen God provided a token ain't that right and he said God told him this will be a token unto you amen that when I see the blood I will pass over you amen and those that had went in God's provided way amen God was faithful to them they didn't have to worry about it they didn't have to Fe here amen when they began to hear the screams they didn't have to go into panic mode and start popping pills and nerve pills and this and that and see the psychologist and the psychiatrist and go to the hospital and lose their minds you understand what I'm saying amen a lot of the sickness that is going on is because people are worrying too much but they didn't have to worry under that token because God was faithful to them ain't that right God was faithful you know the prophet said they didn't have to do nothing but just rest in God's provided way rest under that token and he said this for them to be scared would have been an insult to Jehovah amen for them to be scared would be an insult you see if God provides something for us amen and we don't trust him to be faithful in that amen then it's an insult to his very character his word ain't that right amen you see brother brandom gave the reason as to why so many Christians are afraid today he said they are afraid that God won't keep his word you realize that's an insult Amen to God when you're afraid that he won't keep his word the doctor says you're going to die but and then all of a sudden fear strike that's an insult Amen to God because you got a greater promise amen I am the god that Health thee can you say Amen he's faithful so the prophet said said see if a man once under the blood feels afraid that God won't keep his word it's an insult to him say Well Jehovah perhaps this is your word but I don't know whether it's right or or not oh shame on you amen why once under the blood he said I'm the Lord that Health Thee Well I believe it that's all don't insult him don't insult him he's faithful can you say amen amen and he'll move in his own timing he'll move when he wants to move but he's faithful to his word amen he he didn't promise us a Bed of Roses but he said I'll be with you he's faithful he's a faithful God do you believe that now the Bible talks about a faithful people amen and Moses was faithful in all his house Abraham is called the faithful Abraham uh Peter in his right writings mentioned a man uh named uh sylvanus and called him a faithful brother uh there are several men that Paul mentions in his writings and and calling them faithful Brothers uh faithful ministers and and and and these things even Paul himself uh uh speaking of himself said the Lord counted me faithful amen uh of the Lord he said I was counted faithful of the Lord and was put into the ministry amen then he tells Timothy a young Pastor he he says now he uh uh uh he talking about the word that he had heard uh uh that he had learned he said now commit that unto Faithful Men amen faithful faithful amen see Paul's letter that he wrote to the colossian church amen it was addressed to the Saints and the faithful brethren in Christ his letter to the Ephesian church was addressed to the Saints which are in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus I I think that's remarkable how he doesn't just say to the Saints but he makes sure that these men and these women are faithful they're they're they're faithful amen see amen and and brother Brandon uh said it was addressed to the called Chosen and faithful in Christ Jesus amen according to The Parables that that Jesus gave of this end time amen uh there there's uh uh uh there's going to be those who's going to hear the word amen when it's all said and done they're going to hear the words well done thou good and faithful not just thou servant well done my son my daughter but thou good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord God I I think God wants us to really understand that that that there's a faithful group of people that is upon this Earth amen and that's what he calls you is faithful faithful faith F amen that that's a term that God would use I I think that's an honor when God himself would call Us Faithful amen that's powerful amen Revelation 17 and4 it says thee shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called Chosen and faithful called and chosen and faithful can you say amen amen so the Believers of today amen we we look at the Through the Bible and we see the faithful ones but look at us today there is a people who are called and chosen and faithful amen faithful of called of God chosen of God and faithful to God Amen we talked a Wednesday night last Wednesday of how that people can be faithful to the wrong things and and yet our faithfulness is limited and all these things but there is a group when they're faithful to God a ain't that right now we we think of this the call and the choosing see the calling and choosing of God must be included in order for there to be faithfulness faithfulness well how can there be faithfulness in man alone amen for Isaiah 40 and6 says all flesh is as grass or is grass amen and all the good good thereof is as the flower of the field the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it or because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it surely the people is grass the grass withereth the fire fadeth but what the word everybody say the word of our God shall stand forever so there's really about man alone if you're just looking at man alone there's nothing that is faithful about him he's here today gone tomorrow so is his mind so is his thought so is his actions so is his plans everything about man he may have it today and could be gone tomorrow can you say amen that's right amen see so so if you take the word of the Lord out of man then the faithfulness cannot be found in him look through the history of mankind from the beginning of time to uh uh all the way there is absolutely no stability in Humanity a ain't that right anytime you look to a man you're going to be let down anytime you look to yourself you're going to be disappointed amen because faithfulness cannot be found in mankind but yet God would say that there is faithful people amen there's a Faithful Men faithful women faithful young people amen but this faithfulness for a minute that I'm speaking of aen is faithful to God and His word faithful to believe the word faithful to follow and obey the word faithful to confess the word faithful to consider that God is faithful can you say Amen they're faithful everything about this faithfulness in this people is faithfulness to the word of God now we're living in a in an age it's the greatest deception as we know the prophet told us a man ever known to man which is causing men to be unfaithful to the word of God now we talk about unfaithfulness there's so much unfaithfulness uh in marriages unfaithfulness uh to the job to the boss to the amen to anything anymore it's hard to trust people but but it's leaking more than anything it's unfaithfulness to God Amen unfaithfulness see unto the word of God and and Matthew 721 says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say unto me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity a ain't that right see so what were they they yes they done the miracle yes they prophesied yes they cast that devil but they were not faithful to the word of God which was the will of God ain't that right well see the carnal man won't allow us to be faithful to God Amen see because the carnal is enmity against God it cannot be subject to God or or to the law of God Amen it just it just isn't it's a wild nature it's it's rebellious can you say Amen so a man can be religious and not faithful to the word of God he can be a singer a musician even a minister and yet not faithful Amen to the word of God ain't that right and because people don't have have something within them to keep them faithful amen then they're going to be deceived Amen in this great age of deception for the Bible tells us that all who have not their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall wander after the Beast ain't that right and he made the whole world amen worship Him amen see both great and small rich and poor and and all of these things and Revelations 129 it says that the Great Dragon the old serpent called the devil and and uh deceiveth the whole world can you imagine that deceiveth the whole world but then Jesus would tell us but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved oh Church there's a people that's going to endure and God will call them faithful they are called and chosen and faithful can you say Amen well let's just put it just bluntly it's the predestinated that's going to remain it's the predestinated that's going to be faithful it's the predestinated that's going to endure amen see for Jesus already said it is impossible for that elect to to be deceived how many believes that it's impossible for that elect to be uh swayed and and and come under a deception for they are called in Christ and chosen in Christ and faithful in Christ yes sir the prophet said they have been chosen before the foundation of the world and are abiding everybody say abiding abiding in their calling amen they're not maybe doing a a lot of tricks and a lot of excitement but they're abiding can you say Amen they may not have a worldwide Ministry but they're abiding amen they might not be known by the world but they're abiding in their calling amen that's the greatest thing amen than anything that could ever be done is to abide abide in the promise abide in the word remain faithful Amen to the word of God Amen and they shall overcome amen they shall everybody say they shall they shall overcome no matter how bad it gets no matter how how low they feel no matter how discouraged it they seem amen they're going to overcome the enemy can you say Amen they're going to be faithful faithful faithful amen well how in the world are they going to do it how are they going to be faithful if faithfulness cannot be found in human Humanity how where's this faithful coming faithfulness coming from well Philippians 1 six being confident of this very thing that he everybody say he who's he the faithful God Amen he which has begun a good work in you will perform it will complete it amen he ain't going to save you today and lose you tomor he ain't going to fill you with his own life and say you're sealed only for you to be disappointed at the end if you're sealed if you're saved you always were saved you'll be saved tomorrow you'll be saved today you'll be Sav 10 years from now amen you'll be saved in the Rapture amen if he done it once he it's forever amen can you say Amen he's going to he's going to finish the work if he began it he's going to finish it can you say Amen Church aren't you glad for that amen see amen so well when did he begin the work amen well Romans 8:29 we all know it for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren more over whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also what glorified now he already began the work and I I'll say it this way he's already finished the work he began it he finished it way before you even started amen that's how faithful he is a amen that that's right see and so therefore predestinated you have a gene seed of God laying inside of you you believe it Prophet said it's God's Gene it's his Gene it's his seed that's right amen see so then what is it that makes a man faithful to God Amen well you know we were born Sinners as we know in our natural birth had a love for the world and the things of the world but the prophet said be then but then there was a little life grain of Life laying down in with in us we had a sinful nature but then there was another nature in Us by predestination brother brandom called it a little spot of eternal life down there the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there amen and I believe it's still working do you believe that amen see so while you was a sinner no matter what you had done and and and all these things and maybe even running away from church and running away from religion and God and this message or wherever you were there was still a gene seed of God that's laying in you that's why we believe amen that we can lay claim to our loved ones we can we believe that we can lay claim to our children amen it's a word of God it's a seed of God and God remains faithful to his word do you believe that amen now the prophet said we only catered to our F first birth our first nature because you know we didn't have that new birth and yet that genan seed was working working there all along Lord we couldn't be satisfied in the world we couldn't be satisfied in religion can you say amen I think all of us can can bear record to that we just weren't satisfied amen but but because there was something within us that was already working and that was that grain of eternal life amen see and and and the psalmist called it the Deep calleth unto the deep it was a desire amen something that was craving for God even though we didn't know we were craving for God Amen but there was it it was craving for God it was craving it was longing for something ain't that right amen couldn't be satisfied at the beer parties couldn't be be satisfied with the drugs it couldn't be satisfied with the sex it couldn't be satisfied with what the all this entertainment that the world had to offer is because there was that life that was laying there and the Deep was calling to the Deep amen it was a desire a desire for God can you say amen amen but notice Church a desire for God is not something that just automatically comes to every human being amen it it doesn't come by your natural birth amen the prophet said it's actually a creation amen for that desire to be in your heart God first had to create it amen he had to create that desire can you say amen he says see before you can have a desire there has to be a creator to create that desire I'm going to ask you how many desires for more of God do you desire to have more of God now see that's not humanly possible for you to do that especially in this age we look at all the enticements look at all the deception look at everything that's out there and yet there's something that is longing amen there's a lot of people that are just satisfied being baptized and and putting their name on the roll and and doing this and shaking a preacher hand they're satisfied with being preachers they're satisfied playing in church they're satisfied with with just joining into church a lodge it and all of these things but there's something in a true blue Born Again child of God a true seed of God that's Desiring for more of God reaching for more because God created that within you amen he created that amen Satan doing everything he can to stifle that but God will never let it be stifled right then you say amen God created that desire so the Bible says it is he that has made us and not we ourselves Paul would tell us I am what I am by the grace of God so that desire comes from that Eternal Gene seed that was placed in us we desire to be part of the promises of God we desire to to be saved and redeemed we desire to be in that Rapture and to live eternally with him we desire to walk with God we desire for all of his word to be made known to us we desire to be conformed to His Image amen we desire no matter how much it cuts and how much it hurts we desire for his character to be molded within us can you say amen amen see amen so he creates that desire and brother Brown said no man ever come to him empty and went away Desiring to be filled but what was filled amen so you'll never come to God Desiring something but what God won't give the heart's desire that's right see see so so here we find amen 1 Thessalonians 5:24 it says faithful everybody say Faithful Is He that calleth you who will also do it amen see Faithful Is He that calleth you who also will do it so it's not you just running all out here and wanting to be something and God's wanting something and your desire is being something different than what he is but he's already created desire amen for you to be like him yes sir see now the Bible says that we are the bride of Christ you believe that which means that we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life Spirit of his Spirit we are him she is him see we have his very own life within us ain't that right you see now notice after John baptized Jesus and uh he saw the spirit of God descending from heaven like an to a dove amen it was in the shape of a dove and it descended Upon Jesus see and and and and and we know that the holy spirit is represented as a dove because of its nature Amen brother brandham and speaking of uh the wings of a of a dove he says see the dove is a sign of Peace in every nation because of its gentleness and and innocence but also the dove whether male or female is always loyal amen faithful to its mate see and and so that's that's what was coming John saw that same nature coming into Christ and Christ says I can only do what the father first showed me to do my me is to do the will of him that sent me he was faithful he was faithful can you say amen he was faithful to you he was loyal to you you say well how can he be that he went to the cross for you he bore the shame for you he was willful he was despised and rejected he bore our sorrow he bore our shame he was loyal to you ain't that right but think of it see the spirit now is now upon the bride Same Spirit same life same nature amen ain't that right Romans 8:11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you ain't that right see you were you were going one way and something changed you around and you've never wanted to go that way again you never wanted to go out to the pool parties you never wanted to go out and drink and and curse and act like a you never wanted to take them drugs you never wanted to go out in the world again your desire has been changed can you say Amen why because you've received the spirit of that Dove amen that is within you and brother Bram says may I stop here just a moment and say this a true bride faithful or a female dove is loyal to her mate too see it won't eject in dogmas and any denominational doctrines or anything of the world it'll stay loyal to its mate the word always loyal aren't you glad he's made you Faithful yes sir see but also so the dove is a h loving bird amen and and so uh uh uh brother rown said it it for years it's been successfully used for a carrier pigeon they take that pigeon off somewhere long ways away and they'll let that pigeon loose and it'll go back home ain't that right he said because it loves home you turn it loose anywhere it'll always go back home it'll go home ain't that right well Church we've been loosed the Bible says we been loose from our sins amen we were slaves we were Vagabond we were a puppet to the devil but we've been loose by the blood of God by a perfect blood and the prophet said if it's a perfect blood that we've been loosed by then it's a perfect loosening and what are we doing we're going home we realize this ain't our home we were taken here but it's not our home can you say Amen yes sir we're going back to where we come from you you're talking about a faithful people that's right ain't that right a faithful people sir yes sir see so as the Eternal logos was manifested in Jesus Christ and him uh uh and in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily it was the Eternal Father manifested in flesh thereby gaining the title of son just paraphrasing what brother brandham said there and see then he says even we are Eternal in his thoughts and in time we have become the many membered spoken word seed manifest In the Flesh amen can you say Amen we are the Eternal thoughts of God made flesh ain't that right and and are the sons of God not going to be the sons we are Sons I hope you see that this face faithfulness that's going all the way through our lives God is faithful can you say Amen not just a thought of God but now the word becoming flesh right that thought becoming material and brother Bram said we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken amen can you say amen amen that's right now notice Philippians 2:13 it is God which worketh in you yes sir both to Will and to do it is God say it with me it is God which worketh in me in me both to Will and to do of his good pleasure pleas right aren't you glad for that so here 1 John 4:4 you are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in the heavens greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world is that what the Revelation said they are the called and chosen and faithful and they have overcome him right that's right oh man Church you think well I'm I'm just barely going to make it no no no you're called faithful now this has already been written of you Faithful well I don't know I might get deceived you if you're predestinated seed you can't get deceived it's already been written of you you're faithful yes sir called chosen faithful the book has already been written amen can you say Amen yes sir well see so brother brand would talk like this when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God yeah see Hallelujah he that is born of sin does not commit sin he cannot sin see Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit see there you are that throws your body see you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drinking if I could just just get in Christ and it's all gone because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they're dead your sins are buried in baptism and you are a new creation in Christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit tried to live a right kind of Life can you say Amen see so he says like you women claiming you got the Holy Ghost going out here wearing shorts and things how can you do that how could the spirit of God in you ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't be so certainly can't be it's not a filthy spirit it's a holy spirit but and then when you become subject to that Spirit see it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened Made Alive can you say amen and the B when the Bible says don't do this that body quickly turns to it there is no question Hallelujah on so who are the called The Chosen and faithful well brother BR says they are those the ones that resisted the devil's lie in the beginning amen the Lord hello that's us resisted the devil's lie in the beginning I know we we got our ups some downs but I'm I'm just telling you what your beginning was you resisted the devil's lie in the beginning amen ain't that right now God has promised that he's going to have a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish and somebody is going to be that can you say Amen somebody is going to be faithful to that that's right amen yes sir she going to be there this isn't a guessing game with God do you believe it now notice as God in his word made manifest in a man a perfect man so is God and His word coming again God and man became one his word he is that word become in man human flesh and became flesh amen now that word God and His word coming again making himself manifest in a bride and they ain't going to do like he did hbrd to something else un but the unadulterated word of God will be born into that church and she'll stand like Jesus Christ did with his Spirit anointing in his word we have may we may have been born Sinners we may have had a vile nature we may have been under the condemnation of sin and death but it wasn't by our own choice amen according to Romans 8 and 20 amen Paul would tell us that we were made subject to vanity not willingly ain't that right God made us subject to vanity for his own purpose amen the wisdom of God we were a thought amen which makes us an eternal attribute time does not change that amen can you say Amen nothing can change that you are an eternal attribute as an eternal thought ain't that right amen but we went the prophet said we went from attribute to the flesh to be tempted we bypassed our theophany and became flesh men to be tempted by sin we had to be tried and tested we we had to go through what the things that we did we had to know defeat and sorrow and failure but that's not our end can you say amen that's the that's only the temporary part of us so God is not calling Us Faithful when he looking at our sin and say that's faithful no we're not faithful to our sin I don't care if you got habits you're not faithful to that hello that's why we preach Deliverance that's right do you realize that you can never change your position as a Son of God never come on never amen hallelujah but what does change is your sinful life yes sir the powers of God can break them powers of Darkness to change that whole situation can you say Amen see so so the Bible doesn't call us defeated the Bible doesn't call us vagabonds the the Bible doesn't call us worthless and low life notice 1 John 3:1 behold what manner of love the father ha bestowed upon us that we should be called right now sons of God ain't that right and no he says the world knoweth us not because it knew him not it only sees The Human Side of us right it sees us in our weakness it sees us in our frailties it sees us in our Humanity can you say amen that's right see but they don't know that the same God that subjected us Amen to vanity is the same God that subjected us to a hope that's right come on now amen ain't that right so brother brand said being predestinated gives an eternal quality to the elect and you cannot get away from that so notice in this body of of corruption in in this in this world Amen all of these things brother Braham said it's here that we are formed to the word image to be partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey he said many of you can remember that you join this church and joined that church you try this and that nothing satisfied that's right but one day you just recognized it ain't that right there came a recognition hallelujah thank the Lord for that oh I love him amen it's just like the eagle story you know brother Bram talks about living with the chicken that little eaglet amen living with the chickens trying to cluck like the chickens but he was just ugly he was just odd brother Brown said see it's just because he couldn't understand how that little that hen would cluck and scratch on you know that manure pile and eat he just couldn't get that idea and she would say oh come over here and feast honey amen see but he was an eagle he just didn't eat like that it wasn't his food ain't that right tried to be one of them but he couldn't be amen because he was an eagle to began with his condition didn't change who he was ain't that right amen and your old corruptible body didn't change who you were this old world didn't change who you are amen all the sin the filth and all that couldn't change what you are talking about the faithfulness now God being faithful that's good yes sir amen you love him so the time that he began to recognize something is when Mama eagle flew over and begin to scream that's when he recognized who he was ain't that right and brother BR said that's the way it is with the gospel or the word or the power of Christ when a man has been predestinated to eternal life he hears that that true ring Scream Of God nothing can keep him from it the church might say well the days of Miracles just passed clck clck clck cluck clock you don't stand here and eat this and stand here and eat that that barnyard stuff won't do for him anymore he is gone all things are possible see he gets off the ground can you say Amen see that's why the matter with so many Christians today they can't get their feet off the ground oh man he says jump son you're an eagle come up here where I am and he said Mom but I've never jumped in my life well she says jump you jump you're an eagle to begin with oh do you hear that tonight you're an eagle to begin with with amen yes sir Glory you're not a chicken so he made his first jump flopped his wings didn't do too good but he got off the ground that's the way we do we accept God by Faith by the written word there is something in there that's it's that eternal life you were predestinated to it his Grandpa and Grandma were Eagles he was an eagle all the way back Eagles don't mix with other things he's not a hybrid no he's an eagle then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left that other thing why faithful faithful not faithful to your past not faithful to your sin not faithful Amen to what Satan says about you you become faithful Amen to God what God Said you then you have then been formed into the image of the Living God you heard from your theophany see if this Earthly body is dissolved we have one waiting ain't that right as we get ready to wind down Romans 12:2 amen Paul said be not conformed to this world but be ye what transformed amen be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that word to transform means something that's been changed something that's changed from one thing to another Amen to think you didn't just you didn't start out Amen to be everything that God wanted you to be amen but you were faithful to it faithful can you say Amen never going back to the world never going back to the thing that God brought you out of Amen you've been faithful and it's been changing you and changing you and changing you amen yes sir changed transformed 2 Corinthians 3:14 but we all with an open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so brother Bram said they are called The Chosen before the foundation of the world see and they are faithful to the word they're faithful to the word they're faithful to the promises they're not looking at and say man I just don't know how I'm going to do it they're faithful faithful can you say Amen faithful why it's a magnet that's pulling them they're faithful they see a Rapture that's at hand can you say Amen entertainment ain't going to stop them they're faithful Lord Hall that's right yes sir they're faithful to the word amen he oh I like that one called chosen before the world foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing they're not being made to do it it's by something that's within them it's a desire if you don't want to do it don't do it if you want to cluck around cluck around but don't expect me to join you and eat the old from the manure pile that's not what I'm called to do that's not what I I may be in the world I may be your next door neighbor but don't you worry about me I've got a different pattern there is something that is drawing me can you say Amen we ain't going to lay down we ain't giving up we ain't quitting I don't care what the battles are I don't care what the pressure is I don't care where we're at we're not going to Qui it's already been written they're faithful faithful to the word of God can you say Amen oh do you love him faithful now we're not a Superman we ain't got superpowers Superwoman the way the world looks at things amen we're not working up some magic trick yep amen we make mistakes we fail brother BR said we backslide every day and we'd all have to say Amen to that am can't get too humble enough to or too proud enough to say you you you don't make mistakes on I guarantee every one of us has got regrets not just regrets in as a sinner but even regrets as we've walked our Christian life amen we we've made all of these things and and there are days that we don't feel like we're going to make it there are days where it just seems like we're not making any progress it just seemed like God ain't answering the prayer can you say amen amen it just seem like the sun ain't going to shine again and we wonder and wonder and wonder amen and it just seem like nothing say there's days that we have questions and we entertain thoughts that are negative yes sir hello now can you say amen amen see we a we we ain't born with with all of this Amen to where we're just trialfree and perfect free or or whatever see amen but here's what here's our confidence and here is the answer as to why we keepay pressing on Amen for Proverbs 24:16 it says for a just man fth seven times and rise this back up faithful faithful can you say Amen faithful how can we rise how can we rise when there's nothing in us that is faithful nothing in us about our flesh That Makes Us Faithful amen well Psalms 37:23 the steps of a good men are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand aren't you glad that the Lord is upholding You by every right he should cast you away they said no no no I've got them in my hand and I'm going to uphold them with my right hand yes sir well that should make you excited Psalms 37 and 39 the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help them and deliver them and he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him that's right amen aren't you glad for that the Lord is faithful yes he is aren't you glad he's faithful yes he is if musicians will come wonderful praise the Lord let's sing
