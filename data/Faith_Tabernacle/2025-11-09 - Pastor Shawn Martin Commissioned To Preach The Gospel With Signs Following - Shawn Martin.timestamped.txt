[35:07] Oh worthy is [singing] the lamb that
[35:11] [music] was slain
[35:13] for us.
[35:15] [music] Son of God, a man, you are high
[35:20] [singing] and lifted [music]
[35:21] up
[35:23] and all the world will praise your great
[35:27] [singing]
[35:28] name. [music]
[35:32] [singing]
[35:34] Amen. Do you believe his name is great
[35:36] this morning? [music]
[35:37] Amen.
[35:54] Um, this is something I sing a lot, but
[35:56] his strength is perfect. And I'm just
[35:59] going to say that's what I found to be
[36:00] true in all these years.
[36:03] [clears throat]
[36:04] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[36:05] &gt;&gt; I can do all things
[36:09] through Christ who gives me [singing]
[36:12] strength.
[36:14] But sometimes [music]
[36:15] I wonder what he can do through me.
[36:19] [singing]
[36:23] No great [music] success to show.
[36:28] No glory [singing] of my own.
[36:32] Yet in my weakness, he [singing] is
[36:34] there to let me [music]
[36:37] know.
[36:40] His [singing] strength is perfect.
[36:43] When our strength [music] is gone,
[36:49] he'll carry [singing] us when we can't
[36:54] carry on.
[36:58] Raised in his [singing] power,
[37:01] the weak [music] become strong.
[37:07] His strength is perfect.
[37:11] His strength [singing]
[37:12] is perfect.
[37:16] [music]
[37:19] We [singing] can only know
[37:23] the power that [singing] he holds
[37:25] [music]
[37:27] when we truly see how deep our weakness
[37:31] [music] goes.
[37:36] His strength [singing] in us begins
[37:38] [music]
[37:40] where ours comes to an end.
[37:44] He hears our humble cry [music] and he
[37:48] [singing] proves again.
[37:52] His strength is perfect
[37:55] when our strength is gone.
[37:59] [singing and music]
[38:01] He'll carry us when we [singing] can't
[38:06] carry on.
[38:10] raised in [singing] his power.
[38:13] The weak [music]
[38:15] become strong.
[38:19] His strength [singing] is perfect.
[38:23] His strength [music] is perfect.
[38:28] Oh, we [music and singing] can only know
[38:33] the power that he holds.
[38:37] When we truly see how deep [music] our
[38:40] weakness goes,
[38:45] his strength [singing] in us [music]
[38:47] begins.
[38:50] where ours comes to an end.
[38:54] He hears our humble cry and he proves
[38:58] [music and singing]
[38:59] again.
[39:02] His strength is perfect when our
[39:06] strengths [singing]
[39:07] all gone.
[39:10] He [music] carries us when we can't
[39:15] carry [singing] on.
[39:19] Raised in his power,
[39:22] the weak become strong.
[39:25] [music and singing]
[39:28] His strength is perfect.
[39:32] His [singing] strength is perfect.
[39:37] His strength is perfect. When our
[39:41] strength's all [singing]
[39:42] gone,
[39:45] he'll carry us. When we can't carry on,
[39:54] raised in his power,
[39:57] the weak [music]
[39:58] becomes so strong.
[40:03] His strength it's [music and singing]
[40:05] perfect. His strength is perfect.
[40:11] Raised in his power,
[40:14] the weak becomes [singing]
[40:18] strong.
[40:20] His strength is perfect. [music]
[40:25] His strength
[40:27] it's perfect.
[40:38] You believe his strength is perfect this
[40:40] morning. Amen. Can we stand to our feet
[40:42] as we invite our pastor to come?
[40:51] &gt;&gt; How great are you, Lord?
[40:54] [music]
[40:57] How great is your mercy. [singing]

[43:55] Lord?
[43:59] Your loving [singing] kindness
[44:03] [music]
[44:05] is feeling my heart [singing]
[44:07] as I see. How great are you, Lord?
[44:10] [music]
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad you serve [music]
[44:16] a great God?
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um he's undefeated.
[44:22] Amen. And we're so glad that we're in
[44:24] his hands.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; And there's just no way we can lose.
[44:27] Amen.
[44:29] We love him and it's good to be here in
[44:32] the house of the Lord. The musicians can
[44:33] be dismissed.
[44:35] Amen. And uh trust you're glad to be
[44:38] here.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful day today and um so
[44:43] we're going to take advantage of it.
[44:45] Amen. I hear it's supposed to be pretty
[44:46] cold tomorrow. So, um, anyways, but if
[44:51] you have your Bibles, we're going to
[44:52] turn to,
[44:54] um, the book of Mark, the 16th chapter.
[44:59] And, um,
[45:04] so, as it's been said, um, we Heather's
[45:10] birthday today. She's turned 40. And um
[45:13] I don't know if she wanted me to
[45:14] announce that or not, but I uh thought I
[45:17] saw a cowboy up on her this morning, so
[45:19] I had to kind of dust it off of her. But
[45:22] uh anyway, we certainly appreciate uh my
[45:26] wife. And she has just been a true
[45:29] blessing to me and the family. Amen. And
[45:33] u uh you know, she had no clue what
[45:36] ministry was all about. And um it was
[45:40] just really her and her uh Mindy and her
[45:43] mom uh for many years. And so we got
[45:48] married and her world just turned upside
[45:52] down. I say for the better, but uh I
[45:55] don't know.
[45:56] But uh we were uh coming home on our
[45:59] honeymoon and talking about getting, you
[46:02] know, school uh books and stuff for the
[46:06] children and uh at five and wanting
[46:09] getting ready to be a teenager or was a
[46:11] teenager and then we come up here and
[46:14] and moved and and uh so but she's
[46:18] endured and been a real support and
[46:23] &gt;&gt; um so we really thank the Lord for that.
[46:26] She said, "I've never been to so many
[46:28] hospitals in my life. Never participated
[46:31] in funerals and so much in my life."
[46:34] Amen. But that's just part of ministry.
[46:36] And she's done a good job.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we want to remember Brother
[46:42] Wayne um will be here with us December
[46:46] 19th through the 21st. And um so just
[46:50] keep that in mind. And [clears throat]
[46:52] um we had a wonderful uh uh time last
[46:57] week at the fall festival and uh trust
[47:00] you all had a a a good time. Just a
[47:02] wonderful day uh time of fellowship and
[47:06] just thanks uh thank everyone who
[47:09] participated and all that you've done
[47:11] and thanks to sister Kim for getting it
[47:14] together. Amen. And organizing it all.
[47:17] And so we appreciate that. And uh we
[47:21] want to continue praying for Sister
[47:23] Janice and and um uh the family [snorts]
[47:28] and the Lord will just continue to
[47:30] comfort them and guide them and help
[47:33] them in this time. And um I know it's a
[47:39] a peace to to them knowing that uh
[47:42] brother Bob's made it with the Lord and
[47:45] he was ready to go. Uh but it doesn't uh
[47:49] help the fact that um he's gone and um
[47:53] uh I know he will be missed and and uh
[47:57] so we want to just keep them in our
[48:00] prayer. There's one thing about it is uh
[48:03] it ain't going to be too much longer and
[48:06] um [clears throat] we'll be uh leaving
[48:09] this place. Amen. And u so um I had
[48:13] heard about three days ago um the pope
[48:16] uh invited
[48:19] uh uh members of the joint committee of
[48:23] the council of European bishops
[48:25] conference and the conference of the
[48:28] European churches
[48:30] [clears throat]
[48:31] and they said it was a gathering of
[48:33] Roman Catholics, Orthodox and
[48:35] Protestants and they came together at
[48:37] the Vatican for the signing of a new
[48:40] ecumenical ical charter which was preh
[48:43] presented to the pope and um one
[48:47] archbishop uh reflected on the
[48:50] significance of the presenting of the
[48:53] updated charter to the pope and calling
[48:57] their time together a blessing. It's not
[49:00] a theological note, he said, but it is a
[49:02] joint statement of how we as Christians,
[49:06] both Catholic and the rest of the
[49:08] Christians in Europe, see our joint
[49:10] witness of Christianity.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; And um there's a couple others uh that
[49:16] had given a statement and and um so we
[49:20] we see this this they're they're uniting
[49:23] religion and um it's all working behind
[49:26] the scenes. Uh but we know that um
[49:30] that's just uh another day closer for us
[49:34] getting going home. And so we must keep
[49:37] our eyes upon the Lord. Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Uh before we go into the word, let's
[49:43] just bow our heads and we'll just talk
[49:46] to the Lord here. Father,
[49:50] Lord, it is a
[49:53] a blessing
[49:55] to be able to have our eyes opened
[49:59] and to know what is going on in this day
[50:04] and not have to fear, but we rejoice
[50:08] because we know our redemption drawth
[50:10] nigh.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Father, there's so many people that
[50:14] don't know. They're just going blindly
[50:17] in life and not not understanding
[50:22] what's ahead in the future. They feel
[50:25] something taking place. They know that
[50:28] the world is falling apart and they're
[50:31] trying to fix it. But Father, we're
[50:34] looking to another kingdom that's that's
[50:37] come and and Lord, your reign will be
[50:41] here upon the earth. And father, we're
[50:44] so glad to be a part of it. And I pray,
[50:47] Father, that you would just move today.
[50:51] And uh what words we would have, let it
[50:54] be of you. And let them be anointed,
[50:58] Father, from on high. And Lord, that it
[51:01] would uh uh place us, Lord, and position
[51:06] us. and Father that we could see the
[51:10] responsibility that we have and and Lord
[51:14] what you've called us to do in this age.
[51:17] I pray Father that you'd give us
[51:19] understanding and Lord just anoint both
[51:22] speaker and hearer in Jesus Christ's
[51:25] name.
[51:27] Amen. And amen.
[51:29] So we we look uh Mark 16 and and we know
[51:34] it uh 15th we'll start there Jesus here
[51:39] speaking and he saith unto them go you
[51:42] into all the world and preach the gospel
[51:45] to every creature
[51:47] and he that is bapt or believeth and is
[51:49] baptized shall be saved but he that
[51:51] believeth not shall be damned and these
[51:54] signs shall follow them that believe in
[51:57] my name they shall cast out devils. They
[52:00] shall speak with new tongues. They shall
[52:02] take up serpents. And if they drink any
[52:04] deadly thing, it shall not hurt them.
[52:07] They shall lay hands on the sick, and
[52:09] they shall recover. Amen. You can have
[52:14] your seats this morning.
[52:17] And um if I were to to take a title
[52:22] um it would be commissioned to preach
[52:24] the gospel with signs following the
[52:28] believer.
[52:29] And um of course Jesus is uh speaking to
[52:35] the church, not just to uh the the
[52:39] disciples, but uh all the way I believe
[52:43] it applies to this day. this scripture.
[52:46] If there's any a scripture that is
[52:49] applicable to us, it's it's that
[52:51] scripture for this day. But he's telling
[52:55] us the
[52:57] that that we have a position and this
[52:59] position is a position of authority.
[53:03] It's um uh and and so uh the things that
[53:10] once ruled us, we are in the position to
[53:14] rule it.
[53:16] um
[53:17] we're no longer a servant to it, but
[53:19] it's a servant to us.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; And it's because that uh it was
[53:24] defeated. Satan was defeated at Calvary
[53:29] uh through the works of Christ.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; And so uh we we find that sin
[53:36] uh in empowered uh Satan at the
[53:41] beginning. Unbelief. Sin is unbelief and
[53:45] man's disobedience
[53:47] uh empowered Satan uh there in the
[53:51] beginning. But then uh when Christ
[53:55] destroyed sin, it destroyed or he
[53:58] destroyed the works of sin,
[54:02] &gt;&gt; the results of sin. Ain't that right?
[54:05] So, so as um uh revelations would say,
[54:10] we have been loosed
[54:13] uh by the blood of Jesus Christ. It's um
[54:16] by God's own blood. It's it's it's a
[54:19] loosening. And uh the Bible says that he
[54:23] that the son has set free is free
[54:26] indeed.
[54:27] uh a a it's not just uh part free and
[54:32] part bound, but you're free indeed. It's
[54:35] a perfect blood that brought forth a
[54:38] perfect loosening. Ain't that right?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the prophet said the loosening
[54:43] is perfect and complete. Amen. And so
[54:47] then that tells us that Satan has no
[54:50] legal right over us. It has no legal
[54:53] right. So, so our position is not
[54:56] overcoming nations. And we we don't have
[55:00] a national power. That's that's not our
[55:03] power. And and we don't we don't even
[55:07] have a religious power. That's not our
[55:09] power. Uh but but our power comes from
[55:13] God.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so um so Satan has no legal
[55:18] right over us. And the word legal, I
[55:21] just looked up legal right. It's a claim
[55:24] recognized by law for the purpose of
[55:28] securing it. Amen. The interest in a
[55:32] claim which is recognized by and
[55:35] protected by sanctions of law imposed by
[55:38] a state which a enables one to possess
[55:41] property. So we have a legal right.
[55:45] Satan has no legal right. But we do have
[55:48] a legal right.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Satan has no claim to us. We
[55:52] are no longer Satan's property. Amen.
[55:56] But we do have legal rights. So he was
[55:59] defeated, but we were uh uh put in a
[56:02] position, amen, to claim what is
[56:06] rightfully ours.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; And so therefore, Satan cannot take
[56:10] possession since he is not the rightful
[56:13] owner of us.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But not only are we loose, but the
[56:18] Bible says that he has been he has made
[56:22] us kings and priests unto our God. Ain't
[56:26] that right? So, we're kings and priests.
[56:29] Uh not only loosed, but kings and
[56:32] priests. Uh uh we have been made. And
[56:36] and so now, Brother Brandon uh uh
[56:40] preached the word uh preached on this
[56:42] word Messiah. and he talked about it a
[56:44] lot. But if you go and listen to the
[56:47] message, the Messiah. Uh but brother
[56:51] Brand says Messiah means the anointed
[56:54] one or it could be used the anointed
[56:58] king.
[56:59] So I I I I think of that because we are
[57:04] anointed ones as the prophet would say
[57:07] and we are anointed kings.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Not just king. We we're not just having
[57:13] the title king uh but we are anointed
[57:18] kings.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; We are empowered.
[57:22] Amen. By God.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Now a king is one that holds a p a
[57:29] preeminent position. Amen. A king and
[57:33] that word preeminent means supreme.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; So a king holds a supreme position. And
[57:41] a king also has a domain. Now u this
[57:46] word domain is a territory
[57:50] over which dominion is exercised.
[57:54] So we we look at God. God is the great
[57:57] king. He's the Messiah. Ain't that
[58:00] right?
[58:01] &gt;&gt; He's the anointed one. He's the He's uh
[58:04] uh uh he's king of kings.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; We're kings. We've been made kings, but
[58:10] he's king of kings. He's our king.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and and the
[58:17] prophet said the church is his domain.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; God exercises his authority,
[58:25] his dominion
[58:27] uh uh over his church.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; So then, Revelations 15:3 calls him king
[58:35] of saints.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad he's your king?
[58:40] &gt;&gt; King of saints. So he as king rules over
[58:45] his domain, the church working his own
[58:50] will.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and uh uh if if you're a
[58:55] believer, if you're born again, you're
[58:58] part of this church, then then then
[59:01] you're you're part of his domain. True.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Then he's going to exercise his rights.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; He's going to exercise his authority.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; And and he's going to work his own will
[59:16] in the church. For the church, the
[59:18] prophet said, is God's kingdom.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. And a kingdom is a rim or
[59:26] region in which something is dominant.
[59:30] An area or sphere in which one holds a
[59:35] preeminent preeminent position. Amen.
[59:39] Amen. See? Amen. So it's not a kingdom
[59:42] unless there's a king to rule over it.
[59:45] But when a king is positioned on in in h
[59:50] authority, then he's got a place to rule
[59:54] and he's ruling in his kingdom. Well,
[59:58] his church is his kingdom.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we feel the effects of his
[1:00:05] of his reign.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not that that when we get
[1:00:10] to heaven, then we'll come under him.
[1:00:13] We're already under him. We are already
[1:00:17] affected by his supreme rule.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But now the church has
[1:00:24] a domain because they are anointed
[1:00:28] kings.
[1:00:30] Amen. Now the prophet said, "Our
[1:00:32] dominion is a dominion over sin."
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Our dominion is a dominion over sin.
[1:00:42] Paul wrote in in uh uh Romans 6:17
[1:00:47] saying, "God be think that you were the
[1:00:50] servants of sin. You were you you you
[1:00:54] were enslaved to sin. You done what the
[1:00:57] devil wanted you to do
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; because of your desires and and all of
[1:01:02] these things, but you have obeyed from
[1:01:04] the heart that form of doctrine which
[1:01:07] was delivered unto you." So I say we're
[1:01:10] no longer sinners.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; We're not sinners. We're kings.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. With authority, with the rule,
[1:01:20] with the reign. Uh see, you you cannot
[1:01:24] have dominion over sin and still be a
[1:01:27] sinner.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh uh there there's just no such
[1:01:34] thing. See, so so sickness and diseases
[1:01:38] and death and bondage are the result of
[1:01:42] sin.
[1:01:43] Therefore, we have dominion over it.
[1:01:47] [snorts]
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; We have dominion over sickness.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; We have dominion over over death.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; We have dominion over diseases. We have
[1:01:55] dominion over bondages and our habits
[1:01:59] and and all of these things. Can you say
[1:02:01] amen? And I I say this, you'll never
[1:02:04] find God's people defeated unless
[1:02:07] they're living in a backsliding
[1:02:09] condition.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's the only time you
[1:02:12] saw Israel defeated is when they lived
[1:02:15] in a backsliden condition.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; It was only when Achen took something,
[1:02:21] amen, that belonged to the enemy and put
[1:02:23] it in his house, hid it in his tent,
[1:02:27] amen, that Israel lost the battle.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Every time Israel
[1:02:34] become backslid, they were weak before
[1:02:36] the enemy. Amen. Every time that they
[1:02:39] were in idolatry and and disobeying God,
[1:02:43] Amen. the enemy could prevail over them.
[1:02:46] Amen. Uh to where they become victims.
[1:02:49] But God never intended the church to
[1:02:52] become victims.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Now, Acts 1:8, it
[1:02:58] says, "But you shall receive power." I
[1:03:00] say power after that the Holy Ghost has
[1:03:04] come upon you and you shall be witnesses
[1:03:06] unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea
[1:03:10] and in Samaria and and unto the
[1:03:13] uttermost parts of the earth. Amen. You
[1:03:16] shall receive power after the Holy
[1:03:19] Ghost. Uh you shall receive authority.
[1:03:21] Amen. uh Luke 24:49,
[1:03:25] "Behold, I send the promise of my father
[1:03:28] upon you, but ter ye in the city of
[1:03:31] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:03:34] from on high." This isn't a national
[1:03:37] power. This isn't political power. This
[1:03:40] isn't church power. This power descends
[1:03:43] from on high. That's right.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; And it it came on the day of Pentecost.
[1:03:48] Ain't that right? This power came on the
[1:03:51] day of Pentecost. Amen. And that when
[1:03:54] the church was established is when that
[1:03:57] quickening power quickened the mortal
[1:04:00] body. Amen. Of of the 120. God came
[1:04:05] down. Amen. And anointed each person
[1:04:10] that was in that upper room with the
[1:04:12] Holy Ghost. The prophet said he's sent
[1:04:15] back his holy spirit to anoint his
[1:04:17] church and set in this church gifts to
[1:04:22] represent him to the peoples.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; So the church is an ambassador. The
[1:04:30] church is the ambassador for Christ. Any
[1:04:33] of us that's part of the church, you
[1:04:36] cannot be a part of the church without
[1:04:38] having the same spirit that fell on the
[1:04:41] day of Pentecost come inside of you.
[1:04:44] Amen. And anoint you. Amen. And send you
[1:04:48] out as an ambassador.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; We're all ambassadors for Christ. Ain't
[1:04:52] that right? You daddies, you mamas, you
[1:04:55] your Sunday school teachers, your
[1:04:57] children. Amen. Preachers and and and
[1:05:00] whatever else. We're all [screaming]
[1:05:02] ambassadors if we're part of the church
[1:05:06] of Jesus Christ. Can you say amen?
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Now, this is something we've heard. You
[1:05:12] never you don't hear it much. Uh I I
[1:05:15] well
[1:05:17] it was the prophet that brought it to us
[1:05:19] and and and but
[1:05:22] Genesis 1:26 it it it shows that God
[1:05:28] made man to be a God
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; to begin with.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; He was made to be a God. God just didn't
[1:05:37] uh make man and then said, you know, I I
[1:05:39] I'm I'm uh going to make you a God or
[1:05:43] you can be a God. God purposefully
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; made him to be a God.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? For we we find and and
[1:05:53] and and uh uh we find that God said,
[1:05:56] "Let us make man in our own image and
[1:06:00] the likeness in our likeness." Ain't
[1:06:02] that right? Well, that image, the
[1:06:03] prophet said, was a holy image. It was
[1:06:06] the holy image of God. And and we must
[1:06:09] not let this pass us. I I know we hear
[1:06:11] it, you know, a lot. We know it. We're
[1:06:14] acquainted with it. But but church, if
[1:06:16] there's ever a time that we need to
[1:06:17] grasp this and and take it to heart,
[1:06:20] it's now
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; in the age that we're living.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; But but man had hands. The prophet says
[1:06:27] man had hands like God. He had feet like
[1:06:29] God, eyes and ears and intelligence like
[1:06:33] God. His whole fiber was like God
[1:06:36] because he was uh uh a son of gods.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; See, and so we find that man was given
[1:06:43] dominion over the fish and uh of of and
[1:06:46] and over the cattle. He was given
[1:06:49] dominion over every bird. He was given
[1:06:52] dominion uh uh over the waves and the
[1:06:55] winds and all that. Brother Billy Ram
[1:06:58] said he had complete supreme control of
[1:07:01] the earth. He was a god of the earth.
[1:07:04] God's the god of the universe
[1:07:06] everywhere. But his son had this earth
[1:07:10] under his control.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; He could speak. He could name. He could
[1:07:15] say, he could stop nature. He could do
[1:07:18] anything he wanted to. Adam could say,
[1:07:20] "Let this mountain be moved here uh uh
[1:07:24] here be moved over there." And it would
[1:07:26] do it. Adam could say, "Let this tree
[1:07:28] here be plucked up and planted over
[1:07:30] here." It would do it. For he had
[1:07:33] complete supreme control.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; God made him to have complete supreme
[1:07:41] control.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Adam did not stand there and act like
[1:07:48] everything was out of control.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Everything was under his control.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. Ain't that right?
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; See, so so we had complete supreme
[1:08:00] control as a minor God under God our
[1:08:04] father because he was a son of God.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Now, so when he sinned, that holy image
[1:08:11] of God left him.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; And Adam, the prophet said, lost his
[1:08:15] inheritance, the earth.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Now it passed from his hand to the one
[1:08:19] he sowed out to, Satan. He sowed his
[1:08:23] faith in God to Satan's reasoning.
[1:08:25] Therefore, his eternal life,
[1:08:28] his right to the tree of life, his right
[1:08:31] to the earth belonged to him and he
[1:08:34] forfeited every bit to the hands of
[1:08:36] Satan. He passed it from his hand to
[1:08:39] Satan. And therefore, amen, he says it
[1:08:42] returned and has been repu uh uh
[1:08:45] polluted and the seed of Adam has
[1:08:47] destroyed the inheritance that Adam
[1:08:49] should have had. Uh, and that's the
[1:08:51] earth. See, so Adam fell from his
[1:08:55] position
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; as a son of God. Ain't that right?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; He He didn't lose the fact that he was
[1:09:01] son of God. He just fell from his
[1:09:04] position
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; as a son of God. See, sons of God has a
[1:09:08] position.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; God never just intended us to have the
[1:09:13] name sons and daughters of God. There's
[1:09:16] a position that comes with this.
[1:09:19] Adam as a son of God never changed that
[1:09:22] fact. But he fell from his position.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; So as a son of God, he could never
[1:09:28] conduct himself as a son of God. That's
[1:09:30] right.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; He could never rule as a son of God.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so Adam fell from his
[1:09:40] position. And and the prophet says Adam
[1:09:43] and Eve forfeited their rights of the
[1:09:45] word. They forfeited their rights of the
[1:09:49] word, the promises, their inheritance.
[1:09:53] So in other words, no longer did their
[1:09:56] words have meaning.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Their words became godless. Their words
[1:10:01] became harmful. Their words, amen,
[1:10:05] became uh uh just just by words.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? But Adam knowing that
[1:10:15] he had a rule by his words,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; you didn't find him just speaking words
[1:10:21] just out of out of character.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Because he knew that his words had
[1:10:27] meaning.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; He knew his words had power. A
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; ain't that right? He believed in his
[1:10:33] words because he had a position of
[1:10:36] authority.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Come on now. [clears throat]
[1:10:41] Now, brother Bram says, "Now, if the
[1:10:43] blood has cleansed it back, what about
[1:10:46] now?"
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Look what that son of God, the second
[1:10:50] Adam did. See, the second Adam, he had
[1:10:53] the authority, right?
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He could speak and it happened.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He could call the man that'd been
[1:10:59] dead four days, started already
[1:11:01] corruption. Amen. And called it back to
[1:11:03] life. Amen. And and and and when he
[1:11:06] said, "Lazarus, come forth." There was
[1:11:08] enough power in them words to bring
[1:11:11] restoration. Whatever them skin worms
[1:11:14] ate, Amen. Lazarus came back restored
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; because there was power [screaming]
[1:11:21] in them words.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; There was a son of God upon the earth in
[1:11:26] flesh, the second Adam. Not just a son,
[1:11:30] the only begotten son, but a son that
[1:11:33] had position. A son [screaming]
[1:11:36] that could speak to the winds. A son
[1:11:38] that could speak to the waves. A son, a
[1:11:41] man, that could speak. And eyes would
[1:11:44] come open.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus lived a life of power and
[1:11:52] authority. There was no demon that could
[1:11:55] stop him.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; I think as brother Brown said, he never
[1:11:58] did attend a funeral.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. never did.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz cuz one time the Bible says he
[1:12:07] stopped a funeral possession that was
[1:12:10] going by and he just raised that dead
[1:12:13] up.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't no need for a funeral.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. No demon could kill him.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, he died." Yeah.
[1:12:26] But he says, "I give my life."
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; No one took it from him. No demon took
[1:12:31] it from him. Right.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. They tried to take it,
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't take it.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; So he says, "I give my life."
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. No demon could defeat him in his
[1:12:44] work.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; He's a second man, Adam. Now, Brother
[1:12:48] Brandon says, "See what he was to us is
[1:12:52] back life."
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; See? See? So God purposefully would
[1:12:56] record Jesus's life by the gospels. them
[1:13:01] gospels were protecting this life.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Writing it down. Amen. For us.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Well, why? Brother Ram said he gave us
[1:13:14] what he was so that we would not be
[1:13:18] deceived in what he is today.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; See, oh, the devil would like us to be
[1:13:28] formal and say, "Oh, I got the Holy
[1:13:29] Ghost. I got the Holy Ghost. I got God
[1:13:31] living in me and no power, no nothing.
[1:13:34] Just worldly, lukewarm, halfbackslid,
[1:13:38] the devil just stomping all over us and
[1:13:40] we just looking like everything's
[1:13:42] impossible. We just don't know what to
[1:13:44] do and and and we're just victims and
[1:13:46] all that. Oh, no, no, no. Amen. So,
[1:13:49] brother Brown says God would have this
[1:13:51] recorded, his backlife in the Bible so
[1:13:55] that we would not be deceived to where
[1:13:58] we could know what he is today.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, I like that. Don't take
[1:14:06] anybody's word for it. Take God's word
[1:14:08] for it."
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "He that believeth on
[1:14:11] me, the works that I do shall he do
[1:14:14] also." And the devil would have us to
[1:14:16] believe that that scriptur is only to
[1:14:18] brother Brandham. Brother Brandham said
[1:14:19] that does he said that's to every
[1:14:22] believer. The works that I do shall you
[1:14:25] do also. That's to every believer.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus also said a little while and the
[1:14:30] world seeth me no more yet you shall see
[1:14:33] me for I'll be with you even in you to
[1:14:36] the end of the world. The Bible also
[1:14:38] says it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:14:40] yesterday, today and forever. So what he
[1:14:44] was back then, he's still God today.
[1:14:46] Brother Graham said he's the same in
[1:14:48] every detail that he was back then, he
[1:14:52] is today except the corporal body.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; He doesn't need the corporal body on
[1:14:58] this earth because you're his body.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brown says, "Well, how do
[1:15:07] we know?" People say, People say, "Well,
[1:15:09] how do we know?" They say, "Well, well,
[1:15:11] I believe that." Jesus said, "These
[1:15:14] signs shall follow them that believe.
[1:15:16] Those signs are not upon you." Said,
[1:15:19] "Well, they may be. Probably they will."
[1:15:23] Well, they ought to. He said, "They
[1:15:25] shall.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; They shall follow them." Everybody say,
[1:15:29] "They shall.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; They shall follow them that believe."
[1:15:32] Well, how many is a believer?
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Then they shall follow you. Hallelujah.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Not not wishing for it to happen. They
[1:15:42] shall happen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Get out of that wish mode. Get out
[1:15:46] of that, well, I wonder if it will
[1:15:48] happen. They shall follow.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; He says, see, and what did he leave? He
[1:15:56] left his back life to show us what he
[1:15:59] was.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; That's what's behind us so we can tell
[1:16:04] what's going to be in us.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] Isn't that wonderful?
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, all that's behind us, his
[1:16:12] back life of 2,000 years ago. Amen. And
[1:16:16] that's fine. Amen. But let's not just
[1:16:18] build a try to get warned by a painted
[1:16:20] fire.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; That's only there to show what it's
[1:16:25] going to be in us.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So the redeemed church as we
[1:16:36] know started on the day of Pentecost in
[1:16:39] seed form.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; And God has been building his church
[1:16:43] through these seven ages.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Uh um and the and the prophet said
[1:16:49] building a bride for the same thing he
[1:16:54] made Adam.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; It is he that made us, not ourselves.
[1:17:02] Yeah, that's right.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Now, now you know I I just pray God gets
[1:17:05] it to us this morning and hope I can
[1:17:07] make some sense to you.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; But you see, why are you here?
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Why are you in the message?
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why are you in this age?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Just to set on a pew
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; just because it was your good wish to do
[1:17:21] that. You want to raise your children in
[1:17:22] some good church. So let's we're here.
[1:17:25] No. God brought you here. He made you
[1:17:28] for the same thing that he made Adam
[1:17:31] for, and that's the dominion.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Sure, you're going to have problems.
[1:17:36] Sure, you're going to have things that
[1:17:38] come against you and challenges. But you
[1:17:41] were made to meet the challenge.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; You were made to rule.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's right.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; So, man was made in the image of God.
[1:17:54] That's how we know he was made to rule.
[1:17:58] Come on now.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says we're returning
[1:18:02] back to that image
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; to our first created image.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Who is? I am. You are.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; The church of the living God is
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; good.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; And I'm It's not just the minister
[1:18:21] that's returning back to this image.
[1:18:25] It's everyone that's been filled with
[1:18:28] the Holy Ghost and is part of the bride
[1:18:30] of Christ.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Now, we we know or I I believe it. You
[1:18:36] can't be part of this bride and and not
[1:18:38] be part of the message.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Can't.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; That ain't happening. Not in this age.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; And any other age, those that were part
[1:18:46] of the bride were part of the message
[1:18:47] for their age.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you're part of the bride,
[1:18:53] this is where you're at right now. This
[1:18:55] is where we're at. Amen. Amen. Is we're
[1:18:58] returning back to the first image.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. Now,
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; now the prophet talks and he says, "Now,
[1:19:09] when a man gets saved,
[1:19:11] there's a light that comes in him.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; It's like the size of a shirt button."
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; So, that's that's a small just a little
[1:19:20] little button. Yeah.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; He says, you know, and he says that's
[1:19:26] God coming into the inner inner man.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; And then he talks about how we're made
[1:19:33] up in the system of a tabernacle.
[1:19:36] Remember there was three uh uh phases of
[1:19:39] the tabernacle. the outer court, the
[1:19:40] inner court, and the holiest of holy or
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; and so the outer court is this whole
[1:19:45] flesh.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; And there's five senses
[1:19:50] or we could say five entrances to this
[1:19:53] body.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; It's not just one entrance that affects
[1:19:58] us. It's we've got five senses
[1:20:01] [snorts]
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; and and they're gates
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; uh that affects the body. Then then so
[1:20:08] that's the outer court. in the holy
[1:20:09] place which is the spirit of man and
[1:20:12] there's five senses or five entrances
[1:20:15] into that
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; imagination right
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; uh memory conscience
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; and the others
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; affection
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; affection and what reasoning
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; reasoning so that that's the second part
[1:20:30] and then the then there was the holiest
[1:20:33] of holy
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; rightise
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; which is the inner part of man or the
[1:20:38] soul of man.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; And and that's where the shakina glory
[1:20:44] is.
[1:20:45] And there's only one entrance to that.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Amen." Uh uh and and
[1:20:53] he says, "Now the holiest of holy is
[1:20:55] where the shikina glory dwells and in
[1:20:58] there is where God can enter into man
[1:21:01] and take over in the control tower."
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; now you know these things. So uh
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; good
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; but just to remind us
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; so
[1:21:16] we we know now and and we're blessed to
[1:21:18] know
[1:21:20] that the Holy Ghost can move up on our
[1:21:22] flesh
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; and give us good thoughts, good
[1:21:25] feelings,
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; move upon our spirit.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; And we can even it can cause us to write
[1:21:31] good songs,
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; prophesy,
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; right? It could cause us to be anointed
[1:21:36] to preach, to sing.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Play music, have spiritual experience.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; But that's not where the control tower
[1:21:47] is.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; That's not where the shakana glory
[1:21:49] dwells.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; See, so so many people in church are
[1:21:53] anointed. Oh, they dance and they shout
[1:21:55] and they and they call that they they
[1:21:57] say, "Oh, he's a Christian." No, no, no.
[1:21:59] We found out through the message that's
[1:22:01] not Christianity.
[1:22:03] They can prophesy and be actually be
[1:22:05] right.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; They they can, you know, they they can
[1:22:09] have these things. But see, the holiest
[1:22:12] of holy is where the shana glory dwells.
[1:22:17] That's where God enters into man and
[1:22:20] takes over in the control tower. That's
[1:22:23] so that's you.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; This is your flesh. Then you got your
[1:22:29] spirit. Then you got you. which is the
[1:22:33] soul
[1:22:34] uh there and the only way in there the
[1:22:37] prophet said is through self-will.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; See whether you will to or not that's up
[1:22:45] to you. That's but that's the only
[1:22:47] avenue that's open to the man that God
[1:22:50] can come into his heart is by self-will.
[1:22:54] Puts him right back like Adam and Eve on
[1:22:57] free moral agency again. You can choose
[1:23:00] right or wrong. Either one you want to.
[1:23:03] Can you say amen?
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; So when man gets converted or born
[1:23:07] again. It's gone past this flesh. It's
[1:23:10] gone past that spirit and God has been
[1:23:14] able to get into that soul.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; And that little white light the size of
[1:23:20] a button comes into his heart.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; So that light is God. Now notice and I
[1:23:27] want you to really this brother Brand's
[1:23:29] saying it. He says now as he can let
[1:23:33] that spirit grow
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; and take out all the roots of bitterness
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; now
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; and press God's way through him again.
[1:23:43] He can become back in the same condition
[1:23:46] that he was when he was in the Garden of
[1:23:49] Eden.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Are we waiting on something? No.
[1:23:55] It's just us letting God take over.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; It's just us surrendering to God. Can
[1:24:02] you say amen?
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. See, people think we need
[1:24:05] a new prophet. No, we don't need another
[1:24:07] prophet. We just got to surrender.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; It's us to let [screaming] God have his
[1:24:13] way.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Let that spirit grow. Take out all the
[1:24:17] roots of bitterness and press God's way
[1:24:19] through him again. He can come back in
[1:24:21] the same condition that he was when he
[1:24:23] was in the Garden of Eden. Jesus said,
[1:24:25] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you
[1:24:27] say to this mountain, be moved and don't
[1:24:29] doubt in your heart, but believe what
[1:24:31] you have said will come to pass." That's
[1:24:33] not speaking of millennium. That's
[1:24:35] speaking right now
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; in this age to your mountain.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Speak to this mountain, be moved. Don't
[1:24:44] doubt in your heart, but believe that
[1:24:45] what you have said will come to pass.
[1:24:47] You can have. Everybody say you can
[1:24:49] have. I can have. You can have what you
[1:24:53] said. That puts him right back supreme
[1:24:56] again.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Puts him right back in the condition.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; God's not making you a king. He's
[1:25:04] already made you kings and priests.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Now we're made up of light
[1:25:14] meters. Inside of us is cosmic light.
[1:25:17] That cosmic light is a light that they
[1:25:19] can take an X-ray with. The X-ray
[1:25:22] doesn't come from the X-ray light. It
[1:25:24] comes from your own light. Then if that
[1:25:26] cosmic light say could be pushed to a
[1:25:29] place to where not cosmic light but
[1:25:32] eternal light, God could dwell supremely
[1:25:36] to do our thinking, do our walking, do
[1:25:40] our talking. Then it's no longer the
[1:25:42] man. It's God [screaming] in the man.
[1:25:46] Amen.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; So, eternal life is the light of God
[1:25:52] that dwells in you.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; So then the prophet says as as we yield
[1:26:01] to the spirit, everybody say yield.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; See, now it's up to us. Amen. We've it's
[1:26:08] it's whatever we want,
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we yield to the spirit,
[1:26:17] the more we become unmanlike,
[1:26:20] unsinner,
[1:26:22] and will become more godlike.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; That's the answers to quit your habits.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; I believe that's the answer to
[1:26:31] everything
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; is that we surrender.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I just wish my wife or my
[1:26:38] husband, my kids would straighten up."
[1:26:40] The more you surrender,
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; the more I will yield. We've got to
[1:26:45] yield to the spirit, the more unmanlike,
[1:26:50] the more unsininner like
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; we become and become more godlike.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Now, it's in every born again believer
[1:27:02] to do it.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wouldn't tell us, give us
[1:27:10] promises. God would not commission us.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; If we can't do it,
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; but we can do it.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; You got the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:25] Then your job is to surrender.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Yield.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; More and more and more.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Come on now. That's good.
[1:27:38] Now,
[1:27:40] notice our position. We'll look at his
[1:27:42] position, Christ. In Ephesians 1:20,
[1:27:46] Paul tells us that God raised Christ
[1:27:48] from the dead and set him at his own
[1:27:51] right hand in the heavenly places, far
[1:27:53] above all principalities. Notice, not
[1:27:56] just above, but far above.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing how he just puts
[1:28:01] words in there? Yeah.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; It's not like, you know, the devil's
[1:28:04] here and you're just like right there
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; touching him. It's far above.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:14] far above all principalities, powers,
[1:28:16] and might, and dominion, and every name
[1:28:18] that is named,
[1:28:20] cancer, tuberculosis, arthritis,
[1:28:22] Parkinson, anything. any name, every
[1:28:25] name that is named,
[1:28:27] not only in this world, but also in that
[1:28:29] which is to come, and hath put all
[1:28:32] things, everybody say, all things,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; under his feet,
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; and gave him to be the head over all
[1:28:40] things to the church, which is his body,
[1:28:44] the fullness of him that fleth all in
[1:28:46] all.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; So, just to
[1:28:50] all things are under his feet.
[1:28:53] the Lord.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; So, but but we're not over here looking
[1:28:58] at him
[1:29:00] like, "Oh, wow. What a dominion he has.
[1:29:04] What supreme. Oh, if I could just get
[1:29:08] there." No. Paul just told us we're with
[1:29:11] him.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; It's under his feet. Everybody say under
[1:29:17] his feet.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Under his feet.
[1:29:20] Well, then then he says we are his body.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; He's the head head.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Body,
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Christ
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Church,
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; And he didn't put the head everything
[1:29:46] under the head. Right?
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; He put everything under his body.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; So I guess we all know that the feet is
[1:29:58] part of the body.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Feet is part of the body. So I don't
[1:30:05] care if you are the bottom of the feet.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; It's still under you.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; You might be the skin under the big toe,
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; but it's still under you. Yes, sir.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; See, and and and and so then Paul tells
[1:30:23] us that God raised us up together and
[1:30:27] made us sit together in heavenly places
[1:30:29] in Christ Jesus. So, we're there,
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; in in other words, we've got a position
[1:30:36] of authority,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brown then says, "We have
[1:30:42] all powers." Everybody say, "All
[1:30:44] powers."
[1:30:45] We we have all powers. The church, every
[1:30:49] member that's part of the church, part
[1:30:51] of the body, we have all powers in
[1:30:54] heavens and earth.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Now, [screaming]
[1:30:58] we have it.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Not in the millennium. We won't need it
[1:31:04] then.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; We ain't going to be dealing with that
[1:31:07] devil in the millennium.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; We're not going to be dealing with sin
[1:31:11] in the millennium. We're not going to be
[1:31:13] dealing with spirit of fear and spirit
[1:31:15] of sickness and and death and all that
[1:31:18] in the millennium. He says we got it
[1:31:21] now.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Now.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Position of authority.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; So all everybody say all
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; things
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; are possible
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; are possible
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; now.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now notice notice how the
[1:31:44] gospel is needed to work
[1:31:47] is needed to work the power in us. The
[1:31:50] gospel is needed to work the power in
[1:31:53] us.
[1:31:55] Paul said the gospel is the power of God
[1:31:58] unto salvation to everyone that
[1:32:01] believeth. Salvation is not just when we
[1:32:04] come and ask for repentance. Salvation
[1:32:07] has to do with deliverance, healing,
[1:32:10] right? right? Uh sal uh getting saved.
[1:32:14] It it has to do with it all. Salvation
[1:32:17] is the whole complete works.
[1:32:20] It's the power of God unto salvation
[1:32:25] to everyone that believeth. What is the
[1:32:28] gospel?
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Romans 10:13,
[1:32:33] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[1:32:35] of the Lord shall be saved. How then
[1:32:37] shall they call on him in whom they have
[1:32:40] not believed? How shall they believe in
[1:32:42] him of whom they have not heard? How
[1:32:45] shall they hear without a preacher? See,
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; and how shall they preach except they be
[1:32:51] sent as it is written, "How beautiful
[1:32:53] are the feet of them that preach the
[1:32:54] gospel of peace and bring glad tidings
[1:32:57] of good things." This is why we don't
[1:33:00] put emphasis on singing, on music. They
[1:33:04] have their place. We don't put emphasis
[1:33:07] on shouting and dancing and and the
[1:33:10] tongues and dreams and visions. It all
[1:33:12] has its place. But it's the gospel. The
[1:33:16] gospel is the thing
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; that that has power.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Now uh uh uh the gospel looking at that
[1:33:27] teaching
[1:33:29] or declaring the word is part of the
[1:33:32] gospel.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:34] Ain't that right?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that Jesus taught
[1:33:39] daily in the temple.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Uh the Bible also tells us that Jesus
[1:33:45] went through the cities and villages
[1:33:48] teaching and journeying toward
[1:33:51] Jerusalem.
[1:33:53] We find that after the Holy Ghost fell
[1:33:55] on the 120 in the upper room that that
[1:33:59] when they come out and and and acting
[1:34:01] like drunk men that that there's
[1:34:03] bystanders all around and they were
[1:34:05] wondering what what this was and Peter
[1:34:08] stood up and declared the word of the
[1:34:10] Lord.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; after he declared the word of the Lord,
[1:34:14] they said, "What must we do to be
[1:34:16] saved?" And 3,000 souls were added to
[1:34:18] the church that day.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, they do.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Come on.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul, he said, "I have not
[1:34:25] shunn to declare unto you the all the
[1:34:30] counsel of God." Brother Brand said the
[1:34:33] word of God.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; According to First Corinthians, and I'm
[1:34:39] just bear with me getting somewhere. But
[1:34:42] according to 1 Corinthians 3:10, Paul as
[1:34:45] a wise master builder
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; laid the foundation. What? How? by
[1:34:51] teaching the word of God.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Word of God.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; So then men were built upon what Paul
[1:35:01] taught.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Let every man take heed
[1:35:05] on how he builds there upon."
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; I've laid that foundation. Now, every
[1:35:09] man's got to take heed on how he builds.
[1:35:11] It's got to line up with that
[1:35:12] foundation,
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; right? Paul even said, "If I or an angel
[1:35:17] from heaven or any other man, any man uh
[1:35:20] uh uh preach any other gospel than what
[1:35:23] I have preached, let him be accursed."
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; So that teaching
[1:35:28] was needed.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Second Timothy 1:13, Paul would write,
[1:35:34] "Hold fast the form of sound words which
[1:35:36] thou hast heard of me."
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:35:40] in faith and love in which is in Christ
[1:35:44] Jesus. Second Timothy 2:2, "And the
[1:35:47] things that thou hast heard of me among
[1:35:50] many wish witnesses, the same commit
[1:35:54] thou to faithful men who shall be able
[1:35:57] to teach others also."
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Even brother Bram says, "I've taught
[1:36:02] what Paul taught.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; I've said the same thing he said."
[1:36:05] Right? Amen. See? And so then
[1:36:09] if you notice what Paul taught
[1:36:14] was the revelation that was given to
[1:36:16] him.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Now he had the word. He had the word. He
[1:36:23] knew what the old prophets had said. He
[1:36:26] knew what Moses's law had said. And and
[1:36:30] he was very knowledgeable in these
[1:36:32] things. And at one time he taught what
[1:36:35] knowledge he had of the word. Can you
[1:36:38] say amen? As did the Pharisees and the
[1:36:41] other religious leaders of that day, the
[1:36:43] teachers of that day. But when he
[1:36:46] received the revelation of the word,
[1:36:49] then he taught that revelation.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying is not other not just
[1:36:56] anything is the gospel.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Come on.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; He taught what he had received from God
[1:37:04] as revelation.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; So the revelation was the foundation
[1:37:11] that Paul had laid.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; He didn't lay some other thought of man
[1:37:18] down for the church to be built upon.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Now, the revelation then that came to
[1:37:27] Paul became the gospel.
[1:37:29] Amen.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Revelation became the gospel.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Paul called it my gospel.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Romans 16:25, he says, "Now to him that
[1:37:42] is of power to establish you according
[1:37:45] to my gospel
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[1:37:50] according to the revelation of the
[1:37:52] mystery which was kept since uh kept
[1:37:55] secret since the world began." Right.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; In another place, he called this gospel
[1:37:59] sound doctrine.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; His gospel was what he called the gospel
[1:38:06] of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Just just letting that soak in now cuz
[1:38:11] we've been commissioned to preach the
[1:38:13] gospel.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Come on now, man.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Now, Paul said, "We preach Christ and
[1:38:22] him crucified." Amen.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; So, I want to say it this way. His
[1:38:27] gospel was the voice of the blood.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just telling the story
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; of of of Jesus dying on the cross, but
[1:38:38] he was preaching the finished works.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Of Calvary.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; So, his gospel was based upon the
[1:38:48] finished works of Calvary. Paul said in
[1:38:51] one place it was the gospel of the grace
[1:38:54] of God.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; And he said this glorious gospel was
[1:39:00] committed to my trust.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; So, but then we find that Paul's gospel
[1:39:06] wasn't just word word.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; But his gospel is the word plus power.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. The gospel
[1:39:18] is the word plus [screaming] power.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; If it's the true gospel.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you, what what good would it
[1:39:28] be to preach and you all to sit here and
[1:39:31] we do this day in day out faithfully
[1:39:33] Sundays and Wednesdays and and on
[1:39:36] special meetings and and then what good
[1:39:39] would it do if the gospel doesn't help?
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. If the gospel isn't intended to
[1:39:48] affect us, what good is it to play the
[1:39:50] tapes?
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; That is true.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:39:57] if you look, God is the word. How many
[1:40:00] believes that?
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; God is the word. Trying to get
[1:40:04] somewhere. And God is the spirit.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; He lives in his word.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Right. True. And he is revealed
[1:40:16] in his word.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; So when the word of God is spoken, it is
[1:40:22] spirit and life.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:28] different if than if I would just get a
[1:40:31] book of of of an author, whether it's a
[1:40:34] commentary, whether it's a western,
[1:40:36] whether it's a a drama, or whether
[1:40:39] whatever uh or it could be a biography
[1:40:42] of something and and th this Bible is
[1:40:45] different. I I I I could get that and
[1:40:48] and read it to you, but there's no life
[1:40:52] there.
[1:40:53] But when this is preached,
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; there's life
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; cuz God lives in his word.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; See, and so now notice the word of God
[1:41:08] can only come from the mouth of God. How
[1:41:10] many believes that?
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; It's just like your word.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; You speak a word, I can't call it my
[1:41:16] word.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; You You say something, I say, "Well,
[1:41:20] that's my word." Well, it didn't come
[1:41:22] from me. That's your word,
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; So, if it if it's God's word, then it
[1:41:29] has to come from God's mouth.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; God speaks it.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; So, then no man can say it's the word of
[1:41:38] God unless God spoke it himself. God is
[1:41:41] made known by his word being manifested.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So to speak a word uh
[1:41:51] uh without any manifestation of God
[1:41:53] behind it shows that it's not the word
[1:41:56] of God.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Because his word has the power and
[1:42:02] authority of God [screaming] behind it.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; See, so now uh uh the Holy Spirit is the
[1:42:13] power of God's word.
[1:42:16] Prophet says the Holy Spirit is the
[1:42:17] power of God's word. And if the Holy
[1:42:19] Spirit is in the word of God, it will
[1:42:23] make the word of God display itself.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; It'll make the word of God display
[1:42:30] itself.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; So, this is why we come to church to
[1:42:33] hear the word of God. This is why we
[1:42:36] play the tape. We're attentive into what
[1:42:38] is being said because we know the power
[1:42:42] and authority of God is in them words.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Then if you need help, if if whatever
[1:42:51] you you have need of, if you can take
[1:42:55] that word and believe it,
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; it becomes life.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:43:04] I could, like I said, I could read a
[1:43:06] book from some author and you could say,
[1:43:08] "Oh, yeah, yeah, that's nice. That's
[1:43:09] good. I agree with that." Ain't going to
[1:43:11] help you
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; because that ain't spirit and life,
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; But God's word is spirit and life.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; That's why we don't want to read creeds
[1:43:22] and we don't want to read the dogmas and
[1:43:24] we don't want to direct you in in in in
[1:43:27] a way of man.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Just preach the word. That's right.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet said, "Ministries that
[1:43:33] are consecrated to God become channels
[1:43:37] where God can speak through, preach the
[1:43:40] gospel, heal the sick, show signs and
[1:43:43] wonders."
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Another place, it's the Holy Ghost
[1:43:47] taking the word of God and making it
[1:43:50] manifest.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; See, so we're kings and priests. We're
[1:43:57] we're kings with an authority, but our
[1:44:00] authority does not come by our words.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; It comes by the word of God.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; So the word of God is the conductor of
[1:44:14] the spirit.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Wherever the
[1:44:17] word is preached, the spirit follows
[1:44:19] it."
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; I hope to build your faith in the word
[1:44:23] of God today.
[1:44:25] He said, "You see your pastor preach it.
[1:44:27] The first thing you know,
[1:44:30] Brother Brad makes a blowing sound
[1:44:32] across the building goes the Holy Ghost,
[1:44:35] right?"
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; He says, "Then if the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:44:39] confirm it, then you got your wires
[1:44:41] crossed.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; You got a ground somewhere." See, if you
[1:44:45] can get that word hooked up to the
[1:44:47] dynamo, that great thing that puts out
[1:44:50] the fullness of the current, he will
[1:44:52] just set that little wire of fire for
[1:44:55] you and it'll do things for you.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; See, we're not helpless today.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're facing. Don't
[1:45:09] look at it like you're just helpless and
[1:45:11] you're a victim and you just don't know
[1:45:13] and oh
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; you've got the power of the word.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Now we we we want to see the word
[1:45:27] demonstrated.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; How many wants to see that?
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; We want to see the word. See See, we
[1:45:33] don't have to put up with sickness.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; We don't have to put up with bondage,
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; right? We don't have to put up with
[1:45:39] these things.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Absolutely not.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; I just don't think we have to.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Now listen, church. If we were just
[1:45:51] Baptist or we were just Pentecost or if
[1:45:53] we were just taking a form, then then we
[1:45:56] have every right to sit in a church and
[1:45:58] not know God's power.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; But when the word is being preached, you
[1:46:04] understand
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; the gospel. preach the gospel. Now
[1:46:10] Jesus said, "These signs shall follow
[1:46:12] them that believe in my name. They shall
[1:46:14] cast out demons. They they shall speak
[1:46:16] with new tongues. They shall take up
[1:46:18] serpents, and if they drink any deadly
[1:46:20] thing, it shall not hurt them. They
[1:46:22] shall lay hands on the sick, and they
[1:46:23] shall recover." Now, casting out demons
[1:46:26] is a needful thing today,
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; right? That's right.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; I just You know what makes a man not
[1:46:34] want to surrender himself to the Lord?
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; It's demons.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; A demon does that.
[1:46:42] You talk to people, well, I want to get
[1:46:44] closer. I I want to, but something just
[1:46:45] won't let me. Well, I'll just tell you
[1:46:47] what it is. It's a demon.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; It's It's just as much as restricting
[1:46:52] people that can't hear good. It's a
[1:46:54] demon that is is causing that that
[1:46:57] hearing loss. Well, same same is it
[1:47:00] someone that can't can't that wants to
[1:47:02] move on and and wants to but they can't.
[1:47:05] I've had many people tell me I I want to
[1:47:07] come to church but I can't. Something
[1:47:10] just won't let me. Well, it's a demon.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Now, notice what brother Bram said in
[1:47:15] his prayer. There are perhaps sinners
[1:47:18] sitting here that is so bound with sin
[1:47:21] that it'd be hard for them, impossible
[1:47:24] almost for them to reach out to a place
[1:47:26] to accept Christ as long as Satan has
[1:47:29] them so bound in his power.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; But knowing that it is written in my
[1:47:35] name, they shall cast out devils.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He says, "Give us
[1:47:42] power today, Lord, through the preaching
[1:47:45] of the word to cast every devil of
[1:47:48] doubt, super uh superstition, and fear
[1:47:52] from the people's hearts and minds, and
[1:47:54] those that are bound by frustrations and
[1:47:56] doubt might be brought into the arms of
[1:47:59] Christ."
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my, you love the Lord.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; See, so, so we find the preaching of the
[1:48:08] gospel castes out devils. Amen.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Come on now
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; to the believer, right?
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; I believe that's that's what's going to
[1:48:17] set some of you got your children that
[1:48:19] are lost. It's what's going to set your
[1:48:21] children free.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; That gospel.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; That's what we believe.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe in the gospel, go
[1:48:28] to psychology.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe in the gospel, go
[1:48:32] to some other thing. But we believe in
[1:48:34] the gospel.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That gospel
[1:48:37] has the power to set free.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; So it has to be that way. It has to be.
[1:48:44] So now 1 Corinthians 15 and1 Paul says,
[1:48:48] "Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you
[1:48:51] the gospel which I preached unto you,
[1:48:53] which also you have received and wherein
[1:48:56] you stand, by which also you are saved."
[1:49:01] Yes.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; If you keep in memory what I preached
[1:49:05] unto you, unless you have believed in
[1:49:08] vain.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; So I can say by which you are also
[1:49:12] healed.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; You are also delivered.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; By which you are also set free.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; So this is why it's important to speak
[1:49:24] the word of God.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and here Proverbs 18:21,
[1:49:32] death, everybody say death
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; and life
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; are in the power of the tongue.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Death and life are in the power of the
[1:49:41] tongue. Now we know that God's words is
[1:49:44] not death. For the Bible says, man shall
[1:49:46] live by every word that proceed out of
[1:49:48] the mouth of God.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; So the word of God is life. Jesus said,
[1:49:53] "My words that I speak to you are spirit
[1:49:55] and they are life."
[1:49:57] Can you say amen?
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; In in 1 Corinthians 2 and4, Paul said,
[1:50:02] "My speech and my preaching was not with
[1:50:05] enticing words of man's wisdom, but in
[1:50:08] demonstration of the spirit and the
[1:50:11] power that your faith should not stand
[1:50:13] in the wisdom of men, but in the power
[1:50:15] of God."
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "The preaching of the
[1:50:19] gospel brings the Holy Spirit over the
[1:50:22] church, the righteousness of Jesus
[1:50:25] Christ." Another place he said through
[1:50:27] the preaching of the gospel comes down
[1:50:30] the blood veil.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's right.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Another place he says the Holy Spirit
[1:50:38] transmits God's [screaming] power and
[1:50:41] glory through the preaching of the
[1:50:44] gospel.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; So again, don't just don't don't come
[1:50:52] here. Don't sit here like you're
[1:50:54] hopeless.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Take the gospel and believe it.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; So we find that in Genesis 1:3, it shows
[1:51:09] us what the gospel is to be. And God
[1:51:12] said, everybody saying, God said,
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; God declared,
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; God spoke his word. Right? Yeah.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Same word that you have. The same word
[1:51:20] that I'm preaching this morning.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; God said,
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; "That's right.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Let there be light."
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; And nothing happened.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; And God just looks around says, "Man, I
[1:51:34] tried. I just don't know."
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; No. That's not what the gospel is.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; God said, "Let there be light." And
[1:51:42] there was light.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Amen.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; See, so the word of God was spoken and
[1:51:51] it was manifested. And every time God
[1:51:55] speaks his word, it's manifested. Let
[1:51:59] there be trees, it was manifested. Let
[1:52:02] there be flowers, it was manifested. Let
[1:52:04] us make man in our own image, it was
[1:52:07] manifested.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; But God gave his word to us.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:17] In the Old Testament, the Bible says the
[1:52:19] word of the Lord came to the prophets.
[1:52:22] It was God speaking through them. Uh
[1:52:24] Hebrews 1:1, God who had sundried times
[1:52:26] and in diverse manner spake in times
[1:52:28] past unto the fathers by the prophets.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; They were called gods because the word
[1:52:36] of God came to them.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; They were called gods because they spoke
[1:52:42] the word of God. It was God using their
[1:52:46] lips to speak his word.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; And whatever they declared was
[1:52:52] manifested,
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; They declared the coming Messiah, did
[1:52:56] they not?
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; And it was manifested.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:03] I I'm going to hurry up here. But today,
[1:53:11] the word is being taught, explained,
[1:53:15] broke down in so many ways to where
[1:53:18] people are getting an intellectual
[1:53:20] knowledge of the word.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; We have many schools of theology
[1:53:27] that have explained the word. They've
[1:53:29] sent their ministers out
[1:53:33] and as theologians and philosophers and
[1:53:38] commentators and all of these things
[1:53:42] and you know men have come out of the
[1:53:45] woodwork holding conferences and Bible
[1:53:47] studies and seminars and powerpoints to
[1:53:52] help the people get a better grasp of
[1:53:54] what they are teaching. and and there's
[1:53:56] nothing wrong. But see, we've had this
[1:53:59] stuff and there's no power in it,
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; There there's there there's no
[1:54:04] authority, no anointing in what they're
[1:54:06] saying,
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; No supernatural manifestation
[1:54:11] simply because the word is lost.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Teaching for doctrine, the traditions of
[1:54:21] man.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now the Bible speaks of fallen
[1:54:24] angels who fell from their estate. They
[1:54:28] kept not their first estate, their their
[1:54:30] position.
[1:54:32] And and we know that these angels fell
[1:54:34] because they listened to Lucifer's lie.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said Lucifer at the
[1:54:40] beginning, his purpose in heart was to
[1:54:42] achieve a brighter and greater thing in
[1:54:44] heaven than Christ had. Is that right?
[1:54:48] by seemingly a more cultured, more
[1:54:50] beautiful, more splendor than the
[1:54:52] kingdom of Christ. Then the prophet said
[1:54:55] he's doing it again today.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Building up a hybrid church, a hybrid by
[1:55:02] hybrid members, hybrid by knowledge
[1:55:05] instead of the word by intellectual men
[1:55:08] instead of bornagain men building an
[1:55:10] intellectual kingdom that'll outshine
[1:55:12] Christ's little bitty flock.
[1:55:15] Why is it that did that? What is it that
[1:55:18] did that? Fallen angels. Everybody say
[1:55:20] fallen angels.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible said it was fallen angels who
[1:55:24] who listened to Lucifer instead of
[1:55:26] Christ who they once belonged to.
[1:55:29] Another place Lucifer has gotten to the
[1:55:31] church and taken away the word and
[1:55:34] injected denomination.
[1:55:37] And he is building a church. the
[1:55:39] ecumenical move that's going on now to
[1:55:41] unite all the Protestants together all
[1:55:44] together come into Catholic and this
[1:55:46] pope that they got in now to do the same
[1:55:48] thing exactly what the scripture said it
[1:55:50] would do and that's and what's he doing
[1:55:52] it by he's doing it by man of those
[1:55:56] great ecumenical moves who does not know
[1:55:58] God and the many of them in the
[1:56:00] Pentecostals because they're doing the
[1:56:02] same see what is it he's doing it with
[1:56:05] fallen angels fallen Lutheran fallen
[1:56:07] west Methodist
[1:56:08] following fallen Pentecostals. See, and
[1:56:12] lost their original state estate from
[1:56:14] the word of God and going right back in
[1:56:16] to make a great big ecumenical move.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Fallen messengers. Messengers who once
[1:56:22] stayed with the word but sold out their
[1:56:24] birthrights and joined in with the
[1:56:26] world. Same thing. It's at the last day.
[1:56:29] Lucifer is achieving today by man with
[1:56:33] those spirits in them that he did with
[1:56:36] angels at the beginning. Fallen angels
[1:56:38] who kept not their first estate to obey
[1:56:42] God. Amen.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Another place you see what they become
[1:56:46] fallen angels and organizations from men
[1:56:49] of God who has went forth uh to
[1:56:52] establish truths in the earth. Before
[1:56:54] that truth could go on and proclamate
[1:56:57] and get on to the real revelation of
[1:56:59] Christ, fallen angels come in, took it
[1:57:02] over and made denominations out of it.
[1:57:05] Notice that's the reason the revelation
[1:57:08] of the seventh seal mystery had to be
[1:57:12] unfolded.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Now you see it what they left off. If
[1:57:16] Luther would have went on, it had been
[1:57:18] right here. If Wesley would have went
[1:57:20] on, if Pentecost would have went on,
[1:57:23] what would they have done? See, now
[1:57:25] there's only one thing that can happen.
[1:57:27] There has to be a message at the end
[1:57:30] time when there's nothing else can
[1:57:33] follow it.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Why? To bring back the word of God
[1:57:39] again.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; So, this is why God sent to us the
[1:57:48] prophet of Malachi 4 to restore the
[1:57:51] original word to us and to restore us
[1:57:54] back.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet said with the
[1:57:56] restoration of the word will come the
[1:57:59] restoration of the power.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; So we need the word
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; right? Preach the word.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Teach the word.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; They say oh we don't want to get into
[1:58:11] the you don't get deep in the message
[1:58:13] now. Amen. All these things you may go
[1:58:15] wacko. No. Preach the word.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Teach the word. If the prophet said it,
[1:58:21] it's needed for this.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:24] Don't don't don't shun from serpent
[1:58:26] seed.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Don't don't shun from God of this evil
[1:58:30] age. Don't shun away from the the
[1:58:32] seventh seal and and and Christ is the
[1:58:34] mystery and the future home of the
[1:58:36] earthly bride and the heavenly bride.
[1:58:38] Don't shun from them things.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I can't understand it."
[1:58:42] Ask God to give it to you. Give you that
[1:58:45] revelation
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; because with the restoration of the word
[1:58:49] comes restoration of power. Yeah.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham said, "We've lived
[1:58:56] down through the time of the preaching
[1:58:58] and teaching and so forth, and we've got
[1:59:00] into a place now to where the church is
[1:59:03] so broke up till God is just bringing in
[1:59:07] again the supernatural to serve a
[1:59:10] people."
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Now listen, he's coming to restore.
[1:59:15] God's going to restore that word. God's
[1:59:17] going to restore the power and all these
[1:59:19] things. Now, Brother Brown said the
[1:59:20] restoration, this restoration is
[1:59:23] something that neither Luther Wesley or
[1:59:26] Pentecost had.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; They only had a reformation.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; I looked up this word to reform. It
[1:59:35] means to change something for the
[1:59:37] better, improve it, or correct its
[1:59:39] faults.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Now, they done many good things back in
[1:59:43] those days. Luther, you know, uh, uh,
[1:59:46] produced the Bible for everyone to read
[1:59:49] and and in that in that time,
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; but the prophet said, but they failed to
[1:59:54] restore back the full gospel teaching
[1:59:57] with signs following.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; He says they did not restore the Holy
[2:00:05] Ghost revival. They did turn from idols
[2:00:08] and they turned from idols. That is
[2:00:11] true. They took down the idols out of
[2:00:14] the church. Mary and Joseph and Peter
[2:00:16] and Paul and all them. They turned from
[2:00:18] the idols, but they did not turn to the
[2:00:22] risen Christ.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Luther turned them from the idols, but
[2:00:28] into more like a politic or denomination
[2:00:30] or organization to make themselves just
[2:00:33] another organization, an image like the
[2:00:35] first one, and try to outgrow it by the
[2:00:38] denomination.
[2:00:40] Ain't that right? Yeah.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "See, all Lutheran wants all
[2:00:43] the Baptist and Methodists to be
[2:00:45] Lutheran. The Pentecost wants all
[2:00:46] Baptist Lutheran and everything else to
[2:00:48] be Pentecostal. You just keep adding to
[2:00:50] your denomination." But that's not God's
[2:00:52] program in the first place. God's
[2:00:55] program is for restoration. So, for uh
[2:00:58] God's program for restoration was to
[2:01:00] bring back that which was from the
[2:01:03] beginning.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And we now know by the
[2:01:08] message of the hour, it's not just
[2:01:11] bringing us back to a Pentecost on the
[2:01:13] days of Acts. It's bringing us back to
[2:01:16] what man was in the garden
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; before the fall
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; I hope this is all right.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Lookie, he says, "Resurrect that." If
[2:01:29] this book falls to the floor,
[2:01:33] now to take another book and take it and
[2:01:36] take it in its place isn't restoration.
[2:01:38] Resurrection.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; So, you have to bring the same one up.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; So, if the church died through the dark
[2:01:44] age and become completely pagan back
[2:01:47] there, then the restoration now that's a
[2:01:49] reformation to reform. But to be
[2:01:52] reformed and born again is two different
[2:01:54] things,
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, the message did not come to
[2:02:00] reform us.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; So, he said, see, uh uh they brought
[2:02:07] back reformation, getting away from a
[2:02:10] lot of their idols and so forth, but
[2:02:12] they never brought the Holy Ghost back
[2:02:14] in the church.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:02:19] They never brought the Holy Ghost back
[2:02:22] because the one that really brings the
[2:02:25] true gospel light, he said, "Now put on
[2:02:27] your cap now. The one that brings the
[2:02:29] true gospel light is the angel of the
[2:02:32] church here."
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; In this lessa, can you say amen?
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so that's what the message
[2:02:40] is. Amen. Is bringing a restoration of
[2:02:44] the gospel with word and power. Yes.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Word and power. Can you say
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; amen?
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[2:02:57] If the musicians will come.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Paul foretold of what God would do in
[2:03:05] this time of restoration.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Acts 3 and 20. And he shall, everybody
[2:03:15] say he shall
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; send Jesus Christ,
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; which was behested
[2:03:23] unto you, whom the heaven must receive
[2:03:28] until
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; until
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; the times of restitution of all things.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Or until the times of restoration of all
[2:03:39] things.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. When is he going to send Jesus
[2:03:44] Christ?
[2:03:45] At the time of the restoration of all
[2:03:49] things.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Restitution is the act
[2:03:54] of restoring a restoration of something
[2:03:57] to its rightful owner. And he sends
[2:04:01] Jesus Christ at the times of
[2:04:03] restoration.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; So then we look at them scriptures
[2:04:07] again. For the Lord himself shall
[2:04:08] descend with a shout, a voice, and a
[2:04:10] trump.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And the dead in Christ shall
[2:04:14] rise.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; I saw another mighty angel come down
[2:04:21] with the open book in his hand. Oh my.
[2:04:24] What is it? It's a time of restoration.
[2:04:27] Yes, sir.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Luke 21:27. And they shall see the Son
[2:04:31] of Man coming in with a cloud with
[2:04:34] power, with power and great glory.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Brother Aram said, "In
[2:04:41] the last days it shall come to pass,
[2:04:43] behold, I send to you Elijah the
[2:04:45] prophet, and he shall turn the hearts of
[2:04:47] the children back to the faith of the
[2:04:49] fathers." And in there
[2:04:53] there would be a time come forth when he
[2:04:56] could express himself in fullness of his
[2:04:59] godhead deity through his church. Have
[2:05:03] the preeminence in this church. Oh my.
[2:05:07] What? The anointed man. Now the anointed
[2:05:10] people to bring back the anointed bride
[2:05:14] and the bridegroom.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Anointed by wife, accepting what Eve
[2:05:20] turned down in Adam. Coming back with
[2:05:22] the anointing of the word because he
[2:05:24] said, "My word is spirit." Anointed with
[2:05:27] the word. What Eve turned down, he comes
[2:05:30] back and we accept. [music]
[2:05:33] How many's accepted?
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. what he turned down, he
[2:05:38] comes back and we accept.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Now think of that. She turned down the
[2:05:43] word and the word has come back to us
[2:05:46] [music]
[2:05:47] and we accept it.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; And because she turned down the word,
[2:05:52] [music] she lost her position with the
[2:05:55] word. No more in dominion, no more in
[2:05:58] authority, [music] running from the
[2:06:00] winds, hiding from the rain,
[2:06:03] all of these things. She become the
[2:06:05] victim. Man become a victim of Satan.
[2:06:08] But now the word has been restored
[2:06:09] [music]
[2:06:10] and we accept it. Now if she turned down
[2:06:14] that word and looked the results that
[2:06:16] happened, what does it do to us who
[2:06:19] accept that same word?
[2:06:22] It puts us [music] back in a position of
[2:06:25] authority.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[2:06:33] Prophet said, "Now God has promised her
[2:06:35] as he did Eve." [music]
[2:06:37] He told Eve there had come a time, there
[2:06:39] had come a time that the word would come
[2:06:41] back to her again. Now you remember that
[2:06:44] what she lost from, what she fell from,
[2:06:49] it would be restored because there's
[2:06:51] only one thing that can restore [music]
[2:06:52] and that's the word.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Amen.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; So he says God is trying to get somebody
[2:07:00] through the sanctifying power of Christ
[2:07:03] to yield to that word that he and the
[2:07:06] word can become one again. [music] Then
[2:07:09] he can use his word through that person.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; I hope it's really sunk home to you
[2:07:16] today.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; God wanting to take his word [music]
[2:07:20] and speak through you.
[2:07:25] So what do we do as message believers?
[2:07:28] Do we look at our problems and just oh
[2:07:31] boohoo and cry and [music] woe is me or
[2:07:35] do we recognize our position?
[2:07:37] Do we recognize what this message is to
[2:07:40] [music] us? I'm not believing this
[2:07:42] message in vain. God by this message has
[2:07:46] [music] returned the word to me. Can you
[2:07:48] say amen?
[2:07:50] Amen. He's returned it. I believe it.
[2:07:56] These signs shall follow them that
[2:07:58] believe.
[2:07:59] [music] These signs shall follow them.
[2:08:03] We've got the power in the name
[2:08:05] [singing] of the [music] Lord.
[2:08:14] Gener. [singing]
[2:08:16] Hallelujah. [music]
[2:08:18] We will not be defeated.
[2:08:25] We've got the power
[2:08:32] in the name of the Lord. Oh, sing it
[2:08:36] again.
[2:08:38] Yes, [music and singing] we've got the
[2:08:41] power
[2:08:44] [music]
[2:08:45] in the name of Jesus.
[2:08:51] [music]
[2:08:52] We've got [singing]
[2:08:53] the power.
[2:08:57] taking a walk. You know, [music] Brother
[2:08:58] Kenny had testified there at the meeting
[2:09:03] [music] uh service last week.
[2:09:07] There he was. Uh I can't remember what
[2:09:10] issue he was having [music] in his body,
[2:09:13] but he said he, you know, he
[2:09:17] he had remembered either brother
[2:09:19] Brandham or what the scripture [music]
[2:09:20] had said about the word of God being
[2:09:23] powerful.
[2:09:25] And he thought, you know what? I'm going
[2:09:27] to start coming to church expecting.
[2:09:30] I can't remember [music] what problem he
[2:09:32] had now, but he said, "I'm I'm going to
[2:09:34] come to church expecting if if the
[2:09:36] [music] word is being preached, then I'm
[2:09:38] going to claim it." He said, "Every day,
[2:09:41] he starts just claiming [music] it. God,
[2:09:43] you said it. I went and heard your word.
[2:09:46] I'm healed."
[2:09:48] He [music] said, "What was it 10 months
[2:09:49] later?"
[2:09:52] He said, "All of a sudden, the pain was
[2:09:54] gone."
[2:09:55] said he hadn't had a problem with it
[2:09:57] since. [music]
[2:09:58] Why? He started realizing
[2:10:01] the word that's coming forth has power.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; It has power. There's nothing wrong with
[2:10:07] the message, right?
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; And if we can believe it and just
[2:10:13] [music] hold on to it, it it doesn't
[2:10:15] matter how long. It doesn't matter when
[2:10:18] and and where and and all of these
[2:10:20] things. I I thought of of brother
[2:10:23] Brandham and and u he was saying and I
[2:10:28] uh if I could find it just right fast
[2:10:31] that [music] he was in a prayer line
[2:10:35] and uh [music]
[2:10:37] and I may not be able to find it and
[2:10:43] uh where it was but he was [music]
[2:10:45] talking to an a a a lady that was having
[2:10:49] problems
[2:10:51] and u
[2:10:55] yeah I can't I must have not done it but
[2:10:58] uh I'll [music] read it next time but
[2:11:00] talking to a lady and he says you know
[2:11:02] he says you've got to you've got to rise
[2:11:04] out of your condition [music]
[2:11:06] you you you got to start you know don't
[2:11:09] don't look at your problem don't look at
[2:11:11] the whatever he said now just just rise
[2:11:13] up out of it somehow you got to rise up
[2:11:16] out of it and then just start claiming
[2:11:18] [music] start thanking ing God. And he
[2:11:20] told her, he said, "Raise your hands and
[2:11:22] just start thanking God for your
[2:11:23] healing. Just start thanking God."
[2:11:25] [music] He said, "That's the way to do
[2:11:26] it. Just thank God." He said, "Now just
[2:11:28] go your way and and and don't think
[2:11:30] about your problem. Don't think about
[2:11:32] the sickness anymore [music]
[2:11:33] and just start thanking God. Just say,
[2:11:35] God, I thank you. I thank you for your
[2:11:37] healing. I thank you for saving me. I
[2:11:39] thank you. I thank you. I thank you. I
[2:11:40] thank you. I thank you." Why? Because
[2:11:42] there's power in the word that was
[2:11:44] preached.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; There's power there. Can [music] you say
[2:11:47] amen? Amen. If it was just a a
[2:11:50] congressman giving a speech or a
[2:11:52] president giving a speech, amen, that
[2:11:54] that's different. But when the word of
[2:11:55] God is coming forth, if we can just
[2:11:57] believe it and then start acting upon
[2:11:59] that word, I thank you, Father. Thank
[2:12:01] you for saving my children. [music] I I
[2:12:03] thank you. Let it be verbally done.
[2:12:05] Verbally say it. Amen. Every day. God, I
[2:12:08] thank you for saving my children. I I
[2:12:11] thank you for turning the situation
[2:12:12] around. I thank you, Lord, for touching
[2:12:15] my body. I thank you, Father, for
[2:12:18] supplying every need. [music] What are
[2:12:19] we doing? We're taking God at his word.
[2:12:22] That's right.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; This word is powerful.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Can we stand [music] to our feet today?
[2:12:28] We've got the power
[2:12:33] [music]
[2:12:34] in [singing] the name of the Lord.
[2:12:40] All for many years [music]
[2:12:45] now.
[2:12:48] Satan's [music] tried to stop us.
[2:12:52] [singing]
[2:12:54] [music]
[2:12:54] But the bride of Jesus
[2:13:01] is still alive.
[2:13:07] And like a mighty
[2:13:10] [singing] army,
[2:13:12] [music]
[2:13:14] we keep marching
[2:13:17] upward,
[2:13:20] [music]
[2:13:21] winning every [singing]
[2:13:23] battle
[2:13:27] for the Lord's [singing]
[2:13:29] on our side.
[2:13:33] Yes. Yes. Yes. We've got the power
[2:13:37] [singing]
[2:13:39] [music]
[2:13:41] in the name of Jesus. [music]
[2:13:45] [singing]
[2:13:47] We've got the power
[2:13:52] [music and singing]
[2:13:54] in the name of Can you lift your hands
[2:13:57] unto the Lord and just worship [music]
[2:13:59] him? Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:04] Hallelujah.
[2:14:06] It's time just to worship him. Take some
[2:14:08] time. We're in no [music] hurry. No sir.
[2:14:12] We're just going to worship God just
[2:14:14] moment now. [music and singing]
[2:14:17] Hallelujah.
[2:14:19] Amen. In the name [singing] of the Lord.
[2:14:23] Sing it one more time.
[2:14:26] Oh, we've [music] got the power
[2:14:32] [singing]
[2:14:34] in the name.
[2:14:36] Oh, to think of the power that we
[2:14:39] possess in [music] this age.
[2:14:43] All heaven
[2:14:46] and in earth power,
[2:14:49] authority.
[2:14:52] Glory [music] be to God.
[2:14:54] Oh, Satan [singing]
[2:14:56] raes,
[2:14:58] [music]
[2:15:01] we shall not be [singing] defeated.

[2:15:48] Well, there are people almost [music]
[2:15:50] everywhere whose hearts [singing] are
[2:15:53] all a flame with the fire that fell at
[2:15:57] Pentecost which [music] cleansed and
[2:15:59] made them clean. It is burning now
[2:16:03] within [music] my heart. Oh, glory
[2:16:05] [singing] to his name. I'm so glad that

[2:16:40] Though these [music and singing] people
[2:16:41] may not learn to be nor worse holy fame,
[2:16:45] [music and singing]
[2:16:46] they have all received their Pentecost,
[2:16:50] baptized in Jesus' name and are
