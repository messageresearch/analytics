get thee behind cuz happiness today is mine oh joy is [Music] mine I told Satan to get thee behind Joy today is mine all Deliverance is mine Deliverance is mine Deliverance today and I told Satan just get thee behind Deliverance today is mine amen aren't you glad you can experience thaten amen and it's a reality to us amen just uh tell the devil where to go amen amen go back where he come from amen praise the lord well I trust you had a good afternoon uh brother Christian it's good to have you this evening amen and just everyone and um uh the musicians can be dismissed appreciate brother Branson uh leading the songs there and the musicians and praise the Lord if you have your Bibles we're going to just turn to the book of Hebrews the sixth chapter praise the Lord and um so glad to be a Christian amen praise the Lord before we go on to the reading of the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father Lord we're so glad that we can claim victory we can claim your promises Lord and that we don't have to give in to the devil and no longer his slave that we can tell him where to go command him to leave oh thank you Lord for giving us that Authority as your sons and daughters father we're just asking now that you would just minister to every heart Lord just uh you see what we have to say and I pray that you would anoint me Lord and help me to get myself out of the way and any spirit that would try to hinder the service tonight I pray that you would just drive that uh every evil spirit away father and may you just feel at home and have Liberty to just work a supernatural work within every one of us we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord um Hebrews the 6th chapter and we're going to start at the 13th verse it says for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of Promise the immutability of his counil confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it is impossible or was impossible for God to lie we might everybody say ween might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made and high priest Forever After the order of MDC amen you can have your seats this evening and um the scripture reading that we uh read there uh there's a lot that can be said uh about it and uh but um I guess what stood out to me for uh tonight is is where Paul mentions the people who have fled for Refuge they have fled for Refuge now thinking of that uh the word fled um it means to run away from danger uh to run away from Evil to hurry toward a place of security so uh there that that's it's an action uh that we have left one place going to another uh getting away from um and and so uh you know there's different places that the Bible talks about fleeing um uh it tells us to flee from idolatry flee fornication flee youthful lusts uh so so uh we are to a people uh that have fled right in second Timothy 3:5 Paul forto of of a people having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away flee uh um and and so the the Christian Life uh there there there has to be some fling uh you you got to flee and and so uh the Bible uh tells us in another place shun the very appearance of evil and so you you have to flee from it if you're wanting to be safe ain't that right flee from it uh so so brother brandham when he preached on the greatest battle ever fought he was preaching to the Bride of Jesus Christ uh the destinated those who have had their names written on the Lamb's Book of Life and and and so he's not talking to Sinners he's not talking to make Believers he's he's actually talking to to True Believers and and he's talking about that there's that battle and in that sermon uh brother Brandon mentions a woman um Nelly Sanders um who had got saved uh he he had just been saved I I think he said for a year or so and uh she was just a young young woman and uh but uh uh before she got saved she was a dancer you know they go down to different places and dance with this uh fell by the name of Lee and uh they were the best dancers in the country brother brandham said and I guess pretty good uh but one night she came to the Altar and and and brother Brown said she just stayed there and she cried and she prayed and she told God that she would never listen to the things of the world again and all at once a lovely sweet peace come over her soul and she raised up from there shouting and praising God and glorifying God and so it was a tremendous thing for her to experience and so she was going good doing good uh uh and so 8 months later she had bought some material to make her a dress and so she was walk walking down the street and and I guess with with whatever she had bought and and um uh she happened to pass by a a a a night club or a place dancing where they were out there were all dancing and and uh uh it it it that music caught her and so she stopped and she began to listen to that music and brother Braham said now that's where she made her mistake she stopped for a moment see she just listened just listen see and she said well I'm going to think you know said Lord you know I love you though and you know I love you Lord and but I can sure remember the time when Lee and I used to win all the cups and so forth and trophies see and and my I remember that old music used to attract me but it don't now you know and and he says uh-oh he said see you you just think it don't but it's already got your right there see that's just as good as he wants right there and she said well maybe if I walk up on the steps there and and maybe I'll be able to testify to some of them and he said right there you're right on the devil's grounds and he said stay out of it shun the very appearance of evil flee in other words right and uh but she walked up and the tops of the stairs and stood there a few minutes first thing you know she was in some boy's arms out on the floor and and then she comes to herself so she she she finds where goes to where brother Brandon was living he was standing there with his mom before he got married and so he was standing there with his mom and she was just a balling and and he says what what happened Ellie and and so she began to tell him the story and she says oh I've passed the line of Mercy I there's no hope for me and I'm just lost forever and and and brother Bram says oh I don't think that he said uh he said the Bible says you know uh they shall cast lay hands on the sick they shall recover they shall cast out devils in my name and so um he says well then brother Brandon began to talk to the devil and he said now I devil I don't know who you are but I'm telling you now this is my sister and and and and you ain't got no business withholding her she didn't mean to do that she just stopped for a minute and that's where she made her mistake though and I said but you're going to have to come out of her you hear me and and he said so help me God at the Judgment bar he says you know that screen door be to opening and shutting by itself plump plump there at the door and uh plump K plump K plump you know and she said bill look at their said you know and he he he said I I said yeah I said what is that I don't know he said well never neither do I and the door just Pump It pump you know and shutting like that and I thought what's the matter here what's the matter and he said I looked again and I said Satan leave her in Jesus name come out of her and he said it looked like a great big bat about you know long just long rose up behind her with long hair hanging down out of its wings and off of its feet and was going woo you know and started right towards me just as hard as it could and he said oh Lord God the blood of Jesus Christ protect me from that amen and and and so it it was a refuge for him but but you know she should have fled ain't that right and and so you know people don't think that the devil's real um we we actually have some uh kin folk that that actually believe that is is that he's not real and uh but but he is real and and we are to flee from him in other words every day is going to be a battle every day you you you've you you you've got to you know uh um uh uh you you you can't entertain things see you you you don't want to hang around evil things and and I'm talking to all of us because there there's not one that that can um uh well be a repellent uh uh from things in other words I I don't care who you are you hang around the bar long enough then you you're going to become a drunk it it's just that way and so no matter how secure you feel that you are and and we believe in eternal security but we also believe in shunning the appearances of evil too and and so uh you don't want to hang around those things the old saying you know uh brother Bram said his mom used to tell him quite often said you know you lay down with the dog that's got fleas you'll get up with the fleas too you know so so it it it's just that way and brother Ram said you take a woman that's no good and let a girl uh you said put put her with a decent boy and the first thing you know he he's as he's as honory as a pup you know he said turn it right vice versa you know he said because you're known by your company separate yourself come out from among them and be ye separated so uh I I think that is very important for us to to understand that that Christians are Christians because they have fled amen you you talking about strong Christians the reason why they're strong Christian is because they have fled can you say Amen they they have fled for Refuge see a a a person that don't recognize uh when danger is lurking nearby then he or she uh uh will not feel the need to flee or to run away they they just feel like they're they're everything's going to be okay well the the the deal is is Jesus told us about this age he foretold that that it that that our enemy is going to be so deceptive and and and things till it would deceive the very elect if it were possible ain't that right amen and and and the reason of this deception is because the enemy has disguised himself in such a way uh uh to where that we actually see people running to harm running two things that will destroy them trying to find Refuge is because they don't know which way to go they don't know the enemy from from the friend if you understand so they run to the bottle and drugs trying to find satisfaction they run to entertainment trying to find peace they they they turn to formal religious Traditions uh to find hope they turn to false doctrines and uh run to the unbeliever and the make believer trying to find Refuge they run to the seminaries and run to uh Impostors impersonated and they even run to the gifts uh uh you know even when they are being used contrary to what uh the Bible and the message teaches and and things like that and and it's because they don't discern the the enemy they they're they're in this state of deception and they're trying to run they're trying to uh everybody knows that and and even the world knows the world's falling apart they're trying to fix of course but uh brother Brown says that's why we got our com comedy and joking and Frolic and all that because they know uh that that something's coming and maybe they can't figure it out we know what it is but but they're they're trying to ignore it it's like the boy scared to death running in the graveyard walking through and he's whistling and he's trying to convince himself it's okay I'm not scared but the fact he's whistling he is scared you know and so people are trying to find answers but they're running to the wrong things uh uh to to and they're running actually to things that are destroying them you can't hide in in in movies and entertainment and things like that expecting to uh uh that you're going to find safety it ain't going to work that way and so if you hang around unbelievers you're going to become an unbeliever if you hang around critics you're going to become a a a Critic if you hang around lukewarm Believers you're going to come become uh such as that if you hang around unbelief you're going to be filled with unbelief uh so so you have to understand uh what to run from and what to run to ain't that right Amen brother Brown said if you hang around a thief you're going to be a thief it's just that way you'll be a thief yourself and and so this is why that a a young man should not hang around uh young girls or young men uh uh that don't uh that don't believe the message of the hour you you should not make yourself comfortable around them uh uh I understand you have to work with them you have to you have to uh go to school and and and things like that but you should not make them your your uh friends uh in such a way to where you hang around them I think you ought to be friendly of course and and how do you do and and you know things like that but when they become your running buddy uh uh that's why we don't believe that a a a girl uh should date an unbeliever or a boy should date an unbeliever and Parents Ought to teach their children that too amen but uh because uh uh you you you you shouldn't hang around people that smoke and drink and do drugs and and all of these things it's it's just you you can't get on the devil's grounds and then expect to maintain a Christian Life you you just can't we are a people that you've got to flee if if you're going to be a Christian flee to Refuge ain't that right amen see so uh uh you know uh uh now Paul would tell us that there is a people who have fled for Refuge amen and and and I'm I I I I believe that people have recognized the enemy uh in this day ain't that right so we're constantly we're constantly trying to get away amen and and running for shelter we we understand that I uh I don't care how long you've been serving the lord uh uh always got to keep your guard up at all times because the devil is doing everything he can uh uh to suck you out I mean that's just the facts he just is and he's good at what he does ain't that right but these people have fled which means that they have recognized the enemy they're not running to the enemy amen but they are separating themselves from the very things that would harm them and Destroy them and therefore they are the ones that's are overcoming because that's what the prophet says to overcome means to recognize the devil in everyone in every one of his tricks ain't that right amen recognizing the devil in his tricks every one of his tricks you can recognize the devil in that pinpoint the spirit ain't that right so God has called us to overcome God has not called us Amen to be lukewarm God has not called us to entertain unbelief and and to be weighed in the balance and and whether you know I should go or whether I shouldn't whether God's promise is right or whether he's not and just playing the game he loves me he loves me not I'm going to I'm going to overcome I don't know if I'm going to overcome I'm I'm going to make it I don't know if I'm going to make it he's called me I don't know if he's called me and you're just constantly going back and forth ain't that right God has not called us to do that but God has called us to overcome amen which means that we are not to be the victim but we are to be the Victor we are to obtain Victory ain't that right well there's three words that come together and and and and really associate together that's overcome conquer and victory everybody say overcome conquer and victory they all speak of the same thing see if you if I if you have overcome that means that you have conquered and if you have conquered that means that you have Victory ain't that right how many wants Victory amen no sense in just going through life depressed there's got to be a victory amen there's no sense in in going and just coming to church and can barely lift our hands up there's got to be some victory involved amen Christian life has victory in it and so if if we've overcome and conquer and we now have this Victory and the Victory is not just when we make it to Heaven I believe that Victory is now that's what brother Ram says about dancing when you see someone dancing in the spirit genuine Spirit he said that's a sign they've got Victory we were not going to dance around the throne uh and and then we just sit here and just struggling I believe that we can dance even now I believe we can have Victory now I believe that amen because well brother Ram says conquer and victory is the same to conquer to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prisons that means that the sin that once ruled you you rule it now can you say amen amen you rule it now it means that you have overcome it you are you have whipped it you're greater than it is you're greater than it is aren't you glad for that so you're not just in the mck in the mire with every everybody else struggling to make it amen not knowing the power of God not knowing the realities of God you realize that 99% of church people don't even know the power of God they don't even know that have never experienced the realities of God well you don't want to be that type of a person amen that just don't know the realities and the powers of God and and and and Satan is just over there just a whipping you and messing you up and and and he's got you where exactly where he wants you to be it's it's it's you've got to flee from him Flee for Refuge can you say amen amen see so the the only way that we can overcome is to flee from the enemy amen and find a refuge a place of safety you know ever since the fall of creation uh uh uh uh man and and even even well all creation I guess or uh um uh well you know man has needed a refuge at some point we've needed a refuge from storms and and uh uh typhoons and tornadoes and we we've needed a refuge from the cold from from the Heat and and and lightning and floods and and need needed a refuge from wind and and fires and needed a refuge from from predators and and all these things so so really Refuge is is our part of life we we need a refuge you know our home is a refuge right amen it's it's nice when you can go home and it's raining outside and and man just sit there and read a nice little book you know or uh listen to some music and hearing the rainfall and you ain't worried about you got a refuge amen flooding may be outside it may be all slopping muddy but you're nice and dry and warm and toasty you know let it's not whatever you know because you you you know what a refuge is ain't that right thinking of a man that was uh he he tells the story of him being out in the woods hunting and and he was walking and and and he stopped just to listen to to Nature and and uh uh just just enjoying it and he felt something at his feet and and so he looked down and there was a rabbit that had had gotten uh right close to his legs and and his feet there and he thought wow that's strange and it just sitting there you know and it was kind of panting hard and and just sitting there he thought well what what's the deal with this one you know and and so he got to looking around and sure enough here come a coyote you know and that coyote is lurking around you know and watching but he wouldn't come closer see cuz he was scared of man but that rabbit that rabbit got so desperate it it was it was scared for its life that that he come to that man for Refuge to find uh uh safety from the Predator ain't that right amen see I thinking of Charles Wesley that was taking a walk one day it was very very windy and and and uh uh as he was walking he had his coat you know his cold and and but he he was he was walking somewhere and and uh he felt a thump between you know on his on his uh in his bosom there and and uh he he looked and opened his coat up a little bit and there was a bird that was that that was there and and it was just hovering it it just stood there you know just staying right there it found it found a a refuge amen from from the wind and and it felt safe even though the man but yet it he he he found a refuge and and and it inspired Charles to start writing the song Oh Rock of Ages a cleff for me let me hide myself and thee you see we we all need a a refuge at at one point or another ain't that right Sinners need a refuge and and oh if if we could ever convince them that there is a refuge that God has provided a a refuge and uh uh see that Refuge it it would break the powers of of the the the Predator the the power of the enemy uh uh in their life amen at Refuge that that we know amen can can uh free their soul from destroy ruction and but but you know uh Holy Ghost filled people uh uh need a refuge as well uh you know the devil doesn't stop at at trying to get at us just because we've got the Holy Ghost Amen brother Ram said some people think that when they get the Holy Ghost it's all over he said it's just beginning that's when you need to be persevering ain't that right amen that's when you need to be perseverant here Paul in Ephesians 6:12 he writes and he's talking about Holy Ghost filled uh uh people and he says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places ain't that right see and and and so now now notice now we're not fighting in hopes to win a battle amen that that's not what we're fighting for because we know we've already won can you sayen we already know that we've won you know being a Christian is not about hoping to make it to Heaven being a Christian is not hoping that God loves us if you're a Christian you ought to know that God loves you if you're a Christian amen you're filled with the Holy Ghost you ought to you ought to know that you're going to make it into Rapture amen this isn't all about imagination amen receiving the Holy Ghost ain't an imagination it's it's facts it's real God's Divine Life he his Nature has now taken uh it its resting place inside of you can you say Amen so Christianity it has an assurance with it it comes with an assurance I am a Christian then I know I'm going to make it I know I'm going to overcome I know that no no no weapon formed against me is going to prosper I know these things can you say amen amen see so therefore we fight we fight not in hopes we fight because we have now received a revelation we have a revelation of who we are and we are assured as to where we are going we know that God is for us can you say Amen not always feel that that now we we not always feel that God is for us amen and and but we know that God is for us Revelation amen see we fight not because we feel good we fight because we know that God is for us it's a revelation that has come to our heart ain't that right see so then we know that the promises of God every promise that is written in this Bible is for us we know that the Rapture is for us we know that the body change is for us we know that adoption is for us we know that everything that God has promised for his church is for us we know that we're a part of the church we know we we know these things amen see and and another thing that we know is that Satan is already defeated how many knows that Satan is already defeated Satan is already defeated can you say that with me Satan you're already defeated I think sometimes we need to tell the devil that Satan you're already defeated say it verbally Satan you're already defeated that's right see well we know that and do you realize he knows that too amen he does he already had a battle with the Lord had the Keys taken from him ain't that right amen he lost the keys to his own house he lost the keys over you amen so he knows he's defeated ain't that right see so so it's good for us to remind him amen see and so if he tells us that God doesn't love us well then we automatically by revelation we know that's a lie that's right amen ain't that right so we fight we fight off any influence that he tries to put all over us if he tells us we're not going to make it well that we know that's a lie see so then we war against him by not listening to his lies can you say Amen we war against him well you're always going to be that way well we know by Revelation that we're not always going to be this way the situation is bound to change sometime somewhere it's going to because we have a promise and we have fled for Refuge can you say Amen so then we know then then our battle is not trying to be a Christian our battle is we're not going to let him influence us any longer it's a lie everything he says is a lie he tells you your children ain't going to make it that's a lie he says well you're just defeated that's a lie well you're always going to have these habits that's a lie can you say Amen so now we're fighting a a uh uh uh uh uh an enemy that we know is a lie see he's a liar the Bible says he's a liar and the father of Lies do you believe it see when Jesus was on Earth the prophet said he conquered every gate of the enemy that no other man could conquer amen he conquered the Gate of sickness for us see that's what he come to do he remember sick people he conquered that gate you don't have to conquer it he conquered it right see the other men had to conquer their own gate but you you don't have to conquer your own gate he conquered it yes sir ain't that right you don't have to conquer your own enemy he conquered it other men has to conquer their own enemies but you don't ain't that right he conquered it see that but you don't have to conquer it's already conquered he conquered the gates of sickness what did he do when he conquered the gates of sickness saying what that that he would do whatsoever things you ask on Earth and whatever you bind on Earth it will be bound in heaven he gave us the keys to that gate yes he did amen oh do you love him he conquered the Gate of Temptation by the word and the keys was resist the enemy and he'll flee from you that's right ain't that right he conquered it all conquered every sickness conquered death conquered hell he conquered death and hell he conquered what the others couldn't conquer because they were of the natural seed this is the spiritual seat he conquered the Gate of the grave and Rose up on the third day for our justification so no wonder Paul would say in Romans 8:37 we are more than conquerors ain't that right see through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor other creature shall be able to set separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord so nothing everybody say nothing can get to us nothing can defeat us nothing can you say Amen so the prophet said now we are dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated we are disputing with a defeated enemy so therefore Satan is nothing but a bluff he's nothing but a bluff that word Bluff is a false threat or claim intended to detour or deceive someone to deceive or frighten by pretending to have strength or confidence that one doesn't really have can you say Amen see so so he's a bluff that's all he is is a bluff now so what does he do amen he still Wars he's going to war now we already know through the opening of the seals he ain't got no Arrow he just got a bow he's just a bluff he's an impersonator he's whatever ain't that right but he Wars against our flesh through through afflictions through diseases and and sickness and these things he Wars against our spirit tries to get us depressed tries to to to bring us under oppression ain't that right amen he he he works through our feelings Works through our emotions works works through things we'll have a bad day we might get up and and tired and just woke up wake up as they would say on the wrong side of the bed and he tries to take advantage of them things amen we might feel good today and say oh God loves me I'm saved bless the name of the Lord wake up tomorrow and not f a thing right and he works on them things ain't that right see then then we know that Satan anoints people to say things to do things that's wrong amen as a way to get to us he anoints lawmakers even to pass laws that restrict amen our our our freedom of worship and and and and and and if you're not careful you'll start looking at all the negatives that are around and and seeing the corruption and seeing the crime and seeing the economy and and seeing all the nations uh uh Waring and and everybody bickering and everybody fighting and and if you're not careful you start looking around and you get involved in it and that's exactly what the devil wants us to do can you say amen he he he's got a reason for all these things see amen see so he tries the prophet said he tries to Blind us from the promises of God see he he's good at that right and what does he do he whispers negative thoughts to us negative to us negative every negative thought does not well all negative thoughts uh that come to you is not of God that's that's facts amen amen he's the one who plants the negative thoughts in our mind ain't that right anything negative is of the devil and and when we talk of negative uh uh we I I mean anything against God's word anything that contradicts God's promises to you Amen in this Bible amen is is negative it's not coming from God Christianity there's nothing but positive ain't that right so feelings it's good to have feelings it's good to feel good it's good to have Sensations you know anything that that uh uh what doesn't kick is dead and and and so so we we understand it's good to feel God it's good to feel saved it's good to feel all these things but feelings lie to us all the time our feelings backslide it just does and and so then any feeling and Sensation that is against the word of God comes from the devil he has access to your your feelings he has access to your Sensations he has access Amen to your imagination and to your memory and to your affections and and to all of these things he has that access the devil does ain't that right amen he's got access to your body amen see so words that are contrary to God's word comes from the devil now you know brother Bram said well people say well I I'm weak my my faith my my faith uh is not very much I'm not a very good Christian oh my now we all now I think all of us could feel that way that we're not very good Christians now it's always not when we're on the Mountaintop but it's when we're in The Valleys it's when Satan brings up our past our failures you should have known better you shouldn't have done this you shouldn't have done this and you should have done that but you didn't you know and and he brings up these things and then we begin to feel like well we're not just really good Christians things like that well notice what he says well you people say I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's exactly what the devil want you to say God help us you're just talking his language right then see you mustn't never say that hello on Amen can you repeat that after me I must never say that say it out loud now I must never say that say what I'm not not a good Christian come on don't say that you're not a good Christian don't say that you're not going to make it on don't say that well I don't know if my children is ever going to get saved don't say that you're talking his language that's right can you say Amen you're you're just talking his language right in you must never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive part of the time no he didn't say that sorry let it be positive all the time all the time everybody say all the time all the time only when I feel good no only when I feel safe no only when my prayers seem to be getting through finally no never or let it be positive all the time amen ain't that right got to flee from him I'm saved I have God in my heart I believe believe him with all of my heart well do you believe in Divine Healing with all of my heart amen can you say Amen see let your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it and when it starts that don't you entertain it well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming well that that that'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he sure sure could stop them from roosting ain't that right that's that's right you can't keep the thoughts from coming in your mind but you can sure stop from letting imp plant in your mind that's right that's right I think we're all guilty of it we need to stop it amen amen that's right can you say amen amen see so he said see that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just let it pass amen this too shall pass you know there's that saying it it it didn't come to stay it came to pass it's a song it didn't come to stay it come to pass ain't that right it didn't come to stay it come to pass so devil tell you well you just a little old ugly thing it didn't come to stay it came to pass well you just ain't going to make it you little snot-nose brat it didn't come to stay it come to pass ain't that right well look at your children they're just in a mess didn't come to stay it came to pass what are you talking about the thoughts that come into your mind you may not can help them thoughts amen and Satan will show you all the negative about everything and then and then he'll start Platinum things in your mind and if you're not careful you'll start believing that stuff run run Flee for Refuge that's right ain't that right see so so he says just don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of them and Only God and and God can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you can you say Amen he's the high priest of our confession Hebrews 3 see said he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it now if we don't War if we don't war against he'll seduce us with his words he'll seduce us with thoughts ain't that right yes sir see now notice in the prayer line brother brandham speaks to a woman and he said will you come sister so right automatically calling her sister so he knows that she's a Christian well you come sister you believe with all your heart you're H you my you're having awful trouble aren't you fighting every day you got the hardest thing to get over there is and that's nervousness yes sir you got a mental distress nervousness you're always dropping things too aren't you I've seen you too almost dropped some dishes the other day stand there when you stand up at that scene but now God is here to make you well you believe that he said Lord Jesus I pray that you'll make this evil spirit leave her notice evil spirit leave her May It Go from her tonight I ask in jesus' name he says now look sister now let me tell you something you can't get a hold of yourself Satan tells you you're going to lose your mind and everything you will if you continue on you will if you continue on but looky here look look you got to get a hold of yourself before you can do anything the blessing up on there see you wouldn't get out of this building until Satan will tell you well wasn't nothing to it notice how brother Brown's telling her what Satan's fighting her on going to tell her before she leaves the building oh there ain't there was nothing to it right now Satan tells us that a lot well maybe he don't tell you he does talk to me sometimes and then when he does notice when he does you're lost back again see you're lost back again you've got to get up get your up here see don't fall back down leave him get out of that man yes sometimes people like to they they like Negative they they like to think these negative thought they love pity party ask them how are you doing oh I don't know one One Pastor he he asked on well how are you doing and and then all of a sudden well I don't know he goes sorry I asked sometimes it just makes you sorry yes but but people you you tried I I've tried to pump faith into people and and and then they just well I don't and then you just give up cuz some people just like that negative they they like to live down in that low State as as though they get more sympathy we don't want sympathy we want to rise up we want to know how to defeat the Devil we want to know that you don't have to be this way I want you to tell me and I want I hope you you're mind me tell telling you tonight you don't have to be that way you can get out of the out of the garbage I hope that's okay when when you just got your mind in such a model that you began to accept defeat thank God for my wife and she just tell you know kind of kicks me in the spiritual seat and says you know what uh uh get up right thought the time brother you know brother brandom even told his wife says says you know I I I I don't even think I'm saved or don't think I'm called to preach that's what it is I I don't I don't even know if I'm called to preach and he says in my dear faithful wife and she said oh bill you stop talking like that you know because what is it we the devil is fighting that's right ain't that right but some people just like to accept it if the doctor says hey there ain't no there just ain't no hope and no wonder people don't get nowhere but we've we've a refuge we are a people that have fled for Refuge don't sit there and listen to that little old liar not calling the doctor I'm calling the devil so he says see he said see there there's there's nothing the devil tell you there was nothing to it when he does you're lost right back he said you've got to get yourself up here you've got to believe your well then go believe your well believe it's going to be okay can you say amen he said you believe that you're healed asking her then go act like it you believe it then act it amen you love the Lord if you believe you're saved then act like it praise the Lord if you believe you're on your way to heaven then act like it don't you let the devil act like make you act like a a bum don't you make the let the devil make you act like you're just some little old forgotten thing when the when the blood of Jesus Christ has washed you from all your sins rightall now Paul says this this Refuge is an anchor of our soul that's right so so he says see he said you got to believe your well then go act like it now notice how he says go Act act like it how's she going to act like it he says just go thanking God don't even say nothing about nervousness no more don't talk about what the devil does to you don't talk about them thoughts anymore don't talk about how bad your children are how bad your husband is how bad your wife is and how bad you got it quit talking about it that's true flee entertaining him you shut his mouth up by not listening to it that's right I know it's hard to fight isn't it but you got to amen you got to flee that's right got to flee yes sir be positive people God help us help me as a to be a positive preacher yes God I'm not talking about Jose Olstein type positive on the word positive on the word can you say amen amen don't even say nothing about nervousness no more go on don't accept nothing the devil gives you just go on so now this is how you're going to act like it if you believe it act like it if you believe your children going to get saved act like it if you believe you're going to heaven act like it if you believe you're forgiven for Pete's sake let's act like it don't talk about your sins don't talk about your past don't talk about your failures amen amen you understand what I'm saying don't talk about how discouraged you are don't talk about how all of these things you are amen amen I know if we talk negative we get more sympathy right I know I understand where you're at we baffle people when all hell is against you and you say well praise God and everybody just scratching their head like huh it's easier to go the the norm that's right come on now complain gri just just come on I don't know he says you know don't accept nothing the devil gives you just go on thank God you've been all scrupled up in your life too I see that all kinds of mixups now you go on believing God you're a little nearsighted too aren't you well when you read anything you hold it real close when you see see I seen you when you was a child in school now you go on and believe God and you're going to get well now go shouting and rejoicing and thanking God how many wants to do that how many's got something to thank God for how many wants got something to praise God for God has been too good to us we are a people that have fled for Refuge we've got a refuge we were a slave to the devil we ain't no no more we've actually got every god-given right to tell that Old Slew Foot get out of my life hallelujah praise the Lord there's one thing that Satan cannot do he cannot touch the soul amen God showed it through a type in the first Exodus just before the death angel was to strike God required a token which was the blood of the lamb and he said to the people when I see the blood I'll pass over you right so everyone else without the blood they had every right to fear they had every right to shake and quiver and cry and boohoo and sing all these sad songs and all these things they had every right don't blame them but everyone that had the blood I think I read it here Maybe not maybe it was in Arkansas you know brother brand said anyone that went under that blood and they started fearing he said it was an insult to God that was an insult to Jehovah when they God says if I see that blood you apply that blood and and then you're under that blood and then you start doubting and you start quivering and you start fearing and you start he said that's an insult to Jehovah he says don't insult God Amen true are you with me God said he'd provide for you don't insult him Amen brother amen we say God's the one that's leading us then don't insult him by questioning it if God's leading you he's going to provide for you if he's going if he said he's going to provide he's going to [Music] provide so he says you know when I see the blood I'll pass over you every house had to have the blood on display and when when they had that blood then it became a refuge it became a refuge they they had ran to a refuge because and The Refuge was identified by the token amen come on now you say Amen see Satan can afflict you in your body and he doesn't God now we know that God's A Healer so you don't have to accept your afflictions but what I am saying is God can heal you from a cold today and and and Satan will put something on you tomorrow so brother BR said healing is a minor thing it's it's not something we major on even though we believe it and I hope everybody don't take me wrong on that if you got afflictions God will heal you I believe that with all my heart right but that does not stop Satan from afflicting you in some other way right you can be heal healed of cancer and die in a car wreck break a leg right so Satan can afflict your body and he can also afflict you mentally see there's a physical sickness there's a mental sickness and it all comes from Satan ain't that right but I want to say this it does not mean that you're demon possessed a man that a person that is suffering in their mind having mental issues it does not necessarily mean that that uh uh they demon possessed and you say Amen now Ephesians 1:13 in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also you after that you have believed you were what someone know the scripture sealed yeah you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God Amen whereby you are sealed until the your trial comes nope until the day of your Redemption amen ain't that right sealed see second Corinthians 1:21 now he which hath which establishe US with you in Christ and hath anointed us is God who hath also sealed us and given uh the earnest of the spirit in our hearts our soul can you say Amen so there is one place the devil has no Authority no power over no nothing and that's in your soul if God has if you've got the holy ghost that Holy Ghost is a seal to your soul so the devil can afflict you in your body he can afflict you in your mind he can afflict you in any way but he can not touch the main thing and that's the soul amen amen Colossians 3:2 now notice we're getting more into the Refuge now where we're at you are dead and your life everybody say my life is hid amen with Christ in God the prophet said the devil can't get to you he can't do it he has to come through the same process you did if he did that he'd be your brother so he can't get to you can you say that with me amen devil you can't get to me devil you can't get to me now that's that's not positive thinking that's reality he can't he can't if you if you got the Holy Ghost you're sealed in can you sayen he can't come through that the prophet said see a seal is a security seal means that you are secured now you you you don't believe you that don't believe in eternal security what a refuge Eternal eternal security I don't know but a seal signifies security to its destination who that guy that would try to break that seal and the Holy Spirit seal cannot be broken you all have heard me say that people said well the devil made me do that no no no the devil did not do that he said you just wasn't saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost he says or or uh yeah he he uh he said you just wasn't sealed in so then because when you're sealed in he sealed out right amen he sealed out now when you you went out to him he couldn't get into you because the the only way he'd get into you is come through the same process that you would have see he'd have to be saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost then he'd be your brother so he didn't do that no you just to the borderline come back lusting for the things of the world he never went in all the way over into Canaan across Jordan the death to self can you say Amen so I want to say this even to you young people if you gave your heart to the Lord that's wonderful but don't you stop there you need to get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen and then you need to get filled with the Holy Ghost don't you stop there don't stop at just giving your heart to the Lord on can you say amen amen that's right don't say well I gave my heart to the Lord two years ago and then you feel all safe and secure you got to know that you are have the Holy Ghost and if you've got the Holy Ghost there is something about you that you're going to flee flee flee amen amen you ain't going to entertain all them that crazy wacko stuff that the world is you ain't going to want to go to parties you're not going to want to hang around them you're your sinner friends you're going to seek other friends you're going to seek other Fellowship why because you're sealed with the Holy Ghost that stuff I I'm not saying you cannot be tempted I'm not saying that you won't fall brother Bram said we backslide every day he said you will make mistakes he's saying is it's not sin yet because the moment you realize that you made your mistake you'll automatically say God I'm sorry I didn't mean to do it get back up and you go again but the desire for it is gone that's right talked to people before that still have a desire to drink claiming to have the Holy Ghost if if you got that type of desire you ain't got it right you can even be Sanctified that's right I'm talking about fleeing that's right God knows what to do take care of it if you're in a refuge that Refuge is something that takes them desires out of you you love the Lord amen amen so now John 16:33 and I I'll try to hurry here but John 16:33 uh Jesus said these things that I I have spoken unto you that in me everybody say in me in me you might have peace what is a refuge for to give you peace right amen right you're in your house and they're saying a Blizzard's coming you know not going to well you know I mean you shouldn't be worrying about whether the snow is going to fall on you I hope me sitting in my living room I'm not going to have to walk in 2 feet of snow oh I hope not no you should be at peace amen sure L the carpenter forgot to put the roof on I don't know but when you're in this Refuge that in me in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulations but be of good cheer huh yes I have overcome the world yes sir now notice what this piece is a state of quiet freedom from disturbance or War freedom from upsetting thoughts or feelings so here comes Christ to give us peace people who have fled for Refuge ought to know what peace is peace come on Amen how many likes peace sure how many wants peace he's come to give us peace he wants us to have peace right right be not troubled fear not peace that's right that's right now that that peace every believer ought to know peace I am not saying that Satan doesn't try to trouble I'm not saying that Satan don't try to come and you know get us to where you know they we don't have answers for every day amen we don't have answers on all things but there should be such an inner peace in that Soul amen and Believers should always pursue peace that's right now peace this peace he says peace I I give unto you it's not the way the world gives it right right it's not false promises given I know we got you know we got a candidate running says if I am president never be World War I that's false peace right right there ain't no politician that has a guarantee of answers for the future so if you're looking for peace in that way peace in money peace in economy peace in these things peace in Nice Home peace in a in in nice marriage peace in the beautiful woman in the handsome guy peace in all these things your peace is wrong ain't that right amen come on now but there is a peace that the world cannot give and that peace comes by being in him believing in him trusting in Him having confidence in him come on Church you ain't going to run to a refuge you ain't got confidence in ain't that an insult okay I've got I've got the compound just for you so if the enemy comes Russia don't you worry about it we got we've got the we got soundproof it's been tested it's been tried nothing and then you're down there I don't know well might well you might as well just go get up in a tree somewhere go hide out in the out housee or something I don't know if you're going to be afraid in if you're going to be scared in The Refuge what's the point now well if Jesus has a established himself as The Refuge right right then why do we worry about things can you say Amen now in closing as Christians we should speak seek for peace know the difference between peace and turmoil right ain't that right right as Christians the Christian home should be peace A Home of Peace amen the Christian marriage should be a marriage filled with peace the Christian family should be a family filled with peace as the head of our homes fathers husbands we should always always everybody say always always seek for peace we want peace we're the head of our homes hello then then we should never invite turmoil we should never create turmoil we should never we we should never create such environments in our home where Satan is able to come in and torment our children torment our wives torment ourselves we want a Home of Peace we are believers that's right we have a refuge yes that's right come on now can you sayen see so then us fathers and husbands should keep the right environment in home yeah come on hello amen true don't run your children down don't run your wife down don't cause things that causes turmoil now all of us and I'm not going to have the marriage counseling tonight but we all know that we can push one another's buttons sure been around your wife long enough you know how how to push the button she been around long you know around you long enough she knows how to push the button we ought to stop pushing buttons because we want to pursue peace we are people of Peace we don't want our homes to be Havoc we don't want to make environments to where the devil is constantly Waring against our children and constantly warning against our wife to where they can't come to Victory because of our actions right amen that's right can you say amen yeah we have fled for Refuge why did we flee from ref for Refuge because we know the power of the enemy and we know the power of refuge and we want peace we know exactly what the devil can do hey the devil's driving people to Insanity he's driving people to the place to where they they they commit suicide come on amen come on now can you say Amen he's driving to the point that people are so depressed they can't get up they can't look up right we know what the devil does we know what he's doing well we don't want to give him access on if we're in the Refuge then we should want to reflect the Refuge yes sir we want a Heavenly environment in our homes we want a Heavenly environment in our lives the wife should do that too you mothers you you you you you wives understand and and I I think it's amazing how ignorant men can be sometimes when they're just constantly living a selfish life they're constantly just away from home and they know not even given consideration that they are the head of that home not just for finances but they are the protector and not just by a gun but they are the spiritual protector of their home and while they're out doing their thing and I understand you got to work I understand these things but you also got a wife you also got a home you got children that need you and you should not be Husband by name that's right you shouldn't just be father well look I'm father cuz look at my children brother Bram says there's many instructors but very few fathers in the fact that men must be a a a uh one your children are going to follow after you amen so here we are we're Protectors of our home not just natural protectors We Are Spiritual protectors and we must realize that Satan is constantly while you're at work she may even be home but Satan's trying to put depression on her Satan's trying to destroy her Satan's trying to ruin her life and then we come home telling her how bad of a job she does and and what she's this and how she does this and how she just never fitting and she never done that and here she washes your clothes she she she watches your children she's the protector she's she's doing everything to teach your children to raise them right we ought to show them a little bit respect we are the provider We Are The Protector we are seeking a refuge right can you say Amen so then we want to live in a Heavenly environment wife and mother husband father that's what we want we want to be quick to repent and forgive can you say Amen what does that do it keeps the enemy away remember that brother brand said a lot of times people don't get healed because they got an un unrep repentant sin they got an unconfessed sin that they have not now this is not all the time but there's times that that that that remember that woman brother Brown uses it for the example the woman that cheated on her husband you know he's out in war and all that and she's running around with the guy and she's become demon uh Afflicted with demons remember she's losing her mind she was a she was she was a I think a Sunday school teacher she sung in the choir she was a churchgoer she all these things nothing could help her doctors couldn't help nobody could help finally your pastor says you need to go visit brother brandham she goes there and brother Bram just sitting there and all of a sudden come to him you you you you cheated you you run around with this man oh no no no no no no you know I've already covered that up I already apologized to godun and what did he say he said you didn't do God wrong you done your husband wrong now go make that right oh no I can't do that he'll leave he goes well that's up to you but if you want to be delivered to this you got to go make that right got to repent why because unconfessed sins keep the devil in charge it gives him a way to get in can you say amen amen but one thing that helped her out is he said your husband's got something to confess to you too right she goes confess and he got all blowing up she go didn't you go run around too on this such who told you when they made it right God healed her she got delivered can you say Amen so see unconfessed sins need to be under the blood put under the blood that's right I don't care what it is if you've done wrong if You' done someone wrong if youve done your wife your husband your children wrong don't sit there and try to make it up and don't don't sit there and use his excuses get it under the blood there's a refuge am can you say Amen you love the Lord if the musicians will come got more to go but we'll stop there you know in the Old Testament of course under the law if if a man done something wrong it was eye for an eye tooth for a tooth so even if a man accidentally murdered somebody then that family of the murdered man had every right to pursue the killer whether he accidentally did it or what so God says what I'll do and he moved upon I believe it was Joshua to provide Cities of Refuge that if if a man committed such an act he could run he could run run from his pursuer he could flee and get to that Refuge now if his pursuer got to him before he got to The Refuge then he would die but if he get to that Refuge then he could plead his case and the prophet says now if he if he if he didn't do it willfully he says you know what I I didn't mean to I uh this was happened d d d du he would be allowed to come into that refuge and the power of the enemy would be broken right then because the enemy the pursuer could never come into that refuge and snatch him out hello everything was provided for that man in that Refuge to where he could live a Peaceable life didn't have to worry can you say Amen we've got a greater a a greater Refuge than what Joshua could ever provide because our enemy is more strong our enemy is more potent our enemy had more claims on us than what you could ever think he had a powerful claim cuz we were born Sinners by Nature by birth we had no we had no saying to it amen so Satan had lay he he had every right to lay claim to our our physical being our mental our soul he could lay claim to it all and we were just his victims he could do anything he wanted to do and we just had to give into it I thought oh my how the world is in such a bondage out there and Satan is just doing everything he can to them mamas killing their own babies think what mother and her right mind would do that that she's under the control but you know brother brandom said this he said a man has got to want a place of Refuge you got to feel your need for it but if you want to fight your own battles go ahead but you're sure to be caught by your pursuers can you say amen amen what about our refuge well if you read the Bible you're studying it one thing our refuge must have is [Music] blood remember when Cain tried to worship god without blood God rejected him oh my but Abel had a bloody sacrifice and he was accepted before God he could come and talk to God because of blood oh I think of so many people trying to find the Refuge and think they've got it but there's no blood [Music] there you see only by blood can we be accepted only by Blood could our high priest that great high priest make intercession for our sins that's the only way the high priest could make intercession is by Blood ain't that right do you realize that that's the only way we could have mercy is when blood is on The Mercy Seat brother Bram talks about it when the blood goes off The Mercy Seat then it's nothing but judgment but there's got to be a refuge with [Music] blood we could go on and on about the blood but also our place of Refuge must have the word because the word of God will def defeat Satan anytime anywhere under any conditions no matter how weak you may feel you might feel like you're the weak as Christian but the word of God you can defeat the you can defeat the Devil any demon of Hell by the word of God brother Ram said he had Jesus had power upon power but he never used a one to defeat the Devil with he took the word of God to show that you can defeat the word of God too or defeat the Devil by the word of God and you say Amen the word of God is a law and not only does the does the accused live by that law but the accuser has to live by the law think of it how many court cases are do we have in in the country that are going on men that are accused of things and the accuser his job is to present the case of accusation ations present the facts present it all I'd hate to being that accused sitting there as the accused listening to my accuser especially when all I can say is yeah he's right he's right I did do these things right but what if that judge could find a way by the law to Pardon you and then he says but he's not guilty oh how free you must feel because then it shuts the accuser up why because the law has just said there's no guilt the law has said no matter what that accuser says he's over with his case is done he can't accuse no more the law says [Music] it therefore the accused lives by that same law I'm not guilty and the accuser has to look at that at at the the person he's accusing and has he got to shut up there's no more case he can't put him into prison because the law says can you say Amen so therefore the accusations have no value he can recommend the life sentence he can recommend the death sentence but his recommen recommendation has no hold it has no power because the law says not guilty can you say Amen so therefore God's word has become a refuge to the accused oh do you love the Lord there's no claim against us what a refuge it's over we're free the Bible in so many places talks about how God is our refuge oh and just in I've got just scriptures you know God is our refuge and strength of very present help in the time of trouble therefore we will not fear though the Earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof we're not going to fear because God is our refuge on and on and on it talks about the Refuge God I Isaiah 252 thou has been a strength to the poor a strength to the needy in his distress a refuge from the storm a shadow from the heat when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall so God offers himself as The Refuge but I like this Isaiah 32 And1 Behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as a hiding place a man shall be is a refuge from the wind and a cover from The Tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land a man shall become I thought of that God being our refuge how can a man be our refuge because God became man God our Refuge took on flesh and that blood that's there it's not a natural blood from a common born sex born man it's a created blood God would create his own blood just one drop of blood is so powerful to wash away the sins of the world one drop of blood the Bible says we've been washed by in his own blood brother Brown says that washed means loosed we've been loosed by the blood of God aren't you glad for that there's blood there but only that he's coming this day he's come in flesh again the lamb has opened the book that has been sealed that's got our Redemption claims that's got everything about our life lives not our not our lives of Sinners but our lives of what he had in his [Music] mind he got our names written down and he come to open the book Revelations 10:1 says he come down from heaven and he puts his feet upon land and sea and he declares time to be no more but he has a book it's open book right what did Brother Brown Say he come to take that book for Redemption claims to claim everything that he has redeemed what a [Music] refuge he's reading from the book He's not reading your life story he's not reading your history you you we all you know people are so interested in their history but what if you find out that your your family tree comes from thieves Robbers no good people drunks brother brah said all of his was drunks died with their boots on what a history but God didn't read that history he read another history and he says not guilty Justified as though you never did it in the first place free you are the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus Christ our refuge thank God for the word thank God that our refuge has the word that when Satan comes and he starts to accuse there's that word to say free not guilty they were with me before the foundation of the world without spot wrinkle or blemish what sins are you talking about
