[35:55] he asked me to greet you all all and to
[35:58] let you know that he sure loves you all
[36:00] loves the church and and U he tune he
[36:04] Tunes in every service that he can if
[36:06] not then he listens to these
[36:10] Services uh afterward but uh so he he
[36:13] does stay connected but U it's nothing
[36:16] like being at church and uh having him
[36:18] here in
[36:20] person but uh he's uh certainly been a
[36:23] blessing uh to the bride uh or around
[36:27] the world and uh we appreciate what God
[36:30] is
[36:31] doing uh The Book of Revelations the 2
[36:34] chapter if you have your
[36:39] Bibles and
[36:42] um Revelations chapter
[36:46] 2 and uh we just
[36:52] uh let's see here uh the 11th verse
[37:01] but it says he that hath an ear let him
[37:03] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[37:05] churches he that overcometh shall not be
[37:08] hurt of the second
[37:11] death and then if you'd like to go with
[37:14] me to Revelations the 20th chapter and
[37:21] um we've read these two scriptures um
[37:26] this a couple weeks ago now but
[37:32] um praise the
[37:34] Lord
[37:35] um it's uh Revelations 20 and
[37:40] 6 blessed and holy is he that hath part
[37:44] in the First Resurrection on such the
[37:47] second death hath no power but they
[37:50] shall be Priests of God and of Christ
[37:54] and shall reign with him a thousand
[37:57] years amen let's just bow our heads in a
[38:01] word of prayer precious
[38:04] father Lord as we enter this part of the
[38:08] service
[38:10] now Lord we realize how sacred it is
[38:14] father and this is the most important
[38:18] part for it's your word we ask Lord that
[38:22] you would help us just to surrender
[38:24] ourselves to thee and and as we yield
[38:27] ourselves Lord may you work through us
[38:30] and I pray that you would anoint me
[38:33] Father anoint my lips Lord and just
[38:37] speak the words of life to us pray that
[38:40] you would anoint the congregation their
[38:43] their hearts and ears to hear and
[38:46] understand father we just ask it Lord
[38:49] may your word have the preeminence in
[38:52] this service tonight in Jesus Christ's
[38:55] name
[38:57] amen you can have your seats this
[39:02] evening and um I
[39:06] uh just uh again uh maybe if use the
[39:11] title the second death hath no
[39:15] power and um here in Revelations the
[39:20] second chapter God is addressing the uh
[39:24] Overcomer uh and he rewarding the
[39:28] Overcomer by not letting him be part of
[39:30] the the second death so it's important
[39:34] that we we do
[39:36] overcome um in in this age and O
[39:41] overcome uh means to stand the test got
[39:45] to stand the test so if if if that's
[39:50] what it means to overcome then there's
[39:52] going to be a lot of tests brother Bill
[39:55] uh come our way and all through the the
[40:00] ages uh God has had
[40:03] Overcomers uh the Saints of the Old
[40:05] Testament they all
[40:08] overcome um uh Jesus he stood the test
[40:12] in the midst of all of his
[40:14] enemies and he's when sickness come in
[40:18] the presence of sickness he overcome in
[40:21] the presence of death he defeated it in
[40:23] the presence of hell he defeated it
[40:27] in the presence of the Grave he defeated
[40:29] it in the face of Calvary of his own
[40:33] death he defeated it and the prophet
[40:35] said he defeated it by surrendering
[40:39] himself and so he defeated it all by the
[40:43] word and by humility ain't that right so
[40:47] so God in Christ defeated his enemy on
[40:51] every front every turn where the devil
[40:55] come at him
[40:56] God in Christ it was God in Christ
[40:59] defeating his enemy and now Christ in
[41:03] his bride is
[41:06] defeating every enemy uh that that uh
[41:10] comes against the bride of Christ now
[41:13] God is not in the Lo business of losing
[41:16] his people sometimes we think overcoming
[41:19] requires you know efforts or strength
[41:22] and uh our our ability and and a lot of
[41:26] times you know we don't feel like
[41:28] Overcomers and sometimes we wonder how
[41:31] we will overcome and and these things
[41:33] but but God's not in the in the business
[41:36] of losing Jesus said all that the father
[41:39] hath given me I will not lose a one
[41:42] ain't that right so then we we look at
[41:46] overcoming uh that it's not a random
[41:49] thing it's not by accident and it's not
[41:52] by your willpower or your choice per se
[41:57] uh uh and it's not based on sheer luck
[42:02] uh but rather overcoming is is based on
[42:07] predestination uh you see God wouldn't
[42:10] save you and fill you with the Holy
[42:11] Ghost knowing that he was going to lose
[42:14] you because you couldn't overcome the
[42:16] world Amen that's that's not how God
[42:19] works and and and and to be honest uh
[42:23] the the pressures of life and the age
[42:26] that we're living in the darkest Agee
[42:28] the most deceitful age amen that that
[42:31] we're living in you and I wouldn't been
[42:32] able to stand against it at all there
[42:35] there would be no way to overcome the
[42:37] age if it had not been God's
[42:40] predestinated plan for us and and
[42:44] because the Bible does say that it would
[42:46] deceive the very elect if it were
[42:50] possible now it's not because I'm smart
[42:53] that makes it not that makes it
[42:56] deception not possible uh uh it has
[42:59] nothing to do with me ain't that right
[43:01] but we understand that that by the
[43:04] scriptures that our overcoming is
[43:07] predestinated and and and uh uh for for
[43:11] instance Revelations
[43:13] 3:21 uh uh God speaking again to the
[43:17] Overcomer to him that overcometh will I
[43:20] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[43:23] as I also have overcome and said down
[43:26] with my father in his throne ain't that
[43:29] right so this is a reward only to the
[43:33] Overcomer but if you notice Jesus tells
[43:36] us that the the position is not just
[43:39] given freely uh but it's it's actually
[43:43] been prepared for certain ones uh uh
[43:47] Mark
[43:48] 10:35 it talks about the disciples uh uh
[43:52] James and uh John I believe and they'
[43:55] come to Jesus asking that you know uh
[43:59] that that they could that he would Grant
[44:01] unto them uh one to sit on his right
[44:05] hand and the other one on his left hand
[44:07] and and uh in thy glory and Jesus said
[44:11] unto them you know not what you ask can
[44:13] you drink of the cup that I drink of and
[44:15] be baptized with the baptism that I am
[44:18] baptized with and they said unto him we
[44:21] can you know and Jesus said unto them
[44:24] you shall indeed drink of the cup that I
[44:27] drink of and uh and and with with the
[44:31] baptism that I baptized with shall you
[44:34] be baptized but to sit on my right hand
[44:37] and on my left hand is not mine to give
[44:41] but it shall be given to them for whom
[44:45] it is prepared amen so so there is a
[44:50] place that place is a predestinated
[44:53] place for a certain group group of
[44:56] people that is predestinated for that
[45:00] that place can you say amen and so so
[45:03] brother random even said that the that
[45:05] that position wasn't even in existence
[45:08] at that time because we had yet to
[45:12] overcome and and he says Jesus says I
[45:15] don't Grant this I can't Grant this but
[45:17] it will be given after the trial comes
[45:21] so there has to be the trials uh before
[45:24] uh uh uh this this can be given and he
[45:28] says I can't give it but after the trial
[45:30] comes they'll sit on the right hand on
[45:33] on the left and there's a predestinated
[45:36] seed see waiting out yonder for that it
[45:40] will be given to the ones that it's
[45:43] promised to it'll be given there but the
[45:46] test hasn't come yet he hasn't overcome
[45:49] yet can you say Amen so so it wasn't in
[45:52] existence at the time that they were
[45:54] talking about these things and but but
[45:57] he that it overcomes that's who this is
[46:01] prepared for and they are predestinated
[46:04] so therefore the Overcomer is
[46:07] predestinated to overcome because God
[46:10] would not God would not pre prepare a
[46:14] such a position amen if he had no idea
[46:18] amen that we were going to overcome if
[46:20] he left up the the overcoming to us in
[46:24] our in our own ability our human efforts
[46:27] and all of that forget the position
[46:29] right but he would predestinate amen uh
[46:33] uh the position for the Overcomer and he
[46:36] would predestinate the Overcomer to that
[46:40] position they are predestinated to
[46:42] overcome and it's already written that
[46:45] there's going to be Overcomers amen
[46:47] because Revelations 12:11 says they
[46:50] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[46:53] and the word of their testimony ain't
[46:55] that right so so uh brother brandom in
[46:59] in I think how can I overcome he likened
[47:02] the Overcomer to the Lily and he says
[47:05] there's nothing hardly as pretty as a a
[47:08] great big Pond Lily call it water lily
[47:11] he says how it's Radiance he says now
[47:13] where does it come from where does this
[47:15] Lily come from and notice how he's he's
[47:17] typing the Overcomer to this L he said
[47:21] it's a little seed down in the bottom of
[47:24] a muddy moncky Pond and that little seed
[47:29] yet all the radiance that'll ever shine
[47:32] in it is in it right then when it's in
[47:35] that mud amen but it has to strive daily
[47:40] see knowing that there is something see
[47:43] it's black it's dirty it's Mucky it's
[47:47] slimy and yet in that slime that it's
[47:49] living in it presses its way through the
[47:53] mud the mck and the waters and the
[47:55] stagnant places until it sticks its head
[47:58] above in the light and expresses what's
[48:01] been hid in it all the time ain't that
[48:05] right so see so that that is the that is
[48:08] the Overcomer and and brother random
[48:10] says see God by his predestination has
[48:13] brought this sea to life and it's
[48:16] pressing itself see coming to light and
[48:19] now on top of all of that it has
[48:24] overcome ain't that right see but it
[48:26] could overcome because there's a seed
[48:29] that is there put it's it's nothing that
[48:31] just happens there's a seed planted in
[48:35] that muck and the Meer and the scum and
[48:37] all of that and yet that seed has
[48:41] predestinated ordained Amen to come to
[48:44] life ain't that right and so it's pre it
[48:47] it it it it works it it pushes it it
[48:51] strives amen because God predestinated
[48:54] it for that time Amen to do so so he
[48:57] says see it doesn't Express itself down
[49:00] there in the muck and the Meer see it
[49:02] can't express itself there but it's
[49:05] getting up to express itself it's
[49:08] pressing through to express itself well
[49:11] he says neither did you in your sin and
[49:14] adultery and everything that you lived
[49:15] in you did not express anything see but
[49:20] there was a seed in there ain't that
[49:23] right see well how did the get there by
[49:27] predestination amen see so that's what
[49:29] makes an overcomer that's what makes you
[49:31] an overcomer is not that you're the the
[49:34] the best tithe pairer not that you're
[49:36] faithful at church it's nothing that
[49:38] it's not that you you you you you you've
[49:40] got all the dos and the don'ts down it
[49:43] it it's nothing there God put a seed
[49:45] down inside of you and that's what makes
[49:48] you an overcomer see and it's got a
[49:52] chance he said see but there was a seed
[49:54] in there and it got a chance to press
[49:57] itself into light and now you're in the
[50:00] presence of Jesus Christ with the
[50:02] sunlight it brought out what you really
[50:06] was in the beginning and we we know uh
[50:09] uh over and over we're not we weren't a
[50:11] sinner in the beginning we were Sons and
[50:14] Daughters of God we were always saved we
[50:18] we were with him in the beginning ain't
[50:20] that right and so now as you're
[50:23] overcoming as you're pressing as you see
[50:27] uh uh you standing the test it's only
[50:30] expressing what you were in the
[50:32] beginning so he said you see what I mean
[50:35] you saw the light you bloomed out you
[50:37] laid your heart open and now you're a
[50:39] lily amen so again God by his
[50:43] predestination has brought this SE to
[50:45] life and it's pressing itself now what
[50:49] are we to overcome uh the prophet said
[50:52] we are to overcome the leodys and age
[50:54] and every Spirit every demon throughout
[50:57] the ages is now congregated uh uh right
[51:01] here uh the Bible talks about hell being
[51:04] moved and and and and we know that the
[51:07] lid has come off of hell and every demon
[51:11] power is being Unleashed in this age
[51:14] that we're living in ain't that right
[51:16] but brother brandom says now what are we
[51:18] to overcome we are to overcome every
[51:22] denominational critic and now I'm going
[51:24] to talk about the Overcomer for just a
[51:26] moment because it's the Overcomer that
[51:29] the second Death Shall Have No Power
[51:31] Over amen overcome every denominational
[51:35] critic Believe It or Not There are
[51:38] critics around this message and and
[51:41] anytime uh you know uh uh you go and
[51:45] listen to the uh what is the attraction
[51:48] on the mountain and brother Bram makes
[51:50] the statement anytime God makes history
[51:53] and fulfills prophecy it all always
[51:55] brings up the critics as well as the
[51:57] Eagles see he says they come together to
[52:00] find out what's going on some coming for
[52:03] curiosity some coming to find fault
[52:06] others coming to criticize ain't that
[52:09] right so you you you there there's
[52:12] overcoming that that we have to do and
[52:14] and and it would be nice if if if coming
[52:17] into the message it's a uh uh is is the
[52:21] right word Utopia would be the right
[52:23] word or or a play where there's just no
[52:26] no one bothering us no one you know and
[52:28] and that's not true because the message
[52:31] of the hour brings everybody together
[52:34] and and not everybody's a Believer not
[52:36] everybody understands not everybody sees
[52:38] it but yet everybody congregates and and
[52:42] and so uh uh you you have to overcome
[52:45] the critics if you want to be in free in
[52:48] God if you want to be free then you have
[52:50] to overcome the critics who say that we
[52:52] are too emotional if if you want the
[52:55] same Pentecostal experience that they
[52:59] had on the day of Pentecost then you
[53:00] have to overcome amen the the critics
[53:03] that say that that's not possible we we
[53:06] we've moved uh uh beyond that experience
[53:10] if you want to be used of God then you
[53:12] have to overcome the the critics that
[53:15] put the limits on God as to how he can
[53:18] move and how he can work and and and and
[53:20] all these things if you want to grow as
[53:23] a as a Christian then you have to
[53:25] overcome the spirit of unbelief that is
[53:29] trying to silence the five-fold ministry
[53:32] amen within the message ranks and and
[53:35] they want us just to keep quiet and just
[53:37] to play the tapes in the church amen
[53:40] which we already know that the Bible
[53:42] talks about the the fivefold ministry is
[53:44] for the perfecting of the Saints and and
[53:46] and and on and on and on but see you
[53:49] have to overcome amen these things that
[53:52] we have to overcome and we know that
[53:53] these Spirits amen have come from
[53:56] denominational thinking and and and you
[53:58] say well they don't teach uh uh you know
[54:01] uh uh preachers to be silent whatever I
[54:03] I don't know whatever denominational
[54:05] belief but I do know this a
[54:07] denominational spirit is a spirit of
[54:09] unbelief that tries to change the word
[54:11] and takes us from the promises of this
[54:14] age so there there is overcoming and and
[54:18] and we have to overcome the spirit of
[54:20] unbelief that says the nine spiritual
[54:22] gifts aren't in operation anymore amen
[54:25] and uh uh just before brother Brandon
[54:27] went off the scene he said this he said
[54:29] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[54:32] one body which is the body of Christ and
[54:35] in that body is nine spiritual gifts
[54:38] operating through the local body the
[54:40] local church and that's Apostolic if
[54:43] I've ever known of it ain't that right
[54:46] see so there there's overcoming and you
[54:48] young people well all of us but but you
[54:50] young people you you you struggle with
[54:52] different things and brother bradam said
[54:55] is to overcome in this age you have to
[54:57] overcome the popular sins of this age
[55:01] now now there's a lot of things that is
[55:03] popular and and and and and and you know
[55:06] uh uh movies telev I mean there just all
[55:09] kinds of things that that that is
[55:12] causing the people to to become uh uh
[55:15] less less on fire for God and and
[55:18] getting our minds in in in in all kinds
[55:20] of directions and all of that well there
[55:23] there's the popular sins of this age
[55:26] amen and and then also we must overcome
[55:30] the attitude of Le osia where it says
[55:33] that I am rich I'm increased with goods
[55:36] and have need of nothing amen and
[55:39] brother Bram said we have to overcome
[55:41] that amen if there's ever a time we need
[55:44] God it's now if there's ever a time we
[55:46] need the spirit of God and the power of
[55:49] God and the moving of God it is right
[55:51] now can you sayen money cannot do what
[55:54] the spirit of God can do amen material
[55:57] things cannot do what the spirit of God
[55:59] can do amen friends cannot do what what
[56:03] the spirit of God can do amen we need
[56:06] God more than ever in our lives ain't
[56:09] that right amen so so brother brandham
[56:12] would go on and and says he see you've
[56:15] got to overcome the nicians overcome the
[56:18] things of the world overcome see these
[56:21] denominations overcome these priesthoods
[56:23] overcome every thing of the world and
[56:26] sail out and love Christ ain't that
[56:30] right so so but but youve you've got to
[56:33] remember you are predestinated to
[56:36] overcome amen if if if we stood here as
[56:39] ministers you know uh uh uh uh the
[56:43] ministers here just just here we could
[56:46] get discouraged brother Terry if if if
[56:48] we're just preaching and we're dependent
[56:50] upon the people if we're dependent upon
[56:52] your ability if we're dependent on you
[56:55] to catch everything that we're saying
[56:57] amen see uh uh it would really get
[57:00] discouraging amen but see we we we don't
[57:03] look at these things because we see that
[57:05] there's a
[57:07] predestination there there there is a
[57:09] people that is predestinated just as
[57:11] much as I'm standing here and
[57:13] predestinated amen to minister to you
[57:16] tonight in this service you're
[57:18] predestinated to hear the word amen and
[57:21] that word will take effect I I just
[57:23] believe that amen and and I I don't
[57:26] think that you have to understand
[57:28] everything amen but just to believe amen
[57:31] we don't understand everything that the
[57:33] prophet taught amen and and to be honest
[57:36] it's such an eternal word that that you
[57:38] can hear a message and say amen I got
[57:40] that one and a year from now if you're
[57:42] growing in God you'll hear that same
[57:44] message and didn't say man I didn't
[57:47] understand everything that I do today
[57:48] it's an eternal word amen but one thing
[57:52] about it you're believing it amen you're
[57:56] believing so the second death shall have
[57:59] no power over him and and that's the
[58:02] believer now of course death is
[58:05] separation the first death is in the
[58:08] physical amen where we separate from our
[58:11] loved ones we we go into the presence of
[58:14] God never never out of his presence the
[58:17] prophet said and and and so that's the
[58:19] first amen is to where uh uh our loved
[58:23] ones that's passed on they they've they
[58:25] they've separated from us we can't hear
[58:28] them can't talk to them can't can't
[58:30] can't fellowship with them or anything
[58:33] like that but the second death is the
[58:36] death of the soul and remember the Bible
[58:39] says that the woman that lives in
[58:42] pleasure is dead while she liveth in
[58:45] other words there's a separation amen
[58:48] she can have all the friends she wanted
[58:49] she could be she uh have all the world
[58:52] and and and all of these things things
[58:55] and but yet she's separated from her God
[58:59] Amen it's it's it's because she's dead
[59:02] while she's alive It also says that the
[59:05] soul that sinth that Soul shall die so
[59:11] brother random says see it's completely
[59:13] separate no more it's cut off see it's
[59:17] it's cut off and there's no more to it
[59:20] see now now he's talking about the soul
[59:23] he said now how long will take it'll go
[59:26] down through the same process it comes
[59:28] it come in and it'll come to a place
[59:31] Till There Will neither be nothing left
[59:34] of it it's just like the body the body
[59:37] amen just uh when it dies and and the
[59:40] life goes out of it amen that body just
[59:43] slowly uh deteriorates and slowly
[59:46] deteriorates it may take years
[59:48] especially with the embomb and all of
[59:50] that but it returns amen back to where
[59:54] it came from amen see and so brother BR
[59:58] said it'll just go back from every what
[1:00:00] it was made out of so he says the body
[1:00:03] dies first and then the Soul dies next
[1:00:07] and it will be no more ain't that right
[1:00:11] now I Ezekiel
[1:00:15] 18:27 it says when the Wicked Man turth
[1:00:19] uh away from his wickedness he that he
[1:00:22] has committed and doeth which is lawful
[1:00:25] and right he shall everybody say he
[1:00:28] shall save his soul
[1:00:32] alive because he considerest and turneth
[1:00:36] away from all his transgressions that he
[1:00:39] committeth he shall surely Live and Not
[1:00:45] Die aren't you glad for that what a hope
[1:00:51] amen yes so we see in in order for the
[1:00:55] soul to not be part of the second death
[1:00:59] it has to be quickened it has to be
[1:01:01] quickened and this word quickened is to
[1:01:03] be made alive so the prophet said when a
[1:01:07] man is converted his soul becomes alive
[1:01:12] with the
[1:01:13] supernatural so the natural man knows
[1:01:16] nothing of the supernatural amen that
[1:01:19] that she lives she's dead while she live
[1:01:21] a see oh she she's more uh uh in touch
[1:01:25] with the world she's more connected with
[1:01:28] the world Amen but she's dead that she
[1:01:31] in in that she has no conception of the
[1:01:35] supernatural power of God ain't that
[1:01:38] right so the man knows nothing of God
[1:01:42] and cannot know God if his soul hasn't
[1:01:46] been quickened yeah religion cannot
[1:01:50] Quicken the
[1:01:51] soul legalism cannot Quicken the soul
[1:01:55] theology formalism cannot Quicken the
[1:01:57] soul can you say Amen emotionalism
[1:02:01] cannot Quicken the soul amen now I want
[1:02:04] you to notice amen Psalms 22 and 29
[1:02:08] break it in it says None everybody say
[1:02:11] none that means no man no one no boy
[1:02:14] girl or woman amen none amen can keep
[1:02:19] his his own soul alive there's nothing
[1:02:23] now you'll have to excuse excuse me I'm
[1:02:24] going to take a cough drop amen I don't
[1:02:26] know what's going on but we'll we'll get
[1:02:29] through it
[1:02:30] anyways amen so so none can keep his
[1:02:34] soul his own soul alive now this is
[1:02:39] where the people the churches are trying
[1:02:41] to keep man alive they're trying to
[1:02:43] Quicken amen and we we we've seen it in
[1:02:47] in in again in the Pentecostal where we
[1:02:50] built up the emotion emotion we worked
[1:02:52] on the emotion and got people emotional
[1:02:55] and and and to where they cry to where
[1:02:58] they dance to where they shout to where
[1:03:00] they uh felt good and and and and all
[1:03:03] these things and and we found out it
[1:03:06] still don't keep a man's Soul alive
[1:03:10] brother amen we gone through it in the
[1:03:12] legalism and all that but we found out
[1:03:15] it doesn't keep a man's Soul
[1:03:18] alive yes sir see amen so brother
[1:03:21] brandom now he tells us you are a Time
[1:03:24] time being how many believes that you're
[1:03:27] a time being until you're born
[1:03:31] again amen then you are Eternal being
[1:03:35] see and the only way that you can get
[1:03:37] that is to have part of God in you being
[1:03:42] eternal life so we we find 2 Corinthians
[1:03:45] 3 and 6 it tells us that it's the spirit
[1:03:49] that giveth life ain't that right Romans
[1:03:53] 8:11 says say but if the spirit of him
[1:03:56] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:03:58] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:04:01] dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body
[1:04:05] by his spirit that dwelleth in you see
[1:04:08] so it takes the the the quickening power
[1:04:12] of God to Quicken that soul and make him
[1:04:16] alive ain't that right so we see how the
[1:04:20] overcoming is amen it takes the power of
[1:04:23] God to make you an
[1:04:25] overcomer yes sir I I I now here's the
[1:04:28] way I feel I don't believe that you're
[1:04:30] going to overcome and then God quickens
[1:04:32] your soul after you've overcome I I
[1:04:36] don't believe that I believe the only
[1:04:37] way you can overcome is there is a
[1:04:40] quickening power that's entered into you
[1:04:43] that's an eternal life and there's no
[1:04:46] devil in hell that can kill that life
[1:04:50] that's within
[1:04:53] you yes sir Hallelujah Paul said in
[1:04:56] Ephesians 2:1 and you hath he
[1:04:59] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:05:02] and sins Colossians 2:13 and you being
[1:05:06] dead in your sins and the uncircumcision
[1:05:09] of your flesh hath he quickened together
[1:05:12] with
[1:05:13] him notice having forgiven you all
[1:05:18] trespasses notice blotting out the
[1:05:21] handwriting of ordinances that was
[1:05:24] against us which was contrary to us and
[1:05:27] took it out of the way nailing it to his
[1:05:30] cross aren't you glad for that amen
[1:05:32] Psalms 30 and3 oh Lord thou has brought
[1:05:36] up my soul from the grave thou Hast kept
[1:05:40] me alive that I should not go down to
[1:05:44] the pit aren't you glad for the
[1:05:46] quickening
[1:05:48] power amen now I want you to notice what
[1:05:51] brother brandom says as long as you've
[1:05:54] got a Pentecostal experience in your
[1:05:57] heart Pentecost in your soul giving you
[1:06:02] eternal life then God has promised you
[1:06:05] that you'll never be touched with the
[1:06:08] second
[1:06:09] death see you've got eternal life and
[1:06:13] cannot be touched with the second death
[1:06:16] ain't that right now you see the
[1:06:18] Pentecostal age has has made the the
[1:06:21] Pentecost it's it's they they they' made
[1:06:24] it all about jumping shouting emotion uh
[1:06:28] uh they've made it all about you know
[1:06:30] the operation of gifts and and and so
[1:06:34] you judge them they made that the the
[1:06:36] people that are spiritual that can speak
[1:06:38] in tongues that prophesy that that sees
[1:06:41] the Visions sees the dreams and it it
[1:06:44] somehow marks them as some spiritual uh
[1:06:47] uh individual and you know we all you
[1:06:49] know ooh and all and you know and all
[1:06:53] these things and and you know but and
[1:06:56] and we believe that the Pentecostal age
[1:06:58] was the restoration of the gifts and God
[1:07:01] hasn't taken that out if he restored it
[1:07:03] if he took the time to restore it he
[1:07:05] didn't take it out amen but see what
[1:07:08] what happened is they centered on that
[1:07:11] and then they taught that that the Holy
[1:07:13] Ghost was the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:15] was speaking in tongues Amen brother
[1:07:18] brah said if you received the Holy Ghost
[1:07:19] by speaking in unknown tongues you did
[1:07:21] not get it like it was on the days of of
[1:07:24] Acts in the day of Pentecost ain't that
[1:07:27] right but so see what they've done is
[1:07:29] they misinterpret the day of Pentecost
[1:07:32] and what really the Pentecost was is the
[1:07:35] quickening of man's Soul yes
[1:07:39] sir can you say Amen the people were
[1:07:42] quickened in their soul what was
[1:07:45] quickened amen not the flesh not the
[1:07:48] spirit but down in that Soul there was a
[1:07:52] SE Gene word
[1:07:55] quickened ain't that right it was laying
[1:07:59] there now notice why the prophet said we
[1:08:01] did not become seed by
[1:08:03] rebirth we were seed everybody say I was
[1:08:06] seed therefore I was
[1:08:09] reborn amen yes sir you were seed
[1:08:13] therefore were reborn for only the elect
[1:08:17] can be reborn because we were seed is
[1:08:21] the reason we could be quickened in nons
[1:08:23] seeed there is nothing to Quicken that's
[1:08:26] right speak in tongues all you want to
[1:08:28] if there's not a seed there it cannot be
[1:08:30] quickened that's right roll on the floor
[1:08:33] all you want to if the seed ain't there
[1:08:36] it cannot be quickened sit on the Pew
[1:08:38] and and be like a church mouse and and
[1:08:40] and don't say a word amen it still ain't
[1:08:43] going to Quicken you if there's not a
[1:08:44] seed
[1:08:50] there truth see it's it's now if you
[1:08:54] notice what now brother Bram says now
[1:08:57] see that Eternal eternity people being
[1:08:59] Eternal see we he says it's not the
[1:09:02] person that comes Eternal cuz we don't
[1:09:05] believe in pre-existence of
[1:09:07] souls so it's not the the people it's
[1:09:11] not us that that are are uh
[1:09:14] predestinated eternally from God brother
[1:09:17] bradam said it's the word or the
[1:09:21] seed can you say Amen see you you you
[1:09:24] you're going to fight your battles and
[1:09:26] you're going to go through your pain
[1:09:27] you're going to go through your mind
[1:09:28] battles you're going to go through your
[1:09:29] discouragements you're going to go to
[1:09:31] all kinds of things and you're going to
[1:09:33] go up and down but what is eternal is a
[1:09:36] seed that is predestinated and God
[1:09:39] predestinated that seed to overcome in
[1:09:42] this Le otsy and
[1:09:44] age sir than do you believe
[1:09:47] it that's
[1:09:50] the
[1:09:51] now that's why an eagle could be born in
[1:09:54] a chicken pin that's
[1:09:56] right cuz he was Eagle to begin
[1:09:59] with ain't that right now brother Brown
[1:10:03] said see way back there too far back for
[1:10:06] the human mind to grasp the Eternal god
[1:10:08] with eternal thoughts thought and
[1:10:10] decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have
[1:10:12] I hated Romans 9:13 and neither was born
[1:10:17] and neither had done good or evil see it
[1:10:20] was the thought and then that thought
[1:10:23] became expressed and God brought back
[1:10:26] Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob
[1:10:31] alone had the seed and that is why he
[1:10:34] had respect to the birthright and the
[1:10:37] Covenant of God can you say amen amen do
[1:10:40] you realize no persuasion there is no
[1:10:43] persuasion that a man could do God could
[1:10:45] do or a prophet could do if you didn't
[1:10:47] have a seed within you to overcome he
[1:10:50] couldn't make you overcome he couldn't
[1:10:52] persuade you over come that's why us
[1:10:54] ministers aren't here to persuade you
[1:10:56] for nothing we ain't trying to persuade
[1:10:58] you to be a Christian you either are a
[1:11:00] Christian or you're not but if you are a
[1:11:03] Christian it's because God placed the
[1:11:04] seed within
[1:11:06] you that's What Makes You rugged that's
[1:11:08] what makes you indure that's what makes
[1:11:10] you go you don't have to understand
[1:11:13] everything that comes your way but
[1:11:14] there's a seed within you you will press
[1:11:18] you will fight you will go you will
[1:11:22] endure because there's a seed that has
[1:11:24] been
[1:11:25] predestinated that word is the seed that
[1:11:28] God placed within
[1:11:29] [Applause]
[1:11:32] you now notice what brother Brown said
[1:11:36] if you are true seed you will hear that
[1:11:39] word the spirit will baptize you into
[1:11:41] the body of Christ filling you and
[1:11:43] empowering you and you will receive the
[1:11:46] word for your day and age no no no no
[1:11:50] persuasion can you say Amen you don't
[1:11:53] have to backtrack and and and and be all
[1:11:56] you know silent and hope you don't
[1:11:58] offend everybody know if there's a seat
[1:12:01] in there you'll draw
[1:12:04] that you
[1:12:07] will amen
[1:12:10] now the second death will have power
[1:12:13] will have power over every soul that's
[1:12:16] not been
[1:12:19] quickened so the word seed in our soul
[1:12:22] is Quicken
[1:12:24] which makes us an overcomer in this L
[1:12:27] leodys and
[1:12:29] age we are living in an age where men
[1:12:33] have just lost their ruggedness people's
[1:12:34] just lost their
[1:12:37] ruggedness and and you know even
[1:12:41] probably the ruggedness the most rugged
[1:12:43] Man in this age ain't as rugged as what
[1:12:46] they used to
[1:12:48] be but it's it's it's you know how it is
[1:12:51] it's just well the Bible says the every
[1:12:54] generation gets weaker and wiser so
[1:12:57] that's scripture it's it's weaker and
[1:12:59] wiser ain't that right so we are in a
[1:13:02] weak by Jesus called us a weak and
[1:13:05] adulterous generation that we're living
[1:13:07] in ain't that right and and to think
[1:13:10] that we would fall in that category we
[1:13:13] would we we would fall in that category
[1:13:15] to where we would want everything our
[1:13:17] way you know the everybody would have to
[1:13:20] pet us and be careful and and and walk
[1:13:23] very very softly around us because we
[1:13:25] could get offended you know and leave
[1:13:26] the church we could get offended and
[1:13:27] just quit all together and and and on
[1:13:30] and on and on and on but we don't fit in
[1:13:33] that category because God put a seed
[1:13:37] within us and says that seed will
[1:13:46] overcome sister Jane that's why you're
[1:13:48] still here through all them years of
[1:13:51] troubles and heartaches and everything
[1:13:52] that you've gone through through
[1:13:54] amen someone's going to
[1:13:57] overcome it ain't by our
[1:14:00] will you know good and well that it
[1:14:02] ain't by our will ain't that right so on
[1:14:06] the day of Pentecost see the people were
[1:14:09] quickened and what were they quickened
[1:14:11] to the word for peter said this is that
[1:14:15] that which the prophet Joel spoke of
[1:14:18] ain't that right so so it I believe it
[1:14:21] was a word birth in that day
[1:14:23] that would Quicken them to the word see
[1:14:26] so when the spirit of God came into your
[1:14:28] soul what does it do the prophet says it
[1:14:31] quickens you from the things of the
[1:14:33] world the world becomes dead just like
[1:14:36] before you had life in your soul before
[1:14:37] there was a quickening amen then then
[1:14:40] the world was alive to you and the word
[1:14:43] of God was dead to
[1:14:45] you ain't that right and and but then
[1:14:50] then that's all you knew is the world
[1:14:52] that's all you understood is the world
[1:14:54] that's all you comprehended was the
[1:14:56] world that's why your friends were
[1:14:58] worldly friends that's that's why your
[1:15:00] surroundings were worldly surroundings
[1:15:03] that's why the atmosphere come from
[1:15:05] atmosphere of the
[1:15:07] world but but but see God didn't forget
[1:15:10] you because there was a seed he laid in
[1:15:12] you and that seed began to hunger that
[1:15:14] seed become life and and it it could
[1:15:16] have been just a mission on the street
[1:15:18] he could have been just hearing some
[1:15:19] little song or something amen about a
[1:15:21] move of God or what and all of a sudden
[1:15:24] something began to draw you there and
[1:15:26] tell you know s sister Becky God draw
[1:15:28] you to this to the place to the message
[1:15:31] to where you are at
[1:15:35] rest amen people trying to get her to go
[1:15:38] back and go this and go here and go
[1:15:40] there and she said no no no no no I
[1:15:43] found what I was looking for well I
[1:15:45] believe that's that's all of our story
[1:15:47] is we found what we were looking for and
[1:15:50] I don't care if you're a young person
[1:15:52] here tonight or or an the oldest person
[1:15:54] in here tonight you found what you're
[1:15:56] looking for when the seed is
[1:16:01] quickened praise the lord it's a word
[1:16:04] birth brother brandham said see it
[1:16:06] quickens you from this life to eternal
[1:16:09] life see another place Quicken together
[1:16:12] to set in Heavenly places with Christ
[1:16:14] Jesus feasting on Mana from
[1:16:16] above seeing the hand of God made
[1:16:19] manifest prove the promise of this day
[1:16:22] and ain't that right now notice the
[1:16:24] prophet said the church's identification
[1:16:26] today is to manifest the promised word
[1:16:29] of this
[1:16:30] day I got to say that again the church's
[1:16:35] identification it's not saying I'm
[1:16:37] Baptist assembly is of God Church of
[1:16:40] Christ
[1:16:41] Catholic that's not our
[1:16:44] identification that's the world's
[1:16:46] identification well I I'm I I belong to
[1:16:48] a certain Club I belong to this and I
[1:16:50] belong to that you don't have to belong
[1:16:53] to
[1:16:54] nothing except let this be your
[1:16:57] identification and that is to manifest
[1:16:59] the promised word of this day by The
[1:17:02] Same Spirit that manifested and
[1:17:05] quickened the word then the Same Spirit
[1:17:07] quickens the word to the believer today
[1:17:10] and manifest the same
[1:17:13] thing see you didn't start that way you
[1:17:16] were born in the muck and the Meer that
[1:17:18] predestinated seed begins to push shove
[1:17:22] if that's what I'm to be that's what I
[1:17:23] want to
[1:17:26] be see brother Brown say see it shows
[1:17:28] that the token is on this person which
[1:17:31] is the resurrected life of Jesus Christ
[1:17:33] Living in his
[1:17:37] believer ain't that right so he says
[1:17:40] when God placed his holy spirit in you
[1:17:42] which is God then you are Eternal as God
[1:17:45] is amen now we're talking about second
[1:17:48] death
[1:17:49] now he said you're part of God because
[1:17:52] you become a son or daughter of godone
[1:17:55] and you are displaying his
[1:17:57] word word for this
[1:18:00] age another place he said Jesus was the
[1:18:03] Roy seed he lived in a human body and
[1:18:07] when the spirit called to him the word
[1:18:10] manifested thought he went to Jordan and
[1:18:13] was baptized in water upon obeying the
[1:18:16] word the Holy Spirit came upon him and
[1:18:21] the voice said this is my beloved Son
[1:18:23] hear ye him notice the voice did not say
[1:18:27] this has become my
[1:18:30] son Jesus was the son he was the
[1:18:34] predestinated son amen and the Holy
[1:18:38] Ghost positioned him as that son before
[1:18:41] them
[1:18:42] all then having been filled thus and the
[1:18:45] same pattern holds at uh Pentecost and
[1:18:49] Ever After he went in demonstrated power
[1:18:53] receiving the full revelation of God and
[1:18:56] from God for that
[1:19:00] day
[1:19:01] hello that's right so the Holy Ghost
[1:19:04] doesn't make you a son you always was a
[1:19:07] son this Dynamics does not make you a
[1:19:10] son it it it it places you as a son it
[1:19:15] shows to the world you always were a son
[1:19:18] amen ain't that right so you don't
[1:19:20] become seed when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:19:22] upon you you it only identifies that you
[1:19:25] are a
[1:19:27] seed ain't that right now in Galatians 3
[1:19:31] and I'm going to try to hurry now I got
[1:19:33] got a few things but Galatians 3 Paul
[1:19:35] identified the seed singular with Jesus
[1:19:38] and he counted the seed children as
[1:19:42] children of the promise see and so the
[1:19:46] promise has to do with the prophet said
[1:19:48] election or the choosing of God that
[1:19:51] that's the promise see we're children
[1:19:52] Children Of Promise what is the
[1:19:54] Overcomer Children of the
[1:19:56] promise ain't that right so he says see
[1:19:59] these who are of the royal seed are the
[1:20:02] elect of God are the predestinated for
[1:20:05] known of God and were in the mind of God
[1:20:07] and His Thoughts in very plain language
[1:20:11] the true bride of Christ was in the mind
[1:20:13] of God
[1:20:17] eternally though not expressed until
[1:20:20] each came forth in the design decreed
[1:20:24] season and how when do we become
[1:20:27] expressed in a mortal body surrounded by
[1:20:31] death surrounded by corruption
[1:20:33] surrounded not only by physical death
[1:20:35] but spiritual death hello and yet we
[1:20:40] were in God's mind
[1:20:43] Eternal Eternal ain't that right see so
[1:20:47] as each member came forth became
[1:20:49] expressed it became expressed and took
[1:20:51] its place in the body body thus this
[1:20:53] bride is the literal spoken word seed
[1:20:57] bride yes sir another place God sent
[1:21:00] forth the Holy Spirit it was to Quicken
[1:21:02] also that seed of eternal life that he
[1:21:05] forew before the foundation of world
[1:21:07] that would be here another place that
[1:21:09] word lives and produces itself just
[1:21:12] exactly what God has ordained for this
[1:21:15] age you have it ain't that right the
[1:21:18] Holy Ghost the holy spirit being
[1:21:20] displayed so that's the overcome
[1:21:23] the word coming to manifestation in
[1:21:27] you that's why you don't quit that's
[1:21:30] right I got to say you can't quit you
[1:21:33] can't
[1:21:34] quit I ain't trying to encourage you I'm
[1:21:36] just trying to tell you you can't quit
[1:21:39] how many people have tried to quit and
[1:21:40] can't quit I think it was Ezekiel that
[1:21:43] said I tried I I just got so discouraged
[1:21:45] I think it was Ezekiel or Jeremiah he
[1:21:47] said I I got so tired and discouraged
[1:21:50] and sin the people and their Stony fa
[1:21:52] faces and all of that he said I just I
[1:21:54] just told God I ain't doing it I and he
[1:21:57] said the more I sat there the more like
[1:21:58] it was like fire shut up in my bones he
[1:22:03] couldn't he he just
[1:22:08] can't see so he says what is it he said
[1:22:11] see the Holy Spirit the word has been
[1:22:14] quickened to you by the Holy Spirit to
[1:22:15] vindicate this age that you have passed
[1:22:18] from Death un life so what it it you are
[1:22:21] his the the Holy Ghost has bore witness
[1:22:24] in you and through you that you are
[1:22:28] his ain't that right and because he is
[1:22:33] we have the right to all that he has
[1:22:35] purchased for us every promise in the
[1:22:38] Bible is
[1:22:41] yours isn't that worth
[1:22:44] overcoming that's worth over every every
[1:22:47] every
[1:22:48] trial everything that we go through
[1:22:51] because we know that every promise
[1:22:52] belongs to me no longer am I looking at
[1:22:56] and say well that just belongs to
[1:22:57] Brother Steve that just belongs to
[1:22:58] Sister Elizabeth that belongs to you
[1:23:00] know to my wife no no no I can say it
[1:23:03] belongs to me I'm taking it now as
[1:23:06] personal ain't that right I'm believeing
[1:23:09] for you too but I'm believing for me
[1:23:12] too so he redeemed you to every promise
[1:23:16] that he predestinated you to and he has
[1:23:19] quickened you to it right amen now
[1:23:24] that's how you can press like the Lily
[1:23:26] through the mud and the muck of the
[1:23:28] world ain't that right now notice Psalms
[1:23:32] 33:18 behold the eye of the Lord is upon
[1:23:35] them that fear Him upon them that hope
[1:23:38] in his Mercy to deliver everybody say to
[1:23:40] deliver their soul from
[1:23:44] death and to keep them alive in famine
[1:23:48] are we not in famine yes sir not just of
[1:23:52] not a famine of hearing or of bread and
[1:23:54] water but a famine of hearing the
[1:23:57] word and as I said you know famine death
[1:24:00] follows the famine and spiritual death
[1:24:03] is all over the land but here we find
[1:24:06] that God is here to deliver their soul
[1:24:08] from Death our soul from death and to
[1:24:10] Keep Us Alive in the middle of all this
[1:24:14] famine Lord amen see the second Death
[1:24:17] Shall Have No Power Over
[1:24:19] You the second death is more powerful
[1:24:22] than the first
[1:24:24] death amen because the first death
[1:24:27] doesn't finish
[1:24:28] everything amen it only affects the
[1:24:32] physical but but you know if you know we
[1:24:37] have found out that that even in the
[1:24:40] physical God raises the
[1:24:43] dead ain't that right so the first death
[1:24:47] really doesn't finish everything but
[1:24:49] it's the second death that finishes it
[1:24:51] all some people have the notion that
[1:24:54] when a man dies physically then then he
[1:24:56] is no more existent and he just ceases
[1:24:59] but that's not true the resurrection of
[1:25:02] Lazarus
[1:25:03] proves that man doesn't become extinct
[1:25:07] amen Moses being seen on the mount
[1:25:09] Transfiguration talking to Jesus years
[1:25:13] thousand or so years after he had
[1:25:15] already died and yet they saw him there
[1:25:19] alive talking to Jesus see even Jesus
[1:25:22] proved it when he preached to the souls
[1:25:24] that were in prison yet his body was
[1:25:27] laying in the grave amen lifeless and
[1:25:30] yet he was there preaching to the souls
[1:25:33] in prison in
[1:25:35] hell so the physical death that first
[1:25:38] death does not finish everything a man
[1:25:42] the Tucson paper wrote an article years
[1:25:44] ago about that woman driving down the
[1:25:47] road going about you know 50 m an hour
[1:25:49] and uh she hit an old man with an
[1:25:51] Overcoat on and you know the prophet
[1:25:54] said she screamed she stopped her car it
[1:25:56] threw him up in the air right out in the
[1:25:58] plain desert she run back to find him he
[1:26:00] wasn't there so what did she do some
[1:26:02] people behind her saw it happen saw the
[1:26:05] old man fly up in the air and and and
[1:26:07] his Overcoat turning so they run back to
[1:26:10] find out they couldn't find the man
[1:26:11] anywhere they called the police police
[1:26:13] come out to examine the place there was
[1:26:15] nobody there each one of them testified
[1:26:17] the car chugged hit them hit the man he
[1:26:20] went up in the air everybody saw it
[1:26:21] Witness two or three car loads of them
[1:26:23] they seen it happen come to find out 5
[1:26:26] years ago there was an old man with an
[1:26:28] Overcoat hit uh uh uh killed on the same
[1:26:32] spot ain't that right so brother Brown
[1:26:35] said see what what it is when you leave
[1:26:37] here you're not dead you've got to come
[1:26:40] back even if you're a sinner and be
[1:26:43] judged according to the Deeds Done in
[1:26:45] the body ain't that right so whether
[1:26:48] sinner or Saint a man the physical death
[1:26:51] does not not annihilate uh uh uh the the
[1:26:55] the individual brother brandom or or not
[1:26:58] brother brandom but uh Revelations 20
[1:27:00] and 4 uh through five talks about a
[1:27:03] people reigning with Christ for a
[1:27:05] thousand years and and notice the fifth
[1:27:09] verse says but the rest of the Dead
[1:27:12] everybody say the rest of the Dead Liv
[1:27:14] not again see until the thousand years
[1:27:18] was finished so those that have died in
[1:27:21] the grave brother uh uh uh Revelation
[1:27:24] talks about the first resurrection and
[1:27:26] that that the first resurrection is
[1:27:28] those that have went that died in Christ
[1:27:32] and they rise ain't that right and the
[1:27:35] rest of the dead lives not for an A
[1:27:38] Thousand Years or until the thousand
[1:27:41] years was finished ain't that right see
[1:27:43] so again uh the physical death does not
[1:27:46] annihilate the believer nor does it The
[1:27:49] Sinner uh 1 Thessalonians 4:15 15 says
[1:27:53] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:27:54] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:27:57] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:27:59] not pre vent them which are
[1:28:02] asleep amen amen see for the Lord
[1:28:05] himself shall descend from heaven with
[1:28:07] the Shout with the voice of the
[1:28:08] Archangel with the Trump of God and the
[1:28:11] dead in Christ shall rise first ain't
[1:28:15] that right well the message teaches us
[1:28:17] they're not actually dead because they
[1:28:20] have eternal life
[1:28:22] so they're just
[1:28:24] asleep ain't that right they're just
[1:28:27] asleep amen see so then we which are
[1:28:31] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:28:33] together with the with them with those
[1:28:35] that are in the grave and they have
[1:28:38] risen we'll be caught up together with
[1:28:41] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[1:28:42] the air and so shall we ever be with the
[1:28:44] lord well where are we going to the
[1:28:47] wedding
[1:28:48] supper ain't that right now I'm just
[1:28:51] going be honest we're we're we're death
[1:28:54] does not separate us from
[1:28:57] God this death does not Anni us we will
[1:29:02] actually be with the Lord at the wedding
[1:29:06] supper I can't explain it all but I know
[1:29:09] I'm going to be there I know you're
[1:29:11] going to be
[1:29:13] there can you say amen that's why the
[1:29:16] prophet said we a Believer does not need
[1:29:18] to fear death that's let him threat let
[1:29:21] him do whatever let all the bombs come
[1:29:23] it does not matter when when when we
[1:29:25] leave here we're automatically within
[1:29:27] just a second or half second split
[1:29:30] whatever we're in the presence of
[1:29:32] God Lord amen now notice the wedding
[1:29:37] supper there we're going to be there and
[1:29:40] the tribulation is happening here on
[1:29:42] this Earth ain't that right then the
[1:29:45] Bible says we'll return We Will
[1:29:49] We those that were dead
[1:29:52] in the
[1:29:54] ground for how many years thousands one
[1:29:57] don't matter we will
[1:30:03] return for our
[1:30:05] honeymoon for a thousand years on this
[1:30:08] Earth that's right aren't you glad for
[1:30:11] that and the prophet said that pillar
[1:30:13] fire is here
[1:30:15] now leading us to our
[1:30:20] honeymoon
[1:30:22] that that death has no
[1:30:25] barrier the pillar of fire knows how to
[1:30:27] get us there and it's going to happen I
[1:30:31] don't care if you die tomorrow that
[1:30:33] Pillar of Fire will take you there you
[1:30:35] believed it am it's here now notice
[1:30:39] Malachi 4:3 and ye shall tread down the
[1:30:42] wicked for they shall be ashes Under The
[1:30:44] Souls of your feet in the day that I
[1:30:46] shall do this sayith the Lord of host
[1:30:49] talking about in this age brother Bram
[1:30:52] says it's in the Millennium we will walk
[1:30:54] on the ashes of the wicked showing that
[1:30:57] they're going to be dead ain't that
[1:30:59] right I don't I don't believe that we're
[1:31:00] going to be walking on piles of
[1:31:04] Ashes but what it is is the Earth is to
[1:31:07] be burnt with a fervent heat the prophet
[1:31:10] said he'll blow it to Pieces some of
[1:31:12] these days and he'll burst forth the
[1:31:14] Earth and she'll renew herself with
[1:31:18] volcanic eruption and there will come a
[1:31:21] m I there then where the righteous will
[1:31:25] walk out upon the ashes of the wicked
[1:31:27] see the whole earth is to be burnt over
[1:31:30] and he says in another place it's the
[1:31:32] way the world has a purifying itself
[1:31:35] again for the
[1:31:40] Millennium now he ain't going to take
[1:31:42] you to a just a junky
[1:31:45] Hotel amen that's right for your
[1:31:49] honeymoon is that right right
[1:31:55] amen you
[1:31:57] know we you know as we all do we talk
[1:32:01] sometimes the different ones whether
[1:32:03] they've already been married or getting
[1:32:05] ready to be married and talking about
[1:32:08] the wedding and talking about what
[1:32:09] they're going to do and you know and
[1:32:13] some you know you hear them say well if
[1:32:14] I had
[1:32:16] money if I had the money I would rather
[1:32:18] spend it on the honeymoon to go
[1:32:21] somewhere really nice then maybe the
[1:32:24] wedding you know all this you know spend
[1:32:27] if I if I had my options you know
[1:32:30] instead of spending it all on that
[1:32:31] wedding you know that's going to last
[1:32:33] for so much I'd rather put it on the
[1:32:35] honeymoon where we can go and enjoy a
[1:32:37] place you know and well you know and and
[1:32:40] that's everybody what everybody wants to
[1:32:42] do there and and all that but my point
[1:32:44] is there's that desire to you go
[1:32:47] somewhere in a to a nice place now if
[1:32:50] that's within the human being what do
[1:32:52] you think about
[1:32:54] God the god of
[1:32:56] Perfections the god of that
[1:32:59] has there is no Perfections like God has
[1:33:03] amen and his desire is perfect for you
[1:33:07] yeah if he's going to make a city
[1:33:09] perfect for you that's right then just
[1:33:12] imagine the honeymoon that he's got for
[1:33:14] us am it's going to be
[1:33:17] Flawless
[1:33:19] right now so so it's going to be
[1:33:21] beautiful place the prophet said and
[1:33:24] right now the whole world is in its
[1:33:26] birth pains she's travailing trying to
[1:33:30] bring forth a a new world for the
[1:33:34] Millennium now you think of that the

[1:34:12] world this Earth is groaning Amen to
[1:34:17] bring forth a millennium for you

[1:34:46] as Christians we are in travail because
[1:34:50] Christ is trying to bring bring forth a
[1:34:53] bride so the Earth is groaning all

[1:35:35] brother the earthquake burst open and
[1:35:37] the Stars Shake volcanics will come
[1:35:39] forth and the Earth will renew itself
[1:35:41] new lava will break forth from the
[1:35:43] center of the earth and she'll crumble
[1:35:45] all around and around and around when
[1:35:47] she spins out and Yonder and I tell you
[1:35:49] one morning when Jesus and his brother
[1:35:51] pride comes back to the Earth there will
[1:35:53] be a paradise of God and them old
[1:35:55] Warriors of the battle uh walk down
[1:35:58] there uh uh through there with their

[1:36:17] sin ain't that right amen it's going to
[1:36:20] be a beautiful place Hallelujah ain't
[1:36:24] that right Hallelujah so now now think
[1:36:27] of it while we're at the at
[1:36:31] the the wedding supper the tribulation
[1:36:34] is going on here under that Sixth Seal
[1:36:36] yeah and what is the Tribulation it's a
[1:36:39] time of
[1:36:41] purging
[1:36:43] purging the church is purged the prophet
[1:36:45] said Israel is purged everything is
[1:36:48] purged under that six seal so that the
[1:36:51] Millennium can start in it's all for
[1:36:55] you everything is for
[1:36:58] you there has to be a cleansing first
[1:37:01] sir see there is a whole earth is to be
[1:37:04] purged there will be such a thing that
[1:37:06] the moon the stars and all nature will
[1:37:08] be purged you see what it is the Earth
[1:37:10] is renewing herself being purged getting
[1:37:12] ready for the Millennium the
[1:37:14] millennium's coming up and everything's
[1:37:17] got that's got any filth in it is to be
[1:37:20] purged during the six
[1:37:22] seal then he says the Battle of
[1:37:24] armagedon will be the last of it when
[1:37:27] this whole world comes to the Battle of
[1:37:28] armagedon that'll settle the whole thing
[1:37:31] just before the great Millennium
[1:37:33] Armageddon is to clean off the Earth she
[1:37:36] P rep purifies herself with this Atomic
[1:37:39] blowing and the volcanic ash this and
[1:37:42] things sinks this soaked blood of men
[1:37:45] and upon the Earth and sin and crime she
[1:37:48] sinks beneath the earth and the volcanic
[1:37:50] briad raise out again and renews and
[1:37:53] cleans the Earth for the great
[1:37:55] Millennium he cleans his church during
[1:37:57] that time for a people to live here I
[1:38:00] say like that he say see there's coming
[1:38:02] a great time when it'll be great or
[1:38:04] there's coming a time when it'll be
[1:38:06] great ain't that right now still
[1:38:09] thinking of this second death and the
[1:38:12] first death you know Revelations 20 And1
[1:38:15] tells us where Satan will be during the
[1:38:17] time of
[1:38:18] Millennium and it says and I saw an
[1:38:21] Angel come down from heaven having the
[1:38:22] key of the bottomless pit and the great
[1:38:25] chain in his hand and he laid hold on
[1:38:28] the dragon that old serpent which is the
[1:38:30] devil and Satan and bound him a thousand
[1:38:33] years and cast him into the bottomless
[1:38:36] pit uh and shut him up and set a seal
[1:38:40] upon him that he should deceive the
[1:38:42] Nations no more till the Thousand Years
[1:38:45] shall be fulfilled so what what is this
[1:38:49] Thousand-Year millennium
[1:38:51] brother Bram said it's the Sabbath day
[1:38:53] when the church will not labor against
[1:38:56] sin no more amen is't that
[1:38:59] wonderful you've overcome thank you Lord
[1:39:03] you've
[1:39:04] endured you fought every devil in
[1:39:07] hell the devil has brought everything
[1:39:09] that he can against you and youve stood
[1:39:12] it he takes us home to a wedding
[1:39:17] supper and we come back to this earth
[1:39:21] it's cleaned off and now we're in a
[1:39:24] Sabbath for a thousand years where we
[1:39:27] don't have to labor against the
[1:39:30] sin
[1:39:31] hello and during this time Satan is
[1:39:34] bound by a chain brother brandham called
[1:39:37] this chain a not a natural chain not a
[1:39:40] log chain but a chain of
[1:39:43] circumstance ain't that right which
[1:39:46] means he says all of his subjects are in
[1:39:50] hand hell at that time and there's
[1:39:53] nothing for him to
[1:39:56] [Music]
[1:39:58] do there's
[1:40:00] nothing he's work he works in him right
[1:40:04] now he fulfills what he wants to do in
[1:40:07] them right
[1:40:09] now he makes them Little Devils right
[1:40:13] now but in that time in that Millennium
[1:40:17] all of his subjects will be
[1:40:19] gone and those that have
[1:40:23] overcome will have a Sabbath right where
[1:40:27] they don't have to war against sin no
[1:40:30] more can you say Amen now notice he says
[1:40:34] all that was resurrected on the earth
[1:40:37] the first resurrection was redeemed and
[1:40:41] Jesus with them so Satan could not work
[1:40:44] on
[1:40:47] anything he had his chance to work on
[1:40:49] you right right
[1:40:52] now
[1:40:54] hello but you're
[1:40:58] overcoming as I've said before this
[1:41:00] isn't this isn't we're not in the same
[1:41:03] condition like Eve was when she was
[1:41:06] tempted she didn't have no mind battles
[1:41:09] she didn't have sickness she didn't have
[1:41:11] pain she didn't have Agony she didn't
[1:41:14] have
[1:41:15] heartbreak she was in God's Eden amen
[1:41:18] and Satan tempted her and she fell for
[1:41:21] so God says okay you think that was easy
[1:41:23] you think you can do that all the time
[1:41:25] huh okay I'll just show you I allowed
[1:41:28] that to
[1:41:29] happen I'll put a people on the Earth in
[1:41:32] you're eating right yeah amen and I'll
[1:41:35] let you have control in every way you
[1:41:38] can every demon Unleashed on
[1:41:41] them I'll show you they'll still
[1:41:45] stand hello and you're
[1:41:49] standing and there's a millennium
[1:41:51] prepared for you and this Earth where
[1:41:55] the world doesn't know what's going on
[1:41:56] all nature is acting crazy it's in
[1:41:59] trevail to bring on a millennium for
[1:42:07] youus see in that time Satan ain't going
[1:42:10] to have no one to work on he's already
[1:42:12] tried his best with you and he couldn't
[1:42:13] do
[1:42:14] it so there comes a time that Satan says
[1:42:17] all right that's it it's done leave them
[1:42:20] alone prise Lord you're going to be on
[1:42:23] that honeymoon no mind battles then no
[1:42:26] pain no
[1:42:29] Agony no
[1:42:31] Temptations no discouragements amen no
[1:42:34] bad word spoken then no
[1:42:37] shunning no friends walking
[1:42:40] away
[1:42:45] hello see brother brand says see the
[1:42:47] lamb brings his church home his his
[1:42:51] subjects and cast his enemy into the
[1:42:53] Lake of Fire and all of his subjects go
[1:42:55] in there with him and that's it then we
[1:42:59] walk out in the Millennium prise the
[1:43:01] Lord I hope this all
[1:43:03] right so he says see Satan is helpless
[1:43:06] and hopeless just waiting for the
[1:43:10] resurrection of his
[1:43:12] subjects he can't do nothing with you
[1:43:16] but see I'm just trying to show you that
[1:43:18] physical death does not do away with
[1:43:21] sinner or
[1:43:25] Saint he said see then they're separated
[1:43:29] as the sheep from the goats not the
[1:43:32] bride that's right
[1:43:35] amen now if you look uh I I'll try to
[1:43:39] hurry Isaiah 11:6 the wolf shall also
[1:43:42] dwell with the lamb and the leopard
[1:43:45] shall lie down with the kid and the calf
[1:43:48] and the Young Lion and the fatling
[1:43:50] together
[1:43:51] and a little child shall lead them
[1:43:53] brother Brown says see that speaks of
[1:43:56] Innocence amen praise the Lord and the
[1:44:00] the cow and the bear shall feed their
[1:44:01] young one shall lie down together and
[1:44:03] the lion shall eat straw like the ox and
[1:44:07] the suckling child shall play on the
[1:44:09] hole of the ASP and the wing child shall
[1:44:12] put his hand on the cockatrice
[1:44:16] den and notice they shall not hurt nor
[1:44:19] destroy in all my holy Mountain for the
[1:44:21] Earth shall be full of the knowledge of
[1:44:23] the Lord as the waters cover the sea am
[1:44:26] is that right so then we know that the
[1:44:28] rest of the Dead are
[1:44:31] resurrected after this 1,000 years and
[1:44:34] this is the second
[1:44:37] Resurrection so the the first death is
[1:44:40] not the final
[1:44:41] thing Revelations 20 and 7 and when the
[1:44:46] thousand years are expired Satan shall
[1:44:48] be loosed out of his prison and shall go
[1:44:50] out to to deceive the
[1:44:51] Nations see which are in the four
[1:44:53] quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to
[1:44:56] gather them together to battle so now
[1:44:58] he's got someone to work with again and
[1:45:01] the number of whom is as the sand of the
[1:45:03] sea ain't that right so notice brother
[1:45:06] Braham said in this second Resurrection
[1:45:08] when they come up then Satan's loosed
[1:45:10] out of his prison for a little season
[1:45:12] then the judgment is set see watch Jesus
[1:45:15] with the bride as king and queen set at
[1:45:18] the throne white throne judgement
[1:45:21] they're not standing Before the Throne
[1:45:24] they're sitting on the throne they have
[1:45:30] overcome and the books were open and the
[1:45:33] books of the Sinners and another book
[1:45:34] was open which was the book of life and
[1:45:36] every man was judged thus by the
[1:45:41] bride amen by the bride that's
[1:45:45] right praise the Lord don't think that
[1:45:47] your your overcoming is not noticed by
[1:45:52] God Amen prise the Lord so when The
[1:45:55] Sinner
[1:45:58] dies in closing now when The Sinner dies
[1:46:01] he is
[1:46:03] finished because he cannot
[1:46:06] repent there's no chance to repent amen
[1:46:11] for the Deeds that he's done here in
[1:46:13] this
[1:46:14] life then his soul will eventually go
[1:46:18] out of existence because he had not
[1:46:21] eternal life right can you say Amen I'd
[1:46:25] like to get into it later on but there
[1:46:28] is no such thing as the prophet said as
[1:46:30] eternal hell ain't that
[1:46:33] right there's no such thing as anyone
[1:46:37] who doesn't have eternal life here on in
[1:46:41] this
[1:46:42] life living
[1:46:45] eternally in that other
[1:46:48] life eternal life getting having eternal
[1:46:52] life is so
[1:46:54] important to have eternal life now amen
[1:46:58] ain't that right amen so the sinner will
[1:47:00] not burn in hell eternally because he
[1:47:02] doesn't have eternal life and we all
[1:47:05] know that there's no other source of
[1:47:06] eternal life than God ain't that right
[1:47:10] so then to have eternal life is to have
[1:47:12] God himself living inside of you
[1:47:15] quickening the word seed amen that that
[1:47:18] he put within you so then the The Sinner
[1:47:21] they'll they they'll be punished and and
[1:47:25] brother Brown said it it could be
[1:47:26] billions of years that that they are
[1:47:30] punished for their deeds and and these
[1:47:32] things it could be a thousand it could
[1:47:34] be hundreds it whatever it will be but
[1:47:37] then there comes a time that he is no
[1:47:41] more that's the second death because
[1:47:44] he's brought to a total Annihilation
[1:47:47] amen ain't that right so you you can see
[1:47:51] why Satan fights the new
[1:47:54] birth he has fought this message with
[1:47:57] all that's with in him because we
[1:48:00] realize that it wasn't just a man
[1:48:02] bringing a message brother brandham said
[1:48:05] it's the Dynamics the quickening power
[1:48:07] that has come to
[1:48:09] us that's right ain't that right God
[1:48:13] quickening the soul God God bringing a
[1:48:16] quickening power and so this is why he
[1:48:19] would get subtract uh not subtracted but
[1:48:23] uh subra anyways get us uh somewhere
[1:48:28] else besides the word of God
[1:48:32] sidetracked uh because uh um uh he
[1:48:36] doesn't want us coming to a new
[1:48:39] birth and if you build your life upon
[1:48:44] emotions that's not the new birth and
[1:48:46] this is why I again I think God for a
[1:48:51] prophet because man he he he dice I mean
[1:48:54] he got a he got that sharp sword and he
[1:48:57] started dissecting everything I mean he
[1:48:59] just started whipping away everything
[1:49:01] cutting away from that new birth so that
[1:49:03] we could truly see a new birth and what
[1:49:05] it means and what it is to
[1:49:08] us it's not about speaking in tongues
[1:49:10] that makes a new birth it it's it's not
[1:49:13] about you know saying God sent a prophet
[1:49:15] that makes a new birth it it it's it's
[1:49:18] not about you know being anointed to
[1:49:20] sing and to write songs and and to
[1:49:22] preach even that that makes a new birth
[1:49:26] hello see so so we as message Believers
[1:49:30] we we have a solid a solid concrete
[1:49:34] evidence of a new
[1:49:37] birth thank God aren't you glad for that
[1:49:40] yes thank the
[1:49:42] Lord amen
[1:49:45] now brother brandham would say and and
[1:49:49] as the musician come thank you for your
[1:49:52] patience but he said why will this
[1:49:54] Overcomer this believer escape and go
[1:49:56] into the rims of eternal life and Bliss
[1:49:59] because Jesus paid a price sir to Ransom
[1:50:03] us from sin he filled the gap of
[1:50:06] separation and we who were afar off are
[1:50:10] now made nigh by the blood and they will
[1:50:13] never come into condemnation they will
[1:50:15] never be in that Lake of Fire they can
[1:50:18] never be lost for he will lose none of
[1:50:22] them not one of the redeemed will be
[1:50:26] anywhere except where Jesus is can you
[1:50:30] say
[1:50:32] Amen the second death hath no power over
[1:50:37] us
[1:50:38] amen Lord do you love him thank you Lord
[1:50:43] you can see why Satan does his best to
[1:50:45] convince us that God doesn't love us
[1:50:47] anymore that he's forsaken us you can
[1:50:50] see why Satan is doing his best to
[1:50:52] convince us that what we're believing in
[1:50:53] is is just fraud it's fake it's there's
[1:50:56] no reality to
[1:50:58] it you can see why he's doing his best
[1:51:00] to get us separ you know get us looking
[1:51:02] off in other things the world
[1:51:04] entertainment and getting our mind so
[1:51:06] wrapped up on on on the phones and
[1:51:09] Facebook YouTube and and Instagram all
[1:51:12] them others that are out there he's
[1:51:14] doing his best to Sidetrack us from
[1:51:16] everything but you got to overcome you
[1:51:19] got to overcome sir you might be getting
[1:51:21] weary but overcome you're going to
[1:51:23] overcome you're called to it he's with
[1:51:29] you you see the purpose of him bringing
[1:51:31] you to the message of the hour not for
[1:51:33] you to be a lukewarm lay osia but to
[1:51:36] chop you out Hallelujah so you can stand
[1:51:39] out and
[1:51:41] overcome brother BR Mory told us it's
[1:51:43] not the age that is overcoming it's the
[1:51:45] individual that
[1:51:46] overcomes so everyone that's going to
[1:51:48] overcome you you might might be standing
[1:51:50] among your friends and you be the only
[1:51:52] Overcomer you might be the only one that
[1:51:54] says no I don't want to do that I'm I'm
[1:51:56] I'm overcoming and you may not even be
[1:51:59] able to explain why but that seeds down
[1:52:01] inside of you pressing pushing doing
[1:52:04] everything it can to express every
[1:52:07] promise that God has called you for it's
[1:52:10] already in the
[1:52:13] seed it's already in the sea amen amen
[1:52:17] you love
[1:52:18] him why why do you want to overcome and
[1:52:20] no one else does why do you want to
[1:52:22] serve the Lord and no one else
[1:52:25] does why is it that you want to quit the
[1:52:27] things of the world and all your friends
[1:52:29] just don't
[1:52:31] understand because God is calling the
[1:52:33] individual to overcome it's not a party
[1:52:36] thing it's not a club thing it's not a
[1:52:38] group thing the only thing that you need
[1:52:41] to be identified is with the Jesus
[1:52:43] Christ and his
[1:52:45] church cuz he's in his
[1:52:48] church
[1:52:51] that's you love him it ain't a certain
[1:52:55] building that's right that we're
[1:52:56] identified with it's not a certain
[1:52:59] preacher that we're identified
[1:53:01] with it's the Holy Ghost identifying
[1:53:04] himself with us we're identifying with
[1:53:06] the word of the age and the word is
[1:53:09] manifesting itself through us you
[1:53:13] see as I've I've I've told them these
[1:53:16] young ministers back there I said you
[1:53:18] can either be a med yre
[1:53:21] preacher or you can be a full-fledged
[1:53:24] Minister where God anoints you to where
[1:53:27] when you get up and preach the anointing
[1:53:29] is behind
[1:53:31] you you can do whatever you want to do
[1:53:33] God's called you to preach it's whatever
[1:53:36] you want to be you can go out there and
[1:53:38] keep your nose in the in the movies and
[1:53:41] and and just live old life and and then
[1:53:43] only study when when when you're called
[1:53:46] to preach on called on to preach or you
[1:53:49] can prepare your life and and be ready
[1:53:53] live consecrated to God you understand
[1:53:56] what I'm saying you see and and that's
[1:53:59] the same thing with all of us here we
[1:54:02] can either be mediocre church
[1:54:06] members or we can be what God wants us
[1:54:09] to be and that is that
[1:54:11] Overcomer that stands up not because we
[1:54:14] want to be different because God made us
[1:54:18] different that's God to where the power
[1:54:21] of God is flowing through our lives to
[1:54:24] where we see God just moving and working
[1:54:27] we see the Vindication of
[1:54:29] God can you say
[1:54:32] Amen overcoming that's right
[1:54:36] overcoming that means
