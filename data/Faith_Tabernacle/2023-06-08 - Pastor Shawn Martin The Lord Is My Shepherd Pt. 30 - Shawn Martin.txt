anoint me as the speaker and anoint the hearer as well father and May the troubled May those that are sick May those that are discouraged may they find what they're looking for father and Lord we just ask and we commit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen Psalms the 23rd chapter going to read the first verse starting there the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen you can have your seats this evening we had wonderful Services last Sunday and brother Andrew just did a wonderful job and and dealing with the fact that he is here Christ is here and he's on schedule and I thought both sermons were a masterpiece and um I'll tell you what it's it's good to know that he is here with us amen and I think this is what David was saying there thou art with me I will fear no evil for thou art with me but looking at this this this old chapter of Psalms 23 it deals of course with the Lord being Our Shepherd and we being his sheep and one would think that um maybe it would be a slap in God's face to be called a Shepherd someone to identify him as a shepherd and as the way brother Branham tells us is that a Shepherd was the most illiterate uh person of all people in in because he didn't know anything but his sheep uh and so he didn't need to to know the you know mathematics he didn't need to know the science he didn't he needed didn't need to be trained in education all he needed to know was how to call his sheep and this is why God notified the Shepherds there when Jesus was born of course he was born being the Lamb of God born in a stable where Lambs I guess were should be born and and yet God would notify the Shepherds he bypassed the educated he bypassed the the clergyman the prophet would say the Churchman he bypassed the teachers who had theological training and he really Brown said all the learning and money that they spent on all the missionaries and all the prosely lighting and all the memberships and everything that they had done to honor God yet the key message bypassed them said God in his wisdom passed up all the importance of the Land There were important people great teachers Caiaphas the high priest and many other great men all Israel's Mighty learned all the denominations and all the boasting theologians and yet God passed all of them and then brother Brown says it showed that they were trained in the wrong field they they should have been trained on how to recognize sheep they should have been trained on how to to identify and so God gave the greatest message to the most illiterate men and that was the Shepherds says the highest Heavens hastening to honor Earth's most humble and unlearned the highest of Heaven came down to make himself known to the lowest of the earth bypassing all between to make himself known to Common herdsmen and so all of the learning and all of men's wisdom and all of their education and all their their their things was laid to waste right then it was at that time that God when he bypassed it all he showed that none of that mattered because he gave the greatest message to Shepherds and God knew that they would receive the message and the message was Messiah is on earth now ain't that right and so he knew that they would receive it but then brother Brown goes on talking about Shepherds and we've read it before but he says the shepherd stays with the Sheep so much till he even laughs like the Sheep bleeding see he talks like the Sheep he smells like the Sheep that's right because he's with the Sheep that's all he knows is his sheep ain't that rhyme so here David is saying that the Lord is my shepherd and so the Lord is the great Shepherd and and he knows nothing but his sheep ain't that right he knows nothing and we know that he wrote each name of his sheep on the Lamb's Book of Life and his his whole focus is is them sheep that's right and John 10 27 Jesus says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand ain't that right and he says my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand and I and my father are one so he goes on in Matthew 7 22 Jesus would say many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then I will profess unto them I never knew you amen that that knowledge uh so now we know that the knowledge isn't isn't brain knowledge it's an intimate knowledge I never had that intimate relationship with you depart from me ye that work iniquity ain't that right so it's a knowledge that grows goes into a relationship and and these things so the Lord being the shepherd He has a personal knowledge of his sheep he's he he's known of his sheep and he knows his sheep a man and so when he was on Earth he he he he he he didn't just wonder about trying to find out who would accept him he was after his sheep ain't that right and he's still after his sheep today amen but in studying the the 23rd chapter here of Psalms I I have found that it this this this chapter deals with Redemption our Redemption it deals with our restoration throughout the the the the Bible the the message of redemption has been given by Shepherds and through sheep Shepherds and sheep have represented Redemption and so it it and of course it all speaks of the uh the great Shepherd and and the true Lamb of God and and so God revealed himself by Shepherds and through sheep and so from the beginning uh of time I guess or or since the fall uh uh Redemption uh has been by sheep we find that Adam and Eve after they hit sin uh uh they couldn't come into the presence of God uh they they needed something Adam had hid from the presence of God but God wanted them to stand there in his presence and so there there come uh we find that Adam and Eve was standing in the presence of God to hear his message to them uh having been clothed a man with sheepskin ain't that right they they were draped uh uh with uh skins and the prophet said the first message that was given to a condemned generation was over the top of a dead sheepskin that God himself had slain and wrapped around Adam and Eve ain't that right so we we find of course that Adam and Eve had tried to make a covering for themselves and it and it didn't work and and so we must use what God has provided in order for us to stand in his presence or you'll never get anywhere with God in in that way it takes the way that God has provided ain't that right and from the very beginning God instituted a sheep sacrifice a man even Before Time When God drew his program out in his mind and spoke it before the foundation of the world Christ the lamb the true lamb was slain right then so God had already had in his mind it would be a lamb and it would be an atonement a man for the sins of man and and yet it would take it would be 4 000 years or so later that the the I am Christ would actually be slain but God had ordained that the blood of the Lamb which was Christ was what would provide the atonement ain't that right we find that that the whole the whole theme of the Old Testament was built around the coming Messiah brother Branham says the motives and the objectives of the whole Old Testament prophets them men had one objective and that was Jesus Christ ain't that right amen of since the beginning it was all speaking of Christ amen even before the foundation of the world God had Christ in his mind as as an atonement brother Brown says they did not go out and do things just for money or for fame they had one thing and they were Anointed with the spirit of God and they predicted the coming Messiah and those men were so Anointed with the spirit until they sometimes acted like the spirit that was within them they spoke seemingly of themselves so common born men and yet their Ministry spoke of the coming of of the of of of of Christ their their their prophecy spoke of the coming of Christ the very lives and the actions spoke of the coming of Christ can you say Amen the great Shepherd and and so uh uh prophets and they they in the Old Testament were usually herdsmen Shepherds uh uh Abraham Isaac David Moses uh Jacob and and so on uh they they were prophets and yet they were they were shepherds and and so uh but their lives in they reflected the Good Shepherd uh which was Jesus Christ a man uh Peter called Christ the good or the chief Shepherd amen Paul would declare that he is the shepherd and Bishop of our souls ain't that rhyme so then the prophets as Shepherds spoke of of of the the the great Shepherd that would become and and they clothed themselves in sheepskin amen the prophets did they they clothed themselves in sheepskin they wore the prophet said they Ward the skin of the sheep they were hurting which signified that their faith was in his word of the coming perfect lamb now think of that the prophets amen the word come to the prophet so they knew that the lamb would come and even though they were hurting these sheep uh the natural sheep yet they would wear that that sheep's skin amen as a testament that my faith is in the true Lamb of God that was to come we know that sheep have to be guided in sheep is totally helpless without the shepherd Amen to guide it it cannot go itself and and so brother Brown said that's the reason God likened his believing children unto sheep they've got to be guided but watch what's guiding you don't get a goal he'll walk you to the slaughter pin God never gave us a goal he gave us his son the holy spirit to guide us he is our God not some man-made herdsmen but a god-given herdsman who feed the sheep leap upon sheep food ain't that right we find about sheep it they have to have a certain diet because that's their nature uh uh and and the prophet would tell us that sheep food is the word of God a man for the age ain't that right Jesus the Lamb of God even declared my meat is to do the will of him that sent me so that was his food was to do the will of the father a man that sent him and that's the only diet that that any of God's sheep will feed on a man is the will of the father ain't that right and his word is his will do you believe that his word is his will doves also have to have a particular diet they just can't can't feed off of everything and or anything and and of course Dove represents the the Holy Ghost and and and and uh uh it's their nature they they have to have a certain diet but a crow people can eat on anything and and the prophet called him a hypocrite he said he's the biggest hit the hypocrite there is because he's a vulture he's a scavenger he can sit out there and eat on a dead horse all day and fly out there in the field and eat grain with the dove see he said you you you you give a sheep or a dove something contrary to the word of God he cannot stand it but the devil can take the word of take can take the word and the world too and call them both of God see amen see because his his nature see so so when David is saying the Lord is my shepherd amen there's a lot that is being said there a man between the lines ain't that right now Jesus said my sheep know my voice and another they will not follow and his voice is his word do you believe that his voice is his word and the word comes to the the prophets and and so they were the voice of God to the people that they were sent to amen and so brother Branham would call them Shepherd prophets amen they were Shepherd prophets and uh uh uh uh and and and he would tell us that that prophets Shepherds and sheep they all testify of the coming of of Messiah the coming of Christ it all testifies a man so so it gives us a deeper meaning when we're when we're reading uh in in these in in this chapter a man and God is reflected a man in the prophets God's reflected in the in the Shepherds God's reflected in the Sheep ain't that right a man see and we find that in the Old Testament it was through and by the Shepherds that God did Shepherd his Sheep amen uh I I for example um Exodus 3 and 7 and uh it says and the Lord said and he's talking to Moses now he says I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians to bring them up out of that land unto a good land a and a large and to a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites the Hittites amorites parasites hivites and jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou may bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt ain't that right so God would would send his Shepherd Prophet down to Egypt with a message amen and through him God was going to deliver his people out of the out of the land to bondage ain't that right now now Moses it's amazing but Moses is a type of Christ you know everything that brother Brown said Moses typed Christ perfectly he was born under persecution Jesus was born under persecution the devil was trying to catch Moses and he was trying to catch Jesus Moses was a servant and a deliverer Jesus was the great servant and deliverer Moses was a lawgiver and priest Jesus was the law giver and priest so he was everything that Christ was ain't that right amen just a common born man but yet God would reflect himself through that Prophet shepherd shepherd prophecy and so uh we we find that when God gave Moses a the commission a man after burning bush he uh there was no one on that mountain but but Jehovah and Moses and and notice Exodus 4 and 6 the Lord said furthermore unto him but now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow ain't that right now the Bible doesn't tell us what what hand uh Moses used but the prophet did and he said it was his right hand amen it was his right hand and there was a reason for it a man and and that's because that Moses was representing God now you think of that Moses was representing God God was in Moses ain't that right amen now now think of this because here God was going to show a man himself to be the shepherd a man through that Prophet Moses now see and so we find that Moses put his hand his right hand over his heart in in his bosom there where the hidden secrets of redemption had been laying a man since the foundation of the world ain't that right amen see and and we know a man that God has a right hand a man so here was Moses putting his right hand in his bosom a man as a as a sign a man that God has a right hand and and and the prophet said Jesus is the right hand of God Amen and he's hovering over God's heart ain't that right he was hid in the bosom of God Amen see and so here Moses was portraying uh uh exactly see and and so then we find that Jesus Jesus held the secrets of the father and has now showed them unto us amen say so we find that Moses put his right hand in over his heart in his books of man and when he pulled it out that his right hand out and and exposed it we could say it that way revealed it it was white as leprosy ain't that right white as snow it was leprosy ain't that right but God was going to show what he would do to his own right hand amen see leprosy represents sin ain't that right amen it represents sin amen and and but yet this leprosy amen was a different leprosy because it was in the last stages a man of leprosy which is incurable amen the prophet said it was an incurable thing that that that no doctor no no preacher no Theologian no nothing a man could cure amen this leprosy ain't that right amen saying soap his hand was smitten with a horrible thing because it was it was the leprosy was white as snow a man the prophet said and that's where the world was when God pulled his right hand from his own bosom amen the world was full of leprosy in such a way that there was nothing that could cure the sin of the world ain't that right amen there was nothing that could hear it see the world was smitten with deadly leprosy and there was no cure at all for it and if you notice the prophet said the leprosy didn't come on just gradually amen it was an instant thing when he put his hand in his wisdom and pulled it out amen it was it was automatically in the stage four or the last stage of leprosy and he said that is the way the sin was when God told Adam and Eve the day you do it the day you partake of is the day that you're going to die can you say Amen so we find that God representing himself Amen in the prophet Moses that Prophet Shepherd amen now we find that Moses smote himself amen no one else got his right hand and stuck it in his bosom a man Moses took his own right hand and stuck it in his bosom ain't that right amen by the Commandment of God he put his own right hand into his bosom and pulled it out and it was smitten with Leprosy amen but showing what Jesus the great Shepherd amen would do for us can you say amen that's right see Jesus said in John 18 no man taketh my life from me I lay it down of myself can you say Amen so he was the great Shepherd ain't that right he the great shepherd He took our guilt he took our sin amen and smote himself he took our sins and laid it upon himself as Isaiah said he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we are healed ain't that right you know the prophet said the secret of God's healing of redemption laid in the bosom of God it was there in the bosom of God that's right see amen the secret had been in God's bosom all these years covered by his right hand Jesus Christ amen but if you notice a man the leprosy left just as quickly as it came a man for when Moses put it back in return the right hand his right hand back into his bosom and pulled it out it was clean amen there was no leprosy ain't that right amen see so we find that that when our great Shepherd hung on Calvary he said the greatest words that you could ever hear it is finished see it wasn't a gradual thing it was a instant thing amen that sin Was Defeated right there sickness Was Defeated right there amen trouble Was Defeated right there can you say amen he conquered it's not a gradually conquering amen God ain't gradually Conquering the devil you're fighting a defeated enemy because of Calvary of 2000 years ago can you say Amen that's right sin was over the penalty was paid the debts were settled the prophet said it didn't take a year it was finished right then amen the Believers whose names were written in the land in The Book of Life predestinated from the foundation of the world it was finished everybody say it was finished to the believer it was finished Amen to every one of God's sheep it was finished my God would take a Shepherd Prophet to show what he would do through his amen through his own self can you say amen amen he would take that great nor that Shepherd Prophet amen and have him to pull a sign out to show what he would do when he would reveal his own right hand it redeemed the Sheep those whose names were written in the Book of Life Lamb's Book of Life predestinated from the world it was finished that very minute that Jesus said it was finished can you say Amen see God's right hand was pulled from his bosom and was smitten but then we find that on Easter God raised his right hand and returned it back to his bosom can you say Amen it returned back to his bosom oh my amen so God was showing what he would do in time amen through Moses of what he would do amen now it was being fulfilled God returning his right hand back into his bosom amen and then what does he do the prophet said he pulled his right hand out again and it extended to you and I but it isn't full of leprosy it's clean can you say amen that's right he extended it down to you and I in the form of his word why why would he do that to redeem us back Amen to the original position that we fell from in the garden amen so now the hidden secret of his great heart was revealed by a prophet Shepherd ain't that right yes sir so if you notice when David said he writes about the Lord being a shepherd then he he says thy right Thy Thy staff and I rod they comfort me the shepherd must have a rod a staff because he Shepherds his sheep with it ain't that right so it's only natural for David to to talk about the the the rod and the staff if he's talking about the shepherd but see I I don't believe that David was talking about something natural because he says thy rod and thy staff they comfort me David was UN finding comfort in some natural stick is that right but I believe he was looking at something that had been promised to come David being a Shepherd prophet the word came to him and he saw something greater than just an old stick you know I believe he was one of those that Paul spoke of in in Hebrews 11 13 these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and you say man I think what David was talking about here Isaiah begins to speak about it and says in in Isaiah 11 and 1 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him what speaking of Christ can you say Amen so David is a speaking of just something a man but he's speaking of a person thy wrought and thy staff they comfort me and you say Amen maybe the natural sheep found comfort in that in the in the stick in the natural stick but David saw something greater he was the Sheep but the Lord was his Shepherd he meant something greater than a stick that we find here that he found the comfort and notice he's speaking of the person of Christ because John 14 16 says and I will pray the father and he shall give you what another comforter now I'm just going to say it and you you Jacob take it however you want to but I believe that's what David was talking about hello David was seeing the comforter as a rod and staff can you say Amen Jesus is saying but it's the Holy Spirit that I will send unto you as a comforter that he may abide with you forever even everybody say even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not and neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you so he is that comforter he is that rod and you say man so Christ is our comforter he is the spirit of truth that has come in this day so thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now I want to again and I'm not going to keep you much longer but I I want to again refer to the prophet Shepherd Moses see God came down to deliver his people and to lead them out of in out of bondage into the land of promise but he used Moses to work through which was the type of Christ but he also used his rod to work through which was also a type of Christ Moses didn't have an army to use he didn't have the backing of Nations he didn't have a military weapons all he had was robbed all he had was a stick that God was going to use him that Prophet Shepherd and a stick to go deliver his people and not just to deliver them but to Shepherd them to the promised land is that right God's going to use that Rod to symbolize the great rod now Exodus 4 and 1 and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the Lord hath not appeared unto thee now I want you to look at that now and I wish wished I had time and and things to go through it thank you uh now Moses is questioning here okay so I'm gonna go tell them but they're going to tell me that you're crazy Moses right the Lord hath not appeared unto thee so now Moses is looking for vindication I need something to vindicate what I'm going to say I need Vindication to my message I need Vindication to my calling I need Vindication Amen to the commission ain't that right and the Lord said unto him what is in thine hand and he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground now you know what the prophet said it wasn't good in Moses's hand he had to let it go and when he let it go it becoming God's hands cast it to the ground and it became a serpent now I I wish we'll get more into it hopefully Lord willing and Moses fled from it from before it and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand now now now now Moses was not performing magicians Magic God was in that rod that Rod was speaking of another Rod to come and you say man now see the prophet said the power laid in the rod amen now look Exodus 4 17 God said to him Thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith Thou shalt do signs ain't that right don't forget the rod Moses because that's what you're going to do signs with don't don't forget to take it and don't you just look at it as just some old stick that's what's going to be your your vindication ain't that right Exodus 7 and 8 and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying now see they're already down into Egypt when Pharaoh shall speak unto you saying show a miracle uh for you then Thou shalt sand there and take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent and Moses and Aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did as so as the Lord had commanded and Aaron cast down his Rod before pharaoh and before servants and it became a serpent ain't that right in Exodus 7 17 God says I will Smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood Exodus 8 and 5 the Lord spake unto Moses saying to Aaron stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams over the rivers over the ponds and calls frogs to come up upon the land of the Egypt and Aaron stretched out his hand over the Waters of Egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt Exodus 8 and 16 and the Lord said to Moses say unto Aaron stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the lamb and then become lice throughout all the land of Egypt and they did so see and and for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth and it become lice in man and in Beast all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt my God showing what a rod will do can you say Amen that's right see you see the Holy Ghost is the power of God that's been given to the church do you believe that you know what the prophet said if those Egyptians could have gotten that Rod out of Moses's hand out of his possession they would have whipped him but as long as Moses had that Rod there was a supernatural Vindication with him that's right you know what else the prophet said he says what that stick was in the hand of Moses the same is the name of Jesus to the church can you say Amen where you can say get away from there and it's gone ain't that right see so Mark 16 17 Jesus said and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what is it it's the name of Jesus amen he says if the church will hold that name of Jesus East esteem it and honor it and quit using it in slang and so forth and use it in power and reverence it'll conquer every enemy that God's God on the Earth my the rod I Rod thy staff they comfort me you see Moses with that Rod changed all nature he changed nature Prophet said he did it to make it work for him why it was time for deliverance and the people began to see the supernatural that was with Moses everything he did was with that rod ain't that right he took that rod with him when they went out into the wilderness when he got up to that Red Sea the Egyptian Army behind them it looked like they were trapped it'll look like God had led him into a death trap but God didn't forget the rod and when Moses Cried unto God God said what is it in your hand stretch it forth and when Moses stretched that Rod forth the waters opened up and they walked on dry ground brother Brown said that that Rod was a judgment rod to Egypt ain't that right so he said see look at that Shepherd's gold that staff that Rod making a way for them to go that stick was in the shepherd's hand it bypassed every bit of Theology and all the things the priesthood said and that Shepherd's Rod LED them right down through every impossible thing known to man it was the rot ain't that right when Pharaoh tried to think that the cataracts erupted in the mountains and throw the water and then made it turn into blood see that was that was Pharaoh's thinking he was using the science and the reasoning and all that oh that wasn't really a trick there or Supernatural it was this and this and this just like people try to explain Miracles today you can explain miracles God just does it so here he is trying to explain these things and then the prophet said then God rained fire out of heaven gonna shut that reasoning up and then he reigned hell out of Heaven he reigned lice upon the Earth and everything else and he did it by the shepherd's staff not my textbook not by theologians idea but by Shepherd's staff he said it was a shepherd's Rod guiding his sheep making the way clear as they went towards the promised word in the land what a beautiful thing that is today of the shepherd's staff today guiding a sheep to the promised land bypassing all Theology and everything else of this world and the things of the world and the denominations and everything opening up the way aren't you glad God's still opening up the way amen when it looks like you're trapped when it looks like you've done everything you can and the enemy's going to swallow you up God still has a rod in this day to open the way for his people he's opening up the way and proving his word to be the truth see it's the shepherd's staff going ahead and he delivered the people out of Egypt with the staff in his hand and he guided the Sheep to the promised land and sent judgment Amen to the land that they left see that Rod was used as a vindication the Moses message of Deliverance God made his presence known by that rod can you say Amen showing that it wasn't just a man coming another preacher another another teacher another Theologian another goofball another you understand another Jim Jones or another uh uh David whatever that was out in uh uh you know all of these things yet God would prove to the people that his message was sent from God can you say amen amen see and he came he came see now now Church in this age we know it and and so so sometimes we just let it let it let it become common but God not only sent us a prophet to restore us back to what was in the beginning but he has come himself as the Vindication of what the prophet said to be the truth can you say Amen and if I can say it this way he the rod he the shepherd staff oh yeah he can become all things hitting the all things in all things he has the preeminence ain't that right he's the shepherd he's the lamb he's the staff he's the priest he's the rod he's everything that you need can you say Amen now notice he's come himself in this day and this means something to us because you know I um just thinking is stalking you know um some of you young people you may get out into work and it's out there in the work Workforce that you you begin to realize that not everybody believes the message and they've got all kinds of ideas thoughts one was telling my daughter the other day that that there were giants in the land or Giants way before Adam and Eve and he began to tell how all the things that he's been studying the books and this and that and said what books do you read said well we followed the message William Branham but see there's there's so much eagerness to learn no doubt that they they're good Christian they they is what they know they they love God in in their own way but that's not what's going to take a rapture and and and so but but I I was I was talking to her and I said but aren't you glad that in the middle of all these questions and everybody's question the questioning about their Holiness questioning about their long hair or questioning about you know why are you wearing your skirts and well I don't believe it's this way and I don't think it's this way and everybody's got their own answers but but but you know when it all comes down to it there's got to be one answer that's right and everything else is wrong ain't that right and yet I'll do all the reading and all these things we're still not searching we're we we you know there are people that give their lifetime of of searching and theologies and and one Seminary and book after book after book church after church after church going from this and this and this and yet they're still searching but we have found something that we have stopped searching it's been a message but it's not just a man with a message writing another book it's been a God that has come as the rod and staff and Vindicated it the supernatural has come in this age and you say Amen I hope that's all right but see there cannot be the prophet said there cannot be the presence of God without Supernatural things happening never did Jehovah appear without the supernatural following him it has to be he's always have Vindicated himself that he was with these prophets by confirming that what they were prophecy prophesying of if it was according to his word can you say Amen so we have seen that this message is according to the word by the Vindication of God night after night day after day God is so Vindicated this message to take away all of our questions amen and if you notice David said that he's walking in the Valley of the shadow of death so he's not referring to the Millennium this isn't all going up when we get to the Millennium it's talking about now it's talking about the time amen present that that light and darknesses Associate together our presence sickness and health are present battles and victories are present all of these things are present and yet David would declare yet I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me no questions I hope it's making sense to you today no questions if we're not if we're going to make it we're going to make it no questions if I'm going to be destroyed in the in the trial there's no questions can you say Amen there's no questions whether I'm going to make it or not there's no questions why his staff and his Rod is here and it comforts me I see God Vindicated I see the Vindication of God that lets me know his presence is here can you say Amen I believe that this chapter you know this is just my thoughts I believe this chapter is is prophetic for our day in which we live we are living in the most evil age there ever was brother Branham describes this age as being real religious but Lawless not only lawless when it comes to Natural laws of the land but Lawless to God's Own laws women trying to be men men becoming more like women that you know and and women dressing like men act like men talking like men you know and all these things are getting away from the home life and and going to work like men and men are becoming more and more sissified and and and surrendering their position in the home and and and they they don't know how to leave they don't have no headship and see these are laws of God that God has placed can you say Amen he's placed laws in the Church of how a church should function and he's placed laws in the in in the land that all of these things but look at it even the laws of nature is getting all messed up ain't that right now if you notice we've read this before but Luke 21 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexities the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear is that not the day we're living in you know it is that that is prophecy of your day young people this day you could say this day this scripture is fulfilled you're not living in the age of your ancestors where they didn't know what this meant and looking for a day you're living in that day men's hearts are failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming upon the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken ain't that right but in the middle of it David says I will fear no evil for thou art with me oh my David has been confirmed or the presence of the Lord has been confirmed to David that he's there amen with him can you say amen and I believe as it was speaking of our day so is it now that the presence of God even though that was spoken as a prophetic I believe it is now that the presence of God has been confirmed amen that he's here with us I will fear no evil everybody say I will fear no evil I will fear no evil there's a generation whose heart is failing them for fear amen but I will fear no evil I'm living in the Valley of the shadow of death I'm living in the time amen where men's hearts are failing them amen for their fear of looking after the things that's coming what is coming tribulations coming God's Wrath is fixing to be poured out the plagues are being poured out but I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me [Music] that's right see knowing the Lord Is With Us takes away all fear why because we are his responsibility we're his sheep he's a shepherd we are his responsibility so he is our provider he is our sustainer our healer our refuge our peace ain't that right Luke 12 6 are not five sparrows Jesus saying the great Shepherd now listen he's saying are not five sparrows sold for too far farthings and not one of them is forgetting forgotten before God but even but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered do you realize that every time you lose your hair I hadn't lost much bro Junior amen but but any anytime you lose your hair they're numbered God knows that where they're at and the prophet already made the Declaration I've not lost to one can you say Amen wherever they went to they'll come back I'm going there ain't that right so he says see the even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows Luke 21 17 and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but there shall not be and hair of your hair head perish ain't that right so you know what that means to for us they can burn them to the stake bet your hair a hair of your head ain't gonna perish you can be put back into dust cremated put in the in be uh uh food for the sharks or whatever amen but a hair on your head will never perish showing that his care for us has an eternal quality Hallelujah and it's in the time that men's Hearts failing them for fear Jesus makes himself known to his church for here in the 27th verse Jesus already told us now in the preceding that men's Hearts failed him for fear now in the following verse he says then then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass what are we supposed to do what's our response look up look up lift up your head look up for your Redemption draweth nigh can you say amen and are we not living in the time of the Third Exodus God sent a prophet in this age to tell us get the token applied your Redemption is here and God is in his rod his Rod is with us to vindicate the message of the hour can you say Amen oh do you love him you know good and well this dissension is tied it's the dissension this coming that he says they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud with powering Rick Glory it's the descension of Our Lord that Paul spoke of in first Thessalonians 4 16. John wrote writes about in Revelations 10 and 1 it has to do with our Redemption he comes to claim what he has redeemed who our great Shepherd oh do you love him men's Hearts failing them for fear doesn't necessarily mean that they're just dropping dead but it means that they're losing their carriage they're losing faith they're losing their resolve they're failing brother Brian said faith will be real slow what is it why because they're not aware of God's presence can you say man as I get raid closed now first uh first Peter 5 8 you know fear is a great thing and he says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour and again I believe this is prophetic for our day that we're living in if there's ever a time or I'm I mean I know the devil's been walking around you know ever since well before he even got Eve he was walking in the garden and and these things but if if if it's ever a greater time it's the greatest time that he's at work is right now the lid of Hell uh uh has been the lid has been lifted off of Hills the prophet said demons are pouring in everywhere is invading the people ain't that right you see he's walking as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour you know and and they say you know the brother Brown said they say if you're ever killed by a lion it's painless because he scares you to death before he gets to you ain't that right and I'm not saying that Satan is a line but the Bible does say he walking about as a roaring lion and and he's putting fear into the people fear in in in I I think we could all say that if fear ever grips us and God doesn't Deliver Us from that fear then the next step is out you can't believe God so you if brother bran talks about how people can't believe God because they're afraid he won't keep his word fear it's all fear ain't that right afraid fear that God don't love him fear that they're always going to be in The Valleys fear that the the the the the you know the Sun Ain't Gonna Shine for them fear that they're going to go to hell fear and then they say well what's the use then they give up and then they this and then they that they give in to everything but fear is the thing and so he's he's he's in stealing fear in the people and brother Adam said Satan is going about destroying mortal life and spiritual life see some people that just in their life that how many more lives have been ended spiritually and it's all the work of the devil and it starts with something it isn't just an immediate thing it's it's something and Satan projects something to us and it freezes the people listen to the news and they get shaken up instead of holding on to God's word they listen to the doctors incurable disease and they freeze up instead of just following God's word it's fear brother random says see people talk about devils and don't even know what they are sometime that's right but you run headlong into them every day he said maybe but you will notice see he said and after a while the devil was accusing me notice why he's saying you have no power with God you're just a bluff you have no power out of all the times Miracle after Miracle after miracle happened in brother Brown's Ministry and the devil's telling him this how many times have God blessed you and how many times have God rescued us out of our trials and then he gets us to a place where we get convinced again that there's no hope and fear grips us but notice what the prophet said Satan you are an offense to me get out of my way in the name of Jesus Christ and he left he said I laid there a bit in the bed and started to raise up and I felt a real sweet feeling come over me and as I wonder if the Holy Spirit now is close and over in the corner so help me here's my Bible over my heart the sweetest voice I ever heard in my life said Do Don't Fear to go anywhere and don't fear to do anything for the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you everywhere you go that settled it with me let them rage I've got an absolute my anchor holds Yonder because it's the word of the Living God can you say Amen this is exactly what David said I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me and I say to you the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with this church it's with this bride it's with the people amen of God and he has shown forth his rod in this day vindicating this very message the prophet said the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always if the musicians will come brother Brown said the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2 000 years but it is to be loosed by in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time and he promised it and I say he's here can you say man do you love him can you lift your hands unto the Lord and worship him father we love you we thank you for your rod and staff thank you Lord that you are Our Shepherd oh you're watching over your sheep father oh you're with us God you're with us Lord and vindication
