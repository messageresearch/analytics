========================================

your love the Lord and certainly good to be in the house of God tonight musicians can be dismissed and trust everyone had a good day today and amen just looking forward to the coming of the Lord which we know was very soon amen and good to have my father-in-law amen we're just always glad to have him enjoyed the company and I know Mindy and Heather have a man enjoyed it and the grandchildren and glad to have him and we want to keep him in prayer he'd be traveling back home Saturday and we'll give him a safe flight amen home amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Psalms the 23rd chapter and praise the Lord Psalms 23 and before we uh go there can we just bow our heads and ask our lord for his help Father we know that you've redeemed us you've called us Lord and we're so privileged Lord to be called your children to know that you've shed Your Grace Upon Our Lives you put a hunger within us Lord to come to your house and Lord just to feed off your word Lord we know that you desire to meet with us and Lord You've placed a gift within men that they could just yield themselves that you could speak through them to your people and father I just pray Lord that you would just helped me to get myself out of the way and that you would just speak tonight through these mortal lips father and may you anoint the heart the ear to hear and receive of you father for we we want to be better Christians we we want to know more about you and we want that word to be quickened within us father if there's anything that we have done wrong any sins in our life we ask that you would forgive us for them father may your blood just cover us Lord and may you just feel free to to move Among Us and Lord in a supernatural way we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen Psalms the 23rd chapter it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul you can have your seats I'm just going to stop there we 've been on this chapter for for a while now and um I'd like to just continue on it and speaking of this third verse he restoreth my soul and um you know as we've said if if the Lord if the Lord is my shepherd then I am a sheep and and David lets us know that it's the Lord that is doing the leading and that we are doing the following he's the shepherd we're the sheep and David said he leadeth me and so this is a sign that we are his sheep is because we follow the shepherd and he's the leader we're the follower and Jesus said my sheep hear my voice or or know my voice and so the shepherd leads by his voice in any man's voice is his word so then the voice of God is the word of God that's that's the that's how he leads his people and and the the voice of God the prophet said the voice of God will only vindicate the word of God so the voice of God is is not something that's so far-fetched out there that you can't find it in the word but it actually vindicates the word of God and and so when when Moses for example met the pillar fire at the burning bush it had a voice in it and that voice came came from that fire from that bush and and it began to uh vindicate the word it it that that had been prophesied and brother Branham said see that pillar fire spoke the word and Vindicated it to make it show that he's quoted the scriptures see so so uh uh it began to remind Moses of the prophecy that was given to Abraham uh uh many years back and and so it it it it it began to relay this to to Moses and and Moses received the Revelation when he heard God's voice any sheep will hear uh receive Revelation when they hear the voice of God God Amen and and the Revelation that that Moses got was prophecy for his present day if you notice God wasn't just God didn't just the voice didn't just start speaking of Noah it didn't just start speaking of Adam and Eve it it it it began to take the prophecy that was spoken amen and and relay it to his day that he was living in ain't that right and and so uh we we find that the voice of God brought the spoken word to life and it's the same voice that is leading us today it it brings to light the prophecy that speaks of the Bride um uh uh throughout the scriptures for our day and age that we live in and and I I have to say we've heard the voice of God in this day do you believe that we we've heard the voice of God and and this voice of God that we've heard has Vindicated everything that has been prophesied for this day amen and we received the Revelation as Moses has a man at Moses received that Revelation and that Revelation let him know that he was part of the prophecy amen he was part of the prophecy ain't that right Moses didn't just hear the voice out of the Bush amen and then just leave amen wondering what was happening and what was going on in his day and what was he supposed to do amen but the voice of God made it clear that he was part of the prophecy that was given ain't that right amen and so we've received that Revelation that all the scriptures that speak of our day now we would have never known amen what our day was we would have never known that the prophecies were spoken of this day had we not heard the voice of God Amen and and as Moses was you know as far as Moses was concerned he had no purpose he had no he hadn't he had nothing there he was out in the wilderness right hiding from pharaoh and and and trying to start a new life and all of that but God knew God knew that the day had come for the prophecy to be fulfilled and Moses was part of it ain't that right amen and so we've received that Revelation you know Revelations 4 1 has been laying there for years and years as a prophecy but we've heard the voice of God that would tell us that that scripture is for us today it it is it is it is for today a man and the Revelation that we have received is that we're part of that uh prophecy first Thessalonians 4 16-17 Romans the eighth chapter and even Matthew 25 speaking there of the voice of the bridegroom room and and and so many more scriptures that that that were because of the voice of God Amen that has spoken we have received a revelation that we're not just the the average call in in the age that we're living in and we're not just wandering living life uh uh you know uh just just uh half-heartedly or whatever and doing what we want to do and and and then we just die but we found that we have a purpose in life can you say amen amen so these Pro scriptures and and prophecies are uh that are being fulfilled today amen the story of Ruth the story of Esther where prophecies for this day the creation of Adam and Eve was prophecy for this day the story of the shunamite woman a man was prophecy for this day ain't that right and and the voice of God has has made these things known to us that it's more than just the story amen it's more than just a history but God was prophesying through their lives speaking of a day to come amen and we find out that the voice a man the Revelation that we have received is for this day ain't that right amen so so we can look and and and uh uh we are in the word for our day amen that's right that's the script written for us a man in Green Pastures ain't that right a man in Green Pastures we know our place in the word and and if you notice the voice of God commissioned Moses to Gold a man so when he left that that bush and he after he had heard the voice of God he knew his commission he knew what he was to do he he knew can you say amen he knew that the word was going to be fulfilled through him he knew that God was with him he knew these things ain't that right amen and that same voice has commissioned this end time bride amen and she is following the voice of God Amen she's following the shepherd ain't that right amen you see God a man wants to lead man he wants to lead man that that's that's that's the thing he he uh that's what he desires colossian uh 1 18 it says he Christ is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things everybody's saying all things he might have the preeminence and so if you are part of the body of Christ amen the Church of the Living God then God is going to have the preeminence in you amen he's going to have the preeminence in all things now we find that the vast majority of people today amen they follow after things that suit them best amen depict the church that suits them best they picked a religion that suits them best amen they they pick a job that suits them best they they they it's it's it's it's people's right People's Choice and and the thing is they don't give the word of God any consideration at all they they've not listened to the voice of God which shows a man that the Lord is not their Shepherd amen because the voice comes from the word of God Amen it it vindicates the word of God only ain't that right amen and and but yet uh uh uh uh uh so so we find that the the Lord is not their Shepherd word amen and therefore the word of God is dead to them amen think of that the word of God is dead to them the word of God was dead Amen to Moses until he heard the voice of God Amen uh uh uh maybe he he understood the quote or the prophecies and things that and heard about it and yes his mom had probably told him amen that you're the one Moses you're you're the one but after he tried it and he failed amen he he you know he's in the backside of the desert he ain't got no desire to fulfill prophecy he ain't got no desire Amen to deliver the children of Israel amen he ain't got no desire whatsoever amen he failed the first time ain't that right but once he heard the voice of God though promise became quickened unto him amen that's right see and if if uh uh uh the world would just hear the voice of God if they would have heard it amen but they didn't hear it they didn't want to hear it a man so they're doing exactly what the Bible said they would do walking after their own lust a man heaping unto themselves teachers having itching ears giving heed to seducing spirits and and doctrines of devils you realize that's all uh what what uh the prophecy was for this day of the world Amen see that they would do these things but the Sheep amen sheep are born under the tudorship of their Shepherd hey ain't that right amen he learns that sheep learns the voice of its Shepherd a man to wear that it it it will not follow any other voice amen it doesn't go after any other uh uh uh strange well Jesus in speaking of his sheep said a stranger they will not follow oh ain't that right a stranger they will not follow and you see a strange voice is one who speaks outside the word of God Amen that's right see and so there are many strange voices today oh yes they they'll get the word and they open the Bible up at how many interpretations do we have out of this Bible that has never been Vindicated by God whatsoever amen see and so many ideas and and traditions and interpretations and and all of these things and it's led the people away amen into foodless pastures amen that's right and the people are spiritually dead there is no Supernatural moving in their lives they don't even know what the Supernatural is all they know is their Church Dogma all they know is their Church programs all they know is their Church up uh uh ideologies or whatever see but but we fine now if you notice David said he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures now that we know as we talked about it the Green Pastures is where the abundance of food is a man and food sustains life ain't that right a man and the pastures are green which shows that there is life ain't that right so the green pastors ain't denominations amen the prophet called him foodless pastors amen the people are dead can you say Amen the church is dead the denominations are dead amen go study your history amen if you really want to know you know people get criticized or get critical amen because we talk about denominations amen but let me tell you something if you'll study your history amen the Methodist used to be on fire for God they used to have the supernatural power of God they used to have the anointing of God Amen the lutherans had the power of God Amen to you to have the anointing of God they used to have the words for their age but but when they began to organize and teach darkness and traditions and and would not go any further they're sitting dead today allowing homosexuals behind their pulpits and and married uh uh deacons married two or three four times you know and and all of these things they've thrown away the Bible amen and accepted denominational ideas which all stems from the Catholic church and so the people even though religious they got baseball on their minds more than they do God Amen they got Sports on their mind more than they do God they got movies on their mind more than they do God instead of listen the good wholesome Godly music now they're bringing in the rock and roll and they're bringing in the country and and nobody you know I I've I've I've I've uh worked out with pastors and gyms amen and they're talking about rated our moon movies and and and uh that they've watched and going to rock concerts pastors that would feed their people the word of God Amen gone to rock and roll concerts amen oh my how degraded can you say amen amen it's foodless pastors amen but here we find that the psalmist said he he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leads me beside the Still Waters water speaks of life as well eternal life can you say man amen so the Lord my shepherd the Lord Our Shepherd leads us to life and not death ain't that right he'll never lead his Sheep amen to the place where they're spiritually dead it's true amen that's right our Shepherd never leads us to the place to where we are spiritually starving and spiritually famished and parched you know the Bible says there in Romans 6 23 at the wages of sin is death ain't that right I just tell you he doesn't lead us to the barn room Our Shepherd doesn't lead us Amen to ungodly places he doesn't lead us to the movie houses he doesn't lead us to the places you know amen he doesn't lead us the denominations again foodless pastors that's what the prophet called them Vindicated right he never leads me to a place where I'll sit there and deny his word he he ain't going to lead us to them places because the wages of sin is death can you say Amen so we find that that David you know uh is saying the Lord is Our Shepherd and and he tells us that he is following the shepherd for he said he leadeth me he leads me we're not Cowboys and Rodeo here amen that that's not the way of Christianity he leadeth me can you say Amen don't have to have a rope on him and pulling him and dragging him and and the Sheep just pulling away no he just leads by his voice and we follow now now church not everybody can follow the lord not everyone can accept his leadership because he only leads by his word that's his voice can you say man now Peter said they would deny the Lord that bought them deny him the right to lead them to to leadership can you say amen amen see so they see the word of God Vindicated for this day and they walk away from it you know what the Bible identifies them as being children of disobedience children of Disobedience ain't that right now notice as as we go on now amen David gives the answer as to why he is different from the millions of people in the world and why we are different amen and I say we not just fake Tabernacle amen but and and not just everybody in the message either amen amen there's a lot of people in the messes that that the Lord ain't their Shepherd can you say amen amen but but I will say all the Sheep will be in the message amen amen that's just Vindicated word of the hour ain't that right amen but but we find amen the reason that makes us different is he restoreth my soul my soul is restored ain't that right amen now now we find a man David um this shows that David is a Believer amen his soul is restored now now we find in Ezekiel uh uh 18 and 20. it says the soul that sinneth it shall die ain't that right the soul that's sinneth it shall die amen ain't speaking of restoration it's speaking of death but David is saying he restoreth my soul ain't that right now we find by the message of the hour that the only sin there is unbelief ain't that right adultery is not sin it's the attribute of sin it's the attribute of unbelief smoking cigarettes it's an attribute of unbelief ain't that right amen hate is an attribute of unbelief you could go on and on and on but there's really one sin and that's unbelief so the soul that disbelieth shall die ain't that right the soul that disbelieves shall die so we we find that every believer then experiences what David is talking about he restoreth my soul as we talked the last time we spoke on this that a soul is worth ten thousand worlds amen a soul is priceless the soul of a man and but we put all the emphasis on the flesh and and yet it's it's what you are in your soul that really counts amen see we we get the the the ox cart and the horse backwards you know we put the the cart before the horse but see it's the soul the soul is the place where you live now I know most of us know this but I'm going to go through it again amen man is a Triune being he is body spirit and soul ain't that right amen see the number three amen the prophet tells us is the number of perfection it takes three elements to bring a birth water blood spirit ain't that right there's three works of Grace justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and according to first Thessalonians 4 16 there are three things that involve the coming of the Lord ain't that right amen he says Paul said the Lord himself shall descend with the shout a voice the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God three things ain't that right amen that make up a Rapture amen see so we find also that God is perfected in three he is a trinity or he in a trinity is one ain't that right father their Son and Holy Ghost makes one God not three Gods one God ain't that right and the prophet said he cannot be manifested any other way see they say that the star that that led the wise men to Jesus you know they they say that it was three stars made into one star a man formed came together and made one star you know and the prophet said it showed that the Trinity of God was made manifest in one man Jesus Christ the fullness of the godhead came in Jesus Christ ain't that right we also find in the wilderness in Moses's Tabernacle there was only one Tabernacle but there were three courts there was the outer Court the inner court and the holy place or the holiest of holy ain't that right and all three made up one Tabernacle so then we look at man body spirit and soul makes one man you cannot be manifested without being the Trinity person that you are can you say Amen you can't be manifested just as a body can be manifested just as a spirit can't be manifested just as a soul yeah it takes all three ain't that right so we we find that that the body of course is the outer layer it this is the old flesh and it has five inlets Stacy smell here and and uh a touch I I believe and and so uh without these senses you cannot touch the body amen you you can't get in uh in other words it's the only way to the body and the prophet would tell us this old outside is the evil one ain't that right then then you've got in inside of the body you've got the spirit that's the next thing amen and it has five inlets it has imagination it has conscience um memory uh reasoning again affection I believe it is amen and and and so that is the spirit amen but inside of the inside the the the core of it all is the soul that now that's that's you a man the soul and and uh that's the inside of the inside and the problem outfit tells us there's only one gate to that one and that's free moral agency ain't that right you you uh uh you know you can refuse or you can receive and it's either controlled by faith or doubt ain't that right so you've got five inlets to the body five inlets to the spirit but one Inlet free moral agency whether you where you have the right to choose or to reject Faith or doubt ain't that right and that is in your soul now you know I I want to say this a Christian is not a Christian in the flesh a Christian is not a Christian in his spirit a Christian is a believer in his soul ain't that right see it's the soul is what is predestinated now just bear with me as we go on but we we find that the difference between the animal and man is that the animal has no soul some things we've we've already talked about but I'm just reiterating it uh there but the the the animal has no soul uh it it has life in its body but it has no soul in the life ain't that right you know it it has not the intelligence the prophet tells us uh uh that man has see it doesn't know that he's naked it doesn't realize a man that uh what sin is because it has no soul a man see but man has life and he has a soul in that life amen now Genesis 2 and 7 and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul did you know the soul is the nature of the life amen that's what the prophet said in others are several places he also says that the soul is the nature of the spirit he said it's the soul that controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body now I I thank God for a prophet because we would never know these things amen say we would never know and understand in that spiritual realm amen what's really going on but the soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body ain't that right so when man sinned he became degenerate in his soul ain't that right and that word degenerate a man is to decline or falling from a higher to a lower level in quality character or Vitality to pass from a higher to a lower type of condition now notice when man's Soul became degenerate it caused him to act different it caused him to think different it caused him to see things differently it changed his spirit and affected his body ain't that right we look at it and it wasn't just too far after this the fall but Genesis 6 and 2 it tells us that the sons of God says children that that set was the atomist son right or son of Adam descendant of Adam the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose now the prophet said they lost it for them women ain't that right they saw that they were beautiful and they lost it for them and went for them also there in the fifth verse of the Genesis 6 tells us that every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was only evil continually continually now God wiped the the earth clean of man only Noah and his family were saved ain't that right but then as they began to to produce more offspring and feel the Earth again man man just feel the Earth with sin look where we're at today ain't that right it's the most evil age ever that's right see so Man became degenerate when you were born in this Natural Life the breath of life was breathed in you and that's your spirit see and and that spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God the prophet said it was given or permitted by God didn't come from God it was permitted by God ain't that right so every child that's born in the world is born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies every child that way you don't have to teach a child to to get mad he just does it you don't have to teach a child to bite he just does it amen seed the person inside there is a sinner to begin with and by Nature by Nature you were of this world and alienated as Paul would tell us from the life of God ain't that right Paul in Ephesians 2 and 1 tells us that we were dead in trespasses and sins the soul was dead hello the soul was dead alienated couldn't understand Supernatural things couldn't understand the things of God the Bible even says that the carnal mind is enmity against God can't even come become subject to the law of God ain't that right so now many religions today or have always focused upon the body this whole flesh people get baptized and think that that saves them even the UPC denomination thinks that baptism washes the sins away but that doesn't save you at all right can you say man baptizing baptism does not wash away your sins it's only an act outward Act it's an outward act to show a man that you have died uh uh to yourself and that you have surrendered your heart to God ain't that right so but but they they go through the outward emotions and and then you have the legalists amen that lived by the law touch not taste not smell not handle not see not all of these things and and they make Christianity all about rules of do's and don'ts legalism produces the most meanest people on the face of the earth I think now the prophet said we're not supposed to make Converse to Christianity by a government but by the revelation the Christ in you as God was in Christ can you say Amen so the prophet said all that does all legalism does is make religious Fanatics out of people that's right it's true we was raised around them apostolics the focus was on you know and all the questions can I trim my hair can I not well just study the Bible you know how how how high is long you know when you're coming to the heels how how long do I have to be with my skirts how long do I have to do this and how much do I have to do this and that's all that the people focused on because they were looking at the outside and it never dealt with the insight then you say Amen now if you really want to go by the flesh Muslims have it better than us for the most part right they're so rigid in everything that they do praying five times a day I believe it is they shut down everything just to go depressed it's it's a it's a it's it's it's on the outside but you'll never be able to tame the flesh through legalistic teaching Prophet said many of you think because you got long hair that means you're going to heaven that doesn't mean that many of them thinks because you're a good moral woman you're going to heaven that don't mean that many of them think because their church is well belonged I belong to this and and this great group and great doctors of divinity that don't mean that he said you could have your hair long your dress is long and have a temper enough to fight a buzz saw hate your neighbor and everything else and gossip tear Church apart can you say Amen and yet because we focus so much on the outward appearance this old flesh we think we've really done something can you say Amen so then we find then there's people that go beyond that and and they don't worry about flesh and some people do but then they go into the spirit Realm the spirit so you know uh the prophet said your spirit can be Anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit right but that doesn't mean you're saved now this is where the Deception comes in ain't that right now I want you to listen now Matthew 5 44 Jesus and speaking of the father said he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good same Sun that rises Rises and Shines on the good and on the evil he sendeth his Reign upon the just and the unjust can you say Amen now listen as as the rain falls upon your pretty little flowers that same rain is falling on the weeds out there that you hate or that you have to keep mold it'd be nice if rain and fall on portions of things that we want follow my garden but don't fall on my grass cause I don't want to mow but the rain falls on the wheat and the weeds ain't that right see they benefit from the same rain they both Prosper they grow into maturity they both are planted in the same dirt the same field now listen Matthew 13 24 it says another Parable putting you forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man with sow good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and soaked tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears all Soul so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did us not thou so good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tears and he said unto them the enemy hath done this the servant said unto him well thou them that we go and gather them up and he said no nay that's why we gather up the tears he root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest today's the Harvest right it's harvest time and and the Gathering has taken place and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them into bundles to burn them amen and and and gather the we are but gather the wheat into my barn so we find two different seeds sowed by two different Sowers but planted in the same field receiving the same rain can you say Amen now we know who the Sowers are that was God and Satan ain't that right amen and they're receiving the same benefits now this would explain why Matthew 24 and 24 Jesus said there shall rise false christs right and false prophets and they shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they should deceive the very elect now it's not possible aren't you glad for that amen but if it weren't possible it would be so close that it would deceive the very elect this deception now the word Christ means anointed ones ain't that right not false jesuses there's many jesuses but there's only one Christ one true Christ one true anointed ain't that right amen see and so there would be false teachers in other words as the prophet would let us know these men would be a Anointed with the true thing and yet false teachers of the word ain't that right now uh and I hope this all right but if you'll notice Jesus had to be anointed uh Luke 4 and 18 it says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears now is listen to brother Wayne Uh preached down at the the meeting in Louisiana I really like what he said the other night he said he is not just the Son of God but he is the anointed Son of God he is not just the word but he is the anointed word he's not just the letter that he is the Dynamics of the letter he is not just the word he is the word and the flesh together can you say Amen amen see so you are nothing without the anointing you'll never leave the Bible without the anointing can you say Amen but notice the anointing can fall on your spirit and anoint you to do a certain thing and you do it and still be lost ain't that right K Ephesus prophesied and yet he consented to Jesus's crucifixion Judas cast out devils and yet the Bible said he was the son of perdition son of the devil Balaam prophesied yet he was a false prophet that calls God's people to commit fornication see they were anointed and yes they did prophesy and yes they did cast out devils but it never changed who they were ain't that right they they the spirit had anointed them to prophesy and to do these things but the difference was Jesus was the anointed word ain't that right look the Bible says he picked up the book and found the place where it was written of him think of that he knew his place in the Bible he knew it he knew what day it was and he knew that he was commissioned to fulfill the prophecy for his day ain't that right see the prophet had already spoken over his life well it's true anyhow the prophet had already spoken the prophet Moses the prophet Isaiah the prophet Isa Ezekiel amen all the prophets spoke of the Messiah the prophet David ain't that right Hallelujah you know these blind Pharisees of this they call us Pentecostals because we dance and we shout and we Haul her we get excited at the word they say oh that's Pentecostal we preach under the inspiration and they have no clue as to what they're talking about you see you look I I was raised in a Pentecostal movement and and uh uh oh yeah they shouted they screamed and they hollered and they were anointed but for what come on don't be Baptist on me tonight for what nothing there was no word there can you say Amen see if there's no word over their life then what good is the anointing and so they try to compare us they try to compare us with the Pentecostal movement oh they're just excited oh they just you know they just they they just we don't have to have music to get excited like Pentecostals do a real believer just to gets excited about the word of God and if you notice now listen now if you notice we are fulfilling Revelations the fifth chapter and we don't have to just do it say well I'm going to try to do it no it's in our heart there's something that just moves us and when the book was open there came shouting and screaming and John said I was one of them ain't that right and John was a representation of the of the Bride now the rain falls on the just and the unjust and the weeds Rejoice with the wheat but it's what lays at the core does does the rain does the rain make the weeds wheat nope it doesn't oh the the rain falls upon them both but it doesn't change what they are it just helps them to mature then you say Amen so we find brother Brown says you see it in yet they're anointed in the spirit but they got backbitings talking about the Pentecostals backbitings fightings and everything else amongst the Christian church anointed in the spirit perfecting the flesh as far as morals Bill Brown said the same holy spirit that anoints the church that gives them the desire to save Souls that gives them the desire the power to perform Miracles it also falls on the unjust just the same as it does the just but they are not anointed to the word can you say Amen they're not anointed to the word he said the outside I think we read this last time but the outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the Soul be as pit the darkest pitch see the Cocker bear grows on the same water puts life that puts life into the wheat puts life into the Kookaburra and at the bottom of the Kookaburra it's a Cocker bear life it's rejoicing and blooming and got life and doing everything that the wheat does but the soul of it is Cocker bear false teachers can rise teaching all kinds of trinitarianism and everything else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can but it's by the word that does it give it the word test can you say Amen I know I'm reading a lot of quotes but I hope that's all right Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul is his germ and that germ is the word he said I don't care how much you can preach how will you do this and how much you love that's one of the inlets of the spirit you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the inlets you can love and even love God and still not be right you with me you can love and you should love but the problem is people misuse love and he ain't got no bears with it and they take Holy Love and make it filthy love ungodly love hello let's just love everybody and not have any standards or convictions at all well see that love comes from the spirit and you can even love God and still not be right you can cast out devils and preach and do these things and still not be right Jesus said so many would come in that day but the word settles it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us you realize that's where we're at today the word to become flesh every prophecy speaking of this bride must become flesh yes sir now the anointing has come upon the church to Manifest this portion of the word of God for this age so the prophet said if that soul didn't come from God then it wasn't a germ of God to begin with just like the priest he heard Jesus teach he saw them the supernatural works of God done by Jesus he saw the sign of the Messiah and then called her the devil because there was nothing to Quicken his soul hello you couldn't you couldn't the Bible said you couldn't blame you they they were these were righteous men holy men as far as the flesh nobody can put a finger upon them on their lives but Jesus said they were of their father of the devil ain't that right but then you find he'd done many signs and wonders among the priests and they call it a devil but he done one time performed the Messiah sign to the woman at the well ain't that right and immediately she saw that he was the Messiah and what did it do it changed her from what person she was totally transformed her to another person what the prophet said she had fallen from God's thoughts she could be redeemed she was a subject and she had representation in heaven and she turned around he said if she didn't have representation from predestination it would have never taken hold so now I know this is simple for most of us but now this is why a man must be born again it goes beyond the flesh it goes beyond the spirit and it takes place in the soul ain't that right see that that's when that old nature dies and rots and God comes in and establishes his throne can you say Amen that's right see brother Brown said when when God comes into the heart that Soul see partnership with us by taking this Earthly man and his eternal spirit and joining them together ain't that right and it's the only way that God could establish his throne into the heart of man ain't ain't that right you perfect the flesh through all the do's and don'ts and yet you're still your own man and let God just anoint that spirit and you may prophesy speaking tongues roll on the floor you you may preach you may see a vision you may whatever and still act like a devil that's right now see the prophet tells us that the outside man can reason and so outside man a man man may look at a woman beautiful sexy dressed and she might he might say well I you know I'm not supposed to be doing that I'm not supposed to commit adultery well see it's the spirit of a man that's telling that man he shouldn't do it hello but way down in the soul the prophet said that thing is still there oh my God come on hello and that's what will govern that man that's what will control him and if there's nothing to control him to the word he'll go for it and say man now I'm closing but the prophet said when it's directed from the inside it throws all the rest of it together and that's the guidepost that's the control tower the inside of the inside see the real gift he says is your soul down there that was born of God that controls your spirit and your body to the word of God and the will of God can you say Amen now this is where David says he restores my soul the Lord is my shepherd he's the one that's leading he wasn't just one that would perfect his flesh and then God tried to lead him I ain't going that way try to tell him God sent a prophet and show them that God promised to send a prophet in this day Malachi 4 and 5. but they've been taught against it there ain't no such thing or they've seen all these other false prophets Joseph Smith the Mormons they follow and they got some weird doctrines they had to even write another book you know that's a scarecrow to keep people away from the real thing but it doesn't do away with the fact that God promised to send a prophet amen can you say Amen now church we know that Jesus is the coming king of this Earth but that doesn't mean that he's not King now ain't that right he is our King he is the king of saints the Bible calls him and his kingdom today is a spiritual Kingdom it's not of this world's system and neither are we of this world there's nothing about this world that we are part of is that right and because he is our King and establishes his throne in the soul or the heart of man we act different from the world our citizenship is in heaven we reflect the spirit of another world of our rebirth then you say Amen where Jesus is the king that's why our women do not dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or use all the cosmetics and other things that the world likes so much that is why our men don't drink and smoke and listen to the rock and roll and the country and the filth and carry on in the Sin it's not because we live by a law of do's and don'ts it's because the king has Abode or taken established his throne in our hearts and he's not dragging us he's our Shepherd and he leads us into Green Pastures into the word and you say Amen and our Dominion the prophesied is a dominion over sin and it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells us and every Kingdom on Earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain can you say Amen if the musicians will come ours will remain ours will remain and think of it those that have listened to the voice you see we're in a in a time because as in Revelations 4 1. The Voice John heard the voice of God say come up hither you see it's the voice of God that's bringing on this rapture we're hearing the voice hearing the voice hearing the voice that's why we've shunned all strange voices you know the Bible says make your calling in election sure don't don't take things for granted but make sure that word is having effect in your life can you say man make sure that the Lord is your Shepherd don't don't be led by your feelings don't be led by your emotions don't be led by your own thinking let the Lord be your Shepherd and the only way it can happen is he restores the soul Hallelujah do you love him amen amen what song give me the word make it plain and clear to me give me the word it's the light that I might see give me the word it's my total victory over every situation can we go up the key me the word make it plain and clear to me give me the word it's the light that I might see give me the word oh yeah [Music] total over every situation give me the word oh it's been tested it's been tried searching minds are satisfied though the story's old the message still is true it's been ridiculed it's been changed still the powers never changed it'll stand the test forever [Music] make it plain and clear to me give me the word oh it's the light that I might see give me the word oh it's my total victory over every situation give me the word water down sugar coated or profound give me basic truth preach is strong preach it clear that all the world can hear or change your life forever give me the word oh give me the word make it plain and clear to me it was the word of God that brought creation it was the word of God all the way through within the word of God word of God amen word of God praise and Lazarus from the grave four days old but the word of God called him out there's power in that word there's power in that voice God today you believe that church it's called us out of traditions it's just called us out of churchanity foreign Church goer just being the average professed Christian it's quickened our soul and made us to live Hallelujah [Music] where that Soul can believe in the Supernatural where we can believe in all things being possible even when it's an impossible situation oh I'm so glad for that do you love him oh let's stand to our feet now sing it one more time oh give me [Music] we'll make it plain and clear to me give me the word it's a light that I might see give me the word it's my total victory over every situation give me the word over every situation give me the word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen he lives he lives Christ Jesus lives today he walks with me he talks with me a long life's narrow way hey he lives [Music] he's a Salvation to impart you ask me how I know he lives he lives Within my heart he lives he lives Christ Jesus lives today he walks with me he talks with me a long Life's a narrow way me he lives salvation true in power you ask me how I know he lives he lives Within my heart aren't you glad he lives oh my to know that we know a God that lives amen we've had a personal relationship with him oh isn't he wonderful let's sing one more song I bless your name I bless your name bless [Music] I give you honor I give you praise [Music] you are the love the little truth away yes you are yes you are I bless your name [Music] I bless let's sing it again I bless your name [Music] foreign [Music] I give you praise [Music] [Music] the truth away yes you are Lord bless your name [Music] as they just play soft
