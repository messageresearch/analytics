not only is he yours but you are his I'm so glad I belong to him amen do you love the Lord amen what uh Services we've been having and uh the Lord has just been here in a special way and uh just good to um man I am so blessed to be part of the message of the hour you know that God sent a prophet Amen to make clear the word of God to us and and not only that but to have a heart to believe amen what God had spoken through the prophet and I'm so thankful for the Ministers of this age that are preaching the gospel that refuses to be silent amen and I am so glad that there's Believers in this age that still believe a message amen what what good would it be to have ministers preaching the message if there wasn't anyone to believe and I um I want to say just thank you all for you can be seated for just a moment but thank you all for uh coming with a uh just creating an atmosphere amen because I think that is so important amen and the prophet has told us you know um that it isn't the the preacher that comes and you know that does a performs the magic to us and all that and God's placed a gift in his life but it takes us as the people to create an atmosphere and to pull on the gift and um and you you always know when there's Believers around because they know how to do that and uh it's not a sideshow to us it's not just some trick amen that the preacher is doing or the musicians have to do or have a fancy choir or fancy church or whatever it just takes a people that know how to pull on the gift and I believe that you are a people of such um that do that and so we appreciate that and I appreciate all you ministers uh for supporting the meni uh the the meetings and um uh bringing your your people and um uh to come and help us and uh We've here the fourth night already and just seem like the week's going by fast amen but I can truly say the Lord has met with us throughout each night and uh been such an atmosphere amen you think well how can it get better and it just keeps just climbing and climbing and I'm looking for a great time tonight and uh um so we've got uh brother Josh Bennett that is going to be ministering tonight and we're just really honored to have him and I appreciate uh his love for the Lord and most of all staying true with the message of the hour putting it before the people and realizing that this message is the way out of here amen the message is the way out of here we're not as brother Wayne said we're not uh glorifying the man of William brandom amen but we got our eyes just a little higher we we recognize the God that was had his picture taken with that prophet and as I've said before you know God could have just had his picture taken and um all we would have had was just a picture of the pillar of fire and that would have been wonderful but it would still left us in confusion amen but God had his picture taken with brother brandom that gives us sends us a message that I back up what he says what he preaches I back up so you can listen to the tapes because God backs it up and if God can back it up I can back it up can you say Amen if God says Amen to it then I can say Amen to it amen so I'm I'm just honored to be part of this you know because we're we're a generation you know we could have been back in you know in Joshua's day or even David's day and just hearing the stories of what happened in moses' time in the pillar of fire and we wouldn't have even got to hear the voice wouldn't have got to see these things but amen we've got the voice of a prophet on tape we can hear it play in our car our home and and the ministers as ministers get to study these things and but not only that we have a picture of a pillar of fire that God has Vindicated a message thoroughly can you say Amen aren't you glad for that you following a message that's been Vindicated I'm so glad for that and so uh you know brother Josh Bennett is one that um of uh that don't feel like he needs his own sermon or his own come up with some own his own thought amen but I've heard him preach many times and uh been friends with him and and uh he just yields himself to the Lord and let the Lord just flow through him and he believes this message with all of his heart and so I know you're in for a real good time tonight and I encourage you just to pull on the gift and whatever you have need of I promise you God will meet it amen we've seen it happen time and time again amen so uh let's just stand to our feet and I want to welcome just all of the visitors all of you all for coming and being part of our uh meeting and God bless you richly amen but let's just sing the song feel my cup Lord amen here's my cup Lord I Lift It Up [Music] Lord come and quench this thirsting of my soul Bread of Heaven feed me till I want

home amen amen how many believes he's here to do it tonight amen amen let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer as we just look to God if you got a need tonight may you just want to make it known by an uplifted hand amen I believe God sees every every hand he knows every heart tonight let's just by our hearts Lord Jesus Lord we just thank you God for another opportunity that you've given us to come together and just gather with your children Lord and Lord Believers of like Precious faith and and Lord we're we're we count it a great honor and a privilege Lord to be able to come together like this and and Lord we know these are special times Lord that you've given us Lord that we can come together and bring our licks of fire and Lord as the prophet of God said each one of us having a lick of fire off of that great Pillar of Fire and when we come together Lord then we know that the pillar of fire is back in our midst again and and Lord as we're standing here Lord recognizing that and realizing that we also realize that because that you are here Lord then all things are possible and Lord we can have an expectation of the Supernatural and and Lord we believe that Lord that needs will be met tonight and the sick can be healed and discouraged Hearts would be encouraged Lord we believe that Lord because you are here present and so God we're just asking you to have your way Lord I pray that you would just come and Lord take the word now we know the word is already anointed but we're asking that you would anoint our lips and Lord anoint our hearts and just open uh up the hearts of your children God that that word would find a resting place Lord in our hearts and Lord when we leave here God that word will will be burning in our hearts as a as a living manifestation God lord we didn't come to be just stimulated in our minds but Lord we come Lord that Lord that the quickening power of the Holy Spirit would come upon the word of God and Lord that it would be quickened to our hearts and our lives and Lord become a living reality in us God that's what we desire Lord we give our oursel to you we give this service to you now For Your Glory and Honor and we ask it in Jesus name amen amen we just amen uh count it a great honor to be here and amen we want to pre uh thank brother Sean for the invitation to come and I also wanted to thank you all for your prayers for my mother-in-law she's uh she come through the surgery and is doing recovering well and God has come on the scene for her and really in a special way so we just thank God for that and I appreciate all your prayers and amen it's good to know that God is still God and amen amen it's good to know that the God we serve is still uh he's still on the throne and amen he's still a Healer and amen everything God ever was he still is tonight amen I believe that with all my heart so we just certainly appreciate all your prayers and I apologize I hadn't been able to be here uh in the support of the meeting but amen we we certainly are honored to be here tonight amen if You' take your Bibles I'd like to turn to two places in the scripture in the both in the Book of Matthew I'd like to read from Matthew Chapter 5 um just one verse there and then also one verse out of Matthew chapter 4 if I get to coffin having a coffin fit don't be worried about it I um I'm trying I've been uh getting over uh uh I had the flu a while back and some of them symptoms are lingering and they're trying to hold on but Satan is a liar amen so uh amen all the symptoms we just call them lme vanities tonight amen but we just uh ask God for his grace Matthew Chapter 5 and I want to read one verse there verse 6 and then also one verse from Matthew chapter 4 let's read from Matthew 5 and 6 and the Bible says blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled amen how many's thankful for that promise tonight amen so if you have a hunger and a thirst for right you shall be filled amen Matthew 4 and uh just one verse there Matthew 4 and: 4 but he answered and said it is is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen may the Lord just add His blessings as you're seated tonight I want to uh speak to you tonight just for a few minutes on the blessing of hunger and um I'm good to have brother Tim here tonight and brother Thomas and brother Colin there from the church and and uh so we appreciate them being here tonight but uh they're going to have to hear some things they've already heard amen but uh uh but God uh uh you know I I believe that uh somebody said one time that leftovers wasn't too bad if you got them hot enough so maybe we can get it good and hot amen amen but uh we just want to look at this tonight the blessing of hunger amen and and you can see here that Jesus is saying and and there in Matthew 5 as he's preaching there uh his great great sermon and uh and and he's placing a blessing upon the people he says blessed are the poor in spirit blessed amen are the meek and so forth and and there was all the blessings that he began to say that over the people amen but he he said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness amen so we can see that but the that right at the beginning of this this hunger and thirst that Jesus is speaking of is not a a natural hunger it's not a a hunger for bread or water uh it's not that the the natural hunger but he's talking about a spiritual hunger amen a a spiritual desire within the people amen so he said blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after right for they shall be filled and amen I love how the scripture is positive and amen the word of God is just positive it don't say that they might be filled but it says they shall be filled amen so amen we got a promise tonight that if we come hungry amen we're going to leave satisfied amen if we come thirsty then we're going to leave satisfied amen because the Bible says blessed are they that hunger and thirst amen for they shall be filled now amen we also know that the Bible predicts that there would be a famine in the land in the last days and amen The Book of Amos the 8th chapter there the Bible says that behold the days come sayith the Lord that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread not a thirst for water but the but hearing of the words of the Lord amen so the famine uh would be the famine for hearing the word of God Amen and brother Brandon would say it this way in the message the Seal of the Antichrist he said the churches are cooling off we might as well just face that the churches are getting worse all the time more preaching is being done than ever in the world and less practice than we ever did in all the world it just looks like it just keeps cooling off and great re revivals will strike the country men will come in anointed of the Holy Spirit they'll preach with everything that's within them and the people will just walk right away as if nothing ever happened see just unconcerned amen that's amen there's got to be a reason for that and if you'll study this then this will tell us what the reason is do you know the scripture says that there will be a time in the last days that there'll be a famine that will strike the land not for bread and water but for hearing of the word of God and that men would go to and fr and east and west seeking to hear the word of God and fail to find it just think of the times that we're living in and we're living in that time so now a prophet is not only showing us amen that it was prophesied in the in the scripture that there would come a time of famine amen but now a prophet is identifying we are actually living in that time amen we're living in the hour of the famine amen that was prophesied in Amos 811 amen that there would come a time amen that people would not amen hear the word of the Lord amen and Paul talks about it he said listen they'll not endure sound Doctrine but they'll heat to themselves teachers having itching ears is that right amen the time will come and listen friends we're living in that time now amen it's not amen a famine for bread and water brother said we got plenty of bread to eat and plenty of water to drink and we got houses to live in and amen and play and we got money in the bank and all these things amen but listen amen what is lacking and what is missing amen is a hearing of the word of God amen amen listen and and a famine will always bring a hunger amen famine amen because a famine is a lack of something see amen and famine is followed by starvation amen and hunger amen and brother B would say the Cry of hunger listen he said the cry the great cry it's a great cry because it's distressful SE and a person is dying he said if we could just get to that place if this nation could get to the place that is so hungered for God he said it's in a worse starvation than the Nations like India see they're starving physically amen but this nation is starving spiritually amen but after you are hungry for so long amen it gets to the place that you don't know you're hungry it's just like a man that's freezing to death he'll go so far see and when you get so cold and then and while you and then after a while the prophet said you begin to become warm and when you do you're dying then see amen and that's what's the matter tonight the church has got so cold until they're freezing amen and they think that they're warm they think they're warm by membership but they're dying spiritually amen see they don't even know it and finally they just lay down and go to sleep and that's all of it and they'll never wake up again amen because his blood is just Flo Frozen up right in his veins there and the prophet of God said that's the condition that the church is in in the last days it's spiritually dying amen it's spiritually starving amen but it's been hungry for so long amen until it don't even recognize amen the hunger amen or the starvation amen or the condition that it's got so cold amen until a spiritual condition amen it struck the church until it's got so cold that it's fell into a state amen that it believes that it warm amen and the prophet of God said amen they're they're they're in this condition see spiritually dying on the church [Applause] pew amen spiritually starving sitting right in a church wow because there's a famine in the land and it's a famine of the hearing of the word of God Amen but the prophet of God said that's why I ever preacher amen ought to stand and preach and give the people spiritual food in new season Hallelujah listen friends there's no need for our churches to starve and die amen we got a message amen we got food amen we got the bread of life hallelujah what we need to do is hand it out Hallelujah and let me tell you something friends amen we don't need somebody to rise up with a new message amen we don't need an eighth Messenger to come on the scene or somebody with a new idea amen no sir amen we got the right message we got the right food amen we got spiritual food in Du season tonight amen all we need to do is take what we have and feed it give it out to the people of [Applause] God hallelujah amen it's like Jesus amen when he was feeding the multitude amen the the prophet of God said he took the amen that little boy's lunch amen and he took and he as he broke that bread amen amen he was multiplying the bread and as he broke that bread he handed it to his disciples and they in turn handed it to the people come on friends they didn't cook it they didn't season it amen they didn't create it they just took it from his hand and give it out to the people and I tell you that's what the true fivefold ministry will do in this hour amen we ain't cooking this food we ain't seasoning the food amen all we're doing is taking amen right from the hand of God through the messenger of this hour and handed it out to the [Applause] people excuse me amen what is it spiritual food in due season Hallelujah the prophet said I'm sorry he said this day that we're living in is such an unsettled peace unsettled rest everywhere people were running to and fro seeking whatever they might seek he said and most anybody can get a following no matter what they teach or think somebody will listen to them amen and that's the day that the prophet spoke of that the people see cuz when they're hungry they'll eat from anywhere if children and people are starving that'll eat from a garbage can see that one people that once ate from a table but if they get hungry they'll eat somewhere but I think a real true Ministers of the Gospel ought to be up and going amen ought to be giving the people the right thing amen meet in due season amen let me just say this tonight this ain't the hour amen for us to preach our ideas and amen this ain't a high for us to go off on tangents and this ain't a time for us to amen preach our complexes and amen and get caught up in every fire there is amen listen this is the hour Amen to preach the word that was Paul's instruction to Timothy be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke with all longsuffering preach the word of God listen friends I tell you amen there's all kind of voices and there's all kind of pressure from every side amen and some's over here saying you quote the prophet too much and somebody over here say Amen listen you need to sit down and just play a tape amen but I want to say tonight God still got some men God still got some ministers God still got some preachers Hallelujah and we ain't preaching our opinion we ain't preaching amen some Fable amen or some Hollywood Story amen we're preaching the pure unadulterated word of God the message of the hour Hallelujah and that message will change your [Applause] body oh oh Hallelujah blessed are they which through hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled just to be hungry is a blessing Amen brother Bon would say he said Lord he said we don't even have tongues enough to express our gratitude for the presence of the Living God that's been in our midst this last week for the things that we have learned of you and how you have revealed yourself to us down through the time and how you made your word so plain to us amen how we've waited on you and you you and tried and you and and and and how that we've tried to express our love amen but we fail to do it Lord C mortal tongue cannot do it for even saving us for giving us a hunger for you how many thankful tonight that God gave you a hunger for him amen listen friends he said because it's written in the word blessed are they that do Hunger just a hunger is a blessing right Hallelujah he said in another place you find out until people begin to want God until people begin to thirst Jesus said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for they shall be filled you got to you you got to hunger and thirst for it amen in the Book of Luke amen the Bible says in Luke 5 And1 it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God listen friends the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God and brother Bram picks that up he said they pressed on him to hear the word it shows that they were hungry see you can't interest people for food until they get hungry but when they get hungry then they can really talk about food and that's the way it is amen if you're if you're not interested in God you can't talk god to the people but whenever they get to hungering and thirsting after righteousness amen God said they shall be filled but there first has to be a hunger you got to really want it he said listen friends I I've heard amen already of how God's been moving in these services and amen how right from the very beginning amen that the spirit of God was dealing with the hearts and speaking to people amen I tell you what friends amen that don't happen except somebody's praying somewhere amen except somebody got hungry amen somebody out of Desire come on Friends amen it's got to be more than just amen a preacher amen studying in his office amen it's got to be more than just a preacher praying amen and asking God Amen Let Me Find Your Will Amen Let Me Find Your Mind amen somebody's got to be praying in the Pew somebody's got to be praying at home somebody's got to have a desire to see more to see God move to hear God speak hallelujah amen I tell you what butd I tell you if people start hungering and thirsting after God amen you get a church that gets hungry you get people that start praying amen you get somebody that desires to see God move I tell you all hell cannot stop a Revival from striking that church I don't I don't care what kind of situations come I don't care what kind of church problems rise up even nothing will stop a Revival from striking that church because where there's a Hungry Heart there's a promise Hal Hallelujah if you're hungry he will fill [Applause] youall he said you got to want it kind of puts me in because that word hunger there in the Greek it means to suffer want to be needy means to Crave to seek something with an eager desire I started reading that I thought of what brother Brown said about thirst yeah amen and there in the message thirst he said I looked up the word he said it means a painful desire amen a painful desire amen listen amen and and David talks about it in Psalms 42 he said as a heart panth amen that means a longing amen as a heart panth after the water Brook so panth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God hallelujah amen When shall I come and appear before God Amen listen I love David amen because David said my soul thirst my soul amen panth after the amen after God Amen but he didn't just want David wasn't just want to hear a story amen about something God once was or something God once did that ain't what David was thirsty for come on friends that ain't what David was amen was longing to see he said my soul thirsted after God after the Living God hallelujah David wanted to see a God that was alive David wanted to know a God that was real amen David wanted to see him in his power amen David wanted to experience the supernatural hallelujah hallelujah in verse seven of the same chapter says in deep call it under deep at the noise of thy water spouts yes all thy waves and thy Billows are going over me amen deep calling to deep Amen brother bam amen picks that up and he said if there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond amen and brother bam would make it uh just gives such a a beautiful example of it he talks about a little boy amen is eating erasers off the pencils and amen his mother sent him out there chewing on a bicycle pedal and and they thought there's something bad wrong with this child and they took him down to the doctor and they examined the boy and they found out that he was lacking something amen he needed sulfur his body was crying out for it amen and so therefore he was amen he was getting that sulfur out of the Eraser and off that bicycle pedal amen why amen but there was something in him calling for that and brother Brown said if there was something in him that was calling for it there had to be something out there Amen to answer that to fulfill that to satisfy that desire and the prophet of God took that and said amen and therefore I can say this amen if there's something in your heart that's crying out for more of God there's got to be more of God for you to have tonight if there's something in your heart tonight that's saying there's more yeah Hallelujah I'm not satisfied just a church member I'm not satisfied with just a church experience I'm not satisfied with a l to see a testimony there's more hallelujah amen and if there's something in you crying out for more of God there's more of God for you to [Applause] have Hallelujah I propos that if there's something in your heart crying out for the Holy Ghost he said there's got to be a fountain filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen and he said if there's something in you crying out for he said the holy spirit is obligated to lead you to that thank you Lord he goes on to say he says how many in here believes in Divine Healing he said amen if you believe in let's to see your hands he said thank you if you believe there's something in you that says there's healing somewhere then there's bound to be a Creator that's created that desire and as sure as there is a desire in your heart to be healed by Divine Healing there's a fountain open somewhere that's just all amen you could never have the desire unless there would be something to fulfill that he said remember not long ago the church had got cold and formal and everything but the people begin to crave more of God and the baptism of the Holy Spirit come into existence you see amen you're hungering and thirsting for more of God as long as you have that thirst listen friends what's the prophet showing amen every Revival is connected to a hunger amen every move of God is connected to a hunger brother Bram said watch Amen in every age amen the people amen listen there would God would send a message through a messenger and the people there would there would be a great Revival amen but then the people would begin to amen denominate and amen then they would begin to take that amen those things and and they would begin to you know build denominational walls and so forth amen and the Revival would die off and amen but but the prophet of God said amen but you watch he said when the people will begin to come back and line themselves back up with the word word and cry out to God God would send a fresh Revival a fresh anointing hallelujah amen he said that's what brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the scene amen somebody got hungry somebody started reading in the Bible and they said listen amen the Church of today don't look like the Church of the book of Acts amen but if God did it then he can do it again Hallelujah amen and I'm telling you this amen they might be getting cold and the churches might be getting cold and even it might be coming right in our own ranks amen but I tell you there's a people somewhere Hallelujah I said there's a bride somewhere amen and she's hungry and she's craving and there's a longing and there's a [Applause] desire hallelujah amen amen and what God did in the Bible he'll do it [Applause] again the God of this message is still the same Hebrews 138 is still a [Applause] reality listen friends hunger will move you right yeah h hunger amen hunger is a powerful thing amen you can look all through the scripture see all kind of examples in this Bible amen God will allow famine or there'll be some kind of drought or a condition something would take place and God would use it to move his people into the position can I just say it this way amen what brought amen Israel down into Egypt in the days of of Joseph amen they be they got hungry amen and it was their hunger that brought them into the presence of Joseph amen not only did it bring them to the right place amen it brought them in the right attitude because if you get hungry enough amen you lose all your pride come on friends you get hungry enough you don't come on your terms you come in humility amen your hunger will cause you to obey listen that hunger brought them down there to Joseph but that same hunger also made them obey the instructions of Joseph amen amen because they knew there's only one place there's only one source there's only one place that has bread amen and that Joseph had that bread I'm just going to say this tonight and I know the devil don't like it a lot of people don't like it amen but I'm going to say there still ain't but one source there's only listen if you want to escape the tribulation if you want to go in a Rapture there's only one place you can get rapture in faith and it ain't in the Baptist church amen it ain't in the Methodist Church it ain't in the theology amen of man in this hour amen there's only one source of rapturing Faith that's the message of this hour it's the bread of life [Applause] hallelujah amen amen it's the only place that a hungry Soul can be [Applause] fed Hall sir you get hungry enough amen it'll cause you to come to the to the to the storehouse in humility and follow the instruction whatever you say that's what I'm going to do amen because I got to eat Hallelujah hunger will move you Matthew chapter 12 the Bible says at that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the corn and it is disciples were hungered and they begin to pluck the ears of corn and eat but when the Pharisees saw it they said unto him Behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day but he said unto them have you not read what David did when he was hungered and they that were with him how he entered into the house of God and did eat the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for them that were with him but it was only for the priest amen watch amen it was it was the disciples hunger that caused them to pluck the corn and eat it on the Sabbath and them Pharisees standing by begin to criticize them and say Amen how dare they eat the corn on the Sabbath day even brother bham talks about it he said a Jewish man come to him and said amen I proed to you by the scripture that Jesus was a thief wow brother Brown said what do you mean he said cuz he was eating corn on the Sabbath day amen and Jesus amen Amen brother Bown said what you don't understand is he's the lord of the Harvest amen this man was trying to amen bring an accusation that they were taking something that didn't belong to them amen but brother Bram gives an answer and said listen It All Belongs to him he's the lord of the Harvest amen but really and truly the real problem they had was that they were eating a corn on the Sabbath day amen but brother Brown watch cuz brother Brown also tells him he said look even in your own laws amen if a man was hungry he could go into a field amen it didn't have to be his field he could go in his neighbor's field and he could eat until his soul was until he was satisfied he couldn't gather amen the man's Harvest amen and take it home with him but if he was hungry and he was walking through a field amen he could take from that field until he was satisfied right Hallelujah and Jesus looks at them Pharisees and said didn't you read in the scripture amen where David because he got hungry one day he went down to the to the house of God and David said have you got any bread and they said we ain't got no common bread amen we ain't got no bread that you can eat amen but David said listen friends amen that should have been enough amen and in any other day any other time amen David would asked that question they said listen we ain't got no common bread amen we ain't got nothing amen for you amen David would just moved on but the hunger that was in his heart amen caused him to press the matter amen and he would not leave amen he said ain't you got some bread and they said well the bread we got Hallelujah is only for a special chosen generation Hallelujah and there was all kind of people and all kind of voices and all kind of things that was saying David you

Hungry Heart sitting in the church Hallelujah church I want to tell you something tonight amen if if it's that way on the negative because you know why there's so many false doctrines in the land today it's because there's a bunch of people out there that's got itching ears that can't endure sound Doctrine and they're craving and hungry amen for false doctrines and fairy tales and fables and come on church amen there's a calling for that there's a desire for that so there's a supply it's called supply and demand there's a demand and there's a supply but just as sure as there's a demand for false Doctrine and false teaching there's a demand somewhere for the pure word of God there's a Hungry Heart somewhere come on church it's little churches scattered all over this country all over the globe of hungry Hearts it might just be a handful over here and a handful over there but anywhere there's a Hungry Heart God is obligated to [Applause] satis he'll send somebody to the pull pit on to preach the absolute truth hallelujah amen because you're crying out for it all right let me try to bring this down to a close tonight I want to show you another hunger Mark 11 in verse 12 the Bible says and on the mar when they were come from Bethany he was hungry he speaking of the Lord now he's hungry and see in a fig tree a far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat of the fruit of thee Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it listen I think this is amazing because and I don't want to spend a lot of time right here but I do want to just stop and say this Jesus now is coming to this tree because he's hungry and when he comes to this tree and and and we'll get into it a little bit more but you know a lot of times a lot of times we we justify the tree even brother Brandon would say you can't blame the tree cuz it wasn't the time see Amen in one place he would say that way can't blame because the Bible says it wasn't the time of fix you see so but but it's always I've always pondered that I've always wondered why would Jesus curse a tree for having no fruit right right when it wasn't the time but see his hunger had moved him yeah and he had saw the leaves of the tree and he saw the tree in its beauty and amen and there was life in the tree and and and and and because of the hunger that he had it moved him to the tree he was and he went there even hoping to find fruit that would satisfy amen the desire the hunger that he had and when he come to the tree amen finding no fruit the Bible said he cursed the tree he said no man eat of thee forever amen what and he cursed that tree and watch what brother Bram would even take that when Jesus cursed the tree amen and and the prophet of God said notice he cursed it from the roof Roots amen and one place that he said it this way he said he put his faith against the life that was in that tree listen I want to tell you something when Jesus cursed that tree nothing changed Jesus cursed the tree the leaves didn't immediately fall off the tree come on the tree didn't just instantly amen fall over but it was dead the very minute that Jesus spoke to that tree it was dead amen because he cursed it from The Roots listen friends I want to tell you this is the difference between the power of God and the power of Satan because Satan was trying to destroy amen the the the the tree amen and brother BR would talk about the type Christ as the tree Amen in the restoration of the Bride tree and notice amen what was it he began to eat on the tree and he began to strip it from the fruits and then the leaves and then the bark and he began to gnaw it down and eat it down amen but listen friends he could never get to the life because the life was in The Roots Hallelujah and therefore no matter what Satan did to the tree there was always a promise of restoration Hallelujah he said he G Christ down until the was nothing but a stop he said but there was life in the roots and a promise in God's word I will restore sayith the Lord hallelujah hallelujah but when Jesus got ready to curse the tree amen he didn't start on the outside and and heated down to the inside he cursed The Roots he cursed the life watch what brother Ram said he said even the tree there he said all the saints in the world couldn't make one blade of grass do you know that they couldn't something looks like it see they can't find the formul formula of life that's God Jesus said to the tree curse be you you don't have any fruit and you'll never have any and they passed by there it was about 8:00 in the morning passed by amen as they were going later that dinner that day the prophet said as they were going to dinner Peter looked at the tree and said it's dead from The Roots up he said wow Jesus rebuked the life that was in The Roots and the whole thing died and then the prophet said Hallelujah that same Christ can re rebuke a cancer from the roots and the whole thing will die see the tree was standing there just the same as it was hours before but you couldn't find amen listen amen but you find out the leash begin to drop off amen and then you see the bark begin to peel off and wear away and day after day and week after week and after a while there wasn't one Speck of that tree left Hallelujah cancer tumors cataracts anything else will have to go when Christ speaks hallelujah amen cancers cataracts anything sickness amen I don't care what it is tonight when Christ [Music] speaks because he is not dealing with the symptoms he's dealing with the root of the problem come on friends I tell you that's the problem that we got amen a lot of times in the church all we do is try to fix the symptoms and amen we try to fix it over here and fix it over there what we need is a move of God we need the Holy Spirit to drop down amen and get to the root of the thing and get the life out of [Applause] it sir I'm telling you I've seen it so many times am mean you can you can have meeting after meeting and conference after conference yeah true try to solve all the problems yeah and one service the presence of God drop in and the Holy Spirit begins to [Music] move and God will begin to speak and he'll go right down to the root where the thing was hidden at and curse it from the root and then we all stand back and we're amazed how quickly the tree doth wither listen how quickly the problem does leave amen how quickly does the thing get turned around amen why because God has spoke sir Hallelujah Jesus was hungry I watch this I'm coming to a close you just all right give me just a just a couple minutes here because as Jesus walked by this tree listen this is Mark 11 he he he as he goes by this tree he comes to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple begin to cast them out that sold and bought in the temple over through the tables of the money Chambers the seed of them that sold does and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple and he taught saying unto them it is is it not written that my house shall be called of all Nations a House of Prayer but you've made it a dent of Thieves amen and the scribes and the chief priests heard it and they sought how that they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his Doctrine amen and when he evening was come they went out of of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remember saith unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou this curses withered away and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God Amen for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those things which he has said shall am me has says shall come to pass he shall have amen he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you whatsoever soever ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them amen I want you to catch the contents of this scripture now Jesus is coming to a to a fig Tre he's being moved there by hunger he's got a desire amen to eat of the tree listen and and I want to just tell you tonight amen as I said many times we justify the Fig Tree because it wasn't the season but I want to say if that if there was ever an opportunity that a tree had it was in that moment that fig tree had the greatest opportunity of his existence because the master had come and Jesus was hungry and listen friends I want to tell you something tonight amen we justify the tree because it wasn't the season but we forget whose presence the tree was standing in on now hallelujah amen because I tell you this you say brother Josh what are you trying to say I'm trying to say this they took Aaron's Rod which was just a dead stick that had been cut down and they took it behind the veil in the presence of God and a dead stick in that presence begin to Blossom and Bloom and bring forth fruit and amen to maturity amen LZ is amen it didn't have to wait for amen a month amen it happened overnight amen a dead stick that had been cut down brought forth fruit overnight with that in mind amen I give no justification to the victory that Jesus come through Jesus was hungry Hallelujah and his presence should have brought fruit on the tree hallelujah amen just so you know I ain't pulling this out the air listen what the prophet of God said he said the old dead that was brought Rod that was brought into in there and was laid in the presence of God himself what happened it budded and blossomed and yeld and yielded fruit showing amen that amen amen that we amen listen friend the rod amen was off of an almond tree listen amen this is another part of it you got to catch amen that Dead stick amen could not produce something that it was not a part of to start [Applause] with yes sir it only brought out of it what it was what it was originally connected to to begin with come on [Music] now God brother Brown said he said he said see he said it was cut off he said and when man was cut cut off from God he died spiritually but once it was brought into the place of God before the presence of God
