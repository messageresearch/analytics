The 12 disciples of my road sign, [music and singing] and Jesus will see me [music] safely through. There be [singing] no geos in hell and no [singing] rough road along the way. [music] I'm [singing] using my Bible for a road map. [music] My life stop is having some [music] sweet day. I'm using [singing] my [music] Bible for road pound. The children of Israel used it too. [music] They crossed [singing] the Red Sea of destruction. [music] For God was there to see them [music and singing] through. I'll be no gators [singing] in heaven and no rough roads along the way. I'm using my Bible [music and singing] for a road map. My last stop is heaven some sweet [music and singing] day.

Amen. Praise the Lord. Happy to be here today. You know, my wife came to me last night and she showed me your announcement and it right down at the bottom it said casual dress for the service. That is one of the hardest things for me to do. [laughter] Ever since I was a little boy, I had to wear a coat and tie to church. Then I got in sales and I had to wear a coat and tie. So, I feel undressed. But I'm happy to be here casual and all. Amen. I'm gonna I'm gonna sing that little song. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. First, is it all right if I give a little testimony? You know, uh, I've been studying over the last year or so. The prophet of God said, "The way for a for the Gentile to receive from God is to receive it as the word's going forth." And I've thought about that and I've thought about that, but it seems like we very seldom see that. Although we may be, we just don't see it. It may happen. But um earlier this year for a couple months I had a problem with my leg. Couldn't walk in pain. Just really a lot of pain. I thought well going to have to go get a hip replacement or something. But you know I've been thinking about that that quote. And so I started going to church and every service I'd come I'd come out of that service expecting to be healed because I heard the word go forth. That's what he said. And I mean 8 weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks. And I had to get I I had to get relief because I had to travel to Spain to preach a convention and then we were going from there to Portugal to preach and uh I just needed to be able to walk. So about I think it was 10 days before I was to leave for Europe, I was in uh the Hardy meetings with brother Benuit. They had a prayer line and brother uh Daryl Ward and brother my pastor, brother Josh Bennett was there and as I went through that prayer line, they laid hands on me and I just felt like I was healed all of a sudden. &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't really know for sure. I didn't have any pain anymore. But I went home and they was having a graduation party for one of the boys in the church. They was in a gym. They said, "Come on, brother Kenny. Play basketball with us." And you know, I didn't give it a second thought. I said, "Sure, I'll come." You know what? I had no pain. Have no pain since then. But I I thank God and I thank God for the words of a prophet. Know sometimes if WE WOULD JUST APPLY those words, we'd be no telling what we could receive. &gt;&gt; So I'm thank God for that. Just help me sing this if you know it. Well, glory, glory. Hallelujah. Since I laid my burdens down. Well, glory, glory. [music] Well, hallelujah. [singing] Since I laid my burdens down. [singing and music] Well, I am feeling so much better. [music] Since I [singing] laid my burdens down, well, I am feeling so [music] much better. [singing] Since I laid my burdens down, [music] well, glory, glory. Oh, hallelujah. Since I laid [singing] my burdens down, [music] well, glory, glory. [singing] Hallelujah. Since I laid my burdens [music and singing] down, well, I am feeling so much better. Since I lay [singing] [music] my burdens down. Well, I'm feeling [music] so much better. [singing] Since I laid my burdens down. Well, glory, [music] glory. Hallelujah. Since I laid my burdens down. [music] Well, glory, glory. [singing] Hallelujah. Since I laid [music] burdens down, well, I'm thankful [music] for the message. [singing] Since I laid [music] those burdens down, well, I'm so thankful for the message. [singing] [music] Since I laid my burdens down. Oh, glory, [music and singing] glory. Hallelujah. Since I laid [music] my burdens down, well, go. [singing] Hallelujah. Since I laid those burdens down. [singing and music] Hallelujah. God bless you. [applause] It ain't nothing. [music] It ain't nothing for you. [singing] I may stumble, [music] stumble in everything I do. Oh, [singing] I may worry, hold my [music] breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. [music] It ain't nothing for you. Now [singing] the children [music] had their backs to that Red Sea. And oh Pharaoh, [singing] it looked like he [music] had the victory, but the waters rolled on [music] back with the [singing] breath you blew. And it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. [singing] Oh Joshua, he took a [music] walk around Jero. [singing] And Lord, you told him, [music] you told him that the wall would go. Oh, and it crumbled [music] at the shout when the trumpets blew. And [singing] it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing [music] for you. Oh, [singing] it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for [music] you. Oh, I may falter, stumble in everything I do. [music] [singing] Oh, I may worry, hold my breath till my face [singing] turns blue. But it [music] ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. [singing] Now I was lonely. Sin [music] had broken my heart in two. Oh, all the pieces [singing] I couldn't [music] mend with the strongest glue. But Lord Jesus, you took the pieces [singing] and made me new. Oh, it ain't nothing. Can we sing that [music] fifth verse now? Now this body, it's slowly dying without [music] him. But I ain't worried though. The skin worms eat [music] my skin. Oh, cuz you'll heaven's doors and I'll walk right [music and singing] in. Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh, [singing] it ain't nothing. [music] It ain't nothing for you. Oh, [singing] I may falter, [music] stumble in everything I do. Oh, I may worry and [singing] hold my [music] breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It ain't. Can we sing it again now? Oh, [singing and music] it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Can you stand? Oh, I may falter, [music] stumble in everything I do. Careful. I may we hold my breath till my face turns [music] blue. But it ain't [singing] nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh, it ain't nothing. [singing] It ain't nothing [music] for you. I may falter, stumble in everything I [music] do. Oh, [singing] I may worry, hold my breath till my face turns blue. But it ain't nothing. [singing] [music] It ain't nothing for you. Now this body, it's slowly dying without him. But I [music] ain't worried though. The skin worms eat my skin. Oh, cuz you'll open [music] heaven's [singing] doors and I'll walk right in. Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't [music] one more time as our pastor comes. [singing] Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. I may fall [music] st my face turns blue but it ain't nothing. Well, aren't you glad for that? Can we sing [music] it once again? Oh, [singing] it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh, I may falter, [music and singing] stumble in everything I do. And I may worry, hold my breath till my face [music] turns blue. But it [singing] ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Well, can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise? [applause and music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. I tell you what, there is nothing that God cannot do. &gt;&gt; He's just God. Amen. I tell you, I I know, you know, fear is striking the land and and the spirit of fear tries to get on the people of God, but you know, we ain't got nothing to be afraid about. &gt;&gt; We got a bright future and there ain't nothing that the devil can do to stop us. And I tell you, I I appreciate you giving that testimony, Brother Kenny. Amen. And I believe that's just how we receive things from God is just simply believe. If God said it, I think sometimes we we look if we think, well, the word, you know, we look for someone to give a word in prophecy, you know, or someone to speak something, you know, in a vision or or in a dream, and we look that to be the word. But the word has been preached every service. Every time you're listening to them tapes, the word is being preached. Every time a man of God stands behind the pulpit, the word is being preached. Why not expect it what you need? &gt;&gt; Get what you need. The word is that powerful. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Well, do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; You can be seated for just a moment. I just want to say um uh we just uh appreciate all the you visitors for coming. Amen. and being part of our service and our day and looking forward to a a wonderful time of fellowship uh today and um um and looking forward to a wonderful time today as as uh the man of God getting ready to to preach the word of the Lord to us. And you know, it it don't matter how simple or how deep or whatever. The word of God is powerful. &gt;&gt; And we we know that it's it's it's not a man that just just decides to have a gift. It's God that puts that gift in that man. And because God wants to speak through him to the people. And um I I don't believe that this service is by accident. And um um I don't believe that um that Josh is here today uh to preach to us by accident. I just believe that God wants to speak to us. And um and so what we are been taught by the prophet is just pull on the gift. Amen. And and look beyond the veil of flesh and just say, "God, you know my needs. You know exactly where I'm at. would you just minister to me today? And I've had God do that many times. And uh that's just where God is. He He knows exactly where we're at. And we may say, "Well, I I'm just so dark in a in a dark situation that God just doesn't know." He knows exactly where you're at, &gt;&gt; and he knows how to meet that need. And and so we want Brother Josh just to um uh take his liberty. uh brother uh be my nephew Josh Martin and want him to take his liberty. But I do want to say I appreciate those of you that have driven uh a ways uh to come and uh make this uh a good day for us. And we just always love company and uh we we'll try to treat you u well we'll we'll we'll try to treat you in a way you don't want to leave. Amen. and uh maybe you'll take some fire with you and and share it to your church and wherever you're at and uh but we can just stand to our feet. Let's just sing this that little song. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You are worthy to be praised and adored. Amen. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. [music] You are worthy [singing] to be praised and adored. [music] So we lift up. Aren't you glad you can lift up holy [music] hands who made you holy? It's a holy God that's living in you. [music] Oh, blessed be the [singing] name. Blessed [music] be the name of the Lord. Sing it unto him. Oh, [singing] blessed [music] be the name of the Lord. You are [singing] worthy to be [music] praised and adored. So we lift [music and singing] up holy hands. Yes. [singing and music] Singing blessing. So be [music and singing] the name of the Lord. Can we sing that one more time now? Be [music and singing] the name. It's worthy to be praised [music] and [singing] adored. Lift up holy hands [singing] [music] one accord. Blessed [singing] be the name. [music] Blessed be the name. Blessed be [singing] the name of [music] the Lord. Amen. I trust you have a praise upon your lips this morning. [music] Amen. I believe God's been good to us. blessed us with unsearchable riches. [music] And I believe that as brother Brandon would say, if he never did one more thing for me, he's already done enough for me. And I believe that that's our confession as well. He saved our souls, filled us with the Holy Ghost, given us a message that has placed us in our inheritance. And I believe if anybody has a right to praise the Lord, it's the bride [music] of Christ. Amen. Well, God bless you this morning. It's it's good to be with y'all today. appreciate the opportunity [music] and invitation to be ministering this morning. I pray something can be said to be a blessing. But if you would have your scriptures, let's open our Bibles to 1 Peter 1:1 and we'll read that down to the second verse in Galatians 3 and28. It's good to have my traveling companions with me, Brother Aaron and Brother Devin. Uh, we have a me and my wife, we have a two-week old baby back home. And so she's not traveling with me at this time, but I got my nephew Aaron and a young man from our church, Brother Devon's traveling with me. And so they're they're definitely making the trip exciting. And so it's good to have them with me. And I do bring greetings from our home church, the saints there, New Life Outreach, and our pastor, Bill Wendle, sends their greetings as well. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter 1 and1 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered throughout Punctus Galatia Capidosia Asia and Bethyleneia elect according to the fornowledge of God the father through the sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied in Galatians 3 and28 and there is neither Jew nor Greek Greek, there is neither bond nor free. There is neither male nor female. For ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you be Christ, then you're Abraham's seed and heir according to the promise. Amen. Can we bow our heads this morning? Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, how humbled we are by your presence that we feel this morning, Lord. God, we ask that you would just feel welcome here among us, Lord, and everything that is said and done, Father. Lord, you know the needs and the desires of your people that are gathered together here. Lord, I ask, Father, as I lay myself aside, Lord, may you anoint your servant. Father, as the word would come forth, Father, may there be a heart to receive it today, Lord. We ask that you would just be pleased in everything that is said and done. Lord, we commit the service into your hands in Jesus' name. Amen. You may be seated this morning and I just have a simple thought but it would be elected strangers and uh and Peter is addressing this to the strangers that is scattered throughout these places and whenever you will look up the word stranger it's always connected with the words pilgrim or souljourner and you can look the children of Israel was always likened unto pilgrims you can look at Leviticus 25 and 23 the land shall will not be sold forever, for the land is mine. For ye are strangers and sojourers with me. Even in the New Testament, Hebrews 11:13, these all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. And so, I believe that that so were we. I believe we are we've been called to not fit in with Leo. We're we're walking in it, but we're not a part of it. And I believe God has called us to be a pilgrim. And brother Brandon would say this here, a little something you might look at in the scripture. Those who sought this new city acted different. They professed that they were pilgrims and strangers, but on the side of Cain, they become fugitives and renegades. But Christians were pilgrims and strangers. A fugitive has no home. A renegade is a horrible person. But a pilgrim is something real from a real land in another nation trying to find his way home, professing by his living that he has something that is from another country. And I like how brother Brandham is describing that that a pilgrim has something from another land. He might not be in that land, but he's professing by his living or his actions that he has something from another land. And I believe that's the difference between serpent seed and the bride of Christ. Cuz brother Brandon would tell us and the Bible would tell us that that Cain would be called a renegade and a fugitive, which that would be the the line of the serpent seed. But we're not renegades and fugitives. We're pilgrims and we're strangers because we have something that has claimed our life. And and it's incredible because you can look at serpents. See, they they have no direction. They have no future. And they would like to think they have a future, but once they go by the way of the grave, what's their future then? But I believe that we have a faith walk like Abraham. You can talk to an unbeliever and if the stock market goes down, they're depressed. Or if a family member goes to by the way of the grave, now we're never going to see him again. But you see, I believe there's a certainty that the bride of Christ has that separates us from the serpent seed. And that's why I love Jeremiah 29 and 11 so much. For I know the thoughts that are think towards you, sayaeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you and expected in. So we have an expectation that we are striving for. We might not have much we can point to here, but we have a vision over our lives that we are striving to obtain. So there's an expectation that this word has given us in. We have a direction. You can look at 1 Thessalonians 4:17. For then with which we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we be ever be with the Lord. Wherefore, comfort one another with these words. In other words, when this word comes, you can comfort yourself with it. Whenever the other that the the world might be falling apart, there's a certainty in the words of life that we can point back to. Even if I go by the way of the grave or if a family member goes by the way of the grave, there's a comfort in knowing our OUR FUTURE IS IN CONCRETE. And I believe that no matter what we go through, our future is still in concrete. AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE STRIVING TO obtain is a future that God has given us. And I believe that once we know our future, it gives us an ambition. It gives us something that we're striving for. BECAUSE MANY times whenever you look at a you look at a pilgrim or somebody that that is st a souljourner, you think of somebody that has no direction. You think of somebody that is just roaming to and fro, you know, trying to find a place called home. But in reality, a souljourer normally has more of a direction than that of the locals. Cuz you can look at the children of Israel. They had a direction. But once they got into the promised land, what would they say? GIVE US A KING that we can fit in like the other ones. They were no longer sojourers, BUT NOW THEY WERE BECOMING COMFORTABLE. And too many times we become comfortable with where we are at and we lose our ambition. But I believe that this message has given us an ambition that our direction is clear and we cannot become lazy with it. You know, Brother Brandham would tell us that if you don't have a purpose, you're just going to float around. He would talk about the homeless man that would come and knock on his door and ask for something to eat. Y'all remember the story? And Brother Brandham would bring him in, give him a sandwich, and say, "Where you going?" The man would say, "Oh, nowhere." He says, "Well, WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?" "OH, NOWHERE." Brother Brandham says, "How long have you been doing this?" He said, "About about 20 years." And wherever my I lay my hat is, that's where I caught home. Brother Brandham says he had no ambition. He had no NOTHING TO STRIVE TO STRIVE FOR. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM then would TELL US TOO MANY TIMES Christians get that way and we become driftwood. He says we're just we're we're just being pushed by this trash pile, pushed by that. He says we're going by the the stream of life and too many times we become driftwood. But then he says you can look at a boat that's coming down the same stream of life and it's something is powering it. He says, "WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE between driftwood and that boat? They're made out of the same kind OF MATERIAL, BUT THAT THAT THAT BOAT HAS A MOTOR BEHIND IT THAT IS PUSHING IT." AND YOU'RE IN FLESH JUST LIKE THE SERPENT SEAT IS. BUT WHAT IS PUSHING YOU AND GIVING YOU COMFORT IN THE TIME OF OF STRUGGLE, GIVING YOU A A DIRECTION IN THE TIME OF CONFUSION? YOU'VE GOT AN AMBITION BEHIND YOU THAT IS PUSHING YOU DOWN THE STREAM OF LIFE. EVEN WHEN YOU GET HUNG UP MAYBE BY SOME DRIFTWOOD, THERE'S A POWER BEHIND YOU THAT KEEPS PUSHING YOU ON. YOU MIGHT SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT, BUT THAT POWER IS STILL PUSHING ON. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT AN AMBITION IS. EVEN WHEN you get wore out, YOU GET TIRED, THAT AUTHORITY BEHIND YOU IS ALWAYS pushing you on. Hallelujah. And we can look how the natural always types the spiritual. So if A NATURAL PILGRIM HAS TO HAVE AN AMBITION, WHAT ABOUT A SPIRITUAL PILGRIM? And brother Brandham was saying, she said, "Well, then we're not Americans. What are we?" I said, "Our kingdom is is of above." You see, we are free. We're born again. The kingdom of God is within you. See, ACT LIKE UP THERE. You're delegates from there. I said, "We're citizens here, living here in flesh, but our spirits, WE ARE PILGRIMS AND STRANGERS. WE ARE FOREIGN to the world now, even our own nation. FOR WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WHEN IT KNOCKED out our heart TO BECOME A PART of him and his word and the word fixes us and makes us live and makes us ACT LIKE CHRISTIANS. I THINK THAT'S A POWERFUL THING THAT IN [screaming] FLESH WE'RE CITIZENS HERE BUT OUR SPIRIT MAN HAS ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WHEN THE WORD HAS KNOCKED UPON OUR HEARTS WHICH MAKES US A SOULJOURNER AND A PILGRIM. YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES US FROM serpentry is they can confess with their lips, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR FROM THEM. BUT THE BRIDE DON'T JUST HAVE A CONFESSION, BUT THEY HAVE ACTIONS BEHIND IT THAT I'M NOT JUST PROFESSING SOMETHING, BUT I'm acting at it. I'M ACTING OUT THE VISION THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US. And Jesus would say this here in Matthew 15:8, "This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honorth me with their lips, BUT THEIR HEART is far from me. and in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. And so accepting the invitation of the word is more than a sinner's prayer. IT'S OPENING UP EVERY AVENUE OF THE HEART AND SAYING THIS WORD IS MY ABSOLUTE. And it's incredible CUZ BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TELL US that and he would read Revelations 3 and we say behold I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and and open the door I will come in and suck with him. HE WOULD TELL US THAT'S THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH. The church is on the out or Christ IS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH KNOCKING. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE HE'S giving an opportunity. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TELL US THAT GOD don't send judgment without warning. SO HERE CHRIST IS KNOCKING ON THE DOOR, BUT THERE'S NO CLAIMING. IT'S A WHOSOEVER WILL. IF ANY MAN WILL HEAR MY VOICE, LET HIM OPEN the door. And so HERE HE'S GIVING A CHURCH THE CHURCH A CHANCE. BUT THEY'RE BEING CONDITIONED BY REFUSING THE INVITATION WHEN IT'S KNOCKING ON THEIR DOOR. OPEN UP THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. THE BRIDE IS BEING CONDITIONED BY ACCEPTING THE INVITATION WHEN A KNOCKS UPON THEIR HEART. HALLELUJAH. Brother Brandon WOULD TELL US CHURCH MEMBERS want a denominational filter so they can have their own desire AND STILL BE CLASSIFIED RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. SO THEY'RE CONFESSING HIM, BUT THEY WANT TO HAVE THEIR OWN DESIRE, THEIR THEIR OWN FILTER. BUT THE BRIDE OF CHRIST HAS ONE AMBITION THAT IS HEAVENS AND EARTH MAY PASS AWAY. BUT THIS WORD WILL NEVER FAIL. WHERE WOULD WE GO? FOR THOU HAST THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE. THAT IS OUR AMBITION. THAT IS OUR FUTURE. THAT IS OUR DIRECTION. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE STRIVING FOR. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TELL US IF you want to see the condition of the church, look at the women, right? He would say it's a a women's world and they have the rights. And and it's incredible how brother Brandon would see these things. He would SAY THAT THE FEMALES DON'T want to have a they don't want to have children no more. They want to have cats and they want to have dogs because if they have a child, it's going to deform their body, make their bodies ugly. They can't go to the clubs with a a NURSING BABY. IT'S INCREDIBLE CUZ RIGHT BEFORE THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE church and he says the church is pregnantated with something. He says because they're BRINGING FORTH MEMBERS ALL OF THE TIME BUT THEY DON'T WANT THESE ACTS 238 BABBLING HOLLERING SCREAMING CHILDREN. BUT HE SAYS THAT'S THE ONLY KIND THAT THE CHURCH WILL PRODUCE. SO WHAT IS IT? THEY'RE BEING CONDITIONED BY SOMETHING BUT SO IS THE BRIDE. WHAT IS SHE BEING CONDITIONED FOR? IT'S TIME FOR TRANSLATION. IT'S TIME FOR A RAPTURE. AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN STEP INTO THE RAPTURE IS TO BE CONDITIONED. AND HOW DO WE BECOME CONDITIONED? BY ACCEPTING THE WORD WHEN IT KNOCKS UPON THEIR HEART. BROTHER BRANDON would say this. He talks about the church how that she's a how she don't want these the uh the these tongue talkers in Acts 2:38 kind of children. BUT THEN HE SAYS THIS, NOTICE THIS CHARACTER. WHEN YOU SEE A WOMAN JUST GO ON THE RAMPAGE, JUST DO anything they want to do. WATCH THE CHURCH is doing the same thing. NOTICE, BUT WATCH WHEN THE SPIRITUAL BRIDE WHEN SHE BEGINS TO HAVE A REVIVAL. WHEN SHE BEGINS TO COME BACK AND LINE HERSELF UP WITH THE WORD, WATCH THEN. AND YOU'LL SEE HOW THE SCRIPTURE AT THIS TIME THERE'LL BE A MESSAGE SWEEP OUT TO CATCH THE BRIDE TO CATCH THAT WOMAN ELECT. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE A STRANGER, BUT WE'RE AN ELECTED STRANGER. WE MIGHT NOT FIT IN WITH THE WORLD, BUT THERE'S AN ELECTED SEED ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR [screaming] HEART THAT WHEN THE WORD COMES ACROSS, YOU SAY YES AND AMEN. THAT IS WHERE I CAME FROM. I COME FROM GOD AND I'M GOING BACK TO GOD. IT'S A DEEP CALLING TO A DEEP. BUT THEN YOU CAN READ THERE IN JOHN 10:27. MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE AND I KNOW THEM AND THEY FOLLOW ME. IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S THREE THINGS IN THIS VERSE THAT REALLY STRIKES MY HEART. THIS AIN'T A WHOSOEVER WILL. MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE. IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S A CLAIMING. IT'S NOT A WHOSOEVER WILL, LET HIM COME. OR I'M KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. IF ANY MAN HEAR MY VOICE AND OPEN THE DOOR, I WILL COME IN AND S WITH HIM. THIS IS A CLAIMING. THERE'S MANY VOICES OUT THERE. THERE'S MANY ATTRACTIONS OUT THERE. BUT MY SHEEP IS GOING TO HEAR [screaming] MY VOICE. HALLELUJAH. HOW COME? BECAUSE HE SAYS AND I KNOW THEM. SO THE VERY REASON THE VOICE HAS COME IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THERE WAS A A SEED TO RECEIVE IT. SO THAT'S THE REASON HE CAN BE SO CONFIDENT MY VOICE OR MY SHEEP WILL HEAR MY VOICE IS BECAUSE I KNOW THEM AND I PREDESTINATED HIM TO RECEIVE THE WORD WHEN IT COMES ACROSS THEIR PATH. HALLELUJAH. THE CHURCH WORLD HAS KICKED ME OUT OF THE CHURCHES. KICKED ME out of the PULL PITS. KICK ME OUT OF THE HOMES, BUT MY SHEEP IS GOING TO HEAR MY VOICE. HALLELUJAH. BROTHER BRAND, I'M GOING TO SAY THIS HERE. THE BRIDE IS ELECTED of God. The church goes through, that's the ones that says, "WHOSOEVER WILL, LET HIM COME." BUT THE BRIDE IS THE ELECTED OF GOD. SO, YOU'RE NOT A WHOSOEVER WILL JUST HOPING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. JUST HOPING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE THE WORD. BUT YOU ARE ELECTED of God. HALLELUJAH. JOHN JOHN 8:47. He that IS OF GOD HEARETH GOD'S WORDS. YE THEREFORE HEAR THEM NOT BECAUSE YE ARE NOT OF GOD. AND SO IT'S SIMPLE. YOU YOU REALLY CAN'T MISTAKE THEM FOR NOT FOR FOR FOR OUR FAULT THEM FOR NOT ACCEPTING THE truth because THERE'S NO TRUTH IN THEM. You know even Judas not excarat would say you how come you you showeth yourself to us and not to the world or manifest yourself unto us and not unto the world. And Jesus answers the question, if a MAN LOVED ME, HE'LL KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS. IN OTHER WORDS, IF THERE'S A DESIRE THERE, I'M GOING TO MANIFEST MYSELF TO HIM BECAUSE THERE'S AN ATTRACTION to me. The rest OF THE WORLD DON'T HAVE THAT ATTRACTION, BUT YOU ARE AN ELECTED SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. AND SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM would say, "See, Jesus said, "My sheep know my voice. They know my word. They see it when it's vindicated for that age." And brother Branowwood would would talk about the parable that Jesus would give on how that how that the the kingdom of heaven is like a fisherman with the net, right? He throws THEM OUT AND HE CATCHES MANY, but he's only after the sheep, right? OR ONLY AFTER THE FISH. BUT THE BRANDON WOULD SAY he would dramatize it and would say that he YOU CAN THROW OUT THAT NET AND IT CATCHES ALL KINDS. He says he catches the water spider, it catches the snake, it catches the fish, and he says the water spider stays in there for about a week. BUT BEN SAYS, "WELL, I have to give up my pants." And he says, "Blop, IT GOES BACK INTO THE WATER." THE SERPENT SAYS, "YEP, THIS IS GREAT. IT'S IN THERE FOR ABOUT a week." And then it says, "I have to give up my clubs." And he says, "RIGHT AWAY, IT GOES RIGHT BACK INTO THE WATER." HE SAYS, "THE NET had nothing TO DO WITH IT. The net didn't make that A WATER SPIDER. IT DIDN'T MAKE THAT A SERPENT. THE NET DIDN'T EVEN MAKE A FISH A FISH, BUT IT WAS THROWN OUT THERE. IT ATTRACTED MANY, BUT IT ONLY CLAIMED THE FISH. HALLELUJAH. AND THIS MESSAGE HAS ATTRACTED MANY, BUT IT HAS ONLY CLAIMED THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT MY SHEEP WILL HEAR MY VOICE MEANS. IT'S A CLAIMING OVER YOUR [screaming] LIFE. YOU MIGHT HAVE MANY OTHER VOICES. YOU MIGHT HAVE MANY THINGS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, BUT I'M GOING TO CLAIM YOU BY MY VOICE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU. HALLELUJAH. I PREDESTINATED YOU FROM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, AND I'M GOING TO CLAIM YOU WITH MY MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S A CLAIM OVER OUR LIFE. BROTHER BRANDHAM must say, Lord, by your grace, your help, I CLAIM EVERY ONE OF THEM THAT hears this message. I claim them for God. I pray thee, Lord, both here this morning and those that were here on tape. And if there be a seed anywhere that's predestinated, Lord, to hear the word of this last day, MAY THEY COME IN NOW sweetly and humbly and lay the trophies down up the cross or the selves as a trophy of the grace of God that is CALLED THEM. AIN'T THAT POWERFUL? HE SAYS, "I CLAIM THEM." And and he says it in many different places. He would say, "Lord, I claim them for your glory." AND THEN HE WOULD STOP and would say, "Thim them that are here AND ALSO THEM THAT WILL HEAR THE TAPE." IN OTHER WORDS, THIS CALLING OR OR this claiming ain't just for those that were sitting IN THE MEETING, BUT IT'S FOR THOSE THAT WILL HEAR MY VOICE. I'M GOING TO CLAIM THEM. HE WOULD SAY IN ONE PLACE, I CLAIM THEM FOR YOUR PERSONAL TREASURE. HE SAYS, I CLAIM THEM IN ONE PLACE, THE TROPHIES OF YOUR WORD. In other words, he may have attracted MANY, BUT THEY'RE not trophies. Hallelujah. Remember the three pools? The first pull, IT ATTRACTED SOME. THE SECOND POOL ATTRACTED SOME, BUT THE THIRD PULL WAS ONLY FOR THE RAINBOW TROUT. IT WAS A CLAIMING. IT'S NOT FOR WHOSOEVER WILL. IT IS FOR THE VIRTUOUS BLOODB BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S A CLAIMING that we become trophies of the inh trophies of the invitation that is knocked on our heart. Brother, I'm going to say this here. They've raised up their hands. They believe you. They believe on him that sent you. They're accepting the word and I claim them. And Satan cannot BE AROUND THEM NO MORE. I CLAIM THEM FOR THE GOSPEL. HALLELUJAH. AND SO, HOW DO YOU BECOME CLAIMED by the message? You see, it's more than just hearing it. But it's YOU RECEIVING IT. AS you receive it, there's an ANCHOR THAT COMES ON THE INSIDE OF THAT HEART THAT HAS GIVEN YOU AN AMBITION. THOUGH THE WORLD MAY TURN AWAY, the friends MAY TURN AGAINST ME, I AM FOLLOWING this claiming. And the third part of that that verse that that really spoke to my heart is MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE AND I know them and they follow me. In other words, once there's a claiming, there's a submission. Hallelujah. AND NOW THAT BECOMES YOUR ABSOLUTE BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT JOHN 10:5. AND A STRANGER WILL THEY NOT FOLLOW but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers. So once YOU ARE CLAIMED BY the voice of God which I believe IS THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. ANY OTHER VOICE IS A STRANGER. You see cuz if you're a stranger to the world then the world becomes a stranger to you. CUZ TOO MANY TIMES THE WORLD AIN'T A STRANGER TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A STRANGER TO THEM. YOU'RE TRYING TO FIT IN. YOU'RE TRYING TO DRESS LIKE THEM. YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK LIKE THEM. YOU'RE TRYING TO ACT LIKE THEM. AND NOW THE VOICES OF THE WORLD IS NO LONGER A STRANGER TO YOU. BUT ONCE YOU'RE CLAIMED BY ACCEPTING THIS MESSAGE, THEN THEY BECOME A STRANGER TO YOU. THAT WHEN THE VOICES COME TO YOU, YOU SAY, "NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M CLAIMED BY. I'M NOT CLAIMED BY LEGACY. I'M NOT CLAIMED BY FORMALISM. I'M NOT CLAIMED BY LUKEWARMNESS. I'M CLAIMED BY THE VOICE OF ALMIGHTY GOD THAT HAS COME IN THIS GENERATION. HALLELUJAH. AND THAT IS WHAT OUR DIRECTION IS. You remember brother Brandham was in the Middle East and he he would be driving at a four-way stop I believe or riding and there would come a a herd of sheep that was coming through and there was a SHEPHERD THAT WAS GUIDING HIM. BUT BRANDON SAYS IT WAS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE ALL THE ALL OF THE CARS COME TO A STOP BECAUSE THESE SHEEP WERE COMING THROUGH THE ROAD and he looked and he seen a market, right? And he says the market ain't like our markets here. It's out on the pavement. And he says once those SHEEP BEGIN TO SEE ALL the produce, ALL OF THAT BREAD, they're going to go crazy. And he says as he was watching them, THEY WENT RIGHT THROUGH THAT MARKET. NEVER LOOKED TO THE LEFT or to the right. He says they were looking at ONE THING AND THAT WAS THE SHEPHERD. AND HE STOPPED AND HE SAYS, I WANTED TO PREACH A SERMON RIGHT THERE. WHAT IS IT? MY SHEEP WILL HEAR MY VOICE AND A STRANGER THEY WILL NOT FOLLOW. THAT'S WHY THIS BRIDE HAS A HAS A DIRECTION BECAUSE THEIR EYES IS ON ONE THING AND THAT IS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. That is thus sayaeth the Lord. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A WATER SPIDER AND AND I think this quote is pretty pretty powerful. Brother Brandon would say you see a scripture and you see it here and here and here and here and you ask your pastor about it and he says, "Oh, that's that that was for another day. If you're a child of God, you won't believe that." No, sir. When it said Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever, the works that I do shall ye do also. See, what he was here, what he was there, he is here. And the pastor SAYS, "OH, THAT'S NONSENSE. THERE'S NOTHING TO THAT." HE SAYS, "YOU won't believe it BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A SPIDER. You're not A SNAKE. YOU ARE A FISH." SEE, THERE IT IS. YOU'RE not a goat or a pig. You are a lamb. Hallelujah. Brother Brand, I'm going to say, "My sheep hear my voice." It's because it comes to the elected the ones WHO GOD HAD FORNAW FORNEW. And so you can look at at the power of predestination. And the reason that predestination is such a powerful FORCE IS BECAUSE YOU came from God. You can look at the prodical son. I'm sure the prodical son wasn't the only boy that was working in the pig slot, but he was the only ONE THAT CAME FROM THE FATHER. AND SO WHILE HE WAS GOING BACK TO THE FATHER, THE rest of them was staying in THE PIG SLOT. WHAT SEPARATED THE TWO? HE CAME FROM THE FATHER. HALLELUJAH. And what IS SEPARATING YOU FROM THE SERPENTINE IS YOU HAVE COME FROM the father. And brother Brandon would say, notice the word cannot deny itself. THEN IT IS SATISFIED. OR THE DESIRE. IT'S A DESIRE OF WHAT? WHAT MADE YOU DESIRE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE? BECAUSE DOWN IN YOUR SOUL THERE WAS A predestinated seed WHICH WAS ETERNAL LIFE ALWAYS laying in there always was in there. All that the father hath given me will come to me. There isn't any of them that's going to be lost. A thinking man's taste when a thinking man hears the word of God. MY SHEEP WILL HEAR MY VOICE AND THAT A STRANGER THEY WILL NOT FOLLOW. FOR DOWN IN THERE IS LIFE and life connects with life. Hallelujah. LIFE CONNECTS WITH LIFE. BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT THE EAGLE THAT COME ACROSS THE BARNYARD. He says it was eagle responding to eagle. IT WAS LIFE RESPONDING TO LIFE. And so that's what predestination is. I believe IT IS A CALLING. PREDESTINATION ain't a crutch, right? Well, you can do whatever you want and and still be safe. But predestination is an attraction. It g it gives a conviction that even if you are wrong, THERE'S A DESIRE THAT PULLS YOU BACK TO MY VOICE. AND SO AS YOU'RE RECEIVING the word, there's a separation that has taken place. And we can look at Moses and how in the book of Hebrews, the Bible tells us by faith Moses when he come two years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. AND SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THAT WHENEVER HE become of age there he he decided to put away the ambition of Pharaoh and embrace another ambition. BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT BROUGHT THIS ON? HE had become matured. I love that. When he become of years, then he decided TO THROW AWAY THE IDENTITY of Pharaoh's daughter and become a stranger. And I believe that the bride has been maturing under this word and she has come to age. And so now there's a separation that has taken place. You remember the blind man that that Jesus would give A SIGHT BACK AND THEN and the Bible says the Jews would go to his parents and would say, "Is this your boy?" They say, "Yep, that is him." They said, "HOW DID HE RECEIVE HIS SIGHT?" AND WHAT WOULD THEY SAY? ASK HIM. HE'S OF AGE. In other words, he can speak for himself. He is a matured man. And he would SAY, "I WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE." IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S A CLAIMING THAT THAT MAN HAS ON MY LIFE THAT WOULD CHANGE ME. I WAS A BLIND MAN. I WAS A BEGGAR, BUT NOW HE HAS GIVEN BACK MY SIGHT. LET ME SPEAK FOR MYSELF. AND I BELIEVE THE BRIDE HAS COME OF AGE AND SHE CAN SPEAK FOR HERSELF. IT AIN'T SOME PREACHER THAT IS ALWAYS HAVING TO PRAY OVER YOU. BUT YOU CAN PRAY FOR YOURSELF. YOU CAN SPEAK OVER YOUR CHILDREN. YOU CAN SPEAK A BODY CHANGE OVER YOUR LIFE AND CLAIM IT WHY YOU HAVE COME OF AGE AND YOU CAN SPEAK FOR YOURSELF. HALLELUJAH. WHAT BROTHER SAY? THIS BRIDE WILL BE THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL GENERATION UNDER HER MESSENGER. IN OTHER WORDS, SHE HAS COME OF AGE. THE VOICE OF THE GROOM IS IN THE BRIDE AND AS SHE IS SPEAKING THE SAME WORD THAT THE SON OF MAN HAS SPOKEN. HALLELUJAH. My she can speak for himself. And I believe that that the bride has also come in a union. Brother Brandham would say in there would be and in there there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church. have the preeminence in his church. Oh my. What? The anointed man. Now the ANOINTED PEOPLE. OH MY. TO BRING BACK THE ANOINTED BRIDE and the bridegroom. Anointed by what? ACCEPTING WHAT EVE TURNED DOWN. AND ADAM BACK THERE W WITH WITH THE WITH the anointing of the word. BECAUSE HE SAID, "MY WORD IS SPIRIT." SEE, and with the anointed is with the word. WHAT EVE TURNED DOWN, HE COMES BACK AND WE ACCEPT. SO WHAT IS IT BY YOU ACCEPTING the word? It's a maturity that is taking place that is placing you in your inheritance. That's why brother Brandma preach a bride age. We're walking IN LEGISA BUT WE'RE NOT CONDITIONED LIKE THE LEGISANS. WE'RE BEING CONDITIONED BY ANOTHER WORD. Brother Brand tell us we're living in the RAPTURING AGE. WHAT IS IT? IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS separated us and has PLACED US IN OUR POSITION. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE because brother Brandon would talk about a king and how he would have a son and would say he was born he was born a son by birth but yet he did not fall heir to everything. And so in order for him to become heir of everything he HAD TO BE ADOPTED. SO EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A SON THERE HAD TO BE AN ADOPTION take place. And brother Brandon would say this here and THEN IF THE CHILD WAS OBEDIENT THEN THERE'S A SET CERTAIN DAY WHEN HE BECOMES of age. NOW THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH OUGHT TO be of age 40 years or BETTER ABOUT 50. SO IT should be of age. Then there comes a DAY WHEN THE SON BECOMES HE'S GOING TO be adopted or placed. He says you brethren what I'm trying to say placing of a son. You understand what I meant? He's to be placed positionally. He becomes an heir. Now they take him in the streets. They put him or I put on a certain garment. THEY HAVE A CEREMONY. AFTER THAT CEREMONY, THIS CHILD IS placed or adopted INTO THE SAME FAMILY HE WAS BORN IN. OH MY. SO YOUR BIRTH IS NOT YOUR ADOPTION, BUT BECAUSE YOU YOU WERE ALREADY BORN A SON OF GOD, YOU CAN BE ADOPTED AND BE HEIR OF all things. And then he says his name is just as good on a CHECK AS HIS DADDY IS. THAT'S RIGHT. HE falls heir. He's positionally placed. And I love brother Brandham PUTS THAT. THE PENTECOSTALS SHOULD BE of age, BUT THEY'RE NOT. BUT THEN HE WOULD TALK ABOUT HE WOULD GO THROUGH Luther Wesley and he says that how the Pentecost they would become deni they would THEY WOULD DENOMINATE BUT THEN HE WOULD CALL OUT HIS SONS OUT OF THAT AND WOULD PLACE HIM. WHAT IS IT? IT'S A CLAIMING OVER YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU MAY HAVE BEEN IN A DENOMINATIONAL SETTING. YOU MAY HAVE BEEN A PENTECOSTAL, BUT YOU WAS GOING AROUND IN A CYCLE. BUT THERE WOULD COME A CLAIM OVER YOUR LIFE AND SAY YOU WERE BORN FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS. YOU WERE NOT BORN TO GO AROUND IN CONFUSION. YOU WERE BORN TO HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] OVER THE DEPRESSION THAT COMES OVER YOUR LIFE, THE ANXIETIES THAT COMES OVER YOUR LIFE. YOU WERE BORN TO RULE. HALLELUJAH. AND YOUR NAME IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FATHER'S NAME. HALLELUJAH. Your name is JUST AS GOOD AS THE FATHER'S NAME. BROTHER Brandham was would say in the beginning he was God alone. He says Genesis 2 he would say he's Jehovah. HE SAYS WHAT DID THAT MEAN? He isn't self-existent anymore. But now HE'S EXISTING WITH THE FAMILY. He says but in Genesis 2 when he made man he SAYS I AM YAHWEH. YAHWEH JEHOVAH. WHAT DID IT MEAN? I'm the all existence one who HAS CREATED SOMETHING OFF or myself TO BE A SON OF MINE OR a temporary or an amateur little one of mine. OH, GLORY. WHY? HE GAVE MAN. Jehovah means that he gave man to be an AMATEUR GOD BECAUSE HE IS FATHER GOD. He made man an amateur god. So he isn't self-existence anymore. HE EXISTS WITH A FAMILY. SO IT'S NO LONGER GOD ALONE OR GOD JUST WITH THE ANGELS. BUT NOW IT'S GOD IN A BODY WHERE IT WAS JUST ONE MAN. NOW IT IS ITS ANOINTED BODY. WHATEVER YOU LOOSE ON EARTH WILL BE LOOSED in heaven. You speak INTO THIS MOUNTAIN AND IT'LL DISAPPEAR. WHAT IS IT? THE VOICE OF THE GROOM IS IN THE BRIDE. BROTHER BROWN MUST SAY SHE HAS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD or she keeps still. Hallelujah. Brother Brham must say this. And notice what harmony Jesus never did anything until seeing of the father or the father showed him first. HARMONY BETWEEN GOD AND CHRIST. SEE, SO WILL THE BRIDE. HE SHOWS HER HIS WORD OF LIFE AND HE SHOWS HER AND SHE RECEIVES IT. THERE'S THE KEY. SHE RECEIVES IT. SHE NEVER DOUBTS IT. HALLELUJAH. IT COMES CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT. SHE NEVER DOUBTS IT. THEN HE SAYS, "NOTHING CAN HARM HER, NOT EVEN DEATH." HOW COME YOU'RE CLAIMED? YOU MIGHT GO BY THE WAY OF THE GRAVE, BUT DEATH HAS NO CLAIM ON YOU. THE GRAVE HAS NO CLAIM ON YOU. IT WAS LAZARUS THAT WAS IN A GRAVE THAT THE VOICE OF RESURRECTION WOULD SAY LAZARUS COME FORTH AND THAT VOICE WOULD CLAIM HIM AND WOULD BREAK THE CLAIMS THAT GRAVE WOULD HAVE OVER HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND HE SAYS HERE IS THE SECRET. THE WORD IS IN THE BRIDE AND THE MIND OF CHRIST TO KNOW WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH THE WORD AND SHE DOES IT IN HIS NAME. SHE HAS THUS SAITH THE LORD. I THINK THAT'S POWERFUL. SHE DON'T JUST HAVE THE WORD, BUT SHE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH THE WORD. COME ON. REMEMBER BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HOW THAT HE DISCOVERED electricity and WOULD SAY, "I GOT IT. I GOT IT. I GOT IT." HE SAYS HE KNEW HE HAD SOMETHING, BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE HAD. BUT THEN THOMAS ANDERSON WOULD COME ALONG AND WOULD CREATE THE LIGHT BULB. HE DIDN'T JUST HAVE SOMETHING, BUT HE KNEW HOW TO USE IT. AND MISS BRIDE JUST AIN'T SAYING, "WE HAVE A MESSAGE. WE HAVE A MESSAGE." BUT SHE KNOWS WHAT GOD WANTS DONE WITH HIM. WHAT IS THAT? WHAT DOES HE WANT DONE WITH HIM? HE WANTS A BRIDE UPON THE EARTH THAT IS BONE OF HIS BONE, FLESH OF HIS FLESH, LIFE OF HIS LIFE, POWER OF HIS POWER. HE WANTS A YOUNG PERSON THAT IS AN INVINCIBLE ARMY IN THE MIDST OF LEONA. HE WANTS MARRIAGES THAT CAN WEATHER THE STORM IN THE MIDST OF CONFUSION. THE BRIDE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH the word. BUT HE DOES IT. BUT SHE DOES IT IN HIS NAME. So what is so SO SPECIAL ABOUT THAT NAME? Brother Brandham tell us that a name characterizes you. Right? He says if you have a son that is Ricky or Elvis, he says change the name. He says because that name CHARACTER RISES YOU. SO IN OTHER WORDS, THE NAME YOU'RE under is going to be YOUR CHARACTER OR YOUR LIFE. SO JACOB WOULD BE CHANGED TO ISRAEL, SIMON TO PETER, SAUL TO PAUL, and at the OPENING OF THE SEALS. BUT THE BRAND SAID, "I DON'T CALL YOU CHURCH, BUT I CALL YOU BRIDE." In other words, THERE'S GOING TO BE A LIFE THAT IS GOING TO COME INTO YOU WHERE YOU CAN PRODUCE THE GREATER WORKS. CUZ THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US IN THE BOOK OF ACTS that he's going to take a people out OF THE GENTILES FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. AND I BELIEVE we're living IN THAT TIME WHERE HE HAS CALLED A PEOPLE OUT OF THE GENTILES AND HAS CALLED THEM TO BE A SOLDIER, BUT A SEPARATED PEOPLE FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. AND if you look in the Strongs concordance, the definition of name is reputation, fame, or glory. In other words, WHEN YOU TAKE ON HIS NAME, you take on his reputation. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS WE'RE BORN SPEAKING LIES. WE'RE SHAPED IN INIQUITY, but our reputation IS DONE AWAY WHEN WE TAKE ON HIS NAME. HE TAKES ON OUR NAME AS A SINNER AND GIVES US HIS NAME AS MRS. JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know what I'm talking about. You can mention somebody's name and you SAY, "OH YEAH, THAT FELL." WHAT IS IT? THE REPUTATION, RIGHT? We we work in the construction trade back home. We're electricians. And you can mention somebody's name and their reputation comes to mind, right? Yeah. Somebody asked, "Hey, you know, uh, you know, a good plumber, you can mention a plumber." And they say, "Oh, I used him before." What is it? THE REPUTATION. AND SO, OUR REPUTATION WAS A NEGATIVE REPUTATION. BUT WHEN CHRIST WOULD CLAIM US BY accepting his word, IT DOES AWAY WITH OUR REPUTATION AND IT GIVES US HIS REPUTATION. OH MY. REMEMBER ZAKIUS? ZAKIUS, THE BIBLE says he we he desired to see JESUS WHO HE WAS. HE DIDN'T WANTED TO SEE THE BODY. HE WANTED TO SEE THE REPUTATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE BODY WOULD LEAVE ZAKIUS'S HOUSE, BUT THAT REPUTATION WOULD STAY THERE. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT ZAKIUS WOULD GO TO ALL THE ONES HE DONE WRONG AND WOULD MAKE HIS DEATHS RIGHT. WHAT WAS IT? THE BODY LEFT, BUT THE GLORY OF THE LORD WOULD REMAIN. WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE CORPORAL BODY OF JESUS CHRIST, BUT THE GLORY OF THE LORD HAS RISEN UPON THEE AND SHALL BE SEEN IN THEE. ARISE AND SHINE. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WE'RE NOT KNOWN AS A CHURCH. We've been claimed TO BE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD IS BEING SHOWN through us. HALLELUJAH. IT'S BEING SHOWN THROUGH US. YOU CAN LOOK AT MOSES. MOSES wanted to see God's glory in Exodus 33:18. And he said, I BESEECH THEE, SHOW ME THY GLORY. AND HE SAID, "I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS PASS BEFORE THEE, AND I WILL PROCLAIM THE NAME OF the Lord before thee, and will be GRACIOUS TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS, and will SHOW MERCY ON WHOM I WILL SHOW MERCY." WHAT'S HE SAYING HERE? But the proclaiming of my name, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A DIFFERENT SIDE OF ME. THEY SEEN GOD MIGHTY AND BOUND. GOD GOD WAS A JUDGMENTAL GOD, BUT NOW HE WAS GOING TO SHOW HIMSELF through grace AND MERCY. AND HOW ARE THEY GOING TO SEE THIS OTHER SIDE OF GOD? BY THE PROCLAIMING OF HIS NAME. HALLELUJAH. WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS HE MAKES A CLAIM. I WILL BE I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS PASS BEFORE THEE AND I WILL proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS. IN OTHER WORDS, it ain't for everybody, but it's only to the elected. And you can look up THE GRACE OF GOD WHENEVER IT WAS TIME FOR THE DEATH ANGEL TO COME THROUGH THE LAND OF EGYPT. IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT THEY had to get hissip, right? Dip it in the blood of the lamb and they would put it over THE DOORPOST AND THAT WAS GOD'S MERCY TO THE CHILDREN of Israel. But brother Brandon would tell us that HISSUP WAS JUST A COMMON WEED IN PALESTINE. AND I THOUGHT, "OH MY, COULD YOU IMAGINE BEING PHARAOH WHENEVER THE DEATH ANGEL'S coming through your land? YOUR FIRSTBORN JUST DIED AND ANY KING WOULD BE LIKE, MAN, HOW DO I STOP THIS FROM GOING THROUGH MY KINGDOM?" I'm sure they MAY HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT, TALKING ABOUT IT, BUT LITTLE DID THEY KNOW THERE WAS A COMMON WEED SITTING IN THE MIDST OF THE KINGDOM THAT COULD BRING A GRACE. BUT HOW COME THEY COULDN'T SEE IT? THEY WASN'T TOLD ABOUT IT. BUT THE GRACE OF GOD WOULD COME TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY IT'S SOMETHING SIMPLE BUT TAKE THAT SIMPLICITY AND IT WILL BE MY GRACE TO YOU. AND BROTHER BRAND TELL US THAT THE THAT THE HISHUP WAS A TYPE OF FAITH. AND HERE THE WORLD IS LOSING THEIR MIND. THEY'RE GOING INSANE. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT CAN BRING A PEACE IN THE MIDST OF THEIR INSANITY. BUT YET THE BRIDE OF CHRIST HAS A SIMPLE FAITH THAT HAS BROUGHT THE GRACE OF GOD. WHY? BY THE PROCLAIMING OF HIS NAME, I WILL BE GRACIOUS TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS. I WILL SHOW MERCY TO WHOM I WILL SHOW MERCY. IT'S A CLAIMING OVER YOUR LIFE. HALLELUJAH. THE DEATH ANGEL MIGHT COME TO YOUR HOME, BUT YOU'RE CLAIMED BY ANOTHER. IT MIGHT COME TO YOUR CHILDREN, BUT IT'S CLAIMED BY ANOTHER. IT MAY COME TO THIS CHURCH, BUT IT'S ALREADY CLAIMED BY ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. We're elected strangers. WE'RE ELECTED FOR THIS. YOU'RE CALLED FOR THIS. YOU'RE PREDESTINATED for this. Hallelujah. So God wasn't just a God of judgment, but he was a God of mercy. But it was at the proclaiming of his name. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL us that through the Old Testament, God had many titles. Jehovah Gyra. He would say rose, rose of Sharon, lily of THE VALLEY, THE BRIGHT AND MORNING STAR. But he says, but when Christ came, he wasn't a title. But Jesus says, I come in MY FATHER'S NAME. SO IN other words, WHEN CHRIST CAME, IT WASN'T JUST A TYPE. IT WAS A FULFILLMENT OF EVERYTHING THAT THE OLD TESTAMENT TALKED ABOUT. I AM MERCY. I AM GRACE THAT IS COMING TO TAKE AWAY THE SIN OF the world. NOT JUST A SUBSTITUTE, BUT I COME TO CLAIM YOU. WELL, THE SIN NATURE, the blood of BULLS AND GOATS WOULD COVER THEIR SIN, BUT THEY WERE STILL CLAIMED BY IT. BUT THE BLOOD OF CHRIST WOULDN'T JUST COVER IT, but it would bring a remission, [laughter] WHICH IS A SEPARATION. In other words, THE SIN THAT WOULD ONCE CLAIM US WERE NOW CLAIMED BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. And so, at the expression OF THE NAME OF GOD WOULD COME THE GRACE OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BROWN, I'M GOING TO TELL US, AND THE NAME IS IN the word because he IS THE WORD. AMEN. WHAT IS HE THEN? The word INTERPRETED IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE NAME OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. SO WHERE IS HIS NAME? HOW DO YOU BECOME A PART OF HIS NAME? WHEN THE WORD IS INTERPRETED AND YOU ACCEPT IT, THEN YOU ARE CLAIMED BY THE NAME OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. Brother Brown tell us that that any son comes in his father's name. He says Jesus said I COME IN MY FATHER'S NAME. AND HE SAYS SO WILL THE BRIDE COME IN THE FATHER'S NAME. IT IS MISS JESUS CHRIST. AND WHAT'S INCREDIBLE? He would TELL US THAT THIS OPEN BOOK is your marriage certificate. HALLELUJAH. WELL, WHAT IS THE PROOF THAT THE BRIDE AND THE BRIDEGROOM HAS HAS UNITED THIS MESSAGE? YOU CAN SAY AMEN TO EVERY WORD AND IT'S YOUR MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE TO THE DEVIL THAT HE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS, BUT I'M ALREADY CLAIMED BY ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And so we've come in the father's reputation or the father's glory. AND SO WE CAN LOOK AT ABRAHAM THAT WHEN WHEN Abraham's name would be changed, it wasn't changed TO MAKE IT SOUND BETTER. IT WAS it was changed to change his reputation, right? HE HE HE WAS FATHERLESS. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT ABRAM AND Elohim would come together, right? And so his name would be Abraham, IT WAS GOD'S REPUTATION COMING TO A FALLEN HUMAN BEING THAT HAD A NEGATIVE REPUTATION THAT COULDN'T THAT COULD NOT BRING FORTH THE PROMISED CHILD. BUT WHEN THE REPUTATION OF GOD WOULD COME TO HUMANITY, THEN IT COULD PRODUCE THE PROMISE FOR THAT DAY. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT ABRAHAM is a type of the church. He would say, "Do you love the journey with Abraham?" I JUST LOVE TO WATCH IT BECAUSE WHY? EVERYTHING THAT HE DID WAS A PERFECT TYPE OF THE CHURCH. So we can look at the life of Abraham. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE IT WASN'T ABRAHAM looking for God. It was God looking for Abraham. And he would come and and brother Brandon would tell us that that ABRAHAM WAS CALLED BY GRACE. It wasn't Abraham had something to OFFER OR HE HAD HE had prestige but it was only he was only called by grace. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON WOULD tell us that Abraham or Abram WAS FROM THE CITY OF BABYLON. HE LIVED IN A CITY THAT THAT WAS IN THE PROVINCE. AND IT'S POWERFUL BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US that if there's any type of of re of denominationalism IN THE BIBLE, IT'S BABYLON, RIGHT? HE WOULD SAY IT'S A FOREST RELIGION. HE SAYS EVERYBODY HAD TO COME TO THE TOWER OF BABEL TO WORSHIP. AND I THOUGHT HERE WAS ABRAM IN A FORCED RELIGION BUT YET GRACE WOULD COME BY HIS WAY. HALLELUJAH. BUT THE BRAND TELL US THAT DENOMINATIONALISM is a forced RELIGION BUT THE BRIDE OR THE THE BRIDE COMES INTO CHRIST NOT BY FORCED RELIGION BUT BY ELECTION. SO HERE ABRAM WAS A PART OF A FORCED RELIGION AND THEN ELECTION THEN GRACE WOULD COME BY HIS WAY. WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS LIFE CONNECTING TO LIFE. HALLELUJAH. AND you may have been IN A FORCED RELIGION BUT GRACE WOULD COME BY YOUR WAY AND SAY SEPARATE YOURSELF BEING NOT A PARTAKER OF HER SINS AND OF HER PLAGUES. HALLELUJAH. LIFE CONNECTS TO LIFE. BROTHER BRANDHAM, I THINK IT'S A POWERFUL THING BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON TELLS us that that Abram was a par as a type of the church. So you you and that gave me a different perspective of the life of Abraham cuz you you hear the stories of Abraham, how their bodies were changed, the name was changed, EL SHADI. BUT THEN BROTHER BROWN WOULD WOULD BRING IT down to us and he would tell us that there's four stages of Abraham's journey. He would tell US IN GENESIS 12, GOD IS CALLING ABRAHAM. And he would say that's justification, Luther. Genesis 15, God's confirming the covenant with Abraham, right? Which is when he got the different ANIMALS AND AND GOD would come and walk through the midst of it. He says that there was sanctification WESLEY. AND THEN HE SAYS GENESIS 17:1 IS EL SHADI, THE STRENGTHGIVER. And he says THAT'S A TYPE OF THE HOLY GHOST, WHICH IS PENTECOST. BUT HE DIDN'T STOP THERE. BUT THEN HE SAYS GENESIS 17 and5 Abraham's name change AND HE SAYS THAT WAS HIS ADOPTION. HALLELUJAH. SO ONCE WE SEE OURSEL THAT ABRAHAM WAS A SOULJOURER BUT GOD WAS WORKING by election every STEP OF THE JOURNEY SO IS HE WITH US. WE MIGHT BE A SOULJOURER BUT GOD HAS BEEN WORKING WITH US THROUGH ALL OF THESE CHURCH AGES. AND HE'S COME TO THE CLIMAX AND SAYS, "I'M NOT JUST GOING TO BE A SHOUT OUT TO YOU. I'M NOT JUST GOING TO SANCTIFY YOU OR JUSTIFY YOU, BUT I'M GOING TO COME AND PLACE MY NAME AND BRING YOU AS AN ADOPTED SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD." THAT YOUR NAME IS AS GOOD AS MY NAME. YOU PUT WHATEVER YOU HAVE NEED OF ON THAT CHECK AND IT WILL CASH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. I SAY THIS MORNING, WHATEVER YOU HAVE NEED OF, YOUR NAME IS AS GOOD AS GOD'S NAME. SPEAK THE WORD OVER YOUR SITUATION. SPEAK THE WORD OVER YOUR CHILDREN. SPEAK THE WORD OVER YOUR MARRIAGE. YOUR NAME IS AS GOOD AS GOD'S NAME. &gt;&gt; YOUR REPUTATION IS AS GOOD AS GOD'S REPUTATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Brother Brandham says God took Abraham out and placed the adoption upon him and changed his name. He says from Abram to Abraham. Abraham comes from the word Elohim. God's own name. He associated HIS NAME WITH GOD'S NAME. GOD IS ELOHIM. How many knows THAT THE GREAT JEHOVAH ELOHIM, THE ALLSUFFICIENT ONE, the selfexistent one, Elohim, THAT ALMIGHTY GOD WOULD COME AND GIVE HIS reputation to a fallen human being. Then brother Brown tell us so does God do with the royalty of Abraham. He would say, "Well, whatever we do in word and deed, we do it all in the name of Jesus Christ." He says, "THAT'S RIGHT. THERE YOU ARE." associated a name after THE ADOPTION. HE SAYS IT AGAIN AFTER the adoption. AND SO THAT'S A POWERFUL thing because brother Brandham before that quote and a lot of this is in Abraham's grace covenant. He would say that that whatever you do in word or in deed do it all in the name. and he stops and he says, "Well, can you smoke in that name?" He says, "Can you wear those pants in that name?" He's trying to get the the Pentecostal PEOPLE, THEY'RE CLAIMING THEY'VE ARRIVED, BUT HE SAYS, "BUT NOT REALLY. YOU'RE NOT CLAIMED YET. YOU'RE CLAIMING YOU'RE CLAIMED BY ANOTHER. CAN YOU WEAR PANTS in his name? Can you do those cards in his name?" BUT THE BRIDE SAYS, "I CAN. [laughter] WHATEVER YOUR WORD SAYS, I SAY AMEN TO IT. AND WHATEVER WE DO IN word or in deed, we do it all in the name of Jesus Christ. Brother Barnamus said he's he began to place his son Martin Luther restification. Years and years and years came sanctification. Years and years and years come the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But right quick after Pentecost did the same thing. The rest of them did. He be to PULL OUT HIS SONS THAT stood for his truth and HE GAVE THEM SOMETHING SPECIAL. MAGNIFIED HIM BEFORE the people with a certain thing that he stood out. See, placed him. I think THAT IS SO POWERFUL. HE MAGNIFIED HIM BEFORE THE PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY I KNOW BACK HOME, you know, there's been the the the town people ASK, "DAD, HOW DO YOU MAKE your your people wear skirts? Do you make them?" He says, "No, THEY WANT TO. THEY'RE MAGNIFIED." WHAT IS IT? THEY'RE CLAIMED BY ANOTHER. THEY MIGHT BE SOLDERS, but they're claimed by something else. And you see, my sheep will hear my voice. AND AND I BELIEVE THAT that we know what to do with the word. WE WE KNOW WHAT GOD WANTS done with it. You remember when Moses WAS CRYING WHEN HE came to the Red Sea, WHAT WOULD GOD SAY? WHY CRYING TO ME? SPEAK. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'VE GOT THE AUTHORITY. WHY ARE YOU CRYING ABOUT IT? SPEAK AND GO FORWARD. REMEMBER, BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY, PEOPLE IS CRYING ALL THE TIME. WHAT TO DO? WHAT TO DO NEXT? WHAT'S NEXT? HE SAYS JUST SPEAK AND GO FORWARD. HE SAYS, "IF GOD'S COMMISSIONED to you to do it," HE SAYS, "SPEAK AND GO FORWARD." AND THEN HE STOPS AND HE SAYS, "HE IS STILL THE GOD OF MIRACLES." AND I JUST LOVE THAT QUOTE. HE IS STILL THE GOD OF MIRACLES. IN OTHER WORDS, QUIT CRYING ABOUT YOUR situation and use the word and speak the word. HE IS STILL THE GOD OF MIRACLES. &gt;&gt; You shall prophesy again. Right? You're taking the word and the word is upon your lips. Hallelujah. And you can look at why Peter and John, you know, silver and gold have I none, but what SUCH AS I HAVE, I GIVE UNTO THEE. RISE UP AND walk in the name of Jesus. And the people took notice. I love it. They took NOTICE THAT THEY WERE MAGNIFIED. THEY TOOK NOTICE that these were ignorant men, unlearned men. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THIS AIN'T THEIR reputation that done that. COME ON NOW. THIS AIN'T THEIR REPUTATION. THEY TOOK NOTICE. THEY HAD BEEN WITH JESUS. HALLELUJAH. THEY HAD BEEN MAGNIFIED. NOW THE LIFE OF CHRIST WAS WORKING THROUGH THEM. And I think so is it today in my name you shall CAST OUT DEVILS. WHY? WE'RE connected to the source. And brother Brown tell us many CHURCHES IS TRYING TO TAKE the name. He says they're just taking the name Christian church and pretending to be the bride. AND HE SAYS THEY'RE ARTIFICIALLY the bride. HE SAYS THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED to the life's source in any way. But he SAYS THE BRIDE HAS taken on his name. AND THEN HE WOULD STOP AND WOULD SAY, "WELL, HIS NAME, BUT I MEAN NATURE. HE'S TAKEN ON HIS LIFE." SO WITH HIS name comes his life. And and I WON'T HOLD YOU MUCH longer this morning. You can look at Ephesians 2:19. Now therefore, you're no more STRANGERS AND FOREIGNERS, BUT FELLOW CITIZENS WITH THE SAINTS OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE A STRANGER HERE, BUT YOU'RE NOT A STRANGER TO GOD. YOU SEE, YOU MIGHT THINK THAT GOD HAS FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU. You know, HE'S FORSAKEN ME. I've done too many wrongs. But brother Brown, I'm going to talk about the Jews and how that that the 144,000 is going to be brought out, right? AND HE SAYS, BUT HOW DO THEY KNOW WHO'S JEW? Because they lost all of their records. THEY'VE LOST THEY'VE LOST EVERYTHING. BUT THEN HE WAS STUCK AND WOULD SAY, BUT GOD KNOWS THEM. HALLELUJAH. THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE RECORDS OF WHO THEIR IDENTITY IS OR THEY CAN'T TRACE IT ALL THE WAY BACK, BUT GOD KNOWS WHO THOSE 144,000 ARE. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BRIDE OF CHRIST? YOU MIGHT FEEL LIKE YOU'RE A STRANGER TO GOD. YOU MIGHT FEEL, BUT LET ME SAY THIS. YOU ARE NO LONGER A STRANGER, BUT YOUR FELLOW CITIZENS WITH THE SAINTS OF GOD IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD. GOD WILL NOT LOSE A ONE OF THEM. YOUR NAME IS ENGRAVED IN THE PALM OF MY HAND. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU MIGHT FEEL LIKE A STRANGER, BUT I KNOW YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO FORSAKE YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO FORGET ABOUT YOU. BUT I KNOW YOU. HALLELUJAH. WE BELONG SOMEWHERE NOW. HALLELUJAH. And it's always it's terrible whenever you you're at a new place and you don't feel like you fit in, RIGHT? AND WE'VE BEEN THAT WAY THROUGH THROUGH LEORA, BUT NOW WE HAVE FOUND A SAFE HAVEN. NOW WE'VE ENTERED IN BEHIND THE VEIL AND WE'RE LIVING IN A SAFE PLACE WHERE WE FEEL LIKE WE BELONG. WE'RE SHUT IN WITH GOD. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE SHUT IN WITH GOD. AND AND ONE definition of soldier is a temporary stay. And I thought that's powerful. We're only here temporarily. And the Bible would say in Hebrews 13:14, "For here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come." In other words, we're here temporarily, but our our direction is not temporary, BUT IT'S SOLID. IT IS SECURED. And you can look in the book of Genesis ON HOW THAT GOD would tell Abraham that his seed was going to sojurnn in a land that was not there, a strange land that was not their soldier. In other words, they're going to be THERE TEMPORARILY, BUT I'M GOING TO COME DOWN AND I'M going to bring them out. And then he would say this in Genesis 15:14, "And also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge, and afterward they shall come out with great substance." In other words, the land that they're living in is only temporarily. BUT THE PROMISES I'VE GIVEN THEM IS ETERNAL. THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT WITH GREAT SUBSTANCE. WE'RE IN LEGONIA, WHICH IS WHICH IS TEMPORARILY, BUT SUBSTANCE that he's given you. FAITH IS THE SUBSTANCE THAT IS NOT TEMPORARILY BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ETERNAL THAT IS GOING TO HOLD YOU IN THE TEST OF TIME. HALLELUJAH. See they were in a land that that that they were temporarily in a land but you can look at Joseph. What would Joseph say? Don't bury my bones here. But when you leave AND HE WOULD PROPHESY OVER THEM AND WOULD SAY GOD'S GOING TO VISIT YOU. AND WHEN HE DOES TAKE MY BONES WITH YOU. HE KNEW THAT WE'RE IN THIS PLACE TEMPORARILY. BUT WE'RE GOING TO A PLACE THAT GOD HAS CALLED US TO BE IN. AND I SAY, "DON'T SAY DON'T LEAVE MY BONES HERE. DON'T LEAVE ME HERE. BUT WHEN THE VOICE OF RESURRECTION COMES, IF I'M IN THE IN THE GRAVE, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE. BUT I'LL MEET YOU." AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, THOSE WHO ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN WILL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE HERE TEMPORARILY, BUT WE'RE GOING TO A PLACE WHICH IS ETERNAL. That's right. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WE'RE GOING TO A place which is eternal. Brother Brandham said that every Hebrew THAT WOULD WALK BY AND SEE those bones, remember the promise. They knew that those bones are here. God hasn't visited us yet. But when he does visit, we're all going. He says everyone that went by said no MATTER HOW HIS IF HIS BACK WAS BEAT, they could look at those bones and could remember God was going to take him out. But the Brand say Abraham would buy a burying ground for Sarah. And he says he didn't want to bear here just anywhere but it had to be in the place where the voice of resurrection was going to come to. And you see brother Brandon would say and he goes to many many of these these examples but he says it was quickening power that's going to take that would take us that it's a spoonful of dust. He's going to take us out of the grave one day because we're in the place where the voice of resurrection is going to come to. And brother Brandon would say God hadn't promised a resurrection down there in Egypt, but they knew that the resurrection was going to be in the promised land. And on the day when when Jesus finally come, the redeemer, they did it to him like they SAID THEY WOULD. HE DIED, BURIED. On the third day, he rose. And those that was buried up there with him, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the saints came out of the grave. They know the resurrection was going to take place in Palestine because it was spiritually revealed to them. And I believe that we we found the place where God is going to visit us. AND I BELIEVE HE is visiting us. IT AIN'T SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE. I SAY BURY me in THIS MESSAGE. I SAID BURY YOURSELF IN THE MESSAGE. DIG INTO THE MESSAGE. DIG INTO THOSE TAPES AND GET A spiritual revealed truth that this is where God is visiting. Let our musicians come this even this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, Exodus 13:18. &gt;&gt; But God led the children or led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. And the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him. For he has straightly sworn the children of Israel, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away hence with you." I love that they went up harnessed out of Egypt, out of the land of Egypt. The Bible would say they went out on eagle's wings. Brother Brand said, "What was those eagle's wings?" It was the message Moses was packing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe that we are harnessed to the message of the hour. We're tied to it. That's why the Apostle Paul was saying, "None of these things move me." Brother Brandham says he was harnessed to the will of God. He was tied to something that when winds blow, winds blow, winds come and go. We're not a vagabond. If you look up that word vagabon, it means tossed about, means the totter. It means to be blown about. That's serpent seat, but not the bride of Christ. The harness to something. The harness to the voice of resurrection. The harness. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham must say, "Heavens will shake, the earth will shake, heavens and earth will pass away, but the word will never pass away. For upon this rock, I'll build my church, and the gates of hell will never prevail against it. Everything that that that that can be shook will be shaken. But we receive a kingdom, which is the word of God himself, and God is his word, and he don't shake himself." Amen. But we receive a kingdom that cannot be [clears throat] moved. It's unshakable. Hallelujah. Are you resting in it? Are you resting in it? You remember brother Brandham would go beyond the curtain of time. And he would say, you know, I preached what Paul preached. And the multitudes would say, we're resting on it. Even though they went by the way of the grave, they were still tied to it. THEY WERE STILL HARNESSED TO IT. WE'RE BEING CARRIED by this message. Hallelujah. See, in order to be carried by something, you got to give up and rely. I'M GIVING UP and I'm relying ON THIS MESSAGE. I'M HARNESSED to it and we're resting on it. [music] Are you riding on it this morning? Brother Brandon would say, "If you're not, jump on." Remember the log, Brother Brandon would tell the story of how he would jump on the log and the man in the vision would jump on the log and say, "I'm riding [music] on it. I'm riding on it. I'm riding on it." And he says, "We're riding on this word. Heavens and earth will pass away, [music] &gt;&gt; but this word will never fail." Let's bow our heads this morning. [music] Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, how wonderful you are to us, Lord, [music] [snorts] thank you for the claim that you have on our lives. Lord, you would tell, your prophet would tell us that we were claimed in the devil's pawn shop, but then you would come and claim us out of it. [music] Lord, we're thankful that you placed an elected seed on the inside of our hearts, Lord. Though even though we're strangers, you've elected us and has claimed [music] us in this generation. Lord, I ask if there's some that is weary in mind and in body this [music] morning. Father, Lord, may they come up to El Shadi and give some strength, Lord. Your prophet would tell us that Abraham would [music] nurse a body change from El Shadi, Lord. And I ask that if there's some that is weary, [music] Lord, may they draw strength from you. Your prophet would tell us, El Shy, don't just strengthen, but he satisfies. [music] And Lord, I believe that if there's some here that ain't satisfied, Lord, may this draw from your strength, Lord, that they can be satisfied, that this is the word for me, that this is my direction, this is my future. Lord, I ask that you'd be with us the rest of the day [music] in Jesus name. Amen. What are you playing? Awesome. Oh, he's awesome. [music and singing] Verse one. My God is awesome. Can we stand this morning? He can move the mountains. [music] Keep me in the valley. Hide me from the [singing] rain. My God is awome. [music] It's me when I'm broke.

Can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise? [applause] Is he awesome this morning? [cheering] Is he great this morning? Oh my. Our God is tremendous. Amen. Did you enjoy that service this morning? Did he speak to your heart this morning? [music] Are you glad that you're a child of God this morning? Amen. And can we sing that song? I am a child of God. &gt;&gt; I'm no longer a slave to fear. [music] I am [singing] a child of God. I'm no [singing] longer slave to fear. Oh, I am a [music] child of God from my mother's womb. Oh, from my [music and singing] mother's womb. Oh, you have chosen me. [singing and music] Oh, your love has called my name. Oh, I've been born [music and singing] again into your family. Oh, your blood it flows through my veins. [music] Sing it now. [singing] Oh, I'm no longer slave [music] to fear. [singing] Oh, I am [music] a child of God. Oh, I'm no longer a slave [singing] to fear. [music] Oh, [singing] I am a child of God. You unravel [music] me. [singing] You unravel me. Yes, Lord. With a meloy. [singing] You surround [music] me with a song [music] of deliverance from my enemies. [music and singing] Till long my fears are gone. Oh, I'm no longer [singing] slave to fear. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I am a child of [singing] God. I'm [music] no longer a slave to fear. Oh, I am a child. Can we sing from my mother's womb? Oh, from my mother's womb, you have chosen me. [singing] Oh, your love has called [singing] my name. Oh, I've been born again into your family. [singing and music] Oh, your blood flows through [music] my veins with all your hearts now. [singing] Oh, I'm no longer slave to fear. [music] I am a child of God. [music] Oh, [singing] I'm no longer a slave to fear. [music] Oh, I am a child of God. Sing it again. [music and singing] I'm no longer slave to fear. [music and singing] Oh, I am a child [singing] of God. Yes, [music] I'm no longer a slave to fear. Oh, I am a child [music] of God. Amen. [music] Can we sing that song of the goodness of God? I love you, Lord, for your mercy [music] never fails me. [singing] And all my days, I've been held in your hands. From the moment [music] that I wake [singing] up until I lay my [music] head.
