whimps is he you know but we all got to do it but you know what for you young people I'm a whole lot closer to home than you are amen that's our that's our whole desire amen now what I'm going to say right now uh thank you musicians what I'm going to say right now um I'm going to preach on okay now when a person turns in a prayer request they give a short description of what the person actually is to be prayed for they don't just say okay uh pray for brother well now your mind's going to say okay pray for brother Amos that's all they put on there pray for brother Amos well he got a preach tonight say well maybe he needs prayer you know we we need to pray for him now let's just say uh they put in request pray for brother will I mean what I mean he's here you know it looks all right to me I mean you know he's of course he's Navy man but I mean I could pray for that but you know other than that he's okay but you got to put on why he needs prayer every time you put in a prayer request you you got to put why wow what what what is it at least some generalities why this person needs prayer or this condition needs prayer so you want to explain why so we're going to explain why but what we're going to talk about now the Bible admires us to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem why why I mean it's a city of Peace you know it's a uh even the name Jerusalem means a city of Peace why do we need need to pay even the Gentiles the Gentiles we're admonished to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem now you know even brother M says there's three PR three races of people you got your Jews your Gentiles and Samaritans the Jews of course the Jews that's God's chosen then Gentiles you know what the word Gentile means I didn't know this till the other day a couple of days ago the word gent the word Gentile brother man said the word Gentile means unbeliever unbeliever so you got the Jews God's chosen you got all the Gentiles which is encompasses every every body else then you got the Samaritans which is half and half so you got the Believers the unbel that's the uh you got your Believers unbelievers and makeb Believers you still got them three categories okay we're Gentiles we were unbelievers except for that seed thank God for that seed so we're going to we're going to explain and brother man preaches many Ser servants on why like why a little Bethlehem why it had to be Shepherds why we're not a denomination why I'm against organized religion lot why so this morning I'm we're going to talk about and I tried to get away from it I tried to go a different direction but the Lord said no he wouldn't have none of it so this is what it's going to be I'm going to preach on why Jerusalem why Jerusalem and I hope that it will be a help to all us especially especially and I think one of the reasons he wants me to go this direction because in light of all this happened today with Israel why Jerusalem and I think it will I think it will help us all so um we're we're not going to preach on why brother will we're going to be why Jerusalem amen I'm sure there's I'm sure that Navy there's an atonement for that I'm sure there's okay how many love the Lord this morning all right let's read a couple of scriptures if we can start with Genesis 12 I do I really do like the uh the new screens it have I mean especially when you're singing you can see the back and I'm sure brother shmay and Daniel you can really enjoy that and and especially when you can see have two screens you got the scriptures on both sides where you couldn't hardly see them in the middle it's it's really really nice and appreciate the the brothers that put them in and you know the having the money to take care of that really really appreciate that I just got a few notes so if I let you out in 10 minutes I hope you don't get mad at me oh my wife laughs Genesis 12:7 subject why Jerusalem and we're going to understand a little bit more why Jerusalem all the way down and even today Genesis 12:7 and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto thy seed will I give this land and there he build it an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him catch these things Genesis 15 s you don't have to turn to these if they want to put them on I don't know if they going to put them on the screen or not but I'll read them uh Genesis 15:7 and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of er of the chales to give thee this land to what to inherit it Genesis 15:18 in the same day the Lord made a covenant now he made a covenant with Abra with Abram unconditional Covenant I made it in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river Egypt un the Great River the river Euphrates this land Genesis 28:13 and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land where or the land whereon thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed now let's pray and I'll let it be seed I've got some more scriptures here heavenly father thank you for the reading of the word thank you Lord that we do have the word thank you Lord that we as the prophet of God said we have the the Divine interpretation of the written word with Divine Vindication and we're thankful Lord we had a Vindicated Prophet we're thankful the Lord that we've we've had the Bible for years and we understood part of it so much of much of it had been uh through the 17 1800 years of the Catholicism and brought things off into error and tradition but lord it's been restored back we're so thankful you sent us a messenger that we might understand what is thus sth Lord the word of God for this day oh God thank you help us this morning we commit the service into your hands hide me behind the cross bless Lord the things that are said we humbly ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everybody says amen God bless you as you're seated I hope my mic is not too loud I want to be too loud I told wife this morning I said you know what I think I'm just going to stay home and stream this morning I've tried to get my notes to two or three brothers they want nobody to take it so so you're stuck with me amen we find these four scriptures where the Lord Elohim he made an unconditional Covenant with Abraham to have and to possess and to own this land of Canaan Israel now I'm going to read another scripture and let's turn to Psalms 137 read the first six verses there if You' like to follow with this this is really sets another Foundation here for for Israel Palestine Jerusalem especially Jerusalem Psalms 137 verse1 now the scene here is is the the the desolate and Afflicted uh Jewish people they're in Babylon captive away from Israel away from Palestine away from Jerusalem they're down in Babylon so they writes this song of course David was not in Babylon and and in Exile like Daniel and Hebrew children but he by inspiration writes this verse one one 1371 by the Rivers of Babylon there we sat down yay we wept when we remembered Zion or Jerusalem so it's you know it was customary for the Jews to have their little meetings by by the river so they sit down by the river and they're reminiscing back of their days before their capture verse two we hanged our Harps out upon the Willows in the midst thereof and so they're they're so distressed in Exile from their homelands so they just unstrain the harps and they hung them on the willow trees they just they just didn't feel like singing so there verse three for There They carried us away captive required of us a song and they and they that Wast us were of us mirth or rejoicing saying sing us one of the songs of Zion I mean now being wasted from the Homeland how could the how could the enemy require them to sing a joyful song and they're the one and took them captive they're slaved they've been enslaved they beat them and so forth and they want to sing a a song of rejoicing I mean that's insulting you might say verse four how shall we sing the Lord's song In a Strange Land deprived and oppressed how if I listen what what he says now verse 5 if I forget thee Old Jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning in other words let the dearest and most precious thing I have that's your right hand that's what you do with that's what you work with that that's your labor that's your your your business everything said let my right hand let me let my let me lose all of my abilities if I forget Jerusalem that's what he's saying verse six if I do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief Joy now they they were musicians that we talked about and now if we forget Jerusalem let me let me lose my voice Let Me Lose My Melody let me lose my speech let me just lose everything because I I am enslaved away from my homeland now you have to remember brother man says God always deals with Israel in the Homeland when they get out of the Homeland God don't deal with Israel that's why they had trouble down in Egypt everywhere they've gone and been dispersed all over the world for for 2,000 years but they had to come back to the Homeland God blesses Israel in the Homeland and there's so many I I preached four messages down in Happy Valley I'd love to preach them here about blessings in the Homeland you you would be amazed of Miracles how God has blessed the land of Israel since 1948 you'd be amazed miraculous I may bring him in sometime agriculture science development medicine military the guy the the eighth best military in the world right there in Israel Israel's only the the size of the state of New Jersey how have they been able to do it it's been a miracle oh I I just love it okay Jerusalem oh Jerusalem the capital city of our faith this city of Peace why Jerusalem why is so Jerusalem so important mentioned 63 62 23 times in the Old Testament 623 times in the Old Testament even jerus mentioned 141 in the New Testament Jerusalem brother R said in the Sixth Seal said look there they crucified him the Bible said there that's the four of the greatest words look there Jerusalem the most holy city in the world they the most holy people in the world crucified the most brutal death in the world him the greatest and most important person in the world Jerusalem of course we know Jerusalem the Jewish and the Christian and the Muslim Roots all came from Jerusalem but now the main reason is so great is because God is Sovereign and God chose Jerusalem that settles it we don't have to know all the reasons why God chose Jerusalem why didn't why didn't the Bible say God chose Jacob so I love Jacob I hate Esau Cain and Abel Jacob Esau Isaac Ishmael all the way down that's God's sovereignty you don't question God's sovereignty I don't I don't even want to because he knows he knows best brother man said in this message great coming revival now listen close there there they are bringing them up out of Iran you read your papers and so forth this is 1954 and papers so forth how thousands times thousands and thousands have been brought from all all over the world by ships and PLS coming into Jerusalem picking up the stones off the deserts piling them up and all of a sudden all of a sudden all of that dry ground there there sprung up rivers that they know nothing about great irrigation has set in they developed the drip irrigation it's that's patented over there and only well it's been around the world but they started and it works simple great irrigation has set in and then what would happen happen all these other things the Jews coming in he said let my scripture says let my sons come from the East and from the west and from the north and from the south the prophet said so and in the last days it would take place and there they are coming in by coming in by shipload and plane load coming from all over the world different dialects from everywhere coming all together coming together there and you know it's really it's really interesting you know these different people come from Russia from Poland Ukraine from all over from Africa all places I mean the Jews were dispersed after 8070 when Titus burnt the city and for all these you know seven 1700 years and now they what what made them what made them want to come back to Jerusalem what made them go back to Jerusalem well it's two things first of all God did put uh something within their heart just like a it's like a some inate yearning to go back to Palestine but not all of them didn't have that God had to drive many of them in fact maybe most of them back there that's why during The Sixth Seal uh the fifth seal rather when brother when the Six Million Jews were killed and brother B said that was the tender hand of Jehovah why because the the the ones that survived after that and the ones that escaped being caught from Germany and Poland and different Nation Russia and so forth they actually God had to drive them back to Israel but it was his will it was his prophecy for them they have to be back in pal sign amen it's got to be that way because it's got to be that way to fulfill scripture because hey there's 144,000 is going to hear this gospel going to be saved during the tribulation period Israel has got to be still still got to be a nation that's got to and so I can't tell you what's going to happen as far as a result of this war between Hamas and Israel but I can tell you one thing Israel will remain how many lives there loose I don't know how and and and I'll just say it right now this is the beginning my opinion this is me now this is the beginning of if you want to call it a squeeze for Israel because this is they've had they fought five major Wars since 1948 we could go through all I won't get on to that today all Supernatural but this has been the hardest conflict they've had yet whether it be the Six Day War the yapor war the war of independence the war of attrition the SI campaign all of those they all been tough but this is the toughest thing yet that's right think about it aund over 100 I don't know what the figure 130 over 100, Palestinians have been killed no wonder and the Bible says all the world will turn against Israel all the world will turn against Israel this is the beginning of it hey we we're getting real real close Brother Sam we're getting real close all right let my Sons Sons come from the east west from the north and from the south and even even when the Great migration from Russia was going back to and Amos probably knows a lot about that uh it's really amazing and this is this is amazing 80% 80% of all those Jews that left Russia suppos were freed from Russia that should have gone to Palestine they came to America and they came to New York City and that's why brother M says that the the Jews hold the bonds in the wall and the Wall Street is actually controlled by the Jews the Catholic Church has the goal the Jews holds the bonds and the Jews always been money loving I mean they've been prospered they was prospered in Germany they prospered everywhere they go they've been profit God chosen people and they love money so they went to New York City and they made lots of money millions of dollars and they hold the bonds that's why they'll make a covenant with the Jews and the pope will at some point in time that's oh it's it's a beautiful picture when you see it yes sir but they should have gone to Israel but 80% I went to went to New York and I and and most of them will not will not go to Israel and I've got some quotes but we didn't bring them in today brother man said Them Crooked Wall Street juice they'll never go back there they're not real Jews anyway I mean they're Jews by descendants but we'll get to that in a minute but there's listen there only 20 only 20% of Israel's what four or five millions in Israel today only 20% Orthodox 80% they're just they're just they're just Jews that's all they they're just Jews all right let's go on now this this lesson is going to help us understand why all the nations will turn against Israel and it's already started I want to explore this in light of what's happening today now remember Israel Israel's Journey to the promised land is typed our journey to our Promised Land I could read the quote don't have it today but we know that our Israel's journey to their Promised Land types ours to our promised land and as I said I think Israel is really enter into a real real time of squeeze now now Israel Jerusalem in 2 Kings 21 and4 I just love these couple scriptures 2 Kings 21:4 is and he built altars in the house of the Lord of which the Lord said in Jerusalem will I put my name now that settles it for me anywhere God puts his name that's where I want to be now I'm not saying I want to be in Jerusalem because I'm not a Jew but anywhere God puts his name as you go back to De Deuteronomy brother man us for the scriptures you know uh God's chosen place of worship I've God said I've chosen a place where I'll put my name and only there will can you worship me that's you know for the Gentiles for the for the True Believers Daniel 6 And1 now when Daniel knew that he was down in captivity now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house talk about he supposed to worship the the emperor there open his windows and being open his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before God as as he did before why did he kneel toward Jerusalem because since the the the Jewish law was since they couldn't come to Jerusalem and be in Jerusalem person that God told them to look towards Jerusalem and the they would have the same results if they look toward Jerusalem as if they were in Jerusalem right I mean look at Jonah and Jonah said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look toward I will look again toward thy whole holy city in the bottom of the sea Jonah looks towards Jerusalem he knew they had a promise aren't you glad God has a God gave them an unconditional Covenant and we'll read that in a minute you know I listen I don't care what Israel does God still has the Covenant with them people you ain't gonna get away from it it's there all right even in 2 Chronicles 33 and 7 again and he carved and he set a carved image the idol which he had made in the house of God now that's a paradox with itself because it wouldn't have supposed to have no graven image but they put the cherubims on the on top on top of the Ark of the Covenant The Mercy Seat but God there again God's Sovereign he does what he wants to you don't have to try to explain God and he set a carved image the idle which he made in the house of God of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son in this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel I will put my name forever bless the Lord that settles that now surprisingly God's sovereignty many times you know it's it's missed it's overlooked now God chose His Bride that settles it we don't we don't question that he just chose it God chose Israel that settle it we don't question that he has a right to do it God don't need to take counsel with nobody God Jo chose Jerusalem that settles that praise the Lord God chose Israel that settles that so so all of these things okay thus far Jerusalem the most holy city in the world now remember that was in Jesus's day and I want you to catch the importance of this principle of God in Jerusalem I will put my name Second Kings second chronicles different places that's why I said Daniel and Jonah and all the Jews they look towards Jerusalem to pray now here's brother M says in the Third Exodus I want to emphasize this principle before we go any further brother man says in the the first Exodus what did he do he brought them from a natural land to a natural land going from Egypt into the land of Canaan natural to a natural now don't don't miss it you know this principle but I want you to catch it and hold on to it the second ex is he brought them from a spiritual condition to the spiritual spiritual baptism of Holy Ghost In other words from the law of Moses to Christ the mediator uh the the New Covenant you put it that way from the old law to the new for the new Grace and now he's bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost right back right back I love that right back into the Eternal land of the Millennium and the great Hereafter that's why the you know when we talk about about melus talks about it's that that priesthood is the power of an endless life we're going back to Eternity The Eighth Day oh it's just beautiful that and that's why brother man said justification made because he said we're going from the baptism of the Holy Ghost to right back to the Eternal land of the Millennium that's why he said justification wait wait for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost he didn't stop right there the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself that's why Revelations 10:1 is so important Christ himself the coveted angel came down put one foot on the land one on the sea and swore by himself that time should be no more in other words be no longer delay I'm going to reveal the book open the seals show so the bride her name's in the book and so forth and so on time shall be no more be no longer delay in other words back into the Eternal land of the Millennium we're we're at the down at the end now you don't have to you don't have I want you to keep that locked in your mind Israel's Journey was a natural journey and even all of their Wars all of their Wars the five Wars that they fought since 1948 Israel is trying to not only secure but they're trying to maintain and preserve a natural land they're not trying to necessarily I mean the like I said only 20 20% I'm Orthodox you know that and we'll get to the Temple Mount but they they God promised them that land and they want that land and they're going to keep that land that's what all the fuss is about now let me just give you just a little bit of review here now uh leaving Egypt they left Egypt 40 years in the wilderness then crossing over Jordan going into C Canan it's all natural it's a natural land natural battles yet they were won supernaturally by God but they are natural cities natural Giants everything's natural now even the most important uh thing today even Israel today you could go from it we still talking about acquiring and maintaining and preserving a natural land you can start from the Zionist movement the turn of the century you could talk about Theodore Herzel who formed the Zionist organization to promote Jewish immigration to Palestine what put it in his heart it's time that Israel has a uh a a land that they can call their own they actually well that's that's a whole another subject I'd love to get in that but we wanton today but but he started that and then from there you have a David benan who was the first Prime Minister actually he was David benur was actually B born in uh Poland or um I'm I know Goldie Myer she was born in Ukraine but I forget now where I think he was born in Russia or anyway but he he was the first uh and he he was the one who actually officially declared Israel as a nation May the 14th 1940 he made this this is his real famous statement we hereby declare the establishment of a Jewish state in the land of Israel that settles it amen gold and you could talk about Goldie Myer and and she was kind of a David Ban's a right-hand woman if you want and of course we understand you know women and so like that but you know just like Deborah she was a judge that's politics you know they don't have anything to do with the church that's politics but Goldie my ear she was a she was a great great great help for the establishment of Israel and you could talk about yach rabine and and Manakin bean and Chiron Perez and er of cherom and all the way down to Benjamin Netanyahu you realize that most most of those Prime Ministers actually they were Generals in the military and all most all of the prime ministers had in fact all of them had military service except for Goldie my ear they had had military even the women have to spend two years in the military the the men have to spend three years the women two years and everybody mandatory and then they're on call for until they're 39 or 40 years old they have to be that way because if anybody evades Israel they're such a small land they have a relatively small army they've got to call up all the observers and that's the one way only way they can fight yes sir okay so so they all focused on acquiring development and preserving that land all of these leaders and so forth now what's worse I mean like I said this is hard to accept but God has a covenant with Israel even though Israel has disobeyed God they have they they not Believers in Christ we know that but they were blinded for that but you look at even the city of Tel Aviv Tel Aviv Tel Aviv actually is considered by the world is actually the homosexual capital of the Middle East that's horrible homosexual capital of the Middle East but you know what God still has a covenant with the nation nation of Israel yet that he still has that Covenant and God Honors that Covenant and God will not resin and he cannot resend that Covenant because it's an everlasting Covenant now but the bride she's altogether a spirit church you know she has a spiritual rebirth she's going to spiritual land all the spiritual Focus now having said those things Israel she going from a natural land to a natural land Brides going from spiritual baptism Holy Ghost into the Eternal land of Millennium we we we came from for getet that that important principle now brother R says in the token he said now it's a type today shown us we are also facing another exus God bringing Israel out of Egypt to the promised land was a type of Christ bringing the bride out of the church to the promised land we're in another exus just to showing you know that the natural types of spiritual their natural uh exus was uh same thing us go in our Promised Land he also says now the type here in another message there's a wonderful type that we sure don't want to miss see type God was bringing Israel his people out of a Nation a nation out of a Nation a nation out of a Nation a beautiful type today that God is calling a bride out of a church a Christian bride out of a Christian Church a bride out of a church which is called in the Bible and referred to aren't you thankful for Revelations 18:4 come out of her my people amen 2 Corinthians 617 and be and I forget how it goes but it said be not Protectors of sins that you receive not of her plagues come out come out thank God he called us out now here's here's getting into a little stickler now God there's two groups of people that God chose Israel the bride you just argue that with God that's just the way that's just his sovereignty of all the nations of all the peoples on the earth he chose Israel and he chose his bride it's just the way it is I didn't write the Bible I just say what it saids now of all the nations of peoples two groups now the next question is if he chose Israel who is Israel good question brother man says in Israel and the church and this is really interesting he said you say oh you've heard him say oh all the Jews are God's people all the all the Jews are God's chosen people all brother Ben said that's not right that's not right no then he goes on to say the Jews are not go I'm sorry the Jews are not God's chosen people he's he's referring back to his first statement all the Jews are not God's chosen people people see they aren't no you listen see if Paul didn't say the same thing and he was a Jew see Abraham had 11 Sons you know that didn't you and they were all the Seed of Abraham they were all the Seed of Abraham but in Isaac thy seed Shall be Called not in the rest of them not in the rest of them not in ish hold that not in ishel not in the other nine Sons or the the other the third wife he had no it was in Isaac was the seed called in Isaac and Isaac alone not his other Sons not in Ishmael and Isaac alone now this Covenant we know Israel is a covenant people this Covenant he says brother says KES Baria this message this Covenant Israel down in Egypt on account of Disobedience of selling their brother Joseph remember there the 11 brothers or 10 Brothers actually sold uh Joseph down to Egypt Benjamin hadn't been born yet uh well somewhere along at that time anyway Joseph never did get to see Benjamin so they sold their brother Joseph down to Egypt but we know why to preserve life but he said now and and was taken down into Egypt and was there 400 years under bondage actually they were there 430 years but 400 years under bondage he said I want you to notice they never lost their Covenant they only only lost their freedom not their Covenant they were down there 400 years they didn't lose their Covenant they just lost their freedom amen when God made the Covenant with Abraham Isaac and Ja Jacob that he swore by himself that he would save Abraham and his seed after him God's Duty bound to keep that promise to keep that Covenant amen God Amen oh man when you think about the the sovereignty of God how great God is God's promises are yay and amen whatever he said that's the way it's going to be I don't care how long it takes it's going to be that wayen now we know that the Covenant came through Isaac but Isaac had a half brother an older brother a firstborn brother Ishmael that's right look I want you to notice in a minute what brother says about Ishmael ishma was born through Hagar remember Ishmael was Abraham's son right Abra he was Abraham's son not through Sarah but through Hagar but he was Abraham's son you think you can even go back now what what was the what was the benefit of the firstborn son back in the Jewish time he he was he he had the birthright he usually got a double portion of the inheritance and on and on and on but see you still have even though ishma was born first that was not the promise amen Israel ishel we say now why did God permit a son to be born through this Bond's woman well the same reason like for Jacob and Esau Isaac and ishmail the church and the bride has to be this law of contrast and the brother said the seed shall not be air with the shook it had to be this law of contrast God had to permit that Cain and abble all the way down Judas and Jesus all the way down there had to be that law of contrast so God permitted it now we know all we know that the Arabs and The Descendant the Arabs are the descendants of Ishmael and even historians generally believe that that some of them descended from lot and some from Esau but we know they came from is Ishmael now in the Hebrew series brother Bown says this oh and this is this is beginning to we understand why now but God keeps his promise no matter how unreasonable it may seem God is obligated to his promise and Sarah thought that maybe she could have uh Hannah said but Hagar rather her maid to give birth to a baby through Abraham and she and he and she would take it and that would be and that became ishmail wh listen what he says that would be ishma which was a thorn in the flesh from then until now W that's a that's an understatement that's an understatement he said that was she would have ishma which was a thorn in the flesh from there to now steal a thorn in the flesh for out of there come the Arabs and they've always been that way there it is bottom line okay now we're beginning to get a little bit better picture here we got Isaac we got ishma we got Jewish people we got the uh uh the the sons of which are lot you know they're the the Palestinians and the Arabs and different lots of different sects of the Palestinians and Arab so for but they they're come from the sons of Israel Esau lot they're not from Sarah so we know that so watch this now God gave Canan to Abraham in Genesis 12 Abraham Isaac Jacob had 12 sons famine Joseph sold in Egypt 430 years later the first Exodus 40 years in wildness and then there during that 430 years those Seven Nations would which inhabited Canaan they developed that land I I just love that during that 400 years while uh the the was 80 Souls that went down Jacob and his family went down to Egypt and stay there and come out with 2 and a half million but during that 400 years you know you had the Seven Nations the Canaanites and jebusites and pites and all the different nations there they came they actually inhabited Canaan and God just permitted them you know to build cities and to build houses and to build walls and yeah they had Giants and had this that and the other but they cultivated the land they farmed the land started growing Vineyards this that other so now after 400 years God said okay the land's flowing milk and honey I got it prepared for you go take it brother man said God had them God had them oh Wicked Nations prepare Canaan for the Israelites to come in and take the lamb yeah that's right and then then you have a CES Bara two years after leaving Egypt KES Bara then they come they send out the the uh the 12 Spies and if and I preached the message on that if you want to if you want to really know the the real significance behind that who was the ones that actually ordered the spy mission God really didn't order although God the children of Israel said we we will send out men and we will go spy out the land to see whether or not we can take the land now God said okay if that's what you want go ahead and do it I'll I'll I'll sanction okay but the people is the ones that requested the spy mission God God God didn't need a spy mission he knew what the land was but the people wasn't sure and they wanted to know so the 10 spies come back with a bad report we can't take the land we got Giants we got wall cities we got this that and the other we can't take the land and because of that two million people died because of the testimony of 10 spies that's right false preachers if you will they died perished in the wilderness eternally separated only Joshua and Caleb saved out of that all those that was over 20 years old think about that it's good you got to make sure you you listen to the right report amen so they actually they they prepared that land and Israel crosses Jordan they take the lamb now the several hundred years and then you got the judges the Kings and Prophets and the Messiah comes un Israel then he he's rejected then you have the early Christian Church is birth now notice notice all I want you to notice a little bit now as we see all the people actually had control of Jerusalem so we're going to pick it up in the New Testament I mean there's been a lots of people there lots of people had laid claim on Jerusalem we want it we're going to take it we're going to inhabit it we're going to develop it we're going to keep it we know that uh Rome had it and a lot of a lot of countries had it before them and Titus destroyed it in ad70 and and killed M many of the Jews and dispersed all the Jews Josephus said there was 1.1 million Jews killed in ad70 and 97,000 would be enslaved and caused a mass dispersion to all parts of the world there they go all over the world Russia everywhere because of what they did in uh ad70 by Titus now notice quickly all the a lot of people who actually we want to call it owned Jerusalem for 2,000 years you had the Romans you had to you don't have to remember any of this you had pames the cusd which were the successors of Alexander the Great the branes the Arabs the Crusaders then the Ottoman Empire then the British hold held it from 1917 to 1948 and during this time there's there's been a a great dormant Islamic culture for almost 12 centuries that's that's why that's why Islam and the and which the jordanians of partam and Islamic and all and and Egyptians and all these surrounding countries are all Arab Islamic most Islamic faith and they they they dominated Jerusalem for almost 12 centuries that's why they think that's their land because said we we held it for the longest period of time but it wasn't their land actually they were squatters on the land but they say it's their land so you can see why there's a fuss in Israel oh all the cities of the world Jerusalem is the one that's the most sought after the most fought after the most battled over most disputed over and there's a real reason listen to now listen to this Gable's instruction to Daniels for nearly 2,000 years the Jews have been out of their Homeland scattered to the Four Winds of the Earth how that we could make this message last for weeks now we could go into detail we can chase Israel right back and show when it was scattered by the Roman Empire on their rejecting of the Messiah see what they did they rejected Messiah but God pro God blinded them yet but then they still rejected Messiah but God blind them so the Gentiles could have a way in oh dear God how she was drove to every nation under Heaven go back to Jacob Israel back to Genesis 44 and 45 and show back there how he blessed those Patriarchs and told them exactly where their standing would be in the last days he said I can point you exactly every nation of Israel every tribe of Israel stand exactly in the nation where it said that they would be and there they are today he goes on to say in also in that same message the Jews that we know now that's not the real Jew the real Jew that Jew Orthodox that has not defiled himself with the things of the world who's not went out and joined other churches and he's just kind of symbolized here joined other churches that's the ones that's returning Yonder living on cheese and bread upon the hillsides and he says they're not allowed in the Old City now hold that they're not allowed hold that they're they're not allowed in the old city now this was preached in 1961 not allowed in the old city had to build them a city on this side in no man's land with machine guns pointing both ways but he's beginning to put forth her buds amen see the 's at hand another quote he says in same message there's Ishmael and Isaac there's a Palestinian and the Jews Ishmael and Isaac standing there fussing about this land that's what the prophet of God said ishel and Isaac they're they're there today they're fussing about that land but yet she belongs to Israel if you happen to brother man says 61 if you happen to go over to Jerusalem they won't let you go into Old Jerusalem no you have to go first and let them explain it all to you the Arabs and then they take you over to the other side that's ishmael's children that's ishmael's children but wait there's coming a time when God's going to take it over amen they they won't let him into Old Jerusalem why would why wouldn't they let them to the old Jerusalem now here we want to get to not allowed in Old Jerusalem now and then I'm going to show you why a lot of you know this but maybe you don't know really really really really why the British controlled Jerusalem from 1917 to 1948 Israel declared dependence in 1940 then the Jews for the first time in 2,000 years uh are now have control of Jerusalem M somewhat that's 1948 somewhat at the turn of the century there was about 19,000 Jews living in the old city of Jerusalem and by the evening of May evening of May the 14 1948 there was none because see the the Muslims they drove them out killed them drove them out so forth uh even the jordanians they took over and the Brit had the British control and so forth and then they said you ain't ain't none of you Jews is coming into the old city we forbid it why so 1949 Jerusalem was divided under Jordanian rule which is Muslim is control Israel control the western part of Jerusalem the Jordanian Arabs control the eastern part of Jerusalem and here's the thing here's why they're all fighting and fussing about it the Temple Mount let's get to that the Temple Mount is 35 Acres on a hill a Rocky Hill that's where the Dome of the Rock is the Western Wall and the mosque of Omar in that 35 acre in encampment you want to say no Jews were allowed in the Temple mount in at that time that's why brother B said no Jews could go uh to the Western to the western part because the Muslims controlled it under Jordanian Rule and they wouldn't let him in the old city where the Moss was and so forth not allowed in the old city but he preached that 1961 but however remember June of 1967 five five years later was a Six Day War and that's when the Great for Jerusalem and Israel took the city of Jerusalem back over and now they control Jerusalem right that's right except for that 35 Acres which the Muslims still control what what it was the great battle for Jerusalem they fought it and they won it Israel gained control of the Temple Mount but only controls the security around the Temple Mount but Islamic what they call it wa core War governs the inside you can't go in there they won't let Israel Christians nobody go inside there only Muslims but they did compromise a little bit the Muslims and allow the Jews to to and the Christian to visit the Western Wall but that and that's just on one corner of it that's as far as they can go they can't go into the I say the mosque or any of that area there so but the Islamic conquest in the Middle East you know for the seventh century Palestine remained under Muslim control for just under 12 centuries and listen here here's a kind of a a thorn in the flesh look what they did out of so they they the the Muslims really the Islamic faith really under Muhammad so forth they they controlled Jerusalem for almost 12 centuries and in 691 that's when they built the mosque of Omar and why why did they build the mosque of Omar in Jerusalem and why did they build it on the exact spot where this second temple was built and Herod burned the city in Jerusalem on the exact spot the D of why did they build that MO mosque right on the spot where the Jewish temple was they build obvious wonder they build after spot because they want to lay claims on that city of Jerusalem so we're going to lay claims on we we we we control it now we're going to lay claims over we build our great big Shrine there and thus it's been for 15600 years and there she stands today but I'm going to tell you one thing brother said one day that mosque will be dust one day that mosque will be dust but it's not yet so right on the actual Temple site they built that uh they built their their Moss right there where the temple was where Titus burned it down okay go a little farther here and we now the Arabs purposely put that Moss right on the literal spot to stake out their claim and the right to the rock of the MOs that's where they built it that's why the Muslims are so determined to keep it they want it they're determined to keep it and that's why they want a two-state government and Israel said they ain't going to have nothing to do with it we ain't going to do a two-state but the Muslim they want a two-state government now you got to you got you got to understand look from the from the Muslim perspective okay they held it for all these years about 12 centuries Here Comes Israel come in they feel like okay it's our Israel is our homeland they come in and and uh well I don't want to get ahead of myself but they said we we own the land we're not going to let you have it well okay David B yurian says and we'll get that in a minute he says okay we're going to declare independence so he declares indep depence and guess what the very next day after he declares independence then you have Egypt and Jordan and Syria they declare war on Israel then you have the start of the war of independence that went on for nine months then finally they did an armers treatment like that said well we're just tired of fighting so just you know let them have it so so that that's where it stands but they are determined to keep that land why because their mosque is there and that's the third most holy place to the Muslim faith anyway besides Mecca and that other place now listen what let's let's see what does the Bible say about the Dome of the Rock what does the Bible say about the mosque what does the Bible say about that's remember that is a very very sacred spot where the temple was the Holy Place God God put his name right there for the Jews Daniel says 11:31 and arms and arms shall stand on his part they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice and they shall place the Abomination that maketh desolate okay Daniel's given a prophecy of the mosque of Omar that he build okay I wonder what Jesus said about it in Mark 13:14 Jesus said and when you shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet standing where it ought not even Jesus said it said is standing where it ought not amen that's what Jesus said so there in that that gives us which we don't need it but that gives us more uh credibility but we don't need that but Jesus said that thing should not be there that's why they call it Abomination that make it desolation standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them be a Judean Fleet of the mountains and so forth we know the prophecy but Jesus said shouldn't be there but he put it on the literal spot okay what did Brother Ram say about it let's see what he said brother Ram says in the 10 virgins he said and the mosum of Omar talking about the mosque of Omar was erected where the temple stood and Jesus spoke of that in Matthew 24 he said when you see the Abomination that make it desolation standing in the Holy place where the Prophet Daniel spoke said about it then in prining said he that readeth let him understand see when you see this Abomination the filthiness the filthiness the filthiness of the mo Mosque of Omar standing there where the holy Place once stood and today the Muslim stand the Muslim stands there exactly where the holy place right on the temple s the Mohammad Muslim stand as Jesus said it would be there Daniel said it would be there and Jesus verified that it would be so and Jesus said it shouldn't be there what a rebuke what a rebuke to Israel you look up and you see that golden dome every time you see a p picture of jerus all you see is the golden dome the golden dome the golden it stands out above everything that's a that's that's their rebuke to Israel saying We believe We own this land they're the sons of ishel where did who did he give the land to Sons of Isaac so why do they fussing Israel Jerusalem Jerusalem Jerusalem Jerusalem right on a place on the temple site the Muslim the Muhammad Muslim stands right there Jesus said it would Daniel said it would and Jesus ver fight it to be so what as I said what a rebuke to Israel and to God God gave the land to Israel Rome killed them and dispersed them and the Muslim built their Moss there in in the sixth Century on the temple side they want to lay claims on the land now let's kind of try to wind this down and bring together Jerusalem was made the capital Jew Jerusalem let's look at it I'm goingon to read this right quickly why is J there so many reasons so many reasons why Jerusalem is so important Jerusalem was made the capital by King David Jerusalem was the place where Solomon built the first temple Jerusalem was the place where the Jews returning from Babylon to built the second temple Jerusalem was a place of the life and the ministry of Christ Jerusalem is the second place where the Third Temple we built in the Millennium we understand that the Temple Mount is where the Muslim believe that the prophet Muhammad ascended un Heaven that's that's one reason the Muslim think that the temple side is so sacred to them they believe that Muhammad descended from the temple s side or where mosque is buillt that's where they say he had sended no they believe that yeah it's a lie and you know something else I read the other day I never did know that you know why they put a white horse out waiting for Muhammad to come back I didn't know this either they believed Muhammad had Muhammad Muhammad had a dream and I don't remember all the details of the dream but in the dream somehow he he flew on a white Force to the temp to the MOs to the side of the Temple Mount and there he ascended up to heaven he had a dream and he flew on a white he flew on a white horse now why they going to bring a white horse I he ain't got no wings but you know they going to set a white horse there but that's what they said Muhammad had a dream he F he got there on a white horse he flew there I guess he was trying to impersonate Christ who comes on a white horse you know whatever anyway Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel since the state was reestablished in 1948 Jerusalem will be the capital city of the world during the Millennium Jerusalem was the only city on Earth would God plac his name Second Kings and 2 Chronicles look the Ark of the Covenant was transferred and the temple was built there thus Jerusalem became Jehovah's figurative residence if you want to call it that Jerusalem was also called The Throne of Jehovah the Bible says all men ought to Worship in Jerusalem that's for the Jews the greatest place of worship that was in the time uh and was the city of the central place in the city of worship okay since God gave Canaan Israel to Jerusalem to Abraham and so for Isaac and and Jacob and so forth and David made a cupet at the capital system and Jerusalem was the life and Ministry of Christ and on down and on down and on down and David benan and listen I I read this the other day I just got to tell you David benan I'm close a few minutes David benan he was really the instrumental one to really to try to get Israel to P partition that so that they could be a state and as I said British owned it and and finally they the British said well we we can sell you some land and we're going to give you some land and you gone and so well and and there's a lot in that but they okay if that's the best we can do we'll take that but uh the the others the other Jewish people and leaders said no we're g we're we're not going to say that we got to go back to Palestine but they they couldn't but the British wouldn't let him go back to Palestine because they had rule there and David be just trying to plead with him finally the the British Parliament David beg he finally had a a meeting and he was talking with all the leaders of the British Parliament and he and and finally the speaker at the end of the meeting he says to David he said sir he said you think that Israel is your land you think you have a right to this land you want to take this land you want to declare independence he said do you have any document that were that that you can hold that gives you any uh right to to take Israel as your land David bid gear he just sat there for a minute he picked up his old Old Testament Bible he says this is my document this is my document God gave this land to Abraham and to Isaac and Jacob he said they killed and dispersed us you know in ad70 This Is Our Land we're going to take it back we're going to own it we do want it we have a right to it this is my document he didn't say no more he couldn't say no more cuz there was this document brother we have a right to the tree of life this is our document we have a right to every bit of it than thank God that he opened the seals thank God that he took the book we we have we have a document shows where we have a spiritual Jerusalem a place to go to thank you we do have a document just tell the devil we have a document I don't care what they say I don't care what the British Parliament say so finally so they wouldn't they wouldn't they wouldn't permit it but they had a mandate and the Mandate expired the Mandate for them to control uh Jerusalem expired on May the 15th of 19 1948 the at midnight the morning of May the 15th 1948 that's when the British mandate expired you know when they declare when David Ben Gan declared independence in Israel on midnight of May the 14th he knew in just a couple minutes they was going to expire we're declaring our independence right now and you know what happened right after on the 15th the next day then the three nations Israel Jordan Egypt declared war on Israel then you started the war of independence oh man and they and they and and they just had a few they just had a few guns let me just I'll just throw this in right now so they just had a few guns they just had a few guns a few machine guns and they said you know we need we we need we need some money so David M says you know we got to have some money we we need some donation from other countries Goldie Meer says I'll go to America oh no no said no no I'll go to America America she was a real Diplomat she went to America so here Goldie Myer that start the war of independence she goes to to she flies to the United States she lands in New York this is true she lands in New York with $10 in her pocket six weeks later she leaves goes back to Israel with 50 million starts with $10 six weeks later she goes back to Israel $50 million they bought tanks they bought guns they bought cannons they bought all kinds of and that's the way they won the war of independence thank God for America oh man and that's just that's just one of the that's just one that's just the start of this whole scenario how they want it supernaturally God opened up a door God opened up a door oh I'm just thankful for that okay now through all that let's hear the conclusion of the matter here's the conclusion of the matter Genesis 17-8 God speak un Abraham and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canaan for Everlasting possession and I will be their God there's a summation I don't care if you're talking about the Gaza Strip Golan Heights the West Bank now they're still fighting on portions of Israel still fighting about it you know but he said I'm going to give you all the land from Riv your euph frees to the Mediterranean all the way down God's it's all in there he specified what they have it's going to be their land it's their land God gave a right to that land and they're still fussing and fighting over part of it but you can see but you can see why and we could take another whole message to show why how many time how many times the the Arab people and we love all people but how many times they they they uh killed and they sh how many how many thousands and thousands of Rock Pockets even it was shot from Gaza if they if if if Israel did not have the Iron Dome system there would been thousands and thousands of isra Israelis killed but they have about a 90% kill rate of when they when they would send a missile up the Iron Dome would send another missile up explodeed mid air no damage but each one of them missiles cost $45,000 that Israel has to send up in the Iron Dome and they send up hundreds of them thousands of them you know who developed the iron D system collaboration with the United States and Israel thank God for the United States helping them again amen does the Bible say whoever blesses Israel will be blessed whoever curses Israel will be cursed I don't have the quotes when I show you he said look at them over there that this government is trying to hook up with the Arabs he said don't they know what the Bible said says about whoever blesses Israel blessed who curses be cursed he said when the when we turn our nation against Israel we're gone where we the nation our nation's gone anyway we know that but when they turn against Israel she's finished another quote I'm another scripture rather God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac I will establish my Covenant with him for as Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him how long is the Covenant it's Everlasting when did it start then when will it stop never Genesis 17:20 as for ishal listen as for ishal I have heard thee this God speaking as for Israel I have heard Thee I have blessed him listen he's got he's Abraham's son I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly 12 princes shall he beg and I will make him a great nation that's what he did for ishmael's children but there was a thn thorn in the flesh that's brother the Bible also says that talking about sons of Israel said Israel he'll be a wild man and he has but he says I'll make him a great nation but the next verse Genesis 17:21 but that's the best exclusion in the Old Testament but my Covenant will I establish with Isaac amen Isaac sons descendants of Isaac amen not ishel amen so now now we can see who owns Palestine who owns the land of Israel who owns Jerusalem Israel the Jews it's their land their promise their Covenant they own it Israel owns Jerusalem Israel owns the Temple Mount one and one day that mosque will be dust brother R talks about it that end in the Millennium they'll restore the temple worship and so forth and so on like I mean hey why do they have to restore I they're going to receive Christ but he said they will do it so they'll do it but it's got to be that last 1,000 years to finish out complete that time however anyway this where you come I want to read this last little we'll give you a little uh uh summation here of of uh kind of a timeline brother M talks about till the end as the musicians come kind of an interesting timeline brother B says in this quote sixfold purpose he says a confederation of church now listen this is really good a confederation of church WIll consolidate them together and bring bring the Jews into this confederation and bring them back to their own Temple worship again in the thus sayith the Lord out of the Bible and they will have their own church okay now the Confederation church is going to consolidate them with the Jews in a confederation okay they're going to make a of course who's going to who's going to actually head up the the confederation of churches is going to be the Catholic church we know that so Catholicism is going to make a covenant with the Jews okay they they are what now I just called this now fresh brother said now they are now a nation recognized is that right they have not they but they have not their Temple worship yet and when they establish the temple worship the church will be gone so we got a timeline there God will be deal God will be dealing with the Jews as a nation then when they brought then when they are brought into the Confederation Rome will break it in the middle of the 70th week three and A2 years he'll break that Covenant with them and cause the Abomination that maketh desolation to spread the consummation so that's when they'll destroy it then he'll take both Protestant and Jews and persecute [Music] them we'll be in glory we'll be at the wedding supper it's going to be the tribulation going to be a rough time for Israel they will prevail but it's going to be a rough time for Israel cuz they're going to those two prophets Revelation 11 going to call out 144,000 going to preach this same message seven seal to the bride same thing as the seven trumpets to Israel call out 144,000 they'll believe it they'll accept it it a nation will be born one day then guess what they'll break that Covenant then they'll then then they will kill the 144,000 and they'll kill them to prophets but God will resurrect them them up in the streets and said all the world will see them resurrect up and uh of course they send gifts and so forth they have a joyous time they because those two prophets will listen listen what he do he said these two prophets will stand up listen then they'll take both the prostit and Jew and persecute them and that time these two Prophet will stand up and curse the Earth that will not rain in the days of their prophecy and they'll call fire to heavens and everything else you just wait so after those two prophets do all bring a curse upon the land like that they'll kill them two prophets and they'll send gifts you know and they'll have their Great Big Christmas F you know festival and they'll send gifts to one another like that and three days later them two prophets are going to raise up uh we didn't plan on this yes and the Bible says then the whole world will watch them how they going to watch them satellite TV the whole world will watch him couldn't
