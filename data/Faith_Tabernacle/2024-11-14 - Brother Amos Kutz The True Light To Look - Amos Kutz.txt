day amen amen it's real good to have sister Ranna back with us uh tonight amen and also good to have brother Matthew Quinton with us tonight as well amen can we just stand to our feet as we invite brother Amos to come walk in the light such a beauty for Life comes where the two drops of Mercy are Bri shine all around us by day and by night it's Jesus the light of the oh will walk in life such a beautiful life oh come where the DW drops of Mercy shine bright just shine all around us by day and by night oh Jesus the light of the world oh will walk in the [Music] L our Bri shine all [Music] [Applause] my day and my night Jesus light of the world praise God hallelujah truly he is the light of the world is he not he is the only light he's the only light that we have thinking musicians that we have that gives us life I'm so thankful for that amen more and more as each day goes on my desire is to have more and more of him when you have more and more of him you get more light and if you want to see maturity in your life you've got to follow the season of the light there are certain seasons of the year you can't plant your your your garden in the middle of January you can't plant in October now there's certain things yes uh that are late bloomers like your turnips and certain things that are cold weather crops that can uh thrive in the cooler weather of fall but overall the ideal season is when that sun begins to rise and when it rises in its strength and it gets to that place where the sun is is almost uh as you would say it's almost 90° above you it's when that sun when the Shadows aren't real long in the middle of the day like it is right now you notice in the fall and the winter the Shadows are much much longer reason being said is the Earth has tilting it's tilting away from the Sun so that the light of the sun is shining on an angle and that shortens the growing season and it makes the air cooler in the polar regions especially where night becomes all the time you know most of the day and then you might have maybe an hour or two of where it just barely barely gets light but then it gets dark again and you're in that Perpetual Darkness I want to stay in the season of the Sun the full sunlight will produce the full benefit of the word in my life if we don't have the full benefit of the son then you're just going to get partial results amen so I I trust that that's what we our desire is tonight if you would turn with me in your Bibles and I want to take a text from the book of John's gospel chapter 1 I want to start reading at verse one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shine in the darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world let's read first John I believe it's 1 John 2 and8 you notice uh in in Reading there in first in John chapter 1 he says that that was the True Light which lith every man the True Light now let's look at 1 John 2 and8 and again we find that same phrase is mentioned again here and he says again in new commandment I write unto you which s is true in him and in you because the darkness has passed and the True Light now shineth let's pray Heavenly Father Lord this is your your blessed word and we know father God in this word that it it tells us what has already happened and we see Jesus Christ yesterday but yet Lord the promise is unto you and to those that be a far off even as many as the Lord Our God should call we even see that today that you're still the same today as you were back then but we're even in a in a more Progressive Time Lord because this as is a restoration hour it's also the mystery the purpose of our being the purpose of our existence the purpose of us being here Lord is being revealed as to who we actually are and the reconciliation Lord is made complete Lord in this hour in our souls Lord we won't have to wait to get over there to get right Lord we thank you that that we have been elevated to such a position in our soul that we are united in an invisible Union Lord even as I've just said that it just seemed like something just opened up to me Lord God may you help me to get myself out of the way thank you for the beautiful songs of worship our brother leading the service and musicians specials God we see how that all has worked together God we ask it now God you'd help help us Lord to illuminate us father God without the Divine illumination Lord we're up here wasting our time God help us Lord by divine revelation Lord to expound with the authority of the word we ask it now in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord so amen you can be seated I think I I sent a message out there and uh to our brother about the True Light is that right I think that's what we titled this tonight on the True Light to look now we're we realize that as I was saying there just a few moments ago it takes that full light we realize you know and I I'm aware of some of you are may be aware and some are not aware but this message has come under attack and it's a very concerted effort which means by that is it's a plan strategy to discredit this message if you don't already know it but this message has come under Fire in the Tucson newspaper it's come under Fire in the r Oak times it's come under Fire in the Hickory times in Hickory North Carolina and in Wisconsin star somewhere in newspaper up there and the Lord only knows where else Satan is determined or is determining in himself and I I I somebody asked me today how I felt all about that all I can say is I told them Satan's getting very worried he's getting very nervous well the nervousness ain't on my part it ain't on God's part I'm a part of God God ain't nervous I'm not worried why should I be a worried the devil's the one that's worried let's turn the table on him you see that's where the enlightenment of the authority of knowing who you are knowing your position in Christ you don't have to fear these things I'm not worried about it matter of fact I said it'll backfire on the devil some there'll be several people come to the message as a result of it some seed some there that's been laying dormant that was ordained to life predestinated to see the word it'll cause them to come on in the devil will be one miserable wreck after after it's all over amen that's the way I look at things I don't look at it with a negativity like oh we better start oh my goodness we better start looking for a place to hide we carry your cell phone with you they already know where you're at but the only thing is they can't fight find you you're head away in Christ they can't find you they might yeah he's he's there he's there but when they go to get you you're not there why because you're Spirit Le you're Spirit Led like a the people the king that was in that city with the prophet he said why they that that Prophet tells what you're saying in your bed chamber we thought we had them we thought we had his finger on him and all of a sudden they're not there what happened that's the kind of God I'm serving tonight he hasn't changed we're just getting to know him a little bit better than they did they had an understanding but now the whole thing's been opened up the whole thing and that we know that the scripture says that when the enemy comes in like a flood he to raise up a standard against it if the standard is not needed then there's no need to bring the standard but when the enemy seems to come in stronger it don't mean that he got stronger he just is trying a different trick you see God it's like I told somebody today God is not taken by surprise God remember this you should already know this by reading hearing the word God always has the upper hand now it depends where you're at and what you're looking at so that's what we want to talk about tonight Hallelujah we want to look at what the light shows us and so we realize that in this age and I'm just kind of navigating at this point to see which way the spirit is leading me but I want to read something and you this may sound a little bit different but brother randam said we are shadows of light now there's going to come a day and this is a little bit deep for you but if you're in the word you'll recognize where I'm coming from what we have right now in our soul the reconciliation is already in fellowship with God Almighty as far as God is concerned he doesn't even know that Terry Horn fa because he has been restored back to where he ought to have been but he's still in a house that's the shadow of light and the body is still falling so you got to realize when you get over there that's not going to be the time to catch up right now is the time to get in fellowship with God Amen see when an individual like you and I ever gets to the point that God you recognize that God doesn't even know or remember that you even fell we were born in sin coming into the world speaking lies the prophet tells us we should have come by Spoken Word seed we should have been spoke but we come the other way we bypassed that and we come the other way but now God is in this in in this situation with us of restoring us back not to a Doctrine although that's part of it that's part of the word but the person of God himself that you and I are being restored to him yes we meet him on his grounds his grounds is his word the doctrine and so forth you've got to approach God on that you must acknowledge God's method his tool for the day I don't mind saying but when Paul was here Paul said If any man preach any other gospel amen then what I preached unto you let him be a curse say well that looks like it all stacked up on one man and most of my denom National friends will agree 100% with me because it's there in the Bible God reveals nothing except he first reveals it to His prophets if I start here with Brother Bill and I I tell him whisper in his ear that there was this big blacking blue or calico cat that walked across mys sidewalk last night and then it climbed up a tree and then it climbed up on the roof of the house and it went down to the creek jumped across the creek then it decided to come back and it fell in and it jumped back out and maybe I add a few more details to it but I you get the point and I I tell him that by the time it gets around up here to the front to brother Levi and Little David sitting there I can guarantee you there's going to be a whole lot of lot of in there either missing or added in or not even original anymore that's and we still and people say well we got the Bible yeah we got the Bible and we got 10 million ideas about it God had only one interpretation in mind to his thoughts and you know I mentioned that to someone here not long ago and and it's like yeah you're you're right God only had one he did this idea well I I believe it's this way you believe in this way has nothing on it God is his own interpreter that wasn't just brother brandham saying that's what the Bible teaches the Bible teaches that God interprets his own word a prophet is a mouthpiece a spokesman for God to use and so there is there is so much at at at really you know a I think it's in the Book of Amos he says God does nothing but what he first reveals it to a Servants of prophets the Wesleyan Revival was started by one individual Sur there was other little shoots here and there that were coming up at the same time but there was one man John Wesley that pushed that thing through had to be a spear point so to speak Luther and all the way back Columba and all the ages of Martin irenius and the Apostle Paul that didn't that didn't throw the rest of them this okay you all listen to me I'm the boss and it's the way it is he didn't come with that kind of attitude to the pulpit to the church he came with the attitude this is a revelation of Jesus Christ and I pray God will reveal it to you as he has to me and he established the gospel sure there was Apostles evangelists among the Jews that was already fainting out and Peter we know the house of Cornelius the gospel God used Peter to bring the gospel to the Gentile and then Paul carried started to carry the chorch and then we find that there was the book The Bible the new testament which I believe is still going on by the way it didn't end we are still in the New Testament age it's all going to end when we come down to that great white Throne judgment and then there's a new heavens and a new Earth and then we're going on and even then there's still scripture that says that indicates God will continue to unfold himself throughout all the ages to come but then only God we could almost say we could not necessarily close this book but we'll see a completion of things I'm waiting no completion on my body I'm waiting for a change of my body my heart is already been restored so what am I doing about that well I tell you you're looking at me and I'm looking at you and I'm looking around my what such fine instruments we got up here but what are we using them for play devil music rock and roll on the drums you these microphones and screaming into them like a bunch of banshees when I was growing up it was icid Rock psychedelic Rock noise Rock whatever you want to call it drug Rock they did things with instruments I didn't even know instruments could make a sound like that but look what's what we're using them for I'm not looking at them drums I've got to have drums I just got to have that beat in the church to get myself excited my focus is way off but I used to walk in them shoes I'm probably a solo on that one the way it sounds but I'm impressed to say I'm not I'm not really in touch with reality I'm impr impressed by these monitors I'm impressed by the fact we can have a service over the Internet through a phone connection through a I guess it's it's a it's a cable line I'm impressed I'm impressed by the lights but there's something that's greater I'm not here just because of that that we got heat and air conditioning in this building that's good but I'm here for another purpose and that's to see Jesus Christ in his word this is a house of correction this is a house where we can come and worship and we can go into the into the structure of God the structure of his word and know how to live why said I thought we got the Holy Ghost we do just your body ain't got the Holy Ghost that's why we still have a house of correction that's why I need to be corrected God that's why God has ordained gifts into the church to help us to walk the way to point out the pitfalls to point out all the Shady spots that the devil lays out for us you got a lot of light in this room like I said before that light ain't going to help these plants the other night I seen sister Faith bring a light up here and over there plugged it in and turned it on and they're flourishing just like they was outside a man has somehow tapped into the knowledge of God and the science and so forth of God and knows how to recreate that light that's out there through an electronic light I can't really explain it is I believe it's ultraviolet but now those lights if you if them things just we left them lights on in here those plants that look miserable after a while wouldn't take long they get sick they get doy they get the leaves that start turning yellow or whatever it signs of death what a sickness lead to death and so what about you and I without the light we're going to get sick and without that light we're not just going to get sick but Satan would try to kill us and he he even try to kill us physically if he could what did the Bible say for the lack of knowledge my people are destroyed the lack of knowledge of the word of God to implement it into our lives you see we're yes we're we're ruling Christ is ruling from our hearts but every day I got to put up with this and I've got 10 million other people out here that I've got to show the love of God to my neighbors and sometimes hey I I the shoe's been on the other foot I haven't always been the best neighbor I'll be right up front and tell you right now how about you have you always been very neighborly and Christlike or if uh just like every year well I better not you know it's fall the leaves are flying everywhere about the time I get my yard clean a big windstorm M and my neighbor's just a little bit slow getting his leaves up and they all come over into my yard he don't come over into my yard to get him up yeah I don't know about you but I'm expressing myself and I'm letting you know these are things that we still have a a carnal mind that we need to bring under subjection by the Christ that's on the throne of our heart and pray for our neighbor pray for your brother and many times is not the unbeliever it's right amongst the brothers and sisters somebody said something or somebody did something see then that's the time or be living in the light think of brother T well I won't get into that but it's walking in that light constantly it's a battle brother Brown said that Satan has a Punch coming at you he said you might miss an accident you might miss this you might miss that but somewhere if God carries there's an appointed time for you to leave here and it may not be the way you want to leave think about that I think of brother Christian we were talking about it before service tonight nobody wanted to see his dad leave no one he was a Believer God God knows what he's doing I say God search my heart but at the same token I I want to reach out I want to pray for brother Christian give him you know and I failed on that already but we need to reach out to our brother and his mom I know they've got a little church there in New York but still he's part of the body we care for one another if there's an injury what do we do we nurse the injury we get it back to health we clean the wound you know or we bandage it up you pour in the oil and the wine do what we can to try to make their life a little bit easier cuz I really don't know what that's like I never lost my dad like that I almost did one time so you got to think about those things sensitivity we live in a time of insensitivity and I'm probably one of the worst ones being sensitive to other people's needs sometimes people just don't need more Doctrine they just need a god with skin on it that's what they need you see brother BR said we've got to put ourselves into their shoes don't criticize your neighbor what's the old inan proverb you know you don't you don't criticize your neighbor until you walked in his shoes several miles then you will understand and that's that should be our attitude and Christ is not he's also a compassionate God he's a you know his word That's What doctrine is really there for to show us the it's not all about judgment you know is we know there's a life and death situation the Bible says a soul that sinth it shall die but he's also a compassionate God and I was thinking of that Jesus last stars on the cross one prophecy after another is being fulfilled amen and he looks down there and he sees the woman that allowed her body to be a vessel for the sperm and the Egg to be created within her not the Immaculate Conception now we don't believe that and he looks down there and he sees her heart is torn she doesn't maybe even have a full understanding at that point I that that's kind of back and forth on that her heart is shredded Jesus last hours he looks down there and he sees her heart is bleeding for him for what he's having to go through and he looks at her and he says woman notice woman not Mom not mother but woman Behold thy son son Behold thy mother and the Bible says he took her I believe it was John or whoever that disciple took her to his house that very day in his last moments when he was getting ready to leave his body and descend as a sinner into the regions of the Damned and suffer as a sinner for you and me he's still thinking about others and then the thief on the cross the two thieves today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise how he got the words out I don't know because he was in incredible suffering and the weight of your sin and my sin is hanging on in the way of the sins of the whole world because it was a sing onetime sacrifice a onetime shop a one-time stop that sin was going to be dealt with but yet he's thinking when he was on the cross I was on his mind but he looks over and there's that that Thief we deserve deserve to die this man has done nothing wrong and he tells him today you'll be with me in Paradise Lord I'm just preaching the way it's coming out the way it's coming to me now what we look at we're looking at something we might be thinking about that house we're working on we might be thinking about that car and God give you a good car you're about to get it paid for you're thinking about that hopefully not right now maybe you're thinking about this that and the other what's in the Forefront of your mind I want to read to you how many knows what the second commandment is right off the top of your head Exodus chapter 20 you're looking at something tonight we're all looking at something you're looking at a vessel here I'm looking at a vessel there has fallen but I'm also seeing something else in you and you're seeing hopefully you're seeing the same thing in me you're seeing a light you're seeing a life I hope my neighbors see that I want them to see that amen less of me more of him Exodus chapter 20 on the second commandment verse one and God spake all these words saying I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other gods before me commandment one number two thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image or likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the Earth verse five Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God I'm glad he's jealous over me now that's not the kind of jealousy you know a man would about kill another man for making a comment about his wife but he said a real Christian would pray for that man of course I might have something to say about it but sometimes love is tough agree but brother brm said you pray for that Poor Man's lost soul when a man that's an unbeliever about kill the other guy and sold his wife the prophet said but I'm thankful God is jealous over me because we are his bride and he has no other he loves you he loves me we are his bride a many membered bride he has eyes for no other as sister Alice sings that song Sometimes what a beautiful bride she is and he's jealous so what about now I want to say something here God looks down and he sees the character of himself in you and I right yet we are an individual brother Ram said it there is a quote where he says we are the feminine part of God you got to recognize who you are now do you know that God and I I want to say this don't nobody get the wrong idea but God worships you he thinks of you as his handiwork well that's what the Bible says is this Bible God's holy word what what did the prophet tell us about this bride bone of his bone flesh of his flesh makeup of his makeup only in the feminine form and he loves to see his purchased redeemed bride he's already looking at you you're just waiting for your new body he already sees you in a new body he doesn't even remember that you fell amen that you came to the world with a Naval he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't remember that God that's how deep it goes when you see that what are we waiting on we're waiting for the completion of the Bride the Readiness of the Bride the ripening in the sun and the full maturity and it is coming to maturity and it will come to maturity it's will will come amen I find it very fascinating on this maturity thing we got Believers here of all many different levels see these two young boys up here Brother David brother Levi yall are believers you're not just doing this because Mom and Daddy I think you already feel a pull you want to do this you don't have to say yes or no I won't put you on the spot but I think you want to be here I think you enjoy the services you clap your hands and not because there's something inside you that yeah I want to do that by the way God doesn't make us do anything we want to do it but I find it very fascinating that one of these mornings between six and nine that everyone that is elected predestinated to go in that Rapture is going to be there not one shy so if you ever wonder about your maturity level am I going to make it let me tell you something we're all at different levels yes but about the time that you think you have a long ways to go maybe just the hour like our brother didn't know it but he reached his maturity level amen he may have thought I got a long ways to go see God don't look at you try to perfect this flesh it's never going to happen I don't care if you Liv for a thousand years with the Holy Ghost in your soul you'll never perfect this flesh yes you will get closer to God yes but one day Enoch got so close to God God said hey buddy hey my son we're we're closer to my house than yours you know what I've only said this in public just recently his work was finished no doubt you say what was Enoch's work the pyramid line upon line of precision to the thousands of an inch God said I want you to build me a testimoni and stone and you will have access this is a Model T forward compared to what he had or even a horse in buggy they had an advanced science that was Far Beyond ours but none of those things in that world in which Enoch lived he didn't go and live as an Amish and I love my Amish Friends by the way we got brother here tonight who former Amish but I love my Amish people anyway I pray for their souls even if they're not called it they'll come to know Christ as their lord and savior before it's over but Enoch lived like everybody else no doubt had a construction crew and access to the most scientific advanced technology for that time and he may have been a wealthy man for that fact looking at that pyramid I'd venture to say he had to have some books in his account to pay those workers and the rent on that specialized equipment for that hour are we not living in the same thing as it was in the days of but regardless of all those impressions of fascin ations to the human mind see that's where we have to battle against these things I like to restore a car that I used to drive I like I like things to fix things but my focused in life my general purpose in life my main focus is driving down that road staying between the yellow line and the white line if I get to looking around then I've got a Wandering up and I'm worshiping my surroundings and I'm going to have a wreck I got a snow plow like I used to up and down this hill out here had to keep my eye on that road big old plow Lord I don't know how in the world I ever got around some vehicles on some of these roads I a plow you got to turn it all the way either to the left or to the right to get that angle to minimize the space yeah because you'll run a vehicle off the road or take the side of a vehicle out yeah there was times I stopped going down OT Road anybody that's been down OT Road or a Kaba road down here in the Kaba Valley I stop wait till they pass and I go on my way but all of that science that Enoch had access to he kept his eyes on the prize his walk with God he said I believe God I want to please God and he built a permid I'm a working on a building I'm a working on a building I'm a working on a building for my lord for my lord it's a holy ghost building Bible and stone King's chamber Queen's chamber death burial Resurrection it's all in the pyramid it's there the prophet said Enoch build it and then they he said don't put a headstone on it but God said it I'll do it I don't know if Enoch really understood why The Headstone why he wasn't tall to put a headstone on it somebody said ton that to Enoch you're doing a mighty fine job but and you say you're finished why ain't The Headstone there looks like something's missing yes it was missing cuz it wasn't that hour but there was a place for it so God has made a place for you he has he has chopped out and after he's chopped he's ground and he's filed like Michelangelo on a block of stone and there's a place for him to reside as a headstone in your life praise the Lord I don't know if it makes any sense to you David said I will set no evil thing before me I will set no Wicked the 101st Psalm I will set no Wicked thing before for me now what about my loved ones what about my friends what about my neighbor what about the citizens of the state and the country and the citizens of the world do they not walk by light also yes it's not totally dark there is gross Darkness coming upon the people the pope has already declared that now we can bless same-sex marriages you didn't know that it's official the pope gross Darkness upon the people but in the evening time it shall be light don't tell me we can't have light in this hour don't tell me that it ain't possible to have a light to guide us and that God's going to have a beautiful bride whose garments will be unstain by the world not stayed by the things of this world there's times I was on the job and boy I had some good people that I work for there was just times I was glad when the shift was over all that cigarette smoke country music or rock and roll playing all the radio I was glad when the shift was over and you know what some of those things left an impression on me I'm on now you know you we've got to guard our mind guide her guard our eyes this world's got a lot like I said I'm impressed but I'm more impressed with the revelation of Jesus Christ brother brandham said if there's anything that we need more of we don't need more Science and Technology yes they help us thank God for the heat the air conditioning here thank God for the sound system thank God that we can reach beyond the four walls go on to cyers space but our focus is on Jesus Christ cuz someday there'll be no need of cyber cyers space so be no need of an automobile or a power plant yeah my wife and I drove through Canada on our return and on our way up in Wisconsin Minnesota never been there in my life but uh it was awesome about the same time we got up there brother Steve said you ought to see our night sky I went outside and looked around up there I didn't see anything he said her night sky is just full of the Northern Lights very visible some of you seen them some of you you post the pictures there all some up there and in cenone I didn't really look to be truthful with you but you know the handy work of God but yet the whole world even in its Fallen condition uh don't get me wrong even in its Fallen Condition it's still beautiful but if you ever got one glimpse of what it should look like be you yeah brother Ram said do I have to go back right remember when he was taken beyond the curtain of time he said do I have to go back why did he say that cuz this world looked pretty spooky when you seen those people over there and there was no sense of physical or physical touch of the the normal human that was all gone yet he said I could feel them they could speak to me they were real in a theophany he didn't want to come back so if if he felt like that then what about you and I if we ever and we just believe what the prophet said believe it it's true what was Sister Longoria down there in the hospital or wherever she was before she passed and brother Danny can't remember the last name no Williams she come back she said to brother Homer he's just as funny as he was when he was here she was seeing things like so many others that once they caught a glimpse don't want to come back here now you young people it'd be hard for you to relate to that and even me I put myself in that yeah I'm not I'm 64 yeah I'm not young but I there's certain things about this life that I do like but if I ever can allow myself to see without even seeing with my eye see with the eye of Faith what the prophet has told us what the word tells us about my future home I'm homesick for it I believe there's a place over there right now with my name on the door hey can you prove it you got the picture you got the video I've got a vision a revelation from the word of God that's me that's my future home I believe what the prophet preached when he said future home what is that it's a revelation it's a Heavenly light I didn't read any quotes tonight and I got a bunch of them and I'm out of time but there's one quote I do want to read this is taken from a message preached in 1960 to whom shall we go now listen I talked to you about this before in a false light there is the thing is this is all false light by the way this is false light now you got to get the right perspective of that if you look at me you're looking at a flop of failure you're looking at a flawed human being but if you can see Christ if I could die enough and crucify the old man that you can see Jesus Christ in me then my life is fulfilled my purpose is fulfilled and God gets the glory I'm actually that's why I said keep your eyes on the road stay in the middle of the road stay in your lane if you get to looking around and all these other attractions yeah these other attractions will cause you to have an accident you got to keep your eyes on the road amen whatever you might be it's a false light you might be in the russellite church you might be in a campbellite church or some other light listen some other light church that's what he says but until you get in Jesus you're not in light yeah you're not in light you're still in darkness now theay of seeing people stumbling around God only knows when a person crosses a line that's not for me to determine matter of fact I don't want to know but people are still as long as the life is in their body the blood is still here for the sinner look and live my brother live look away from television look away from these worldly things look to the brght serpent on the pole look at live you don't have to perish that's Moses lifted up the serpent Jesus said in John 3:14 so must the son of man be lifted up what did the brass serpent on the pole represent it represented your sin already judged on him and if they looked it was a foreshadow of Jesus Christ who became sin he who knew no sin became sin that we might be the righteousness of God and I say to you the righteousness of God I mean exactly as the Bible says it there ain't a first righteousness and a second righteousness there's only one righteousness of God you're not second you're not a factory second God's only got one of you and he's proud of his work they put Mercedes on that car used to drive brother Terry because they were proud of the work and they want to show it off they put BMW sister Lisa driving around here also in the Mercedes God bless her heart they put their name on it Ford Chevy Honda they put their name on it wherefore they are not ashamed to say this is a product of our technology what about you what about your Michelangelo you're not a piece of stone but you're a living a living soul and he is shaping and molding In His Image and you're battling this flesh each and every day you battle a mind you battle a spirit memory conscious reasoning affection every single day don't tell me you don't because you do I do but we're successful see God sees Perfection when we don't that's right and God sees a need when we think we're complete praise the Lord anybody thank God for that Pastor that visiting Minister come by and rake the hide off of me praise God I needed that thank you Lord I passed you know what God is so sure of you and I he says you've already passed from Death un life and you will not come into the Judgment I'm getting away from this microphone forgive me you will not your judgment was already met in Christ yes we'll stand before the Judgment seat of Christ yes that is true but not to see where our flaws were where the rewards will be given out you're getting your flaws right now yes there is things that we can do yes there is a Draw N to God it's not many times that's why we have preachers and teachers and evangelists and missionaries a fivefold Ministry to show us these things where we need to brush up and improve our lives where there needs to be some more dying out maybe some hidden jealousy some hidden lust in the flesh thou shallal have no other gods before me no images images images all around me yes we enjoyed the countryside but if I was a sinner man and I looked at that and and not even knowing but what I'm seeing is a Fallen World sure it's beautiful it still retains it retains that you he doesn't see anything else it's the most beautiful world he's ever going to see if he don't repent that's right he won't be in the new Earth he won't be in a new city he'll be in a lake of fire no matter young people older people your heart the Bible say he's deceitfully wicked and who can know it every person need to be born again brother Bram had to be born again every man of God Paul had to be converted he was a murderer a religious murderer intent on locking people up killing people Stone and Steven he had to be born again and the old nature had to die because you could look at you could live out here on the side of a mountain or in some beautiful Valley that's remote and isolated like I see in Pennsylvania I say boy if it was up to me I like to go in them valleys that are about 50 60 70 Mi long and they're only about 3 miles wide nothing but Farms beautiful mountain sides straight As a Razor for miles until you see the the mountain dive into the Earth whe the Earth meet the top of the mountain The Horizon meets the Earth if it was up to me that's where I would be I always dream about having a big Stone Blue Stone House two chimneys on each end of the house but you know what even if I saw everything good without a Chang in my heart I'm still a wretched sinner without God so were you and I thank God it's one good thing about memory we still remember but we were talking here a minute ago oh family we know oh they're going to they got some things to deal with I used to read a lot I still still do I want to make sure I read more of the word but I read enough of things about the battlefield I understand why these guys get PTSD I wouldn't have to go into the Gory details but if you're seeing somebody there that's standing there or Crouch down in a foxhole with you and all of a Sol sudden a shell explodes right above you and a piece of shrapnell takes half of his back out his spine is exposed and he's dead just like that living one moment dead the next and there's a lot of other gory stuff going on because it's indiscriminate when the bullets are flying they're meant to get somebody the recovery teams going out there in the battlefield it it it's it's see that's the side nobody wants to talk about these body bags and stuff they almost have to use sometimes forks and shovels yeah yeah that's what this military hardware is designed it's horrible it's hideous yeah soldier that was once a baby in a Mother's arms disintegrated there's nothing even to go back home for the mom and dad or family wife children to see thank God the Prince of Peace it's going to be raining on this Earth there'll be no more of that that's hideous and I'm saying here let me finish this quote in closing y'all can stand with me I hope I didn't know upset Somebody by that sin is not beautiful it is horrendous it is hideous it is vicious it is Savage people will do things that they're anointed by demons they'll do things they ordinarily wouldn't do you don't have light till you come to him for he is a way the truth and the light and the only way to God no man cometh to the father except by me so you can't go to God you can't go to heaven you have to get in the way Jesus is that way he is the only truth there is he's the only light the only true light the only true manifested light is Jesus Christ we have Mormon light Methodist light Baptist light Pentecostal light we have all kinds of Lights remember they're lights but anything that don't bring you to the full truth and relationship with God is a false light Samson had had a vision of a beautiful woman in his [Music] eye was nothing wrong with him Desiring to have a girlfriend or to have a mate he just got down there with a worldly crowd that he was trying he'd been called to [Music] defeat and he started seeing images images and the first thing you know he ask her out they start seeing each other what a pecul thing what A peculiar thing here he's raised up by God to break and loosen the chains of the Philistines and what's her name Delilah she was a light say what do you mean she's a light she was a light I can see you you can see me and he's seen that woman and she was do out a pretty thing oh yeah oh yeah the devil knows how to do it see there's nothing wrong with beauty that's why we want our sisters to look beautiful a sister that's just in her to look good look right for her husband [Music] that don't mean you got to wear a slit skirt high heels all that stuff's coming [Music] back see they're looking at something they're looking at something they're not looking at the word if you look at the word you want to conform to Christ you don't want Christ to conform to you you conformed to Christ look theila has her on his mind playing with fire it wasn't long she won she become king she became his light he he put off looking at the light of the call that was on his life before he was born and he temporarily started looking at her and she took him away maybe she didn't even realize what she was even doing but she was a pagan and a heathen she probably enjoyed his company yeah but she had a heart that was deceitfully wicked she didn't even live true to him he was playing with fire she was just trying to get him when they come to her and they started rolling out the cash said you got to get him for us you got to find out what's causing him to keep moving like a bulldozer yeah and finally finally she wins his confidence he was putting his trust in a false light a false light that had a ro map that would actually lead to his own naturalizes being ruptured out of his skull and he would never ever again see another person the devil thought he had him one day skipping a whole lot he reached back here and no doubt when he was out the mill he was praying oh god I've been a I've been a loser I failed you God something was happening his hair was starting to grow out his facei was starting to he couldn't see like that devilish little guy that was going along poking him with a real mean grin I don't know if you ever seen that picture poking him and jabbing him to keep moving keep moving grind he couldn't even see but there's one thing that they couldn't take away he was elect he'd been a failure yes he brought disgrace on Israel there one thing he still had he had his spiritual vision and he seen God by Revelation oh Lord just once more Lord once more our Lord he had a vision that the devil couldn't take from him and he was victorious in his end all kinds of Lights Jesus is a True Light he's the only light we are the children we're born again we're Children of the day the children of the world walk in darkness they walk at night time they love darkness and I go so far as to say the religious crowd they love a cloudy day cuz it gives them permission that they think to do all kinds of things that you and I with the light of the word would not even want to do get married the second time lot of lot of things you can list [Music] them you're born again you're Children of the day the children of the world walk in darkness they walk at night time they love Darkness the Bible said men love people love Darkness more than they do light because light would manifest their [Music] deeds let the sun come up every old lizard every old bug insects of the dark kingdom crawls at night will take under something that's the same way when the Gospel Light begins to shine every evil deed will try to crawl under something oh they say we got light because we live at night time yeah yeah they do got a light like I say cats SS can see at night dogs can see very well at night cuz their eyes are adapted for that but they're living in darkness and doing things of the dark times he said every old every old bug insects of the dark kingdom crawls at night will take under something that's the same way when the Gospel Light begins to shine every evil deed try to call on or something we got that light because we live at nighttime if you walk in in the light at night time you're walking under a artificial light [Music] wow if you walk in the light at night time L it a seea they say we can see God said you're blind you're blind what makes a blind images Easy Living the temptation of Easy Living slothfulness because of the Comforts of the flesh Science and Technology maybe we ought to go back to old bear wooden boards on the pews better not go down that one he said oh they we got light we live at night time if you walk in the light at night time you're walking in in under a artificial light there's only one true daylight remember it was a cloudy day Zechariah 14 7 and 6 and 7 8 it was a cloudy day but in the evening time unusual why it's the end of time not so much an ending of day yes an ending of day the seventh day but in that hour in the evening time it shall be light there's only one true daylight that's sunlight there's only one true Christian light that is the light of the Son of God he's the only true light in him is

held responsible because the truth come now they're under an indictment no more brother Terry you know this as well as I do and all the rest of you God waked at ignorance he waked at the United
