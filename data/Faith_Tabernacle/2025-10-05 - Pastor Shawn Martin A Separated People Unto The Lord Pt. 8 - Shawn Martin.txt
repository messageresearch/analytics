Now little David unafraid before the giant he stood that day and it seemed to be the end for little David. But like the lion in the bed that he slew that old giant he had to come to. The battle's not mine. I give it to you, Lord. It's thine. I said, "The battle's not mine." Said, "Little David, Lord, it's that I'm in your favor. I knew not what to do. Lord, I knew not what to do. I'm so glad you made me see that you're really all that I need. The battle's not mine. Give it to you, Lord. And it's that now little David he stood tall and that giant he's so small. Sweet victory had rained for little David. Oh cuz he gave the battle to one who believed in getting things done. The battle's not mine. I give it to you, Lord. It's not. The battle's not mine, said little David. Lord, it's not. I'm in your favor. I've given it all to you. For I knew not what to do. I'm so glad you made me see. You're really all that I need.

[Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe the battle belongs to the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we stand to our feet as we invite our pastor to come? Just a little while to stay here. Just a little while to wait. Just a little while to labor in the path that's always straight. Just a little more of trouble in this low and sinful state. Then we'll enter heaven's portals, sweeping through the pearly gates. Soon this life will all be over and all pilgrims will end. Oh, soon we'll take our heavenly journey. Be at home again with friends. [Applause] Heaven's gates are standing open, waiting for our entrance there. Oh, some sweet day we're going over. All the beauties there to share. Oh, just a little while to stay here. Just a little while to rain. Oh, just a little while to to labor in the path that's always straight. Oh, just a little more of trouble in the slow and sinful state. And then we'll enter heaven's portals, sweeping through the perfectly gate. Soon we'll see the light of morning. Then the new day will begin. Oh, soon we'll hear the father calling. Come my children, enter in. Then we'll hear a choir of angels singing out the victory song. [Music] All our troubles will be ended and we'll live with heaven's thr. Oh yes, just a little while. [Music] in the wild. always straight. Just a little more of trouble in this low and sinful state. Then we'll enter heaven's portal, sweeping through the pearl, sing that chorus again. Oh, just a little while to stay. Just a little while to wait. Just a little while to labor in the path that's always straight. Just a little more of trouble in this low and sinful state. Then we'll enter heaven's portal, sweeping through the pearly gates. You know, that song is becoming more of a reality to us. Looking forward to that time and and it ain't going to be too much longer. And um I um you know, it's just an amazing the promises that we have and in in the future. Our future is so bright. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh there's just no reason to give up and to quit and Amen. pressing on. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. and the musicians can be dismissed and um uh enjoyed the songs today and the worship of God's people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um if you have your Bibles, we're going to turn to Deuteronomy the 26th chapter. And uh we want to remember our fall festival coming up uh November 2nd uh there be at the Pilot Community Center. And um also um this uh I'll be heading to South I think it's South Carolina. Is that where brother Fred Mullins is? South Carolina. So we'll be head I'll be heading down there. um um Thursday and um be a series of services there. So I won't be here uh Sunday uh but the Lord willing, brother Terry will be ministering here and um so uh we both covet your prayers. Amen. And um I've met brother Fred and actually he's preached for us there at our in our meeting a few years back. Um and so this will be my first time ministering for him and we just pray that we can be a blessing somehow and um u be ministering. Brother Andrew uh Glover, also brother Josh Martin and brother Solomon will be ministering there as well. And so um we really covet your prayers. We can just say something to help and uh we'll be praying here as well for the church and uh believing y'all will have just a wonderful time in the Lord. Also, uh, Brother Wayne called the other day and, um, we had scheduled, uh, for him to come December 5th through the 7th. And, um, he called to let me know that he forgot a special um, event that's going on. uh at that time uh brother Ray uh they're having uh a celebration or birthday uh for him on at that that weekend. And so he's asked uh to us see if we could change the dates to December 19th through the 21st. And so that's going to be the weekend before Christmas. Um, so, uh, I told him I would just talk with the church and, um, how many would be able to come be be here if we had that had it that close? Hands raised real high so we can see how many wouldn't be able to come. Um, for John, I'm gonna have to talk to you. No. And um um I I really he you know um he was supposed to be in um uh Canada um in between those weekends and he canled and um you know he just said I I could come but he then you know it kind of be unfair to the brother Tom Ray and them you know, and uh Brother Wayne's been a good friend, and he would do it if I asked him, but I I don't want to put him in a bind or pressure or anything like that. And so, um we we'll just plan on doing it uh the 19th through the 21st of December. And um uh so if you have told anyone about it, um just let them know the dates have been changed. We're kind of good at that uh this year, changing dates and but uh uh uh anyways, the Lord willing, I'll let him know and we'll uh uh just plan on December 19th through the 21st and believe we'll just have a wonderful time in the Lord. Amen. So, uh, before we go into the word, let's just bow our heads and talk to the author. Amen. Father, I'm so glad that we could call you such because we're your children. We're not strangers. We're not beggars, but we have come to realize, Lord, that were sons and daughters of yours. And Lord, you have asked us to come at your table and to feast upon your goodness and the things that you have prepared for us. And Father, we're just delighted to be able to come. We ask Lord that you would just take the word and portion it out to us, Father. And may we feast off of uh these promises. And I pray, Lord, that you would help me just to get myself out of the way. And Lord, not much of a preacher, but if you could just take the words that we'd say and Father, just put it and plant it into our hearts. And Lord, you know the needs. You know how to to meet every need, Father. And I pray that you would do it. Help us to grow, Father, and become more like you is our prayer. We ask that you'd forgive us of all of our sins and our failures, Lord. We give this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, if you would like to look with me um there in Deuteronomy and uh the 26th chapter and I'd like to start at the 16th verse. Says, "This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments. Thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. Thou hast devouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and hearken unto his voice. And the Lord hath advanced thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments, and to make thee high above all nations, which he hath made in praise, and in name, and in honor, and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the Lord thy God as he has spoken. Amen. You can have your seats this morning. And use the title holiness, a people separated unto the Lord. And what I I guess what I have to say is things you already know. And so I don't mean to sound reputious, but um I do know that Satan is a liar. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he's the father of lies and he's constantly speaking to us in one form or another and trying to convince us that we're not God's children and that we're not different from the world and and and these things. And so uh maybe just to keep us in remembrance of who we are, &gt;&gt; right? But all throughout the Bible, um God has has separated um you know, the prophet has told us uh several times that God is a segregationist, not necessarily not in race, but he's a segregationist uh when it comes to the world or to the the things of the world. In his dealings with Israel, he commanded them not to mingle with other nations. Israel, he dealt with Israel as a natural nation. And he tells them, don't don't mingle with the other nations. They were not to take on uh the habits of the of other nations. They were not to uh worship as in the way that other nations worshiped. Their sacrifices and altars uh were to be different uh from the other nations. um their their Sabbaths, their feasts were to be holy and even to their diet of what they ate was to be different from other nations as we see there in in um when Israel was taken away captive in Babylon and and um Nebuchadnezzar, you know, ordered that um Daniel and the the the the his three friends, the Hebrew children as we would call them, uh they they were to eat the same uh the king's meat and and such and and they said, "No, we're not doing that." And and so there there there was a difference in in what they ate and and these things. There was just things that they were to refuse. And so um um also uh when and them in captivity, we know that they refused to bow down to idols. They they remembered who they were and they kept themselves separated. Uh they they would not offer prayers to any other god uh but Jehovah. And we find even that throughout the Bible, God has separated his prophets from the false prophets uh uh by vindicating them. And God provided Israel to make a difference uh uh between Israel and and and and Egypt. He provided or and other nations. He provided to them an atonement uh which separated them from their sins uh there. And so we we find that God was constantly separating his people. Uh he separated them from the enemy as when Pharaoh went after the children of Israel to destroy them. Uh the Bible says there in in uh Exodus uh 14 and 19 says, "And the angel uh of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them. And it came between the camp of of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. And it was a cloud and darkness to them to the Egyptians, but it gave light by night to to these the is Israelites so that no one or or so that the one came not near the other all the night. Amen. What? So God would would would separate even Israel from their enemy as they're in in the will of God. And and I I I thought of of of how important that is to you and I uh that God is still separating us uh from from the enemy. He's he's he's not letting the devil destroy us. He's not letting the devil conquer us. &gt;&gt; And and and we should really be thankful for that. &gt;&gt; It ain't it ain't by our might. It ain't our own will. It's just God. Amen. keeping us the enemy away from us. Amen. So we we find also that in the the New Testament that God foretold of uh a separation that would come uh remember the wheat and the tears. They they they were planted in the same field which it was the world and and and uh they grew up together and and then God says there come a time that when they ripened then time of harvest that there would be a separation. God separating the the the wheat from the tears. He also foretold that uh there would be a cry that would come forth. Come out of her my people. At this time of separation, a cry would come, come out of her. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I believe that this is being fulfilled today. Amen. That there is a separation there and and God is making the difference clear between the two. Uh we find that the prophet taught us that God is sealing his elect today and Satan is sealing his people uh as well. And and brother Brandham in his prayer, he said, "We realize that that must come to that place that the chaff and the wheat must be separated. And we know that this is a separating time when the world will continue to grow worse. But the church will become more concerned and your spirit will get greater and more powerful all the time in the church till Christ and the church unites together. Can you say amen? So we see that there are two things happening. The world getting more carnal. The world getting more worldly. the world getting more gospel hardened and yet the church is becoming more interested in the things of God, becoming more uh uh concerned and the spirit of God becoming greater and more powerful in the church until Christ and the church become one together. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so there is a a people that is going in the rapture. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; And yet there is a people that's going in a tribulation. There is a people that is going to be caught up, amen, into another dimension. And they're going to live forever and ever. And at the same time, there will be a people on this earth continuing to age, continue to get older. Amen. To continue getting worse and worse. Amen. And and and they're going through the tribulation. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Those that go in the rapture are going to be part of that first resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh which is to take place before the tribulation uh sets in and the rest will go in in the second resurrection. And um uh the Bible says the dead live not the rest of the dead live not for thousand years. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, so then that rap group uh uh will be sitting on the throne at the white throne judgment. Amen. They will be giving the judgment. That's the bride. The others will be standing before amen the throne and being judged. Amen. And the prophet said about it, he he said, "Woe unto them, you know, that that that are left behind then." Amen. And he says, you know, God, let don't let me stand before that day. That that throne judgment, let me be flayed alive. Let let them open my belly up and pour suleric acid in it. And he's he's trying to describe the worst things that could happen to an individual. He said, "But let let that happen, but don't don't let me stand before the white throne judgment." Amen. So, it's going to be a time of uh of of of a great time. Amen. But there'll be two peoples um uh uh separated God separating. Can you say amen? You may be going through trials now. Amen. But thank God that you're part of the bride. You you may be going through things now, but it ain't nothing compared to what uh the rest of the world's going to go through. Amen. Because you've got an a promise that you'll hear, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant." Amen. You pressing and and you're you're pushing and you're forsaking the world and you're clinging to God and you're keeping your garments undefiled. Amen. Uh but there comes a reward with that. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; A brother told of how that he and his family went and down into a cavern. A guide had taken them and some other people. And so as they were on their way down uh uh in into this hole or cave, whatever. Uh uh the guy told them, says, "Now down there, he said there's a room where everybody looks the same." And so this brother said, "Well, this is going to be interesting. I like to see that, you know. So, they get down there and then the guy turns out the light and he says, "See, we're all the same." And the brother says, "Well, you couldn't see even see your hand before you, you know." And then he flips the light on and the light showed that they weren't all the same. And I thought, "Well, how how that is in in in in the world today." Amen. Because there there are people that walk in darkness. They're living in darkness. And and and and they tell us everybody's the same. There's no difference. It it's all the same. But if you're walking in the light of the word, then you realize, no, not everybody is the same. &gt;&gt; We're different. Can you say amen? Amen. And we're not to conform, Amen. into the world and be like the world and dress like the world and act like the world and and all of these things. We're different. How many believes you're different? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're different. And so uh we find that the Bible is full of people uh that God has placed in there to be more memorials for us. whether it's it's to look at their lives to be encouraged by and and and to to uh conform to or uh uh to look at and to shun and say, "No, that's but but yet they're memorials to us." And two of these memorials are Lot's wife and Abraham's wife, Sarah. Amen. And and we we find that, you know, Lot's wife, she chose to to live in the well-watered plains of Sodom and Gomorrah. She, the prophet said, she wanted to be sociable. Amen. And with everybody. She wanted to live like the rest of the women down there. Whereas Sarah kept herself separated, living in a tent and in the barren land and stayed there. But the prophet said the difference is Sarah kept the word in her heart. She kept the promise in her heart. And as because she kept the promise in her heart, Sodom and Gomorra didn't look appealing because she had a promise. Can you say amen? The prophet said she was obedient and lovely to her husband in so much that she called him her Lord. And there's where God came down with two angels and visit them in the tent. See, so Miss Lot became a a very worldly uh uh person and taken up with with the things of the world. And the prophet says now, he says if we don't watch it, we can become worldly minded, too. &gt;&gt; So, so we got to watch it. We we realize that there's a difference here. I am bride. How many believes you're bride? Amen. I'm bride. Now if if we don't watch it, we can become worldly and we can actually take on the characteristics of Miss Lot. Amen. See, and so he says, now maybe Miss Lot didn't mean to do that when she went down there. She thought, well, I'll just be sociable. It's all right to be sociable, but don't take up the habits of the world. It's okay to be nice and to be kind and and and and be polite and say, "How do you do?" Amen. But don't take up with the things of the world. Amen. He said, "When you go, go like Shadrach, Meack, and Abedneo and Daniel." They purposed in their heart that they would not defile themselves. No matter what came or what went, see, no matter whether the rest of the church backslid or what happened, they purposed in their heart. Can you say amen? So when we go out these doors and we go to school, we go on our jobs, we go to the the supermarket and and and uh uh and and all these things, we must go with a purpose in our heart. Amen. That as I've got to do these things, I am a child of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. So we are a holy people. A man that is called to show forth the praises of him. Amen. Who has called us. Amen. Now we as we said and we know that the world is under an influence. Amen. This influence is the power of Satan. And and Satan Satan only has the power to deform, not transform. &gt;&gt; Amen. He He only has the power to deform. And we we've read it. But the the the meaning of deform means to alter. and and and uh to alter the natural form or to misshape to disfigure. Amen. See, and and and so anything that is deformed is is taken from its original state. Amen. It once was this originally, but now it's this by the power of deformation. It's it's deformed and and all of these things. It and and the prophet said it becomes perverted. uh which means changed over made something different than what its original uh uh uh creation was. So then we could say that the drunkard, the the prostitute, the the religious sinner has been deformed by Satan's power. Ain't that right? And and we know that Satan's power of of uh to deform it it it it it doesn't just apply to the soul, but it applies to the body and and the mental and it causes limbs to be twisted up. It causes the eyes to not see. It causes the legs not to walk. It it it it causes, you know, deafness and all these things. Ain't that right? That's in the physical realm. But but then the soul is so twisted up under Satan's uh power of deformationation, see that people can't believe the word and and and they can't get delivered from things and because they're under an influence. Whereas the believer is under an influence that comes from God. And God's influence is the power of transformation. That's why you you stay under the influence of the word. Never never go into another influence. Don't allow yourself to come under another influence. Amen. That u uh there there's real spirits out here, right? Amen. I mean, they're genuine spirits. Amen. That are out there. But uh uh but God's power is real. Amen. So to transform it means to change in composition or structure or to change the outward form or appearance of to change in character or condition to convert. As we all know we were all at one time under Satan's deforming power. We were affected by it. uh uh what we were supposed to be and what we came out to be in our birth are two different things. What we were supposed to be is what God predestinated us to be. What we were is the results of Satan's deforming power. We were born with a carnal mind, carnal nature, an enemy to God. Did not know God. didn't understand his ways. Um we as the Bible says we were we walked in darkness without understanding and all these things. Did not know his word. We only had a carnal understanding. Ain't that right? The book was sealed up. Everybody say the book was sealed up. Uh it was forfeited in the beginning. Can you say amen? And I'd like to talk about that. See, see, Satan by his p his deforming power took us from our position. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Took us from our position. Man was made in the image of God. He was made to have dominion. He had dominion. Amen. Over the earth and everything in the earth. His authority was God's authority working through him. &gt;&gt; God made man for a chic channel, right? Amen. That's all we are is we're channels. Amen. You and and the prophet talked about it. You know how that uh there's an influence from above, there's an influence from beneath. Amen. There's them two powers. We're sitting here in the mortal realm in between. And these two influences uh influence every more m mortal person. Every mortal person in this realm of of mortality is influenced by either the influence from above or the underneath world. Amen. See, so so we find that God made man to be a channel. And and and a channel is something by which a thing is made known. A channel is something by which a a thing is made known. There are voices in the room. There are pictures in this room and they have been here since the beginning of time. Amen. But it's been only in the past uh hundred years or whatever or less or something to that effect that that man has developed channels &gt;&gt; which allows the voices to to be made known by radio. Ain't that right? it. He's he's come up with an instrument a channels it channels by which pictures can be uh made known. It's a the channel through and I I don't understand it all but but you know I looked up channel it it's a band of frequencies of sufficient width for a single radio or television communication. See, and and so we are we we if we get the right channel, we can hear voices in the room. If we get the right channel, there can be pictures here and we can see them uh uh there. So man was made to be a channel. Do you believe that man was made to be a channel? God works through man and unfortunately Satan works through the same channel. Amen. and see. So, uh uh have you have you just listened to like the AM station and uh radio station and you can be driving and you get so far out uh maybe and all of a sudden you're listening to something and then another frequency starts another voices or another um uh music starts coming in at the same time and you're trying to listen to this and maybe uh uh or you're listening to a a a talk show or whatever and you'll hear rock and roll coming in. You're like, "Where's that coming from?" It it it it two things coming in to the same frequency. See? And and and so it shows there's a weak channel. Amen. It it's something weak and and and things are filtering in. It's not a dedicated channel like it should be or or you're going out away from the the tower. Amen. to where it could send strong signals and and you're in between to where both signals are coming into one channel, right? Well, God doesn't want to Satan's power and his power working through you. It only causes confusion. Amen. He's trying to send a voice of this and Satan's sending a voice of this and you're just being a channel and anyone that's hearing you, anyone that is seeing you, it's causing confusion. I thought he was supposed to be a Christian and look what he's doing. I thought he was supposed to be this. I thought she was supposed to be this and and now I'm seeing this and and and it's just a constant uh there. But God made man a man to be a channel. Now I I will say because the prophet taught us neither God nor Satan can force themselves upon us. &gt;&gt; You were right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So how this channel works is man must surrender himself to either God his power or we or surrender himself to Satan's power and and and whatever the man, woman, boy, girl surrenders to, that's what becomes more prominent in their lives. Amen. That's that's right. Hell has been made manifest through channels because people have surrendered themselves to it. But yet God, we see through a prophet that that God was was able to make himself known as the same yesterday, today, and forever through a channel. He had one man that he that would be a channel that would surrender himself. Amen. And God could make himself known to where people thought it was Jesus Christ in flesh. Can you say amen? Amen. Well, it ain't just benom. We are all called to be channels for God. &gt;&gt; That's right. If if Satan is able to manifest his power in such a depth of darkness to where people behead each other and kids kill their parents in such a a horrific way and and and it seems like the powers are being unleashed. Why? Because people are surrendering themselves to it. When they reject the word, they surrender themselves as channels to Satan. But if they're doing that, then God is still alive. God remains true. He's still the same yesterday, today, and forever. He did not die when the prophet left the scene. There are still channels. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But man must surrender himself to either one. Adam had dominion over the whole earth over all creation including Satan. Satan was a creation. Satan was cast out of heaven down to the earth before the fall of man over what he did in heaven. He caused a revolt in heaven as we know. And the prophet said, "See, there's been a contest going on ever since between Satan and God. It started in heaven. Satan was kicked out of heaven to the earth. Other words, he could no longer maintain his position that he had on in heaven." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God took him from that position. No longer could he do that. And now he was cast to the earth. And the prophet said he then become an enemy to God's people. And since then he's used all of his strength and his stratey strategy to pull to try to pull God's people across the fires or into his fires. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, Satan had no power over man, right? &gt;&gt; Had absolutely no power. Amen. Man didn't know what sickness was, didn't know what heartache was, didn't know what diseases was, to have a broken heart, and he didn't know what it was to be addicted to something. &gt;&gt; He didn't know, you know, uh uh what it was to struggle with things as temper and hate and bitterness and lust and and all. He didn't know any of these things. See, all of these things come from Satan's power. &gt;&gt; But as long as man was in his position &gt;&gt; as God of the earth with domain, &gt;&gt; Satan couldn't do a thing about it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, and and and so but but Satan is a shrewd fella, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is why you must not give him time or day. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You must not give lend an ear to him. &gt;&gt; Must not lend your heart to him. &gt;&gt; You must not lend your thoughts to him. &gt;&gt; Your meditation to him. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you must not do that because anything he says is a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so in the garden, he was constantly devising a plan to cause man to fall &gt;&gt; or to leave his position. &gt;&gt; If he could get man to leave his position, then he could have power over man. &gt;&gt; He could dominate. Now, we know the power of Satan works through unbelief. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Works through unbelief. God's power works through faith. So as long as man believed in God's word, the power of God operated through him. He was the channel for God, Amen, to work his authority, to work his character, to work every in in man as long as he believed. &gt;&gt; But Satan, of course, was able to speak through the serpent &gt;&gt; and and and convince Eve to surrender herself to him. The prophet says anytime a woman takes a wrong step, she first has to receive it in her mind. Some slicker has to persuade her and she listens to it against her own better judgment. Then the act is committed. See, Satan hit Eve's mind. &gt;&gt; In the womb of her mind, she doubted God's word. Then come the actual act. So the act that that ain't that that's just something we see. But something been going on a long time. See, we we think, "Oh, it's sudden. Look at them. Look the way they're acting. That's sudden." No. Satan been working there all the time, and they've been entertaining things. &gt;&gt; See? And then the action comes forth. See? So, so now, Satan couldn't use man a as a channel. Uh uh he couldn't get to man, right? &gt;&gt; It wasn't that was the woman that was deceived. &gt;&gt; And and so he couldn't get through man as the channel. So we walk through woman and and and she brought forth a child of death of Satan. See, and and so uh uh we we find that later on God was able to bring forth his son through a woman. See, but but I say this, we were supposed to come the way Christ came. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You believe that &gt;&gt; Adam had the book. He had the rights to life. &gt;&gt; And every name that was written in the book &gt;&gt; should have came forth by the spoken word of Adam. &gt;&gt; Let there be. Remember the prophet said Mary said, "A man, done what Eve should have done. Be it unto me according to thy word." But before Adam got to her, Satan got to her and she accepted the wrong seed. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So we didn't come forth as sons of God. &gt;&gt; We came as sons of Adam. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Not word seed, sex seed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet said, see now this is how this is how God was able to work bring his son into a womb. The physical mind of Mary was virgin womb. Why? She believed God's word. That's right. &gt;&gt; No matter how much anybody criticized how many things somebody else said, that didn't have one thing to do with it. &gt;&gt; She believed God's word regardless. &gt;&gt; First was her mind. Before the act ever taken place in her literal womb, the act had to take place in here, first to let the the spirit come in to do the rest of the work. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh my glory." Before the actual spiritual birth can take place, the word has to find itself through your mind. Believe it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; The word is strong. It's powerful. &gt;&gt; But it's got to be received by believing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and shall never come to judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so that's how God was able to bring forth his son in the womb of a virgin is she just believed the word. She closed out every other thought, every other skeptic criticism, everything that Satan was trying to tell her that can't happen. You're going to be a fanatic. You're going to be laughed at. This has never been done. She closed all of that out and just said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." &gt;&gt; Eve should have done the same thing. &gt;&gt; But she stopped to listen &gt;&gt; to what the serpent or Satan had to say. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When Eve fell, she received the wrong seed and she fell. Her countenance changed for death was upon her. &gt;&gt; Satan's deforming power was already working on her. Now, this put Adam in a tight spot. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when she came to him, this wasn't just a woman coming. This was flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone. &gt;&gt; This is a woman that came from him. He loved her. &gt;&gt; So when she came to him to to get him to partake of the what she parttook of that put Adam in a tight spot. Now he had to make the choice &gt;&gt; to to hold on to the book, &gt;&gt; keep the book &gt;&gt; or to walk away from the book and go with his wife. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; To forfeit. So, so because Adam loved his wife who was a part of him, he chose to walk away from his inheritance and and and all of these things. and and the moment he walked out, he fell and he had no power to redeem. &gt;&gt; Now, prophet said Adam, Satan caused Adam to fall by that one word. And when he failed, see now Adam forfeited the book. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He forfeited the book. That word forfeit means something that is lost or given up on account of an offense, error or failure to fulfill an agreement. &gt;&gt; So, Adam failed. Amen. He forfeited it. Amen. And and because of an offense or an heir, see, and the prophet said, see, it was forfeited. Then it couldn't go back into the dirty hands of Satan who tempted her out of the way. So therefore, it went back to its original owner, which is God. Like any abstract deed would do, goes back right back to its original owner. And that was God the creator who made it. And he holds it. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, we find that he holds it because in Revelations 5:1 that it went back to him. John saw God sitting on the throne holding something in his hand. And he says, "And I saw in the right of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and with and on the backside." See, sealed with seven seals. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's the book &gt;&gt; that Adam forfeited. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, so so what did he lose when he forfeited the book? He lost his rights of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said the right his rights of the word, the promises, their inheritance, &gt;&gt; all in the book. &gt;&gt; And when he walked away, he forfeited his rights &gt;&gt; to the word. &gt;&gt; He forfeited the promises. &gt;&gt; He forfeited his inheritance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "You remember how it was lost by Adam? He forfeited the book of life for the knowledge of Satan and lost his inheritance. He lost everything and no way for redemption. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Another place when man lost his life. Capital L, he also lost his inheritance in life &gt;&gt; because he had complete supreme uh control of the earth. He was a god of the earth. &gt;&gt; God's the God of the universe everywhere. But his son had his earth under his control. &gt;&gt; He could speak. He could name. He could say, &gt;&gt; he could stop nature. &gt;&gt; He could do anything he wanted to. &gt;&gt; When he did that, he lost his inheritance. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, now Adam could say, see, let let this mountain be moved over there, and it would do it. Adam could say, "Let this tree be uh here, be plucked up and planted over here." it would do it. For he had complete supreme control as a minor god under God our father because he was a son of God. &gt;&gt; But when Adam forfeited the book, now Satan had power. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; He took control. &gt;&gt; He took over man. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. We find that all the kingdoms of the earth from from that time all the way to now is under Satan's domain. &gt;&gt; They're dominated. Every nation is dominated by Satan. He's the ruler of the earth. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Prophet said bloodshed, war, famine, sickness, and disease, germs, and sin comes from the devil. &gt;&gt; Every nation has a national spirit which are devils. Those spirits get jealous of another spirit. And what do they do? They cause war. &gt;&gt; This ain't just Russian against United States. They're devils. &gt;&gt; Spirits that are pitting men against one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's true. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's a prophet looking in the spiritual realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. in that supernatural world and seeing demons at work because demons are getting jealous of one another. &gt;&gt; And and so we see today that men and women and even children are under Satan's power. Look at the broken homes. Look at the broken marriages, broken families, and and all kinds of things. So, Brother Bram said, "Adam lost his inheritance, the earth. Now it passed from his hand to the one he sold it out to Satan. He sowed his faith in God to Satan's reasonings. Therefore, his eternal life, his right to the tree of life, his right to the earth belonged to him and he forfeited every bit to the hands of Satan. He passed it from the his hand to Satan. See, and and he says it it in return and it it returned and and has been polluted and the seed of Adam has destroyed the inheritance that God that Adam should have had. And that's the earth. Ain't that right? And we see that Satan's forces are still here, his demonic powers and and and and all of these things. The prophet said, "That's why the earth is now so filthy. That's why the scum and ridiculous things that go on, bloodshed, war, politics, sin, adultery, all kinds of filthiness goes on is because that Satan is the ruler of this earth and this atmosphere. &gt;&gt; As I've said, you know that uh quoting a prophet, the lid of hell has come off. &gt;&gt; Amen. And streams of demon power is pouring from everywhere. It's conquered the nations. It's conquered politics till it's rotten to the core. It's conquered the churches until they know nothing about denomination. Another place the prophet said, "Great dismal fogs of unbelief are floating in from every side." &gt;&gt; There's more sickness. &gt;&gt; More insanity, &gt;&gt; more diseases, more trouble than ever before &gt;&gt; because there is more unbelief than ever before. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; More adultery is being committed than ever before. More homosexualities than ex homosexuals than ever before. Look at Look at the ministers, these bigname ministers in the in the secular church nom nominal that are falling left and right &gt;&gt; this past year &gt;&gt; of of adultery. one pastor who wasn't who isn't in the message. He asked another pastor, a friend of his that ain't in the message as well, but he he asked him said, "Why why are all these these ministers falling in adultery?" And his friend, one word, he said, "Tlevision." &gt;&gt; That's what it is, television. I thought, man, if if if a a man from the secular world, &gt;&gt; church nominal can pinpoint that out, &gt;&gt; why can't message folks &gt;&gt; pinpoint that out? &gt;&gt; But people have become slaves to the modern inventions, technology, right? &gt;&gt; And they've come under an influence that has taken them away from the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm not saying that everything is bad. We all know the these things come from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; So it has its good and it has its evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I I will say I have never seen a time &gt;&gt; when men and women are just playing around with God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh like like it's no big deal. Claiming to be Christians. That's right. &gt;&gt; Irreverent in the house of God. irreverent towards the things of God and they they'll steal even from from the house of God. They shoot up places that supposed to be for God and and all of these things and it it's it's and it's getting worse. It's because gross darkness is upon them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? We see that this lay out a sea and age, it goes into chaos. And so it it's because that when man fell, all creation under him fell. All nature fell because it was under him. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; When Adam fell to death, creation fell with him. &gt;&gt; And so what we are is a fallen race of people. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; By our natural birth, we're just a fallen race of people. &gt;&gt; No different from the next guy. &gt;&gt; No different from whatever. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; This tells us that when God positionally places something, a thing, a person, it's for a purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. example, you know, he positioned the stars in place. He positioned the sun and moon in their place. Everything in the sky that God put out there in the beginning was positionally placed for a reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet talked, you know, like the little dipper and the big dipper. He said, you know, each one of those stars that make up these things look to only be like 2 in apart and yet they're million millions of light years apart. And he called them the heavenly host, God's great army. &gt;&gt; You know, it talks of like this zodiac that that's made up of of of stars. And it begins with the the virgin coming over through the cancer age on down until the last uh was the lion, Leo, the lion, speaking of the first coming of Christ by the virgin, the second coming by the the lion of the tribe of Judah. And and he says, "Not one of them is out of place. one keeps its time perfectly. &gt;&gt; It says, "I thought of the soldiers uh how that if that moon would happen to get out of order, the earth would be covered again with water in just a few minutes." See, the earth would just be like it was when God decided to use it for to have us here on the earth. It was without form, void, and darkness, and water was upon the breath of the earth. If that moon would ever move, it would do the same thing again. &gt;&gt; When the moon rocks a little bit away from the earth, the tides come up. When it goes down, it just follows the the tide follows it. See, it's God's great army. &gt;&gt; And he positioned man on the earth. &gt;&gt; He put man in a position as head of of the earth. And when man got out of his position, it brought chaos to the human race. &gt;&gt; It brought chaos to the earth. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; The only thing that didn't fall was God. The prophet said, right? &gt;&gt; The only thing that didn't fall, God kept his position. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Which means it did not throw his purpose into chaos. It didn't throw his predestinated will into chaos. &gt;&gt; It remains intact. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Satan has no control over that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; And unlike Adam, God had the power to come to us and redeem us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; And according to the law of redemption, before God could redeem us, he had to be one of us. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; If you look at Revelations 5 and one, I'm going to read a little bit and I won't keep you long, but it says, "And I saw in the right of hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof. No man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look there upon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look upon. One of the tribe of elders sth unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns, seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him. Now, that's so important. He come and took the book &gt;&gt; out of the right hand of him that sat up on the throne. And when the when he had taken the book only after he had taken the book, &gt;&gt; Amen. the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors and and which are the prayers of the saints. And they sung a new song. &gt;&gt; When after he took the book, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; After he had loosened &gt;&gt; and they and they sung a new song, saying, "Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, tongue, people, and nation, and has made us under our God, kings and priests, and we shall reign. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? There was a man able to take the book. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It wasn't just a spirit. It was a man, &gt;&gt; a kinsman. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And he took the book. &gt;&gt; And when he opened the book, it put us back in our position. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We shall reign on the earth. &gt;&gt; You know, they say that the average adult has five lers of blood in them, which would be 1.3 gallons. Now, this earth is blood soaked with human blood &gt;&gt; because of war, accidents, murder, etc. All throughout the history of mankind, from the time of Abel all the way to today, blood has been spilled. Human blood has been spilled on the ground. Now, they say that each year an estimated 6.8 million people in the US donate blood. Why do they donate blood? to give life to their fellow man. &gt;&gt; And we're glad for that, right? &gt;&gt; 13.6 million units of whole blood and red red blood cells are collected in the US in a year. Every two seconds someone is in need of blood or platelets. Approximately 29,000 units of red blood cells are needed daily in the US. &gt;&gt; Church, blood matters, don't it? It &gt;&gt; does. &gt;&gt; Man needs blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And without the blood, he can't live. &gt;&gt; And even amongst our fellow men, we need people to give us blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; Share your blood so we can live. &gt;&gt; And yet, no matter how much blood is shed on the ground, no m human blood is donated to help others, no ounce of human blood has redeeming power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's not one spot of Jewish blood in Jesus. Right? &gt;&gt; And there wasn't a spot of Gentile blood in Jesus. &gt;&gt; For he was neither gentile or Jew. A lot of people say he was a Jew. The prophet said he wasn't. He couldn't have been a Jew if he was virgin born. &gt;&gt; For the blood comes from the male. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, so God created a blood cell &gt;&gt; in the womb of Mary which developed into the son of God. He would create a blood cell of his own that he could bring forth a kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Couldn't be from a sex birth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Had to be created. So the birth of Christ was a created birth. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the blood that was in him was a created blood. &gt;&gt; So this is why the Bible says God purchased us with his own blood. &gt;&gt; God came up with his own blood. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he's a creator? &gt;&gt; Amen. He He could create his own blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the only way you could be redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the only way we could come forth back into our position &gt;&gt; is God had to do it himself. &gt;&gt; God showing that he never left his position. Not one time. He had the power when there was no other blood that man could have to redeem. He says, "I'll create it." &gt;&gt; And he found a virgin that would just take him at his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says he sanctified the people with his own blood. &gt;&gt; By his own blood, he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. Revelations 15, unto him that loved us and washed us or loosed us from our sins in his own blood. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I don't know how much of his blood was shed that day at Calvary. But I do know this, just one drop of his blood was powerful enough to redeem us. Prophet said one drop of the blood of Jesus Christ can lift every sinner there is out of the miry clay. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; One drop can take a prostitute off the street and make a saint of God out of her. &gt;&gt; It can take a drunkard out of the gutter and make him a preacher of the gospel. One drop can set every hospital patient free from sickness. It can close every jail and penitentiary. One drop can deliver every insane institution of its diseased and afflicted afflicted people. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It had enough power to resurrect the Old Testament saints. &gt;&gt; Take them out of paradise and take him take them uh with him. It has enough power. One drop has enough power to sign our pardon. It has enough power not only to redeem our soul and this whole body, but it has enough power to redeem the earth. &gt;&gt; It had enough power to divorce you from your sins. For as the psalmist says in 103:12, "As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. And I say unto you, every name that is written in the book shall be delivered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Someone asked Brother Brandham a question. Do Christians sin? He said, absolutely no. There is no scripture where a Christian sins. He cannot sin. &gt;&gt; I know there's a resentment to that. Well, we'll just go to he says 1 John 3 and see what the scripture says. But he says, "A Christian does not sin." He said, "Did you ever see a black white bird or a white black bird? Did you ever see a drunk sober man? Did you ever see a sinner saint?" He said, "You never did see one of those. There's no such a thing." Can you say, "Amen." And Jesus would tell us, "He that the son is set free is free indeed." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? The world needs to know the power of the blood. &gt;&gt; And I believe it's it's it is essential for us to know and understand that we belong to the Lord. This is what Paul would tell us there in 1 Corinthians 6:19. What know ye that not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you? Which you have of God? You're not of you're not your own. For you are bought with the price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are God's. In other words, he's brought us back to where we can be a channel, a dedicated channel for his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, in God's sight, we are greater than his blood &gt;&gt; because we are the purchased of the blood. And God gives every believer the seal of circumcision. which is the Holy Ghost as a sign that he has recognized them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Having the Holy Ghost is not a myth. It's it's not just something that anyone can say they have. I mean, millions of people now that are claiming they've got it and they really ain't got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when God gives you the Holy Ghost, that is a genuine seal that God has recognized you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has brought you to a place that you can be a channel for him to use. &gt;&gt; Everybody else is being more leosya lukewarm and indifferent to the gospel. But this bride is staying true to the gospel. She's separated from it all and dedicated channel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, when God gives a man the Holy Ghost, God then takes possession. And remember the prophet said before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwelling in the human heart it first must be repented. &gt;&gt; And and repent means to turn from &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about failures and mistakes. I'm talking about real repentance. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you come to the place you're not playing with God. &gt;&gt; You're not playing church. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Then it must be baptized in his name to show who it belongs to. Then it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus. Then the holy fire and Holy Ghost from God comes down and burns out all the desire of sin." &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; It burns out all the desire of sin. All the nature of the world. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet says, "Therefore, he that sins willfully after having received the knowledge of truth." He said, "Then the Bible again says it's impossible." It's impossible for a man filled with the Holy Ghost to go. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just telling you what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; See, amen. A man that's born of God cannot sin. He does not sin. Hello, church. &gt;&gt; And and I'll say this for you people that are really trying to serve God. It's not sin. When you make a mistake, &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says, "Because the first time you realize that you're wrong, you repent of it. You don't have to tell somebody or wait till somebody brings it out and said, "You've done this, you've done that. Oh, oh, I I I'm sorry, folks. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry." Amen. You're just only repenting because you you got caught. &gt;&gt; There should be something inside every Christian. Amen. that the moment you you realize that you done it, there's something that convicts you to say, "I was wrong." &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "You'll say that all your life, you'll make mistakes. It ain't sin yet." &gt;&gt; Because he said, "The moment you realize that you done it, you'll repent of it." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, it's impossible, Amen, for a man that's born of God to sin. He does not sin. There's no way for him to sin. How can he be a sinner and redeemed at the same time? So God did not save you, fill you with the Holy Ghost to keep you going back and forth pawn pawn shop, out of the pawn shop, in the pawn shop, out of the P. Get away from that mental mental belief. &gt;&gt; There ain't no way you can be in the pawn shop, out of the pawn shop, in the pawn shop, out of the pawn shop. You have been set free indeed. Brother Brown said, "If it's perfect blood that's loosed you, then it's a perfect loosening." &gt;&gt; So if you still got desires and you still playing around with God, being irreverent in the house of God, you need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's just plain and simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just get the Holy Ghost. Quit playing around with God, man. So it says, "How can he be a sinner and redeemed at the same time?" How can I be in the pawn shop and out of the pawn shop at the same time? He redeemed us by his blood by his spirit. He cleansed us. Then he comes and dwells in us, &gt;&gt; the church. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, so what is it? It's the quickening power. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; You believe that's what the Holy Ghost is? Prophet said when the Holy Ghost came on the days of in the day of Pentecost, it so quickened them. It quickened their tongue to where they spoke in new tongues. It quickened their bodies. Amen. It quickened everything about them. And when that happens to you, you know, &gt;&gt; you're free. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says his spirit bears record or witness with our spirit &gt;&gt; that we are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So our new lineage now doesn't start with Adam. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Because that lineage is dead. &gt;&gt; That that that is that we you know I'm a son of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The word seed has been quickened and that holy image that Adam and Eve lost is restored. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; It's restored. It's something that happens and is continually happening. &gt;&gt; Why? Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed. Everybody say conformed to the image of his son. Why did God save you? To be conformed to the image of his son to restore that holy image back unto you. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; You're not a sinner. You're a saint. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope that makes sense to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it's, you know, Paul said, we're being changed from glory unto glory. Glory unto glory. &gt;&gt; It's like a seed. The prophet said, you plant that seed in the ground. It's there. It is the original seed. It falls into the ground. It comes up like the the corn of wheat. It comes up and and and like a like a sprout blade. Then it then it's changed from that and goes on into the tassel. And then from there, it's changed from that. It goes into the the the shuck and then from there it's changed and goes back to its original grain. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Well, that's the way the process God uses that. Brother Brandon used that. Amen. To show us the true church, the true church is the original seed of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; So notice he says the bride will have to be the word. Word added to word. Add to word. See Luther's justification. Wesley sanctification, Pentecostals, baptism of the Holy Ghost, changing, changing, changing, restoration of the gifts, and all the rest of it goes with it. See, it's got to be word on top of word, germ on top of germ, life on top of life to bring out the full stature of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. In other place he says the same Jesus in the bride form, same power, same church, same thing, same word, the same word sucked up through these a uh and come out here and come to a a head here. And all that life come through here picked up its people. That life picked up the elect out of Luther's age. That life picked up the a the people the the elect out of Wesley's and out of the Pentecostal age. Now it's forming up into a head for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Another place he said the same the sun that rose in the east. It's the same son that's manifesting the thing in the west changing from glory unto glory &gt;&gt; unto glory. It's changing church. This church has been changing through the ages from one glory to another glory to another glory. It ain't saying that they ain't part of us. They had that glory, but now it's changed into another glory. Can you say amen? We're glad for what God done in that Pentecostal age, but that's not where we're at. We've changed into another glory and and we're getting closer and closer, and you as individuals are changing. If you've got the Holy Ghost, that seed has been quickened down inside of you. You cannot remain the same. It's changing from glory unto glory. And how is the change coming? If the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you, &gt;&gt; that same spirit that raised him from the dead, &gt;&gt; if it dwells in you, shall also quicken your mortal body. &gt;&gt; It's a quickening power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope this is all right. &gt;&gt; Romans 10 or Revelations 10:1. And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head. &gt;&gt; And his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. And we know this is Christ. &gt;&gt; He had in his hand a little open book. And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth. And he cried with loud voice as when a lion roarth. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. Now notice what a prophet said. Where are we at? We see nations breaking, Israel awakening, the signs that this Bible foretold for this day. We see the mechanical things taking place now. The spirit, the dynamics that promised word of that promised word is getting into his church and drive them to Calvary yonder into the rapture. And there we are. &gt;&gt; The dynamics, the quickening power &gt;&gt; descending and coming into the church, &gt;&gt; quickening the promises to us. &gt;&gt; And as many as received him, to them gave he power &gt;&gt; to become sons of God. &gt;&gt; You see, you can you can sit here and listen day in and day out. You can go home. You can listen to the tapes. But the prophet said, "If the spirit has never quickened you till you could follow the word of God, that you women and you men could obey every word that he's written." That's a dangerous thing. What if you would be a dead seed and no life in you? He says, "But if there's something in you that tells you, I want to rise this morning. I want to rise from the state that I'm in. I don't want to be just a dead seed, be left to dirt and driftwood. I want to rise. &gt;&gt; The only way you could want that and desire that is there's something down inside you calling. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So he comes down to reveal the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. Seventh verse. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants, the prophets. And as we know, and this is important, the seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "The lamb took the book. Glory. opened the book, tore off the seals, and sent it down to the earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come, &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, what is this all about? Well, the lamb didn't come to die. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He already did it. &gt;&gt; But notice what Paul said in Romans 8:17. If we are children, then we're hes of God and joint hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified together. &gt;&gt; So the prophet says that Jesus came in four sons name, the name of four sons. He come as son of David which makes him heir to the throne. He come as son of Abraham which made him heir to the royal grant. He came as the son of of of man which made him heir of all things in heaven and earth. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See so now notice as the heir he's he's become possessor. He's heir. He paid the price and now he came and took the book of inheritance. &gt;&gt; He come and took the book of promises. Right? &gt;&gt; The prophet says the lamb comes. He breaks the seals and reveals gives us his inheritance to his people. He gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us. It all belong to him. He's the one who redeemed. But instead of keeping it himself, he gives it back to the people. That's his love for us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. So when you're listening to the message and you're seeing these promises and you're looking at it and maybe you don't even understand the word of what he's trying to say and all these things, just say, "I'm an heir to it. I'm an heir to it. This is the lamb. This is the lamb giving it back. Giving it back to me." That's my promise. That's my promise. That's my promise. Can you say amen? Amen. Everything it belongs to me. We are heirs of healing. We are heirs of deliverance. We are heirs of of heaven. We are heirs of the new city. We are heirs to the throne. &gt;&gt; We are heirs to immortality. Heirs to eternal life. We are heirs of righteousness. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And notice what a prophet. It's the Holy Spirit today. That's why he's come. It's the Holy Spirit today hunting out hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message. Everything in the Bible that was promised is to that believer. And when you accept it in its fullness and God knows that you'll do it, he gives you the abstract to that. And then every promise that's made is in your possession. It's in your possession. Church, remember, you got to go take the book. That's the commission. Go get the book from the angel and eat it up. Why? It's yours. You don't have to walk away from it and forfeit it. Adam done that, but not today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This book is ours. Say what you will. Will will &gt;&gt; speak to the mountain. And we've seen a redeemed man of God in this age. a redeemed body that became a channel that God could work through and speak and create squirrels. Create a spoken word and it created squirrels. Can you say amen? The dead came to life. Amen. He even stopped the storm. But it wasn't just for brother Brandham. It was for every one of us. He was just showing what we have been redeemed back to. Our position. Remember church, it wasn't until the book became open that now it becomes in this age time for adoption, the manifestation of sons of God. That's where we're at. We couldn't do it without the book being open. Glad for what they done in the book of Acts. Glad for all the things that they done in the book of Acts. But that wasn't adoption. I have to tell you, it wasn't adoption. It was the original seed that went in the ground. I I get that it was the the pure seed of God. And look what they done as the seed. But that seed went in the ground. It died. It rotted. And it began to spring forth. Now we're back. This is the son of man age. This is the adoption age. This is the sons of God coming to their position. Not as sons of Adam up from the sex seed, but the seed a word seed. Every name written in this book is coming to manifestation. Bride manifestation. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Read one more. He said, "The works that I do shall you do also. These signs shall follow them that believe." That is the assurance. When we see a group of people sitting together and those signs manifesting themselves, that's the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that that's property of God. So we are Easter also. We're we are now in our Easter. We've already raised, hallelujah, from the things of the world to the things of God's promise. Not we will, we are. It's the potentials. It's God's promise. He had poured out his spirit in the last days. And that's what they would do. Notice, laid their hands on the sick, everything that was in God's promise, I shall pour out my spirit in the last days upon all flesh. Your old men shall dream dreams. Your young men shall see visions. All these different promises that he made, everything is laying right there in God's promise. Jesus redeemed it to us. He said, "If we are ordained on that ground, if we are ordained to be on that ground, like the eagle walking in the chicken's nest, if you're ordained on that ground, the Holy Spirit is here to find you. And when it finds you, you recognize its call. You know the hour you're living, you know that these things are supposed to happen. Quickly, you're raptured up to meet it. And now you're sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." Oh, what a promise. What a heavenly father who would give us these things. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh my. He says, notice I just skipped through. He says God's life which is in the Greek called Zoey moving through them and in them quicken their minds to his word. He said, let me say it real quietly now. The spirit of God that moves among the people quickens the mind of the person to the promise of God. It does it. as I'm trying to show you, let you realize that I'm speaking to the church now and also quickened to life in him. Although they was only attributes to begin with, but if God said in this day, back in the beginning, John Doe will be my servant millions of years ago. John Doe now is born in sin, shaping iniquity, come to the world speaking lies because he's immortal. Maybe he gets a little religious feeling. He'll join a church, maybe join Pentecostal, don't know. He might join anything. But let him get under the atmosphere of God once. John Doe is bound to recognize who his father is. Just as that eagle recognized who the mother was, it's got to realize it. Only that John Doe is God's attribute that's become a word spoken. Then the Holy Spirit seeks that word out. Here it is. He calls him, give him everlasting life and brings him into the presence of God, God's word. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He said, "See, when the spirit of God comes upon you and you truly are one of God's attributes that he's spoken of, now if you're not, you'll wonder and flusterate, run here and there and everything else and never come to the knowledge of the truth. But if you are one of those, the old things pass away right quick. You become new. The plan of salvation is finished. You're ready to obey every word that God ever spoke of you for you to do. You're submissive to his word. The contract exactly the abstract to the contract. The title deed belongs to you. The debts are all paid. It's struck off just as it was at the day of Pentecost. Can you say amen? Aren't you glad for him? Aren't you glad you're one of them? Bless the name of the Lord. What song? Rise. Rise above it all. I'm going to rise. Oh, rise.

And um certainly appreciate uh her and she's just been a blessing to me and to the church. Amen. And just really glad to see what the Lord has done &gt;&gt; for you. And uh always look just glad to just see that glow on your face, that smile. Amen. And uh it means a lot to us. &gt;&gt; And uh we just pray that you just have a blessed day. Have your son to take you out for a big steak. Okay. A little one or something. But we sure love uh Sister Becky and God bless you all. Amen. And um let's just sing this in dismissing. It won't be long. It won't be long till we see Jes.
