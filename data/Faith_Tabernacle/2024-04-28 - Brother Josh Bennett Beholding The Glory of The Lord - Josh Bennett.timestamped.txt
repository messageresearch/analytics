[43:29] knowest and you begin to tell the

[43:36] had a power in
[43:38] it Lord that it begin to bring bone to
[43:41] bone and and and flesh begin to come on
[43:44] the bone and send you on the
[43:47] flesh Lord as he begin to prophesy and
[43:50] speak the Breath of God be today and

[43:56] word even the scripture says you sent
[43:58] your word and healed the people so Lord

[45:45] thank God for what he's done amen 2
[45:47] Corinthians the third chapter and I'd
[45:49] like to start at the second
[45:53] verse you are written you you are our
[45:57] our Epistles written in our hearts known
[46:00] and read of all men for as much as you
[46:03] are manifestly declared to be the
[46:06] Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[46:09] Written not with ink but with the spirit
[46:12] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[46:16] to godward not that we are sufficient
[46:19] ourselves to think anything of our as of
[46:22] ourselves but our sufficiency is of God
[46:27] who also hath made us able Ministers of
[46:29] the New Testament not of the letter but
[46:32] of the spirit for the letter kth but the
[46:35] spirit giveth life so that the children
[46:37] of Israel could not steadfastly behold
[46:40] the face of Moses for the glory of his
[46:43] countenance which Glory was to be done
[46:45] away how shall not the ministration of
[46:49] the spirit be rather glorious for the
[46:51] ministration of condemnation be glory
[46:55] much more do the ministration of
[46:57] righteousness exceed in glory for even
[47:00] that which was made glorious had no
[47:02] glory in this Respect by reason of the
[47:05] glory that
[47:06] excelth and not as Moses which put a
[47:09] veil over his face that the children of
[47:11] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[47:13] end of that which is abolished but their
[47:16] minds were blinded For unto this day
[47:20] remaineth the same Veil untaken away in
[47:22] the reading of the Old Testament which
[47:25] Veil is done away in Christ
[47:27] but even unto this day when Moses is
[47:29] read the veil is upon their heart so
[47:32] notice here the veil is upon their heart
[47:35] so their hearts are veiled but their
[47:36] minds are
[47:38] blinded nevertheless when it shall turn
[47:42] to the Lord when the heart shall turn to
[47:44] the Lord's seea the veil shall be taken
[47:47] away now the Lord is that Spirit face
[47:51] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[47:54] Lord are changed into the same image
[47:56] image from glory to glory even as by the
[48:01] spirit of the Lord amen may God At His
[48:04] blessings as you're seated this
[48:07] morning I'd like to
[48:12] um just speak to you for a
[48:16] um I'd say a few minutes but I I I I
[48:19] better be
[48:21] careful I'm going to speak for a little
[48:24] while Amen on beholding the glory
[48:27] of the Lord and you know as we look at
[48:31] this i' just like to um start by reading
[48:34] a quote out of the unveiling of God
[48:37] brother Brown said since Pentecost since
[48:39] the crucifixion when that veil was rent
[48:42] from the top to the bottom for that
[48:43] generation Jesus was that God veiled and
[48:47] when he died at Calvary God sent a fire
[48:49] and lightning and and ripped the veil
[48:51] from the top to the bottom that the
[48:53] whole Mercy Seat was in plain view but
[48:56] see they were too blind to see it and
[48:58] Paul said in the reading of Moses when
[49:00] Moses is read yet that Veil is still on
[49:03] their heart oh brother sister that's
[49:05] what the Jews did when the veil was rent
[49:08] that brought God into Plain View hanging
[49:10] on the cross he was in plain view but
[49:12] they couldn't see it amen uh could it be
[49:15] possible he said that the Gentiles has
[49:17] done the same thing he said oh God he
[49:20] said when they have had their Church
[49:22] ages and the and they've and the of the
[49:24] Son of God but now the veil of this
[49:27] denomination and things the veil of
[49:30] tradition since we've had since
[49:32] Pentecost when the church Traditions has
[49:34] now been rent amen and the things that
[49:37] the people said but the people say the
[49:39] days of Miracle is passed and all these
[49:41] things and God has took the veil off of
[49:44] it and brought it into Plain View but
[49:47] see they're ready to crucify it again
[49:50] just exactly see the unveiled God in
[49:52] plain view they should have seen him
[49:54] standing there yet he was too common he
[49:57] was just an ordinary man they see that
[50:00] there was their God hanging on Calvary
[50:03] but they were too blind to see it it
[50:05] brought him into open View and they
[50:07] still don't see it see they're blinded
[50:10] amen but God was veiled in a human being
[50:13] amen you see why couldn't they see it
[50:15] because Paul said there they had a veil
[50:18] upon their heart amen and their minds
[50:20] were blinded to it now brother B would
[50:23] say again in the unveiling of God he
[50:25] said see it's a spiritual Veil that's
[50:27] over the people and they begin to say
[50:30] well I'm Methodist I'm just as good as
[50:32] anybody or I'm Baptist or I'm
[50:34] Pentecostal don't you realize that that
[50:37] thing is a traditional Veil and it's
[50:40] hiding God from you see that's the thing
[50:43] that keeps you from enjoying amen all
[50:47] see and brother B said there's now I
[50:48] just say this morning there's a lot of
[50:50] things there's many things that keeps
[50:52] people from seeing God Amen there's many
[50:55] veils there you know and there's things
[50:57] that that that that block off the view
[51:01] or a vision of people you know the world
[51:03] will come in and and they'll be veiled
[51:05] with worldism or amen and and there's
[51:07] all these things that that that block
[51:09] off amen and keep the people from seeing
[51:12] God Amen brother BR say if you bring it
[51:15] over now into the religious Realms he
[51:17] said the thing that is hiding God from
[51:19] the people is a traditional Veil amen
[51:23] it's their Traditions that's keeping
[51:24] them from seeing God now they they come
[51:28] to Jesus in Mark chapter 7 there Amen in
[51:31] in the fifth verse and the Pharisees and
[51:33] the scribes asked him said why walk not
[51:36] thy disciples according to the tradition
[51:38] of the elders amen but they eat bread
[51:40] with unwashed hand and he answered and
[51:42] said unto them well has Isaiah
[51:44] prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is
[51:47] written this people honth me with their
[51:49] lips but their heart is far from me amen
[51:53] now they come to Jesus and and and and I
[51:56] think I think this is amazing because
[51:57] when they come and they begin to
[51:59] criticize the disciples they didn't
[52:01] criticize them for breaking the word
[52:05] they criticized them for his tradition
[52:07] amen but they wasn't being critical
[52:09] toward them because they had broke a
[52:11] commandment of God because they hadn't
[52:13] broke no commandment because there was
[52:15] no Commandment that said they couldn't
[52:16] eat with unwashed hands amen but it was
[52:19] the tradition of the elders amen that
[52:22] that that they were breaking see amen
[52:25] and and and they come and said why don't
[52:27] your disciples keep their Traditions
[52:29] amen but Jesus just looked at them and
[52:31] said you're a bunch of
[52:33] Hypocrites amen because see you won't
[52:36] eat bread with unwashed hands but look
[52:38] at all the other things that
[52:40] Commandments of God that you're breaking
[52:42] I think this is amazing cuz when I
[52:44] started studying it I begin to find out
[52:46] that they said that in that day those
[52:48] Jews held so close to the tra traditions
[52:52] of the elders that they actually
[52:53] believed amen that that it was a a a a
[52:57] greater offense towards God to break a
[53:00] tradition than to break a commandment
[53:03] and they begin to say things like this
[53:05] we would be better off to be without
[53:07] even the law than to be without the
[53:10] words of our rabbis listen friends that
[53:13] that old that Spirit come right over
[53:15] into
[53:18] Catholicism and they begin to say oh
[53:20] we'd be better off to be without a Bible
[53:24] than to be without a pope we'd be better
[53:26] off to be without the word of God A and
[53:30] H and have our priest amen but I tell
[53:33] you what amen there's a a little man or
[53:35] a little boy One Day by the name of
[53:37] William tendale and he was in a school
[53:39] and and and there was a a young man in
[53:41] that school he begin to say listen we'd
[53:44] be better off without the words of God
[53:45] because they were talking about how that
[53:47] you know uh uhh we would like to
[53:48] translate the Bible into the common
[53:51] language amen and and you know the
[53:53] Catholic church was against that because
[53:55] they didn't want the people to see the
[53:57] word amen they did they they wanted amen
[54:01] the people to be depending upon them so
[54:04] that they could tell you what it means
[54:06] and how to apply
[54:10] it amen amen but that that young man
[54:12] said we'd be better off without the word
[54:15] that of God than to be without the word
[54:16] of the Pope but we in tendel there was
[54:19] something down on the inside of him amen
[54:21] he stood up amen and he pounded his desk
[54:25] and he said if God will give give me the
[54:26] strength I'll make it that one day the
[54:28] boy that walks behind the plow amen will
[54:31] know more about the word of God than the
[54:34] pope himself hallelujah amen listen
[54:37] friends amen and God anointed Amen in
[54:40] that time amen men like tendale amen and
[54:44] John rockliff and and Martin Luther amen
[54:47] and they begin to take the word of God
[54:49] and translate into a Common
[54:53] Language amen because God wanted his
[54:56] word have an
[54:57] [Music]
[54:59] effect Jesus looked at him and said amen
[55:02] you're a bunch of
[55:05] Hypocrites listen friends what what was
[55:07] he call the whole idea behind a
[55:09] hypocrite is somebody that is an
[55:12] actor they're they're they're pretending
[55:15] to be something they're not see and
[55:17] that's what Jesus called them a bunch of
[55:19] Hypocrites amen he said because you
[55:21] honor me with my with your lips but your
[55:24] heart is far from me
[55:26] amen could I just bring it down let's
[55:28] bring it down in modern terms you come
[55:31] to church but your heart is far from me
[55:34] you sing songs but your heart is far
[55:36] from me oh you pray eloquent prayers but
[55:39] your heart is far from me you give ties
[55:42] and offerings but your heart is far from
[55:44] me come on church and listen I'm just
[55:47] going to tell you amen this morning amen
[55:50] I'm not preaching about the church the
[55:51] Baptist Church or or the Methodist
[55:54] Church or the Pentecostal Church amen
[55:56] they got their Traditions but if we
[55:59] ain't careful amen we going to have a
[56:01] bunch of messy
[56:03] Traditions amen thing and a tradition is
[56:06] just something that's passed down from
[56:08] generation to generation amen and we're
[56:10] going to have a bunch of young people
[56:12] amen that that are that are uh you know
[56:15] saying things and amen and we got girls
[56:18] that letting their hair grow and amen
[56:20] whatever more but they don't know why
[56:21] they're doing
[56:22] it amen and after a while amen we're
[56:25] going to have a generation of people
[56:27] Amen in this message amen that have
[56:29] never met the God of this message and
[56:31] we're serving God out of a tradition and
[56:33] not by an
[56:40] experience and the veil of the of
[56:42] tradition will hide God from your
[56:46] view listen Jesus is quoting Isaiah
[56:49] 29 for the Lord had poured out upon you
[56:52] the spirit of deep sleep and had closed
[56:55] your eyes
[56:56] amen the prophets and and and your
[56:59] rulers the seers hath he covered and the
[57:02] vision of all is become un you as the
[57:05] words of a book that is
[57:08] sealed which men deliver to one that has
[57:11] learned saying read this I pray thee and
[57:13] he saith I cannot for is sealed and and
[57:16] the book is delivered to him that is not
[57:18] learned saying read this I pray thee and
[57:20] he saith I'm not learned wherefore the
[57:23] Lord said for as much as this people
[57:25] draw near me with their mouth and with
[57:27] their lips they do honor me but have
[57:30] removed their heart from me amen and and
[57:33] their fear toward me as taught by the
[57:35] precept of
[57:37] men listen to what brother Brown said he
[57:40] said there's so much today friends
[57:41] that's called Christianity that's not
[57:44] Christianity I just hate to say that but
[57:47] I'd rather stand here among the people
[57:49] and amen and just Pat everybody on the
[57:52] back and everything like that but you
[57:53] got when you got to meet that group at
[57:55] the judge see and give an account you
[57:58] got to be honest I don't know about the
[58:01] rest of y'all but I'm glad that we had a
[58:03] prophet that was
[58:04] honest I'm glad that our the message
[58:07] that we received didn't come to I'm not
[58:10] trying to call names but I'm just
[58:11] telling you amen this is not a message
[58:13] to come and tell you oh your best life
[58:15] now and amen come on Friends amen but
[58:19] I'm glad that God sent a message amen
[58:21] that had a power in
[58:23] it Hallelujah to change you
[58:26] [Music]
[58:35] he said we look out the congregation the
[58:37] world today what's called Christianity
[58:39] we find out it's a million miles from
[58:41] Christianity and it's predicted in the
[58:43] Bible that it'll be that way but we
[58:45] accept Christ see or we just say well
[58:47] you know I believe him the devil
[58:49] believes the same
[58:51] thing and many of them tries to accept
[58:54] it upon a motion well I spoke in tongues
[58:57] or I dance in the spirit amen he said
[58:59] I've seen doctors amen or devil dancers
[59:02] in Africa speak in tongues and drink
[59:04] blood out of a human skull and calling
[59:06] the devil amen he said my mother was an
[59:08] Indian a half Indian and her people I
[59:10] seen them take a pencil and lay it down
[59:12] like that and watch the pencil running
[59:14] all over and write on unknown tongues
[59:16] amen and then stand there and interpret
[59:18] it calling on the devil sure amen you
[59:20] can't go by
[59:22] emotions amen we believe in emotions but
[59:26] he said you can't go by emotions see
[59:28] your life is what testifies what you are
[59:32] no matter what kind of sensation amen
[59:34] you can't base Christianity on sensation
[59:37] it's a
[59:39] life and Jesus said by their fruits you
[59:41] shall know them not by their profession
[59:45] not by what they
[59:47] say Amen Jesus said you draw n to me
[59:51] with your lips but your heart is far
[59:52] from me see that's their profession but
[59:55] the life is is what tells and if a man
[59:58] says he believes God and denies one word
[1:00:00] of this Bible or changes it in any way
[1:00:04] amen it's got to be
[1:00:09] wrong in the church brother Brown said
[1:00:11] amen that God even called The False Vine
[1:00:14] a
[1:00:16] church he said why did he do that he
[1:00:19] said the truth of the matter is that
[1:00:21] they are Christians but they're not
[1:00:23] Christians of the
[1:00:24] spirit they Christians of the flesh
[1:00:28] they're bearing the name in vain he said
[1:00:31] see amen they're bearing the name in
[1:00:33] vain but indeed they are Christians for
[1:00:35] what else could they be a muhammadan is
[1:00:38] a muhammadan that's his religion no
[1:00:40] matter how he lives because he's
[1:00:42] subscribes to the theory amen and to
[1:00:44] what the Quran teaches and it's the same
[1:00:46] thing with Christ a Christian is a
[1:00:48] Christian is long as he subscri
[1:00:50] subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the
[1:00:53] son of God born of a virgin crucified
[1:00:55] and died and rose again amen that he's a
[1:00:57] savior of mankind Etc in fact in the L O
[1:01:00] ofan age there will be those that will
[1:01:02] call themselves Christians because they
[1:01:04] subscribe to the Fine qualities of Jesus
[1:01:07] Amen while amen reserving to themselves
[1:01:10] the right to deny his
[1:01:13] deity Christian Scientists have done
[1:01:15] that already as well as multitudes who
[1:01:17] preach a social gospel see he is a
[1:01:21] nominal Christian and belongs to the
[1:01:23] church but he is not a true or spiritual
[1:01:26] believer because that kind of believer
[1:01:29] is one that's been baptized into the
[1:01:31] body of Jesus Christ as a member of
[1:01:35] him what did Jesus say he said in vain
[1:01:38] in vain do they worship me teaching for
[1:01:43] doctorine the Commandments of men amen
[1:01:46] amen laying aside the Commandment of God
[1:01:49] see you hold to the tradition of men as
[1:01:52] a washing of pots and cups and many
[1:01:53] other things that you do and he said
[1:01:56] unto them full well you reject the
[1:01:58] Commandment of God that you might keep
[1:01:59] your own tradition and watch in the 13th
[1:02:02] of God of none effect through your
[1:02:06] tradition which you have delivered many
[1:02:08] such uh uh which you have delivered in
[1:02:10] many such things you do amen what does
[1:02:12] that mean there amen it's making the
[1:02:14] word of God Amen a a
[1:02:18] void or it deprives it of force and
[1:02:23] Authority Amen in other words the word
[1:02:26] can be
[1:02:27] preached but it has no
[1:02:30] influence it has no power behind it
[1:02:34] listen you see that's what Jesus is
[1:02:36] saying you make the word of none effect
[1:02:39] by your
[1:02:40] tradition amen he said he said taking
[1:02:43] the church the prophet said taking the
[1:02:45] church the commandment and teaching of
[1:02:48] the Bible and explaining it all away see
[1:02:51] therefore you make the Commandments of
[1:02:53] God without any effect amen you because
[1:02:55] you explain it away amen let me just say
[1:02:58] Let Me Show You amen how how it is amen
[1:03:01] that's exactly what they' done by their
[1:03:02] tradition they make the word of none
[1:03:05] effect amen because you can take this
[1:03:07] Bible and you can read it right out of
[1:03:09] the Bible amen acts 238 amen water
[1:03:13] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:14] Christ and they'll see it amen and know
[1:03:17] that it's there amen but by because of
[1:03:20] the
[1:03:21] tradition what will they say well my
[1:03:23] church says or my pastor says well that
[1:03:25] Ain How We Do
[1:03:27] It come on church and they just explain
[1:03:31] it right away and the place that you can
[1:03:33] read listen don't you know them Baptists
[1:03:35] know them scriptures are in this Bible
[1:03:38] come on they know that scriptures over
[1:03:40] there in Corinthians about a woman
[1:03:41] cutting her hair they know it's in that
[1:03:43] Bible amen but you can read it to them
[1:03:45] you can preach it to them and it won't
[1:03:47] have no effect on them you know why
[1:03:49] because by their Traditions they have
[1:03:51] made the word of God of none effect
[1:03:56] because somebody come along and said
[1:03:58] that ain't what that
[1:04:00] means I don't mean that and you know you
[1:04:03] can read about a woman being clothed in
[1:04:05] modest apparel amen and somebody come
[1:04:08] out well that ain't what that means or a
[1:04:10] woman shouldn't wear a garment
[1:04:11] pertaining to a man and somehow come
[1:04:14] that ain't what that means and by their
[1:04:16] tradition they have made the word of God
[1:04:18] a n
[1:04:19] effect come on church and I wonder
[1:04:22] sometimes if we ain't got some of that
[1:04:24] around our message amen amen when you
[1:04:26] can preach amen and Men of God will
[1:04:29] stand and preach the word of
[1:04:31] God and the people would just go right
[1:04:33] on living the same way dressing the same
[1:04:36] way acting the same way I tell you what
[1:04:38] it is amen is somebody has come along
[1:04:41] amen and made the word of God of no
[1:04:45] effect the prophet of God said in the
[1:04:47] indictment They Crucified the
[1:04:53] effects how did that happen because they
[1:04:56] taught for
[1:04:59] Doctrine the Commandments of
[1:05:02] men come on I tell you what they done
[1:05:04] they took the man they took a man's word
[1:05:07] and they elevated it to the same place
[1:05:10] of God's
[1:05:12] word well
[1:05:15] hallelujah amen and they took the the
[1:05:17] word of a man and they begin to teach it
[1:05:20] for
[1:05:23] Doctrine oh it's the root of all legal
[1:05:25] ISM right
[1:05:27] there amen because it listen it ain't
[1:05:29] the Commandment of God it ain't nothing
[1:05:32] but a bunch of traditions and they took
[1:05:34] the Commandments of men and taught it
[1:05:36] for
[1:05:38] Doctrine Hallelujah but I want to just
[1:05:41] stand and say with all of that was in
[1:05:44] with within me this morning let every
[1:05:46] man's word be Al
[1:05:48] lie and let God's be
[1:05:52] true Hallelujah and I tell you what's
[1:05:54] wrong with a lot of people people
[1:05:55] they're looking at this message but
[1:05:58] they're looking at it through the
[1:05:59] glasses or some teacher or some man or
[1:06:02] some man's
[1:06:04] idea what we need to do is get back to
[1:06:06] the pure word of God and say it just the
[1:06:09] way he said it we don't need to explain
[1:06:11] it away we don't need to water it down
[1:06:14] and let me say this this message don't
[1:06:16] need a facelift it don't need to be
[1:06:18] cleaned up and purty pred up and fasted
[1:06:21] up amen what it needs is to be
[1:06:24] preached and GED and
[1:06:32] lived Hallelujah I say away with
[1:06:41] tradition I want to see
[1:06:44] God I want the word to have
[1:06:47] effect listen friend Traditions will
[1:06:50] kill the
[1:06:51] [Applause]
[1:06:53] effect sir and when it becomes a
[1:06:55] tradition all listen all Traditions
[1:06:57] ain't
[1:06:58] bad y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:07:00] you got family traditions and church
[1:07:03] traditions and all Traditions ain't bad
[1:07:07] but the problem is see when when when
[1:07:10] something becomes a tradition listen
[1:07:12] friends and and hey family traditions
[1:07:14] are
[1:07:16] fine and cookout traditions and I better
[1:07:20] be real careful right here cuz I was
[1:07:22] getting ready to say something else back
[1:07:24] out of that
[1:07:26] but anyhow amen there's some traditions
[1:07:29] but you can't serve God by
[1:07:33] tradition brother Brown begin to talk
[1:07:36] about it he said notice when Israel see
[1:07:39] when they first started out they would
[1:07:40] come and and there was sincerity in
[1:07:42] their
[1:07:44] worship and they come and they lay hands
[1:07:47] on the lamb and they were identified
[1:07:49] with their
[1:07:50] sacrifice and there was something behind
[1:07:53] there was something in their hearts
[1:07:57] there was sincerity in what they were
[1:08:00] doing but after a while amen they they
[1:08:03] just begin to do it because that's what
[1:08:04] they've always
[1:08:06] done and they didn't listen and and the
[1:08:08] children Amen to to begin to take on the
[1:08:12] tradition amen and they were offering
[1:08:14] the same lamb amen but there was no
[1:08:17] feeling behind it there was no sincerity
[1:08:20] in their worship and it become a
[1:08:22] tradition to them and God looked down on
[1:08:24] them and he said said it's become a
[1:08:26] stink in my
[1:08:27] nostrils your sacrifices your your holy
[1:08:30] days your amen your solemn feast all
[1:08:33] these things have become a stench in my
[1:08:34] nostrils amen why because it become a
[1:08:37] tradition they were doing it out of
[1:08:39] tradition oh come on Church you say

[1:09:12] Pentecostals and they're shouting and
[1:09:14] they're dancing amen and they don't even
[1:09:15] know why they're doing it amen because
[1:09:17] it's nothing but a
[1:09:20] tradition that's what was talked about
[1:09:22] in the B they have a form of God
[1:09:26] but deny the power
[1:09:28] [Applause]
[1:09:32] thereof
[1:09:33] hallelujah amen and I I pray to God Amen

[1:10:42] have no faith in them people are
[1:10:44] offering offerings without even having
[1:10:46] faith in what they're doing amen and
[1:10:48] let's just ask oursel the question isn't
[1:10:50] that something like today as bad as I
[1:10:52] hate to say it we got to face the fact
[1:10:54] there's something somewhere the church
[1:10:56] ought to be a million miles up the road
[1:10:58] to where it is now and Jesus is waiting
[1:11:00] on his church to get ready cuz his bride
[1:11:02] has had to make herself ready and we got
[1:11:05] the potentials the holy spirit is here
[1:11:08] God is here the power to heal the sick

[1:11:47] sons of God standing with the authority
[1:11:49] of the word of God that's the church
[1:11:52] that he's looking for
[1:11:58] Hallelujah the prophet of God I just had
[1:12:00] to agree with him amen because he said
[1:12:02] amen I want to be in a church amen that
[1:12:05] preaches the full word the Full Gospel
[1:12:08] he said I don't care if they got a
[1:12:10] golden cross on the wall amen or a pipe
[1:12:12] organ amen it don't matter to me he said
[1:12:15] if they got that and the spirit is there

[1:12:48] ain't in it you ain't done nothing

[1:12:59] veiled it will never change
[1:13:07] you and by Traditions they blocked off
[1:13:10] and amen and hid
[1:13:12] God but I got some good news for

[1:13:49] traditions and things and come to him
[1:13:51] you'll see him standing the mighty
[1:13:52] conquer the word promised for this old
[1:13:55] made manifest you'll see the Mighty God

[1:14:06] Traditions Hallelujah you're living in
[1:14:09] an age that they stacked it up and they
[1:14:11] stacked up every tradition and they put
[1:14:14] every Veil they could on the word but my
[1:14:16] God is a mighty conqueror go on the
[1:14:19] third day the your justification he
[1:14:22] broke the veil of unbelief Hallelujah
[1:14:25] and in this day he broke the veil of
[1:14:27] tradition and he remains unconquered by
[1:14:34] tradition
[1:14:36] Hallelujah that's why in this age of
[1:14:39] tradition in this age of denomination
[1:14:42] when they had it so denominated so tight
[1:14:44] that God couldn't move he sent Malachi
[1:14:47] 4 and he walked right through the
[1:14:50] tradition and he book through every Veil
[1:14:55] and reveal
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:15:03] Christ oh I just now want to
[1:15:06] [Applause]
[1:15:10] preach that's why Paul says seeing then
[1:15:12] we have such
[1:15:14] hope we use plainness of
[1:15:17] speech come on Friends Paul said we use
[1:15:20] plainness of spe no we we ain't up here
[1:15:23] mention words no more
[1:15:25] come on we amen you ain't oh come on
[1:15:29] church amen we use plainness of speech
[1:15:32] not as Moses was
[1:15:34] abolished see but their minds were
[1:15:37] blinded and until this day the they the
[1:15:40] remaineth the same Veil and taken away
[1:15:42] in the reading of the of old testament
[1:15:44] which Veil is done away in Christ but
[1:15:46] even un this day when Moses has read the
[1:15:48] veil is upon their
[1:15:50] heart nevertheless when it shall
[1:15:53] turn Hallelujah
[1:15:56] when the heart shall
[1:15:57] turn in Malachi 4 said behold I sent
[1:16:02] unto you
[1:16:03] Elijah and he shall turn the hearts of
[1:16:07] the children to the faith of the fathers
[1:16:11] and when the heart is turned the veil is
[1:16:13] taken
[1:16:14] away Hallelujah and when the veil is
[1:16:16] taken away amen the the the the the the
[1:16:19] eyes of your understanding are
[1:16:21] open amen and you see Christ come on
[1:16:25] Friends when the veil is taken away amen
[1:16:27] you won't see amen just a better

[1:16:33] won't just see a
[1:16:35] Prophet come on friends thank God we

[1:36:34] of Israel saw Moses behold the skin of
[1:36:36] his face Shone and they were afraid to
[1:36:38] come nigh and Moses called unto them and
[1:36:42] and Aaron and all the rulers of the
[1:36:43] congregation returned unto him and Moses
[1:36:46] talked with them and afterward all the
[1:36:48] children of Israel came nigh and gave
[1:36:51] them in
[1:36:53] and he gave them in commandment all that
[1:36:56] the Lord had spoken with him in the
[1:36:57] mount SII until Moses had done speaking
[1:37:00] with them he put a veil on his face but
[1:37:03] when Moses went in before the Lord to
[1:37:05] speak with him he took the veil off
[1:37:08] until he came out see he came out and
[1:37:10] spake the children of Israel that which
[1:37:12] he was commanding the children and the
[1:37:13] children of Israel saw the face of Moses
[1:37:15] and the skin of Moses face did Shine and
[1:37:18] Moses put a veil over his face again
[1:37:20] until he went back in to speak with him
[1:37:21] so you got to catch this that when Moses
[1:37:23] mooses went into God's presence he he
[1:37:25] wasn't
[1:37:27] veiled Moses was not veiled from
[1:37:30] God and brother BR would say see because

[1:37:36] cloud amen and and and and and and the
[1:37:39] way brother Brown would say say he went
[1:37:40] into the
[1:37:42] word amen and and there was no Veil
[1:37:45] between him and God and and so much that
[1:37:48] when Moses was in the presence of God
[1:37:51] and he was beholding that word
[1:37:54] that word begin to change him you see
[1:37:58] and when he come out of the presence of
[1:38:00] God he was reflecting the glory of
[1:38:03] God Amen but when he come off the
[1:38:05] mountain the people were afraid they
[1:38:07] weren't afraid of
[1:38:09] Moses they were afraid of the glory of

[1:38:43] no way for the to get the word amen amen
