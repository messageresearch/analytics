and and and not and not to faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not and he would not for a while but afterwards he said he he said within himself though I fear not God nor nor nor regard men yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her Les lest by her continual coming she worry me um and and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and a and shall not God avenge his own his own elect which CED day and night un unto him though he bear long with them and I tell you that he will avenge them speedily NE nevertheless when when the son of man cometh will he find faith on on the earth amen let's all bow our heads our dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you and Lord how thankful we are father to come in your presence just once again Lord we ask you father just to come down lord and just move in such a mighty special way we ask you Lord just to help me to lay myself aside Lord just speak to me or speak speak through me father and Lord just just we ask you father just to touch the hearts of the people we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen y'all can have your seats I uh um wanted to speak just just for just a a little bit on the subject of perseverance um um when I looked up the word and the Very word perseverance means a continued effort to do or achieve something despite difficulties failures or opposition persisting steadfastly without without giving up continuing in spite of difficulties or setbacks amen persevering hey um but uh um um um we we we and we can look in the Bible and brother BR has preached on this subject many many times actually um but but we can we can look in the Bible of of many examples of men and women in the Bible who have persevered though though Satan came came against them in in many different ways but yet but yet these but yet these these these men and women of God they stood fast on God's word and and and they pressed through whatever trial of whatever trial came their way amen and and and if you can you can you can look at Moses when for when when when when when when um when be before before he he he he he went to the backside of the desert he he ran away away from from the opposition because he was scared but yet after he had that experience with God and he met that that that that pillar that that Pillar of Fire face to face he he he he he became a different man a changed man and nothing and nothing then and nothing then was was was going to stop him brother brother brand said said said said said said that said that that he stayed there until something cut cut loose inside of him and um and uh um and and and and Moses he he he he went down down down down to Egypt and and and brother brandom called it a uh a modern day Russia where where the whole world was was was was scared of him but yet he he went down there a one man Invasion and an old man an old man with a stick in his hands and yet and yet and and and yet he he he went there and and he persevered even though Pharaoh told him no time and time again he stood confident in his calling and and then the word and and and and next thing know and next thing and next thing we know he he he he he he took over but but brother Bram say said that God only has to have one man one person somewhere that's tied that's tied to him someone who knows where they're standing and is perseverance the the persecutions then the um the the difference is it doesn't bother them at all going down to take over and he did it and and and and and and and and yet and yet and yet we we can go on down through history and look at look at shamgar when when when those when those those those those Phil those Philistines came marching against them and he stood confident in his calling a and he slew those those th those those Philistines why because because because he was a man who stood confident and he and he persevered through through through through through or he he he he PR AED through it through all the fears and the doubts and the worries that must have have have have plagued his mind and he stood confident in his calling and and he overcome and um brother Randon was talking about about David and he said and he said and that devil had made his boast in front of a man of God one time and he called us he he he called his his he called his hand on it why he knowed who God was and said and said I'll he said you mean to tell me that you'll let the armies of the Living God let that uncircumcised Philistine defy the armies armies defy the armies of the Living God he said I'll go I'll go fight him he said Oh my he said why he was persistent and he said he said you cannot out talk a man when something has done happened to him why why why why because when when when David was on was on the back side of the desert Hur hurting those those those sheep and and and night after night after night he he he he would have those experiences with God where where where he could stand confident in who he was knowing knowing that God promised that that that that that as long as as as he was serving his God and there was nothing between between between him and God nothing nothing nothing could stand before be be be be be for him so so he could stand there in all confidence and and and and and and he could look at that at that giant the same way as as he looked at that lion and that bear and and and and and and he he was he stood confident in that and and and he slew him amen amen um brother random says it say say says says it says that a winner never quits and a quitter never wins just think of it a winner never quits and a quitter never wins you must hold on and before you even start be dead sure you're right and then and then be and then be persistent let nothing let nothing let nothing move you go on I've had quite a bit of experience experience of that that that that and you know it he say I I know this one thing when you're dead sure that you're in the will of God and when you're dead sure you're cented in in Calvary there is nothing going going there's nothing going to move you you're there amen and so so so so so so so so so so and so we can sit back and we look at Faith in our own lives and and and and and and and and realize that that that that even though the world around us can't see it can't see it and yet when all hell is breaking against us we can stand confident in our calling and confident in who we are as the bride of Christ Christ and we can stand stand firm in faith faith and even though our natural lie can't see it but but yet we as a bride of Christ we can see it because because because because it's it's who we are it's in our DNA but but but but but and brother brand said the first thing you have to do if you're going to find Christ you've got to know that you've got a need of him and when you think that you just don't then you just don't need him then you'll never find him cuz you won't search him out diligently he he he said he he said he you notice the scripture where seek and he shall find knock and it shall be open he said actually that's just not not not just not a knock a knock like like this and brother man knocks on the pull pit once and and and and it will be open he he he he said he said he said he said he's not he's not just just just just is saying well well I I went out Lord here I am you want me he said no he said no that's not it he that seeketh he that seeketh is he that is is is he that knocketh continuation and brother Ram knocked several times several times on on the pulpit it has to compare with the with with the rest with the rest of of of of of of the scriptures and and he says he he says you might have a lot of of of hindrances and and every person that starts out to beat Christ will find you have got a lot of of of hindrances but your faith won't have any faith don't have no no no hindrances faith has got hairs on its chest and great big muscles reasons will raise up and said and said you know it's reasonable and Faith pulls his muscles back and sticks his big chest out and says shut up and sit down and reads and jumps over in the corner and takes a stool right faith has got muscles and he means what he says and that's what what we need what we need what we need need tonight and that's what the Four Square Church needs and that's what the Pentecostal group needs that's what the whole rule needs that's what I need that's what you you need and we are ought and we ought and we ought to be ashamed to admit it but we need a faith that will hold God's word and say it's true and meet the devil and say thus sayith the lord it's a perseverance but but but but but but when we we come when we come forward with with whatever we need as the bride of Christ we we we we can get down there down there down there on our knees and all confidence we're not begging God we're we're not asking say God will you please will you please will you please but but we're coming in confidence as the bride of Christ and as a child and as a child and and as a child of God and we can come in confidence knowing that what God has promised he will fulfill for for what he has done in the past he has to he has to do it again again we not we're not we're not we're not just a a trotten down um um um um we're we're not just a trot down sinner we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and we can come forward in confidence and we can stand on the word that God has already has already promised it brother random said said said that that that that he can do nothing else than what he has already done and what he has he has already done so we can come forward in those promises and we can stand there knowing that God will fulfill what he what what with what with whatsoever he he has promised why you can just you can stand there in confidence and be persistent at it it might it might take a day it might take a week it might it might take a year but you can be you can be per per persistent at it at and shemi Beth is a perfect is a perfect example of that after 20 years of being persistent since I moved here I'll get I I I I I I'll say this when I used when I used to work with shamay and them a lot he would tell me every day God has not given me my baby yet he said but it is in the making and that man has stood there in confidence and knowing in the promises of what God has has promised him he has stood there in confidence knowing that God will fulfill it why and I and and I personally I've been promised to me the healing of my stuttering and I know for sure God one day soon will will completely will he he he he he will completely heal me of it why because I can stand here in confidence and all Assurance knowing that that whatsoever God has promised he will fulfill it why because we know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today a and and forever why if he's the same then if if he done it in the past he has to do it again today Satan is fighting us with everything that that that that that with everything that that that with everything that he's got got right now he's hitting us with with sickness with vehicle problems with with with with with with bills and with with mind battles and depressions and all this stuff but yet we as the bride of Christ we can stand confident in what God has has has called us not not wavering left or right we can stand persistent in what God has has given us which is which is the the the word of God in the message of the hour we've had people come in this message and we've had them leave they've they they've showed up and and they made a great name a great name a great name name name name name a great name for themselves but we notice as soon as they as as they go off as they got off the word they fell they fell by the wayside it is it is and it is it is in inevitable as the bride of Christ we will come across discouragements we'll come across obstacles we we will come across Boulders in the road will come across our trials and and and and and and our our our tribulations but but but but but but yet but yet we can we we can March forward and stand on the word of God and be persistent at it at it we will see that thing that we've been praying for come to pass when when we're on the mountain top it's easy to stay strong but but but but it it's when you're in the valley is is is when the Trials come if you look at the law contrast that that and brother random has taught has taught it many times but but but you would never know how to appreciate the daytime if you never had a night and and you never know how how to appreciate the sunshine if if you didn't have a cloudy day you would never know H H how how how how how how to to to to appreciate the righteousness unless you had unless you had had had some unrighteousness you you would never know no no no how how to to appreciate Health unless un unless you you've you've you've had some sicknesses you've had got your good health and you got your bad Health you you got your good days and you got your bad days and and and you look at um just drinking good water versus bad water I've been hun hunting hun hunting in the mountains out before and I ran out of water and I found a mud hole and I was so thirsty I drank it I didn't die but it was so nasty but to me then I I I was so appreciative of that water cuz I thought I was going to die out there but when I got back when I got back to the car I had gallons of fresh FR water in the back of my truck and I have never been more appreciative of of of of Walmart water in all my life as as to when I got back to that truck why because because I seen the law the law of contrast before it was just it's just water but but but yet when I got desperate when I no longer had had had that thing that I took common it became it became lifegiving to me it became it became precious precious to me but but but that's why that's why we as the bride we we can appreciate the whole holy spirit so much tonight is because is because we can step back and we can look at all the denominational churches churches and they're up and they're down and they're and they're this and they're that and and all they do is they live off of motions or if you're a Baptist you you live off of off of the letter of the law and most of them are are off that but but but yet but yet we as the bride we can stand we can look back at it and we can be so appreciative of the Holy Ghost living and indwelling in our lives we can be so appreciative of the message of the hour tonight why because we have seen what what the what the world what the world will will will will will will or what the world has has has has produced but we can stand and be and be and be thankful for for what God has has H has has has produced has produced in the message of the hour why because it's the law of contrast job if you look at job you can see he he he was a he was a perfect man in every way he he he he he was upright and he was right righteous but but but yet but yet but yet but yet God said or but God said Satan have you considered my servant job and and and and and he said and he said I can't because because because because because because you have a hedge around but so God let that that let that let that let that head hedge down next thing you know his children have died his servants have died his wealth was gone his his flocks his flocks of the sheep and herds and his herds and his cattle were gone his friends were mocking him his wife his wife finally looked at him and said just curse God and die but but but he looked at her and he stood there and all confidence knowing knowing knowing who he was and and that and that he was a Son of God and he said the lord giveth and the lord taketh blessed be the name of the Lord why he was persistent in his calling and he knew that that that that that he had not transgress the Lord and he knew that there was no reason why why why why why why he he he was going he that know the reason why he was going through those battles so he could stand confident in his calling knowing that that God was faithful and and and and just cuz why it's blessed be the name of the Lord so so so when we are on our mountain top and everything is going well and our our health is good and our bills are paid and and and and and the kids are getting along great and spiritually it seems like the Devils can't seem to touch us but but but but but but yet we no we don't have to fight as easy it's much easier to to um to to to to stay to to to to to stay stay strong because because because because we have we haven't gone through the trials and the tribulations we're coasting on the mountain top but in Luke chapter 16 and and the 16th verse it says the law and the prophets were until John and since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses in into it every man presses into it not we don't just simply walk into it easily but it's got to be pressed into it you see so the Bible says when you seek me with all your heart then then then then you shall find so so when we are in the valley that's when our character is molded that's that's that that's when that's when that's when we're shaped and that's when and that's when we're like that diamond who through all that all that pressure and that heat and everything else it it it it it it it comes forth as a diamond if that diamond was was to give away at any time it would be nothing but a worthless chunk of cold cold but yet be yet that diamond has endured it it's it's come through the trials and the tribulation and it has come forth as as one of the most rare substance on on the face of the Earth and if you look at if you look at gold that gold is it has in order in in order for for it to be purified it has to be beat and beat and beat until all that dross and all the all the bad stuff is is is drawn out of it to where nothing but you reflect the character of him or or you reflect the image of him of him of him that that that is beating on you brother brother Bram said unless we suffer with him we cannot Reign we cannot Reign reign with him you have to suffer to rain the reason for it is this is the character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man cannot without character cannot Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and has sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome and sit with him and all the little temporary temporary suffering that we go through now is not worthy is not worthy to to be compared to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation so so so so now we we we can see that that that that that that that that it's in The Valleys is when our has when our character is formed and through that trial and those tribulations where where that's that's what's molding us and shaping us and it's it's turning us into his image and in his likeness and in his glory this is where God's Warriors are separated from the make Believers this is this is this is where this is where God has called us has called us to to to take up that that Armor of God and to stand strong and fight and fight and and fight for what we've got to to to to fight for our children to to to to to to fight for our God GI given given given given in in in inheritance if you have need of healing tonight you can stand strong on God's word and you can fight for it why you you you can be persevering perseverant Tonight Tonight T not not to give up if it doesn't happen with the first couple minutes not to give up if if it doesn't happen with the first hour but yet you can stand there and if it takes years and years and years you can stand there year after year after year and stand confident in the calling and what God has called you why because we as the bride of Christ we can stand here in all authority and in all power and in all confidence knowing who we are as the bride of Christ we are not just some little trod down down down down down Center but we are the we are royalty we are the Bride of Jesus Christ Christ we are have been put on this Earth to overcome the devil God God said God said somebody will and we are we are those that that will we are here to lift up a standard in these last days God said what is in th Thy Thy Thy Thy hand hand hand hand Moses and he said it's a rod and he asked Jamar what is it what is in what is in in in thy hand and it's knock go and what is in th Thy Thy Thy hand Elisha it's a mantle what is in thy hand hand David it's a sling but bride what have we got in our hands in in our hands tonight we have the message of the hour and that and that and and and brother Rand said if God can ever get us to disbelieve our our our weapon he's got us whooped right there so so we can we if we take this message of the hour and we cling to it and we and we stand upon it knowing and be confident in in our calling in in in Christ where we can become so close to God that Satan that Satan that Satan do doesn't even know what to do with this we have to knock our the we have to knock the idea out of our out out of our heads that we cannot fail as long as we're standing on God's word nothing can stop us we are predestinated as the bride of Christ to not fail God promised it he will fulfill it so so so so so so we can look wherever there's a there's a there's a pro there's a con that where there's a negative there's a positive and and and and whether there's a bogus dollar there's a real one and and we all know that where there's somebody that's mocking and and and pretending and pretending to to to to to pretending to have the have the holy ghost ghost remember there's a genuine one one one one one somewhere and brother Ram said that the very thing that will help you the very thing that that that will that that that that that will deliver you the thing that will take you out of your prison House of habit take you take you take you out of your prison houses of fear and upset and upset thing thing that will take you away from the cancer and make you living a living creature again the thing that'll raise you up in the last days stands right near you out and you're scared of it don't be afraid it's him he he said he he he he says and and and and another place is that our heavenly father we thank thee for the Sunday School lesson that's now stirred s stirred that's now stirred in our hearts maybe guard ourselves up up up this morning and go from prisons of unbelief and be free as as we walk we know that the angels of the Lord will go before us confirming the word of God and free every one of us from the prisons of fear and of sickness and distress and disease and afflictions for God has promised to and and he says and he says and he says in another place that one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear everybody is scared to death it's it's what it's what's going to happen who what why Jesus said even when the fearful sights come lift up your head and rejoice for for for your Redemption draw Li when these things happen so we can stand strong and be and be and be and be perseverant and not fear we can stand here and all confidence and all assurance and we can watch watch the peace of God of God of God and and and enter enter enter enter enter enter your your life why because we are divinely called group of people in this earth and we have been given the authority to stand to to to to to stand to stand on this word when when when because we're we are called to rise up and and and to take a stand not not to go not to go not not to go in in in in in that in that jail in in that Jail House of slavery and and we're being bound up by fear and we're and we're too scared to to um to uh take a step and God's promises but yeah if we can just if we can just take we can just take this mess and take this word and realize who we are and take a step out out out out on that jail house house house we can be set we we can be be be set be set free why we don't have to beg we don't have to worry is God going to do it we don't have to say please Lord please please please please why we can stand confident in in our calling knowing that what he has promised he will fulfill we can be perseverant with him um and so for um brother brandom said said for your faith that you might have perfect confidence when you're told anything stay right with that don't leave don't you leave a bit a bit of it no matter how she twist or blows you stay right there God promised it God will do it is that right and he says in another spot it says and God looking over the Earth to see for a man that he could put confidence in that he would that he would believe him regardless of circumstances he found he he found Abraham and called Abraham by elction and and it said and God called Abraham just because he was a man that that that God called Abraham just because he was a man that he could trust and he believed him and he put confidence in him and he told him that at the age of 75 he was married to his Half Sister Sarah and she was 65 he said there's 10 years of difference but God told Abraham that he was going to make him a father of Nations um and he said I'm going to make you a father of Nations and how and how is he going is how's he he he going he he how is he going to do it what can happen but Abraham never staggers never staggered at that he just believed God cuz he had confident and what God promised God would fulfill and and and and brother BR said another spot said and Jesus Christ came from Heaven to Glory from Glory down here to build a church and that material that he's putting in it is time tested material you might come to to to the Altar and make a confession but when he finds blow holes and everything else into where the world's where the world's blown the maggots in you and so forth you cannot stand he just pitches you you you to one side God wants a times tested church not somebody who's a Christian today and a backslid and a backslider a backslider tomorrow and his ups and his downs and he can't place you nowhere but he says but he has got a church that's been tested and when when went through the trials through losses through sickness through sorrow through death and still standing with the testimony he he said that's the man yes that's the man who who who that's a man that's that's a man he's looking for I don't care if you're a poer I don't care I don't care I don't care if you're beggar I don't care if you're a rack picker whatever you are God puts the test to you he's looking for time tested materials and and he say another spot I'm sorry if these are too many quotes it's just I thought these was just really good he se he said how Elijah was tested and Elisha was tested and proed before he could wear a prophet's robe how Elisha throw that throw that robe around his shoulder now he must be the right man Elisha watched him watched him there there there there in the field where he was pling and God said that's the man that's the man that can wear that that that that that that that garment that's the man that can wear that robe he can take your place blessed be the name be the name of of the Lord he said how he's all seeing eyes moving over the Earth trying to trying to find some man that'll wear that robe that that he that robe that that he that that he he talked about he said can you drink the cup that I drink can you be baptized with the baptism I am you can and and and he said he said he said to them so we today as a church are to put on the robe of Christ the whole armor of Christ the whole Shield the Buckler and the armor that we might stand blameless at that day he's looking for some time tested memorials as he can say there's my servant I've tested him I've tried him I put him through like I did job and he still proves 100% God be merciful to us that we can take God at his word and be time tested memorials and we as the bride of Christ who who we know God as a personal way we don't have to wonder if we're loved one day and and the next day we just we just we just we just we just we just aren't sure or we we but we know a living God who who we know a God that has never failed us and and never will and when all hell is breaking loose and it feels like that nobody may love you or that nobody May care or or that you ain't that or that or that or that or that or that or that or that you you ain't you ain't going to make it the Rapture but we know a living God a God that feels a God that a God that heals the broken heart he saves the lost and he knows just exactly when we are are are are hurting or that or that when we have a need of a healing or that when we have a need of of a of of a of a complex to be to be taken out but yeah but yet because we we serve a living God a living God tonight and we are standing upon his word that he has promised us and we are going to stand here and be perseverant and be and be perseverant with it why because because what God has promised he will fulfill it so he's the God the same God that made the universe is the same God it's the same God it's the same God that is going to take us home someday soon if we'll just stand if we'll just if we'll just persevere and stand on his word he didn't bring us this far just to leave us he didn't he didn't teach us to swim just to let us drown he what what what he has accomplished or what he has started in us he will fulfill it that's right if the musician wants to come and he said brother said and Abraham you're old your strength is gone your arms are withered up your manhood is gone but I am your mother just take a hold of my promise and be satisfied while you're waiting be rested he said now that's the way every believer no matter how bad the Cancer's got you how long that you've been sitting in a wheelchair any of those things if you can just grasp that Revelation from God then be satisfied knowing that it's going to happen because Faith Waits Waits patiently for the promise see he said he said he said the quickening power lets us see his coming quickening power snatches us us snatches us from death to life quickening power gives gives gives gives a gives gives discernment to know what's wrong with you and what to do and what you have done what you ought what you what you not ought not not have done and what you should have done and what you will be quickening power all these things he said our lord Jesus is so full of quickening power he was he was all of it together he was so full of quickening power he said this you destroy this body and I'll raise it up in 3 days talk about confidence and a quickening power to destroy this body a and I'll this Temple bring it up in 3 days he said why why did he say that he knew that it was it was written of him see that it was written of him by the word of God which could not fail the word said I will not suffer my Holy One to to see corruption and neither will I leave his soul in hell and he know that quickening power could raise his him up and there wouldn't be one cell corrupted and we can stand in all confidence and in all authority knowing that whatsoever God has promised it he will fulfill it because he is faithful and just and we know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen I uh I I know it was a little short tonight but I hope it was a blessing why because because we can stand there in in in in in the power of his resurrection in all confidence and in all and and all Assurance knowing who we are so all hell can can can can can come against us the waves can blow and and and the tempt us may may may threaten to to to to knock us over but yet we have Jesus in the boat in the boat with us and the same God that that created that that has created the universe in us and he created the winds and the waves and that same God can calm those storms tonight amen do you love him amen Jesus we've got the power in the name of the Lord oh those sa and raes we cannot be defeated we got the power in the name of the Lord oh give me your hand [Music] let's agree together let all of our enemies will come last our [Music] feet for whatever we B on Earth shall be bound in hell [Music] at the name of Jesus Satan has to flee oh we've got the power in the name [Applause] [Music] Lord oh those Satan rages we cannot be defeated for we've got the power in the name of the Lord now for many years Satan's tried to stop us but the Bride of Jesus is still alive oh yes like a mighty Army he is marching upward when in every battles with the Lord by our side singing now we've got the power in the name of Jesus we've got the power it's in the name of the Lord oh Satan raes we cannot be defeated we've got the power in the name of the lord well aren't you glad we've got the power Amen in the name of the Lord amen this bride is going to be perseverant with everything that's within her is going to keep pressing amen we've got to keep doing that now amen no matter what comes our way no matter what the devil does Amen this bride is becoming more in a minority all the time amen but um the Bible says he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved ain't that right amen we really appreciate the sermon this evening amen and I think it spoke to all of our hearts Amen to keep pressing going amen we ain't got nothing to look back to amen but every promise in the book amen is before us amen and we must just keep pressing amen I love the Lord amen there's that song in jesus' name we press on Amen oh in Jesus name we press on oh yes yes in Jesus name we press on dear Lord with the price clear before our eyes we find the strength to press on sing it again oh in his name we press on [Music] hallelujah oh in Jesus name we pray s yeah dear Lord with the price clear before our eyes we find the strength to press on as they just play softly I you know Israel is a type of us in so many ways and the Bible and I see that little Old Nation today that is fighting for its life fighting for its existence and all the nations around are turning against her and telling them to stop and cease fire and you know work a deal but there's something down inside them that says no we're not going to do that it's our rights it's it's we you know and um I thought you know if a natural Nation can have that resolve and we truly know that their resolve comes from God Almighty because there's there's that 144,000 that has to be sealed and they're falling right in line it's there she's in position she's she's wakening up everything just exactly the way God had prophesied and here we see them and yet they don't know what who they are like we would know who we are but yet they're they're following right in line and God's behind them God's giving them that that motivation that whatever you would want to call it and um I thought oh God if if a little Old Nation can do that what about this bride we're the apple of his eye we are we are his heartbeat we are his we're not just servants we're bride we're the ones that he's called to reign with him you realize that it's already been said that we're going to be Overcomers already been said that that uh we're going to we're going to reign with him and I I believe I'm going to be that one that's going to reign with him and we're we're building character now because uh Power without character is satanic and this this this power that been given to us this reain that we're going to reign with him it isn't going to be inspired of the devil it's it's not nothing satanic about it it's going to be a people that has been shaped and molded amen and and coming into that image of Christ amen and so this bride will have that determination to press on no matter what comes against her and and as I've said before you know I mean looking at Israel when you look at her on the map compared to every everybody else she is just a little old almost a little spec in on the map and yet God chose that Nation God chose that people amen and uh the promises are there well think of how Authority we are as the bride of Christ compared to the world of billions and billions of people on the face of the Earth and there's that small little bride but the promises of God are with her so you must you must keep pressing can you say amen amen we love the Lord and um uh it's good to be back uh in the house of the Lord and appreciate brother Terry for filling in for us uh Sunday and uh heard you had just a good service and
