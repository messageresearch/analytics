[35:41] amen um John 13 and I'm going to start
[35:45] at the first
[35:53] verse and
[35:56] um but it says uh now before the Feast
[36:00] of the Passover when Jesus knew that his
[36:02] hour was come that he should depart out
[36:05] of this world unto the father having
[36:07] loved his own which were in the world he
[36:09] loved them unto the end and supper being
[36:12] ended the devil having now put into the
[36:15] heart of Judas the scarat Simon's son to
[36:18] betray him Jesus knowing that the father
[36:22] had given all things into his hands now
[36:25] what knowledge that is the the the
[36:28] understanding of that Jesus
[36:31] understanding having this knowledge that
[36:33] the father had given all things into his
[36:36] hand and that he was come from God and
[36:39] went to god notice what he does next he
[36:43] riseth from supper laid aside his
[36:46] garments and took a towel and girded
[36:49] himself after that he pth water into a
[36:52] basin and began to wash the disciples
[36:55] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[36:58] where withth he was
[36:59] GED then cometh to he to Simon Peter and
[37:03] Peter saith unto him Lord does thou wash
[37:06] my feet Jesus answered and said unto him
[37:09] what I do thou knowest not but Thou
[37:12] shalt know
[37:14] Hereafter amen you can have your
[37:18] seats this evening and of course this uh
[37:22] this scripture reading is a uh
[37:26] is
[37:28] scripture that we read during our U
[37:30] communion service but I thought
[37:33] it uh prudent to uh read
[37:37] it at this
[37:39] time and
[37:41] um brother branam uses this scripture as
[37:45] a
[37:46] foundation when he preaches
[37:49] um uh the message images of Christ there
[37:53] in
[37:56] 59 but I I thought of this that he knows
[38:00] he he knew he knew he came from God he
[38:03] was going to return to God he knew that
[38:07] the father had given all things into his
[38:10] hands what what a knowledge that is that
[38:13] that is a knowledge that no no man can
[38:15] ever obtain without God giving that to
[38:18] him it was a divine
[38:21] revelation and um and but but then you
[38:26] know of course we know who Jesus was he
[38:28] was God made flesh and he was the King
[38:32] of Kings the Lord of lords the almighty
[38:35] The
[38:37] Undefeated champion of love you know we
[38:40] sing about and all these things he was
[38:46] the Father's Love gift to to the world
[38:52] he carried the heart of the
[38:54] Father And yet when he this he knew what
[38:59] he was he knew his his place he knew
[39:04] these things and yet he didn't rise and
[39:09] say now you know um let's let's let's
[39:13] build a denomination or let's let's
[39:15] build this Kingdom or let's you know you
[39:18] guys need to bow down to me and and all
[39:21] these things but he actually uh takes
[39:26] the lowest
[39:28] humblest role that a man could could
[39:32] take and that is a footwash
[39:35] flunky I
[39:37] mean uh he knows he knows that the
[39:40] father had given all things into his
[39:42] hands he knows who he is right you go
[39:45] listen to the perfect faith and and
[39:48] brother brand you know talks about uh
[39:51] that Jesus knew he he knew he was God he
[39:55] he knew he lived by that faith and
[39:58] and um he said all power in Heaven and
[40:00] Earth is given unto me so he had all of
[40:03] this knowledge and yet he lays aside his
[40:07] robes and takes on a towel put he grabs
[40:10] a towel and he kneels before his
[40:13] disciples and he begins to wash their
[40:15] old dirty
[40:17] feet and you know uh the Bible says that
[40:22] Jesus came to seek and to save that
[40:24] which was
[40:26] lost and he shows how he would do that
[40:29] and that would be to take on the form of
[40:31] a servant he took on the form of the
[40:33] servant as we talked about it and there
[40:36] in
[40:38] John uh the the says that he he
[40:42] Sanctified himself he Sanctified himself
[40:45] for the sake of
[40:46] others and then the prophet said he was
[40:49] he was teaching his
[40:50] disciples that they would have to do
[40:53] this same thing if they were to carry on
[40:56] his min Ministry we talk about carrying
[40:59] on the ministry of Christ and and how
[41:01] true that is we are the bride of
[41:03] Christ but but there's a way to carry
[41:06] this out and and Jesus would show us by
[41:10] taking on the form of a
[41:13] servant and so the prophet says see
[41:16] Jesus never lived for himself he's he
[41:18] his life was spent for others that's
[41:20] perfectly eternal life when you say you
[41:24] go to church and you do good things
[41:26] that's fine but when you live for your
[41:28] your life to yourself you have an
[41:30] eternal life eternal life is living for
[41:32] others and so it proved it when it come
[41:35] in the Lamb of God this eternal life
[41:38] come into to the Lamb of God and he
[41:43] lived and had eternal life because he
[41:46] did not live for himself he lived for
[41:48] others and you receive eternal life by
[41:51] receiving that day and you don't live
[41:54] for yourself no more you live for others
[41:56] right so so someone says uh said well
[41:59] how can you stand and let somebody call
[42:02] you such bad names well you don't live
[42:05] for
[42:06] yourself you live for others and notice
[42:09] how he puts it that you might redeem
[42:12] that
[42:13] man you live for
[42:15] others for the purpose that you might
[42:18] redeem that man see you become sons and
[42:22] the trouble of it is the church has
[42:24] forgot they were Sons so I think that's
[42:27] important I think that's what he's
[42:29] trying to say is we're coming to know
[42:31] who we are we talk about knowing who we
[42:34] are right it's important that we know
[42:36] who we are but with this knowledge of
[42:39] knowing who we are we become more
[42:43] humble we become more with a servant
[42:46] heart amen can you say Amen see you
[42:50] become sons and the trouble of it is the
[42:52] church has forgot that they were Sons
[42:54] you are a son you are Tak taking
[42:57] Christ's place you're a son so don't
[43:00] live for yourself live for others and
[43:04] why do we live for others that we might
[43:06] redeem that man ain't that right well
[43:10] brother brandom I can live for this
[43:12] brother because he's sure is a nice man
[43:14] that's not it live for that man that
[43:17] hates you live for that person who would
[43:20] kill you if they could that's what they
[43:22] done to him they killed him and he died
[43:26] that he might save them see that's
[43:29] eternal life see when that's in your
[43:32] bosom you're facing heaven then but you
[43:35] sacrifice your own things give them up
[43:38] like the sheep gives its wool you look
[43:41] on towards Calvary can you say Amen am
[43:45] so we we live we live in this life we
[43:49] live for others that we might redeem
[43:51] them we we don't live so that we can
[43:54] have their friendship we don't live so
[43:57] so that we can we we we can be popular
[43:59] among the crowd we don't live for others
[44:02] to to gain uh uh something back from
[44:05] them we live for others that we might
[44:08] redeem them amen ain't that right so so
[44:12] now God made it to where we must come in
[44:14] contact with Sinners we must come in
[44:17] contact and again this is what I was
[44:19] saying this morning this is why Satan
[44:20] wants to isolate us and he does that
[44:22] through complexes and through hurts and
[44:25] and and and and STS and and troubles and
[44:29] disappointments and everyone's going to
[44:31] be disappointed in
[44:32] somebody I guarantee you we all
[44:34] disappoint one another you you can't
[44:37] tell me that that your your spouse
[44:39] doesn't disappoint you in one way or
[44:40] another at some point amen hello it may
[44:44] be just something little I'm not talking
[44:45] about them affecting your love for them
[44:48] but but we we we all have
[44:50] disappointments ain't that right see so
[44:53] so then but yet uh uh through all of
[44:56] this and and if that happens in the in a
[44:58] marriage it happens in a church it
[45:00] happens with it it just happens and and
[45:04] and and yet and then and through that
[45:05] Satan uh builds complexes and we all get
[45:09] and and before you know it it becomes
[45:10] easy to be divided it becomes easy to
[45:13] isolate it becomes easy to whatever but
[45:15] God has made us for contact we got to
[45:19] have contact with Sinners so so you see
[45:22] how do we project something if it cannot
[45:24] be seen right so so I I looked up the
[45:29] word uh uh project it means to present
[45:32] for
[45:33] consideration amen so so brother Ram
[45:37] says you know says many people pray for
[45:39] Sinners he said that's all right but
[45:41] that's not the way to win a sinner it's
[45:43] your business to win the center
[45:46] everybody say it's my business to win
[45:48] the
[45:50] center it's your business to win the
[45:52] centner you don't win him by praying for
[45:55] him you win him by talking to him and
[45:59] introducing to him
[46:02] Christ ain't that right see that's your
[46:04] business that your duty is to win
[46:07] Sinners by talking to them and
[46:10] projecting projecting to them the love
[46:13] of God through the word of God that wins
[46:17] The Sinner somebody say well I wouldn't
[46:20] go to church I sure like that woman I
[46:22] sure like that fallacy because you're
[46:25] winning them right you're becoming
[46:29] salty they may not even step they don't
[46:31] even want to have nothing to do with
[46:32] church you're the
[46:36] contact ain't that right so he says if
[46:39] you stayed home and just prayed for The
[46:41] Sinner never went to contact him there
[46:44] is very little that can be done right
[46:47] but you've got to pray then go see
[46:51] that's right go and do it see the
[46:56] projecting of this love another place he
[46:59] says see we are Pentecostal or are we
[47:02] the next thing if we are Pentecostals
[47:05] let's be Pentecostal If the message is
[47:07] right get in it if it isn't get out of
[47:11] it and find where is right see sure if
[47:14] God be God serve him but but you can't
[47:17] serve God and Mammon at the same time
[47:19] you can't serve God and man at the same
[47:21] time you can't serve God and yourself at
[47:23] the same time ain't that right he said
[47:26] see so let's serve God be convinced and
[47:30] then you'll be concerned now then the
[47:33] church will really go to Growing cuz
[47:36] you'll go out and get everybody you can
[47:39] to bring them in but as long as you just
[47:42] go around and say well that's the
[47:44] preacher's job it isn't the preacher's
[47:46] job it's everyone's job it's everybody's
[47:50] job see every born again Christian has
[47:54] that same spirit in and them ain't that
[47:58] right now 1 Timothy
[48:01] 4:16 uh I did not give them the
[48:04] scriptures uh there so uh but 1
[48:08] Corinthians uh or 1 Timothy 4 and6 Paul
[48:12] says take heed unto thyself and unto the
[48:15] doctrine continue in them everybody say
[48:19] continue continue in them for in doing
[48:23] this see Thou shalt both save thyself
[48:27] and them that hear thee Lord ain't that
[48:32] right see now uh and I I won't take long
[48:36] but you know in in in in talking to
[48:39] people sometimes we we can get jokey or
[48:43] or we can give someone else that don't
[48:45] believe what we believe uh you know a
[48:47] hard time in in what they believe and
[48:51] and and and sometimes we can make them
[48:54] feel foolish for believing what they
[48:56] believe and and um you know you you
[49:00] believe in a pope you know or you
[49:02] believe in a you know fat Idol you know
[49:05] to be your God or or whatever you know
[49:08] and and and and what what you know and
[49:12] and really what we're trying to do is
[49:14] make them think they're crazy for what
[49:16] they're believing you know cuz ours is
[49:19] right but that's not the way to win
[49:21] souls you understand what I'm saying see
[49:24] you you you don't have to make fun of a
[49:26] person for the way he believes to win
[49:27] them over and and and the thing is is
[49:30] we've got to take these things serious
[49:32] we've got to take Soul winning serious
[49:34] we got to take a man's Soul be because
[49:36] listen Church they may never go to
[49:39] church in their life we may be the only
[49:41] contact they have with
[49:43] God we we may be the only one the only
[49:47] channel that they will ever have and
[49:50] ever know in order to know a living God
[49:55] hello see and and and so then uh uh uh
[49:59] uh you don't have to make fun of a
[50:01] person's religion you don't have to put
[50:03] them down for what they believe just be
[50:07] salty be so salty that then they will
[50:11] look at you and realize that you've got
[50:14] something that they don't have you've
[50:17] got something that they need you will
[50:19] actually make them understand that their
[50:22] religion is
[50:23] dead can you say Amen see so the then
[50:27] then you know we we spoke of influence
[50:29] this morning and and in 1963 brother
[50:32] Braham said this he said we need
[50:34] influential Christians can you say that
[50:37] with me we need influential
[50:39] Christians now how are they going to be
[50:41] influenced he says influential
[50:43] Christians influenced by the word of God
[50:47] Amen that's what we need we don't need
[50:50] influential people that are influenced
[50:52] by money or by Prestige or by uh Creeds
[50:57] or whatever we need influential
[51:00] Christians who are influenced by the
[51:02] word of God called men or women for an
[51:06] influence to the elected church for the
[51:08] last days now as as we know we don't
[51:11] know who the elect is uh be nice if God
[51:14] would show us you know and uh say no
[51:17] that's an elect and that's elect go for
[51:19] it you know but that's not true we we
[51:21] work among people of all sorts and and
[51:24] we don't know who's the elect and it's
[51:26] really not up for us to know the elect
[51:28] we just go out and try to be we're
[51:30] trying to get the elect in and the only
[51:33] way that we can is is to be
[51:36] influential can you say Amen now so so
[51:40] he says see he said now that that is
[51:42] what we need see is influential
[51:45] Christians influenced by the word amen
[51:48] uh uh for an influence to the elected
[51:51] church for the last days he said now God
[51:53] give it to us and they will be here
[51:56] they're going to be and I believe that's
[51:58] where we come in God's got influential
[52:02] Christians God didn't call you amen uh
[52:06] uh for denominations God didn't call you
[52:09] amen for anything else but he brought
[52:11] you into the greatest message in the
[52:14] world of all ages and he's put it at
[52:18] your feet to affect you this message is
[52:22] affecting us that we can go out in the
[52:25] world and be
[52:27] influence just like the word affected us
[52:30] now we become an effect to the world can
[52:32] you say man why because that's the only
[52:34] thing that's going to get the
[52:36] elect that's the only thing can you say
[52:38] Amen so Matthew 5:13 Jesus said you are
[52:42] the salt of the earth but if the salt
[52:44] has lost its Savor wherewith shall it be
[52:48] salted it is henceforth good for nothing
[52:50] but to be cast out and be trodden under
[52:52] the foot of men ain't that right now so
[52:55] influence is a great thing this is what
[52:58] God established his church for for them
[53:01] to be to reflect light and for them to
[53:05] be salty amen that's right amen see so
[53:09] so influence in other words we are to
[53:11] have influence see and it's not by great
[53:14] numbers that we have
[53:17] influence can you say Amen it's not by
[53:20] great talent that we have influence it's
[53:23] it's brother Bram said it's by the great
[53:25] God that we
[53:27] represent that's the only influence that
[53:29] we need you you don't have to have have
[53:32] proceeds to have this kind of influence
[53:35] you you don't have to have position in
[53:37] the government or or or to be upper
[53:40] class to have this kind of influence a
[53:43] person that don't even know their ABCs
[53:44] can have that same this kind of
[53:46] influence can you say Amen see and so
[53:50] he's living his life through us that's
[53:52] the influence he's living his life
[53:56] through through us that's why Paul would
[53:58] say I Die daily the life that I now you
[54:01] know uh uh I I've been crucified with
[54:04] Christ and now the life that I now live
[54:06] I live by the faith of Jesus Christ it's
[54:08] a total different life can you say Amen
[54:11] see so so he's living his life through
[54:14] us and that's what will influence others
[54:17] that's that's the kind of influence that
[54:19] we want is he living his life through
[54:23] us God help us ain't that right now a
[54:28] question was asked brother brandham uh
[54:30] by a sister brother brandham I have
[54:32] accepted God's message of today and also
[54:35] our son and we both have been baptized
[54:37] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ my
[54:39] husband hasn't accepted the message is
[54:41] fighting this message and he has
[54:43] influenced our son and has taken him to
[54:45] a Methodist Church he wants me to go uh
[54:48] with him to church when we are not in
[54:50] service here at the Tabernacle would it
[54:52] be all right for me to go with him or
[54:54] would it be better to stay out of that
[54:55] denomination so well uh dear sister now
[54:59] she never signed her name but perhaps
[55:00] you're listening to your question um he
[55:03] says uh go with your husband but don't
[55:06] be partakers of what they're doing now
[55:08] notice what what this notice this now go
[55:12] with your husband don't but don't be
[55:14] partakers of what they're doing you're
[55:16] supposed to love your husband and love
[55:18] is what does it are you with me love is
[55:23] what does it you be real s salty right
[55:27] don't condemn him don't make him look
[55:30] like he's an idiot be real
[55:33] salty and you say Amen he'll get thirsty
[55:37] if there's anything in him now don't
[55:40] join their denomination stay away from
[55:43] that Den he you know he said stay away
[55:45] from that denomination so don't join it
[55:48] go to it see he says if you can't get a
[55:51] whole loaf get a half can't get a half
[55:54] just get a slice but that's the way
[55:56] you'll win your husband by doing that
[56:00] don't be arrogant then he'll know he's
[56:03] got just as much as you
[56:06] have can you say Amen see so us having
[56:10] influence is to let the people know
[56:12] we've got something that they
[56:15] need on now can you say Amen if the sin
[56:19] looks at it and says well I got the same
[56:20] thing they got my church has got the
[56:22] same thing they got why would I want
[56:24] them well you've lost your in
[56:27] uence ain't that right see and and so so
[56:31] here it is but when you can show
[56:33] something that you have that he don't
[56:36] have well that will make him thirsty to
[56:39] be like
[56:41] you then you don't have to be dogmatic
[56:44] right then you don't have to force
[56:46] people well you know I can't believe you
[56:49] got a TV I ain't got one no just be so
[56:54] salty amen that's good the Lord and you
[56:57] say
[56:58] Amen see well well if I live if we say
[57:02] that God sent a prophet they well of
[57:04] course they're all going to call us an
[57:05] Ault you know Mormons believe that God
[57:08] sent a prophet there's a lot of people
[57:10] believe in prophets you some of you
[57:13] young people may not even remember about
[57:14] David Kesh you know but there was David
[57:17] Kesh in Waco and he had he you know how
[57:20] read up on him and what he was you
[57:22] realize that they believed in Malachi 4
[57:24] just the same they taught Mal there he
[57:28] that and there's a teaching still down
[57:29] there actually brother Andrew he went
[57:31] down there to look at the uh at at the
[57:34] the site and uh there there's a man that
[57:37] David Kesh uh that goes to the church
[57:41] that David Kesh come out of and and he
[57:45] told him Malachi 4 believes in it da d d
[57:48] d da totally different than what we
[57:49] believe but they're they believe in a
[57:51] prophet well David cres took it further
[57:54] than that he thought he was the to open
[57:56] the Seven Seals and he thought he was
[57:59] the Jesus Christ and he so he exalted so
[58:02] the pastor kicked him out well he takes
[58:04] that whole following you understand what
[58:06] I'm saying see so but but but so there
[58:09] there's people that believe in prophets
[58:11] there's people that believe what but
[58:12] there's something that's got to be
[58:14] deeper than just a combat of
[58:17] knowledge combat of Doctrine can you say
[58:20] man and that is there's there's
[58:23] something that we have that the world
[58:25] don't have have and we've got to be
[58:28] influential amen we must not lose our
[58:30] influence that's right prise the Lord
[58:33] and you say Amen must not in lose our
[58:36] influence I thought of how how people
[58:38] have been turned off this message by by
[58:40] all kinds of sing all kinds of things in
[58:43] in in in the way of of uh crazy
[58:46] doctrines and crazy actions and and all
[58:50] kinds of nonsense but you know what
[58:53] there's one thing that I believe that
[58:55] can help our young people that have
[58:57] turned away from this message amen and
[58:59] and and I I don't think it's any fault
[59:01] of theirs at all I I just think it's is
[59:04] because the message has been
[59:06] misrepresented so it's up to us to
[59:09] present the message right can you say
[59:12] Amen it ain't for us to to fault them
[59:15] it's not for us to condemn them it's
[59:18] actually we it it ought to put a burden
[59:20] and a concern on us to say God let me be
[59:23] so influential because we know that this
[59:26] message is right how many believes this
[59:28] message is Right amen I I just believe
[59:30] this message is right I believe it's the
[59:32] highest thing that you'll ever have in
[59:34] the form of the word of God and in the
[59:37] spirit of God can you say amen amen is
[59:40] this message now what we want is to be
[59:42] salty with this message let's be salty
[59:46] let's let's not lose our our influence
[59:49] let's not lose oh yeah you can quote
[59:51] scripture you can quote message all you
[59:53] want to amen but if you have no
[59:55] influence it does us no
[59:58] good can you say Amen see show that
[1:00:03] you've got something that he don't have
[1:00:05] and that'll make him thirsty to be like
[1:00:07] you see another place if the salt has
[1:00:10] lost its safer it is s forth good for
[1:00:12] nothing cast out tro under the foot of
[1:00:15] men see we must never forget that we are
[1:00:19] salt and if the salt loses its strength
[1:00:23] its power to contact see see the salt
[1:00:26] can only save as it
[1:00:29] contacts and if it loses its power of
[1:00:32] contact then it is no more salt but
[1:00:36] sand
[1:00:38] amen so what is the difference between
[1:00:40] salt and sand
[1:00:42] contact don't lose the power of
[1:00:46] contact yes
[1:00:49] sir
[1:00:54] Amen brother brandom another Place said
[1:00:56] when we lose our influence as a father
[1:00:58] as a mother as a Christian as a
[1:01:00] businessman as a minister when we lose
[1:01:02] our influence with people he said now we
[1:01:05] can be very popular in the in the line
[1:01:07] of the world and go along with the world
[1:01:10] and a lot of popular people in that way
[1:01:14] but I
[1:01:15] mean as what we
[1:01:18] represent we represent
[1:01:21] Christ amen ain't that right see see you
[1:01:25] you can have such such a personality
[1:01:26] that people just draw to you and still
[1:01:30] be the wrong
[1:01:32] influence can you say am man there's a
[1:01:34] lot of men that are born leaders women
[1:01:36] that are born leaders they they just got
[1:01:38] that way about them and the people flock
[1:01:41] to
[1:01:42] them but that's not what we're talking
[1:01:45] about we're here to represent
[1:01:48] Christ that's the influence that we need
[1:01:52] and when we lose our influence as that
[1:01:56] as standing out how can we blend in with
[1:01:59] the day when God is so against the day
[1:02:03] so so God does not want us blending in
[1:02:06] with the
[1:02:08] day can you say
[1:02:11] Amen the power of darkness is the thing
[1:02:13] that is making the day what it is
[1:02:17] everything that you're seeing today in
[1:02:19] the world is is is it's it's operating
[1:02:22] under the power of
[1:02:23] Darkness can you say man so we are the
[1:02:26] salt of the earth I I I pray it's a help
[1:02:30] to you I it's just something that's been
[1:02:32] on my heart I we we are the salt of the
[1:02:35] earth how how you are needed how how we
[1:02:38] are needed I don't care what what kind
[1:02:41] whether what what what position you hold
[1:02:43] I don't care your age I don't I don't
[1:02:45] care your your status in life if you've
[1:02:48] got the influence of Jesus Christ if if
[1:02:51] you're representing his life God has
[1:02:54] called you for contact
[1:02:57] right can you say Amen you you you're
[1:02:59] the you know as the prophet said you're
[1:03:01] the only Bible that a lot of folks will
[1:03:03] ever read there's some that'll never
[1:03:05] pick up this Bible but you're the only
[1:03:06] Bible that they'll read some of them
[1:03:08] will never understand God and never will
[1:03:10] walk into a church but you're the church
[1:03:13] that people will see ain't that right
[1:03:16] see so you you you are one because you
[1:03:19] are a dedicated
[1:03:22] Channel and uh you know when when in
[1:03:25] electrical you know when you're hooking
[1:03:27] up the uh stove or you're hooking up the
[1:03:30] refrigerator or whatever they they you
[1:03:33] know you it's only supposed to be
[1:03:35] operating off of one circuit it's a it's
[1:03:39] it's what we would call a dedicated
[1:03:40] circuit now uh if you you can on other
[1:03:44] lines you can run different things on it
[1:03:47] um and and it all be off of one circuit
[1:03:49] one breaker but when it comes to
[1:03:51] something like a a stove or whatever
[1:03:53] it's a dedicated circuit
[1:03:56] that that only just only that that uh
[1:04:00] machine is on that one circuit and
[1:04:03] that's it see well I think that's the
[1:04:06] way we ought God has called us to be is
[1:04:08] dedicated channels right can you say man
[1:04:12] dedicated Channel see and so we are the
[1:04:15] salt of the earth now in the natural
[1:04:18] Church the salt has lost its Savor and
[1:04:21] brother Brown said see it's lost its
[1:04:23] sweetness it's lost its love it's lost
[1:04:26] its influence to bring Sinners to Christ
[1:04:29] now they're bringing Sinners to the
[1:04:30] church and that's that's what the
[1:04:32] prophet talked about I'm afraid we're
[1:04:34] getting people to to church and not to
[1:04:36] Christ they're bringing them to their
[1:04:38] Doctrine they're bringing them to their
[1:04:39] denomination they're bringing them to
[1:04:41] their Creeds they're bringing them to a
[1:04:42] lot of
[1:04:43] places but that's not the point right
[1:04:47] they've lost their ability to bring the
[1:04:50] sinner to Jesus Christ that's right amen
[1:04:54] amen can you say Amen so they're just
[1:04:56] taking in a bunch of members and
[1:04:58] baptized them and then let them live in
[1:05:00] the world and their influence the
[1:05:02] influence of the world the influence of
[1:05:04] the sinner has corrupted the
[1:05:07] church right ain't that right yeah yes
[1:05:10] sir
[1:05:12] now what is the meaning of being a
[1:05:14] Christian uh brother brandham says it
[1:05:16] this way because you know we say well
[1:05:18] I'm a
[1:05:19] Christian and a lot of times it's just
[1:05:21] thrown around are you a Christian yeah
[1:05:23] yeah I'm a Christian I believe in the
[1:05:24] Lord I go go to church and this and this
[1:05:27] so brother Brown goes through a a list
[1:05:29] of it people think that you know being a
[1:05:32] Christian is having an image of of some
[1:05:35] image of Christ hanging on the wall or
[1:05:38] the mirror or something and um or being
[1:05:42] a Christian is is you know feeding the
[1:05:45] poor doing doing good to your neighbor
[1:05:47] and being a good citizen in town and and
[1:05:50] everybody's got their idea even going to
[1:05:52] church being faithful doing duties and
[1:05:54] being involved and all these and and and
[1:05:57] and they seem to think that that's what
[1:05:58] makes a Christian but brother Ram says
[1:06:00] being an image of Christ makes you a
[1:06:03] Christian being an image of Christ makes
[1:06:06] you a Christian it's not what we do
[1:06:08] outwardly it's what happened inwardly
[1:06:11] that's made that makes us what we are
[1:06:13] then therefore if he is our image and we
[1:06:17] are in his likeness and members of his
[1:06:19] body we should be images like him right
[1:06:23] can you say Amen see then our lives
[1:06:27] should reflect the image of Christ not
[1:06:29] in our joining church or packing a
[1:06:32] crucifix or our emotions but it should
[1:06:35] be in the living presence of the Living
[1:06:39] God that's reflected through our
[1:06:42] lives the living presence of the Living
[1:06:46] God must be
[1:06:49] reflected Christian means Christlike
[1:06:52] amen so we we find that you know there's
[1:06:56] there's what they call you know when
[1:06:58] when they were digging for gold in the
[1:07:01] gold rush they they found that there's a
[1:07:05] rock or whatever called pyite I guess is
[1:07:07] what it called and and they called it
[1:07:09] fo's gold because it looked like
[1:07:12] gold and uh it fooled many many people
[1:07:15] they thought they had gold and and and
[1:07:17] actually it was it was fo's gold it
[1:07:19] really wasn't gold and so how they found
[1:07:22] that the difference whether it was pyite
[1:07:25] or or or real gold is that the
[1:07:28] goldsmiths and and even the Indians they
[1:07:32] did it and but they would take that that
[1:07:35] piece and they would beat it and when
[1:07:38] they just keep beating it and keep
[1:07:39] beating it and keep beating it until
[1:07:42] they got down to the real gold they got
[1:07:44] all that flaky stuff out of there and
[1:07:48] and and and how he knew it was real and
[1:07:50] it got down to real substance is that
[1:07:52] the beater of this piece could see his
[1:07:56] reflection in it he could see his image
[1:07:59] he could see his reflection and brother
[1:08:01] Bram says when the holy spirit of God
[1:08:03] begins to beat on us with the gospel
[1:08:05] Hammer until all the things of the world
[1:08:08] is beaten out and we can reflect the
[1:08:10] image of the Lord Jesus Christ he said
[1:08:12] that's then I believe we become
[1:08:15] Christians can you say Amen too much
[1:08:19] flake so God beats us and he beats us
[1:08:23] and he beats us until when he looks he
[1:08:25] sees his own image reflected he sees his
[1:08:27] own character ain't that right so he
[1:08:30] says see we we don't have to reflect the
[1:08:33] physical image of Christ to have the
[1:08:36] same stat be the same of the same
[1:08:37] stature that he was and long hair and
[1:08:39] the beard and and all these things that
[1:08:41] he had back then we're in a different
[1:08:43] day he said but we must in our souls
[1:08:47] everybody say in our souls we must in
[1:08:49] our souls reflect his Spirit image and
[1:08:53] his manner of life life so God has to
[1:08:58] get all that make belief away from us
[1:09:01] and boy does he do it right sends us
[1:09:03] through the test sends us through the
[1:09:05] trials gets all that selfishness out of
[1:09:08] us all the unbelief and and all of that
[1:09:11] till he gets down to the real thing and
[1:09:15] then we begin to Bear His
[1:09:17] Image oh aren't you glad for that now
[1:09:21] notice what kind of an image was he if
[1:09:25] if we're wanting to reflect him if we're
[1:09:27] wanting to Bear His Image he's after
[1:09:30] something right right he's after
[1:09:33] something in in that image that's why he
[1:09:36] send you through the trials it ain't to
[1:09:38] it ain't it ain't to throw you away it
[1:09:39] ain't because he hates you and and
[1:09:41] doesn't like you and all that he's after
[1:09:43] his
[1:09:44] image that's right praise the Lord so
[1:09:47] what kind of an
[1:09:49] image brother Bri says he came not to be
[1:09:51] some some great somebody yet he was but
[1:09:55] he came as a
[1:09:58] servant he came not to be minister to
[1:10:00] but to minister he said our text tonight
[1:10:03] reflects what he was that's what makes
[1:10:06] him great in my es estimation yet being
[1:10:10] the very God of Eternity the very God
[1:10:12] who created the heavens and earth and
[1:10:14] when he came here he took the lowest
[1:10:17] position the most dis uh
[1:10:20] undesirable job that anybody could have
[1:10:23] and that was a foot foot wash flunky can
[1:10:27] you say Amen see and so that's that's
[1:10:30] the image that's the image see uh that
[1:10:34] he's wanting to see in
[1:10:36] US is when we can humble ourselves amen
[1:10:41] when we're not trying to be something
[1:10:42] great we're not trying to make a name
[1:10:44] for ourselves yes sir but we can
[1:10:47] actually
[1:10:49] serve through
[1:10:51] humility we can actually do what we can
[1:10:54] do through humility trying to redeem
[1:10:57] that man trying to redeem that woman
[1:11:00] trying to redeem that boy or girl can
[1:11:02] you sayen see so now what a difference
[1:11:07] it is of the so-called Christian today
[1:11:10] of what he's reflecting you know because
[1:11:13] he that so-called Christian wants to be
[1:11:16] served he begins to think he is somebody
[1:11:19] but Jesus never came to be ministered to
[1:11:22] he never came to look and say see what I
[1:11:25] am am no he he took the lowest he took
[1:11:29] the lowest can you say Amen right and
[1:11:31] then he turns around and says and let
[1:11:34] him that will be the greatest that's the
[1:11:37] greatest among you be the servant of all
[1:11:42] ain't that right right so brother Bram
[1:11:44] says the Modern Trend of Christianity is
[1:11:46] I'm somebody and you're
[1:11:48] nothing he said oh that's wrong it
[1:11:51] should not be that way we are trying to
[1:11:53] reflect Christianity in the wrong way
[1:11:55] God doesn't want us to do that can you
[1:11:57] sayen he said see that doesn't act like
[1:12:01] Jesus that doesn't reflect his love his
[1:12:04] personality he came to the lowest to the
[1:12:07] street Harlot to the beggar to the bum
[1:12:10] and got right down in the dust with them
[1:12:13] that's the Christian Life that's the way
[1:12:17] it should be to reflect him in that way
[1:12:21] can you say Amen Lord you love him amen
[1:12:26] so then he says if Christ Still Remains
[1:12:29] Christ if his spirit is still the holy
[1:12:31] spirit that was in him and it's still in
[1:12:34] you if it's in you it'll make you take
[1:12:37] that position too Lord can you say
[1:12:42] amen he said see today we try to think
[1:12:45] that we're different how far it is from
[1:12:47] his prayer when he prayed that this
[1:12:50] would all men know that we were his
[1:12:53] disciples when we have love one for
[1:12:54] another
[1:12:56] and instead of that we fuss at one
[1:12:57] another we despise one another because
[1:13:00] we don't agree upon certain things we go
[1:13:03] out and accuse each other see and yet
[1:13:06] claim to be Christians I know people who
[1:13:08] claim to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:09] as guilty of such things going out and
[1:13:12] really saying evil things about other
[1:13:14] Christians when they not when they ought
[1:13:15] not to be uh to do those things can you
[1:13:18] say Amen brother Braham said when you do
[1:13:21] that he said' then we're not Christians
[1:13:24] yet because it's not what we confess to
[1:13:27] be but it's actually what we possess
[1:13:31] that we actually possess it's something
[1:13:33] that we truly have within us can you say
[1:13:38] Amen so he says we cannot be a Christian
[1:13:40] and not love all people ain't that right
[1:13:44] now listen we might disagree with people
[1:13:46] and we may even come to bitterly
[1:13:50] disagree with
[1:13:52] them but we still love them amen yeah
[1:13:55] why that we might redeem that
[1:13:58] man that's the
[1:14:01] focus that we might bring them back into
[1:14:04] line hello that's right amen may God
[1:14:08] help us all
[1:14:10] amen Jesus never told the Pharisees I
[1:14:13] think I told you today but he never told
[1:14:16] the Pharisees you know well you know
[1:14:18] because you are a
[1:14:20] Pharisee you're not in it you're not
[1:14:22] going to make it you're just going to
[1:14:24] hell there's just no chance all that
[1:14:27] brother B said Jesus never told them
[1:14:29] Pharisees because they are a Pharisee
[1:14:31] that you're lost you're you're no good
[1:14:34] no brother brah said he went to them and
[1:14:37] he ministered to them and he helped them
[1:14:39] he done every thing he could to help
[1:14:43] them and I truly believe Jesus
[1:14:47] did and what how did he help them by
[1:14:50] saying oh you're okay no no he didn't he
[1:14:54] he whipped them
[1:14:56] right I
[1:14:58] mean brother brand said you you compare
[1:15:00] the fruits of the spirit compared Jesus
[1:15:02] and the old priest and see which one had
[1:15:05] the had the the best display the
[1:15:07] greatest display of the fruits of the
[1:15:08] spirit it sure wasn't in
[1:15:12] Jesus because here he was got in a whip
[1:15:14] and he beat him out of the temple
[1:15:16] whipped him out of the temple amen
[1:15:17] through anger ain't that right he called
[1:15:21] them all different he called them Devils
[1:15:24] he called them what
[1:15:25] Snakes in the Grass he called them
[1:15:27] whatever but what was he trying to do
[1:15:30] he's trying to show them the error of
[1:15:31] their way right he could have just
[1:15:34] walked among them he he could have just
[1:15:35] been classy guy he could have just had
[1:15:38] healing campaigns he could have and
[1:15:40] never never showing light to them never
[1:15:43] showing the error of their way you
[1:15:45] understand what I'm saying and yet
[1:15:47] through it all it was by Divine
[1:15:50] love CU he didn't come just to feed the
[1:15:53] poor he didn't come just to
[1:15:55] uh be the physician to the sick he come
[1:15:58] to redeem
[1:16:01] them you're not going to redeem everyone
[1:16:03] you're not going to help everybody
[1:16:05] there's some people that ain't even
[1:16:06] going to be influenced by what you say
[1:16:09] or what you do but that who cares right
[1:16:12] we've got to show love anyways the Lord
[1:16:15] can you say Amen Lord you love the Lord
[1:16:18] amen
[1:16:21] amen if there's ever a time that we need
[1:16:24] to project Christ and the spirit of God
[1:16:26] it is
[1:16:28] now there's ever a
[1:16:30] time you know we do not win people over
[1:16:34] by knowledge we do not win people over
[1:16:36] by our education smarts and all that we
[1:16:39] win people over by the spirit of God
[1:16:42] Amen may he have total preeminence in US
[1:16:47] amen may we do you realize you're the
[1:16:49] only people and I'm talking about bride
[1:16:52] people message people that have the
[1:16:56] access to
[1:16:59] light
[1:17:01] shining that you could live in the
[1:17:03] presence of the
[1:17:05] sun amen and that that light is so quick
