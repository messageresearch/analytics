[32:58] burning all of
[33:00] our
[33:03] human ideas and things out of our lives
[33:06] and we certainly know that he's here to

[33:09] amen amen and the musicians can be
[33:12] dismissed it's good to be here in the
[33:15] house of the Lord and sister Bonnie it's
[33:17] really good to have you this evening and
[33:19] amen and um appreciate sister Bonnie and
[33:24] uh just all of God's people and
[33:28] uh we want to I heard brother Branson is
[33:31] sick and um uh I think there saying it's
[33:35] the flu or whatever so we want to pray
[33:37] for him and the Lord will just be with
[33:41] him as he's down there in Ohio and so
[33:45] they'll be traveling tonight or tomorrow
[33:47] I don't know which but want to keep him
[33:49] in our prayer amen if you have your
[33:52] Bibles we're going to turn to the book
[33:54] of uh Philippians first of all uh the
[33:57] second
[33:58] chapter the things that we speak on
[34:01] tonight is something that we all know
[34:06] but um we just wanted to go uh through
[34:10] it again and because I think it's very
[34:13] essensual and so but uh the book of
[34:18] Philippians uh chapter
[34:21] 2 and verse
[34:25] five and it's says let this mind be in
[34:29] you can you say that with me let this
[34:31] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[34:37] Jesus so no other mind but his
[34:40] mind then if you'll turn with me to 1
[34:44] Corinthians the 2
[34:46] chapter 1 Corinthians the 2
[34:51] chapter amen and
[34:55] um
[34:59] I believe the 16th
[35:01] verse but it says for who hath known the
[35:04] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[35:08] him but we everybody say we have the
[35:12] mind of Christ amen let's just bow our
[35:17] heads our hearts to our
[35:20] maker
[35:21] father Lord as we come with Open Hearts
[35:27] truly the
[35:29] desire of our heart is that you would
[35:32] consume us Lord consume every selfish
[35:36] idea every selfish motive consume all
[35:40] the hum human part of us father that you
[35:44] could have complete
[35:46] control Lord that we wouldn't be a
[35:48] hindrance to you but that we would be
[35:51] yielded to you and I pray father that
[35:54] you would just anoint both speaker and
[35:56] hearer to tonight Lord I need you in a
[35:59] special way father and pray Lord that
[36:02] you would just um use my lips to speak
[36:06] to your people father that when we leave
[36:09] here we'd be better Christians Lord
[36:11] better equipped father we love you and
[36:15] we Just Surrender ourselves to you even
[36:18] now in Jesus Christ's name and the
[36:21] church says amen amen and amen you can
[36:25] have your seats
[36:27] and I guess my title tonight would be
[36:31] expressing the mind of
[36:34] Christ expressing the mind of Christ and
[36:37] we are in a spiritual
[36:40] warfare I think most of us would know
[36:44] that and if you're trying to serve the
[36:47] Lord with all of your heart it becomes
[36:50] more I guess an awareness of just how
[36:54] great this this Warfare is
[36:57] is we all know that we're fighting an
[37:00] enemy that is so far stronger than than
[37:05] what we could even uh fathom as the uh
[37:09] Prophet said we're no match for the
[37:12] devil and and that is
[37:14] true um we see people overcome
[37:18] constantly by this enemy uh the people
[37:23] that once had strong faith that once had
[37:26] joy peace that once had just
[37:31] contentment um you see people that have
[37:35] just somehow they've been overcome by
[37:38] this by this enemy to where maybe they
[37:41] still go to church but it's just um it's
[37:44] just ritual it's just um survival
[37:48] surviving if you want to call it that
[37:50] and and um but but it's it's because
[37:55] that Satan is constantly warning Waring
[37:57] warning warning but I I truly believe
[38:00] that our experience with God can be
[38:03] greater than what it was when we first
[38:06] gave our heart to the Lord it can be
[38:08] more real it can be more uh um vibrant
[38:14] and uh but but we've got to know how to
[38:17] to to face the enemy to fight the and to
[38:20] overcome him and uh uh this this battles
[38:25] that we go through there is no natural
[38:29] weapon that can defeat the enemy it's
[38:31] just it's
[38:33] impossible uh you know and and we tend
[38:36] to to lean to the Natural uh such as if
[38:40] someone you know gives us a chew and out
[38:42] we just automatically react in a natural
[38:45] way that is just more common to to
[38:49] naturally to act and that is chewing
[38:51] them out or um uh you know again
[38:55] building this wall of offense and things
[38:58] or if the doctor says well you know
[39:00] there's just no hope or we start feeling
[39:02] the pain and not feeling good it's just
[39:05] automatically natural to start um uh you
[39:10] know looking at the natural things and
[39:12] well the doctor says there's no hope so
[39:14] I guess there's none or if if you know I
[39:17] feel sick so I am sick and I'm hurting
[39:20] and so therefore you know and I just
[39:22] don't know what's going to become of me
[39:23] and and and and it's just it's just that
[39:26] way and and and the world is becoming
[39:29] more negative no matter how we we have
[39:33] positive speaking as far as uh you know
[39:36] um I'm trying to think of the name of a
[39:39] gentleman that uh we'd hear on the radio
[39:41] a lot when I was a boy but uh he was a
[39:44] positive speaker just always speaking
[39:47] positive things and and yet uh uh it
[39:51] just seems like it's not the enemy is
[39:54] just still having a hey day
[39:57] but I don't believe that the church is
[39:59] meant to succumb to this enemy I I I
[40:02] believe that we are victorious in Christ
[40:06] and so what makes us different and and
[40:09] I'm talking to the elect and I trust all
[40:11] of us here are the elect Sons and
[40:13] Daughters of God but what what makes us
[40:17] different well the prophet said we we
[40:19] first were created for the purpose of
[40:23] controlling controlling not being
[40:25] controlled
[40:26] but the purpose of controlling and
[40:29] ruling and to praise God and to live for
[40:33] him so that's that's what we were made
[40:36] for is to control for the purpose of
[40:39] controlling to rule and to praise God
[40:43] and to live for him and what we are is
[40:47] our channels we're we're a channel and I
[40:51] looked up the word channel uh this
[40:53] afternoon and it's a a passage or a
[40:56] place of passing or
[40:59] flowing that through which anything
[41:02] passes it means a means a passing
[41:05] conveying or transmitting and I thought
[41:09] well that's that's pretty powerful that
[41:11] we we are channels which the
[41:15] Unseen can make itself known through us
[41:20] and our enemy is
[41:22] unseen our God is unseen right and yet
[41:27] we are the
[41:28] channels um we we're finding that people
[41:31] are more of a channel for the devil than
[41:34] they are God and and God uh Satan is
[41:38] able to manifest himself through them in
[41:41] in all kinds of ways and in all kinds of
[41:45] levels and and so anyone that can look
[41:49] at the sin and the muck and I don't care
[41:51] if it's in the rim of of religion
[41:54] Society culture science
[41:57] um uh Church whatever you you can say
[42:00] that there's something besides the
[42:02] humanity that is causing humans to act
[42:05] the way they are no no natural human
[42:08] would act evil in in that way and and
[42:11] these things well it's it's because they
[42:13] become uh a channel for uh Satan to make
[42:18] himself known and visible but we're not
[42:21] to be channels for the
[42:23] devil uh if if uh we are called the for
[42:28] to be channels that God can work through
[42:31] you see God wants to display his power
[42:35] and his authority through us you believe
[42:38] that amen we we say that God is a living
[42:41] God and I believe he is a living God we
[42:44] say that God is all powerful and that he
[42:47] reigns and and that nothing can defeat
[42:50] him that nothing can Dethrone him we we
[42:55] we say that that there's nothing greater
[42:57] than God and and and truly we we believe
[43:01] that how many believes that there
[43:03] there's nothing greater than God well
[43:05] then God chose you to think of that God
[43:08] chose you to show that he's all powerful
[43:11] God chose you as the channel to to
[43:15] reflect that that to let the people know
[43:18] that he is all powerful that he is not
[43:20] defeated and can never be defeated ain't
[43:22] that right see so so God wants to
[43:25] display him himself through us so when
[43:28] he comes through us we're just a channel
[43:30] we do not we do not make him weaker we
[43:33] do not change him in any form or fashion
[43:37] he is what he is when he comes and he
[43:40] works through us we're just the channel
[43:43] and and we know that he is the word and
[43:47] his word is spirit and life ain't that
[43:50] right so then if if he's going to have
[43:53] his way in us and we're just the channel
[43:56] for him then we must be a channel for
[43:59] his word amen for he is the word ain't
[44:02] that right you cannot separate the word
[44:05] from God you cannot separate God from
[44:07] the word to believe the word is to
[44:09] believe God to accept God is to accept
[44:12] the word ain't that right for God to
[44:14] flow through you is for God's word to
[44:18] flow through you see so then we we look
[44:22] and and I think you know uh God for the
[44:25] message of the hour to to to give us the
[44:28] Insight of things and and but but
[44:31] brother brandham he he goes uh and he
[44:34] talks about what it was before the word
[44:37] came what was it before the word and he
[44:41] says you know it was a thought first
[44:43] ain't that right amen so a word is a
[44:47] thought expressed and he brings that to
[44:49] our attention quite a bit a word is a
[44:52] thought expressed so God created the
[44:55] word World by his word ain't that right
[44:59] he spoke it let there be and there was
[45:01] but before he's created the world by his
[45:05] word he created the world by his
[45:09] thoughts he created the world by his
[45:12] thoughts first of all ain't that right
[45:15] God thought it first and then he spoke
[45:18] it into existence and then the word
[45:22] became
[45:23] materialized there is an order for that
[45:25] it comes as a thought then a word uh uh
[45:29] expressing the thought and then becomes
[45:32] material anytime that God's word is
[45:35] spoken it will materialize it must it
[45:39] it's got to there is no time there is no
[45:42] space there is there is nothing that
[45:45] will hinder the word of God from coming
[45:47] to pass if it is the word of God ain't
[45:50] that right see so we want that we want
[45:53] to be the channel That God's word can be
[45:57] uh uh flow through we talk about
[46:00] speaking the word of God and uh uh uh
[46:04] but but the the the but God's got a law
[46:07] and Matthew 21:21 and there's many other
[46:10] scriptures but it says Jesus answered
[46:13] and said unto them verily I say unto you
[46:15] if you have faith so say that with me if
[46:20] say that again if you have faith if you
[46:25] have faith and doubt not ain't that
[46:29] right you shall not only do this which
[46:32] was done to the Fig Tree and remember
[46:34] the conversation is that he went and and
[46:38] and he he wanted to find fruit on the
[46:40] tree that there was no fruit and so he
[46:42] cursed the Fig Tree and then he moves on
[46:45] he just he didn't stay around to see if
[46:47] it'll happen he knew it was going to
[46:49] happen he spoke the word right and so he
[46:51] goes on up into Jerusalem I believe it
[46:54] was or or wherever it was and then that
[46:57] evening he comes back or the next day
[46:59] and they stop by that tree and the tree
[47:01] is withered up and the disciples now
[47:03] he's not the one that brought it up the
[47:05] disciples brought it up because they
[47:07] were amazed that that tree obeyed his
[47:10] word right what he said happened to that
[47:14] tree and he he wasn't like oh W guys did
[47:17] you have to see this I spoke it
[47:18] yesterday and it happened you know no no
[47:21] they were amazed uh uh and and and so
[47:24] now Jesus turns to them and says but if
[47:28] I say unto you if you have faith he's
[47:31] not working any kind of magic he's not
[47:34] giv them all kinds of things go to
[47:36] school and learn this and you've got to
[47:38] be this this this and that and have so
[47:40] many Bachelor degrees and all that if
[47:42] you have faith and doubt not you shall
[47:47] not only do this which is done to the
[47:49] victory but also if you say unto this
[47:52] mountain be thou removed ain't that
[47:55] right who's saying it you are saying it
[47:58] ain't that right if you say to this
[48:00] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[48:03] cast into the sea it might be done I
[48:06] think it could no it shall be done now
[48:10] he is just as certain about that as he
[48:12] was certain that that fig tree was going
[48:14] to obey his own word he was so certain
[48:17] of that ain't that right true see see
[48:20] all things he goes on to say whatsoever
[48:22] you shall ask in prayer believeing
[48:25] everybody say believing you shall
[48:29] receive so then you must have faith you
[48:34] must believe so faith is not wondering
[48:38] if it's going to happen faith is not
[48:41] questioning if it's going to happen
[48:43] faith is not wishing for it to happen
[48:46] Faith knows it's going to happen amen
[48:50] Faith doesn't consider time Faith
[48:52] doesn't consider situation Faith doesn't
[48:55] consider situations amen is circumstance
[48:59] or whatever see so now what kind of
[49:02] Faith must we have well there's only one
[49:05] faith that that Jesus talks about when
[49:07] he says have faith in God the Greek is
[49:10] have the faith of God have the faith
[49:13] everybody say have the faith have the
[49:16] faith of God Amen God's Own Faith don't
[49:20] have the faith of the preacher don't
[49:21] have the faith of mom and dad don't have
[49:23] the faith of the deacon don't have faith
[49:25] of the hope don't have the faith of
[49:26] President Trump amen have the faith of
[49:29] God ain't that right there's no other
[49:32] Faith that's going to move mountains but
[49:33] have the faith of God ain't that right
[49:37] see so then as we know in the beginning
[49:40] God believed his own word God does not
[49:43] ask you to have faith in his word if
[49:46] he's not going to have faith in his word
[49:48] amen you're you're a chip off the old
[49:50] block ain't that right amen see so if
[49:53] you're a son and daughter of God then he
[49:55] would expect you to have his own faith
[49:58] if if you're part of him amen Peter says
[50:01] being made partakers of the divine
[50:03] nature well if we're partakers of the
[50:06] divine nature then we should be
[50:08] partakers of his Divine peace of his
[50:11] Divine Joy of his it's it's it's a joy
[50:14] it's a peace it's a faith it's a
[50:16] contentment that surpasses anything that
[50:19] Humanity ever can tap into it's a divine
[50:23] nature ain't that right so he tells us
[50:26] the faith that we must have is the faith
[50:29] of God he believed his own word that's
[50:33] what caused him to speak it in the first
[50:36] place he would have never said let there
[50:39] be light if he did not believe that his
[50:41] word would produce it ain't that right
[50:44] but he believed his own word therefore
[50:47] he stepped on that invisible platform
[50:50] when there was nothing to show that
[50:52] there could be light there was nothing
[50:54] that could produce light except within
[50:57] himself and he spoke the creative word
[51:01] which is in you now he create he spoke
[51:05] the creative word Let There Be and there
[51:08] was but first of all he believed it
[51:11] ain't that right and what did he believe
[51:14] he believed his own word and what was
[51:16] his word they were thoughts in his mind
[51:19] he in his thinking he wanted he wanted
[51:22] light in his thinking he wanted a world
[51:25] in his thinking he wanted Sons and
[51:27] Daughters of God in his thinking he
[51:30] wanted redemption in his thinking he
[51:32] would provide a savior A Healer a way
[51:35] out in his thinking ain't that right and
[51:39] this whole Bible is nothing but God's
[51:41] thoughts Express of not only a messiah
[51:44] of a redeemer of a of a savior but also
[51:48] of you ain't that right yes sir and it's
[51:52] nothing about uh uh uh you being down
[51:54] and out it's nothing about Satan just
[51:57] trumping all over you and and stopping
[51:59] and destroying you and and and to where
[52:02] you're nothing but just in Ruins no it
[52:05] speaks of you as an overcomer as a
[52:07] Victorious a as a Son of God if if he
[52:11] reigns you Reign if if if if he triumphs
[52:16] you will Triumph if he has overcome you
[52:18] shall overcome if he did it you will do
[52:21] it can you sayen you're a part of him
[52:25] and he expects none
[52:27] less he expects no less amen you with me
[52:32] he expects no less that's right the Lord
[52:37] come on now so God believed his own word
[52:40] that's the faith of God so having the
[52:42] faith of God is God believing his own
[52:45] word in
[52:47] you not God believing his own word in
[52:50] heaven God now in you believing his own
[52:54] word am ain't that right so that kind of
[52:58] faith comes by having the mind of
[53:02] Christ and the prophet says then you can
[53:05] see it clear once you have the mind of
[53:08] Christ I and I I think this is important
[53:12] Once the mind of Christ comes to us the
[53:14] faith of God comes to us because we can
[53:17] see it clear now we can see Victory
[53:20] clear we can see healing clear we we can
[53:24] see that every promise of God that it
[53:27] belongs to us and we can see it clear
[53:30] we're not guessing at it we're not
[53:31] wondering at it it's we're not looking
[53:34] at it as as the donkey chasing the
[53:36] carrot all day long no no no we see it
[53:40] clearly as for you and I can you say
[53:42] Amen see so therefore by having the mind
[53:46] of Christ we're not looking at natural
[53:48] things we're not looking at the at at at
[53:51] at what this natural eye can can looks
[53:55] at that we're not we're not depending on
[53:57] anything of our feelings of our emotions
[53:59] of our Sensations everything can testify
[54:03] contrary but if we have the mind of
[54:06] Christ then we have the faith of God see
[54:09] just because you cannot just I'm
[54:11] speaking naturally now just because in
[54:13] the natural your back is against the
[54:14] wall you see no way out does not mean
[54:17] you are
[54:18] helpless it does not mean that that that
[54:21] that Satan's got you and now you're just
[54:23] a victim that is a flat
[54:26] if you're a part of God now God is giv
[54:29] you something greater than a president
[54:31] has something a power than than even
[54:35] angels have is you now have the mind of
[54:39] Christ the mind of Christ can you say
[54:41] Amen so so I I hope that is all right
[54:45] see then brother Brown said see when the
[54:48] mind of Christ is in the man it then
[54:50] becomes a
[54:52] faith then we speak it that's good can
[54:55] you say Amen why because we've we tapped
[54:58] into his thoughts we've tapped in it's
[55:01] not our thoughts it's not me trying to
[55:03] be a Christian it's not me thinking well
[55:05] I I just want to go to church and I just
[55:07] want to make it to heaven and I just oh
[55:09] no no no no you tapped into his mind
[55:13] it's his thoughts that sees you already
[55:15] there it's his thoughts that sees you
[55:18] saved you were saved before the
[55:20] foundation of the world you you were all
[55:22] you're already in the Rapture before the
[55:24] foundation of the world you you've
[55:26] already got a body that is waiting for
[55:28] you can you say Amen it's in the mind of
[55:30] God and then when you catch that Mind Of
[55:33] God Amen then it's not you just wishing
[55:37] it's now it's becoming a reality you
[55:39] caught the thoughts of
[55:41] God see then it becomes a faith not a
[55:45] wish not just a desire a
[55:48] faith then we speak it and it comes into
[55:52] existence he said the very same thing
[55:55] that God did in the beginning yes amen
[55:59] amen praise the Lord see it's as though
[56:02] God is speaking see himself and and he
[56:05] is he is speaking except he's using your
[56:09] body he's not done in a spirit form in
[56:12] the form of a pillar of fire as he did
[56:15] in the beginning amen there was no body
[56:18] uh human body then ain't that right he
[56:21] just spoke uh in it as as an invisible
[56:25] but but he was in that Pillar of Fire
[56:27] that theophany amen and he spoke from
[56:30] there let there be now he speaks in your
[56:38] body praise the Lord see so to have the
[56:41] mind of Christ is to think his thoughts
[56:44] see the prophet said it's a Channel of
[56:47] Christ that we have tap tapped
[56:50] into tapped into yes sir you know uh uh
[56:55] people tap into a lot of things yeah
[56:57] they do they can break into your email
[56:59] they can tap into your bank account they
[57:01] can tap into your phone conversations
[57:03] they can tap into and they're good at it
[57:05] you know and they know what know what
[57:07] you've been saying know what you've been
[57:09] conversing nobody you know they they
[57:11] know about you believe it or not
[57:13] sometimes you know you it's scary having
[57:15] them them phones you be You' be talking
[57:18] of a conversation and all of a sudden
[57:20] advertisement pops up of the very thing
[57:22] that you just talked about and you're
[57:24] like oh okay this is weird something's
[57:27] going
[57:29] on but to think of it you can tap into
[57:33] the mind of God to know what an eternal
[57:37] God's been thinking about for
[57:39] eternities and we have that ability to
[57:42] do so we are Sons and Daughters of God
[57:45] and he expects none
[57:48] less who have known the mind of God but
[57:51] we have his mind ain't that right see so
[57:55] now brother brandham said see it's a
[57:57] Channel of Christ that we have tapped
[58:00] into who Sons and Daughters of God he
[58:04] said it's the mind of Christ see that
[58:06] the human being has the privilege to
[58:09] enter in and know the mind of Christ
[58:12] Hallelujah my what a reality to dwell in
[58:16] the channel of Christ what a reality to
[58:20] think of it you could go through your
[58:22] discouragement you can go through ups
[58:23] and downs you can go through all kinds
[58:25] of Hell on Earth but you're now having
[58:28] the reality of being able to tap into
[58:31] the channel of Christ man see so we
[58:36] unworthy Mortals have been brought in to
[58:39] be Sons and Daughters of God to be
[58:42] fellow
[58:43] citizens ain't that right amen you know
[58:47] if if we're Sons and Daughters of God if
[58:49] we're part of God then surely there's a
[58:50] part of God about us that we got to act
[58:53] like God
[58:55] sure speak like God think like God ain't
[58:59] that right so see he says see we've been
[59:02] brought into a real that even the angels
[59:05] know nothing about you and
[59:10] IJ angels are just servants you realize
[59:14] they're at your bidding yeah they are
[59:16] angels are at your bidding you're not at
[59:19] the bidding of angels angels are at your
[59:23] bidding angels Don't have the power that
[59:25] you
[59:27] have praise our
[59:30] God it's a relationship with God that
[59:33] they don't enter they cannot enter into
[59:35] so it's the Sons and Daughters of God
[59:37] having the mind of Christ amen see what
[59:41] is it thinking as God
[59:43] thinks thinking as God thinks you've
[59:46] tapped into his thoughts you're the
[59:49] channel that's right for his thoughts to
[59:52] Anchor amen amen ain't that right before
[59:56] you can speak the word of God there's
[59:57] got to be his thoughts that's
[1:00:02] right amen amen so then you have the
[1:00:05] mind of Christ to have the mind of
[1:00:07] Christ is to be able to
[1:00:09] perceive to understand to know and I
[1:00:14] think this is what the message is all
[1:00:15] about is getting the thoughts of God to
[1:00:18] us that you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:00:21] God that you are his offspring that you
[1:00:25] are the redeemed of God you cannot lose
[1:00:28] you cannot fail you cannot go under you
[1:00:32] cannot be destroyed if God before us who
[1:00:35] can be against us amen thoughts thoughts
[1:00:38] of God can you say Amen this Bible is
[1:00:42] nothing but God's
[1:00:45] thoughts that's right God's word in seed
[1:00:48] form amen ain't that right now notice
[1:00:53] what the prophet said the word is in the
[1:00:57] bride right God ain't going to place his
[1:01:00] word in nothing else but his
[1:01:05] bride I think that's
[1:01:07] powerful the word is in the bride and
[1:01:12] the mind of
[1:01:14] Christ who's got the mind of Christ the
[1:01:17] bride you who's got the word of God you
[1:01:22] you we're we're privileged Church amen
[1:01:25] no man could put his Dogma in you God
[1:01:28] reserved you so he can put his word in
[1:01:31] you Satan's tried to put his traditions
[1:01:34] and all kinds of false lies and
[1:01:36] doctrines and well false lies false
[1:01:38] doctrines and lies and and all of these
[1:01:41] things of man-made and and and all of
[1:01:43] these things but God would cleanse us
[1:01:45] from these things so he could put his
[1:01:48] word in there and the word now is in the
[1:01:51] bride not contaminated bride a real
[1:01:55] bride holding a real uncontaminated word
[1:01:59] of God can you say Amen praise the Lord
[1:02:03] yes sir and the mind of Christ to know
[1:02:06] what he wants done with that word that's
[1:02:08] right she does it in his name for she
[1:02:10] has thus sayith the Lord she has thus
[1:02:14] sayith the Lord can you say Amen to
[1:02:16] think of it you in this day could
[1:02:17] fulfill the scriptures you're you're
[1:02:19] you're called to fulfill the scriptures
[1:02:22] if you shall say not if I say but you
[1:02:24] shall say right remember that become
[1:02:27] real known to brother brandom out in the
[1:02:29] woods you know it wasn't that if I could
[1:02:31] say but you shall say he I didn't even
[1:02:35] understand that scripture and then all
[1:02:36] of a sudden you know there was no
[1:02:37] squirrels sitting there and then it
[1:02:38] voice how many squirrels do you want
[1:02:40] right you know and and then God held him
[1:02:43] to that remember he's he he spoke let
[1:02:47] there be a squirrel and and then there
[1:02:49] was one then he was going to go home I
[1:02:50] think that's what it was but you said
[1:02:52] you said three
[1:02:55] CH if you say it it's got to come to
[1:02:58] pass it's the word of God God's going to
[1:03:01] hold
[1:03:02] that
[1:03:03] Hallelujah you believe that even though
[1:03:06] it was just brother brandham in in the
[1:03:08] woods no one could have refuted it no
[1:03:11] one could have known any different he
[1:03:13] could have kept that quiet and said well
[1:03:14] I thought you know but God with hold him
[1:03:16] to it it's God's
[1:03:19] word amen amen so to have the mind of
[1:03:23] Christ is to have the word in you and to
[1:03:26] have the word in you is to have thus say
[1:03:29] the Lord amen ain't that right so a word
[1:03:32] is a thought expressed it starts as a
[1:03:34] thought then expressed into word brother
[1:03:37] Braham said what is the word a word is a
[1:03:39] thought manifested a thought spoken
[1:03:41] forth see God first he perceived the
[1:03:44] thought and spoke it and uh it became a
[1:03:49] word and the word became material
[1:03:52] everything that God has spoke in his
[1:03:53] word
[1:03:55] received into the right channel will
[1:03:59] materialize that word for whatever the
[1:04:01] promise behind it is say that again
[1:04:05] everything everybody say everything that
[1:04:08] God has spoken his word received into
[1:04:11] the right channel amen how means the
[1:04:15] right
[1:04:17] channel this word is so
[1:04:20] powerful it amen God has protected this
[1:04:24] word throughout the
[1:04:25] ages he is so protected it ain't that
[1:04:28] right now if he would protect it on the
[1:04:30] pages how much more would he protected
[1:04:32] in
[1:04:34] you he he protected this so that you
[1:04:37] would come along in this age a prophet
[1:04:40] would come and straighten out all the
[1:04:42] isms and all the schimms and reveal the
[1:04:45] true mysteries of God so that you could
[1:04:49] have the true word and if you're that
[1:04:51] right channel then that word's going to
[1:04:54] going to produce exactly what it says
[1:04:58] for whatever promise be behind it is God
[1:05:01] will do it he's obligated to do it ain't
[1:05:04] that right now John 15:6 if you abide in
[1:05:07] me and my words abide in you you shall
[1:05:09] ask what you will you shall ask what you
[1:05:13] will and it shall be done to you see so
[1:05:15] you abiding in the word the word abiding
[1:05:17] in you means that you and the word are
[1:05:20] inseparable ain't that right that's
[1:05:23] right you and the word are are
[1:05:25] inseparable so the word must abide in
[1:05:28] you don't you let the devil take that
[1:05:30] word
[1:05:32] out
[1:05:34] amen don't don't don't let the devil
[1:05:36] take that word out don't let your trials
[1:05:38] take that word out because the words got
[1:05:40] to be in you before you go to
[1:05:44] asking come on now now brother Bram said
[1:05:48] this is Christ every word in here is God
[1:05:50] itself wrote in print receive it in your
[1:05:54] heart amen and watch what happens after
[1:05:59] you receive it another place if you need
[1:06:01] anything from God the seed of God will
[1:06:03] produce it if you'll just receive it
[1:06:06] into your heart and believe it with all
[1:06:09] of your
[1:06:11] heart can you say amen amen that's right
[1:06:15] see now everything that Satan has taken
[1:06:18] from us Christ redeemed it at
[1:06:21] Calvary so our faith is is based upon
[1:06:26] the finished work of Calvary right ain't
[1:06:29] that right the Lord the finished work of
[1:06:31] Calvary and so we have been redeemed
[1:06:34] back to our position everything that we
[1:06:37] are air to that God made us for and God
[1:06:41] gave to us we
[1:06:43] now have the rights Amen to take
[1:06:49] it it it it belongs to
[1:06:52] us amen our children belongs to us amen
[1:06:56] I don't believe that that brother
[1:06:57] brandom just talked about our
[1:06:59] children uh you know uh being ours if it
[1:07:04] really wasn't for us but this is part of
[1:07:07] the book it's ours our children belongs
[1:07:11] to us healing belongs to us do you
[1:07:13] believe that healing belongs to us joy
[1:07:18] peace contentment happiness Victory It
[1:07:21] All Belongs to us a new Heaven and a new
[1:07:24] Earth it belongs to us a millennial
[1:07:26] Reign belongs to us the changing of our
[1:07:30] body belongs to us every Divine promise
[1:07:33] of God it belongs to us do you believe
[1:07:35] that church if you believe in the
[1:07:38] Redemption of Christ you have to believe
[1:07:40] that it belongs to you he didn't die and
[1:07:43] just to give you a part of a promise and
[1:07:45] then and then leave the everything out
[1:07:47] that's just a lie you if we believe what
[1:07:51] he he died for then we truly have have
[1:07:54] to believe that every promise is
[1:07:57] ours it belongs to us it belongs to us
[1:08:01] there shouldn't be one thing that we
[1:08:03] should question about God's promises oh
[1:08:05] well I believe I'm saved but I don't
[1:08:06] know if I'm going to Rapture then you
[1:08:08] don't believe you're saved you can't if
[1:08:10] if God would save you then he's not
[1:08:12] going to leave
[1:08:13] you well I believe i' i' I've got the
[1:08:16] Holy Ghost but I just don't know if I
[1:08:17] I'll ever get my healing or not well
[1:08:19] then you can't have the Holy Ghost
[1:08:21] you've got if you can believe for the
[1:08:23] Holy Ghost and you can believe for your
[1:08:25] healing why would God leave it out for
[1:08:28] you why why would God leave all the
[1:08:30] promises
[1:08:34] out can you say Amen we're the one that
[1:08:37] limits God we're the one that limits him
[1:08:41] because we can't believe for it but have
[1:08:43] the faith of God all things are possible
[1:08:46] to them that believe how can it be
[1:08:48] possible he redeemed it he bought it all
[1:08:52] back Satan's just a squatter
[1:08:57] can you say amen he might be squatting
[1:08:59] on your spirit
[1:09:01] tonight you have the right to say get
[1:09:03] away from me he might be disturbing your
[1:09:07] mind but you have the
[1:09:09] right you're a son and daughter of God
[1:09:13] that's
[1:09:14] right you believe it now we can see that
[1:09:17] it belongs to us through the opening of
[1:09:19] the book that's right it belongs to us
[1:09:22] see this message is the open opening of
[1:09:24] the word and when the word was opened
[1:09:26] John saw
[1:09:28] himself as I said I believe he saw
[1:09:30] himself in every promise amen amen and
[1:09:33] John was only a representation of us he
[1:09:36] was caught up in this day he saw the
[1:09:38] lamb take the book he saw the book open
[1:09:41] he looked up on that book and every
[1:09:43] promise he saw himself
[1:09:47] in why would the prophet spend all this
[1:09:49] time preaching promises if we ain't
[1:09:51] going to believe it that's right brother
[1:09:53] amen
[1:09:54] that's right come on church it's so sad
[1:09:57] when message people believe that God
[1:09:58] sent a prophet and they believe that the
[1:10:00] lamb has opened the book and I'm I'm I'm
[1:10:02] talking to all of us now and we get into
[1:10:04] the
[1:10:05] dumps we get as though we can't see
[1:10:11] Victory true it's because Satan has a
[1:10:14] way to mess with us but I'm telling you
[1:10:17] you ain't going to go in a Rapture that
[1:10:19] way you got to you got to look see it
[1:10:22] clearly for you right you got to see
[1:10:25] everything
[1:10:26] clearly I will make it can you say man
[1:10:29] that's what mind of Christ is I've got
[1:10:31] the mind of
[1:10:32] Christ then if we've got the mind of
[1:10:34] Christ if we know that this Bible is
[1:10:36] true if we know every promise is true
[1:10:39] and the prophet brought us these
[1:10:41] promises then we must not let the devil
[1:10:44] mess with our
[1:10:46] minds
[1:10:48] amen that's the truth brother BR talked
[1:10:50] about living below their privileges well
[1:10:52] I think it's time that we quit below
[1:10:54] living below our
[1:10:55] privileges can't you can't go on Rapture
[1:10:58] living below your privilege that's right
[1:11:00] now come on church it's just the
[1:11:04] facts ain't that
[1:11:07] right God ain't going to wiggle the wand
[1:11:09] over us and then we make it all of a
[1:11:11] sudden yeah no you fight your way
[1:11:13] through it you speak your way out of it
[1:11:16] you speak your way into it speak your
[1:11:19] way into a Rapture speak your way into a
[1:11:22] body change clim
[1:11:24] it confess it Lord that's what we're
[1:11:27] doing we're
[1:11:29] confessing can you say Amen creating an
[1:11:33] atmosphere a creative atmosphere not an
[1:11:36] atmosphere of doubt and moolly grubs and
[1:11:38] grumbling and mumbling and as though you
[1:11:42] know God ain't for us hogwash I don't
[1:11:45] care if you don't feel that if God is
[1:11:46] for you God is for you it's the word of
[1:11:49] God let this mind be in
[1:11:51] you take on the mind of Christ can you
[1:11:54] say amen he knew he was Messiah he knew
[1:11:57] that he was the promised one he knew
[1:12:00] that that word spoke of him he knew that
[1:12:03] even before they arrested him that he
[1:12:05] would rise from the grave he knew it
[1:12:07] because the word said let that mind be
[1:12:10] in
[1:12:11] you can you say Amen let that mind be in
[1:12:14] you see Jesus Christ redeemed every
[1:12:17] promise at Calvary amen but in this day
[1:12:20] in this day what has he done he didn't
[1:12:22] come to die again we don't need him to
[1:12:24] die again he he died once and for all he
[1:12:27] perfected once and for all them that are
[1:12:31] Sanctified once for all that you are
[1:12:33] perfected once for all when did when are
[1:12:35] you perfected when you when you come to
[1:12:37] an altar no he perfected you that day at
[1:12:40] Calvary he redeemed you at Calvary he
[1:12:43] saved you at Calvary he healed you at
[1:12:45] Calvary by his stripes not we are healed
[1:12:48] we were healed we were healed can you
[1:12:51] say Amen why because Redemption has
[1:12:54] power in it calvary has power and the
[1:12:58] blood has been speaking in this age the
[1:13:02] word the bloody bleeding word oh every
[1:13:05] promise covered by his blood do you
[1:13:08] believe it yes sir covered by his blood
[1:13:11] that's what makes it sure see so he
[1:13:14] didn't come to die again but he's come
[1:13:16] to
[1:13:18] claim claim what he has redeemed claim
[1:13:21] everybody say claim he's come to claim
[1:13:23] clim you he's come to claim you what was

[1:13:49] my bride the sest judge amen or the
[1:13:52] Supreme judge has called you what you

[1:14:47] Lord claim our god-given rights
[1:14:52] yes
[1:14:55] amen you love
[1:14:57] him the power to create the
[1:15:01] world came from God's thoughts being
[1:15:05] expressed not expressing a
[1:15:08] wish not expressing wants right but
[1:15:12] expressing his thoughts yes sir power
[1:15:16] came by God expressing his own thoughts
[1:15:20] surely amen prise the Lord
[1:15:24] don't express your
[1:15:26] thoughts you can express negative all
[1:15:28] you want to ain't going to work
[1:15:32] right amen can you say
[1:15:36] Amen Express his thoughts that's it have
[1:15:39] the mind of God the mind of
[1:15:41] Christ yes see there had to be a thought
[1:15:44] first the thought had to be there and
[1:15:48] then he had to express those thoughts
[1:15:49] into word by speaking it ain't that
[1:15:51] right the thought had had to be there
[1:15:53] church before you can speak the word the
[1:15:56] thought has to be there and he's giv you
[1:15:58] a bunch of them that's right now you got
[1:16:01] to receive them to God think upon
[1:16:04] them dwell upon them meditate upon them
[1:16:08] didn't the pon say let the meditation of
[1:16:10] my heart be acceptable unto thee don't
[1:16:13] don't don't just meditate on anything
[1:16:15] don't just accept anything don't accept
[1:16:18] anything as true your feelings ain't the
[1:16:20] truth your sensation ain't truth then
[1:16:23] don't accept them as truth your symptoms
[1:16:25] ain't the truth God's word is the truth
[1:16:29] ain't that right you're you're you're
[1:16:31] simp you can feel sorry for yourself it
[1:16:33] ain't going to give you the power to do
[1:16:37] anything praise
[1:16:39] God we all ought to know that one
[1:16:44] right now brother Bram said what is a
[1:16:47] word a word is the manifestation of a
[1:16:49] thought is expression of a thought
[1:16:53] before you say anything everybody say
[1:16:55] before you say
[1:16:56] anything oh subconsciously you think it
[1:17:00] before you speak is that right so in the
[1:17:03] beginning was the word that's as far as
[1:17:04] we go back by this by theology but
[1:17:08] before the word was it was a thought and
[1:17:09] a thought was manifest made manifest you
[1:17:12] see what I mean that's how he said first
[1:17:15] he thought and he spoke the word and the
[1:17:17] Word was made manifest oh how infallible
[1:17:20] God is notice every thought when it's
[1:17:22] spoken no wonder when Jesus came off the
[1:17:26] hill that night and looked around that
[1:17:28] tree for food there was no food on the
[1:17:31] tree and he said no man eateth from thee
[1:17:34] and he went on away see and the next day
[1:17:37] coming back the tree had withered what
[1:17:39] was it God's mind everybody say God's
[1:17:40] mind God's mind that that what was it
[1:17:43] did he have did he have h a superpower
[1:17:46] no just had God's
[1:17:49] mind was he trained in how to say it no
[1:17:53] just had God's
[1:17:57] mind praise the Lord and the mind the
[1:18:00] mind that in the beginning the same mind
[1:18:03] that was in the beginning amen that was
[1:18:05] a thought before it was a word that
[1:18:08] expressed Jesus Christ the same one was
[1:18:11] expressing that word back
[1:18:13] again
[1:18:15] oh see so to speak the word of God is to
[1:18:18] express the mind of God Amen is that
[1:18:22] right right see now man can speak the
[1:18:25] word through intellectual conception but
[1:18:28] that's not possessing the mind of Christ
[1:18:30] we're speaking of
[1:18:32] Revelation something that has struck
[1:18:34] your soul Glory that's it right there
[1:18:38] how many believes you're saved amen you
[1:18:40] believe you're saved how do you know
[1:18:42] you're saved because the preacher said
[1:18:44] you're saved or did it become such a
[1:18:46] revelation to you amen I'm
[1:18:49] sa so then if someone were to come to
[1:18:52] you and say oh you're not saved what
[1:18:54] what would you do would you sit there
[1:18:55] and say well I thought it was well the
[1:19:00] preacher that's dead now or my mom
[1:19:02] that's gone they used to tell me I'm
[1:19:04] safe so I just believed
[1:19:06] it no it becomes such a revelation to
[1:19:10] you then then and they come and tell you
[1:19:13] you're not saved you say well you wasn't
[1:19:17] there what is it you're expressing
[1:19:19] something you're expressing the mind of
[1:19:22] God because it became a revelation to
[1:19:25] you well that goes with healing that
[1:19:27] goes with anything of God's promises the
[1:19:30] devil now here's the thing a lot of
[1:19:32] times it's not a person in flesh it's
[1:19:34] the devil coming into our thoughts and
[1:19:37] then our thoughts become more intimate
[1:19:39] with us we think it's actually us that
[1:19:41] is doing it we think it's actually us
[1:19:43] that are Sav saying it we're and it
[1:19:45] actually a lot of times them thoughts
[1:19:47] coincide and with our feelings and our
[1:19:50] Sensations and everything well I don't
[1:19:52] feel s saved you know and the mind is
[1:19:54] saying you're not saved well I don't
[1:19:56] feel saved so I must not be saved that
[1:19:58] is the
[1:20:00] devil can you say Amen don't be a
[1:20:03] channel for that stupid
[1:20:05] devil God didn't save you to be a
[1:20:08] channel for the devil and lend your body
[1:20:11] over for his power and subject your
[1:20:14] thoughts to his thoughts and and all
[1:20:16] these things you are a channel for God
[1:20:19] the Bible says you are bought with a
[1:20:21] price you're not your own
[1:20:23] your
[1:20:25] Gods Hallelujah you believe
[1:20:30] it yes sir so you speak by Revelation
[1:20:34] see it's it's something that's been
[1:20:36] revealed to you that's
[1:20:38] right now brother Brandon goes on every
[1:20:41] word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid
[1:20:43] in seed form that if received into the
[1:20:47] human being now think of it this word
[1:20:50] can literally be received in to
[1:20:53] you ain't that amazing God made it to
[1:20:57] where that you just wouldn't receive it
[1:21:00] or or read it but literally this word
[1:21:03] could be received in
[1:21:08] you oh I'm so glad for that e Jes that
[1:21:11] we can actually receive the word that
[1:21:13] we've got the ability to receive the
[1:21:14] word you got you got the ability to
[1:21:16] receive it well if you got the Holy
[1:21:19] Ghost you do how in the world could you
[1:21:21] even get the Holy Ghost if you didn't
[1:21:23] have the ability to receive the Holy
[1:21:28] Ghost so every word in the Bible is
[1:21:32] God's thoughts laid in seed form that if
[1:21:35] received into the human being and
[1:21:39] spoke by the same
[1:21:43] thought don't put nothing to it if God
[1:21:48] said you're healed you are
[1:21:51] healed
[1:21:53] don't put anything to it well I thought
[1:21:56] I was healed well but I'm still hurting
[1:21:59] well I still can't see well nothing's
[1:22:01] changed don't you put nothing to
[1:22:04] that must be spoke by the same
[1:22:07] thought and remember God's thoughts are
[1:22:10] Eternal and they are
[1:22:12] real it's not a fake it's not it's not
[1:22:15] like a a a man Builder looking on the
[1:22:17] blueprint and then looking and and and
[1:22:20] and going to transfer this into reality
[1:22:22] see God's thoughts are real
[1:22:25] already that's why you're already saved
[1:22:28] that's why you were already glorified
[1:22:29] you're already it's already done it's
[1:22:32] God's thoughts so then when you take on
[1:22:36] the mind of God and now you speak the
[1:22:38] word in the same thought by that same
[1:22:41] thought you don't worry about it no more
[1:22:43] I don't care about feeling I don't care
[1:22:45] about the pain I don't care about how I
[1:22:47] look and I don't care about the
[1:22:48] situation it's already done it's already
[1:22:51] taken care of already saved they're
[1:22:53] already filled with the Holy Ghost we
[1:22:55] are victorious we've already made it
[1:22:58] it's already done well how do you know
[1:23:00] it's already done God said so that's all
[1:23:03] that we need God said so we don't need
[1:23:05] scientific proof we don't need medical
[1:23:06] proof God said
[1:23:12] so spoke by the same thought sir can you
[1:23:16] say amen amen that materialized the
[1:23:18] Bible brings the thing to pass that's
[1:23:21] right how powerful could the church be
[1:23:23] see the Bible said let this mind that
[1:23:25] was in Christ be in you as a man
[1:23:27] thinketh in his heart so is he now your
[1:23:29] thoughts if they become
[1:23:32] expression we'll try to hurry now God
[1:23:34] said let the world let there be a world
[1:23:37] before it could be a word it had to be a
[1:23:39] thought so God in the creation created
[1:23:41] the thought the World by his thought
[1:23:43] first then spoke it and the thought be
[1:23:45] expressed became material ain't that
[1:23:48] right amen see now if that same spirit
[1:23:51] that said let their there be light and
[1:23:53] there was light Let There Be trees and
[1:23:54] there was trees if that same mind that
[1:23:56] was in Christ be in you how much could
[1:23:59] it say let there be no cancer and it
[1:24:00] would be gone let the blind eyes be open
[1:24:03] and it would be so see it's your
[1:24:05] thoughts well I thought it was God's
[1:24:07] thoughts but hold it you and God are one
[1:24:09] now can you say Amen you and God are
[1:24:15] one yes sir on now see you say oh that
[1:24:19] was Jesus but wait a minute he said have
[1:24:21] faith in God for verily verily I say
[1:24:23] unto you if you should say to this
[1:24:25] mountain be moved plucked up and cast
[1:24:26] into the sea don't doubt in your heart
[1:24:28] but believe that what you shall say will
[1:24:30] come to pass you'll have whatsoever
[1:24:32] things thou sayest you shall have it not
[1:24:35] me Jesus said not me see you shall have
[1:24:37] it what power has been given to the
[1:24:40] church now you can express it by mental
[1:24:42] conception but if it becomes a real
[1:24:45] revelation of God that you see it before
[1:24:48] it happens amen glory praise the Lord
[1:24:52] well how do you know you're going to go
[1:24:53] in a Rapture I see
[1:24:56] it how you know you're one of them I see
[1:24:58] it how do you know you're going to be
[1:25:00] not left behind I I see it well how do
[1:25:03] you know you're going to have a body
[1:25:04] change I see it how do you know you're
[1:25:06] going to be at the wedding supper I see
[1:25:08] it I there's a table waiting for me
[1:25:10] there's a chair I see it can you say
[1:25:13] Amen yes sir there's no one going to
[1:25:15] take my place I see
[1:25:19] it that's the mind of Christ
[1:25:22] having the mind of
[1:25:27] Christ feelings are going to lie to you
[1:25:30] emotion's going to lie to you your old
[1:25:32] flesh is going to lie to you who cares

[1:34:37] on sure ain't that the best thing to
[1:34:41] do a I just don't feel good then we want

[1:36:39] God with all of our heart and accept his
[1:36:41] son the Lord Jesus and God recognizes
[1:36:44] that faith is true in him May our faith
[1:36:48] be true in him then he sends back down
[1:36:51] the the Holy Spirit of promise and seals
[1:36:52] us until the day of our Redemption my
[1:36:56] that takes all the
[1:36:59] scare all out of

[1:37:27] Christianity and God has called me to be
[1:37:30] a Christian I ain't here to be a
[1:37:32] Christian and a
[1:37:34] sinner right I'm not here to be a
[1:37:36] believer and a doubter I'm here to be a
[1:37:40] Christian my mouth is going to speak
[1:37:42] Christian my thoughts are going to be
[1:37:44] Christian my ways are going to be
[1:37:45] Christian can you say Amen

[1:37:58] thoughts negative thoughts as we all
[1:38:00] know does not produce positive language
[1:38:04] amen negative thoughts produce what
[1:38:08] negative language negative talk negative
[1:38:12] actions right so how are you doing
[1:38:15] that don't know well you just
[1:38:18] automatically know they're entertaining
[1:38:20] negative thoughts
[1:38:22] well that's just me I'm just negative
[1:38:25] well if you're a Christian you got to
[1:38:27] change that and you have the power to
[1:38:30] change
[1:38:31] it God gave you a prophet God gave you a
[1:38:36] word can you say Amen you got the choice
[1:38:39] to either receive all the negative and
[1:38:42] and receive all the the garbage to where
[1:38:45] you live such a life of
[1:38:48] defeat or you have the power to say you
[1:38:50] know what I'm sick and tired of
[1:38:55] this just sick and tired of it may not
[1:38:58] happen all spont
[1:39:01] spontaneous but you start speaking you
[1:39:03] start thinking God's
[1:39:06] thoughts can you say amen and before you
[1:39:08] know it you're going to climb yourself
[1:39:10] out of this thing climb yourself out of
[1:39:12] it can you say Amen we're not here to be
[1:39:15] defeated you realize Church you realize
[1:39:18] church that when we get to heaven as the
[1:39:20] bride of Christ you will have overcome
[1:39:23] every
[1:39:24] enemy there will not be one little imp
[1:39:28] be able to walk up to God and say you
[1:39:30] know what you took him out early
[1:39:34] because he didn't get
[1:39:36] me well who are you well
[1:39:42] Pride
[1:39:45] bitterness no no
[1:39:48] no everyone's got to go under our feet
[1:39:52] and the thing is the Bible says he's
[1:39:54] already put everything under his
[1:39:57] feet Christ's feet and if you're his
[1:39:59] body and he's the head then it's under
[1:40:01] your feet so then let's talk like
[1:40:06] that is that all
[1:40:08] right brother BR said now it's a strange
[1:40:11] thing that this is so much thought of of
[1:40:13] people they say well and I read this
[1:40:15] last Sunday but I'm weak my faith is not
[1:40:18] very much I'm not a very good Christian
[1:40:21] that's just what the devil want you to
[1:40:26] say man he said you're just talking his
[1:40:30] language right then yes amen you must
[1:40:33] never say that everybody say I must
[1:40:36] never say that that's just as much of a
[1:40:42] sin as going out and getting a beer come
[1:40:46] on church it's sin when we talk unbelief
[1:40:51] remember we talked about last Sunday
[1:40:53] brother brand talks about them when God
[1:40:56] told them Israel to put up the blood
[1:40:59] display the blood on the house and get
[1:41:01] in and if when I see the blood I'll pass
[1:41:04] over you he said for them to fear under
[1:41:06] that blood for them to worry and fear
[1:41:08] and and and shiver and and wondering
[1:41:10] what's going to happen he said it would
[1:41:11] have been an insult to Jehovah that's
[1:41:14] right and he says and we insult God when
[1:41:18] we talk unbelief and he said don't
[1:41:21] insult God if God said he'll provide for
[1:41:25] your needs don't insult him by talking
[1:41:28] negative that's
[1:41:31] good he's the one that said you're
[1:41:34] loosed by the very blood of God then
[1:41:37] don't insult it by questioning
[1:41:42] it now notice you must never say that
[1:41:47] don't let your testimony be negative let
[1:41:49] it be positive all the time I am saved I
[1:41:53] have God in my heart I believe him with
[1:41:56] all of my heart do you believe in Divine
[1:41:58] Healing with all of my heart you might
[1:42:01] be sick as a dog but I still believe in
[1:42:04] Divine
[1:42:05] Healing amen you might have been in
[1:42:07] plague for years but I still believe
[1:42:09] believe in Divine Healing can you say

[1:43:42] you think about God when you keep you
[1:43:45] keep your mind oh see he said you sit in
[1:43:47] church and think about everything else
[1:43:49] but God how you going to do your washing
[1:43:52] how you going to do at the office
[1:43:54] tomorrow how you going to do this or
[1:43:56] that or the other keep your mind off of
[1:43:58] that and think on God the Bible says if
[1:44:01] there be any praise if there be any
[1:44:02] virtue think on these things well I
[1:44:04] wonder if I'll be even called in the
[1:44:05] prayer line wonder if God will speak
[1:44:08] don't think that kind of negative
[1:44:10] thought don't let don't let it go
[1:44:12] through your mind make every word
[1:44:15] positive and every thought positive is
[1:44:19] this okay make every word positive make
[1:44:24] every thought
[1:44:26] positive run that stinking devil
[1:44:31] off sir Amen Let deity be revealed in
[1:44:36] you can you say
[1:44:38] amen I think negative thoughts keep us
[1:44:41] from being a real channel for God Amen
[1:44:44] because we we know that what sweet and
[1:44:47] bitter water cannot flow from the same
[1:44:49] fountain and this is why the fight is so
[1:44:52] hard because Satan is prevalent the lid
[1:44:55] of hell has been lifted off he's here
[1:44:58] he's manifesting himself and it's
[1:45:00] getting stronger and stronger to where
[1:45:03] he's going to be
[1:45:05] incarnated and and it's it's so the
[1:45:07] fight is on and it's it's very real it's
[1:45:10] very
[1:45:11] true you're the only ones that have the
[1:45:14] power to resist
[1:45:17] him ain't going to go there devil
[1:45:21] can you say
[1:45:23] Amen you know what the prophet said you
[1:45:25] cannot get anything from God with the
[1:45:27] negative thought right so no wonder the
[1:45:31] devil puts us thoughts negative thoughts
[1:45:33] and we catch it and we entertain it quit
[1:45:35] doing that and I'm talking to myself
[1:45:38] right now quit doing
[1:45:41] it you can't get nothing from God by
[1:45:44] negative thought that's
[1:45:46] right amen notice what he says while I'm
[1:45:49] praying and speaking I want want every
[1:45:50] person in here to have this in your mind
[1:45:54] that as soon as prayer begins to go for
[1:45:56] the sick every one of you is going to
[1:45:58] get up and walk out of the building well
[1:46:01] now that's what he told everybody to
[1:46:02] have as we're getting ready to pray he
[1:46:04] says every one of you this is what
[1:46:06] you're going to have now I want you to
[1:46:07] start thinking on this way I'm going to
[1:46:10] get up and I'm going to walk out of here
[1:46:14] well right he says don't have nothing
[1:46:18] else in your mind
[1:46:20] just keep thinking that let your
[1:46:24] testimony be positive let your
[1:46:26] confession be positive can you say amen
[1:46:29] that's right Amen brother Brown said
[1:46:32] every time you get sick and you were
[1:46:33] prayed for and you go out and get a
[1:46:35] little sick you say well I guess I lost
[1:46:39] my healing he said then your testimony
[1:46:41] becomes negative and Jesus can't say no
[1:46:43] more for you he's the high priest of
[1:46:46] your confession sitting there making
[1:46:49] intercessions on you your confession on
[1:46:51] what you
[1:46:54] believe can you say Amen you can bring
[1:46:57] Doom and Gloom on you just by negative
