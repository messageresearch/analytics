And able Oh, yeah. We forgot offering. We'll we can do it later. We'll do it after service. Remind me. Amen. Um if you would like to turn to your Bibles, we're going to go to St. John the 14th chapter. Amen. And uh want to thank brother Terry for taking the service Sunday and brother Amos being willing to help out with the song service. And &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um bless the name of the Lord. We had uh I had spoke on this um read this scripture I guess last Wednesday and um I would like to uh just read it again starting at the first verse says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also. Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in prayer. Father, Lord, we're comforting to know, Lord, that you are able. You're able to take any situation, Lord, work it out for the good. And Father, that's why we can trust you and be at rest, Father, and help us to be so. Now I pray, Father, that you would just take what simple words we'd have tonight and Lord just speak to your people, Father, as you have multiplied the fish and loaves, may you take the words and multiply, Father, and create something that is may be lacking within us, Lord. And uh and you can do that by your word. We ask that you'd bless the the people that are here. Father, may we just get caught up in heavenly places in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. You can have your seats. Praise the Lord. And um so uh if I were to use a title u again I would uh there is a place prepared for me and the scripture is a uh words of comfort uh here that we have just read uh Jesus talking about our future uh and and it's is the future to every believer. And I, you know, the word future means something that is to be existing or occurring at a later time, specifically uh after death. Existing after death. And um and so Jesus is letting uh not only his disciples know but letting the believer know that uh there is life after death that that when a man dies it's it's not the end and there is a land where we go that uh a man lives and and never dies. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I I think that's powerful, you know, uh because men and women are trying to uh extend life. &gt;&gt; Uh they're, you know, using the science and they're using all kinds of things to make life here better. And yet they want to remain young. And and we know that it it it's impossible for that to be here in this life. But Jesus says that there is a place to go. &gt;&gt; And so when when this life is over, then as the prophet said, there's a life that we go into. And it's it's a continuation of this same life in another world, another place. &gt;&gt; So then the believer doesn't go out of existence when he or she dies. and and we're we we know that we're living in a great time. It's a it's an important time. It's it's an awesome time to the believer because the prophet says that we're we're at a time where time is blending uh with eternity. &gt;&gt; Uh which tells us that the rapture is at hand. I I know that through years, you know, um, no doubt, well, Paul even talked about the rapture and and being caught up in and this is something that we've all talked about, we've we've lived for, our ancestors have talked about it, believed in, and and all of these things. But I we can see more more that that that were here at at the time of rapture. And every believer looks forward to the rapture. Are you looking forward to it? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're we're looking forward to this time. And be because we cannot go to the place that Christ has prepared for us uh unless we go into the rapture. Amen. Uh to be partake of it. So, so we're we're looking uh for this this event of of the rapture and and even those who have gone before us. Amen. Uh they're waiting uh uh for the rapture. They're they're they're waiting for this time uh because they can't partake of the things that all the things that have been prepared &gt;&gt; uh without the rapture. And and so that's Paul would say that they without us cannot be made perfect. And brother Brandham used that scripture for for this day and and the saints that have uh the New Testament saints that have throughout the ages, they they cannot be made perfect without us. And so, uh, first Thessalonians 4:16 says, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first." So, those that are already gone on, they're going to rise and be part of this rapture. Can you say amen? And then when we which are alive and remaining shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we we know that this event's going to happen any time. &gt;&gt; Look look look at the things that has taken place. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's u I I know that's not a sign for us as believer. We've received our sign, &gt;&gt; but yet it it's it's just uh things that are letting us know just how close we really are. &gt;&gt; We we see that the lamb has has loosed the seven seals and the book is now open. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; And so the prophet would tell us, he says the lamb came, amen, for what he had redeemed. the lamb came and and and notice what Jesus said in our opening scripture. I go away, amen, to prepare a place. Uh uh but I'll come again and receive you unto myself. So he says the lamb came. Amen. When he opened that book, when when he took the book from him that sat upon the throne, loosened them seals and and and and and descended. Uh uh the lamb came for what he had redeemed. He come to claim what he had redeemed. He's already got it right here in the book, taken it from his hand. Now he's coming to receive &gt;&gt; what he has redeemed. &gt;&gt; That's that's his work. He's done. He's come to receive it. Ain't that right? So So Jesus says, "I will receive you unto myself." So he has come to claim his inheritance. The prophet said, uh, the church, the bride, ain't that right? And and we know that the mighty angel of revelations 1 has descended with that open book and he has declared that time shall be no more. &gt;&gt; Time shall be no more. Now that's that's that's significant to us. Amen. And and so the prophet says the seventh seal is the end of time for all things. Everything runs out in this time. the end of the the of the seventh seal. He said, notice it's the end of the church age. It's the end of the seven seals. It's the end of the trumpets. It's the end of the vials. It's even ends the ushering in of the millennium. That's on the seventh seal. He said it's just like firing a rocket into the air. That rocket explodes here and it goes up. Then it explodes again. It puts out five stars and one of the stars explodes and blows out five stars from it and then one of them stars explodes and blows out five stars from it and it fades on out. That's what the seventh seal. See, he says it just ends the time for the world. It ends the time for this. It means the end of time for that. It ends the time for this. It ends the time. Everything just ended up on that seventh seal. And we know that that we're part of that seven seal that that that seal is open. And and brother Brandham says the seventh seal opens the coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So So he comes, I will come again and receive you unto myself. Well, the seventh seal opens this up. He also said that the second coming is the rapture. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Is the rapture. So the the rapture happens under that seventh seal. &gt;&gt; And we know the rapture is the believer being caught up uh to meet the Lord in the air. And I believe with all of my heart, and I'm I'm sure you do, too, that there are people living on on earth today that will never taste death. and and that are going to receive a change in their body. And I I just believe in that. I I'm I believe that's how close we are that that it could happen just today. It could happen Amen. before we get out of church. It it it could happen. Amen. And and them people the people are going to be changed from mortal to immortality and and they're going to be caught away. Ain't that right? And then there's the those that are left behind, they're they're going to go into the great tribulation. And and so and and we realize that both events are upon us. The people that that are uh headed toward tribulation, the prophet said they're getting in the spirit. And I say they are in the spirit for this this event. But but the people that's going in in the rapture, they're in the spirit for such an event. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, uh, we we find a scripture that seems to be more standing out to us today, uh, than any other time, and that's 1 Thessalonians 5:1 through3. But of the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. &gt;&gt; For when they shall say, "Peace and safety." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Is that not what they're doing today? Peace and safety. Peace and safety. are they're they're they're they're they're pushing our president to get the Nobel Prize and saying he should have got it and and everybody applauding him for for for working peace in the Middle East and and all of these things. But notice now then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape. This is the tribulation. Can you say amen? God's wrath is going to be poured upon the people. But just before this happens, the rapture will take place. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So remember what Jesus said. I will come again. &gt;&gt; I will come again. Don't forget that now. I will come again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And receive you unto myself that where I am, there you may be also. Now, I believe this coming, amen, is is what Jesus spoke of in Luke 2:17. And then they shall see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that they'll recognize him as the son of man, but they'll see it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Here's another one. I I believe it's tied to Luke 17:30. the son of man being revealed. And we know that the son of man is is Christ. Ain't that right? And and so now many believe that uh Jesus will come to earth in his physical stature of what he was of 2,000 years ago when he walked the earth. But that's not what Jesus promised. Because here in John 14:18, he says, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you." Is that what he says? &gt;&gt; I will come to you. Remember he says, I will I go up to prepare a place, but I will come again and receive you unto myself. And then now we're reading uh uh uh verses uh that that was John 14:1-3 that we are opening scripture. Now this is John 8 14:18. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you yet a little while while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I'm in my father you in me and I in you the world seeth me no more they will not recognize him but you will know can you say amen so what does this mean it's it's the mystery that Paul talked about Christ in you the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. This this coming is a mystery to the world. &gt;&gt; But but to those that he comes to, they have the revelation of who he is, where he is. You will know that I'm in my father, you in me, and I in you. The world will not see him but the bride will have the revelation &gt;&gt; of him being in the father. Amen. And and us in him and he in us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We have come as we know simple things simple now uh that we've listened to the message but the prophet said we've come through the age of Luther. We've come through the age of sanctification of Wesley. We've come through the age of Pentecost. But notice he says, "Now we come to the head, the capstone." Who's the capstone? Christ. He's the head. Ain't that right? Zechariah talks about it. The head coming and and the headstone. And he says, "See grace. Grace. The capstone cried. See the headstone crying what? Grace. grace passed from death and creed into a living word of the living God. God's only provided plan for his age. His sons in the word age, quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off something to make it alive &gt;&gt; and seated now in heavenly places in present tense already alive and subject to every promise in the word. Then what does that do? You being a part of God's gene, a part of the word, other men, a part of God's word, seated together, manifests the entire body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So now, the prophet called it the bride coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? It manifests the entire body because there's no living among you. See just the word only seated in heavenly places in the door where he put his name Christ Jesus. Now notice he says no leaven among you. That brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you. &gt;&gt; Couldn't do it in Luther's age. Couldn't do it in Wesley's age. Couldn't do it in the Pentecostal age. But in the day when the son of man will be manifest, revealed, brought back the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people, showing the same visible signs, manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on earth in a form of a prophet God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh my. See, so another place he said, see the Holy Spirit is here on earth looking out these individuals that God has ordained to life in this age. And as soon as it finds it, it does just like it did on Jesus Christ, the great super son of God who redeemed us all. So what did it do to Jesus Christ? What did it do? It quickened him. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? When when the spirit of God came into him, it quickened him to where he manifested every promise of the word that was promised for his day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That spoke of Messiah &gt;&gt; so much that he was the word made flesh. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; So now the prophet talking of our day, the Holy Spirit has come down to quicken, make alive those people. That's for ordained of God to be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; He said that is, see, notice that is if he's a true eagle, he will understand the message of the hour. If he's a true eagle, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, I will come I will come again and receive you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he tells us directly where he's coming to. &gt;&gt; I will come to you. Right. &gt;&gt; And the prophet is saying it's a quickening power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That quickens us &gt;&gt; to get us ready for a rapture. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, brother Brandham says in another quote, "Can't can you see the son of man?" The son of man in the form of prophetic message returning back again in his church in prophecy revealing Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. It's never been done through the age till this time. It wasn't done on in the first stage. It wasn't done at the day of Pentecost. I know they they they they saying that that the son of man was revealed on the day of Pentecost. That is contrary to the Bible. There's only one time that the son of man is to be manifested or revealed and that's in the days of Noah like it was in the days of Noah. Like it was in the days of Lot which speaks of our day. &gt;&gt; Now notice notice how he describes this. He says, "Now I saw seven angels come." He's talking about the event that happened in Tucson. I saw seven angels come. Didn't Life magazine pack it &gt;&gt; and the fall as the fog of it floated across here 27 mi high, 30 m across. He said, "Is not Fred Sothman, these other Gene Norman sitting back there, stood right there with them? Seven angels appeared right there on the hill. It shook the heels for miles around like that. There stood seven angels and throwed a sword in your hand and said, "Go home. Open the seven seals that are given." And here they are. The true mystery of marriage and divorce and the serpent seed and all of these things that's been fussed about. It's thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Notice the question. What is it? the quickening power coming to the church, making her ready &gt;&gt; this hour that we're approaching its quickening power. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then the prophet says in another place, if it is the true Holy Spirit that has come to you, it'll manifest the promise of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, we know what it is. It's the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's the true token that we're going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Is the word being made manifest for this hour. So now Jesus I I truly believe and I'm not doing away with the the corporal body as you know &gt;&gt; but I truly believe that Jesus has come &gt;&gt; to receive us. &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; because there is a place that he has prepared for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. The Bible doesn't only foretell of uh events that are to happen in this mortal life, but it foretells of things and events that cannot be seen with the natural eye. Neither can they be known by the carnal mind and can't be understood. And this is why Paul would say in 1 Corinthians 2:9, "But as it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man the things." Everybody say, "The things which God hath prepared for them that love him." &gt;&gt; But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. For the Spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man that is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. Notice, we have now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God that we might know the things &gt;&gt; that are prepared &gt;&gt; and that are freely given to us &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Things that the the carnal mind doesn't know about. &gt;&gt; Things that the natural eye cannot see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Things that cannot be heard with the natural ear. And yet it's there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The Bible talks about things that couldn't be detected detected by the carnal mind. It had to be revealed. And you know uh ju Revelations 21:2 it says that I John saw the Holy Spirit or holy city new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Out of heaven. Now now think of this that years beforehand Abraham the Bible says look for a city. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now think of it. Never been there. A carnal flesh and blood man. &gt;&gt; Full of mistakes. &gt;&gt; And yet he's looking for a city &gt;&gt; whose builder and maker is God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says he thought the city was upon earth and he went searching all over. He met the king of this city, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he had communion. The prophet said he had communion with the king on the very spot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That that city's going to come on down on &gt;&gt; think of that. &gt;&gt; But it was by revelation that he caught it. &gt;&gt; There's a city somewhere. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There there's somewhere. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, years later, John is caught up in the spirit on the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; I truly believe this day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he says in in Revelations 21:2, "And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared." &gt;&gt; Everybody say, "Prepared." &gt;&gt; Prepared. As a bride adorned for her husband, The city is 1500 square miles, the prophet would tell us. And we can't see it, but he's gone to prepare it. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? In Revelations 21:18, John describes this city. The building of the wall of it was of jasper, and the city was pure gold likened to clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper. the second Sapphire and the third um uh &gt;&gt; Caledon. &gt;&gt; That one Caledon. &gt;&gt; Get it? and the fourth foundation and emerald and the fifth sardonics and and the sixth uh sardius and the seventh uh &gt;&gt; crystalite and the eighth barrel and the ninth topaz I guess tupaz the 10th a &gt;&gt; boy I'm brother Terry I'm glad you made it tonight so that one and the 11th uh jasinth I guess and the 12th um &gt;&gt; amethyst and the 12 gates were 12 pearls and several every several gate was of of one pearl in the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass &gt;&gt; it's it's specifically prepared and and the prophet said the divine architect has prepared and designed behind this city with tender hands &gt;&gt; for his beloved bride. &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; He's preparing for us, &gt;&gt; his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Ram says, "What a place it must be when divine nature, a divine architect has divine designed it for a divine attribute, that's you, that's been divinely predestinated by a divine God who is the author of divine life." &gt;&gt; And he doesn't use the things of the earth to make it. He just creates it. &gt;&gt; He doesn't use the gold of this earth. He just creates the goat. Can you say amen? And and we know that this earth is going to receive a baptism of fire. It's the prophet said it's a holy fire from God. And this fire is to cleanse it from sin, from sickness, from uh uh diseased germs, from sinners, from the devil, and all of his group. &gt;&gt; And there God will be with his true attributes. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; The trials that we go through, no more &gt;&gt; the the enemy that we deal with every day. No more &gt;&gt; uh no more anguish, no more tears, no more heartaches and no more trials. All of these things is is going to be over with. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; You'll never have to deal with him again. That's right. &gt;&gt; And God there in that place &gt;&gt; that God has prepared there will God be with his true attribute sons and daughters where he can fellowship with them in holiness with their eyes blinded to any sin. There will never be no more sin from there on. All right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now to think of this. Romans 8:1 19 Paul says, "For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God." &gt;&gt; For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope. because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together into now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit. In other words, those that have the Holy Ghost, we're groaning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, remember the lamb come. He opened the seal and he brought he descended to reveal the book. Prophet said he he come to give his inheritance to his people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Why are we groaning? &gt;&gt; Why are we groaning for something? Is because we've been given an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So the prophet said he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and he freely gives it out to us. It all belonged to him. He was the one who redeemed. But instead of keeping it himself, he gives it back to the people. That's his love for us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And he has revealed in this age the things that he's prepared for us. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Things that we would have overlooked &gt;&gt; reading the Bible and we'd never see it &gt;&gt; with the carnal mind. But he has revealed it. That's right. &gt;&gt; He went to prepare this place because he knows we're going to be there. This isn't something that is uncertain. He knows who's going to be there. It's such a certain thing that he don't have to wait &gt;&gt; before uh for us to arrive before he starts. He goes to prepare it. He's prepared for our arrival. &gt;&gt; And we're groaning. Think of that now. We're groaning within ourselves for the full possession of what belongs to us. Full and complete redemption. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad that our soul's been redeemed. &gt;&gt; But this whole body's got to be redeemed. Glory. &gt;&gt; Not only is the body going to be redeemed, but this earth has got to go through the process of complete redemption. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, this groaning within ourselves is what the prophet called birth painans. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nature is groaning. We are groaning. Everything is groaning because we realize there's something not right. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that tonight? &gt;&gt; There's something not right. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can groan and wait for it is because there has been new life come in. That speaks of a new world. That's the only way we can groan. If you're groaning tonight, waiting and groaning is because there's a new life that has come in. That's speaking of a new world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I will come to you and receive you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, our natural man or this old flesh man doesn't groan because it's of the natural. It speaks of the natural. It's earthbound. It's earthly. &gt;&gt; It's earthly minded. It's carnal minded. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and so our natural life doesn't speak of a new world. It only speaks of this old contaminated world. &gt;&gt; If we let this this life uh this carnal man rule us, we'll live in depression. We we will live without hope &gt;&gt; because there's no groaning. We live in this mortal realm, a world of darkness and chaos. The prophet said we live in three dimensions, light, time, and matter. I believe so. This this is the world of humanity, of corruption, of mortality. All of these things and and the senses that God gave us can only contact this world, &gt;&gt; right? only contacts this world. But then a prophet would come and tell us that there's other dimensions that are our five senses cannot contact. There's no way we could contact the other world. &gt;&gt; It's another world that exists. It's an unseen world. And the prophet said there's another world and you don't have to leave very far. It's right with you. It's It's right around you. &gt;&gt; It's just in another dimension. &gt;&gt; It and it seems like it's millions of miles away be because we have nothing to contact with. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And so mortal man just common sexorn uh mortal man is so oblivious to it. &gt;&gt; The sinner thinks that this is life. He lives for this life. He invests everything that he has, his energy, his time, everything into this life because he doesn't know that there's a greater life than this. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram called this body a pest house. He said, "We live in a pest house." &gt;&gt; And and you know, I looked up the pest house. It's a shelter or hospital for those infected with with uh pest nential or whatever or contagious diseases. And and he says the pest house that we live in, it just catches every disease that floats through. kind of been dealing with that, you know, in this weather change, sore throat and all all of that cuz we just living in a pest house. &gt;&gt; He says it's just full of sickness and disease and disappointment and trouble. &gt;&gt; But Jesus has gone to prepare a place. Who who would want to stay in this old body? &gt;&gt; How can they say we're in the millennium in this old body? &gt;&gt; That that is this world is full of trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's because they have not been able to contact that other world. So they're trying to make a millennium out of this. So he prepares a place and promises that he'd come back and receive us. Brother Ram said it's a perfect place. Everybody say it's a perfect place where no evil exists, no sickness exists, no age exists or no old age, no death exists. It's a perfect place calling you to that perfection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, there are fish that swim way down deep in the ocean, a mile deep or more, and they're just now discovering things in in the ocean. And you know, if you watch documentaries or whatever, it's really cool. And but you go way down, you know, they they go way down in there and they with their lights and stuff and and it's so pitch dark. It's it's it's just like ink black dark. Black ink dark or whatever. And and and these fish have no eyes because it'd be no good to them. They they can't see nothing. It would do no good because that's where they abide. and and so but they got to eat. And so they're guided by another sense uh radar or whatever to where they could they they they could go and find their their way through and and and eat and and these things and uh uh these things. But the prophet says, "What if a human could could control that fish with his sight?" &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, if I could do that," he said, "I I would be able to help that fish out to get more food than what it does. I I would be able to lead it around if I could control him with my sight because my sight is greater than the radar that he has. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; But see, it's impossible for for that fish to surrender itself over to humanity. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But then the prophet says, "But what if we could only surrender ourselves to God?" &gt;&gt; Now we have that ability. The fish cannot surrender itself to humanity to where humanity could take over and control it. But we actually have the ability to surrender to God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and his sight, his senses are far greater than ours. That's right. &gt;&gt; We can only our senses only contact this world. [Music] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But see, God could guide us better to where take us to things that are far better than our natural eyes and our natural senses can detect. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophet says the faith that he supplies us uh is the evidence of things not seen with our eyes. Can you say amen? Now we know that that fish cannot come to the to the top of the water because he's pressurized to where he's to be where he's at. And and if he were to ever come up, he'd just explode. And and and the prophet says we can't go any higher than what we are because we're pressurized to live in the place that we're living. If we would go way up there, you know, we would explode and and these things without uh uh help and aid and things like that. See? See? And and so that fish, you know, the prophet said, "If that fish that lives way down in the ocean so dark, that's all he knows. If he could come up and be one of us, he would never want to be that little fish again. &gt;&gt; He would never want to go back into the darkness again and and be what he's always been. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. Because he has actually become something greater than than a fish. He's become a man and his senses are greater. His understanding is greater. His intelligence is greater. And brother Bram says, multiply that by 10 million. Then you get what it is. When you pass from this into the presence of God where the human being is so much, he says, farther than what we are here, he said, you'd never want to be a human being like this no more down in this pest house of sickness and corruption. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. But see, so so he says what we're trying to do is tell the people that there's a heaven to gain, a hell to shun, and there is a God that loves them and is there there's a redeeming power that's laying here ready to pick them up at any time. They're ready to receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the thing of it is is that fish has no desire to be one of us because it doesn't know us. It doesn't comprehend our world. It's used to its world. A world of darkness. A world of no light. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; You could try to talk to it and say, "Yeah, if you you you just need to be like I am, it it would have no desire." &gt;&gt; A lot of times, God talks to humanity the same way. &gt;&gt; And man don't have that desire to come up. Can you say amen? Because there's nothing in that little fish. There's nothing within him calling for something greater. He doesn't know that there's a greater life than what he's living. And if he ain't got nothing in him calling for something greater, then he's just going to be what he is. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, it would have to be a life within him that's not part of him. &gt;&gt; That's right. a greater life than what he is. &gt;&gt; Be in him calling for something calling for it. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; A life that doesn't come from his world. Now the place that Jesus has prepared is a fairy tale to the carnal mind. &gt;&gt; The rapture is a fairy tale. Everything that we talk about and live for it is just a fairy tale. And this is why the Christian life is very strange to the world. You know, men of old uh just like you and I, they they wrote of of the future and things that are to be. They had faults like you and me. They they went through discouragements like you and I have and and all that. But not only did they write of it, they were persuaded of it. the things the future. They wrote of the future. They wrote of these things that are to be and and they believed in it and were persuaded. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11:13. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them a far off. Seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. Can you say amen? Oh, do you love him? &gt;&gt; How how could natural men write of things that they cannot contact? They have no way to see with the natural eye. They have no way to understand uh th these things and and all of that. But here second Peter 1:21 gives the answer. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? A greater life than more than than mortal life came on them and began to speak through them of things that are to be. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Wonderful. See, as Christians, we talk about things that do not exist in our world. We we we believe in them. We're persuaded of them. &gt;&gt; Hey, church, there's going to be a marriage supper of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a table &gt;&gt; on &gt;&gt; that we're going to set at &gt;&gt; and we're going to be there when this world is under judgment. &gt;&gt; Where is it? I don't know. But there's something in me that says it's there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's come &gt;&gt; to receive me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he's in me and he's speaking of the things he's prepared. &gt;&gt; You going to sit at that marriage supper table. &gt;&gt; I'll be there. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said over and over, it's there that he's going to dry our eyes. Sister Janice, all of our tears and all that. And &gt;&gt; he's going to come by every one of us sitting at that table. He's going to say, "Don't weep no more. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; It's over." &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for that. Amen. There there's a place where the saints have gone. They didn't go out of existence. They're there and and they're walking on solid ground. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon went up there. &gt;&gt; He was he was caught in over into the curtain of beyond the curtain of time and he saw them. &gt;&gt; They were running. &gt;&gt; They weren't just floating. They were somewhere and they weren't here. &gt;&gt; But he said wherever he was, he looked down. He could see that old body in the bed. He was in another body, for he had hair. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; And all of these people that had gone before, they were young again. &gt;&gt; They talked. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They laughed. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we sing and preach about heaven. And we're not speaking of some fictitious place, but heaven is a real place. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; It's just it's it's just as real as this is. And the prophet said, "For God started us in our spiritual growth in this place." He said, "We don't set up in heaven for eternity and just sit there on a cloud. We don't just strum our harp all from here ever, but we're going to a real place where we're going to do things where we're going to live. We're going to work. We're going to enjoy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to live. We're going to life to a real eternal life. We're going to a heaven of paradise. Just like Adam and Eve worked and lived and ate and enjoyed and in the Garden of Eden before sin came, we're on our road right back there again. The first Adam through sin taken us out. The second Adam through righteousness brings us back in again. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And truly, there's no way for a sinner to comprehend it. There's no way for just a religious man to comprehend these things. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But a believer has new life. And that life within him speaks of a new world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that he would have never caught. But the life contacts him. &gt;&gt; He has contact with the outside world. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; David described it as the deep calling unto the deep. Brother Ram said, "The same Holy Spirit that led the children of Israel is leading us up into that waters yonder somewhere." That same pillar of fire that led Israel is here leading us &gt;&gt; to a land yonder somewhere. &gt;&gt; You believe it? Amen. &gt;&gt; People can't understand it, but it's there. As long as a human heart calls for it, there's got to be something there to respond to it. &gt;&gt; The deep calls to the deep. I'll send mine angel before you to lead you into the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; We know these things. But new life comes by spiritual birth. And this this new life is not of this natural life. It doesn't speak of this natural life. And we know it that when a mother is expecting a child, most the time she begins to crave things that she normally wouldn't crave. But she craves something. It it's it's a life that's in her, but it's apart from her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Her own life. It's it's another life. And and yet that life isn't different from her life because it's come through the same way her life has come through. A sexborn life. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And and so that life conceived in her. Amen. It's of the earth. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And and so the prophet talks about our natural birth being pre-planned by God. He knew that we were going to come. And and before we got here, before the first man came, God created this earth, God created everything for us. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Everything for us. And then when the child is in that mother's womb, it's craving something. It ain't craving things from the from Mars. It ain't craving things from Jupiter. It ain't craving things from way off out in some alien space. &gt;&gt; It's craving things of the earth because God prepared the earth for it &gt;&gt; for that baby for us. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And and so so here we find Amen. The prophet said, see it's her the body her body the calcium and so forth of her body the vitamins that she needs. Juny is being made up or we'll say Zane &gt;&gt; is being made up and he craves for things foods for this coming child. How the parents they try to get it so the baby will be born as perfectly and happy as possible. &gt;&gt; See how your parents will do that when there's something needed the mother gives witness of it. her system is made up and that's how that when there's something needed here to the oncoming child, the mother begins to crave for it. &gt;&gt; But it's not her craving it. It's the life in her &gt;&gt; that's calling for it. &gt;&gt; And they can get it because the earth was prepared for its arrival. &gt;&gt; Hope you understand. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, when when the life of God comes in us, &gt;&gt; oh yeah, &gt;&gt; it's not craving the bar, &gt;&gt; it's not craving entertainment. &gt;&gt; It's not craving the things of this world. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; It's craving another world. And the only reason it can crave it is because there's a real place &gt;&gt; that's been prepared. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, you have to have eternal life in order to be a son and daughter of God. You were born from your mother's womb, a child of your parents. But that didn't make you a child of God. &gt;&gt; You were just naturally born sexorn in a pest house that attracted all kinds of things. You had your faults, your mistakes, your scars, and you know, you just you battle and Satan fights you and all of these things. But then that seed gene of God is inside of you. &gt;&gt; It doesn't need another body. It takes your body. &gt;&gt; God placed that in your body. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And then he comes and quickens that seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's the only way you can become a son or daughter of God &gt;&gt; is that seed to be quickened. A son and daughter of God has a different life. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's controlled by another life &gt;&gt; than sexorn life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. So, Brother Brown says to be a son of God, you had to be in him always. The gene of your life, spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule. And you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God. Now, you're expressed after his word has come into you to light up this age. You're you are expressing God's life in you because you're a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and so then not only did God know that you would be here by your natural birth, &gt;&gt; but he also knew you to be a gene seed of his own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And at some point in your earthly journey, that gene seed was quickened to life, new life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And what you thought was life here, all of a sudden, you realize there's a greater life than this. &gt;&gt; There's a greater life. You'll never get that fish down there to understand there's a greater life. God somehow made it possible that his life could come into you which is a greater life than your sexorn life and be called and begin to call for something greater. &gt;&gt; Greater. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Greater. That's why you can't be satisfied in the world. When a person's got a new birth, he's born again. He can't be satisfied. He may make mistakes but he'll rise up again because the new life is crying for another world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So at that time you become a dual person like Jesus was. The natural part of you is earthbound. The eternal part of you is heaven bound. There were times that Jesus grown with a headache. There were times that he was hungry. There was times that he was thirsty. There was times that he fought sickness and disappointments and discouragements and he felt lonely and he would cry and and all of these things. But then there were times that he would speak with authority and the dead would rise up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; He would turn the water into wine. He walked on that water. Walked on the water. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Died as a man and yet rose as God. God. He raised himself up again. Can you say amen? Brother Brown said there's time he spake as a man. Other times it'd be God speaking. &gt;&gt; See, so he says, see, when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly, um he the man person becomes then a two-fold being. One of the earth to die and one of heaven to live. In his body, he's still subject to death, but in his soul, he's passed from death into life. In his body, he has his earthly contact with his five senses. But in his spirit, he has a contact with God through the Holy Ghost. And the angels of God visits them and speaks with them. And they are messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual. Can you say amen? Amen. See, this is why we believe in the message of the hour. It was God speaking through a man and it's God in us believing that what was said through that man. &gt;&gt; It's a it's a supernatural fellowship. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In closing, the natural side of us lives by earthly substance. The spir spiritual side of us lives by the word. Brother Brandham says before the little baby is born, it's craving for some vitamin. And the mother's words speak forth. Dad, I want a cantaloupe or watermelon. I want something or another. See? Why? He'll do everything he can to get that because he knows that he wants his child born as perfect as it can be. And he'll do everything that he's able to do to get it. How much more aler is he, God, to get it? &gt;&gt; He's a creator. &gt;&gt; Something down inside of you calling for something. It's not of this life, but don't worry about it. God sees it. &gt;&gt; Your heavenly father knows and he can speak the creative word and supply it. He said, "See now think how able he is to prepare us a body to live like his own glorious body if we want to live. There is something in us called to live. And there is something in us that calls to do right. Then God will come call somebody on the platform or the pulpit that will preach the absolute truth." Why? See, it shows you. Then if you're a real child of God, you begin to cry out, "God, take it away from me." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You don't get mad. &gt;&gt; Wow. I can't believe he's preaching at me. No. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, God, just take it from me. &gt;&gt; Circumcise me from this. Take these things away from me." Why? It's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's gone on to prepare for you've got to be a real word bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's why we can't believe in something that's not of the word. We We're not gullible. We have to take the full word of God. Ain't that right? So he says, "How can the Holy Spirit make you believe a creed that you that that you have to do something like this when the Bible said something else? We have to join a church and do this or do that when the Bible plainly tells you what to do." Then when you see that capital T and you jump right into it, capital I, you're right with it, then just keep moving right on up and it just grows like a germ coming into the womb of a woman with the egg. See, then when that little egg begins to develop and begins to bring forth germs, it don't put one human germ and a dog germ and a cow germ. It puts all human germs. Cell on top of cell. Can you say amen? And when a child of God, he says when that predestinated, that's a bad word to use. He said, but it's God. Here is God's Bible. The fornowledge of God can predestinate make everything work to his honor. And when that predestinated sea that you was that you was to be and God called you and that little eagle of a seed in there heard the word of God, it will build on top one word on top of the other one on top the other one on top of the other one. Can you say amen? And and that life is developing and becoming stronger and stronger and stronger. and everything that you need God &gt;&gt; has prepared it. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the musicians will comeless &gt;&gt; I love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that God knows and he's an ontime God. &gt;&gt; Everything that he has done, he's prepared. He had the lamb prepared before we needed it. Because he knew we would need it. He had healing prepared before we even got sick because he knew we'd need it. He prepared everything. And not only that, but he's prepared a body. And as Paul says, we have an if this earthly body be dissolved, this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one waiting. And brother Bram said, "It's already waiting. It's there." And I like that. Um, if I could read it to you, cuz I I think it's it's pretty cool. It's already waiting. See, so the prophet says, "Now, what if you didn't have the sight? You just had taste, feel, smell, and hear, and somebody received their sight and said, "There's another world, son." Them feelings, you bump into things, and what it is can tell you what it is. Why? You'd think the person was crazy cuz you don't have that sense of sight. Nobody ever had it that you know of. See, you've heard of people that said such things as that, but you doubted it. But we know by this sense that it's real. It's a real place. It's a place. See, your sense declares that. Now, the only thing you do when you die, you just change those five senses and you just receive another sense. You're alive with a higher sense a thousand times higher than this. The five senses that we have, the sense that you receive over there is a thousand times higher. It's just in another life. A life where there's no death, there's no sorrow. And the things that you don't know nothing about now, you see it plainly when you cross there. You don't understand it now because you're bumping into it. You haven't got that sense. So, we may not be able to see a heaven. We may not be able to see the angels. We may not be able to see those things, but we're bumping bumping into it. And and the prophet said, "See," he said, "you say, I feel a strange feeling here tonight. It looks like there's," he said, "I just want to cry and shout or something." He said, "It's the angels of the Lord. You're bumping like somebody say, you know, that never did have the sense of sight." Say, "Well, once in a while, I feel something real like a warmth feeling like warmth." And then you say, "It's sunlight." cuz you got the eyes to see. They don't. So, you're looking at it, they're feeling it, and you see it. And you tell them it's the sun shining upon you, right? Well, what is the sunlight? I never did see it. See, he never did see. He don't know what it is. See, someone over there has to tell him somebody that can see it. So, we just change. We just change. Don't be afraid of death. Death ain't nothing but a scarecrow. Jesus conquered it. Even when Paul come down at the end, he said, "Death, where's your sting? Where's your scare? Grave, where's your victory? You say you got me?"
