[37:45] um uh we'll read the 10th verse but it
[37:49] says I have also spoken by the
[37:52] prophets and I have multiplied visions
[37:55] and you
[37:58] similitudes um by the ministry of the
[38:02] prophets amen let's just uh bow our
[38:07] heads and talk to our
[38:09] Lord precious Lord how we
[38:14] have just found a delight to come to
[38:18] your house this
[38:20] morning realizing that we could be
[38:23] anywhere Lord um but it was you it was a
[38:27] Divine
[38:29] calling that would bring us to the house
[38:31] of God this morning and to magnify you
[38:35] to glorify you but Lord also to hear
[38:39] from you father we're asking Lord that
[38:42] you would speak now through these mortal
[38:46] lips father and you know what you would
[38:51] have to say and help me to get myself
[38:54] out of the way Lord and may your people
[38:56] be edified draw us all
[38:59] closer Lord if there's anything in our
[39:02] lives that's not pleasing to you I pray
[39:04] Lord that you would just cut it out of
[39:06] us father and may we be more molded into
[39:10] you and your likeness father for we see
[39:13] that's your purpose that's your goal and
[39:16] father we are the people there's no
[39:18] other people on the
[39:20] Earth uh in in time we see that time is
[39:24] is winding up father father there's no
[39:27] other age there's no other messenger we
[39:29] we at Lord And may we do all that we can
[39:35] Lord uh for your kingdom and Lord and
[39:38] may we surrender more than ever to your
[39:41] word we ask these things in your lovely
[39:44] name Jesus Christ amen and
[39:48] amen you can have your seats this
[39:52] morning I enjoyed the songs and the
[39:55] worship
[39:57] uh today and the um you know the song
[40:02] service is to create an atmosphere sure
[40:06] um for the word to um have an effect the
[40:12] spirit comes upon the word and ministers
[40:15] it to the
[40:17] congregation and so song service is
[40:21] important and it's not just coming up
[40:24] and singing but it's it's there's you
[40:26] know as it's been said there's a
[40:29] difference in a song leader and a
[40:30] worship
[40:31] leader uh to lead the people into
[40:34] worship that's right uh is is uh
[40:39] important and so uh we we find that the
[40:43] word is of utmost importance more than
[40:47] anything it's it's the word of God cuz
[40:50] you you you've got to build your life
[40:53] upon the word nothing nothing else you
[40:56] you you can't build it upon Sensations
[40:58] you can't build it upon a gift you can't
[41:00] build it upon anything your faith must
[41:02] be anchored in the
[41:04] word I want to continue on this subject
[41:07] of of ministry and
[41:12] um uh probably just go over things that
[41:15] we already know uh but it's good to be
[41:19] reminded of of what God has done in this
[41:22] day and why he has done it and uh here
[41:26] in our opening scripture we we the Lord
[41:31] talks about the ministry of prophets the
[41:34] ministry and
[41:37] and we the more I study the message
[41:41] and uh the more I see what God has
[41:45] done it's it's just leaves me um
[41:49] Spellbound that God would choose me uh
[41:52] for this age and to be able to to hear
[41:56] the voice of a prophet and to believe it
[42:01] there are a lot of things that I could
[42:03] say about prophets and uh but I won't be
[42:06] able to cover everything
[42:08] today uh
[42:10] but in the Book of Genesis we we read
[42:14] where God spoke uh using his own mouth
[42:18] and there in Genesis 1 and one through
[42:23] three and and you can read the the whole
[42:25] chapter but in the beginning God created
[42:28] the Heaven and Earth and the Earth was
[42:30] without form and void and darkness was
[42:33] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[42:36] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[42:39] and God said let there be light and
[42:42] there was light there was no Prophet
[42:45] there was nothing there for him to speak
[42:47] he spoke it himself let there be light
[42:51] and there was light and you you look in
[42:55] Hebrews the 11 th chapter the third
[42:57] verse it says through faith we
[42:59] understand that the worlds were framed
[43:02] by the word or the voice of God so that
[43:06] things which are seen were not made of
[43:09] things which do appear so the word of
[43:13] God that he spoke out of his mouth it
[43:16] was a creation and not a
[43:19] multiplication so God spoke his word and
[43:23] things came into existence by creation
[43:26] and and the word creation is the action
[43:29] or process of bringing something into
[43:33] existence so at one time it wasn't but
[43:36] now it is what caused it the word of God
[43:40] God would speak and and and bring it to
[43:43] pass he did not need something to
[43:45] multiply like Jesus Took the the Loaves
[43:48] and the fish and he created by
[43:51] multiplication he would take what he had
[43:53] and he multiplied it but in the
[43:56] beginning there was no multiplication
[43:58] because he had nothing to work with he
[44:01] just spoke his word and so God created
[44:05] the Earth and like the prophet would say
[44:08] the the the the the the chairs and the
[44:11] the pews that you're setting on is is uh
[44:14] uh the creation of God um this this
[44:18] pulpit and and everything that you see
[44:21] around you it's it's it come by a
[44:25] creation and and so the prophet said his
[44:28] spoken word brought the material into
[44:31] the Earth the word of God Amen the word
[44:34] of God brought the material into the
[44:38] Earth and so he says in another place
[44:42] how little it is to disbelieve God's
[44:44] word amen it's insulting to disbelieve
[44:48] God's word it's little to disbelieve
[44:51] God's word when everything we see was
[44:55] made by his spoken word he just spoke it
[44:59] into existence that's how powerful the
[45:03] word of God is and and when God speaks
[45:07] something it's when and that word is
[45:09] direct amen it's going to happen it's
[45:12] going to produce it does not matter how
[45:15] how strange it looks it does not matter
[45:17] how impossible it doesn't matter if
[45:20] there's no sign positive for it to
[45:23] happen God will create it and he can and
[45:26] he has and so of course a word is a
[45:31] thought expressed it all originated
[45:35] before God would speak his word it all
[45:37] originated in in his mind and so the
[45:41] prophet said if he said he was the lamb
[45:43] slain from the foundation of the world
[45:46] well that's the very moment that God
[45:50] perceived the thought and the thought
[45:53] was created by God himself
[45:56] amen so they're creative thoughts amen
[45:59] and every time God makes a thought it's
[46:02] a creation and when he speaks it it
[46:05] becomes a reality so every word of this
[46:09] Bible is God spoken creative thought and
[46:12] every time it's taken into the right
[46:15] ground it'll be made
[46:17] manifest ain't that right so another
[46:20] place he says how great God does in his
[46:23] word how that even before the world was
[46:26] formed God In His Infinite mercy and in
[46:30] his
[46:31] infiny uh uh infancy he said see he
[46:34] foresaw all things he foresaw it before
[46:38] he even spoke it he already forsaw it
[46:42] and the Bible says in the beginning was
[46:44] the word and the Word was with God the
[46:46] Word was God and now the word becomes
[46:50] part of himself and then a word is a
[46:53] thought expressed so when God saw where
[46:56] his fellow worker with him Satan which
[46:59] was the son of the morning had deceived
[47:01] him in a way now now he he already saw
[47:04] it would happen he it was already done
[47:07] before Satan actually done it but had
[47:09] deceived him in a way see that he had
[47:12] entrusted him with great things and he
[47:14] had perverted what God had created to
[47:16] make evil out of it see God thought the
[47:19] whole thing in his mind and then when he
[47:22] spoke it it become true and become it
[47:26] become part of him and can never fail
[47:28] it's him he is the word so God before
[47:32] the foundation of the world knew that
[47:35] you would be here right it's it's it it
[47:38] was a creative thought in his mind so it
[47:41] already happened then and now it's just
[47:43] now becoming a reality in time but he he
[47:48] said see he knew you by name before the
[47:51] foundation of the world think of it many
[47:53] times we sing the song new name written
[47:55] down in glory tonight see well it was an
[47:58] error it was written down before there
[48:01] ever was a human being on the earth your
[48:04] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[48:07] Life can you say amen amen there is a
[48:10] name written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[48:13] and it's mine it's mine can you say Amen
[48:16] so he said see the Bible said that Jesus
[48:19] was the Lamb of God slang before the
[48:21] foundation of the world it took 4,000
[48:25] years
[48:26] for that to materialize but 4,000 years
[48:29] later he was actually slain but when God
[48:32] spoke the word in the beginning he was
[48:34] slain right then because God's word
[48:37] cannot fail so acts 15 and 18 it says
[48:42] known unto God are all his works from
[48:45] the beginning of the world so there is
[48:48] nothing new there is nothing out of
[48:50] cater there is there there everything is
[48:53] right on time and he thought it before
[48:57] the foundation of the world ain't that
[49:00] right so God in the creation created the
[49:03] world first by his thought amen then
[49:09] spoke it and the thought became uh the
[49:12] thought expressed became material so
[49:15] again God in the creation created the
[49:17] world by his thought first then spoke it
[49:21] and the thought expressed became
[49:23] material amen see so that that's what
[49:26] made you Sons is his thinking that's
[49:29] what made you what you are is his
[49:31] thinking he he had that in his thoughts
[49:34] ain't that right amen so God created the
[49:38] heavens and the Earth by by the thoughts
[49:42] of his mind and by the word of his mouth
[49:46] amen he created it by the thoughts of
[49:48] his mind and by the word of his mouth
[49:52] amen another place he was God the L God
[49:55] the word that went out of God when he
[49:57] began to brood upon the Earth and
[50:00] brought forth marine life when the
[50:02] spirit of God the logos the word which
[50:05] God said let there be and there went the
[50:08] Loos which is the word amen and the word
[50:12] began to he said see because all this
[50:15] was in the logos see the whole word of
[50:18] God the whole Bible for every age and as
[50:21] the lust began to breathe upon the Earth
[50:25] there come Marine uh marine life and
[50:28] building up the bird life and on up to
[50:31] animal life and finally there comes
[50:33] something in the representation or look
[50:36] like the thing that was brooding it or
[50:38] Brewing it and uh brooding over it God a
[50:42] man in the very image of God ain't that
[50:45] right so so God would create it all by
[50:48] his word it it was brought into
[50:51] existence by his word God would speak it
[50:54] because there was nothing else to to
[50:55] speak it but him amen and so God in the
[50:59] beginning the prophet would tell us that
[51:01] when he thought of you and thought of
[51:03] others like that he thought of himself
[51:06] of being tangible ain't that right amen
[51:09] think of that when he thought of you he
[51:12] thought of himself being tangible amen
[51:14] not separate from you but one with you
[51:17] amen he he he now now we we look at him
[51:21] as as being the lamb and thinking of
[51:23] himself in in Jesus Christ
[51:25] and he was God in Christ ain't that
[51:28] right amen but now he you were part of
[51:31] that thought that he would think of
[51:33] himself being tangible amen not in that
[51:37] day but this day I'm so glad for that
[51:40] amen see and and so he thought of
[51:43] himself being tangible that was his
[51:45] thoughts he expressed his thoughts by
[51:48] word let there be let there be and there
[51:52] was let there be and there was a a't
[51:55] that right so God kept saying let there
[51:59] be amen until the uh a People Israel on
[52:04] the earth said don't speak to us no more
[52:08] amen we we don't want God to speak amen
[52:11] so then God adhered to that he he heard
[52:15] what they were saying and he says okay I
[52:17] ain't going to speak that way I won't
[52:19] speak to you but I will raise up a
[52:21] prophet amen and I will take that man
[52:25] and I will speak amen the very same
[52:27] words of Life the same power the same
[52:30] omnipotent the same Authority amen it'll
[52:34] be the same word but it'll now be spoke
[52:37] through mortal lips ain't that right and
[52:39] so the prophet would tell us and the
[52:41] prophet said there shall come and there
[52:44] will be and it was and it was and it was
[52:48] and it was just like that ain't that
[52:51] right amen God didn't have to say thus
[52:53] sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord but
[52:55] now a prophet would rise up thus sayith
[52:57] the Lord and it was and thus say the
[53:00] Lord this shall happen and it did ain't
[53:02] that right so God would raise up a
[53:05] Ministry of prophets that would be his
[53:08] agents Amen to speak the word of the
[53:10] Lord to his people amen for as we know
[53:14] the word of the Lord comes to the
[53:16] prophet ain't that right prophets are
[53:19] predestinated to be what they are they
[53:22] they don't eventually come into a gift
[53:25] amen uh uh it it's like the spirit of
[53:28] Prophecy someone can prophesy amen and
[53:31] the prophet said he could they they
[53:32] could prophesy one time and never be
[53:34] used again to prophesy amen that's
[53:37] that's just the way it is amen uh uh
[53:40] there's gifts and there's things that
[53:42] work in the church but a prophet is
[53:44] predestinated to be a prophet he's born
[53:47] with that gift amen even at 2 years old
[53:50] brother Brandon was seeing visions amen
[53:53] and and and he he didn't even know
[53:55] anything about it he said he was packing
[53:58] moonshine from a steel uh for for his
[54:01] daddy you see and but yet the gift was
[54:05] there because they were predestinated to
[54:07] be that amen so then then the coming of
[54:11] a prophet is a sign that God is ready to
[54:16] speak if there's a prophet on the earth
[54:19] is because God is ready to speak now I'm
[54:22] going to tell you amen see that's
[54:24] different than even a gift of Prophecy
[54:26] and all that a prophet is greater than
[54:28] the gift of Prophecy a prophet is
[54:30] greater amen than even a dream or a
[54:33] vision or or whatever amen speaking in
[54:37] tongues is fine but a prophet is greater
[54:39] ain't that right amen see so amen it's
[54:43] it's not the coming of a dream that God
[54:45] is ready to speak to his people it's not
[54:48] the coming of a prophecy that God is
[54:50] ready to speak to his people it's the
[54:52] coming of a prophet amen that is a sign
[54:56] that God is ready to speak Amos 3:7 says
[55:00] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[55:03] he revealeth his secrets to his servants
[55:08] the prophets ain't that right amen so
[55:10] God will not reveal God will not do
[55:12] anything without uh it it being first
[55:16] through a prophet so when God wanted to
[55:19] speak to the children of Israel what did
[55:21] he do send him a prophet that's right
[55:24] amen now we we understand that dream uh
[55:27] is secondary from a prophet uh just like
[55:30] in Joseph and Mary's uh situation Joseph
[55:33] was troubled about Mary's uh uh what she
[55:36] had said and and these things about the
[55:38] angel of the Lord and her conceiving and
[55:40] and these things and he was troubled by
[55:42] it well there was no prophet in the land
[55:44] so God gave him a dream but notice the
[55:48] dream did not need to be interpreted it
[55:51] did not leave Joseph in a mess when he
[55:53] woke up and said I don't know what this
[55:55] dream is about I need someone to
[55:56] interpret it I I I just don't know
[55:58] brother Brown said the dream was
[56:00] scriptural ain't that right it was
[56:03] scriptural it it didn't need no
[56:05] interpretation the dream took him to the
[56:07] scriptures Behold a virgin shall
[56:09] conceive and when he woke up he had his
[56:12] answer ain't that right and it was a
[56:14] scriptural answer so when when God
[56:18] wanted to forewarn Israel of coming
[56:21] danger a prophet would come on the scene
[56:24] if a man needed to hear from God he
[56:27] would go to the prophet of God if there
[56:29] was one at at at that time see on Earth
[56:33] amen see so there there again there is
[56:37] what the Bible calls the gift of
[56:39] Prophecy amen and but that is different
[56:42] from being a prophet again a prophet is
[56:45] predestinated and for ordained for the
[56:48] hour do you believe that well you you
[56:52] have to believe that if you're a message
[56:53] believer cuz the prophet just said it
[56:55] amen a prophet is predestinated and for
[56:59] ordained for the hour he doesn't come by
[57:02] chance he didn't come out of mistake God
[57:04] ordained it to be sold now a prophecy
[57:08] has to be judged by two or three
[57:11] Witnesses before the church is even to
[57:14] receive it that's what the Paul says and
[57:17] that's what brother Brandon backs it up
[57:19] see that's what he said see uh they it
[57:22] is to be judged by two or three
[57:23] Witnesses them Witnesses must be
[57:26] credible uh uh tried proven to be right
[57:30] amen and and and uh uh to see whether
[57:33] it's true or not that the dream the
[57:36] whatever prophecy or whatever before the
[57:38] church can receive it but nobody
[57:41] everybody say nobody set before a
[57:45] prophet because he was the ABS he was
[57:48] absolutely the word of God he has thus
[57:53] sayith the Lord who has thus sayith the
[57:56] Lord a prophet has thus sayth the Lord
[58:00] amen and see and yet brother Brandon
[58:02] would tell us a prophet is a sign that's
[58:05] overlooked by the people every time God
[58:08] would send a prophet with thus SI the
[58:11] Lord and in that within that Ministry of
[58:14] the Prophet is such power that it can
[58:17] create such power it's omnipotent power
[58:20] it's supreme power why he's got thus say
[58:23] the Lord the same power that brought
[58:25] nothing amen the world out of nothing is
[58:28] now being uh spoken through a prophet
[58:32] amen see so God has a way of doing
[58:35] things and has never changed it so a
[58:38] prophet is always everybody say always
[58:42] Amen brother BR said a prophet is always
[58:45] God's way of making his voice known to
[58:48] his people he is God's
[58:52] mouthpiece amen so then if if he's God's
[58:55] mouthpiece a prophet cannot say his own
[58:57] thoughts amen uh uh that's why if he
[59:01] didn't know any an answer to something
[59:03] he wouldn't tell you amen if if he
[59:05] couldn't see it in the word then he
[59:07] wouldn't give it to you he he he'd say I
[59:09] I can't see it in the word see amen so
[59:12] he just and I thank God for a prophet
[59:14] ain't that right see so a prophet cannot
[59:17] say his own thoughts he is a reflector
[59:20] of God's word and can only speak what
[59:24] God
[59:25] reveals so so uh uh even the prophet
[59:28] balam now of course we know what he was
[59:31] but uh uh he sold out for for money and
[59:34] popularity and all these things but yet
[59:36] he was a prophet and and he even said I
[59:39] must take heed to speak that which the
[59:42] Lord hath put in my mouth is that right
[59:46] amen and even when he did try to curse
[59:48] Israel he couldn't do it every time he
[59:50] opened his mouth he was blessing Israel
[59:52] amen because that was God's people and
[59:54] and and and the prophet he couldn't
[59:56] speak anything but what God had said
[59:59] amen see so uh uh and I like what
[1:00:02] brother Braham said you know uh balum
[1:00:04] was a false prophet amen but his his
[1:00:07] prophecy was
[1:00:08] true amen his prophecy was true so so uh
[1:00:13] uh or his teaching was wrong his
[1:00:15] prophecy was true so so uh uh John 10:35
[1:00:20] tells us that they were called Gods this
[1:00:23] Jesus refers to it they were called Gods
[1:00:26] unto whom the word of God came ain't
[1:00:30] that right amen see and the scriptures
[1:00:32] cannot be broken we find second Timo uh
[1:00:36] uh 2 Peter 1 and 20 it tells us that no
[1:00:39] Prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:00:42] private interpretation for the prophecy
[1:00:45] came not in Old Time by the will of man
[1:00:48] but uh holy men of God prophets spake as
[1:00:53] they were moved by the Holy Ghost ain't
[1:00:55] that right so now so so this Bible is
[1:00:59] the mind of God do you believe that why
[1:01:02] because it was the word of God it was
[1:01:05] spake and written by prophets amen this
[1:01:08] is not it uh uh King uh you know the the
[1:01:11] king uh James you know he translated it
[1:01:15] and things like that but this is proven
[1:01:16] to be the the the word of God Amen why
[1:01:20] how do we know that because we see the
[1:01:22] scriptures in this Bible being fulfilled
[1:01:24] uh uh uh left and right ain't that right
[1:01:27] amen so the Bible is God's thoughts that
[1:01:31] he had before the world began and and so
[1:01:35] the reason that God could say what would
[1:01:38] uh what will be on this printed word
[1:01:41] amen is is because he saw it uh uh
[1:01:45] before the world began in his thoughts
[1:01:48] and he knew just what would be and he
[1:01:51] spoke it out ain't that right see a
[1:01:55] prophet is not picking up the mind of a
[1:01:57] theologian he's not speak picking up the
[1:01:59] mind of a politician he's picking up the
[1:02:02] mind of God that them thoughts that were
[1:02:06] already preconceived before the
[1:02:08] foundation of the world and so this is
[1:02:11] the in the thoughts of God made known in
[1:02:13] written word amen see and so God handed
[1:02:18] down his knowledge to the prophets and
[1:02:20] they wrote it out so year by year the
[1:02:24] prophet said Century by Century we see
[1:02:26] it all coming to pass just exactly ain't
[1:02:30] that right so the whole plan of God was
[1:02:33] already laid out not now in his mind but
[1:02:37] prophets would pick up that mind and
[1:02:40] they would put it all right here in the
[1:02:42] word of God we don't need new
[1:02:44] translations we don't need other Bibles
[1:02:47] we don't need whatever else uh the book
[1:02:49] of the macbes and and all of these
[1:02:52] things everything you have need of is
[1:02:54] right here in the word of God Amen
[1:02:57] because it's the mind of God and so the
[1:03:00] prophet would tell us nothing has been
[1:03:03] put uh uh predicted or put in the
[1:03:06] scripture but what God already spoke it
[1:03:09] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:03:13] so we look at a scripture we're well
[1:03:15] known John 1:1 in the beginning was the
[1:03:18] word the word was with God and the Word
[1:03:22] was God ain't that right
[1:03:25] so the Bible is God before the
[1:03:27] foundation of the world Amen God back
[1:03:31] then this is the expression of God this
[1:03:33] is God this is the intent of God this is
[1:03:36] the motive of God this is the person of
[1:03:38] God this everything about God is written
[1:03:41] right here and it was written by
[1:03:44] prophets can you say amen that's right
[1:03:47] amen see so the bi brother brandham said
[1:03:50] the only reason it's written in here is
[1:03:53] prophets receiving from God for
[1:03:55] knowledge of his predestinated plan of
[1:03:59] the ages so so brother Brown said it's
[1:04:01] like a lawyer that that he wants to help
[1:04:04] his client and give all the information
[1:04:06] that he can to his clients so he'll
[1:04:08] study books and books and and get it all
[1:04:12] together uh gather up all this knowledge
[1:04:14] to help his client out well then brother
[1:04:17] Brown says see that's the prophets amen
[1:04:19] they are dedicated to the word of God
[1:04:22] they are dedicated to the mind of God
[1:04:24] they are dedicated these are dedicated
[1:04:26] channels that God could reveal himself
[1:04:29] and reveal his mind and reveal his
[1:04:31] intent amen it's it's by the way of
[1:04:34] prophets ain't that right so so the the
[1:04:37] the brother Brown said first the prophet
[1:04:38] goes to God and the word comes down and
[1:04:41] he wrote it in the Bible and now that
[1:04:44] was God's foreordained plan the prophet
[1:04:47] Saul and he wrote it in word so that the
[1:04:50] people following would be warned of
[1:04:53] situation and things to come aren't you
[1:04:56] glad you're warned amen why it's written
[1:04:58] right here in the word of God it's
[1:05:00] already been made known amen everything
[1:05:03] that's why we're not troubled about this
[1:05:05] world we're not troubled by America and
[1:05:07] the and Russia we're not troubled by
[1:05:10] politics we're not at least I'm not amen
[1:05:13] amen uh we're not troubled at what the
[1:05:15] prophet said you can put Abraham Lincoln
[1:05:17] in every County and still ain't going to
[1:05:19] help amen it just ain't going to do it
[1:05:21] amen people go to the bo voting booths
[1:05:23] and and and they're hoping they're
[1:05:25] they're praying they're rubbing the you
[1:05:26] know it's almost like rubbing the
[1:05:27] rabbit's foot and all that but whatever
[1:05:29] you do it ain't going to help go to go
[1:05:31] to the pope and let him sprinkle holy
[1:05:33] water on you I don't care what you do it
[1:05:35] ain't going to help amen we've already
[1:05:38] know the book can you sayen it already
[1:05:41] tells us why because this is not written
[1:05:43] by theologians this is not written by
[1:05:45] just great smart men God would take
[1:05:48] uneducated men and he would hold rise
[1:05:52] them up into the sphere to where they
[1:05:54] could catch his mind and then write it
[1:05:57] down this will happen and it will happen
[1:05:59] this and we're seeing it happen left and
[1:06:01] right in this age can you say amen amen
[1:06:06] so by inspiration that word amen was
[1:06:09] spoke by God and by inspiration the
[1:06:12] prophets brought it and by inspiration
[1:06:15] everybody say by inspiration we must
[1:06:19] receive it amen it was by inspiration
[1:06:22] that God spoke it was by inspiration
[1:06:25] that the prophets brought it to the
[1:06:26] people and it's by inspiration that we
[1:06:29] have to receive it we have to receive it
[1:06:32] ain't that right that's why you must get
[1:06:34] into through the spirit amen I think
[1:06:36] this is why the prophet taught us how to
[1:06:38] come to church and how to create an
[1:06:40] atmosphere and and and don't come to
[1:06:42] church tired amen so many people they
[1:06:44] stay up late on Saturday nights and and
[1:06:47] and wasting their time on all kinds of
[1:06:49] nonsense and then they come dragging in
[1:06:51] amen how you going to get in the spirit
[1:06:52] like that amen you got to get ready for
[1:06:55] the church you got to get ready for
[1:06:56] service you you got to come prepared why
[1:06:59] because God is wanting to say something
[1:07:02] and and and you cannot amen receive it
[1:07:05] it's just your old carnal mind you have
[1:07:08] to get into the spirit the inspiration
[1:07:10] to receive it can you say Amen it has to
[1:07:14] be received by inspiration this is why
[1:07:16] the carnal mind knows nothing about
[1:07:18] about it they know nothing about the
[1:07:20] Bible they know nothing about end time
[1:07:22] prophecy they know nothing about the
[1:07:24] restoration of the word they know
[1:07:26] nothing about the bride's Revival they
[1:07:28] know nothing about the headship of the
[1:07:30] word they see the world falling apart
[1:07:33] they see the marriages falling apart
[1:07:35] then their marriages may be falling
[1:07:37] apart amen they see that their homes are
[1:07:40] being Fallen apart their churches are
[1:07:41] falling apart amen the uh uh uh people's
[1:07:45] minds are falling apart and look what
[1:07:47] they're doing they're producing more
[1:07:48] literature amen than ever before and
[1:07:51] they're coming up with these more
[1:07:52] conferences than ever before but notice
[1:07:55] what the prophet said it's not a natural
[1:07:58] thing a natural thing ain't going to fix
[1:08:00] it your psychology ain't going to fix it
[1:08:03] your Bible training ain't going to fix
[1:08:05] it amen all these things ain't going to
[1:08:07] fix it Fellowship even amen ain't going
[1:08:10] to fix it if you ain't got the right
[1:08:12] channel it's not a natural thing and the
[1:08:15] prophet said or a material thing can you
[1:08:18] say Amen see but a man in his carnal
[1:08:21] conditions can never understand it no
[1:08:23] way at all it's impossible you cannot
[1:08:26] understand a what a prophet brings by
[1:08:29] carnal thinking can you say Amen you you
[1:08:32] just can amen why spiritual things are
[1:08:35] carnal uh are foolish to the carnal mind
[1:08:38] spiritual things are foolish to the
[1:08:41] carnal mind amen the prophet said see
[1:08:44] the man who sees the Visions or hears
[1:08:46] the voice of God never understood it now
[1:08:49] you think of that even a prophet didn't
[1:08:51] understand a lot of things he said
[1:08:53] didn't understand understand a lot of
[1:08:54] things that he saw I don't think that
[1:08:56] Isaiah could explain how a virgin was
[1:08:58] going to conceive all he but he was
[1:09:00] caught in the mind of God and was fully
[1:09:04] surrendered to God to speak a word that
[1:09:06] would cost him his
[1:09:08] [Music]
[1:09:11] life man didn't write the Bible see God
[1:09:14] wrote the Bible it's not a man's book
[1:09:16] it's God's book it is God's thoughts
[1:09:19] expressed through human lips that's what
[1:09:21] makes it the Bible a thought expressed
[1:09:24] is a word and in the beginning was God's
[1:09:27] thinking he expressed it through the
[1:09:29] lips of His prophets and confirmed it by
[1:09:32] his servants ain't that right so it's
[1:09:35] always at the end of the age that that
[1:09:38] the church turns uh to the world the
[1:09:41] prophet says and and sin and leans upon
[1:09:44] man's interpretation of the word now is
[1:09:47] that not what's happening today say that
[1:09:49] again the prophet says it's always at
[1:09:51] the End of the Age the church turns to
[1:09:54] the world and sin and leans upon man's
[1:09:58] interpretation of the word man cannot
[1:10:01] help this
[1:10:03] bride amen no matter how educated they
[1:10:07] are intellectual Minds cannot help this
[1:10:10] bride that's right he says they always
[1:10:12] get in such a mess by their the
[1:10:15] theologians and Priests until it's
[1:10:17] always a mess up ain't that right and
[1:10:19] their interpretation of the word is
[1:10:22] always everybody say always always wrong
[1:10:25] that's why you cannot bring now now you
[1:10:28] just have to excuse me I'm passionate
[1:10:30] about the message all right but you
[1:10:32] cannot preach a biligram message to this
[1:10:34] bride and find results that God is
[1:10:37] looking for you you you cannot that's
[1:10:40] that you cannot study the TD Jakes and
[1:10:42] the Benny hens and the and and and all
[1:10:45] of these commentaries and all that and
[1:10:47] try to bring the bride to a restoration
[1:10:49] it ain't going to happen it can't happen
[1:10:52] he can you say am men that's why we call
[1:10:54] ourselves message preachers we study the
[1:10:57] message we don't study the psychology to
[1:10:59] fix our marriages we don't study what
[1:11:02] these other guys are saying about how to
[1:11:04] how to how to redeem families and how to
[1:11:06] fix our children all that God sent a
[1:11:10] prophet
[1:11:11] [Music]
[1:11:13] amen so don't think for a moment that
[1:11:16] the devil won't try and hasn't been
[1:11:19] trying to infiltrate intellectual giants
[1:11:21] into this message to teach things
[1:11:24] contrary to what the prophet has taught
[1:11:26] us mark 13:21 If any man shall say to
[1:11:30] you Lo here is Christ or Lo he is there
[1:11:33] believe him not for false Christ and
[1:11:36] false prophets shall rise and show signs
[1:11:39] and wers to seduce if it were possible
[1:11:42] even the elect ain't that right and I I
[1:11:46] I I I want to maybe just for you young
[1:11:49] people sake but don't don't don't think
[1:11:53] that you got to go to every every
[1:11:57] Revival don't try to live on the
[1:12:00] highs cuz you'll never grow in the
[1:12:05] highs I believe in youth meetings I I
[1:12:07] believe in you know I believe in them
[1:12:10] things I believe in it but don't if your
[1:12:13] experience is going that way if that's
[1:12:15] what you're looking for it's almost like
[1:12:17] a a man that's hooked on drugs he's got
[1:12:19] to have it he's got to have it so in in
[1:12:22] other words to C with his problems and
[1:12:25] what he don't realize that is his
[1:12:27] problem am amen he becomes addicted to
[1:12:31] it so then they can't stand the test of
[1:12:34] time they can't just focus that's right
[1:12:39] hello it's true and we're finding that
[1:12:41] is more we're finding it more and more
[1:12:44] amen if you live just after Revival
[1:12:46] after Revival after Revival after
[1:12:47] Revival you'll become soft and Doty you
[1:12:49] won't be able to stand it's it's in The
[1:12:51] Valleys that you're going to grow it's
[1:12:53] it's in the pressures that you're going
[1:12:55] to grow it's in them times that you
[1:12:56] don't feel God that you're going to grow
[1:12:58] or at least you're that's where God put
[1:13:00] you to grow it's not always on the
[1:13:02] mountain
[1:13:04] tops can you say Amen so so don't be so
[1:13:07] gullible that we find well there's
[1:13:09] there's anointing and this is a Revival
[1:13:11] and this is happening and that's
[1:13:12] happening and and and you're looking and
[1:13:14] and and then the grass becomes greener
[1:13:16] on the other side
[1:13:20] hello where he says see Lo here is
[1:13:22] Christ and believe believe him not can
[1:13:24] you say man now now this bride is in a
[1:13:28] Revival ain't that right but it's it's
[1:13:31] not a church it's not a religion it's
[1:13:33] it's
[1:13:34] individuals
[1:13:37] individually amen can you say Amen
[1:13:40] individuals are are are in the Revival
[1:13:42] it's they're the Revival because that's
[1:13:45] the individuals are making up the bride
[1:13:47] now the bride cannot fall do you believe
[1:13:51] that the bride cannot fall for she is
[1:13:54] what predestinated not to fall so this
[1:13:57] is part of what God had in his mind
[1:14:00] ain't that right so the Bible is a book
[1:14:02] of mystery to the world and to the
[1:14:05] church this Bible is a book of mystery I
[1:14:09] you know there's so many people that
[1:14:10] reading this Bible over and over and
[1:14:12] through and through a year you know once
[1:14:14] a year and and all that but it don't
[1:14:17] matter how much you read it now we're
[1:14:18] not against reading it you must read
[1:14:21] your Bible you must the Bible is no good
[1:14:24] without a
[1:14:26] prophet and without you coming in the
[1:14:28] inspiration of the spirit of that
[1:14:31] Prophet The Spirit of the Prophet is God
[1:14:34] he's the prophet it's just a man ain't
[1:14:38] that right the prophet ain't God the
[1:14:41] prophet is uh or or the man ain't God
[1:14:44] God is the prophet brother Brown said
[1:14:46] the Holy Ghost is the prophet ain't that
[1:14:48] right so the Bible is a book of mystery
[1:14:51] it's it's a book of mystery you'll not
[1:14:52] be able to understand it and I I you
[1:14:56] just have to forgive me but we got so
[1:14:58] much entertainment in this age that that
[1:15:01] that that no wonder people ain't
[1:15:03] understanding
[1:15:06] nothing no wonder even the message ain't
[1:15:08] helping a lot of folks is because
[1:15:11] they're they're too busy with life
[1:15:13] entertainment all that they ain't got
[1:15:14] time to get in the spirit of God Amen
[1:15:17] and and and and but but but so the Bible
[1:15:20] is a book of ministry and yet brother
[1:15:23] said yet to the believer it's the
[1:15:25] revelation of God being revealed in the
[1:15:28] age we are living in the Bible is a
[1:15:32] mystery to the church natural to the
[1:15:34] world and and and even the message is
[1:15:38] see but to the True Believer it's the
[1:15:41] revelation of God being revealed in the
[1:15:44] age that we are living in that Jesus
[1:15:47] said my spirit or my word is spirit and
[1:15:50] life he also said that the word is a a
[1:15:53] seed that is s sold ain't that right so
[1:15:56] brother brand said it's God in word form
[1:15:59] and can only be interpreted by himself
[1:16:03] that's right so here and and I hope this
[1:16:05] making sense to you today but Hebrews 1
[1:16:08] and one uh Paul would tell us God who at
[1:16:12] Sund Dr times and in diverse manner
[1:16:14] spake in times pass unto the fathers by
[1:16:17] the
[1:16:18] prophets brother Brandon reads this and
[1:16:20] he says it didn't say Mortals of old as
[1:16:23] they stro across the Earth in Su times
[1:16:26] and divers manners but it God in suy
[1:16:30] times and divers manner revealed himself
[1:16:33] to His
[1:16:35] prophets God gave a revelation of
[1:16:38] himself to His prophets his Bible is all
[1:16:42] God can you say Amen Christ brother BR
[1:16:45] said if you read this Bible all the way
[1:16:47] through and don't see Christ in every
[1:16:49] part of it you've missed it y'all go
[1:16:51] back and read it again can you say man
[1:16:54] it isn't it isn't about the personality
[1:16:56] of a man it's of God the Revelation that
[1:16:59] came to them is God revealed to them
[1:17:02] written down in in word form so the
[1:17:06] human mind now is not capable of
[1:17:09] interpreting the mind of God it it's not
[1:17:13] it it's it's totally impossible we we
[1:17:16] can't interpret one another's mind let
[1:17:18] alone tried to interpret God's mind how
[1:17:21] how how can our fin mind interpreted in
[1:17:25] infinite mind ain't that right amen so
[1:17:28] now notice now Luke 10 and 21 in that
[1:17:32] hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I
[1:17:35] thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and
[1:17:37] Earth that thou has hid these things
[1:17:39] from the wise and prudent and has
[1:17:42] revealed them unto babes even so father
[1:17:45] for so it seemed good in thy sight say
[1:17:49] say it again thou Hast hid these things
[1:17:51] from the wise and the approv it and
[1:17:53] revealed them unto babes and Propet
[1:17:56] would say such as will learn such as
[1:17:58] will learn revealed it to people that
[1:18:00] want to learn Desiring to learn
[1:18:02] hungering if you hunger to know God God
[1:18:05] is obligated to F to fill it blessed are
[1:18:07] they that hunger and thirst after
[1:18:09] righteousness they shall be filled ain't
[1:18:12] that right if you're hungering for the
[1:18:14] right thing you'll be
[1:18:16] filled all things are delivered to me of
[1:18:19] my father and no man knoweth who the son
[1:18:21] is but the father and who the father is
[1:18:24] but the son and he to whom the son will
[1:18:27] reveal him see so the Revelation belongs
[1:18:31] to God and he is Sovereign in his
[1:18:33] Revelation he hides it from whoever he
[1:18:36] will and he reveals it to whoever he
[1:18:38] will but notice when the Revelation is
[1:18:40] made known it comes to a
[1:18:43] prophet the Lord come on now ain't that
[1:18:47] right now notice what a prophet the
[1:18:50] prophet said The only person everybody
[1:18:52] say the only only person that has a
[1:18:54] right to say thus sayth the Lord is a
[1:18:57] Vindicated Prophet don't forget it
[1:19:01] that's what a prophet just said that's
[1:19:03] what our Prophet just said The only
[1:19:05] person that has a right to say thus
[1:19:06] sayth the Lord is a Vindicated Prophet
[1:19:09] you never saw seen anybody judging
[1:19:12] Isaiah or Jeremiah or those people they
[1:19:15] were prophets for ordained and born in
[1:19:18] the world to be prophets they foresaw
[1:19:20] The Thing by a vision and then said thus
[1:19:23] sayeth the Lord for the Lord had already
[1:19:27] spoken it ain't that right so then when
[1:19:30] a man when a man says thus say the Lord
[1:19:34] see it's not it's not man speaking it's
[1:19:38] God speaking ain't that right then if
[1:19:40] it's thus say the Lord then it cannot
[1:19:43] fail a ain't that right it it cannot
[1:19:46] fail so you see what a prophet is doing
[1:19:49] he's taking the place of God that's
[1:19:52] right
[1:19:53] amen hello he's taken the place of God
[1:19:57] see now uh again if you notice the
[1:20:01] prophet in one sense of the word in the
[1:20:03] Old Testament when he said thus say the
[1:20:05] Lord now watch him he goes right into
[1:20:08] the phrase of taking the place of
[1:20:11] God Amen you notice when he placed out
[1:20:15] before him thus say the Lord he fell
[1:20:17] right into God and acted as God then he
[1:20:22] gave his m message which was God
[1:20:24] speaking through him thus sayith the
[1:20:27] Lord can you say Amen even the prophet
[1:20:31] said the prophet and his messenger is is
[1:20:34] and his message is one you cannot put
[1:20:37] the prophet apart from his
[1:20:39] message can't do it pick the message
[1:20:42] apart you're picking a prophet apart
[1:20:44] pick a prophet apart you're picking his
[1:20:45] message
[1:20:46] apart ain't that right it doesn't take a
[1:20:49] genius to know that that brother Brandon
[1:20:51] was just a man it takes a spiritual
[1:20:54] Revelation to know he was a prophet for
[1:20:56] this age and that it was more than just
[1:20:58] a man it was God in that
[1:21:00] [Applause]
[1:21:01] man ain't that right so when he when he
[1:21:05] said thus sayth the Lord he goes right
[1:21:07] into the phrase of taking the place of
[1:21:09] God now notice brother Brown said you
[1:21:11] are taking the place of God to pronounce
[1:21:14] something and he says see and before I
[1:21:17] would do that it had to come an answer
[1:21:21] from God see before he would say thus
[1:21:23] say the Lord he had had to hear from God
[1:21:26] first and he had to come down and he
[1:21:29] visibly showed himself and gave the
[1:21:32] Revelation it was not brother bram's
[1:21:34] Revelation as not much as it was in
[1:21:37] ezekiel's Revelation Moses Revel or
[1:21:39] anybody else's Revelation it was God's
[1:21:42] revelation because he would send a
[1:21:44] prophet and he would speak through that
[1:21:46] Prophet can you say
[1:21:49] Amen so people need to
[1:21:53] having discernment to know the
[1:21:54] difference between between thus sayth
[1:21:57] the Lord and impression right impression
[1:22:02] and and we're getting so many of this
[1:22:04] going on in this day uh uh uh where
[1:22:08] everybody's got thus sayith the Lord
[1:22:10] thus say the Lord thus say the Lord thus
[1:22:11] say the Lord and and and and uh you know
[1:22:16] and whatever is fine but but it's coming
[1:22:18] to a point where the people are
[1:22:19] dependent upon that on that than they
[1:22:22] are the
[1:22:24] message
[1:22:26] hello and and for for a person when when
[1:22:30] a again when a man says thus say the
[1:22:33] Lord it better happen amen but if he
[1:22:36] says thus say the Lord it ain't going to
[1:22:38] be vague that's right you can give the
[1:22:40] time it's going to happen you can give
[1:22:42] the color it's going to be you can give
[1:22:45] the day why it's God it's an infinite
[1:22:49] mind speaking I can say right now I can
[1:22:52] say some of you not feeling
[1:22:56] good all right come
[1:23:00] on I can say you
[1:23:02] know that's right some of you got going
[1:23:05] through some real battles but it's going
[1:23:07] to be
[1:23:10] okay the Bible already tells you it's
[1:23:12] going to be okay thank
[1:23:15] you
[1:23:16] hello amen see so you don't need someone
[1:23:20] to tell you thus sayith the Lord you
[1:23:23] don't need a prophecy you don't need a
[1:23:24] vision for that just take it by what the
[1:23:27] word
[1:23:30] says now we now I'm going to make it
[1:23:33] plain I know Skeptics that may be
[1:23:35] watching or whatever thinking I'm
[1:23:36] leaning some way I'm not I believe in
[1:23:39] gifts I believe in Prophecy Believe In
[1:23:41] Dreams believe in all them things but we
[1:23:44] don't take it to an extreme to where we
[1:23:46] forget that the word has already laid it
[1:23:50] there amen amen amen can you say Amen
[1:23:55] now brother Brad says how careful we
[1:23:57] must be that we remain remain True to
[1:24:00] this word and not take from it or add to
[1:24:02] it for he who would speak where God has
[1:24:05] not spoken makes him a liar yes so if
[1:24:09] we're going to represent God then we
[1:24:11] must represent his infinite mind that's
[1:24:14] why a Prophet come the Lord I'm
[1:24:18] satisfied with a
[1:24:21] prophet I'm satisfied with this
[1:24:25] message I don't have to guess whether it
[1:24:28] was of God or
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:32] not other people I might have to guess
[1:24:35] sir and wonder and
[1:24:37] question but a prophet is taking all the
[1:24:40] questions
[1:24:42] [Music]
[1:24:45] away cuz the prophet didn't make God a
[1:24:50] liar amen
[1:24:53] brother Braham says I cannot tell the
[1:24:55] interpretation of a dream until I see
[1:24:58] exactly by Vision what the dream was and
[1:25:01] many of you know that you told me your
[1:25:03] dream and would not even tell it
[1:25:06] all and when I saw the dream come back
[1:25:09] to me I turned around and told you that
[1:25:11] there was much of it you left out and
[1:25:13] then tell you uh what you left out of it
[1:25:16] you know that's right if that's right
[1:25:17] say Amen congre says amen see the things
[1:25:21] that you didn't tell me there therefore
[1:25:22] you see if like Nebuchadnezzar said if
[1:25:25] you can't tell me what I dreamed then
[1:25:27] how will I know you got the
[1:25:28] interpretation of it but all these
[1:25:31] Impressions we mustn't take them and say
[1:25:35] thus sayth the Lord amen we mustn't do
[1:25:38] that we must have a direct voice an
[1:25:41] answer from God before we can say it's
[1:25:44] God not an impression not a sensation no
[1:25:47] matter how much it's
[1:25:50] pulsating can you say Amen
[1:25:53] you might say I believe it could be this
[1:25:55] way but when you speak thus say the lord
[1:25:58] it's not you watch on the platform have
[1:26:00] you ever seen it fail thus say the Lord
[1:26:03] is perfect never has failed as long as
[1:26:06] it is thus sayth the Lord it cannot fail
[1:26:09] so far he's protected me because I've
[1:26:12] waited on him I haven't tried to seek
[1:26:15] popularity or vain Glory of men I've
[1:26:17] tried my best to live humble to live the
[1:26:19] kind of a life that I think a Christian
[1:26:21] should live I haven't been able to to do
[1:26:24] that within myself but he has done it
[1:26:26] until this day see as I say he is the
[1:26:29] one that's led me aren't you glad a
[1:26:32] prophet could be led yes sir see so now
[1:26:36] again God wrote his his the Bible by his
[1:26:40] own chosen way and that was by the
[1:26:42] prophets brother Brown said he chose the
[1:26:45] way his word would come and that was by
[1:26:48] His prophets which were predestinated
[1:26:50] and for ordained being a part of God's
[1:26:53] word declaring the revelation of his
[1:26:56] word to that age at that time never does
[1:27:00] it come to a theologian never does it
[1:27:02] come to a philosopher never does it come
[1:27:05] to an intellectual never does it come to
[1:27:08] a psychologist never does it come to the
[1:27:11] pope it comes to a
[1:27:14] prophet praise the Lord I believe God
[1:27:18] wrote the Bible by his own chosen method
[1:27:20] and his chosen method his Chosen and his
[1:27:23] own chosen prophets say that again God
[1:27:26] wrote the Bible by his chosen method and
[1:27:28] his own chosen prophets not the prophets
[1:27:30] man has chosen but the prophets God had
[1:27:34] chose we know that God chose him right
[1:27:38] had his picture taken with him I ain't
[1:27:40] seen no other man that's had his picture
[1:27:42] taken with him that God
[1:27:44] has Ministry whatever but God took his
[1:27:48] picture with a prophet Amen to tell us
[1:27:50] that I Vindicated this man
[1:27:53] his message ain't that right so so the
[1:27:56] prophet of our day God's chosen man is
[1:27:58] Malachi 4 notice then its Believers
[1:28:02] watch for the Fulfillment of what their
[1:28:05] Prophet said and that's identification
[1:28:09] that they are God's prophets because
[1:28:11] first they're inspired next they stay
[1:28:14] exactly with the word of the hour then
[1:28:18] that's his credentials ain't that right
[1:28:21] now what what is the ministry of a
[1:28:24] prophet to do we we talked about it uh
[1:28:27] the uh past few times amen and that is
[1:28:30] to chop out God's people praise the Lord
[1:28:35] and you say amen amen and I know I'm
[1:28:37] reading a lot of quotes but but I I
[1:28:40] guess that's fine with you it's fine
[1:28:41] with
[1:28:43] me uh but God said through Hosea I have
[1:28:46] hued see now watch Israel he's talking
[1:28:49] to I have hued or other words words I
[1:28:52] have chopped Cho them out through the
[1:28:55] prophets that's how God does his people
[1:28:57] he chopped them out from the rest of the
[1:29:00] Nations by what his two-edged sword his
[1:29:03] word he chopped them his Nation from the
[1:29:06] Nations he chopped his Nation from the
[1:29:08] Nations by the prophets his Vindicated
[1:29:11] words so has he chopped his bride from
[1:29:14] the denominations by his word promised
[1:29:18] by Malachi 4 not not by anybody else but
[1:29:21] by Malachi 4 can you say Amen in the
[1:29:25] last days chopped out his bride hewed
[1:29:28] her from the rest of the churches hewed
[1:29:31] out his bride can you say Amen now
[1:29:34] notice uh uh uh Second Corinthians
[1:29:38] actually go with me if you want to turn
[1:29:40] with me to 2 Corinthians 6
[1:29:44] and4
[1:29:47] um 2 Corinthians uh 6 and
[1:29:54] 14 yes sir praise the Lord you love the
[1:29:58] Lord
[1:30:00] amen
[1:30:02] 6:14 um be not unequally Yol together
[1:30:05] with unbelievers for what Fellowship
[1:30:07] hath righteousness with unrighteousness
[1:30:10] and what communion hath light with
[1:30:13] darkness and what Concord hath Christ
[1:30:15] with b or what part has he that
[1:30:18] believeth with an Infidel see and what
[1:30:21] agreement have the temple of God with
[1:30:23] Idols for ye are the Temple of the
[1:30:25] Living God as God hath said I will dwell
[1:30:29] in them think of that I will dwell in
[1:30:31] them and walk in them and will I will be
[1:30:35] their God and they shall be my people
[1:30:38] they shall be ain't that right wherefore
[1:30:40] this is the intent that God has and the
[1:30:43] motive and the passion is that God could
[1:30:45] be a God to them people and them people
[1:30:49] would be uh uh uh uh for him is can you
[1:30:52] say Amen they they will be his people
[1:30:54] and that I will be their God wherefore
[1:30:57] come out from among them and be ye
[1:31:00] separate sayith the Lord touch not the
[1:31:03] unclean thing and I will receive you and
[1:31:06] will be a father unto you and you shall
[1:31:09] be my sons and daughters sayth the Lord
[1:31:11] Almighty can you say Amen now think of
[1:31:14] it now then how are we we see the the
[1:31:17] passion the the the the the desire of
[1:31:20] God is that God could have people that
[1:31:22] would be his and he would be their God
[1:31:25] he would be their father they would be
[1:31:27] Sons and Daughters unto him come out and
[1:31:30] how do we come out by by a
[1:31:33] prophet a Prophet The Prophet's Ministry
[1:31:37] Cuts us out for such a thing to se of
[1:31:41] God would bless you and give you the
[1:31:44] grace that you could hear a prophet
[1:31:46] believe a prophet that God could be your
[1:31:50] God Amen Hallelujah hallu God could be
[1:31:54] your
[1:31:56] God Revelations 18:4 that's right and I
[1:31:59] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[1:32:01] come out of her my people that you be
[1:32:03] not partakers of her sins and that you
[1:32:06] receive not of her plagues amen you
[1:32:08] realize that voice from Heaven Is God
[1:32:11] speaking you believe that but what's he
[1:32:13] speaking through now a Vindicated
[1:32:15] Prophet it's not an Earthly voice it's a
[1:32:18] Heavenly voice it's more than just a
[1:32:20] voice of a man that is speaking these
[1:32:22] things it's God that is
[1:32:24] speaking come out come out can you say
[1:32:27] Amen why because there's an omnipotent
[1:32:30] power in that
[1:32:32] voice that would create a people when
[1:32:34] there's not a
[1:32:36] people create a bride when there's not a
[1:32:39] bride yes you believe it you cannot be
[1:32:44] what God wants you to be the way the
[1:32:46] world teaches

[1:32:50] Amen you cannot be God didn't call
[1:32:55] us I I say it this way God God didn't
[1:32:58] call us to be parents the way the world

[1:35:17] will drop you out hallelujah amen
[1:35:23] yes sir the
[1:35:24] truth when a man raises up with a sign
[1:35:27] the same old school of thought there's
[1:35:29] something wrong it isn't coming from
[1:35:32] God another place he says every true
[1:35:35] godsent sign has a voice amen and that
[1:35:38] voice must speak according to the word
[1:35:40] that's given for that day just exactly
[1:35:43] if the voice comes the same old voice of
[1:35:45] the same old he said you see a sign
[1:35:48] rather and the sign that the man is
[1:35:50] doing is the the same old school of
[1:35:52] thought then you can say right then that
[1:35:55] didn't come from God if it keeps
[1:35:58] identifying the same old school of
[1:36:00] thought it never did it never has it
[1:36:04] would be against God's program it's got
[1:36:06] to be something new it's got to be
[1:36:08] something that the people don't
[1:36:11] understand
[1:36:12] hello that's right it don't need to be
[1:36:15] sent if the same old school of thought
[1:36:18] if it's the same old School of Theology
[1:36:21] it's got to be something different yet
[1:36:23] it's got to be identified in the word
[1:36:25] that it is for that day see the
[1:36:28] positives of God's word it has to be
[1:36:32] that there's no slip UPS to it it's got
[1:36:35] to be the truth got to be Vindicated by
[1:36:38] God the truth and the man who speaks it
[1:36:41] has to be Vindicated of God to be a Seer
[1:36:43] from God or it's wrong
[1:36:47] amen they don't see it at all don't even
[1:36:50] believe it
[1:36:52] another place it must be a sign from God
[1:36:55] and if it is there's a scriptural voice
[1:36:57] behind it for the promise of that day
[1:37:00] not the same old school the the rabbis
[1:37:04] and things had been going through the
[1:37:06] schools and everything all along all
[1:37:09] along the priest and so forth but this
[1:37:12] is something new and it's scriptural and
[1:37:16] it's a promise stay with what God
[1:37:20] promised
[1:37:23] amen
[1:37:26] amen if a man gives a sign in a country
[1:37:29] or any time and that voice that he
[1:37:31] speaks
[1:37:32] behind isn't the word of God then want
[1:37:35] it don't believe it if some old school
[1:37:38] if a man gets up and says he shows a
[1:37:41] sign from God and then the man's
[1:37:43] teaching is the same old theology that
[1:37:45] you've had all these years God never
[1:37:47] sent that sign amen look back in the
[1:37:50] scripture and see if it was search the
[1:37:52] scripture the guy comes back and says
[1:37:54] now we all want to join this it's been
[1:37:56] an old established Affair don't you
[1:37:58] believe it God always vindicates his
[1:38:01] signs sign from God always speaks God's
[1:38:04] voice and if it's the same old school
[1:38:08] you've had why why why would he give a
[1:38:11] sign you're already in
[1:38:14] it that's right amen if if if what they
[1:38:18] are telling us how to fix everything our
[1:38:21] marriages our churches our our families
[1:38:23] our home
[1:38:25] ourselves our
[1:38:26] schools if if politics let's just take
[1:38:29] Pol if politics is the
[1:38:33] answer you're already in it come
[1:38:39] on then God wouldn't need to vindicate
[1:38:41] it brother Amos right you're already
[1:38:44] there
[1:38:46] true if denomination is the answer if
[1:38:49] psychology and all of them things is the
[1:38:52] answer we've already got
[1:38:56] it so when God sends something it's it's
[1:38:59] so
[1:39:01] mindboggling because it's against the
[1:39:03] mainstream that's right and people don't
[1:39:06] want to just
[1:39:11] surrender you know good and well you
[1:39:14] know good and well it's hard to break
[1:39:16] traditions you know good and well it's
[1:39:18] hard to break
[1:39:19] ruts it's it's hard to go places that
[1:39:22] we're uncomfortable
[1:39:23] with right and and and you know as they
[1:39:27] say it's it's you can't teaching old dog
[1:39:29] new
[1:39:31] tricks and how many times have we been
[1:39:34] trained in in our childhood to do
[1:39:35] certain things and then if you come into
[1:39:38] your marriage or whatever and then you
[1:39:40] fall right back into that old training
[1:39:42] oh yeah it's just hard it's it's hard to
[1:39:44] break some things but see when it comes
[1:39:47] to the word of God You' got to break
[1:39:49] iten it's it's got to be
[1:39:52] broken and it's not necessary that you
[1:39:55] understand it to where you now you can
[1:39:57] you can do all the formula of it in
[1:39:59] class that's not it it's believing it
[1:40:03] it's believing no wonder Satan is trying
[1:40:06] to take this absolute away from us yeah
[1:40:09] no wonder he's trying to take the the
[1:40:11] the confidence away from us from this
[1:40:14] message to say that this message is an
[1:40:16] absolute you get you there's a lot of
[1:40:19] message folks that'll blast you to
[1:40:21] kingom
[1:40:21] come but I'm not ashamed to say this
[1:40:24] message is an
[1:40:27] absolute it's an absolute not only for
[1:40:29] the
[1:40:30] church it's not just an absolute for me
[1:40:32] to just sit here and say Amen to it it's
[1:40:35] such an absolute that I can surrender to
[1:40:37] it and not worry about being
[1:40:41] lost ain't that right so he said see if
[1:40:45] it's the same old school you've had why

[1:40:50] it he's trying to get you to turn that
[1:40:52] corner stop sign slow up see look where
[1:40:57] you're going you'll dump yourself off at
[1:40:59] the corner if you don't watch there's a
[1:41:02] sharp curve and it's always a sign there
[1:41:05] before you make this curve to keep you
[1:41:08] from Wrecking
[1:41:09] up and before this world become totally
[1:41:12] insane God would send a profet the Lord

[1:41:42] this age we're turning the corner and
[1:41:44] this corent this this corner is sharp

[1:41:48] spiritual death in the land you got to
[1:41:50] have something to sustain you the Lord

[1:41:56] this bride we turned the
[1:41:59] corner yes sir look where you're going
[1:42:02] you'll dump yourself off at the corner
[1:42:03] if you don't watch there's a sharp curve
[1:42:05] and it's always a sign there before you
[1:42:06] make this curve to keep you from
[1:42:08] Wrecking up a good road Builder gives
[1:42:11] signs and we are traveling a road to
[1:42:14] glory and if the son speaks the same old
[1:42:16] of the same old thing it wasn't from God
[1:42:20] that's right bless the name of the Lord
[1:42:23] amen Malachi 4:5 behold I send you
[1:42:26] Elijah the prophet a
[1:42:29] sign before the coming of the great and
[1:42:31] Dreadful day of the Lord and what's he
[1:42:34] going to do he going to turn the heart
[1:42:36] of the fathers to the children and the
[1:42:39] Heart of the children to the fathers
[1:42:40] lest I come and smite the Earth with the
[1:42:42] curse do you know what the prophet said
[1:42:44] about Malachi for he will change the
[1:42:47] thoughts of the
[1:42:48] people Glory Glory Glory Glory get them
[1:42:52] out of this Earthly thought frame into a
[1:42:54] Heavenly can you say Amen get their
[1:42:57] minds out of that same old school of
[1:42:59] thought into a new thought another thing
[1:43:02] that's God is doing can you say Amen we
[1:43:04] are becoming more Heavenly minded we are
[1:43:06] becoming more restored than any any
[1:43:08] other people on the face of this
[1:43:11] Earth man this this this message is a
[1:43:13] message of restoration to bring you back
[1:43:16] to where God thought in the beginning
[1:43:19] this message has the to restore a
[1:43:21] marriage and bring it back the way God
[1:43:22] wants it not the way a psychology wants
[1:43:24] it the way God wants it he'll make you
[1:43:27] young people live just the way God wants
[1:43:29] you to live not the way some other uh uh
[1:43:31] uh uh uh intellectual mind wants you to
[1:43:34] live and how he sees you ought to be the
[1:43:36] way God wants you to be because a
[1:43:39] Prophet come to restore us back to what
[1:43:41] God thought thank you Lord God has his
[1:43:44] thoughts of what a marriage should be
[1:43:45] God has his thoughts of way a church
[1:43:47] ought to be God has his own thinking
[1:43:49] than the way we ought to be be as
[1:43:51] Christians and
[1:43:53] Believers can you say
[1:43:55] Amen he'll change the thoughts of the
[1:43:58] people that's the ministry of a prophet
[1:44:00] praise the Lord Revelations 10:7 but in
[1:44:03] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:44:04] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:44:06] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:44:08] ha declared to his servants the prophets
[1:44:11] so this seventh angel we know would have
[1:44:13] to be a prophet a prophet means the
[1:44:15] correct divver the one that the word of
[1:44:18] the Lord came to the Revelation came to
[1:44:20] him the word Prophet means a divver of
[1:44:22] the Divine word yes sir ain't that right
[1:44:26] so notice brother BR said all those
[1:44:28] Mysteries that the prophet spoke of will
[1:44:30] be revealed right here in this last hour
[1:44:33] and when this seventh angel rises in the
[1:44:35] lay Odyssey and age and begins to sound
[1:44:37] forth the true trumpet because it'll be
[1:44:41] uh contrary they won't believe it they
[1:44:44] sure won't believe it but it'll be an
[1:44:46] inspired Prophet because there's no way
[1:44:48] to figure it out amen no way way no way
[1:44:51] to figure this word out no way to figure
[1:44:53] God's mind out but by a Vindicated
[1:44:55] Prophet the Lord men try to figure out
[1:44:58] the Trinity and go gray-headed and go
[1:45:00] crazy no one can understand it they
[1:45:03] still believe Eve ate an apple and all
[1:45:06] those things because it's tradition that
[1:45:08] men has held on to just like Jesus found
[1:45:11] the church but it'll have to be a divin
[1:45:13] Le Prophet for the word of God to come
[1:45:15] to him with the true interpretation of
[1:45:17] the revelation of Jesus Christ see then
[1:45:19] it's got to be that way ain't that right
[1:45:22] another place remember the message is
[1:45:23] Promised how many believes that the
[1:45:26] message is just didn't come on its own
[1:45:27] the message was promised thoughts of God
[1:45:30] in the in the beginning he said I'm
[1:45:31] going to turn to people I mean just
[1:45:32] think what was in God's mind I'm going
[1:45:34] to turn to people I'm going to change
[1:45:35] their thinking amen I'm going to call
[1:45:37] them out of of the of of the same school
[1:45:39] of thought I'm I'm going to change them
[1:45:41] all that call them out of there and I'm
[1:45:43] going to be their God they're going to
[1:45:44] be my people I'll be a father unto them
[1:45:46] there will be Sons and Daughters of mine
[1:45:48] is this not what is happening the
[1:45:51] thoughts of God is being made manifest
[1:45:53] by
[1:45:56] us the message is promised and when all
[1:45:59] these Mysteries has has been all so
[1:46:02] bundled up by a bunch of Ecclesiastes
[1:46:05] see it will take a direct Prophet from
[1:46:07] God to reveal it and that's exactly what
[1:46:10] he promised to do now remember the word
[1:46:12] of the Lord comes to the prophet not the
[1:46:15] Theologian ain't that right so the voice
[1:46:18] of the Angel the seventh angel is not
[1:46:20] just the voice of a man but it's the
[1:46:22] voice of God on Earth because the word
[1:46:25] of the Lord comes to him now notice in
[1:46:30] in uh Hebrews 12:24 and to Jesus the
[1:46:33] mediator of the New Covenant and to the
[1:46:35] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[1:46:39] things that speaketh better things than
[1:46:43] that of Abel see that you refuse him not
[1:46:46] that speaketh for they escaped not who
[1:46:50] Escape not who refused him that spake on
[1:46:53] Earth how much more shall we not Escape
[1:46:55] if we turn from him that speaketh from
[1:46:58] Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth
[1:47:00] but now he ha promised saying yet once
[1:47:03] more I shake not the Earth only but also
[1:47:06] the heaven see so the Earth The Voice
[1:47:10] shakes not only the Earth but the
[1:47:12] heavens also and the voice of God comes
[1:47:16] by way of a
[1:47:19] prophet that you refuse that not the
[1:47:23] voice that speaketh can you say Amen see
[1:47:26] nothing nothing now I i' we've said it
[1:47:29] and I say it again we're seeing a
[1:47:31] shaking all
[1:47:34] over why because the voice of God has
[1:47:37] spoke through a
[1:47:39] prophet that scripture is
[1:47:42] fulfilled the lord it's it's here
[1:47:46] politics are shaking Nations culture
[1:47:48] civiliz everything's shaking
[1:47:51] yes it but also things that are shaking
[1:47:55] is things in your life that's
[1:47:58] temporary that God doesn't want in your
[1:48:02] life and it's because of this message
[1:48:05] that the shaking is going on to think of
[1:48:08] that if God hadn't sent a prophet and
[1:48:10] God not had brought you into this
[1:48:12] message you would still be carrying the
[1:48:14] same old Trend You' still be just the
[1:48:18] average Church goer thank you God wanted
[1:48:20] to be your father amen God wanted you to
[1:48:23] be his son his daughter and it's been
[1:48:26] Grace remember the prophet said it's
[1:48:28] Grace it's Grace that God sends a
[1:48:30] prophet when God sends a prophet it's
[1:48:32] Grace to a
[1:48:35] people it's Grace yes sir I'm so glad as
[1:48:39] a parent that I'm not teaching my
[1:48:41] children under the same school of
[1:48:42] thought aren't
[1:48:47] you I might have a long ways to go
[1:48:51] but I'm headed
[1:48:54] somewhere praise the
[1:48:59] Lord so nothing in your life could be
[1:49:01] shaken outside the prophet's
[1:49:04] message and this message is not bringing
[1:49:07] on another
[1:49:09] Reformation but it's actually bringing
[1:49:11] forth a new creation praise the Lord yes
[1:49:14] just as God did when he spoke the word
[1:49:17] in the
[1:49:18] beginning Hallelujah it wasn't a
[1:49:20] Reformation it was a
[1:49:22] creation and what is being done
[1:49:25] today is a
[1:49:27] creation what denomination what teaching
[1:49:30] what literature what psychologist what
[1:49:32] program has been able to make the people
[1:49:35] a word
[1:49:36] bride there's been
[1:49:38] nothing but a prophet's Ministry
[1:49:41] am it takes a prophet now brother
[1:49:43] brandham says many false prophets will
[1:49:46] rise and we give the illustrations of
[1:49:48] how that balam and Moses both of them
[1:49:50] Anointed with the same Spirit one of
[1:49:53] them said we're all
[1:49:54] one let's come join put our girls and
[1:49:57] all together we got pretty girls over
[1:49:59] here and you boys come over and you take
[1:50:01] a nice wife that's all right we're all
[1:50:04] wanting people anyhow the same race God
[1:50:06] never did forgive them for that might as
[1:50:09] stay figure out what teaching you're
[1:50:12] under what prophet you listen to amen
[1:50:16] true can you say amen I know we got all
[1:50:19] kinds of prophets in this age claiming
[1:50:21] to be the Eighth Day and claiming this
[1:50:23] brother brand laid his hands on me and
[1:50:25] brother brand did this brother BR that
[1:50:27] never did the Bible ever promise an
[1:50:29] eighth day Pro another
[1:50:31] Prophet
[1:50:33] amen they listen to that and see the
[1:50:35] world see the people are watching for
[1:50:37] some little Outlet some little bypass
[1:50:40] some little shortcut but there is no
[1:50:42] shortcuts in the word of God there's one
[1:50:44] pattern and you must cut yourself and
[1:50:47] fit that pattern not try to cut the
[1:50:50] pattern to fit you everybody must do
[1:50:53] that that's the only way God has of
[1:50:56] doing it can you say amen amen see so
[1:51:00] you cannot use again the same techniques
[1:51:03] that the carnal church is using and and
[1:51:06] and bring a word bride you you can that
[1:51:10] you you can't do that ain't that
[1:51:13] right you want a home that fits with the
[1:51:15] word surrender to the message
[1:51:18] amen the Lord
[1:51:20] if we want a church that fits with the
[1:51:22] word surrender to the message if you
[1:51:24] want an experience that fits with the
[1:51:26] word surrender to the
[1:51:28] message if you want a ref relationship
[1:51:31] with God that fits with the word
[1:51:33] surrender to the
[1:51:35] message ain't that right yes brother
[1:51:38] Braham said see the church we tried to
[1:51:39] send our boys to school to learn
[1:51:41] psychology and so forth like that to
[1:51:43] know how to put over a program in the
[1:51:45] pulpit and to arrange our he said see
[1:51:48] the message is so enticing that it'll
[1:51:50] catch the people and catch their
[1:51:51] attention and many of great
[1:51:53] psychologists go out as teachers like
[1:51:55] that and dramatize and put on a whole
[1:51:57] lot of something and I just wonder see
[1:52:00] we're always telling of the Beauty and
[1:52:01] the attraction of the church but we fail
[1:52:04] to tell them he that will follow me let
[1:52:06] him deny himself and take up his cross
[1:52:08] and follow me I wonder if we haven't
[1:52:10] made the beauty of the church too pretty
[1:52:12] for the fell that comes in can you say
[1:52:15] Amen so the voice the voice is made
[1:52:18] known to the elect
[1:52:20] by a Vindicated Prophet praise the
[1:52:24] Lord God so designed it that he could
[1:52:26] hide himself from smart and wise he can
[1:52:30] hide himself in the scriptures the
[1:52:31] prophet said from the smartest
[1:52:32] Theologian yeah many many many men study
[1:52:37] this Bible back and forward back and
[1:52:39] forward back and forward reading all
[1:52:41] kinds of literature going to schools to
[1:52:43] learn this Bible and yet God hides
[1:52:47] himself from them yes sir amen cuz God
[1:52:50] can do
[1:52:51] so brother Bram said he can just hide
[1:52:53] himself and sit right there in the
[1:52:55] scripture and you look all day long and
[1:52:57] never see it look a lifetime and never
[1:52:59] see it he can just hide himself sitting
[1:53:02] there now please everywhere let that
[1:53:04] soak in that God in the word can hide
[1:53:07] himself so in the word that there isn't
[1:53:10] a theologian or a school in the world
[1:53:12] could ever find him and yet he's setting
[1:53:15] right there amen see why it takes a
[1:53:18] prophet to bring the re re ation of
[1:53:20] Jesus
[1:53:22] Christ God does his own choosing by
[1:53:24] predestination chose the prophets for
[1:53:26] every age notice it he fixes the nature
[1:53:29] of that Prophet to fit that age see he
[1:53:32] fits his style whatever he does he fits
[1:53:34] him whether he's educated or Not
[1:53:36] educated he fits the gifts the manner
[1:53:38] that he'll preach in the gifts he'll
[1:53:41] have and the message for that certain
[1:53:43] age God's predestinated that certain
[1:53:45] thing to happen and there's not another
[1:53:47] thing can take its place amen care what
[1:53:50] it is how many man-made achievements
[1:53:52] nothing can take its place he
[1:53:54] predestinated the man you now you think
[1:53:56] of that no matter how much educated it
[1:53:58] is no matter how fine the program is and
[1:54:01] not it'll never take the place of God's
[1:54:03] chosen way and that's a prophet he
[1:54:05] predestinated the man maybe an ignorant
[1:54:08] man he might have predestinated him
[1:54:10] another kind of a man whatever he is he
[1:54:13] gives him his class his gift give him
[1:54:15] his nature his style and whatever it is
[1:54:17] how he expresses himself and whatever
[1:54:19] does notice he makes the man of the hour
[1:54:23] to catch the people of the
[1:54:26] hour he does
[1:54:29] it you love him the Lord aren't you glad
[1:54:33] God sent a prophet
[1:54:37] am Hallelujah you think of it now as as
[1:54:40] we get ready
[1:54:43] close the Jews have been scattered
[1:54:46] throughout the world for what nearly
[1:54:48] 2,000 years or so
[1:54:51] so uh all over the
[1:54:56] Nations but the thing is that they don't
[1:55:02] realize that by God's grace we have been
[1:55:04] able to realize and that is there's
[1:55:07] promises in this
[1:55:09] scripture yes that the prophet caught in
[1:55:13] the mind of God and he began to write it
[1:55:16] down it begins to talk about the
[1:55:19] restoration of Israel amen begins to
[1:55:22] talk yes they rejected him he says
[1:55:25] there's a Remnant right that I'm going
[1:55:28] I'm going to come for amen ain't that
[1:55:30] right
[1:55:32] yes but in order for him to deal with
[1:55:35] them they have to be in their Homeland
[1:55:37] for as the message has taught us that
[1:55:39] God can only deal with Israel as a
[1:55:41] nation he deals with us Gentiles as
[1:55:43] individuals but for Israel they have to
[1:55:46] be a nation
[1:55:48] absolutely
[1:55:50] and brother brandham gives the
[1:55:51] illustration of how that God wanted to
[1:55:54] deal with Israel in the Old Testament
[1:55:57] but here they all were in Egypt so God
[1:55:59] had to harden Pharaoh's
[1:56:02] heart to get them out drive them to the
[1:56:06] Homeland Drive them yes
[1:56:09] sir to
[1:56:12] Palestine and he says and liken un that
[1:56:14] day God
[1:56:17] hardened Hitler and musolini heart right
[1:56:20] to drive and to force the Jews into
[1:56:23] Palestine amen National Force put Israel
[1:56:27] in their Homeland that's true Israel is
[1:56:30] sitting there in their Homeland because
[1:56:31] of God's desire Amen to once again deal
[1:56:35] with them now you think of that Nation
[1:56:38] after Nation after nation has tried to
[1:56:40] come against them has tried to destroy
[1:56:41] them yes sir they have been the the
[1:56:43] little guy U
[1:56:47] Underdog in every war yeah but God has
[1:56:51] saw them through amen amen sure because
[1:56:55] there was something in the back part of
[1:56:56] his mind for
[1:56:58] them ain't that
[1:57:00] right and God promised that there would
[1:57:03] be 144,000 Jews 12,000 out of each
[1:57:10] tribe from what I hear that they don't
[1:57:13] even know the tribes that they've come
[1:57:14] out of that's
[1:57:15] right they they have no records so from
[1:57:19] what I've heard you ask a Jew what tribe
[1:57:22] are you from he'd probably look at you
[1:57:25] like what in the world are you talking
[1:57:27] about but God knows he knows amen
[1:57:30] because he's in the back of his
[1:57:32] mind and so God God knows and he
[1:57:35] promised that there would be he'd give
[1:57:37] this 144,000 of each tribe they would
[1:57:41] receive the Holy Ghost and John actually
[1:57:43] talks about it in Revelation 7
[1:57:46] and4 but the prop is that it's been a
[1:57:48] bitter persecution against
[1:57:52] Israel but this is the
[1:57:55] time right this is the time that God is
[1:57:58] calling him back to the atonement
[1:58:01] yes now we we those of you that have
[1:58:04] studied the Holocaust and what has what
[1:58:07] happened 6 million I believe Jews were
[1:58:11] murdered and the horrific things that
[1:58:15] happened right to them amen such ungodly
[1:58:20] things and it would take a prophet to
[1:58:23] say it was the tender hand of
[1:58:26] Jehovah it was the tender hand of
[1:58:28] Jehovah God bringing them back into
[1:58:30] Homeland we don't understand God's ways
[1:58:34] but I can tell you it's the tender hand
[1:58:36] of Jehovah amen you may not even
[1:58:38] understand the ways that you go through
[1:58:40] and the trials and the testings but I
[1:58:42] can tell you this it's the tender hand
[1:58:44] of
[1:58:45] Jehovah God bringing you to what he's
[1:58:47] wanted you to be prise the Lord if
[1:58:49] there's ever a people that go through
[1:58:52] trouble and tribulations and testings
[1:58:55] and hardships it's people who truly
[1:58:59] believe this
[1:59:01] message because it's not just saying I
[1:59:03] believe but now God sends things there
[1:59:05] to shake the things that he doesn't like
[1:59:08] about it out of your life molds you and
[1:59:12] shapes you and to where you're conformed
[1:59:15] to His Image prise the Lord and so it's
[1:59:17] been a bitter persecution on natural
[1:59:20] people but it's all fulfilling God's
[1:59:23] word god preparing to deal with them the
[1:59:27] angel Mighty Angel has come time shall
[1:59:29] be no more denominational ages are over
[1:59:34] you can't find hardly anybody that just
[1:59:36] really dedicate anymore to God and sell
[1:59:38] out and really even get an altar I mean
[1:59:41] fill an altar up with the Sinners and
[1:59:44] and all that everybody seems to be a
[1:59:45] Christian smokers and druggies and
[1:59:49] prostitutes and all that somehow they
[1:59:50] seem to be
[1:59:52] Christian and and all these things and
[1:59:55] and just to be honest it's because the
[1:59:57] Gentile days are over we're just
[2:00:00] gleaning now just here and there but we
[2:00:02] must not stop
[2:00:04] gleaning we must not lose our burden for
[2:00:06] people but regardless you cannot get
[2:00:11] discouraged it's just that way true and
[2:00:16] so the Jew is still under the at woman
[2:00:19] of a natural lamb and it's because he
[2:00:22] rejected the Lamb of God the real
[2:00:25] lamb uh which was the atonement and he
[2:00:28] rejected Christ and when he did that the
[2:00:31] blood of Christ has been on their hands
[2:00:34] ever
[2:00:35] since and so but the reason the Jews
[2:00:39] rejected him was they were blinded yes
[2:00:41] sir they they and and the Bible says
[2:00:45] here God blinded them for our sake
[2:00:46] Romans 11:11 Paul would say I say then
[2:00:49] have they stumbled speaking of Israel
[2:00:51] that they should fall God forbid but
[2:00:53] rather through their fall salvation has
[2:00:56] come to the Gentiles amen for to provoke
[2:00:58] them to jealousy then the 25th verse for
[2:01:02] I would not Brethren that you should be
[2:01:03] ignorant of this mystery lest you should
[2:01:06] be wise in your own conceits that
[2:01:07] blindness in part is happened to Israel
[2:01:10] until everybody say until the fullness
[2:01:13] of the Gentiles be come in and so all
[2:01:16] Israel shall be saved and now we know
[2:01:19] what all Israel is it's the remnant
[2:01:22] elect as it is written there shall come
[2:01:24] out of Zion uh the deliverer and shall
[2:01:27] turn away ungodliness from Jacob aren't
[2:01:31] you glad for that amen for this is my
[2:01:33] Covenant unto them when I shall take
[2:01:35] away their sins as concerning the gospel
[2:01:38] they are enemies for your sakes but as
[2:01:41] touching the election they are beloved
[2:01:44] for their the father's sake so the
[2:01:47] prophet would tell us God had to harden
[2:01:49] Pharaoh's heart to run them out of Egypt
[2:01:52] and he hardened Stalin and musolini and
[2:01:55] all that to get them back into the
[2:01:57] promised land where the 144,000 is
[2:02:00] supposed to be and now for the first
[2:02:02] time for thousands of years 2500 years
[2:02:06] that Israel is a nation with its own
[2:02:08] flag own Army and all and it considered
[2:02:12] in the UN first time it's been the
[2:02:15] oldest flag that ever flew on Earth at
[2:02:18] this time see flies again six-point star
[2:02:20] of David and he said he had lift that
[2:02:22] ins sign in the last days and when she'd
[2:02:25] be coming back and we're at the end
[2:02:27] there's no doubt about it we're here but
[2:02:30] notice what he said Israel is going to
[2:02:32] be called to the Feast of the atonement
[2:02:35] what to recognize the atonement not no
[2:02:40] more chickens and geese and what they've
[2:02:42] been doing but the Lamb of God slain
[2:02:45] from the foundation of the world Israel
[2:02:48] is going to know that think of this now
[2:02:51] they've been blinded for 200 years but
[2:02:53] God's going to open their eyes and turn
[2:02:56] them to the true atonement but notice it
[2:02:59] will take a prophet to do it absolutely
[2:03:03] ain't that right two to be exact brother
[2:03:06] BR said be Moses and Elijah ain't that
[2:03:08] right see so in in Revelations 11 and
[2:03:11] 3-10 talks about the two prophets that
[2:03:14] are to come and and and according to the
[2:03:16] message their ministry will start after
[2:03:20] the Rapture of the Gentile
[2:03:23] bride now the Israel's starting to wake
[2:03:26] up over there
[2:03:28] right so brother BR said it will be by
[2:03:31] these two prophets that the Jews are
[2:03:33] caught out of Judaism to Christ the
[2:03:37] atonement Israel and Elijah see will
[2:03:40] will call Israel out of that Jewish
[2:03:43] Traditions out of the old atonement of
[2:03:45] the sheep and goat sacrifice to the real
[2:03:48] living sacrifice to the
[2:03:50] word another place one of these days
[2:03:53] some Divine holy anointed prophet of God
[2:03:55] will go over there with signs and
[2:03:57] wonders those Jews will say that's what
[2:04:00] I'm looking for yes sir and God will
[2:04:03] baptize 144,000 Jews ain't that right
[2:04:08] but then a gentile bride was to have a
[2:04:10] prophet
[2:04:12] amen I speak in past tense because I
[2:04:15] believe he's already come and which is
[2:04:18] the prophet of Malachi 4 and his message
[2:04:20] is the seventh Angel's message in
[2:04:22] Revelation
[2:04:24] 71:7 and what is his message the prophet
[2:04:27] said in the Feast of the trumpets his
[2:04:29] message is to call the bride out of the
[2:04:33] Pentecostal
[2:04:35] tradition the seventh Angel's message
[2:04:38] under the same trumpet same everything
[2:04:41] exactly the same seal is to what call
[2:04:44] the people the bride out of the
[2:04:46] Pentecostal and World tradition to the
[2:04:49] genuine atonement the word Christ
[2:04:52] impersonated in his word here made flesh
[2:04:55] Among Us science has proved it by
[2:04:57] pictures the church knows it the world
[2:04:59] around we firmly know it for he's never
[2:05:02] told us one thing in thus say the Lord
[2:05:05] but what's been the truth ain't that
[2:05:06] right see so it takes a prophet God did
[2:05:11] not send the church World a prophet God
[2:05:14] did not send amen a prophet to the
[2:05:17] foolish virgin God didn't send a prophet
[2:05:20] to the entire world for the entire world
[2:05:23] he sent a prophet to the elect of God to
[2:05:27] take them out pull them out of the
[2:05:31] Pentecostal traditions and the world
[2:05:33] traditions and and all of these things
[2:05:36] it would be by a prophet what power the
[2:05:39] prophet has to the elect of God Amen
[2:05:43] what a Ministry amen the world they have
[2:05:46] their politicians their theologians
[2:05:48] their psychologists their Educators
[2:05:51] philosophers and intellectual Giants
[2:05:54] they have that that's for
[2:05:56] them they write their books and they you
[2:05:59] know everybody studies all that trying
[2:06:00] to make the world better trying to make
[2:06:02] the home better trying to make the
[2:06:03] family better trying to make the church
[2:06:06] better trying to make the politics
[2:06:07] better trying to bring peace to the
[2:06:09] world bring peace to the church bring
[2:06:11] peace to the home bring peace to
[2:06:13] whatever but you know what God would
[2:06:15] send a prophet thank God for the elect
[2:06:19] and everything they're looking forj we
[2:06:21] have it the answers that they're
[2:06:23] studying to have the remedy we have
[2:06:31] it brother brah said God has a certain
[2:06:34] Prophet ready for that age to call his
[2:06:36] electing by his Vindicated word of signs
[2:06:39] and wonders and confirmation of his word
[2:06:42] confirming the word with signs following
[2:06:45] as he promised he gives the true
[2:06:46] interpretation after the prophet himself
[2:06:48] has been Vindicated all but those the
[2:06:52] elected to whom he is sent hate him now
[2:06:56] examine every instant and see if that's
[2:06:59] right or not only the ones that he is
[2:07:02] sent to he came to his own and his own
[2:07:06] received him not but as many as did
[2:07:10] receive him to them gave he the power to
[2:07:13] become sons of God all do you love him
[2:07:18] if you mus positions will come the Lord
[2:07:21] Jesus brah said he is sending a
[2:07:23] Vindicated prophet he is sending a
[2:07:24] prophet after almost 2,000 years he is
[2:07:27] sending someone who is so far from
[2:07:28] organization education and the world of
[2:07:31] religion that is John the Baptist and
[2:07:33] the Elijah of old he will hear only from
[2:07:36] God and he will have thus sayith the
[2:07:38] Lord and speak for God he will be God's
[2:07:41] mouthpiece And he as it is declared in
[2:07:44] Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the
[2:07:47] children back to the fathers
[2:07:49] he will bring back the elect of this
[2:07:52] last day and they will hear a Vindicated
[2:07:55] Prophet give the exact truth as it was
[2:07:58] with Paul he will restore the truth as
[2:08:01] they had it and those elect with him in
[2:08:04] that day will be the ones who truly
[2:08:07] manifest the Lord and be his body and be
[2:08:10] his voice and perform his works so what
[2:08:14] the world is looking
[2:08:16] for the True Believer
[2:08:19] Has
[2:08:21] It by listening to a
[2:08:28] prophet we don't have to come up with
[2:08:32] gimmicks we we don't have to come up
[2:08:34] with things to to
[2:08:36] entertain we don't have to be educated
[2:08:39] we don't have to be
[2:08:42] anything all we have to do is just
[2:08:44] believe it and surrender and say
[2:08:46] Lord I Surrender it it's a headship this
[2:08:50] message is a
[2:08:52] headship it's the headship it's the
[2:08:54] answer for everything that we have need
[2:08:57] of
[2:08:58] amen that's why I've
[2:09:02] said told both
[2:09:05] places there in Pennsylvania and
[2:09:08] Oklahoma when we were in the Pentecostal
[2:09:10] we were people are so Gable man if a man
[2:09:14] had a dream yeah that's right we went
[2:09:17] after it yeah
[2:09:19] if something Shin diing you know we we
[2:09:22] went prophecy went we went yeah man had
[2:09:25] a great ministry we
[2:09:27] went man said he had D say the Lord or a
[2:09:29] word from the Lord we
[2:09:31] [Music]
[2:09:33] went and we constantly question our own
[2:09:36] experience does he love me does he
[2:09:39] not Church goes through Seasons well is
[2:09:43] God With Us or is he
[2:09:45] not homes go through Seasons well does
[2:09:47] he love us or not is she really the
[2:09:49] right one for me is he really the right
[2:09:51] one I don't know Lord if you just then
[2:09:55] someone rise up with
[2:09:57] something then we get discouraged well
[2:09:59] he didn't call me out he didn't have a
[2:10:01] word Over Me Oh Lord what do I
[2:10:03] do even our own
[2:10:07] Pastor loving to
[2:10:10] death there's a woman that supposedly
[2:10:12] had a gift of Visions dreams
[2:10:17] and and it didn't matter if she was she
[2:10:21] was in and out all the time didn't
[2:10:22] matter if she was backslid cut hair and
[2:10:24] wearing her britches and whatever she
[2:10:26] was
[2:10:26] doing call her up you have a word from
[2:10:29] the Lord for me you have a dream you
[2:10:31] have have a vision that's
[2:10:34] Pentecostal we we were so wrapped up in
[2:10:37] that stuff it was so emotions and and
[2:10:40] all of these things that's the
[2:10:44] truth but God would send a prophet to
[2:10:47] settle us down
[2:10:51] down to where we wouldn't so be so
[2:10:54] gullible we wouldn't be so
[2:10:57] vulnerable it's not that we don't
[2:10:59] believe in gifts it's not that we don't
[2:11:01] believe in things
[2:11:02] but it was hard to find pillars in in a
[2:11:05] Pentecostal
[2:11:07] church it was hard to find real rooted
[2:11:11] people this is what the message is doing
[2:11:14] it's it's rooting people it's it's
[2:11:16] establishing that elect
[2:11:18] it doesn't matter with the winds
[2:11:20] remember talking about that Jesus talked
[2:11:23] about the foolish man that built his
[2:11:24] house upon the Sands and the the wise
[2:11:26] man that built his house on the Rocks
[2:11:28] they both went to the trials they both
[2:11:30] went through the storms they both went
[2:11:32] where there was no emotions and
[2:11:33] Sensations and they were on the highs
[2:11:35] and they were the lows and they were
[2:11:36] this and they were that just speaking
[2:11:38] about us they they went through the
[2:11:40] testings they you know and all these
[2:11:42] things but one stood and one
[2:11:44] didn't one's testimony stood and one
[2:11:47] didn't
[2:11:48] than one experience stood and the
[2:11:52] other's
[2:11:53] experience
[2:11:55] didn't because one was founded upon a
[2:11:58] rock the other was founded on shifting
[2:12:01] Sands well brothers and
[2:12:04] sisters God would come in this day to
[2:12:07] build our life upon a
[2:12:08] [Music]
[2:12:09] message that no other denomination no
[2:12:12] other teaching no none other can give
[2:12:15] us God would found us upon a rock amen
[2:12:18] the revelation of Jesus Christ now if
[2:12:22] you can receive
[2:12:23] that the same way it's giving it was
[2:12:26] given by
[2:12:27] inspiration and we must receive it by
[2:12:31] inspiration it'll be the thing to hold
[2:12:33] you it'll be the thing to keep you it'll
[2:12:36] be thing to tie you down where no matter
[2:12:39] what comes what goes you're still
[2:12:41] standing when it's all said and done
[2:12:43] aren't you glad for that amen what
[2:12:47] song

[2:14:10] theet as they just play softly I want to

[2:14:15] today and this is one of the reason why
[2:14:18] don't like talking on the Internet is is
[2:14:21] because when you're talking to your
[2:14:22] church people listening in or whatever
[2:14:25] say well you're you're talking about so
[2:14:26] and so and all that I want you to know
[2:14:28] right now we're not talking about
[2:14:30] anybody we're not attacking I God forbid
[2:14:33] that we attack and and
[2:14:37] things and so if you anyone here in this
[2:14:40] in the church here today that would
[2:14:42] think that or that are May
[2:14:45] listen just know that we're not not it's
[2:14:48] just my convictions it's something that
[2:14:50] I'm just trying to teach my
[2:14:53] church and I believe it's according to
[2:14:56] the message and it's not it's not to
[2:14:59] attack it's not for any reasons you know
[2:15:01] whether I don't know what side you know
[2:15:04] I I don't know I know there's just a lot
[2:15:05] of things that go on out out the doors
[2:15:07] here and and
[2:15:10] um so I don't want anyone to take me
[2:15:12] wrong to think that I'm studying to
[2:15:15] attack cuz God forbid that we would do
[2:15:18] that I love the Lord I love the message
[2:15:21] I love the people of God Amen I love the
[2:15:24] ministering Brothers I love the people I
[2:15:29] I've always said you know and and to
[2:15:32] make this clear again I've always told
[2:15:34] you and you know it that no one has to
[2:15:36] come to my church to make it in a bride
[2:15:39] I don't believe that I
[2:15:42] I wherever God leads
[2:15:45] someone then you know if they can't be
[2:15:47] fail here if they can't be helped here I
[2:15:51] yeah hey I'll be the first one to say I
[2:15:54] cried tears many times you know and
[2:15:57] question you know why I can't help
[2:15:59] people but more than anything I would
[2:16:03] rather someone go where they can get
[2:16:05] helped and to try to keep them here and
[2:16:09] so I you know so we're not in any any
[2:16:12] way if Satan ever tries to make you
[2:16:15] think well he's attacking or he's saying
[2:16:18] this and he's saying that it's not true
[2:16:20] you know we're just preaching the
[2:16:21] message preaching what I believe and um
[2:16:25] I love you all very
[2:16:27] much and um anyone that has left her
[2:16:31] church we love them dearly pray that God
[2:16:34] just blesses them I pray God blesses the
[2:16:37] churches around this area that God
[2:16:39] blesses them gives
[2:16:42] them uh uh a church full and you know
[2:16:47] God blesses their
[2:16:49] Ministry uh all in all we're we just
[2:16:52] want to go home every day I live I want
[2:16:55] to go home I think God makes it that way
[2:16:58] for me just I want to go
[2:17:01] home and even John at the end of
[2:17:05] Revelation did he not say that even so
[2:17:07] Lord Jesus come and I I I think maybe if
[2:17:11] he's represent of the Bride maybe that's
[2:17:13] that's where we're all coming to is just
[2:17:14] even so Lord Jesus just come amen go
[2:17:18] home amen but until we are at home we
[2:17:23] want to do all that we know to do stay
[2:17:26] true to this
[2:17:27] message lean from the message man don't
[2:17:31] don't be turned one way or the other
[2:17:33] don't don't there's nothing to go
[2:17:36] to just stay with the message stay true
[2:17:40] and let the message just conform your
[2:17:43] life to what God wants you to be amen
[2:17:46] you love the Lord Lord sorry for being
[2:17:49] long
[2:17:50] winded um well not sorry but uh but
[2:17:54] thank you I should say it that way thank
[2:17:55] you for listening to me and uh putting
[2:17:58] up with us and u i I just feel an
[2:18:02] urgency uh and the more I look into the
[2:18:05] word the more I just love to talk about
[2:18:07] it so I hope it's been a help to you
[2:18:10] today um I do say that the family and I
[2:18:13] are going to go on a camping
[2:18:15] trip either tonight or in the
[2:18:18] morning and uh just to get away so
[2:18:24] um we won't be here Wednesday for
[2:18:28] sure uh or at least that's the thought
[2:18:31] and um but we will be here Lord willing

[2:19:00] mattress so got one luxury of
[2:19:03] home but uh we actually thought about
[2:19:06] bringing a coffee pot but I don't know
[2:19:09] if we' do that but anyway anyway we are
[2:19:12] going to try to rough it though and U
[2:19:14] anyway we're really looking forward to a
[2:19:16] wonderful time

[2:19:28] prayer that God will just give him
[2:19:30] strength Grace as he's going through
[2:19:32] these tests in that heart calf on
[2:19:35] Thursday and uh procedure there and so I
[2:19:40] think that's it anyway let's just bow

[2:19:44] heads talk to the Lord Brother Matthew
[2:19:47] do you want to dismiss us in prayer
