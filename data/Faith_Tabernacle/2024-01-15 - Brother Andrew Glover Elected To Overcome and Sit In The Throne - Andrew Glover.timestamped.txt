[1:01:03] me you might have peace in the world you
[1:01:07] shall have tribulation so he's

[1:01:23] here's why I have overcome the world but
[1:01:28] be of good cheer I have overcome the
[1:01:31] world now in the Book of Romans the 9th
[1:01:34] chapter The Book of Romans the 9th
[1:01:37] chapter and in the fourth verse Paul
[1:01:39] here uh speaking in Romans chapter sorry

[1:01:45] straight here in a minute Romans chapter
[1:01:48] 9 and verse
[1:01:51] 4en the Bible here says who are
[1:01:53] Israelites to whom pertaineth the
[1:01:55] adoption how many believes in adoption
[1:01:58] who pertaineth to the adoption and the
[1:02:00] glory and the Covenant and the giving of
[1:02:02] the law and the service of God and the
[1:02:05] promises whose are the fathers and whom
[1:02:07] as concerning the flesh Christ came who
[1:02:10] is over all God blessed forever amen not
[1:02:14] as though the word of God had taken none
[1:02:16] effect for they are not all Israel which
[1:02:19] are of Israel neither because they are
[1:02:22] the Seed of Abraham are they all
[1:02:24] children but in Isaac shall thy seat be
[1:02:27] called that is they which are the
[1:02:29] children of Flesh these are not the
[1:02:31] children of God but the children of
[1:02:33] Promise are counted for the seed amen
[1:02:36] I'm I'm thankful for that seed for This
[1:02:39] Is The Word of Promise at this time will

[1:02:45] not only this but when Rebecca also had
[1:02:48] conceived by one even by Our Father
[1:02:50] Isaac now I love verse 11 for the
[1:02:53] children being not yet born neither
[1:02:57] having done any good or evil that the
[1:03:00] purpose of God according to election
[1:03:04] might stand that it's not of works but
[1:03:07] of him that calleth so the purpose of
[1:03:09] God stands in election now in one other
[1:03:13] place in Revelation 3 Revelation CH 3
[1:03:17] and verse number 21 Revelation
[1:03:21] 3 and verse 21 this morning I want to
[1:03:26] trust the Lord will help us to bring
[1:03:27] these thoughts together in Revelation
[1:03:30] 3:21 now brother Bram brother Bram
[1:03:33] brings this down and says he's not

[1:04:17] the throne amen I want to make that a
[1:04:20] very clear declaration to you this
[1:04:22] morning that you have have been elected
[1:04:26] to overcome and to set in the throne in
[1:04:30] 1 John 2:13 he said I write unto you
[1:04:32] fathers because you have known him that
[1:04:35] is from the beginning he says I write
[1:04:37] unto you young men because you have
[1:04:39] overcome the wicked one I write unto you
[1:04:42] little children because you have known
[1:04:44] the father verse 14 he said I have
[1:04:47] written unto you fathers because you
[1:04:49] have known him that is from the
[1:04:51] beginning he said I have written unto
[1:04:53] you young men because you are strong and
[1:04:55] the word of God abideth in you and ye
[1:04:58] shall or ye have rather overcome the
[1:05:01] wicked one now here in John 16:33 Jesus
[1:05:04] was saying tribulation will be in the
[1:05:06] world but be of good peace be of good
[1:05:09] cheer and he says for I have overcome
[1:05:12] the world here John is writing and
[1:05:14] saying now look amen be of good cheer in
[1:05:17] other words you're strong young men amen
[1:05:20] and you have overcome so amen the same
[1:05:23] one that overcome in John 16:33 is now
[1:05:26] the same one anointing John in 1 John 2
[1:05:30] Amen to say that there's going to be
[1:05:31] some more Overcomers that are going to
[1:05:34] overcome the same way he overcame and
[1:05:37] the way he overcame was by the word now
[1:05:39] brother said in the message how can I
[1:05:41] overcome he said I chose this because I
[1:05:43] think that it's a Time amen that we
[1:05:45] should never let the spirit of Revival
[1:05:48] die now we're in the spirit of Revival
[1:05:50] right now amen but but just just give it
[1:05:52] a few days and the devil is going to do
[1:05:54] everything he can Amen to take that
[1:05:57] Revival out of our hearts but we've got
[1:05:59] to stay in the spirit of Revival
[1:06:02] constantly revived every day and we have
[1:06:04] to do that and the way we do that is we
[1:06:07] die daily amen that Christ should live
[1:06:10] so the way that we keep the spirit of
[1:06:12] Revival is we die daily so that he has
[1:06:16] already overcome amen can continue to
[1:06:19] overcome in us another place he said I
[1:06:21] begin to think of this text then it
[1:06:23] means over come means to keep life in
[1:06:26] you and when life went out brother talks
[1:06:28] about that log he said that's what
[1:06:30] brought the log in that condition amen
[1:06:33] was when the life went out now you
[1:06:34] remember he said that log was laying
[1:06:36] there and he said as long as life was on
[1:06:38] it he said you could step on it he said
[1:06:40] you could push it around he said
[1:06:42] anything you could do to it would not
[1:06:44] affect it as long as there was life in
[1:06:46] it amen but when the life went out when
[1:06:48] he stepped on it it got Doty amen and it
[1:06:51] give away now there's a beautiful lesson
[1:06:52] in there amen that as long as you're in
[1:06:55] the spirit of Revival amen it does not
[1:06:58] matter what happens to you as long as
[1:07:00] life is in you it does not matter what
[1:07:02] comes your way there is something in you
[1:07:05] amen that is greater than what's trying
[1:07:06] to come upon you amen and it'll push you
[1:07:09] through it now now let me say it like
[1:07:11] this sometimes amen people get all
[1:07:13] troubled and all bothered about this and
[1:07:15] bothered about that and bothered about
[1:07:16] this situation Amen in all reality the
[1:07:19] problem is amen that life has gone out
[1:07:22] of them amen because there was a time
[1:07:24] that those things didn't bother them
[1:07:26] there was a time amen that the way
[1:07:28] somebody looked at them didn't bother
[1:07:30] them there was a time the way somebody
[1:07:32] talked about him didn't bother him amen
[1:07:34] but when life went out they become
[1:07:36] susceptible Amen to everything the devil
[1:07:38] sent their way amen but there is a bride
[1:07:41] on the Earth today amen who is not
[1:07:43] falling susceptible Amen to every
[1:07:46] criticism to every look Amen to every
[1:07:49] negative thought because they know who
[1:07:51] they are amen and we might as well say
[1:07:53] it it does not matter what you heard
[1:07:55] about us what you think about us amen if
[1:07:57] we know who we are what you think about
[1:07:59] us what you heard about us amen does not
[1:08:02] change our identification we know who we
[1:08:05] are we know where we come from we know
[1:08:07] where we're standing and we know where
[1:08:09] we are going we are not going down we
[1:08:12] are not going back we are going forward
[1:08:14] we are anointed and elected to overcome
[1:08:17] by the word of God as I was reading a
[1:08:20] quote last night if it's okay I want to
[1:08:22] pick it up there again in the Mage Faith
[1:08:24] he said here I am standing here just
[1:08:26] shielding myself and the Holy Spirit to
[1:08:28] moveing now this is what you call amen
[1:08:31] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen but
[1:08:34] remember now Satan's always a skeptic
[1:08:37] amen at the sons of God how many sons of
[1:08:40] God do we have here today amen at the
[1:08:42] sons of God see you know he always does
[1:08:45] that someone with a skeptic idea and
[1:08:47] when they do that amen just he's trying
[1:08:50] to interfere amen but Christians always
[1:08:54] overcome amen I think that's something
[1:08:56] we ought to put on everything we got
[1:08:58] amen that Christians always overcome now
[1:09:02] in the message how I can overcome
[1:09:03] brother said did you notice amen the
[1:09:05] arrangements of that amen see sat with
[1:09:08] me in my Throne amen not on my throne
[1:09:11] but in my Throne see amen that is his
[1:09:15] domain see and now as Christ is the
[1:09:17] ruler through the ruler at this time
[1:09:20] amen Throne ruler at this time of the
[1:09:22] complete domain of God Amen so will the
[1:09:25] church be with him the bride will be
[1:09:28] with him in his throne in the entire
[1:09:31] domain see not on my throne but in my
[1:09:35] Throne are you with me amen not on my
[1:09:38] throne but in my Throne see where his
[1:09:40] domain reaches amen a throne is over a
[1:09:44] domain and a domain reaches just as far
[1:09:47] as its boundaries does amen and this is
[1:09:50] from eternity to Eternity Amen to him
[1:09:53] that overcometh will I grant you sit
[1:09:56] with me in my Throne as he also overcame
[1:10:00] and him sat down with his father in his
[1:10:02] throne now brother BR says it like this
[1:10:04] as Believers amen we have a Dominion in
[1:10:08] Romans 6:14 Paul said amen that sin
[1:10:11] shall not have dominion over you amen
[1:10:14] for ye are not under the law amen but
[1:10:17] you are under grace in the church age
[1:10:20] book he says our Dominion is the
[1:10:22] dominion over sin and it is enforced
[1:10:25] through the power that is in the spirit
[1:10:28] of Christ amen that indwells us amen so
[1:10:32] our Dominion is over sin and the way we
[1:10:35] force that Dominion into effect is by
[1:10:38] the spirit of Christ that is dwelling in
[1:10:41] US amen every Kingdom on Earth is going
[1:10:44] to be tored down amen but ours will
[1:10:47] remain forever amen I think the
[1:10:49] scripture speaks of us amen not as just
[1:10:52] being church members amen but it's being
[1:10:54] of Kings amen and Priests under God Amen
[1:10:57] now can I say this you are Kings in the
[1:11:00] present amen as well as you are Kings in
[1:11:03] the future in Revelation 1 15 from Jesus
[1:11:05] Christ who is the faithful witness the
[1:11:08] first begotten of the dead and the
[1:11:10] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[1:11:12] him that loved us amen and washed us
[1:11:16] from our sins in his own blood amen now
[1:11:18] watch this and hath made us Kings and
[1:11:21] Priests unto God Amen and his father to
[1:11:24] him be glory and Dominion forever and
[1:11:28] ever amen brother said now watch those
[1:11:30] four words he ha made us he said there
[1:11:33] are certain truths amen that we need to
[1:11:36] emphasize amen and this is one of them
[1:11:40] amen now when a prophet says amen
[1:11:42] there's something to emphasize amen then
[1:11:44] we ought to emphasize it and he said he
[1:11:46] hath made us amen salvation is his doing
[1:11:50] salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he
[1:11:53] redeemed us for a purpose he bought us
[1:11:56] for a purpose we are Kings We Are
[1:11:58] Spiritual Kings amen oh we are going to
[1:12:00] be Kings upon the Earth with him when he
[1:12:03] sits on his throne amen but now we are
[1:12:06] spiritual Kings amen and we are reigning
[1:12:09] over a spiritual Kingdom amen Romans
[1:12:12] 5:17 for If by one man's offense death
[1:12:15] reain by one amen then much more they
[1:12:17] which receive abundance of Grace and of
[1:12:20] the gift of righteousness shall reign in
[1:12:22] life amen by one and that is Jesus
[1:12:25] Christ in Colossians 1:13 the Bible says
[1:12:29] who hath delivered us from the power of
[1:12:32] darkness and have translated us into the
[1:12:35] kingdom and that word Kingdom means the
[1:12:37] Reign amen of his dear son that I want
[1:12:41] to say this morning there is a bride on
[1:12:43] the earth who is not waiting to die and
[1:12:45] go to heaven Amen to become an overcomer
[1:12:49] amen but right here this morning you are
[1:12:52] spiritual Kings You Are Spiritual priest

[1:13:04] and the devil amen and you are showing
[1:13:07] forth his praise and glory you are
[1:13:10] showing forth himself amen for it is
[1:13:13] Christ in US amen it is Christ in us who
[1:13:17] is willing and doing of his good
[1:13:19] pleasure amen yes indeed even now we are
[1:13:23] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:13:27] Jesus now can I say this this is the age
[1:13:31] of the Overcomer we're not looking for
[1:13:33] the age we're in the age of the
[1:13:35] Overcomer the prophet of God said in
[1:13:37] adoption part one he said Canan does not
[1:13:40] represent the age of the Millennium it
[1:13:42] only represents the age of the Overcomer
[1:13:46] amen how many Overcomers have I got here
[1:13:48] this morning amen that Canaan only
[1:13:50] represents the age of the over Overcomer
[1:13:54] what is it it's the dispensation of
[1:13:56] overcoming now amen if it's okay we'll
[1:13:59] have a little church here this morning
[1:14:00] amen somebody's going to overcome
[1:14:03] somebody's going to overcome the world
[1:14:05] somebody's going to overcome sin
[1:14:07] somebody's going to overcome the flesh
[1:14:10] somebody's going to overcome the devil
[1:14:12] amen somebody's going to overcome leosia
[1:14:15] somebody's going to overcome sickness
[1:14:17] somebody's going to overcome amen
[1:14:19] 200,000,000 Devils that have been
[1:14:22] released from the river of youup Fates
[1:14:24] well listen I'm not looking for those
[1:14:26] Overcomers I'm looking at those
[1:14:28] Overcomers you are the Overcomers of the
[1:14:31] Book of Revelation amen they overcome
[1:14:34] the Devil by the blood of the lamb and
[1:14:37] by the word of their testimony amen now
[1:14:40] we might as well preach since we here
[1:14:42] amen I know people talk about the
[1:14:43] Rapture and the resurrection and oh what
[1:14:45] a great homecoming day is going to be
[1:14:47] and they can't even overcome right now
[1:14:49] and make it to the house of God they
[1:14:51] can't overcome the way they feel and
[1:14:53] praise God anyhow they can't overcome
[1:14:55] what somebody thinks about them and what
[1:14:57] somebody said about them listen if I let
[1:14:59] what everybody thought about me said
[1:15:01] about me thought I did amen I'd never
[1:15:04] preach again amen but here's the reality
[1:15:06] I know who I am and the word has
[1:15:09] identified me as a part of the seed of
[1:15:12] God who will overcome this age so if I'm
[1:15:15] going to overcome the devil I'm going to
[1:15:17] overcome my feelings I'm going to
[1:15:19] overcome my emotions I'm going to
[1:15:21] overcome criticism and so will you
[1:15:24] because you are elected to overcome and
[1:15:27] sit in the throne in a spiritual
[1:15:30] Dominion now and there now so many
[1:15:34] promises have been laid in the future
[1:15:36] you all know that so many so many well
[1:15:39] we might as well say Catholicism
[1:15:41] Devils is that okay sister Jane
[1:15:44] Catholicism Devils have laid these
[1:15:46] promises in the future healings in the
[1:15:49] future deliverances in the future amen
[1:15:51] but here's a prophet saying no we don't
[1:15:54] need Divine Healing in the Millennium we
[1:15:56] don't need Deliverance in the future we
[1:15:58] need it right now I know some people
[1:16:01] they're waiting Amen on someday to start
[1:16:03] fighting amen but here's what a prophet
[1:16:05] said he said Now's the Time where we
[1:16:07] have to fight now is the time where we
[1:16:10] have to fight Amen to win the battle and
[1:16:13] to overcome the things of the world he
[1:16:17] said and there well there won't be any
[1:16:19] fight there see amen the last prayer
[1:16:21] will be made there won't be no prayer
[1:16:23] meetings there'll be no place for the
[1:16:25] people to get saved there'll be no
[1:16:27] sickness to be healed it'll just be one
[1:16:29] great glorious thing amen and what we
[1:16:32] could as human beings this morning what
[1:16:34] could we promise what could we look at
[1:16:36] anything that would be any greater than
[1:16:38] looking to the promise of that
[1:16:40] time so we're looking at the promise of
[1:16:43] that time can I say this we are living
[1:16:46] in a special time amen and the time that
[1:16:48] we're living in is what a prophet would
[1:16:51] call adoption time now you know that
[1:16:53] Paul very plainly speaks amen of the
[1:16:56] adoption in Romans 8 he says in the 14th
[1:16:58] verse amen for as many as are led by the
[1:17:01] spirit of God Amen they are the sons of
[1:17:04] God in verse number 15 he said you have
[1:17:07] not received the spirit of bondage again
[1:17:09] to fear but ye have received the spirit
[1:17:12] of adoption amen whereby we cry Abby
[1:17:16] father in The God Who is rich in Mercy
[1:17:19] he said I'm only saying this not to mix
[1:17:21] up Doctrine amen but to straighten it
[1:17:23] out amen it was already mixed up amen so
[1:17:26] here's a prophet straightening it out
[1:17:29] and says that you might get away from
[1:17:31] this fear and scare you don't know who
[1:17:33] you are listen you're not going to be
[1:17:36] amen but now you are the sons of God
[1:17:40] Amen see you always were the sons of God
[1:17:43] Amen how was I a Son of God Amen you was
[1:17:46] a Son of God by the seed of God and Paul
[1:17:49] said amen that the election pertaineth
[1:17:52] unto the ad adopted who are a part of
[1:17:54] the seed of God and the prophet said
[1:17:57] you're already his amen by
[1:18:00] predestination amen the seed has come to
[1:18:02] life amen how do you overcome you
[1:18:05] overcome by keeping life in you amen and
[1:18:08] what is in you is the seed of God and he
[1:18:11] is the seat of life amen listen there's
[1:18:14] 900 denominations and they're dead this
[1:18:16] morning but here's a little group of
[1:18:18] people amen that's got life in them amen
[1:18:21] because the seed of God
[1:18:23] was deposited into their soul from
[1:18:26] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:18:29] the seed has come to life and no world
[1:18:31] can get in amen that's powerful brother
[1:18:34] Terry the seed has come to life and no
[1:18:37] world can get in see Christ and his
[1:18:39] alone already finished amen the seed was
[1:18:44] there I love that you didn't receive the
[1:18:46] seed at the altar the seed was there the
[1:18:50] seed was already amen when was it put
[1:18:53] there big question a lot of people's ask
[1:18:55] amen when was it put there he said
[1:18:57] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:19:01] has predestinated us unto eternal life
[1:19:05] amen see so the seed amen is not in our
[1:19:08] head amen but the seed of life is in our
[1:19:12] heart amen so this adoption is not
[1:19:15] intellectual It's Supernatural you will
[1:19:17] not learn your way into this adoption
[1:19:19] you will not study your way in this
[1:19:21] adoption you will not memor I quotes in
[1:19:23] scriptures to get into this adoption
[1:19:26] amen this adoption comes by The
[1:19:28] Sovereign Grace and the election of
[1:19:31] almighty God Amen listen what the
[1:19:33] prophet said he said we today amen are
[1:19:36] God's spiritual church with a spiritual
[1:19:39] law that is written on the table of our
[1:19:41] hearts and we are LED in a spiritual
[1:19:44] form can I break that down we're a
[1:19:46] spiritual church we're operating under a
[1:19:49] spiritual law amen now watch this and
[1:19:51] that law is written written Amen in the
[1:19:54] tables of our heart but then he says and
[1:19:56] we are LED in a spiritual form amen then
[1:20:00] what is our leadership amen our
[1:20:02] leadership is the same Pillar of Fire
[1:20:05] that led Moses and led Paul and led
[1:20:08] brother Brandon is here leading the
[1:20:10] church now how many can I can I can I
[1:20:12] get a witness here that's not ashamed to
[1:20:14] say I'm a follower of the pillar of fire
[1:20:17] I am a I am a I am a thoroughly
[1:20:19] identified follower of the pillar of
[1:20:21] fire in the AG living in well can I tell
[1:20:24] you what the prophet said he said people
[1:20:26] who follow the pillar of fire will
[1:20:28] certainly have a rough time amen but
[1:20:31] they'll be ready for the translation at
[1:20:33] that time amen that's right they'll just
[1:20:36] be ready to go in other words amen the
[1:20:39] pillar of fire in you amen that brother
[1:20:42] Wayne spoke about put your foot on it
[1:20:43] the pillar of fire that's in you amen is
[1:20:46] the same Pillar of Fire it said
[1:20:48] tribulation will be in the world and but
[1:20:51] listen I'll give you peace amen and be
[1:20:53] of good cheer I have already overcome
[1:20:57] the
[1:20:58] world now right now there's a there's a
[1:21:00] lot between us and the Rapture there's a
[1:21:02] lot of pressures there's a lot of Trials
[1:21:05] there's a lot of situations there's a
[1:21:07] lot of ill feelings and weird feelings
[1:21:08] and weirdness y'all know what I'm
[1:21:10] talking about amen what can I preach
[1:21:12] here I don't know about y'all but I
[1:21:14] about reach my I about to reach my limit
[1:21:16] of weirdness amen I'm about tired of
[1:21:18] weirdness amen this is weird that's
[1:21:20] weird this is amen come on whatever
[1:21:22] happen to just being a normal amen come
[1:21:25] on now amen well if you look at this
[1:21:27] person that's weird and this person did
[1:21:28] that so that's weird amen have we forgot
[1:21:31] that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[1:21:33] are one body with one motive with one
[1:21:36] objective and that is to see Souls amen
[1:21:39] Born Into the kingdom of God I think we
[1:21:41] ought to get rid of all the
[1:21:44] weirdness what can I preach those
[1:21:46] somebody the other day I said I ain't
[1:21:47] seen so much weirdness since fifth grade
[1:21:49] on the
[1:21:50] playground well who are you friends with
[1:21:52] who are you hanging out with amen let's
[1:21:54] get away from all that and let's get
[1:21:56] back to following the pillar of fire and
[1:21:59] letting the spirit of God lead his
[1:22:01] church in a spiritual form with an
[1:22:04] anointing behind it amen that'll break
[1:22:06] the Yoke of the enemy and'll bring a
[1:22:08] power among the church amen it's going
[1:22:10] to be hard but if you'll follow the
[1:22:12] pillar of fire you will be ready for the
[1:22:14] translation at that time Paul picks it
[1:22:17] up in Romans 8:16 and says the spirit
[1:22:20] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:22:22] that we are the children of God not we
[1:22:25] were or we will be we are and if
[1:22:28] children then heirs and Heirs of God and
[1:22:31] join HS with Christ if so be that we
[1:22:34] suffer with him that we may also be
[1:22:37] glorified together amen so if you can
[1:22:40] suffer with him if you can stay under
[1:22:42] the pillar of fire you're going to have
[1:22:44] a rough time but you're going to be
[1:22:46] ready for the translation at that time
[1:22:49] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:22:52] present time are not worthy to be
[1:22:55] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:22:58] revealed in US amen how many says Lord
[1:23:01] Reveal Your Glory in my life amen now
[1:23:04] the prophet of God said his glory is his
[1:23:06] word right and the message thingss are
[1:23:08] to be he said the church is growing each
[1:23:11] age it's allotted in the scripture here
[1:23:13] amen so God through the holy spirit amen
[1:23:17] Reveals His word by manifesting it and
[1:23:20] vindicating it his s amen showing that
[1:23:23] it's his word being brought to pass in
[1:23:26] the day that it's promised now that's a
[1:23:29] powerful quote church that God through
[1:23:32] this Holy Spirit Reveals His word by
[1:23:35] manifesting it and vindicating it
[1:23:38] hisself showing that it's his word being
[1:23:41] brought to pass in the day that it's
[1:23:43] promised so we are living then in the
[1:23:46] season amen where we are moving from
[1:23:49] just expectation into manifestation
[1:23:52] we're no longer just Gathering and
[1:23:54] saying I expect I expect I expect amen
[1:23:57] now we heard it on Monday nights Amen to
[1:23:59] expect great things amen expect great
[1:24:02] things well can I say this here we are
[1:24:04] seven days later amen and I'll say this
[1:24:07] we're not here saying expect great
[1:24:09] things expect great things God's going
[1:24:12] to do great things this week come on now
[1:24:14] amen we're not under a Pentecostal
[1:24:16] anointing where everything's built on
[1:24:18] expectation expect expect amen no we're
[1:24:21] under a bride anointing where we preach
[1:24:24] expectation but then we preach the same
[1:24:26] anointing that gives the expectation has
[1:24:29] the ability to give the manifestation
[1:24:32] and right here this week we have seen
[1:24:34] expectations transformed into
[1:24:36] manifestation we have seen people healed
[1:24:39] we have seen people delivered we have
[1:24:41] seen people restored we have seen people
[1:24:44] refreshed we have seen people renewed oh
[1:24:46] I know the devil's fighting on every
[1:24:48] hand amen but we ain't laying our sword
[1:24:51] down and we ain't taking back water
[1:24:53] we're going to keep on preaching we're
[1:24:55] going to keep on worshiping we're going
[1:24:56] to Keep On Believing because we are
[1:24:59] Overcomers and Overcomers keep life in
[1:25:04] them are you hearing me our expectations
[1:25:08] has become manifestation in Romans 8:19
[1:25:12] Paul said for the earnest expectation of
[1:25:15] the creature amen waited for what for
[1:25:18] the manifestation of the sons of God and
[1:25:22] Satan is always a skeptic of the sons of
[1:25:25] God but Christians always overcome look
[1:25:29] at this word manifestation it means to
[1:25:32] be revealed so he's waiting on the
[1:25:35] revealing of the sons of God in the last
[1:25:38] days now can I give you some quotes from
[1:25:40] the adoption series paragraph 47

[1:25:45] Bible we are living in the last days

[1:25:56] line in the camping Stone Amen in the
[1:25:59] days of the manifestation of the sons of
[1:26:02] God in the Bible see where we're at

[1:26:11] amen are you are you watching the
[1:26:12] prophet he's saying we're coming that
[1:26:14] day but then he turns and says but this
[1:26:16] is the day of the
[1:26:18] manifestation of the sons of God when
[1:26:21] the Myster that's been hid since the
[1:26:24] foundation of the world is to be made
[1:26:27] known amen this is the hour now come on

[1:26:38] God are amateur Gods how many how many
[1:26:41] ever know that how many knows Jesus said
[1:26:43] so see did you hear the law that self
[1:26:46] said you are gods and if you call them
[1:26:48] Gods which God said in Genesis 2 that
[1:26:51] they were gods because they F they had a
[1:26:53] full domain over the Dominion of the
[1:26:55] world he give him dominion over all
[1:26:58] things he lost his godship he lost his
[1:27:01] sunship he lost his domain amen and
[1:27:04] Satan took it over now don't get mad at
[1:27:06] me but that's why the devil wants us to
[1:27:08] stay amen a bunch of a bunch of
[1:27:10] Pentecostal babies amen that's trying to
[1:27:13] shout and trying to speak in tongues and
[1:27:15] trying to dance amen because he knows if
[1:27:18] the Bride Comes to the revelation of the
[1:27:21] adoption am then he said then Satan
[1:27:23] knows amen that we'll walk out in the
[1:27:26] fullness of time when the pyramid gets
[1:27:28] up to the top when the full Son of God
[1:27:31] will be manifested when the power of God
[1:27:33] will walk out and take every Power that
[1:27:36] Satan's got away from him amen and take
[1:27:39] it back to him oh Church of the Living
[1:27:42] God you are the adopted sons who have
[1:27:45] been chosen for this generation I
[1:27:48] believe in shouting and dancing and I'll
[1:27:49] shout right with you amen but let's get
[1:27:51] some some substance to shout about and
[1:27:54] what we're shouting about is the
[1:27:56] adoption anointing has come back to the
[1:27:58] sons of God and there is an authority to
[1:28:01] walk out and look in the devil square in

[1:28:05] church take your hands off my baby take

[1:28:15] there is an anointing in you to take
[1:28:18] Satan's power away from
[1:28:21] him are you hearing me we're not at the
[1:28:23] bottom we're not even halfway up the
[1:28:25] pyramid we're not even brother brother
[1:28:28] Shi can I say it like this we're not
[1:28:30] even at the near the top we have come to
[1:28:33] the
[1:28:34] top we have come to the top and the
[1:28:37] prophet said go right back to Genesis to
[1:28:39] the original what is it now the world
[1:28:42] and nature is groaning they're crying
[1:28:44] everything's moving what for the
[1:28:47] manifestation of the sons of God when
[1:28:49] true Sons amen born sons and field Sons

[1:29:13] speak Sons amen when true Sons when born
[1:29:17] Sons when filled Sons will speak and
[1:29:20] their word is back
[1:29:22] I believe we're on the border of it now
[1:29:25] Church of the Living God if we was on
[1:29:28] the border in
[1:29:29] 1960 then I must be looking at the
[1:29:32] people who has got citizenship in the
[1:29:35] land of spoken word they have got
[1:29:37] Authority in the land of spoken word
[1:29:39] they're not on the border come on Church
[1:29:42] we're not on the border of the spoken
[1:29:44] word we're not on the border of the
[1:29:46] third pull we are not on the border of
[1:29:49] all the promises of God we have stepped
[1:29:51] over the border and we are living in a
[1:29:53] land where there's a power where there's
[1:29:56] an authority where there's a strength
[1:29:58] where there's an anointing to move from
[1:30:00] one promise into another promise into
[1:30:03] another promise well I feel a spirit of
[1:30:05] Caleb on me this morning amen give me my
[1:30:08] Mountain I'm taking my mountain in the
[1:30:11] promised land everything that God has
[1:30:13] promised me ain't no devil going to stop
[1:30:15] me ain't no Spirit going to bind me
[1:30:18] everything God said I can have I'm going
[1:30:20] to have it
[1:30:22] I'm going to enjoy it are you hearing me
[1:30:26] amen what for the manifestation he said
[1:30:28] yes sir you say to this mountain let it
[1:30:30] be so brother I desire so and so a
[1:30:32] certain thing done I'm a Believer in God
[1:30:34] I give it to you in the name of Jesus
[1:30:36] Christ there's a
[1:30:39] manifestation oh brother my crops are
[1:30:41] burning up yonder I haven't had any rain
[1:30:44] I'll send you a rain in the name of the
[1:30:46] Lord God bless your crop am been waiting
[1:30:48] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:30:51] are y'all ready for this that God
[1:30:53] ordained at the
[1:30:56] beginning so you didn't just get
[1:30:58] ordained in this meeting you didn't just
[1:31:00] get ordained when you heard the first
[1:31:02] tape you didn't just get ordained when
[1:31:04] you read the first book you was ordained
[1:31:06] at the beginning come on all the way
[1:31:09] back in the back part of God's mind
[1:31:11] before the Ephesian age before the
[1:31:13] Samarian age before the can I say it
[1:31:16] like this before the fall in the garden
[1:31:19] in the mind of God you had repres
[1:31:21] presentation as an attribute of God Amen
[1:31:24] as a part of the election of God and the
[1:31:27] devil's done everything he can to
[1:31:29] interfere with the election of God with
[1:31:31] the power of God but here this morning
[1:31:34] there's some born Sons there's some
[1:31:36] filled Sons there's some true sons that
[1:31:38] are speaking to the mountain and the
[1:31:40] mountain is moving they're speaking to
[1:31:42] the tree and the tree is withering amen
[1:31:45] why because it's the season of the
[1:31:48] manifestation of the sons of God now you
[1:31:51] go read Matthew 21 and there was an
[1:31:53] expectation for the manifestation of the
[1:31:56] Son of God which s so in PL or singular
[1:31:59] only one but when you go to Romans 8 it
[1:32:02] moves from expectation of manifestation
[1:32:04] of son Amen to Sons amen plural which
[1:32:08] means there will be more than one doing
[1:32:10] the same thing yeah in the days of Jesus
[1:32:15] there was only one that was speaking to
[1:32:17] the tree there was only one that was
[1:32:18] speaking to the water there was only one
[1:32:20] that was speaking to the form amen but
[1:32:22] in the last days when true sons and born
[1:32:25] sons and filled Sons will come to their
[1:32:28] original position by the adoption
[1:32:30] message there will be a many membered
[1:32:33] body will be manifesting the power of
[1:32:36] God all over this world now there's some
[1:32:39] people they get in their mind that we
[1:32:40] can't really believe these things
[1:32:42] because he's not here in a Corporal body
[1:32:44] can I say what I believe I believe what
[1:32:46] a prophet taught that Jesus has a
[1:32:49] Corporal body and he will return again
[1:32:51] someday in a Corporal body but can I say
[1:32:54] what he said that's in the future so if
[1:32:56] you let some devil tell you that you got
[1:32:58] to wait on the Corporal body then all
[1:33:00] you're going to be doing is going to
[1:33:01] church singing some songs preaching a
[1:33:04] few sermons and just living life as
[1:33:06] normal but if you can see that there is
[1:33:08] a Divine present tense promise of Jesus
[1:33:11] Christ being here now in the form of the
[1:33:14] Holy Ghost amen not in the Pew not in
[1:33:17] the pull pits not in the music amen not
[1:33:19] in the carpet but in the flesh of his
[1:33:22] adopted elected
[1:33:23] bride now let me just say what he said
[1:33:25] here it's a lengthy quote but give me
[1:33:27] some Grace he is the faithful and true
[1:33:29] witness right now we think of that word
[1:33:31] witness amen Jesus was a faithful martyr
[1:33:34] and the Holy Ghost is the witness to
[1:33:36] that amen see the spirit Bears record
[1:33:39] that amen the world hated Jesus so it
[1:33:42] killed him but God loved him and he went
[1:33:45] to the father see and the proof of that
[1:33:47] he went to the father is that the Holy
[1:33:49] Ghost came so the very evidence he went
[1:33:52] to the father amen is the evidence the
[1:33:54] Holy Ghost has come if Jesus had not
[1:33:57] been received of the father then the
[1:33:59] spirit would not have come now watch in
[1:34:02] John 16711 you can read it when you get
[1:34:04] time he says see there the presence of
[1:34:06] the holy spirit amen in this world
[1:34:09] instead of Jesus being here can I say it
[1:34:12] to you amen be of good cheer there'll be
[1:34:15] tribulation in the world Amen but I will
[1:34:18] give you peace amen for I have already
[1:34:21] over come and have gone to my father in
[1:34:24] other words the god you're servant went
[1:34:26] through the same things you're going
[1:34:28] through he faced the same situation
[1:34:30] you're facing but he was received into
[1:34:32] heaven amen and is sited at the right
[1:34:34] hand of the father and he released his
[1:34:37] Spirit to come into the church amen and
[1:34:40] to prove that Jesus was the righteous
[1:34:43] amen he was the son of God and watch
[1:34:45] what he said I will not leave you
[1:34:47] comfortless come on but I will come to
[1:34:50] you see he sent the comforter he was the
[1:34:53] comforter and he came back in spirit
[1:34:55] somebody say Spirit up on the true
[1:34:58] church he is the faithful and true
[1:35:00] witness in the midst of the church in
[1:35:02] the midst of the church but one day he's
[1:35:05] going to come back in flesh again so
[1:35:07] there we have it there will be a
[1:35:09] Corporal body return He will prove then
[1:35:11] who is the only wise potentate is he
[1:35:13] Jesus Christ the lord of glory amen now
[1:35:16] you say brother Andrew well that's in
[1:35:17] the future amen but you're saying amen
[1:35:19] this is a present tense message well
[1:35:21] let's say what a prophet said my
[1:35:23] Ministry is differeny my Ministry is to
[1:35:26] declare him that he is here Amen brother
[1:35:29] singer my Ministry is to declare him
[1:35:32] that he is here a prophet was not just
[1:35:34] declaring his own ability to preach the
[1:35:36] word or to tie the scriptures together
[1:35:39] or to speak for Mysteries that had been
[1:35:41] hid since the foundation of the world
[1:35:43] but a prophet's obligation was to
[1:35:45] declare that there is an appearing of
[1:35:47] the lord and there is a coming of the
[1:35:49] Lord and this is the the scriptural
[1:35:52] appearing of Jesus Christ amen he is
[1:35:55] here I think we ought to climb up on
[1:35:57] every Pulpit we ought to scream at from
[1:35:59] every church we ought to scream at from
[1:36:01] every meeting we ought to scream at
[1:36:03] every service he is here the Mighty God
[1:36:07] the only wise God is
[1:36:10] here he is here he is here well somebody
[1:36:15] ought to shout it right now he is here
[1:36:18] he is here I did a study one time on
[1:36:20] that cuz we say he's here then if he's
[1:36:22] here he must be here on purpose and his
[1:36:24] purpose of being here is to save he said
[1:36:27] it's to heal he said it's to Del he said
[1:36:29] is to reveal himself as Jesus Christ the
[1:36:33] same yesterday today and forever now if
[1:36:36] he is here present tense if he is
[1:36:39] present tense here then where is he if
[1:36:42] he's here present tense where is he
[1:36:44] church amen is he in our is he in the
[1:36:46] piano is he in this wood is he in them
[1:36:49] flowers is he in that carpet is he in
[1:36:51] that cushion seat listen what a prophet
[1:36:53] said he said the lamb was one creature
[1:36:55] and the dove was another creature but
[1:36:57] when the Dove and the lamb United
[1:36:59] together God was manifested in the flesh
[1:37:02] that's right and now oh God somebody say
[1:37:05] now and now he's manifested in your
[1:37:08] flesh by being adopted sons and
[1:37:10] daughters in the kingdom of God through
[1:37:12] the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:37:15] right and you become joint Arabs with
[1:37:17] the Lord Jesus Christ oh church you've
[1:37:19] got the power if you got the faith to
[1:37:22] use it with we are not waiting on power
[1:37:25] we are not waiting on Revelation we are
[1:37:27] not waiting on a message we are in
[1:37:31] possession we're in the possession of it
[1:37:34] now let me say this to you we are not
[1:37:35] just hirs with God according to Paul we
[1:37:38] are joint HS with Christ Jesus amen we
[1:37:41] are we we are Heirs of God but we are
[1:37:44] also joint airs with Christ Jesus in
[1:37:47] other words amen if me brother Jordan
[1:37:49] brother Landon were all Brothers In the
[1:37:51] Flesh natural Brothers it was all
[1:37:53] Brothers In the Flesh amen and our daddy
[1:37:55] died amen so there's a wheel going to be
[1:37:57] read so we're all brothers so that means
[1:37:59] we're all heirs so we all go to the
[1:38:01] reading of the wheel and the the
[1:38:03] testator comes out he breaks the seals
[1:38:05] and he begins to read the wheel and he
[1:38:07] says Jordan Robinson stand up I don't
[1:38:10] know it's going to be Robinson or Glover
[1:38:12] amen he says stand up amen and there he
[1:38:14] looks at you and he says your Daddy has

[1:38:48] left you a
[1:38:50] goat

[1:38:55] so that means by being Heir we must get

[1:40:08] oh God if the world could only see that
[1:40:10] that God and man are one not going to be
[1:40:12] our the super sign was that first man
[1:40:16] that God could come into all that God
[1:40:18] was he poured into Christ and all that
[1:40:22] Christ was he poured into the church the
[1:40:25] super sign God and man together that was
[1:40:29] to be the Super sign of the last day are

[1:40:35] was to be fulfilled in the last days now
[1:40:38] can I say this the only thing we are

[1:40:42] adoption which is the changing of our
[1:40:46] bodies amen Paul said to whom pertaineth
[1:40:48] the adoption he comes in Galatians 4 for
[1:40:51] and said when the fullness of time was
[1:40:53] come amen God sent forth his son made of
[1:40:56] a woman made under the law to redeem
[1:40:58] them that were under the law that we
[1:41:01] might receive the adoption of sons and
[1:41:04] because you are Sons not will be might
[1:41:07] be you are Sons amen God has sent forth
[1:41:10] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:41:13] and he is crying ABA father wherefore
[1:41:16] Thou Art no more a servant but a son and
[1:41:18] if a son then you are an heir of God
[1:41:21] through Christ in Ephesians 1:5 Paul
[1:41:24] says very beautiful he says having
[1:41:26] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:41:29] the children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:41:32] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:41:33] will now adoption part two he says what
[1:41:36] is adoption your can can we just say
[1:41:38] what he said your adoption is not your
[1:41:41] birth your adoption is your placing when
[1:41:45] you were born again John 1 I believe
[1:41:47] we're born of the spirit of God we are
[1:41:48] sons of God but we were pre be
[1:41:51] destinated unto the adoption now here's
[1:41:54] what I'm trying to get to you for this
[1:41:55] son to the last day see now this is what
[1:41:57] hurts Pentecostal little they say I got
[1:41:59] born again praise the Lord got the Holy
[1:42:01] Ghost fine you're a child of God but
[1:42:03] that ain't what I'm talking about you
[1:42:04] were predestinated unto adoption and
[1:42:07] adoption is placed in a son so can I say
[1:42:10] this election goes with the adoption
[1:42:13] which positionally places you in your
[1:42:16] position so without the election there
[1:42:19] will be no adoption and without the
[1:42:21] adoption there will be no positionally
[1:42:23] placing in your position Paul said it
[1:42:26] like this that the purpose of God
[1:42:28] according to election might stand he
[1:42:30] said in in Romans 11:28 touching the
[1:42:33] election they are beloved for the
[1:42:35] father's sake 1 Thessalonians 1:4
[1:42:37] knowing Brethren beloved your election
[1:42:39] of God in 1 Peter 1:10 so sorry 2 Peter
[1:42:43] 1:10 wherefore rather the Brethren give
[1:42:45] diligence to make your calling and
[1:42:47] election sure for if ye do these things
[1:42:50] ye shall never fall I love that word
[1:42:53] election it is the act of picking out it
[1:42:56] is used of the act of God's Free Will
[1:42:59] which before the foundation of the world
[1:43:02] he decreed His blessings to certain
[1:43:05] persons so he didn't just throw it out
[1:43:07] there and Scatter it to whosoever will
[1:43:10] he decreed His blessings to certain
[1:43:13] persons and the decree made from Choice
[1:43:16] by which he determined to bless certain
[1:43:18] persons through Christ amen by Grace
[1:43:21] amen you are a chosen person listen
[1:43:24] friends if you're not in the election
[1:43:26] then you're not in the line of all that
[1:43:28] God was he poured into Christ and all
[1:43:31] that Christ was he poured in the church
[1:43:33] if you're going to be a recipient of the
[1:43:36] fullness of the godhead bodily you have
[1:43:38] got to be in the mind of God eternally
[1:43:41] as a seed of God waiting for the
[1:43:44] quickening power of the Holy Ghost Amen
[1:43:46] to Quicken you and to positionally place
[1:43:48] you in the age of the Overcomer how many
[1:43:51] believes in predestination how many
[1:43:53] believes in for ordination how many
[1:43:55] believes in election sure see if you
[1:43:58] believe the Bible you have
[1:44:00] to if you believe the Bible you have to
[1:44:04] believe in predestination if you believe
[1:44:07] the Bible you have to believe in for
[1:44:09] ordination if you believe the Bible you
[1:44:12] have to believe in the election of God
[1:44:15] because the only people brother Terry
[1:44:17] who is going to receive the mind of God
[1:44:20] is those who was in the mind of God in
[1:44:22] the season when the entire Bible will be
[1:44:26] revealed in the sons of the last day
[1:44:29] remember said God in his infinite grace
[1:44:31] by his election and for knowledge set
[1:44:33] these things in order and every will
[1:44:35] works just right I like that he said I
[1:44:38] would be a discouraged man this morning
[1:44:40] if I didn't believe in the election and
[1:44:42] the calling of God can I say this to you
[1:44:45] the Rapture is only for the elect the
[1:44:48] Rapture is only for the elect amen
[1:44:51] that's why brother R says amen there was
[1:44:53] a mechanic one day he was trying to
[1:44:55] start the car are you with me because
[1:44:58] the election is setting things in order
[1:45:01] adoption is setting things in order amen
[1:45:03] and listen we're not a bunch of confused
[1:45:05] people amen following this and following
[1:45:07] that and seeking after that amen we have

[1:45:55] sense enough to listen to him and so
[1:45:57] what he done was he tied the wires
[1:45:59] together amen he got in the car and the
[1:46:01] car fired up and he said in here in the
[1:46:04] last days the Pentecostals is trying to

[1:49:13] same action the same things he did amen
[1:49:16] making the word manifest oh if the
[1:49:18] church only knew it position if the
[1:49:21] church only knew its position if there

[1:49:28] in order and here shows up the pillar of
[1:49:31] fire and says here's the way it is amen
[1:49:33] and when the church comes in order the
[1:49:35] Rapture will go when it knows what it is

[1:49:43] God With Us amen at God above us amen at
[1:49:46] Christmas we look at God With Us amen at
[1:49:48] Easter we look at God With Us amen but
[1:49:50] the prophet of God said this Holy Ghost
[1:49:52] dispensation come in and continued on
[1:49:55] and will continue on by the
[1:49:56] administration of the angels to the
[1:49:58] church truly but they ordained spirits
[1:50:00] of God sent from God to carry the things
[1:50:03] out every man was a special calling back
[1:50:06] All Through the Ages angels has visited
[1:50:08] men not a worship of angels amen but a
[1:50:11] testimony see that right it'll declare
[1:50:13] God it won't have some kind of mythical
[1:50:16] something that no one understands are
[1:50:18] y'all hearing me if it's an angel from
[1:50:20] God it will not have some mythical
[1:50:23] something that no one understands in
[1:50:25] other words when you ask somebody what
[1:50:27] they believe some y'all know what I'm
[1:50:28] talking about they won't say well uh you
[1:50:30] have to pray for it it's
[1:50:32] Revelation now there's been some moves
[1:50:34] around the message that when you really
[1:50:36] pinned him down and he said what do you
[1:50:38] guys believe oh it's a
[1:50:40] revelation well show me one quote Oh
[1:50:43] it's a revelation it's only a
[1:50:45] revelation and then there oh I'm getting
[1:50:47] in trouble now then there's been some
[1:50:49] some moves well we might as well preach
[1:50:51] for here there's been some moves and
[1:50:53] they say this well you know what amen
[1:50:55] I'm not saying it is but could it
[1:50:58] be come on but here's a prophet that's
[1:51:02] saying this is it this is it here's the
[1:51:05] understanding it's not a mythical Mind
[1:51:07] of a man it's not something so confusing
[1:51:09] no one can understand come on Church
[1:51:12] it'll speak of Jesus Christ and will
[1:51:14] testify of Jesus Christ and will produce
[1:51:17] Jesus Christ let me go on record and say
[1:51:20] this message has spoken of Jesus Christ
[1:51:23] it is testified of Jesus Christ amen and
[1:51:25] I can look at you this morning and say
[1:51:27] it has produced Jesus Christ to the
[1:51:30] people God is in his son God is in his
[1:51:32] people amen look what he done in the
[1:51:34] days of his sunship now look what he's
[1:51:36] doing here in the Holy Ghost
[1:51:38] dispensation how he raised up among the
[1:51:40] people he's showing the same signs and
[1:51:43] wonders quickening the dead is that
[1:51:44] right amen raising the dead that
[1:51:47] physically died amen raising them back
[1:51:49] to life again what do you Sayer one more
[1:51:52] he said we're living in the Holy Ghost
[1:51:54] dispensation where Christ has been
[1:51:56] glorified and the holy spirit's here
[1:52:00] come on that's what he
[1:52:03] said so be careful now and don't you
[1:52:06] judge it I'd just say nothing and walk
[1:52:08] away if you didn't believe it if you
[1:52:10] can't be a believer fell said not long
[1:52:12] go I don't care what happens I don't
[1:52:13] believe it I said it's not for
[1:52:15] unbelievers it's for believers see it's
[1:52:17] not not for unbelievers it was it
[1:52:20] intended for them can I say this as
[1:52:22] plain as I know how this adoption
[1:52:24] message of the election overcoming grace
[1:52:27] of God is only to the elect the prophet
[1:52:31] of God said that's why the message don't
[1:52:32] get the right away like it should have
[1:52:34] it's only to the elect to the church
[1:52:38] Abraham seed so in other words how many
[1:52:41] can say Lord I'm elect thank God I'm
[1:52:43] elect amen now can I say this only the
[1:52:46] elect can repent of their sins only the
[1:52:49] elect can resist the devil only the
[1:52:51] elect can receive the true baptism of
[1:52:53] the Holy Ghost can I just bring it on
[1:52:55] down and only the elect can
[1:52:59] overcome only the elect can overcome can
[1:53:03] I say it to you like this we are elected
[1:53:05] to overcome in Revelation 3:21 to him
[1:53:09] that overcometh that word overcome means
[1:53:11] to carry off the victory amen now watch
[1:53:13] this it is to come off Victorious of
[1:53:16] Christ Victorious over all of his foes
[1:53:19] and of Christian that hold fast their
[1:53:21] faith even unto death against the power
[1:53:23] of their foes and temptations can
[1:53:26] somebody say Temptations and
[1:53:28] persecutions which one is arraigned or
[1:53:31] goes to law Amen to win the case and to
[1:53:34] maintain one's cause so there's a
[1:53:37] there's an overcoming to overcome the
[1:53:39] foes of the enemy to overcome the lies
[1:53:42] of the devil amen and to step into the
[1:53:44] victory of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:53:46] amen and to win the case and to come to
[1:53:49] a complete Victory can I can I can I
[1:53:51] turn a corner here this morning amen I'm
[1:53:53] not going to preach all day but I want I
[1:53:54] want to lay this in brother preaches
[1:53:57] this message how can I overcome he
[1:53:59] preaches it in the form of a question
[1:54:01] and he says overcome means to stand the
[1:54:03] test that's right like all the old
[1:54:05] Saints did like Jesus did amidst all of
[1:54:08] his enemies he stood the test everything
[1:54:10] he was tested against he stood it in the
[1:54:12] very face of sickness and him being the
[1:54:15] Messiah he healed them in the face of
[1:54:17] death he brought it back to life in the
[1:54:19] face of Calvary his own death he
[1:54:21] defeated Oh my he defeated it by
[1:54:24] surrendering himself why by the word he
[1:54:27] said you destroy this Temple but in
[1:54:30] three days I'll raise it up again amen
[1:54:32] and in the presence of death he defeated
[1:54:34] it in the presence of death he are you
[1:54:37] hearing me in the presence of death he
[1:54:41] defeated
[1:54:43] it Oh Glory to God in the presence in
[1:54:48] the presence of hell he defeated hell
[1:54:50] and overcome hell in the presence of the
[1:54:53] Grave he overcome the grave why all by
[1:54:56] the word and humility there's the real
[1:55:00] man there's the one to make your example
[1:55:03] see he defeated everything and overcome
[1:55:06] it so we now have the question how can I
[1:55:10] overcome by the word through humility
[1:55:13] you can overcome whatever is in front of
[1:55:15] you now can I say this overcome means to
[1:55:19] overcome Temptation in Hebrews 4:15
[1:55:22] Jesus says or the Bible says of Jesus we
[1:55:24] have not a high priest which cannot be
[1:55:27] touched with the feeling of our
[1:55:28] infirmities but was in all points
[1:55:30] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[1:55:33] now watch what he says Temptation was
[1:55:35] for him you know that he was tempted by
[1:55:37] drinking he was tempted by women he was
[1:55:40] tempted by everything that could be
[1:55:42] tempted by he was tempted by everything
[1:55:44] that we are he was a man and yet you
[1:55:47] couldn't put a mark on him because
[1:55:49] overcome means to recognize the devil in
[1:55:53] every one of his tricks a lot of people
[1:55:55] says there is no devil it's just a
[1:55:57] thought don't you believe that there's a
[1:55:59] real devil it's just as real as you are
[1:56:01] a real devil and you must recognize him
[1:56:04] real are you awake this morning you must
[1:56:07] recognize him real and the moment that
[1:56:10] you recognize he's real and that he's
[1:56:13] against you then to overcome you must
[1:56:16] recognize that the god that's in you is
[1:56:19] greater and mightier than he is that's
[1:56:21] the one that's in you has already
[1:56:24] overcome him glory to God Amen there'll
[1:56:27] be tribulation in the world there'll be
[1:56:30] Temptation in the world but there'll be
[1:56:32] peace under the believer and be of good
[1:56:34] cheer for I have already overcome the
[1:56:37] world and have taken residency in your
[1:56:40] soul by the revelation of who I am
[1:56:44] having preeminence oh you was
[1:56:46] predestinated to give preeminence to
[1:56:48] this word you were predestinated to give
[1:56:51] a life to this word you were
[1:56:53] predestinated and elected and for
[1:56:55] ordained and chosen of God to overcome
[1:56:58] leosia and to set in the throne not as
[1:57:02] the overcome as the Overcomer not as the
[1:57:05] defeated as the defeat not as the
[1:57:08] conquered as the conquered Oh Glory to
[1:57:12] God I want to say with everything that's
[1:57:13] within me hell will not conquer this
[1:57:16] bride we'll conquer hell come on church
[1:57:20] I might as well just preach I'm this
[1:57:21] close to it I don't believe I'm looking
[1:57:23] at people that's going to come out of
[1:57:25] lay out of sea by the skin of their
[1:57:26] teeth and barely holding on I believe
[1:57:30] I'm looking at some serpent bruising
[1:57:32] devil stomping Church Living God and'll
[1:57:35] overcome every devil overcome every sin
[1:57:38] overcome everything of
[1:57:40] world I'll tell you how sure I am of you
[1:57:43] by this word is an overcomer I don't
[1:57:45] believe on the day there'll be one devil
[1:57:46] be able to raise its head and say nobody
[1:57:49] could defeat
[1:57:51] me testing one two is it still working
[1:57:53] it's still working I'll tell you again
[1:57:56] how sure I am of you as a Believer by
[1:57:58] this word I do not believe on the day of
[1:58:01] rapture there'll be one devil be able to
[1:58:04] raise its head and say nobody conquered
[1:58:07] me nobody conquered me I believe every
[1:58:10] devil is going to have to bow his head
[1:58:13] and say I was conquered I think when God
[1:58:15] ask that devil who are you he'll say I'm
[1:58:17] the devil of lust and he'll say what are
[1:58:19] you he'll have to say conquered he'll
[1:58:21] say what devil are you I'm the devil of
[1:58:23] pornography I ripped in the lives of

[1:58:37] word cancer will have to bow its head
[1:58:39] and say he conquered me at Calvary he

[2:04:47] ain't going to answer to my p no more
[2:04:50] the blood speaks for me the blood has
[2:04:52] taken my voice and the blood says I'm
[2:04:55] free the blood says I'm pure the blood
[2:04:57] says I'm holy the blood says God is in
[2:04:59] me and he's walking through me and the
[2:05:02] devil's under my
[2:05:05] feet when he was on the cross we were on
[2:05:10] his mind I don't have time to read it to
[2:05:12] you can I preach it to you three great
[2:05:14] assaults on Jesus Mal Matthew 4 how can
[2:05:17] overcome three great assaults right
[2:05:19] three great assaults brother said watch
[2:05:21] that third assault was to give him the
[2:05:24] kingdom to give him a domain without the
[2:05:26] cross he said he did not want him to
[2:05:28] shed his blood he said because the
[2:05:31] minute oh God the minute his blood was
[2:05:34] shed you were no longer claimed by just
[2:05:36] a feeling you were no longer claimed by
[2:05:38] just a sensation you were claimed by the
[2:05:41] blood and the devil knew if he was going
[2:05:44] to get you he wouldn't just go for your
[2:05:45] feelings he wouldn't just go for your
[2:05:47] Sensations he couldn't just go through
[2:05:49] your emotion but now if he's going to
[2:05:51] get you buddy he got to go through the
[2:05:53] blood but I want to say this morning the
[2:05:55] blood is greater and the blood is
[2:05:57] stronger and the blood still has power
[2:06:00] it still has the power to save it still
[2:06:02] has the power to come on church I think
[2:06:05] it's time we get up out of our feelings
[2:06:07] and get up out of our little weirdness
[2:06:08] and will so and so hurt me and so and so
[2:06:10] offended me I think it's time to come
[2:06:12] back to a revelation I'm covered by the
[2:06:15] blood I'm walking by the blood my f is
[2:06:18] under the blood my church is under the
[2:06:20] blood everything about me is under the
[2:06:23] blood sister Becky I'm standing here
[2:06:25] identified as a vessel who's been
[2:06:27] claimed for the manifestation of the
[2:06:30] adoption of the sons I'm not backing up
[2:06:32] to that devil I'm a born son I'm a field
[2:06:35] son I'm a true son and I'm going to walk
[2:06:38] out this morning and speak to that devil
[2:06:40] and take back everything that he's taken

[2:09:30] with a nice and warm sun that's the
[2:09:32] truth God knows that's the truth I just
[2:09:35] stood there looking around with my hat
[2:09:36] off I got numb all over I thought the
[2:09:39] very God of creation it's all in his
[2:09:42] hands what he's telling me what he's
[2:09:44] telling me and I picked up my gun I
[2:09:47] wiped off the scope I started to walk
[2:09:49] back and go down the hill and someone
[2:09:52] said to me are you hearing me and
[2:09:55] someone said to me why don't you stroll
[2:09:57] with me through this Wilderness amen

[2:10:20] was going to get back in a normal
[2:10:22] routine so we was just going to lay the
[2:10:23] Bible down and just go back and walk
[2:10:25] with the things we've been walking with
[2:10:27] amen but all of a sudden a voice said
[2:10:29] you've walked with that long enough I
[2:10:31] know you want to go back and do what you
[2:10:33] was doing before you heard my voice

[2:11:06] to walk right into a body change now did
[2:11:08] y'all catch something there when brother

[2:11:25] rain stopped and the Sleep stopped and
[2:11:28] the clouds parted and the sun come out
[2:11:31] do you know what changed that was the
[2:11:34] voice of the Creator as he was
[2:11:38] speaking as he was speaking through the
[2:11:40] wind the voice of God still the
[2:11:43] conditions oh the prophet of God said it
[2:11:45] like this amen can I can I close on this
[2:11:47] point right here

[2:11:54] your body change what is it it's the
[2:11:56] word promised before the foundation of
[2:11:58] the world and it only reflects the
[2:11:59] negative or reflect the positive word

[2:12:04] the Bride will be the same thing the
[2:12:06] word that's in you your body will
[2:12:09] materialize around that word the same as
[2:12:12] it did Sarah when that old body she had
[2:12:15] that first body it had to be changed
[2:12:17] order to produce a sun that body could
[2:12:19] not do it and this body cannot do it so

[2:12:24] receive the son can I say this brother

[2:15:18] analysis of that yes sir y'all want to
[2:15:21] take his analysis I think that the
[2:15:24] people today how many people today that
[2:15:27] are possessed with his Spirit or the
[2:15:30] spirit AP part of these Angelic beings
[2:15:32] Spirits which rotated off of God that
[2:15:35] never fell in the beginning and resisted
[2:15:39] the devil's lie in heaven
[2:15:41] amen amen can I tell you sister Anna why
[2:15:44] the devil hates you is you're a part of
[2:15:47] that and in the mind of God you resisted
[2:15:50] the devil's lie there that's why sister
[2:15:52] Leanne you're resisting the devil
[2:15:56] here if we could only receive this truth
[2:16:01] well brother Andrew it don't matter who
[2:16:03] well let me ask you this who spoke it
[2:16:05] well can I say this a Vindicated
[2:16:09] prophet and he said there only be one
[2:16:12] Prophet messenger and when he singular
[2:16:14] shall begin to sound now watch this he
[2:16:16] said an not only evidence of the word
[2:16:18] that there is more than one major
[2:16:19] prophet messenger who will reveal the
[2:16:21] Mysteries as contained in the word and
[2:16:22] who has the ministry to turn the hearts
[2:16:24] of the children to the fathers thus sayi
[2:16:25] the Lord by his unfailing word stands
[2:16:27] and shall stand and be Vindicated there
[2:16:29] is one Prophet Messer of this age one of
[2:16:31] the bases of human behavior alone anyone
[2:16:34] knows that where there are many people
[2:16:35] there's a divided opinion on lesser
[2:16:36] points of a major Doctrine which they
[2:16:39] all hold together who
[2:16:41] then yeah who then will have the power
[2:16:46] of infallibility which is to be restored
[2:16:49] in this last age for this last age is
[2:16:51] going to go back to manifesting the pure
[2:16:54] word bride that means we will have the
[2:16:57] word once again as it was perfectly
[2:17:00] given and perfectly understood in the
[2:17:02] days of Paul I will tell you who will
[2:17:05] have it it will be a prophet Messenger
[2:17:08] as thoroughly Vindicated or even more
[2:17:11] thoroughly Vindicated than was any
[2:17:14] prophet in all the ages from Enoch to
[2:17:17] this day because this man will of
[2:17:20] necessity have the Capstone prophetic
[2:17:23] Ministry and God will show him forth are
[2:17:26] y'all ready for this he won't need to
[2:17:29] speak for himself for God will speak for
[2:17:33] him by the voice of the
[2:17:37] sign so in other words there's going to
[2:17:39] be a voice and that voice was up in the
[2:17:42] mountains one day and that voice changed
[2:17:44] the conditions of the woods so that a
[2:17:47] prophet amen could come back and tell
[2:17:49] the church that I didn't just speak and
[2:17:51] say are you with me he brother M didn't
[2:17:54] just stand there and say sun come out
[2:17:56] Moon stay still wind go back Shine for 4
[2:17:59] days he didn't just say that and then
[2:18:01] all these conditions happen no there was
[2:18:04] a wind that come through the woods and
[2:18:07] all of a sudden brother the ter there
[2:18:08] was a whoosh and then there was a stop
[2:18:11] in other words he spoke but his words
[2:18:13] didn't just go out there but God heard
[2:18:16] his words and God turned back and spoke
[2:18:19] and he heard him speak you say brother
[2:18:21] Andrew I wish I'd have been amen out
[2:18:22] there in Colorado well if you got that
[2:18:24] clip that clip to play there in the

[2:18:57] you have no legal rights Jesus Christ my
[2:19:01] Lord stripped you of every Authority you
[2:19:03] had when he died at Calvary to take away
[2:19:05] sin and sickness and you're nothing but
[2:19:09] a bluff and we're calling your bluff
[2:19:12] amen you know that when our Lord came to

[2:22:50] infallibility is
[2:22:52] back what he in The Bride of Jesus
[2:22:57] Christ I want you to stand to your feet
[2:22:59] with us this

[2:23:36] infallibility has moved into true Sons
[2:23:40] born Sons field Sons yeah can I leave
[2:23:45] you this this is why why you must preach
[2:23:48] this message that's
[2:23:50] right it's the only infallible
[2:23:55] message yeah in the Earth today that's
[2:24:01] right now I'm going to say it it may not
[2:24:03] be popular but I'm not one that believes
[2:24:05] that if you get in the Revelation this
[2:24:07] message you'll dry up and become a cold
[2:24:09] intellectual
[2:24:10] [Music]
[2:24:12] no I know that's not popular to say
[2:24:15] anymore but he say well you can't get in
[2:24:17] the revelation of it and you can't study
[2:24:19] and you can't dig it out cuz you do that
[2:24:20] you won't be able to dance you won't be
[2:24:21] able to shout you be able to praise God
[2:24:22] you
[2:24:24] got I believe the reason why we're
[2:24:26] shouting is because this
[2:24:28] Revelation has quickened in our heart
[2:24:31] yeah we've already
[2:24:33] overcome because the one that's in us
[2:24:36] has already overcome that's right and
[2:24:38] we're walking every day of our life for
[2:24:40] the bill and we're speaking to Devils
[2:24:43] we're speaking to atmospheres we're
[2:24:45] speaking over our home we're speaking
[2:24:47] over our children and God is coming
[2:24:49] right behind it coming right behind it
[2:24:52] and manifesting the power of the
[2:24:55] infallibility of the spoken word of God
[2:24:58] how many can say Lord I believe I'm an
[2:25:00] elected
[2:25:01] voice I believe I'm an elected voice to
[2:25:04] say what a prophet has said you've
[2:25:06] elected my voice to say this message

[2:25:13] single

[2:25:18] throne Heavenly Father Lord we thank you

[2:31:39] coming in agreement amen the word
[2:31:43] having the the preeminence in our lives
[2:31:47] and I thought of you know brother uh
[2:31:51] brother Andrew saying that the adoption
[2:31:54] is the positioning the placing the
[2:31:57] putting things in in order and God is a
[2:32:01] god of order in me I remember uh going
[2:32:06] uh taking the family uh uh just before
[2:32:10] we moved here i' gotten Faith a violin
[2:32:14] and and uh found a teacher for there
[2:32:17] back in Tulsa Oklahoma that played in
[2:32:20] the
[2:32:21] symphony and uh so she was teaching
[2:32:24] starting to teach faith and things and
[2:32:27] so she invited us to uh to a concert
[2:32:32] that she was part of and and uh so we
[2:32:36] got free tickets and we went and before
[2:32:39] the concert we we had sat there and all
[2:32:43] them musicians up there playing their
[2:32:45] own way
[2:32:47] they were and they were talented
[2:32:48] musicians but they were just doing their
[2:32:50] own thing and it hurt my ear so bad and
[2:32:53] I I to told uh my wife and said man if
[2:32:57] if that's what that is that's that's I
[2:32:59] don't want to be here that's that's
[2:33:01] horrible and and I knew they were
[2:33:03] talented musicians but but everybody was
[2:33:06] just doing their own thing and and and
[2:33:09] all of a sudden just it just got
[2:33:12] quiet and then the conductor come start
[2:33:15] walking walking and everybody stood up
[2:33:18] and started clapping and and he
[2:33:21] bows then he turns around and he looks
[2:33:23] at all the musicians and they're just
[2:33:25] all looking at him then he starts
[2:33:29] beating that stick and before you know
[2:33:32] what everything everybody was doing
[2:33:33] their own thing but now they come under
[2:33:35] control of that
[2:33:37] conductor man they begin to play the
[2:33:39] most beautiful music I was so just like
[2:33:43] whoa I appreciate our music musicians
[2:33:46] here you've heard this week
[2:33:49] and
[2:33:51] [Applause]
[2:33:52] [Music]
[2:33:52] [Applause]
[2:33:54] uh I I think they're some of the best in
[2:33:57] my
[2:33:58] opinion and and it's not that they're
[2:34:02] professional musicians but brother Kevin
[2:34:05] he's he's he's a professional guitarist
[2:34:09] and I've recognized uh that he's got
[2:34:12] something special about him now we've
[2:34:13] all got they're all talented musicians
[2:34:16] but I asked brother Kevin I said brother
[2:34:19] Kevin if you could take these
[2:34:21] musicians and start teaching
[2:34:25] them Harmony teaching them Unity how to
[2:34:29] play together because you know cuz I
[2:34:34] remember them talented musicians there
[2:34:37] in that Orchestra all playing they're
[2:34:39] just doing their own
[2:34:40] thing and I thought you know if you
[2:34:42] could take these musicians they don't
[2:34:44] have to be just so the best
[2:34:46] but take them to where they learn how to
[2:34:49] play
[2:34:50] together and he's been doing that and I
[2:34:54] I tell you what I think it's just
[2:34:55] beautiful and I appreciate all these
[2:34:57] other musicians not wanting to do their
[2:34:59] own thing but just just doing what
[2:35:02] brother Kevin has taught them and it's
[2:35:05] making the most beautiful sound in my
[2:35:08] opinion and it's just creating such an
[2:35:11] atmosphere and I thought well that's
[2:35:13] just what the Lord is trying to do and
[2:35:15] this is what what brother Andrew was
[2:35:17] doing God sent us a prophet everybody
[2:35:20] was saying well I'm Baptist I'm this and
[2:35:22] I'm that and I'm I'm Pentecostal and I'm
[2:35:24] this and well I got the Holy Ghost you
[2:35:26] know he's going to teach me this and
[2:35:27] he's going to teach me that and
[2:35:28] everybody's got their own ideas but he's
[2:35:31] taken a a a
[2:35:34] people now in our own selves we're
[2:35:37] nothing but we have come under
[2:35:40] subjection to a
[2:35:42] message and we're coming in harmony with
[2:35:46] this word and what is an average people
[2:35:49] that denominations have been trying to
[2:35:51] make out of us cannot do it but God
[2:35:55] would send a profit and we're coming
[2:35:57] under Harmony and the Very God is now
[2:36:01] been able to take our lips and deity
[2:36:05] speaking through US deity been able to
[2:36:08] reflect itself through us and it's
[2:36:10] nothing that we're doing it's just a
[2:36:12] people coming in harmony with his word
[2:36:15] aren't you glad you're a part of that
[2:36:18] amen a message that is actually bringing
[2:36:20] us into adoption it's the same spirit
[2:36:23] that uh uh uh Luther had it's the same
[2:36:27] spirit that Wesley had they had the
[2:36:30] spirit of adoption back then it's the
[2:36:32] same Holy Ghost but something the
[2:36:35] conductor has come to bring us in
[2:36:37] harmony with his word to where it's not
