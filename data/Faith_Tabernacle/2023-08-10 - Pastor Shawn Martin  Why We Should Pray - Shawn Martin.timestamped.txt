[20:16] Janice as well and um
[20:19] amen and if you have your Bibles we're
[20:22] going to
[20:26] first of all turn to the book of
[20:30] second Thessalonians
[20:33] a man or a first Thessalonians chapter 5
[20:39] man
[20:41] and we want to
[20:44] remember
[20:45] brother Tim Farmers meeting this Friday
[20:49] starting and then Friday Saturday and
[20:52] Sunday and Friday and Saturday it's
[20:55] going to be at seven o'clock
[20:57] and so um
[21:00] it's Friday night's not going to be in
[21:03] the tent
[21:05] and they do that to the
[21:10] tornado warning they had taken the tent
[21:13] down
[21:15] but so it's going to uh
[21:19] be at the Rural Retreat Community Center
[21:22] their Rural Retreat Community Center
[21:26] and I've got the address if if you
[21:29] need that and and
[21:32] but then Lord willing the Saturday night
[21:35] service is going to be
[21:37] there at um in in the tent Under the
[21:41] Tent and so
[21:44] anyways I believe in the Lord to
[21:48] be with the services there I think
[21:52] brother Amos would be ministering Friday
[21:54] night and
[21:55] brother Joe Farmer
[21:57] uh Saturday night and then brother Tim
[22:00] Farmer Sunday so we want to keep them in
[22:04] prayer keep the the meeting in prayer
[22:06] and just believe in God bill
[22:08] uh do a great work
[22:10] and also we're going to only have one
[22:15] service this coming Sunday
[22:17] and we we're going to
[22:21] um
[22:22] I'm mainly doing it for the the young
[22:25] young people but anyone that wants to
[22:27] come
[22:28] and we're going to be having a a little
[22:33] service there at the nursing home at the
[22:36] Heritage Hall
[22:38] and that's going to be 3 30 to 4 30 and
[22:43] so I'm going to make it a a lack of
[22:47] service so if you want to come
[22:49] uh just we're not going to you know no
[22:53] talking and walking around and all that
[22:56] stuff uh we're we're just going to try
[22:59] to make it like a service
[23:01] and man we just don't want any
[23:05] distractions
[23:07] and so but if you'd like to come sing
[23:10] and we we would like to have you and be
[23:15] part of it and
[23:17] you know I I believe that there's uh
[23:19] there's got to be some so out there that
[23:21] we can reach and uh you know brother
[23:25] brother Branham he um
[23:27] LED that 90 year old lady to the Lord
[23:31] and and talking uh just listening to him
[23:37] the other day and he said that the uh
[23:39] there was a 75 year old 76 year old lady
[23:42] lived all of her life without serving
[23:45] the lord and and when she got about 75
[23:49] 76 she gave her heart to the Lord and
[23:51] and just shortly after went home to be
[23:54] with the Lord and so he says the Lord
[23:57] the Lord reached her and spared spared
[24:00] her life to where she could uh accept
[24:02] him and so you know that's that's what
[24:06] we're all about is trying to get souls
[24:08] amen
[24:10] and so um anyways uh here first
[24:15] Thessalonians
[24:17] the fifth chapter and the 17th verse and
[24:20] it's just a
[24:22] just a short
[24:25] reading here
[24:26] that it says pray without ceasing
[24:30] can you say that with me pray without
[24:33] ceasing
[24:34] amen let's just bow our hearts and our
[24:38] heads to the Lord and
[24:40] just ask for his help Father
[24:45] Lord as the songs have been sung the
[24:49] Praises have gone forward
[24:52] father
[24:54] I believe it has to
[24:58] warm your heart
[25:00] Lord as you redeemed set here tonight in
[25:04] a world of corruption
[25:07] when men are lovers of pleasure and
[25:10] they're turning aside to worldly things
[25:13] and leaving your feet dirty
[25:16] in the corner Lord
[25:19] that Hears A people that is expressing
[25:21] their love to you
[25:23] and father our desires that you would
[25:26] now speak to us
[25:27] through your word Lord and you know
[25:30] every need that is present
[25:33] we ask that you would just come Among Us
[25:36] now
[25:37] make yourself at home father
[25:40] feel welcome
[25:42] and Lord whatever you'd want to do in
[25:44] our hearts we pray that you would do it
[25:46] and meet every need is our prayer
[25:49] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[25:52] says
[25:53] amen then we've got another scripture
[25:57] first Timothy
[26:01] First Timothy 2
[26:05] and um
[26:08] if I can find it here
[26:13] amen
[26:20] getting close
[26:23] all right so first Timothy Chapter 2 and
[26:28] verse
[26:29] [Music]
[26:29] um
[26:31] eight we'll just do there
[26:35] it says I will that every I will
[26:38] therefore that men pray everywhere
[26:42] lifting up holy hands without wrath and
[26:47] doubting amen you can have your seats
[26:52] this evening in my title
[26:56] for just a few moments it will be
[27:00] um
[27:01] why we should pray
[27:04] and maybe
[27:08] very little is talked about prayer
[27:13] but it's going to be just a simple
[27:15] subject and but
[27:18] I guess I'm
[27:20] sharing uh my heart
[27:23] the experiences that I've been going
[27:25] through
[27:27] and
[27:29] I believe that
[27:31] prayer is important
[27:34] and
[27:36] um
[27:37] you know it's it's it's important that
[27:39] we pray
[27:41] and um
[27:44] I think every believer understands uh
[27:49] that prayer is part of Christianity and
[27:52] but maybe we underestimate the value of
[27:55] Prayer and and its importance but
[27:58] nonetheless we we do have places uh that
[28:03] uh or set aside or whatever that that uh
[28:08] um where we can pray
[28:11] uh for one the the this place the church
[28:15] house should be a place of Prayer
[28:18] and Jesus even said you know my house
[28:22] shall be called The House of Prayer
[28:24] if there's ever a time uh not not
[28:27] necessarily that we come here to
[28:29] fellowship with one another
[28:31] uh but it's it's set aside for us to
[28:35] meet with God
[28:36] and uh but also our home
[28:40] our home should be a place of prayer but
[28:44] the prophet says that it should be a
[28:47] constant
[28:48] place of Prayer that's that's what our
[28:51] our our our our
[28:53] uh uh homes every one of our homes
[28:56] should be is a constant place of Prayer
[29:00] but we know that God will hear our
[29:03] prayer anywhere we're at and and
[29:07] something about prayer Jesus encourages
[29:11] us to not just pray but to get along
[29:15] alone and and pray
[29:18] and here in Matthew 6 6 it says when
[29:23] thou herest or when thou prayest enter
[29:25] into thy closet
[29:27] and when thou has shut thy door pray to
[29:31] thy father which is in secret and thy
[29:33] father
[29:34] which seeth in secret shall reward thee
[29:38] openly
[29:39] and so then this tells us that you know
[29:43] uh it's
[29:45] there there's times in our life that
[29:48] it's it's a it's our prayer should just
[29:51] be alone with God
[29:53] alone not not with our family it's good
[29:57] to always pray with your family and I I
[30:00] come up short in that in in in in lot
[30:04] but I think every every night we should
[30:06] all together our families together
[30:09] and we should pray
[30:11] and uh but prayer uh
[30:15] also you know is is when we come in here
[30:19] we're praying but but then there's that
[30:22] time that we should get along with God
[30:25] just just just us and him
[30:28] and and pray and you know uh uh the
[30:33] woods the mountains
[30:35] are secret places
[30:38] is is a time just to get out and get
[30:40] alone and and talk with god
[30:43] um there and and the Bible talks of how
[30:46] that Jesus went to the mountain alone to
[30:50] pray and he done that often
[30:53] he he went alone just to get get along
[30:57] and and pray to the father
[31:00] and so brother Brown says when we pray
[31:03] in secret in other words when we get
[31:05] alone in in prayer he said there's some
[31:09] there seems to be something to the
[31:12] prayer that takes all the hypocrisy out
[31:16] of it
[31:16] it's because you're you're you're not
[31:19] just voicing with with others but but
[31:22] it's just you and God uh uh you and you
[31:25] begin to tell him your heart you begin
[31:27] to relay things that maybe you wouldn't
[31:30] want to share with anyone else and it's
[31:32] it it comes from the depth of our hearts
[31:36] and he says we we seem to get in better
[31:39] connection with God When We Get Alone
[31:42] and and so there's a reason why Jesus
[31:45] would tell us to get along pray in
[31:47] secret it's it's that there there's
[31:50] there's a connection there that that
[31:52] that you have a better connection and
[31:57] brother Brad um another place it says
[31:59] when we are alone we usually pray
[32:01] different than what we would if we pray
[32:05] it in the church
[32:07] when we're around people our prayer may
[32:09] be uh uh uh
[32:13] uh not not not as secret or not as
[32:17] Intense or not as uh open as we would
[32:21] when we're alone but it's when we're
[32:24] alone the greatest Revelation in
[32:27] Inspiration uh uh comes and and brother
[32:31] Branham another place he says if we
[32:33] would take more time to get along with
[32:35] God we would live a better life
[32:39] more Victorious Life In Christ
[32:43] so so I I think that these things are
[32:47] secrets that that you and I are blessed
[32:50] to to to know by by uh uh believing the
[32:55] message is the prophet is giving us uh
[32:58] Sharon's secrets to our Christian Life
[33:01] that if you want a Victorious life if
[33:04] you want a better life in Christ get
[33:06] along with God and and and pray now the
[33:11] prophet never devalued prayer he
[33:14] actually told us how essential uh prayer
[33:18] is to us and he even said that he spent
[33:22] uh a great part of his life in prayer
[33:26] brother Branham never took it uh uh
[33:29] lightly that he was just that he was a
[33:31] prophet he had a greater understanding
[33:33] of him being a prophet he was at a
[33:36] greater understanding as his ministry
[33:38] progressed that he was the Elijah of
[33:40] Malachi 4 and that he was the the
[33:43] seventh angel of of Revelations 10 7 and
[33:47] and he was his ministry was that of Luke
[33:51] 17 30 and and all of these things and
[33:54] but yet yet it it never them Revelations
[33:57] never uh uh got him to a place where he
[34:02] felt he didn't need to pray to God and
[34:05] get along with God it it actually it
[34:08] brought a greater responsibility I
[34:11] believe of or an awareness of how much
[34:14] he needed to pray and I think that is
[34:17] the the same thing with you and I as as
[34:20] the Revelation begins to uh become more
[34:24] clearer to us of this adoption and us
[34:27] being sons of God and and and us being
[34:30] the bride of Christ it it shouldn't take
[34:33] us away from prayer but it it it should
[34:37] put such an awareness that if this if
[34:40] we're part of such a Ministry if for
[34:44] part of such a saying that the Bible
[34:46] speaks of and and we're in the greatest
[34:49] stage ever and we're in the final of of
[34:52] of of of God's Vision it should cause us
[34:57] to pray even that much the more
[35:01] now you know brother Brown just re-quote
[35:04] here he said friends you may laugh too
[35:07] much you may talk too much you may walk
[35:09] too much but you'll never pray too much
[35:12] he said you may even sing too much you
[35:14] may even read too much you may even
[35:15] preach too much or whatever uh uh but
[35:19] you'll never pray too much
[35:21] prayer is valuable it's something that
[35:24] you could never ever ever do too much
[35:28] and another place he said now you
[35:30] Christians don't don't stay in that
[35:34] lukewarm condition anymore lay aside
[35:36] everything are you with me lay aside
[35:40] everything and just get as close to God
[35:42] as you can walk with him talk with him
[35:46] and let everything everybody say let
[35:48] everything let everything be else be
[35:51] secondary but your prayer life stay
[35:54] right with him all the time ain't that
[35:58] right so so these are are are uh uh you
[36:03] know I I think he is not just telling us
[36:06] who we are but I think he is he is he is
[36:09] cementing these promises uh uh and he's
[36:13] really putting it into our lives and and
[36:16] showing us how these things become
[36:18] active in us and and these things it's
[36:21] just just kind of like you know if you
[36:24] put in the brick two bricks together
[36:25] well you know you can you can take that
[36:28] brick off any time but when you put the
[36:30] cement in there and you put that brick
[36:32] there then that then then the two bricks
[36:35] become apart they become a unit they
[36:37] become you understand what I'm saying
[36:39] hopefully and and so so we got all these
[36:42] promises about how do we apply it to our
[36:44] lives how do we stick it to our lives to
[36:47] where we become part of this and and I
[36:50] believe that it's it's through prayer
[36:52] it's it's prayer now prayer
[36:57] is the way of Believers and this is why
[37:00] this is why you should never yoke up
[37:03] with unbelievers
[37:05] because they have a different way they
[37:08] have a different Outlook they have for
[37:10] different uh pattern of doing things and
[37:13] how they handle their problems and how
[37:15] they handle their their issues and
[37:17] handle life and handle this and all
[37:19] these but but prayer is the way of of
[37:23] Believers now the Bible talks about King
[37:26] Jehoshaphat who was a righteous man but
[37:29] he had joined up with Ahab who was a
[37:33] lukewarm believer and and and to be
[37:36] honest a a lukewarm believer is nothing
[37:39] but an a religious unbeliever and and so
[37:43] uh uh it's an unbeliever in Disguise but
[37:46] uh uh so he had joined up with Ahab and
[37:50] Ahab convinced Jehoshaphat to do a
[37:53] certain thing uh uh uh without
[37:56] consulting the Lord first and and so
[38:00] when when he done that and now now
[38:02] Jehoshaphat was righteous amen but it
[38:05] doesn't it mean that a man I don't care
[38:08] if you're sitting under the message you
[38:10] can be led astray
[38:12] and I want you young people to
[38:13] understand that too you can be led
[38:15] astray I don't I don't care if you've
[38:17] got Christian parents you you you're
[38:19] sitting under the the greatest uh uh
[38:22] Ministry of of of all and or you're just
[38:25] sitting there just playing tapes uh uh
[38:27] you can be led astray and and so by
[38:31] yoking yourself up with the wrong crowd
[38:33] with the wrong things and and all these
[38:36] things and so but but
[38:38] Jehoshaphat got himself into trouble
[38:41] amen because he listened to Ahab uh uh
[38:46] and or his son ahab's son I believe it
[38:49] was and and and these things and the
[38:51] prophet said this he said now
[38:53] Jehoshaphat ordinarily now he said he
[38:57] would have prayed over the subject he
[38:59] would have thought about it first and
[39:01] and said God what must I do but being
[39:04] yoked up with unbelievers he took the
[39:08] unbeliever's way
[39:10] ain't ain't that right see he took the
[39:13] unbeliever's way and that's the way many
[39:15] Spirit-filled Christians after Revival
[39:18] they fall because they yoke themselves
[39:21] up amongst people that says well I go to
[39:25] church we're as good as the rest of them
[39:27] and you lose your experience
[39:30] so so prayer prayer keeps that Revival
[39:35] alive it it keeps that experience going
[39:38] if if you you don't have to just go from
[39:41] revival to Revival to Revival to stay
[39:44] pumped up there is a secret to keeping
[39:47] the Revival alive there is a secret a
[39:50] man to keeping god with you at all times
[39:53] and that's my prayer
[39:56] and so you lose your experience he says
[39:59] see stay right in the road no matter
[40:01] what the rest of them does you know
[40:04] where you belong you know who you belong
[40:06] to so stay right under the power of
[40:09] prayer all the time don't let them call
[40:11] you off to something else in amusements
[40:15] and so forth and saying there's no harm
[40:16] in this if there's a question to it
[40:19] don't do it stay away from it can you
[40:22] say man and I think we ought to question
[40:24] a man a lot of things that goes on a man
[40:28] whether it's in our home or amen what
[40:32] Hollywood is bringing out I know I hit
[40:33] all that all the time but I'm I'm
[40:35] finding that more and more that that we
[40:37] better hit against these things amen
[40:40] because uh uh our young people are are
[40:43] accepting these things they're accepting
[40:46] all these technology and they're
[40:48] accepting all these things without
[40:49] questions to it and said where is this
[40:52] going to lead me what is this going to
[40:54] do to me amen but I'm telling you not
[40:56] everything is applicable for your
[40:59] Christian walk with God
[41:04] now brother Brown said stay under the
[41:06] power of Prayer
[41:08] and I want to just say this you know
[41:10] Jehoshaphat had hadn't heard uh you know
[41:14] they'd got he got him himself in trouble
[41:16] they they were in a place without water
[41:19] and and you know you you know the story
[41:23] but
[41:24] Jehoshaphat had heard that Elisha was
[41:27] close by
[41:28] and and had and heard that he had poured
[41:33] water on the hands of Elijah
[41:37] and and when when he heard that
[41:40] then it it done something to Jehoshaphat
[41:45] because him pouring the water on the
[41:49] hands of Elijah it showed that he was in
[41:53] association with with the real prophet
[41:56] he brother Abraham says it it meant that
[41:58] he had some dealing with the real
[42:01] Prophet ain't that right and and Elisha
[42:04] uh of course represents the church uh uh
[42:08] uh today he's he's a type of the church
[42:10] and and Jehoshaphat knew that if if
[42:13] Elisha had anything to do with Elijah
[42:18] then the word of the Lord was with
[42:20] Elisha amen and you know uh there's that
[42:24] saying that says birds of a feather
[42:26] flock together a man and brother Branham
[42:29] says how can you expect anybody to
[42:31] believe you when you're running around
[42:33] and acting the way you do and then come
[42:35] in and call yourselves Christians no
[42:37] wonder they don't call for you to come
[42:38] and pray for them and so forth so so see
[42:41] he was talking to the the Pentecostals
[42:44] and the denomination and all of that and
[42:46] and living Wordly and then coming to
[42:49] church and and and professing something
[42:52] amen but see uh uh Jehoshaphat just
[42:56] didn't want any counsel he he didn't
[42:59] want just anybody giving him Direction
[43:01] amen he wanted somebody that that that
[43:04] had the word of the Lord and so when he
[43:07] had heard that Elisha a man was
[43:10] Associated uh uh went to Elijah and had
[43:13] dealings with Elijah then he knew that
[43:16] this man must have the word of the Lord
[43:18] and they went to him and of course you
[43:21] know although Elijah was gone the
[43:24] prophet said there was somebody close by
[43:26] a man that poured water on the hands of
[43:29] Elijah and had a double portion of his
[43:32] spirit and they went to him for the for
[43:34] the answer they didn't go to the
[43:36] counselors they didn't go to the
[43:38] seminaries they didn't go to the
[43:39] psychologist or or whatever they they
[43:42] went to him that had poured water amen
[43:45] it had dealings with the prophet of God
[43:47] ain't that right and I say to you that
[43:50] Us by by us pouring a man water on
[43:54] Elijah's message and this day shows what
[43:57] we are associated
[43:59] associated with ain't that right Amen
[44:02] brother Branham you know he says show me
[44:03] your company and I'll show you what you
[44:05] are amen that's right and and so we're
[44:08] pouring water upon this message we're
[44:11] and and you say well how are we doing
[44:12] that by our Praises ain't that right
[44:14] amen that that's what brother Brandon
[44:16] said remember he even talked about uh
[44:18] Rebecca watering the camels and and and
[44:21] the camels are it was a beast and it it
[44:24] represented power amen and and and he
[44:27] says see Rebecca watered amen the very
[44:30] power amen the Beast that was going to
[44:33] take her to her Isaac and he says we are
[44:35] watering the very power of this day
[44:38] that's going to take us to our Isaac and
[44:40] he said we're watering it by our Praises
[44:43] ain't that right amen no wonder the
[44:45] devil hates praising God in the church
[44:47] no wonder he wants us and they call it
[44:50] fanatical they call it sensation they
[44:52] call it everything and I hope there
[44:53] ain't one here that's just a flat
[44:55] unbeliever because if you are amen you
[44:57] need to get right with God Amen man
[44:59] because a prophet a man was he he now
[45:03] you know uh he he wanted Praises can you
[45:05] say amen he encouraged praises and and
[45:08] if there's ever a time that a people
[45:11] ought to praise God it's now amen
[45:13] there's people that just sit there in
[45:16] the Molly grubs and and they worry about
[45:18] every problem and they worry about
[45:20] everything and let the devil just beat
[45:22] them up amen but God has called us to
[45:25] worship God and to praise God and to
[45:28] lift up holy hands with that wrath or
[45:31] doubting ain't that right God forbid
[45:33] that we become formal in the house of
[45:35] God God forbid amen that we lose amen
[45:39] our Thanksgiving and our worship ain't
[45:41] that right amen because that's what
[45:43] you're doing you're watering you're
[45:45] watering you're keeping the power strong
[45:47] you're keeping it alive by your Praises
[45:50] ain't that right so brother Branham says
[45:52] see take God's word for it and start
[45:55] rejoicing something will happen and that
[45:58] brings the word to life as we water it
[46:00] with praises see what makes a seed grow
[46:03] water and what makes the word of God
[46:05] grow is the Praises of God in other
[46:08] places he said if you'll take any Divine
[46:10] promise of God made in his Bible put it
[46:13] in your heart and water it every day
[46:15] with the Praises of God that's going to
[46:17] come to pass it'll grow ain't that right
[46:20] so what we're doing is we're watering
[46:23] the word which is the message of the
[46:25] hour we're not watering and and and you
[46:29] know we're not watering some big
[46:30] preachers you know uh uh message we're
[46:33] not watering some uh theologians message
[46:36] we're not watering we're watering
[46:39] Elijah's message of this day ain't that
[46:41] right amen so so so Elisha was a type of
[46:45] us today amen and and Jehoshaphat
[46:49] realize that a man was up on the earth a
[46:52] man that had been us had dealings amen
[46:55] with Elisha by poor or Elijah by pouring
[46:58] water her upon him now uh uh on his
[47:02] hands and so we we look and and I
[47:05] believe that that the people if the
[47:08] people know where the word of the Lord
[47:09] and who has the real word of the lord we
[47:12] are a people that that that have the
[47:15] true word of the Lord do you believe
[47:17] that amen and of course we know the holy
[47:20] spirit is the Elijah of today amen and
[47:23] that's what we're really watering amen
[47:25] that's what we're pouring our water Upon
[47:27] Our Praises upon we're not worshiping a
[47:30] man a man the holy spirit is the Elijah
[47:33] of today that that that he is the
[47:36] prophet and and that that worked uh
[47:39] through the the the the body of of
[47:41] William Branham amen but brother Branham
[47:44] said this sick and sinful world today is
[47:47] looking to a real Church of the Living
[47:50] God who possesses a double portion of
[47:52] his Spirit ain't that right amen see but
[47:55] but Jehoshaphat amen he got away from
[47:59] prayer he he got away and and uh uh you
[48:04] know I if you notice prayer is how we
[48:08] stay connected with God
[48:11] amen prayer I I you know and and
[48:15] hopefully this will help you in some way
[48:17] but you know it's not just all coming
[48:20] and hearing the word it's not all just
[48:23] about understanding the Mysteries it's
[48:26] not all just about you know playing the
[48:29] tapes and and now you all know I'm a big
[48:31] big Advocate about that I play the tapes
[48:34] man get it in your home that message of
[48:37] this hour should be planned in your home
[48:39] all the time but but it's not all about
[48:42] that I you you you can play the tapes
[48:45] and not have relationship with God you
[48:48] you you you you you know you understand
[48:50] you can come to church how many people
[48:52] go to church in the message and still
[48:54] just fat and defeat and fatten this and
[48:57] fighting that and struggling and and all
[49:00] of these things well you've got to stay
[49:02] under the power of Prayer
[49:05] prayer is how we stay connected with God
[49:08] can you say man God doesn't want you
[49:11] just become an educated message I
[49:14] believe her he he wants fellowship with
[49:17] you
[49:19] they ain't that right so now why why uh
[49:23] uh uh should Believers pray well there's
[49:26] power in prayer Amen brother Brown said
[49:29] Prayer Changes Things
[49:32] uh prayer changes death to life prayer
[49:35] changes sickness to hell it changes
[49:37] Sinners to Saints it's prayer and I you
[49:40] know uh I I cannot change the situation
[49:43] you cannot change the situation we we
[49:46] can look at our situations that we're
[49:48] dealing with and and you know hey throw
[49:51] up your hands and quit right you ain't
[49:54] got a chance with it and and I think God
[49:56] allows these things to happen Amen to
[50:00] where we just we've talked till we've
[50:02] talked until we're blue in the face we
[50:04] we you know there's times brother Andrew
[50:06] well we we just preach and tell we've
[50:08] just preached out you know you know we
[50:11] sung until we sung out we've we played
[50:14] the music till we're just played out you
[50:16] know we've done everything till we just
[50:18] can't do it no more you understand what
[50:20] I'm saying amen but see you're not
[50:22] helpless until you get down into prayer
[50:27] can you say man it's true you you can
[50:30] you can witness well I've talked you
[50:32] know you can say well I've I've I've
[50:33] talked to my spouse and and and it just
[50:36] ain't getting nowhere I've talked to my
[50:37] children it just ain't getting anywhere
[50:39] I they're getting they're getting worse
[50:41] I've I've tried to change situations on
[50:44] my job and it just ain't helping I I've
[50:46] tried to talk and talk and talk and talk
[50:48] sometimes you're talking to the wrong
[50:51] person you need to talk to God
[50:53] can you say man stay in connection with
[50:57] God
[51:01] see so you can't change it I can't
[51:04] change it but what can change it prayer
[51:07] everybody say prayer Prayer Changes
[51:10] Things
[51:11] and Prophet said prayer is the greatest
[51:13] weapon known to man
[51:16] ain't that right
[51:17] now see it's the greatest weapon known
[51:21] to man now now I I don't think we ever
[51:24] hear of anybody saying this in just
[51:26] nominal churches but we are sitting
[51:28] under a message of Malachi 4 a man that
[51:31] is given us the secrets Amen to life
[51:34] given us the secrets Amen to solving the
[51:38] problems giving us the secrets Amen to
[51:41] overcoming and that is prayer is the
[51:43] greatest weapon well that's why we don't
[51:46] look to a politician we've got prayer
[51:48] that's why we don't look to preachers we
[51:50] got prayer that's why we're not looking
[51:52] to programs we got prayer amen that's
[51:54] all right we're not looking to
[51:56] everything else to fix the problem we've
[51:58] got prayer and every one of us has it in
[52:01] our hands
[52:02] [Applause]
[52:05] prayer
[52:06] all right that's true brother Brown said
[52:09] he gave us the strongest weapon that
[52:10] there is in all the world and that's
[52:13] prayer prayer everybody say prayer is
[52:16] what changes things
[52:18] notice what he says the Christian
[52:20] doesn't realize what a force he has
[52:24] say that again the Christian does not
[52:26] realize what a force he has when he
[52:29] kneels on his knees before almighty God
[52:32] In The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't
[52:35] realize what power that is amen we're
[52:38] not a people that should be scared and
[52:40] fearful amen and thinking oh God Amen
[52:44] we're not to sit here and imagine Amen
[52:46] Let The Devil it calls us to imagine the
[52:49] worst about our children and the worst
[52:51] about our family and and imagine the
[52:53] worst about the church and the worst
[52:55] about our lives and and and all of these
[52:57] things quit entertaining them things
[52:59] amen you got the power to change it and
[53:03] that's prayer
[53:05] prayer
[53:07] he said he doesn't realize what power
[53:09] that is if the people could only realize
[53:11] what is given right unto them
[53:14] anything that you ask for will be given
[53:17] if you can appropriate the faith to
[53:19] believe it for God's word is true
[53:22] ain't that right
[53:24] so prayer amen prayer we're we're
[53:27] looking at at Russia we're looking at
[53:29] China we're looking amen they're already
[53:31] flexing their muscles they're they're
[53:33] they're they're they're you know we're
[53:34] we're sending ships you know uh uh there
[53:37] to meet them they're the you know
[53:39] they're close to Alaska and and and all
[53:42] of these things and the world is about
[53:43] to bust and and we all know what what
[53:46] the end of it's going to be it's it's
[53:48] going to be an explosion but there's
[53:49] going to be a people that will not
[53:51] experience that they they they they're
[53:54] in a different Channel we we're not
[53:55] operating under military power we're
[53:58] operating under the power of prayer can
[54:01] you say Amen it's it's prayer see prayer
[54:04] is more powerful than any atomic bomb or
[54:07] hydrogen bomb amen it moves mountains it
[54:11] closes the mouths of lions it takes the
[54:14] heat of the out of the fire ain't that
[54:17] right amen it causes the the baron to
[54:20] receive seed amen it causes the weak to
[54:24] become strong amen prayer is is is
[54:28] there's power in prayer brother Brown
[54:30] said there's no greater power in the
[54:32] world than prayer
[54:34] can you say amen amen so you don't need
[54:37] a position in the Army you don't need to
[54:39] be high ranking you don't need to be
[54:41] next to the president the king or or
[54:43] whatever you you've got it sitting right
[54:45] with you in the in your Pew amen and
[54:48] that is prayer prayer can you say Man
[54:50] Prayer it's it's it's no greater power
[54:53] in the world than prayer Jesus said
[54:56] there in Matthew 21 and 21 and all
[54:59] things everybody say all things
[55:00] whatsoever you shall ask in prayer
[55:04] believing you shall receive amen so so
[55:08] that takes the belly aching that takes
[55:10] the griping that takes the wandering
[55:12] that takes the worry that takes the fear
[55:14] from us if we can really believe that
[55:16] scripture that whatever I shall ask
[55:19] whatsoever I shall ask and he says all
[55:22] things he didn't say something you quit
[55:24] limiting God Amen and and and and and
[55:27] and putting God in in a in in a a
[55:30] boundary that God you can only do this
[55:32] and if he gets out of there if mine if
[55:34] my children If my spouse if my loved one
[55:37] if if the situation gets out of that box
[55:39] I just don't know what I'm going to do
[55:41] amen but he says in all things whatever
[55:43] you're needing whatsoever you ask
[55:47] believing
[55:50] is this okay
[55:52] see God's word is true is it not
[55:55] God's word is true
[55:58] we read in the Bible where Jesus was
[56:00] directed to go somewhere
[56:03] because of somebody praying
[56:07] it's interesting how the prophet would
[56:09] give us the Insight on things
[56:12] that Matthew 4 35
[56:15] and the same day when the even was come
[56:18] he saith unto them let us pass this is
[56:21] Jesus speaking let us pass over onto the
[56:24] other side
[56:26] and when they had
[56:28] sent away the multitude they took him
[56:30] even as he was in the ship
[56:33] and there were also with him other
[56:35] little ships
[56:36] and there arose a great storm of wind
[56:38] and the waves beat into the ship so that
[56:41] it was now full
[56:43] now just to stop there there's a reason
[56:46] why he's going to the other side
[56:48] is that right
[56:50] there's a soul
[56:52] amen there's a soul that is lost there's
[56:55] a soul that is in need of help
[56:58] and there is a reason
[57:00] as to why
[57:02] Satan has caused this storm to come
[57:06] and the the winds and the waves to to
[57:09] start acting up to sink the ship ain't
[57:13] that right you see he he he he knows he
[57:16] knows who Jesus is he knows the power
[57:18] that Jesus he's met him before and and
[57:22] and he knows a man he he doesn't want
[57:25] that so helped he doesn't want that so
[57:28] delivered you understand what I'm saying
[57:30] if you could understand the spiritual
[57:32] warfare that we have a lot of times amen
[57:35] well Jesus had them spiritual warfares
[57:37] as well anytime you really try to do
[57:40] something for God and I'm talking about
[57:42] I'm not talking about passing your
[57:43] Donuts out to help people and to give
[57:46] bicycle ways and start your little
[57:48] programs and be a little fighting
[57:50] your little messages I'm talking about
[57:52] real power with God that if you really
[57:55] are going the only way you can help amen
[57:58] is through the message of the hour can
[58:00] you say amen amen well any time that you
[58:04] start trying to help people amen and
[58:06] whether it's it's out there when in
[58:08] Souls whether you're trying to establish
[58:10] people in the message of the hour or
[58:13] whatever I be assured all hell is going
[58:15] to break loose amen because Satan
[58:18] understands the power that you have amen
[58:21] you see if you were just preaching a
[58:23] little Baptist Doctrine amen he ain't
[58:25] gonna mess with you there amen what what
[58:27] you know you understand what I'm saying
[58:29] if you're just preaching some little
[58:30] Pentecostal uh uh uh little little shout
[58:33] and shim dig and all that it that does
[58:36] I've been there it doesn't establish the
[58:38] people that when you preach the message
[58:39] amen it starts taking the people out of
[58:42] the grass of Satan it starts
[58:44] establishing them and amen to where they
[58:47] begin to walk on their own they begin to
[58:49] talk upon their own they begin to
[58:51] exercise The Authority up on their own
[58:54] because they began to realize of who
[58:57] they are so every time a message
[58:59] breacher is preaching the message you
[59:01] know what you're doing you're delivering
[59:02] a soul from the hands of the devil
[59:05] it's true amen that's right so Jesus he
[59:09] was the message of the hour
[59:11] he was the he he was the one and he's
[59:15] going to help
[59:16] amen Satan knows it so Satan now becomes
[59:20] a spiritual warfare
[59:21] hey Jesus is trying to get some sleep
[59:23] he's tired he's had a he's had a hard
[59:25] day he's had a long prayer line he's had
[59:27] all this thing but Satan don't care
[59:29] about that if I can just sink that man
[59:31] amen
[59:33] it'll be over ain't that right amen well
[59:36] that's the same way amen if he can sink
[59:38] you if he can get you away amen from
[59:41] this message then then I don't care
[59:44] you're singing you're preaching your
[59:45] music uh everything that you do ain't
[59:47] gonna help
[59:49] can you say Amen well it's true see so
[59:53] so we find a man that that Satan wanted
[59:56] to sink it but then if you notice Jesus
[59:59] didn't Panic he didn't he you know he's
[1:00:02] had this relationship with the father
[1:00:03] and and and he was a he was a man of
[1:00:07] prayer and and so he just stood up and
[1:00:10] he rebukes the winds and the waves and
[1:00:12] and continues on to reach that one Soul
[1:00:15] ain't that right amen now who is it that
[1:00:18] he is after Mark 5 and and one it says
[1:00:22] and they came over unto the other side
[1:00:25] of the sea into the country of the
[1:00:27] Gatherings and when he was come out of
[1:00:30] the ship immediately there met him out
[1:00:32] of the tombs a man with an unclean
[1:00:34] spirit so now we understand this is the
[1:00:37] soul that Jesus was after this is the
[1:00:41] reason why Satan was trying to sink that
[1:00:44] ship destroy that Ministry tear him
[1:00:47] apart amen because of this one Soul a
[1:00:51] man that needed help
[1:00:54] ain't that right now notice he had his
[1:00:57] dwelling among the tombs and no man
[1:00:59] could bind him no not with chains
[1:01:02] because he had been uh often bound with
[1:01:05] Fetters and chains and and the chains
[1:01:08] had been plucked asunder by him and the
[1:01:12] Fetters broken pieces and neither could
[1:01:14] any man tame him and always night and
[1:01:18] day he was in the mountains and in the
[1:01:19] tombs crying cutting himself a man was
[1:01:22] stoned so this man was in bad shape
[1:01:26] ain't that right and when he saw Jesus
[1:01:28] afar off he ran and worshiped him and
[1:01:31] cried with a loud voice and said what
[1:01:33] have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of
[1:01:35] the most high God I adjour Thee my God
[1:01:37] that thou tort meant me not now it was
[1:01:40] the devil speaking through that man
[1:01:42] and he said unto him come out of that
[1:01:45] man
[1:01:46] thou unclean spirit
[1:01:49] and Jesus asked him what is your name
[1:01:51] and he answered and said my name is
[1:01:53] Legion for we are many
[1:01:55] now I I don't know maybe a couple
[1:01:57] thousand I don't know what Legion is is
[1:01:59] it a thousand or two thousand so this
[1:02:03] was a man that was totally I mean demon
[1:02:05] possessed right man two thousand demons
[1:02:09] but see he was that soul that Jesus was
[1:02:12] after
[1:02:14] and and he besought him that he would
[1:02:16] not uh uh uh sin uh that he would not
[1:02:20] send them away out of the country it
[1:02:22] says now there was nigh unto the
[1:02:24] mountains a a great herd of swine
[1:02:27] feeding and all the Devils beside him
[1:02:29] saying send us into the swine that we
[1:02:31] may enter into them and forth with Jesus
[1:02:34] gave them leave and the unclean spirits
[1:02:36] went out entered into the swine and the
[1:02:38] herd ran violently down a steep Place
[1:02:41] into the sea a man and and they were
[1:02:44] choked in the sea ain't that right uh uh
[1:02:47] they were they were about two thousand
[1:02:48] and they they were choked in the sea and
[1:02:51] they and they that fed the swine fled
[1:02:55] and told it in the city and in the
[1:02:57] country and they went out to see what it
[1:03:00] was that was done and they came to Jesus
[1:03:03] and see him that was possessed of the
[1:03:05] devil and had the legion sitting and
[1:03:08] clothed and in his right mind
[1:03:11] hey ain't that right so so so now now
[1:03:15] this is what what the devil done uh uh
[1:03:17] to them that swine what them two
[1:03:19] thousand demons done to that hurt us
[1:03:21] Hogs amen they were trying to do that to
[1:03:24] to this man and and so is it today amen
[1:03:28] Satan is trying his best to destroy the
[1:03:32] people of God
[1:03:34] you say man
[1:03:36] now I I you know I I wished I could just
[1:03:40] open my heart to you and but but
[1:03:44] you know
[1:03:46] Satan going to do everything he can you
[1:03:48] any any time that you start working for
[1:03:52] God
[1:03:54] Satan gonna attack
[1:03:57] he's going to attack you believe that
[1:03:59] you're going to attack your children
[1:04:01] gonna attack your your your your
[1:04:02] marriage you're going to attack your
[1:04:04] home you're gonna attack the church he's
[1:04:05] going to attack the he's going to attack
[1:04:08] he is just everywhere
[1:04:10] and and the people that were sent out to
[1:04:13] help
[1:04:14] them are the people that he's trying to
[1:04:16] destroy the most in my opinion we always
[1:04:19] talk about the last Soul getting the
[1:04:21] last Soul well you know I I believe that
[1:04:24] it could be that this this this that
[1:04:26] last Soul could be so demon-possessed
[1:04:28] amen but it's going to take somebody
[1:04:31] with the the real power of the Holy
[1:04:33] Ghost to set that man free
[1:04:36] all right
[1:04:37] amen
[1:04:38] ain't that right well Jesus had What it
[1:04:41] Took but now notice what caused Jesus to
[1:04:44] come after him all right brother Branham
[1:04:47] tells us see Jesus went over there at
[1:04:50] the Cry of one person
[1:04:52] one poor Maniac lost his mind perhaps a
[1:04:56] good man at one time walked up right
[1:04:58] before God but probably got in the wrong
[1:05:00] crowd might be started drinking again or
[1:05:04] something and lost his mind he lived out
[1:05:05] in the tombs where the demons lived put
[1:05:07] him in Chains and he had Supernatural
[1:05:09] Powers see and he'd break those chains
[1:05:13] and jump on men and beat them and killed
[1:05:15] him if he could and when they came by
[1:05:17] and that poor little fella maybe he had
[1:05:20] an old gray-headed mother somewhere
[1:05:23] praying for him
[1:05:26] and you say Amen now that just struck me
[1:05:28] just the power of prayer a mama did not
[1:05:32] look at the situation
[1:05:34] a mama didn't consider that that that he
[1:05:37] could break change did not consider that
[1:05:40] his her boy become a murderer amen did
[1:05:43] not consider that that the town a man
[1:05:45] did not want him and could not help him
[1:05:48] did not consider that the doctors
[1:05:50] couldn't help him psychologists couldn't
[1:05:52] help him there was no human effort that
[1:05:55] could help her boy but she began to pray
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:01] and you say man
[1:06:04] she was there somewhere praying and
[1:06:06] Jesus crossed the sea all the way over
[1:06:08] into Galleria to give Mercy to one man
[1:06:12] and he'll do the same tonight where one
[1:06:14] humble soul is calling to him he'll
[1:06:16] cross the Seas or leave the Heavens to
[1:06:19] answer that prayer it's the same Jesus
[1:06:22] the yesterday today and forever can you
[1:06:26] say amen God answers prayers
[1:06:34] we read about Zacchaeus in the Bible
[1:06:38] how he was the rich sinner
[1:06:40] did not believe that Jesus was a prophet
[1:06:42] but his wife was a follower Jesus
[1:06:46] Rebecca
[1:06:48] really random again lets us in on it
[1:06:51] on the situation
[1:06:54] and she prayed
[1:06:56] can you say it with me she prayed
[1:06:58] she prayed for her husband
[1:07:01] brother Brahm says you know when you get
[1:07:03] to praying for a fella he kind of gets
[1:07:05] in bad shape
[1:07:07] I think that's when people stop praying
[1:07:09] and thinking that their prayers ain't
[1:07:11] being answered
[1:07:12] well I prayed and look it's getting
[1:07:14] worse well now you've got a prophet
[1:07:16] that's going to tell you when you start
[1:07:17] praying things get worse
[1:07:21] ain't that right
[1:07:23] but he says if you want somebody saved
[1:07:25] or something done just start praying for
[1:07:27] them
[1:07:28] he said that's the reason we don't he
[1:07:29] said see prayer is the greatest thing
[1:07:31] was ever put in the hands of man
[1:07:36] not medication
[1:07:39] not technology
[1:07:42] not professionals
[1:07:44] prayer
[1:07:52] the prophet goes on to tell us that the
[1:07:54] night before Jesus was to come to their
[1:07:56] town
[1:07:57] Rebecca didn't sleep at all
[1:08:00] she laid beside her husband praying
[1:08:06] he said she'd look out the corner of her
[1:08:08] eye
[1:08:11] and saw that Zacchaeus Was Restless
[1:08:16] but she's praying and the prophet gives
[1:08:18] us Insight again on what she was praying
[1:08:21] and she said Lord I know you're dealing
[1:08:23] with him
[1:08:24] I know you're dealing with him
[1:08:26] now Jesus the prophet is coming into the
[1:08:29] town for this meeting down here and I
[1:08:31] want him to see him so bad Lord
[1:08:34] would you make a way now
[1:08:36] just make Kim miserable
[1:08:39] just make him so he can't sleep
[1:08:42] and there he was he couldn't sleep
[1:08:46] she had dozed off he said so that all
[1:08:48] right that's fine so the next morning
[1:08:50] she had dozed off to sleep laying
[1:08:51] praying all night and if you want your
[1:08:54] husband saved now you do the same thing
[1:08:57] Rebecca did and just start praying for
[1:08:59] him
[1:09:00] hello
[1:09:02] it ain't time that to get wrapped up in
[1:09:04] other things
[1:09:06] it it ain't time to let unbelievers draw
[1:09:10] you away from the power of Prayer
[1:09:16] amen
[1:09:17] you just start praying for him and you
[1:09:20] know out there on the sea when he's out
[1:09:22] there fishing or down there in the
[1:09:24] business and he will get so under
[1:09:26] conviction he can't sleep that's right
[1:09:28] if you want your wife saved you do the
[1:09:31] same thing and she'll come away from
[1:09:33] every card party and everything else she
[1:09:36] belongs to see yes sir she'll do it see
[1:09:39] see oh there's just great power in
[1:09:44] prayer
[1:09:46] now Jesus said here in Acts 1 and 8.
[1:09:52] and I don't know if I gave that to you
[1:09:54] may have but it says you shall receive
[1:09:57] power everybody say I shall receive
[1:09:58] power
[1:10:00] I shall receive power after what
[1:10:03] the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:10:05] you shall receive power so the Holy
[1:10:08] Ghost come to give you power
[1:10:10] ain't that right
[1:10:11] amen Power Authority
[1:10:14] see there's power and brother Brian said
[1:10:16] what is it he came to give you power in
[1:10:19] prayer
[1:10:22] where are you not just uttering words
[1:10:24] now but he come to give you power in
[1:10:26] your prayer
[1:10:29] now so now now we know what the Holy
[1:10:32] Ghost is in this age right it's the
[1:10:35] token
[1:10:37] in the days of Exodus we we we're
[1:10:40] familiar with it but God required a
[1:10:43] token
[1:10:44] and the knowledge of that Tolkien came
[1:10:46] by way of the prophet's message Moses
[1:10:50] how to apply the token came through the
[1:10:54] messenger of the hour Moses's message
[1:10:57] ain't that right and back then that
[1:11:01] token was the literal blood
[1:11:03] of uh of a natural lamb but today the
[1:11:08] token for us is the literal life of
[1:11:11] Jesus Christ living within the believer
[1:11:15] now brother Brad I'm talking about uh
[1:11:18] there in the first Exodus he says the
[1:11:20] lamb was killed in the evening time
[1:11:22] after being kept up for 14 days and then
[1:11:26] the lamb was killed and the blood was
[1:11:28] applied in the evening time he said you
[1:11:30] get it the toe can never come into
[1:11:32] existence until the evening time and
[1:11:35] this is the evening time of the age that
[1:11:38] we're living in this is the evening time
[1:11:41] for the church this is the evening time
[1:11:43] for me this is the evening time of my
[1:11:45] message I'm dying I'm going I'm moving
[1:11:48] out in the evening time of the gospel
[1:11:49] and we've come up to justification and
[1:11:52] so forth but this is the time that the
[1:11:56] token must be applied
[1:12:03] now we know again the Holy Ghost is the
[1:12:05] token the life
[1:12:09] brother Branham there in the Feast of
[1:12:11] the trumpet said the Holy Ghost has been
[1:12:13] bound up by these denominational Rivers
[1:12:16] for almost 2 000 years but it is to be
[1:12:18] loosed in the evening time
[1:12:20] by the evening time message
[1:12:23] the Holy Spirit back in the church again
[1:12:25] the Tolkien in the church
[1:12:28] ain't that right the power in the church
[1:12:31] see Christ himself revealed in human
[1:12:34] flesh in the evening time he said it he
[1:12:36] promised it that's right see so here
[1:12:39] Jesus is saying you shall receive power
[1:12:41] you shall receive the authority after
[1:12:43] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:12:45] see and so what is that token when the
[1:12:48] Holy Ghost come what is the token a sign
[1:12:53] of it's a sign that the blood has been
[1:12:56] applied
[1:12:59] still on prayer
[1:13:01] the blood's been applied
[1:13:04] Hebrews 12 24 tells us that the blood of
[1:13:07] Jesus Christ speaks better things than
[1:13:09] of Ables
[1:13:11] blood
[1:13:13] ain't that right the Justice blood of
[1:13:15] Abel cried out against Cain
[1:13:18] but the blood of Jesus Christ not only
[1:13:20] cried out it redeemed
[1:13:22] it speaks better things it makes you
[1:13:24] Sons and Daughters it hides you from the
[1:13:26] wrath of God
[1:13:28] are you with me it hide you from the
[1:13:31] wrath of God it's speaking better things
[1:13:33] amen see the blood of Abel could not
[1:13:35] hide Cain but the blood of Jesus can
[1:13:37] so old Cain come out come out today if
[1:13:41] you've been a persecutor against the
[1:13:42] word and say the days of Miracles has
[1:13:44] passed and this thing is all nonsense
[1:13:46] and things it's crying out you see the
[1:13:49] blood of Jesus cries out but there is
[1:13:51] forgiveness in it if you'll accept it so
[1:13:54] you wish we could stay on that a while
[1:13:55] the see the blood speaketh better things
[1:13:57] see belief believe for safety then apply
[1:14:01] see believe for it see here's what you
[1:14:04] want to uh you want to believe for see
[1:14:07] you want you you want your own safety

[1:14:19] hands because you've got the token
[1:14:26] we don't need a preacher for Revival
[1:14:29] we don't need some personality
[1:14:33] Pentecostals rely upon the gifts
[1:14:37] for Revival
[1:14:39] but what brings this revival is a token
[1:14:44] can you say man
[1:14:46] that's right he's telling you you're not
[1:14:48] helpless if you got a token

[1:16:16] the hour
[1:16:17] that has showed us what the token is
[1:16:21] and how to apply it
[1:16:27] so what does brother Brown tell us what
[1:16:29] does the prophet say he's the one that's
[1:16:30] given to the the the the uh just as

[1:17:47] despondent and worry and throw yourself
[1:17:50] in a panic
[1:17:53] apply the token
[1:17:57] amen good brother brother Brown's
[1:17:59] telling us what this token is about
[1:18:02] you see Moses told him what the token
[1:18:04] was apply the token and get under that
[1:18:06] token death Angel's coming but you don't
[1:18:09] have to worry about it right
[1:18:11] there was no there was no crying on in
[1:18:14] that home that had the token
[1:18:16] there was no Sovereign in the home that
[1:18:18] had the token there was no worry in in
[1:18:21] in that home that was under the token
[1:18:23] because they believed in what that
[1:18:26] Prophet said
[1:18:28] they believe that if Moses told him how
[1:18:30] to do it and they done it then they
[1:18:32] didn't have to worry
[1:18:34] we all know the story you know just just
[1:18:36] just uh um looking in into maybe what it
[1:18:40] was like
[1:18:41] the boy you know he's the first he's the
[1:18:45] firstborn
[1:18:46] he's heard what the prophet said that if
[1:18:48] that token ain't there the death Angel's
[1:18:49] going to come and kill him
[1:18:51] right
[1:18:52] and he sees he's starting to hear the
[1:18:54] crying he's starting to hear the Wailing
[1:18:55] in homes that don't have the token
[1:18:59] and he sees that dark shadow approaching
[1:19:02] and he's starting to get a little
[1:19:03] worried
[1:19:04] Daddy it's coming
[1:19:06] are you sure it's applied
[1:19:09] and daddy probably put his arms around
[1:19:10] and says son don't you worry about it at
[1:19:12] all daddy made sure that we've done
[1:19:15] exactly what a prophet told us to do
[1:19:17] we made sure that we did not slap the
[1:19:19] prophet at all that we believed his word
[1:19:21] and we acted upon what he's told us we
[1:19:24] applied the message to our home we
[1:19:26] believe it son and we've done everything
[1:19:27] that he said now let's just stand here
[1:19:29] and let's rejoice and praise God

[1:21:08] sit there and argue with the prophet you

[1:21:12] applicable
[1:21:13] all right all right come on Amen
[1:21:16] but you shall you shall receive power so
[1:21:18] he's speaking to those who have the
[1:21:20] token in this age
[1:21:23] hello
[1:21:25] there's a lot of good people a lot of a
[1:21:26] lot of good men women going to church
[1:21:30] they don't have a token
[1:21:33] there's a foolish virgin right
[1:21:36] now I'm talking about people that's got
[1:21:38] a token now brother Brian said you take
[1:21:40] a person that's lived a good life but
[1:21:42] they're always defeated
[1:21:43] oh I I tell you you know a good person
[1:21:47] oh I sure love the Lord
[1:21:50] brother Branham but see always defeated
[1:21:52] they never get a prayer answered
[1:21:55] he said you feel that little woman with
[1:21:57] the Holy Ghost one time and watch what
[1:21:59] takes place when she goes before God
[1:22:01] she's not defeated
[1:22:03] she comes boldly to the throne of God
[1:22:06] believing she has a right because she's
[1:22:09] a daughter of God by a birth take that
[1:22:12] little man so cowardly the Boss Kick him
[1:22:14] all over the place and say wait wait a
[1:22:16] minute here now see something's changed
[1:22:18] he's got the Holy Ghost see he gives you
[1:22:21] power and your fluff is full of power
[1:22:27] yeah
[1:22:29] amen and your prayer
[1:22:31] your prayer is full of power it has
[1:22:34] power because you are a son and daughter
[1:22:36] of God
[1:22:39] amen
[1:22:40] now we know it but as redeemed sons of
[1:22:43] God
[1:22:47] we are right now the prophet said above
[1:22:49] the angels of God
[1:22:51] an angel is a servant
[1:22:54] and we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:22:57] and he says which is the most thought of
[1:22:59] your servant or your son or daughter
[1:23:02] he said oh my a prayer from a saint will
[1:23:04] go a million times higher than an angel
[1:23:06] because he's a son
[1:23:09] he said oh whoo he said that's right my
[1:23:11] brother's sister the church I don't
[1:23:13] believe this side of Eternity and how
[1:23:16] we'll ever realize that what you are the
[1:23:18] position that you are that God has
[1:23:20] placed you Spirit-filled people you're
[1:23:22] sons of God and Angel's a servant you're
[1:23:25] a son and an angel can only bring you a
[1:23:28] message but you have to act you're the
[1:23:31] actor on the scene you're the son
[1:23:35] ain't that right
[1:23:37] so the angel ain't doing the praying for
[1:23:40] us
[1:23:41] all right because he's not in the
[1:23:44] position that we are in
[1:23:46] but you are in that position as a Son of
[1:23:49] God the daughter of God
[1:23:53] you're the one who is predestinated to
[1:23:55] be conformed to the image Christ never
[1:23:57] died for Angels he died for his children
[1:24:01] ain't that right
[1:24:02] Jesus never told the angels that if you
[1:24:05] say to this mountain doubt not it shall
[1:24:07] be cast into the sea
[1:24:10] he never told angels
[1:24:12] The Works that I do is greater than
[1:24:14] these shall you do
[1:24:16] he never told that to Angels he told his
[1:24:18] children Sons and Daughters
[1:24:20] these promises are to you
[1:24:24] ain't that right
[1:24:26] we are his offspring
[1:24:29] which means that we're part of God if I
[1:24:32] can say it this way we're part of the
[1:24:34] godhead
[1:24:35] because it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:24:37] glory
[1:24:38] Christ in you the hope of glory and you
[1:24:41] say Amen people might get stumped on
[1:24:43] that being part of the godhead but you
[1:24:45] know the more I see it about the message
[1:24:46] I see that's what we are
[1:24:49] amen we're part of the godhead we're
[1:24:50] part of God it was it was God above us
[1:24:53] God With Us God in us
[1:24:55] and we're at the place not God With Us
[1:24:57] God is in US
[1:24:59] can you say amen God having the
[1:25:02] preeminence go go listen to Christ is
[1:25:04] the mystery of God revealed the whole
[1:25:06] secret is God having having that
[1:25:08] preeminence in his church to where she
[1:25:09] becomes him
[1:25:11] that she is one with him
[1:25:13] she she is bone of his bone life of his
[1:25:16] life power of his power she is him ain't
[1:25:18] that right we're Made In His Image and
[1:25:21] in his likeness Angels did not come from
[1:25:24] him they were created by Him but you and
[1:25:27] I are his bride which means that we come
[1:25:29] out of him we were a part of him we're
[1:25:31] being in him all along
[1:25:36] we're not a separate entity
[1:25:40] brother Bram said we become part of his
[1:25:42] word part of his life for we are flesh
[1:25:44] of his flesh bone of his bone life of
[1:25:46] his life
[1:25:47] ain't that right
[1:25:49] and if you notice what he was Jesus said
[1:25:52] there in Revelations 1 8 I am Alpha and
[1:25:56] Omega the beginning and the ending
[1:25:58] now that that just looks like it's just
[1:26:00] just all about him and we take it and
[1:26:03] and we put it just to that one that one
[1:26:06] uh man if we can put it that way that
[1:26:10] one body Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:26:12] the ending
[1:26:13] but as the Mysteries have unfolded we
[1:26:16] begin to understand there's more to this
[1:26:21] you see he's Alpha and Omega Alpha is
[1:26:23] the first
[1:26:25] Omega is the last brother Brown said he
[1:26:27] never said what he was in between he
[1:26:29] just said I'm the alpha and the Omega he
[1:26:31] never said in anything in between can
[1:26:34] you say amen and the and the Alpha and
[1:26:37] the Omega is the same thing
[1:26:39] for he said I am the alpha I am the
[1:26:42] Omega
[1:26:44] that one person Jesus Christ is the
[1:26:47] Alpha and the Omega
[1:26:50] ain't that right
[1:26:52] now we saw him as the alpha when he
[1:26:54] walked the Earth we see what he was in
[1:26:57] his first ministry as the alpha we saw
[1:26:59] what he'd done in his ministry as the
[1:27:01] alpha can you say Amen as Alpha he was
[1:27:04] the full manifestation of Jehovah God
[1:27:06] made flesh dwelt Among Us
[1:27:09] that's exactly what he was ain't that
[1:27:12] right well then if he is Omega then what
[1:27:15] he was as Alpha he will be in Omega
[1:27:20] ain't that right so brother Branham says
[1:27:22] the first Ministry and the last Ministry
[1:27:25] thank you so much
[1:27:26] the first Ministry and the last Ministry
[1:27:29] is the same
[1:27:30] can you say that with me the first
[1:27:32] Ministry
[1:27:33] and the last Ministry is the same the
[1:27:37] first message the last message is the
[1:27:41] same
[1:27:42] I was in Alpha I am in Omega
[1:27:45] there will be a day that won't be called
[1:27:47] day nor night but in the evening time it
[1:27:49] shall be light Alpha and Omega it's
[1:27:52] become the first and the last and
[1:27:54] brother Brown said the alpha has now
[1:27:57] become Omega
[1:27:59] ain't that right and then he says he is
[1:28:02] everything what he was in the and and
[1:28:05] that he was when he walked the Earth
[1:28:07] he's everything except in the Corporal
[1:28:10] body why he doesn't need that Corporal
[1:28:14] body on Earth for you are his body
[1:28:18] he's able to have preeminence in you
[1:28:22] ain't that right
[1:28:23] so brother Brown said all the powers
[1:28:25] that God had rested in Christ and the
[1:28:27] fullness of Christ everybody say the
[1:28:28] fullness of Christ rest in his church
[1:28:32] so now we understand where the old what
[1:28:35] he is as Omega he's Omega in his church
[1:28:41] deities not in heaven
[1:28:43] it's in you
[1:28:45] brother Brown said the last thing that
[1:28:47] the church is going to see is Christ's
[1:28:49] manifested in his power in fullness in
[1:28:52] his church
[1:28:54] do you believe that maybe this is
[1:28:56] Elementary to you or maybe you don't
[1:28:58] believe it but I believe it
[1:29:01] listen now the last thing that the
[1:29:03] church is going to see the last thing is
[1:29:06] Christ manifested in his power in
[1:29:09] fullness in his church I mean he's part
[1:29:12] of his church
[1:29:14] then that's the last thing you're going
[1:29:16] to see
[1:29:18] Christ in you
[1:29:20] not a helpless Christ not a Christ that
[1:29:23] has changed but what he was back then
[1:29:25] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:29:27] forever in you
[1:29:32] well
[1:29:34] and then have you ever read in the
[1:29:36] scriptures where Jesus was defeated
[1:29:41] answer
[1:29:43] was Jesus defeated in his his life when
[1:29:45] he walked the Earth
[1:29:47] did did he act defeated
[1:29:50] did he live defeated
[1:29:52] every time he met the devil did he
[1:29:54] overcome the devil
[1:29:57] can you say man did he did he exercise
[1:30:00] as the Messiah
[1:30:02] is that not what the prophet said we are
[1:30:04] as Messiah it's
[1:30:06] showing that the alpha has become Omega
[1:30:09] in US
[1:30:11] hello then would we not hold the same
[1:30:14] title
[1:30:16] we're not the Savior but the savior is
[1:30:18] in US
[1:30:23] then notice the power of your prayer
[1:30:30] if there's ever a people that the devil
[1:30:32] cannot whip it's this bride
[1:30:35] you know the prophet says that that that
[1:30:37] that that just paraphrase him but
[1:30:40] you know he hadn't met a lot of guys
[1:30:42] met the prophets he meant and all kinds
[1:30:44] of guys but when he met Jesus
[1:30:47] he met him on a different level
[1:30:50] when he met Jesus he got us he got his
[1:30:53] feather singed
[1:30:54] yeah he he got a hold of a wire of uh
[1:30:58] ten thousand votes
[1:31:00] and you say man
[1:31:01] why he was Alpha God made flesh
[1:31:05] the word made flesh do you realize that
[1:31:09] the devil's had his way through all
[1:31:10] these Church ages
[1:31:12] but it's in this age that this church
[1:31:14] will not denominate
[1:31:16] this age that the church will not be
[1:31:18] divided it's in this age that everything
[1:31:21] that he has taken and will be restored
[1:31:23] and he cannot take it away
[1:31:25] he took it away from all the the church
[1:31:28] through all the ages that God restored
[1:31:30] it back to us and the devil cannot take
[1:31:33] it from us every time he meets us he
[1:31:35] gets his feather singed why he's it's
[1:31:38] the same Alpha it's the same God that he
[1:31:42] met in in the mountain of trans of
[1:31:45] Temptation is the same God that he's
[1:31:47] meeting you in this age here
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:51] I hope I'm making sense to you brother
[1:31:54] Brown said see we're not a divided
[1:31:56] people we got to be in unity because of
[1:31:57] each one of us holding a part of God we
[1:32:00] must come together then the pillar of
[1:32:02] fire is manifested in the wholeness in
[1:32:04] the fullness of it when his church sets
[1:32:07] together in Heavenly places then the
[1:32:10] fullness everybody say the fullness of
[1:32:12] the power of God is in his church
[1:32:17] man come on
[1:32:21] another place he says any believer
[1:32:23] that's got the Holy Spirit you have the
[1:32:26] power of God within you
[1:32:28] don't underestimate the Holy Ghost
[1:32:34] don't don't underestimate it
[1:32:39] however you got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:41] you may have got it set in a Pew you
[1:32:43] know you can do that you can get the
[1:32:45] Holy Ghost sitting in a pew
[1:32:47] you don't have to come to an altar
[1:32:52] you you can get the Holy Ghost out in
[1:32:54] the woods
[1:32:55] you can get the holy ghosts in the car
[1:32:58] though however you get the Holy Ghost
[1:32:59] there's got to be a power with it
[1:33:03] there's a power with it
[1:33:05] and you say Amen
[1:33:10] and what that power is is a full
[1:33:12] Authority
[1:33:13] given to you
[1:33:16] remember how it changed Peter
[1:33:19] he's a coward look what he was
[1:33:22] but when he got the Holy Ghost he was
[1:33:23] changed
[1:33:26] I I hope I'm helping any believer that's
[1:33:30] got the Holy Spirit you have the power
[1:33:32] of God within you or the authority to
[1:33:34] pray the prayer of faith
[1:33:37] now your prayers just ain't bouncing
[1:33:40] against the wall
[1:33:42] you've got the authority the power to
[1:33:45] pray the prayer of faith
[1:33:47] and you say man
[1:33:50] now we've said it before but I'm going
[1:33:52] to go back over it just for a moment
[1:33:53] then I'll let you go
[1:33:55] the prayer is a must
[1:33:57] you believe it prayer is not an option
[1:34:01] not to us not as Believers prayer is a
[1:34:04] must
[1:34:06] because see God cannot do anything
[1:34:09] until you ask
[1:34:13] you got to ask
[1:34:16] Matthew 9 37 Jesus said to his disciples
[1:34:19] that Harvest truly is plenteous but the
[1:34:21] laborers are few
[1:34:22] pray
[1:34:24] ye therefore the lord of the Harvest
[1:34:26] that he will send forth labors into his
[1:34:28] Harvest
[1:34:29] Brown said he was the lord of the
[1:34:31] Harvest so he was saying to them pray to
[1:34:33] me pray to me that I will send laborers
[1:34:36] into my Harvest which I'm just telling
[1:34:37] you is such an easy thing part of it
[1:34:39] lays see in human beings the kingdom of
[1:34:43] God lays within the human being
[1:34:45] so Jesus is telling them you ask me what
[1:34:48] I know needs to be done I know it needs
[1:34:50] to be done if I can't do it until you
[1:34:52] ask
[1:34:53] and when you ask then I can act upon
[1:34:56] your prayer
[1:34:59] and you say man
[1:35:00] if you want to know what the will of God
[1:35:01] is for your life pray
[1:35:04] if you need God to do something for you
[1:35:06] pray
[1:35:08] you need the blessings of God pray him
[1:35:10] down
[1:35:11] ain't that right James 5 14 any sick
[1:35:15] among you let him call for the Elders of
[1:35:17] the church let them pray over him
[1:35:21] anointing him with oil in the name of
[1:35:23] the Lord and the prayer of faith shall
[1:35:26] save the sick
[1:35:27] and the Lord shall raise him up and if
[1:35:30] he had committed sins they shall be
[1:35:32] forgiven him
[1:35:35] power and prayer
[1:35:38] confess your faults one to another and
[1:35:41] pray for one for another that you may be
[1:35:43] healed the effectual fervent prayer of
[1:35:47] the righteous man Avail as much
[1:35:50] now the prophet said that that phrase
[1:35:52] effectual fervent it means desperation
[1:35:56] so sometimes now
[1:35:59] our prayers got to come from desperation
[1:36:11] I hope it's helping but I you go back
[1:36:14] and listen to read what brother Brown
[1:36:16] talks about
[1:36:18] he said the reason why people can't pray
[1:36:20] over five minutes because they're
[1:36:21] backslid
[1:36:23] they're they're too worldly
[1:36:26] they're too materialistic
[1:36:28] they got their minds on everything else
[1:36:30] and they can't enter into prayer
[1:36:35] so he says we just say this little
[1:36:36] prayer Lord just bless me keep me Keep
[1:36:38] John and I'm going to bed
[1:36:41] sometimes your prayers got to be from a
[1:36:43] desperation
[1:36:45] sometimes you got to pray until you get
[1:36:47] through
[1:36:51] right
[1:36:55] so brother Brown said see stay with it
[1:36:57] until it's answered Elijah
[1:37:00] James as he's talking about this fervent
[1:37:02] effectual prayer
[1:37:05] he goes right under that to Elijah how
[1:37:08] Elijah was a man of like passion just as
[1:37:11] we are brother Brown said in other words
[1:37:13] he had his ups and downs and his
[1:37:15] difference just like us but he was a
[1:37:17] righteous man who prayed
[1:37:19] ain't that right
[1:37:21] brogram says this no man is righteous
[1:37:24] only the Son of God so we don't stand I
[1:37:26] don't stand in my righteousness I stand
[1:37:28] in his righteousness so as long as I'm
[1:37:31] Anointed with him it's the effectual
[1:37:34] fervent prayer of the righteous Christ
[1:37:37] interceding for you through me to have
[1:37:40] you believe
[1:37:42] or what a prayer what a statement
[1:37:46] now our prayers changing isn't it it's
[1:37:50] Christ illness the one that's doing the
[1:37:52] praying
[1:37:53] it's Christ in us that is doing the
[1:37:56] interceding
[1:38:02] so is that not what prayer is
[1:38:05] an intercession
[1:38:07] we make intercession with our prayer
[1:38:10] and you say Amen making intercession for
[1:38:13] others
[1:38:14] now the Bible says that Elijah prayed
[1:38:17] earnestly that it might not rain
[1:38:20] so then the prophets to whom that the
[1:38:23] word of the Lord came to
[1:38:25] they had to pray because that's the law
[1:38:28] of God James 4 2 says you have not
[1:38:31] because you ask not or you pray not
[1:38:34] that right and brother Branham says you
[1:38:37] don't ask or pray because you don't
[1:38:39] believe
[1:38:40] but even the men to whom the word of the
[1:38:43] Lord came to had to find time to pray
[1:38:50] that's true
[1:38:52] now notice he prayed and it rained not
[1:38:56] on the Earth by the space of three years
[1:38:59] in six months
[1:39:01] James 5 18 says and he prayed again and
[1:39:05] the heaven gave rain and the Earth
[1:39:07] brought forth her fruit
[1:39:10] but now notice
[1:39:12] that's all we read about
[1:39:14] in that that scripture but if you go
[1:39:19] in First Kings 18 and 41.
[1:39:22] Elijah when he prayed he didn't just
[1:39:24] pray one time
[1:39:26] and get up
[1:39:28] and say well okay I prayed now it's up
[1:39:30] to God
[1:39:32] no he prayed
[1:39:34] and he prayed
[1:39:36] and he prayed
[1:39:39] can you say man
[1:39:40] First Kings 18 41 and Elijah said unto
[1:39:43] Ahab get thee up now notice the word has
[1:39:45] already came to him and and he tells
[1:39:48] Ahab get the up eat and drink for there
[1:39:51] is a sound of abundance of rain so
[1:39:54] Elijah must have had a vision of rain
[1:39:57] coming
[1:39:58] or he wouldn't have said that to Ahab
[1:40:01] so Ahab went up to Eaton to drink and
[1:40:04] Elijah went to the top of Carmel and he
[1:40:09] cast himself down upon the Earth and put
[1:40:11] his face between his knees
[1:40:13] you know what he was doing he was
[1:40:16] praying for rain
[1:40:21] and you say Amen
[1:40:23] and he said to his servant go up now
[1:40:25] look toward the sea and he went look he
[1:40:28] went up and looked and said there's
[1:40:30] nothing and and Elijah told him go again
[1:40:32] seven times
[1:40:35] so he would pray
[1:40:37] and time go go look come back there
[1:40:40] ain't nothing Elijah get on his knees
[1:40:42] and start praying again go look look up
[1:40:45] there come back there ain't nothing he'd
[1:40:47] get on his knees and start praying again
[1:40:51] can you say Amen
[1:40:53] and it came to pass at the seventh time
[1:40:56] he said behold there arise with a little
[1:40:58] cloud of the sea out of the sea like a
[1:41:00] man's hand and he said go up and say
[1:41:02] unto Ahab prepare thy chair and get thee
[1:41:04] down that the rain stopped thee not
[1:41:06] and it came to pass in the meanwhile
[1:41:08] that the heaven was black with clouds
[1:41:10] and wind and there was a great rain
[1:41:13] and you say Amen
[1:41:16] what about Elijah when he prayed for the
[1:41:18] shunamite woman's son that was dead
[1:41:21] the Bible says there in Second Kings 4
[1:41:23] 32 and when Elisha was come into the
[1:41:25] house behold the child was deadly up on
[1:41:28] his bed and Elisha went in therefore and
[1:41:30] shut the door upon them Twain and prayed
[1:41:33] unto the Lord now that's all we hear
[1:41:35] about but brother Bradham said he prayed
[1:41:37] and he prayed and he prayed
[1:41:43] and you say man
[1:41:45] and he went up and laid up on the child
[1:41:47] and put his mouth upon his mouth his
[1:41:50] eyes upon his eyes his hands upon his
[1:41:52] hands and he stretched himself upon the
[1:41:53] child and the Flesh of the child wax
[1:41:56] warm
[1:41:57] Hallelujah
[1:41:59] you see so we we find as I get ready to
[1:42:02] go
[1:42:05] it takes not just prayer it takes
[1:42:08] persistence
[1:42:09] in prayer
[1:42:12] can you say man
[1:42:14] Jesus even taught us to be persistent
[1:42:16] with our prayer Luke 18 1. and he's
[1:42:19] spake unto a parable unto them to this
[1:42:22] end that men ought always to pray and to
[1:42:24] faint not
[1:42:26] saying there was a city in a uh in a
[1:42:28] city a judge which feared not God
[1:42:30] neither regarded man and there was a
[1:42:32] widow in that City and she came unto him
[1:42:34] saying avenge me of mine adversary
[1:42:36] and he would not for a while but after
[1:42:38] he said within himself though I fear not
[1:42:40] God nor regarding man yet because this
[1:42:42] Widow troubleth me I will avenge her
[1:42:44] lest by her continual coming she weareth
[1:42:47] me
[1:42:48] and the Lord said here what the unjust
[1:42:50] judge saith and shall not God avenge his
[1:42:54] own uh elect which cried day and night
[1:42:56] unto him though he bear along with them
[1:43:00] can you say man if the musicians will
[1:43:03] come
[1:43:07] brother Brian says the first thing you
[1:43:09] have to do if you're going to find
[1:43:10] Christ you've got to know that you've
[1:43:12] got a need of him
[1:43:14] and when you think you just don't need
[1:43:15] him then you'll never find him because
[1:43:17] you won't search him diligently
[1:43:21] did you notice the scripture where it
[1:43:22] says seek and you shall find knock and
[1:43:24] it shall be opened actually that's not
[1:43:27] just knock
[1:43:29] see
[1:43:30] he knocks once he says and it opens
[1:43:34] he that's not just say see well I went
[1:43:37] out Lord here I am you want me no that's
[1:43:40] not it he that seeketh he that knocketh
[1:43:43] continuation brother Brown just keeps
[1:43:45] knocking
[1:43:46] see on that Pulpit keeps knocking see it
[1:43:49] it has to compare with the rest of the
[1:43:51] scriptures like the unjust judge and the
[1:43:53] widow she knocked constantly knocked on
[1:43:55] his door she was persistent if he turned
[1:43:58] her away today tomorrow she was on his
[1:44:00] hands again that's the way you want to
[1:44:01] get to get God be on his hands every
[1:44:05] morning every night every day all the
[1:44:07] time constantly just keep seeking keep
[1:44:10] asking keep knocking just don't knock a
[1:44:13] little while and get tired and go away
[1:44:14] just keep standing there Lord I'm here
[1:44:17] and I'm not going to turn I'm not going
[1:44:19] to leave I'm on your hands now I'm going
[1:44:22] to stay right here you getting tired of
[1:44:24] listening I I see he says I'm I'm having
[1:44:27] a great time knocking because I know
[1:44:29] you're coming amen that's when something
[1:44:32] happens he has to get you off of his
[1:44:34] hands so he comes out to answer you

[1:49:49] Christians being believers
[1:49:52] Satan
[1:49:54] a fight is intense many times
[1:49:59] Satan likes would love to
[1:50:02] bring our hands down to this to
[1:50:04] discourage us to cause us to hang our
[1:50:07] head low
[1:50:09] thinking
[1:50:10] that we're just trapped thinking that
[1:50:13] it's just impossible situations but it's
[1:50:17] not impossible
[1:50:19] not with believers
[1:50:21] because we've got the greatest weapon
[1:50:27] no matter how long it takes no matter
[1:50:29] what what what happens
[1:50:32] we got to keep knocking
[1:50:35] and no matter how bad the situation
[1:50:36] looks and how rough it is
[1:50:39] there's still a God that can answer the
[1:50:41] need
[1:50:42] you're still a God that can change the
[1:50:44] situation around and so much that
[1:50:46] brother random sits is to Lisa that no
[1:50:49] matter how Wayward that loved one is
[1:50:50] that lost son or daughter no matter how

[1:50:55] them on a death bed they'll be saved
[1:50:56] anyhow
