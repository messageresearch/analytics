[23:04] Lord father we count it a great
[23:07] privilege to be in the house of God and

[23:16] want to take advantage of every moment
[23:19] that we can we thank you Lord that you
[23:21] called us out of the denominational baby
[23:23] and into this glorious truth and many
[23:26] people don't understand why that they
[23:27] would in a prophet in this last day but
[23:30] when you realize that what he told us
[23:31] beginning the middle of the book and at
[23:33] the end of the book if you add one word
[23:34] or take one word away and with so many
[23:37] interpretations from the Catholic Church
[23:39] all the way down through every
[23:41] denominational system Lord but you had
[23:43] to send some word to straighten all this
[23:46] out and give us an understanding the
[23:47] revelation of the word that what you
[23:49] required Lord for a little bride to be
[23:51] taken up in a Rapture but we're thankful
[23:53] Lord you sent us a messeng and a message
[23:55] that we might know how to live and how
[23:57] to obey the word of God and how to act
[23:59] in church and all the wonderful things
[24:00] you've given to us Lord we just bless
[24:03] your name we pray for brother Bob Lord
[24:04] you see I know he's up in age but age is
[24:07] nothing to you you said by your stripes
[24:10] he's already healed so we can believe it
[24:12] Lord we just uh claim it we speak it to
[24:14] be done heal his body take away Lord the
[24:18] congestion the fluid Lord the U
[24:21] pneumonia that he had in his lungs and
[24:23] we say had in his lungs and we thank him
[24:24] because we believe he's healed Lord in
[24:27] each one I'm sure un un people raise
[24:30] their hands a request on their heart

[49:44] Exodus
[49:54] 14 amen it's going to be little
[49:59] scripture reading is going to be just a
[50:00] little lengthy so just bear with me here
[50:04] but Exodus
[50:08] 14 verse 10 we're all familiar but uh
[50:12] and verse 10 says and when Pharaoh Drew
[50:15] nigh the children of Israel lifted up
[50:17] their eyes and behold these the
[50:19] Egyptians marched after them and they
[50:22] were sore afraid and the children of
[50:24] Israel cried the Lord and they said unto
[50:27] Moses because there were no graves in
[50:29] Egypt hast thou taken us
[50:31] away um to die in the wilderness
[50:35] wherefore hast thou dealt with us to
[50:38] carry us forth out of Egypt is not is is
[50:42] not this the word that we did tell thee
[50:44] in Egypt saying let us alone that we may
[50:47] serve the Egyptians for it had been
[50:49] better for us to serve the
[50:51] Egyptians than that we would die in the
[50:54] OR than that we would die should die in
[50:56] the
[50:57] wilderness and Moses said unto the
[50:59] people fear not and stand still and see
[51:01] the salvation of the Lord which you he
[51:03] will show you to uh you today for the
[51:07] Egyptians who you have seen today ye
[51:11] shall see them again no more forever and
[51:13] the Lord shall fight for you and you
[51:15] shall hold your peace and the Lord said
[51:18] unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me
[51:22] speak unto the children of Israel that
[51:25] they go
[51:26] for but lift up thy rod and stretch out
[51:29] thy hand over the sea and divide it and
[51:32] the children of Israel shall go on dry
[51:34] ground through the midst of the sea and
[51:37] I behold I will harden the hearts of the
[51:39] Egyptians and they shall follow them and
[51:42] I will get to me honor upon pharaoh and
[51:44] upon all his host upon his chariots and
[51:47] upon his Horsemen and the Egyptians
[51:50] shall know that I am the Lord when I
[51:53] have gotten me honor when upon on
[51:55] Pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his
[51:57] Horsemen and the angel of God which went
[51:59] before the camp of Israel removed and
[52:01] went behind them and the pillar of the
[52:04] cloud went uh from before their face and
[52:07] stood behind them and it came between
[52:10] the camp of the Egyptians in the camp of
[52:12] Israel and it was a cloud U and it was a
[52:16] cloud and darkness to them but it gave
[52:18] light by night to to these so that that
[52:22] one came not near the uh all the the
[52:26] night uh near the other all the night
[52:28] and Moses stretched out his hand over
[52:30] the sea and the Lord caused the sea to
[52:32] go back by a strong uh East Wind all the
[52:36] night and made the sea uh dry land and
[52:39] Waters were divided and the children of
[52:42] Israel went into the midst of the sea
[52:44] upon the dry ground and the waters were
[52:46] a wall unto them on the right hand and
[52:49] on their left and the Egyptians pursued
[52:51] and went in after them to the midst of
[52:54] the sea even all Pharaoh's horses his
[52:57] chariots and his Horsemen and it came to
[53:00] pass that in the morning watch the Lord
[53:02] looked unto the host of the Egyptians
[53:05] through the pillar of fire and of the
[53:07] cloud and troubled the host of the
[53:09] Egyptians and took off their chariot
[53:12] wheels that they uh that they drave them
[53:16] heavily so that the Egyptians said let
[53:19] us flee from the face of Israel for the
[53:22] Lord fighteth for them against the
[53:24] Egyptians
[53:25] amen if we could just bow our heads
[53:27] tonight dear heavenly father Lord we
[53:30] love you and we thank you Lord for all
[53:33] that you've done for us Lord and Lord we
[53:35] thank you for another day to serve you
[53:37] in Lord and another day Lord to to give
[53:40] you the glory and the honor and Lord I
[53:43] pray that you would just move myself out
[53:45] of the way tonight Lord I pray that you
[53:47] would just speak through me father and I
[53:49] pray that your anointing would just fall
[53:51] aresh on us tonight anoint your
[53:53] congregation Lord is our prayer prayer
[53:56] Lord we love you and we thank you and
[53:57] have your way in Jesus Christ's name we
[54:00] pray amen you can be
[54:03] seated if I um had a thought tonight I
[54:07] would like to maybe um continue the
[54:10] thought on um you are anointed for it um
[54:14] maybe this would uh I guess you could
[54:16] consider it part two of when we spoke it
[54:19] a few weeks ago I um I haven't I haven't
[54:24] been able to sleep since then just uh
[54:27] more just kept just kept coming and and
[54:30] i' just feel like U that the Lord want
[54:32] us to go this way tonight but if I would
[54:35] um maybe give a subtitle I would like to
[54:38] maybe uh why Christ speak um and uh I'd
[54:43] like to uh maybe speak on this out of
[54:46] the message brother brandham spoke why
[54:48] Christ speak in
[54:50] 63 and um you know he he tells the story
[54:53] of Moses and and um if you would just
[54:56] bear with me tonight I would like to uh
[54:59] kind of just go through uh Moses like we
[55:02] did with David so um but uh uh and uh
[55:09] our pastor spoke uh Sunday on everything
[55:12] or a lot of things that was in my notes
[55:14] already so so please don't think I was
[55:17] copycatting him but um but uh we just
[55:21] pray that the Lord would have his way
[55:23] amen now brother brandham said that
[55:25] Moses was crying out to God in a time of
[55:28] their trouble and U God rebuked Moses
[55:32] for that and um and it's nature brother
[55:35] Bram says it's nature for someone as we
[55:38] know that when in trouble they cry out
[55:40] if someone were to to break in our home
[55:43] break in our car and we were there
[55:45] present and or someone were trying to do
[55:47] harm to us we would cry out uh for help
[55:52] and um and um and when God rebuked Moses
[55:56] for crying out to him you know sometimes
[55:59] if if you know we don't know the whole
[56:01] story but when we begin to read that and
[56:03] maybe we were reading that and God
[56:05] rebuked Moses and it seemed a little
[56:07] hard God was being hard on Moses for
[56:10] rebuking him that way and um and as we
[56:13] begin to study the Bible we listen to
[56:16] what the prophet has said then we find
[56:18] out that God knows exactly what he's
[56:21] doing and um so we want to uh if please
[56:24] bear with me as I'm going to try to lay
[56:26] a foundation here tonight but uh Moses
[56:29] was born into this world for a purpose
[56:32] and he was born with a gift he was born
[56:35] with u we all are here we all have each
[56:38] one of us have gifts here tonight some
[56:41] are has the gift to sing some have the
[56:43] gift to play the music some have the
[56:46] gift to uh to maybe uh when they're
[56:49] working they have just the the gift to
[56:53] build a house like no one else can they
[56:55] can you know clean like no one else can
[56:57] but someone has a purp or everyone has a
[57:00] purpose in life and um you know so so uh
[57:05] so but uh everyone Moses was born with
[57:09] the equipment in him by predestination
[57:12] and for knowledge of God that every
[57:14] person that comes into the world is born
[57:17] with this equipment so everyone is born
[57:19] with the gift and um but God U he knows
[57:24] the end from the beginning amen and uh
[57:27] if he doesn't then he is an infinite and
[57:30] if he's not infinite then he isn't God
[57:32] and uh so by God's forn knowledge he
[57:35] knew Moses would be the tool he would
[57:37] use to deliver the people from bondage
[57:40] amen and each one of us tonight uh can
[57:43] be or will be or are a tool that God can
[57:48] use and um but uh so he isn't willing
[57:51] that any should perish but knowing who
[57:54] would perish and who would not perish
[57:57] that's how um that's how that's who our
[58:00] God is um and that's the reason the very
[58:03] purpose that Jesus came to Earth was to
[58:05] save those that God through his for
[58:07] knowledge seen that wanted to be saved
[58:10] see because the world was uh was
[58:13] condemned so God knew who would want to
[58:16] be saved and um so by his forn knowledge
[58:19] he chose each and every one of us
[58:21] tonight and saved us because he knew we
[58:24] would want that amen and uh uh and he
[58:29] saved us knowing that we would want to
[58:31] be saved because he has a purpose and a
[58:34] plan for our life amen and and you know
[58:37] some of us may say well we're too young
[58:39] or we're too old to be used with God but
[58:41] as long as we're on this Earth God has a
[58:44] purpose for us to be here amen we may
[58:47] not understand that purpose yet but God
[58:49] has a plan for each and every one and
[58:52] Moses was born with a gift of faith
[58:55] Moses had great faith brother brandham
[58:57] says he was one of the greatest
[58:59] characters of the Bible for he was
[59:00] strictly a type of the Lord Jesus he was
[59:03] born in a very odd birth like the Lord
[59:06] Jesus he was um born in the time of
[59:09] persecution like the Lord Jesus he was
[59:11] born to be a deliverer like the Lord
[59:13] Jesus he was born um uh a very odd birth
[59:18] like the Lord Jesus he was hid from his
[59:21] parents away from the enemy like the
[59:22] Lord Jesus he came to uh his time of
[59:26] service like the Lord Jesus he was a
[59:28] leader like the Lord he was a prophet
[59:31] and he was a lawgiver like the Lord and
[59:33] he was a perfect type of Christ he was a
[59:36] king over the people and he was a
[59:38] lawgiver he was a a sustainer to the
[59:40] people he was everything and type that
[59:42] Christ was brother brandham says and yet
[59:45] to be used of God he first had to be
[59:47] stripped of his own ideas and from his
[59:50] own intellectual thinking Moses was
[59:52] taught in the ways of the Egyptians he
[59:54] was he was raised in and maybe he was
[59:57] raised in their seminars he was raised
[59:59] in their their Bible colleges he was
[1:00:01] taught the way of the Egyptians amen and
[1:00:05] and he was so well learned in their ways
[1:00:07] that he could teach their Scholars he
[1:00:09] could teach Their scientist things
[1:00:12] that's how uh well-learned Moses was and
[1:00:15] he had the great gifts in him he had the
[1:00:17] gift of knowledge he he could he could
[1:00:20] understand things and uh and brother
[1:00:23] brandham said Moses knew he was the
[1:00:25] deliverer to the people he had studied
[1:00:27] the scriptures Moses knew he was called
[1:00:30] by God to be the deliverer hundreds and
[1:00:32] hundreds of years before did it speak of
[1:00:35] that day in Genesis 15 verse 13 and and
[1:00:40] he said unto Abram know of aurity that
[1:00:42] the seed shall be a stranger in a land
[1:00:45] that is not theirs and Shall Serve them
[1:00:47] and they shall afflict them 400 years
[1:00:50] and also that Nation whom they Shall
[1:00:52] Serve will I judge and afterward they
[1:00:55] shall come out with great substance so
[1:00:57] here in Genesis the Lord or was spoke of
[1:01:01] Moses coming in and and Moses reading
[1:01:03] these scriptures being taught of his
[1:01:05] mother Moses had a revelation that he
[1:01:08] was to be the deliverer now see Moses
[1:01:11] had to come to that time uh of of when
[1:01:14] God to use him and Moses know this
[1:01:17] intellectually and the seed that was
[1:01:19] born in him was laying in his heart so
[1:01:21] so it was there but it hadn't he hadn't
[1:01:24] met the burning bush yet and he tried
[1:01:27] through his intellectual experience with
[1:01:29] the word to try and bring them out to
[1:01:31] deliver them because he knowed he was
[1:01:33] born for that purpose yet he failed and
[1:01:36] he TR because he tried it his way he
[1:01:39] ended up killing a man CU he tried to do
[1:01:41] it on his own he seen a need there and
[1:01:43] he tried to go do it on his own and he
[1:01:45] failed amen that's the same with us if
[1:01:48] we try to try go listen to the message
[1:01:50] trying to do God a service without being
[1:01:52] his will and and here so there's a time
[1:01:56] and a place uh that God is calling us
[1:01:58] for amen but when God got him out of
[1:02:02] Egypt it took 40 years in the desert to
[1:02:05] get Egypt out of Moses amen and it's the
[1:02:09] same thing today God has called us go
[1:02:11] called a people out of denominational
[1:02:13] ideas he's called us out of Le
[1:02:15] oia uh out of the Le oysan ideas but we
[1:02:18] want to bring them into the message we
[1:02:20] want to try and bring a Baptist idea we
[1:02:22] want to try to bring a Pentecostal idea
[1:02:25] we want to try to bring in our worldly
[1:02:27] things from the lotsy and trying to
[1:02:28] bring them in the church
[1:02:31] but but we want to try we want to try
[1:02:34] and bring a lukewarm spirit in amen and
[1:02:37] but in order for the word to take effect
[1:02:39] in our lives in our homes and in our
[1:02:42] churches we first have to get Egypt out
[1:02:44] of us amen God has called us out of lay
[1:02:47] osia God has called us out of the the
[1:02:49] denominational ideas but we have to get
[1:02:52] that out of ourselves God has to strip
[1:02:54] us you got to you just got to be
[1:02:56] determined you got to get desperate and
[1:02:57] you say God no matter what it takes
[1:03:00] you've got to get this out of me amen
[1:03:02] he's called us out now get Le osia out
[1:03:05] of me amen so we got to get uh uh uh the
[1:03:10] we we've got to get Egypt amen he it
[1:03:12] took 40 years to get Egypt out of Moses
[1:03:15] amen we have to be stripped of our own
[1:03:17] ways we have to be stripped of our own
[1:03:19] thinkings and our own ideas just like
[1:03:22] Moses and all of us here before for the
[1:03:24] foundation of the world he had a little
[1:03:26] seed planted in our hearts in his in his
[1:03:29] heart and each every one of us tonight
[1:03:31] we all had a seed planted in our hearts
[1:03:35] amen and when we depend on our own
[1:03:37] selves and when we depend on our own
[1:03:39] intellectual thinking the Sun the S so n
[1:03:42] can't shine its light to make the seed
[1:03:44] come forth amen and when he began to
[1:03:48] empty when he began when we began to
[1:03:51] empty ourselves of of what we can do
[1:03:54] empty ourselves of of our own self-will
[1:03:57] and our ideas and we can watch that word
[1:04:00] when that light comes and quickens that
[1:04:02] seed we can come and watch it manifest
[1:04:05] we can watch that seed come to life Amen
[1:04:09] brother brandham says Moses was born and
[1:04:12] he was afterwards he was brought to the
[1:04:14] place where he was anointed and notice
[1:04:17] the seed laying there with an
[1:04:18] intellectual conception with all the
[1:04:21] faith that he was born to deliver this
[1:04:23] people and yet it never come to life
[1:04:25] until that light from the burning bush
[1:04:27] flashed across it until he seen not
[1:04:30] something he read about but it was
[1:04:31] something he seen with his own eyes
[1:04:34] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[1:04:36] back to it oh how does that bring life
[1:04:39] amen that brings things to life and when
[1:04:41] and when we uh uh then he got this
[1:04:43] anointing that that anointing what he
[1:04:45] had in him he was commissioned when he
[1:04:48] got that anointing God commissioned him
[1:04:51] he was ready to go to Egypt amen he
[1:04:54] didn't have to do it on his own no more
[1:04:56] but when he come face to face with that
[1:04:58] burning bush he knew God was with him
[1:05:02] heyen Amen brother Brandon says he knew
[1:05:06] what was going to take place he knew he
[1:05:08] was living in that day but he found out
[1:05:11] that he was a failure so his uh uh but
[1:05:14] his faith may have dropped back a little
[1:05:17] bit and then when he comes to the bush
[1:05:20] God said I have heard the cries of my
[1:05:22] people and I remember my promise to
[1:05:24] their fathers Abraham and Isaac and
[1:05:26] Jacob and I have come down I they are
[1:05:29] the personal pronoun I have come down to
[1:05:31] deliver them and I have chosen you and
[1:05:34] I'm sending you down to take them out
[1:05:36] and I'll be your mouth and I and you
[1:05:39] take this rod and Moses said can I see
[1:05:41] the evidence that you've s that you'll
[1:05:43] send me and and you've anointed me and
[1:05:46] you're going to do these things and and
[1:05:48] God says what do you got in your hand he
[1:05:50] said a stick he said throw it down and
[1:05:52] it turned into a serpent Moses fled and
[1:05:55] come back and he said take it up and it
[1:05:57] turned back to the stick and said put
[1:05:59] your hands in your bosom took it out and
[1:06:01] it was leprosy he put it back in and it
[1:06:03] was healed said he saw the glory of God
[1:06:07] there was no more question to Moses did
[1:06:09] you ever notice he never run to the
[1:06:11] Wilderness again he he knew he was
[1:06:14] anointed he knew where all these things
[1:06:16] that had been in his heart these great
[1:06:18] qualities and they were anointed now now
[1:06:21] he was anointed he had something within
[1:06:24] him that that his great qualities you
[1:06:26] know you can play the piano you can sing
[1:06:29] but when you want to do God of service
[1:06:31] you got to wait till that anointing
[1:06:32] falls upon you amen that's right it's
[1:06:37] okay to play the piano it's okay to play
[1:06:39] really nice anyone can let me say this

[1:06:44] piano and play but when you want to do

[1:06:48] anointing you got to wait for God to
[1:06:50] anoint
[1:06:51] you amen true
[1:06:56] amen he said he said he is ready he is
[1:06:59] ready to go so down to Egypt he goes God
[1:07:02] has said I'll be with you so that
[1:07:04] settles it I'll be with you that's all
[1:07:07] Moses had to know and it's the same
[1:07:10] thing with us today sometimes we feel
[1:07:12] like a failure sometimes we wonder how
[1:07:15] God can use me and and you know I've
[1:07:17] done this or or I've done that and I'm
[1:07:20] not smart enough for this and and I'm
[1:07:22] not strong enough but if you would just
[1:07:24] remember that time that you came face to
[1:07:27] face with that burning bush and it spoke
[1:07:29] to you and you spoke back to him amen
[1:07:32] God says I've known you before the
[1:07:33] foundation of the world I've called you
[1:07:36] I've chosen you and I've anointed you
[1:07:38] for this purpose go take my word and

[1:07:58] angel of the Lord accompanies this
[1:07:59] message always amen we can stand up here
[1:08:02] with confidence knowing that the angel
[1:08:04] of the Lord is behind us speaking
[1:08:07] through US amen I'll be your mouthpiece
[1:08:11] as I was with Moses so so shall I be
[1:08:14] with you be not afraid it is I amen now
[1:08:19] they brother brand says now they said
[1:08:21] here is a man another Jew probably some
[1:08:23] of these Fanatics they've been coming
[1:08:25] along all the time with all the kind of
[1:08:27] schemes to take out the bondage you know
[1:08:30] it's different one saying well I'm the
[1:08:31] one I'm the one I'm the deliverer and uh
[1:08:34] and you know how people are when they're
[1:08:36] enslaves or in their bondage for
[1:08:38] something there is always some kind of a
[1:08:40] gimmick going around to do it God
[1:08:43] promised Moses I'll be with you I'll be
[1:08:46] with you I'll be in you my words will be
[1:08:49] your words speak my words and do exactly
[1:08:52] what I say amen Moses could now go down
[1:08:55] to Egypt with confidence Moses could go
[1:08:58] now go down knowing that the Lord was
[1:08:59] behind him they may say well Moses you
[1:09:02] tried it before and you failed but Moses
[1:09:04] says well now I'm anointed to do so now
[1:09:08] you've tried it once before Moses but he
[1:09:10] said I did that on my own but I have
[1:09:12] come face to face with that burning bush
[1:09:14] I know that I I've been commissioned to
[1:09:17] do this amen it's been Vindicated by God
[1:09:22] Amen Moses could then say but I am the I
[1:09:27] am has sent me I met face to face with
[1:09:30] God and now I know I'm anointed amen you
[1:09:33] see the difference there's a difference
[1:09:35] when you try to do it on your own
[1:09:37] there's a difference between you trying
[1:09:38] to do it and God doing it amen amen
[1:09:42] there's a difference between that
[1:09:44] calling or or uh uh uh you trying to
[1:09:47] trying to do your calling versus God
[1:09:49] anointing you amen now when Moses went
[1:09:53] down and give them this call and stood
[1:09:56] before pharaoh and told him the Lord God
[1:09:59] of the Hebrews said bring the children
[1:10:02] out and he wouldn't let them go so he
[1:10:04] performed a sign before the elders and
[1:10:06] before Pharaoh now I want you to catch
[1:10:08] this now now please listen here and the
[1:10:10] signs that God did so a sign before the
[1:10:13] elders and before pharaoh and the signs
[1:10:15] that God did he said now tomorrow about
[1:10:18] this time the Sun will go down it'll be
[1:10:20] Darkness all over Egypt and it come to
[1:10:23] pass just exactly what he said and then
[1:10:26] he said there's coming flies upon the
[1:10:27] land and he stretched forth his rod and
[1:10:30] called for flies and flies came and he
[1:10:32] prophesied and everything that he
[1:10:34] prophesied happened just exactly the way
[1:10:38] it was God see it was God speaking
[1:10:41] through Moses Moses could stand there
[1:10:44] and God God says God says I've anointed
[1:10:47] you Moses to do this so Moses could
[1:10:49] stand there and say Let There Be flies
[1:10:51] and flies will come let there be frogs
[1:10:53] and frog dogs of come let there be this
[1:10:55] let there be that let there be this and
[1:10:57] it had to happen just like Moses said
[1:11:00] because it was God speaking through
[1:11:03] Moses oh I hope you catch that now God
[1:11:06] had called them from his birth and put
[1:11:08] qualities in him of great faith and then
[1:11:11] come down with his presence and anointed
[1:11:13] that great something in him and sent him
[1:11:15] down with his word and he was properly
[1:11:18] Vindicated of his claims amen amen no
[1:11:22] matter how many Quacks and raised uh no
[1:11:24] matter how many quacks had raised up how
[1:11:26] many of these other things happened God
[1:11:28] was speaking Moses was identified with
[1:11:31] what with what Moses said God was I was
[1:11:35] identified with what Moses says God
[1:11:37] honored I want you to never forget that
[1:11:40] what Moses said God whatever Moses says
[1:11:43] God honors because God's word was in
[1:11:46] Moses I'll be your mouth it'll be the
[1:11:50] right things now when God says he speaks
[1:11:52] it through Moses and it confirmed and
[1:11:54] they Vindicated CLA his claims so no
[1:11:57] matter what Moses said God had God
[1:12:01] honored that amen cuz it wasn't Moses
[1:12:03] speaking it was God speaking amen Moses
[1:12:07] knowing that he was born for that
[1:12:09] purpose and looked out of the windows
[1:12:12] and and watched them Hebrews as they
[1:12:14] toiled look back here in the scriptures
[1:12:16] and it says and they shall soldier in
[1:12:18] 400 years see I will bring them out with
[1:12:21] a mighty hand then he comes back after a
[1:12:24] commission anointed by faith he saw
[1:12:27] those people and knowed they were the
[1:12:29] children of God yes he was to be the son
[1:12:32] of pharaoh taking the kingdom over he
[1:12:34] was next there was something there was
[1:12:36] something down in him a real faith likee
[1:12:38] and looked and look not at those things
[1:12:41] he didn't look to the glamour he was uh
[1:12:43] he was to inherit he didn't look to
[1:12:45] those fine places he could live in he
[1:12:48] didn't look at his Fine Cars he didn't
[1:12:50] look at those
[1:12:51] fine camels those fine chariots that he
[1:12:55] was to inherit Moses was to inherit
[1:12:57] everything that Pharaoh had Moses was
[1:13:00] next in line so Moses coming to this
[1:13:02] world you know he had everything handed
[1:13:04] to him he was he was scholar he was
[1:13:06] learned and knowing that he could look
[1:13:09] over the Kingdom of Egypt and know that
[1:13:11] one day this will be mine one day this
[1:13:13] this all could be mine all the Pharaohs
[1:13:16] all or all the the the Chariots all the
[1:13:18] man the Army behind me I mean this this
[1:13:22] right here could be mine
[1:13:23] you know some of us wish that sometimes
[1:13:25] you know you know a lot of times you
[1:13:27] know we we get down and discouraged we
[1:13:29] wish we had this we wish we had that you
[1:13:31] know but I want you to catch this here
[1:13:34] and but see brother BR says he didn't
[1:13:36] look at the glamour he was to inherit
[1:13:38] amen he looked at the promises of God
[1:13:41] brother Brown says he could have started
[1:13:44] a mutiny he could have rose up and
[1:13:46] started a revolutionary in Egypt and
[1:13:49] could a revolution in Egypt and could
[1:13:51] have took an army and fought he had many
[1:13:54] thousands on his side but instead of
[1:13:56] that he uh brother Bron said he was even
[1:13:58] scared to do that with armies on his
[1:14:00] side but now here he comes back 40 years
[1:14:03] later 80 years old with only a stick in
[1:14:06] his hand why why uh what was uh burning
[1:14:09] down in his heart had now become a
[1:14:11] reality he was anointed then and he know
[1:14:15] that he had thus sayith the Lord there
[1:14:18] was nothing that was going to stop him
[1:14:20] now he needed no Army God was with him
[1:14:23] that's all he needed God was with him
[1:14:26] God was with Moses sir he could have
[1:14:28] taken a whole Army he could have had the
[1:14:32] everything behind him he could have
[1:14:34] fought he could have possibly prevailed
[1:14:36] I mean uh well God has a plan and a
[1:14:39] purpose but what I'm saying is Moses had
[1:14:42] had the qualities Moses had it within
[1:14:44] him to to to to uh uh he was knowledge
[1:14:48] he could have strategized his army a
[1:14:49] certain way or or or something he could
[1:14:51] have fought back but he was scared to do
[1:14:54] that but when he come face to face with
[1:14:57] that burning bush he come back to Egypt
[1:14:59] older than he was before and with only a
[1:15:02] stick in his hand and with God's word
[1:15:04] backing him up that's right that's right
[1:15:07] oh my he had thus sayth the
[1:15:11] Lord his faith led him to take the
[1:15:13] choice of his of the word and not the
[1:15:17] glammer he took the word that's what
[1:15:19] Moses's Faith did and when Faith looks
[1:15:22] on God's word first remember there was
[1:15:24] that glamour now the world the highest
[1:15:27] king of the world and where and where
[1:15:29] was God's promise it was in the mud hole
[1:15:32] a mud Dober that's where God's promise
[1:15:34] was Moses had a choice he could either
[1:15:37] take the glamour of Egypt or or of what
[1:15:40] Egypt had to offer or he could take
[1:15:41] God's God's promise a mud Dober needing
[1:15:44] a Deliverance yeah a
[1:15:47] choice When Faith looks on God's wor it
[1:15:50] esteems Greater and more valuable than
[1:15:53] the best thing the world can show yes

[1:15:59] now now we want to look at the glamour
[1:16:01] we want to see how nice the world has to
[1:16:04] offer and that's what Moses had Moses
[1:16:06] had that choice he had he could have he
[1:16:08] could have stayed in Egypt he could have
[1:16:10] lived comfortably he could have just
[1:16:11] snapped his finger and they brought him
[1:16:13] food they brought him a drink anything
[1:16:15] he had need of that's what Moses had but
[1:16:17] that wasn't God's will for Moses Moses
[1:16:20] had a choice yeah he seen ah he looked
[1:16:24] to God's word yes and us tonight we have
[1:16:27] to look to the promise of God Amen God

[1:17:06] word can see the word made manifest it's
[1:17:08] more than all the Glamour and everything
[1:17:09] else you can speak of Faith does it see
[1:17:12] you can see the worst the despised the
[1:17:14] rejected the whatever it may be Let It

[1:20:03] wonders and God said I am with you your
[1:20:06] words are my words I've proved it to you
[1:20:09] Moses when we were there when when there
[1:20:12] was no flies in that land and it was out
[1:20:13] of season and you said let there come
[1:20:16] flies so so now they've they've come

[1:20:20] Egypt now and they've come to the the
[1:20:23] Red Sea and here uh God has called them
[1:20:26] out and and now they've come to the Red
[1:20:28] Sea and Moses is hearing the people
[1:20:29] crying Moses why have you brought us out
[1:20:32] here why did you bring us out here to
[1:20:34] die so so here he's crying out to God
[1:20:36] now and he and he's saying God why what
[1:20:40] what what what happened and he said and
[1:20:42] God says I'm with you your words is my
[1:20:43] words I've proved it to you Moses that
[1:20:45] when there was no flies in the land and
[1:20:47] it was out of season you said that there
[1:20:49] come flies and there come flies that's
[1:20:51] creation who can bring Darkness over the
[1:20:53] Earth but God he said let there be
[1:20:55] darkness and there was Darkness you said
[1:20:57] let there be frogs and there the frogs
[1:21:00] even got in Pharaoh's house and the beds
[1:21:02] and when they piled them up in the great
[1:21:04] heaps the Creator and I have spoke
[1:21:06] through you Moses and my and made my
[1:21:09] word create through your lips I've made
[1:21:11] you exactly a god before Pharaoh yes sir
[1:21:14] I've done all of this and here they come
[1:21:16] to to a place a little trial come up and
[1:21:19] Moses begin to cry what shall I do God
[1:21:22] has performed everything perfectly now
[1:21:24] he started uh started them on their
[1:21:26] Journey he's got he he's got the church
[1:21:28] together they've been called out they
[1:21:30] come uh from every denomination they
[1:21:32] they all got together Moses went back
[1:21:34] there and said Lord what must I do he
[1:21:37] say well go go do this all right go
[1:21:40] ahead and now Moses now I've called you
[1:21:43] to do this yes Lord all right now you go

[1:21:47] the Flies speak for this and here it
[1:21:50] comes do this and here it come
[1:21:51] everything was thus sayith the Lord thus
[1:21:54] sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord the
[1:21:58] Lord and now he gets into
[1:22:00] trouble he had thus saith the Lord
[1:22:02] behind him and when a little trial come
[1:22:04] to him he didn't know what to do
[1:22:07] my and God says now I've gotten them
[1:22:10] started on their Journey they're all
[1:22:11] called out the church is together I've
[1:22:13] got them on their Journey now remember
[1:22:16] in our opening scripture he had already
[1:22:19] prophesied here for he said the
[1:22:20] Egyptians that you shall see uh uh see
[1:22:23] today you will see them no more so Moses
[1:22:26] stood before the people and he told them
[1:22:28] he prophesied to them the Egyptians you
[1:22:30] see today you will see them no more amen
[1:22:33] and then immediately he began to cry out
[1:22:35] to God God what can we do and and he
[1:22:39] said and he said he was already going to
[1:22:42] come to pass and there he was crying out
[1:22:44] what am I going to do he had already
[1:22:46] proved what he what you say will happen
[1:22:49] I'm with you he's already proved that to
[1:22:50] you and he knew that God had anointed
[1:22:53] him for this job to do this and God had
[1:22:56] clearly Vindicated his claims and it was
[1:22:58] time for the people to be deliver God
[1:23:00] through the Miracles and wonders had
[1:23:02] drawn them all together in one group
[1:23:04] brought them together in one group and
[1:23:05] Vindicated his uh his claims scripture
[1:23:08] said so there was a sign he was uh was
[1:23:11] the evidence here everything that he

[1:48:19] isn't
[1:48:21] it isn't a gift that's given us the
[1:48:23] authority it's the word of God that's
[1:48:24] given us the
[1:48:26] authority amen it's not emotions that's
[1:48:29] given us an authority it's the word of
[1:48:31] God we're so glad for that and our faith
[1:48:34] must be in the word and who we are we
[1:48:37] have been commissioned in this age amen
[1:48:42] and I'm so thankful for that and you
[1:48:45] know brother brandom talked of the the
[1:48:48] faith of the um the three the three
[1:48:51] faiths the people that he had that had
[1:48:55] faith and the elevation of Faith you
[1:48:58] know um talked about gas's Jas that had
[1:49:02] the faith and he he had faith in
[1:49:08] Jesus and uh but his faith was in that
[1:49:11] to lay hands if you just come and lay
[1:49:13] hands on my daughter then she'll live
[1:49:17] and uh and that was a good good faith
[1:49:19] that was an exercise of Faith but then
[1:49:22] there was a greater faith and that was
[1:49:24] that of that Centurion man he had faith
[1:49:27] in Jesus but he recognized that there
[1:49:30] was something about him that had such an
[1:49:34] authority in his word and so he said now
[1:49:37] if you would just speak the word he said
[1:49:39] you don't have to come to my house I'm
[1:49:40] not even worthy that you would come
[1:49:42] under my roof just speak the word and my
[1:49:45] servant will
[1:49:46] live what a what a faith both men have
[1:49:49] faith faith in Jesus of who he was but
[1:49:53] then the prophet in that perfect Faith
[1:49:56] he began to talk about the faith that
[1:49:58] Jesus had
[1:50:01] amen and it was a faith that Jesus had
[1:50:05] faith knowing on who he was he knew that
[1:50:09] he could speak the word he knew he knew
[1:50:13] and I think that's where we're at today
[1:50:16] it's a faith that has come to a
[1:50:17] perfected faith that that we're not
[1:50:21] looking in in someone
[1:50:24] else to do it we're not looking at
[1:50:26] someone else's thing we're we're looking
[1:50:28] at us we can speak the word the power
[1:50:32] The Authority is within every one of us
[1:50:36] can you say
[1:50:37] amen and you know we can't overcome the
[1:50:42] devil for one
