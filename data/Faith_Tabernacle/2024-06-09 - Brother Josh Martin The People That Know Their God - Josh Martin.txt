everything to you this morning has it been good to you he that started the work is going to be faithful to complete it amen what a promise happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning come under an expectation not to hear from from a man but to hear from the Lord amen I trust that's your desire amen if you have your Bibles this morning let's open our scriptures to Daniel 11:32 it's good to be here this morning count it's an honor and a a privilege to be ministering I pray something could be said to be a blessing amen uh we have been watching some of the services there in New Mexico looks like they're having a good meeting there at brother em manuels so we we thank the Lord for that amen amen Daniel 1132 the Bible would say and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits amen can we bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord what an honor Lord it is to come into your house father God as we've sang songs of worship Lord and we've created an atmosphere father we ask that you would come and inhabit the Praises of your people this morning Lord as we come into this part of the service I ask that you would anoint me Father anoint your word Lord see this thought that you've placed upon my heart God I ask that as the word would come forth Lord there be Hearts to receive it father Lord meet the needs touch the hearts Lord we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated this morning if I had a subject it would be the people that know their God and brother brandham would place this scripture in the end time and he would say and all that Daniel said about the last days and how they that know their God will do exploits and just so many scriptures tying in this day that we're living in how that these evil deceiving times would be on the earth and and just exactly what we're having now fulfills it he says they had been given their chance to see him but they rejected their very Messiah and today it's the same thing the very same thing we are given the opportunity he would say in another place Daniel said in that day they run to and fro knowledge shall increase and he said they the wise shall know their God in that day and do great exploits in that day but the wicked would not know the god of Heaven they know him in a form and in a ritual so knowing god in a form or a ritual is not the realities of God but I believe it's got to go from just what nominal church members have just more than just a form to the realities and the Bible would tell us that the mystery of God should be finished and I believe we're living in a day where the understanding of who God is has been poured out where God is no longer veiled by traditions and by Creeds and by dogmas but the realities of who God is has been opened up to us in this generation where we can see God not through a Creed but see God as who he is God didn't want to be seen as a Creed or as a tradition God wanted to be seen as a person you can't see a person in a form all you see is a shadow but once you see it in a reality you see a person that this word is Jesus Christ and you see brother Brandon would tell us that God was veiled behind Badger skins and whenever Christ was being crucified upon the cross he says the veil was ritten from top to bottom and there stood The Mercy Seat for everybody to see but but then he would say not every body could see him because of their traditions because of their form and I think many times we can be in a message church but come the church out of a form instead of a reality and we don't know God when we come out of a form but I believe we can come with the Revelation knowing where two or three are gathered in my name I will be in the midst of the people and I believe that's what we're Gathering under today not a form but a revelation that God has promised to meet us in this place this morning and you see brother the Brandon might tell us that the Gentiles have veiled him up again not by a natural Veil but by a spiritual veil by Creeds and by Traditions again but brother Brandon M tell us in the first thing they went to Methodist Baptist Presbyterians Pentecostals and so forth It's organized tradition till a man don't know where he stands but glory to God he promised in the last days what he would do he would show his word in plain view open before us see open it up so just like Christ was unveiled when he was walking on Earth it's been promised in this day that he would unveil himself again where we could see the person Jesus Christ not an idea but a person and brother Brandon would tell us that the Holy Ghost has been bound by denominational Rivers for 2,000 years but is to be loosed by an evening time message and then he would tell us the Holy Spirit Christ himself back in the church again and I believe that's what we're wanting today it's Christ in me the hope of glory that's what I want if I don't have God living on the inside why serve him but I believe it's been promised there's a message that is going to unveil God where we don't just see him but we know him we don't just see him but we can experience the realities of it and brother Brandon would tell us we've had many fine preaching many fine evangelists and pastors but he says the main thing I'm trying to bring to you is the reality of the presence of Christ oh my not just an idea of the presence of Christ but he says I'm bringing the reality of the presence of Christ and I believe that's what this message has done in this generation it's brought the realities where it was once a sealed book of just of just potentials but no longer is the potentials but now it's realities inside of a body but you see if you want to see God you have to understand God if you want to see the supernatural you have to understand the Supernatural and the Bible would tell us in Psalms 119 and 27 make me to understand the way of thy precepts so shall I talk of thy wondrous works so in order to declare his works we first have to understand and brother Brandon would tell us that it's only a special class of people that is going to understand God he would tell us you recall that I mention at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to just anyone but a special class of people he will take one with prophetic Insight he will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction not just student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear so that's why it's only a special class of people cuz it takes one with a prophetic Insight a prophetic Insight only comes to a prophetic class of people and oh my that class has to be predestinated and I'm so glad God predestinated me in this hour not just to see a form but to see a reality you see the church world can only produce what they see they can only produce what they understand but this bride produces what he understands which is Jesus Christ we can't help but see that the word made flesh in this hour is no longer just Jesus but now it's inside of a body it's inside of me and inside of you and brother Brandon would tell us that so many people have different opinions of Christ and he would say as he travels around the world you'll be surprised at the opinions that people have he says you'll be surprised to know what they think he says some says he's a philosopher talking about Christ he says some says he was just a great teacher some say he was just a prophet some say he was just a great man and brother brandom says he was all of those things but he was what that was plus oh my so that's why it's a prophetic Insight because you can see the same things that they're looking at but you look past the veil you see they're looking at a veiled book and all they see is a philosopher all they see is a prophet all they see is a great man but a prophetic inside of prophetic people look past that and see a prophet more than a prophet but there's a word in this generation a greater than Solomon is here it's a prophetic word that has come to a prophetic people that is receiving the word that they can know their God oh I want to know my God this morning not just a form but a reality I want to experience a person when I'm going through trials I can feel him when I go through heartaches I can feel him I want to know my God in the power of the Resurrection oh Hallelujah but you see it's a people that is understanding and identifying him cuz identifying him is to recognize where he's at today not a god of yesterday but a god of today not just justification sanctification not just 1906 but today he's in the for of his power coming to a people so it's somebody that is identifying him recognizing him where he is at today you remember when Nathaniel had met Jesus it wasn't what Jesus was wearing that revealed it to Nathaniel it was what Jesus was producing it was when Nathaniel would come to Jesus and Jesus would would start to reveal his heart let him know who he was and something would spark on the inside of Nathaniel but this was the Messiah it wasn't what he was wearing and brother Brandon would tell us he didn't have any credentials he didn't have a certain array of dresss but what he would have was the works of God that was spoken of that was his credentials and so when Nathaniel he looked past the veil he looked past the dress he looked past these things and seen the credentials which was the word of God and brother Brandon would tell us he's bringing the reality of the presence of God that we can identify him by the scripture and so that is what's going to identify him today is the scripture made manifest in this generation and that's what Nathaniel would see is the scripture being made manifest and you know like I said it wasn't the Garment that what he was wearing and too many people today you focused on a garment they get focused on a man the only time they're going to see God is when a certain man is preaching that's not the case if it's the word coming across the pull pit then that mean God is coming across the pull pit if the message is being preached that means the Supernatural is coming inside of the midst it don't matter who's preaching it don't matter who's teaching it don't matter if it's a convention all I want to hear is the word of God and that will bring the results it's the word of God that is going to change our bodies it's the word of God that is going to take us in the Rapture and it's the word of God today that changes situations it changes circumstances it brings Miracles it brings healings so that's what we need to focus on today is the word of God God identifying him where he is at oh Hallelujah and so the mystery of God is going to unveil who God is but inside of the mystery of God is going to be who you are you know inside of the mystery of God is going to be who the devil is so once we understand who God is we understand that the devil's a whoop hup come on now we understand that every one of his tricks will not work against the bride of Christ we understand who we are I'm not serpent seed but I'm the bride of Christ so knowing god brings an understanding of the entire plan of who God is oh Hallelujah that's why we needed a message to show us who God was because we went through church ages of church members not knowing who they were not knowing how to overcome but God would bring an understanding and let you know that I'm the God of all possibilities in your flesh I'm the God of all possibilities in your circumstances I'm the God not just of yesterday not of tomorrow but a god of today in your present time circumstances I'm the God in it oh Hallelujah but the only way to be the people the no God is to recognize his word and brother Brandon would tell us the scriptures is what testifies of him so that's what identified him was the scripture he says you believe that that's what we have to identify him today then we will know whether we are right or not whether it was him he was the same he would do the same and I just love that quote brother brandom says once you identify him then you know if you are right or if you're wrong and you know how many's ever been in in an argument before and you just know that you're right you know that you're right but somebody pulls up Dr Google and Google has all the answers right and then Google tells you that you're wrong you lose all your confidence you start second gu everything because you just knew that you was right but if it identifies and proves that you are right then there's a confidence on the inside that what you were saying is right and that's what brother Brandon was saying once you identify him then you know if you're were right or if you're were wrong and then that's when the bride becomes Fearless oh brother brandom says when something gets revealed to you you become Fearless you don't matter what the Skeptics say you don't matter what the naysayers say you don't matter what the devil says if something is revealed to you that you all right there's nobody that can take it away from you oh that's why we need to know God in this generation because you become Fearless with the promises of God then that changes our expectation I'm not just coming to church out of a form I'm coming to church out of a revelation I'm fearless I'm bold with my expectation but God is going to meet my need if I need healing in my body God's going to heal my body if I got lost loved ones God is going to save them you see somebody is becoming Fearless because they know in whom they have beli oh but the Brandon would tell us that David all he had was a little piece of leather but it was revealed to him and since it was revealed to him he was bold and it's so incredible brother Brandon would he would start to tell us that Saul was Head and Shoulders above the Army David's Brothers was more able to do it but then he says it was not revealed to them and that really struck me that here they were they had more to offer than what David had they had more gifts they had more talents they was more capable of being an overcomer but it wasn't revealed to him oh so that means to me you don't have to have anything to offer as long as you know you're God oh come on now you might not be able to sing you might not be able to preach you might not be a deacon but if you know you're God that makes the difference then there's more of an authority that is in your life than the Pope that is over in Rome because you know you're God oh hallelujah it's more than somebody that thinks they're A Gifted Man if you know they're God there's more of a Authority in your life and brother Brandon would tell us that that that David's Brothers knew God could do it but they didn't think they can do it in them oh my that's a tactic of the devil the God can heal but he can't do it for you oh come on now that God can save but God can't save you that there's going to be a Rapture but it ain't for you you see what that Revelation you start to cow down but with Revelation it's David saying where's the uncircumcised Philistine where is he he's calling out the armies of the Living God where is he you see when somebody gets a revelation you're not afraid to stand against the challenge oh we're living in a day where the devil's challenging everything that is right challenging everything we believe but with a boldness we're not afraid to stand up against the challenge oh I'm preaching now we're living in a day of pressure where the devil wants you to feel like like like you're a nobody wants to get you to feel like you're the minority you're going to stick out if you stand up for the things of God we're living in a day of pressure but we need somebody that is bold we need somebody that is fearless that ain't afraid to stand on the Promises of God let the doubter say what they want to but I've got something on the inside that I'm standing for I'm not standing for a Creed I'm standing for the word of God oh Hallelujah and brother Brandon M Contin wand in that quote if it's absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you you're going to get it you're going to get it I don't care what's wrong with you what the what the odds are it may be worse than David and Goliath but if it's revealed to you oh Hallelujah that's when exploits starts to come into come into into action when it's revealed to you it don't matter the odds that are stacking against you it don't matter what is coming against you if it's revealed to you it don't matter the odds but you see it's recognizing God that is going to bring forth exploits and you remember the two that walked on the road to EMAs they were talking about a Jesus of yesterday and they fa to identify him as a Jesus of today and we know that what the Bible tells us they were walking on the road talking about Jesus of yesterday and here Jesus would come on their midst and say who you're talking about and they would look at him and say are you a stranger in these parts you see that Jesus was a stranger before they could identify him but once they could identify him he was no longer a stranger but a reality oh come on now before you identify him he's a stranger but once you identify him that's somebody that knows their God you see what would happen after brother B tell us they invited Jesus in and then when he broke the bread their eyes was open what was their eyes open to the same way he broke the bread yesterday he's doing it today and so they realize that he's the same yesterday today and forever oh and little church once you identify him you realize that the god of my past is the god of my present the god that brought me this heart is going to take me through oh let me say this God ain't done with you God still has a plan on your life God ain't done with this church God still needs you God still needs Ministry God still needs deacon God still needs singers it's somebody that knows him and is saying the same God of yesterday is the god of today oh Hallelujah the god of yesterday is the god of today oh what did what did the burning tell Moses when he asked him who do I tell sent me the I am not the I was not the I'm going to be but the I am and that's what we need to say is the I am oh Hallelujah and I believe that's what Daniel is talking about the people that know their God or recognize their God will be strong and do exploits we'll be strong cuz brother Brown would tell us that the revelation of God is what gives the authority over the devil the revelation of God is what gives the authority over the devil and brother Brandon would tell us that nobody through the church ages should have to look back and wish they was with the apostles and and and I and I love the quote cuz brother Brandon would say there's no need to look back but look up he says Behold Him who is even now walking in the midst of the last AG's golden Candlestick he says the same God that was walking in the first golden Candlestick is walking here in the last and he would say there was no need to look back but look up Behold Him who is even now walking in the midst of the churches to all ages Behold Him who was the same yesterday today and forever who never changes either in essence or in his ways where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in their midst not only in their midst as a complacent onlooker or as a recording Angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is oh Hallelujah not just as a recording angel or a complacent onlooker but he's in the midst in the middle and I love that word midst in the midst is not just in the beginning not just in the ending but he's where you're at he's in the middle and when he comes in the midst that changes everything oh when he comes in the midst it changes every every aspect of the circumstance but you got to Behold Him and the word behold means to look oh brother Brandon would preach a message you got to look and live quit looking around at the serpents look at the brass serpent that was judged for you and is brought an atonement you got to get your eyes off of everything around you and behold him oh brother Brandon was saying Behold Him who is even now walking in the midst and you see John the Baptist would say in John 1:29 the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world or in other words look the Lamb of God and you see it was prophesied that there was going to be a redeemer cuz we know that the that through the Old Testament there was they were under the atonement of bulls and goats right and the blood of bulls and goats could never bring a remission of sins it just brought a forgiveness of sins right the Bible would tell us there in in in Leviticus Leviticus 4:35 for his sins that he hath committed and it shall be forgiven of him it's telling him if you go and slay a lamb the blood is going to forgive you so that would cover their sin or push the sin back but there was no remission you see a forgiveness forgives you but a remission separates you the word remission means to be separated or to be loose from prison or from the binds that bound you oh my so when Christ comes we didn't bring a forgiveness he brought a remission oh Hallelujah so when John looked and said Behold the Lamb of God he says look here's our remission you got to Behold Him you've got to identify him he's not just bringing a covering he's bringing a separation oh Hallelujah cuz the blood of bulls and goats if you would come to the Tabernacle and slay a lamb for lying you leave with that lying nature right so there was no atonement there was no Deliverance in that type but when Christ come brother brand would say all of the types in the Old Testament was met in Jesus so everything that Abraham had was in Jesus everything that the brast serpent had was in Jesus the Mana in the wilderness was in Jesus The Rock in the wilderness was in Jesus the the uh the the uh the Shak Glory was in Jesus everything thing that they had in the Old Testament in types or in portion was now in the fullness of Jesus Oh Hallelujah in a little church we've went through sanctification brother Brandon would tell us sanctification made way for justification or justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost but there's another step of it but he says but the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself the perfect word to come in perfection oh Hallelujah and so everything the justification had is in this fullness oh come on now everything the sanctification had is in this fullness everything the 1906 had is in this fullness so in other words what they had in portion we got in fullness we don't just got a glare of another day we got the light we got the fullness in the evening time it shall be like we're not in a glare we're in the fullness the has been given us so whenever whenever John looked and said Behold the Lamb of God he was pointing them to somebody and brother Brandon would tell us that John was the attraction but whenever Christ come he says the attraction went from the prophet to the prophecy oh Hallelujah and we know brother brandom would come and forun the second coming of Christ he was pointing to something and brother brandom will tell us he's bringing to you the reality of Jesus Christ brother Brandon will tell us there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ he says the appearing is he is here in the fullness of his power so here come brother the brand I'm telling you Behold Him who was walking now in the midst oh little church we're not walking this road by yourself we're not walking this road in confusion but the very word that said let there be light is the very word that has been given to us in the midst of your circumstance oh I believe the God of all possibility goes to work with you the God of all possibility is in the kitchen with you when you're preparing food for your family the God of all possibility ain't a God of yesterday but he's a god of today he's not in Jerusalem he's not in Jeffersonville but deity the God of all possibility is living inside of a housewife he's living inside of a mother oh Hallelujah it ain't a God in our imagination but we know him we beheld him we see him we've experienced the realities of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's Bri a separation oh this message has separated us has separated us from the rest of the church members and Has Lifted us up into a bright age where we're not just walking in confusion but we know who we are where the Brandon would tell us this is the fourth light and he would say what is the fourth light he says it's the word made manifest oh Hallelujah he says it's the word made manifest it's the proof of the Resurrection sign and what was the resurrection sign brother the or the Bible would tell us that they come to Jesus and would say give us a sign and Jesus would tell them as as Jonah was in the belly of the well for three days and nights so will the son of man be in the belly of the Earth for three days and nights and so we know whenever Christ went into the grave God never died the body died right cuz brother Brandon would tell us that Jesus he would go to go to hell and would preach to the souls that were in prison he would go to paradise and would set them free from from from the the blood of bulls and ghosts there was a remission now that they could go up with Jesus right and so in order for the resurrection sign to take place and there to be proof the body had to come out of the Tomb and in order for the body to come out of the Tomb life had to come back to it oh come on now so whenever life come back to the body then the body would come out of the Tomb proving that the resurrection sign is being fulfilled and brother Brandon would say the fourth line is the proof of the Resurrection sign today it's the same life that brought Christ out of the Grave is the same life that has brought us out of ideas out of traditions hallelujah it's the same life comeing to a body saying you are the resurrection sign your proof that Jesus Christ is alive and well inside of your skins it's the word made manifest inside of a bride body oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say that the Old Testament and the New Testament his husband and wife and he would say Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament and his bride fulfills the New Testament oh you've got scripture to fulfill and you know you're God you can't help but fulfill the promises that God has for your life oh what I say is it's time to defy the pressure defy all of the naysayers the comes against you all the doubters that comes against your mind I say it's time to throw them out come on now let's throw out those evil thoughts let's throw out the complexes let's throw it out so that we can see God who he really is oh hallelujah it's proud of Separation oh my brother Brandon would tell us whenever whenever uh uh whenever Mary recognized Jesus at Simon's house remember when she washed his feet brother brandom says when she recognized him it released to her forgiveness of sins oh my forgiveness of sins and so in other words whenever he whenever she recognized him it opened up a channel for her Deliverance oh it's opened up a channel for her deliverance and little church there's been a channel that has been opened up in this generation where we're on talking terms with God you don't got to go to a pope somewhere and try to talk to God there's a channel that has been opened up you know with the Brandon would tell us that stepen was so full of hidden power that whenever he was being stoned he says that spirit that was upon him would go through the stars go through the mist and go all the way up till he could see Jesus standing at the right hand of the father and so so the spirit that was upon him would defy his natural circumstances come on I'm preaching now it would def even though he was being stoned even though he was being persecuted what was on the inside would break into the realities of who Jesus was oh you might go through some hard times you might go through some circumstances where you don't feel like you can press on but there's a channel that has been opened up to the throne room of God where you can get on your knees and say God I'm in need of some of some healing I'm in need of some encouragement I'm in need oh hallelujah it's somebody that knows their God and channel has been opened up I say it's time to defy the ODS and start claiming the promises of God this ain't time to lay down the word it's time to pick it up it's time to pick up this word and say my mind is mine my body is mine oh Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is mine a renewing is mine a sound of mind is mine oh I don't care what the devil will stole from you there's a channel that has been opened up there might be depression that is upon your mind there's a channel that has been opened up there might be oppression that is coming against you there's a channel that has been opened up oh Hallelujah all the way to the throne room of God once this lady recognized Jesus there was a channel that was opened up and brother Brandon would tell us that she was redeemable from before the woman up the whale was redeemable from before the foundation of the world and whenever she recognized Jesus brother brandom says it redeemed her back to that image oh Hallelujah God didn't see her as a prostitute he had an image of perfection oh come on now God didn't see her as somebody that had a lot of blame against her he seen her blameless and whenever she recognize who Jesus was that image that was in God's mind would be brought back to that body oh little church we've identified who this word is and it's brought the image of who God is inside of life he didn't see you Bound by depression he seen you free in the spirit he didn't see you Bound by complexes he seen you with the freedom of worship and when you identify him that channel brings the thoughts of God inside of your body and you manifest it oh that's why we're here on Earth is to manifest the thoughts of God oh the devil likes to tell you that you're an accident you're a nobody you're a cast away but you are the very fulfillment of scripture for this generation the very purpose of you being on Earth is to fulfill your part of scripture oh don't let complexes take away the certainty of what God has done for you in this generation amen oh brother the Brandon will tell us the body of Christ is one Spirit where every member from Pentecost to this time drinks of the same new wine the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the same results how do we do it by one spirit it's God God's open door oh hallelujah it's God's open door and he says the Holy Spirit he says what is it it's God's open door it's a sign it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's an assurance it's a rest it's a peace it's goodness it's healing it's life it's God's open door to all of these things oh so there's a channel that has opened up in the Bible it tells us that God opens doors that no man can shut and shuts doors that no man can open so if God has opened up a channel has opened up a door to the bride that means nobody can shut it oh come on now that means all of Heaven has been poured out upon this bride there's an open door there's a channel that has brought you to the throne room of the king you remember Esther for such a time as this you have been placed here and what would Esther do she would have to defy the odds oh come on there's too many Esters today that has the potential of her word being materialized but she can't defy the odds little Esther had complexes and insecurities they were telling her now if you go before the king you're going to be denied if you go before the king you're going to be disappointed if you go before the king he's going to kill you but once she step past that and come before the king the king have the golden scepter and when see whatever you ask it will be given to you oh somebody had to defy the odds for such a time as that was her fulfillment the very reason she was placed in the kingdom was for her to come before the king oh little church the very reason that you've been placed here is because there's a channel that has been opened up there's an open door you can come before the king with your petition you can come before the king with your request Hallelujah even now he's walking in the midst of the candlesticks in the midst oh Hallelujah not as going place an onlooker but he's walking in the midst and when he comes in the midst it changes everything you remember the three Hebrew boys that were thrown into the fiery furnace we know the story it's a simple story but the Bible says they were bound hand and foot and thrown in the midst of the fire and the Bible would say that the king will look and say did we throw four three men bound into the midst of the fire three men bound but then he looks again says how come there's four men loosed in the midst in the midst whenever God come in the midst then that bounds that were that were binding them would be loosed oh that's what happens when he comes in the midst nothing could hold your mind that's what happens when he comes in the midst there's a liberty a freedom of worship oh come on now you remember the the little woman that was caught in the act of adultery the Bible says they threw her at the feet of Jesus Jesus and so that they could accuse him they were trying to accuse him but the Bible would say he was the perfect lamb even pilot would say I find no fault in him right he was Perfection there was nothing against him and here would come a prostitute that was caught in the act of adultery that didn't that have blamed against her but then Jesus will look down and will start to write in the hand and will look up and would say where were thine accusers hath no man condemned thee Oh hath no and God didn't a condemn her man condemned her oh and too many times we're condemned what men say say about us come on now people's words can condemn our heart where we are we're scarred we don't got we have no courage we've got no Authority I'm preaching now but what God what what what God thinks of you is different than what complexes think of you have no man condemned thee and so he looked at her and would say neither do I condemn thee so the Perfection that he would have in himself he would bestow to a prostitute that needed to be stoned oh and the Bible would say when he stood up he says he was alone in the midst in the midst all of the accusers were gone all the ones that condemned her was gone and she stood in the midst of him oh that's what happens when he comes in the midst complexes what people say against you are gone oh Hallelujah I don't care what words have been coming against you he's in the midst he's in the midst the Bible would say us if a heart condemn us not then we are boldness that's why the Devil comes with words and with with complexes with with bitterness and with gossip against you trying to take away your confidence but he has com in the midst that there's no condemnation against your heart there's no complexes Hallelujah I say it's it's time to Behold Him let's recognize him let's see him as who he is we're a people that know our God we're not somebody that is condemned we're somebody that knows Our God hallelujah there's a separation he's brought a remission of sins Hallelujah he's brought a separation that separation ain't just for sins that separation is for complexes that separation is for a condemned heart that is brought by naysayers the separation has come to let you know that I am in the mid you can behold me hallelujah hallelujah you can behold me oh Hallelujah I've come in the midst the Bible would say in Romans 3:25 for the remission of sins that are passed oh Hallelujah the remission of sins that are passed not just present Sins Not Just sins you might commit tomorrow but the sins you've committed yesterday there's a remission you see that that's another spirit that comes against you is condemn that says I know what you did yesterday I Know What You Did 10 years ago I know how you done that and how you done this there's a remission of sins of the past and not just the sins of today but the sins of the past there's a separation if you can be ho him oh Hallelujah so recognizing him brother brandom says recognizing him releases his power recognizing can releases his power because we know that the soldier smacked Jesus and felt no virtue smacked him and said tell us who hit you but then there was a woman with the issue of blood that would touch the same vessel but released to her the resurrection what released to her virtue you see you got to recognize him oh my too many people get become so critical that they fa to recognize him oh my I'm feeling good up here too many people become so critical that they fail to see that the one that the preacher preaches about is a god of today and he's my god oh hallelujah it's time to throw the critic on this up the door let's throw the bitterness out the door I don't care what the what so and so said against you throw it out the door come on now I don't care how they hurt you throw it out the door I don't care how you're scared throw it out the door I don't care what they're saying throw it out the door oh hallelujah oh my touch the vessel brother Brandon would tell us that the the Rich Young Ruler didn't recognize who Jesus was he heard the same words of life that didn't do nothing for him but here here Legion would hear the same life the same words and would set him free oh Hallelujah brother the Brandon would tell us the pilate didn't recognize who Jesus was and would later on go insane and commit suicide one was bound the other was free what what made the separation what made the difference recognizing oh Hallelujah we we we we've got something in this generation but the Brandon would tell us here he says when he is not recognized his power is always not revealed when he is not recognized no matter how much God Is Standing present you got to believe it like the woman with the issue of blood with the blood issue all of them were passing by all of them were standing up saying there goes the rabbi that's the guy that claims to be a prophet that's the fanatic all all such as that but what happened the little woman had a blood issue had issue of blood and she had heard about him and when she come down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized who he was regardless of what anybody said hey words are powerful come on now words are powerful words can uplift words can destroy words can heal words can bruise words are powerful but she didn't care what the words was she recognized him come on now she didn't care what the words was she recognized him and he would continue on to say and she said if I can only touch His Garment see and when that genuine faith in God become a positive thing to her what did it release it released to her his power to heal her oh Hallelujah it released her his power to heal her it touched him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her your faith has saved you what did Faith other standing there might have been sicker than she was but you see she recognized his presence she know that that was her opportunity amen she know this was her opportunity oh I know it might be just a Sunday morning this morning but recognize this is your opportunity oh words that have hurt you this is your opportunity complexes that have kept you this is your opportunity hurts and bitterness that has kept you this is your opportunity others might not care the one across the aisle might not care but the woman that had a need she cared she cared she wasn't going to let this moment pass by little church it's time to start caring again I care this service is my service I don't care who's preaching I don't care who's singing this is my opportunity I want to see Jesus I want to see the power of God I want to see the hurts in my life healed I want to see the bitterness that was brought by words healed Hallelujah I want to know my God not just in a form not just in a a ritual but I want to know the realities I want to know the realities this is my opportunity I'm recognizing God oh Hallelujah whenever jeras recognized the presence of God and released to him the resurrection power oh his daughter was dead but he recognized something and want say I'm a man I'm a man of authority I'm a man if I say I say Allegiance they go they come they go but you speak the word you speak the word and my servant will be healed oh Hallelujah it was the words it was somebody recognizing God and so the exploits of faith is going to come by understanding who God is not a god of yesterday but a god of today not a god of tomorrow but a god of today then that produces exploits then the people shall be strong we're living in a day of weariness come on we're living in a day of Mind batt battles we're living in a day where we're hard it's man I wake up in the morning and I'm tired my goodness it's the spirits of the enemy that fights the mind but the people that know their God shall be strong oh shall be strong spiritually they know their God they're not just a weakling but there's some Faith muscles come on now there's some Faith muscles that can take the word of God it's somebody that knows they're God and they're strong oh Hallelujah but you see the Bible tells us of two different people and what's going to separate these two is understanding who God is cuz if you read the the Daniel 11 it's it's it's an incredible scripture because it's painting a dark story of what's going on how there's judgment how's there's this but then he stops and he says but the people he makes a separation that they're going to do their thing they're going to go on in their sins they're going to go on but the people that know my God and I believe that this is talking about a literal people not just a figurative people not just an imag Ary people but brother Brandon takes this scripture in the end time and says now is the time he says the church world has been given their opportunity to see him but they rejected their very Messiah but the people there's somebody that is going to know him and I believe it's not just a random people but it's a chosen people cuz if it wasn't a chosen people you would have rejected your chance as well but because you're chosen you've identified him and brother Brandon would tell us that there's only one who can seek him that's the one who is predestinated to see him or he says otherwise you'll never see him and he talked about the Jews he says their very Messiah was in their midst and they fell to see him but it's because of predestination you can't help but seek him oh Hallelujah brother Brandon going talk about Abraham and said no us God when he called Abraham he didn't say Abraham if you would do a certain thing I would do a certain thing he says Abraham I had already done it not what you did what I did God said he says now when he made made a covenant with Adam if you'll not touch that tree you'll live forever Adam broke it Moses and them if you keep the Commandments I'll do so and so if you break the Commandments I'll do so and so when God makes a covenant with man man breaks his Covenant with God but so that the elected the church the elected people the called out separated group of people would sure to be saved God called them by his grace oh God wanted to make sure you are sure to be saved he called you by Grace he knew oh Hallelujah he knew words were going to hurt you but he would say my grace is sufficient you remember the Apostle Paul he was he was praying about about what was coming against him and he says I asked the Lord three times take this from me and he says each time God come back and says my grace is sufficient for thee your weakness is made in your weakness my strength is made perfect in other words my grace is going to bring forth exploits in your weakness oh my you see God can't God can't perform Supernatural things if there's nothing to perform right how would you know God could heal if you never was sick how could you know God can deliver if you never was bound so God's grace takes the weakness and perfects his strength in it oh he brings a perfect perfect strength in human weakness that's why God has come to humanity he wanted to get glory in the midst of it all he couldn't get glory in the Angels they were perfect he couldn't get Glory but he come to Fallen human beings he come to somebody that had mind battles and through them he would reveal to them who he was so that there could be exploits oh Hallelujah cuz everybody is trying to be the people everybody wants to be the bride of Christ but you can't choose the body God has to choose you and you see it's the favor of God coming to election it's because God has chose you this message will pour out God's favor upon you the Bible would tell us while Daniel he was praying for 21 days y'all remember that and he felt like nothing was coming but then the angel would say this in Daniel 9:22 and and and he informed me this is Daniel speaking and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I have now come forth to give thee skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplications the Commandment came forth and I am come to show thee for thou were greatly beloved therefore understand understand the matter consider the vision oh I just love that since you were greatly Beloved the word beloved means greatly loved dear to the heart of God since he was dear to the heart of God God would send an angel with a message and would say consider the vision consider the vision and I say little church consider the vision this ain't your end you're not going to go down in discouragement you're going up you're going up as The Virtuous blood-washed bride of Jesus Christ but you got to consider the vision you see people like the vision but they don't want to consider the vision they don't want to get in the vision they don't want to dig in the tapes God has sent us a message in this generation to bring ausing to bring him in the midst that we can seek Him who he is but I just love that nobody else was getting an angel but the one that was dear to the heart of God did nobody else has got an angel in this generation but the one that was dear to the heart of God you have got an angel in this generation but you see the bride has been separ ated by your understanding the Bible would tell us in John 15:6 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you so when when you was unable to choose God God still chose you when you was uncapable you remember Peter Peter said oh yeah God I'll stick with you Jesus I'm not going to deny you I'll go with you to the death I'm not going to deny you but in the time of pressure sometimes the pressure just gets to us come on now sometimes the bitterness just gets to us sometimes hurt feelings just get to us us and we we we just can't defy it but it's not over there's still a Grace for you cuz you remember after Peter denied Jesus says I I don't know him I never heard of him I I'm not one of us followers we we know the story whenever Christ went to the Grave come back up he met the two ladies that were walking to the to the to the tomb I believe and he would tell them go tell my disciples and tell Peter and tell Peter the one that's that lied the one that cursed the one that is in bitterness right now come on little church the one that is in hurt feelings right now the ones that is in complexes right now go tell them go tell them my grace is sufficient oh Hallelujah and I'm letting you know you might have fallen but get back up you might have fallen in bitterness but get back up you might have fallen in hurt feelings but get back up you might have fallen in criticalness but get back up he's resurrected and has come in the midst it says my grace is sufficient I have called you by what you can do I called you by what I can do it's not over my grace is for you I've called you by my grace Peter I know you might be out on a boat naked right now but my grace still called you before you lied my grace called you before you blasphemed my grace called you and before you was in bitterness his grace had called you oh Hallelujah his grace had called you oh Hallelujah the Lord whenever the Apostle Paul was denying Christ God still chose him oh Moses whenever he he he he was running running from his calling Grace still chose him Grace still chose him but it's when he met God face to face that he could perform exploits brother Brandon would tell us the burning bush had what he lacked what Moses needed was in the burning bush oh my and what we needed is inside of this message it has brought the same Pillar of Fire that was in the burning bush has been restored in this generation has been brought back in our midst you know brother brand of mat tell us the same Pillar of Fire the wrot the Old Testament wrot the New Testament is the same Pillar of Fire that is here interpreting what those other ones wrote oh we're not blind leading the blind we're following the pillar of fire it's briad an interpretation oh my I spoke about Nathaniel a few minutes ago but what did Jesus say to Nathaniel in John 1:47 Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith of him behold an Israelite in whom is no G Nathaniel saith unto him whence knowest thou me and Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw you man that spoke to me you know you hear that all the time you read it all the time but when I was studying on these things that really spoke to me before he ever had a chance to see Jesus Jesus saw him oh Hallelujah now you I might be crazy but I believe it was inspiration that Phillip would go to Nathaniel and would say hey the messiah's here and God still pours out inspiration God still has a fivefold Ministry God still has a pastor that will come up and bring to you that God already saw you oh Hallelujah while you was still in your circumstance I saw you H Nathaniel while you was under the tree you might have been under the tree brokenhearted you might have been under the tree confused you might have been under the tree whatever put yourself under that tree this morning while you was under that tree with bitterness while you was under that tree with criticalness God already saw you and because God saw you he would bring a remission oh Hallelujah because God saw you he will bring a separation but you notice Jesus didn't just reveal to him that he already saw him but then he would say this in John 1:50 Jesus answered and said unto him because I said unto thee I saw thee under the fig tree believest thou Thou shalt see greater things than these in other words because I saw you you've got some greater things to produce since I saw you you've got exploits to produce and this message didn't just bring us that we was predestinated before the foundation of the world but he lets you know you're the briad body of Christ to manifest the word so you're not just God don't didn't just see you but he has fruits for you to produce he has exploits to for you to produce it's brought to you the power of the Resurrection oh Hallelujah many people want to perform the great big wonders wonders of the supernatural but they fail to see the little things you see exploits you know then like I said this has really been speaking to me I I remember you know as a minister I I've never seen a vision I've never prophesied before God's never never used me in that aspect but if that was the the the the the definition of exploits I would be left out you would be left out so exploits ain't always the great Supernatural exploits is the fruits oh come on now if God's working through you in Visions hey do it but if God's working through you through just the life don't fail to see the exploits don't fail to see God's working in you don't fail to see that I might not sing I might not preach but what God has given you something to do you might be a prayer Warrior you might be somebody that testifies maybe you're just a wife that is raising up paradoxes come on now maybe maybe that's the way God sees you don't fail to see the way God sees you cuz you remember Gideon the Bible would tell us that Gideon would come to or the the angel of the Lord would come to Gideon and would say you're a mighty man of Valor yall remember that and what would Gideon say my family is poor and I'm the least in my father's house you know one definition of word the word Valor is wealthy you know not really stood out to me cuz here the angel of the Lord come and says you're wealthy but Gideon the way Gideon saw himself was poor oh my you got to look at yourself the way God sees you God don't look at you and see failures God looks at you and see and sees exploits come on now God don't look at you and see a mistake God looks at you and sees exploits God looks at you and sees a paradox God looks at you and sees his blood oh Hallelujah we got to look at our the way God sees us God don't see God don't see mistakes oh Hallelujah God sees exploits true here come the angel of the Lord and here Gideon says if God be God where are his miracles where's the Miracles of our fathers he was he was discouraged he wanted to see God and here come an angel saying you're it you're the miracle you're the Paradox you're the exploit You're the One You're The Vessel God is using and oh my don't get discouraged little church don't get discouraged where is the god of Elijah he's with you you're the manifestation of the god of Elijah here Elisha would say where's the god of Elijah he took the manle and would say here Bowman the same Miracles that Elijah would produce Elisha would produce and brother Brandon would say there's a double portion that has been given to us where is the god of Elijah he's with you he's walking with you not just walking with you he's walking in you in the midst Lord Brother Brandon would say it was God above us God With Us now it's God in us he would say in another place it was God in a man now it's God in men it was one body now it's a multimember body oh but you got to see God oh Hallelujah you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask of the father in my name he may give it to you oh I just love that that whatsoever that whatsoever you ask don't get the cart before the horse a lot of people want to do the supernatural want to speak the word that comes with it or might not you may never speak the word but he called you to produce a life come on he called you to produce a life but the mark you might be the truck driver but God called you for exploits come on now you're all of us you might you might feel like you're just simple as simple can be but God called you you didn't call me I called you you didn't choose me I chose you and since I chose you I chose you to bring forth fruit to bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain oh I just love that that your fruit should remain no matter the ups and the Downs it's remaining no matter the fiery furnace it's remaining no matter the heartaches it's remaining oh Hallelujah but then he links the good fruit and the third po together I just love that that whatsoever you ask don't fail to don't fail to live the life cuz that's what's going to produce the Supernatural is the life that's what's going to produce it oh my hope this is okay this morning I'll bring this down to a close here in a minute just bear with me but something that really was speak speaking in my heart as I was studying on these things but a lot of times mothers feel left out right I'm not a mother so I wouldn't know but watching my wife you know as we as we evangelize she's the one that's we're fighting with the children you know getting ready for church you know and I remember brother Danny steaman was preaching at brother Bryce Collins this past year and he says when he was evangelizing he said he preached man he felt good he come back to the car feeling great and he says his wife looked at him and says we need to get our lives right he says I was feeling great but she was fighting twins all service you know and sometimes the wives feel left out but you know brother Brandon would say You're The Fifth Gospel he was say it's Matthew Mark Luke John mothers you know cuz how come it's it was my Matthew Mark Luke and John that brings the Life of Christ right it's the gospels that that bring the Life of Christ and it's the mothers that brings the The Life of Christ to the children brother Brandon would say that John would make the connection whenever he was on the boat with Jesus and he started to testify but the Brandon must say that John made the connection between Jesus and Jehovah because of the mother oh my so God has exploits from others brother brandom says God hides himself in Housewives he said says he hides himself from Little virgin girls he says he hides himself from the daddy that goes to work with his lunch under arm under his arm and he says they would do something that the Archbishop knows nothing about he says it's Simplicity it's God coming to the simple folks it's God coming to somebody that they don't know they're anything brother brandom says it's because they know they're nothing but God can do something through them oh man it's because your mothers feel like you're nobody but God can work through you you remember blind bmus it was blind B brother Brandon would tell us that his little his mother would set him on her knee and would tell her stories of Elisha of Elijah how Joshua would March around the walls and the walls would come fall down and all of a sudden I could just imagine you know here here here blind B ofus that have these stories growing up from his mother from The Fifth Gospel then he would hear a commotion right and brother Brandon would tell us there was a little girl that would say hey Jesus is coming by and now those stories that he heard of his mama he would make a connection with Jesus The Fifth Gospel would bring blind Bas she may have been off the scene but that Fifth Gospel brought a connection to his remission brought a connection to the separation of his blindness oh M don't get tired don't get discouraged don't get weary and wello because in due season you will reap if you faint not I know it's hard I know it's wearisome but keep on fighting keep on pressing on on there's a connection being made you see when you look at your children it's a paradox that your children are sitting in church we're living in a day of insanity it's a miracle nowadays if your kid don't turn to be a lesbian or a transgender we're living in a day where the pressure is so great but sitting on the pews this morning it's paradoxes but the random says the Paradox is something that that's impossible but yet it's true it's something that don't don't look fathomable but yet it's true to have children that love God they have children that lift their hands and worship God it's paradoxes because of a Fifth Gospel it's a paradox it don't seem possible but yes but yet it's true oh Hallelujah brother Brandon will talk about we'll talk about amram and jbed and you know and and it's the the message is called the teaching on Moses and I just encourage parents to listen to it if you get the time and it really I loved it because brother Brandon would say here jocked he was working and that the Lord would give him a vision that he was going to have a he was his his his son was going to be a redeemer and what really spoke to me because I've had these thoughts myself but jocked would say but this ain't the right time for a child because all the children you know it was such a it was such an evil time and he would say this ain't time to have a child and that really spoke to me I remember that when I got married I was said man this is an evil time it's why have children now you know know but here the Lord would speak to him and say I've got something for him to do and here here he would come here would come Moses and this part of the story really really struck out to me really stood out to me brother Brandon would say Pharaoh would get the get his courts together and you know they would come together and Pharaoh would say we got all these children that are coming up what should we do you know instead of wiping out the elders they went out to the children and you see that's what the devil's trying to do he can't get the elders he's going after the Next Generation that's why we need fifth gospels come on now whenever Jesus was upon the Earth who did Herod go after the gener the Next Generation he knew the promise was at hand the Deliverance was at hand so he would go to the Next Generation and here we are on the Third Exodus right it's time to go home who's he after the Next Generation but what stands in his way the Fifth Gospel it's the Fifth Gospel that stands in the way from the pressures of the world and the children at home oh man the brother Brandon mat tell us you know here jocked goes to work he's working on the he's working on the YK and he's singing I'm one I think it's I'm one of them he's singing he's singing he's working on this and brother Brandon would say he had a hiding place a secret place for Moses and he says in this court there would be some witches that would come up and would say I know what to do and he dramatizes it you hear you hear the kids laughing and and the mothers you know and he and he would come the Witch and say Lord leave king Pharaoh you know and he said I got something for you to do go after the children and here brother Brandon would say here come the soldiers the those witches the long-nosed witches he would call them banging on the door and he would and they would say I know you got a baby in there and brother Brandon makes a comment that I just love he says not one not one for you to have and oh I just love that I'm not saying we don't got one but we don't have one for you to get oh Fifth Gospel you the the devil might be taking this home he might be taking that teenager he might be taking this one and taking that one you don't got one to give this ain't time to give up this ain't time to lay down this ain't time to get discouraged this is time to stand somebody knows they God they're performing exploits you got paradoxes you've got exploits don't don't Del little what God is doing in your life oh Hallelujah we don't got one for you to have oh my as a parent that's my attitude Satan I don't got one for you I don't got one for you go to the next house and mother brandom said they would leave and say okay we'll come back and as they come back well the BAM says they had a hiding place they would hide that they would hide Moses in this hiding place and they would come in but couldn't find him cuz he was in The Hiding Place oh man there's a secret place that we can live in but the Bible will tell us there's a Peaceable habitation that we can dwell in a Peaceable habitation we're living in a day of insanity but there's a peaceful habitation that our children can live in oh hallelujah our wives or husbands can live in whenever the spirits come knocking out the door there's a Peaceable habitation they can try to break
