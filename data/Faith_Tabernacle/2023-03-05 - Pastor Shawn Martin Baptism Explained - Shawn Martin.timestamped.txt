[44:16] but before we go into the word may we
[44:19] just bow our heads and talk to our Lord
[44:24] father who is the author of this word
[44:28] Lord your prophetis that reading the
[44:32] Bible doesn't help us to understand if
[44:34] we
[44:35] if we aren't in love with the author
[44:40] I believe everyone this morning
[44:44] is Desiring a greater love for you I
[44:48] know I do Lord I
[44:51] I want to know you more
[44:53] I want that relationship to grow father
[44:58] for that's the only way Lord that we
[45:00] would really understand the Bible
[45:03] for it's a love letter Lord and if we
[45:06] can know your heart then we can really
[45:08] know the meaning
[45:09] of what you've spoken what you've
[45:12] written
[45:13] and I pray father that you would just be
[45:16] with us this morning
[45:19] father just come in a special way and
[45:22] and not only anoint myself as we would
[45:26] Minister the word but
[45:27] anoint those that would hear the word
[45:31] father and help us just to all be
[45:34] receptive and things that we may already
[45:38] know but father let it find a betting
[45:41] ground and in a young heart father may
[45:46] just stir up the the remembrance of her
[45:49] mind father we ask it Lord and we love
[45:53] you in Jesus Christ's name amen
[45:58] we want to turn to the book of Acts the
[46:00] first chapter
[46:02] I believe it is or the second chapter I
[46:05] should say and we're going to read a few
[46:07] verses here
[46:08] and um
[46:11] it says and when the day of Pentecost
[46:14] was fully come
[46:15] they were all with one Accord in one
[46:18] place and suddenly there came a sound
[46:21] from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind
[46:24] and it filled all the house where they
[46:27] were sitting
[46:28] and there appeared unto them cloven
[46:30] tongues like as a fire and it sat upon
[46:34] each of them and they were all filled
[46:36] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[46:38] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[46:40] them utterance
[46:42] and there were dwelling at Jerusalem
[46:45] Jews
[46:47] devout men out of every nation under
[46:50] heaven
[46:51] now when this was noised abroad the
[46:55] multitude came together and were
[46:57] confounded because that every man heard
[46:59] them speak in his own language
[47:02] and they were all amazed and marveled
[47:04] saying one to another behold are not all
[47:07] these which speak galileans
[47:11] and how here we every man in our own
[47:15] tongue we're in we were born if you go
[47:18] to the 12th
[47:20] uh verse here and they were all amazed
[47:23] and were in doubt saying one to another
[47:25] what meaneth this others mocking said
[47:27] these men are full of new wine
[47:30] but Peter's standing up with the 11
[47:32] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[47:35] ye men of Judah Judea and all ye that
[47:39] dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto
[47:41] you and hearken to my words for these
[47:43] are not drunken as you suppose saying it
[47:46] is but the third hour of the day but
[47:48] this is that which was spoken by the
[47:52] prophet Joel
[47:53] so then if you'll go to this 37th verse
[47:57] now Peter the rest of these verses up to
[48:00] this 37th he's ministering uh and and
[48:05] preaching to them
[48:07] but here in the 37th verse it says now
[48:11] when they heard this they were pricked
[48:13] in their heart and said unto Peter and
[48:15] do the rest of the Apostles men and
[48:17] Brethren what shall we do
[48:19] in other words what shall we do to be
[48:21] saved they're asking the question
[48:24] and Peter's said unto them repent and be
[48:28] baptized every one of you in the name of
[48:30] Jesus Christ
[48:31] for the remission of sins and you shall
[48:35] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[48:38] the promises unto you and to your
[48:40] children and to all that are afar off
[48:43] even as many as the Lord are God shall
[48:48] call amen you can have your seats this
[48:52] morning
[48:54] and um
[48:57] I I want to say we want to keep brother
[49:00] Walker in our prayer as
[49:03] he's uh you know going through a lot of
[49:07] trial right now and
[49:10] making you know it's been uh he's having
[49:15] a major transition
[49:17] in his life and of course Sister Walker
[49:20] as well
[49:21] and they don't think that he will you
[49:25] know be able to go home
[49:27] and so
[49:29] um
[49:29] they're going to keep him at right now
[49:33] at the uh the place that he's at Pulaski
[49:37] Health and Rehabilitation Center
[49:40] and I don't know how long he will be
[49:42] there but eventually they're going to be
[49:44] putting him in a nursing home
[49:46] and I'm praying that he'll get to stay
[49:49] there you know and or somewhere close by
[49:53] you know but uh we we had got there the
[49:57] other day and so they were breaking the
[49:58] news to him and
[50:02] it's taking it pretty hard
[50:04] and uh so
[50:07] um so we we went in you know and so he's
[50:11] explaining to me and just his heart was
[50:14] just broke you know and um
[50:19] uh you know I I I about bald you know I
[50:23] was trying to keep it all in but it was
[50:26] just really heartbreaking sister Sue was
[50:29] there and
[50:30] Carla and the aid worker whoever she
[50:35] would be but
[50:37] you know I just try and told him said
[50:40] well let's look at the positive here you
[50:42] know if you stayed home if you're home
[50:45] at the four walls you ain't got nothing
[50:47] to do
[50:48] you know man you're still a minister
[50:51] and you can't preach you know behind the
[50:53] pulpit anymore you know last time we had
[50:55] him to preach here it really done him in
[50:59] and and he knew that he told his man I
[51:02] don't know if I could do that again
[51:04] and um and so he's a people's person he
[51:07] needs he needs people
[51:09] and so I really
[51:11] uh
[51:13] just encouraged him that I don't believe
[51:16] that God is done with him
[51:18] and uh that you know maybe God is
[51:23] you know as Christians we have to look
[51:25] at the purpose of God more than anything
[51:27] else and we have to rely on that
[51:30] and so you know I told him you know that
[51:33] the purpose of God may be
[51:35] for him to be in that place that maybe
[51:39] somebody could be reached through his
[51:41] ministry
[51:42] and um because I don't care how old you
[51:45] are you're still a minister because it's
[51:46] a gift it don't leave at a certain age
[51:50] and so as we begin to just to talk to
[51:52] him and and of course he you know he he
[51:55] was comparing his situation with my
[51:58] situation of losing my wife
[52:00] and and I had to tell him I said but
[52:02] that's not really the case
[52:04] I I said I you know
[52:08] my wife left I mean I can't talk to her
[52:10] I can't hold her hand I can't
[52:12] I can't do them things but
[52:15] you know sister Sue was right there I
[52:18] said you know she's she's there you know
[52:21] she'll be able to come and visit you
[52:22] she'll be able to come to see you you'll
[52:25] get to hear her voice you'll be able to
[52:26] hold her hand you'll be able to you know
[52:28] what I'm saying
[52:30] and so it really
[52:32] even though he was still shedding a
[52:34] little tears it it
[52:37] really helped him and so he told the the
[52:40] worker he says okay I'll stay
[52:42] and so when you if you go visit him just
[52:45] encourage him you know really pump him
[52:48] up and uh because he really needs that
[52:50] right now and I understand I
[52:53] I wouldn't want to you know leave my
[52:56] wife I mean the Lord's blessed me with a
[52:58] wonderful lady you know and uh
[53:02] there's a thought that I'd have to
[53:04] separate in way like that I don't know
[53:06] how I could take it but
[53:08] at the same time
[53:11] um this this must be the Lord's plan for
[53:14] him at this point
[53:16] and so you know he needs all of our
[53:18] encouragement
[53:19] if you have time to go visit him he
[53:22] needs that
[53:24] and
[53:25] um and I told him I'd assured him that
[53:28] we won't forget him you know it's it's
[53:30] not that at all and so I know he would
[53:33] appreciate that
[53:36] the other day uh sister Rihanna had
[53:40] texted me letting me know that the Lord
[53:43] had been dealing with her to be baptized
[53:47] and it just thrilled my heart
[53:50] to to to see that and so after service
[53:53] we're going to be uh Lord willing
[53:56] baptizing her
[53:58] and if there's anyone else that does
[54:00] feel the need to be baptized
[54:02] um you know we'd the water's there and
[54:06] so we would be glad to to do that
[54:10] though I have talked about baptism uh
[54:12] before I'm going to talk about it again
[54:14] and I always kind of like to do that
[54:17] just for the individual
[54:21] that may not
[54:23] um that if they're going to get baptized
[54:25] I want to make sure that I can explain
[54:27] it the best I know
[54:28] so they know beyond the shower without
[54:31] what they're doing
[54:32] and um you know
[54:35] and and so I'm going to to hit on it
[54:39] again
[54:41] um
[54:41] so we we know that baptism is one of the
[54:46] the three physical Divine orders that
[54:50] Jesus left us to do
[54:52] uh the other two uh are communion and
[54:56] foot washing
[54:57] and so these things that we are to do as
[55:01] Christian Believers and I I think we all
[55:03] believe that
[55:04] that even in in in spiritual or in
[55:08] communion it's not spiritual communion
[55:10] like many and some even in within the
[55:14] message ranks is leaning to that it's
[55:17] spiritual communion it's not it's it's a
[55:20] physical divine order of God that we
[55:24] would take that and so Peter in our
[55:28] opening scripture gives the formula as
[55:31] to what it takes to be born again a
[55:34] born-again Christian and and first of
[55:37] all he says repent then be baptized in
[55:40] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[55:42] remission of sins and then you shall
[55:45] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[55:49] two two things that we are to do and
[55:53] that is repent that's something that we
[55:55] do in a
[55:57] um physical way if you want to say it
[56:00] that way and then be baptized but
[56:02] receiving the Holy Ghost no man can do
[56:04] that it's God that does that
[56:07] and and so uh but we see that baptism is
[56:11] essential in the process of being saved
[56:15] uh you cannot bypass
[56:18] baptism and be saved you you can't uh
[56:23] for this was the scripture or the
[56:26] question what shall we do and uh to be
[56:30] saved and then this was the formula
[56:33] repent be baptized and you shall receive
[56:36] to the gift of the Holy Ghost the
[56:38] prophet said you're not even converted
[56:39] until you receive the Holy Ghost
[56:41] potentially you are but you're not until
[56:45] you receive the Holy Ghost and so Mark
[56:49] 16 15 Jesus said unto them go ye into
[56:52] all the world and preach the gospel to
[56:56] every creature and he that believeth and
[56:59] is baptized shall be saved and so I I
[57:05] personally you know uh don't think that
[57:09] the devil would encourage anyone uh to
[57:13] get baptized
[57:14] as much as the devil doesn't encourage
[57:17] anyone to repent uh it's it's it's not
[57:21] just there and unless unless it's being
[57:25] baptized in titles
[57:27] or a a perverted way of doing things of
[57:30] baptism and then of of course he'll push
[57:33] you in in that direction but to be
[57:36] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[57:38] there's I don't see there's any way that
[57:42] the devil encourages an individual uh uh
[57:45] to be baptized now he will encourage you
[57:47] to go to church he'll encourage you to
[57:50] do that he don't mind you doing that but
[57:52] uh to to follow the steps on being saved
[57:55] and and and these things he ain't going
[57:57] to do that
[57:59] um uh he'll get you messed up in some
[58:00] Doctrine you know uh just some off the
[58:04] wall thing but to really to follow the
[58:08] pattern of of the Gospel he he won't do
[58:11] that and so uh uh he would actually be
[58:15] the one to discourage a person uh to
[58:19] from obeying the the word of God so then
[58:23] we see that repentance is the first step
[58:25] and a person must repent before baptism
[58:30] can be effective in any way or have any
[58:35] meaning it's repentance before God and
[58:39] that's the first step that a person must
[58:41] receive and brother Branham said the
[58:44] first step is repentance towards God
[58:47] then follows after that is water baptism
[58:50] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[58:52] Christ see water baptism follows showing
[58:56] that repentance was genuine I'll say
[59:00] that again water baptism shows that
[59:04] repentance was genuine or to remit our
[59:08] past sins and that has nothing to do
[59:11] with future sin it only remits past sins
[59:17] so repent and be baptized in the name of
[59:20] Jesus Christ for what remission
[59:23] everybody say remission so see taking
[59:25] away of past sin has nothing to do with
[59:28] the future just your sin has been
[59:32] chopped off of what you've done see you
[59:36] can't repent for what Adam done you've
[59:38] never done it Adam did it you just get
[59:41] forgiveness for what you've done ain't
[59:43] that right so then again baptism shows
[59:47] that repentance was genuine it a genuine
[59:52] repentance was made and and and it
[59:55] doesn't matter as to what age a person
[59:59] is baptized
[1:00:01] um um I I think the the person needs to
[1:00:05] be of the age of accountability and and
[1:00:08] really there's no certain age uh as long
[1:00:12] as they know that the Lord is dealing
[1:00:15] with them and and so uh there there were
[1:00:19] uh uh two children that that had been
[1:00:23] baptized or had repented uh and they
[1:00:26] were at the ages of six and eight and uh
[1:00:30] they gave their heart to to the Lord
[1:00:32] that morning at an altar call and so the
[1:00:37] question was asked brother Branham
[1:00:38] because now they wanted to be baptized
[1:00:40] and so the question was asked brother
[1:00:43] Branham how soon should they be baptized
[1:00:46] at ages six and eight they just gave
[1:00:48] their heart to the Lord at the altar
[1:00:50] that day so they're asking and brother
[1:00:53] Brandon replied just as soon as you can
[1:00:56] just as soon as you can repent
[1:00:59] immediately and be baptized that's in
[1:01:03] the name of Jesus Christ see he said now
[1:01:05] uh so it was kind of question answers
[1:01:07] and he said so that's now that's the
[1:01:09] question number one and he said I would
[1:01:11] advise that right and so and if you
[1:01:15] notice that is actually according to the
[1:01:17] scripture for Acts 2 and 40 uh uh it
[1:01:21] says and with many other words did he
[1:01:24] Peter testify and exhort saying save
[1:01:28] yourselves from this untoward generation
[1:01:31] then they that gladly received his word
[1:01:35] were baptized and the same day were
[1:01:39] there were added unto them about 3 000
[1:01:43] Souls now what a service what a baptism
[1:01:47] service right every one of them 3 000
[1:01:50] Souls need to be baptized and uh uh that
[1:01:54] would have been pretty neat to be there
[1:01:55] you know uh see everybody lined up and
[1:01:58] and getting baptized but and so brother
[1:02:01] Branham said as soon as you believe on
[1:02:05] the Lord and accept him as your savior
[1:02:07] go right straight to the water and make
[1:02:10] your confession and say start right
[1:02:12] there young or old no matter who it is
[1:02:16] so then being young doesn't matter see
[1:02:22] um as uh uh Jesus said here in Mark 10
[1:02:25] and 14 suffer the little children to
[1:02:28] come unto me and forbid them not
[1:02:32] for such of such is the kingdom of God
[1:02:36] ain't that right
[1:02:37] so now baptism though isn't just a thing
[1:02:42] that we do just because we know it is
[1:02:46] needed to be done I think everything has
[1:02:49] to be by a revelation I you know uh and
[1:02:53] and I know uh sometimes us being uh
[1:02:57] maybe those raised in church and uh you
[1:03:00] know uh maybe you you've been taught
[1:03:02] that you need to repent and you've been
[1:03:05] taught you need to be baptized you need
[1:03:07] you're taught these things and you
[1:03:09] should be taught and and maybe then
[1:03:12] there there could be some type of a
[1:03:14] pressure uh well you know you need to
[1:03:17] get to an altar sometime soon you know
[1:03:19] you need to you know you need to get
[1:03:21] baptized you need to whatever
[1:03:24] um and and these things
[1:03:26] um
[1:03:28] um but but but we find that it it should
[1:03:33] only be a thing done if God is revealing
[1:03:37] it to you I I think because it calls
[1:03:40] salvation Salvation is a personal thing
[1:03:44] it's something that is personal between
[1:03:46] you and the lord it's it's nothing that
[1:03:49] that we do now we'll preach it you know
[1:03:52] and and you say man he's you're
[1:03:53] preaching at me to get baptized or
[1:03:55] something I just feel pressure no no
[1:03:58] that could be the devil just trying to
[1:03:59] stop you uh because if it needs to be
[1:04:02] preached we're going to preach it if
[1:04:04] it's if it's something that needs to be
[1:04:06] there but at the same time I think God
[1:04:09] needs to deal with the heart do you
[1:04:11] believe that and and so uh uh baptism
[1:04:14] should follow when as as when God is
[1:04:18] dealing with the heart and and uh We've
[1:04:21] repented and and if you will notice
[1:04:23] that's what happened after Peter had
[1:04:26] preached to these people is is the Bible
[1:04:30] says they were pricked in their heart
[1:04:33] while he was preaching they were pricked
[1:04:36] in their heart and then they I asked
[1:04:39] what they must do to be saved and so I
[1:04:43] looked up that word pricked it means to
[1:04:45] pierce through
[1:04:47] um thoroughly through the heart to
[1:04:49] pierce thoroughly through the heart that
[1:04:52] doesn't and and another Webster gives
[1:04:55] the definition of a nagging a sharp
[1:04:58] feeling of remorse regret or sorrow so
[1:05:02] so here Peter is preaching the gospel
[1:05:05] and while he's preaching the Holy Spirit
[1:05:08] was moving upon them and it was piercing
[1:05:12] them them words were piercing them and
[1:05:15] it wasn't bringing a condemnation but it
[1:05:18] was bringing a sorrow it was convicting
[1:05:22] them to where they cried out see they
[1:05:25] had this feeling of remorse they uh of
[1:05:29] regret of sorrow and and Peter couldn't
[1:05:32] have done that on his own but the Holy
[1:05:35] Ghost was doing that the Holy Ghost was
[1:05:38] working on both ends it was talking to
[1:05:41] prayer Peter a man Peter was under that
[1:05:43] unction of the Holy Ghost and he was
[1:05:45] given the message and and and the Holy
[1:05:48] Ghost was working on the people to where
[1:05:50] they would ask what do we do to be saved
[1:05:53] what what is this see and so we we find
[1:05:57] there Paul said in Romans 2 2 that it is
[1:06:00] the goodness of God everybody say the
[1:06:03] goodness of God that leadeth thee to
[1:06:06] repentance it is the goodness of God I
[1:06:09] got a lot of scriptures um so you don't
[1:06:12] have to keep up amen but uh it is the
[1:06:15] goodness of God that leadth to
[1:06:17] repentance and so an in an individual
[1:06:21] who had been baptized at the age of 13
[1:06:25] now was an adult and and so maybe they'd
[1:06:30] been raised in church and at 13 years
[1:06:32] old they had they had been baptized and
[1:06:36] so as an adult now they're out skin
[1:06:39] brother Branham a question and says I
[1:06:41] was baptized at 13 shall I be baptized
[1:06:44] again
[1:06:45] now notice what brother Branham would
[1:06:48] say if you've been a Christian all along
[1:06:52] then since you was 13 a believer in
[1:06:55] Christ I would remain like you are
[1:06:59] I would now he says see if God has
[1:07:02] blessed you and give you the holy ghost
[1:07:05] or Holy Spirit since then see see so
[1:07:09] baptism is only a form to show that
[1:07:13] again uh uh uh that a genuine repentance
[1:07:18] was made and it's it's it's it's it's to
[1:07:23] those that are watching so brother
[1:07:25] Graham says it's to show the world or
[1:07:28] those that are watching an audience like
[1:07:30] today sister Rihanna will be going in
[1:07:33] the water but it's showing everyone that
[1:07:36] are there as a witness that a true
[1:07:39] genuine repentance has been made see and
[1:07:43] and so
[1:07:45] um and he said see you're you're proving
[1:07:47] you are proving before witnesses that
[1:07:50] you have believed that God is his son
[1:07:53] and he died and rose again on the third
[1:07:57] day and you was buried in to him and
[1:08:00] have risen to walk in newness of life
[1:08:04] so this is why brother Branham would say
[1:08:07] if you were baptized as a young age and
[1:08:09] yet then you you start living like the
[1:08:12] world and all that then that baptism
[1:08:13] just wasn't true uh because
[1:08:18] um uh uh that's what baptism is to do I
[1:08:21] know baptism today is is just taken so
[1:08:25] lightly it's just taken for granted it's
[1:08:28] just something we do let's do it it's a
[1:08:30] it's a It's Christian Duty it's
[1:08:32] Christian ritual but but there is a
[1:08:35] meaning to baptism and and brother
[1:08:37] Branham even talked about those that
[1:08:39] would come to the altar you know in
[1:08:40] Billy Graham uh they would come to
[1:08:43] repent and and they actually would leave
[1:08:45] thinking they're repented but they're
[1:08:47] chewing gum they're they're just talking
[1:08:50] laughing there was nothing sincere but
[1:08:54] they would leave uh but they can because
[1:08:57] they they that was the thing to do you
[1:08:59] know what I'm saying maybe they come
[1:09:01] with their buddy or they come because it
[1:09:02] was Billy Graham or they come because of
[1:09:04] whatever ever or or they were drugged to
[1:09:07] the altar well that's why we don't drag
[1:09:08] people to altars and and all of these
[1:09:11] things it's it has to be a genuine thing
[1:09:14] and so brother Bradham said now those
[1:09:17] same people that watched you when you
[1:09:20] when you received a baptism is going to
[1:09:23] meet you at the Judgment see and and so
[1:09:26] the uh uh so this baptism is not a
[1:09:30] ritual it is is it's a testimony that
[1:09:33] that that that a genuine repentance has
[1:09:36] been made I am now going to serve god
[1:09:40] with everything I've got and and and you
[1:09:44] know you're you go down into that water
[1:09:47] and you're raised as a testimony of
[1:09:50] newness of life
[1:09:51] of newness of life and so uh baptism is
[1:09:56] essential and it is a must everybody say
[1:10:01] it's a must it's a must and so uh there
[1:10:05] John 3 3 Jesus said verily verily I say
[1:10:09] unto thee except a man be born again uh
[1:10:14] uh um of of water everybody say of water
[1:10:18] and of the Spirit uh I I gave you the
[1:10:21] wrong uh uh uh chapter my my bad you
[1:10:25] know and so verily verily I say unto
[1:10:27] thee except a man be born of water and
[1:10:31] of the spirit ain't that right so it's
[1:10:34] implying two baptisms water and spirit
[1:10:37] one is a natural baptism water baptism
[1:10:40] brother Brown said the other is a
[1:10:42] spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost of
[1:10:45] water and spirit he cannot enter into
[1:10:48] the kingdom of God
[1:10:50] ain't that right and so you it takes all
[1:10:54] three to come together amen just like
[1:10:57] you you are a individual but you're made
[1:11:00] up of three parts right Body Soul and
[1:11:02] Spirit got to have all three amen that's
[1:11:05] right and so we believe in being
[1:11:07] immersed in water brother Brown said in
[1:11:10] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to and
[1:11:12] to be raised again in newness of life to
[1:11:16] walk after the Commandments of God and
[1:11:20] so now brother Brown said he had
[1:11:22] baptized many children uh the question
[1:11:24] was asked him well have you baptized
[1:11:26] children and then re-baptized him later
[1:11:28] on he says I've done it many times and
[1:11:31] he says
[1:11:32] um uh but he said it's not essential
[1:11:35] that a person to do that and and again
[1:11:39] if you've been living that Christian
[1:11:40] life since you was at uh for that person
[1:11:44] at 13 years old he said now if you want
[1:11:47] to be baptized and I want you to listen
[1:11:49] to this he said if you want to be
[1:11:51] baptized if that's something that's
[1:11:54] standing in your way if that is
[1:11:57] something that is nagging you in the
[1:11:59] back of your mind he says and you feel
[1:12:02] you should do it then you go do it
[1:12:06] you understand what I'm saying see you
[1:12:08] go do it don't let nothing stand in your
[1:12:12] way you make yourself perfectly clear
[1:12:15] see get all whatever is there get it all
[1:12:19] clear if you feel like you need to do it
[1:12:21] do it just get it all clear right so he
[1:12:25] says now if you've taken something years
[1:12:27] ago and you feel like you should go make
[1:12:29] that right you go make that right no
[1:12:32] matter what it is you keep everything
[1:12:33] clear cause you'll come up to that thing
[1:12:37] notice that you'll come up to that thing
[1:12:40] and you can't go any further till you
[1:12:42] get that out of the way so he says you
[1:12:45] just got to lay aside every weight and
[1:12:47] the thing that so easily besets you so
[1:12:50] if there's something that is nagging you
[1:12:53] uh uh say man you know I I need to be
[1:12:56] baptized again you know uh uh maybe
[1:12:59] because of I haven't lived right or you
[1:13:02] know I've went out in the world and I've
[1:13:03] done all kinds of uh nonsense and all
[1:13:06] that and and if that's going to stop you
[1:13:08] if that's going to hinder you then then
[1:13:11] it would be best to go ahead and do it
[1:13:13] and someone said well you don't need to
[1:13:14] be baptized but if that's something that
[1:13:16] is bothering you you need to go do it
[1:13:18] you understand what I'm saying and and
[1:13:20] so
[1:13:21] um uh uh then that's what's anything
[1:13:23] again he uses even stealing if you stole
[1:13:26] something in that years later it's
[1:13:28] nagging you and he said you'll never go
[1:13:31] any further with God until you go get
[1:13:32] that right see so so there's things and
[1:13:35] that's even with unconfessed sins that's
[1:13:37] healing even people can there's a lot of
[1:13:39] times people can't get healed because
[1:13:41] there's something in there that's laying
[1:13:43] in there that they have to go get right
[1:13:45] right and so uh then then now notice
[1:13:49] then brother Brandon right after brother
[1:13:51] Branham says that he says see but you
[1:13:54] just saying that you were baptized in
[1:13:55] Christian baptism at the age of 13 and
[1:13:59] you've lived a Christian Life all the
[1:14:01] way along or if you've just or if you've
[1:14:04] backslid a few times he said said and
[1:14:07] and I want to make a point on on uh you
[1:14:11] know
[1:14:12] um uh I want to get into baptism but I
[1:14:15] also want to make a point right fast
[1:14:16] about backsliding because this person
[1:14:19] had been grown up now and and it'd been
[1:14:23] a few years since they had been baptized
[1:14:25] see and so no doubt as it is with any
[1:14:28] Christian Life you're going to make
[1:14:31] mistakes you're going to make blunders
[1:14:33] you're you're going to have your ups and
[1:14:35] downs but they lived a Christian Life
[1:14:38] all along right so so you know the uh
[1:14:44] and and so but the individual is
[1:14:46] wondering well it's been set long and
[1:14:48] and so do I need to be baptized again
[1:14:51] and and so the reason that this person
[1:14:54] was asked uh had asked this question uh
[1:14:58] and and brother Branham actually if you
[1:15:00] look it up he actually mentions this
[1:15:02] scripture that and says you were
[1:15:04] referring to this scripture and that was
[1:15:07] in Revelations 2 5 where it says
[1:15:09] remember therefore from when thou art
[1:15:11] fallen and repent and do the first works
[1:15:14] so so they they were thinking well then
[1:15:18] I need to go back and do the first works
[1:15:19] again he says do the first works or else
[1:15:22] I will come unto thee quickly and will
[1:15:25] remove thy Candlestick out of his place
[1:15:27] except thou repent but notice brother
[1:15:29] Branham addressed this scripture when
[1:15:32] answering this person's question and he
[1:15:35] says now to that scripture that you're
[1:15:36] referring to that wasn't talking about
[1:15:40] the individual
[1:15:41] he said that was to the church see what
[1:15:45] the church had done they had lost their
[1:15:48] first love the real cream that they had
[1:15:50] in the beginning and he said unless you
[1:15:53] repent and do this first works over
[1:15:55] start right back get the things see that
[1:15:58] he's talking to the church instead of an
[1:16:00] individual so so there's many things
[1:16:03] that we have to repent over as Believers
[1:16:06] as Christians we make mistakes many
[1:16:08] times we don't feel like CR being that
[1:16:10] that we're Christians many times amen we
[1:16:12] don't even feel the Lord and we wonder
[1:16:14] where he's at you understand what I'm
[1:16:16] saying many times there's there's there
[1:16:18] could be points that where you just feel
[1:16:19] like you're even lost you know and yet
[1:16:22] you you know that you you you you you
[1:16:24] you you repented uh you uh of your sins
[1:16:28] back then you you knew that the baptism
[1:16:30] was gentle uh uh uh genuine you knew
[1:16:34] that you were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:36] and yet you're you're in the swamp and
[1:16:39] and and and and and yes in them time
[1:16:41] Satan will bring up all your faults and
[1:16:42] your failures and your your unbeliefs
[1:16:44] and your this and you're that if if you
[1:16:47] haven't been there you ain't lived long
[1:16:48] enough you know what I mean we all have
[1:16:51] that but that doesn't mean that you got
[1:16:53] to go back and repent and or or do your
[1:16:56] work first works over again as he was
[1:16:59] talking to the church age can you say
[1:17:01] man sin see Christians as individuals
[1:17:04] backslide every day
[1:17:06] you believe that we backslide every day
[1:17:09] and so brother Brandon even says this
[1:17:12] here he says you backslide every day
[1:17:13] there's no way everybody say there's no
[1:17:16] way there's no way at all for you to
[1:17:19] keep out of it
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:24] now I'll take the prophet's word over
[1:17:26] anyone else's
[1:17:28] you backslide every day and there's no
[1:17:32] way at all for you to keep out of it but
[1:17:34] you backslide to the people in the
[1:17:37] church but not before God you backslide
[1:17:40] on Christ but you don't want God see
[1:17:44] because when you're uh see when you sin
[1:17:47] he says because if you when you sin
[1:17:51] you're gone
[1:17:52] but you constantly you're constantly
[1:17:55] falling Paul had to die every day is
[1:17:59] that right he had to die every day
[1:18:01] repent every day and just constantly
[1:18:04] repenting all the time and if Paul had
[1:18:07] to do that then I'm going to have to do
[1:18:09] do that as well he says and all of us
[1:18:12] will have to do that Holy ghost-filled
[1:18:15] Believers have to do that
[1:18:18] ain't that right so now brother Branham
[1:18:21] a few years later from from that
[1:18:23] statement he shows what backsliding is
[1:18:26] he said temporarily everybody say
[1:18:29] temporarily
[1:18:30] and keep that in mind
[1:18:33] temporarily
[1:18:34] minor every one of us backslide many
[1:18:39] times a day
[1:18:40] we know that we're all guilty every one
[1:18:43] of us there's not there's none of us
[1:18:45] perfected perfected yeah and as long as
[1:18:48] we're in this body see we are still he
[1:18:51] says no matter how much people try to
[1:18:52] tell you well I've got I've been
[1:18:54] Sanctified I can go kiss that woman and
[1:18:57] do this and he's he's lying
[1:19:00] he cannot
[1:19:03] brother random talked about Holy Ghost
[1:19:04] people he told all of those people don't
[1:19:06] rub up you know he said you a man
[1:19:09] rubbing up against another woman
[1:19:11] it brings strange feelings
[1:19:15] that's why we we don't hug
[1:19:18] hello
[1:19:20] we don't do them things a holy
[1:19:22] ghost-filled man still has human
[1:19:25] elements
[1:19:28] ain't that right
[1:19:29] so if he's telling you well I'm
[1:19:31] Sanctified so I can go kiss that woman
[1:19:37] he needs that lust devil cast out
[1:19:40] bro Graham said he's lying
[1:19:43] see and he cannot he's that's all now he
[1:19:46] says now see I don't tried to say now
[1:19:50] brother Brian tell me about his life and
[1:19:51] it goes for all of it I don't try to say
[1:19:53] Lord let me see how close I can go
[1:19:56] it's Lord keep me as far as away as I
[1:20:00] can get keep me far away as I can get
[1:20:03] right just stay as far away remember you
[1:20:08] are still human beings
[1:20:12] is that right so now if you make a
[1:20:15] mistake and this little message if you
[1:20:18] make a mistake or do something wrong you
[1:20:20] won't do it willfully
[1:20:24] for you are a Christian
[1:20:27] and you say man and if you're a
[1:20:30] born-again Christian said you don't mean
[1:20:33] to do wrong
[1:20:35] so this this this person asking do I
[1:20:39] need to be baptized all over again I was
[1:20:41] baptized 13. well maybe she was looking
[1:20:43] at that scripture do the first works
[1:20:46] over again repent
[1:20:48] and she was looking at it as well I have
[1:20:50] made blunders but but she wasn't one
[1:20:53] that would go out in the world and
[1:20:54] drinking and out in the bars
[1:20:57] she wasn't one out there uh uh sleeping
[1:21:00] with all the men and acting like this
[1:21:01] and then coming back and getting saved
[1:21:03] and and giving her heart and said well I
[1:21:04] was baptized uh uh when I was 13. and so
[1:21:08] do I need to be baptized again bro Brown
[1:21:10] said if you've been a Christian all
[1:21:11] along then you don't need to be if
[1:21:15] you've gotten a Holy Ghost and and and
[1:21:17] and and God has approved of Your Action
[1:21:20] because remember the Holy Ghost is God
[1:21:22] approving of you
[1:21:26] right
[1:21:27] the Holy Ghost see see when you you get
[1:21:30] you repent you get baptized and God
[1:21:35] approves of it
[1:21:37] by giving you the seal a circumcision
[1:21:40] see so so again back to being mistakes
[1:21:44] Born Again believers do wrong but they
[1:21:49] don't mean to do wrong
[1:21:51] so brother Brown said your intentions
[1:21:53] and everything is right so here another
[1:21:56] place said if you do anything wrong it
[1:21:59] don't condemn you and you go on like
[1:22:01] that then remember you wasn't saved at
[1:22:04] the beginning
[1:22:06] there there there's there's you know
[1:22:08] preachers that have have committed
[1:22:11] adultery and slept with women you know
[1:22:13] and even have a child buyer living like
[1:22:16] that for 10 years and then want to get
[1:22:18] back into church and get behind the
[1:22:20] pulpit
[1:22:21] you can't do that
[1:22:26] at least that's my thoughts on it you
[1:22:28] can't
[1:22:29] and and and and I I don't think he had
[1:22:33] the Holy Ghost I don't think them type
[1:22:35] of people have the Holy Ghost to live
[1:22:37] out there so long and to do them things
[1:22:44] amen
[1:22:45] so so we find that that I you know we're
[1:22:50] all going to make mistakes
[1:22:52] but but for me to go to to pick up a uh
[1:22:55] uh uh go get a bottle of whiskey
[1:22:59] and and and keeping that in my life
[1:23:03] I don't think that's the type of
[1:23:04] mistakes that brother brandeman's
[1:23:06] talking about
[1:23:08] so I'm just trying to make that clear to
[1:23:10] us all that that there there is that
[1:23:14] that that that yes you you do have to
[1:23:16] repent but I I believe the Holy Ghost
[1:23:19] Keeps Us
[1:23:20] from acting like the world and bringing
[1:23:23] shame on the name of Jesus Christ
[1:23:26] in that way
[1:23:29] so now notice again brother random said
[1:23:32] see you wasn't saved if if you do
[1:23:35] anything wrong and it don't condemn you
[1:23:37] and you go one like that one out
[1:23:40] remember you wasn't saved at the
[1:23:41] beginning that's right you wasn't saved
[1:23:44] and you just had a make-believe you
[1:23:47] wasn't safe but when you're saved you
[1:23:48] have a different spirit
[1:23:50] you're a different nature you're a new
[1:23:53] creature in Christ and the old things
[1:23:56] have passed away and they are dead and
[1:23:58] buried in the sea of forgetfulness you
[1:24:01] see but you're living here in the world
[1:24:04] here there's traps set for you
[1:24:07] everywhere and you're walking with your
[1:24:09] eyes on Christ and remember that when
[1:24:12] you make a mistake a real Christian will
[1:24:14] always come back quickly for
[1:24:16] reconciliation
[1:24:19] ain't that right so our our repentance
[1:24:22] at the beginning is a repentance of a
[1:24:26] sinner
[1:24:27] it it's it's repentance of a sinner now
[1:24:31] uh uh but then you go John 1 and and
[1:24:34] first John 2 and 1. my little children
[1:24:38] these things I write unto you that you
[1:24:41] sin not now who is he talking to first
[1:24:43] of all he's not talking to Sinners he's
[1:24:46] talking to believers he said my little
[1:24:49] children I write unto you right so he
[1:24:52] says that you sin not and if any if I
[1:24:55] say if any man sin in other words if any
[1:24:59] of you my little children sin we have an
[1:25:03] advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[1:25:05] the righteous
[1:25:06] now John is talking to people that's
[1:25:08] received the Holy Ghost
[1:25:10] and he's telling them now we we we we
[1:25:12] have a new walk we we have a different
[1:25:16] nature we're not to sin we're not to
[1:25:18] willfully go out there and do all that
[1:25:20] stuff but if you do sin
[1:25:23] tell that little white lie
[1:25:26] right
[1:25:27] getting a spat getting an argument
[1:25:30] whatever and if you do sin we have an
[1:25:34] advocate ain't that right so what we
[1:25:36] find here is Christians sin
[1:25:40] right
[1:25:42] it's what the prophet said Christians
[1:25:44] sin
[1:25:45] Sinners don't sin
[1:25:48] why why doesn't Sinners sin he said
[1:25:51] Christians sin but a sinner cannot sin a
[1:25:54] sinner doesn't sin because he's a sinner
[1:26:00] he's just a sinner to begin with that's
[1:26:02] all here take the back of the book you
[1:26:05] know we could even use this it's black
[1:26:07] see well how much of that is black
[1:26:11] it's all black right so so see there's
[1:26:15] just no white to it it's black you you
[1:26:18] say well this much here no it ain't it's
[1:26:20] it's the whole thing's black it's all
[1:26:23] black that's the way a sinner is he's
[1:26:25] just condemned to start with well you
[1:26:28] say well what about if he commits
[1:26:29] adultery if he refers to some woman if
[1:26:31] he gambles if he shoots somebody that's
[1:26:33] none of our business we got laws down
[1:26:36] here to take care of that we're not
[1:26:37] reformers we're preachers of the Gospel
[1:26:40] so we don't condemn him for what he done
[1:26:44] we don't condemn him for committing the
[1:26:46] adultery we don't condemn him because
[1:26:49] he's a sinner
[1:26:50] them things are expected of him
[1:26:56] if he was a Christian he wouldn't do
[1:26:59] that
[1:27:00] that's right you see if he's been
[1:27:02] changed he won't do that but because
[1:27:05] he's a sinner that's what makes him do
[1:27:07] that so Christians make temporary minor
[1:27:10] mistakes every day
[1:27:13] every day ain't that right but I don't
[1:27:16] believe that a a real true Holy Ghost
[1:27:19] filled believer a man is going to act
[1:27:21] like the world and indulge in the putrid
[1:27:23] things of the world and be at home
[1:27:26] with all of that and you say man
[1:27:30] so we we find again that because baptism
[1:27:34] uh is something that is a natural act
[1:27:37] that we do many people baptize get
[1:27:40] baptized and it does nothing for them
[1:27:43] simply because either they're pressured
[1:27:45] into it many get baptized because
[1:27:47] they've heard it's the right thing to do
[1:27:48] it so they ought to do it their friends
[1:27:50] got it and I'm going to do it and other
[1:27:52] kids other people get baptized without
[1:27:54] truly being repentant and and these
[1:27:57] things and and uh um so so there's all
[1:28:01] kinds but I do want to say this water
[1:28:03] doesn't save a man
[1:28:06] water does not save save man sister
[1:28:09] rayanna coming into the water today
[1:28:10] that's not going to save her
[1:28:13] you with me
[1:28:15] see brother Brown said we're not
[1:28:17] baptized taking this baptism unto
[1:28:20] regeneration and the word regeneration
[1:28:23] is rebirth or restored so now there are
[1:28:26] people that believe that that when you
[1:28:28] get baptized you're doing it for
[1:28:30] regeneration for a rebirth but it
[1:28:33] doesn't
[1:28:35] but if if brother Brown said if we are
[1:28:38] if we baptize unto regeneration then we
[1:28:42] don't need the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:28:44] then we'll stick with the water
[1:28:47] but but that's that it takes the blood
[1:28:50] of Jesus Christ
[1:28:52] can you say Amen see so then with the
[1:28:56] baptism must be based off
[1:29:00] of our repentance to God
[1:29:04] that's what it's based off of to show
[1:29:07] our repentance was genuine it's a
[1:29:10] outward display that regeneration has
[1:29:13] taken place
[1:29:15] and you say amen and we repent why do we
[1:29:19] repent we repent Believing on the
[1:29:22] finished work of Jesus Christ
[1:29:25] he is our substitute he's the one that
[1:29:28] died for us he is the one that Rose for
[1:29:31] us he is the one that took our place
[1:29:34] ain't that right so we repent based upon
[1:29:37] what he has done
[1:29:40] not on what we do and and notice what
[1:29:43] does repentance mean it means to turn
[1:29:46] from
[1:29:47] turn from and and repentance is a Godly
[1:29:51] sorrow everybody say Godly sorrow
[1:29:54] Godly sorrow there's people that that
[1:29:57] are sorry because they got caught
[1:30:00] but then there are people that repent of
[1:30:02] a Godly Resort a Godly sorrow there's
[1:30:06] people that repent because they're
[1:30:07] afraid to go to hell
[1:30:10] you don't repent because you're afraid
[1:30:12] to go to hell
[1:30:15] so second Corinthians 7 and 9 it says
[1:30:18] now I Rejoice not that you were made
[1:30:21] sorrow but or sorry but that you sorrow
[1:30:25] to repentance
[1:30:27] for you were made sorry after a Godly
[1:30:31] manner
[1:30:33] that you might receive damage by us in
[1:30:36] nothing
[1:30:37] is that right for Godly sorrow worketh
[1:30:41] repentance to Salvation not to be
[1:30:45] repented of
[1:30:46] but the sorrow of the world worketh
[1:30:49] death
[1:30:51] ain't that right so Godly sorrow cometh
[1:30:54] by conviction you know there's a
[1:30:58] difference in conviction and
[1:30:59] condemnation if God ever convicts you it
[1:31:02] will not be a a condemnation to you
[1:31:07] ain't that right amen you know
[1:31:10] condemnation Works death
[1:31:12] conviction Works life
[1:31:14] conviction brings you to repentance
[1:31:16] condemnation makes you hide things
[1:31:19] you're doing it out of fear you're doing
[1:31:21] it out of out of you know uh uh well
[1:31:24] condemnation
[1:31:26] and and so Godly sorrow comes by
[1:31:29] conviction with which works which works
[1:31:32] repentance and only God can bring
[1:31:36] conviction
[1:31:37] now he'll use the preacher to preach
[1:31:39] something that you need to bring that
[1:31:41] conviction
[1:31:42] that I cannot bring that conviction upon
[1:31:45] you
[1:31:46] if I ever tried to bring the conviction
[1:31:48] it actually will work to condemnation
[1:31:52] and a lot of a lot of preachers have
[1:31:54] tried to do that especially your
[1:31:56] legalists that have tried to get the
[1:31:58] people straightened out
[1:32:00] and it just brings condemnation
[1:32:03] but when God deals with the individual
[1:32:06] it brings conviction
[1:32:09] ain't that right that's why we need the
[1:32:12] spirit of God in the churches today
[1:32:14] so now the sorrow of the world comes by
[1:32:16] condemnation which works death ain't
[1:32:19] that right I've thought about this
[1:32:21] repentance and and you know that that
[1:32:23] woman that that prostitute that washed
[1:32:26] Jesus's feet you realize she had nothing
[1:32:28] to wash his feet with
[1:32:30] wow you know what she washed his feet
[1:32:32] with
[1:32:33] tears of repentance
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:37] and brother Branham said that as she
[1:32:39] with them tears of repentance she's
[1:32:42] crying out unto him and the tears just
[1:32:46] dropping
[1:32:48] washing his feet he said she was washing
[1:32:51] the reproach from him and bearing his
[1:32:55] reproach
[1:32:58] tears of repentance mean a lot
[1:33:02] that's why brother Brandon was against
[1:33:04] these dry-eyed confessions
[1:33:07] can you say Amen
[1:33:09] tears of repentance
[1:33:11] and so if if a man is truly repentant in
[1:33:16] his heart notice what happens God will
[1:33:18] give him the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:21] don't you worry he will
[1:33:24] he will you say man I don't think you
[1:33:27] have to beat an altar to get the Holy
[1:33:29] Ghost
[1:33:29] I don't think you have to pray and fast
[1:33:32] and pray and fast and tarry and wait and
[1:33:34] Terry to get the Holy Ghost
[1:33:39] amen
[1:33:40] now brother Brahm says I don't believe
[1:33:42] that there's any man or woman in any of
[1:33:45] the groups could ever face Jesus Christ
[1:33:47] and truly repent of their sins with a
[1:33:49] truthful surrendered heart saying Lord I
[1:33:51] truly believe but what God would place
[1:33:54] on them the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:56] right at that time
[1:33:58] so to to to to to beg God to sink and
[1:34:01] that was the Pentecostal thought was
[1:34:04] that you had to get at an altar and you
[1:34:06] had to stay there and and plead and beg
[1:34:09] and cry and and all that for you get the
[1:34:11] Holy Ghost I think a moment a person
[1:34:14] truly believes and truly repents in
[1:34:16] their heart God will give them the
[1:34:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:21] now you know and that's what the prophet
[1:34:23] says now I I you know I know there's
[1:34:26] other times that people get the Holy
[1:34:27] Ghost in different times so I'm not
[1:34:29] saying that but I'm I am just telling
[1:34:31] you God will give it to you
[1:34:32] God's more than able to it ain't God
[1:34:35] it's us
[1:34:39] so according to acts 10 47 a person can
[1:34:42] receive the Holy Ghost before they are
[1:34:44] baptized
[1:34:46] Peter said unto them can any man forbid
[1:34:48] water that these should not be baptized
[1:34:50] which have received the Holy Ghost as
[1:34:53] well as we ain't that right brother
[1:34:55] Brian said that's the apostolic way God
[1:34:57] had no set rule when the heart is hungry
[1:35:01] he will give you what you're hungering
[1:35:03] for if you want the Holy Ghost it can
[1:35:06] fall on you right now yeah
[1:35:09] he says it's the condition of the heart
[1:35:12] if a man's hungering and his heart is
[1:35:14] right God will give it to him
[1:35:17] you don't have to sit there and have a
[1:35:18] week of Revival you don't even have to
[1:35:20] go through a prayer line to get it
[1:35:22] that's right you can get the Holy Ghost
[1:35:23] right in your pew
[1:35:26] that's the God we serve because it's the
[1:35:28] condition of your heart it's it has
[1:35:30] nothing to do with rituals and forms
[1:35:34] you understand what I'm saying
[1:35:36] see we make it all about rituals and
[1:35:38] form but God doesn't
[1:35:40] that's right see so the Bible tells us
[1:35:44] that if you notice Peter stayed with
[1:35:46] them people
[1:35:49] until they were baptized in Jesus name
[1:35:52] he stayed with them they had already
[1:35:54] received the Holy Ghost
[1:35:56] they didn't leave them say okay you got
[1:35:58] the Holy Ghost now let's go
[1:36:00] see ya he stayed with them until they
[1:36:02] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost one
[1:36:04] other place I I ain't got it here but
[1:36:06] brother Brown said God gives you all the
[1:36:08] ghost because he knows you'll get
[1:36:09] baptized
[1:36:11] he already knows it's in your heart it's
[1:36:13] it's something there
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:18] now
[1:36:19] did you notice though that anyone in the
[1:36:22] New Testament that was baptized outside
[1:36:25] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:27] had to be re-baptized in the name of
[1:36:30] Jesus Christ
[1:36:31] before they received the Holy Ghost
[1:36:35] if they had been baptized in titles or
[1:36:39] in the name of well in in this case it
[1:36:42] was John
[1:36:43] they were baptized under repentance
[1:36:45] under John's baptism
[1:36:48] and they wanted the Holy Ghost
[1:36:52] or or they they were talking I I think
[1:36:55] it was to Paul and he said have you
[1:36:57] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:36:58] believed and they said well we didn't
[1:37:00] even know he said well then what was you
[1:37:02] baptized under
[1:37:04] well under John
[1:37:06] well then he began to preach unto them
[1:37:08] the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:37:12] and they got baptized and then they got
[1:37:14] the Holy Ghost
[1:37:18] now brother Graham said see when they
[1:37:19] found people that had been immersed some
[1:37:22] other way besides the name of Jesus
[1:37:24] Christ they were commanded to be
[1:37:26] baptized over again in the name of Jesus
[1:37:29] Christ before they could receive the
[1:37:31] Holy Ghost
[1:37:32] see those who were baptized different
[1:37:35] had to come and be re-baptized to get
[1:37:38] the Holy Ghost
[1:37:41] in other words God ain't going to bless
[1:37:43] a trinity baptism
[1:37:47] is ain't gonna do it
[1:37:48] now I want to go more into baptism right
[1:37:51] fast as into why baptism is important of
[1:37:55] course bad water baptism is a
[1:37:57] commemoration of the death burial and
[1:37:58] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:38:01] and it it's how a a person becomes
[1:38:06] identified with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:09] and and all of us want to be identified
[1:38:12] and and and most of us I believe here
[1:38:15] have been identified in this way brother
[1:38:19] Brown said it is an outward expression
[1:38:22] that an inward work of Grace has been
[1:38:25] done
[1:38:26] ain't that right so now we're not like a
[1:38:28] Baptist I believe one saved always saved
[1:38:31] and you can go do anything I had you
[1:38:33] know as a kid you know we lived among
[1:38:36] the Cherokees and and and and Cherokees
[1:38:38] they believed the moment you were born a
[1:38:41] Cherokee you're Baptist you know and and
[1:38:44] so a lot of them been been baptized and
[1:38:47] all that but man
[1:38:49] they were raunchy
[1:38:51] Cass
[1:38:52] well I even went to a church where the
[1:38:54] preacher smoked I I I I so remember that
[1:38:58] I I was with some my friends and his
[1:39:00] family my friend and his family
[1:39:03] Church going on I mean right in the
[1:39:05] middle of service everybody just stops
[1:39:07] stops leaves the leaves the place and
[1:39:11] it's just me and his family
[1:39:15] now look at Mike I said what just
[1:39:17] happened and why aren't we going
[1:39:20] he said oh they'll all be backs is
[1:39:22] they're taking a smoke break
[1:39:24] I'm like you got to be kidding
[1:39:26] I said is the preacher out there too he
[1:39:28] said yeah
[1:39:30] I said okay
[1:39:32] anyway
[1:39:34] but that's their ID there is if you get
[1:39:37] baptized or saved one's always saved you
[1:39:40] know and they listen to rock and roll
[1:39:42] because I mean they were some vulgar
[1:39:46] guys you know and uh uh I've really felt
[1:39:51] sorry for him
[1:39:52] but so you you find though that
[1:39:56] baptism is an expression only to show
[1:40:00] that an inward work of Grace has been
[1:40:02] done
[1:40:04] see so see we we that are watching
[1:40:06] cannot see what God has done in you not
[1:40:09] on the inside
[1:40:11] but see we we find out see when I got
[1:40:14] baptized you know I was telling the
[1:40:16] people I'm I'm saved God done something
[1:40:19] for me
[1:40:21] well they couldn't look at the heart and
[1:40:22] see what changed because it was a
[1:40:24] spiritual thing that changed and so they
[1:40:26] couldn't go take X-rays
[1:40:30] but I would got baptized I wanted to let
[1:40:33] them people know that I've been
[1:40:34] identified with Jesus Christ
[1:40:36] his death burial and Resurrection was
[1:40:39] for me
[1:40:41] I was buried with I died with him I was
[1:40:44] buried with him I'm gonna rise with him
[1:40:48] talk in his life now
[1:40:51] he's the one smart representing me so it
[1:40:54] was an outward expression to let them
[1:40:57] know that God had done something for me
[1:40:59] so baptism what is baptism it's a burial
[1:41:03] ground
[1:41:04] yeah
[1:41:05] for a believer
[1:41:07] it's a burial ground
[1:41:09] because why it's the death Burl of uh
[1:41:13] death and Barrel of of your old nature
[1:41:17] the old you has got to die and rot Paul
[1:41:21] would even say I am crucified with
[1:41:24] Christ
[1:41:25] ain't that right you died yeah uh uh no
[1:41:30] more of the world no more of these
[1:41:32] things and so you you've repented with
[1:41:35] that Godly sorrow
[1:41:37] and remember that that repentance is
[1:41:40] genuine that won't last just for a week
[1:41:44] it only lasts for a month
[1:41:47] you you sold it all out to him
[1:41:53] ain't that right
[1:41:54] and the old man is crucified with Christ
[1:41:59] see you remember Abel in the Old
[1:42:01] Testament when he died who did he die
[1:42:05] with
[1:42:06] he died with his lamb
[1:42:09] ain't that right and we've got to die
[1:42:12] with our lamb
[1:42:14] yeah your lamb died and and you can't
[1:42:17] remain alive and serve him
[1:42:20] amen Abel was a type of us that we've
[1:42:22] got to die with our lamb
[1:42:25] ain't that right
[1:42:26] that lamb was his sacrifice to God that
[1:42:30] lamb was his propitiation and so is our
[1:42:34] lamb today that's our sacrifice and if
[1:42:37] he would die with the natural lamb we
[1:42:39] ought to die with harlam which is the
[1:42:41] true land
[1:42:42] we want to have identified with him not
[1:42:45] with the world
[1:42:47] you know how people get especially young
[1:42:49] people get identified with the world as
[1:42:51] they start going with the trend of the
[1:42:53] world
[1:42:54] when Hollywood starts coming out with
[1:42:55] these skinny jeans boys start taking on
[1:42:57] the skinny jeans what are they it's an
[1:42:59] identification when they start having
[1:43:01] these weird haircuts well everybody else
[1:43:03] got to go get the weird haircut it's an
[1:43:05] identification what is it they're of the
[1:43:08] world it's the spirit of the world they
[1:43:10] everybody starts painting their hair
[1:43:12] green blue red could you imagine going
[1:43:14] to bed with such a thing as that
[1:43:17] and call that beautiful
[1:43:19] I think that I think it would stop right
[1:43:21] there I'd quit saying honey you're
[1:43:23] beautiful
[1:43:25] I I mean that's me you look like where's
[1:43:27] the circus
[1:43:30] when did we join
[1:43:33] but but but but see they're doing it
[1:43:36] because they're identifying with
[1:43:37] something
[1:43:39] true everybody getting tattoos today
[1:43:41] used to when I was a kid it was it was a
[1:43:45] it was a filthy thing to get tattoos
[1:43:48] I'm serious it was just scum
[1:43:51] but everybody's doing it and and it's
[1:43:53] not just a little thing on the ankle or
[1:43:55] there is it's everywhere
[1:43:58] and they call it beautiful
[1:44:02] but why do they do it to identify
[1:44:08] well see we want to do something to God
[1:44:10] to be identified with him
[1:44:12] and the prophet said what is that
[1:44:14] baptism
[1:44:16] I want there should be no shame to be
[1:44:19] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:22] Christ if they can do what they're doing
[1:44:25] and they say that's natural then it's
[1:44:28] natural for me as a Believer to do
[1:44:31] something that I can show that I'm
[1:44:33] identified with his death burial and
[1:44:35] Resurrection
[1:44:38] hate that Ryan so we baptized brother
[1:44:40] Brown said we go down in the water amen
[1:44:43] and come back up to witness that we
[1:44:46] believe in the death burial and
[1:44:47] resurrection of Jesus Christ he died I
[1:44:50] died he was buried I was buried he rose
[1:44:52] High Rolls
[1:44:54] Hallelujah and God recognizes them
[1:44:58] things you realize that it may be just
[1:45:01] some little simple thing going in the
[1:45:02] world that God Of Heaven recognizes that
[1:45:05] that little simple thing will so
[1:45:08] recognize that before God he'll fill you
[1:45:10] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:12] everything else the world wants to be
[1:45:14] recognized the president doesn't
[1:45:15] recognize all the all the the the
[1:45:17] druggies out here
[1:45:19] the president all the high UPS doesn't
[1:45:22] recognize all of these things as an
[1:45:24] individual but let a Believer amen go
[1:45:27] down into that water death burial and
[1:45:29] Resurrection in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:45:31] and the fairy god of heaven will
[1:45:33] recognize you as an individual as one of
[1:45:35] his
[1:45:40] people identifying with things that are
[1:45:42] so empty in their soul
[1:45:44] but God will make sure you're not empty
[1:45:47] he'll fill you up
[1:45:50] why you're identifying yourself with him
[1:45:53] Romans 6 3
[1:45:55] Paul says know ye not that so many of us
[1:45:58] as were baptized into Jesus Christ were
[1:46:00] baptized into his death
[1:46:03] therefore we are buried with him by
[1:46:05] baptism into death
[1:46:08] that like as Christ was raised up from
[1:46:10] the dead by the glory of the father even
[1:46:12] so we also should walk in newness of
[1:46:15] life for if we have been planted
[1:46:18] together in the likeness of his death
[1:46:20] say you you in the likeness of his death
[1:46:23] that that and he keeps bringing that
[1:46:25] point out
[1:46:27] because no one wants to die
[1:46:29] but see in the likeness of his death we
[1:46:31] shall also be in the likeness of his
[1:46:34] resurrection knowing this that our old
[1:46:37] man is crucified with him that's what
[1:46:40] happened when you repented with a
[1:46:42] genuine Godly sorrow you died right
[1:46:45] there at that altar with your lamb ain't
[1:46:48] that right see and so he says see uh uh
[1:46:52] knowing this our old man is crucified
[1:46:54] with him that the body of sin might be
[1:46:57] destroyed you realize that once God
[1:47:00] fills you with the Holy Ghost and again
[1:47:02] there's that three repent be baptized be
[1:47:04] filled with Holy Ghost once you are
[1:47:07] sealed with that you'll never stand
[1:47:09] before God is a sinner again
[1:47:11] you'll that's why you cannot go through
[1:47:13] the tribulation you've already bypassed
[1:47:15] death
[1:47:17] ain't that right you went from Death
[1:47:19] unto life
[1:47:20] now you can never be condemned before
[1:47:23] God there it you died with your lamb
[1:47:26] that lamb is standing as a token for you
[1:47:28] today
[1:47:31] you cannot sin you may fall you may make
[1:47:34] mistakes but there's always an atonement
[1:47:36] for you that when God looks at you he
[1:47:39] cannot see you he sees the the lamb your
[1:47:41] sacrifice he can hear your voice that he
[1:47:44] doesn't see the sacrament or he doesn't
[1:47:46] see you he sees his sacrifice
[1:47:49] ain't that right see so the old man is
[1:47:53] crucified with him our lamb a man and
[1:47:56] the bot that the body of sin might be
[1:47:58] destroyed you see that I got faults it's
[1:48:00] already destroyed
[1:48:03] he's already told us you're a human
[1:48:04] you've got human element amen and that
[1:48:07] but that there's something that God has
[1:48:09] done for you that you'll never be a
[1:48:12] sinner in his sight again
[1:48:15] I hope that makes sense to you
[1:48:18] Lord notice the body of sin might be
[1:48:20] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[1:48:22] serve sin
[1:48:26] for he that is dead is free from sin
[1:48:31] coming's free
[1:48:34] he that's dead is free from sin
[1:48:38] God have mercy it has shut the accuser's
[1:48:42] mouth
[1:48:42] [Music]
[1:48:43] hmm
[1:48:46] now if we be dead with Christ Our lamb
[1:48:49] we believe that we shall also live with
[1:48:51] him
[1:48:52] because now now Abel's lamb he died with
[1:48:55] his lamb but that lamb didn't rise
[1:48:58] ain't that right it had to be a greater
[1:49:01] lamb for Abel to rise
[1:49:03] and that lamb did come
[1:49:05] amen and brought forth a resurrection
[1:49:08] and when that lamb rose from the dead
[1:49:10] all the Old Testament Saints rose with
[1:49:13] him and even Abel rose with the lamb can
[1:49:17] you say Amen now if we have been buried
[1:49:20] with if we died with him we're buried
[1:49:22] with him then and we sold that we come
[1:49:24] out of that water that now we're risen
[1:49:27] with him don't you worry amen you're
[1:49:30] going to be around have that
[1:49:31] Resurrection Life in you if you go by
[1:49:33] the way of a natural grave you will rise
[1:49:35] again if you don't go by that way
[1:49:37] there's a resurrection life that's in
[1:49:40] you that'll change your mortal body
[1:49:43] I'm so glad for that
[1:49:45] why because we're not dying with the
[1:49:47] natural lamb like Abel there's another
[1:49:50] land
[1:49:52] ain't that right
[1:49:54] so see if we Dead with him if we'd be
[1:49:57] dead with him we believe that we shall
[1:49:58] also live with him knowing everybody say
[1:50:01] knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:50:04] the death dieth no more
[1:50:07] man
[1:50:08] knowing
[1:50:09] that Christ's been raised from the dead
[1:50:12] doeth no more that's why you can never
[1:50:13] die
[1:50:15] can you say man for him that he died he
[1:50:19] died unto sin once amen but in that he
[1:50:23] liveth he liveth unto God
[1:50:26] ain't that right that's why we want to
[1:50:28] be identified with him we want to be
[1:50:30] identified with his power we want to be
[1:50:33] identified with his life you can't be a
[1:50:36] Christian without him
[1:50:38] I want to be so identified with him that
[1:50:41] they can't tell me apart I want to be
[1:50:43] identified with his blood amen that the
[1:50:46] sinner has lost his accusations
[1:50:49] that where the devil can't even accuse
[1:50:51] me
[1:50:52] I'm identified with him and if I can be
[1:50:55] identified in that desk and that burial
[1:50:57] I'll be identified in him with him in
[1:51:00] the resurrection
[1:51:01] and he can no longer die I can no longer
[1:51:05] die
[1:51:06] if he comes today he cannot die again
[1:51:08] there's no need for him to die again
[1:51:11] oh my well that's the same thing if if
[1:51:14] he would do that once for all remember
[1:51:17] that the sacrifice of Christ had
[1:51:20] perfected them once for all
[1:51:22] he don't need to come and die again and
[1:51:25] if you were identified with him in that
[1:51:27] death burial and Resurrection you can
[1:51:29] never die again
[1:51:30] now that's exciting don't let the devil
[1:51:33] condemn you
[1:51:35] don't listen to them lies again
[1:51:41] that's what it means to have the Holy
[1:51:42] Ghost
[1:51:44] ain't that right
[1:51:46] likewise wrecking yourself also dead to
[1:51:48] be dead undeed indeed unto sin but alive
[1:51:52] unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:51:54] let not sin ever I say let not sin
[1:51:57] therefore reign in your mortal body
[1:51:59] that you should obey it in the lust
[1:52:01] thereof
[1:52:03] so brother Brown said be buried in water
[1:52:05] to rise to newness of life
[1:52:07] newness of life
[1:52:09] so that that that simple Act of being
[1:52:12] baptized has a lot of meaning to God
[1:52:16] and to us now buried this why we don't
[1:52:20] sprinkle a little water on a person
[1:52:22] because it's a barrel you you you you
[1:52:24] you're gonna you're gonna take a dead
[1:52:27] person sprinkle dirt
[1:52:30] say okay he's died so let's get a little
[1:52:33] dirt
[1:52:34] [Music]
[1:52:35] it's done
[1:52:37] no you bury him
[1:52:40] now people that don't understand that
[1:52:42] there's a lot of denominations that just
[1:52:44] sprinkle
[1:52:45] I don't know why but they just
[1:52:49] I want to be buried
[1:52:51] give me some deep water
[1:52:54] I want every part of me
[1:52:56] I want to be buried
[1:52:59] I don't want a fingernail showing I want
[1:53:01] I want to be buried
[1:53:04] ain't that right
[1:53:06] amen see our lord Jesus was completely
[1:53:09] sealed away
[1:53:10] buried
[1:53:12] and baptism means submersion uh
[1:53:16] immersion emergence to dip to plunge to
[1:53:20] drench
[1:53:21] is used by the Greeks to signify the
[1:53:24] dying of a garment
[1:53:26] uh or or the drawing of Water by dipping
[1:53:30] a vessel into another
[1:53:33] see so we are baptized again and I'm I'm
[1:53:36] not going to take much longer but we are
[1:53:39] baptized for the remission of our sins
[1:53:41] and that word remit is to forgive or to
[1:53:44] take away
[1:53:46] and and so
[1:53:48] uh uh John 20 and 23 whosoever sends you
[1:53:52] remit he's talking to the church they
[1:53:55] are remitted unto them and whosoever
[1:53:56] sins you retain they are retained
[1:53:59] and actually this is the part of the
[1:54:02] greater that Jesus said that we would do
[1:54:05] and that's imparting eternal life to
[1:54:07] others
[1:54:08] and brother Brown says now here's where
[1:54:10] the Catholic church and many of the
[1:54:11] others made their big mistake they go
[1:54:13] out and say I forgive your sins but
[1:54:15] that's not what Jesus was talking about
[1:54:19] how did they get sins forgiven in the
[1:54:21] Bible how did they do it Peter answered
[1:54:25] their question on the day of Pentecost
[1:54:27] they said what can we do to be saved how
[1:54:29] can we get this that you all got he laid
[1:54:32] down the prescription and told them what
[1:54:34] to do repent every one of you towards
[1:54:36] God be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:54:38] Christ for what the remission of sins
[1:54:40] there's the Greater Works
[1:54:43] can you say man and only the word can
[1:54:46] forgive sins
[1:54:47] and this is what we are bringing to you
[1:54:49] is the word formula
[1:54:52] ain't that right on how to have your
[1:54:54] sins repented now you say well I I I
[1:54:57] have repented and yet yet to be re
[1:55:00] refused to be baptized in the name of
[1:55:02] the Lord Jesus Christ then your sins
[1:55:05] haven't been remitted yet
[1:55:10] hello
[1:55:11] now again we don't baptize for
[1:55:13] regeneration as some other churches a
[1:55:16] man or yeah some denominations or
[1:55:18] whatever do Hebrews 9 22 without the
[1:55:21] shedding of blood there's no remission
[1:55:23] of sins
[1:55:24] there's no remission ain't that right so
[1:55:27] baptism will not work unless you have
[1:55:29] thoroughly repented of your sins repent
[1:55:32] be baptized for the remission of sins
[1:55:35] and sins will never be remitted through
[1:55:39] titles
[1:55:42] can you say Amen remember the formula be
[1:55:46] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:55:50] that's right you love him
[1:55:52] amen he said if you want to be saved
[1:55:54] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:55:56] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:55:57] that's how they're remitted
[1:56:00] amen so why do we baptize in the name of
[1:56:05] Jesus Christ
[1:56:06] I'm going to go through this quickly
[1:56:08] I'll cut some of it off because I got a
[1:56:10] lot going to go
[1:56:11] first of all that's how Jesus taught us
[1:56:13] to baptize
[1:56:15] if you go back Matthew 28 19.
[1:56:18] Jesus said go ye therefore and teach All
[1:56:20] Nations baptizing them everybody say
[1:56:23] baptizing them
[1:56:25] in the name
[1:56:27] of father
[1:56:30] son
[1:56:31] and the Holy Ghost
[1:56:33] now I'll say that right the father
[1:56:36] the son the Holy Ghost right that note
[1:56:40] is baptizing them in the name so he
[1:56:43] didn't say baptize them in names plural
[1:56:46] baptize them in the name singular ain't
[1:56:51] that right so never has the word names
[1:56:56] being in the Bible when it comes to
[1:56:59] reference to God
[1:57:01] it's always been name
[1:57:04] singular
[1:57:06] as
[1:57:08] when it comes to God name can you say
[1:57:12] man man is the one that makes the word
[1:57:15] names plural as though it's plural ain't
[1:57:20] that right because they believe there
[1:57:21] are three Gods Mark 12 32 tells us there
[1:57:24] is one God and there is none other but
[1:57:26] he
[1:57:27] Ephesians 4 6 tells us that there is one
[1:57:30] God and Father of all
[1:57:32] First Timothy 2 and 5 tells us there is
[1:57:35] one God and one mediator between God and
[1:57:38] the man and men and that's the man Jesus
[1:57:42] Christ
[1:57:43] right
[1:57:44] James 2 18 thou believes that there is
[1:57:46] one God thou do as well the Devils also
[1:57:50] believe
[1:57:51] what do they believe in that there's one
[1:57:52] God
[1:57:53] and they tremble
[1:57:55] ain't that right so it's one God with
[1:57:58] one name now you might ask say well what
[1:58:00] about all these Redemptive the seven
[1:58:02] Redemptive names and all these other
[1:58:04] names of of Jehovah and all that they
[1:58:07] are titles everybody say they are titles
[1:58:09] to depict
[1:58:12] as to what he is
[1:58:14] ain't that right but every title that
[1:58:18] God uses to depict uh his character are
[1:58:22] under the umbrella of one name
[1:58:26] ain't that right
[1:58:28] if you need a Jehovah if you needed a
[1:58:30] provider it was Jehovah Jireh if you
[1:58:33] needed peace it was God Shalom Jehovah
[1:58:36] shalom right
[1:58:39] uh uh
[1:58:42] yeah if you need to rock what is a
[1:58:44] Jehovah disc knew
[1:58:47] yeah that was Jehovah something anyways
[1:58:49] seven Redemptive names
[1:58:51] but when it comes to Jesus Christ if you
[1:58:54] need a provider
[1:58:56] it's under the name of Jesus Christ
[1:58:59] if you need a a a a a a a a uh a piece
[1:59:03] it's under the name of Jesus Christ if
[1:59:06] you need a banner it's under the name of
[1:59:07] Jesus Christ ain't that right see they
[1:59:10] all come under that one name so it's in
[1:59:14] CR it's crucial to find out what name
[1:59:17] singular that he is speaking of now Luke
[1:59:21] 1 33 because it says the name Father Son
[1:59:23] and Holy Ghost the whole Thou shalt
[1:59:26] conceive in thy womb now it's the angel
[1:59:28] speaking to to Mary behold Thou shalt
[1:59:32] conceive in thy womb and bring forth a
[1:59:34] ghost
[1:59:36] bring forth a father
[1:59:39] bring forth a son
[1:59:42] right and thou shalt call his name what
[1:59:45] Jesus and he shall be great and shall be
[1:59:50] called the son of Mary
[1:59:53] no the son of Joseph
[1:59:56] he shall be called the son of the
[1:59:59] highest
[2:00:01] ain't that right so the highest uh uh
[2:00:04] the Father the god uh is his is the
[2:00:08] father amen so the name of the son is
[2:00:11] what Jesus that's right so so now what
[2:00:16] did the son tell us in John 5 43 I am
[2:00:19] come in my father's name
[2:00:22] ain't that right this is the son himself
[2:00:25] saying I am come in my father's name and
[2:00:28] you receive him not so the name of the
[2:00:30] father is Jesus ain't that right and who
[2:00:34] is the father Luke 1 32 and the angel
[2:00:36] answered and said unto her the Holy
[2:00:39] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[2:00:42] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[2:00:45] therefore also that Holy thing which
[2:00:47] shall be born of these shall be called
[2:00:49] The Son of God ain't that right Matthew
[2:00:52] 1 20 but while he thought on these
[2:00:55] things speaking of Joseph behold the
[2:00:56] angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a
[2:00:58] dream saying Joseph thou son of David
[2:01:01] fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife
[2:01:03] for that which is conceived in her is of
[2:01:07] the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost is the
[2:01:10] father
[2:01:12] ain't that right and his name is Jesus
[2:01:15] Christ
[2:01:18] that's what the Bible tells us
[2:01:20] and you say Amen
[2:01:22] acts 4 10 if the musicians will come
[2:01:26] acts 4 10 it says be Noah be it known
[2:01:29] unto you all
[2:01:30] and to all the people of Israel that by
[2:01:32] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[2:01:34] whom you crucified whom God raised from
[2:01:37] the dead even by him doth this man stand
[2:01:40] here before you whole
[2:01:42] this is the stone which was said at not
[2:01:44] of you Builders which has become the
[2:01:46] head of the corner neither is there
[2:01:48] salvation in any other for there is no
[2:01:51] other name under Heaven given among men
[2:01:54] whereby we must be saved
[2:01:57] Colossians 3 17 and whatsoever you do in
[2:02:00] word or D do all in the name of the Lord
[2:02:04] Jesus giving thanks to God and the
[2:02:07] father by him
[2:02:09] oh we could go on about the importance
[2:02:11] of a name and what that name represents
[2:02:14] and you know names represent
[2:02:18] characteristics it
[2:02:20] represents the nature of an individual
[2:02:22] the history
[2:02:25] and even God considers names to be
[2:02:27] important
