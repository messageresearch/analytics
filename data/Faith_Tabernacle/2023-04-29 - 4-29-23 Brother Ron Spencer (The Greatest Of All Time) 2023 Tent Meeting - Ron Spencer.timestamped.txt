[48:09] brother Jonathan uh just delivered a
[48:13] powerful sermon and exalted the message
[48:16] of the hour and let us know the real
[48:21] purpose of this message
[48:24] and how that we are part of it
[48:27] and I have thoroughly enjoyed the
[48:30] services have you enjoyed the meeting
[48:33] amen
[48:40] it took us about two weeks to get
[48:42] everything prepared
[48:44] and I told the brothers that was helping
[48:46] I said you know what
[48:48] two weeks and then the meetings are
[48:50] going to fly by really fast
[48:52] and they have gone by real fast and it's
[48:56] hard to believe that we're we're almost
[48:58] here but you know what we the devil we
[49:01] ain't done with the devil yet
[49:03] and I know there's a lot of needs that
[49:06] are present and the devil's already been
[49:08] working today
[49:09] a man because he knows this time's
[49:12] coming tonight
[49:13] and and I I know that many of you are
[49:16] under great expectation for the
[49:19] miraculous to come and as brother Ron he
[49:22] will come and and Minister the word keep
[49:25] that expectation there don't let the
[49:28] devil hinder you don't let your mind
[49:31] wander don't let distractions come and
[49:35] and and hinder you you just keep that
[49:38] Faith right there because God's going to
[49:40] do something tonight I believe it
[49:42] because there's Believers here how many
[49:45] believers do we have
[49:46] amen now you know the prophet stoled in
[49:49] his prayer he said God I believe you're
[49:51] preparing the people to believe all
[49:54] things and I believe that we have been
[49:57] prepared Amen to believe all things
[50:00] we're going to take the limits off of
[50:02] God we're not a people that just believe
[50:04] God for a little bit and a little bit
[50:06] but we believe God for the impossibility
[50:08] when the doctor says there's no hope we
[50:10] still believe because he's the great
[50:13] physician and he has proved night after
[50:15] night after night during this week that
[50:18] he is present here with us amen and so
[50:20] I'm under great expectation and I I just
[50:23] want to Welcome All of You Amen to the

[51:18] time his Liberty and preach what God has

[58:44] incredible I quit I quit preaching every
[58:46] service
[58:47] I packed my bags this morning and
[58:50] you know and somebody knocked at the
[58:52] door with a box of donuts and I stayed
[59:01] we certainly love you with all of our
[59:03] hearts I would like to say to you thank
[59:06] you for every prayer that you have
[59:08] prayed for me
[59:09] the last three years and
[59:12] we're we're fighting
[59:15] and we're fighting we're believing
[59:18] your mind we're here to take the chemo
[59:20] every day and prayer every day
[59:23] and uh you know there was a conversation
[59:25] between the prophet and the angel and
[59:28] they talked about people like us
[59:30] and he said not even cancer
[59:34] not even cancer
[59:48] maybe you don't know but I'll just share
[59:50] this with you and we'll take that a
[59:52] second but
[59:53] we our our battle is with brain cancer
[59:56] two different cancer tumors in my brains
[1:00:00] on my temples they're inoperable
[1:00:03] and uh but God could do the operation
[1:00:05] tonight without a sliver and
[1:00:07] then I have lung cancer but there's
[1:00:10] nothing impossible with God
[1:00:15] [Applause]
[1:00:28] I am going to do something that I
[1:00:30] normally don't do
[1:00:32] and come to a convention and preach in a
[1:00:34] fresh sermon so
[1:00:36] so here we are
[1:00:38] I want to preach to you tonight on the
[1:00:41] greatest of all time
[1:00:47] the greatest of time
[1:00:51] John chapter 18 and verse 36.
[1:01:01] and if Satan would like to pull up a
[1:01:04] seat and sit down
[1:01:06] he knows what's coming
[1:01:09] that's why he's fought us all day
[1:01:15] and Jesus answered
[1:01:19] my kingdom is not of this world
[1:01:24] if my kingdom were of this world
[1:01:29] then my servants would fight
[1:01:32] that I should not be delivered to the
[1:01:34] Jews
[1:01:36] but now is my kingdom
[1:01:39] not
[1:01:41] from hence
[1:01:43] Luke chapter 9 and verse 28.
[1:01:48] and it came to pass about
[1:01:51] an eight day
[1:01:53] after that these Saiyans that he took
[1:01:56] Peter and John and James
[1:01:58] and went up into a mountain to pray
[1:02:02] and as he prayed the fashion of his
[1:02:04] countenance was altered and his raiment
[1:02:07] was white and glistening
[1:02:10] and behold their talk with him to men
[1:02:16] you're talking about standing in Two
[1:02:17] Worlds at the same time
[1:02:20] which were Moses
[1:02:22] and Elias
[1:02:25] who appeared in glory and spake of his
[1:02:28] decease
[1:02:29] which he should accomplish
[1:02:32] at Jerusalem
[1:02:35] but Peter and they that were with him
[1:02:37] were happy with sleep
[1:02:40] and when they were awake they saw his
[1:02:43] glory and the two men which stood with
[1:02:45] him
[1:02:46] and it came to pass as they did they
[1:02:49] departed from him Peter said unto Jesus
[1:02:51] Master it is good for us to be here
[1:02:56] and let us make three Tabernacles one
[1:02:58] for thee one for Moses one for Elias
[1:03:03] not knowing what he had said
[1:03:06] and while he thus spake there came a
[1:03:10] cloud
[1:03:11] and overshadowed them and and they fear
[1:03:14] fear as they entered into the cloud and
[1:03:17] there came a voice out of the cloud
[1:03:20] saying this is my beloved Son
[1:03:25] here
[1:03:26] him
[1:03:28] you may be seated
[1:03:41] I would like to declare unto you since
[1:03:44] the Garden of Eden there's been War
[1:03:47] as a matter of fact the war started in
[1:03:49] heaven
[1:03:51] and I want to just make some parameters
[1:03:53] here
[1:03:54] God created his own enemy
[1:04:01] it'd be an interesting God
[1:04:04] so that there would be light he created
[1:04:07] Darkness
[1:04:10] so that he could be expressed in his own
[1:04:13] Glory he created his own enemy
[1:04:17] and then that we came from God
[1:04:21] and if I could just say it like this if
[1:04:23] you could just think about it like this
[1:04:25] before the foundation of the world you
[1:04:27] were there
[1:04:30] and the Lamb's Book was there and he
[1:04:33] possessed everything that was in it
[1:04:36] brother Branham termed it the physical
[1:04:38] the living physical attributes of God
[1:04:41] that are on the scene you're expressed
[1:04:44] now but you were in his mind before the
[1:04:47] foundation of the world
[1:04:49] now Satan who we've invited to take a
[1:04:53] seat he's lost every battle
[1:04:57] and I want to remind him every time he's
[1:05:00] went against God he's lost every battle
[1:05:03] so let's not give him any credit here
[1:05:07] and got it
[1:05:09] is the champion
[1:05:13] and he's never never never never never
[1:05:16] never been defeated
[1:05:23] and soul
[1:05:25] we know what our origin is we heard it
[1:05:28] this morning we've heard it this week
[1:05:31] we came from God
[1:05:33] and we're here and and brother Branham
[1:05:37] says he said God just don't make a tree
[1:05:39] to make a tree
[1:05:40] he don't just allow an automobile to
[1:05:43] just to see if it can be done
[1:05:46] he just didn't place you on the earth at
[1:05:49] this time
[1:05:50] now think about this
[1:05:52] he chose you to live in the darkest age
[1:05:56] that there would ever be
[1:05:59] to which even a prophet couldn't see
[1:06:03] through
[1:06:05] total darkness
[1:06:10] and he drawed in just a little bit of
[1:06:13] light
[1:06:15] because you were here
[1:06:23] now if God hasn't lost for six thousand
[1:06:26] years plus
[1:06:29] he's not going to lose here at the
[1:06:31] finish line
[1:06:33] [Applause]
[1:06:40] pilate didn't realize the the parameters
[1:06:44] of what he was standing against
[1:06:46] he thought
[1:06:48] that he had the power to crucify the
[1:06:51] Lord
[1:06:52] he thought that you know I could set him
[1:06:55] free
[1:06:56] that's what he thought
[1:06:58] but you see every Prophet since Abraham
[1:07:03] had been telling that he was on the way
[1:07:07] every one of those prophets had faced
[1:07:09] the same enemy
[1:07:11] every one of those prophets being born
[1:07:14] of man had weaknesses and strains of
[1:07:17] humanity in their life and when the
[1:07:20] enemy would come against him maybe it
[1:07:22] was moody maybe it was high temper maybe
[1:07:26] it was running from the presence of the
[1:07:28] Lord maybe it was idolatry
[1:07:31] a lot of things were written in their
[1:07:34] life but every one of them prophesied of
[1:07:36] there's one coming
[1:07:41] and they would preach it with all of
[1:07:43] their heart and they knew even building
[1:07:45] a temple to which God would answer
[1:07:47] prayer from that Temple and they would
[1:07:50] believe that God was over them but God
[1:07:53] had a greater desire to be with them
[1:07:57] and then in this day he wants to be in
[1:08:00] you
[1:08:02] not just in this tent
[1:08:05] not just in your church he wants to live
[1:08:08] in your temple
[1:08:13] [Applause]
[1:08:16] Jesus has made his way
[1:08:18] he's made his way walking through the
[1:08:20] Old Testament every one of those
[1:08:23] prophets gave a display of what God was
[1:08:27] like
[1:08:28] attributes of God was in display with
[1:08:30] Moses
[1:08:32] yet when Moses would come up against
[1:08:34] some great obstacles
[1:08:37] it was the voice behind The Voice
[1:08:40] that said let my people go
[1:08:47] Moses had disappointed himself he had
[1:08:50] disappointed his Brethren he had killed
[1:08:53] a man with his own energies but this
[1:08:55] time after he had met God himself
[1:09:00] because that's what he lacked was in the
[1:09:03] pillar of Fire
[1:09:04] if you ever meet that Pillar of Fire
[1:09:07] what's lacking on the inside of you is
[1:09:10] to have a personal experience with that
[1:09:13] same Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:15] [Applause]
[1:09:20] this time he told Pharaoh let my people
[1:09:24] go
[1:09:25] [Applause]
[1:09:26] pharon listen didn't realize that Angels
[1:09:30] had gathered
[1:09:31] because there was a message on the earth
[1:09:33] now
[1:09:35] God was going to bring his seed from
[1:09:37] that bondage
[1:09:39] it wasn't an if it was going to happen
[1:09:45] he had met with the father of the faith
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:49] he'd met with him
[1:09:51] and told him that your children are
[1:09:53] going to be sojourners
[1:09:56] about 400 years
[1:09:59] even Joseph would grab a hold of the
[1:10:01] promise and said when I die don't you
[1:10:03] bury me here
[1:10:06] there's no Resurrection here there's no
[1:10:09] Resurrection in this denomination you
[1:10:12] carry my bones
[1:10:16] coming one
[1:10:22] [Applause]
[1:10:26] Moses
[1:10:28] watch this God would begin to work
[1:10:31] seeing the very spoken word of God come
[1:10:35] into existence
[1:10:37] yet Moses would stand and brother
[1:10:39] Branham would use the term the bloodiest
[1:10:41] scene in history was about to take place
[1:10:44] the greatest army
[1:10:47] in the entire world
[1:10:50] was facing down a group of people that
[1:10:53] now their hearts was hardened and now
[1:10:55] they were ready to mirror every one of
[1:10:57] them
[1:10:59] but let me just say Satan can only go so
[1:11:02] far
[1:11:06] he may be breathing down your neck
[1:11:08] tonight and fighting you with everything
[1:11:09] that's within you but he can only go so
[1:11:12] far
[1:11:17] you've got to turn around and tell him
[1:11:18] off
[1:11:20] off
[1:11:21] I'm a Child of God I've got more
[1:11:24] Authority in the angels in heaven
[1:11:28] [Applause]
[1:11:36] we're like Moses sometimes
[1:11:39] Moses began to cry out to God
[1:11:44] all he had seen
[1:11:46] and now he's standing there crying out
[1:11:48] to God
[1:11:50] and God just simply speaks to him
[1:11:53] don't cry out to me speak
[1:11:58] and go forward
[1:12:00] I'm telling that story for the morning
[1:12:02] you have the power
[1:12:05] to speak life and death in your tongues
[1:12:09] by your confession
[1:12:13] [Applause]
[1:12:20] we're not a bunch of sissies
[1:12:23] let's just get some things pretty
[1:12:24] straight here we're not a bunch of
[1:12:25] sissies
[1:12:27] we're not a bunch of panty waste half
[1:12:30] believers
[1:12:33] we haven't signed a church book just
[1:12:36] until we get our feelings hurt we're
[1:12:38] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:12:40] we know where we came from we know where
[1:12:43] we're going we will not be defeated we
[1:12:46] will not turn back
[1:12:49] we're not wishy-washy jellyfish backbone
[1:12:52] Christians
[1:12:57] we're bound to be spawn we're life of
[1:12:59] his life we're power of his power
[1:13:02] we are him
[1:13:04] [Applause]
[1:13:12] God knew you were coming
[1:13:15] he knew what our you'd be born
[1:13:17] he predestinated your coming he prepared
[1:13:21] for your coming
[1:13:24] brother Branham stood in great
[1:13:25] opposition delivering the message
[1:13:28] and maybe 99 of them didn't want it
[1:13:32] but it would lay there in seed form
[1:13:34] knowing you would arrive
[1:13:40] it will accomplish its purpose
[1:13:44] we're not wimps
[1:13:46] we're not tossed about every every wind
[1:13:49] of Doctrine
[1:13:51] we're warriors
[1:13:57] we're champions
[1:13:59] we've had some battles by now
[1:14:03] we've been battle tested
[1:14:06] look over at your neighbor and say we've
[1:14:07] been battle tested
[1:14:16] Duane
[1:14:19] and I I just cannot imagine
[1:14:21] Moses and Elijah's job
[1:14:24] today
[1:14:29] no doubt even in Jude it talks about
[1:14:32] that
[1:14:34] the devil
[1:14:35] has great accusation about words the
[1:14:37] body of Moses
[1:14:41] because he's the Accuser
[1:14:44] but God wouldn't let him
[1:14:46] be found
[1:14:50] maybe God was disappointed in him and
[1:14:52] told him he couldn't go across
[1:14:55] but he wouldn't let the enemy find his
[1:14:57] body
[1:15:03] Elijah was Moody
[1:15:05] but he was making a journey he knew it
[1:15:07] was coming toward his end
[1:15:12] and his associate pastor with him
[1:15:17] said why are you following me so close
[1:15:19] he said I want a double portion of what
[1:15:21] you got
[1:15:23] we've heard it preached this week it's
[1:15:26] our allotment
[1:15:28] it's our allotment
[1:15:30] we want to adopt a portion of what he's
[1:15:32] got
[1:15:33] and he said if you keep your eyes on me
[1:15:35] and when you see me go
[1:15:39] listen there wasn't a school of the
[1:15:40] message would turn him around
[1:15:43] it wasn't anybody that would turn him
[1:15:45] around he kept his eyes on Elijah
[1:15:50] when he came down to that water Elijah
[1:15:54] took that melon struck that water and he
[1:15:56] walked across on dry land
[1:16:00] when he got across there brother Brown
[1:16:02] said he picked a chariot said it was all
[1:16:04] kind of Chariots sitting around in the
[1:16:06] bushes and he picked his and leaving
[1:16:08] chariots for us
[1:16:16] and as Elijah ascends out you know it
[1:16:20] doesn't make a difference what the
[1:16:21] critic says when Elijah sends out he
[1:16:24] allows his mantle to drop down
[1:16:27] and you see Elisha
[1:16:31] Elisha was the one that had to be
[1:16:33] trimmed
[1:16:34] to fit Elijah's Mantle
[1:16:39] God don't trim the word for you he trims
[1:16:42] you for the word
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:46] he washes you he changes you
[1:16:53] he picks it up and goes right back to
[1:16:55] the same water
[1:16:57] whereas the Lord God of Elijah listen
[1:17:01] just because God took brother Branham
[1:17:03] off of the scene didn't mean God died
[1:17:07] [Applause]
[1:17:09] as a matter of fact he was just getting
[1:17:11] started
[1:17:13] [Applause]
[1:17:17] because God just doesn't send a message
[1:17:19] just to see if he can send a message now
[1:17:22] he's given a bride full Authority
[1:17:25] take the word and use it
[1:17:28] over time
[1:17:31] [Applause]
[1:17:42] does any of you ever get the idea that
[1:17:45] you second guess things
[1:17:49] am I at the right place
[1:17:53] you know you you get to a point God does
[1:17:55] things in your life and then you go to
[1:17:57] second guessing things
[1:18:03] the Miracles begin to pile up
[1:18:06] and they begin to pile up and
[1:18:08] now we're getting closer you know I
[1:18:10] asked for a double portion
[1:18:12] and you know you're seeing the Miracles
[1:18:14] and you come one short
[1:18:17] I can only imagine the Accuser
[1:18:20] that's here
[1:18:24] I can only imagine the accuser said
[1:18:26] you're one short
[1:18:31] no doubt some of the Believers around
[1:18:33] you know they would count
[1:18:36] and they would go well there's the
[1:18:37] bridge and there's the cloud and
[1:18:45] you you you you just don't understand
[1:18:47] Supernatural things
[1:18:51] and so
[1:18:53] Elisha dies
[1:18:57] you know if he was a Critic of the
[1:18:58] message you'd you'd put it in the on the
[1:19:01] internet
[1:19:07] but you see the story's not done yet
[1:19:12] now if we would have a credit cure
[1:19:13] tonight understand the story's not done
[1:19:15] yet but if you hang around long enough
[1:19:20] we won't need this tent no more
[1:19:32] if you hang around long enough there's
[1:19:34] going to be false teeth and glasses and
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:44] now there was a battle
[1:19:46] no way can you put all this together
[1:19:49] there's a battle going on
[1:19:52] and In the Heat of a battle a boy dies
[1:19:55] he's going to be a part of the testimony
[1:19:58] no doubt many of you are parts of
[1:20:00] testimonies
[1:20:02] and and as he dies these brothers are
[1:20:04] trying to carry him as far as they could
[1:20:06] carry him but they do wore out
[1:20:07] you can only carry a dead man so far
[1:20:14] [Applause]
[1:20:15] [Music]
[1:20:17] you know pastors we can only carry dead
[1:20:19] men so far
[1:20:21] but if you can throw him in on Elijah's
[1:20:23] bones
[1:20:25] Hallelujah if you can throw him in
[1:20:29] on Elijah's phones
[1:20:32] there's a radioactive promise still
[1:20:35] inside of them
[1:20:38] those phones may be going back to the
[1:20:41] ashes and the gases but there's a
[1:20:43] promises laying there
[1:20:46] the greatest of all time has made a
[1:20:49] promise
[1:20:49] [Applause]
[1:20:58] he didn't know how he got there
[1:21:01] he didn't know who threw him in
[1:21:04] all he knew was he felt better than he's
[1:21:06] felt in decades
[1:21:09] I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive
[1:21:14] [Applause]
[1:21:23] so in briefly I'll give you a little
[1:21:25] history of what these two Prophets
[1:21:28] were a part of
[1:21:31] in their natural life
[1:21:34] they'd seen the Red Sea
[1:21:36] they had seen
[1:21:38] 40 years
[1:21:40] they'd seen him go across
[1:21:42] they'd seen God feed two million people
[1:21:47] almost Supernatural
[1:21:50] sister Kimberly wouldn't you like God to
[1:21:51] do that
[1:21:57] and here's Elijah
[1:22:01] he's threw that mantle down
[1:22:03] and in that realm knowing all things
[1:22:06] he knew God brought it to pass
[1:22:09] so now
[1:22:11] you know I I don't know I don't have an
[1:22:13] answer here but I don't even pretend to
[1:22:15] have an answer
[1:22:16] but Moses and Elijah was wasn't done
[1:22:22] now you see every Prophet had pointed to
[1:22:25] this one
[1:22:26] and this one is now standing and he's
[1:22:29] coming toward
[1:22:31] Calvary
[1:22:33] now as he's coming toward Calvary and
[1:22:35] he's coming toward the the finishing up
[1:22:38] of redemption
[1:22:40] he
[1:22:41] he knows he's not here to come to have a
[1:22:43] family
[1:22:44] and he's not going to build churches
[1:22:49] but he's displayed God and in displaying
[1:22:52] God he's turned water into wine
[1:22:58] took a natural water and made the best
[1:23:01] fermented wine
[1:23:04] he's fed five thousand
[1:23:08] he's touched a leper
[1:23:10] he's walked to a a well
[1:23:13] and found a predestinated seed and
[1:23:16] that's the first one that he would tell
[1:23:19] I'm the greatest of all time
[1:23:25] there's been prophets but
[1:23:27] I'm him
[1:23:31] I'm him
[1:23:34] she gets religious
[1:23:39] well he knew she'd get religious like a
[1:23:42] lot of you
[1:23:43] but if he can just break through that
[1:23:45] religious Realm
[1:23:47] find the secret of her heart
[1:23:52] and when she recognizes
[1:23:55] who he is
[1:23:57] and it becomes a personal revelation to
[1:23:59] who she won't have to go to a school
[1:24:04] she'll go into a city
[1:24:06] and cause a Revival
[1:24:09] come and see a man
[1:24:18] no he's displayed
[1:24:20] who he is
[1:24:22] his personal friend Lazarus has come to
[1:24:25] a spot to where that he's got sick
[1:24:29] and you know no doubt the church member
[1:24:31] said if Jesus really was your friend
[1:24:34] he'd come back quickly
[1:24:38] you know if he was the kind of Pastor
[1:24:39] that he should be he wouldn't be away on
[1:24:41] a hunting trip
[1:24:46] you know if he was you know if he was
[1:24:48] and they just kept echoing in his ear
[1:24:51] and Jesus went four days
[1:24:54] but he's always on time
[1:24:59] now no doubt
[1:25:02] we understand through the prophet no
[1:25:05] doubt as he slipped from this Dimension
[1:25:07] and goes into Abraham's bosom if we can
[1:25:09] call it like that he begins to meet
[1:25:11] celebrities from the Old Testament
[1:25:15] no doubt they begin to share stories
[1:25:19] and Abraham would say it I met him
[1:25:23] I met him I was getting old
[1:25:26] he'd promised me we'd have a son
[1:25:29] Sarah remember how it was when we were
[1:25:32] sitting and you were sitting in there
[1:25:34] laughing and he had to remind you that
[1:25:37] there was nothing impossible
[1:25:39] I want to remind you tonight there's
[1:25:41] nothing impossible
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:49] there's nothing impossible to God
[1:25:52] brother Ron how can you preach Divine
[1:25:54] Healing when you're you've got cancer
[1:25:55] like you got it
[1:26:00] it's going to take a stronger win than
[1:26:02] this
[1:26:16] and if we could get just a little bowl
[1:26:18] Satan would have already took my life if
[1:26:21] he could
[1:26:27] if he could have he would have not took
[1:26:29] my life and so since he don't have the
[1:26:32] power to take my life I might as well
[1:26:35] stack my head my foot on his head and
[1:26:39] cut his head out amen
[1:26:50] now I'm going to come to your Pew if he
[1:26:53] could have
[1:26:53] [Applause]
[1:26:56] if he could have he would have took your
[1:26:58] life a long time ago
[1:27:00] because he sees you as an adversary he
[1:27:04] sees that Pillar of Fire he sees those
[1:27:06] angels around you
[1:27:08] if he could
[1:27:09] [Applause]
[1:27:14] he would take your life
[1:27:17] but the greatest of all time the
[1:27:20] champions of Champions lives on the
[1:27:23] inside of you
[1:27:26] and there's no good luck I caught
[1:27:34] baby
[1:27:38] now it would seem like just another
[1:27:40] meeting
[1:27:43] but God's called to me
[1:27:46] so Moses steps from this dimension
[1:27:51] to where Jesus is at
[1:27:53] I would say it's probably a half a step
[1:28:01] and he steps from that dimension
[1:28:04] and Elijah's with him
[1:28:07] they stop
[1:28:08] there he is
[1:28:10] now they're looking I
[1:28:14] with the one that they prophesied
[1:28:20] can you imagine what it felt like
[1:28:25] long for this day
[1:28:28] you met him as a pillar of fire in a
[1:28:30] burning bush
[1:28:34] and now he's standing there
[1:28:36] in his flesh
[1:28:39] God has came now in human flesh
[1:28:42] as a man
[1:28:45] now as the man brother Branham said
[1:28:49] looked at the word to see what the word
[1:28:52] said about him
[1:28:55] and it's a secret for you if you can
[1:28:57] look at the word to see what it says
[1:29:00] about you
[1:29:03] not seeing in and not Fox and not what
[1:29:07] those guys say and not what your critic
[1:29:09] says but when you look at God's
[1:29:12] Eternal Word
[1:29:15] about what it says about you
[1:29:21] now
[1:29:23] no doubt they could only tell him
[1:29:25] through the word
[1:29:27] and give him scriptures
[1:29:30] the scripture says that
[1:29:32] yea though I walk through the valley of
[1:29:34] the shadow of death
[1:29:36] have a fear no evil
[1:29:38] for thou art with me
[1:29:40] thyroid and thus death will comfort me
[1:29:45] who is the king of glory
[1:29:48] take him through the scriptures
[1:29:50] you're fulfilling that word
[1:29:53] you're fulfilling everything that
[1:29:55] Abraham talked about you everything that
[1:29:58] Jonah when Jonah was in that belly of
[1:30:00] the well
[1:30:03] that fish that was prepared he had to be
[1:30:06] in there three days that's where you'll
[1:30:08] be three days
[1:30:12] but there's work for you to do while
[1:30:14] you're in there
[1:30:16] you're going to go into the regions of
[1:30:18] hell
[1:30:19] and the accuser of the Brethren the one
[1:30:22] that has the keys of death hand on the
[1:30:24] grave the Trinity of hell you're going
[1:30:27] to defeat him
[1:30:30] [Applause]
[1:30:39] they looked at that word
[1:30:41] and the Word was looking back at them
[1:30:45] listen
[1:30:46] he needed that like you need it
[1:30:52] he needed it like you need it
[1:30:54] you need services like this
[1:30:58] oh brother on I don't have to go to
[1:31:00] church yes you do
[1:31:02] if you're a Christian you're going to go
[1:31:03] to church
[1:31:04] [Applause]
[1:31:06] and more than just go to church
[1:31:08] there's something on the inside of you
[1:31:10] it's got to respond to that word
[1:31:13] because you've got some things that
[1:31:15] you've got to accomplish
[1:31:17] the man Jesus needed to hear the word
[1:31:20] [Applause]
[1:31:21] you may think I'm way off course let me
[1:31:23] just say God had to leave him and let
[1:31:26] him die as a man
[1:31:30] what's their sermons effective I would
[1:31:33] say very much so
[1:31:37] he was wounded
[1:31:41] for our transgressions
[1:31:44] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:31:48] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:31:51] him
[1:31:53] and as they preached to him you must
[1:31:56] accomplish this
[1:31:57] [Applause]
[1:31:58] out of Adam's race is counting on you
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:03] all about them's race is counting on you
[1:32:06] every sick boy every sick girl
[1:32:10] everyone laying in the grave is counting
[1:32:14] on you to accomplish this task
[1:32:21] Williams prophets couldn't do it
[1:32:25] we were born in sin
[1:32:33] do you think Satan wasn't watching
[1:32:37] do you think he's not watching tonight
[1:32:42] we must accomplish this
[1:32:50] they would fly him to a blocker
[1:32:55] Satan would anoint men
[1:32:58] to beat him
[1:32:59] like no other human being
[1:33:02] would be beat
[1:33:06] to which those stripes would become so
[1:33:09] deep
[1:33:10] I'm telling his organs
[1:33:12] we begin to pulsate through his ribs
[1:33:17] scream moan
[1:33:20] he could have just nodded his head
[1:33:25] he could have just nodded his head
[1:33:28] he could have called Ten Thousand Angels
[1:33:31] one of them
[1:33:34] would have changed the whole scene
[1:33:37] brother Ron I don't know all about that
[1:33:39] well let me just give you a little story
[1:33:41] brother random Sydney
[1:33:42] he said he said those three Hebrew
[1:33:45] children were getting ready to go into
[1:33:47] the fiery furnace
[1:33:49] wormwood became before God
[1:33:52] and said father are you watching what's
[1:33:54] going on down there with your children
[1:33:57] I can go down there and change the whole
[1:33:59] seat
[1:34:01] I destroyed the world with water
[1:34:03] [Applause]
[1:34:06] other Angels came and said I can go down
[1:34:08] and I can do it
[1:34:11] no
[1:34:13] I'm gonna go myself
[1:34:25] let me just say in the deepest darkest
[1:34:27] trial of your life he comes himself
[1:34:30] [Applause]
[1:34:33] he's always on time
[1:34:35] it doesn't matter what your
[1:34:37] circumstances are it doesn't matter what
[1:34:40] your problems are it doesn't matter if
[1:34:42] there's ten thousand demons that are
[1:34:44] against you he's on his way
[1:35:01] men were killed throwing them into the
[1:35:03] fire
[1:35:06] these men walked into that fire and they
[1:35:09] had an old-fashioned conference with God
[1:35:15] they had a conference with God that's
[1:35:18] where God will meet you
[1:35:21] you said brother Ron but I've been going
[1:35:22] through the darkest difficulties in my
[1:35:24] life I feel like they're coming to an
[1:35:26] end I don't know what to do with
[1:35:27] tomorrow if you would just look around
[1:35:29] in your furnace
[1:35:34] if you'll just look around in your
[1:35:36] furnace of Fire
[1:35:38] the licks of fire may be over your head
[1:35:41] but if you'll look long enough you'll
[1:35:44] see him standing there right there with
[1:35:47] you
[1:35:55] Satan would destroy you with one lift of
[1:35:58] fire if he could but because God
[1:36:01] standing there in your fire
[1:36:05] he can't touch you
[1:36:07] [Applause]
[1:36:21] because you just wait
[1:36:24] I need to change the scene
[1:36:28] they his angels didn't understand you
[1:36:30] were on the way
[1:36:33] and he said I've got to do this
[1:36:36] because I Got A Boy Named Ron
[1:36:40] he's going to be told that he's only got
[1:36:42] four months to live
[1:36:44] but three years later he's going to be
[1:36:46] preaching just as strong as he's ever
[1:36:48] preached because I'm with him in the
[1:36:52] fire
[1:36:55] you may not see him you may not feel him
[1:36:58] but he's with you
[1:37:07] bird ever
[1:37:35] now Satan you've heard these quotes
[1:37:37] before us but I'd like for you to listen
[1:37:39] again
[1:37:40] he ain't got one legal power
[1:37:42] Jesus Christ stripped him of everything
[1:37:45] that he had on couch
[1:37:47] the full sin penalty was paid at Calvary
[1:37:50] and the devil has no legal right at all
[1:37:54] he's nothing but a big block
[1:37:58] of Jesus's Works was complete everything
[1:38:01] was complete totally delivered
[1:38:04] he totally delivered the leopard from
[1:38:07] leprosy eternally delivered a woman with
[1:38:09] a blood issue
[1:38:11] he totally delivered the world from sin
[1:38:13] and when he died on that day in job
[1:38:16] atonement he totally delivered every sin
[1:38:19] he delivered the church so there's no
[1:38:22] need for us to live underprivileged
[1:38:25] children
[1:38:31] come on now
[1:38:33] there's no need for us to live in a
[1:38:35] defeated state
[1:38:37] because he defeated the devil and took
[1:38:40] all the principalities in power and
[1:38:43] subdued them under his feet and they
[1:38:45] have no legal rights to rule over you
[1:38:48] we are Christians
[1:38:51] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:38:55] [Applause]
[1:38:57] we don't have to let the devil dictate
[1:39:00] to us
[1:39:01] Christ delivered us
[1:39:04] he delivered us from Talking he
[1:39:07] delivered us from the back guard he
[1:39:09] delivered us from all kinds of smutty
[1:39:11] things he delivered us and put us in the
[1:39:14] Holy hands
[1:39:18] he delivered us from sicknesses he
[1:39:20] delivered us for we have an abstract
[1:39:23] titled deed
[1:39:25] for he was wounded for our
[1:39:27] transgressions and with his stripes we
[1:39:31] were healed
[1:39:33] he is our healer
[1:39:37] these men will lay hands on you in a
[1:39:39] little while but they're not your healer
[1:39:43] he is your healer
[1:39:47] but they've got god-given rights
[1:39:50] they have more power than the angels of
[1:39:52] God that's him
[1:39:55] they're under the jurisdiction to take
[1:39:57] God at his work lay hands on the sick
[1:40:00] and they shall recover expect to be
[1:40:03] healed
[1:40:05] expect to be delivered whether on but
[1:40:08] it's impossible expect them
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:21] Satan you are defeated men
[1:40:24] you have no legal rights to begin with
[1:40:26] to torment these people you're a bluff
[1:40:30] we're calling your bluff
[1:40:39] Jesus Christ
[1:40:40] defeated you at Calvary
[1:40:45] why don't you say that Jesus Christ
[1:40:48] defeated the devil at Calvary turn to
[1:40:52] your neighbor
[1:41:00] [Applause]
[1:41:24] this brother Brown said now are we Sons
[1:41:27] and Daughters of God
[1:41:31] not someday
[1:41:34] not some fairy tale way off
[1:41:37] now
[1:41:40] now
[1:41:42] it's a present tense
[1:41:50] brother bear said I hate the devil and
[1:41:52] he hates me
[1:41:55] I love it
[1:41:57] none of these guys are want to be on the
[1:41:59] top 10 greatest preachers we don't we
[1:42:02] don't need that
[1:42:04] but I would like to be known
[1:42:07] on Satan's list of most hated
[1:42:13] brother Wayne I've got a good idea we're
[1:42:14] on that list
[1:42:26] I defy every devil and take this
[1:42:28] mountain by faith who are you great

[1:42:32] before the Lord
[1:42:34] why you'll become as a plane

[1:42:46] one of these second present that's sick
[1:42:51] or brother Branham was here

[1:43:15] a few moments

[1:43:26] grounds
[1:43:27] we shall fight in the fields and in the
[1:43:29] streets we shall fight in the Hills we
[1:43:32] shall Never Surrender
[1:43:35] we'll fight for our families
[1:43:38] we'll fight for our children
[1:43:40] we'll fight for our healing we'll fight
[1:43:43] for our deliverance we fight for our joy
[1:43:46] we fight for our peace we will fight for
[1:43:49] the Holy Ghost we'll fight until our
[1:43:51] bodies are changed we'll fight until
[1:43:54] we're sitting at the marriage supper of
[1:43:56] the Lamb
[1:43:57] we shall Never Surrender
[1:44:13] on the roughest of days in our lowest
[1:44:15] hours
[1:44:18] even in those times we're still
[1:44:22] children of God
[1:44:25] we're still chosen
[1:44:27] blessed
[1:44:29] favored
[1:44:32] forgiven
[1:44:34] lad LED of God Victorious
[1:44:38] and heritors of all of Heaven's Glory
[1:44:41] privileged to walk with our Our God and
[1:44:44] our creator
[1:44:45] we're married to the King of Kings the
[1:44:48] Lord of lords he calls us his wife
[1:44:54] we're strong in faith armed to fight
[1:44:57] Devils entrusted with God's word
[1:45:00] the most powerful weapon we're protected
[1:45:02] by the army of the almighty he has
[1:45:05] placed a hedge about us we have an
[1:45:07] assurance that every time that we call
[1:45:11] he hears any answers
[1:45:14] and he always answers our prayer
[1:45:24] found this your while back
[1:45:27] I asked God
[1:45:29] why are you taking me through Troubled
[1:45:32] Water
[1:45:34] and God replied back
[1:45:36] because your enemies can't swim
[1:45:59] it's the real thing
[1:46:09] brother on that was poetry that's really
[1:46:11] nice writing by somebody that was
[1:46:13] inspired I'd say they was inspired
[1:46:15] so since you liked it I'm going to give
[1:46:17] you some direct inspiration
[1:46:20] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[1:46:23] Whom Shall I feel
[1:46:26] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[1:46:28] whom shall I be afraid
[1:46:30] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[1:46:33] foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:46:35] they stumbled and fell though a host
[1:46:37] shouldn't trap against me my heart shall
[1:46:39] not fear the war should rise against me
[1:46:42] and this will I be confident one thing
[1:46:45] that I have desired of the Lord that I
[1:46:47] will seek after that I may dwell in the
[1:46:49] house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:46:51] life to behold the beauty of the Lord to
[1:46:54] inquire him is simple for in the time of
[1:46:57] trouble
[1:47:02] he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[1:47:05] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[1:47:07] me and he shall set me up on a rock
[1:47:10] [Applause]
[1:47:12] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:47:15] my enemies round about therefore will I
[1:47:17] offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of
[1:47:19] Joy I will sink
[1:47:28] in trouble what should I do sing
[1:47:36] brother Ron I I just have trouble with
[1:47:38] all this emotion
[1:47:41] well I got some quotes for you
[1:47:46] you know they went to a random meeting
[1:47:49] so happened brother Brandon was there
[1:47:52] and somebody got excited
[1:47:56] and you know a critical always find the
[1:47:58] preacher
[1:48:00] and he said brother Brandon I was really
[1:48:02] enjoying that for a while
[1:48:04] all of a sudden that brother that sister
[1:48:06] back there got the squealing and
[1:48:08] praising the Lord and shouting it just
[1:48:10] made chills go all over me
[1:48:13] brother Brown had a good response
[1:48:15] whatever you do don't go to heaven
[1:48:17] [Applause]
[1:48:27] whatever you do don't go to heaven he
[1:48:29] said you free to hell
[1:48:35] as a matter of fact this is the quietest
[1:48:37] World you'll ever be in
[1:48:47] now if you just happen to be one of them
[1:48:49] self-religious and don't believe in
[1:48:50] Emotion there's a place called hell
[1:48:54] and in hell they're not going to be
[1:48:56] partying there's going to be weeping and
[1:48:58] wailing and gnashing the teeth
[1:49:00] everybody's going to be enemies down
[1:49:02] there it's going to be nice
[1:49:07] so you better praise God why you got the
[1:49:09] chance
[1:49:31] so what you need to hear is the autopsy
[1:49:34] of a dead Church what killed your church
[1:49:36] when you when you stop praising the Lord
[1:49:41] when you preach like a Badness
[1:49:43] [Applause]
[1:49:47] when you don't want no emotion in your
[1:49:50] church
[1:49:51] I got a quote for you anything that's
[1:49:54] without emotion is dead
[1:49:58] and it needs to be burned
[1:50:09] you want to know where God's at he
[1:50:12] inhabits the Praises of his people
[1:50:19] you want to make God happy just start
[1:50:21] worshiping him a little bit
[1:50:25] start taking your lips and start
[1:50:28] praising him start rejoicing lift up
[1:50:31] those hands
[1:50:34] Larry
[1:50:36] [Applause]
[1:50:52] now I want to give you a simple solution
[1:50:55] preachers that can't preach the Holy
[1:50:57] Ghost
[1:50:59] can't preach fire it's because they
[1:51:02] don't have any
[1:51:04] [Applause]
[1:51:17] and a man that don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:51:19] can't preach you into an atmosphere to
[1:51:22] where you can get it for yourself
[1:51:24] [Applause]
[1:51:28] and if your church ain't got fire in it
[1:51:30] move move get up and move get up and
[1:51:33] move I don't care what your job is get
[1:51:35] up and move go find a church it's got
[1:51:38] the Holy Ghost on the inside of it where
[1:51:40] God is welcome
[1:51:42] where is welcome or you can praise it
[1:51:48] this ain't no time for dead churches

[1:52:01] greatest of all time yes he's here and

[2:07:16] accuser be a part of it
[2:07:21] it's you and God
[2:07:29] it isn't no wonder you shout when you

[2:11:45] I mean he's heard Aaron Oglesby preach
[2:11:48] it was that night in the cabin the Lord
[2:11:50] spoke through our lips and said after
[2:11:52] this night you'll never be the same
[2:11:54] God's calling you to preach
[2:11:56] you'll never be the same
[2:12:00] that's my God
[2:12:19] I'm gonna take my time right here
[2:12:21] because
[2:12:24] I saw a vision just only seconds after
[2:12:26] that
[2:12:27] we're gonna have a little boy
[2:12:31] totally impossible little boy
[2:12:34] and I saw him God's God's absolutely
[2:12:37] accurate I saw him the yard as I'm
[2:12:41] coming across the yard in a Mickey Mouse
[2:12:43] shirt
[2:12:48] I'm not here to debate whether God likes
[2:12:50] Mickey Mouse or not
[2:12:59] sister Katie came through the prayer
[2:13:01] line
[2:13:02] brother Andrew's wife
[2:13:04] she was having miscarriages
[2:13:06] and the Lord spoke to me said it's in
[2:13:08] her womb and the next time the angel of
[2:13:11] the Lord drops in the building you call
[2:13:12] them up to pray for them
[2:13:14] is Right called them up to pray for him
[2:13:17] six weeks later she went to the doctor
[2:13:23] Reagan and Ally are you here
[2:13:26] don't no no no no no don't leave
[2:13:30] there's two little girls getting ready
[2:13:31] to come and while they're coming is he
[2:13:33] awake
[2:13:34] I put him to sleep a lot
[2:13:42] is Charlie in the building
[2:13:46] go ahead Grandma you can bring him
[2:13:51] in North Carolina in the prayer line
[2:13:53] there was critics that was against me
[2:13:55] that night tried to shut us down I said
[2:13:58] if God can't operate out here
[2:14:01] he'll operate behind the curtain
[2:14:03] they couldn't have children
[2:14:08] he sure looks like a fine little boy
[2:14:33] foreign
[2:14:44] [Applause]
[2:14:52] Jackson you're in the building
[2:14:55] they went home well I'll tell your story
[2:14:57] or without you
[2:15:01] they hadn't been able to have children
[2:15:03] for 16 years and behind that curtain
[2:15:09] God gave them their child
[2:15:13] a very healthy baby
[2:15:16] and I want to go further than that
[2:15:21] I know you two just got married you're
[2:15:23] somewhere in this building
[2:15:24] sister Betty
[2:15:26] her husband had said in it
[2:15:28] had said in church for decades
[2:15:32] how long were you married
[2:15:35] almost how much
[2:15:37] you don't look that old
[2:15:43] and he spoke these words I can serve a
[2:15:45] God Like That
[2:15:46] and in that moment he became a real
[2:15:48] Christian
[2:16:03] with God there's no accidents
[2:16:07] within a month he found out he had
[2:16:08] cancer four months later I I stood at
[2:16:11] his funeral and I declared to that huge
[2:16:14] audience this man met God
[2:16:18] cancer couldn't take it
[2:16:21] I want you to say this you there's not a
[2:16:23] devil in hell can take you until God's
[2:16:26] finished with you
[2:16:36] I remember in Ohio when God called you
[2:16:38] to preach as you walked through a prayer
[2:16:39] line don't tell me God don't work in
[2:16:42] prayer lines
[2:16:51] we could talk of truth that couldn't
[2:16:54] walk
[2:16:56] and we saw a vision I turned to Timothy
[2:16:58] and said I see a vision
[2:17:00] of little Drew walking
[2:17:03] and I asked Bethany where's that and
[2:17:05] he's in the he's at a bassinet I believe
[2:17:07] it was
[2:17:12] that boy ran
[2:17:15] in a cancer Marathon for me last year
[2:17:34] I want you to just look
[2:17:37] this is the same God of Abraham
[2:17:40] and Abraham enjoyed work enjoyed that
[2:17:43] Isaac's company
[2:17:45] so do I
[2:17:50] Isaac was only a dream but he ain't no
[2:17:53] dream no longer
[2:18:06] now Isaac
[2:18:08] what my job is to do is to get these
[2:18:12] people
[2:18:13] to believe that what I'm telling about
[2:18:15] you is true
[2:18:19] because some people don't believe God
[2:18:21] does Miracles anymore
[2:18:24] but God does miracles
[2:18:27] and he's a miracle working God
[2:18:29] now you see there's some wombs out there
[2:18:31] that really need to give birth
[2:18:35] and if they can look at you and see that
[2:18:37] if God can do that for them
[2:18:44] there's some pawpaws out there that's
[2:18:46] waiting on a promise
[2:18:48] and if God could do that for brother Ron
[2:18:51] [Applause]
[2:19:05] you see I was writing down
[2:19:07] the Miracles that happened that one
[2:19:09] night
[2:19:10] and I'm sorry
[2:19:13] but I have forgot to write yours down
[2:19:16] and the Lord spoke to me and said
[2:19:19] remember Jessica
[2:19:21] I gave her her son
[2:19:24] sister Connie was on the other side of
[2:19:26] the house and she came running and said
[2:19:29] I don't know what you're into
[2:19:32] but I just felt him all the way on the
[2:19:34] other side of the house
[2:19:39] the devil tried to destroy you but God's
[2:19:43] not into losing business
[2:19:45] and I want to tell you every time your
[2:19:47] enemy tries to defeat you just go back
[2:19:50] and said hey you couldn't destroy me
[2:19:52] back there you can't have me now
[2:20:10] is he your God too
[2:20:13] these are your God too
[2:20:15] no I suffer
[2:20:21] is you your God too
[2:20:24] you see your God too
[2:20:27] you don't need nobody to discern your
[2:20:29] problem you don't need nobody to tell
[2:20:30] you what your name is
[2:20:33] your God
[2:20:40] when it looks like you're bankrupt and
[2:20:42] you can't make it through another dollar
[2:20:45] feels like the devil's whispering in
[2:20:47] your ear
[2:20:48] I don't know how you're going to make it
[2:20:49] through tomorrow
[2:20:51] listen my God owns the cattle in a
[2:20:53] thousand hills
[2:20:56] [Applause]
[2:21:21] of the Downham police she's going to be
[2:21:22] well
[2:21:25] I just believe she's going to be around
[2:21:42] the first year we had this meeting here
[2:21:45] brother Sean asked me to come
[2:21:49] yep
[2:21:51] and I was praying
[2:21:53] on our farm area
[2:21:56] I said Lord I don't know what to speak
[2:21:58] and he said you speak these words
[2:22:01] this is the Lord's doing
[2:22:05] and it is marvelous
[2:22:10] mother Sean I don't care how much the
[2:22:11] devil wrestles against it God has voted
[2:22:14] for it
[2:22:36] you've been wrestling to be wrestling
[2:22:38] with your own gift
[2:22:41] the devil's been intimidated you
[2:22:44] he's been telling you you're a failure
[2:22:46] isn't that right
[2:22:48] isn't that right
[2:22:50] but I want to tell that devil look
[2:22:52] around
[2:22:55] look around
[2:22:57] God told you
[2:23:00] your daddy didn't call you your mama
[2:23:02] didn't call you
[2:23:04] the place that gift in your life
[2:23:06] God's not gonna take it away from you
[2:23:10] Sean Martin God placed that gift there
[2:23:12] and there's not enough intimidation of
[2:23:15] hell
[2:23:17] they'll give us nothing but a liar
[2:23:20] [Applause]
[2:23:35] [Applause]

[2:24:27] different man
[2:24:33] when you went home with a different man
[2:24:35] sister Betty
[2:24:39] God took him home and he
[2:24:40] he gave you a second chance at love
[2:24:42] brother Luther

[2:24:47] bell of Tears
[2:24:49] and you got a new best friend
[2:24:58] I wish you could see what I see now
[2:25:01] I just wish you could see
[2:25:06] no I'm not trying to make you think I'm
[2:25:08] something special
[2:25:10] I'm wondering I'm wanting to introduce
[2:25:12] you to the greatest of all time
[2:25:21] now
[2:25:27] many years ago my grandfather owned this
[2:25:30] property
[2:25:31] be on this property
[2:25:33] he decided to sell it
[2:25:36] but my grandma had a vision of who
[2:25:39] Elijah was
[2:25:42] and when my daddy gave her a book
[2:25:45] of the way of the true Prophet one to
[2:25:48] which I carry every day
[2:25:52] back then they had brother Brandon's
[2:25:54] picture on the inside of it
[2:25:57] and when she opened the book she said
[2:25:58] that's Elijah that's who I saw in a
[2:26:01] vision
[2:26:02] that's him I believe this message she'd
[2:26:04] never the first word
[2:26:08] my granddad tried to sell this property
[2:26:10] had a huge auction about 300 people was
[2:26:13] here to buy this property
[2:26:15] God stopped the auction
[2:26:20] because we needed to have this meeting
[2:26:39] around this Bend there's a white house
[2:26:41] it's cinder block I think they've got it
[2:26:43] covered over now
[2:26:47] there was a man came to our house I was
[2:26:50] four years old
[2:26:54] and he was hungry
[2:26:56] and asked if there was anything to eat
[2:27:00] and my mom had gravy and biscuits on the
[2:27:02] stove all Christians have gravy and
[2:27:05] biscuits
[2:27:11] ought to have been the best day man in
[2:27:12] the house
[2:27:15] and she fed that man gravy and biscuits
[2:27:22] he had that completion right there
[2:27:25] brother Diego raise your hand

[2:27:49] but it sure does to me
[2:27:52] but what has made this meeting special
[2:27:55] under this tent
[2:28:00] that was 58 years ago
[2:28:03] and while brother Wendell Martin was
[2:28:05] preaching
[2:28:08] thirsty
[2:28:09] Thursday night
[2:28:11] as he was preaching and saying his
[2:28:13] throat was bad his voice was bad
[2:28:16] the enemy was fighting
[2:28:18] that angel that I saw at four years old
[2:28:21] was standing right there
