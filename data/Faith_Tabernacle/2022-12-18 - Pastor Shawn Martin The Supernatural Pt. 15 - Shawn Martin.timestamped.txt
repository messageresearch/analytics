[42:45] the sweetest
[42:48] [Music]
[42:54] I'm so glad that we're able just to love
[42:56] him
[42:58] I think that's just a miracle in itself
[43:01] that we could stand in this day
[43:04] of people's rights and
[43:06] where the Bible is prophesied that men
[43:10] would become lovers pleasure lovers of
[43:12] their own selves more than lovers of God
[43:15] and yet we defy all of that
[43:19] and love him
[43:21] we love him that's a paradox
[43:24] amen How could a person with all the
[43:26] pleasure
[43:27] all the things that are around us the
[43:30] most evil age the greatest age where sin
[43:34] is
[43:35] and yet love the Lord
[43:37] amen but I do love him
[43:40] I thank the Lord for his goodness his
[43:42] grace amen and the musicians can be
[43:46] dismissed and certainly good to be in
[43:49] the house of the Lord this morning

[43:55] several that are out sick or out of town
[43:58] and but
[44:01] I'm just glad we was able to come
[44:04] amen and it's good to have my sister and
[44:08] um
[44:10] Chicana with us this morning amen and
[44:15] thoroughly enjoyed both songs
[44:18] amen and enjoyed all the songs today and
[44:23] but you'll be leaving right after

[44:28] our prayer that she has a safe trip back
[44:33] home and we're getting ready to head for
[44:35] Canada
[44:36] so I think it's cold here but uh they're
[44:39] really going to get in some cold weather

[48:16] without you believing through US lord
[48:18] it's it's your faith that you give to us
[48:22] and father how thankful we are Lord and
[48:26] we just ask that you would take complete
[48:29] control
[48:30] let this service be yours and in your
[48:34] hand father move not only for in the
[48:37] speaker but move in The Believer father
[48:40] oh God just have your way we invite you
[48:43] Lord
[48:45] to do anything that you would want
[48:47] father
[48:48] we ask these things in your lovely name
[48:51] Jesus Christ and the church says
[48:54] amen and amen you can have your seats
[48:58] this morning
[48:59] and I'm going to continue
[49:02] on the subject that been speaking on
[49:05] and
[49:07] and using the title the supernatural I I
[49:10] believe that this this uh title is is
[49:15] relevant to what we are speaking about
[49:18] for the Church of the Living God is the
[49:21] supernatural it is Supernatural brother
[49:24] Brown said it's a supernatural body that
[49:27] men and women are born into by the Holy
[49:29] Spirit
[49:30] and its simple way
[49:33] so these men and women that are part of
[49:37] the body they believe in the
[49:38] Supernatural because they've had a
[49:41] supernatural experience for themselves
[49:44] and and so what we talk about it's we
[49:49] know it's a reality we know that angels
[49:51] are real we we we know that the spirit
[49:54] of God is real we know that God can do
[49:58] anything that he wants to do and it's a
[50:02] supernatural power that's holding us up
[50:04] it's everything about our Christian walk
[50:07] is Supernatural I think even just our
[50:10] families God keeping our families
[50:13] together it's a supernatural thing
[50:16] uh keeping our mind intact it's a
[50:19] supernatural thing everything it's it's
[50:22] just Supernatural and I and I thank God
[50:25] for that it the supernatural cannot be
[50:28] explained and so we dare not try to to
[50:31] explain it in in any way we just believe
[50:34] it
[50:35] a man can explain how the
[50:41] happen and we believe it can't can't
[50:44] explain how a man could stand there and
[50:47] call the son to stand still but but it
[50:49] did it and we believe that
[50:51] can't explain a lot of things can't
[50:53] explain you know how man could be in the
[50:56] woods and speak a squirrel into
[50:58] existence but it did it it happened and
[51:01] and we believe them things and so God is
[51:05] Supernatural and there is no way to
[51:08] explain God or his ways uh uh Isaiah 55
[51:12] 9 says for as the heavens are higher
[51:15] than the earth so are my ways higher
[51:18] than your ways and my thoughts than your
[51:21] thoughts and and so this is why we come
[51:24] uh to service this morning and we come
[51:29] with great expectation and no doubt that
[51:32] you're battling with things and no doubt
[51:34] you're facing things that just seem to
[51:36] be impossible but it doesn't stop us
[51:39] coming with victory in our heart it
[51:41] doesn't stop us coming with praise on
[51:44] our lips because we believe in the
[51:47] Supernatural we may not be able to
[51:49] explain how it's going to happen but God
[51:51] is going to move we we may not be able
[51:54] to explain when it's going to happen but
[51:56] God's going to move
[51:58] and there ain't no obstacle that we face
[52:00] that is going to hinder God from doing
[52:02] it for he is Supernatural and we believe
[52:06] in the Supernatural because the
[52:09] Supernatural is us that's that's it
[52:12] follows us it's with us every every day
[52:15] that we're that we're maintaining a
[52:18] Christian Life That's a CR that's a
[52:20] supernatural thing
[52:22] I I hope you understand that it's God
[52:25] that's holding you and not you holding
[52:27] yourself it's God that desire I I you
[52:31] know when we pray as a family I always
[52:33] thank God for waking us up uh in our
[52:36] right minds and giving us a heart to
[52:39] serve him because you know how else can
[52:42] you have that desire it's a supernatural
[52:45] thing and we must never ever take them
[52:48] things for granted now we've been
[52:50] talking about the Pentecost and and the
[52:53] day of Pentecost and I you know what
[52:57] happened on the day of Pentecost cannot
[52:59] be explained it was the supernatural
[53:02] birth of the Church of the Living God
[53:06] and God God supernaturally planted that
[53:10] little Pentecostal seed that day and and
[53:14] brother Branham called it that little
[53:16] seed of Pentecost and now you know uh
[53:21] and I'm just going to take my time this
[53:23] morning and and talk uh to you but my
[53:26] reason for for speaking on this subject
[53:30] is to show that we're part of that
[53:33] church and even though we've got nearly
[53:37] 2 000 years of separation between that
[53:41] time and and and and and us now but we
[53:45] are still linked to that that first
[53:48] church we are are still linked and and
[53:52] all I can say it's still Supernatural it
[53:55] was It's Supernatural because we as you
[53:58] study the church ages the seals and and
[54:01] you know the history of it and how far
[54:04] the church has gone and and and these
[54:08] things and I you know I've I I had it at
[54:11] one time I had uh a series of DVDs
[54:16] um that uh uh I can't even remember the
[54:19] title of it now but it was about Israel
[54:21] in The Six Day War and and all the
[54:24] battles and how that God fought the
[54:26] battles for them and and and things like
[54:29] that and and they said that they're the
[54:32] only people they're the only people out
[54:35] of all these years and and it was Jews
[54:37] that was uh doing some talking there and
[54:41] and you know out of all the years of
[54:43] being scattered in the world they're the
[54:46] only people that still has their
[54:47] original language that has been
[54:50] scattered out in the world and yet they
[54:52] come back and they have their original
[54:55] language that they speak and and and
[54:58] they were talking just how amazing that
[55:01] was well I say It's Supernatural
[55:04] I'd say It's Supernatural they they even
[55:07] say that you know that that they they
[55:09] don't really even know the 12th tribe of
[55:12] Israel and all of that but you know what
[55:14] God does
[55:15] and they're supernaturally going to come
[55:17] together there's going to be 12 what 12
[55:20] 000 out of each tribe that's going to
[55:22] come and there ain't going to be one
[55:24] less or one more twelve thousand out of
[55:27] each tribe of those 12 tribes are going
[55:29] to make it do you believe that and and
[55:32] and and we can't explain it we can't put
[55:35] science to it all we know it'll be a
[55:38] supernatural work well I believe it's
[55:41] the same thing it's a supernatural
[55:43] happening what began on the day of
[55:45] Pentecost was a supernatural thing and
[55:48] we can find that the supernatural has
[55:51] been following us all the way through
[55:52] and it's here with us today
[55:55] and so that's that's my focus and
[55:58] brother random says if Pentecost was
[56:00] God's Vine which was a the new Vine that
[56:04] has grown up then these four destroyers
[56:07] has been the one that's eat the vine
[56:10] down now let's find out what Pentecost
[56:13] had and find out what we got lacking and
[56:17] then we ought to find out what the
[56:19] Destroyers are and who they are ain't
[56:22] that right
[56:23] so the day of Pentecost is not only my
[56:26] focus but it's the whole the whole
[56:29] beginning of the church or the first
[56:31] church uh uh there to see what happened
[56:34] in the church that first church after
[56:37] the day of Pentecost because again we're
[56:40] tied to that church a man and so we know
[56:45] again that the day of Pentecost was the
[56:48] birth or the inauguration of the church
[56:51] and and and a great thing happened on
[56:55] that day it was a it again a
[56:58] supernatural thing uh but did the
[57:01] disciples go back to being what they
[57:03] were
[57:04] uh what they were before the day of
[57:07] Pentecost or did something continue with
[57:11] them
[57:12] now I I just happen to believe that
[57:15] something changed them
[57:16] that that when they left that Upper Room
[57:19] something
[57:21] followed them the rest of their lives
[57:25] uh uh it changed Peter from a cow or to
[57:29] a to a having boldness ain't that right
[57:32] and and it it changed their whole lives
[57:36] and so what that experience that that
[57:39] they received
[57:41] supernaturally changed them
[57:44] same body same same person but yet
[57:48] something changed them inside of them
[57:52] and so you know uh um we we find that
[57:56] some people have uh something happened
[57:59] to them in a service but then afterwards
[58:02] they go right back into the same muck
[58:04] and mire and they they go back into the
[58:07] same pit that they they came from uh
[58:11] that go back to being the same person
[58:13] that they were before well that's not
[58:15] what happened on the day of Pentecost
[58:18] you understand what I'm saying some go
[58:21] for a little while and and they're and
[58:24] and and you think okay well let's let's
[58:26] give them some time let's see what
[58:28] happens and then they go right back into
[58:30] the same routine uh that that they were
[58:34] before uh they they received that
[58:36] so-called experience and and they might
[58:39] have received an experience but I'm
[58:40] talking about a supernatural experience
[58:43] that happened on the day of Pentecost
[58:45] can you say man and and and and and a
[58:48] lot of them don't even go all the way
[58:50] back in the world but what they do do is
[58:52] they become mediocre Christians they
[58:55] become lukewarm Christian they they
[58:57] maintain a a a a a spot in the church
[59:01] they they maintained that part they
[59:04] maintain rituals of religion but when it
[59:08] comes to really being on fire for God
[59:11] something happens and and I have to tell
[59:14] you a man that's not what happened with
[59:17] Peter you never find Peter becoming
[59:19] lukewarm you never find Paul becoming
[59:21] lukewarm you never find the 120 being
[59:25] lukewarm you just never found that
[59:27] because they received and experience uh
[59:31] of God that no man could ever explain
[59:34] and no man could take it away from them
[59:37] can you say man and and and so after
[59:40] after the day of Pentecost did did these
[59:43] people become some Scholars of of and
[59:47] educators of the Bible did they promote
[59:50] psychology after the day of Pentecost
[59:53] did they become professors of
[59:55] Christianity without the supernatural
[59:58] following them or uh are are they the
[1:00:02] only ones that received a Pentecostal
[1:00:04] experience and then all of their
[1:00:07] converts that they won to Christ all
[1:00:09] they had to do was just believe and say
[1:00:11] you got it I just believe I just believe
[1:00:13] uh uh did they teach that there was a
[1:00:16] certain way to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:00:18] did all their converts have to do what
[1:00:21] they did when they received it you
[1:00:23] understand so so there's a lot of
[1:00:26] questions uh you know uh uh that I would
[1:00:29] have uh uh I I just don't believe that
[1:00:32] they became educators of the Bible I
[1:00:35] just don't believe that they become just
[1:00:37] uh uh uh philosophers of the Bible I
[1:00:40] don't believe that they promoted
[1:00:41] psychology to the people after the they
[1:00:44] received the Holy Ghost I just don't
[1:00:47] believe that they taught that you had to
[1:00:49] have do a certain thing and be a certain
[1:00:52] way in order to receive it can you say
[1:00:55] amen amen the Bible doesn't teach any
[1:00:58] certain way that a man had to receive
[1:01:00] the holy ghost that comes later through
[1:01:03] denominational teachings that that there
[1:01:06] has to be a certain way a certain
[1:01:08] criteria a certain thing all Peter said
[1:01:11] to them was repent be baptized in the
[1:01:14] name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:01:16] everybody say you shall you shall
[1:01:19] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he
[1:01:21] didn't say repent be baptized and you
[1:01:23] come to me and I'll I'll teach you how
[1:01:25] to get the Holy Ghost or or you repent
[1:01:28] and you be baptized and then you come to
[1:01:30] the altar amen and you'll receive the
[1:01:32] Holy Ghost he said you shall receive the
[1:01:34] gift of the Holy Ghost repent can you
[1:01:37] say amen and and so we we find that we
[1:01:41] you know there were people in the Bible
[1:01:43] that received the Holy he goes just by
[1:01:45] through the preaching of the word they
[1:01:48] were just setting in their Pew hearing
[1:01:50] the Minister preach the word and they
[1:01:52] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:55] can you say man today you know uh and
[1:01:58] then you find even in the Bible where
[1:02:00] where not everybody received the Holy
[1:02:03] Ghost that way for you find that there
[1:02:05] was others that had hands laid upon them
[1:02:08] and they received the the Holy Ghost
[1:02:11] amen but one thing about it they
[1:02:13] received the same experience that Peter
[1:02:16] received and the Mary received and and
[1:02:19] and the the rest of the 120 receipt they
[1:02:22] received the same experience they were
[1:02:25] changed forever and ever can you say
[1:02:29] Amen well today some have have received
[1:02:32] at least by setting in their seat I I
[1:02:34] remember my my uncle little will he was
[1:02:37] little a year older than I was I believe
[1:02:40] he was or a little older but anyway but
[1:02:43] but um you know he had no emotions
[1:02:46] whatsoever you know and and he hated
[1:02:49] church he hated well he despised God and
[1:02:53] and and just uh he he was something else
[1:02:56] but one day God got a hold of him and
[1:02:58] and he he uh he called Wendell you know
[1:03:02] during the night uh I don't know two in
[1:03:04] the morning or so wanting to get get
[1:03:06] saved so Wendell Wendell led him to
[1:03:09] Christ and and
[1:03:11] um that's all Nathan talked about was
[1:03:12] the Lord just the Lord the lord lord
[1:03:14] well and then you know about that time
[1:03:16] in the morning three in the morning he
[1:03:18] Wendell gets the phone call and and and
[1:03:21] and uh it's Nathan you know uh I've been
[1:03:24] reading the Bible and I and and I want
[1:03:26] to get baptized you know I got to get
[1:03:27] baptized you know and Wendell says now
[1:03:30] yeah now well Nathan lived an hour and a
[1:03:32] hour away I think or a little over from
[1:03:36] where Wendell was and when was well
[1:03:38] can't we wait in this can we wait until
[1:03:40] tomorrow he said no I want to get
[1:03:42] baptized right now you know so he's well
[1:03:44] you just come on up then we'll we'll go
[1:03:46] to the lake you know so they baptized
[1:03:49] him you know but every time he come to
[1:03:50] church he just sit there he just is not
[1:03:52] on the law you know and but he was
[1:03:54] interested but he was just you know he
[1:03:57] just he just said it and he listened you
[1:03:59] know and uh I remember Wendell you know
[1:04:02] we was in a little church but window was
[1:04:04] preaching you know and and just out of
[1:04:07] the clear blue Nathan he jumped straight
[1:04:09] out of that chair out of that seat
[1:04:12] I got it got it you know and he starts
[1:04:15] yelling and and it scared all of us you
[1:04:18] know we we all
[1:04:19] Lord have mercy you know and he's I got
[1:04:23] it and fine window just stops and Nathan
[1:04:26] okay that's good what did you get
[1:04:30] a holy ghost you know and and and that
[1:04:33] young man was changed forever so so we
[1:04:36] we've seen that that that people have
[1:04:39] received it sitting in their seat some
[1:04:42] have received it at the altar some have
[1:04:44] received it in the woods some is
[1:04:46] received it in their car Dad talks about
[1:04:48] how he received it you know in the car
[1:04:50] him and mom was going to go on a date
[1:04:51] mom had the Holy Ghost you know and and
[1:04:54] so uh he uh he he he was ready to go on
[1:04:57] that date you know and Mom said during
[1:05:00] can you turn off that car for a moment
[1:05:01] and and so he turns off the car and he
[1:05:04] she says I want to ask you Darren do you
[1:05:07] have the Holy Ghost and and dad said it
[1:05:09] was just like water just throwing water
[1:05:11] in his face you know just like
[1:05:13] huh
[1:05:14] you know do you have the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:18] he's you know after after thinking I
[1:05:21] don't guess I do well Mom Mom prayed him
[1:05:23] through to the Holy Ghost in that car
[1:05:25] and and and so uh so you you can you
[1:05:28] know some people have received it in the
[1:05:30] prayer line you know some have received
[1:05:33] it out in the woods or at their home or
[1:05:35] whatever see so so it it there's no
[1:05:38] there's no definite way as to get the
[1:05:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost but we do know
[1:05:44] when it comes it'll be a supernatural
[1:05:46] thing so again Peter just lays this out
[1:05:49] repent be baptized and you shall receive
[1:05:52] the gift of the Holy Ghost so many
[1:05:55] people put the focus on how it's done uh
[1:05:59] where it's done when it's done you
[1:06:02] understand there are some Churches you
[1:06:04] know in the apostolic that they have
[1:06:05] Holy Ghost not and it's always on Sunday
[1:06:07] night you know that if you want the Holy
[1:06:09] Ghost come Sunday night you know and and
[1:06:11] and and and and but but you don't have
[1:06:13] to get it on a Sunday night you can get
[1:06:15] it right now on Sunday morning you know
[1:06:17] but but there's no way you know but but
[1:06:20] so we we focus on things of of how
[1:06:24] things are done or whatever you know
[1:06:25] brother Bram even talks about the group
[1:06:27] that baptizes three times four and the
[1:06:29] other group baptizes three three times
[1:06:32] backward and and they become so rigid
[1:06:35] about these things that that that that
[1:06:38] that that God can't move among them amen
[1:06:41] you understand what I'm saying so now if
[1:06:44] if a man uh does not truly repent then
[1:06:48] there's no power in water baptism no
[1:06:52] matter what you do you understand what
[1:06:54] I'm saying and I'm not saying it's the
[1:06:56] water baptism that saves you but I'm
[1:06:58] just telling you it does you no good
[1:07:00] amen to to to uh to get baptized if if
[1:07:04] you're not truly repentant in your heart
[1:07:07] but you know what if a man truly repents
[1:07:10] he can actually get the Holy Ghost
[1:07:13] before he gets baptized
[1:07:16] hello so the repentance is the is the
[1:07:20] main thing
[1:07:21] get the repentance if you truly repent
[1:07:25] actually get the Holy Ghost before you
[1:07:28] even get baptized acts 10 45 and they
[1:07:31] have the circumcision which believed
[1:07:34] were astonished as many came with Peter
[1:07:36] and uh because that on the Gentiles also
[1:07:40] was poured out the gift of the Holy
[1:07:42] Ghost for they heard them speak with
[1:07:44] tongues and magnify God then answered
[1:07:48] Peter can any man forbid water that
[1:07:51] these should not be baptized which have
[1:07:53] received the Holy Ghost as well as we
[1:07:55] and he commanded them to be baptized in
[1:07:59] the name of the Lord now if if if they
[1:08:02] got to quote with me but I'm uh and it
[1:08:05] may not be verbatim but brother Bram
[1:08:07] said God will fill a man with the Holy
[1:08:08] Ghost knowing he will get baptized he
[1:08:12] will get baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:08:14] Christ can you say amen amen that's
[1:08:17] right and and so we we find a man that
[1:08:21] you don't have to wait for a certain
[1:08:23] order uh for the supernatural God to
[1:08:27] come and fill your life ain't that right
[1:08:30] now we know that the people in the upper
[1:08:33] room that 120 had to wait but they had
[1:08:36] to wait until the day of Pentecost had
[1:08:39] fully come ain't that right so they were
[1:08:42] up there 10 days before Pentecost uh the
[1:08:46] the day of Pentecost was fully come so
[1:08:49] they had to wait amen but in in this
[1:08:52] time or or even in the Bible after the
[1:08:55] day of Pentecost did one person have to
[1:08:57] wait a man to receive the baptism of the
[1:09:00] Holy Ghost it wasn't that way amen and
[1:09:04] and if you want the Holy Ghost this
[1:09:05] morning you say well I need the Holy
[1:09:07] Ghost well if you need it you can have
[1:09:09] it right now now that that's just the
[1:09:11] way it is and that's Bible that that
[1:09:13] that that's what it is because uh uh oh
[1:09:17] if you could understand amen that God
[1:09:19] already saw the names before the
[1:09:21] foundation of the world a man who would
[1:09:24] receive the Holy Ghost and he had
[1:09:26] already planned to give the Holy Ghost
[1:09:28] you understand what I'm saying that that
[1:09:30] was part of his plan so you're not
[1:09:32] waiting on God to do anything brother
[1:09:34] Branham even talks about it you know
[1:09:36] that that he said I used to you know
[1:09:38] used to we could teach it in such a way
[1:09:40] that you get that person to repent and
[1:09:42] they get baptized as soon as they come
[1:09:44] out of the water they receive the
[1:09:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost a well you see
[1:09:48] there's no time for waiting it's really
[1:09:51] upon the person's heart can you say man
[1:09:53] the condition of Faith a man and so uh
[1:09:58] uh because brother Brown says God
[1:09:59] forgives you the Holy Ghost when he
[1:10:01] recognizes your faith ain't that right
[1:10:03] amen see recognizes your face so it's
[1:10:06] not God Amen if you're not gotten the
[1:10:09] Holy Ghost you say well I've repented
[1:10:10] I've I've gotten baptized in Jesus name
[1:10:13] and and I still ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:10:15] well then there's something wrong there
[1:10:16] amen is just plain and simple there's
[1:10:18] something wrong
[1:10:20] can you say amen amen that's that's
[1:10:22] right see now now notice what was it
[1:10:26] that the 120 received on the day of
[1:10:29] Pentecost a man in the main Foundation
[1:10:32] of what they received is Luke 24 49
[1:10:36] behold I send the promise of my father
[1:10:39] upon you but tarry ye in the city of
[1:10:42] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:10:45] from on high amen acts 1 8 but you shall
[1:10:50] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[1:10:53] has come upon you and you shall be
[1:10:56] Witnesses unto me so that power the Holy
[1:11:00] Ghost the power they receive made them
[1:11:03] Witnesses unto him both in Jerusalem and
[1:11:06] all judeans uh Samara and unto the
[1:11:09] outermost parts of the earth even today
[1:11:11] ain't that right so they receive power
[1:11:14] not from a bishop not from a Creed not
[1:11:16] from a denomination not from the pope it
[1:11:19] received power we're from on high it was
[1:11:22] a supernatural happening a supernatural
[1:11:24] event amen the prophet said the power of
[1:11:28] God took over the church on the day of
[1:11:32] Pentecost can you say man and that power
[1:11:35] is still taken over the church today
[1:11:38] we're part of that church you're not
[1:11:40] lacking power the power is here do you
[1:11:44] believe that yes sir if you're part of
[1:11:46] that body amen so we we find that any
[1:11:50] other time that a person received the
[1:11:53] Holy Ghost after the day of Pentecost
[1:11:55] they received the same power that they
[1:11:59] received on the day of Pentecost brother
[1:12:01] Branham called this power quickening
[1:12:04] power another place he called it
[1:12:06] Pentecostal power amen but whatever
[1:12:09] power it was it's the same power that's
[1:12:12] here today amen and so a person that
[1:12:15] really receives the Holy Ghost today
[1:12:17] that same power is is with them in them
[1:12:22] changing their lives do you believe that
[1:12:26] now the Bible gives us insight as to
[1:12:30] what took place on the day of Pentecost
[1:12:33] in Acts 2 and 2 and suddenly there came
[1:12:36] a sound from Heaven as of a rushing
[1:12:39] Mighty Wind and it filled all the house
[1:12:43] where they were sitting and there
[1:12:46] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[1:12:49] as a fire and it set upon each of them
[1:12:53] ain't that right and they were all
[1:12:56] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:12:58] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[1:13:01] gave them utterance so now according to
[1:13:05] the message of the hour this is an
[1:13:07] account which describes the order in
[1:13:11] which the Holy Ghost came on the day of
[1:13:14] Pentecost first thing that happened a
[1:13:17] wind came into the room ain't that right
[1:13:20] AI that when was the presence of God
[1:13:23] coming amen the second thing that
[1:13:25] happened there appeared cloven or
[1:13:28] divided everybody say divided
[1:13:31] cloven tongues or divided tongues of
[1:13:35] fire that appeared to them ain't that
[1:13:38] right now now the prophet said it didn't
[1:13:40] say divided tongues were in them a man
[1:13:44] or they didn't speak in divided tongues
[1:13:47] see they weren't doing that but divided
[1:13:50] tongues appear to them ain't that right
[1:13:53] now brother Brown said see it's not on
[1:13:55] them yet but it's there in the room with
[1:13:59] them circling around like in the wind I
[1:14:02] I I liked uh if you if if you get a
[1:14:05] chance if you hadn't listened to it or
[1:14:07] been a while go back and listen to God
[1:14:10] hiding himself in Simplicity they're in
[1:14:12] Albuquerque and the the the last I think
[1:14:16] 40 minutes of the sermon brother Brandon
[1:14:18] begins to talk to them about those that
[1:14:20] wanted to receive the Holy Ghost and and
[1:14:23] and uh he had them to stand up and just
[1:14:26] begin to praise the Lord and he he told
[1:14:28] now just Just Praise the Lord forget
[1:14:29] about everything just just begin to
[1:14:31] Praise Him and the people began to
[1:14:33] praise him and and people begin to
[1:14:35] scream and he said now see that's the
[1:14:37] Holy Ghost that's the Holy Ghost and and
[1:14:39] and and at one place he he he he called
[1:14:42] I think brother Shakira and he said
[1:14:44] brother Karen can you can you see that
[1:14:46] pillar fire going from wall to wall and
[1:14:48] he said no brother Brandon I can't see
[1:14:50] that well brother Branham could see that
[1:14:52] the pillar of fire was not in them
[1:14:54] people yet uh uh but it was in the room
[1:14:58] with them can you say Amen it was in the
[1:15:02] room and it was looking for someone just
[1:15:04] to surrender it was it was actually
[1:15:06] looking for someone just to be so
[1:15:08] yielded and you'd find it where he says
[1:15:11] now look look look look it's coming down
[1:15:12] on that sister pal you know and and
[1:15:15] you'd hear her uh uh reaction to that
[1:15:18] and and so they they anyway it's it's
[1:15:21] interesting you need to go and listen to
[1:15:24] that but here so the the pillar fire was
[1:15:28] in the room clothing tongues a fire was
[1:15:32] in the room circling around like in the
[1:15:36] wind and and so it was tongues the
[1:15:39] prophet said like fire that appeared to
[1:15:41] them and it rested on them ain't that
[1:15:46] right it didn't go in them as of yet but
[1:15:49] it rested upon them now the King James
[1:15:53] version tells us that it's set up on
[1:15:56] each of them and the prophet said how
[1:15:58] could it set you know set on them but it
[1:16:02] rested on them can you say Amen see it
[1:16:06] he says that's incorrect because it
[1:16:08] couldn't go up there and sit down but
[1:16:11] the original says it rested up on each
[1:16:14] of them a tongue of fire a tongue of
[1:16:18] fire set upon or rested upon each of
[1:16:21] them 120 people can you say amen and the
[1:16:25] next things that happen is they were all
[1:16:29] filled with the Holy Ghost ain't that
[1:16:32] right now so what was it the
[1:16:35] supernatural life came into them God
[1:16:39] divided himself up into them people that
[1:16:42] and that was the goal that was part of
[1:16:44] God's drama God's plan was to live in
[1:16:48] his people amen not for the people to
[1:16:51] say I've got something and they ain't
[1:16:52] got it that God to literally come into
[1:16:56] them and you will know that it would
[1:16:58] come is because it would change them it
[1:17:01] would Quicken them it would it would
[1:17:03] make them so different that they became
[1:17:06] oddballs they no longer tried to just uh
[1:17:09] uh uh float around with the world they
[1:17:11] they no longer tried to fit in society
[1:17:14] God wouldn't let them fit in society God
[1:17:17] wouldn't let them just float around he
[1:17:19] was in charge of them he's the one that
[1:17:22] quickened that mortal body can you say
[1:17:24] Amen they were no longer trying to be
[1:17:27] and fit in with the crowd and rub
[1:17:29] shoulders with everybody amen they were
[1:17:31] so changed that the world recognized
[1:17:35] well didn't didn't someone say about
[1:17:37] them having these men turned the world
[1:17:39] upside down Peter gave his life every
[1:17:43] one of them gave their lives for this
[1:17:45] gospel they didn't care they didn't it
[1:17:47] didn't matter amen they could threaten
[1:17:49] them they could whatever amen but they
[1:17:52] willfully gave their lives because they
[1:17:55] were quickened by the Holy Spirit
[1:17:58] they were Quicken and notice they were
[1:18:02] all filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[1:18:05] began to speak with other tongues as the
[1:18:09] spirit gave them utterance and there
[1:18:12] were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout
[1:18:16] men out of every nation under heaven now
[1:18:20] when this was nosed abroad the multitude
[1:18:22] came together and were confounded
[1:18:25] because that every man heard them speak
[1:18:28] in his own language ain't that right now
[1:18:33] this doesn't give us any other account
[1:18:35] as to what happened as far as I know uh
[1:18:39] what happened on the day of Pentecost or
[1:18:42] uh uh or what happened in the upper room
[1:18:45] and when they came out of that room that
[1:18:48] day then just what I read to you amen so
[1:18:51] so it's it's it's kind of uh that that's
[1:18:55] just what you read right there well then
[1:18:57] we find that brother Branham gives us
[1:18:59] different accounts as to what happened
[1:19:02] on that day uh here brother Brown said
[1:19:05] they wasn't talking they wasn't
[1:19:06] jabbering they wasn't doing nothing but
[1:19:08] just making a noise
[1:19:11] cloven tongues sat upon them as if it
[1:19:14] was fire oh they couldn't hold
[1:19:17] themselves and they were all filled with
[1:19:22] the Holy Ghost ain't that right another
[1:19:25] place when God poured in his life into
[1:19:27] the first branch of the tree that tree
[1:19:30] began to act like drunken people they
[1:19:33] staggered under the impact of the spirit
[1:19:35] lovely holy little women like the Virgin
[1:19:39] Mary out there acting like she was drunk
[1:19:42] for she was drunk up on the spirit and
[1:19:45] she tried to talk and she could not
[1:19:48] now whether that's in the up room I
[1:19:50] don't know he said out there so I don't
[1:19:53] know if that's in the upper room or out
[1:19:54] of the upper room it don't matter to me
[1:19:56] see so she tried to talk and she could
[1:19:59] not she had stammering lips which means
[1:20:03] cloven just a stammer in other places
[1:20:06] brother Brandon said stammering is
[1:20:08] stuttering
[1:20:09] trying to say something but but but but
[1:20:11] but but but but but but can't
[1:20:16] so trying to say something she was so
[1:20:20] full of the holy spirit that she
[1:20:22] couldn't say it
[1:20:24] see stammering lives and all of a sudden
[1:20:27] with another language they spoke out
[1:20:31] ain't that right so that's an account
[1:20:34] that brother Brown gives us so they
[1:20:36] notice if they were stammering couldn't
[1:20:38] say anything they were so impacted by
[1:20:42] the spirit of God
[1:20:44] so wrapped up that and and quickened
[1:20:47] that they couldn't say nothing they're
[1:20:49] just stammering and then all of a sudden
[1:20:51] they begin to speak in another language
[1:20:55] now in another count that brother
[1:20:57] Branham gives of it he said what was
[1:21:00] more of a mess than a dignified bunch of
[1:21:03] Jews that day than to see these people
[1:21:06] coming out there with stammering lips
[1:21:11] so here they're coming out now of the
[1:21:14] upper room they've been filled with Holy
[1:21:16] Ghost they come out staggering out of
[1:21:19] the upper room and they're just
[1:21:21] stammering they're making noises they're
[1:21:23] they're they're they're not making any
[1:21:25] sense to these people
[1:21:27] you understand what I'm saying now so
[1:21:29] now to me it doesn't matter whether it
[1:21:31] was in the room or outside of the room I
[1:21:34] just believe that they stammered
[1:21:36] stuttered and they spoke in another
[1:21:37] language
[1:21:38] and what they'd done is exactly what the
[1:21:42] Bible says would happen there in Isaiah
[1:21:45] 28 and 10 for preset must be upon
[1:21:48] precept precept upon precept lying up on
[1:21:51] line line up online here a little there
[1:21:54] a little for with stammering lips
[1:21:56] everybody say with stammering lips and
[1:21:59] another tongue will he speak to this
[1:22:02] people to whom he said this is the rest
[1:22:04] wherewith you may cause the weary to
[1:22:07] rest and this is the refreshing yet they
[1:22:11] would not hear well they had stammering
[1:22:14] lips and other tongues ain't that right
[1:22:17] brother Brown said when they completely
[1:22:19] surrendered and gave theirselves over to
[1:22:22] God God gave them a Pentecostal reality
[1:22:26] now church God will give you that too
[1:22:29] and I know he's given us uh several of
[1:22:32] us a Pentecostal reality and and what
[1:22:34] I'm saying is when you get the Holy
[1:22:36] Ghost you will get a Pentecostal reality
[1:22:39] now again the thing that was promised to
[1:22:42] them was you going to receive power
[1:22:44] after you received the Holy Ghost can
[1:22:47] you say Amen now the prophet said see
[1:22:50] God gave them a Pentecostal reality he
[1:22:53] led them up to Pentecost and give them
[1:22:56] the Holy Ghost so that's the Pentecost
[1:22:58] reality is receiving the baptism of the
[1:23:01] Holy Ghost God God ain't putting up with
[1:23:04] all of this nonsense of people being
[1:23:06] religious and not coming to a new birth
[1:23:09] then you say amen and as we've said
[1:23:11] before the prophet says that a new birth
[1:23:13] is messy a birth is missing can you say
[1:23:17] amen and if you don't want to act crazy
[1:23:19] then you ain't gonna get the Holy Ghost
[1:23:21] if you're going to tell God God now I'll
[1:23:23] get the Holy Ghost but I don't want to
[1:23:25] get out there and dancing that ain't my
[1:23:27] nature amen well it might be God's
[1:23:29] nature you understand what I'm saying
[1:23:31] it's God's nature coming in you and
[1:23:33] taking over this Mortal body and
[1:23:35] whatever God wants to do with you you
[1:23:37] just say God I want it no matter what
[1:23:40] happens I don't care how crazy it looks
[1:23:43] if they if they call me a drunk if they
[1:23:45] call me an idiot if they call me crazy I
[1:23:48] don't care I don't care if my friends
[1:23:50] forsake me I don't care if I get
[1:23:51] embarrassed I just don't care all I want
[1:23:54] is the reality of what they had on the
[1:23:57] day of Pentecost
[1:24:00] can you say man
[1:24:02] so see they were he says he led them up
[1:24:05] to Pentecost and give them the Holy
[1:24:07] Ghost and there where they uh there were
[1:24:11] they under the spirit of God making all
[1:24:14] kinds of foolish signs to the people
[1:24:17] stammering and stammering and carrying
[1:24:19] on see so we we know what a stammer is
[1:24:22] is someone that cannot talk plain so the
[1:24:26] Pentecostal organization teaches us that
[1:24:29] it was unknown tongues that they were
[1:24:32] speaking but we know that that was
[1:24:34] that's wrong that's that's not even
[1:24:36] right but that's the Pentecostal
[1:24:38] conception of today now I looked it up
[1:24:41] unknown tongues is something which
[1:24:44] cannot be understood without there being
[1:24:47] the gift of interpretation so that's
[1:24:50] what unknown tongues are it's something
[1:24:52] that cannot be understood without there
[1:24:56] being the gift of interpretation amen
[1:24:59] see but according to the account that is
[1:25:02] given in in uh the book of Acts and what
[1:25:06] the prophet of God said they did not
[1:25:08] speak in unknown tongues because that
[1:25:12] every man heard them speak in his own
[1:25:16] language ain't that right now we know
[1:25:19] that this was a supernatural thing in
[1:25:21] itself a man not only uh uh well because
[1:25:25] there were there were uh uh well if you
[1:25:28] look at the Bible it looks like there's
[1:25:29] about 15 different countries and there
[1:25:32] could be more uh that maybe was not
[1:25:34] mentioned I don't know but but we do
[1:25:37] know there were thousands of them there
[1:25:38] in in the city that day and there was at
[1:25:43] least 15 different nationalities of men
[1:25:46] that that uh spoke in different
[1:25:48] languages around and and so uh uh and
[1:25:53] and and so uh uh and they all said this
[1:25:56] uh there we do hear them speak in our
[1:25:59] tongues or languages
[1:26:02] uh the wonderful works of God can you
[1:26:04] say man so even brother Brown tells us
[1:26:07] the 120 was not speaking in an unknown
[1:26:10] tongue uh uh here he says cloven tongue
[1:26:14] set upon them stammering they couldn't
[1:26:17] talk they were so full of the glory
[1:26:21] Holy Ghost filled them and out in the
[1:26:24] streets they went jabbering
[1:26:27] and you say man so it was not unknown
[1:26:30] tongues that they spoke brother Ram says
[1:26:34] see we want to change that around saying
[1:26:35] they had tongues of fire and here
[1:26:37] jabbering around and then went out and
[1:26:40] began to speak with an unknown tongue
[1:26:41] there's no such a thing as that in the
[1:26:44] scriptures friend any now listen to this
[1:26:47] anyone that speaks with an unknown
[1:26:49] tongue upon receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:26:51] does it contrary to the Bible
[1:26:54] so I'm going to say that again anyone
[1:26:56] that speaks with an unknown tongue upon
[1:26:58] receiving the Holy Ghost does it
[1:27:00] contrary to the Bible
[1:27:03] can you say Amen now I'm going to be
[1:27:05] honest with you I was so confused a lot
[1:27:07] as as as when I was young because I knew
[1:27:10] I didn't speak in tongues when I
[1:27:11] received the Holy Ghost you know and and
[1:27:14] and so I you know did I did I receive
[1:27:16] the Holy Ghost did I not receive the I
[1:27:18] thought I received the Holy Ghost but I
[1:27:19] didn't speak in tongues and and it was
[1:27:21] it was a lot of confusion for me and and
[1:27:24] even I remember my brother uh uh uh had
[1:27:28] had had you know wanting the Holy Ghost
[1:27:31] so bad and trying to find the Holy Ghost
[1:27:33] trying to get the Holy Ghost trying but
[1:27:35] the main you know thing we thought was
[1:27:37] speaking in tongues and and these things
[1:27:39] but we find here thank God for a prophet
[1:27:42] that anyone that speaks with an unknown
[1:27:44] tongue upon receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:27:46] does it contrary to the Bible I believe
[1:27:50] now notice I believe in speaking in
[1:27:52] unknown tongues and so do we we believe
[1:27:55] in speaking in unknown tongues can you
[1:27:58] say Amen but not everybody say but not
[1:28:01] upon receiving the Holy Ghost pushed see
[1:28:04] that's a gift of the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:28:07] Ghost is a spirit can you say man so
[1:28:10] again modern Pentecostals say that that
[1:28:13] uh the evidence that you have the Holy
[1:28:16] Ghost is is speaking in unknown or
[1:28:19] Angelic tongues but it's contrary even
[1:28:22] to the Bible ain't that right brother
[1:28:24] Brown said they had the cart before the
[1:28:26] horse for in Acts 2 the people spoke in
[1:28:29] a perfect dialect which even unbelievers
[1:28:33] heard and understood ain't that right
[1:28:36] see so so we find uh uh the the the uh
[1:28:41] that so that's not the the evidence of
[1:28:44] the Holy Ghost unknown tongues all
[1:28:46] throughout the message there is one
[1:28:48] thing uh he gives different accounts of
[1:28:51] different things but all throughout the
[1:28:53] message there's one thing that brother
[1:28:55] Branham solidifies in our hearts and
[1:28:58] that is speaking in unknown tongues is
[1:29:00] not the evidence uh that you have the
[1:29:03] Holy Ghost can you say Amen so now the
[1:29:06] prophet we know they spoke in a dialect
[1:29:09] we know they spoke in a perfect dialect
[1:29:10] language but now what language did they
[1:29:14] speak in brother Branham actually shares
[1:29:17] different thoughts as to what language
[1:29:19] they were speaking on the day of
[1:29:21] Pentecost he says he filled them 120
[1:29:23] temples that was up there with himself
[1:29:25] with the Holy Ghost itself see the
[1:29:29] Shekinah Glory broke through upon the
[1:29:31] him uh just a moment Brother Sam can you
[1:29:34] turn that heater on it's cold I'm I'm
[1:29:37] kind of sweating a little bit up here
[1:29:38] and and it's uh it's kind of cold sorry
[1:29:42] if you're if you're burning up I it
[1:29:45] might just be preaching hell and fire
[1:29:48] and brimstone I don't know no
[1:29:49] but anyways the Shekinah Glory broke
[1:29:53] through upon them and then what Nimrod
[1:29:57] failed to do build a temple where every
[1:30:00] man spoke contrary to what he could
[1:30:02] understand so so notice that that and
[1:30:06] and and I got more quotes that I'll get
[1:30:08] into later on but brother Branham types
[1:30:12] confusion unknown tongues if unknown
[1:30:15] tongues cannot be understood in in an
[1:30:18] audience
[1:30:19] it's Babylon
[1:30:21] it's confusion that that's what it is
[1:30:23] that's why Paul would put it in order
[1:30:25] that when you're alone you speak with
[1:30:28] unknown tongues but don't speak it in
[1:30:29] before the people unless there is
[1:30:33] an interpretation to that so then what
[1:30:37] Nimrod failed to do build a temple where
[1:30:40] every man spoke contrary to what he
[1:30:43] could understand see so that that's what
[1:30:45] that's what Nimrod see he built the
[1:30:47] temple uh and God confused the language
[1:30:50] to where no one could understand what
[1:30:52] they were saying see see God came down
[1:30:56] and with one Galilean language made
[1:30:59] every man understand what he was saying
[1:31:02] and they know it was uh brought ain't
[1:31:05] that right in another place the biggest
[1:31:07] part of them was Galilean see uh uh the
[1:31:11] and for the people said are not all
[1:31:13] these galileans which speak well they
[1:31:16] could have been speaking Galilean but
[1:31:17] they were hearing them in another
[1:31:19] language it could been they were
[1:31:22] speaking another language their own
[1:31:24] language see see either way wouldn't
[1:31:27] matter now that's where we you can't get
[1:31:29] so rigid on what language they spoke in
[1:31:32] brother Brown said I really don't matter
[1:31:34] the key is it was not unknown tongues
[1:31:38] can you say Amen so whether they were
[1:31:41] speaking Chinese Greek or whatever it
[1:31:43] don't matter
[1:31:44] see and and whether they were speaking
[1:31:47] Galilean it don't matter we just know
[1:31:49] that every man heard them speak in their
[1:31:51] own language right so either way it
[1:31:55] wouldn't matter it still doesn't make
[1:31:56] the Pentecostal conception right because
[1:31:59] listen here's why not to say something
[1:32:01] different but just to set the fact
[1:32:03] straight why did Peter get up then and
[1:32:06] speak to the whole multitude and they
[1:32:07] everyone heard him in the language he
[1:32:10] was speaking for three thousand was
[1:32:12] converted of stunts Jews who were just
[1:32:16] as staunching their religion as could be
[1:32:18] but they must just understood every word
[1:32:20] Peter was uh of of Peter preaching on
[1:32:24] the prophets and so forth bringing up
[1:32:26] the Pentecost where they screamed out
[1:32:28] and said men and Brethren what can we do
[1:32:30] to be saved see and Peter said repent be
[1:32:32] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:32:35] Jesus Christ for remission of your sins
[1:32:37] ain't that right now brother Branham
[1:32:40] talks about uh an experience that
[1:32:42] happened to him and and that was I think
[1:32:45] he was in Mexico and and Billy Paul had
[1:32:49] taken him off the uh to you know taking
[1:32:52] him out and ushering him out and he was
[1:32:55] so weak and all that but he turned
[1:32:56] around and he saw a Mexican girl it was
[1:32:58] a teenager and and he said Billy I I
[1:33:02] want to talk to that girl and he said
[1:33:04] Daddy you can't you we got to get you he
[1:33:05] goes no I want to talk to that girl and
[1:33:08] so anyway made room where he could talk
[1:33:10] to this young lady and and well then
[1:33:13] brother Brown said I found out as I
[1:33:15] began to talk to her she just kept
[1:33:16] sitting there with her head down and I'd
[1:33:18] ask her a question she just said well
[1:33:19] found out she didn't understand English
[1:33:21] so he said we brought an interpreter up
[1:33:25] and he began or The Interpreter began to
[1:33:28] talk to her you know what brother
[1:33:31] Brandon was saying to her and he said
[1:33:33] all of a sudden I saw a vision
[1:33:36] and he said I began to tell her what I
[1:33:39] was seeing in the vision
[1:33:40] and she's stepped back
[1:33:43] and she's she told The Interpreter said
[1:33:46] I thought he's I thought he couldn't
[1:33:47] speak Spanish
[1:33:50] and and brother in the term interpreter
[1:33:53] asked president did you just speak
[1:33:54] Spanish because I didn't think so so
[1:33:56] they they actually uh later on don't
[1:33:59] hold that tape and and went and listened
[1:34:02] to it it was perfect English he was
[1:34:03] speaking English
[1:34:04] but the girl was hearing her and brother
[1:34:08] Brown said as long as he was to in the
[1:34:10] vision
[1:34:11] and as long as he was shown what the
[1:34:13] vision was he was speaking her in she
[1:34:16] was understanding it without an
[1:34:18] interpreter
[1:34:21] that's tongues
[1:34:23] that that's what the Holy Ghost does
[1:34:26] ain't that right see so he said see then
[1:34:29] the vision started he said you know they
[1:34:31] don't interpret Visions because you're
[1:34:33] speaking constantly never interpret a
[1:34:36] vision until it's over and then they
[1:34:38] tell them what happened he said I saw a
[1:34:40] vision he said I saw that little girl
[1:34:42] about six years old and he begins to
[1:34:44] tell her what happens see and quickly
[1:34:46] before anyone she looked up to that
[1:34:48] interpreter see and and The Interpreter
[1:34:50] asked did you speak in Spanish he said
[1:34:53] no I I spoke English see and so uh uh
[1:34:57] anyway he says as long as that Vision
[1:35:01] was gone and I was talking about that
[1:35:04] Vision in that Vision she heard what I
[1:35:07] was saying see so it was in God the Holy
[1:35:09] Ghost interpreting that ain't that right
[1:35:12] God knows how to get things done
[1:35:15] can I say this sometimes people are so
[1:35:18] scared to talk about the message to
[1:35:20] other people
[1:35:22] because they're afraid they're not going
[1:35:23] to understand
[1:35:25] but I I just got to say this if you're
[1:35:27] under an inspiration
[1:35:30] and if that is a righteous seed
[1:35:33] somehow someway the Holy Ghost is going
[1:35:36] to make sure they understand what is
[1:35:39] being said
[1:35:41] I just believe that I don't think we got
[1:35:44] to take down our pictures for visitors I
[1:35:47] I just don't think we got a quick quote
[1:35:48] in the prophet so we don't scare
[1:35:50] visitors I just believe if you preach
[1:35:52] the prophet and get inspired
[1:35:55] somewhere somehow God will make sure
[1:35:58] they understand can you say Amen isn't
[1:36:01] that not what the Holy Ghost does here
[1:36:03] was 120 and there was 3 000 people that
[1:36:07] need to be saved and birthed into the
[1:36:09] church and God would take that old dumb
[1:36:12] Galilean that he made sure amen that
[1:36:14] they understood every word that Peter
[1:36:16] was saying
[1:36:19] just get under the inspiration
[1:36:22] stay under the fire of God
[1:36:24] can you say Amen
[1:36:26] that's right see now brother Brown says
[1:36:29] now in another place how did they know
[1:36:31] they were galileans if they wasn't
[1:36:32] speaking Galilean see they all dressed
[1:36:35] alike how did they know they were
[1:36:37] galileans are not although these that
[1:36:39] speaking galileans how do we hear every
[1:36:42] man in our own tongue wherein we were
[1:36:44] born then up gets another man a Galilean
[1:36:48] Peter and began to preach to them and
[1:36:50] somehow another in that multitude of
[1:36:52] people three thousand Souls understood
[1:36:54] him and came and was converted and gave
[1:36:57] their lives to Christ ain't that right
[1:37:00] but now notice so so one place brother
[1:37:03] Brown says they were speaking Galilean
[1:37:05] now brother Branham now goes into
[1:37:07] another place and he said they were
[1:37:09] staggering like drunk men like drunk men
[1:37:11] talking not knowing what they were
[1:37:14] saying
[1:37:15] but we're preaching to the congregation
[1:37:17] in languages they didn't know
[1:37:21] but the congregation knew
[1:37:23] can you say man see so if they were
[1:37:26] galileans and they were speaking
[1:37:28] Galilean then they would have known what
[1:37:31] they were saying
[1:37:32] that brother Brown says they didn't know
[1:37:34] what they were saying but the people
[1:37:37] understood what they were saying so
[1:37:39] brother bran gives different accounts
[1:37:41] see speaking in language they didn't
[1:37:43] know see but the congregation knew see
[1:37:47] another place brother Brown said they
[1:37:49] didn't care how much uh well How They
[1:37:51] carried on or how their Church manners
[1:37:53] was screaming and crying and shouting
[1:37:56] and jabbering off languages that seemed
[1:37:58] like they was talking to one another and
[1:38:00] couldn't understand it see then them men
[1:38:04] out there in the audience of other
[1:38:06] nations and other tongues began to hear
[1:38:08] what they were saying they didn't know
[1:38:11] what they were saying they were
[1:38:12] jabbering but other people out there
[1:38:15] understood it
[1:38:16] can you say amen and see so they said
[1:38:19] these persons are certainly drunk so in
[1:38:23] another place brother Brown said they
[1:38:24] couldn't talk in their own language
[1:38:27] they were jabbering off so now they're
[1:38:29] not speaking Galilean
[1:38:32] they couldn't speak in their own
[1:38:33] language they were jabbering off
[1:38:36] something else the Bible says cloven
[1:38:39] tongues clothing is a parted tongue not
[1:38:41] saying nothing just jabbering running
[1:38:44] around like a bunch of drunk people see
[1:38:47] tell you birth is a mess
[1:38:50] foreign
[1:38:53] there in the upper room come out there
[1:38:56] speak in another language
[1:38:58] staggering like drunk people staggering
[1:39:00] and carrying on women see his own mother
[1:39:03] all of them uh uh in the upper room come
[1:39:06] out there jabbering something that
[1:39:08] nobody could understand what they were
[1:39:09] doing at first they had cloven tongue
[1:39:12] set upon them cloven means parted
[1:39:15] divided no one understood what they were
[1:39:17] doing they were just jabbing around and
[1:39:19] acting like they were drunk
[1:39:21] ain't that right so we see that brother
[1:39:24] Branham gives different accounts as to
[1:39:26] what happened in the upper room and what
[1:39:29] language they were speaking see in other
[1:39:32] places brother Branham says they were
[1:39:34] speaking in a Heavenly language
[1:39:37] a Heavenly language not Galilean not an
[1:39:41] Earthly language
[1:39:42] Heavenly language
[1:39:45] they screamed they saw tongues of fire
[1:39:48] separated upon each of them and it so
[1:39:50] quickened their body till they couldn't
[1:39:52] even speak and in an Earthly language
[1:39:55] anymore it quickened their body to a
[1:39:58] Heavenly language the place they're
[1:40:00] going to quickening power of God shook
[1:40:03] their mortal bodies so till their entire
[1:40:06] mortal language was transfigured
[1:40:09] transformed into an immortal language
[1:40:13] can you say Amen see what a quickening
[1:40:16] power what something that belongs if the
[1:40:19] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:40:21] dead dwells in your moral bodies it
[1:40:23] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies we
[1:40:25] are quickened then by the power of the
[1:40:27] Living God tongues quickened to a heaven
[1:40:30] new Heavenly language to speak to them a
[1:40:33] rapturing up raising up into a different
[1:40:36] atmosphere than what they had ever lived
[1:40:38] in with the new quickening life to them
[1:40:41] that come in them it quickened their
[1:40:44] language they spoke in new tongues now
[1:40:48] brother Bram Ties That to Mark 16. ain't
[1:40:51] that right so what they were doing was
[1:40:53] scriptural
[1:40:54] they were speaking in new tongues
[1:40:56] brother Brown says a Heavenly language
[1:40:58] not a mortal language not an Earthly
[1:41:00] language a Heavenly language and you say
[1:41:04] Amen their mortal bodies being quickened
[1:41:06] their language was quickened their
[1:41:08] thoughts were quickened their Spirits
[1:41:10] were quickened their life were quickened
[1:41:12] they were quickened all together they
[1:41:14] tried to talk and couldn't talk in any
[1:41:16] more human languages they were so
[1:41:18] quickened up in the presence of God till
[1:41:21] they spoke a new tongue a Heavenly
[1:41:23] language ain't that right so that's what
[1:41:26] Jesus promised that that it would do
[1:41:28] tongues is what God promised amen that
[1:41:31] the that the church world is telling us
[1:41:33] that's uninspired March 16. but brother
[1:41:36] Brown said it is inspired it's part not
[1:41:39] only of that day but it's part of this
[1:41:40] day it's the last commission not only to
[1:41:43] lay hands not only to cast out Devils
[1:41:46] but to speak with new times
[1:41:51] so we find notice brother Brown says the
[1:41:54] the sick being healed Devil's being cast
[1:41:57] out and speaking with new tongues is the
[1:41:59] word everybody say is the word in action
[1:42:03] here's the word in action the sick being
[1:42:05] healed is the word in action new tongues
[1:42:08] being spoke is new uh the word in action
[1:42:11] Devil's been cast out is the word In
[1:42:14] Action Program said look it quickened
[1:42:17] their bodies until they flew So Close To
[1:42:19] Heaven
[1:42:20] till it quickened their body to speak in
[1:42:23] a language they never heard of before it
[1:42:25] quickened their body they spoke in a new
[1:42:28] Heavenly language they were quickened
[1:42:30] into the presence of God by the baptism
[1:42:32] of the Holy Ghost God's quickening power
[1:42:35] baptized them into that and they were in
[1:42:38] the place of worship then can you say
[1:42:41] Amen now you know you say well you know
[1:42:44] uh so now I'm confused what language do
[1:42:47] they speak do they speak Galilean do
[1:42:49] they speak some other language do they
[1:42:50] speak a Heavenly language you know but
[1:42:52] here's the thing brother Branham was not
[1:42:53] focusing on that
[1:42:55] people do but brother Branham didn't
[1:42:59] but one thing they did do they received
[1:43:01] power from on high
[1:43:03] one thing they did do is they spoke a
[1:43:06] language that the people could
[1:43:07] understand
[1:43:10] and you say Amen so whether it was the
[1:43:13] spirit of God supernaturally working a
[1:43:15] miracle on the one that was speaking and
[1:43:17] the one that was hearing I believe it
[1:43:19] was both I believe that was the miracle
[1:43:22] was that God would take a an old dumb uh
[1:43:25] uh Galilean that didn't know how to
[1:43:27] write to and and read his own name and
[1:43:30] yet move upon him that he could speak a
[1:43:32] language that he had never heard before
[1:43:35] and yet that other uh The Listener amen
[1:43:38] that was unconverted could hear exactly
[1:43:41] what was being said it was God that was
[1:43:43] doing it all
[1:43:45] hey man
[1:43:47] I believe it's the same thing God behind
[1:43:50] the pulpit
[1:43:51] and God in the pew
[1:43:55] you believe that
[1:43:56] I believe that
[1:43:58] so whether they spoke in Galilean
[1:44:01] or were they spoke in a heaven language
[1:44:02] it really doesn't matter to me
[1:44:04] what language they spoke in
[1:44:07] I just believe that brother Branham was
[1:44:08] letting us know that the people
[1:44:10] understood it
[1:44:11] as to what was being said and that it
[1:44:14] wasn't an unknown tongue
[1:44:16] a young man told Brother Branham one
[1:44:18] time he says I received the Holy Ghost
[1:44:20] as they did on Pentecost brother Brown
[1:44:22] said oh did you he said yes sir I did
[1:44:25] he said well how did you receive it he
[1:44:27] said I've spoken unknown tongues
[1:44:29] he said I received it as they did on the
[1:44:31] day of Pentecost
[1:44:32] and brother Brown said he could he knew
[1:44:34] the exact minute the exact hour exactly
[1:44:37] where he received it and so brother
[1:44:39] Brian's like well good you know whatever
[1:44:42] you know but then brother Brown told him
[1:44:44] says you know I I don't doubt that one
[1:44:46] bit that you know he said but it still
[1:44:48] isn't the evidence that that you have
[1:44:50] the Holy Ghost the young man said oh yes
[1:44:51] it is so brother Branham asked him he
[1:44:54] said were people around you when you
[1:44:56] received the Holy Ghost and he said oh
[1:44:58] yes yes everybody he said did they hear
[1:45:00] you speaking in English
[1:45:03] because they were all English-speaking
[1:45:04] people did they hear you speaking in
[1:45:07] English glorifying god of what happened
[1:45:10] oh no no no no no I was speaking in
[1:45:12] unknown tongues he said then you didn't
[1:45:14] get it according to the book of Acts
[1:45:18] can you say amen he said because there
[1:45:20] wasn't one word unknown
[1:45:23] so whether they spoke in a human
[1:45:25] language or a Heavenly language that's
[1:45:27] not the point I would readily say that
[1:45:31] they've done both
[1:45:33] but I'm not here going to debate on that
[1:45:37] but I would rather
[1:45:39] just say they've done both than to
[1:45:41] dispute a prophet
[1:45:44] you understand what I'm saying
[1:45:46] so we we find that even in the Bible
[1:45:49] there were people that received the Holy
[1:45:50] Ghost after the day of Pentecost and
[1:45:52] didn't speak in tongues at all
[1:45:58] ain't that right
[1:45:59] so a person can speak in tongues after
[1:46:02] he receives
[1:46:04] the Holy Ghost now we know that
[1:46:07] ain't that right
[1:46:08] so now now I don't believe that the
[1:46:11] Bible or brother Brandon gets technical
[1:46:13] as to tell how long after you receive it
[1:46:17] you can speak in tongues
[1:46:19] I believe you can speak at the moment
[1:46:21] the moment you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:46:24] it may be a second it may be a minute
[1:46:25] and maybe 10 minutes maybe 100 years or
[1:46:28] you may never do it
[1:46:30] it don't matter
[1:46:32] you understand what I'm saying
[1:46:35] speaking in tongues prophesying dream
[1:46:37] all of them things don't have any
[1:46:39] anything about you having the Holy Ghost
[1:46:42] it has nothing about spirituality as we
[1:46:46] will get later on
[1:46:47] in into it when we get to the
[1:46:49] Pentecostal age
[1:46:52] see so so the point of teaching this
[1:46:55] subject is not to systematically teach
[1:46:57] you
[1:46:59] to where you become so rigid
[1:47:02] in your way of belief
[1:47:05] that God can't do nothing else
[1:47:09] can you say man
[1:47:11] that like that you know to where we
[1:47:14] think that you have to act a certain way
[1:47:16] when you receive it you have to say a
[1:47:18] certain thing when you receive it you
[1:47:20] have to do a certain thing when you
[1:47:22] receive it it's it's God does anything
[1:47:25] he wants to
[1:47:30] but if you go back to the Bible upon
[1:47:32] receiving the Holy Ghost you will
[1:47:34] receive power and you shall be Witnesses
[1:47:37] unto him
[1:47:39] ain't that right
[1:47:40] that's the key
[1:47:42] so we want to leave room for God to move
[1:47:45] ain't that right
[1:47:47] people can receive the Holy Ghost while
[1:47:48] dancing
[1:47:51] we don't put limit on God
[1:47:54] ain't that right
[1:47:56] as I've said before you know now you've
[1:47:58] got your formal uh people in in the
[1:48:01] message and around that that don't
[1:48:03] believe in all that that just think
[1:48:04] that's all too much excitement you're
[1:48:06] putting on a show you're working up
[1:48:08] people you're you're doing all kinds of
[1:48:10] nonsense and as I've told you before
[1:48:12] brother Branham lean more healing more
[1:48:15] to the active side of things
[1:48:18] he says I'd rather have too much
[1:48:20] Wildfire than no fire at all
[1:48:24] he leaned more to inspirational
[1:48:26] preaching than intellectual
[1:48:29] ain't that right
[1:48:30] that's right see because he understood
[1:48:34] the way that the Holy Spirit moved he
[1:48:36] understood the nature
[1:48:38] anything alive is going to kick he says
[1:48:41] ain't that right
[1:48:43] so then if a man's experience doesn't
[1:48:45] match with the Bible
[1:48:48] and the the message of the hour
[1:48:51] which they all dovetailed together but
[1:48:53] if that experience does not match then
[1:48:55] don't receive it
[1:48:57] you don't take it can you say man
[1:49:00] but to say that things have to be done
[1:49:02] in certain in order would be a false
[1:49:03] statement
[1:49:05] for again in the Bible people received
[1:49:08] the Holy Ghost by hands being laid upon
[1:49:10] them others by preaching the gospel see
[1:49:13] others by whatever see some spoken new
[1:49:16] tongues after receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:49:17] others didn't ain't that right
[1:49:20] now as I get ready to close
[1:49:25] brother Branham said the principle to
[1:49:27] Revival is being flexible
[1:49:31] everybody say flexible
[1:49:34] flexible the key to Revival is flexible
[1:49:39] being flexible he said that is the
[1:49:41] principle of a Revival a people who are
[1:49:46] flexible
[1:49:47] not gullible
[1:49:49] but flexible
[1:49:52] right
[1:49:53] not ones that accepts anything
[1:49:56] but ones that can look sincerely in the
[1:49:59] word and if it's there we believe it
[1:50:02] there you go ain't that right
[1:50:04] yes sir so he says that's the principle
[1:50:07] of Revival a people who are flexible not
[1:50:10] to an intellectual talk
[1:50:13] but to the coming of the holy spirit in
[1:50:15] the form of the baptism so don't be
[1:50:18] flexible to an intellectual talk he's
[1:50:20] saying
[1:50:21] be flexible to the coming of the holy
[1:50:23] spirit in the form of a baptism that
[1:50:26] gives way to the word of God and
[1:50:30] rejoicing and is flexible in the
[1:50:33] anointing of the spirit
[1:50:36] ain't that right
[1:50:39] brother Brown tells her the time that he
[1:50:41] was
[1:50:42] out in the woods I think in Canada and
[1:50:45] and it was I think it got dark on him
[1:50:48] and so that he was uh he had entered
[1:50:51] into a place of woods that had been
[1:50:53] burned years ago
[1:50:56] and and as he's there
[1:50:58] a wind blew through Wind come I don't
[1:51:02] think that was accidental but the wind
[1:51:04] come through
[1:51:06] and he said you heard the office noise
[1:51:11] you know
[1:51:14] and he said it was the awfullest eeriest
[1:51:16] sound
[1:51:18] that it was given
[1:51:20] and so he he said they he said now them
[1:51:24] old trees were groaning making the Sound
[1:51:27] by that wind under that wind the wind
[1:51:29] blew
[1:51:30] [Music]
[1:51:33] and he said the reason why is because
[1:51:36] they were dead stiff and starchy
[1:51:40] dead Stefan starchy so that when
[1:51:45] so brother Brown tells him you know he
[1:51:47] kind of gives the illustration of what
[1:51:49] they were saying oh dear Miracles have
[1:51:52] passed oh can't have that in our church
[1:51:55] no no no no
[1:51:58] win coming down
[1:52:01] gonna blow
[1:52:04] oh holy ghost no no no don't speak oh no
[1:52:07] no no no don't dance oh no no shouting
[1:52:11] all that crying though you working up
[1:52:14] something oh
[1:52:17] this dog dead and formal
[1:52:19] stiff
[1:52:20] is that right
[1:52:22] he said the wind blowing there made them
[1:52:24] moan and groan he said they had no life
[1:52:27] to bend with the Wind
[1:52:30] right
[1:52:32] he said they had no bark to make them
[1:52:34] flexible
[1:52:35] and the sound was really spooky he says
[1:52:38] just like the organizations of today
[1:52:40] they can't bend to the spirit
[1:52:42] because they're so organized it would
[1:52:45] break up their organization
[1:52:47] they make spooky sounds
[1:52:51] they get behind the pool but make spooky
[1:52:53] sounds
[1:52:56] they're coming to church sitting in a
[1:52:57] Pew and they make spooky sounds
[1:53:00] ain't that right
[1:53:02] all right I remember where was it we we
[1:53:05] went to uh
[1:53:06] it was uh
[1:53:09] we we had met some uh ex-amish
[1:53:13] and I don't know how how new they were
[1:53:16] out out of the Amish but
[1:53:18] uh Seth had met him in at college so
[1:53:21] they invited him to come to church
[1:53:24] to their meeting and so
[1:53:26] I said yeah we'll go you know so the
[1:53:28] whole family went
[1:53:30] so we sit in the back you know and
[1:53:33] so the minister he was he was preaching
[1:53:35] and and you know it was dead quiet dead
[1:53:38] quiet
[1:53:40] and but he he talking about something
[1:53:43] that I agreed on so I said amen
[1:53:47] it was the funniest thing
[1:53:50] everybody turned around
[1:53:52] and I I could just picture this one
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:53:57] and all of all of them turned around to
[1:53:59] look at me to say who who did that
[1:54:06] so that reminded me of that today
[1:54:08] I'm not not making fun of it it's just
[1:54:10] I'd never been in the place like that
[1:54:12] before but they did they cranked their
[1:54:14] necks
[1:54:15] so they say you know
[1:54:17] Divine Healing wasn't in the atonement
[1:54:19] and all that their nonsense of shouting
[1:54:22] going on just what Joel said brother
[1:54:25] Brown said you're taking the Joy from
[1:54:26] the sons of God
[1:54:28] amen restored that Joy
[1:54:32] God said he would do it
[1:54:34] another place he said the fires of
[1:54:36] persecution have burned them and the
[1:54:39] members has come in got
[1:54:42] ritualistic form and ungodliness and
[1:54:45] burnt the bark off of them and they're
[1:54:47] nothing but a bed dead bunch of
[1:54:49] Representatives only to groan and moan
[1:54:52] and make a lot of fussing about
[1:54:53] something God's doing
[1:54:55] he says another place I thought Lord
[1:54:57] what do you send the wind for if they're
[1:55:00] going to moan in hell and go on like
[1:55:03] that he's out there and hearing all that
[1:55:05] bunch of moaning why why are you sitting
[1:55:07] in the wind for for these for these
[1:55:09] trees for them people
[1:55:12] if you send an old-fashioned Pentecostal
[1:55:15] wind that like that fell on the day of
[1:55:17] Pentecost what in the world you doing
[1:55:18] that gonna send that forth they're just
[1:55:20] going to moan and refuse it and reject
[1:55:22] it
[1:55:23] he says then I noticed I noticed well
[1:55:27] all that moaning and groaning what's
[1:55:29] going on
[1:55:30] is I happen to look and there was
[1:55:32] undergrowth undergrowth little little
[1:55:35] saplings growing and they were just
[1:55:37] frolicking in the land just to blow it
[1:55:40] with the Wind
[1:55:43] and he says he I noticed he said they
[1:55:45] had life in them
[1:55:47] and then when that wind began to hit
[1:55:49] them they was twisting and ringing and
[1:55:51] shouting and having a glorious time
[1:55:55] so one is mono oh don't do that
[1:55:59] don't do that
[1:56:04] not Young Generation it's an undergrowth
[1:56:07] that's just having a ball
[1:56:10] they're enjoying everything that God has
[1:56:13] for them
[1:56:14] can you say Amen that's right see so
[1:56:18] here brother Brown said when that wind
[1:56:19] hit them they wasn't moaning and
[1:56:21] groaning they was just flexible and
[1:56:24] jumping and rejoicing and shouting and
[1:56:27] having a holy ghost meeting
[1:56:29] he said why they were flexible they had
[1:56:32] life they was moving with the wind just
[1:56:34] rejoicing they wasn't moaning about it
[1:56:36] they were rejoicing frolicking jumping
[1:56:39] having an old-time Revival
[1:56:43] brother Brown says another place let me
[1:56:45] tell you brother God's going to raise up
[1:56:46] a generation of people out of all this
[1:56:48] dead stuff that's going to restore saith
[1:56:50] the Lord God's going to raise up people
[1:56:52] who believes in signs and wonders going
[1:56:55] to raise up people who's got joy
[1:56:56] unspeakable and full of glory and when
[1:56:58] the rushing wind comes it gives right
[1:57:01] into it and frolics and dances and
[1:57:03] glorifies God hallelujah green leaves
[1:57:06] are clapping their hands and having a
[1:57:08] wonderful time well what a Frolic that
[1:57:10] little ungrowth was having but that big
[1:57:13] old tree's standing there just a moaning
[1:57:15] and growing and it was the same wind the
[1:57:17] same wind that was causing one to
[1:57:19] moaning wrong was calling to the other
[1:57:21] one to have an old-fashioned Holy Ghost
[1:57:22] Revival and they were frolicking
[1:57:25] shouting glorifying God they were
[1:57:27] bending them you just come in surprise
[1:57:30] so it was mainly just the locals that
[1:57:32] were there and he says a lot of times he
[1:57:35] said brother Brown was a totally
[1:57:36] different man than he was with all the
[1:57:38] people there he said man he'd get out
[1:57:40] there and dance and shout and just have
[1:57:42] a ball he said you know he says just
[1:57:45] because he was at home with with the
[1:57:47] home folk you understand what I'm saying
[1:57:48] so he says see so brother Brown said I
[1:57:51] became a Holy Roller Hallelujah that
[1:57:54] when the wind goes to blowing I can give
[1:57:57] in to it and say Yes Lord I believe
[1:57:59] you're the same yesterday or saying
[1:58:02] Jesus Christ that rose from the dead you
[1:58:03] live yet today and the spirit of God
[1:58:06] just sweeps it from one side to the
[1:58:08] other you think we're crazy but we're
[1:58:10] not we just got life and we're flexible
[1:58:15] that's the difference see there's a
[1:58:17] people that's got life and got
[1:58:19] flexibility
[1:58:21] ain't that right
[1:58:22] sure we know that there's all kinds of
[1:58:24] impersonators and all that but if you're
[1:58:25] going to dwell on that you're gonna get
[1:58:26] yeah you ain't gonna see the real
[1:58:29] you ain't gonna see the genuine that's
[1:58:31] there I'd rather see the genuine I'd
[1:58:34] rather look for something that's real if
[1:58:36] there's a thousand impersonators there's
[1:58:38] got to at least be one that's real
[1:58:41] I'd rather look for that one
[1:58:44] ain't that right
[1:58:45] so he says go ahead and mourn if you
[1:58:47] want to but God's moving his that
[1:58:50] undergrowth coming right on up and she's
[1:58:52] going right on in the seed can you say
[1:58:54] amen he said another place I'm glad uh
[1:58:58] he said I'm glad I'm that backwashed
[1:59:00] they call that hallelujah oh my soul can
[1:59:03] stay clear with God when the Holy Ghost
[1:59:05] comes down I won't moan and groan and
[1:59:07] take sides against it I'll agree with it
[1:59:10] and frolick with it and live with it and
[1:59:12] speak with it and sing with it and Shout
[1:59:14] with it and die with it Hallelujah
[1:59:17] Mighty rushing wind come from heaven
[1:59:19] like a wind see filled all the house
[1:59:22] where they were setting all the
[1:59:24] fundamentals began to groan but he had
[1:59:26] something coming up I will restore saith
[1:59:28] the Lord see here comes some more pine
[1:59:31] trees coming up they was ready to catch
[1:59:33] right into the wind and just frolicking
[1:59:35] having a good time I said if that Don't
[1:59:37] Put Me In Mind of a good old-fashioned
[1:59:40] Holy Ghost meeting my goodness I think
[1:59:43] it's interesting how he describes a good
[1:59:45] old fashion Holy Ghost meeting you never
[1:59:48] find him describing a formal Church
[1:59:51] where people just sitting there like a
[1:59:53] nylon log and him calling out a good
[1:59:56] old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting but you
[1:59:58] do find it when he talks about Miriam
[2:00:00] beating the tambourine and they're
[2:00:01] dancing and Moses is singing in the
[2:00:03] spirit he said now that's Pentecostal
[2:00:06] right there that's a good old-fashioned
[2:00:08] Holy Ghost meeting ain't that right and
[2:00:11] when he he didn't call them trees
[2:00:12] moaning and groaning under the wind a
[2:00:14] whole old-fashioned Holy Ghost meme it
[2:00:16] was them little ones that was having a
[2:00:18] good old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting
[2:00:20] when they were just frolicking in the
[2:00:22] wind dancing giving way to it can you
[2:00:25] say amen and I don't know about you but
[2:00:27] we are that generation that he was
[2:00:29] talking about we are that undergrow amen
[2:00:31] they can despise it they can reject it
[2:00:34] they can do whatever they want to they
[2:00:36] can call us all kinds of names that let
[2:00:38] us Frolic in the Wind of the spirit when
[2:00:41] the spirit God comes down it may be in a
[2:00:44] PR with us just as one or a group of us
[2:00:47] or in a meeting it don't matter when he
[2:00:50] comes I want to frolic with it I want to
[2:00:52] enjoy it I want to move with the speak
[2:00:55] with it live with it die with it can you
[2:00:58] say Amen oh yes we are that undergrowth
[2:01:02] if the musicians will come
[2:01:05] brother Andrew Cena the following quote
[2:01:07] yesterday on a Minister's chat and I
[2:01:10] thought it went long
[2:01:12] he said there is brother Brown said
[2:01:14] there is some kind of emotion within a
[2:01:16] born-again Christian
[2:01:18] when it pulsates
[2:01:20] there's something has to happen
[2:01:22] that's all there is to it can you say
[2:01:25] Amen
[2:01:26] you see
[2:01:27] things blow up when people get too rigid
[2:01:32] and we miss the things of God
[2:01:34] can you say Amen
[2:01:37] amen
[2:01:39] but if it's in the word I'll take it
[2:01:42] if it's there it's there
[2:01:45] ain't that right
[2:01:47] and we know that that first church had
[2:01:49] unknown tongues
[2:01:51] sure did
[2:01:53] and we have unknown tongues or I believe
[2:01:55] in them anyways
[2:01:59] but Paul would put the order into it
[2:02:01] as brother Branham put order to it
[2:02:06] and if we follow that order to it then
[2:02:07] we know it's of God
[2:02:10] can you say man
[2:02:12] you love him
[2:02:15] I love him I love him let's just sing
[2:02:17] that song I love him
[2:02:20] oh
[2:02:23] I love him
[2:02:27] [Music]
[2:02:30] I love you
[2:02:33] because
[2:02:35] [Music]
[2:02:37] he first loved me
[2:02:45] and prayers
[2:02:47] purchase my
[2:02:51] salvation

[2:13:41] move
[2:13:44] church just to encourage you just to

[2:13:59] just been asking the Lord for me just
[2:14:02] Lord help me to lay aside every way
[2:14:06] whether it's materialistic whether it's
[2:14:08] just in my heart
[2:14:10] things I'm holding on to
[2:14:13] I need to let go whatever it would be I
[2:14:16] just ask the Lord to show me and give me
[2:14:18] the grace too
[2:14:20] Let It Go
[2:14:22] and I tell you what there's nothing
[2:14:26] nothing worth holding on to
[2:14:29] in this world
[2:14:31] we can't take it with this church
[2:14:34] the one thing about it
[2:14:36] it'll all be over when we hear him say
[2:14:39] Well done thou good and faithful servant
