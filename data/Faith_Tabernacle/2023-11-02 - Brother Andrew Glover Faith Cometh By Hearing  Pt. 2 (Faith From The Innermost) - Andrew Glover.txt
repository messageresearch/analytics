visitors uh Sister Mariah and brother Andrew and uh uh and uh you know uh uh you know that's the Lord's just uh has blessed them and uh he's on demand you know uh traveling all around and and uh so I know it's got to be tiring for them and a lot of uh young preachers thinks that's it's a lucrative thing to be able to travel but uh it's not uh when you're evangelizing and you're out uh church service after church service and preaching and you know you're packing and unpacking packing and unpacking and just uh there's a lot to it but we certainly appreciate uh uh brother Andrew for giv uh his uh life to the gospel been willing to travel and uh uh to preach uh to the bride of Christ and uh we're we're glad that uh they didn't get lost they knew where home was praise the Lord and uh so

faith in God Amen I am thankful for the faith of God that's been revealed in this hour in our heart that amen he's not in a tomb in Jerusalem neither is any a grave in Jeffersonville but he's right here tonight in the power of his resurrection amen and something in our heart is bearing witness that he's up from the grave and everything that he said he would do he's doing amen amen that'll be all for the music tonight we want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and sure is a little cold on the outside but it's warm on the inside tonight and amen just the warm feeling in the presence of the Holy Spirit you know I was telling someone the other day I was preaching somewhere and I come across a quote brother B said he said uh it's okay to feel free you know and I thought a lot of people say we don't go by feelings and brother brm told us that but it just struck me there will come a time that you won't feel free so you might as well enjoy feeling free while you feel it amen I believe tonight that we can say the presence of the Lord is in the building and we sent him here tonight and we want to say God bless you all and if you have your Bibles tonight we want to go straight to the word we want to turn to the Book of Romans the 10th chapter The Book of Romans the 10th chapter and then we're going to go to the Book of Mark the 11th chapter and uh we just want to thank you all for all your prayers and support and we uh sure sure enjoy getting to be here when we are here and looking forward to the fellowship this weekend and amen just trus in the Lord for a good time amen and we sure sure appreciate our pastor appreciate our church and the stand for this end time word amen it's getting almost anymore where people are just walking away it seem like every day but I'm thankful for a group of people that stands and a pastor that preaches this message amen we sure love and appreciate brother Sean and the family tonight and amen let's just bow our hearts together for a word of prayer just before we look into his word tonight how many just say Lord come by and minister to my heart amen I believe he sees your hand Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Wednesday afternoon father when it's cold on the outside Lord the weather is changing seasons are changing but Lord there is a faith a fire in the inside of our souls dear God that Lord no matter how cold the world may get the condition of the world may get L Lord father there's something on the inside of us that troubles cannot put out situations cannot put out Lord father and that's the Holy Ghost in Fire and Lord as we come tonight on this Wednesday evening Lord I know how Lord important these services are father your children here facing situations facing circumstances Lord things happening throughout the week and Lord you would allow father us to have a place to run into on a Wednesday evening Lord as we look into your word tonight T father I pray this service would be just a shot the arm to every believer here Lord May the faith of God arise in their heart and their enemies be scattered Lord May sicknesses Among Us be healed father May discouragement turn into encouragement Lord father May situations that seem helpless and hopeless oh god father may they come underneath the presence of your word and may those situations change and Lord when we leave this place tonight may we be able to say did that our hearts burn within us Lord not as brother Andrew talked to us so long the way but as you came Lord and helped me to get myself out of the way and you spoke to your children and broke the bread of life and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen The Book of Romans the 10th chapter and then the 11th verse Paul here writing says for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed named for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him and whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach preach the gospel of peace bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel now watch here for Isaiah sayth Lord who hath believed I report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God now I love how brother Bram interprets that he says hearing by the word of God made manifest so we're not just hearing about the word but we're actually hearing about that word being made manifest now in The Book of Mark the 11th chapter I know you all uh know these verses by heart in Mark 11 and verse 22 I actually today had something toally different uh on my heart and a direction to go and this afternoon about 4:00 the Lord just stopped by my little study there and changed it so we just follow him tonight in Mark 11 and verse 22 Jesus here speaking he says have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea now watch this and shall not doubt in his heart notice not shall not doubt in his head but shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith now therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them can we say that last line together and ye shall have them we ask Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord maybe just to continue uh with you on the thought that we were speaking on last time we spoke to you on faith cometh by hearing but I want to take a little something out of that tonight and maybe a subtitle of Faith from the innermost Faith from the innermost brother Bram says here in 1957 he says until something comes down on the inside of you to just say it so he said that's all there is to it he said then there's not enough demons out of Torment that could ever shake you from it it's something on the inside called the heart he said that's where real Faith Finds Its resting place amen so the faith of God has got to dwell in the heart of a Believer and another place in have faith in God 58 he said if you got real faith in your heart he said that God's going to keep his word all the hurts and aches and pains and shadows will not amount to anything amen if you believe it in your heart it's yours and there's nothing somebody say nothing amen there's nothing can take it away from you it's yours it's a gift that God has given you he said it's the Blessed assurance that what you ask for he is able to perform it because he promised it that's real Faith now amen as Believers tonight we're not just Desiring intellectual Faith or emotional Faith amen but there's something in the heart of a son and daughter of God Amen that is Desiring real Faith now the last time we were speaking to you on this we were looking very heavily in the Book of Luke the 8th chapter where the Bible tells the parable of the swer amen who went forth sewing his seed and the Bible says there amen that that seed is the word of God and we found that that seed actually falls into four different types of ground and when Jesus himself begin to interpret that Parable he will actually show us that those four types of ground were actually hears now if you all remember there was the indifferent here there was the emotional here there was the worldly hair amen but then amen there was the receptive here which was a type of the good ground amen which an honest heart has heard and receives the word of faith amen and when that word falls into good ground amen that word is going to produce the promise of the word that it's fallen into amen if it's an apple tree it's going to bring forth apples if it's an orange tree it's going to bring forth oranges then if it's a promise for salvation it's going to bring forth salvation if it's a promise for healing it's going to bring forth healing amen and we left off looking at how amen that those receptive hearers actually have amen a teachable spirit on the inside of them now in the book of Hebrews 11th chapter and the first verse I know you know this scripture by heart amen but Paul here says now that Faith amen is the substance of things hoped for amen it's the evidence of Things Not Seen he said for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen amen were not made of things which do appear brother B preaches a message 1955 and he calls it the power of God and he asks this question he says what is Faith amen what is Faith he said is God by the spirit amen revealing to you something that he's going to do or that he's promised so Faith amen is not just a feeling it's not just a sensation amen but faith is a revelation from almighty God Amen that is revealed to you of something he's going to do amen or something that he has promised now amen if you only hear he said Faith cometh by hearing amen but hearing is not Faith Now Catch This amen Faith cometh by hearing amen but hearing is not Faith he said a loaf of bread amen is the purchase just for 25 cents amen but the 25 cents is not the loaf of bread see amen hearing only brings the word that produces the faith amen so hearing brings the word into your heart amen that produces the faith to bring the promise of the word to pass amen faith is the substance of things hoped for amen it's the evidence of Things Not Seen he said then you see you hear the word amen then God reveals it to you that it is the truth amen and by the spirit revealed truth confirms your faith to God that's a mouthful Church you see amen you hear the word god reveals it to you then it is the truth and by the spirit revealed truth he confirms your faith to God he said that's the church that God built upon the rock amen that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it amen then that tells me that Faith amen has got a power behind it and the prophet said Faith's power is to to bring to pass amen God's revealed Revelation that's why the devil does not want F Amen to move Beyond intellectual Faith he does not want this to move amen Beyond head knowledge because when it becomes Revelation you will move from being able to be defeated into being an invincible Army listen with just intellectualism the devil will defeat us with just head knowledge amen the devil will defeat us but let me put my voice with Jesus who said on this rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against it I tell you tonight I believe we're a part of that church amen that has been founded upon a rock of Revelation amen we can testify tonight that storms have come but we're still standing amen amen situations have come but we're still here amen because something has dropped in our hearts which is Faith now in Romans the 10th chapter Paul there is speaking to the Romans which they had been heathens which were Idol amen and they had just come over into Christianity Amen brother said watch and Faith cometh by hearing he said Paul sending this letter to the Romans amen getting the church in order amen he's speaking to them about faith in the fourth chapter of Romans he speaks of Abraham amen being justified by faith in in ninth chapter of Romans he speaks on the election of God how that God called Jacob and ordained them and he said by election he chose by his own choosing amen chose Jacob instead of Esau amen though Esau being rightly to the birthrights he chose Jacob instead of Esau amen so here we find amen that Abraham was justified by faith here we find that election is done by faith when Paul comes to the 10th chapter here re said now we find him dividing what faith is amen so the fourth chapter Abraham justified by faith ninth chapter Jacob chosen over Esau by faith election faith amen the 10th chapter he's going to divide what faith is now do you all know amen that we're living in a generation of a Joshua Ministry amen where Moses brought him out of Egypt amen but Joshua took him into the land and sister Jane Joshua positionally plac them amen in their inheritance of what belonged to them and here is a Joshua Ministry amen that's not just bringing the church out of confusion but he's bringing them into a position of Faith amen by the the word of God he said now Faith is Burly he said my how I like to think of Faith amen hope faith and charity those three things amen hope what a beautiful thing hope is he said little timid hope lovely sweet as she is amen yet she's the greatest enemy that faith has amen the greatest enemy faith is got is Hope because a person becomes so hopeful amen till they leave away from Faith he said now watch hope will agree with the Bible amen hope will say it's true hope hope will say I believe every bit of it I believe that it's the word of God I believe that God will keep his promised amen hope believes all that amen but then hope says now I believe God will heal amen but look at my condition amen so in other words hope believes it as long as its way out there amen but when it comes to you personally then hope becomes timid and backs up and says but your conditions this and your diagnosis is this and your problem is this amen but the prophet said faith is not t amen faith is Burly he said as I once said faith has hair on the chest and when it stands up it pulls its big muscles out and everything else vanishes away amen When Faith really takes a hold nothing else stands now I love the way the prophet breaks this down he said if you just rely on Hope amen then You Hinder faith if you just rely on Hope amen then You Hinder Faith amen because hope looks for something way off amen but Faith claims it right now how many how many say on this Wednesday night I just need a faith claiming service amen it's not out in the future it's not coming it's not going to be amen but there's something in the innermost part of my soul amen that declares it's not in the future and it's not in the past amen but I'm going to call Healing right now I'm going to call Deliverance right now I'm going to call for a Revival and a refreshing from the presence of God right now amen it's not tomorrow it's not next meeting it's not next convention it's right now see amen that settles it I don't care if I'm still crippled if I'm still blind if I'm still sick that don't have nothing to do with it amen it's mine right now and as long as Satan can put you off to another day that's as good as he wants amen but Faith acts now well somebody say Amen Faith acts now and faith is positive there's nothing negative in faith faith is positive he said oh my When Faith speaks everybody else keeps still amen that's right so we find then amen that Faith cometh by hearing amen and hearing of the word of God now there is a connection amen between Bible teaching and Bible Faith the prophet of God said in adoption part one he said Bible teaching is usually a little treacherous amen it's kind of like walking on thin I amen but we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what I think to a complete understanding amen positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes preaching is wonderful amen teaching goes beyond that especially to the church he said preaching catches The Sinner and brings him under condemnation by the word amen but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are amen then this message is not just a message Amen to set us up on the Mountaintop and keep us up on the mountain amen the fruit of freeze upon on the mountain amen but this message has the power Amen to take us from the mountain to the valley and we'll still believe God in the valley amen the same way we would on the Mountaintop this message has the ability to teach us how to be Christians in our trials and how to be Christians in our victories it teaches us how to be Christians in sickness and to be Christians in health I'm not preaching some little Baptist idea I'm preaching the faith of God that has been sent into this age by the voice of Malachi 4 to bring a church to a position of authority over every devil every spirit and you know who you are I tell you that's a powerful Revelation Church amen that you don't just know who you are when things are going good and you don't just know who you are when things are happy but you know who you are when the wind is blowing and the rain is falling and the devil is howling and Spirits are all around you there is something in the innermost part of a Christian that can say though he slays me yet I will trust him amen if God give you the gift of the Holy Ghost well the word of God is a conductor to use that power with he said whatever the Holy Ghost promised you that's what you can do see whatever the Holy Ghost promised you that's what you can do then the Bible teaching was coming not from just a prophet it was coming from the spirit he said that's the thing that delivers the word amen is the word goes right out and the Holy Spirit follows the word you see your pastor preaching and the first thing you know it but makes a blowing sound he said across the building goes the Holy Ghost that's right amen it's the conductor of the word then listen church when you feel the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's not just a cold chill coming through the room that's not just a preacher trying to work you up amen but it is a wind of the holy spirit that is following the words you're being taught and that spirit is bringing the word to you position it in your heart now the prophet said the word is the conductor right of the spirit he said because where the word is preached amen the spirit follows it wherever it goes why the spirit follows the word I like that I like sound Bible teaching and the Bible Holy Ghost coming back amen confirming Bible teaching let me say this Bible teaching is not Church teaching Bible teaching is not denominational teaching he said you know I believe if he would come tonight it would be all together different than what we've got figured out he will come he always seems to do it but yet it's straight with the scripture amen see they was expecting him coming in his second coming his great power amen which then he come for them and for us but we know in his first coming amen he was to come lowly riding on the mule amen coming in the city how that even his disciples amen didn't understand it now listen to the prophet and how it is tonight that sometimes amen things happen and if it doesn't equal up to what our church teaches then we want to throw it out and say there's nothing to it I'm just going to take the Liberty to preach here amen cuz we've come to an age where things are being taught amen that don't equal up with a message amen but people still feel a pressure to follow it amen because of the person who's teaching it amen I don't care what the man's name is I don't care what church is representing amen if you hear anything contrary to what the seventh angel has t you throw it out the window and you stay with the message of the hour it's the only thing that'll bring you to a stability it's the only thing that'll bring you across the mountain and through the valley is the message of the hour and that message is not something to water down and dilute and put intellectualism with it amen if it's not in the message For Heaven's Sake four an alpha window and somebody say what a prophet said and Ne oh my here I am and neither am I going to get bogged down and dissecting this message on what should be said how it should be said when it should be said who should say Amen either we believe this message or let's close the doors and go be a Baptist somewhere amen I say if a prophet stood with it we ought to stand with it and contrary to what some people believe a prophet stood with this picture he stood in a pull pit with this picture behind him and he testified it was a scientific proof of a supernatural visitation listen if a prophet wasn't ashamed of it you better believe I'm not ashamed to stand with a Joshua Ministry that is coming to this age to positionally place me in the faith of Jesus Christ we will not back up we will not lay down we have been called to the faith of God and it's positioned Us in the word of God anything contrary to what the word teaches thr it out throw it out get rid of it and stand with a prophet you know the thing we ought to do sensibly is to look at it in the light of the scripture now I believe that every Bible teaching or every church every Revelation must be built on this word and if anybody teaches anything contrary to the word I wouldn't believe it how much more pler could it be said if anybody teaches anything contrary to the word am I wouldn't believe it see this Bible is God's foundation and there's no other Foundation can be laid but that which is already laid in Christ Jesus I love another place if whole Bible teaching and preaching don't make you sick then it don't do you no good see it's got to stir up your spiritual gastronomics another place there's many people who get prayed for and they'll go through a prayer line with a crippled hand and a crippled foot and a sick stomach and the next morning and get up and say I'm just as sick as I was he said what you need is some good Bible teaching then do you see that's what was separating William Brandon from AA Allen and Oral Roberts and Jack Cole amen as they was all hollering healing amen but a prophet was standing there and he was laboring in the word to establish a foundation for healing to come upon that's why they could go through all Robert's prayer line and come back the next night and say nothing has changed but they could go through William brandom's prayer line and he could say you're healed of that Gorder you're healed of that stomach trouble and go home in the same condition that they went through the prayer line in but two weeks later the Gorder disappear and the stomach trouble resolved amen because a prophet was not building him up on the mountain without giving him a sure place to stand when the devil come against him I know it's Wednesday night but I got to preach I say thank God for this message that has give us a rock to stand on when the Devil Comes against us on Monday and comes against us on Tuesday we can stand on the rock of Revelation and say you're too late devil it's already dropped in the innermost part of my soul I'm Healed I'm saved I'm Justified I'm forgiven I'm redeemed I'm Rapture Ready I'm glorified I'm perfected listen a prophet give you somewhere to stand by teaching you the word of God Amen what you need is some good Bible teaching you don't look at the symptom you look at the word it's never watch this if you look at that you'll never get well now I know people say well teaching well the Bible tells us that in the beginning was the word right and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh who was the first person let me say it like this who was John 1:14 he was none other than the Lord Jesus Christ then the Bible said that Jesus himself being the word took time to teach and preach in St Matthew 4:2 3 the Bible says that Jesus went about all Galilee amen teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people now don't tell me that I cannot identify that prophet in that scripture because that Prophet under that Pillar of Fire came with that continuation of ministry which was none other than the ministry of Jesus Christ and you got thousands of tapes and every one of them brother random teaches and he testifies and he preaches and then he says let's call the prayer line you know why because he was giv you a sure place to stand when the devil come against the word that you had heard to bring faith in your heart now I love what the Bible says the Bible says that Jesus amen taught in the temple in Luke the 5th chapter the first verse it came to pass amen that the people pressed upon Him Amen to hear the word of God brother Sean they literally pressed upon Him Amen to hear the word and he stood by the lake of Janar and believest thou this the prophet said the church today ought to be pressing everywhere Amen to hear the word of God now watch what he says staying with the word the church ought to be pressing everywhere to hear the word but not just hear it but stay with it I'm just going to preach I'm home amen just hear it but stay with it listen friends you can hear it but you got to stay with it the battle's not just hear it amen the battle is stained with it are you hearing me amen the battle is stained with the word when every other sense of your body is giving you reason to rebuke the word or to doubt the word amen but there's something on the inside of the inside oh my then there's something that will make you stay with the word when people walk away there's something will cause you to stand with this word amen when your friends deny this word amen what is it it's faith in the innermost now the Bible says in Amos 11 Spirit of Prophecy spoke and said there would be a famine right amen it would not be for bread or water but of hearing the word of the Lord re said there will come a famine in the land he said for the hearing of the word of God Amen the true word of God Amen I want you to catch something brother amamos it's not a famine for the word amen it's a famine for the hearing of the word listen Church there's plenty of word the seals have been tore off the Mysteries have been revealed the Revelation is in the church there's plenty of word amen but the famine has come amen for the hearing of what has been reveal I might as well go ahead and say it he said if that don't fit this nation at this time I don't know where it does fit he said see we got plenty of clothes nice homes everything but there's a famine of the hearing of the word of God he said a man won't know what to believe you're all confused one says this and one says that and one says this and one says something else amen but base your thoughts on thus saith the Lord and God will confirm it here is the secret the bride has the mind of Christ she has thus sayth the Lord or she will keep still now can I ask you something where do you keep secrets at amen if they're real Secrets brother Tim you keep them in the innermost part amen of your heart amen then this message did not come brother Bob to deal with our head it come to take the off of her heart and put the secrets of God in there can I read you this quote I pray you be merciful tonight he said May there not be a blind man here a blind woman but may there be some that's he said May there be some that's blind to your presence of you being here their souls are packed away with some sort of man-made theology in this great day you permitted it to be you said Lord they'll come a time when there won't be a famine for bread and water but of hearing the word of God and men would run to and fro seeking it now listen to the prophet and we've lived to see that day brother Terry I can read Amos 81 and say this day is this scripture fulfilled we've lived to see that day when one says this way and one says that way now are you hearing me we're we've come back to it I hate to say it but we've come back to it where one preacher says this way and another preacher says that way and a teacher says this way and a pastor says this way amen but could we just come back to what the prophet said he said but we're thankful Lord that you said I am the way amen then we're not looking for a preacher to point us this way brother junior or a teacher to point us that way amen we're listening to the sound of the word of the Lord Jesus when he said I am the way and if you are the way then your present tense here now to prove you are the way in other words this message is the way to Rapture this message is the way to body change this message is is the way to the Future home it's the way to the New Jerusalem it's the way to the resurrection amen and if a man says go that way you'll miss it and if a man says go this way you'll miss it but if you'll stay with a message which is Christ amen it'll bring you to a place to stand oh God I say God bring our young people Amen to a rock of Revelation when the world says go this way and preacher says go that way now come on church and man I'm just going to say it if we quit promoting personalities and start promoting the message we'd have a lot less distrust in the pews that's right free of charge preach the message it's the way he's the truth he's the life now the prophet of God said not any church doctrine any theology or any denomination but you are the way now you say preacher how do you say that because Daniel 9 says I Daniel understood by books we today understand by books right in the last days there come a famine he said understand that he'll send Elijah before that day comes at the end time and he'll have a message that'll turn the hearts so the message of Malachi 4 is a message that's going to turn the hearts of the children amen back to the fathers to the original amen go back again to the end and start brother M go back to the end again and start he said I understand that'll take place amen just before the spirit leaves the Gentile Church church amen to return to the Jews then listen friends amen I know it's not popular amen but time is running out we are living in the Fulfillment of the forthcoming of Elijah and Revelation 11 will be fulfilled so why there's time to take a pull pit while there's time to have a meeting while there's Grace to preach this message why don't we just get back to humbl ourselves and say I'm wrong you're wrong and the prophet is right and just say what he said now I'm I'm pushing against Spirit I'm going to push it right out of here amen we just need to get back to being able to read a quote and keep on preaching whatever happened to just being able to stand behind the pull pit and say what a prophet said and keep on preaching it's got to where now if you read a quote you got to stop and spend 30 minutes explaining why you said it and what direction you're going to say it amen but I will not lay down and waste time Amen to pet that devil around I'm not going to read a quote and spend all night explaining I'm going to say what a prophet said and let the presence of the way the truth and the life come in the church and put Faith in the hearts of the Believers Elijah's message will be a heart message it will be a washing of the heart that he would sanctify the church and he would cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word now brother Bram says it very beautiful he says the Waters of separation is the word the word of God the Waters of Separation through the washing of the water Water by the word he said you come and you hear the word and the first thing it does is it separates you to move your thoughts from the evil to the good so in other words you should leave church with more answers than you leave with confusions you should leave with a clear direction as opposed to which way do I go who do I follow are you hearing me the message of the hour separates your thoughts from the good or from the evil and the good now you all know the prophet teaches this Amen in a hidden life with Christ he says that every person lives in a three- room house no matter how big your house is how many rooms you got amen you only live in a three-bedroom house brother said now notice this God lived in a three room house back in his Tabernacle the congregation the courts of the congregation was the Holy place and then the holies of holies so what you're doing is you're moving from the outermost to the innermost you're moving from the outer Court to the inner court amen but you can't stop there you got to go to the holies of holies which the holies of holies amen was the innermost place of the sanctuary right now watch a prophet he said and now then the three rooms what represents just like the steps you come amen the place of a full consecration with Christ amen so the outer Court was the first step the inner Court was the Second Step but the holies of holies was the final step into a place of full consecration to the Lord Jesus Christ he said the kitchen is where you eat so the sinner comes to the meeting and he Feast on the word because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word so he comes to hear the word now watch a prophet many times we substitute so much instead of the word especially today we are substituting phenomenal we are substituting a lot of other things that shouldn't be now don't get mad at me but let me just say what a prophet said after all all the church is for preaching the word now if we want to sit around here how great you are Amen Let Us meet somewhere and have a cup of coffee so we'll at least be comfortable is that okay am mean if we want to hear how anointed you are at least let us get somewhere we kick our feet up and enjoy ourselves well God have mercy and not have to enjoy how intellectual and how intelligent you but the house of God is for the preaching of the word which means there should be nothing else in the p outside of the word of God he said testimonies are fine and different things we do is wonderful but we must give the word first place because it's for The Sinner and for the people that has the Holy Spirit also now come on Church brother Brandon put tongues in order because Paul said if the unlearn come in among you won't they all say you're crazy amen now listen church amen if a if an unlearned person comes in everybody speaking in tongues running all across the building amen you know what they're going to do they're going to walk out and say them people's crazy but a prophet put it in order now let's just go on to the next step if a sinner comes in and all they hear you talking about is how this message is not Jesus Christ and brother brandham had faults and there was failures in the message and brother brandham made mistakes they're going to walk out there and say them people's confused on what they believe amen but why don't we get back to just having church and not caring about what anybody thinks caring about what anybody says and just left the anointing of the Holy Ghost break out in the church again and bring a fire in there that'll heal the sick and raise the dead and save the lost the church is for the word it's okay to have testimonies but it's for the word see Jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by what every word not every testimony every word well come on Church let's get that devil out here and have church every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God you say preach you must be against testifying have you heard me preach I share testimonies but if that's not the direction of the body what oh God I'm get in trouble what God does in my Ministry is not your headship brother Tim what God uses me to do on the field is not the direction for the entire bride this message is the direction for the bride that's why I've got to lay myself aside and lay yourself in the message and hear what a prophet said to give the people a direction to go see the Holy Spirit feeds on the word of God he takes the word and he places it into your heart and makes you grow in strength amen good Bible exploits I love it he said so you see the argument of that just doesn't stand we're not to argue we are to preach the word so some guys get up and all they do is talk about themselves then other guys get up and spend all night arguing with a prophet amen but that's not what the pulpit is for the pulpit is for the faith of God to come into the Church of God and not just get on your flesh and not just get in your spirit but to go into the innermost and God will have some I love this God will have somebody that'll hear it and receive it are you ready for this those who Jesus died to hear the word they'll hear it those who Jesus died to hear the word they will hear it so you don't have to water it down to present it you don't have to back off of it to present it are you hearing me they'll just say what a prophet said because God never intended for his word to be accepted by intellectualism but by faith neither did he intend for the word to be hidden in the mind but to be hidden in the heart that's why the prophet said there's too much intellectual faith in the stead of being heart Faith there's too much intellectual faith in the stead of being heart Faith now brother B preaches an entire sermon amen if you get time listen to it you ought to do this week it's called believe from the heart 1957 believe from the heart amen now what is he showing you brother he's showing us that we're not believing from the head but we're believing from the heart in the Book of Proverbs 23:7 Bible says for as he thanketh in his heart so is he in Psalms 119:1 Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee in Romans 10:10 for with a heart man believeth under righteousness and with a mouth conf confession is made unto salvation now this is the quote I was on today when the spirit of the Lord just dropped in my study and be to show me some things on it he said therefore if a man or woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimonies and their lives so lined up with God Amen not this way not that way amen but the way which is God Amen until the channel of the Holy Spirit would be perfectly one with God Amen what would take place if the man and the woman could ever get lined up with the freedom from their hearts with Faith from their innermost amen if they could ever get their thoughts get their testimony brother Bill and their lives lined up in the channel of the holy spirit amen with freedom from their hearts and with Faith from the innermost he said now many people come to the altar to be prayed for they have intellectual Faith they confess their sins they join the church by intellectual Faith they believe it in their mind they believe it because they heard it they believe it because they know it's the best policy but that's not what God looks at he doesn't look at your intellectual Faith he looks on the heart or on the inside and when it comes from the heart all things are possible then then your confession meets up with your life and your life speaks as loud as your confession does but when your confession says one thing and your life another then there's something wrong somewhere because you you got an intellectual faith and not a Faith from your heart and that shows that the outside here is a knowledge of God but inside here is a demon of doubting you say I believe in Divine Healing but it's not for me you see it could be so but I don't believe it get it outside you say yes but inside your conscience says no listen church outside you get in the atmosphere of the sunlight and the candle light amen but that light will not sustain you on the rainy days and the cloudy days you got to get in the holies of holies where the light that is shining is not coming from a man it's not coming from a candle it's coming from the Shina himself shining in your heart you can be on the outside and say yes come on y'all know what I'm talking about y'all been enough good hot meetings on a Saturday night amen Holy Ghost get to moving and all of a sudden I'm going to make it ain't no devil going to stop me and wake up on Monday suay morning and every Devil's going to get you and every spirit's on you you know what that is you got to move where faith is you got to move into the faith of God where it's something beyond the emotions of the church come on now amen the outside's good to say yes but I want the inside to say yes I don't just want my outside come on y'all know me I love to dance I want my feet to say yes but sister Faith when my feet don't feel like dancing I still want my soul to say yes when my hands don't feel like clapping I still want my soul to say yes when my body don't feel like going to church I still want my soul to raise up and say yes we're going to the house of God because we're serving a God who is greater and bigger oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm talking about a God that can move on the depths of a Believer and can bring him to a stability around this message oh the outside says yes and the Conscience Says No get them lined up amen I'm going to preach you tonight he said just a moment everyone Reverend don't move stand still pray with all your heart don't be emotionally have faith your emotions will never build a material it builds intellectual Faith but it'll never build a faith in your heart so what are we going to do stand here and spend all night and explain that quote I'm going to preach and keep on moving because you're adopted Sons and Daughters of God I don't need to spend 15 minutes explaining I do believe in Emotion see oh I'm getting in trouble sure is the world that's what happens when we make a man the filter instead of the message if you're listening to the message you know brother BR said wildfire and then he said and then he said sing solid gospel teaching some other day they said you know they said there's a real famous quote right now I said what is that they said Jesus picked up the Scrolls read the word Supreme anointing supreme power is the anointing it's in control you know the quote right and sat down and and precious words proceed out of their mouth so some guy asked me brother Sean he said you ever preach that I said oh yeah I preached that before they said now you got to be careful quoting that quote you got to be real careful I said why they said because if you quote it somebody's going to thank you King shout I said brother I've quoted that quote dancing down the aisle of a church are you hearing me because my faith knows what a prophet was saying I have been brought to a stability there's a faith in my soul that says a prophet was not confusing the church he was given the church a place to stand and emotions is not a place to stand though we believe in them but the faith of God is not built upon the shifting Sands of a man's emotions the faith of God is built on thus sayith the Lord or that man keeps still now don't get built up he said he said it'll never build a faith in your heart let the word sink down let the word sink down come on you want to shout amen get in a good meeting and listen to the message and let let that message sink from your flesh and beyond your spirit and let that word sink down in your soul it'll give you something to shout about while the preacher's preaching it'll give you something to run the a about why because it's the word igniting the faith of God in the heart of the believer I could say that light bulb what are you shining for he'd say to me if he could speak brother brandom it's not me shining I'm just a wire and a bulb here but it's something running through me well I feel it here tonight brother Tim it's something running through me and it's making me shine brother Andrew why are you shouting cuz it's something running through me and it's making me shout brother Andrew why are you preaching amen faith in a fearful age because there's something running through you tonight that's igniting something in you to believe this word yes sir it's the very man that's born of the spirit of God he can't help from believing God woo brother a man born of the the spirit of God he can't help believing God he does things because the power of God from a great Dynamo Yonder a generator that's moving in that man's innermost beings glory to God well give me some room are you hearing me Church why are you feeling what you're feeling it's not coming from this whole preacher it's coming from another dimension and it's oh God and it's piercing in your soul and it's generating something come on y'all know good well you come in here and could hardly stay awake when he was on your way to church but now you feel like you could run through a troop and leap over a wall you know what that is amen that's the dynamite that's the Dynamics of the faith of God shining in the heart of a Son of God Amen and there's something moving and he said what's he going to do he's going to shine out a testimony for the glory of God I love what the prophet says he said give us Faith Lord as that little rude expression a while ago that I'm made about the power of God being in us and all of our Fiers to be light of God and darkness and sin had choked up little pores in US of our soul come on where is he talking about not talking about your flesh not talking about your spirit he's oh God he's talking about your innermost come on church that's why the fire's got to get in your soul because when the when the when the when the pores of the flesh get stopped up and the spirit's real low amen just let that fire then you're Soul loose and it'll push out all the carbon it'll push out all the unbelief it'll push out all the worries of the day he said yes sir let the Holy Ghost this morning spread forth in our being pressing Faith somebody say pressing Faith pressing Faith out into our innermost being that our whole bodies and lives will be so saturated with the power of God till people will see that Jesus Christ amen lives in his church well I think it's it's a good Wednesday night brother Bob to let the fire of God Amen fall in the Church of God and blow out all the coal blow out all the doubts blow out all the problems blow out all the bitterness blow out all the heaviness and let this world see that there's somebody on the earth that is more than just a church member they're more than just a bride member they are a living manifested Messiah and the faith of God is shining through them well glory to God that's a that's a powerful preaching quote amen the pores of our soul let the Holy Ghost this morning spread forth in our being pressing Faith somebody say Lord Press Your Faith Lord press your faith press it through my soul out into my spirit oh come on y'all know what I'm talking about amen we don't serve God from the outside in we serve God from the inside out you're come on Church y'all know I'm telling the truth amen some of y'all right here tonight you're flesh was against you coming to church your spirit was against you coming to church but here you are I said here you are you know why because in your soul there was a Dynamo of the power of God and you knew if I just get in the atmosphere and the Holy Ghost gets to move and and the word gets to flow and before long something going to strike my soul and it's going to push out the worry going to push out the bad day going to push out the bad report and my soul's going to get a refreshing from the presence of God on a Wednesday night I'm not a crazy man you're Soul one in this service somebody shout my soul one brother Sean how many sermons have we preached that our flesh didn't win and our spirit didn't win but our soul won if it was up to our flesh we would have stayed in bed if it was up to our spirit we wouldn't have stood before the people but there was a Dynamo in our soul and there was a fire shut up in our bones ready to express that Jesus Christ is still a god of his word somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah out thank God my soul one thank God my soul one thank God my soul one brother Sam you're Soul one sister Mindy you're Soul one are you hearing me that's why you're still here it's CZ greater is he that's in your soul verily I say unto you whosoever shall say un this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and what shall not doubt in his what heart in his innermost shall believe that those things which he say shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith he shall have whatsoever he sayith listen to Prophet well it seems like being up thinking those things that there could be a placing there could be a placing by reading the word of faith that would go beyond the intellectual conceptions Into the Heart Jesus said if Thou shalt say in their heart in the heart now watch this we cannot somebody say cannot we cannot mix the intellectual with the supernatural they have no dealings with each other at all the intellectual says one thing brother Matthew but the supernatural says another so we got to stay where Jesus is the way well we're not saying one thing and another thing we're all saying the same thing he said any man ever led by the spirit of God does not take any thought but he's LED from his heart by the spirit of God and that man is misunderstood I can prove that to you by Hannah in the temple she went to the temple and when she walked in brother Branson the priest actually thought she was drunk she said I'm not drunk on strong drink she said no he said and that's way a lot of people are that get sincere is they're just misunderstood she she wasn't drunk she was misunderstood and any men and women who are really from the core of their heart really fully surrendered to the Lord Jesus Christ they're not crazy they're misunderstood the world knows their own and God knows his own now listen God could have put that Bab in Hannah's arms he said but what he did was he made her wait he said now listen he said could have put that baby in her arms if he wanted to but he has a way of doing things it don't make any difference whether it happened right there or not she had God's word sunk in her heart Oh Glory Church she had God's word sunk in her heart and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God she accepted it right then and she went home rejoicing praise God I'm going to have the baby and in N9 months little Samuel was born why because she took God at his word faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God listen she seen how it come to Sarah she seen how it come to Sarah she seen how it was going to come to her woo brother she seen how it come to Sarah but she seen how it was going to come to her listen church we seen how a Rapture translation come to Enoch we seen how it come to Enoch and brother Junior because we seen that it come to Enoch we stand here tonight and say it's going to come to us because if it come to Enoch it's going to come to us because the same Rock of Revelation that Enoch hid in the pyramid has been released by the opening of the word and the bride is standing in the same place Enoch stood oh oh my well give me a little shout room tonight sister Jane I got something to shout about if Enoch made it I'm going to make it if Enoch walked out of here I'm going to walk out of here come on you got to get your faith off of this way and that way and get your faith back on the way the way of Revelation the way of face power the way of bringing things to pass by Revelation Sarah believed Abraham now watch says can I have a few more minutes Sarah believed Abraham how did it come to Sarah brother Bob Sarah believed Abraham now watch a prophet and the only thing Sarah had to do was to believe what Abraham her husband said Woo brother she didn't feel like it but she believed it brother Tim when Abraham was confessing Sarah you're going to have that child Abraham had to give her so God he had to give her somewhere to stand Beyond her dried up milk veins Beyond her dead womb beyond the wrinkles in her head he had to give her a revelation and he gave her a revelation to stand on he said that's a beautiful picture there of church in Christ God spoke to Abraham and told Abraham Sarah's bride wife and God speaks to Christ and we are his wife his bride now listen church if Sarah was going to have that baby she couldn't listen to this way and she couldn't listen that way she had to listen to the way she had to listen to the Revelation said watch now now can I can I can I just say a few things from my heart here listen it's a prophetic warning can you take a prophetic warning be careful what we're listening to be careful what we're listening to cuz if Sarah would have listen to the doctor she would have taken her eyes off of the Revelation and got them on the dead womb she would have got them on the dried up milk veins but she kept oh God she kept her eyes on the Revelation that Abraham give her to stand come on bride you need somewhere to stand there is a place to stand I love how brother brother bisco brought it out one time he said there's a place by me amen are you hearing me you want to stand somewhere don't stand by this Doctrine don't stand by this move amen but God has given the bride a place to stand and there's a place by the bridegroom for the Bride of Jesus Christ to stand by come on Church walk out of the Traditions walk out of the ideas and come stand by my side come stand by the word somebody say preacher what side are you going to take amen while I'm here I might as well preach at I Judah I'm a little sick and tired of hearing this whose side are you on y'all forgive me I'm just preaching at home tonight I'm a little tired of hearing whose side are you on are you on the formal side are you on the motional side are you on the emotional side when in God's name did it become a formal side side and an emotional side only side I'm on is a side of prophet preach and he called it taking sides with Jesus I stand with Jesus I stand with the Bible I stand with the message I stand with a pillar of fire I stand with that picture I stand with the Holy Ghost coming in the church and changing situations God gave me a place to stand somebody shout hallelujah he give us a place to stand when the Winds of doct are Hing he give us a place to stand when men are walking away he give us a place to stand brother Sean we're standing on the Revelation be careful what you're listening to be careful what you're listening to now I'm going to tell you exactly what a prophet said it behooves you my brother it behooves you my sister consider what you're listening at and don't you never underestimate Satan's power for deceiving he's as smooth as he can be that's right can I give you another one now I've always ask you to be careful what you're listening to because what you're listening to is connected to what you're believing whatever you're listening to is directly influencing what you're believing now today many people are listening to enticing Spirits instead of taking the word of God Spirits they're in the world they're demons they go out into places they get amongst men ministers they get amongst church members they get amongst good people and they caus them to come into an illusion now don't get mad at me but cifi preaching around this message has opened the door for illusion shock Factor right sissified preaching has opened the door wide up to let Spirits just walk right in the church and now they're influencing the pull pit they're influencing the pews they're influencing the young people come on when men put gloves on oh God when they put gloves on and started preaching this message is when we started hearing people get up and say the cloud didn't happen well come on church it's when we started debating whether that picture should be in the church house or not well if it don't belong in a sanctuary somebody stand up and tell me where in the name of the Lord does it belong if it don't belong in a sanctuary then somebody pray tell me where does it belong does it belong in your barn does it belong in your wood shop amen come on Amen I'll go ahead and preach since I'm here amen I tell you where people want it they don't want it at all because if they're too ashamed to put it in the church they're ashamed to have it in their home they're ashamed to have it among their kids amen but I say thank God in this age that Jesus Christ come down in the form of a pillar of fire and he give me a place to stand and right here is where I stand I stand with this picture you can mock me criticize me laugh at me do what you want to but I stand with a visible Return of the pillar of fire my home has got it my office has got it come on church it's on my phone but Sean Martin thank god brother Sean thank you sir for putting it in the church and let the world know we stand with the Vindicated word of God I say thank you brother Sean thank you for not being ashamed to hang that picture up and let our young people know there's a power in that picture well enticing Spirits enticing Spirits trying to adopt new plans I tell you why we don't have prayer lines is they adopted psychology to fix marriages tried to adopt science to fix our sicknesses brother said they tried to I'm I'm closing that Devil's squirming right now now but y'all sicking me pretty good right now they're trying to adopt education to take the place of the Holy Ghost education will never take the place of the leadership of the Holy Spirit now tell you what it's all about oh my tell you what it's all about right here give me a few minutes and I'm done the devil is trying to establish the church in the wisdom of men instead of the power of God let's establish him in what a man can say and the way a man can counsel and the way a man can talk and the way a man can present let's get them over here in the wisdom and get them out of the power of God listen what the prophet said he said you know that Satan's gospel is knowledge he said now sometimes we make the church programs they also call for their Pastor the church goes to vote the pastor they say well this pastor now he's got two degrees in college he learned four years of psychology thank you brother brandom he took this that and the other and they'll vote that kind of man in instead of a pastor who believes in God's word being inspired and being God and will preach the word regardless of how the people feel about it he said now God told Ezekiel preach that where they believe it or not you preach it anyhow see right where they accept it or not that ain't it they didn't accept Jesus but he went right on preaching just the same can I dedicate this to our pastor will that be okay instead of a real Pastor that will really preach the word of God and believe in God they try to bring in the intellect the man who has the best education stands in the pull pit don't take more than 15 minutes can get us home right quick and Ricky can hot rod and start out and go the twist parties and it's nothing but a hybrid pollution he said that's right he said now watch he said that's exactly right it satisfies their taste it satisfies a worldly Church member's taste he said but it don't satisfy a oh God it don't satisfy a Saint's taste he said if you're a real son or daughter of God he said when your pastor's in the pull pit and he's preaching that word you'll say preach it anyhow preacher preach it anyhow preacher come on I know what I'm talking about amen I may not be here every service but I've driven down the road long enough and heard this man preach and I spoke out in my car preach it anyhow preacher you know why because he's laboring to bring a faith in the church to Pi give you a place to stand brother Sean we thank you for preaching this message we thank you for standing with this word we thank you for not changing this way and changeing that way and turning this way brother Sean We Salute You we thank you for standing where a prophet give us a place to stand you know what I say we ought to kick every devil out of the house of God and stand with the man of God and the word of God and the power of God and the pillar of fire of God because faith faith is in the church what do you get getting that preacher I'm getting it this right here and I'm done brother says it like this he said now watch they'll preach it anyhow because the word is what produces the victory they're not looking at the reaction of the people the man's Works declares his character and Christ was God's work so he preaches the word regardless now y'all ever I just listen this today and Believe from the heart said Here I Am the other day down there with the two Woods Brothers Banks and L he said brother Woods said to his brother L he said I would it be would it not be great now he's talking about that old sister you know that got saved around so would it not be great now if we go back and find that old sister and let her know that we're saved now Brother Sam here is a prophet of God y'all forgive me here is a prophet of God in a boat with the with the Woods Brothers and he has a vision there's going to be a resurrection of life right and in the vision he's going to go through muddy waters and all these things but while they're in the boat brother Junior one of them looks at the other and says wouldn't it be good to go back and tell that old Jehovah Witness lady we're saved and brother said when they said that he said now that word found favor with God come on Church everywhere else brother Terry we preach we found favor with God God we found but these words found favor with God he said now watch for a long time he said those two Jehovah Witness boys both them aged men wanting to find an old woman and tell her they was saved two brothers and when they said that the spirit of God and his sovereignty fell on me sitting there in that boat oh I wish I could had a voice some way I could sink that into the people's heart I could not no more control myself than you could fly to the moon just by that word and I said boys there's something fixing to happen it's a little animal of some sort it'll be brought to life there's going to be life connected with it and you will see it right away and I thought now what have I said and I begin to think of some things what made me say that no vision it was just something spoke are you hearing me if you have faith in God and do not doubt in your heart you can have whatsoever things you say he said what was it it wasn't my intellectuals I couldn't even think of such a thing it was down below that oh God it was down below that brother Junior in the heart that God had come into he was doing the speaking I didn't even wasn't thinking of such a thing but spoke oh God I got here too late I'm sorry I think there is where Jesus said if thou believest in the heart and shall say to this tree or this mountain then don't doubt but believe what you will say to come to pass you will have what you say are you ready for this there's my point get to that spot to where it's something is not yourself it's something beyond your reason that speaks it and you say from your heart God it's the truth and there alone I stand are you hearing me brother Terry here's a prophet in the boat with two Woods Brothers and his brother Bob he's ready to stand by himself listen if the Woods Brothers wouldn't have believed it William Brandon would have believed it because the intellectual had gone beyond it was in his heart he said and let that just keep in here until it drops into here and from your head to your heart and becomes a reality Let It Go from your head into your heart and then let it become a reality are you hearing me Church Mark 11 was in his head brother junior he was thinking on Mark 11 brother Sean but when something in his heart spoke and said there'll be aive connected to this today amen it moved from his head to his heart

prophet brother Daniel a prophet stood with the word and he give us a place to stand now can I just show you something can I show you that a prophet's teach and move Beyond Divine Healing it moved Beyond just teaching knew how to believe for healing but a prophet's teaching moved into character building divine nature y'all know in Matthew 17 when they saw Jesus transfigured Peter James and John

place to [Music] stand he gave us a place did he not did God give us a place to stand hallelujah hallelujah amen you know just thinking U been thinking a lot past couple days you know uh it was said that pictures like that right there is not a Fitting Place for the house of God and [Music] uh caused some confusion with the young people and SW is because when people come in they think we're worshiping that man right there now there's all kinds of pictures of brother Brandon and you'll never find one in this Sanctuary I got to thinking if you if you cut that picture out take take brother brand out and all you got is that Pillar of Fire now most people's got that right there that picture of Jesus Christ and like one Minister said that ain't Jesus Christ that's just some man's I idea of what Jesus Christ looked like now brother Brown said that's the closest to what Jesus Christ looks like but that's not but that there is God you you can't get any closer that that's not a painting that's that's God that's the same Pillar of Fire that was with Moses and all the way through that that's that's it now if we take that brother Brandon totally out of that picture and we just keep the pillar of fire we totally defeat what God done there we totally defeated if if God just wanted his picture taken he he could have had a picture taken anywhere he could have moved in the in the the art gallery or the the photographer gallery and moved on a photographer to just take a picture and there' be the pillar of fire but the point was the point was God would answer all of our questions by fire he in his wisdom didn't think about his elect worshiping that [Music] man but when the questions would rise today and Ministries would rise today and preach all kinds of stuff to where the people don't know what to believe God Answers by fire and says believe that believe the voice believe what he says he gives us a place to stand because God stood there too too that's God standing taking his place in this generation and says I'll be willing to have my picture taken any other man I challenge you the millions of of pictures that you want outside the message in Dr doson TD Jake Billy Graham o Roberts bringing on in Shawn Martin uh uh brother Terry Horn brother Wayne Lawson brother Tim PR brother Ron Spencer brother coffee any brother Donnie Reagan to to uh brother Amos cuts and anyone put all the pictures up there that we could just keep putting on on the screen and you'll never see a pillar of fire one time would you have a pillar of fire over anyone's head but God took his picture with the prophet and he gives us he gives us a place to stand and says I'm behind him can you say Amen so we're not worshiping a man now yes Washington DC has a picture just like that it's got the authentic but you know what to go to see that picture you have to ask for the picture you have to ask to see the picture then you've got to go and sign all kinds of forms before you can even see the picture but how many people how many of us have been to the White House to see the picture have y any of y'all seen a picture of course not so we provide a picture so you don't have to travel all the way to washingon to see a picture can you say Amen God's just been so good to us so young people if you want to know where to stand God stood by stand with him we're not worshiping the prophet at all that what he said is the truth stand with him can you say amen you love the Lord I sure love the Lord amen I thought of how that you know when that picture was taken it was the critics God's Own critics that took that picture right and and and you know where God took it at brother Brandon wasn't in an art gallery or a phot photographer in in some private you know where it was before the people thousands of people gathered and it was a big old debate right some some unbeliever was trying to criticize brother brandom's Healing Ministry and say that Divine Healing was a fraud and all of that and that's where God took his picture at ain't that right so Satan could not could could not keep the people from doubting amen cuz brother Brown said they all saw it right there they saw that Pillar of Fire come over his head and then you know and and uh but now Satan is so cunning in this age that he now that is God yes that is God and that that that's that's Vindicated that's authentic but notice how he does it now but you can't put it in the church now can't put it in the church because you'll be worshiping a man and you don't want to be identified with that so what does he want us to do be embarrassed of the picture now he couldn't stop it couldn't stop God from getting his picture taken but now he wants to be ashamed of it go put it in your closet somewhere n we're not going to put it in the closet can you say Amen you love the Lord amen God bless you keep brother Andrew in your prayer and and keep the ministry in your prayer amen that God will just uh uh you know give us strength in the hands and and uh of the ministry I I want to say I love and appreciate every one of you ministers that are preaching this gospel God bless you richly and it's good to have brother Amos back with us a man that been sick and uh uh certainly uh glad to have him back sister Bethany back and U brother shemiah fell off a ladder yesterday I guess and and u a 6 foot 8ot 8ft ladder on the very top and so he's a little sore and so we want to keep him in our prayer and Britany and Autumn amen want to keep them and keep keep sister Brooke as most I guess all you all have heard now that she's got kidney stones and bless her heart my heart goes out for her and uh you know fixing to have that child and now dealing with this and so let's just really pray and and uh God would just help
