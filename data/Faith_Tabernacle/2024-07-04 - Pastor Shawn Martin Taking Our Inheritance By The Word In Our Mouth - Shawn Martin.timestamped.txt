[46:43] amen praise the Lord um the Book of
[46:47] Joshua the uh 14th chapter and we're
[46:51] going to start at the seventh verse we
[46:53] had read this last Wednesday I believe
[46:57] but it says 40 years old was I and this
[46:59] is Caleb speaking to
[47:01] [Music]
[47:02] Joshua and says when Moses the servant
[47:06] of the Lord sent me from Kadesh barnea
[47:09] to asy out the land and I brought him
[47:13] word again as it was in Mine
[47:15] Heart nevertheless my brethren that went
[47:18] up with me made the heart of the people
[47:21] melt but I holy I holy follow the Lord
[47:25] my God and Moses aware on that day or
[47:30] swear on that day saying surely the land
[47:34] where on thy feet have trotten shall be
[47:36] thine inheritance and thy children's
[47:39] forever because thou H has wholly
[47:41] followed the Lord my
[47:42] God and now behold the Lord hath kept me
[47:46] alive as he said these 40 and5 years
[47:50] even since the the Lord spake this word
[47:52] unto Moses while the children of Israel
[47:55] wandered in the wilderness and now lo I
[47:57] am this day four score and 5 years
[48:01] old as yet I am as strong this day as I
[48:05] was in the day that Moses sent me as my
[48:09] strength was then even so is my strength
[48:11] now for war both to go out and to come
[48:15] in now therefore give me this mountain
[48:19] whereof the Lord spake in that day for
[48:21] thou Hast for thou heardest in that day
[48:25] how the uh Anakin
[48:27] uh were there and that the cities were
[48:30] great and fenced if so be the Lord will
[48:34] be with me then I shall be able to drive
[48:37] them out as the Lord said amen you can
[48:42] have your seats this
[48:44] evening and
[48:48] um um last week we just uh uh talking
[48:52] about Caleb and um and I want to maybe
[48:57] just uh talk some more about him and
[49:00] maybe use the um the title taking our
[49:04] inheritance by the word of our
[49:07] mouth and Caleb was a True Believer uh
[49:13] he wholly follow the lord yes and he did
[49:17] this by believing the message of the
[49:19] hour that uh the prophet Moses brought
[49:23] un unto unto them and so uh we know that
[49:28] Caleb was a Believer because he showed
[49:30] what he was there at Kadesh
[49:33] Baria and and we know that Kadesh barnea
[49:36] was the place of judgment right and
[49:39] before God would allow uh uh Israel to
[49:43] go into the promised land and you have
[49:46] to remember that th this God had
[49:49] promised them this inheritance for for
[49:52] many years ahead before and and and God
[49:57] had moved in many miraculous
[50:00] ways uh uh throughout the journey even
[50:03] their deliverance from Egypt uh out of
[50:06] Egypt was a miraculous thing and so the
[50:09] supernatural followed them they had the
[50:12] pillar of fire the uh that followed them
[50:15] by Night Cloud by day and and these
[50:18] things and so uh uh but uh and there was
[50:22] a lot of Trials a lot of things but
[50:24] right before God would allow to go into
[50:27] the promised land he led them to Kadesh
[50:30] Baria a place of judgment and and this
[50:34] would be the the final test God would
[50:36] bring them to this final test and uh uh
[50:41] and and this would uh uh prove them and
[50:44] so he sent God sent 12 Spies uh into the
[50:48] land and Caleb and Joshua was was part
[50:51] of that and so when they they saw the
[50:55] land um
[50:57] and they brought evidence of the land
[51:00] back uh that Moses had said would be
[51:04] there and and and they brought it all
[51:06] back and and so then the these 12 Spies
[51:11] had to give their
[51:12] report and and uh uh uh as to what they
[51:17] saw what they heard and and as to what
[51:21] they thought as to what uh you know they
[51:24] they thought of the land and so now now
[51:27] this testing the prophet said God loves
[51:29] to put your faith uh to a test to see
[51:32] how you would act on it let you be
[51:35] anointed and prayed for and then make
[51:38] you worse and say come on Satan put him
[51:41] to the test I know he believes me bless
[51:43] God forever oh my see put him to the
[51:46] test now see I know he took my word for
[51:49] it and and then he asked the question
[51:51] can he say that about you he said that
[51:53] about job he said do anything you want
[51:55] to but don't you take his life for I
[51:58] know he loves me he's made the burnt
[52:00] offering he's made the requirements he
[52:02] did what I told him to do and he
[52:04] believes it now roll him over the coal
[52:07] if you want to so so God loves to put us
[52:10] through the test and so this test is
[52:11] nothing strange uh uh if God done it
[52:14] back then he does it today and and uh uh
[52:18] you know and and so uh uh brother random
[52:21] another place said God puts our faith to
[52:23] a test to see if we really believe that
[52:27] he is God ain't that right to really
[52:30] believe that he is God see where we're
[52:32] at with all of this see so now God never
[52:35] told them about the Giants in that land
[52:37] as far as I know he he never told them
[52:40] you know about the obstacles uh uh per
[52:42] se but when they came back uh the when
[52:45] the 12 Spies uh 10 of them gave their
[52:49] report and their report was there's
[52:50] Giants in the land it's we were as
[52:53] grasshoppers in their sight you know and
[52:56] we we uh uh we ourselves uh felt like we
[52:59] were grasshoppers you know as as
[53:02] grasshoppers you know and and so uh uh
[53:05] and and and and then the report was you
[53:08] know we can't make it we're not able to
[53:10] take that land it's it's just impossible
[53:13] see and so but but so so they gave an
[53:17] evil report and and but Joshua and Caleb
[53:21] uh uh well the Bible says that Caleb had
[53:23] a different Spirit he had another spirit
[53:26] which we understand that to be the
[53:28] spirit of God and and and he stealed the
[53:31] people and he gave the report that yeah
[53:34] yeah that may be true but look at the
[53:37] evidence everything that God promised us
[53:40] would be there is there and here it is
[53:43] and and so we're more than able to take
[53:46] the land and see so we we know now that
[53:50] that of course God says no they ain't
[53:52] going in because all the people believe
[53:54] the 10 spies over the uh Jos josu and
[53:56] Caleb and so they they all frightened
[53:59] and and God says all right they will not
[54:01] go into the promised land they they
[54:03] ain't going in and and of course they
[54:05] said oh yeah we will go in and they went
[54:07] in they got they got their britches beat
[54:09] right and and so uh uh well they they
[54:12] died uh God let them die in the
[54:15] wilderness and then when when Joshua God
[54:18] raised up Joshua to take a new
[54:21] generation over into the promised land
[54:25] and Caleb was with them that went over
[54:29] there now Joshua represented the the
[54:31] promised end time leader to take the
[54:34] church over the prophet said and Caleb
[54:37] represents the True Believer who
[54:40] followed Joshua into the land and stayed
[54:43] with him ain't that right amen see so
[54:46] Caleb amen he he passed the test he was
[54:50] he was the only one him and Joshua out
[54:53] of that two and a half million people
[54:55] that passed test that says I don't care
[54:58] about Giants I don't care about wal City
[55:00] I don't care about the obstacles we're
[55:03] more than able to take the land amen and
[55:06] and you find I think it's I think it's
[55:07] strange that that Joshua the end time
[55:10] leader amen and and uh uh uh Caleb the
[55:14] the the True Believer that would follow
[55:17] Joshua into the promised land at that
[55:19] time at Kadesh Baria when everybody else
[55:23] was saying no we can't do it Joshua and
[55:26] K CB were saying the same thing amen
[55:29] both of them saying the same thing which
[55:31] is is interesting because the prophet
[55:34] said in this last day listen to the
[55:37] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[55:39] in this last s and what he says from God
[55:43] the bride will say Amen the spirit the
[55:47] prophet and the bride will be saying the
[55:49] same thing can you say Amen so Joshua
[55:52] and Caleb have been saying the same
[55:55] thing a what the spirit had been telling
[55:58] them all along ain't that right well so
[56:01] is it today amen people are walking away
[56:03] from the message people are talking
[56:06] contrary to the message amen but there
[56:08] is a true people of God that are saying
[56:11] the same thing amen that the prophet has
[56:14] told us you're more than able you to
[56:16] take the land you are more than able
[56:18] Amen to go through whatever you're going
[56:20] through and the bride will say amen I am
[56:24] able I I know I am able can you say amen
[56:28] that's right see so in our our opening
[56:31] scripture amen Caleb is in the land of
[56:34] promise now and and of course the the
[56:37] the promised land represented the age of
[56:40] the Overcomer amen see the land was
[56:43] theirs to possess amen it it was theirs
[56:47] to possess it was their inheritance but
[56:50] the Giants occupied the land the world
[56:52] cities uh uh there was obstacles in that
[56:55] land and so they're going to have to
[56:57] overcome amen every obstacle in that
[57:01] land if they're going to take their
[57:03] position you you can't they they weren't
[57:05] God didn't call them just to wander in
[57:07] the land god called them to come into
[57:10] that L land and place them positionally
[57:14] exactly where they are to be ain't that
[57:17] right so in that land see Caleb he had a
[57:20] right to lay claim he had a right to lay
[57:23] claim to the land amen I looked up that
[57:25] word lay claim it means to demand as
[57:28] one's property Amen to assert one's
[57:32] right or title to to say that you own it
[57:36] ain't that right so this is what Caleb
[57:38] was doing there's that there was a
[57:40] portion of land that was given to him by
[57:44] a prophet's word amen and now he was
[57:47] laying claim to that land amen not
[57:49] asking the enemy not asking the those
[57:52] that were already uh uh uh inhabiting
[57:55] the land would you please give give it
[57:56] to me oh no no no he was laying claim to
[57:59] that land that Land Is Mine amen you can
[58:03] move off whatever of course you know
[58:05] they weren't going to move off and so uh
[58:08] he had to fight them amen but see uh uh
[58:11] uh they they had to lay claim amen and
[58:14] so this is what Caleb was doing was
[58:16] laying claim to what rightfully belonged
[58:19] to him you see he had a right to lay
[58:21] claim to it do you believe that he had a
[58:23] right to lay claim to it it wasn't just
[58:25] something that he wanted and was wishing
[58:28] for God gave him that land amen that
[58:31] that's the thing see so if he had a
[58:33] right to claim it then it it made it a
[58:36] legal claim what he was claiming now
[58:39] he's not one of these squatters out here
[58:41] that that that takes over somebody's
[58:43] house and says well it's mine and yet
[58:45] they ain't got the title deed they ain't
[58:46] got nothing to that amen that's what was
[58:49] in Caleb see Caleb had a legal right to
[58:53] possess the land that belonged to him
[58:56] and his claim was a confession of faith
[59:00] God gave it to me that land is mine it's
[59:03] just like ours today we've got a
[59:05] confession of Faith healing is mine
[59:07] victory is mine Deliverance is mine
[59:10] Heaven Is Mine The Rapture is mine
[59:13] everything that God promised is mine
[59:15] because it's I'm laying claim to every
[59:18] promise of God that belongs to me amen
[59:21] it's a confession of faith and we know
[59:23] what a confession means it is it means
[59:26] to say the same thing as in other words
[59:29] to repeat what has already been said and
[59:33] when Caleb said give me my Mountain this
[59:35] mountain belongs to me he was only
[59:38] making a confession of what had already
[59:41] been spoken by the prophet of God can
[59:44] you say amen that's right see and and so
[59:47] therefore the prophet's word became his
[59:50] absolute amen that's right and so is it
[59:53] today this message is every true
[59:56] believer's absolute if God said it to
[1:00:00] that Prophet I believe it can you say
[1:00:02] amen and a True Believer we're not we're
[1:00:04] not wavering off of it we're not varying
[1:00:07] off of it I don't care how bad it gets I
[1:00:09] don't care how hot the battle becomes I
[1:00:13] don't care how strong The Temptations
[1:00:15] come I don't care if my feelings leave
[1:00:17] me and how low I feel amen God said
[1:00:21] every promise is mine amen and we're
[1:00:24] going to take we won't take the doctor's
[1:00:26] words for an absolute I ain't taking
[1:00:28] some other preacher's words for an
[1:00:29] absolute I'm taking what a prophet said
[1:00:32] amen because the prophet the word of God
[1:00:35] comes to a prophet you see you have
[1:00:37] every legal right to lay claim to
[1:00:40] everything that Jesus Christ died for do
[1:00:43] you believe that amen see now the word
[1:00:46] the word amen he believed the word that
[1:00:49] a prophet had spoke and that word he
[1:00:51] believed it from the heart amen the
[1:00:54] prophet preached the message believe
[1:00:56] from the heart amen well Caleb believe
[1:00:58] from the heart amen and that word that
[1:01:01] was in his heart now was in his mouth
[1:01:04] and he began to speak exactly what a
[1:01:07] prophet told him amen as I said last
[1:01:10] Wednesday amen the Moses wasn't there to
[1:01:13] remind Joshua amen about the promises of
[1:01:15] God that he didn't need to be there amen
[1:01:18] because Caleb had hid that word down in
[1:01:22] his heart amen I I I I think that's
[1:01:24] where we are today amen it would have
[1:01:26] been nice to have brother brandom here
[1:01:28] amen with us to remind us of the
[1:01:30] promises and all these things amen but
[1:01:33] what they the world don't understand
[1:01:35] they can burn the books they can burn
[1:01:36] the Bible they can tear the tapes they
[1:01:39] can take everything away from us but the
[1:01:41] bride has already received that word
[1:01:44] down in her heart and now it's in her
[1:01:47] mouth can you say amen amen you can't
[1:01:50] take it away from this bride yes sir now
[1:01:53] see so this is exactly what Jesus was
[1:01:56] meaning when he said in Luke 6:45 a good
[1:02:00] man out of The Treasure of his heart
[1:02:03] bringeth forth that which is good and an
[1:02:05] evil man out of The Treasure of his
[1:02:08] heart bringeth forth that which is evil
[1:02:11] for of the bundance of the heart his
[1:02:13] mouth speaketh ain't that right so
[1:02:16] therefore this tells us that Caleb was a
[1:02:18] True Believer at heart amen he had the
[1:02:22] word not in his head not in his
[1:02:24] intellect but it had come into his heart
[1:02:27] amen and and he had gone through trials
[1:02:30] he had gone through things amen and and
[1:02:32] and it seemed like amen as as as the
[1:02:36] longer that time carried amen uh uh the
[1:02:39] older he got amen and yet he would still
[1:02:42] tell Joshua I know I'm older but I'm
[1:02:45] still as strong as I was when Moses
[1:02:47] first gave me the the word amen gave me
[1:02:50] the promise amen that's a True Believer
[1:02:52] can you say Amen see so so this Falls in
[1:02:56] line with what the scripture teaches
[1:02:59] amen uh uh because of a real believer
[1:03:02] amen 1 John 37 little children let no
[1:03:06] man deceive you he that doeth or worketh
[1:03:09] righteousness is righteous even as he is
[1:03:14] righteous the prophet says that what
[1:03:16] that means is what a man does he is can
[1:03:20] you say amen amen what a man does he is
[1:03:24] amen I know there was a me to and half
[1:03:26] Millions following amen the message of
[1:03:28] that hour and they had seen all the
[1:03:30] signs and all the Wonders and they had
[1:03:32] partook of many things amen but at that
[1:03:36] testing time amen they failed amen they
[1:03:39] showed their colors they showed exactly
[1:03:42] what they were the prophet said they
[1:03:44] were unbelievers ain't that right but
[1:03:46] here was a man had gone to the test had
[1:03:49] gone to the tries had seen the same
[1:03:51] Giants that they saw had seen the same
[1:03:53] old cities that they saw amen but he had
[1:03:56] the word in his heart and therefore he
[1:03:58] would not let negative come into his
[1:04:01] mouth he would not let doubt come into
[1:04:03] his mouth because doubt wasn't in his
[1:04:05] heart amen Faith was in his heart belief
[1:04:08] was in his heart amen and his mouth
[1:04:11] expressed what was really there amen he
[1:04:14] was a True Believer James 3:11 do a
[1:04:17] fountain send forth at the same place
[1:04:20] Sweet Water and bitter see you can't do
[1:04:23] it see brother brandom said to say
[1:04:25] something amen that is not in your heart
[1:04:27] shows you're a hypocrite amen a
[1:04:29] hypocrite you can you can say something
[1:04:31] and if it's not in the heart it's a sign
[1:04:34] of a hypocrite but Caleb was no
[1:04:36] hypocrite can you say amen amen see so
[1:04:39] Romans 62 how shall we s how shall we
[1:04:43] that that are dead to sin live any
[1:04:46] longer therein amen see so a man is
[1:04:50] changed amen and shows what he is but as
[1:04:54] we said the 10 spies were Believers amen
[1:04:57] so therefore they gave the negative
[1:04:59] report to the people amen because that's
[1:05:01] the only thing they could think about
[1:05:03] that's the only thing they could see
[1:05:05] amen yeah they saw the they they saw the
[1:05:07] evidence amen but but but the the the
[1:05:11] the negative was was Far overwhelming
[1:05:14] for them to believe in the evidence that
[1:05:17] God had for them amen see and so they
[1:05:20] saw the Giants that's all they could
[1:05:22] think about they that's all they could
[1:05:23] think about is the world cities all they
[1:05:26] could think about was the the negative
[1:05:28] the impossibilities and they couldn't
[1:05:30] get over it no matter what God had done
[1:05:32] they couldn't get over it you understand
[1:05:34] what I'm saying church it's time we got
[1:05:36] to over things amen and look at the
[1:05:39] promise of God Amen for what it is amen
[1:05:42] get over things amen see so they only
[1:05:45] saw the negative they only thought about
[1:05:47] the negative they only talked about the
[1:05:48] negative amen they only they they only
[1:05:51] live the negative amen see and so Paul
[1:05:54] would tell us that they had an evil
[1:05:57] heart of unbelief can you say Amen so
[1:06:02] what they were is they were anointed to
[1:06:04] disbelief amen anointed to disbelief
[1:06:08] amen that's what the prophet said see so
[1:06:10] now but we we as the bride of Christ how
[1:06:13] many believe you're the bride of Christ

[1:07:37] to defeat our enemy if we're going to
[1:07:40] come and be positionally placed in the
[1:07:43] in our inheritance that means for our
[1:07:46] enemy amen it's not flesh and blood the
[1:07:48] Bible says we wrestle not against flesh
[1:07:50] and blood amen so you're not wrestling
[1:07:53] against uh uh uh uh uh your neighor
[1:07:55] you're not wrestling against uh the the
[1:07:58] grer you're not wrestling against your

[1:08:18] anxiety you must conquer bitterness you
[1:08:21] must conquer unbelief you must conquer
[1:08:23] hard feelings you must conquer that old

[1:08:30] and let's put it the way the prophet
[1:08:31] said you are your biggest enemy amen
[1:08:34] you're your biggest enemy you've got to
[1:08:36] conquer complexes you've got to conquer
[1:08:39] things in your life it's you that's got
[1:08:41] to conquer yourself can you say amen
[1:08:44] amen that's right and we must do it if
[1:08:46] we're going to find our position in the
[1:08:49] land can you say Amen yes sir now we all
[1:08:53] know that it's going to take something
[1:08:54] greater than than us amen that's right
[1:08:57] for we're no match for the devil amen
[1:08:59] just like Caleb amen they might have
[1:09:01] thought he was just off the wall to say
[1:09:04] that we're able and maybe they try to
[1:09:05] look at him say now come on man you saw
[1:09:08] these 10 foot Giants and here you are 5
[1:09:10] feet you know and you you saw the I mean
[1:09:13] come on the ratio here you know the D I
[1:09:16] mean and then you say we're able but
[1:09:18] Caleb was not looking unto himself Caleb
[1:09:21] was no match for that enemy he was no
[1:09:24] match see but you see God never intended
[1:09:28] for us to face our enemy alone don't you
[1:09:32] try amen to go Toe to Toe with the devil
[1:09:36] on your own you ain't going to make it
[1:09:38] right can you say Amen but notice in
[1:09:41] John 20:21 Jesus said as my father has
[1:09:45] sent me so send I you as my father sent
[1:09:50] me so send I you and how did the father
[1:09:53] send him by going with him and being in
[1:09:57] him amen that's right and the same way
[1:10:00] the father sent Christ Christ sends us
[1:10:03] now we understand Christ in you the hope
[1:10:07] of
[1:10:08] glory Christ in you can you say amen
[1:10:12] that's right amen John I believe in John
[1:10:14] it says greater is he that is in you
[1:10:17] than he that is in this world Amen see
[1:10:20] no so now amen you cannot look at
[1:10:23] yourself as the victim because because
[1:10:25] you've got Christ in you that is a
[1:10:27] mighty conqueror amen he's already
[1:10:30] defeated the Devil he's already met the
[1:10:32] Devil he's already met your enemy and he
[1:10:34] defeated him on every turn do you
[1:10:37] believe that even when death took them
[1:10:39] prophets and death even took Caleb a
[1:10:42] physical death but here was Christ to
[1:10:44] lay down his life willfully and to raise
[1:10:48] it back up and he took the keys of death
[1:10:51] hell and the grave from from Satan
[1:10:54] toight now there is a a people on this
[1:10:57] Earth I believe they're living amen that
[1:11:00] will never ever taste death but they're
[1:11:03] going to be changed in a moment in a
[1:11:05] twinkling of an eye see greater is he
[1:11:08] greater is he everybody say greater is
[1:11:10] he that is in Me Greater is he amen see
[1:11:15] so if we believe that greater is he is
[1:11:17] in me than he that is in this world then
[1:11:20] we must not give one ounce to the devil
[1:11:22] we must not give one voice to a ear to
[1:11:25] the devil's voice amen the devil is a
[1:11:27] liar he's a father of Lies he'll tell
[1:11:30] you you're hopeless you're worthless
[1:11:32] you'll never make it but that's a lie
[1:11:35] but greater is he that is in
[1:11:39] me can you say Amen now the prophet said
[1:11:43] God makes himself present in his army
[1:11:46] see God sent his word amen and and uh
[1:11:50] they have walked all over the top of it
[1:11:52] and disbelieved it from Eve all the way
[1:11:55] amen then God sent his word and then God
[1:11:58] made his word manifested in flesh amen
[1:12:02] and they crucified it amen and God just
[1:12:05] says I'm just getting tired of it I'm
[1:12:07] going to come myself amen I'm coming
[1:12:10] myself I'm going to change this thing
[1:12:12] once and for all and so here he comes
[1:12:15] the prophet said God in you amen

[1:25:05] knew whatever wal city was in his way
[1:25:07] he'd take care of it amen it would it

[1:27:03] confession remained the
[1:27:06] same come on

[1:28:27] was already speaking it before it ever
[1:28:30] happened right true I I'll conquer that
[1:28:33] mountain on what he says you are the
[1:28:36] word of God said
[1:28:38] so well how do you know it's the word
[1:28:40] because it come from a Vindicated
[1:28:41] Prophet yeah praise God I know people
[1:28:44] don't like to think about this message
[1:28:46] being the absolute and that's fine
[1:28:49] moses' message wasn't the the the 10
[1:28:51] spies absolute either on come
[1:28:55] on hello that's right and look where
[1:28:58] they ended up at so if you don't want it
[1:29:00] for your absolute that's okay but a
[1:29:02] prophet God sent a prophet to Give Me
[1:29:05] Faith an absolute can you say Amen
[1:29:09] right yes sir yes sir so how did Jesus
[1:29:13] overcome the world well you know brother
[1:29:16] Bram said Jesus had faith in the word of
[1:29:19] God that said what he was yeah that's
[1:29:22] exactly right he had faith do you
[1:29:24] realize the prophets were his
[1:29:28] absolute amen the prophet's words was
[1:29:30] his
[1:29:31] absolute that's right that's why he said
[1:29:34] went destroy this this Temple and within
[1:29:36] three days I'll raise it up again
[1:29:38] Prophet said he had only one
[1:29:40] promise one scripture to base that
[1:29:42] statement upon that was in Psalms yes
[1:29:45] I'll not see my a holy one to see
[1:29:47] corruption or or uh suffer my Holy One
[1:29:49] to seek corruption or leave is SE in
[1:29:50] hell and Jesus knew that that uh uh
[1:29:54] corruption would he he would have to
[1:29:56] rise within that three days before
[1:29:58] corruption could set in amen that's
[1:30:01] right that became his
[1:30:05] absolute surely and he began to confess
[1:30:11] it amen yes sir that's right Prophet
[1:30:16] said he he he had faith in the word
[1:30:18] that's why it go it is written of me it
[1:30:20] is written of me it's written of me
[1:30:22] that's right amen he wasn't here to
[1:30:25] preach a new doctrine he was here to
[1:30:27] manifest what a prophet said about
[1:30:30] him sir and you say amen and Caleb knew
[1:30:34] the time had come for him to manifest
[1:30:36] exactly what the prophet said he would
[1:30:38] do
[1:30:40] yes praise the Lord hallelujah that's
[1:30:43] right so the prophet said he knew with
[1:30:45] that perfect Fai speaking of Jesus that
[1:30:48] he was the anointed Messiah he knew that
[1:30:50] he was the son of God without any Shadow
[1:30:52] of Doubt now you know they try to
[1:30:54] discourage him they try to tell him he
[1:30:56] wasn't they said you know he was
[1:30:58] illegitimate born he was this and he was
[1:31:00] that the church was against him politics
[1:31:02] was against him the world was against
[1:31:04] him even his own Mama denied it amen the
[1:31:07] testimony all of these things but Jesus
[1:31:10] beyond the shadow of a doubt knew he was
[1:31:13] the son of God what faith that's right
[1:31:18] see the word said he was so you've got
[1:31:21] to be Anointed with faith to believe you
[1:31:24] know that's why the prophet said you've
[1:31:26] got to be Anointed with faith to believe
[1:31:29] amen that's right and he said a Believer
[1:31:32] is the faith of God that moves in you
[1:31:36] everybody say it's the faith of
[1:31:38] God that moves in
[1:31:40] me we all know about what the faith of
[1:31:43] God does it created a
[1:31:45] world it spoke things into existence
[1:31:48] that were not and yet it it was as
[1:31:50] though it was he knew the end from the
[1:31:53] beginning and by faith he spoke you he
[1:31:56] called you chose you Justified you
[1:32:01] glorified you that's what the faith of
[1:32:03] God does God was so sure of his faith of
[1:32:07] his word he know you're going to make
[1:32:10] it come on now that's right now the
[1:32:14] prophet said see if the church can only
[1:32:17] get anointed Anointed with real Faith
[1:32:21] see speaking of Samson he said when that
[1:32:23] lion roared I guess Samson
[1:32:26] shook but the spirit of the Lord come
[1:32:28] upon him he was persistent and he looked
[1:32:32] at that line and said I'm ready to meet
[1:32:35] you come on now oh my are you are you
[1:32:38] ready to meet your
[1:32:40] enemy are you ready to meet him head on
[1:32:44] are we going to go in our closet and
[1:32:46] hide are we going to
[1:32:48] quit are we going to go out in the woods
[1:32:50] and be a
[1:32:52] Hermit no we're going to stand and face
[1:32:54] the
[1:32:56] enemy I'm ready to meet
[1:32:59] you he grabbed that line and pulled him
[1:33:01] apart and throw him over to one side and
[1:33:03] just kept walking on praise the Lord I
[1:33:06] think that's what we're doing in this
[1:33:07] hour we're just taking every demon
[1:33:09] ripping them apart and moving on why we
[1:33:11] are anointed to defeat this enemy hallu
[1:33:15] God is with
[1:33:19] us God is with
[1:33:21] us you see there is no way absolutely no
[1:33:25] way that you can overcome with
[1:33:29] unbelief you say oh God I want to
[1:33:31] overcome help me to overcome well I
[1:33:34] don't think I can do it you got
[1:33:35] unbelief amen get rid of that unbelief
[1:33:39] cuz you'll never go forward in God with
[1:33:41] unbelief too many Giants too many things
[1:33:45] too many
[1:33:47] obstacles you're going to go by your
[1:33:49] feelings you ain't going to overcome
[1:33:51] amen Faith Can't rest in feelings
[1:33:53] feelings come and go yeah they do
[1:33:55] Sensations come and go amen ain't that
[1:34:00] right come on now so there's absolutely
[1:34:02] no way to overcome with unbelief do you
[1:34:04] realize that unbelief gives power to the
[1:34:06] devil to do what he wants to do with you
[1:34:08] that's exactly right unbelief look look
[1:34:11] at the first look look look at what
[1:34:12] happened in the Garden of Eden Satan was
[1:34:14] powerless he was totally defeated he
[1:34:16] could not do nothing but when unbelief
[1:34:19] came in it gave open the door for Satan
[1:34:23] to come in and do what he's done in the
[1:34:25] world today yes sir can you say Amen but
[1:34:28] see God could not give a a a a bring a
[1:34:32] new Earth a new Heaven and a new Earth
[1:34:35] all of these things as long as unbelief
[1:34:37] is in the people's
[1:34:39] hearts
[1:34:41] hello that's right so he brings a
[1:34:44] message in this hour the prophet of
[1:34:47] Malachi 4 to turn our hearts
[1:34:51] back restore us back to a perfect
[1:34:55] [Music]
[1:34:56] Faith come on now
[1:35:00] hello so it gives the devil unbelief
[1:35:03] gives the power it it opens the gate to
[1:35:06] to demonic Powers yes it does unbelief
[1:35:09] produces doubts and fears it does
[1:35:11] brother BR said it'll produce sickness
[1:35:13] and disaster yes sir so you you cannot
[1:35:16] defeat the
[1:35:18] enemy when you're empowering the enemy
[1:35:22] that's right good well well said well
[1:35:24] said yeah yeah you say well I'm I'm
[1:35:26] going to defeat you Satan well the only
[1:35:28] weapon you've got is the word of
[1:35:31] God Amen and and and Satan's job is to
[1:35:36] get you to doubt your weapon yes sir yes
[1:35:40] sir that's exactly right ain't that
[1:35:42] right and when you throw down your
[1:35:44] weapon when you doubt your weapon when
[1:35:45] you doubt the word of God he's got you
[1:35:48] amen he does and you've empowered him
[1:35:51] over your life exactly amen true help us
[1:35:56] God so the prophet said see unbelief
[1:35:58] Robs a man of every blessing that God
[1:36:01] has promised him it sends the unbeliever
[1:36:04] to hell that's right it doesn't hinder
[1:36:08] God cuz God's going to fulfill his word
[1:36:10] amen sure ain't that right but it
[1:36:14] hinders the
[1:36:15] unbeliever it hinders the man that's got
[1:36:18] the
[1:36:19] unbelief yeah of course that's right see
[1:36:22] and so then then we find the Bible tells
[1:36:25] us that the unbeliever dies the
[1:36:28] unbeliever dies in the Old Testament as
[1:36:30] we all know the unbelievers they
[1:36:32] perished in the wilderness they had seen
[1:36:35] they had tested the the promises of God
[1:36:37] the realities of God they had seen the
[1:36:39] Supernatural and yet they disbelieved
[1:36:42] ain't that right they disbelieved and
[1:36:44] they
[1:36:46] perished you look at since the Garden of
[1:36:49] Eden amen uh uh uh creation
[1:36:54] man has been given the choice between
[1:36:57] life and death life and death that's
[1:37:00] that's the
[1:37:01] choices and so God gave Adam and Eve
[1:37:04] life and death he he placed in the
[1:37:07] garden uh uh in the midst of the garden
[1:37:09] a tree of knowledge which was the tree
[1:37:11] of death placed there tree of life he
[1:37:14] told him you can eat of any other trees
[1:37:16] but don't you touch this tree of
[1:37:18] knowledge it's a tree of death the day
[1:37:20] you eat thereof you die so they had the
[1:37:22] choice so basically their choice was is
[1:37:25] to live by the word of God and they
[1:37:27] lived stay with the word of God believe
[1:37:30] the word of God and they lived doubt the
[1:37:33] word of God and and we know what doubt
[1:37:35] done when Eve doubted the word of God
[1:37:37] she partook of the tree of knowledge and
[1:37:39] she
[1:37:41] died on yes sir death set in ain't that
[1:37:44] right so it's always been the the choice
[1:37:48] of life and death amen uh uh in Jeremiah
[1:37:52] 218 go says behold I set before you the
[1:37:55] way of life and the way of death so to
[1:37:58] believe the word of God is to live to
[1:38:00] doubt the word of God is to die amen God
[1:38:04] sent his word to the people so that they
[1:38:07] could live amen believe it and live that
[1:38:10] that's the that's the thing you got to
[1:38:11] do believe everybody say believe and
[1:38:14] live believe and live ain't that right
[1:38:19] yes sir see and so he sent his word how
[1:38:22] did he send his word by the
[1:38:26] prophets ain't that right the Lord and
[1:38:29] then so they sounded forth the word of
[1:38:31] God thus sayi the
[1:38:33] Lord thus sayi the Lord right and then
[1:38:36] God would allow Satan to come and utter
[1:38:39] his voice of knowledge yeah his
[1:38:42] scientific his wisdom his reasoning amen
[1:38:45] and then the people has always had a
[1:38:48] choice believe God or and live or accept
[1:38:52] what Satan is saying and die it's it's
[1:38:56] just that way ain't that right now we're
[1:38:58] not just talking about a natural death
[1:39:00] we're talking about a spiritual death
[1:39:03] yes sir amen so this is exactly what
[1:39:06] happened to every unbeliever at Kadesh
[1:39:08] barnea they judged the obstacles to be
[1:39:11] greater than God's promised word they
[1:39:14] judged the impossibilities to be greater
[1:39:17] than the evidence that God showed them
[1:39:21] of the land and because because they
[1:39:24] doubted God's word they died brother
[1:39:27] Braham said
[1:39:28] eternally eternally separated ain't that
[1:39:31] right so they died spiritually that's
[1:39:33] what death is the separation so Jude 11
[1:39:36] woe unto them for they have gone in the
[1:39:38] way of Cain and ran greedily after the
[1:39:41] heir of balam for reward and perished in
[1:39:44] the gainsaying of Kora amen uh Hebrews
[1:39:49] 3:16 for some when they had heard did
[1:39:52] provoke how be it not all that came out
[1:39:55] of Egypt by Moses see uh but with whom
[1:39:58] was he grieved 40 years was it not with
[1:40:01] them that had Sinn whose carc carcasses
[1:40:04] fell in the wilderness and to whom swear
[1:40:07] he that they should not enter into his
[1:40:09] rest but to them that believ not see so
[1:40:13] we see that they could not enter in
[1:40:15] because of unbelief now notice what the
[1:40:18] prophet said physical death amen is the
[1:40:21] uniting of mother Eve and Satan together
[1:40:25] by disbelieving God's
[1:40:28] word they United and brought in the
[1:40:32] product of death see death is a product
[1:40:36] of uniting Satan and Eve together Eve
[1:40:40] had the word Satan is against the word
[1:40:44] and look almost 99 and 99 H hundredths
[1:40:47] of it see Satan admitted was right so
[1:40:50] close the Bible said in the last day
[1:40:52] would deceive the very elective possible
[1:40:54] see how it comes in how it's always been
[1:40:56] how it's going out the same way United
[1:41:00] of unbelief in all the full word of God
[1:41:03] you got it that's what brought death is
[1:41:06] uniting unbelief with the word unbelief
[1:41:09] just a little bitty part of it little
[1:41:13] bitty teeny bit 100th of 1% but it must
[1:41:17] be
[1:41:19] 100% yes believe God's word yes sir
[1:41:23] believe God's
[1:41:25] word you love the Lord God believe
[1:41:30] him Hallelujah that's what we are we're
[1:41:36] Believers there's going to be a Rapture
[1:41:39] because there's Believers on the earth
[1:41:41] amen there's going to be a body change
[1:41:43] because there's Believers on the earth
[1:41:46] somebody that's going to take God at his
[1:41:47] word
[1:41:50] regardless yes sir if you you notice
[1:41:53] Jesus said man shall not live by bread
[1:41:55] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:41:58] out of the mouth of God ain't that right
[1:42:02] and Caleb lived by that word and it
[1:42:05] sustained him and he was able when every
[1:42:08] one of them died
[1:42:10] off he was there to go into that
[1:42:13] promised land and defeat the enemy just
[1:42:16] the way the word said he
[1:42:18] would and so are we hallelujah amen do
[1:42:23] you believe it we are defeating this
[1:42:27] enemy just the way the word said it it's
[1:42:32] written brother BR said you cannot fail
[1:42:34] it's written prise God it's written can
[1:42:38] you say amen amen and because he lived
[1:42:41] by that word that word sustained
[1:42:44] him notice he said I'm just as strong as
[1:42:48] as I was now I'm just as strong now as I
[1:42:51] was the years before back when Moses
[1:42:54] first gave me the
[1:42:56] word it sustained
[1:42:59] him his faith was still alive just like
[1:43:03] Abraham God gave him the word and 25
[1:43:07] years it took but the Bible says he got
[1:43:10] stronger in faith that word sustained
[1:43:13] him we're not we're not regressing this
[1:43:16] bride's not
[1:43:18] regressing true brother not the True
[1:43:21] Believer that's right amen
[1:43:23] the True Believer ain't defeated brother
[1:43:26] I know it's getting more evil out there
[1:43:29] but that don't mean that we're we're
[1:43:30] getting more weaker that's right it it
[1:43:33] doesn't mean that we're not going to
[1:43:35] overcome blessed be his it's already
[1:43:37] been written we'll
[1:43:40] overcome Hallelujah to God you believe
[1:43:43] it amen now
[1:43:46] notice brother Braham said God's
[1:43:48] daughter the church the bride is also a
[1:43:51] product of God and his word United
[1:43:54] that's what you're a product of God's
[1:43:57] God and His word uniting produce the
[1:44:00] bride praise the Lord the holy spirit
[1:44:03] uniting in a body of Flesh It produced
[1:44:06] the son of God a product of the
[1:44:08] righteousness of God and in the last
[1:44:10] days as we're told as it was in the days
[1:44:13] of Sodom the bride will be United by the
[1:44:15] word of God made manifest In the Flesh
[1:44:18] the Holy Spirit sealing them into God
[1:44:22] and Sealing unbelief out amen praise God
[1:44:27] unbelief is on the
[1:44:29] outside but down in that Soul it's
[1:44:32] already sealed
[1:44:34] up Satan cannot touch you glory to
[1:44:39] Goden
[1:44:41] Hallelujah so we're not a product of
[1:44:44] unbelief can you say Amen yes you know
[1:44:48] thinking of Satan's Eden you know
[1:44:51] Satan's Eden is not built upon
[1:44:54] Faith the prophet said this he says see
[1:44:57] by unbelief in all of God's
[1:45:01] word has brought the seed of unholiness
[1:45:04] in Satan's
[1:45:06] Eden that's exactly what unbelief
[1:45:09] does unbelief in God's word
[1:45:13] brings uh uh the seed of unholiness in
[1:45:16] Satan's
[1:45:18] zeden now if unbelief will do that think
[1:45:20] of what faith will do yeah it'll bring
[1:45:23] forth the manifestation of sons of God
[1:45:26] it'll bring forth a Victorious Church a
[1:45:28] Triumph Hallelujah he said now we are

[1:45:39] religion he started not upon I am Satan
[1:45:42] I'm the great Angel no not upon that but
[1:45:44] upon perverting God's word and that's
[1:45:46] how he's brought his kingdom in every
[1:45:49] age and now in this great deceitful age

[1:45:57] educated scientific Eden right
[1:45:59] scientific preachers scientific Church
[1:46:01] scientific theology everything is
[1:46:03] scientific everything is based on the
[1:46:05] basis of knowledge the whole church
[1:46:08] caral church is built upon knowledge it
[1:46:12] is not built upon
[1:46:15] faith and Satan is spraying his unbelief
[1:46:18] by H breing His science his knowledge
[1:46:21] until what it was at the beginning when
[1:46:23] God put Adam and Eve in the garden that
[1:46:25] beautiful paradise without death without
[1:46:27] sickness without sorrow and everything
