[35:09] and so just keep that in mind uh next
[35:13] next weekend a tent meeting and it's uh
[35:19] um

[35:23] totally forgot
[35:25] the place of it Rural Retreat
[35:29] off of exit 60.
[35:32] um
[35:33] 1204 Radio Drive and so the Rural
[35:37] Retreat off of exit 60. and so anyways

[37:25] Lord that you would come and feel his
[37:27] father
[37:29] Lord
[37:31] we know that it's a daily experience a
[37:34] daily walk with you
[37:36] and Lord we've lived yesterday how
[37:40] but now we're here father for another
[37:42] moving another in feeling of your spirit
[37:47] and father we pray Lord that you would
[37:50] come and you would feel welcome in this
[37:52] building father May our songs and praise
[37:58] be Lord pleasing in your side father and
[38:03] may you feel at home
[38:05] Lord that you could speak Eternal Words
[38:07] of Life to his father and changes father
[38:11] we know that we're being changed on a
[38:14] daily basis Lord and that's our desire
[38:16] is to be more like you
[38:19] I pray father that you would just
[38:21] forgive us of all of our sins our
[38:24] failure Lord
[38:26] may your blood your atonement be
[38:29] covering us tonight
[38:31] no God speak to your people it's our
[38:34] prayer in Jesus Christ's name and the
[38:37] church says
[38:39] amen amen
[38:41] Romans the 12th chapter the first verse
[38:45] starting here says I beseech you
[38:47] brethren
[38:48] by the mercies of God that you present
[38:50] your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[38:53] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[38:56] reasonable service
[38:58] and be not conformed to this world but
[39:00] be ye transformed by the renewing of
[39:02] your mind
[39:04] that you may prove what is that good and
[39:08] acceptable and perfect will of God Amen
[39:13] you can have your seats this evening
[39:16] so again to to use the title uh choosing
[39:21] the perfect will of God
[39:24] and
[39:25] um
[39:26] we know that the will of God is the word
[39:29] of God
[39:30] and so to walk in his will is to walk in
[39:35] his word to have an understanding of his
[39:38] will is to have an understanding
[39:42] it would be impossible to know the
[39:46] perfect will of God if we did not have
[39:49] the perfect interpretation of the word
[39:53] of God
[39:55] and
[39:56] the perfect word of God being restored
[40:00] to us
[40:02] makes known the perfect will of God to
[40:06] us so by God restoring the word
[40:10] so this brings the complete restoration
[40:13] of the bride of Christ
[40:15] amen the the perfect word being restored
[40:21] brings about the completion or the
[40:25] complete restoration of the bride of
[40:27] Christ
[40:28] and so this this message that the
[40:31] prophet of God brought to us is the
[40:33] perfect
[40:34] interpretation of the word
[40:37] you believe that it's the perfect
[40:38] interpretation of the word
[40:41] and so we we know that because it has
[40:45] been divinely Vindicated
[40:48] of God and and to us and so therefore we
[40:55] know we know that God has this Bible is
[40:59] not uh in mystery form anymore but we as
[41:04] the people of God has it has been
[41:08] revealed to us we know we have the
[41:11] perfect interpretation
[41:13] therefore we know what is the perfect
[41:16] will of God
[41:19] and so uh being uh free moral agents uh
[41:24] as we are we have the ability of course
[41:27] and the responsibility
[41:30] uh to to make our choice and God
[41:34] requires us to make our choice
[41:38] um
[41:39] um you know Joshua brought the people up
[41:41] to a time of decision and it was at the
[41:45] at at the crossroads and there uh Joshua
[41:50] 24 and 15 uh Joshua totem says if it
[41:55] seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord
[41:57] choose you this day whom you will serve
[42:00] whether the gods which your father
[42:02] served that were on the other side of
[42:04] the flood or the gods of the amorites
[42:06] and whose lands you dwell but as for me
[42:08] and my house we will serve the Lord
[42:12] amen and of course the following
[42:15] scriptures is where Israel told Joshua
[42:18] we're going to follow the lord as well
[42:20] but but it was a time of decision it was
[42:23] at a Crossroads where they had to make a
[42:26] choice and we all we all come to
[42:30] Crossroads in our life you young people
[42:33] are at at a a Crossroads and these
[42:36] Crossroads
[42:38] they are
[42:39] crucial uh it's it's it's it's a crucial
[42:43] time
[42:44] uh in our lives
[42:46] um Israel came to a Crossroads under
[42:50] Moses's message
[42:52] Ministry at Kadesh barnia before they
[42:55] could go into the promised land uh they
[42:58] God brought them to a Crossroads to
[43:01] where they had to make a decision
[43:05] the Rich Young Ruler when he came face
[43:09] to face with Jesus he came to across
[43:12] roads and he come to a place that he had
[43:16] to make a decision and we we know in in
[43:20] all these decisions
[43:22] determined in in these these here
[43:25] determined their Eternal destination
[43:29] in 1956 America came to a Crossroads and
[43:36] uh her decision is why she is in the
[43:39] condition she is today
[43:41] but but it's interesting thing that all
[43:45] three that I mentioned Israel uh the
[43:49] Rich Young Ruler America and and we
[43:52] could even save the world but uh they
[43:55] they uh they've they all come to the
[43:58] same Crossroads to where they were given
[44:02] the choice and they had to either accept
[44:05] or reject the word for their hour it
[44:09] wasn't just the cross you know just the
[44:11] decision of what candy bar I wanted but
[44:14] this decision would be the thing that
[44:17] would determine their future determine
[44:19] whether they would go on in further in
[44:22] God and uh God had blessed Israel God
[44:25] God no doubt blessed that Rich Young
[44:28] Ruler uh uh God had blessed America and
[44:33] and uh even even the Jews in Jesus day
[44:38] uh they they were God's people but they
[44:41] come to a Crossroads and and it was at
[44:45] that crossroads that they made the
[44:47] decision and it was a fatal decision for
[44:50] each one of those uh uh at these times
[44:53] ain't that right and so I believe that
[44:57] every one of us here uh uh have made our
[45:00] choice uh to follow the Vindicated word
[45:03] of our day we we've been given this
[45:07] choice just as it was with Israel
[45:09] America and and and the Rich Young Ruler
[45:12] and and the Jews and and every every in
[45:16] every uh age there's been a Crossroads
[45:19] for a nation there's been a Crossroads
[45:21] for a people individuals homes families
[45:24] whatever and uh uh so we we've we've
[45:28] we're here because as we made the choice
[45:31] to to follow the Lord but it's not just
[45:36] a choice that we made years ago that
[45:39] that keeps us today
[45:40] uh uh but we we are continually making a
[45:45] choice on the day on a daily basis uh do
[45:49] you believe that I made the choice many
[45:52] years ago to follow the message and a
[45:54] lot of folks didn't that I knew didn't
[45:56] come and and join with me they didn't
[45:58] understand why but I'm not here today
[46:01] because of that choice only uh uh that
[46:05] just got me started it was a founding uh
[46:08] it got me of you know started on the
[46:10] right track but I found through through
[46:13] the years that I have had to keep making
[46:15] that choice keep making that choice you
[46:19] see some people have made the choice to
[46:21] leave their denomination and and started
[46:24] attending a a message church but then
[46:28] they go off in false doctrines and start
[46:33] believing things in a message church
[46:35] that brother Branham never taught they
[46:38] come under legalism they come under
[46:39] bondage or they start bringing in all
[46:42] these kinds of worldly things that
[46:44] brother Branham did not teach and and
[46:47] did not allow and and all these things
[46:50] see so it tells us that even though they
[46:53] made the choice to leave their
[46:55] denomination and and to come in in in
[46:58] and come to a message Church uh yet they
[47:02] didn't remain steady in their choices
[47:05] that they made and and so this is why we
[47:08] see people falling away left and right
[47:10] hey they started out and and this is
[47:13] even what Paul told the Galatians I
[47:15] think he said you started out well what
[47:17] did hinder you you started out right but
[47:20] what did hinder you something caused
[47:22] them to start making wrong choices in
[47:25] their life and and so you you can say
[47:28] well I gave my heart to the Lord to
[47:29] years ago that's fine but you better not
[47:31] live lacks today amen because you're
[47:34] going to have to make choices all your
[47:36] life
[47:37] amen and so we we find uh then there are
[47:42] some who have made the choice to attend
[47:45] a message church and yet they have never
[47:48] fully accepted the message as being the
[47:51] pure word of God and and again others uh
[47:56] come out of the denominations and and so
[47:59] then they bring in that denominational
[48:01] uh teachings or the train of thought and
[48:04] their ideologies and trying to mix it
[48:06] with with the the message of the hour
[48:09] and you you can't do that this message
[48:12] is not for anyone but for the elect of
[48:15] God it's it's to make a bride and and
[48:18] that's it uh uh you know I've thought of
[48:21] that and and so uh others you know in
[48:24] the message they start living worldly
[48:26] start acting worldly start talking
[48:28] worldly and and uh thinking worldly it's
[48:31] it's it's got to a point almost to where
[48:34] you can't tell some people who attend a
[48:37] message church for those who attend a
[48:39] nominal church and and it's because of
[48:42] people's choices they get lacks well I
[48:45] go to miss church I'm going to heaven no
[48:46] you're not that has nothing to do with
[48:48] it you understand what I'm saying not
[48:50] everybody that goes to a message church
[48:52] is going in a rapture now I will tell
[48:54] you everybody that's going in a Rapture
[48:56] is in a message but in in the message
[48:58] but but but just because everybody going
[49:01] to a men's church don't mean you're
[49:02] going in a Rapture you have to make
[49:05] choices you have to make choices how
[49:07] you're going to run your family you're
[49:08] going to have to make choices and what
[49:10] church you go to and and you're going to
[49:12] have to make choices as you as an
[49:14] individual how you're going to live how
[49:15] you're going to conduct yourself and and
[49:18] and these choices are brought up to us
[49:20] God will bring them to you uh you don't
[49:23] have to worry about that God God will
[49:25] make sure that someone challenges your
[49:28] faith someone asks you questions someone
[49:30] tempted tempts you uh you you've got
[49:33] plenty of things to make choices about
[49:35] but but you you you you you you but but
[49:39] the thought is tonight is choosing the
[49:42] perfect will of God Amen and so uh now I
[49:47] believe that that the cream of the crop
[49:49] is message Believers but again not all
[49:52] who go to a message church are believers
[49:55] now to to maybe go on in in in another
[49:59] Direction
[50:00] brother Branham said you were made for
[50:03] an eternal purpose now keep that in mind
[50:06] as we're thinking of the the perfect
[50:08] will of God but he said you were made
[50:11] for an eternal purpose because you
[50:13] everybody say me see brother Bram knows
[50:16] how to make these things personal but he
[50:18] said you were made for an eternal
[50:20] purpose because you was the
[50:21] manifestation of an attribute that was
[50:24] in God that thought of you and expressed
[50:28] you and he made an earth to take you out
[50:32] of and to make you a human being now
[50:35] then sin come along and perverted his
[50:38] way you come anyhow amen but you was
[50:41] lost with the world so he came and he
[50:46] redeemed you the expressed attribute and
[50:50] also redeems this Earth by the same way
[50:53] ain't that right so another place he
[50:55] said if you've got eternal life there's
[50:58] only one form and that's God and you are
[51:02] an expressed attribute if you're not
[51:05] you're not going to be there anyhow so
[51:09] see no man can come to me except my
[51:12] father has drawn him ain't that right
[51:14] see so he says now the old things all
[51:18] the old things pass away can you say
[51:20] that with me all the old things pass
[51:23] away but these things the Eternal things
[51:27] don't see so it speaks of Eternity see
[51:32] the Holy Ghost is eternal then you are
[51:36] in eternity because you've got the Holy
[51:38] Ghost ain't that right if you've got the
[51:40] Holy Ghost and there is some Eternal
[51:43] part about you that is a part of God and
[51:47] these things don't pass away it won't
[51:50] pass away ain't that right so then you
[51:53] are in eternity where you was all the
[51:56] time but you've just recognized what
[51:59] happened now another place he said
[52:02] you're a time being until you're born
[52:05] again then you're an eternal being and
[52:09] the only way you can get it is to have a
[52:12] part of God in you being eternal life
[52:16] ain't that right so now I pray that God
[52:19] will just make it all clear to us but
[52:22] but there is an eternal part in of about
[52:26] the believer it's not all corrupt it's
[52:30] not all uh uh temporal it's not all
[52:33] whatever there is it is an eternal part
[52:36] and that part is with God it's an
[52:40] attribute of God it's it's something
[52:42] there ain't that right if you didn't
[52:45] have that Eternal attribute there would
[52:47] be nothing in you to call for something
[52:49] something Beyond this life people all
[52:52] the time thinking this is life but
[52:54] something about you don't think that
[52:56] this is life but you've never been
[52:59] anywhere other than this Earth you've
[53:01] never known any other life but this
[53:03] you've never known nothing but death and
[53:06] Corruption and pain and Agony but there
[53:09] is something about you that groans for
[53:12] something else and it bears with you
[53:15] that there is a place that will not die
[53:18] there is a place oh yeah you read it but
[53:20] how many times have we read things and
[53:22] it never strikes home but when you read
[53:25] the promises and you hear about the
[53:27] promises you read the Bible and you you
[53:29] read about what this says about a future
[53:31] home and and a a future civilization
[53:36] where there's no death there's no sin
[53:38] there's there's something that catches
[53:41] you and you start yearning for it it's
[53:44] something that is eternal that's that
[53:46] Eternal being that is inside of you
[53:49] ain't that right amen now we must choose
[53:53] in this life we're here it's it's it's
[53:56] the testing grounds as I think we read
[53:58] about uh talked about Sunday it's the
[54:02] testing ground this Earth is the testing
[54:04] ground and we must choose between the
[54:07] perfect will or our own will and and
[54:10] again this is where the real struggle
[54:13] comes because our carnal sticky nature
[54:16] is is always always wanting to us to do
[54:21] one thing and and and that is totally
[54:25] against God it now people can be
[54:28] religious now think of that people can
[54:29] be religious churchgoers tithe payers
[54:32] offering they they can give and give all
[54:35] they got to the poor they can extend
[54:38] themselves and and and and and and and
[54:40] go to hospitals and go visit the sick
[54:43] and go visit this and go visit that all
[54:46] in the name of religion and still not be
[54:48] right with God and and that's that's
[54:51] incredible that that can actually be but
[54:55] but but still it it it's the carnal
[54:58] nature that is dominating that life amen
[55:02] and and you know people can get prideful
[55:04] just just giving money to to the poor
[55:07] people people can say well look what
[55:09] I've done you know and and it becomes a
[55:11] a a uh uh to where everybody oohs and
[55:14] alls them you know oh my look what they
[55:16] do they're so important and and it
[55:19] really becomes something in our heart at
[55:21] people's hearts that they think I'm
[55:22] really important boy if I ever left boy
[55:24] this church fall apart if I ever done
[55:26] this if I ever done that these guys need
[55:28] me you know well what what is it it's
[55:31] it's it's it's it's all done controlled
[55:34] by
[55:35] Eternal sticky nature it's just that way
[55:37] but then there that and and we struggle
[55:41] uh uh so so that that carnal nature is
[55:43] just a fleshly nature it's worldly it's
[55:46] it's it and and so what I'm getting at
[55:48] it can even be religious and still not
[55:50] right with God but then there's that
[55:53] predestinated seed that is inside of us
[55:55] if there is one and it's wanting us to
[55:59] choose contrary to that of the carnal
[56:01] nature ain't that right and what it does
[56:05] it seeks the perfect will of God Jesus
[56:09] had power upon power he he he could have
[56:12] raised the dead but he didn't raise
[56:13] every dead he he he healed the sick but
[56:16] he didn't raise everybody uh or he
[56:18] didn't heal all the sick right amen he
[56:21] he could have opened the blind eyes but
[56:23] he didn't open every Blind Eye amen we
[56:26] find a healing the leopard but he didn't
[56:28] heal every leper amen why because he
[56:31] done it was more important for him to do
[56:34] the a perfect will of God than it was to
[56:38] show his off his ministry can you say
[56:40] amen amen see he was there to get the
[56:44] seed of God he was there to get the
[56:47] elect of God ain't that right amen see
[56:50] and so uh uh there is a warning that
[56:53] goes on inside of us as Believers and
[56:57] and again talking about the two dogs
[56:59] black dog and white dog and and then
[57:02] brother Brown said see it depends on
[57:04] which one you cater to which nature you
[57:08] cater to the carnal nature after the
[57:10] things of the world or the spiritual
[57:12] nature after the things of God ain't
[57:15] that right see it's uh remember because
[57:17] he asked the chief it was asked which
[57:19] one wins he said well it all depends
[57:21] which I which one I feed the most so
[57:24] you'll you'll either cater to the flesh
[57:26] or you're going to cater to the
[57:27] spiritual side you get the Holy Ghost
[57:29] that does not mean that it's going to be
[57:31] easy for you it just it isn't going now
[57:34] yeah Jesus said I give unto you power
[57:36] that's right that's why every individual
[57:39] that's really got the Holy Ghost is
[57:40] going to overcome you will not be able
[57:43] we will not be able to come to God and
[57:45] say God I know you gave me the Holy
[57:47] Ghost but I just couldn't overcome
[57:48] that's a lie it just ain't gonna happen
[57:51] can you say Amen so so you you got to
[57:55] make the choice either to follow after
[57:57] the world or follow after God you've got
[58:00] the choice to be a layout of sin church
[58:02] member just like everybody else rich and
[58:05] and saying that I'm rich and I have need
[58:08] of nothing and all that in other words
[58:10] we don't need prayer we don't need God
[58:12] we just we're just happy the way we are
[58:14] we just go to church and and hopefully
[58:16] the preacher don't take long because I
[58:18] got to go and do other things and and
[58:20] all of that and and and so therefore we
[58:22] lay the things of God the important
[58:24] things of God aside but hey we go to
[58:26] church hello we quote message we believe
[58:30] message you understand what I'm saying
[58:31] but live in a a a totally carnal life
[58:35] amen then that shows that that you're
[58:38] feeding off the wrong things you'll
[58:40] either be a strong Christian believer
[58:43] overcome the devil or you'll be a strong
[58:45] carnal church member who is constantly
[58:48] defeated by the devil
[58:50] it all depends which one you cater to
[58:54] ain't that right but but there is no way
[58:57] there is no way that you can set under a
[59:00] message of the hour and live true blue
[59:03] to the message and then live a defeated
[59:05] life it just ain't gonna work amen but
[59:08] see you're blessed amen because you
[59:11] could be sitting in a denomination
[59:12] somewhere with nothing eating out of the
[59:16] garbage can skin and bone spiritually
[59:20] all dried up
[59:22] with no power at all and then you're
[59:26] going with the the ways of the world and
[59:28] with the current down into the council
[59:30] the World Council of churches and that's
[59:33] where everybody's headed you understand
[59:35] that but you're blessed because you have
[59:38] a message
[59:39] you you have something that can you can
[59:41] feed off to get stronger in that
[59:45] spiritual man developing strength and
[59:47] overcoming to where you can be that one
[59:49] that brother Brown says the devil don't
[59:51] know what to do about with
[59:53] amen yes if you cater to the things of
[59:57] the world don't expect to be a strong
[59:59] Christian
[1:00:01] if you cater to the things of God then
[1:00:04] you'll not be a strong carnal church
[1:00:06] member
[1:00:07] it's just what all you cater to
[1:00:10] amen ain't that right now our choice
[1:00:13] our choice is is crucial because it
[1:00:16] determines our outcome and destination
[1:00:20] and and and again and and I you know uh
[1:00:24] and I really want to uh I pray the Lord
[1:00:27] help me make this clear
[1:00:29] because we get this idea that well I got
[1:00:33] the Holy Ghost so well and the Holy
[1:00:34] Ghost is rest don't get me wrong the
[1:00:36] Holy Ghost is rest
[1:00:38] you believe that
[1:00:41] the question is is is
[1:00:43] and and I I'm not here to preach any
[1:00:46] doubt at all but I want maybe we all
[1:00:50] check our lives and the question is is
[1:00:52] the Holy Ghost really there
[1:00:54] and and and again because here's the
[1:00:57] thing that Jesus said he that endureth
[1:00:59] to the end the same shall be saved
[1:01:02] not he that starts out shall be saved he
[1:01:05] that endures to the end so there's some
[1:01:07] enduring
[1:01:08] there's some resistance that we're going
[1:01:11] to meet there there are some things
[1:01:12] discouragement there's things that we're
[1:01:14] going to go through but he that endures
[1:01:16] to the end he that cometh out and the
[1:01:19] the you you come out by the choices
[1:01:22] you've made
[1:01:23] David
[1:01:27] now
[1:01:28] to me this shows as to whether or not a
[1:01:31] man really has the Holy Ghost
[1:01:33] and and the re I'm going to say it read
[1:01:35] some quotes here brother Brown said
[1:01:37] there's nothing that you can say is the
[1:01:38] evidence of the Holy Ghost unless your
[1:01:40] life unless it's the life you live
[1:01:43] the evidence of having the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:45] he who can believe the word you can
[1:01:47] receive it
[1:01:49] ain't that right now now
[1:01:52] when we're saying this it's it's it's
[1:01:54] one thing to say well I received the
[1:01:57] Holy I received the word I received the
[1:01:59] word and and and and and and and and and
[1:02:02] and and that's usually when things are
[1:02:04] going good and and in in meetings and
[1:02:08] rejoicing and even you young people you
[1:02:10] go to these youth meetings and the power
[1:02:12] of God's moving and and and it's in a
[1:02:15] place you forget about your trials
[1:02:17] you're just in you're just in a uh uh
[1:02:20] Utopia or whatever that word would be
[1:02:22] and and you just wow you're there man
[1:02:25] and the word oh it's easy to receive the
[1:02:28] word then
[1:02:29] but but it's in the trials do we still
[1:02:32] receive that word it's in the ups and
[1:02:35] downs do we still receive that word lo I
[1:02:37] am with you uh I'll never leave you nor
[1:02:40] forsake you in them times of loneliness
[1:02:42] can we still receive that word and say
[1:02:45] God your word said so when when when
[1:02:47] when when in the times when we're we we
[1:02:49] ain't got nothing and the money ain't
[1:02:51] there and and these things ain't there
[1:02:53] and yet we we know what the Bible says
[1:02:56] that I am the god that supplies all your
[1:02:59] needs and uh uh uh uh according to the
[1:03:02] riches and glory and and all that can we
[1:03:04] still receive that word or are we going
[1:03:07] to find ourselves our hearts getting
[1:03:08] hardened toward God and blaming God and
[1:03:11] this and that and you understand what
[1:03:13] I'm saying so so the evidence of the
[1:03:16] Holy Ghost in another place is when you
[1:03:18] can receive the word not some system but
[1:03:20] have a clear understanding how do you
[1:03:23] know the word is clear and understand it
[1:03:25] watch it vindicate itself watch it
[1:03:29] vindicate itself I hope I'm making sense
[1:03:32] tonight what someone asked brother
[1:03:35] Brandon what is the evidence that a
[1:03:36] person is really filled with the Holy
[1:03:37] Ghost well John 14 26 when the Holy
[1:03:40] Ghost has come he will show you things
[1:03:42] to come he'll perfect it man-maids won't
[1:03:45] do it he is the word ain't that right he
[1:03:48] is the word and when he the Holy Ghost
[1:03:50] has come he will identify himself in you
[1:03:53] with thee scripture ain't that right
[1:03:56] with the scripture amen and that is the
[1:03:59] true sign that the holy spirit is in you
[1:04:01] because it is the word he says now look
[1:04:04] what if you spoke with tongues I just
[1:04:06] want to ask you that when Jesus said
[1:04:07] when the Holy Ghost come what would he
[1:04:09] do see uh uh what he would do well what
[1:04:13] if you spoke with tongues jumped up and
[1:04:14] down shouted and everything else and
[1:04:16] then come to the word and I tell you the
[1:04:19] baptism and prove to you by the
[1:04:21] scriptures I have that the baptism used
[1:04:23] entitled a father Son and Holy Ghost is
[1:04:25] absolutely a misunderstanding in the
[1:04:27] scripture nobody was ever baptized like
[1:04:29] that and you go ahead and hang with that
[1:04:31] anyhow he says then you could you tell
[1:04:34] me the holy spirit in you would do a
[1:04:37] thing like that how can it deny its own
[1:04:39] word can you say man so see that this is
[1:04:42] where we got people shouting and people
[1:04:45] and I'm just talking about the world in
[1:04:47] general not just in the message uh uh uh
[1:04:50] claiming Christianity and and all these
[1:04:53] things but then when it comes to face
[1:04:55] and facts and truth of this Bible and
[1:04:59] people walk away from it then it shows
[1:05:02] right there the Holy Ghost ain't there
[1:05:04] can you say man now we're talking about
[1:05:07] choosing the perfect will of God can you
[1:05:09] say man when the will of God which is
[1:05:12] the word of God is made clear and
[1:05:14] Vindicated and they still reject Jesus
[1:05:17] name baptism then then the Holy Ghost
[1:05:20] ain't there when you tell them about a
[1:05:22] woman not cutting their hair and they
[1:05:24] can't cut their hair it's wrong and they
[1:05:26] still take it from being a hat or some
[1:05:28] other covering or whatever or they just
[1:05:30] I remember my dad talk talking to some
[1:05:33] lady uh uh years ago and and he took me
[1:05:36] with him and and we're sitting there and
[1:05:38] she she uh it was all mad because he had
[1:05:40] talked about uh women cutting hair and
[1:05:43] so he went there and says uh sister let
[1:05:45] me try to explain to you and she he says
[1:05:47] this right in the Bible and she just
[1:05:48] shook her head enough she said I don't
[1:05:50] care what you say I don't care what you
[1:05:52] show me I'll never believe it and and
[1:05:54] that really stuck home to me right there
[1:05:57] and I thought God never let me be like
[1:05:58] that if it's in the word I want to
[1:06:00] believe it see you you can't choose the
[1:06:03] perfect will and reject the word word of
[1:06:05] God can you say man and and so then if a
[1:06:09] man truly has the Holy Ghost he humbles
[1:06:11] himself to this word he he chooses this
[1:06:15] word do you understand over his own
[1:06:17] feelings over his own emotions you say
[1:06:19] well I've never been taught that before
[1:06:20] but it's shown in the word then you've
[1:06:22] got to accept the word over what you've
[1:06:24] been taught or or over whatever you saw
[1:06:27] it you understand what I'm saying see so
[1:06:30] uh he he said see uh uh he says how can
[1:06:34] it deny its own word when I show you
[1:06:37] what's supposed to take place in this
[1:06:39] day how that the son of man is to reveal
[1:06:41] himself and what he's to do and all
[1:06:44] these scriptures that's been now and
[1:06:46] then see him come right down and
[1:06:48] identify it and you hang right on to a
[1:06:51] denomination and say that you're born
[1:06:52] again how could you make sense out of
[1:06:55] that now can you say man everybody want
[1:06:58] to say oh we got the Holy Ghost Holy
[1:06:59] Ghost Holy Ghost you know you can tell a
[1:07:01] person if they really got the Holy Ghost
[1:07:05] brother Brown said you could
[1:07:07] so so all this make belief if I've got
[1:07:10] Holy Ghost Holy Ghost Holy Ghost if if
[1:07:12] they're not if they're not living the
[1:07:14] word of God and they're rejecting the
[1:07:15] word of God then don't follow that
[1:07:19] can you say Amen now the perfect will of
[1:07:23] God is what we want to choose and I
[1:07:26] believe that God is bringing all things
[1:07:29] everybody say all things back to his
[1:07:31] perfect will
[1:07:33] all this world and and the the the the
[1:07:36] systems and all that has been been by
[1:07:40] his permissive will but God is going to
[1:07:43] bring everything and he is bringing
[1:07:45] everything back to his perfect will and
[1:07:48] this is this is explains why things are
[1:07:51] changing so rapidly in the world today
[1:07:54] and this change is not a reform that is
[1:07:59] taking place amen but it's about all
[1:08:02] things becoming new ain't that right and
[1:08:05] in order for all things to become new
[1:08:07] there has to be annihilation of that
[1:08:10] which is stopping the thing to becoming
[1:08:13] anew the the the the old traditions have
[1:08:16] got to be annihilated for that to become
[1:08:18] new can you say Amen so so it's all
[1:08:21] about all all things becoming new now
[1:08:24] now look a new Heaven and a new Earth a
[1:08:28] new civilization a new kingdom a new
[1:08:30] city a new people
[1:08:34] think of that a new people see Isaiah 43
[1:08:39] 18 remember ye not the formal things
[1:08:42] neither consider the things of old
[1:08:44] behold I will do a new thing ain't that
[1:08:49] right Revelations 21 and 2 and I John
[1:08:52] saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming
[1:08:55] down from God out of Heaven prepared as
[1:08:58] a bride adorned for her husband and I
[1:09:00] heard a great voice out of Heaven saying
[1:09:02] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[1:09:05] and he will dwell with him and they
[1:09:06] shall be his people none others than his
[1:09:09] people and God himself shall be with him
[1:09:12] and be their God and God shall wipe away
[1:09:15] all tears from their eyes and there
[1:09:17] shall be no more deaths neither siren
[1:09:19] nor crying neither shall there be any
[1:09:21] more pain for the former things are
[1:09:24] passed away and there is a people today
[1:09:27] on this earth that is groaning and
[1:09:30] crying for this to happen to I will be
[1:09:35] done
[1:09:36] then you say Amen his perfect will it's
[1:09:40] a miracle that that someone can pray for
[1:09:43] the perfect will to be done and choose
[1:09:46] it because again the perfect will of God
[1:09:49] isn't not is not in favor of the carnal
[1:09:52] man
[1:09:53] it's not in favor of the fleshly
[1:09:57] adamic nature the perfect will of God is
[1:10:01] not in favor that it actually goes
[1:10:03] against it
[1:10:04] and and everything about man has to die
[1:10:08] has to be changed in order for the
[1:10:11] perfect will of God to to be
[1:10:14] accomplished
[1:10:15] ain't that right see so so uh uh this is
[1:10:20] why it's a miracle that you you cry for
[1:10:23] the will of God in this age because
[1:10:25] according to Second Timothy 3 2 and 4
[1:10:28] men are lovers of their own selves and
[1:10:31] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:10:33] God and that fits for this day it was a
[1:10:36] prophecy uh uh concerning this age that
[1:10:39] we're living in
[1:10:41] no wonder people ain't crying for God
[1:10:43] anymore no wonder people are just
[1:10:45] satisfied with religion and now they
[1:10:47] make the choices where they want to go
[1:10:49] to church or not
[1:10:51] it there's nothing that is compelling
[1:10:54] them to do these things
[1:10:56] it's just a convenience it's just a
[1:10:59] matter whether it's convenient for them
[1:11:01] it's because there are more lovers of
[1:11:03] pleasure than lovers of God
[1:11:05] and you say man this is why the churches
[1:11:08] are appealing to the Natural flesh and
[1:11:10] they are the spiritual man
[1:11:12] but the message does not appeal to the
[1:11:14] carnal flesh it doesn't have its
[1:11:18] programs it doesn't have the
[1:11:19] professional music it doesn't have the
[1:11:21] professional choirs and all these things
[1:11:23] it doesn't have the professional uh
[1:11:25] preachers and and and and and and it
[1:11:28] doesn't have the personality for us to
[1:11:30] draw to
[1:11:32] but this is appealing to that spiritual
[1:11:35] man
[1:11:36] because it's dealing with the perfect
[1:11:38] will of God
[1:11:40] and you say man so who are the ones
[1:11:43] crying against the sin that is being
[1:11:45] done
[1:11:47] who are the ones that are agonizing in
[1:11:49] their soul because of the filth and the
[1:11:51] evil
[1:11:52] people are becoming more adapted and
[1:11:54] I've been saying it for a while say it
[1:11:56] again
[1:11:57] but they're becoming more adapted and
[1:11:59] used and and and and and at home with
[1:12:03] these movies
[1:12:05] and and it's got to the place that we've
[1:12:08] excused it well it's not television
[1:12:10] anymore we got computers same thing
[1:12:13] it's a movie
[1:12:15] it's Hollywood
[1:12:17] it's it's it's things that is wrong
[1:12:21] can you say Amen
[1:12:23] we got most of the people today they're
[1:12:26] caught up in all the glamor and the
[1:12:28] worldly fashions
[1:12:30] and and the people are crying out for
[1:12:33] peace peace
[1:12:34] is that not what the Bible said they
[1:12:36] would do peace peace but see the only
[1:12:40] thing that brings peace is the perfect
[1:12:41] will of God
[1:12:43] there's nothing in this world that
[1:12:45] brings the peace that the soul is crying
[1:12:48] for
[1:12:51] people are looking to the Nations
[1:12:52] they're looking to the churches they're
[1:12:54] looking to science and education and and
[1:12:56] yet all of them are all the
[1:12:59] denominations all these things are being
[1:13:01] controlled by Satan
[1:13:03] and and and there will be no peace
[1:13:06] not not not until the perfect will of
[1:13:09] God is completed is accomplished can you
[1:13:12] say man
[1:13:13] so so then uh these things that are
[1:13:15] controlled by Satan it means that
[1:13:18] they're not part of the perfect will and
[1:13:20] they of God and they work against the
[1:13:22] perfect will of God
[1:13:24] how many people are God now now Church
[1:13:29] we're blessed to unders have the
[1:13:31] understanding of what this message is
[1:13:33] all about
[1:13:34] you realize this is the kingdom of God
[1:13:39] that we are to receive
[1:13:42] this is the kingdom of God it's more
[1:13:44] Superior than American Kingdom
[1:13:47] than the kingdoms of all this world and
[1:13:49] yet most churches are so wrapped up in
[1:13:52] politics trying to preserve the kingdom
[1:13:55] of America
[1:13:59] prophecy after prophecy after prophecy
[1:14:01] God's going to bless God's going to move
[1:14:03] God's for this America this this nation
[1:14:05] God's this God and it all backwards you
[1:14:07] know what the prophet it reminds us what
[1:14:09] the prophet brought us to in this
[1:14:10] scripture Ahab and the 400 prophets and
[1:14:13] McCain and all of these things but
[1:14:17] somewhere we have this understanding
[1:14:19] that that's not the perfect will of God
[1:14:22] America was fine and God blessed her and
[1:14:25] and she's done many things but that
[1:14:27] wasn't the perfect will of God
[1:14:29] the perfect will of God is coming now
[1:14:32] that his kingdom come and a people on
[1:14:35] this Earth receives it
[1:14:40] so all of these things will come to not
[1:14:43] when the perfect will of God is
[1:14:45] fulfilled
[1:14:46] and there is something
[1:14:49] again within the believer that is
[1:14:51] causing him to groan within himself for
[1:14:54] the will of God to be accomplished now
[1:14:57] we know this scripture but Hebrews 12
[1:14:59] and 25 it says see that ye refuse him
[1:15:02] not not him that speaketh for if they
[1:15:05] escape not who refused him that spake on
[1:15:09] Earth how much more shall we not Escape
[1:15:11] if we turn away from him that's speaking
[1:15:13] from Heaven whose voice then shook the
[1:15:16] earth now we know this is this is the
[1:15:18] message this is what Paul it's tied to
[1:15:21] the message of the hour
[1:15:23] but he says see whose voice then shook
[1:15:26] the Earth but now he has promised saying
[1:15:28] yet once more I shake knock the Earth
[1:15:30] only but also heaven and this word yet
[1:15:34] once more signifieth the removing of
[1:15:37] those things that are shaken as of
[1:15:39] things that are made that those things
[1:15:41] which cannot be shaken May remain
[1:15:43] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[1:15:46] cannot be moved let us have Grace
[1:15:49] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[1:15:52] reverence and godly fear and I say to
[1:15:55] you this prophecy is being fulfilled
[1:15:57] today we are in a shaking of the heavens
[1:16:00] and the earth and the the spiritual
[1:16:02] things and as well as the Earthly things
[1:16:05] and everything is being brought down uh
[1:16:07] uh and and and and and and and and is
[1:16:10] being shaken that that which can be
[1:16:12] shaken will be removed and that which
[1:16:15] remaineth shall remain can you say Amen
[1:16:18] see so so everything that God has
[1:16:21] permitted a man has come to its and
[1:16:24] we're at the end of this this
[1:16:25] civilization we're at the End of Time
[1:16:28] amen we're at the end of of of politics
[1:16:32] we're at the end we are at a place where
[1:16:35] God calls it the ends of the Earth we're
[1:16:39] there because God's perfect will must be
[1:16:43] accomplished it must come it must come
[1:16:47] now when Satan has perverted or what he
[1:16:50] has perverted is being transformed back
[1:16:53] to the perfect will of God
[1:16:55] amen now it's it's coming back and the
[1:16:59] perfect will of God being accomplished
[1:17:02] shows that there is a people who have
[1:17:05] come into obedience to the word of God
[1:17:08] Amen now you think of this now amen that
[1:17:12] the perfect will of God being
[1:17:13] accomplished shows that there is a
[1:17:16] people on this Earth today that has come
[1:17:19] into full obedience to the word of God
[1:17:23] you see what caused all this corruption
[1:17:26] in the first place disobedience
[1:17:29] amen and and that because of unbelief
[1:17:32] Disobedience because of unbelief ain't
[1:17:34] that right God gave his word so what was
[1:17:37] the Disobedience to the word of God what
[1:17:40] was the unbelief to the word of God Amen
[1:17:43] see God gave his word and when man was
[1:17:46] tested on it he failed upon that word
[1:17:50] and disobeyed the word and noticed What
[1:17:52] followed amen uh Paul would tell us
[1:17:55] because of one man's disobedient a man
[1:17:58] death follows amen we go in on more into
[1:18:01] that corruption follows filth and sin
[1:18:03] sorrow pain came into this world because
[1:18:06] of one man's Disobedience ain't that
[1:18:08] right but because of one man Jesus
[1:18:11] Christ his obedience Amen to the word of
[1:18:15] God many are made righteous you can read
[1:18:19] that in Romans 5 19. amen see but now
[1:18:22] looking at today I believe that that
[1:18:25] righteous people that was made righteous
[1:18:28] by that one man's obedience this
[1:18:31] righteous people is living on Earth
[1:18:33] today who has come into full obedience
[1:18:36] themselves to the word of God and that's
[1:18:39] the reason why all things are becoming
[1:18:42] new
[1:18:43] can you say amen amen a prepared place
[1:18:46] for a prepared people all things are
[1:18:49] becoming new amen because a people have
[1:18:52] come back to a full obedience to the
[1:18:55] word of God Amen a people have been
[1:18:59] restored you believe that the people
[1:19:02] have been restored we're part of that
[1:19:04] people I believe amen and and they make
[1:19:07] up the bride of Christ now I'm not going
[1:19:10] to take too much longer but I am going
[1:19:12] to read you some quotes here and uh but
[1:19:15] brother Brown said the real bride of
[1:19:17] Christ takes the headship of Christ the
[1:19:19] word
[1:19:20] and only believes God's word and you say
[1:19:23] man now that ain't easy amen they're
[1:19:26] going to go through hell they're going
[1:19:27] to go through trials they're going to go
[1:19:29] through storms of life they're going to
[1:19:31] go through testings and temptations and
[1:19:34] being Forsaken and and all of these
[1:19:36] things but that shows they to be the
[1:19:39] real bride of Christ because they take
[1:19:41] the handship of Christ which is the word
[1:19:43] can you say Amen in other words through
[1:19:46] it all they choose the perfect will of
[1:19:48] God for their lives
[1:19:51] perfect will
[1:19:53] he said that's the real restored bride
[1:19:55] it's nearly time friends it's later than
[1:19:58] you think we're at the evening time the
[1:20:01] holy spirit is here tonight and I know
[1:20:03] he says I know it's a little bitty group
[1:20:06] but we're part of that group I believe
[1:20:09] now Colossians 1 18 Paul says he is the
[1:20:12] head of the body the church who is the
[1:20:15] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[1:20:16] that in all things or by saying all
[1:20:18] things he might have the preeminence now
[1:20:21] it's it's brother Branham takes that
[1:20:24] scripture there in in Christ as the
[1:20:26] mystery of God revealed and and he he
[1:20:30] really lays heavy in this uh that and
[1:20:33] and any he makes this scripture
[1:20:36] applicable to this day that finally out
[1:20:39] of the ages God is now able to take a
[1:20:42] group of people and have complete
[1:20:44] preeminence over them
[1:20:48] preeminence over their flesh over their
[1:20:52] Spirit over their mind
[1:20:55] can you say over the wheel
[1:20:57] over their Sensations over their
[1:21:00] feelings
[1:21:01] he has complete preeminence in them
[1:21:05] and they come in full obedience now the
[1:21:09] Vindicated word is our headship
[1:21:13] do you believe that
[1:21:15] so now following this message doesn't
[1:21:17] mean just attending a message Church
[1:21:20] following of the message does not mean
[1:21:23] just mean that we believe brother
[1:21:24] Branham to be the prophet of Malachi 4.
[1:21:27] but following the message means that we
[1:21:30] have accepted it as the supreme
[1:21:33] authority for our lives it's the supreme
[1:21:37] authority for our church it's the
[1:21:39] supreme authority for our family it's
[1:21:41] supreme authority for our marriage it's
[1:21:43] supreme authority in what we're choosing
[1:21:46] for our spouse it's the supreme
[1:21:48] authority that tells us everything it's
[1:21:52] the supreme authority over our lives
[1:21:55] [Applause]
[1:21:57] in Matthew 4 4 Jesus said it is written
[1:22:01] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:22:03] every word that proceedeth thou the
[1:22:04] mouth of God
[1:22:05] ain't that right
[1:22:07] so as God gave Adam and Eve his word to
[1:22:09] live by so has he given us today his
[1:22:12] word to live by
[1:22:14] and again the Bride of Adam fell when
[1:22:17] she was tested by the word
[1:22:19] she received a different word which
[1:22:22] calls her to receive a seed that was
[1:22:24] different from the spoken word and as
[1:22:27] brother Branham said it was the seed of
[1:22:29] death ain't that right but notice what
[1:22:31] the prophet said the bride of Christ
[1:22:33] will not fall
[1:22:36] ain't that right she will not fall he
[1:22:39] fell when she was tested by the word she
[1:22:42] fell but this bride has been tested and
[1:22:45] you're going to continue to be tested by
[1:22:47] this word but it's already been written
[1:22:50] you will not fail
[1:22:52] brother Brown said she is ordained not
[1:22:55] to fall she won't fail she is
[1:22:58] predestinated to it
[1:23:00] ain't that right so we're not under just
[1:23:03] any headship of man but under the
[1:23:06] headship of God and the headship of God
[1:23:09] is not a denomination
[1:23:11] you know brother Branham asked well how
[1:23:13] does denominations get started
[1:23:16] he says well God will reveal a little
[1:23:18] something to somebody and they'll come
[1:23:20] and make a denomination around that
[1:23:22] belief that they have and then God can't
[1:23:24] move any further
[1:23:27] and he goes on and asks he says how can
[1:23:29] the Methodist ever accept anything more
[1:23:31] than a second work of Grace
[1:23:33] because they've denominated themselves
[1:23:35] around that
[1:23:36] how can the lutherans believe any more
[1:23:39] than the just shall live by faith why
[1:23:41] they can because they've denominated
[1:23:43] around that that that that Doctrine amen
[1:23:47] how can the Baptist believe anything
[1:23:48] else than what they believe see it's
[1:23:51] because they denominated themselves
[1:23:52] under that how can the Pentecostals
[1:23:55] believe that that speaking in tongues
[1:23:57] you know or believe anything more uh
[1:24:00] than speaking in tongues is the evidence
[1:24:02] that a man has the Holy Ghost they can't
[1:24:04] because they are denominated under that
[1:24:08] can you say man so then brother Brian
[1:24:10] says that's the reason why we are not a
[1:24:13] denomination see you cannot accept the
[1:24:15] perfect will of God when you're under a
[1:24:18] denomination when you're under a
[1:24:19] headship of man you you cannot accept
[1:24:22] the full word of God it's already been
[1:24:25] proven
[1:24:27] and when they reject the word of God
[1:24:29] they die
[1:24:31] ain't that right amen and look where
[1:24:33] their churches are are they ready for a
[1:24:35] Rapture absolute or not are they fit for
[1:24:37] a body change absolutely not do they
[1:24:39] have that spiritual strength they need
[1:24:40] absolutely not because they failed to
[1:24:43] move on with the word of God
[1:24:45] yeah amen
[1:24:47] so now brother Brown says see the Lord
[1:24:50] has given us the opportunity to merge
[1:24:52] this little church in many different
[1:24:53] denominations but we don't do it because
[1:24:56] we want to State just like this so it
[1:24:59] can be under the rulership and headship
[1:25:01] of Jesus Christ that's right whatever he
[1:25:05] reveals to us and we see that it's the
[1:25:07] truth and it lines up with his word all
[1:25:09] the way back and forth through this
[1:25:11] Bible that is the truth see uh uh or
[1:25:15] that it is the truth and the spirit is
[1:25:18] agreeing on it we have no denominational
[1:25:20] barriers to hold us from accepting that
[1:25:24] do you see it do you see why you can
[1:25:26] accept the perfect will of God
[1:25:30] because you're not under a barrier
[1:25:32] you're you're of of a denomination that
[1:25:35] is restricting you from moving on with
[1:25:38] God
[1:25:39] church you can have anything that God
[1:25:41] has for you
[1:25:43] under the headship of the word
[1:25:46] can you say man
[1:25:48] so he said see we go right head into it
[1:25:52] and move right on see so what we're
[1:25:54] doing tonight as as message Believers
[1:25:57] and those that really believe in the
[1:25:59] message of the hour were progressing can
[1:26:02] you say that with me progressing we're
[1:26:04] progressing into the perfect will of God
[1:26:08] step-by-step trial by trial Temptation
[1:26:10] by Temptation day by day we're
[1:26:13] progressing into the perfect will of God
[1:26:16] you say well I I'm not where I ought to
[1:26:18] be but that don't worry about that you
[1:26:21] just stay with the message stay under
[1:26:23] the headship of the word of God and and
[1:26:26] you're progressing you're you're you
[1:26:28] know it's like that woman that testified
[1:26:30] brother Bram talked about that said you
[1:26:32] know I'm not what I uh where I want to
[1:26:35] be he's what I need to be he says you
[1:26:37] know and and uh I'm not where I ought to
[1:26:40] be and and and whatever but she says but
[1:26:43] there's one thing about it I'm not what
[1:26:44] I used to be and I I think that's all of
[1:26:47] our testimony is that we're not what we
[1:26:50] used to be
[1:26:54] but I want to encourage you don't stop
[1:26:55] there
[1:26:57] and say well at least I'm not in a
[1:26:58] denomination you can dry up just as much
[1:27:01] in a message Church
[1:27:08] see
[1:27:11] this bride and who isn't
[1:27:14] now the perfect The Book of Revelation
[1:27:16] speaks of the in her daughters
[1:27:18] which is symbolic of the Catholic church
[1:27:20] and the denominational Protestant
[1:27:22] churches
[1:27:23] and and also brother Branham said some
[1:27:25] of these independent churches are just
[1:27:27] as bad and sometimes even worse
[1:27:31] and they're all going into the
[1:27:33] tribulation
[1:27:35] and and we know that the foolish virgin
[1:27:38] is going to go to the tribulation
[1:27:40] and and uh she's the remnant and 12 uh
[1:27:45] Revelations 12 16 and the dragon was
[1:27:47] Roth with the woman and went to make war
[1:27:49] with the remnant of her seed now
[1:27:51] remember I'm so that's the that's the
[1:27:53] foolish virgin
[1:27:54] which keep the Commandments of God and
[1:27:57] have the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:28:00] now this is during the tribulation
[1:28:01] period ain't that right
[1:28:03] at this time though the bride is already
[1:28:08] caught up in the glory sitting at the
[1:28:10] marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:28:14] ain't that right
[1:28:15] but the sleeping virgin is going to be
[1:28:18] hunted down by the Dragon
[1:28:20] brother Brown said the dragons first
[1:28:22] water from his mouth which means
[1:28:24] multitudes and people armies that were
[1:28:26] searched down and take this woman
[1:28:28] remnant of her seed and will kill her
[1:28:31] and that now that will be in the
[1:28:33] tribulation period ain't that right so
[1:28:36] another place says the dragon makes war
[1:28:38] with those who did not receive the Holy
[1:28:40] Ghost and yet they are a Sanctified
[1:28:42] Church
[1:28:43] another place that's when the Protestant
[1:28:45] church under the Federation of churches
[1:28:48] which is the image to the Beast which is
[1:28:50] now being formed and there will be a boy
[1:28:52] caught upon all churches like this
[1:28:55] another place he said the real church
[1:28:57] has gone on she's done at the wedding
[1:28:59] supper for his face of time where the
[1:29:01] wedding supper will be going on uh the
[1:29:04] last week and he said that's when the
[1:29:06] tribulation sets in when the locus and
[1:29:08] the persecution Rises upon the churches
[1:29:11] of things like that see
[1:29:13] now he says the another place the
[1:29:15] foolish Virgin Goes in the tribulation
[1:29:18] it's because she's rejected the
[1:29:20] atonement in its fullness she is a
[1:29:24] Believer a professed believer but she
[1:29:25] will have to go through the tribulation
[1:29:27] period
[1:29:29] so in other words she has refused to
[1:29:32] come under the headship of the
[1:29:34] Vindicated word and by doing so she
[1:29:37] rejects her atonement
[1:29:40] in its fullness
[1:29:42] can you say amen amen so therefore she
[1:29:46] she has nothing to hide her
[1:29:49] uh uh uh and and keep her and and bring
[1:29:53] her out of uh in an escape from from
[1:29:56] God's Wrath
[1:29:59] ain't that right
[1:30:01] amen she refused the perfect will of God
[1:30:07] she let whatever happen
[1:30:10] to where she wouldn't come on in
[1:30:13] to to the word
[1:30:15] hello
[1:30:17] and because she's rejected the message
[1:30:19] of the hour
[1:30:21] she goes to the tribulation
[1:30:27] but we find now looking at at the church
[1:30:32] brother Branham said he is the
[1:30:34] firstfruits of the Resurrection then
[1:30:36] what is he he is the head of the body
[1:30:39] which is his church bride
[1:30:42] ain't that right so his body is his
[1:30:46] church which is his bride and he is her
[1:30:50] head
[1:30:52] I'm not choosing the will of God the
[1:30:53] perfect will of God
[1:30:55] see the bride and body must follow the
[1:30:58] head all right and he's the word
[1:31:01] ain't that right for it is part of his
[1:31:04] resurrection and part of the mystery
[1:31:07] it's impossible everybody say it's
[1:31:09] impossible for it not to go
[1:31:13] she's part of his body
[1:31:15] she is his bride
[1:31:18] right so she's going to go through all
[1:31:21] kinds of things but every time her
[1:31:24] choice will be the word
[1:31:27] perfect will of God
[1:31:29] he said see it's part of God's mystery
[1:31:31] how God revealed himself here and raised
[1:31:33] it up by the word so he Reveals His
[1:31:36] Church by raising it up by the same word
[1:31:40] man following that word of God come
[1:31:43] under subjection to the word of God
[1:31:45] choosing the word of God Amen stand with
[1:31:47] the message of the hour there is a power
[1:31:50] there that's going to raise you up and
[1:31:51] it is Raising it's raising the bride up
[1:31:54] right now
[1:31:55] now I I'm I'm going to say it but it
[1:31:57] ain't gonna leave her wrapped up in this
[1:31:59] stupid Hollywood
[1:32:01] it ain't going to leave her wrapped up
[1:32:03] in the old carnal ways of of of religion
[1:32:06] I I'd just be honest it ain't going to
[1:32:09] keep her all wrapped up in sports it
[1:32:11] ain't gonna it ain't gonna keep her all
[1:32:13] wrapped up and that's you know the
[1:32:14] television and the YouTube and and and
[1:32:17] and all of this junk that is going on
[1:32:19] you can't tell me that a real message
[1:32:22] believer that that is is is caught up
[1:32:25] under the headship of the word that
[1:32:26] leaves them like that it just ain't
[1:32:29] brother Branham saw that bride not just
[1:32:32] going up and down over the hill that she
[1:32:35] saw her rise and rising and Rising
[1:32:39] that's what this message is for
[1:32:43] ain't that right
[1:32:47] yes I think we ought to be getting
[1:32:49] stronger in our trials
[1:32:52] you believe it stronger Christians
[1:32:56] so it's part of God's mystery see so he
[1:32:59] Reveals His church he Reveals His church
[1:33:01] not reveals it to his church not this
[1:33:04] what not what he's saying here he
[1:33:06] Reveals His Church by raising her up by
[1:33:10] the same word
[1:33:13] it's a part of his threefold mystery
[1:33:16] as the head was took from the grave so
[1:33:18] must the body follow him back to Eden
[1:33:21] can you say man following Back to Eden
[1:33:24] why that's his perfect will
[1:33:26] his perfect will is not for you to be
[1:33:28] here contaminated like like flies on
[1:33:30] dung
[1:33:32] [Music]
[1:33:34] right
[1:33:36] you've been around it you've seen old
[1:33:37] dung you see no the trash
[1:33:41] big old big old flies flying all around
[1:33:44] it
[1:33:45] come on now I didn't say anything bad
[1:33:46] it's just truth
[1:33:49] it's it's flies
[1:33:51] they like that junk
[1:33:55] ain't that right
[1:33:56] it's it's it's why I don't know but they
[1:34:00] do
[1:34:01] and Spirits like church carnal believers
[1:34:06] they just swarm around them and swarm
[1:34:09] around them you see a lot of religious
[1:34:12] people that are just ate up by demons
[1:34:17] now let's just face it it's the truth
[1:34:21] and everything that the devil brings out
[1:34:24] of this in this world and new inventions
[1:34:26] of the people follow it
[1:34:28] they Gotta Have It
[1:34:33] it's true yes come on it's it's getting
[1:34:37] to the place that the women's skirts are
[1:34:39] getting shorter and shorter
[1:34:42] and so what do they do to cover it they
[1:34:43] wear their britches underneath the skirt
[1:34:48] and and and then what
[1:34:51] then it just goes on and on and on and
[1:34:54] on and on
[1:34:57] come on Church
[1:34:59] but where's the power at in your life
[1:35:03] where where's that overcoming power
[1:35:08] as I mentioned Wednesday night they got
[1:35:10] this this this this machine now that can
[1:35:12] take out all the cussing words so now
[1:35:14] we've just made it in we made it like
[1:35:16] it's okay to watch movies
[1:35:22] backslidden whatever you want to call it
[1:35:25] and then we say we're message believers
[1:35:29] brother Branham never said it's okay to
[1:35:31] watch movies because you know when they
[1:35:33] develop a machine that takes the cussing
[1:35:35] out
[1:35:36] he never said that he said the devil
[1:35:39] snuck a good one on us when he brought
[1:35:40] the television in the home
[1:35:43] ain't that right
[1:35:44] now Church you know and and I know we've
[1:35:47] all got growing to do but let's grow
[1:35:51] Sean Martin's got to grow but I want to
[1:35:53] grow
[1:35:54] we all want to grow don't we don't do we
[1:35:56] not want to grow we we can sit there and
[1:35:58] say well you just yeah you blessed me
[1:36:00] God you just preaching all over me you
[1:36:02] ain't got no proof of it if there ain't
[1:36:04] power in your life there's something
[1:36:06] that is dictating that stopping it from
[1:36:09] growing
[1:36:10] if we're struggling in our faith if
[1:36:13] we're struggling Amen to overcome things
[1:36:16] we might ought to check
[1:36:22] hey man
[1:36:24] go forward
[1:36:25] so we as the bride of Christ you know
[1:36:29] the man brother Brown said the man being
[1:36:30] the bridegroom is the head of the family
[1:36:33] and we as the bride of Christ are
[1:36:35] following our headship the Vindicated
[1:36:37] word Back to Eden
[1:36:38] so it is impossible for you to be left
[1:36:42] behind when you're following the
[1:36:44] Vindicated word
[1:36:46] and what is the Vindicated word the
[1:36:48] message of the hour
[1:36:49] when you're following the Vindicated
[1:36:51] word it's impossible for you to be left
[1:36:53] behind
[1:36:55] ain't that right it's when people refuse
[1:36:58] to follow to keep moving on keep moving
[1:37:00] on
[1:37:01] then then they die they die right there
[1:37:05] now you know uh uh so here brother Brown
[1:37:08] says the bride being the body of the
[1:37:10] bridegroom
[1:37:11] must follow the groom bridegroom because
[1:37:14] that's the head and the head is revealed
[1:37:18] and come back with eternal life Heaven
[1:37:20] believes he's revealed
[1:37:22] he's come back with eternal life and the
[1:37:24] body must follow that because it is
[1:37:26] husband and wife again
[1:37:28] as long as you're pregnant with the same
[1:37:30] word which is his body you've took his
[1:37:32] body become in him when you took the
[1:37:34] word not the Creed the word don't you
[1:37:37] fail this he says the body therefore
[1:37:39] cannot recognize any other hits yet but
[1:37:42] the word
[1:37:43] because the head is connected with the
[1:37:45] body and the head is the word and it's
[1:37:47] the same word one hits you
[1:37:50] believe that
[1:37:51] so when when people you know we we're
[1:37:56] not fighting with people that that uh
[1:38:00] you know say you know brother Branham
[1:38:02] you know hit it and missed and and and
[1:38:05] then they become the judge of the book
[1:38:07] and they say well if if you can't find
[1:38:10] it in the Bible then then that's just
[1:38:12] brother branham's opinion well we're not
[1:38:14] going to fight with them but I'm not
[1:38:16] going to accept what they got to say
[1:38:18] I will not accept it
[1:38:21] because they're not a headship
[1:38:23] this message is our headship
[1:38:26] and what they want to do they want to
[1:38:28] dilute that headship they want to take
[1:38:29] your faith away from this message
[1:38:33] if if they have their if that anointing
[1:38:36] that is upon them that evil spirit that
[1:38:38] is causing them to teach them things if
[1:38:40] it really has its way you'll believe
[1:38:42] nothing about this word you don't
[1:38:44] believe nothing about this message
[1:38:48] look where people are today they don't
[1:38:49] even believe that there's a God these
[1:38:51] days
[1:38:52] Satan has been able to take them type of
[1:38:54] people
[1:38:55] to where they can look at all creation
[1:38:57] and deny there's a God
[1:39:01] can you say man but it's an anointing
[1:39:04] but this bride has got to believe this
[1:39:06] message
[1:39:07] this bride is not just to quote the
[1:39:10] message but come under the message and
[1:39:13] let this message be her headship because
[1:39:14] that's the only headship there is there
[1:39:17] is one headship and that's Christ so
[1:39:19] then they say well then they separate
[1:39:21] Christ from the message that's nonsense
[1:39:23] Christ is the anointed word
[1:39:26] he is the Vindicated word can you say
[1:39:29] amen and there's only one headship and
[1:39:32] that's Christ and the body only
[1:39:34] recognizes one thing that's the word
[1:39:38] then you say Amen
[1:39:41] so how can the Catholics put themselves
[1:39:43] under the jurisdiction of a pope I don't
[1:39:45] know how
[1:39:46] everything the prophet says that the
[1:39:49] Catholic Church teaches is so contrary
[1:39:51] to the first word that God recognized to
[1:39:53] be his church by signs and wonders and
[1:39:56] that same word has been brought forth
[1:39:58] today in its purity
[1:40:01] right
[1:40:02] that same word has been brought forth
[1:40:05] today in his Purity showing the same
[1:40:08] Resurrection
[1:40:11] that he had back then
[1:40:13] and what is it it's God living among his
[1:40:15] people
[1:40:16] doing the same things
[1:40:18] can you say Amen you love the Lord
[1:40:22] amen if the musicians will come
[1:40:25] so he says our headship is in heaven not
[1:40:27] I'm not going to Rome I'm going to
[1:40:29] heaven when I die the headship is in
[1:40:32] heaven
[1:40:33] and the body must follow the head as the
[1:40:35] wife follows the husband
[1:40:36] being that Adam was not deceived he
[1:40:39] walked out with Eve Eve was deceived she
[1:40:41] was in the transgression or now now
[1:40:44] listen to this I I've read this I've
[1:40:46] heard this message many times before but
[1:40:49] this has really struck home as I was uh
[1:40:53] looking at it today
[1:40:55] but he says see Eve was deceived she was
[1:40:59] in the transgression or the entire
[1:41:02] resurrection of the whole body would
[1:41:05] have come forth at the day of the Lord
[1:41:08] Jesus when he come forth from the grave
[1:41:12] he had to redeem her
[1:41:15] which is his body she has to be redeemed
[1:41:19] in order to come to him
[1:41:21] he says do you see it oh my it couldn't
[1:41:24] have happened then the Redemption is
[1:41:28] going on
[1:41:29] now so that's why the church the bride
[1:41:33] could not come at that time
[1:41:38] the Redemption wasn't done
[1:41:42] can you say man
[1:41:44] but look where we're at today
[1:41:47] I believe that the Redemption
[1:41:50] and and it could be a long subject so
[1:41:54] just hear me what I'm saying
[1:41:57] the Redemption of the Bride is almost
[1:41:59] completed
[1:42:01] or maybe already completed
[1:42:04] we don't know
[1:42:07] but all I know
[1:42:10] is that what God thought of this bride
[1:42:12] to be she's here
[1:42:15] what God's future for his bride has
[1:42:17] always been in his mind the perfect will
[1:42:20] for he of for this bride
[1:42:23] is coming to to to to be accomplished
[1:42:26] it's here
[1:42:28] which shows then that the there there
[1:42:30] must be we're right close to where this
[1:42:34] this bride is going to be finished up
[1:42:38] there is
[1:42:42] there is that has come into full
[1:42:43] obedience again
[1:42:45] to the word of God
[1:42:47] God has restored the word to us again
[1:42:52] aren't you glad for that
[1:42:54] Eve had the word she failed
[1:42:57] and God has given us the same chance at
[1:43:00] it
[1:43:01] we will not fall
[1:43:03] we're ordained not to fall
[1:43:05] and because that we've come into this
[1:43:08] full obedience to the word
[1:43:11] the Millennium is coming on the Rapture
[1:43:14] is here everything is now taking place
[1:43:16] because the bride has found her position
[1:43:18] can you say Amen she's no longer a
[1:43:22] fallen bride she's a redeemed bride
[1:43:26] she said
[1:43:27] she said she said he is
[1:43:29] kid with her again
[1:43:31] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life
[1:43:34] of his life power of his power she is
[1:43:37] him
[1:43:38] she is him church that's what you are
[1:43:42] oh choosing the perfect will of God
[1:43:48] not saying hear God Desiring to bring
[1:43:51] her in
[1:43:52] to to a land of peace and a land of of
[1:43:56] of of where there's no sin no and then
[1:43:59] we're saying oh no no no no no I got to
[1:44:01] do this first I remember
[1:44:04] he gave he gave a bidding to the
[1:44:06] marriage supper
[1:44:08] come
[1:44:09] but there was others that said oh well I
[1:44:11] can't I'm I'm busy farm and I'm busy
[1:44:13] with this and I'm busy with this and I'm
[1:44:15] busy with that they come with all
[1:44:16] excuses
[1:44:19] but then he says Ah
[1:44:21] no doubt he looked at us and says go to
[1:44:24] the hedges and the byways compel them to
[1:44:27] come in
[1:44:28] my house must be full my table my table
[1:44:30] set it's got to have it's got to have
[1:44:33] somebody to sit there
[1:44:34] and this is where we've come in
[1:44:37] we ain't got no bargaining power we
[1:44:39] ain't saying oh God if you just hold on
[1:44:41] for a moment let me do this and do this
[1:44:42] I'm too busy with life
[1:44:44] no
[1:44:45] we're crying thy will be done
[1:44:48] thy will be done thy will can you say
[1:44:51] man and the Rapture takes place in you
[1:44:54] you're part of it it changes you from
[1:44:57] corruption to incorruption because
[1:44:59] that's the perfect will of God and
[1:45:01] you've accepted that perfect will of God
[1:45:03] Amen you're changed
[1:45:06] oh my God I love the Lord
[1:45:10] Blessed Be His holy name
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:13] so wonderful amen
[1:45:16] brother Brown said when the bride will
[1:45:18] get back to being a wordbright she will
[1:45:20] produce the very works that Jesus
[1:45:21] produced
[1:45:23] amen oh we could go on but I'll I'll
[1:45:26] just close amen what song
[1:45:31] all this is the evening time
[1:45:37] it's later than you think
[1:45:42] the bride is prepared
[1:45:46] foreign
[1:45:53] all things are ready now
[1:45:58] the bridegroom I hear
[1:46:02] [Music]
[1:46:04] half an ear to
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:10] hear oh sing it again all this is the
[1:46:16] evening time
[1:46:19] it's later than you think
[1:46:24] the bride is
[1:46:26] preparing now for the Lord
[1:46:35] all things are ready now
[1:46:39] the bridegroom I hear
[1:46:44] [Music]
[1:46:46] that has an ear to hear be
[1:46:50] The Time Is Here
[1:46:54] as they just play softly now
[1:46:58] brother Branham
[1:47:01] just kind of a lengthy quote but he says
[1:47:04] now when he was in his mediatorial work
[1:47:06] back there redeeming but someday he
[1:47:09] comes forth to get this book that he's
[1:47:11] redeemed
[1:47:12] and we're we're part of that book we are
[1:47:14] the book
[1:47:17] and all that's in this book would be him
[1:47:20] for that's the believer
[1:47:22] the words in the book and the word is
[1:47:24] him
[1:47:25] and all that's in that he come forth for
[1:47:29] this book of redemption whose names are
[1:47:31] written on the Lamb's Book before the
[1:47:33] foundation of the world when he was
[1:47:34] slain as a lamb and here he is today in
[1:47:38] his word manifesting the same thing he
[1:47:40] did there she cannot recognize another
[1:47:43] headship
[1:47:44] no sir there's no Bishop no nothing she
[1:47:47] recognizes one headship that's Christ
[1:47:49] and Christ is the word
[1:47:52] and as the head was took up from the
[1:47:54] grave so must his body follow him into
[1:47:56] Eden therefore the body cannot recognize
[1:47:58] any other headship but the headship of
[1:48:00] the word
[1:48:01] no man no denomination could put
[1:48:04] anything to it for whosoever shall take
[1:48:06] one word away from it or add one word to
[1:48:08] it it took away from it see you're dead
[1:48:11] hybrid right there she's back here see
[1:48:15] this testimony in her hands the
[1:48:17] filthiness of her fornications
[1:48:19] committing in spiritual adultery against
[1:48:21] the very word that she clings to believe
[1:48:24] therefore it's the word or nothing see
[1:48:27] that's right he is he the word how do
[1:48:30] you know it's right how do you know what
[1:48:32] works right
[1:48:33] see he the word is Vindicated
[1:48:37] he the word properly Vindicated is the
[1:48:40] headship the head of the church he is
[1:48:43] the word the headship he is
[1:48:46] properly
[1:48:48] identificate identified Vindicated by
[1:48:52] his own spirit being in the church
[1:48:54] itself the person showing forth himself
[1:48:57] in Vindication is the direct proof to
[1:49:01] the entire body you don't need treats
[1:49:04] then denominations have perished but the
[1:49:06] headship itself recognized in the body
[1:49:09] by personal identifications identifying
[1:49:12] himself proves the headship to the body
[1:49:14] then we are united under one Vindicated
[1:49:18] headship that is Christ the word of God
[1:49:21] not under any church then our headship
[1:49:24] is a kingdom the kingdom of God is
[1:49:27] within you the Bible says see Jesus the
[1:49:30] kingdom we are not a denomination we
[1:49:32] belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is
[1:49:35] the word of God made spirit and life in
[1:49:37] our own life bring in the past every
[1:49:40] promise in this day as it did in that
[1:49:43] day when the word in God Was Won and the
[1:49:46] word and God is one in his church today
[1:49:49] making it the headship of the body that
[1:49:52] is redeemed
[1:49:54] to bring the message in the last day and
[1:49:56] be taken up from the dead in the
[1:49:59] resurrection to go back and restore
[1:50:01] again as Adam and Eve in the beginning
[1:50:04] In the Garden of Eden oh my in that
[1:50:08] wonderful
