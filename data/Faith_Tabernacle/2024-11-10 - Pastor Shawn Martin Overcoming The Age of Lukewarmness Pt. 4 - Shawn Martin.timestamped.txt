[51:24] Fall Festival with uh just the U
[51:28] Fellowship uh with Believers and um
[51:31] always always enjoy having fellowship
[51:35] with other uh Believers amen and uh so
[51:40] we uh we all you know everyone's
[51:42] fighting battles and sometimes you know
[51:45] it may seem like you're just isolated
[51:48] and and going just by yourself but when
[51:52] when you get around Believers then you
[51:54] you realize that it's it's everybody
[51:57] fighting but everybody Victorious
[51:59] everybody's we're we're you know we're
[52:02] we're we're Overcomers that's the bride
[52:04] of Christ is is overcoming and uh so we
[52:08] thank the Lord for that brother Andrew
[52:10] is ministering in Canada today or this
[52:13] weekend and so I told him we'd be
[52:15] praying for him and uh the Lord would
[52:18] just give him an outpouring uh preaching
[52:20] there at brother Kelly hilderbrand and
[52:24] um um that place up in that area has
[52:27] just gone it's a war torn area as well
[52:32] years and years and years of just uh uh
[52:36] struggles and things and if you haven't
[52:38] met brother Kelly he's just a wonderful
[52:41] man and uh got to meet him last year
[52:44] there in Oklahoma and um he's just held
[52:47] things together and and um I certainly
[52:51] appreciate him and so I know that area
[52:54] is uh going through some things right
[52:56] now and so um we just want to pray for
[53:01] brother Andrew the Lord just using today
[53:04] in a special way amen before we go into
[53:07] the word let's just bow our heads and um
[53:10] ask the Lord to be with us
[53:13] father Lord your Prophet told us that we
[53:17] can do a lot of things too much we can
[53:20] read we
[53:22] can um we can work we can do all these
[53:26] things too much but we can never pray
[53:28] too
[53:29] much and father that is something that
[53:33] my heart's desire and and I'm sure the
[53:36] church here the folks is we we want a
[53:41] spirit of prayer to come upon us father
[53:45] and Lord um and I know there's been
[53:48] prayer throughout the service today but
[53:51] we're once again praying to you and just
[53:55] asking Lord that you would just move in
[53:57] a special way in this part of the
[53:59] service Lord I pray that you would
[54:03] anoint uh myself father help me to get
[54:07] myself out of the way and Lord I pray
[54:10] that you would anoint the people father
[54:13] we we see the the day approaching of
[54:17] your coming and Lord the world is
[54:20] getting so wicked and so contrary to
[54:24] your
[54:25] word father we need your word more than
[54:28] ever before father God may we fortify
[54:32] ourselves behind it and believe it with
[54:35] all that's within us anoint Faith Lord
[54:39] within every one of us father I pray
[54:43] Lord that you would bless and meet every
[54:45] need present even those that are maybe
[54:48] listening online father I pray you'd go
[54:51] in their home and may your presence just
[54:54] feel the place we at ask it father in
[54:57] Jesus Christ's
[54:59] name
[55:01] amen praise the Lord aren't you glad to
[55:03] be a Christian amen amen uh we want to
[55:07] look at uh Philippians
[55:10] 2 and
[55:15] 14 it says do all things without
[55:18] murmurings and
[55:20] disputings that you may be blameless and
[55:24] harmless the sons of god without rebuke
[55:28] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[55:31] generation among whom ye shine as lights
[55:36] in the world now we we know
[55:40] that the light has come in this
[55:44] age holding forth the Word of Life the
[55:48] word for the day that I may rejoice in
[55:52] the day of Christ that I have not run in
[55:55] vain neither labored in vain amen you
[56:00] can have your seats this
[56:03] morning of course it would seem that
[56:05] Paul is
[56:07] speaking uh to
[56:10] the people of his age and rightly so but
[56:15] I believe that this scripture would
[56:19] apply to us for Paul had laid the
[56:23] foundation and every every age has been
[56:27] tied to that Foundation that elect and
[56:32] if we fail as the the end we know that
[56:36] we're in the finishing up we are the
[56:39] finale if we were to fail then even he
[56:42] would have run in vain all those that
[56:46] have ran before us would have run in
[56:50] vain so then I believe that this is um
[56:54] uh important amen and this scripture
[56:57] would uh be applicable to us today I'm
[57:01] going to just use the title again and
[57:04] speak along the lines that we have been
[57:06] speaking and that's overcoming the age
[57:09] of lukewarmness yes and uh maybe go
[57:14] through uh uh church history and um and
[57:21] um just
[57:23] continue along the thought it may not
[57:26] get to it all today but um uh hopefully
[57:30] it'll be a help but thinking of this
[57:32] word perverse because he says to stand
[57:35] shining forth light that you may be
[57:37] blameless without rebuke in a perverse
[57:41] crooked uh Nation or generation or world
[57:46] and this word perverse means turned away
[57:50] from what is right or
[57:53] good uh uh other words for for perverse
[57:57] would be corrupt or corruption one
[58:01] definition is obstinate in opposing what
[58:05] is Right reasonable or accepted and they
[58:09] put that word
[58:11] wrongheaded uh Wayward or
[58:14] perverted and so uh this is what
[58:17] perverse means a perverted Nation a
[58:19] perverted and we believe that we are
[58:22] living in a perverted world today he a
[58:26] if there's ever a perverted generation
[58:29] we're we're living in it and the prophet
[58:32] said that it is perverted it's perverted
[58:35] mentally sexually physically and
[58:38] everything it's everything is is
[58:41] perverted and and he he he says you know
[58:45] he says that there are more unbelievers
[58:48] than we've ever had before you you you
[58:52] whatever age it would be from time to
[58:54] now there's more more unbelievers than
[58:57] ever before but notice what he would
[58:59] tell us he said they were ecclesiastical
[59:02] type of
[59:04] unbelievers so he wants to show us a the
[59:07] perversion we we see the perversion as
[59:10] far as uh you know men uh going to bed
[59:14] with men women going to bed with women
[59:17] that's perversion we we see the
[59:20] transgenders um you know men becoming
[59:23] women and or trying to become women
[59:25] they're not but
[59:26] uh trying to become women women trying
[59:28] to become men that's
[59:30] perversion we we see even marriages uh
[59:34] Fallen apart and and uh uh that's
[59:38] perversion we we see um uh and and and
[59:43] the reason why we would say that because
[59:45] God never intended for marriages to be
[59:48] broken he just never did uh and so we
[59:52] see a sign of perversion in everything
[59:55] uh in in in the world but brother
[59:58] brandham when he come he pointed the
[1:00:00] perversion in in the church and and so
[1:00:05] he he looked and he said they're they're
[1:00:07] ecclesiastical type of unbelievers and
[1:00:10] he says he said they they are the
[1:00:13] hardest the hardest to deal with uh than
[1:00:17] just plain uneducated Heathen that lives
[1:00:20] you know in the jungles of Africa or
[1:00:22] whatever and don't know what is left or
[1:00:24] right don't know how to write their
[1:00:26] names and all of that and we would call
[1:00:28] that Heathen you know but uh uh uh he
[1:00:32] said the worst the hardest to deal with
[1:00:34] is easy
[1:00:37] ecclesiastical uh
[1:00:38] unbelievers and and you know um and and
[1:00:43] so brother Bram talking about just the
[1:00:46] the the Heathen you know and the the
[1:00:49] jungles of Africa he said he comes in in
[1:00:51] his condition he never heard of God and
[1:00:54] now he wants to see something and as
[1:00:56] soon as you can prove to him what's
[1:00:58] truth he will accept it he said but the
[1:01:02] educated Heathen he said now he wants to
[1:01:05] draw his own opinion about it uh see
[1:01:07] because he knows so much about it you
[1:01:09] know and he can't just humble himself
[1:01:12] just to Faith and to look at God's word
[1:01:16] and and so we find that was the same
[1:01:19] thing that Jesus had to deal with in his
[1:01:22] day was was Pharisees and sadu es and
[1:01:27] and these things and and and and they
[1:01:29] were uh uh
[1:01:31] ecclesiastical unbelievers because they
[1:01:34] refused to look at the word of God even
[1:01:37] though it was standing right there being
[1:01:39] made manifest before them and they
[1:01:42] didn't want to see it so uh uh uh then
[1:01:46] so we could say there there is a
[1:01:48] perversion the perversion that we're
[1:01:50] seeing and and and when I'm speaking of
[1:01:53] that I'm speaking of perversion of all
[1:01:55] sorts is not just to big cities it's
[1:01:59] it's it's and it's not just to a America
[1:02:02] alone but this perversion is worldwide
[1:02:06] it's it's it's hitting everywhere it's
[1:02:09] it's it's it's hitting the poor the rich
[1:02:12] the smart the not so smart uh just you
[1:02:15] know uh uh it's it's in every place and
[1:02:19] and we're living in a time where more
[1:02:22] people claim to be Christian than any
[1:02:25] other time and so but when we study the
[1:02:29] the the the scriptures and church
[1:02:31] history we see that it's a perversion of
[1:02:35] what
[1:02:36] Christianity ought to ought to be there
[1:02:40] there is a perversion and and so uh um
[1:02:44] brother Brandon would tell us a
[1:02:46] Christian is a Christian because Christ
[1:02:49] lives in that person and Christian means
[1:02:53] Christlike not a membership but see it's
[1:02:56] a Vindication God producing through you
[1:03:00] just what a Christian is it's you
[1:03:03] getting out of the way and letting God
[1:03:05] come in and you taking no thoughts about
[1:03:08] it see let the mind that was in Christ
[1:03:11] be in you there you are that's the real
[1:03:15] Christian how many believes that that's
[1:03:17] the real Christian that's exactly what
[1:03:19] Adam was before he fell was that God
[1:03:23] could could flow through him and he had
[1:03:26] strictly the mind of Christ that that he
[1:03:29] had the authority that's where the
[1:03:30] authority came from was God a man having
[1:03:34] the preeminence over Mankind and when
[1:03:36] Adam spoke it was as though God was
[1:03:38] speaking he was standing in the place of
[1:03:42] God God spoke let there be light and and
[1:03:45] there was light and God created things
[1:03:48] by his word but now he created a man
[1:03:51] that would become his agent that that
[1:03:53] now he would speak and and it would be
[1:03:56] as though God himself was speaking amen
[1:04:00] see and so that is the Christian today
[1:04:02] that God has so uh uh uh has been
[1:04:06] working on that's the vision and here we
[1:04:08] are in the completion of of God's
[1:04:12] thoughts in this day and so now uh God
[1:04:16] looking for that real Christian because
[1:04:18] after sin had come the channel had been
[1:04:21] broken and and and we we know what what
[1:04:24] had done and so God working to bring
[1:04:28] that real Christian back that real that
[1:04:31] Adam and Eve uh uh back as it was in the
[1:04:35] garden before sin come along uh he
[1:04:39] purchased by his blood a a people we are
[1:04:43] a blood bought people and and and God
[1:04:46] made a way to to break the power of sin
[1:04:49] and and these things and on the day of
[1:04:52] Pentecost he was able to to uh after his
[1:04:56] Ascension he was able to bring back his
[1:04:59] spirit amen not upon just one man that
[1:05:03] was virgin born as as Christ was but he
[1:05:07] was able to take a group of sex born
[1:05:09] people that was Sinners and that was a
[1:05:12] perversion in in their their birth and
[1:05:15] and these things and and and produce
[1:05:19] real Christians amen that his Spirit
[1:05:22] would come into them and produce real
[1:05:26] Christians and and we see that acts 2
[1:05:28] and one when the day of Pentecost was
[1:05:31] fully come they were all with one Accord
[1:05:34] and in one place uh and suddenly there
[1:05:37] came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing
[1:05:39] Mighty Wind and it filled all the house
[1:05:42] where they were sitting and there
[1:05:44] appeared unto them clothing tongues like
[1:05:47] as a fire and it sat upon each of them
[1:05:50] and they were all filled with the Holy
[1:05:53] Ghost not all filled with an emotion not
[1:05:56] all filled with with Sensations and and
[1:05:59] and and things but filled with the Holy
[1:06:01] Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:06:04] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:06:07] utterance can you say Amen uh uh just to
[1:06:11] say this usually when the day of
[1:06:12] Pentecost is is mentioned uh um you know
[1:06:16] the people speaking with other tongues
[1:06:18] and as the spirit gave them utterance
[1:06:21] that that seems today to be the main
[1:06:24] focus among the the Pentecostal ranks um
[1:06:27] uh of this age that that's the main
[1:06:29] focus of of what what happened on on the
[1:06:33] day of Pentecost and it and it has
[1:06:35] become the criteria uh as to whether you
[1:06:38] have the Holy Ghost or not and that
[1:06:40] becomes the interpretation of what
[1:06:43] Pentecost is but that's the wrong
[1:06:45] interpretation because really the true
[1:06:48] interpretation of Pentecost is is about
[1:06:51] the life of God coming into an
[1:06:54] individual amen and quickening uh the
[1:06:57] word to them and and quickening them to
[1:07:01] the word of God see God came into that
[1:07:05] people to fulfill the word of God and to
[1:07:08] manifest himself amen we know that God
[1:07:11] is all powerful we know that God is all
[1:07:14] knowing we know that God is supreme and
[1:07:16] that God Reigns uh upon the throne and
[1:07:18] there's nothing that can hinder him
[1:07:20] there's there's nothing that can defeat
[1:07:23] him when that same God comes into a
[1:07:26] group of people amen he wants to
[1:07:28] manifest himself in that way Amen to the
[1:07:31] world to where that they don't live
[1:07:34] defeated and the Demons of hell can't
[1:07:36] conquer them but now he's in them people
[1:07:39] as the prophet said God determined that
[1:07:41] he would come into them people and he
[1:07:43] would defeat his enemy through them amen
[1:07:46] to show his power and his superiority
[1:07:49] and his his his holy nature ain't that
[1:07:53] right so God came into them a people
[1:07:56] that was helpless a people that could
[1:07:58] not do anything that that was subject to
[1:08:02] Satan and his powers now God would loose
[1:08:05] them by his blood and he would pour
[1:08:07] himself into them and began to fulfill
[1:08:11] his word and manifest himself now the
[1:08:14] prophet speaking of Pentecost on the day
[1:08:16] of Pentecost he the people there he said
[1:08:19] their mortal bodies were quickened their
[1:08:21] language was quickened their thoughts
[1:08:23] were quickened their Spirits were
[1:08:25] Quicken
[1:08:26] their life was quickened they were
[1:08:28] quickened all together they tried to
[1:08:30] talk and couldn't talk anymore uh in any
[1:08:32] more human languages they were so
[1:08:35] quickened up in the presence of God till
[1:08:37] they spoke in a new tongue a Heavenly
[1:08:40] language amen that's in the rising of
[1:08:42] the Sun or the Easter seal in 65 amen
[1:08:46] but see Pentecost now seems to be a bad
[1:08:48] word uh uh with most people in the in
[1:08:52] the message ranks and and uh and and and
[1:08:55] I just have to say they just don't
[1:08:57] understand the importance of Pentecost
[1:08:59] it's as though they say God would just
[1:09:01] do away with that we're in a better age
[1:09:03] how can we become better in in this age
[1:09:06] when when whatever God does he he can't
[1:09:09] do anything greater he can't do anything
[1:09:12] of more importance if God saved you by
[1:09:15] Blood what makes you think that he can't
[1:09:17] save another one amen we then why do we
[1:09:20] still preach the blood amen some of you
[1:09:22] might have been born or say 50 years ago
[1:09:25] and you're still preaching the blood of
[1:09:27] Jesus Christ well I say we can still
[1:09:29] preach Pentecost amen because that's
[1:09:32] exactly what it is if God Saves you and
[1:09:34] fills you with the Holy Ghost it's what
[1:09:36] he done on Pentecost can you say amen
[1:09:40] amen that's right you'll never get
[1:09:42] brother brandham to change it you'll
[1:09:43] change it in your own mind and your own
[1:09:45] Theology and your own Doctrine but
[1:09:47] brother brandham never changed such a
[1:09:49] thing amen see now so so we find when I
[1:09:52] come into the Pentecost or to the
[1:09:55] message man Pentecost seemed to be kind
[1:09:57] of the the curse word of the day amen
[1:10:00] and uh don't mention Pentecost Don't
[1:10:02] Preach Pentecost don't all of these
[1:10:04] things but they just don't understand
[1:10:06] the importance of it the way brother
[1:10:07] brandham did brother brandham said we'll
[1:10:09] only find Christ when we go back to
[1:10:11] Pentecost he says in another place drop
[1:10:14] just drop everything and rush back to
[1:10:17] Pentecost and find the true and the
[1:10:19] Living God see get back to the gospel
[1:10:23] again back to the power of God get back
[1:10:26] to Pentecost like the original was see
[1:10:29] he says in the last age there will be a
[1:10:31] group rise up the true Bride of the last
[1:10:34] day and she'll listen to the spirit in
[1:10:37] that day of gross Darkness the light
[1:10:39] will return by the pure word and we will
[1:10:43] return to the power of Pentecost to
[1:10:46] welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ can
[1:10:49] you say Amen see but Pentecost is not
[1:10:51] about speaking in tongues it's not about
[1:10:54] all of these things things uh we know
[1:10:56] that can happen but what the main focus
[1:10:59] of it is is the quickening power coming
[1:11:02] into a people amen an individual amen
[1:11:07] and quickening them to the word Jesus
[1:11:10] even said you shall receive power after
[1:11:13] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you
[1:11:16] amen so we find today that even even
[1:11:20] Pentecost a man of today has has gotten
[1:11:23] cold and formed
[1:11:25] and until it's it's just become another
[1:11:28] word like Baptist or or Catholic or uh
[1:11:33] uh or what whatever the meaning of that
[1:11:35] word uh is lost to the people and they
[1:11:38] are left without the experience of
[1:11:41] Pentecost Amen brother Bram said if you
[1:11:44] say well I'm Pentecost that don't mean
[1:11:46] no more to God than if you said you was
[1:11:48] Roman Catholic or a Jew or whatever you
[1:11:50] might be see that it it's lost its
[1:11:53] meaning because if you see your
[1:11:55] Pentecost and you have have failed to
[1:11:58] receive the the the experience of
[1:12:01] Pentecost then the name has no meaning
[1:12:03] to us it's just like with the message
[1:12:06] you can say I message all you want but
[1:12:08] if the God of this message ain't living
[1:12:10] in you then then then then the message
[1:12:13] is just another name can you say amen
[1:12:17] that's right see well the the the
[1:12:19] Pentecostal age in this in age stands
[1:12:23] defeated as as Sams did no power to
[1:12:26] overcome no joy no uh uh uh no no
[1:12:31] Victory you you you understand I'm
[1:12:34] talking about the the Pentecostal age it
[1:12:36] acts like the world lives like the world
[1:12:38] dresses like the world thinks like the
[1:12:40] world Amen conducts everything like the
[1:12:43] world smells like the world so what what
[1:12:46] would we say about it is the age of
[1:12:48] Pentecost is a perverse age it it it's
[1:12:52] it's come to a perversion of what God
[1:12:55] had intended can you say amen amen see
[1:12:59] and so we we understand that perversion
[1:13:02] it it it is the result of Satan's power
[1:13:06] and and influence he he is the one in
[1:13:08] the beginning that perverted God's
[1:13:11] creation amen and and and but but how
[1:13:15] could he do that how could this power of
[1:13:17] perversion come in and affect all
[1:13:20] creation and and the prophet would use
[1:13:22] another word deform amen Satan was able
[1:13:26] to deform he he couldn't create he
[1:13:28] didn't have that power of creation but
[1:13:30] he was able to pervert uh perform and by
[1:13:34] that perversion he would be able to to
[1:13:38] exalt himself and and and as though he
[1:13:41] was God but how was he able to do that
[1:13:44] because he got Eve to let down the bars
[1:13:49] Amen brother Brandon uses that you know
[1:13:51] saying we've let down the bars we've let
[1:13:53] down the bars you know how how did the
[1:13:56] goats get in you know uh uh uh uh the
[1:13:58] Sheep got out the goats got in well how
[1:14:00] did they do that you let down the bars
[1:14:02] right and and so he was able to to to
[1:14:06] gain his influence over creation over
[1:14:09] man amen simply by Eve letting down the
[1:14:14] bars she let down the Bars by reasoning
[1:14:17] with God's word amen that's right see
[1:14:21] and so because she did that it opened
[1:14:23] the door to Satan's influence and and
[1:14:26] power to where he was able to deform or
[1:14:30] uh uh uh pervert uh man and creation
[1:14:35] brother brandham would say uh Satan and
[1:14:38] his angels was kicked out of heaven and
[1:14:41] then they come to the earth and the
[1:14:43] battle set in because Eve broke down the
[1:14:47] barrier from where she was isolated
[1:14:50] behind the word of God and from that
[1:14:53] hour think of that from that very hour
[1:14:56] Satan won the battle over God's word
[1:14:59] because one of his subjects the the
[1:15:01] weaker let down the bars he said and
[1:15:04] that's exactly how Satan's won the
[1:15:06] battle every time has been because one
[1:15:09] of his subjects let down the bar from
[1:15:12] the word of God now church I I just
[1:15:15] believe that Satan will not amen be
[1:15:17] victorious over this bride Satan will
[1:15:20] not stop this Rapture from happening
[1:15:22] Satan will not stop this body change
[1:15:24] from happening can you say Amen Satan
[1:15:27] will not stop this Millennium from
[1:15:29] coming forward amen and coming on and
[1:15:32] and the kingdom of God being set up
[1:15:35] which tells us that there's a people
[1:15:37] that will not let down the bar of God's
[1:15:41] word I would rather be isolated amen
[1:15:43] with God's word than I would to be
[1:15:45] joined with anything in this world let
[1:15:49] me be isolated to God's word because if
[1:15:52] you're isolated amen behind God's word
[1:15:55] it breaks the power of Satan I don't
[1:15:58] care if it's sickness I don't care if
[1:16:00] it's discouragement I don't care if it's
[1:16:02] mental uh mental mind battles or
[1:16:05] whatever if you stay with that word it
[1:16:08] cannot it cannot amen uh uh defeat or
[1:16:12] Satan cannot win the battle amen but he
[1:16:15] wins the battle every time the subject
[1:16:19] of God Amen uh let's down the word of
[1:16:23] God can you say amen amen that's why you
[1:16:26] need to believe the word over uh uh over
[1:16:29] the doctor's words you need to believe
[1:16:30] the word over your situation amen you
[1:16:33] need to believe the word of God Amen you
[1:16:36] say well I just don't feel good believe
[1:16:38] the word of God Amen well they say I
[1:16:40] ain't going to make it believe the word
[1:16:41] of God Amen well Satan says that I'll
[1:16:44] never amen make it in a Rapture I don't
[1:16:46] feel worthy believe the word of God I
[1:16:49] don't care if you feel worthy or not
[1:16:51] you've got to believe the word you got
[1:16:55] to believe it do you believe
[1:16:56] that y so you know brother brandom even
[1:17:00] says this Believers will sometimes let
[1:17:03] down the bars to
[1:17:05] unbelief amen now he's speaking to us
[1:17:07] even Believers will sometimes let down
[1:17:10] the bars to unbelief and then then Satan
[1:17:15] will come in a whirlwind and causes
[1:17:18] fusses and stews and arguments and
[1:17:22] everything he said that is the devil
[1:17:25] getting among people well how did he get
[1:17:27] among the people if somebody let down
[1:17:31] the bar somebody let down in their faith
[1:17:35] with God can you say Amen oh God help us
[1:17:38] to hold that that that that banner up
[1:17:41] and that that bar up you see the church
[1:17:45] is supposed to be in a prominent
[1:17:47] position uh um in the world it it's to
[1:17:51] have that Pro uh prominent position in
[1:17:54] the world it's uh it's supposed to um uh
[1:17:58] be the framework as the prophet said
[1:18:01] that holds the the world together is the
[1:18:04] church and and and he says it knits what
[1:18:07] we call the morals and things of the
[1:18:10] world it's the church see the church the
[1:18:13] church has an important it's brother
[1:18:15] Bram typed the the church as the moon
[1:18:18] amen and you know the Moon it controls
[1:18:20] things upon the Earth it it keeps the
[1:18:22] Earth from being flooded it it there's a
[1:18:25] lot of things that the moon affects the
[1:18:27] the the Earth and and the changes of the
[1:18:30] Moon and all these things and and it can
[1:18:32] so silently but it'll it'll affect
[1:18:35] nature of man it affects the nature of
[1:18:36] animals it affect all of these things
[1:18:39] see and and so the church is likened to
[1:18:42] that that that it it when it's in its
[1:18:46] place it it affects it affects it it
[1:18:49] holds things together amen but notice
[1:18:52] what the prophet says but the church has
[1:18:54] become polluted perverted amen and
[1:18:58] therefore it has caused the world to
[1:19:01] become perverse amen see so so we don't
[1:19:05] lay the blame on politics we laid the
[1:19:07] blame on the church just like brother
[1:19:09] brandham did Brother brandom put the
[1:19:11] blame upon the church the world is the
[1:19:14] way it is because of the church home
[1:19:17] life is the way it is because of the
[1:19:19] church can you say Amen the schools are
[1:19:22] the way it is because of the church amen
[1:19:24] uh uh Russia is a communist today
[1:19:27] because of the church amen the church
[1:19:30] let down the bars ain't that right see
[1:19:33] and so any time that Israel in the Old
[1:19:36] Testament any time that Israel as a
[1:19:38] nation forsook the word of God Amen then
[1:19:42] they they went into captivity into the
[1:19:45] land of
[1:19:47] idolatry ain't that right so so on the
[1:19:50] day of Pentecost now there was one
[1:19:53] church every say one church amen that
[1:19:57] one church was started or planted by God
[1:20:01] and it was God's church amen at that
[1:20:04] time there was only one Faith one
[1:20:06] Doctrine one Lord uh uh one church and
[1:20:11] it was a Pentecostal Church Amen brother
[1:20:14] brandom says now as the first Adam was
[1:20:17] given a a bride fresh from the hand of
[1:20:20] God and was undivided undefiled for a
[1:20:23] brief span so was Christ the last Adam
[1:20:27] given a bride pure and fresh at
[1:20:30] Pentecost and she remained separate and
[1:20:34] undefiled for some time and we can look
[1:20:37] at that in the days of Acts and what
[1:20:39] what uh transpired and and the things
[1:20:41] that they done it was a mighty Church
[1:20:44] ain't that right but as Eve was tempted
[1:20:47] by Satan amen so was the church tempted
[1:20:51] and seduced amen and and the prophet
[1:20:54] said if become contaminated by the
[1:20:57] entrance of an antichrist spirit amen so
[1:21:01] just as as uh Satan was able to gain a a
[1:21:05] foothold in in the beginning because Eve
[1:21:08] let down the bar so did this Antichrist
[1:21:12] spirit amen gain entrance into the
[1:21:15] church because the church began to let
[1:21:19] down the bar amen John wrote about it in
[1:21:23] in his first epistle
[1:21:25] uh 1 John 4:3 he uh breaking in this is
[1:21:28] that Spirit of antichrist whereof you
[1:21:31] have heard that it should come and even
[1:21:35] now already is it work or is it in the
[1:21:39] world see this wasn't too long after
[1:21:42] Pentecost amen you also look look at
[1:21:46] Acts 20 and 28 uh Paul would say take
[1:21:50] heed therefore unto yourselves and to
[1:21:52] all the flock over which the Holy Ghost
[1:21:55] hath made you overseers to feed the
[1:21:57] Church of God which hath he hath
[1:22:00] purchased with his own blood for I know
[1:22:03] this that after my departing shall
[1:22:06] Grievious wolves enter in among you not
[1:22:09] sparing the flock also of your own
[1:22:12] selves shall men arise speaking perverse
[1:22:16] things Twisted things to draw away
[1:22:19] disciples after them therefore watch and
[1:22:23] remember that by the space of three
[1:22:25] years I cease not to warn everyone night
[1:22:29] and day with tears so so Paul saw this
[1:22:33] coming he he saw this starting to rise
[1:22:35] up in the church amen and and because he
[1:22:39] saw it and and no doubt he saw the
[1:22:41] devastation that it would do he he would
[1:22:44] weep and and he would travail for the
[1:22:47] people amen because he saw the enemy
[1:22:50] coming in uh the book of Jude uh it was
[1:22:53] written uh uh in the year of uh around
[1:22:57] the year of 66 ad which would have been
[1:23:01] uh around the prophet said was around uh
[1:23:03] 33 and 1/2 years after uh uh the Holy
[1:23:07] Ghost fell at Pentecost so 33 and A2
[1:23:09] years that's not just too far away from
[1:23:13] the that that time and but notice what
[1:23:16] he writes Jude uh in the third verse and
[1:23:19] fourth he said beloved when I gave all
[1:23:22] diligence to you to write unto you of
[1:23:25] the common salvation it was needful for
[1:23:28] me to write unto you and exhort you that
[1:23:31] you should earnestly contend for the
[1:23:34] faith now he's telling the people
[1:23:36] earnestly contend for this see which was
[1:23:39] once delivered amen unto the Saints so
[1:23:43] it it it then it it was showing that
[1:23:46] they were starting to slip away amen
[1:23:49] earnestly content and he this is 33 and
[1:23:51] A2 years after Pentecost and he's
[1:23:54] already warning the church contend for
[1:23:57] that faith that was once delivered for
[1:24:00] there are certain men crept in unawares
[1:24:03] who were before of old ordained to this
[1:24:06] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[1:24:08] grace of our God into last seious and
[1:24:11] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[1:24:14] Jesus Christ now the day of Pentecost it
[1:24:17] started in uh
[1:24:19] ad33 the first church age started in a.
[1:24:24] 53 so that means it was 20 years after
[1:24:28] Pentecost around that time notice what
[1:24:31] God would say to this church of the the
[1:24:34] first church uh age uh uh there in
[1:24:38] Revelations 2 and one unto the angel of
[1:24:41] the Church of Ephesus write these things
[1:24:44] sayith he that holdeth the Seven Stars
[1:24:46] in his right hand who walketh in the
[1:24:48] midst of the seven golden candlesticks I
[1:24:51] Know Thy works and thy labor and thy
[1:24:53] patience and how thou canest not bear
[1:24:56] them which are evil and thou has tried
[1:24:59] them which say they are Apostles and are
[1:25:01] not and has found them Liars so this is
[1:25:04] already springing up in the church and
[1:25:07] has borne and has patience and for my
[1:25:10] name's sake H has labored and Hast not
[1:25:12] fainted nevertheless I have somewhat
[1:25:15] against thee thou because thou Hast left
[1:25:19] thy First Love ain't that right so here
[1:25:22] at the church in the first Church age 20
[1:25:25] years or so after Pentecost the the
[1:25:29] church had already been identified by
[1:25:33] God as a fallen woman uh not too long
[1:25:37] after Pentecost see so just as Satan was
[1:25:41] able to get to Eve before Adam uh uh so
[1:25:45] Satan seduced the church amen uh the
[1:25:48] bride of Christ before the marriage
[1:25:51] supper of the lamb and and so this word
[1:25:55] Ephesus the prophet says has a compound
[1:25:58] meaning it's it means aimed at or or
[1:26:02] relaxed uh they're uh aimed at and
[1:26:05] relaxed and he says the the high
[1:26:07] aspirations of this age that had begun
[1:26:10] with the fullness of the spirit the
[1:26:13] depth of God on the day of Pentecost
[1:26:16] whereby they were aiming at the High
[1:26:19] Calling of God is that not what Paul
[1:26:21] said I press toward the mark of of the
[1:26:24] the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:26:26] Amen that was their ambition was the
[1:26:28] high calling of God Amen see and and and
[1:26:32] he says now it began to give way to a
[1:26:36] less watchful attitude amen just the
[1:26:39] attitude was less watchful it it began
[1:26:42] to be relaxed a less Ardent following of
[1:26:46] Jesus Christ began to manifest itself as
[1:26:50] an omen that in the future ages the
[1:26:54] physical vehicle called The Church would
[1:26:57] sink to the awfulness of the depth of
[1:27:00] Satan it had become relaxed and was
[1:27:05] drifting so we could see in that age uh
[1:27:08] the first age that the church began to
[1:27:10] let down the bars amen and and therefore
[1:27:15] brother Brandon says the tiny seed
[1:27:17] planted in that Ephesian age would one
[1:27:21] day grow in the spirit of of error until
[1:27:25] all foul birds of the air would Roost in
[1:27:29] its branches so then Satan uh God
[1:27:33] planted his seed on the day of Pentecost
[1:27:35] afterward Satan was able to plant his
[1:27:37] little tiny seed Amen in in there and
[1:27:41] and of course this for was foretold of
[1:27:44] Jesus there in Matthew uh
[1:27:47] 13:24 where he says the Kingdom of
[1:27:49] Heaven is liken unto a man with so good
[1:27:51] seed in his field but while men slipped
[1:27:55] his enemy came and so tears among the
[1:27:57] wheat and went his way but then but when
[1:28:01] the blade was sprung up and brought
[1:28:03] forth fruit and appeared the tears also
[1:28:06] or then appeared the tears also so the
[1:28:09] Servants of the householder came and
[1:28:11] said unto him sir did not thou sow good
[1:28:15] seed in thy field uh from whence then ha
[1:28:18] it tears you know where did it come from
[1:28:21] and he says an enemy hath done this the
[1:28:24] servant said unto him wilt thou then
[1:28:27] that we go and gather them up and he
[1:28:30] said nay no see lest while you gather up
[1:28:33] the tears ye root up also the wheat with
[1:28:36] them but let them grow together until
[1:28:39] the Harvest this age right let him grow
[1:28:42] up and in the time of harvest I will say
[1:28:45] to the Reapers Gather ye together first
[1:28:48] the tears bind them up in bundles to
[1:28:51] burn them but gather the wheat into my
[1:28:54] barn now just reading a lot of quotes
[1:28:57] here and and but brother Brandon would
[1:28:59] tell us so in offensive so inoffensive
[1:29:05] to human re reasoning would that little
[1:29:08] plant appear that uh uh to that new EVE
[1:29:13] the new church that again she would be
[1:29:16] deceived by Satan so in offensive to
[1:29:20] human reasoning it's just a little bit
[1:29:23] here just little drop here it That's
[1:29:25] what Satan does Amen so many times amen
[1:29:29] he plants things that looks good it
[1:29:32] looks justifiable but if it's against
[1:29:35] God's word it's not of God it's a little
[1:29:38] seed that wants to plant in our in our
[1:29:41] hearts ain't that right amen see and so
[1:29:44] the church was deceived Again by uh
[1:29:48] deceived by Satan amen and so the
[1:29:51] Ephesian age he said had presented to
[1:29:53] her
[1:29:54] the
[1:29:55] opportunity uh uh for God's best amen
[1:29:59] she was presented God's best amen she
[1:30:02] had that opportunity to uh uh uh to be
[1:30:06] amen uh uh you know God's best for her
[1:30:09] and and for a while she prevailed and
[1:30:12] then relaxed everybody say she relaxed
[1:30:15] then relaxed amen see and in that
[1:30:20] unguarded moment Satan planted the SE
[1:30:24] seed of complete
[1:30:27] ruination think of that notice the power
[1:30:30] of the seed that he plants amen is is
[1:30:34] the seed of complete ruination so a
[1:30:38] Satan was able to get his foot in in the
[1:30:40] door in the church and bring about a
[1:30:43] perversion not only in in in the first
[1:30:47] church age but notice how it continued
[1:30:49] in all Seven Ages ain't that right now
[1:30:53] this is why we look at Roman or
[1:30:56] Revelation 61 and it was important for
[1:31:00] us that the seals would be open amen so
[1:31:03] that we would know what Satan had been
[1:31:06] doing amen see and and because you
[1:31:09] cannot overcome you know uh you well
[1:31:13] brother Brown how do you say it to
[1:31:14] overcome you got to recognize the devil
[1:31:16] in every one of his tricks and and we're
[1:31:18] living in the most deceptive age ever
[1:31:21] amen because that seed that he planted
[1:31:24] has grown up into maturity to where he
[1:31:27] looks exactly so close that it would
[1:31:30] deceive the very elect but thank God the
[1:31:33] seals were open amen uh uh for that
[1:31:36] elect but here Revelation 61 and I saw
[1:31:40] when the lamb opened one of the seals
[1:31:43] and I heard as it were the noise of
[1:31:45] Thunder one of the four beasts saying
[1:31:47] come and see and I saw and behold a
[1:31:49] white horse and he that said on him had
[1:31:52] a bow now I'm doing this for maybe some
[1:31:55] that don't understand the why we believe
[1:31:58] things uh but I I saw an a White Horse
[1:32:01] He that sat on him had a bowl and had a
[1:32:04] crown uh was given to him and he went
[1:32:08] forth conquering and to conquer and when
[1:32:11] he had opened the second seal I heard
[1:32:13] the second beast say come and see and
[1:32:15] there went out another horse that was
[1:32:17] red and power was given to him uh uh
[1:32:21] that set upon that sat there on to take
[1:32:24] peace from the earth and that they
[1:32:27] should kill one another and there was
[1:32:29] given unto him a great sword and when he
[1:32:32] had opened the third seal I heard the
[1:32:34] third be say come and see and I beheld
[1:32:37] and L a black horse and he that set upon
[1:32:40] him had a pair of balances in his hand
[1:32:43] and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the
[1:32:45] four Beast say a measure of wheat for a
[1:32:48] penny three measures of barley for a
[1:32:50] penny and see thou hurt not the oil and
[1:32:53] the wine
[1:32:54] see and when he had opened the fourth
[1:32:56] seal I heard the voice of the fourth
[1:32:58] Beast say come and see and I looked and
[1:33:01] behold a Pale Horse and his name that
[1:33:04] set on him was death and Hell Followed
[1:33:07] With Him and power was given unto them
[1:33:11] uh over the fourth part of the earth to
[1:33:13] kill with a sword and with hunger and
[1:33:16] with death and with the Beast of the
[1:33:19] earth amen so we look at this of course
[1:33:23] East represents power ain't that right
[1:33:26] so there was a power amen that was
[1:33:28] writing amen and and and we know now
[1:33:32] that this was a satanic power amen and a
[1:33:37] a perverse power ain't that right it had
[1:33:39] the power to pervert to deform to kill
[1:33:44] uh uh to destroy not only physically but
[1:33:48] spiritually ain't that right amen now as
[1:33:51] we know uh uh brother Bram said you know
[1:33:54] and and you could study it a lot of a
[1:33:56] lot of commentaries a lot of theologians
[1:33:58] and things uh down Through the Ages has
[1:34:00] always attributed that white horse to be
[1:34:02] Christ amen for only he could be a white
[1:34:05] white represent you know righteousness
[1:34:07] and all of these things and so and even
[1:34:09] brother brandham thought that that that
[1:34:11] was Christ all right but when the lamb
[1:34:13] come and open the seals then brother
[1:34:16] brandham received a revelation hold it
[1:34:18] this ain't Christ this is the
[1:34:22] Antichrist the de receiving and acting
[1:34:26] as though he is righteous he it's a
[1:34:28] religious spirit can you say amen amen
[1:34:32] see and so and and and notice it's not
[1:34:35] four different writers but the prophet
[1:34:37] told us it's the same writer changing
[1:34:40] masks amen he's changing himself amen
[1:34:44] see and so this writer writes through
[1:34:47] all seven Church ages and his influence
[1:34:51] affects the whole Earth
[1:34:54] ain't that right it affects the whole
[1:34:57] earth and all the peoples of the Earth
[1:35:00] or I would say the peoples of the earth
[1:35:03] it does not affect the bride does not
[1:35:06] affect the righteous can you say Amen
[1:35:08] the elect and and so or or it well you
[1:35:13] understand uh uh it didn't deceive the
[1:35:15] elect let's put it that way of course it
[1:35:18] it it they were affected in in one sense
[1:35:21] of the word amen but you know so so we
[1:35:24] find that this was the Antichrist he had
[1:35:28] gained a hold in the church because the
[1:35:31] church let down the bars the church got
[1:35:33] relaxed the church amen see and he was
[1:35:37] able to come in and began his Ride
[1:35:39] Through the Ages that of that Gentile
[1:35:43] dispensation now brother bradam says the
[1:35:45] very religion of Ephesus types out
[1:35:49] perfectly this first church age and sets
[1:35:52] the tener see it'ss the foundation or
[1:35:56] establishes a way of the ages to come
[1:35:59] see in the first place the Magnificent
[1:36:02] Temple of Diana which was in Ephesus see
[1:36:06] uh uh that was so many years in building
[1:36:10] and housed in its sacred courts the most
[1:36:13] lustrous and unobstrusive image of Diana
[1:36:18] that one could imagine she was
[1:36:21] absolutely unlike any other of her
[1:36:24] images seated in the other temples
[1:36:27] dedicated to her see she was simply an
[1:36:30] almost shapeless female figure that
[1:36:34] finally sunk into the block of wood from
[1:36:37] which she was carved I wish I had a
[1:36:39] picture to uh to show you uh there maybe
[1:36:42] we can uh find
[1:36:44] one uh next time but but uh so so she
[1:36:49] was a shapeless uh this this Idol was a
[1:36:52] shapeless Fem fale figure that sunk into
[1:36:56] a a a a uh the block of wood from which
[1:36:59] she was carved and her two arms were
[1:37:02] formed of two simple iron bars so that
[1:37:06] was her arms was iron bars he says now
[1:37:09] how perfectly this depicts the spirit of
[1:37:14] antichrist now this was the god of the
[1:37:16] Ephesus amen and and you know this is
[1:37:19] why brother uh uh uh Jesus would type uh
[1:37:23] uh the the first church age the Ephesus
[1:37:26] Church age see and so uh uh he said this
[1:37:30] depicts the spirit of antichrist loosed
[1:37:33] in the first age there he was loosed in
[1:37:37] the midst of the people and yet took no
[1:37:40] shape as to alarm the people see he just
[1:37:44] entered more as a spirit of anti yet the
[1:37:48] two arms of iron bar bars showed that it
[1:37:52] was his intent to crush the work of God
[1:37:57] as he made his inroads ain't that right
[1:38:01] so Satan's agenda is always to attempt
[1:38:04] his agenda is to crush the work of God
[1:38:08] do you believe that I I'll say it to you
[1:38:11] in a in maybe a personal thing way uh uh
[1:38:15] for us uh individually is anytime that
[1:38:18] you're fighting in your mind or you're
[1:38:20] going through trials or you're going
[1:38:22] through whatever and and you're feeling
[1:38:24] something but always judge that Spirit
[1:38:28] judge it whether it's trying to uh uh
[1:38:32] bring in a bitter bitterness in your
[1:38:34] soul whether it's trying to make you
[1:38:36] feel Unworthy of the Gospel whether it's
[1:38:39] what you know trying to bring unbelief
[1:38:42] or whatever it is Judge the spirit
[1:38:45] before you justify the spirit and allow
[1:38:48] it to take over then judge the spirit
[1:38:52] cuz you remember if it's it's the devil
[1:38:54] which we know that these things are
[1:38:56] anything that is contrary to the word of
[1:38:58] God is of the devil remember he's got an
[1:39:01] intent to crush that work of God in your
[1:39:05] life amen that's right can you say Amen
[1:39:10] how many preachers have given up because
[1:39:12] of
[1:39:14] discouragement true brother no longer
[1:39:16] preaching the gospel how many people no
[1:39:18] longer just believe anymore into this
[1:39:21] message simply because of this
[1:39:23] discouragement not not in the fact that
[1:39:25] they believe brother Brandon was a lie
[1:39:27] and all they just get discouragement
[1:39:28] they either got hurt or they done this
[1:39:30] or or or just something in their own
[1:39:32] life that they just give
[1:39:34] up amen see so so Satan wants to destroy
[1:39:39] and crush the work of God well that's
[1:39:41] what he has sought to do in in the ages
[1:39:43] to come see and he got his foothold in
[1:39:47] that first church age so we we find that
[1:39:51] he said now in the first church age no
[1:39:53] one seemed to notice him or what he was
[1:39:56] doing but one day they would notice when
[1:40:00] when with those arms of iron his deeds
[1:40:04] became Doctrine and his Doctrine became
[1:40:07] the law of an
[1:40:11] Empire can you say Amen see so then then
[1:40:15] we find now the church ages uh in the
[1:40:18] study of the church ages brother Bram
[1:40:20] dun it uh it deals with the history of
[1:40:22] the church
[1:40:24] but but when we speak of the church
[1:40:26] we're not re referring to only the pure
[1:40:30] bride of Jesus Christ or the pure elect
[1:40:34] amen see but the word church is
[1:40:38] referring to the entire body of people
[1:40:42] who called themselves Christian whether
[1:40:45] they be true or just merely
[1:40:49] nominal can you say Amen so the prophet
[1:40:52] said as all Israel is not Israel so all
[1:40:56] Christians are not Christians not
[1:40:59] everyone that nameth the name of the
[1:41:01] Lord is true uh uh true
[1:41:06] Christian can you say Amen so then we
[1:41:09] find that because Satan was able to get
[1:41:13] his foothold in the door we see and and
[1:41:16] plant that little seed amen his his seed
[1:41:20] then we see that two Vines begin to to
[1:41:24] to uh spring up down through the ageny
[1:41:27] the church then is made up of two
[1:41:31] Vines the church can you say Amen so
[1:41:34] when we say Church we're not just
[1:41:36] speaking of one body one group Church
[1:41:40] rep represents that there uh of of
[1:41:44] everyone that is calling themselves
[1:41:46] Christians whether they be true or false
[1:41:50] church can you say Amen see so the
[1:41:53] church is made up of two Vines the true
[1:41:55] and false and these two Vines are
[1:41:58] motivated by two kinds of spirits two
[1:42:02] different kinds see one one Vine one
[1:42:06] church or one group has the holy spirit
[1:42:09] amen which is the spirit of life that's
[1:42:12] what started on the day of Pentecost the
[1:42:15] other Vine amen that false Vine is is uh
[1:42:19] indued with the spirit of antichrist or
[1:42:23] the spirit of perverseness can you say
[1:42:25] Amen now notice both claim to know and
[1:42:28] be known of God both speak uh claim to
[1:42:31] speak for God both believe certain basic
[1:42:35] truths and differ on others both bear
[1:42:38] the name of the Lord being called
[1:42:41] Christians therefore both claim a
[1:42:44] relationship to
[1:42:46] him can you say Amen see and so
[1:42:50] therefore the prophet said because of
[1:42:52] this they're they're both uh uh uh uh
[1:42:55] claiming relationship to him when they
[1:42:58] say well I'm a Christian I'm see when
[1:43:00] you say I'm Christian and and everyone
[1:43:02] else I'm Christian I'm Christian they're
[1:43:04] claiming relationship to God they're not
[1:43:08] as though the a as the atheists out
[1:43:10] there that is saying there is no God
[1:43:12] they're actually claiming relationship
[1:43:14] to God and they're claiming to speak for
[1:43:18] God and because of this God calls it a
[1:43:22] marriage
[1:43:24] and now holds them
[1:43:27] both responsible to him and speaks to
[1:43:31] each throughout the church ages can you
[1:43:34] say Amen now notice uh through the
[1:43:37] Revelation that God has given to us in
[1:43:39] this day then we know that the Holy
[1:43:43] Spirit can fall upon the unregenerated
[1:43:46] false Vine Christians and manifest
[1:43:49] powerfully the prophet said in various
[1:43:52] signs and wonders even as Judas had a
[1:43:56] definite Ministry in the Holy Ghost
[1:43:59] though he himself was pronounced to be a
[1:44:04] devil ain't that right now this has
[1:44:07] happened and it continues to happen see
[1:44:11] both finds the Holy Ghost falling upon
[1:44:14] not only the true but also the The Falls
[1:44:17] but remember there's two different seeds
[1:44:20] one was planted by God and the other was
[1:44:23] planted by the
[1:44:24] Antichrist one has the life of God
[1:44:27] flowing through it and is vibrant
[1:44:29] quickened to the word and the other one
[1:44:32] amen has has uh uh uh uh been endued by
[1:44:37] the spirit of perversion that Antichrist
[1:44:39] Spirit can you say amen and and so then
[1:44:43] Jesus would tell us that these two Vines
[1:44:45] are to grow these the wheat and The Tear
[1:44:48] is to grow together remember they were
[1:44:50] planted in the same field Jesus said the
[1:44:52] Earth is the field this world is the
[1:44:55] field ain't that right amen and they're
[1:44:57] planted in the same field and they grow
[1:45:01] up
[1:45:03] together and both we can truly say now
[1:45:07] both have come to maturity both vins the
[1:45:12] false the true has come to maturity and
[1:45:16] are getting prepared for Harvest now
[1:45:20] we're we're living in the time of
[1:45:22] separation
[1:45:23] of these two
[1:45:25] Vines you know brother brandham was
[1:45:30] writing with an elderly couple to go
[1:45:33] pray for a
[1:45:35] child that was sick and when they got to
[1:45:38] the child the family didn't want him to
[1:45:39] pray they turned him away said no can
[1:45:42] you
[1:45:43] imagine afterwards the lady mentioned
[1:45:47] that the elderly lady said to brother
[1:45:49] brand she says you know I I think what
[1:45:51] ought to take place is that all the
[1:45:52] church churches ought to come together
[1:45:54] and be one all the churches and that's a
[1:45:58] nice idea all the churches come together
[1:46:00] and and they be one see and now notice
[1:46:04] what brother brandham says about that
[1:46:05] statement he said and that's exactly
[1:46:07] what the devil
[1:46:09] thinks but God wants a separation of his
[1:46:12] church from the things of the world he
[1:46:14] does not want it mixed up in church
[1:46:16] politics see so he says the lady was
[1:46:19] only thinking the thoughts of the whole
[1:46:21] world that's what the whole world world
[1:46:23] is is wanting that's the the church
[1:46:25] world everybody is wanting to come
[1:46:27] together for the most part is pushing
[1:46:29] for a a togetherness the church is p
[1:46:32] pushing for a togetherness ain't that
[1:46:35] right but see so he says see that's
[1:46:38] exactly what the devil thinks he said
[1:46:41] but God wants a separation of his church
[1:46:44] from the things of the world and and so
[1:46:47] uh uh everybody wants a messiah to bring
[1:46:51] everything together and this the prophet
[1:46:54] said is the reason or the purpose for
[1:46:57] the World Council of churches existing
[1:47:00] is to bring everything together now
[1:47:02] Church the count World Council of
[1:47:04] churches exists today how many believes
[1:47:06] that it's it's here and she's getting
[1:47:10] ready to take front and center stage yes
[1:47:14] sir I believe that with all my
[1:47:17] heart that's how close we're living in
[1:47:21] and and you say well how how do you do
[1:47:23] that how do you know this is is because
[1:47:25] we are living in the age of maturity
[1:47:28] where the True Vine is maturity as and
[1:47:31] coming into what God has has has desired
[1:47:35] it to be as manifestation of sons of God
[1:47:38] can you say Amen we're in the age of
[1:47:40] adoption we're saying we're in the age
[1:47:42] of adoption why because only a matured
[1:47:45] son can come into this
[1:47:50] adoption if the church is is coming in
[1:47:53] the true church then you know the false
[1:47:55] Vine is too so therefore now no notice
[1:47:58] brother brand would tell us it is in
[1:48:00] this
[1:48:02] age that the churches are going to come
[1:48:05] together and now notice and as they are
[1:48:10] even now everybody say they are even now
[1:48:14] they're right now controlling World
[1:48:18] politics right now you may not
[1:48:20] understand all that I don't I'm I don't
[1:48:22] know how all this stuff is working but
[1:48:25] you can be assured that a prophet says
[1:48:27] it I believe it they are controlling
[1:48:30] World
[1:48:33] politics he said see the churches are
[1:48:35] come going to come together and as they
[1:48:37] are even now controlling World politics
[1:48:41] they will soon control the finances of
[1:48:43] the world that's right then if you don't
[1:48:46] belong to the world organization of
[1:48:48] churches you won't be able to buy or
[1:48:49] sell see you will lose all those who
[1:48:52] stay stay true to God and keep their
[1:48:55] garments clean and the defilement of
[1:48:57] this world system of church orders or
[1:49:00] keep keep their garments clean from the
[1:49:03] defilement of this world system of
[1:49:05] church orders will be pH physically
[1:49:07] bereft see there will be presented to
[1:49:10] them a great temptation to give in
[1:49:13] Preachers will give in with the excuse
[1:49:16] that they will serve God within the
[1:49:17] framework of the of the Antichrist be
[1:49:20] system see they won't even know that
[1:49:22] it's the an Antichrist see they'll just
[1:49:24] see it as a better way to serve
[1:49:26] God and they will give in to the
[1:49:28] flatteries flatteries and blandishments
[1:49:31] of the hierarchy and the people will
[1:49:33] follow these false Shepherds right into
[1:49:36] the slaughter but in the Judgment they
[1:49:38] will all be found naked they will all
[1:49:41] they will not be given those white robes
[1:49:43] neither will they walk with him you
[1:49:45] can't walk with in the spotted garments
[1:49:47] of the world holding hands with the
[1:49:49] devil here and then expect to be with
[1:49:51] God it's time to wake up and hear the
[1:49:53] voice of God crying come out of her see
[1:49:56] what is that organized religion come out
[1:49:58] of that my people that you be not
[1:50:01] partakers of her sins that you receive
[1:50:04] not of her plagues amen God is speaking
[1:50:07] shun the religions of this world like
[1:50:10] you shun the plague leaving leave off
[1:50:13] walking with the world and make your
[1:50:15] garments WIP by repentance and the blood
[1:50:18] of the lamb and you say Amen see so
[1:50:22] there is an
[1:50:23] overcomer now Paul being that angel
[1:50:28] Messenger to the first church age he
[1:50:30] said this in 2 Thessalonians 2:7 for the
[1:50:33] mystery of iniquity doth already work so
[1:50:37] it was already working in Paul's day and
[1:50:40] and this is what he was trying to say
[1:50:43] these Grievous wolves that's the that's
[1:50:45] what was working the spirit of iniquity
[1:50:48] the mystery of iniquity does already
[1:50:50] work see and the prophet said this
[1:50:52] mystery of iniquity was Antichrist in
[1:50:56] his teaching because it was against
[1:50:59] Christ the
[1:51:01] word ain't that right so see and and and
[1:51:05] so then God rebukes the age that church
[1:51:09] age that first church age because it had
[1:51:12] left its first love again brother
[1:51:15] brandom uses another meaning for Ephesus
[1:51:18] which means let go relax
[1:51:20] backsliding see so this word I looked it
[1:51:23] up relax means to make less tense or
[1:51:26] rigid see we don't in this age here
[1:51:30] we're in the most uh age of people's
[1:51:32] rights and things that we want
[1:51:34] everything quick we do not want
[1:51:37] tension we we we want things easy we
[1:51:40] want life easy we we don't want
[1:51:42] struggles we you you understand well
[1:51:45] this is what was in that first church
[1:51:46] age in in just a little seed was that it
[1:51:49] let go it was relaxed it backslidden and
[1:51:52] so it it it in other words it it was
[1:51:56] less tense rigid it was slack slacking
[1:51:59] see to make less severe or stringent
[1:52:02] modified to become LAX weak or loose to
[1:52:05] rest and this is how the nianis took
[1:52:09] hold of the church ain't that right so
[1:52:13] the church became relaxed and backslid
[1:52:16] and entertain this idea of nianis now
[1:52:19] most of us know what that is and and we
[1:52:21] could get into do it later on but it
[1:52:24] allowed the spirit of antichrist to gain
[1:52:27] access and pervert what God had intended
[1:52:30] for the
[1:52:32] church now notice within three years of
[1:52:36] of the Christian Church of uh the
[1:52:40] Christians being scattered abroad the
[1:52:43] gospel had been taken uh to Rome by by
[1:52:48] two men and these men are named uh uh
[1:52:51] their men
[1:52:53] in Romans 16:7 and they were called
[1:52:57] Apostles and and so they started this
[1:52:59] church in Rome and for several years the
[1:53:02] work of God began to flourish and and uh
[1:53:07] and and and and these things and uh
[1:53:09] brother Bram says until the constant
[1:53:11] altercations of the Jews amongst
[1:53:14] themselves caus the imperior of that day
[1:53:17] to expel them from Rome so the the the
[1:53:21] the leaders of that church
[1:53:22] amen got to fighting amongst one another
[1:53:25] or whatever and and finally the imperior
[1:53:28] of Rome banished them from Rome and and
[1:53:31] so brother Bram said with that the Jews
[1:53:34] Elders being taken out banished then it
[1:53:39] it the backbone of that little church
[1:53:42] was practically broken see and this is
[1:53:46] exactly what Satan wanted to do uh uh
[1:53:49] and and therefore brother BR said the
[1:53:51] elders perhaps Jew je uh and and so
[1:53:54] would be gone as well and and so he says
[1:53:57] this left the little flock
[1:54:01] unintended and the word of God had not
[1:54:04] been written as a guide so therefore it
[1:54:09] it was very easy for the group to drift
[1:54:12] or inundated by the philosophers and
[1:54:16] pagans of that day that they had no
[1:54:19] leadership in the church they had no
[1:54:21] written word in among them so therefore
[1:54:24] that little group that little flock was
[1:54:27] was just sitting there like a little
[1:54:29] sheep you know left to the wolves and
[1:54:33] and they they were easily persuaded
[1:54:36] easily affected uh by these things and
[1:54:39] so brother Bram would tell us with
[1:54:42] Grievious wolves on the prow and the
[1:54:45] spirit of antichrist released into the
[1:54:48] church the age we find from history that
[1:54:51] this little church in Rome became
[1:54:53] hopelessly backslidden and began to
[1:54:57] introduce Pagan ceremonies under
[1:55:00] Christian
[1:55:01] titles now Church uh I I know this is
[1:55:05] church history and I I think it's
[1:55:07] important or brother Brandon wouldn't
[1:55:09] have gone through all of this uh uh with
[1:55:11] us but I I think that that we must not
[1:55:14] just let it be history amen but that
[1:55:17] same spirit that began to work on that
[1:55:20] church Works upon us the moment you
[1:55:23] isolate yourself from the body of
[1:55:24] Believers you you're leaving yourself
[1:55:28] vulnerable to Satan amen true that's why
[1:55:34] brother Bram says you know people say
[1:55:36] well you know I can stay home from
[1:55:38] church and and and and be the same he
[1:55:40] said no you can't you just can't you
[1:55:44] you're you're you're like that that
[1:55:46] little that little uh deer or whatever
[1:55:49] that gets away from the herd
[1:55:52] and and and then the enemy isolates you
[1:55:55] from that herd because you're now
[1:55:58] showing a weakness in you
[1:56:01] exactly can you say Amen well it's true
[1:56:05] and and we're finding more
[1:56:09] message more message people not
[1:56:12] believing seeing the importance of being
[1:56:14] with the
[1:56:16] body they want to be their own self they
[1:56:18] want to be their own way they every you
[1:56:20] know what I'll set it this way you're
[1:56:22] always going to find you you're always
[1:56:25] when you're when you're among Believers
[1:56:26] when you're among people period you're
[1:56:28] going to see the weak hinder parts of
[1:56:34] people
[1:56:36] hello and this is where you got to put
[1:56:39] up with
[1:56:41] people this is where the Bible says
[1:56:44] you've got to bear with one another's
[1:56:46] burdens you understand what I'm saying
[1:56:49] we ought to be thankful for one another
[1:56:51] I'm not saying you aren't but I am
[1:56:54] saying we ought to be
[1:56:56] thankful be more thankful for one
[1:56:58] another if you see someone weak you be
[1:57:02] there don't isolate them be there with
[1:57:05] them that's right help them you
[1:57:08] understand what I'm saying see so so
[1:57:10] we're we're not chickens that look at
[1:57:12] this sore spot on the other chicken and
[1:57:14] then we start pecking that chicken
[1:57:16] that's good brother you understand what
[1:57:17] I'm saying so so there there's a reason
[1:57:20] that God puts us with a body
[1:57:22] a body of
[1:57:24] Believers and and and you know good and
[1:57:26] well it's just like brother brandom says
[1:57:28] you know talking about the church there
[1:57:30] where he was at and in Jeffersonville
[1:57:33] and he said this is such a sweet church
[1:57:35] now you know and and love and da D D D D
[1:57:37] he says let me warn you right now Satan
[1:57:39] ain't going to let it stay that way
[1:57:41] ain't going to let it stay that way why
[1:57:43] because if he can ever get a foot in the
[1:57:45] door he's going to bring division he's
[1:57:48] going to bring uh all kinds of things
[1:57:51] amen and and and he says what it'll do
[1:57:54] he says if he can't get someone in the
[1:57:56] church he'll bring somebody in the
[1:57:58] church he'll bring them in Let Them Sit
[1:58:01] amongst you get acquainted with you you
[1:58:03] become friends you you start just
[1:58:06] whining in a dining you start you know
[1:58:08] become a buddy and then all of a sudden
[1:58:10] he shoots that guy with poison and
[1:58:12] before you know it he's gained influence
[1:58:14] in the
[1:58:15] church hello and maybe he start speaking
[1:58:18] against the pastor or he start speaking
[1:58:20] against the songl well I don't like the
[1:58:22] way they lead them songs and I don't
[1:58:23] like the way that they play that
[1:58:25] musician and or the the music or I don't
[1:58:28] I don't just like the way the pastor
[1:58:29] does this or I don't like the way they
[1:58:31] do this and all that and what it's doing
[1:58:33] he's starting something he's trying
[1:58:35] that's exactly what happened in the
[1:58:37] first church age and you had a people
[1:58:41] that got
[1:58:44] relaxed can you
[1:58:46] sayen so you you find these things and
[1:58:49] and so this is why I encourage you when
[1:58:52] when when you when you do you know when
[1:58:55] when you find an issue in the church
[1:58:56] just pray about it when someone starts
[1:58:59] bringing up issues to you about the
[1:59:01] church don't you give in to that and
[1:59:04] usually they always find the weaker one
[1:59:06] that is willing and maybe they not
[1:59:08] intentionally do that but the spirit
[1:59:10] that's on them we will will usually know
[1:59:13] who the weak one is in the
[1:59:17] church I remember they always tried to
[1:59:19] come to Dad Dad was the associate and
[1:59:22] they always you know different ones
[1:59:24] would try to come to Dad at the
[1:59:25] beginning and start talking about
[1:59:27] brother bur well brother bur you know oh
[1:59:29] we love him oh he's just a good guy but
[1:59:32] he just he you know and and and dad says
[1:59:35] well you know what I'm just you know I'm
[1:59:38] I'm I'm not I'm not siding with you at
[1:59:40] all he said you know uh God sent brother
[1:59:44] burst there and I'm just going to stand
[1:59:45] behind him that's just the way it is you
[1:59:47] know and you know and so one family you
[1:59:50] know they they had been you know giving
[1:59:53] dad this and giving Mom this and just
[1:59:55] kind of giving them a little gifts and
[1:59:56] stuff like that and you know and and and
[1:59:59] and and taking them out to eat and doing
[2:00:02] all kinds of stuff and and uh just kind
[2:00:05] of getting a little close to them and
[2:00:07] you know and and then all of a sudden
[2:00:08] they they come just running to the house
[2:00:10] you know uh banging on the door and
[2:00:12] they're just AB balling and squalling
[2:00:14] and and so Dad says what in the world's
[2:00:16] wrong and oh you know so you we got to
[2:00:19] talk to you you know so they begin to
[2:00:21] talk to him about brother burst you know
[2:00:22] brother burst this and brother burst
[2:00:24] done this and brother burst done that
[2:00:26] and and all that and dad says well I
[2:00:28] tell you what have you ever talked to
[2:00:29] him about it oh no no we ain't doing
[2:00:31] that he said well I tell you what let's
[2:00:32] get in my car and we'll all go over oh
[2:00:35] no we ain't doing that at all he said oh
[2:00:37] yes we are going to go do that he said
[2:00:39] I'll either ride with you or you ride
[2:00:40] with me but we're going to get this
[2:00:41] straightened out right now you know and
[2:00:44] and oh no we ain't doing that he said
[2:00:45] yes you are you're getting in that car
[2:00:47] we're all going so he got them in the
[2:00:49] car they all got over there and and and
[2:00:51] you know Dad says now brother bur you
[2:00:53] know says uh uh there there's some
[2:00:55] complaint here and I think we need to
[2:00:57] get this worked out you know well oh you
[2:01:00] know so he says now now tell them tell
[2:01:02] brother bur what you told me oh well you
[2:01:04] know it we probably OV exaggerated a
[2:01:07] little bit and you know and uh you know
[2:01:11] well they were ready to go they were in
[2:01:12] a hurry but see what it was is Dad
[2:01:14] wouldn't give that that Spirit a
[2:01:16] foothold in his home in his life and I
[2:01:19] thank God for that you understand what
[2:01:22] I'm saying and and so uh everybody's
[2:01:24] willing to to uh to lend an ear amen but
[2:01:27] see if you're not careful it's Satan
[2:01:30] trying to work in Amen to destroy a
[2:01:33] church well he'll do it with your home
[2:01:36] he'll do it between you and your spouse
[2:01:38] he'll do it he'll cause uh uh maybe the
[2:01:40] children to think uh something different
[2:01:43] and and uh uh uh from their parents and
[2:01:45] all of a sudden something starts rising
[2:01:47] up against their parent well what it is
[2:01:50] it's just a stinking Old Devil trying to
[2:01:52] break everything up well that Spirit
[2:01:55] started
[2:01:57] here and if you ain't got strong ones
[2:02:00] and strong elders and and to say no
[2:02:02] we're not going this way we're going to
[2:02:05] serve the Lord we're going to pray about
[2:02:08] these
[2:02:11] things but here they didn't have the
[2:02:14] elders because Satan made a way for them
[2:02:19] to cast them away from the church get
[2:02:22] him away to where now there's a little
[2:02:24] flock that is just left vulnerable to
[2:02:27] his devices and so we find that that he
[2:02:31] says brother Brown says with Grievous
[2:02:33] wolves on the prow and the spirit of
[2:02:36] antichrist released we find from history
[2:02:38] that this little church in Rome became
[2:02:41] hopelessly backslid and began to
[2:02:44] introduce Pagan ceremonies under
[2:02:46] Christian
[2:02:48] titles it was a period of 13 years in
[2:02:52] this finally 13 years later that uh uh
[2:02:57] the Jews were allowed to go back to the
[2:02:59] city of Rome and the two Apostles that
[2:03:01] started the church went back in in to
[2:03:05] see how the church was doing the little
[2:03:06] flock and all these and and and what
[2:03:10] they found what they discovered was this
[2:03:13] church was woefully
[2:03:16] Pagan and yet had Christian
[2:03:19] title brother Braham says there were
[2:03:21] altars in the church upon which they
[2:03:24] placed incense and celebrated Pagan
[2:03:27] rights the established leaders of that
[2:03:30] church could not be approached so with
[2:03:33] the few who had tried to remain faithful
[2:03:36] they started a new church or the second
[2:03:39] Church of Rome and God graciously worked
[2:03:42] amongst them by signs and wonders so
[2:03:44] that a third church was started and
[2:03:46] though the first church was reproached
[2:03:49] for being Pagan and not Christian in its
[2:03:52] worship it would not give up its title
[2:03:55] and remained and Still Remains The First
[2:03:58] Church of Rome think about ain't that
[2:04:02] right so so then we we find and I'm just
[2:04:05] giving history uh here the the first
[2:04:08] church had began to thrive and multiply
[2:04:11] so in numbers that the imperial and the
[2:04:14] various officials of the government
[2:04:17] actually favored favored that church for
[2:04:20] political reasons kind of like it is
[2:04:24] today so when the leaders of this church
[2:04:28] found themselves in in favor of of the
[2:04:31] political world then they took
[2:04:34] opportunity to turn the government
[2:04:36] against the True
[2:04:38] Believers hello and they demanded their
[2:04:41] persecution of the Believers True
[2:04:44] Believers unless they came into their
[2:04:46] fold so now it become a force of re of
[2:04:50] religion so there therefore when
[2:04:52] polycarp heard about what happened to
[2:04:54] the first church of of Rome uh and and
[2:04:58] that they were involved in Pagan
[2:05:00] ceremonies and had corrupted the truth
[2:05:02] of the Gospel then he went in there to
[2:05:05] to implore them to to try to persuade
[2:05:09] them to change back and and when he got
[2:05:12] there he saw them prostrate uh
[2:05:14] themselves before images named after the
[2:05:17] apostles and Saints and he saw them like
[2:05:19] candles and burnt incense on the he saw
[2:05:22] them celebrate the Passover under the
[2:05:24] name of Easter where they elevated the
[2:05:26] dis shaped bread that honored the son
[2:05:29] God and then they poured out the wine
[2:05:31] out as a uh Li libation uh to the gods
[2:05:36] so then polycarp couldn't persuade them
[2:05:39] of their ways and history says that as
[2:05:41] he was leaving the Lord spoke through
[2:05:44] him saying Ephraim is married to his
[2:05:46] idols let him alone and polycarp never
[2:05:49] returned to that first church
[2:05:52] so so then we find the history of a
[2:05:55] church being started by the Antichrist
[2:05:59] Spirit how it become perverted and
[2:06:02] through that perversion and and I know
[2:06:05] we've we've we were we're uh uh winding
[2:06:08] up in time here but through this
[2:06:11] perversion amen uh uh this church has
[2:06:15] become larger and larger and we find
[2:06:19] that in the third thir Church age that
[2:06:23] church became married to State and and
[2:06:29] uh uh the church and state become
[2:06:31] married religious powers and state
[2:06:35] Powers Government powers became one
[2:06:38] became United and that was the the
[2:06:42] finally where the first the Catholic
[2:06:46] church was
[2:06:48] born but it all come through perversion
[2:06:51] and we'll we'll find out as we go that
[2:06:55] that you you'll find where these
[2:06:57] denominations and why we we we talk
[2:07:00] against not not people in the
[2:07:03] denominations but we talk about that
[2:07:06] organization of of what they are can you
[2:07:09] say
[2:07:10] amen and and so but in every
[2:07:14] age you you'll find that the the True
[2:07:17] Believers have withstood this and and
[2:07:21] and even when it come into I think it
[2:07:24] was the Dark Age brother brandham said
[2:07:26] there was less
[2:07:27] Christianity of the True Believer than
[2:07:30] even today he said it it it had come to
[2:07:33] such a few number of Christians because
[2:07:37] that Antichrist Spirit set War upon the
[2:07:40] True
[2:07:41] Believers now church that Antichrist
[2:07:44] Spirit it set War to the Believers it
[2:07:47] determined uh uh to toward the the
[2:07:50] Believers and and it become a physical
[2:07:53] thing to where it entered into the Dark
[2:07:56] Ages and how how many 66
[2:08:00] million 68 million True Believers were
[2:08:05] slaughtered by an antichrist spirit that
[2:08:08] began to work in the first church
[2:08:11] age now we're looking and we've come
[2:08:15] brother brand said now we've had greater
[2:08:18] greater times of
[2:08:19] persecution like the dark ages and all
[2:08:22] that but never a time of great deception
[2:08:27] like we are in this
[2:08:28] age can you say amen amen how did the
[2:08:33] how did the the Believers in the age
[2:08:37] ages overcome because in every age
[2:08:39] there's been an overcomer is they stayed
[2:08:42] with what they knew amen and the spirit
[2:08:45] of God as as we know as as as Satan rode
[2:08:49] so did the spirit of God rise
[2:08:52] Amen to combat that Spirit can you say
[2:08:55] Amen now church that's the only way
[2:08:57] we're going to overcome in this age is
[2:08:59] stay with the word of God stay with the
[2:09:02] word of God now if they could overcome
[2:09:04] with just a little light just a little
[2:09:06] bit in their their age how much more can
[2:09:09] we overcome with the revealed word of
[2:09:11] God don't take this message for granted
[2:09:15] it's your Lifeline it's your Source can
[2:09:18] you say amen I have told you and and I'm
[2:09:21] I'm to close and we'll we'll we'll
[2:09:23] continue on another time uh but but I
[2:09:27] have told you you know uh and we were
[2:09:29] talking about last night but you know in
[2:09:31] my mind you know uh uh I you know you
[2:09:35] you want because we talk about adoption
[2:09:37] how the son comes into that adoption and
[2:09:40] and there's a time that he does that and
[2:09:42] you know in my mind I've wondered well
[2:09:44] when does that come and I've actually
[2:09:45] had people ask me well when when do we
[2:09:47] come to this adoption when do we know
[2:09:50] well you know and and and so you know
[2:09:53] there was a little just a bit I I didn't
[2:09:55] know what to say but but one day it just
[2:09:58] come to me don't worry about all that
[2:10:00] that's right just simply believe the
[2:10:03] word just simply live by this word
[2:10:07] simply so believe it till you speak the
[2:10:10] word no matter what situation you're in
[2:10:14] don't confess what a doctor says confess
[2:10:16] what the word says don't confess what
[2:10:19] everybody is saying say what the word
[2:10:21] word says can you say Amen don't take
[2:10:24] the thought of the world take the
[2:10:26] thought of God and overcome by it can
[2:10:31] you say Amen do you love the Lord amen
[2:10:34] if the musicians will come I love the
[2:10:37] Lord so we find that we're we're we're
[2:10:40] living in an age of perversion it's a
[2:10:43] perverse age and we see how it began to
[2:10:46] start in in that church age all the way
[2:10:49] down to where it is growing
[2:10:52] to where
[2:10:54] everything that we that the church once
[2:10:57] stood for is so
[2:11:01] perverse can you say
[2:11:04] Amen to where even that it would even
[2:11:07] get us if Satan could to start getting
[2:11:10] us to question the
[2:11:12] message as to what brother bradam said
[2:11:14] about
[2:11:16] things well did he really mean it well
[2:11:19] that was just because he was living in
[2:11:20] that time
[2:11:22] but see it's the spirit of perversion
[2:11:24] that has swayed the whole
[2:11:28] world to turn to something that a
[2:11:31] prophet told us not to do you understand
[2:11:34] what I'm
[2:11:37] saying if you stand with this message
[2:11:39] you don't have to worry about going
[2:11:42] chaotic because God would never leave
[2:11:44] you lead you to go somewhere way off the
[2:11:47] beaten path as long as you stay with the
[2:11:50] word now you'll be be you'll be off the
[2:11:53] beaten path with the
[2:11:55] world it'll make you different it'll
[2:11:58] it'll it they'll think you're crazy but
[2:12:01] isn't every person that's walked with
[2:12:03] God considered crazy not that we tried
[2:12:06] to act crazy not that we tried to to to
[2:12:10] be some odd individual it's just simply
[2:12:12] when you believe the word of God see
[2:12:14] you're standing you're standing in the
[2:12:17] midst of a perverse generation
[2:12:21] a perverse Nation a perverse
[2:12:24] world can you say
[2:12:26] Amen now stand holding the word of
[2:12:30] Truth aren't you glad for
[2:12:33] truth oh my I I I remember I remember
[2:12:38] you know being in the Pentecostal in
[2:12:40] that time of the Pentecostal and that's
[2:12:43] what we grew up in
[2:12:45] and there are so many things questions
[2:12:48] that I had
[2:12:50] personally you know that I didn't know I
[2:12:53] I just didn't understand things I you
[2:12:55] know I was telling my wife you know
[2:12:57] yesterday just of how that you know I
[2:13:00] remember you know
[2:13:01] just some brother Greg fry had come to
[2:13:05] me uh we were standing outside of her
[2:13:08] home and he was there visiting me he
[2:13:10] said brother Sean can you explain
[2:13:13] [Music]
[2:13:15] predestination I said no I I can't I was
[2:13:18] a young young man
[2:13:21] I don't know how old
[2:13:23] 20 I said I'm sorry I can't I felt so
[2:13:26] ashamed that I could not explain
[2:13:29] predestination because we didn't
[2:13:32] [Music]
[2:13:34] know and you know you just had questions
[2:13:37] like that of what what's right you you
[2:13:40] just saw a lot of things in the
[2:13:42] Pentecostal things that took place and
[2:13:44] you just wondered what what's right
[2:13:46] what's true what's and left you mixed
[2:13:50] up I remember when I come into this
[2:13:52] message I you know as I was reliving it
[2:13:55] yesterday
[2:13:57] I just that
[2:13:59] burning in my soul
[2:14:02] again I you know I I don't know how we
[2:14:05] started getting tapes but we didn't have
[2:14:08] computer for Terry you remember in times
[2:14:11] I'm sure all of y'all do most of you we
[2:14:14] didn't have computers we didn't have
[2:14:16] cell phones that had the app table apps
[2:14:19] we didn't have nothing
[2:14:21] I don't even know how I got the address
[2:14:23] to voice of God but I remember sending a
[2:14:27] letter to them or calling them and
[2:14:30] asking you know to get on their mailing
[2:14:32] list and I remember the first box of
[2:14:35] tapes I got 15 tapes they would give
[2:14:39] you and and you'd listen to them pay
[2:14:42] them off and then they'd send you
[2:14:43] another
[2:14:44] 15 man we were
[2:14:47] [Music]
[2:14:48] excited I just I was so excited I
[2:14:51] couldn't wait man when we ordered them
[2:14:54] tapes I just couldn't wait for them to
[2:14:55] come to the mail you know man we'd sit
[2:14:58] and listened to them here what a prophet
[2:15:00] had say didn't understand most of what
[2:15:02] he was saying but I was
[2:15:05] excited something just happened I knew
[2:15:08] it was
[2:15:09] right so I remember you know uh listen I
[2:15:15] think it was lifting God out of history
[2:15:18] and I'd went to back to visit our former
[2:15:21] church I was in py with Wendell at the
[2:15:24] time but they had a a meeting or
[2:15:26] something so we had went and uh just a a
[2:15:31] a man you know that that I knew when I
[2:15:34] was growing up we just got to talking I
[2:15:37] said man brother
[2:15:38] Joel I said have you ever listened to
[2:15:41] brother Brandon no oh you got to listen
[2:15:43] to him I said I've just been listening
[2:15:45] to this you know God lifting God out of
[2:15:46] history and I was trying to explain to
[2:15:48] him I still didn't understand and you
[2:15:50] know he was happy cuz I was happy but I
[2:15:52] don't think I was getting it clicking to
[2:15:54] him what I was really trying to get to
[2:15:56] but I just knew that this message was
[2:16:00] right then my pastor you know he come to
