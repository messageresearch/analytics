is the head of which is the head of all principality and Power in whom also ye in whom also ye are circumcised with a circumcision made without hands and putting off and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ Buried buried with him in baptism wherein also Ye Ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you having forgiven you all all all all all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out out of the way and nailed naing it nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it let's all bow our heads our dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you and Lord how thankful we are father to be in your presence once again Lord Lord we ask you father just to come down lord this this this this evening Lord and just move in such a mighty special way father Lord I ask you to help me to lay myself aside Lord just speak through me father and touch your people we pray we love you and thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen y'all can have your seats y'all is going to have to forgive me I'm trying an ear mic for the first time so it feels a little bit awkward for me so y'all uh have to help me get get get through it um in uh uh Philippians chapter 2 verse 5-7 it says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no of of of and made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a serpent and was made in the likeness of men we look back in the Old Testament we find that out that um throughout the Old Testament um uh God the the the the prophets of old had always wanted to see God um and we see that God that God would would would reveal himself to the prophets um but but but not but not but not in in in in his in his in his fullness and Moses Moses seen him in the pillar of fire and he seen him in as the back of a man as he walked by and job job would see him in the Whirlwind and and all these different prophets would see him but but yet in but yet God could never see are our man could never see God God God in in his revealed in his revealed fullness they Their Eyes Were veiled were veiled were veiled were veiled to it but but but yet but yet uh but but but but yet but yet he would always but yet he would always re re re re reveal himself in his way and and in his time and Jesus and Jesus thanked the father he said he said he that he had hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and and would reveal it unto babes such such as as as as would learn so we find that God that God that God that God in his nature never changes from from age to age it's always has has has remained the same God's nature has has always has always stayed exactly the same and and Malachi 3 he says he says he says I am God and I change not so so he works in the same principles in the same way in the same way in the same way throughout time and but but but but but but but but but yet um brother bandom said said said that and and he was talking of Jesus said said he could not have come he could not have come with with with with Moses's message because because it it would it wouldn't have worked Moses was God Moses was God in a portion made manifest he was the word expressed for that hour but Jesus could not could not could not come in that but the the Bible said the Bible say never said never said he would come he would come in in that way but but but but but when he come when he come Express exactly exactly the the the way the Testament had said that that that he would be expressed then all those then all those who was redeemable believed it because because because because they because they were the thoughts of God the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was brought back to God and and the Bible says as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God because they were redeemable they they were from the beginning in the expression and and he says and he says and he says if we could stop here a moment if it would be possible and think that tonight of the message of the hour the expressed thoughts of Jehovah before the foundation of the world we are told our names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life so we are we are the literal expressed thoughts of God we are the bride of Christ we are his literally his expressed thoughts made manifest in these last days we we have become we so and so we are the fullness of God that has been unveiled in these last days um um um you look at look you look at at Luther and and and in his time he had he had a portion of it and John Wesley he had a portion of it in the the Pentecostal that that that they they they they they they had a portion of it um ausa Street had had a portion of the Holy Ghost and Pentecostals they they had a portion of of of of of of the Holy Ghost but we as the bride of Christ Christ Christ today can stand here and the full manifestation and and the full expression of what God's of what God had in the back of his mind mind since the since before the world was ever formed we can now stand here here here as the fully manifested son and daughter of God why and um um and and and you look at at at at at John the Baptist he he he was the voice of of of the of one crying in the wilderness he he tried to tell them that that that and but yet he was also he was also Mal Mal Malachi Malachi 3 where where where it said behold I send my messenger from from from before my my my face prepare prepare the way before the people brother bam said said that said said said said that John the Baptist he he said he was that Living Word a and and and and the true and the and and the true born again again again Church Church of the of the Living God in in this hour and and and in this day is the living is the living is the Living Word of God of of God in these last days it we are we have been been we have been made we have been made made made manifested fested and so so if we if you search the scriptures and look out and look and look and look and look throughout history we we we we can see what's supposed to be in these last days in these last age and in this leoty and age we see that the world that's falling apart and and we see Satan he's on the Rampage everywhere but yet but but but yet through it all there's a bride and she standing forth as the expressed image of God there's Christ Living again and and and he's just just changed his M from from one form on onto the other and all that God was he has poured into Christ and all that Christ was he has poured into his his his his his his his his church and and while standing on on on that rock Moses Moses he he was standing there he he said Lord I want to see you and and and God told him he he said stand on the rock over there when he stood there stood there stood there he he saw the back part of a man walk walk by but but but but but but but yet but but but yet that wasn't God he himself he he it was a it was a veil of God as brother random said it the the Bible said no man no man hath seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father hath declared him so so so so so Moses saw him veiled as a man man man man and we find that and we find that that that Jehovah that Jehovah of the Old Testament was Jesus Christ of the New Testament and and his brother B has has has has taught us it's the changing it's the changing it's the changing from form to form it it's called it's called that inm morpha and and and what the what that what that what that what that word inm morpha means it means it's the Unseen was made visible and and and something that that that that that that that that that as brother Ram said that we know what's there but but but we just can't can't but but we just can't can't see it but but but but yet all the time all the time we we we we we know it's there but but yet but yet but yet when when God came down and lifted that Veil it was that it was that it was that it was that it was that imor and and and he changed that that that that that that that form now and then and then there we' seen Jesus Christ standing there when all throughout all throughout the history the prophet had longed to see him men and women of throughout the Bible had longed to see Christ but but but but but yet God came and changed changed he his Veil and and he stood there as the expressed image of God In the Flesh it was in morphy the Unseen was made visible why and and all he did was was was was he just changed his mask and and in other words in other words like they do in those plays where where where where where um um in those school plays or something where where one guy might play five five five parts it's the same man but he's going behind the veil and he's changing his mask and coming back out as a as a as a different person and and that's and that's exactly what God did it's the same God all the time he has not he has not changed he's the same man he's the are are the same God God God he's the same God since the beginning of time but he he was in the of the father he was he was in the form he he was in the form of the pillar of fire and he was he was in the he was in the he he was in the form of Christ but it's the same God but but but God has just changed his mask and uh I I'm laying a foundation here so so you guys will just have to bear with me for a little bit but but but but but but just like an artist he'll He he'll he'll sit there and Veil his painting and and nobody can can see it you can't see it they or or or sculpture where where where they're they might see a vague form of something but it's but it's being shaped and it's being molded but but yet nobody knows nobody knows what this thing what this thing what this thing looks like until the day until the day o o of the revealing where where that where that sculpture can step back and take the Veil Down and they see the Masterpiece that's laid before them right so so so it's it's it it's it's it's been it's it the mask has has been has been has been has been removed from the people's eyes and then now had the full revelation of of of of what the master builder Builder has been doing has been doing for years and years and years why why it's and brother bam say said said said said that he was God in morphe master in the pillar of fire god in morphe and a man called called called and a man called called Jesus God in and morphe in his church God above us God With Us God in us the condescending of God he he said he said he said he said up there no um up there talking about the mountain he he said nothing could could could ever touch it and even if an animal touched the mountain it had to die but then God came down and changed his tent and come down and and and and lived with us became became one of us and we and we and we held him the um the Bible says in 1 Timothy 3:16 it it says it say it says it says without without without controversy great is the mystery is the mystery of of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh handled with hands God eat meat God drank water God slept God cried he was one of us he's a beautiful typed in the Bible he's he said he he said that was God above us God God he he said that was God above us God With Us now it's God in us the Holy Spirit not the third person but the same spirit is now in The Bride of Jesus Christ but but but but but but but but yet but yet but yet um we can look around around today and and we see that to most of the world it's still veiled it it it's it's it's the the um unbeliever cannot see it it's it's it's it's the no matter no no matter no matter no matter no matter what what we do it seems like sometimes you can take them right up there up there too I was talking to to one of my co-workers the other day he he's a southern baptist I was talking to him about the message and he kind of looked at me with this with this like like like like you're dumb you know because but but but but but see to his eyes it's bailed he cannot see it no matter what I do to show him I'll show him in the scripture he cannot he cannot he cannot see see it but but but but but it's not it's not for the unbeliever it's for the believer only it's it's it's it's it's but but God always veils himself from the unbel on on on on on on to from the on on on we we we we find that um um Traditions will hide it and and and people denomination ideas idea ideas ideas will will will will will will will hide it and all these all these isms of the world of the world will will will hide it but not but to the bride of Christ it it has been unveiled and now and now she's standing there and all and all the glory of of of God she's standing there as as an unveiled Masterpiece in these last days Lord where where brother brandom said said said said said said that that was a spiritual ve of the spiritual that was a spiritual Veil that we have now where the natural where the natural where the natural veil was they are Vindicated by the prophet with the written word a prophet one who comes with the written word to make it plain he he he said he said he said he said they know they know the word was there but but they didn't know what it meant and Moses made it plain he said he he he say he he said the Commandment says this and this is why he made it plain and before it was made plain it was veiled and so it is and so it is is is today veiled to to the people until it's revealed and made plain to the people God the Mighty God veiled in human flesh the word notice now we find out that it was hid to the unbeliever but it was revealed to the believer amen so now we have the literal Life of Christ Living and and the bride all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was is now living and and breathing in the bride and and and and and that same mind that same mind that that that that was in in in in in God and and and was was was was was poured into Christ and and and and and and that spirit that that he that the spirit of God had Led Led Led Christ Led Led Christ throughout throughout out out out out his his time there there there he said he said I can do nothing unless the father first first first shows me and and and yet weak as the bride of Christ can can can can is is standing here on this Earth Earth Earth Earth on this Earth today knowing that that that same spirit that led Christ around is now leading us around around around around so and was that God all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured it he poured he poured in and and into the church this is brother Brandon he says so that the church has the power that Christ had Christ had the power that God that God that go that God had he said at that day you will know that I am in the father and the father and me and I and you and you and me you'll find out that God dwells in his church in his people it's the mind of Christ the human being has the privilege to enter in and know the mind of Christ he said hallelujah what a reality what a what a a a a reality a reality to to dwell in the channel of Christ we unworthy Mortals have been brought have been brought in have been brought in to be Sons and Daughters of God to to be fellow to be fellow to be fellow citizens in in his kingdom brother bandam said said said in in in another place place he said then the real Seed of Abraham believes the promise just like just like what what what what just like what Abraham did because it's it because it's to Abraham and his seed at and to his seed after him now now watch what God did to the Royal seed to make the Covenant to make the Covenant con con confirmed he took Christ which was the Seed of Abraham on Calvary tore him apart he took the spear off of him and put his body in in the grave and his soul and his soul in in hell and raised him up on the third day and raised up his body and brought it up up in in and brought it up in in in in to glory and there sent the spirit back down and kept the body on his right side he SP he sent the spirit back down down down down to live in the church to make a church just so much with the Life of Christ that in the Resurrection the two will come together the bride and bridegroom the church in Christ will be exactly alike with the same kind of kind with the same kind kind of ministry the same kind of power with the same kind kind of spirit he raised up the body of Jesus Christ and set him and set and set on his right side his right hand and poured the spirit down upon the church and on the day of poured his Spirit down upon the church on the day of of of of Pentecost and that's how God proved his Covenant with his church so so so so now we notice a a a hidden life and and and and and and God and God and God told Moses he said said make him a pot and he said and he said and he said take this pot and you fill it full of mana and and whenever that high priest would would walk in there year after year he could just he could sit there and eat on that golden out of that golden pot of Mana it never went bad no no matter no matter if it was a thousand years a million years a billion years that golden po Amanda was always full and and it was always fresh and and and and and and it was always fresh and new and and just as good as as as as good and and any man that come that has come that has come to Christ and has been filled with the Holy Ghost and has been hid away in that Veil that that that the church cannot can or or not the church but well the world well the natural church that the natural Church the world cannot cannot see cannot see beyond that bill but but but but we as as Christians as the bride of Christ can can steep in in that Veil and we can eat and and and any time of anything of anything of anything that we that that that that we ever ever need of we if if if if we're feeling sick we can reach in there and grab a bite and grab a bite out of that pot if we're needing Deliverance or something we can reach in there and grab a bite of the out of that out of that out of out of that out of that man man and anything that we have we have need of we just reach down there pick us up a big old a big go all all all all all all all handful of it and we just and we can eat away until our soul is satisfied why because because we have been hid away in Christ we have now come into the holiest of holies and we're hid away the world cannot see us the world does not does not does not understand us no matter what we go through day in and day out why be because we are HID away in in in in in in in Christ and that golden po of man is just sitting there for us to partake of and and and and and remember now nobody that nobody nobody that that that was unworthy was allowed was allowed beyond that Veil if you steep if you stepped if you stepped stepped if you stepped if you stepped beyond that bail Veil Veil and and you wasn't worthy you were struck dead dead dead dead in instantly only only only only the elect only the bride of Christ had has has stepped beyond that that that that that veil in Revelations it it says it's it's the he that ha that hath that hath that hath overcome so it's promised to us as as as Overcomers brother bam said said said said said said said um um um I overcome smoking and he said he said but that's not what he's talking about there's a whole lot more that go that goes to um Christianity besides besides not smoking not smoking cigares or drinking whiskey it says he that overcometh shall inherit all things and he will be my son I will be his God and listen I will give him of the head of of that hidden Mana he said he said I will hide them away and I will give them the hidden things the hidden things the world on the outside of the curtain don't know nothing about it Hallelujah though they eat though though they eat that that Mana they don't know nothing about this he said I will give give to him the hidden Mana I will give give him a stone with his name on on it you you get you get you get you get you get what I mean entering into the adoption or the hidden place with God and and in Ephesians Ephesians chapter 1 verses 3-5 it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in in Heavenly places in in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him him him him in in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so so so so so and look at the at the quote above again he says I will give him a stone with his name on it he said entering into the adoption or the hidden place with God and and it says as a a as he ha chosen us we of all the people people people people people people in in the world he he he could have chosen anybody else but he has chosen us to to to

of God and ask anything ask ask anything in in in in his name and it will be given given us it doesn't matter what the what the need is we we can we can come boldly boldly Before the Throne why because he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that this this world will never get it they they will never they will never they will never um um they will never understand but yet we but yet we can stand boldly be before before before be be be be before the throne and ask anything in his name brother bam said said said said said the Chinese the the Chinese Laundry men would take a tag and would tear it a certain way and you take one one and you take one part of the tag and and he would take he would take he would take the other part but but but but but when but when you come back and when when you come back to to claim to claim your your belongings those two pieces of paper had to dovetail and if they didn't dovetail just exactly right you you could not impersonate it in any way cuz he had one piece and and you had had had had had the other and if it was impersonated then you had a right to claim what was yours and then you've got what belonged to you when you possess the other part of the contract so it is it is today when when we go when we got the other the the other the other the other part of the contract when God tore his son son into our Calvary taking up the body for a sacrifice and he sent the spirit down down down he sent the spirit down down to us that once lived in a man Jesus that same God is in Veil tonight in the form of the Holy Ghost and those two pieces had come together then you're part of the contract God did this to be better known did this to be better better known better known to be better known to man when he made himself man man so so so so we can stand here and and no matter what we have no matter what we have have need of we can stand there with all boldness and all and in all confidence knowing we have the other part of the contract give me what's mine and and and brother brandom and brother brandom had had said that healing is the children's bread and if healing is the children's bread then so is Deliverance tonight and and and if Deliverance is the children's bread then then so is the Holy Ghost and no matter what we have need of we can come boldly Before the Throne of God with your ticket with your ticket and say this is M give me my Mountain no my if ye say on onto this mountain be thou removed and cast in the sea you can doubt not and claim it why because it's our promise God had made a promise when when when God told told told told told when God told when God told Abraham what what what what what what what when God told Abraham what what he he he would do do he he he he he he he he he took this soath and he swore by himself because there was no no no one one one one there was no one greater so God literally swore by himself and and he made a promise he made an unconditional Covenant to the supernatural Seed of Abraham and and and and all that was in and and in that pillar pillar of fire fire of fire wasn't was in was in was in Christ Christ CH Christ was in Christ Jesus for for and brother Rand says said the the Bible said that God emptied he said he said he said he said you know what what you do what you do when you empty anything he emptied himself in into Christ just think God emptied himself in himself just think God emptied himself in into Christ and Christ thought it not robbery to be equal with God for he was God and and and that's the thing that that that that that that's the thing that that they killed him for for for for breaking for breaking the Sabbath day and making himself God and he was Lord of the Sabbath and he was God Emanuel God in Christ reconciling the world the world the world the world the world the world to himself now and everything that God was he emptied it he emptied into Christ and everything Christ was he emptied in in in in in into to the church so you don't see so don't you see how how Christ regardless of of of of what the of what the Theologian said he believed the father is that right they said he's crazy he's he he he's be above he's the devil and and he said and he he said you can get by with that now but when the Holy Ghost comes don't you try it for Christ believed the father regardless of what the teacher said he believed the father is that right for God had emptied himself himself himself himself in himself into Christ and deity was in Christ he said Woo I hope you get it and then what Christ was he emptied into that in he emptied in in into the into the into the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost believer so no matter what so no matter what what a a no matter what anybody says he believed God's word see see he has to for all that Christ was all God was all that God was was in Christ all that Christ is is in you the believer Christ can't say say Christ cannot say something and stand around and and deny it he can't take his his his his his his his word back he he he he said he he's got to stick with what he says oh he's God and the infallible and he's got to stay with what he says we have the Eternal thoughts of God now that's it's now been revealed to to the bride of Christ through the prophets and and these last days brother bam said said he said said said so God in the beginning was life was life the Eternal one in him in him was was was attributes and those attributes became words and those words are and word and and the the word became flesh Jesus was the Redeemer and to redeem means to bring back and if he has to bring it back it has to be somewhere to be brought back to he said so you see all people will never will never be able to see it because all people wasn't in the beginning of God's thoughts see he said he he said I'm an heir of all things amen it's given it's given me I'm an heir I can claim everything that God that God promised me amen there you are it's mine how do you get it something something that that you've done no sir it's the unmar gift that God that God that that that it's unmerited gift that God gave us and it's ours it belongs to a Satan cannot cannot cannot hold it if you go to him in the super in the scriptural authorative word with faith to say it's mine lay it down amen glory I like that he said Satan you lay it down you took it from me you give it back because I'm serving notice notice I've got the notice written right here on on on the word heavens and earth will pass away but this notice shall not pass away so I come to you with this notice to serve on you that Jesus Christ said whatsoever I ask the father in his name he will give it give it me me me and if I say if I say onto this mountain be moved and don't doubt and don't doubt and but believe what he said he said I it sh it it shall come to pass I can have what I can have what I say lay it down that gets him started don't get him he he he said he he said he said it doesn't get him started it gets him running he he said lay it down because I have come with the scriptural Authority I am a believer you get it yes sir and so so we as the bride of Christ we can sit there and say I am claiming I'm claiming what's mine I have the other half I have the other half the other half the other half half of this of of of this of this of this con of this contract we can stand in faith in in faith in faith without without without wavering on one on on One Promise of God we we can stand here like like like like like like like Abra Abraham did and and say knowing that he is faithful and just and and just to to fulfill all that that he has has has has promised now we we notice we have you talk about faith faith in our car now now we notice our faith is like getting out and starting our car unless you have a truck like mine that only starts half the time um but but we can get in there and and and most of us I you know probably everybody but but here or but but me here tonight can't we we'll we'll just walk out there out there out there out there to our truck or our car whatever it is and start it up and everything think twice about it it'll get us from point A to point B and and you go to your groceries you come back home you never even think about it why because because we have faith faith in our car knowing that it will get us from point A to point B if unless me and I sat Lord please let this start today I want to go to work you know but it's what I get for for for buying a truck with half a million miles on it I guess but but but but but now we notice we it faith is like that we can get it we we can just walk out through our truck unlock it started up and drive to work and Fa and faith is the victory that overcome that overcomes the world the the whole the the whole entire world not just part of it the whole thing why why why why why um um so so and when yet when we have the written word of God laying right right right right here here before us and the the Holy Spirit has Vindicated himself time and time again and shown knowing that the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ is still is still in the bride is is still is still in the bride um I'm performing signs and and and wonders and and and and and healings all the all the divine all the Divine Promises of God are here and he and he's proved himself faithful time and time and time again we don't ever have to walk out there and say Lord I hope this thing's going to work this time I I I hope I I hope I I I'm going to get get get healed no you just you just start it up and drive off with it you don't ever have have to sit there and worry about it say say Lord is it going to start this time I don't know I I should hope it works or or it's like a checkbook you said and write a check out and if if me you don't know if that check's going to bounce bounce today or not it may work and it may not but but yet but yet as the Bride of Jesus Christ we can take that checkbook of gods that from the from from from from the from the from the infath riches of of of of Heaven from God's from from God's never from God's bottomless Bank vaults we can sit there and write anything out out and whatsoever we have need of we feel that check out and confidently take it take it to walk in the bank and say I shall have my deliverance and and you just sign it out and cash it and it's deposited right then and there you don't ever and keep and keep checking and saying Lord is this going to bounce this time I don't know I sure hope it works but but but yet but yet all you have to do is fill out anything anything in God's word you can sit there and and and fill that and and fill that thing out and sign your name to it and and deposit it why because it is it it is the bottomless it is it is in the infallable um um Bank bank account account account account bank account account of of of of Heaven why why why it is the we it is impossible to to to to bankrupt or Dr Heaven it's like a little fish he's swimming around the ocean Lord I I better drink sparingly of the other this water no sir as as a little as as a little as a little fish is just swimming around the ocean he'll he'll drink in and spit it out and drink it and gurgle it and do whatever he wants to do why because it is a it is a it is an unlimited resource and when but And yet when we as the bride of Christ Christ whatever we have need of if we need a Deliverance if we need a healing if we have financial problems if we got truck problems we can sit there and take it to the bank and say Lord you said whatsoever I have have have have have have have have have need of and take it to to the bank and start that truck up and drive off with it why because God has promised he is faithful and just and just brother bam said said said said that now faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it what does it do what is Faith what is to conquer to conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prison it means that the sin that once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it you've whooped it you are greater than than than you are greater than than than than you are greater than than than than it is oh I feel religious religious religious right right right about now and faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil faith is the victory faith in what not not not not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who ha made the promise that's the victory what is it if the victory say my arm is still crippled but faith is is the victory I still feel sick but faith is the victory oh it overcomes the world when and he says when you when you climb when you can clb when you can climb into God into God into God by prayer until you see the thing conquered conquer conquered conquered underneath you you there is nothing that that that can hurt you then you've overcome it you've got 50 miles of Elbow Room you're selling free then you who have been a drunker and a slave to Whiskey you will be the master over him then that Old Devil of alcohol of of alcohol that that that that that made you drink he's your master now but when you get Faith I don't mean to make believe Faith a real Faith he's your servant then real Faith knows no defeat we as the bride of Christ can can stand here and in all confidence and and in all assurance and we can come boldly but we can come boldly Before the Throne of God and who we can stand and say I know no defeat I am I am I am standing on on the word of God and every Authority every promise that Christ that Christ had has has has has has has died died for I now stand here and and and and I have been filled with the Holy Ghost and I know and I know that every promise is mine I have that half of the contract nothing can can can can can stand before the believer that know that knows that knows who who who who that knows who who he is we are we are the bride of Christ for without but the Bible says without faith it is impossible it is impossible to please God but yet we as the bride of Christ we have been filled with so much faith we don't ever question God we don't ever say When God says says something we don't ever question it say I don't know Lord I I I don't know if it'll happen we can stand there in all confidence and all assur Assurance knowing that what God promised he is faithful and just and just and just to to to to to to to fulfill when get sick and and and we go to the doctor and and and we say well you know I've got I've got this problem and You Begin and you begin to describe to the doctor what your issues are and your symptoms are and he might he might he might he might hook you up to an x-ray machine or or or or or or or a C-section or not C-section but a CAT scan SK machine whatever whatever whatever it may and and he begins he begins to look around and he sees the problem and he sat there and says you've got ulcers and he says you've got you've got this you've got that and you don't ever you don't ever question it what he says you just say oh I do okay well well then well then he begins to out out some medicine and then he gives you a bottle of pills and says take these twice a day and two weeks it it'll be gone now I don't know about you but I but but I'm not a pharmacist I have no idea what's in those pills all I do is I just says it says where it says reads reads reads reads reads reads to take to take to take to take to take twice twice twice a day and it's once in the morning and once in night you just take it and before you know it your Pain's gone your symptoms gone why because why why because we have faith in what the doctor has has has has has has has told us and yet yet in these last days when all this world is stumbling around in darkness and don't know what's up and what's down they're so confused they don't know who to trust they they don't know they don't know what's going on we have an anchor an anchor in the soul and God has laid it out has has has has laid these things out in this message in these last days and he and he told us and he's told us by his stripes we are healed we can sat there and say and say by his stripes I am healed we don't question it we don't set to wonder if it's going to work we have the chief doctors doctors and and he's written out a prescription for us we just walk out there and start our truck up why because we don't have to question anything anything we can just take it and claim it because why because he has he has he he has proven himself Time After Time After Time After Time to us we don't ever have to sit there and question well is is God is God a Healer or is he not we we know he is we've seen him move we've seen him do it thousands and thousands of times in our lives he has more than than than Vindicated himself himself himself himself himself to us that's why it blows my mind when when people constantly question question the prophet of God they constantly sat there and say well he missed it here or he missed it there it's like my goodness that has been Vindicated over and over and over and and yet we have the audacity to set them a question if brother random told us not to have a pink Rock in my yard yard yard I want to have a pink have a pink Rock in my yard do I understand it nope I have no idea I have no idea but but if brother Bram said not to do it we're not going to do it why because the doctor has been Vindicated to us over and over and over and yet and yet people still sat there and question him and and questioning whether he was right here or or or or not or whether he was just he wasn't he wasn't anointed here or there and and and yet we can we have we have we have the Vindication of of his his his his ministry time and time again that Pillar of Fire setting right there is a Vindication to us that we should never have to question ever ever to us ever ever ever ever to us but and yet we as a bride of Christ we can we can sit there and take the doctor and and take and take the prescription and say and say by his stripes I am healed and through faith I shall overcome we can we can be so burdened down so burdened down so we can be so so burdened down with with with with with sin and with burdens in our lives till we feel so dirty and unclean and maybe we as a bride have tried to have tried to we've tried no matter what we did we we we tried and to overcome this but but but yet we turn around and fail again and we try again we get up and try again and we fail again we might have tried every single remedy that that that that we know of and all we have to do is come to Dr Jesus and all we have to do is say and say Lord I need you tonight and and yet he will set there and say by my blood ye shall overcome if we'll just take we take we if we'll if we'll take it tonight and go out there and and and claim it tonight it can be ours why faith is our victory that overcomes the world if the musicians if the musicians will come um brother bam said he said he said said said said said he he he he said do you feel that that do you feel you can just leave now everything every burden you could just walk over above it now if you do raise up your hand and say by God's grace I lay this I lay this this I by God's grace I laid this TR TR Tri trial down I I won't fight it anymore I'm just going to take a hold of his hand and start walking on he said I fought brother random I've tried to quit smoking I've tried to let my my I've tried to let my hair hair grow out I've tried to do this I've done I've tried so hard so hard so hard brother brandom I just can't do it he said don't try anymore just take a hold of his hand and say father you put my hand in this Leaf see I'm just going to have to have to give you my hand I'm going to walk on Lord looking to you it'll happen it'll dress you like a real Christian you'll be a a a a real a real a real Christian why because we have stepped Beyond the Veil of our natural senses we have stepped Beyond the Veil of what of what the world sees we have stepped Beyond the Veil of what of what the world calls normal and we have entered into his presence where we can just sit there and and take of that that pot of mana and we can just eat and eat and eat and day in and day out you don't ever have to leave there you can stand there stay there stay there forever in in his glorious presence why because we as the bride of Christ we have been we have been the expressed thoughts of God since before the foundation of the world we are the we we are the the word bride of these last days everything that Christ died for is for us us us as the bride in these last days nobody else could ever experience this nobody else else else else else else has ever been able to to to experience a complete freedom and a complete restoration it was like of what it was like to be like Adam and Eve walking walking walking through through the ghoul of that
