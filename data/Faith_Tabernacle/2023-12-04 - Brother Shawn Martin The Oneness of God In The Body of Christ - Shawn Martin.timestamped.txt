[35:12] the first verse these words spake Jesus
[35:16] and lifted up his eyes to heaven and
[35:19] said father the hour is come glorify thy
[35:23] son that thy son May glorify
[35:28] thee as thou Hast given him Power Over
[35:31] All Flesh that he should give eternal
[35:35] life to as many as thou Hast given him
[35:39] and this is life eternal that they might
[35:42] Know Thee the only true God in Jesus
[35:47] Christ whom thou has sent I have
[35:50] glorified thee on the earth I have
[35:54] finished the work which thou gavest me
[35:57] to do and now oh Father
[36:01] glorify thou me with thine own self with
[36:05] the glory which I had with thee before
[36:09] the world
[36:10] was I have manifested thy name unto the
[36:14] men which thou gavest me but of the
[36:19] world uh thine they were and thou gavest
[36:24] them me and they have kept Thy word now
[36:29] they have known that all things
[36:32] whatsoever thou Hast given me are of
[36:35] thee for I have given unto them The
[36:39] Words which thou gavest me and they have
[36:42] receive them and have known surely that
[36:45] I came out from thee and they have
[36:49] believed that thou did send me I pray
[36:54] for them I pray not for the world but
[36:57] for them which thou Hast given me for
[37:00] they are thine and all mine are thine
[37:03] and all thine are mine and am glorified
[37:07] in them and now I am no more in the
[37:11] world but these are in the world and I
[37:15] come to thee Holy Father keep through
[37:18] thine own name those which thou Hast
[37:21] given me that they may be one and as we
[37:27] are
[37:28] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[37:31] of prayer
[37:33] father what a profound prayer that Jesus
[37:38] would
[37:40] pray not just for those that was with
[37:44] him in the
[37:46] natural the 12 but Lord he was praying
[37:50] all the way down to this age Hallelujah

[38:13] anoint both speaker and hearer thank you

[38:21] tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the
[38:25] church says amen amen amen you can have
[38:29] your seats this evening praise the Lord
[38:34] and um I guess the title that I would
[38:37] use is the Oneness of God in the body of
[38:40] Christ you know we are we are fixing to
[38:44] step into eternity and this is something
[38:48] that uh the prophet said that you know
[38:51] that why we're in the greatest age ever
[38:54] to be and that's because we are are
[38:57] stepping into from from uh time into uh
[39:03] eternity mortality
[39:05] immortality and church this is this is
[39:08] about to happen this is about to take
[39:11] place and how how exciting that we
[39:15] should be and and every time that we
[39:18] come to the house of God every time we
[39:21] we play a message and and things you
[39:24] know uh uh we we come and we do these
[39:28] things to know how we should live and
[39:30] how we should think and how we should
[39:33] talk and the way we should conduct
[39:35] ourselves and because we're we're we're
[39:38] preparing for eternity we we're
[39:41] preparing again we we thank the Lord for
[39:44] filling us with the baptism of the Holy
[39:46] Ghost and and sealing us into the body
[39:49] but uh uh but yet there there is a
[39:53] preparation it's a continual molding and
[39:55] conform forming and and and these things
[39:59] and and so what what Jesus prayed I I
[40:03] truly believe that in this age it's when
[40:06] it's actually coming to its reality and
[40:10] we are that people uh you know it's
[40:14] amazing how a prayer can be prophetic
[40:16] but it was prophetic um because Jesus
[40:19] knew what would take place and he knew a
[40:22] certain group of people and who knew who
[40:24] that people would be and and you know we
[40:27] we you know that song that we sing
[40:30] sometimes when he was on the cross I was
[40:32] on his mind I I believe that prayer I
[40:35] was on his mind when he was praying that
[40:36] prayer and and I I think I think we were
[40:40] um because God was praying for a Oneness
[40:43] uh here and it it seems like uh everyone
[40:49] uh is is is trying for a uh to bring a
[40:54] Oneness they uh in in in some way or
[40:57] another and and that's because man was
[41:01] made for Oneness he he was made for that
[41:04] and and so but when Jesus is praying he
[41:07] says I I pray not for the world uh but
[41:10] he was praying for that elect for he
[41:12] says I pray for those that thou Hast
[41:14] given me and and and and he wasn't
[41:18] satisfied with just any kind of Oneness
[41:21] but it was a a certain Oneness and that
[41:24] Oneness was the same kind of Oneness
[41:26] that he and the father had ain't that
[41:29] right now this kind of Oneness cannot
[41:33] exist uh H apart from being in the body
[41:37] of of of Christ it uh a person must be
[41:41] baptized into the body to have or to be
[41:44] a part of of this Oneness can you say
[41:48] amen amen and so we we cannot be the
[41:52] church uh uh uh and and and and not have
[41:56] the Oneness that Jesus was praying for
[42:00] so we're we're glad to be in the church
[42:02] we're glad to be baptized uh by
[42:04] spiritual baptism into the body of
[42:07] Christ as we've been uh uh speaking of
[42:10] Amen but but in this this is where the
[42:14] Oneness is going to take place this is
[42:17] where the Oneness is happening is in the
[42:20] body of Christ do you believe that and
[42:22] and so the the prophet says see we've
[42:25] got to have a church that's washed in
[42:28] the blood of the lamb and become one
[42:31] with the word see to be the church see
[42:35] so so the Church of the Living God Amen
[42:38] there's got to be a Oneness but that
[42:40] Oneness is one with the word ain't that
[42:44] right no wonder the word of God is so
[42:46] important to us over anything over our
[42:50] feelings over emotions over over over
[42:54] any circumstance of of any anything the
[42:57] word of God means everything to us and
[43:00] so uh John 847 Jesus said he that is of
[43:05] God heareth God's words ye therefore
[43:10] hear them not because you're not of God
[43:13] so he puts the distinction that he that
[43:16] is of god heareth the words of God he
[43:19] that is not of God heareth not the words
[43:21] of God and as as we've been saying all
[43:24] along that that that Miracles can happen
[43:28] anywhere uh uh gifts can be operated in
[43:31] the body outside the body anointed and
[43:34] and and and all of these things but the
[43:37] distinction is he that is of god heareth
[43:40] the words of God and he that is not of
[43:43] God heareth them not ain't that right so
[43:46] so uh uh brother brandom in in talking
[43:49] of of Jesus's day and and the people the
[43:53] Pharisees Sadducees and things he said
[43:55] they had refused the word see they had
[43:58] refused the word uh uh Jesus and his
[44:02] words for their day but the true seed
[44:05] everybody say the true seed the true
[44:07] seed received the word because they were
[44:11] of God ain't that right so now in in the
[44:16] the the church ages um uh God addresses
[44:20] each Church Age and and every Church age
[44:23] what does he say at the end he that hath
[44:25] an ear to hear Let Him hear what the
[44:29] spirit says to the church a lot of
[44:31] things took place in the church ages in
[44:33] each age but at the end he that hath an
[44:36] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[44:40] to the church well why is that because
[44:42] the spirit gives the word and the word
[44:46] is the truth ain't that right so he that
[44:49] has Truth for each Age and and see then
[44:54] then or God has truth the prophet said
[44:56] for each age and his elect hears the
[45:00] truth amen for for that age ain't that
[45:04] right see so uh brother Brown would say
[45:07] the that that elect group always heard
[45:10] the word down Through the Ages that
[45:12] elect group it could have been a small
[45:14] group but that elect group always heard
[45:16] the word and received it proving they
[45:21] had the seed within them ain't that
[45:25] right the prophet Isaiah in
[45:28] 54:13 said all thy children shall be
[45:31] taught of God the holy spirit all thy
[45:34] children shall be taught of God John
[45:37] 6:45 it is written in the prophets that
[45:40] they shall and they shall be all taught
[45:43] of God every man therefore that hath
[45:45] heard and that hath learned or hath
[45:48] learned of the father cometh unto me so
[45:52] he puts the distinction as of of who the
[45:56] is they are those that hear the word of
[45:59] God receive the word of God and and
[46:02] because they have that ability to do so
[46:05] they come unto him ain't that right see
[46:07] God pulls us through his word he pulls
[46:10] us through his truth ain't that right
[46:13] amen we we have a lot of things and and
[46:16] and you say well I I thought first
[46:17] second third you know first pull was the
[46:20] the the attraction and that's true amen
[46:22] but what kept you what what kept you
[46:25] when everybody else left it during that
[46:27] third pool when it was the third pool
[46:29] the opening of the word many people
[46:31] forsook many people left but there was
[46:34] that certain group that stayed and and
[46:38] as Jesus told them and and actually you
[46:41] know uh when the 70 walked away and said
[46:43] this is a hard saying what was he doing
[46:46] he was actually opening the word to them
[46:48] it was his third pull Ministry ain't
[46:50] that right and then he turns around to
[46:53] his disciples and says will you go also
[46:55] he didn't beg him he didn't plead he
[46:57] didn't he said well you know I'll give
[46:59] you a large pizza if you'll just stay
[47:01] with me you know it wasn't that at all
[47:03] he actually said would you go also and
[47:05] and and Peter I believe it was that said
[47:08] where can we go for thou Hast the words
[47:11] of eternal life so so it it it it it it
[47:15] boils down of of being one with the word
[47:19] proves whether you are of God and spirit
[47:23] filled ain't that right now gifts are
[47:26] manifestation of the spirit and we thank
[47:30] God for gifts I believe in gifts
[47:32] speaking in tongues and interpretation
[47:33] of tongues healing and miracles and
[47:36] prophecies and and and all the other
[47:38] gifts that Paul uh the Apostle Paul
[47:41] mentioned in in the New Testament and
[47:43] and these things they they manifestation
[47:46] of the spirit but notice 1 Corinthians
[47:49] 12:7 but the manifestation of the spirit
[47:53] is given to every man right
[47:56] can you say that with me every man it's
[47:58] given to every man to profit with all
[48:02] ain't that right so so the manifestation
[48:05] of the spirit is different from having
[48:08] the baptism of the Holy
[48:10] Ghost ain't that right it's different at
[48:13] least that's what the prophet taught
[48:15] amen see so balam had a genuine gift and
[48:19] was genuinely anointed but he was not
[48:22] according to the prophet of the of the
[48:24] of of the power said he was not a true
[48:27] seed Prophet amen because even though he
[48:30] had a gift and even though he was
[48:33] anointed yet he uh uh wasn't anointed to
[48:36] the word of God Amen brother Ram says
[48:39] for he took the wages of unrighteousness
[48:41] and worst of all he led the people of
[48:44] God into sins of fornication and
[48:47] idolatry yet who would dare to deny that
[48:49] the spirit of God manifested through him
[48:52] in one of the most beautiful portions of
[48:55] absolute absolutely accurate prophecy
[48:58] the world has ever seen but he never had
[49:01] the Holy Ghost can you say Amen so as we
[49:04] said this morning his teaching his uh uh
[49:06] prophecy was right but his teaching was
[49:09] wrong so brother Bram said see if you
[49:11] are truly filled with the spirit of God
[49:14] you will have the evidence everybody say
[49:17] the evidence of the word in your life
[49:23] can you say Amen now you we talking
[49:25] about a oness now if you're truly
[49:27] Spirit-filled you'll have the evidence
[49:30] of the word in your life so look you
[49:33] know looking at the word and and there's
[49:35] so many things because I believe that
[49:37] every type and shatter speaking of the
[49:40] Bride speaks of us today e every
[49:43] Everything of scriptures you know uh as
[49:46] as the word come to its fullness in
[49:48] Jesus's day so has the word come in its
[49:51] fullness in this bright coming of Christ
[49:54] as well ain't that right so so the word
[49:57] talks about uh talks about true worship
[50:00] and and according to what Jesus said in
[50:03] John 4:24 they that worship Him must
[50:06] worship Him in spirit and in truth can
[50:10] you say Amen so for those that don't
[50:13] believe in worship for those that that
[50:15] think that well they're they're
[50:17] Pentecostal because they shout and they
[50:19] get excited and and all of these things
[50:22] well if we're truly one with with the
[50:25] word and have that Oneness that Jesus
[50:28] was talking about we can find that
[50:30] worship for this age is in the Bible for
[50:33] Revelations 5 talks about it can you say
[50:36] Amen see it was after the lamb took the
[50:39] book and loosened the seals thereof amen
[50:43] there was worship amen can you say Amen
[50:48] there was worship amen see now I've I've
[50:51] been in the Pentecostal era I know what
[50:53] it is when when they got the music going
[50:55] and and and and and and working the
[50:58] crowd up there is not one time that I
[51:01] have seen in in in in uh uh uh well in
[51:04] in this church in our meetings or or
[51:07] around to where that people are worked
[51:10] up by by music it's by the word of God
[51:14] Amen and after the preaching of the word
[51:16] there ought to be a worship going forth
[51:20] can you say amen amen see so so now now
[51:23] brother brandham identified this this
[51:26] type of worship as king lamb worship so
[51:30] worship of the Bride there's nothing
[51:32] wrong with
[51:33] worship can you sayen it it it's what's
[51:37] causing the worship see so the word
[51:39] speaks of signs and wonders following
[51:41] the believer the word speaks of the
[51:43] fivefold ministry which are five
[51:46] predestinated gifts that God placed in
[51:49] in the church in his church his body the
[51:53] word speaks of nine spiritual gifts that
[51:55] God has placed in the church the word
[51:57] speaks of this bride doing the Greater
[51:59] Works the word speaks of of the
[52:02] manifestation of the sons of God and
[52:04] every one of them is is of these things
[52:08] is to happen in this
[52:10] age can you say amen that's right I
[52:13] don't believe that God restored the
[52:15] gifts Amen in in the Pentecostal age
[52:17] only to take them out Amen in this age I
[52:21] don't believe that God took
[52:23] justification amen restored that part in
[52:26] Luther's age only to take it out in this
[52:28] age I don't believe that uh uh uh uh uh
[52:32] that God would restore holiness amen and
[52:36] and and uh uh sanctification in in
[52:40] Wesley's age only to take it out in this
[52:42] age here can you say amen amen but as
[52:45] he's restored it he's been bringing a
[52:48] body into
[52:51] completeness yes sir and you say Amen
[52:54] now as we talked about it they didn't
[52:55] know what they
[52:56] had sure ain't that right but when God
[53:00] sent us a prophet he placed Us
[53:02] positionally in the word of God and now
[53:06] we're
[53:08] maturing understanding what these things
[53:10] are I believe we have a greater
[53:12] revelation of justification than what
[53:14] Luther had I believe we have a greater
[53:17] revelation of of sanctification than
[53:19] what Wesley had I believe we have a
[53:21] greater revelation of the gifts than
[53:23] what Pentecost had right can you say
[53:26] amen amen see so so we we're we're
[53:29] looking at these time brother Bram said
[53:31] there's never been a time for the sons
[53:33] of God to be manifested outside of this
[53:36] time he said tell me brother tell me my
[53:38] brother tell me my sister when has this
[53:40] ever been outside of this age can you
[53:43] say man see so we we find even the
[53:46] Supernatural is in the word it talks
[53:49] about we we are a supernatural people do
[53:52] you believe that see the word prophet
[53:55] prophesies of a bride having Authority
[53:58] in the word when she speaks do you
[54:00] realize that is is is for us today amen
[54:04] Jesus said if you say to this mountain
[54:06] be thou removed and and don't doubt you
[54:08] can have what you say these things are
[54:11] for
[54:13] today can you say Amen see so so we we
[54:17] find it's in this day that the prophet
[54:20] said the word is in the bride and she
[54:24] has thus sayith the Lord she has the
[54:27] sayith the Lord can you say Amen see so
[54:31] it's now we are coming into a Oneness
[54:34] the way Jesus had come and the Oneness
[54:37] existed between God and him uh brother
[54:40] brandom I I read this this morning but
[54:43] I'll read it again make no mistake about
[54:45] it a person that is truly baptized by
[54:48] the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ
[54:51] receiving the fullness of the spirit
[54:53] will be in the word all the way and that
[54:56] is the evidence of being baptized with
[55:00] the Holy Ghost all right now we talked
[55:03] about it how that Eve couldn't
[55:05] wait talked about this morning how that
[55:08] God told them to to to multiply and
[55:11] replenish the Earth but Eve couldn't
[55:13] wait and so when when Adam came to her
[55:18] he found that she was already uh
[55:20] pregnated with the wrong seed instead of
[55:23] the word seed ain't that right so the
[55:25] prophet said she never did Bear a the
[55:27] life seed a life child because she
[55:30] disbelieved she rejected the word and
[55:33] Adam her husband found her to be a
[55:36] prostitute because she she received seed
[55:39] out out other than the way she was
[55:41] supposed to ain't that right and so well
[55:45] then brother Bram goes and talks about
[55:46] how Jehovah's bride done the same thing
[55:49] amen she was put away he put her away uh
[55:52] uh Bill wrote her a bill of divorcement
[55:54] uh because she disbelieved and and
[55:57] brother Bram says this is here it was in
[56:01] in Sam 1st Samuel 8:7 the Lord said unto
[56:03] Samuel remember they wanted a king you
[56:06] know God sent them a prophet a word
[56:08] Prophet but they wanted a king they
[56:09] wanted to be like the other nations and
[56:11] and and so forth and and Samuel came to
[56:14] the Lord crying and and and saying you
[56:16] know they've rejected me you know and
[56:18] and you could have must have felt what
[56:21] it what he was feeling in as feeling
[56:23] rejected from the people but the Lord
[56:25] said unto Samuel go ahead and hearken
[56:27] unto the voice of the people in all that
[56:29] they say unto thee for they have not
[56:31] rejected thee but they have rejected me
[56:35] that I should not Reign Over them can
[56:37] you say Amen here Samuel a prophet
[56:39] thought that the people was literally
[56:41] rejecting him and God says oh no they're
[56:43] not rejecting you they're literally
[56:45] rejecting
[56:47] me because the word comes to a prophet
[56:51] right that's right anytime someone
[56:53] rejects a prophet but you're rejecting
[56:56] God true and so the prophet said see
[57:00] that she wanted to go whing around after
[57:03] the rest of the people see she couldn't
[57:05] wait therefore she rejected the word and
[57:07] she went after uh and and was found
[57:10] pregnated with the wrong seed he goes on
[57:13] and talks how Jesus's bride done the
[57:15] same thing uh uh you know that that uh
[57:19] uh she she couldn't wait uh uh and and
[57:23] before you know it she was found in
[57:24] impregnated with the wrong seed and
[57:26] notice what the prophet said they have
[57:28] to manufacture something they can't wait
[57:31] for the Holy Spirit to come and get into
[57:33] the church can you say amen amen this is
[57:36] the problem with with down Through the
[57:39] Ages they could not wait for the Holy
[57:42] Ghost to come and get into the church
[57:44] they had to have something they had to
[57:45] manufacture something can you say Amen
[57:48] see so so he says all they're all
[57:51] all polluted their husband
[57:53] couldn't get to them they was already
[57:55] pregnated for their husband got to them
[57:57] can you say Amen see and what made them
[58:00] that way he says they rejected the word
[58:03] and took a
[58:04] denomination so Methodist Traditions
[58:07] have rejected the word Baptist
[58:08] Traditions have rejected the word uh um
[58:12] uh uh Seventh Day Adventist have
[58:13] rejected the word Jehovah's Witness have
[58:16] rejected the word Pentecostals have
[58:18] rejected the word you cannot find a a
[58:21] religion a denomination that has
[58:24] accepted the word they all turning down
[58:27] yes can you say Amen so so this this
[58:30] Oneness that Jesus is praying for you
[58:33] ain't going to find it in the Baptist
[58:34] Church you're not going to find it in a
[58:35] Pentecostal Church you're not going to
[58:37] find it in the apostolic
[58:39] church right ain't that right but God
[58:43] that prayer must come to
[58:45] pass amen Jesus ain't praying for to be
[58:49] in vain and to think of it he's praying
[58:52] for
[58:53] you hallelujah it's not just a preacher
[58:56] praying for you God God in flesh is
[58:59] praying for
[59:00] you make him one
[59:03] Lord hallelujah no telling
[59:06] he no no telling he probably saw the
[59:09] deception of the devil coming through
[59:10] these
[59:11] ages and and he knew he knew no doubt
[59:14] that that that in this age it would get
[59:17] so close that to deceive the elect and
[59:20] and and I I I maybe maybe he as he's
[59:22] he's seeing these things I don't know
[59:24] but but maybe there was just something
[59:27] down in his heart said oh
[59:30] God be
[59:32] merciful make him
[59:34] one prayer
[59:37] Works can you say Amen prayer
[59:41] Works see and and and so so every Church
[59:44] down Through the Ages he would give them
[59:46] a Revival and and they would reject it
[59:48] and accepting an organization accepting
[59:51] tradition accepting man's ideas and and
[59:54] even even Jesus said by teaching for
[59:56] Doctrine the Commandments of men they
[59:58] have made the word of God of no effect
[1:00:00] amen amen couldn't have a Rapture in
[1:00:02] Luther's age couldn't have a Rapture in
[1:00:04] Wesley's age couldn't have a Rapture in
[1:00:06] in any other age it there was no Oneness
[1:00:10] there good brother y can you say amen
[1:00:13] amen amen they made the word of God of
[1:00:15] none effect and the prophet said they
[1:00:17] cannot bring forth a word birth you
[1:00:20] cannot bring it ain't that right he said
[1:00:23] the church that will refuse and I want
[1:00:24] you to listen now the church that will
[1:00:26] refuse to believe the word of God is a
[1:00:29] hybrid church with dogmas Creeds
[1:00:31] doctrines that's not
[1:00:34] scriptural everything they're teaching
[1:00:36] is not scriptural right amen he said
[1:00:39] that church that church cannot bring
[1:00:41] forth a spirit fi child because it's
[1:00:44] hybrid it's no good it it might be
[1:00:47] bigger great big walls find pews big
[1:00:49] bails plush seets but that doesn't mean
[1:00:51] one thing it's spiritually dead amen
[1:00:54] yeah he said see it cannot bring for
[1:00:56] spirit filled children because it's dead
[1:00:59] itself now brother brandom in The
[1:01:02] Invisible Union of the Bride you you
[1:01:04] know I he talks about you know in
[1:01:05] comparing about women of today uh uh
[1:01:08] with with the the the modern church and
[1:01:12] you know how how they they refuse to to
[1:01:16] bring forth a child for their husband
[1:01:18] and and and and so forth and and so he
[1:01:21] says if they don't bring forth a child
[1:01:23] for their husband then they're going to
[1:01:24] mother a cat or a dog and that's
[1:01:27] happening uh and they they'll pay
[1:01:29] they'll pay a lot of money for them
[1:01:31] things amen and and not only that then
[1:01:34] they have their birthday party I know a
[1:01:36] couple that's had uh man had had
[1:01:39] birthday party for the dogs you know and
[1:01:42] and it really gets out there I'm telling
[1:01:44] you and I think the dogs live live a
[1:01:46] little bit more better than some
[1:01:48] children
[1:01:50] to but but brother brand said see to
[1:01:52] Bear a child for a husband see and raise
[1:01:55] it to the service of God that's entirely
[1:01:57] out of her line oh she'd be disgraced if
[1:01:59] she did by her sin loving Society of
[1:02:01] this 1965 type women and now it's worse
[1:02:04] in this age he said see it's a true
[1:02:07] picture of a modern church today neither
[1:02:10] does the modern Church want any of these
[1:02:12] here screaming shouting tongue speaking
[1:02:14] acts 238 youngans around her she she
[1:02:17] don't want any of them hooping and
[1:02:19] crying and screaming amen hallelujah see
[1:02:23] why such a child would put her
[1:02:24] immediately out of her denomination see
[1:02:27] if they had one of them in their
[1:02:28] churches they' throw her out right quick
[1:02:30] see why are you letting that stuff does
[1:02:32] this go along see so she's pregnated
[1:02:35] with something cuz she's bringing forth
[1:02:37] members all the time but she does not
[1:02:40] want any of them see screaming hollering
[1:02:43] blabbing uh uh acts 238 miserable
[1:02:46] creatures that she thinks they are see
[1:02:48] it would certainly embarrass her ain't
[1:02:51] that right it would ruin her and her
[1:02:53] educator ethical scientific Society
[1:02:56] Church that she belong he boy he covered
[1:02:58] it all right he says that they would
[1:03:00] throw her out at the next Council she
[1:03:02] can't have it so she does not want to be
[1:03:05] pregnated with the word because that's
[1:03:07] the only kind that the word can bring
[1:03:09] forth can you say Amen see born of the
[1:03:12] spirit of God it has the spirit of God
[1:03:15] in it see if you're born of the uh of
[1:03:17] the spirit of God you have the spirit of
[1:03:20] God see no intellectual Church joining
[1:03:23] Creed goinging robbed hair painted face
[1:03:26] there's no such a thing in that as in in
[1:03:28] that at all you don't find that in the
[1:03:30] word you find it oh Fashion Sanctified
[1:03:33] Holy Ghost filled child born of the
[1:03:35] spirit of God screaming hollering
[1:03:37] shouting and praising God why it's in
[1:03:40] the
[1:03:41] word and what has happened you received
[1:03:44] not a denominational birth but a word
[1:03:49] birth ain't that right see so so then
[1:03:54] you you know uh uh it was right after
[1:03:56] the fall of of woman a man that that God
[1:04:01] promised the woman that she would
[1:04:03] receive a seed and and Genesis 3:15 I
[1:04:07] didn't give that to you but and I will
[1:04:10] put enity you know uh between thee God
[1:04:13] speaking to to that serpent I'll put
[1:04:16] enity between thee and the woman and
[1:04:18] between thy seed and her seed right now
[1:04:21] I I I don't know but I I believe that
[1:04:24] that that scripture became more clearer
[1:04:27] to us under the message of the hour
[1:04:30] right and it shall bruise thy head and
[1:04:33] and thou shalt bruise his heel and
[1:04:35] brother brand said see her seed a woman
[1:04:37] don't have seed it's the man's seed but
[1:04:41] he was showing right there that it would
[1:04:43] be a virgin that would receive seed not
[1:04:46] by man but God would give her seed God
[1:04:49] would create the seed can you say man's
[1:04:52] seed it wouldn't be man SE seed see Adam
[1:04:55] had come to his natural wife amen but
[1:04:58] she had already had seed ain't that
[1:05:01] right she should have received the word
[1:05:03] seed but she was already impregnated but
[1:05:06] God said there will be a woman that will
[1:05:09] have a seed and it won't be by man God
[1:05:12] promising a a virgin can you say man
[1:05:15] well then years later here come the
[1:05:17] prophet Isaiah and God promises very
[1:05:19] clearly Behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:05:22] and have bring forth a a son ain't that
[1:05:26] right so before she could be pregnated
[1:05:29] with a sex seed the Holy Ghost would
[1:05:32] come to her and give her a seed amen and
[1:05:37] bring forth the Son of God Amen ain't
[1:05:40] that right yes sir oh aren't you glad
[1:05:42] for that well God promised it
[1:05:45] again he's promised that his church he
[1:05:48] would have a
[1:05:49] bride that before that before man would
[1:05:52] get to her yes and plant his seed in her
[1:05:59] denominations teachings of man doctrines
[1:06:01] of theology all these things God would
[1:06:05] get to her and give her a seed amen can
[1:06:09] you say Amen now now church here you
[1:06:12] know the you know the prophet said that
[1:06:14] she will not be manhandled right this
[1:06:17] bride in this age ain't going to be
[1:06:19] manhandled she's not going to be United
[1:06:21] with denominations and Creeds of man if
[1:06:24] that ain't the union that's going to
[1:06:25] happen this is the union between him and
[1:06:29] her Lord God and her ain't that right
[1:06:32] now brother Brown says now it's sea
[1:06:36] time it's bright time God going to show
[1:06:39] who his bride really is can you say man
[1:06:43] he's showing her off in this age amen
[1:06:46] aren't you glad for that church if you
[1:06:48] could only know you know job God was
[1:06:51] bragging on job all that time on the
[1:06:53] reason why job was going through all
[1:06:55] that God was bragging on him God was
[1:06:57] telling Satan you'll never be able to
[1:06:59] touch him you'll never be able to get
[1:07:01] him to quit and recant and give up and
[1:07:04] curse me you'll never be able to do it
[1:07:06] and so he said in this age there will be
[1:07:08] a bride that will not accept your your
[1:07:10] dogma and your theology and your
[1:07:14] nonsense he's tried it but she ain't
[1:07:16] going to be
[1:07:18] manhandled this is the time for a
[1:07:22] Oneness
[1:07:25] brother Brian said the Chucks are dead
[1:07:27] they're dried up it's virgin word time
[1:07:31] not touched it's a virgin remember a
[1:07:34] virgin word time if you put it in the
[1:07:36] hands of a denomination it sure wouldn't
[1:07:38] be a virgin that's right it'll be
[1:07:40] manhandled time you get uh uh get to it
[1:07:43] but God's church is not touched by
[1:07:46] denomination aren't you glad for that
[1:07:49] you we might have been steeped into it
[1:07:51] you thought this was it but God was able
[1:07:53] to take you bring you in this message
[1:07:56] bring you out now you ain't got a you
[1:07:58] ain't got a touch of denomination on you
[1:08:01] all
[1:08:02] right think of that Hallelujah you know
[1:08:05] how many times that people have been
[1:08:06] manhandled by denominations and they
[1:08:09] couldn't believe this
[1:08:11] Prophet they they they can't believe the
[1:08:13] Prophet come on now because their pastor
[1:08:15] says it's it's of the devil and and the
[1:08:17] bishop says it's of this and you know
[1:08:19] thinking of the Catholic woman I
[1:08:21] remember a man wanting to give uh a Rel
[1:08:24] of of his Bible and and and and she's
[1:08:27] she was strict Catholic and but he
[1:08:29] bought her a Bible and gave it to her
[1:08:31] you know what she she took that to her
[1:08:34] priest amen and the priest told her you
[1:08:36] leave that alone that ain't for you wow
[1:08:39] now you think of that she was
[1:08:41] manhandled where she would take that
[1:08:43] Bible and put it away and take what her
[1:08:45] priest said but aren't you glad you
[1:08:47] ain't been manhandled amen no matter
[1:08:49] where you come from and what what what
[1:08:51] things you went through and all of these
[1:08:53] things you still are able to believe
[1:08:55] God's word and throw everything else and
[1:08:57] tell Satan you're a liar I will not
[1:08:59] trust you I will not take your word for
[1:09:01] it I'll take God's word every anytime
[1:09:04] over your word amen why cuz God's church
[1:09:08] is not touched by denomination it's a
[1:09:10] virgin born word of God made manifest
[1:09:13] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:09:16] and forever amen he said there will be
[1:09:19] no denominational manhandling in the
[1:09:21] Virgin birth of the Bride she is
[1:09:24] commanded by God to come out of such
[1:09:27] ain't that right well do you love the
[1:09:29] Lord yes sir see and so we we find uh uh
[1:09:34] that that the the uh uh uh what happened
[1:09:40] on the day of Pentecost amen it was it
[1:09:42] was a word birth amen for they had
[1:09:46] experienced the thing that they had
[1:09:48] experienced was not a denomination it
[1:09:50] wasn't some some thing that that
[1:09:54] happened of man it wasn't something out
[1:09:56] of the Bible but what they had
[1:09:59] experienced was spoken already by a
[1:10:02] prophet Joel ain't that right and and
[1:10:05] even the people all around was wondering
[1:10:07] what is this what what's going on who
[1:10:10] what you know these men are drunk and it
[1:10:12] was Peter that could identify what was
[1:10:14] happening by the word of God and he said
[1:10:16] but these men aren't drunk as you
[1:10:18] suppose but this is that which was
[1:10:20] spoken by the prophet Joel can you say
[1:10:22] man I I to tell you there's so many
[1:10:24] things that are happening in churches
[1:10:26] today around the world that they cannot
[1:10:28] put and say this is that which was
[1:10:30] spoken by this Bible amen but there is a
[1:10:33] bride that can take every part of her
[1:10:35] life every action every thought every
[1:10:38] word amen and they're coming back and
[1:10:40] say but this is that this day this
[1:10:43] scripture is fulfilled it's a bride
[1:10:46] revival can you sayen it's a bride
[1:10:50] Revival and that was the beginning of
[1:10:52] the Church of the Living God God Amen
[1:10:55] and and now you think of it in the Old
[1:10:57] Testament the prophet said see the
[1:10:59] spirit of God worked down through the
[1:11:01] prophets till it come to the full
[1:11:03] manifestation in Christ Jesus amen it
[1:11:07] worked all the way through the prophets
[1:11:09] amen the spirit of God in each prophet
[1:11:11] in each age amen till it come into full
[1:11:13] manifestation of Jesus Christ amen and
[1:11:16] he says the birth pains under the those
[1:11:19] prophets see them being the word see
[1:11:22] they pointed to knew that fullness of
[1:11:25] themselves see they knew it was more
[1:11:27] than just them it was Christ in them but
[1:11:30] they would Point not to this but they
[1:11:32] would point to the fullness the fullness
[1:11:36] can you say Amen kept pointing to people
[1:11:38] someday it's coming and Jesus came and
[1:11:41] said I am he I'm he I'm he can you say
[1:11:45] man this is that which was spoken by
[1:11:47] this is that this day this scripture is
[1:11:49] fulfilled everything that they spoke I
[1:11:51] am the true bread I am am the bread of
[1:11:54] life I am the living Fountain can you
[1:11:56] say man all of these things see they
[1:11:58] pointed to that to that fullness of
[1:12:01] themselves which was the fullness of the
[1:12:03] word and that was Jesus Christ well do
[1:12:05] you realize that every Prophet every
[1:12:08] Sage every every patriarch I I believe
[1:12:10] with all of my heart amen that Not only
[1:12:13] was the word speaking of a of a
[1:12:15] bridegroom but it was also speaking of a
[1:12:17] bride amen and they kept pointing the
[1:12:19] people to a fullness that was to come
[1:12:21] amen he's coming he's coming he coming
[1:12:24] amen but I I just believe that in all of
[1:12:27] this every type every shatter kept
[1:12:29] saying she's coming she's coming she's
[1:12:31] coming there's going to be another
[1:12:33] Oneness that will take place there will
[1:12:35] be a union

[1:12:39] believe yes sir it's the bright coming
[1:12:43] of
[1:12:44] Christ the bright
[1:12:46] coming you realize that there are more
[1:12:49] scriptures that pertain to our day than
[1:12:52] even Jesus
[1:12:54] day brother brah said there's many more
[1:12:57] scriptures in the Old Testament
[1:12:58] pertaining to the second coming of
[1:13:00] Christ than there was to be uh was to
[1:13:02] the first coming of Christ think of that
[1:13:05] more
[1:13:06] scriptures more scriptures speaking of
[1:13:09] this age and than it was even that
[1:13:14] age and God promised and and I won't

[1:15:18] boys are becoming so polluted in their
[1:15:20] mind with pornography

[1:15:36] okay if their
[1:15:39] husband if if it was called cheating to
[1:15:41] be with a
[1:15:43] prostitute most everyone said no we
[1:15:47] don't consider it cheating if they need
[1:15:49] to go do their thing let them do it as
[1:15:51] long as they don't fall in love
[1:15:55] but you see where the sacredness has
