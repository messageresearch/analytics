the worship the faith and the Lord has just done great things and um I was thanking um prayer requests that had come last night from my son and daughter-in-law their my grandson Titus had been running fever for several days and couldn't uh get it down and just not feeling good and they had been watching the services online uh throughout the week and Seth text last night and said just during the prayer line when people were coming up so that fever just left and broke and and Titus just doing great so we we just thanked the Lord amen I thank God honors prayer I think he honors prayer lines he honors that what he does he honors faith and that's the main thing and whether uh I don't think you need to be in a prayer line to get healed but there's nothing against prayer lines brother Branham he had them and and the Lord I've seen God just do miraculous things in in the Pew I remember preaching there in Beckley West Virginia and and uh just right I mean after we got done preaching the musicians hadn't even come up we just the people just you know begin to Worship the Lord and the presence of God just dropped in that place and people started screaming dancing one man in the back just fell out and uh and I didn't even make an altar call then others were running to the altar I mean the Lord done something but afterward um the next night a brother came to me and said brother Sean says I've been blind I was blind and won my eyes I can't remember which I said but while the presence of the Lord came I was in my Pew and God touched that eye he said I covered my my good eye and drove drove home with that bad eye and said I can see and that was no hands laid upon him it was just the word of God the angel of the Lord came by and I just believe the angel of the Lord has been here in our meeting and and I'm expecting just great results I've just heard of tremendous reports already and I tell you what the Lord is moving among his people and it's one thing and it's just encouraging our faith we're ready for a Rapture church I and I know I know there's people sitting here or here today that won't taste death amen they've already got that translation power within them amen and and I trust it's in all of us this morning amen even to you little ones amen expect a Rapture to happen any day amen every once in a while Levi or Ruth say daddy when are we going home when are we going to heaven I said just any day just keep your head up we're leaving and I just believe that amen and we've heard tremendous tremendous messages last night brother Andrew just done a wonderful job a god of paradox and I'm so glad to serve that God and that Paradox is in US amen oh my you can have your seats I I want to just welcome all the uh the visitors those that have supported our meeting throughout the week may God bless you and I trust that you can go to your church and and carry some of that Revival um that that encouragement in inside of you and let it just spread you know and um because I I we just really appreciate you coming and I see uh sister Mariah's family amen God bless you all and brother Andrew's family God bless you all it's just really good to have you and we've just grown to to love you all and appreciate your friendship and and I tell you what we we've been so blessed to have brother Andrew and sister Mariah at our church so uh uh the Lord has just blessed us and they've been a real inspiration to us but I know uh you're not just here to see me uh even though I that you know I'd like to say that but uh uh but grandchild did a little um uh Malachi is going to get dedicated today and uh so I I was going to read this scripture uh here in Mark uh the 10th chapter and um I think it's the um 13th verse we'll start there I forgot my glasses but says then they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven A kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms and put his hands upon them and bless them a man and the prophet taught us that this is this is a commission that we are to do and uh you know there are some that they they baptize they feel like you know you know the child needs to be sprinkled or baptized or whatever but we know that that baptism is actually a part of repentance repentance comes first and then baptism but we see that a child allowed he he hasn't committed sin I was thinking today little Malachi he's he he hasn't done any sin and Christ paid for his sins of Adam what Adam did uh and he made that child innocent and so uh uh you know um so we're not here to to baptize him but we are here to to pray over him that God's blessings would rest upon him and and so if uh brother Andrew and sister Mariah would come we we know there's that song and we're going to sing it uh [Music] men from the fields bring them in and bring them in all bring the little ones to [Music] fields of sin bring them in over bring them in bring the little ones to Jesus this is from Brother Andrew and sister Mariah it says brother Sean and church family thank you for all you did for us during the birth of our son Malachi words cannot express how much we appreciated the offering all the meals you brought and most of all the prayers we're honored to to be a part of Faith Tabernacle may God richly bless you all brother Andrew Sister Mariah little Malachi praise the lord well I tell you what we are looking forward to the word of God this morning have you come with a hungry appetite a man and I tell you what the word of God is eternal we we you know we we could go to church every night of our lives and the word still be unfolding and um and so we just uh want brother Andrew just to take his time his Liberty whatever the Lord is laid upon his heart uh we want him to preach to us amen I I and I know this is uh what are really it's our Eighth Day in service and you may be a little tired but uh pushed past that tiredness amen I know it just sometimes you got to put that effort into it and we're not going to be having service Wednesday night and uh so that give you a little break so so one one more service then you get a break but uh let's just let God to do whatever he wants to do with us today amen how many he expects God to do something amen well let's stand to our feet eat a man and maybe we could just sing that song Here's my cup Lord I lift it up to thee amen oh here's my cup Lord I lift it up come and quit this thirsting of my soul [Music] Bread

morning to be here and to be in his presence and amen and good to be a Christian today amen I know it's cold and maybe I think what they'd call a little gloomy on the outside but I believe the resurrection of the sunlight of his presence is shining bright this morning in the house of God Amen I heard the prophet God say one time he said I see the reflection of his resurrection upon the church and we're thankful to see that this morning amen we greet you all today in the name of the Lord that musicians can be dismissed I I want to hold my special for after if that's okay we sure want

brother to brother sister to sister husband the wife and godly ordering we would just approach the throne of Mercy this morning how many would say Lord just visit with us one more time today almighty God your word is true and Lord your promises are more real to us this morning more than they've ever been before fathers we have set this week in these meetings Lord and heard promise after promise after promise of the Rapture unfolded Lord father it's been more than an education it's been more than Lord a sermon it's been more than an intellectual Gathering but Lord I believe the fire of the Holy Ghost has burned across this building this week and Lord It's burned things out of each and every one of our Lives Lord maybe things laying there that we didn't even know was laying there but your word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and no matter what Avenue or channel that you would see fit to bring that word Lord when it reaches its destination it never fails in its Mission it always accomplishes that which it's set forth to do so this morning Father As We Gather here today we are not standing here with a question mark over our hearts we're not standing here with guesses in our lives but Lord we're standing here with an absolute confidence in our spirits and our soul that your word will accomplish that at which you've sent it forth to do even right here this morning in this meeting and Lord as the Believers have laid their hands upon one another father there is a sign here this morning of unity Lord not not division Lord but Unity laid hands upon each other father now Lord your word said they shall lay hands on the sick it didn't say the seventh angel or the faithful Ministry only but it said they and they is the people the believer so Lord we are fulfilling your commission to this generation and we are laying our hands upon one another and we are binding every Spirit of hell we are binding every Spirit of of misunderstanding and ever spirited we're trying to hinder this meeting oh God I pray that your spirit of the Living God would drive it back to the hill that it came out of and Lord that a liberty could come father we're binding sicknesses and bodies it will try to hinder the Believers from receiving from your word this morning Lord your Believers are exercising their Commission Now father may you bless them this morning bless us abundantly father Lord open our hearts and may we receive that which would be beneficial to us this morning and father we pray a special blessing upon our assembly here our pastor Lord all their efforts and labors this week to be a part of these meetings and sacrifices they've made Lord may you restore him a hundred before Lord may you give back everything and more that they'd give out Lord we pray you bless your servant brother Wayne this morning there minister in Ohio May you give him strength in his body father is he has poured out his heart to us here this week bless your bride around the world in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the believer says a man amen The Book of Luke the 19th Chapter and the 41st verse the Bible said when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou hadest known even now at least in this day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are HID from thine eyes for the day shall come upon thee that thy enemy shall cast a trench about thee incapacity round and keep thee on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another I want you to catch this because thou knowest not the time of thy visitation because thou knowest not the time of thy visitation in the book of First Peter the second chapter I want to look at one verse there uh that verse brother Terry has always stood out to me that they didn't know their time of visitation I'm thankful that there's a bride here today that knows her time a visitation first Peter the second chapter and the 12th verse Peter here writing says having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evil doers they may by your good works which they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation that they may glorify God in the day of visitation we ask the Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word is you can have your seats here this morning amen we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God Amen I want to by the help of the Lord just to take a few moments here with you in the scripture and I want to speak to you on a thought if the Lord would help me I want to pull my text here out of a a prayer of the prophet of God and the message the uncertain sound how many is thankful that we've heard a certain sound in this generation brother remember says heavenly father I pray the father I pray the prayer for them with all my heart father I give them to you he says they are trophies of the message he says they are trophies of your visitation being here tonight seeing you walk among us doing works that has never been done since the foundation nation of the world until these last days he says here they are they are your children now I commend them to you Lord that you give them to us and we give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ watch over them and raise them up at the last day I may never be able to shake their hands on this Earth but when the battle is over how many thankful that the battle is almost over but when the battle is over and the last trumpet is sounded and the dead has risen from the grave and the lives have been called up together with them to meet the Lord in the air then may I have fellowship with Jesus Christ and them around the throne and through the Eternal ages to come granted Lord they are yours in the name of Jesus Christ my amen what a powerful Revelation to think that God would allow a prophet to pray a prayer of blessing over the Church of the Living God and I want to speak to this one and on that thought of trophies of his visitation trophies amen of his visitation I don't know maybe how that you see yourself this morning but I do not see you as just church members I do not see you as just friends or family or brothers and sisters but I actually see you the way a prophet saw you and he saw you as a trophy of the visitation amen of the message of the hour in this generation now when you start thinking about this you've got to realize amen that we're living in a day and time that where things are being done in this age that has not been done since the foundation of the world Listen amen you go all the way back to the days of Abraham and not since the days of Abraham had a man been born on the face of the Earth amen with a with a a natural bird amen and stand there and discern the thoughts and intents of the heart amen but in this generation amen another man born of a natural desire would stand up on the platform thousands of times and would discern amen not just the very thoughts or the intent but would begin to go into details in a doctor worthiest and he said this and he looked like this amen see what that was that was not the man William Branham amen that was not amen at church that was not a denomination amen but that was Elohim that was making a visitation Amen to this generation but he was not visiting us with another idea he was not visiting us with a better opinion amen but his visitation was his personal presence amen that was coming up on the earth to fulfill amen the promises of his word I love what job says in job 10 12 he said thou Hast granted me life and favor amen and thy visitation has preserved my spirit amen now has granted me life and favor and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit David says in Psalms 102 verse 13 He said Thou shalt rise and have mercy up on Zion now you know amen that Zion in the Bible is a type of the Bride amen so Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon the bride for the time to favor her amen yay the set time is come listen amen this is the age when God has sent a message to tell you that you're not coming into favor you're not going to be favored amen but before you ever broke the womb of an Earthly mother amen there was a chain seed of life on the inside of you listen amen the reason the devil can't curse you is because God blessed you before the foundation of the world Amen there is a favor upon this church I tell you the reason we're shouting we're not shouting because of good music we're not dancing because of emotion we are rejoicing and we are worshiping because the time Amen to favor the Bride of Jesus Christ has came up on the earth and the age that we're living in amen this is not the visitation of William Branham this is not the visitation of Andrew Glover this is not the visitation of Wayne Lawson or Son Martin or any other preacher this is the visitation amen of the Mighty God Amen the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob come amen has visited this generation and his vision was not unannounced his visit was not unrecognized I know the world missed it amen denominations rejected it but there was a little faith woman on the earth that was anointed to recognize that this is not just a healing campaign this is not just a seven-day convention this is not just a Revival amen but this is the breaking forth of the Eternal Word of almighty God and the age we're living in brother sent me the fire of God Begin to Fall May the power reach down and pick up the people and shake them Lord and let them realize that this is the day of their visitation this is the time that the Lord has said this is the time of their healing this is the day of your visitation this is the set time of Psalms 103. this is the time that healing has come to this generation now you know the prophet tells us every generation receives a visit meditation right every generation receives a visitation we're thanking our kind Heavenly Father amen for this great visitation in our generation that we're living in now amen to see things come to pass another place acts of the Holy Spirit 1954 I thank thee tonight for the Holy Ghost how many is thankful for the Holy Ghost I thank thee tonight for the Holy Ghost and for the visitation of him right here in this building and even right here now listen the very Spirit according to the word of God which is infallible and cannot fail The Same Spirit that raised Jesus from the grave is right here in our midst now oh brother that shout Mateo right there the same spirit that raised Jesus from the grave is right here in this building right now amen to do the same thing that he did when he went in the grave of Jesus Christ you say what did he do when he went the grave he didn't leave him in condition that he was in he didn't leave him bound up behind a tomb amen but he brought life into him he meant the time to favor him had come I'm on church amen I know right now some of you all are buried under problems you're buried under work pressure you're buried under all kinds of pressure amen but the same spirits and raised our Lords from the dead has returned to this generation in the form of a prophetic message listen this time he's not saying Lazarus come forth he's saying Bride come forth amen Church of the Living God that's got for DNA the genomes the chemistry the very thoughts of God manifested in flesh he's calling for a resurrection by his visitation amen The Same Spirit somebody say the same Spirit now think about the same spirit that went in the grave is in this building brother Terry The Same Spirit that went in the grave went in this building today he said what spirit is that it's the spirit of Romans 8 and 11 if the Same Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead would dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you then the spirit's visitation was not temporary but when it visited it was going to take residency y'all ever had somebody come visit you and you didn't know when they was going home I mean they come for one or two nights amen and two weeks later they're still there you know he's thinking when y'all gonna go home when are you going to go back amen do you see what it is this is not a visitation that we're anxiously awaiting his departure this is a visitation that he has taken a habitation in The Souls of humanity and we are not waiting his departure we are waiting our departure we are not waiting for him to go we're waiting to go with him I'm on church amen what you felt in these meetings this weekend brother it's been real it's been more than just a sermon it's been more than just a feeling it has been the Dynamics of God Amen dropping on the church and about the time we start closing our heart Sister Janice starts thinking you know why because that presence is lifting but a Vindicated Prophet saying don't you worry church one of these days that President's going to lift and when it lives you're going to go with it what are you saying I'm saying stay in the battle stay in the greatest panel ever fall but this visitation has put you in condition to change from mortality to immortality they said I'm going to preach if every devil in hell tries to shut me down I'm going to preach the favorite spirit and Hell tries to back me up this morning this is not a visitation of a man it's the visitation of Elohim in this generation [Applause] what are you saying I'm saying we're not waiting on him to leave we want him to stay anybody ready to entertain his presence we're not waiting on him to leave we want him to stay the prophet said I want you to see we know what it done for him but I want you to see not will it has done the same for you oh God what it did for him it's not going to do for you it's already done it see it's the quickening power of the Holy Ghost now at first every minute time that I believe Amen to realize the seriousness of the visitation of God I believe right now is the time to do it I think your first ever been a time to forget everything a man taught concerning the scriptures and remember what a Vindicated Prophet saying now is the time to do it we are not going to take the Rapture by opinions we are not going to take the Rapture by feelings we are not going to take the Rapture by sensation but we will take the Rapture by the word and it won't be any kind of word it'll be Vindicated manifested thoroughly identified word amen the gospel that's being preached amen is like it was in the days of Noah it's fanaticism to the world but it's glorious and welcome to those who are willing to come in to the Ark of Safety which is Christ so the Ark of Safety to the church amen is Christ I pray you'll forgive me for this raspy voice but but you give me some Grace to preach this morning amen amen amen the Ark of Safety is the Gospel of Jesus Christ so I want to pull something from another prayer remember it says in token 63 he says if there's a seed anywhere that is predestinated Lord to hear the word of this last day may they come now sweetly and humbly and lay there and lay their trophies down at the cross or their self as a trophy that's what he's saying will they lay their trophies down at the cross or they'll lay their self down as a trophy he said of the grace of God wow that's called them and may they be filled with the Holy Spirit and display the token of the life of Jesus Christ in his resurrection as long as they remain here on the earth so we have just turned the corner amen from a trophy being a physical object Amen to the human being amen being the trophies of the greats of almighty god listen I don't know what you think about yourself amen but look you're a trophy of the grace of God I don't know what you think brother Mark amen but you are a trophy of the grace of God I know sometimes we get in our mind that we're not worth much and we're not very valuable and we can't do anything to benefit anybody amen but that is a lying Spirit from the piss of Hell amen if God placed a seed on the inside of your soul amen that did not come from your family it came from Jesus Christ amen and he called you according to his grace in the age that you're living in may they be a trophy to display the token of the life of Christ in his resurrection as long as they remain on the earth how many knows if you get a trophy it's got to be displayed when you get a trophy amen you know it's amazing people actually spend hundreds of thousands of dollars they meant to build trophy cases to display their trophies you know why because nobody gets a trophy and hides it in the closet somewhere nobody gets a trophy and buries it underneath a bushel nobody gets a trophy brother shamai and it's a shame for anybody to see it but they want the world to see it they want their friends to see it I'm on church and Jesus Christ did not die amen for you to be a trophy of his grace Amen to hide behind the fears and the condemnations and the and the mistakes of your life I'm going to church his victory is greater than your mistakes his victory is stronger than the spirit of condemnation I think it's time for the Church of the Living God to shake off the heaviness and remember we are bought with surprise we are not here trying to make ourselves holy the Holy Ghost in us has made us holy we are not here trying to make ourselves righteous but so aware that we have received as made us righteous in the age that we're living in we are a trophy of the visitation of Jesus Christ I think we all this morning just go ahead and break out and raise our hands and stomp our feet and clap our hands and say devil I am not here as a condemned church member I am not here hanging under the past of my life and the sins of my family but I have been set free by the blood of Jesus Christ I got a seed inside of me I've recognized my day I recognize Sister Janet if anybody got a rise Amen to pick up a tambourine and Shout that devil down the trophies of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's got a right to praise God we shouldn't be here we should be in a grave this morning but God who is rich in Mercy said Elohim into this generation to call our families and to call our sons and to call our daughters I'm on you couldn't do it but he could you could raise yourself up out of all the guilt and condemnation and baggage of your past and baggage of your family and baggage of this situation but there was a God who could so you're a trophy then don't be ashamed of this play what God has done for you if he heals your cancer don't be ashamed to stand and say he healed me a Cancer and he opens your blinded eyes don't be ashamed to stand there and say open my blinded eyes if he come in the military and got a hold of you and give you a family and give your home don't be ashamed to stand there on a Sunday morning in the house of God and displayed to a lost and kind world that Jesus Christ the son of God is still in the saving business he's still in the healing business he's stealing the delivering business because he's God he's God are you hearing me what is a trophy a trophy is something gained or achieved or given in Victory listen or consequent especially when preserved a trophy is a victory that becomes preserved what did job say he said thy visitation has preserved my spirit amount I know what you're thinking right now you're thinking that Devil's going to take it away from me but can I ask you something how can the devil take something away from you that he didn't give you I know how can the devil take something away from you that he didn't give you he did not give you that victory in the house of God in that service so don't you let that lion devil take it from you he did not give you that family he did not give you that testimony so don't you back up and let that devil take it from you it's just something that's gained it's something achieved it's given in Victory or Conquest especially when preserved or mounted as a memorial a representation of such a memorial as on a medal I love this it is a game animal or it is a fish that is suitable for mounting as a trophy I love this part it is usually used attributively oh God I feel like preaching this morning it is usually used attributively then tell me what is the root word of attributively the root word of attributedly is attribute now the prophet said amen have I showed you this way there is something amen that a trophy is it is an expressed attribute of victory a trophy is an expressed attribute of Victory the public said Christ the mystery God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something he was trying and was going to achieve what does a trophy represent a trophy represents amen and achievement of a conquest and it's a victory so he was going to achieve something and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed think about this Amen in him was all these attributes but brother Maurice there was nothing Amen to display or to manifest the effect of those attributes that was in him as long as there was just Angels he could say I'm a savior and the angels could say you're a savior he could say I'm a Healer brother Joe and the angels could say You're A Healer he could say no I'm a deliverer and the angels could say you are a deliverer but see they were expressing that amen not by experience not by battle amen not by not by a war but they were expressing that just because they were angels and he was God but in the end time there would be some sons and daughters that would be worshiping God and they would not just be saying yes you're a savior and yes you are a Healer and yes you are a deliverer but they would actually be saying I know you're a savior because you saved me I know you're a Healer because you healed me I know you're a deliverer because you delivered me so they would become trophies that would be expressing the victory of his attribute my there wasn't even a moon a star a molecule an atom or anything he was God so in his great mind he wanted to these attributes to be expressed and in him was love in him was to be a father in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior and him was to be a Healer all these great attributes we see already expressed they was in God among sister hope you know what you've done you pulled out of God what he already was come on now you did not put it in God it was already in him your face pulled it out of him I love what the prophet said he said and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as the Son of God he said but now you are expressed after his word has come in you Amen to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son and a daughter of God so therefore the word of God has lit our souls what does that word lit mean it means to set on fire I preach that to you in the temp meeting and then that word lit means to set something on fire it means to strike something and the result of the Striking is the burning of what has been struck o Church of the Living God I don't believe here this week we've been struck by just pictures I don't believe we've just been struck by sermons I don't believe we just been struck by songs amen but I believe the same Pillar of Fire that climbed its way in the upper room has to send it in this church brother Jr and we have been struck amen by the Dynamics of God we are not on fire with a Creed we are not on fire with a ritual we are not on fire with her religion we are burning Judah with the authority and the power of the message of the hour in the age that we're living in when the word of God lit our souls we come from time beings into Immortal beings and the god of Heaven is in us and he's crying at my father my God my God In my Father's house now anybody want to agree with me that where Jesus says there's a lot of noise where Jesus is two of you do where Jesus is there's a lot of noise right amen now watch this but remember said see the heavens will pass away with a great noise did you notice here Heavens will pass away listen the whole earth will be on fire and it will ignite the gases that's in the earth and we'll explode it the Bible said Peter said that the heavens will pass away and the Earth with a great noise such an explosion will rock it oh my because it's got to kill every disease every thistle every Thorn I'm gonna Church whatever was not in the Garden of Eden will not survive the fiery baptism of the Holy Fire of God that is coming upon this Earth to put this Earth and condition for a king and a bride to Reign upon it in the Millennium now watch this he said see amen watch at the Millennium to Reign upon it as their inheritance he will take her away and he will renovate this Earth which is your home by a holy fire such an explosion will rock it it'll kill every disease among that that devil of disease that has plagued your body has got a time limit on it that devil that has plagued your mind has got a time limit on it every disease every Thorn every thistle everything there is to be done the fire will burn it up remember it's not all together just a literal fire it's also a holy fire see that will take away Satan and all of his Devils then what we've experienced here this week amen is a pre-figure of the Holy Fire of God that is coming upon this Earth but listen we didn't see a literal fire this week but there was a holy fire that has been burning from the front to the back from the left to the right what is that fire doing it is burning away everything to put you in position as the Bride of Jesus Christ to leave this earth some morning between six and nine both heavens and earth will pass away killing all the terms all the insects all the natural life on it amen even the H2O the water will explode think of it he said talk about a noise you think that little noise out here in Tucson was something when he opened the six seals That Shook the country round about caused the talk you just wait till the Earth receives her baptism I'm on church it's coming to her the bride the Bride is a pre-figure of what's coming to the Earth it's coming to her she will receive a baptism of fire which will put her back into original condition now I I just want to show you here for a second when you start talking about trophies it's a beautiful study through the message if you go in there and start looking at the word trophy you will find that brother Brandon many times amen will begin to answer amen or he will begin to discuss trophies but he won't do it when he's preaching sister Jana he'll do it when he's actually praying he'll say like this they are trophies of this meeting they are trophies of this message they are trophies of the presence of the Lord they are trophies of the grace of God they are trophies of the spirit of Grace you are a trophy of this revival you are the trophy of the love of Christ at Calvary you are a trophy of the Gospel that has been preached you are a trophy of the word being made manifest that has been preached by the spirit of the Lord You Are trophies of the message the evening light so he is just brother he has just changed amen what you are into what he sees you but he's not seeing you that way through your former life he's seeing you that way through the baptism of the fire of God that has renovated you so that a holy God could dwell in your life when brother Branham refers to Trophies he's not talking about physical objects such as metal or gold he is speaking amen of people now can I show you a few scriptures that brother man I'm in the message will connect trophies to in John 5 24 he'll say I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it's passed from Death unto life right there is a scripture he connects a trophy to John 6 37 all the father has given me amen shall come to me and him that cometh to me will I know Wise cast out that is a scripture he has connected you as say trophy too in John 10 28 I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man plucked him out of my hand amen My Father which give them to me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand remember said the trophies of your word he said they are trophies of your word that condemned their sinful life and they've come up to accept you as their personal savior so it was not brother Doug William Branham condemning their sinful life it was the word that he was preaching was condemning their sinful life and at the same time brother Matthew that the word was condemning their sinful life it was transforming them into an attribute of God an expressed attribute to manifest the victory of God in the age that we're now living I love what he says I claim their life in the name of Jesus Christ I want to meet them on the other side when they're Immortal turn back to young men and women again young and lovely forever they are yours father they are trophies amen that God has given to his son Christ Jesus by the power of His presence and the word of God think about this church the message of the hour has claimed you to be more than a message preacher it is claimed you to be more than a message singer or a message Pastor or a message evangelist or or whatever position you hold Let Me Go a step further and say the message is claimed you to be more than just a member of this church this message has claimed you it is proclaims on you as the trophies of the grace of God can you say Amen can I have a few more minutes he said I claim them for you tonight Jesus as your own personal treasure as Jim's in your crown as members of your bride I claim their lives I love what he says in the Sixth Seal he say may every call Child of God that's in hearing distance of here or either the tape shall strike May at that time I claim them in them for the kingdom of God upon the basis of knowing this the word that's being revealed come on Church the word that's being revealed is more than a sermon it is a claim the word you're here as you're hearing the word being revealed it is Clay oh god brother Amos as you're hearing the word being revealed the revealed word is claiming your body for its manifestation among church when you hear the promises of healing being preached and they're being revealed those promises are claiming your physical body for their manifestation let me go and say it you didn't claim this message this message claimed you you didn't claim the evening lights they even the light claimed you you did not claim the visitation of Elohim but Elohim visited this generation for one purpose and that was to claim everyone the father had been given foreign for a minute come in this prayer line last night amen few months ago over in the tent meeting amen you remember brother Sean come out to us in the meeting amen said I've been set free I've been set free now you know as a preacher you're thinking what was you set free of a sickness or something cause that's about all you hear now he said no I've been set free of Babylon I've been set free of the nomination I've been set free of false man go ahead and raise your hand says you might as well amen she's a trophy of the message listen I didn't know her until we started talking about this message but for message that was being preached was doing more than just causing her to shout but it was claiming her body for the Fulfillment of Revelation 18 4 come out of her my people what are you saying preacher I'm saying your mind is real Shake loose and recognize you I'll have a chance you have been claimed by the claiming grip of almighty God for your body to be a fulfillment of the revealed word as the word becomes revealed that word Mariah is claiming your body for its fulfillment I'm on church he said somebody was going to overcome devils and the revealed word has claimed your body for its fulfillment he said somebody was going to speak in new tongues they were going to see Visions they were going to shout they were going to experience the blessings of the presence of Jesus Christ Alone he's not going to raise up rocks to do it but he's going to take a message and he's going to claim 16 elements and out of those elements he's going to manifest the promises of this refilled word you might as well Rejoice you've done been claimed you can run but you can't hide come on I don't devil a bitterness wants to claim your life for its fulfillment but there is a God here who then claims you to manifest forgiveness through you are claimed on accident you were claimed by purpose on purpose for a purpose you didn't know you was going to preach me this morning will you just claim to own a purpose by a purpose for a purpose oh what are you saying I'm saying the message has claimed you to be a trophy the message has claimed your flesh to be a trophy of its power oh God what was in the back part of God's mind is now before me and his bride are not just church members I know these things are simple but help me you are not just church members you got to realize the revealed word is claiming you when I heard him say that brother brother Sean it done something to me it was not William Branham claiming us come on church amen do you want to talk about playing tapes let's talk about playing tapes you ought to be playing tapes well last Sunday morning we might as well preach at me brother Tim you'll ought to be playing tapes I don't think tapes ought to be a foreign thing because the prophet said as they hear those tapes the word that's being revealed is claiming them for his fulfillment but here's where I got an issue with that is you lay aside a faithful Ministry and begin to promote just playing tapes what you're telling me is God don't have enough power Amen to keep a man's life clean just stand In a Pulpit and preach the word of God but I happen to believe the reason that man is preaching is because the Revelation that he was hearing on those tapes amen was claiming his body for the Fulfillment of the peace inspired Amen to stand there and to rightly divide the word of truth that it would be an idiotic Haitian and by that revealing identification to the church would bring a people to a state of perfection what do you saying I'm saying it here and abroad preach the word preachers preach it with everything that's within you if you've got to stand by yourself and stand on a rock say what a prophet said and watch the Dynamics of the revealing of the son of man come in the church and manifest his power manifest its anointing Manifest this life we are not dead trophies we are living trophies come on Church you're a trophy you're a walking billboard of God's success in humanity now that's a mouthful in it think about that sister Faith you are walking billboard of God's success in humanity my baby said he's only doing these things to claim his own now he said if it manifests itself you're on the platform before you will you believe it he said will you repent of your sins and disbelief the hour of visitation is drawn near listen don't push back I'm not trying to preach against you I'm just preaching there's a there's some flesh that's going to be claimed for the words fulfillment listen God did not say Ephesians 5 was good to the seventh age there was no time limit put on it yeah we might as well preach at we the prophet of God said he's only doing these things to confirm his word then I say this every man of God that stands In a Pulpit and preaches this message is confirming the word of God can you say Amen because Jesus said the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works I love what the prophet says now in Jesus in his ministry John 14 12 he said watch I say unto you we spoke of it last night he that believeth on me the works that I do so he do also and More Than This he says watch the word really translated right is more not greater because he raised the dead he stopped nature there was nothing could be any greater than what he did but more than this shall you do for I go to my father do you believe that is the inspired word of God he said do you believe that do you believe that many of the ages to follow on like that it was now the same thing he did Brother Thomas he promised the church to do only more of it than what he did so he did not change brother what the church would be doing he only said what they will be doing will be more than what I did he was not changing the quality of what he did he was changing the quantity of what he did that's why the Bible says in John 21 25 and there are also many other things which Jesus did the which if they should be written everyone I suppose that even the world itself amen could not contain the books that should be written I think it's a powerful thing when the prophet comes along in token and says wish I could testify a little bit now to some things I've seen happen just in the last few weeks see oh what I could testify of it was John that said if all that Jesus done would be putting books there wasn't enough books in the world to write for him just what I'm seen in my own Ministry seen him do you couldn't pile it in the volumes on this platform here if I wrote in detail what I seen him do just in my own Ministry seen him do see he had more success in my Ministry than he did in his home he had more success in my Ministry than he did in his own now remember he had more success now not me he had remember said his fact he said he had more success in Jeffersonville than he did in Nazareth he did why in The Wicked City amen he said because he prayed for poor Miracles but he did there listen he finally broke through here among church that's where the that's where the Prophet was showing you that the Miracles that would be piled into a book amen were coming from they were coming from the visitation of the Holy Ghost in the church The Same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead was visiting this generation and a prophet stood there and said if you can recognize it it'll break through if you can recognize it he will break through listen he was on the platform he was on a prophet a prophet was sinning a prophet was testified a prophet was screaming about it but he just wasn't willing to leave it on a prophet but Timmy was one to put it on the Bride of Jesus Christ and here this morning I can without one reservation say brother Sean what was on a prophet is now on the church what was in the son of man is now in The Bride of Jesus Christ he finally broke through he had more success right here than he did in Nazareth I didn't do it I just didn't I just loved him and submitted myself to him and said what he said and the Holy Spirit went to the other people and they believed what he said and then he done the work oh god of Heaven breakthrough in the Church of the Living God once again oh god of Heaven breakthrough in Faith Tabernacle once again oh god of Heaven breakthrough in our Ministries once again you say what does that break through him to come back is it going to come back a new cookbook is it going to come back some fancy preacher it's going to come by somebody who can stand and appropriate and say what a prophet said and submit themselves to The Sovereign Divine love of almighty God and he will come in the church and he will perform the miracle he will change the situation among Church it wasn't a man it was the visitation of the son of man how many knows the prophet of God goes beyond the curtain of time right he goes beyond the current time 1960 comes back rejected King and tells it I heard a voice that spoke to me in the room and said this is what you preached what was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it there was no jealousy huh I can't get tied down there there was no jealousy there was no tiredness now can I just say this he said there was no jealousy there was no tiredness you realize when you realize it's not a man then you don't have to be jealous when you realize it's not a man's doing it's the doing to the son of man to be jealous is to be jealous of God he said there was no jealousy there there was no tiredness there there was no death there sickness could never enter there mortality could never make you old and they could not cry it was just one Joy oh my precious brother they took me up and set me up on a great big high place and I thought I'm not dreaming I'm looking back at my body laying right down there on the bed and they sent me up here and said oh and I said I shouldn't sit up here listen but you know why he was sitting up there because he didn't put himself there Jesus Christ the son of God put him in that position now listen you may think I've gone a little overboard but I'm going to preach here for a minute and if I got to take a sword by myself I will we will never make brother Branham more than what Jesus Christ made him I know we've had men of God Amen that I don't say men of God we've had preachers maybe they weren't men of God and it put him in a position God never put him in and that's why they fail and they don't go no further but you're looking at one boy that was born race on the back Hills of East Tennessee that as long as I got a Pulpit to stand in I'm not going to fight for what brother so and so believes I'm not going to fight where brother so and so thanks but I am going to say what a prophet who has lifted up out of this generation saying and he's saying amen stay with a word and submit yourself to the Holy Ghost and love and pray and give God the praise well I think that being the devil got out of here we're not crazy people we're the Bride of Jesus Christ here come a man from both sides in just a bloom of Youth and one woman stand there she screamed oh my precious brother we're so happy to see you here I said I don't understand this then that voice was speaking from above me said you know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with her people I said yeah I remember that in the scripture said why this is when you will gather with your people I said then they'll be real and I can feel them oh yes don't you just love this I said well there's Millions but there's not many branhams and that voice said they're not branhams there's your convert that's the ones that you've led to the Lord and said some of them women there you think are so beautiful we're better than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord no wonder they are screaming our precious brother listen and they all screamed at once if you hadn't went we wouldn't be here if you hadn't have went we would not be here okay you want to go to the message with me let's go it's Paradox 1965 a prophet standing there in Phoenix Arizona and says this which this is he's talking about is the message of the hour he said this is the bridge between denomination and the glory land listen without a prophet we did not have a bridge into the future home without a prophet we did not have a bridge into our theosity but God fulfilling his word which sent us sinus angel in this age that would stand between the devil of denomination nation and the glory of the glory land and say come on Church don't try to change it don't try to twist it just get on this message and ride it into the future home write it into the eternities ride it into the millennium it's your ride Church brother

in it the tank has got gas in it it's got good wheels on it it's got ever 16 elements come on church I heard a prophet preach an entire message called it is the rising of the Sun and he said listen

be judged this Paul had to be judged they said yes amen they'll be judged she said well then I've preached every word that they preach I never defeated oh God I feel the preacher coming on right now I never deviated one time to the side of the other were they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I did too where they taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too whatever they taught I did too and the people screamed and said we know that we know we're going with you someday amen back to Earth I'm on church amen they were in the sixth Dimension waiting for the Sabbath to mention amen and for a millennial Reign and when that was over they would come back onto an Earth come on Church it would come back on the earth that had been renovated not by literal fire amen but holy fire and listen what

take that out of me enough troubles and pressures and Ministry problems and family situations and sicknesses and problems to take that out of me how I seen it shalom shalom I'm not a crazy man I've seen it you say brother it must be good to see it here's a beautiful thing I'll tell you why I'm shouting I'm shouting just because I'm not the only one that seen it I'm shouting because I'm preaching to a Congregation of people that's been laying in the presence of the Sun and they've been ripening underneath her teachings of the seventh angel and what a prophet saw we're seeing I see it he said brother Brandon will go in on what you told I did too I told everything they taught and then people screamed and said we know that and we know we're going back with you someday to the Earth I said Jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preached us y'all forgive me I found the little details in these quotes he said and if you are accepted at that time notice what they said which you will be they went over there up one day and down the next said we know you'll be accepted and here's what they said then you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry [Music] listen I know they say you're a fanatic they say we're a little too overboard on this message but here's what I say I'm a trophy I can't help it you're looking at one boy right here that is your trophy of what William random talked listen I I'm not ignorant I haven't forgot where I come from [Music] told somebody the other day I said in the meeting somewhere I don't remember I was at where I was at but I said I got a beautiful wife sitting back there holding a beautiful baby they said I'm not ignorant enough to realize the reason I've got that is cause of this message [Music] the favor of God hear this crazy preacher again but you hear this you dedicate yourself to this message [Music] and God will open the womens of Heaven and he'll bless you he'll bless you how can you back something that's blessed to not be blessed yourself foreign ER you're talking about material things oh no I'm not I'm talking about the set time to favor has come listen I know people say well we need to be preaching Basics and we do preach basics well we need to be preaching the Holy Ghost what have you heard this week and then they say well we don't need to hear all this the bride the bride you're the bride you're the bride well brother Sean I'm just dumb enough to look in the scriptures and say well the Bible says to set time to favor the bride has come why not say it this is the time to say it this is the time to preach it time's almost up [Music] if I've got an important message to give brother Sean Martin and I say brother Sean meet me at Cracker Barrel imagine that give me a cracker bro at nine o'clock I got a message for you and I show up at 10 15. walk in and just stand there and scream a message out that message was no you got a brand new yacht down on the ocean whatever and I go in there and scream Sean Martin you gotta you got a gift it's here he's not there the time's over it's up I'll scream all day long there's nothing to benefit listen friends you don't realize we're on the threshold of Revelation 11 being fulfilled and two witnesses taken this gospel back to the to the hundred forty four thousand if there's ever been a time to scream what a prophet said Now's the Time to do it you know why because you couldn't scream this 50 years ago there wasn't ears to hear it there wasn't eyes to see it there wasn't a heart to believe it but now there's a bride with all of our faults and all of our failures or the mark and all of our mistakes but there's a bride and she's got ears to hear and she's got eyes to see and she's got a heart to believe and she's got a body to manifest than it first ever been a time to scream out what a prophet said now's the set time to do it because there's actually a people on the Earth in position to manifest it I say you may preach 15 sermons on one subject and feel like you're getting nowhere but keep on preaching it because one day that body under the you will guide us to him and all together we'll go back on the earth to live forever said I looked at him and said do I have to return back do I have to return back they said yes you do but keep pressing on Church is this the last service of these January meetings tomorrow night or Tuesday nighter we got to go back I've had a little change here for a week I go back to a regular routine with what you've heard keep pressing home remember I said when he come back he said I'm more determined Now by that visitation than I've ever been before friends I don't know how else to say it but after this week listen we've been we've been having these meetings what four years now been powerful services but there's been a shift in the atmosphere this week There's been an element change I'm more determined now to preach this message to go in a rapture to walk like Enoch than I've ever been before than I've ever been because I got another witness here I'm more determined than I've ever been I'm gonna ride on what he talked with Amos I'm way over time y'all forgive me I told Junior and telling the guys last night I said I'm gonna pull an old school one out in the morning preach 45 minutes and close out I do tell the truth you ever heard Batman when he goes beyond the curtain of time and he said when I got there he was about 18 years old she come running to me I think it's broke down there at your church of the day when I was preaching brother Jordan on that immortality he said I saw her she wasn't young child she was an 18 year old she looked at me and said on Earth I was your little Sharon Rose step back he said well you're a you're a grown young lady he said yes she said yes daddy now I want to connect something here can I have just a minute to do it bro bam shouldn't be on the current time he said he said they were going on what I taught on my teaching right he said Sharon Rose looked at me and she said brother Branham he said rather she looked at him I'm paraphrasing she all forgive me but she said I'm not a child no more I'm an 18 year old young lady he said the last time I saw her she was in a hospital room he said Don in a feeble condition as a child and now she's over here remember said she looked at him and said Daddy don't you remember what you taught on immortality [Music] I really feel like cutting up right now Branson don't you remember what you taught on immortality I got to pond on that brother Sean brother when she left the Earth she hadn't sat in the future home he didn't set in things that aren't to be she she didn't get in the backseat with Billy Paul and Rebecca and ride down the road and brother random read the church you hear the church age book read and say read that over she didn't shed through all those meetings but she looked at him and she said Daddy what you told an immortality they believe it over here I thought oh God I'm living in the only place that they don't believe what a prophet taunts this is the only place they don't believe in a future home in a Rapture and things in theophany but there is a land beyond the river there is a bridge between denomination and the glory land and over there if a prophet called it they shout about it because they are the manifestation of what a prophet told in the revelation of the word in this age do you love him today ride on it Church it'll get you there let's bow our hearts together this morning ride on it right on this meetings right on this message ride on it you're a trophy it'll get you there [Music] will there be one here today you can say I wanna I wanna rededicate myself to a message I want to dedicate myself again to this message I want to dedicate myself to what a prophet taught I know we got several men of God here today ministering brothers and I say God bless you say for your life and your ministry I want to dedicate myself more to what a prophet taught than ever before let the influence let the influence of that teachings of immortality those things let it let it break on my life

my ear [Music] forward I move forward Heavenly Father Lord our hearts are a bit are a bit sad this morning to think that this is our last service in these glorious tremendous meetings that you've given us but Lord the flesh may be a little tired Spirit may be a little weary but Lord there's something on our souls as I looked across this congregation this morning and father I'm not ignorant I know that after several several several Services the bodies get tired the bodies get weird weary but Lord there was a fire in their souls Lord Lord that that fire that caused him to push over on tiredness push Beyond heaviness and allow the visitation of the son of man to break out on the people father that is the same push that is the same energy that is the same energizing spirit that one day is going to keep on moving us and moving us and moving us and one day that thing's going to cause immortality to break out on this body we're already on the influence of the teaching of it now father I pray as your Prophet said that day when I realized I had to go back down to Earth again he said as I was leaving coming back to my body he said I thought oh I don't want to leave do I have to leave and they said yes you do but Press On father if I could say anything today to be a blessing of these people may they hear my heart Press On press on Young People Press on ministers press on

meetings January and and I think they have we've uh you know uh you usually when it's kind of hard to get things going for one and uh when you start a meeting and then you have an influx of people in and out that maybe haven't been all the way through the meetings and and so when they come you know it's almost like they need to get revived and and it just kind of drags but you know every service has been Dynamic and the Lord has just moved in such a special way and have spoke personally I believe to every heart and uh and you you that have come to to visit to be a part of it you you've come with the same eagerness that we as a church have here and that is to hear the word of God and to be part of something that God is doing amen and so thank you once again for coming it's now we've as I've said earlier we're going to be dismissing to the local folks we're going to be dismissing a Wednesday night service and resume service next Sunday 11 o'clock and we do have a meal that we're going to have and and we had announced that that it would be uh at a hotel but actually it's just going to be right across the street and so if you'd like to stay eat Fellowship we'd certainly love to have you and so again it's just right across the street there will be the second turn to the left I believe that's how it is just go right across the street and don't turn the second or the first turn left go to the second and it'll take you up to a Red Barn up that way and a lot of food there so uh just follow the your nose the smell is good amen so we want to keep brother Andrew in our prayer at
