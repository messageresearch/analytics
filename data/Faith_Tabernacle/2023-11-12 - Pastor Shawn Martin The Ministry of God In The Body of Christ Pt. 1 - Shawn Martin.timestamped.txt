[46:55] and and um around Believers you know we
[47:00] um every day that you know we're we're
[47:03] rubbing shoulders with the world and and
[47:05] you
[47:06] know that's the only way we can be a
[47:08] light to people you know uh is that way
[47:12] but when we come together as Believers
[47:14] it's just good to have a fellowship
[47:18] around the Saints of like Precious
[47:22] Faith believe the same way that you know
[47:25] we all know that the Lord is coming and
[47:29] we're looking forward to his coming
[47:31] and
[47:33] um we were took Heather out for a
[47:39] birthday Friday night I think and and um
[47:43] we went to that Japanese place there in
[47:46] U ronoke and um so where you know this
[47:50] where they cook in front of you and
[47:52] looking right across you know was a um
[47:56] transgender cross dresser whatever you
[47:59] want to call it and
[48:02] um which you know that's up to them
[48:05] whatever but
[48:08] um uh Heather and Ruth went to the
[48:10] restroom and that guy walked in that
[48:13] restroom and
[48:15] uh it's all I could do just all I could
[48:19] do but I got to thinking about that how
[48:22] nice it is just to be around
[48:24] levers
[48:26] and uh you know it's uh you know it's
[48:31] it's it's coming it's getting worse and
[48:33] worse by the moment and by the day and
[48:36] tell you what we ought to just keep
[48:40] together just keep together keep our
[48:42] young people together and keep in
[48:45] Fellowship amen and and no wonder Satan
[48:48] fights us so hard to try to pull us away
[48:51] and draw us this way and that way and
[48:54] but stay together
[48:56] amen cuz we we need one another don't we
[48:59] amen so you know and and we certainly
[49:03] pray for them type of people that God
[49:06] will um help them in some way you know
[49:10] and um I you know I just listened to
[49:13] brother brandom how it's just he he said
[49:15] that people are going insane and that's
[49:18] exactly what people are doing right
[49:20] they're just going insane and so you
[49:23] know we just just thank God that God has
[49:26] brought us to where we're at today it's
[49:28] all we can say and that's that's even as
[49:31] Paul said I am what I am by the grace of
[49:34] God and we should cherish that more and
[49:37] more the book of Ephesians the 4th
[49:40] chapter the first verse we'll start
[49:42] there but it says I therefore the
[49:45] prisoner of the
[49:46] Lord beseech
[49:48] you uh that ye walk worthy of the
[49:51] vocation wherewith you are
[49:54] called with with all loneliness and
[49:56] meekness and with longsuffering
[49:58] forbearing one another in love
[50:01] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[50:03] spirit in the bond of
[50:04] Peace there is one body can you say that
[50:07] with me there is one body and one Spirit
[50:11] even as you are called in one hope of
[50:15] your calling one Lord One Faith one
[50:21] baptism one God and Father of all who is
[50:25] above of all and through all and in you
[50:28] all but unto every one of us is given
[50:31] Grace according to the measure of the
[50:34] gift of Christ wherefore he saith when
[50:37] he ascended up on high he led captivity
[50:41] captive and gave gifts unto men amen
[50:45] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[50:47] prayer
[50:49] father how grateful we are to be able to
[50:53] gather here today
[50:56] Lord as we see more and
[50:59] more the reality of us living in the
[51:02] Sodom and gomorah Lord and the sins of
[51:07] the the world Lord and how the gross
[51:11] darknesses upon the
[51:13] people but father it just humbles us
[51:16] more Lord to know that you've called us
[51:19] to walk in your Marvelous Light and that
[51:22] we are not children of Darkness but
[51:24] we're children of of the light father
[51:27] may we reflect that Lord and may the
[51:31] light become more brighter this morning
[51:34] as you would shine upon us father may
[51:37] your presence just be uh in this place
[51:42] father May the angels of God just uh be
[51:45] by every Pew Lord and father help us
[51:50] Lord just to remove all doubt from us
[51:52] Lord and may we believe May our faith be
[51:55] become more stronger we ask these things
[51:58] in your lovely name Jesus Christ and the
[52:01] church says amen amen amen you can be
[52:11] seated I going to maybe just title this
[52:16] the ministry of God in the body of
[52:20] Christ and um as we read there is one
[52:24] body and one spirit and that body is
[52:29] identified as being the bride of Christ
[52:32] who is going to be raptured out and and
[52:36] I say with any with within days it's
[52:40] just uh and it could be today uh could
[52:43] be any moment but that's how close we
[52:47] are to the coming of the
[52:49] Lord and and so the body of Christ is a
[52:53] gifted body uh because as we read God
[53:03] placed every gift is to be used for
[53:07] edification of the body and is to be
[53:10] operated by The Same Spirit so whatever
[53:13] gift that that uh we have it is the same
[53:17] spirit that operates it uh uh in each
[53:21] and
[53:22] everyone and the gifts are for the work
[53:24] of the min Ministry and so God still has
[53:28] a Ministry and uh that is fulfilling his
[53:31] purpose in uh today and this this again
[53:35] this ministry operates within the body
[53:38] of of Christ and so um you know we've
[53:43] read this um but he said to have one of
[53:46] the gifts outside of the body it would
[53:48] do you no good in another place he said
[53:51] see there is no Fellowship outside of
[53:54] the body of Jesus Christ you can't have
[53:56] fellowship with God no wonder people
[53:59] don't believe in Divine Healing no
[54:00] wonder they can't believe in
[54:02] oldfashioned God sent Revival no wonder
[54:05] they can't believe in these things that
[54:07] cleans a man's
[54:09] heart and we could even just say no
[54:11] wonder they're allowing you know the
[54:13] homosexuals and transgenders and no
[54:16] wonder no wonder they're allowing the
[54:19] the things of that that's totally
[54:21] against God's laws is because they're
[54:24] out of fellowship with God their their
[54:27] only Fellowship is in the body of Christ
[54:30] and it's not at Faith Tabernacle it's
[54:32] within the body and the body is made up
[54:34] of a universal uh uh people it's is
[54:38] people from all over the world ain't
[54:39] that right but it takes being in the
[54:42] body of Christ and so in the body of
[54:45] Christ then you are subject to every
[54:48] gift uh that has been placed within and
[54:53] and so brother brandham says see Christ
[54:56] he he sets the members in the body he
[54:59] endows them with their Ministries and he
[55:02] puts the gifts at her disposal amen uh
[55:07] uh disposal so so e every everyone that
[55:11] is in the body of Christ is subject to
[55:14] gifts you you're you you've got a
[55:16] Ministry you've got something to do and
[55:19] and all of these things but it's not
[55:21] that we focus on our gifts uh that's
[55:25] that's not the the point um um because
[55:29] brother brandom says God uh a gift will
[55:33] make room for itself and so uh I find
[55:36] you know that if if men are called young
[55:38] men that are called to preach then they
[55:40] they they want they want to go just
[55:42] preach preach preach preach preach or
[55:44] they've got an idea of how they want to
[55:46] preach you know they'll look at a a
[55:48] young man like brother Andrew that's
[55:50] just going around the world so they want
[55:51] to be just like that you know and but
[55:54] God may have not called him to be that
[55:56] and and so it's not that we focus on the
[55:59] gift I I I I think that or I believe
[56:03] that anyone who is part of the body of
[56:06] course it belongs with has something to
[56:08] do in the ministry of God in some way
[56:11] shape or form and and and all those that
[56:15] are part of that Ministry uh are focused
[56:18] on one thing one thing and that is for
[56:21] the will of God to be done as as Jesus
[56:24] told us he told us to pray thy kingdom
[56:27] come thy will be done in earth as it is
[56:31] in heaven and so then if if and and I
[56:35] believe that's that should be the desire
[56:37] of every member of the body of Christ uh
[56:41] uh and and and in order for his will to
[56:44] be done uh then we have to perform his
[56:48] will uh we we can't depend on on you
[56:51] know the sinner to do the will of the
[56:54] father we we can't depend upon you know
[56:57] the carnal man to do the will of the
[56:59] Father God has has selected us and put
[57:02] us in his body and we all know how we
[57:05] get in the body and that's by one Spirit
[57:07] we're baptized into one body amen see so
[57:11] uh we must do his will John 15:5 Jesus
[57:15] says I am the vine you are the branches
[57:17] and he that abideth in me and I in him
[57:21] the same bringeth forth much fruit for
[57:24] without me you can do nothing and so we
[57:26] see that the vine supplies the energy he
[57:30] the the vine only the prophet says
[57:32] supplies the energy but we as the
[57:35] branches have to do the job amen see so
[57:39] we we being members of his body are to
[57:43] carry out his will it's just like God
[57:46] had a plan for the Messiah uh uh uh when
[57:50] he come uh on the earth and what he
[57:53] would do and it was prophesied in the
[57:55] scriptures as to what he would do what
[57:58] he would be and and these things and the
[58:00] type of ministry that he would have and
[58:03] only Jesus could have fulfilled them
[58:06] scriptures only Jesus could have done
[58:08] that we we find there were other
[58:10] Messiahs that come along before Jesus
[58:12] come and they would lead uh uh people
[58:15] out in the wilderness and they LED them
[58:16] here and they done this and and and and
[58:19] they all perished they they all perished
[58:21] because there was only one Messiah that
[58:24] could fulfill the will of God because
[58:27] along with the Prophecies of what the
[58:30] Messiah would do God had Jesus Christ in
[58:33] mind to fulfill that do you believe that
[58:36] and so others tried to be Messiah but
[58:38] they were proven to be
[58:40] impersonators and and so there was only
[58:42] one Messiah that could fulfill uh the
[58:45] will of God brother brandham said every
[58:48] move every place he went everything he
[58:50] did every word he spoke had a meaning to
[58:53] it and was EX exactly in harmony with
[58:57] God and the will of God Amen so then
[59:02] then we find that God had a a plan for
[59:04] the uh you know the Forerunner uh of the
[59:06] first coming of Christ and and it was
[59:09] written in the scriptures uh uh what he
[59:12] would do and what he would be and the
[59:14] type of ministry he would have and and
[59:17] only John the Baptist could fulfill that
[59:19] there was no one it didn't matter how
[59:21] many wanted to to introduce Messiah
[59:25] only John could have fulfilled them
[59:28] scriptures but he had to fulfill them in
[59:30] order for the will of God to be
[59:33] fulfilled he had to be the way he was he
[59:35] had to do what he did in order to
[59:37] fulfill scriptures for he was the
[59:40] Forerunner that God had predestinated so
[59:43] his ministry fulfilled the word of God
[59:46] it wasn't just running out here amen
[59:48] doing whatever amen but but the ministry
[59:52] his ministry matched Pro prophecy that's
[59:55] can you say amen and and so then we find
[59:58] that even the Apostle Paul said that God
[1:00:01] separated him from his mother's womb and
[1:00:04] called him by his grace and notice he
[1:00:06] said it pleased God to reveal his son in
[1:00:09] me that I might preach him among the
[1:00:12] Heathen amen and and in in Acts 20 and
[1:00:15] 27 Paul says I have not shunned to
[1:00:18] declare unto you all the counsel of God
[1:00:22] so Paul had to put into practice he had
[1:00:26] to perform he had to do in order for
[1:00:29] God's will to be accomplished ain't that
[1:00:32] right amen see and and so he had a
[1:00:35] certain Ministry had a certain and and
[1:00:37] we know that he was the first church age
[1:00:40] messenger he was the a prophet to the
[1:00:42] Gentiles and all these things and so his
[1:00:46] ministry fulfilled what God had called
[1:00:49] him to do and so everyone that is part
[1:00:53] of God's Ministry desires for the will
[1:00:56] of God to be done they seek the will of
[1:00:59] God they submit to it and do it ain't
[1:01:03] that right amen and that's that's the
[1:01:05] challenge and to me that's what
[1:01:07] separates amen the true bride from the
[1:01:10] rest is is they they're after the will
[1:01:13] of God they're seeking the will of God
[1:01:15] to be done they submit to the will of
[1:01:18] God and they do the will of God Amen see
[1:01:21] well what is the will of God well the
[1:01:23] will of God the prophet said is the word
[1:01:26] of God and it's the word for our day the
[1:01:30] word for our day is the will of God
[1:01:33] ain't that right amen the word allotted
[1:01:36] for us in our age and and so that we
[1:01:39] pray as Jesus taught us to give us this
[1:01:42] day our daily bread don't give us the
[1:01:45] day of yesterday don't but give us the
[1:01:48] day that we're living in our daily bread
[1:01:51] that way we know what the will of God is
[1:01:53] having an understanding of the will of
[1:01:56] God Amen everybody might be confused on
[1:01:58] the will of God for today but a bride
[1:02:00] isn't amen because that she is the body
[1:02:04] of Christ so she's got to know every
[1:02:06] member has got to know what uh the will
[1:02:09] of God is uh uh for the church today
[1:02:14] amen so um the word for today is the
[1:02:18] only thing that will take effect upon
[1:02:21] the elect uh so Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 the
[1:02:25] these are the scriptures why we stay
[1:02:27] with that constantly uh uh because it's
[1:02:30] the word for our day it it's it's a
[1:02:33] product of we are a product of this
[1:02:35] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 uh Revelations 10
[1:02:40] 1-9 amen uh uh we we we we say A Lot 1
[1:02:44] through 7 amen but but we are the8 and N
[1:02:48] uh verses if you if you know where John
[1:02:51] was told to eat the book go get the book
[1:02:53] from the angel and eat the book and thou
[1:02:55] and the angel after he ate it said thou
[1:02:57] must prophesy again ain't that right
[1:03:00] well John was the type of the bride and
[1:03:03] so so the revelations uh or or 1
[1:03:06] Thessalonians
[1:03:07] 4:16 and and and on and on and on and on
[1:03:11] we could go of scriptures that apply for
[1:03:14] the day that we are living in and so now
[1:03:18] I understand that there is a will of God
[1:03:20] that that that we we seek for uh in our
[1:03:24] personal life you know such as who who
[1:03:27] should I marry and and and and uh you
[1:03:30] know what what should I do and uh what
[1:03:33] should I say when certain situations
[1:03:36] arise and what what should I do in life
[1:03:39] and you know uh uh you know even to the
[1:03:42] uh church that what should I attend and
[1:03:45] what Ministry should I sit under and and
[1:03:47] all these things it these things that we
[1:03:49] seek for the will of God in our lives
[1:03:53] amen and it's a personal thing and and
[1:03:56] we we we must we we need to seek the
[1:03:58] will of God in every aspect of our life
[1:04:02] amen of even in my opinion of of where
[1:04:04] we should work amen as I've said before
[1:04:07] a lot of folks they'll they they you
[1:04:09] know they they'll go after the money and
[1:04:11] it'll take them further from the house
[1:04:12] of God and and they they call that the
[1:04:15] will of God well if it takes you from
[1:04:17] the house of God if it takes you from
[1:04:19] The Fellowship Of God and around the
[1:04:21] Saints and all that there's something
[1:04:23] wrong with that that's my opinion
[1:04:25] anyways and I believe it's scriptural
[1:04:27] amen for the Bible does say forsake not
[1:04:30] the assembling of yourselves together
[1:04:31] even that much more as you see the day
[1:04:33] approaching and and so uh uh there is a
[1:04:36] will of God that we are to seek for in
[1:04:39] our personal life and and and and this
[1:04:42] is U Romans 8:14 it says as many as are
[1:04:46] led by the spirit of God they are the
[1:04:48] sons of God so sons of God which belong
[1:04:51] in the body of God are placed in the
[1:04:53] body of of God uh of Christ uh they're
[1:04:56] led by the spirit of God and it's it's
[1:05:00] no longer now the world Amen they're led
[1:05:03] by their own pernicious ways the Bible
[1:05:05] says they're own led by their own lust
[1:05:08] the Bible says but the sons of God uh uh
[1:05:11] are different from that they are led by
[1:05:15] the spirit of God ain't that right and
[1:05:18] so if if we're going to be led by the
[1:05:20] spirit of God then this requires us to
[1:05:23] be sensitive to the spirit of God and it
[1:05:28] also requires us to be disciplined uh uh
[1:05:32] to his will and and the word disciplined
[1:05:37] uh it means to show restraint controlled
[1:05:40] or temperate amen and you know brother
[1:05:44] Brandon talked about the the Capstone uh
[1:05:47] uh or the Great Pyramid uh there in
[1:05:49] Egypt and how that the Capstone was
[1:05:52] never put up on it and he tells tells us
[1:05:54] why and and uh because it was a type of
[1:05:57] Israel rejecting The Headstone which was
[1:06:00] Christ amen and and brother brandom says
[1:06:04] here and I want you to listen now he
[1:06:06] says when Enoch and them he said they
[1:06:09] knew that the C Cornerstone the Capstone
[1:06:12] would be rejected and that pyramid is so
[1:06:15] perfectly together till they don't need
[1:06:18] any mortar see it was so mechanically
[1:06:21] hewed out until one Stone fits against
[1:06:25] the other so tight that you can't even
[1:06:28] put a razor blade between them see and
[1:06:31] and and just kept heaping up now it's
[1:06:34] all honed off on top ready for the
[1:06:37] Capstone when it will come see that's
[1:06:40] the way God has brought his church from
[1:06:43] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:06:46] of the Holy Ghost and now everybody say
[1:06:48] now the ministry of the spirit which is
[1:06:52] what quickens the world word that
[1:06:55] Ministry in the church will have to be
[1:06:58] just exactly like his so we we
[1:07:03] identifying the ministry in the body
[1:07:05] right amen see and he says see it's just
[1:07:08] like my when my shadow here my hand if I
[1:07:11] never seen my hand seen the shadow it
[1:07:13] gets pale it get as it gets away see but
[1:07:17] he says as it gets closer and closer and
[1:07:20] closer see the negative and the positive
[1:07:23] are coming until they both become the
[1:07:25] same thing and that's exactly when the
[1:07:29] church and the word has to be one like
[1:07:32] Jesus and God was one see God has was
[1:07:36] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:07:38] to himself and so Christ will have to be
[1:07:40] in the church see the anointed of the
[1:07:43] word to make everything
[1:07:46] fulfilled ain't that right and that's
[1:07:49] the Capstone that comes upon this last
[1:07:51] Church age not lay Osa now it's a
[1:07:54] calling out of that out of Le osia a
[1:07:57] bride out of that calling a church out
[1:08:00] of a church ain't that right see so then
[1:08:04] that tells us that we're not just a pile
[1:08:08] of stones just laying there but we are
[1:08:12] as what Paul or brother Brandon would
[1:08:14] say we are stones in the hands of the
[1:08:18] stone Mason that have been cut that's
[1:08:21] been shaped to fit into the body amen uh
[1:08:26] and and shaped into Sons and Daughters
[1:08:28] of God so so we we we are now as at at
[1:08:33] the honing see being honed we are stones
[1:08:37] that are hone trial after trial trial
[1:08:40] after trial what what what's being hone
[1:08:42] your will is being subjected to his will
[1:08:46] your thoughts being subjected to his
[1:08:49] thoughts can you say man everything of
[1:08:52] you is being subjected and conformed
[1:08:54] into his nature Amen to where you become
[1:08:58] obedient to the word of God Amen see and
[1:09:01] and the Capstone headstone can come upon
[1:09:05] the body now one of the fruits of the
[1:09:07] spirit is temperance Temperance and that
[1:09:11] is self-control that's that's uh
[1:09:14] restraint amen see and and and not not
[1:09:18] is it just Restraint of well he made me
[1:09:20] mad so I ain't going to hit him you know
[1:09:22] because I'm I've got Temperance and no
[1:09:25] no that I I think it goes more to
[1:09:27] Temperance to do his will amen and and
[1:09:31] how far many people are lacking in that
[1:09:33] is is the temperance a control to do his
[1:09:37] will amen Romans
[1:09:40] 87 now notice he says the carnal mind is
[1:09:43] enity against God for it is not subject
[1:09:47] to the law of God neither indeed can be
[1:09:51] ain't that right so so then the carnal
[1:09:54] mind has no Temperance that's that's
[1:09:57] what we're talking about right it it has
[1:09:59] no Temperance now people may not uh uh
[1:10:02] shoot shoot another person you know
[1:10:04] because they don't want to go to jail
[1:10:05] well that's that's being a little you
[1:10:07] know that's been a little temperent
[1:10:08] showing some Temperance but this ain't
[1:10:10] the temperance that we're talking about
[1:10:12] in my opinion anyways amen because uh
[1:10:16] while that same person may not shoot
[1:10:18] someone cuz he don't want to spend life
[1:10:19] in jail you know he ain't temperate to
[1:10:22] the word of God man a lot of folks going
[1:10:24] to church but they're not temper to the
[1:10:26] word of God a lot of people are even
[1:10:28] showing Temperance in business where
[1:10:31] they get up 4:00 in the morning and they
[1:10:32] get out there and they they make their
[1:10:34] and they'll they'll work 90 hours 100
[1:10:36] hours a week well to me that's that's
[1:10:39] showing some Temperance you know amen as
[1:10:41] to where you can get up they're maybe
[1:10:43] tired they may be whatever but they're
[1:10:45] out to make that business work they're
[1:10:47] out there to make that money they're out
[1:10:48] there you know but when it comes to the
[1:10:50] things of God there's no Temperance so
[1:10:52] see so the fruit of the spirit amen
[1:10:55] brings a Temperance into the body ain't
[1:10:59] that right amen see into the body amen
[1:11:03] and and so we find that the carnal mind
[1:11:05] is not subject to the law of God neither
[1:11:08] indeed can be so it has no Temperance
[1:11:12] when it comes to the will of God for it
[1:11:14] cannot be subject to God or to his word
[1:11:18] ain't that right so then what it boils
[1:11:21] down to is a gift that is used by a
[1:11:25] carnal mind can bring harm more harm
[1:11:29] than it can do
[1:11:31] good ain't that right so Galatians 5 and
[1:11:35] 24 it says they that are christs have
[1:11:39] crucified the uh flesh with the
[1:11:42] affections and lusts aren't you glad you
[1:11:46] have that ability to do that amen if
[1:11:49] you're part of the body you have that
[1:11:50] ability to do that it's because we're
[1:11:53] we're crying out thy will be done in in
[1:11:57] Earth as it is in heaven and and so then
[1:12:00] we have this ability then amen Jesus
[1:12:03] said you shall receive power amen after
[1:12:06] that you you uh have received the Holy
[1:12:08] Ghost see so they that are Christ have
[1:12:12] crucified the flesh with the affections
[1:12:15] and lust if we live in the spirit let us
[1:12:19] walk in the spirit also ain't that right
[1:12:24] so then the I I just believe that the
[1:12:28] spirit of God will never lead the elect
[1:12:32] outside of his will that is written out
[1:12:36] in the scriptures Lord amen No Matter
[1:12:40] What will what what Revelation you seek
[1:12:42] for your personal life that revelation
[1:12:45] will always line up with what is written
[1:12:47] in the Scriptures it it just will
[1:12:50] because the spirit of God if you're
[1:12:52] truly if a man is truly led by the
[1:12:54] spirit of God it will never leave him
[1:12:56] outside of the word because the spirit
[1:12:59] of God cannot deny the word of God ain't
[1:13:03] that right so then if you notice a god
[1:13:06] ordained ministry will do all it can by
[1:13:10] the word of God Amen by the word of God
[1:13:13] not by some lecture not by some Creed or
[1:13:16] some pamphlet amen but by the word of
[1:13:19] God to help your faith get centered on
[1:13:21] the will of God for you amen every God
[1:13:25] ordained Ministry every in other words
[1:13:28] every member of the body will help you
[1:13:32] to get your faith centered on the will
[1:13:35] of God for your life it ain't going to
[1:13:38] lead you somewh and ain't going to lead
[1:13:39] you there it ain't going to lead you
[1:13:41] here it ain't going to whatever see it's
[1:13:43] got to say the same
[1:13:45] thing can you say Amen so God forbid
[1:13:49] that we go through life claiming to be
[1:13:51] the bride of Christ and and and then we
[1:13:54] not know his will amen uh uh for us as
[1:14:00] the bride of Christ claiming to be bride
[1:14:03] of Christ bride of Christ and yet not
[1:14:04] know the will of God that he has laid
[1:14:08] out for his his bride amen see now there
[1:14:11] are Ministries that are powerful and
[1:14:14] effective and yet they work against the
[1:14:17] will of God Amen and and they teach
[1:14:21] contrary to the will of God they do that
[1:14:23] with which is contrary to the will of
[1:14:24] God they live contrary to the will of
[1:14:27] God and and yet they are genuinely
[1:14:32] anointed genuinely and and and this
[1:14:35] should not be a a a surprise to any of
[1:14:38] us uh especially in in those that you
[1:14:41] know in in the message ranks um uh well
[1:14:45] just any Bible believer really because 2
[1:14:47] Corinthians
[1:14:48] 11:13 it says for such are false
[1:14:51] Apostles deceitful workers
[1:14:53] transforming themselves into the
[1:14:56] Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for
[1:14:59] Satan himself is transformed into an
[1:15:02] angel of Light showing that he is
[1:15:06] religious ain't that right therefore it
[1:15:09] is no great thing if his ministers also
[1:15:11] be transformed as the Ministers of
[1:15:14] righteousness whose end shall be
[1:15:16] according to their Works ain't that
[1:15:18] right so then what is Satan's true
[1:15:22] intention you know I I think if we could
[1:15:25] understand his motives and his
[1:15:27] intentions then then uh then then that's
[1:15:30] what will keep us from being deceived uh
[1:15:33] uh and only the spirit can truly Quicken
[1:15:36] that to us but here's uh uh the prophet
[1:15:40] Isaiah exposes and tells the true
[1:15:42] intention Isaiah
[1:15:44] 14-12 it says how art thou fallen from
[1:15:47] Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how
[1:15:49] art thou cut down to the ground which
[1:15:51] did US weaken the Nations for th thou H
[1:15:53] has said in thine heart I will Ascend
[1:15:56] into heaven I will exalt my throne above
[1:15:59] the stars or sons of God I will sit also
[1:16:02] upon the Mount of the congregation in
[1:16:04] the sides of the north I will Ascend
[1:16:06] above the heights of the clouds I will
[1:16:08] be like the most high so this has been
[1:16:11] his intentions and he's been acting upon
[1:16:14] this ever since he has never changed and
[1:16:17] then Paul picks up on this in 2
[1:16:19] Thessalonians 2 and 3 let no man deceive
[1:16:22] you by any means for that day shall not
[1:16:26] come except there come a falling away
[1:16:28] first and that man of sin be revealed
[1:16:31] the son of predition who opposeth and
[1:16:35] exalteth himself above all that is
[1:16:38] called God or that is worshiped so that
[1:16:40] he as God sth in the temple of God
[1:16:43] showing himself that he is God can you
[1:16:48] say man so this is the motive this is
[1:16:51] the intention desire of of Satan and and
[1:16:55] and so then we see that Satan is an
[1:16:57] enemy to God and he seeks to be like God
[1:17:01] and to take the place of God to be God
[1:17:05] Amen to be God and and so in order for
[1:17:09] this to happen he has to do it in
[1:17:13] deception he has to do it in deception
[1:17:15] and I thank God for a prophet to to
[1:17:18] Really expose him for what he truly is
[1:17:22] he has to do it all in deception and and
[1:17:25] Revelations 12:7 and we know that he
[1:17:27] achieves it he achieves this uh it says
[1:17:30] and the Great Dragon uh was cast out
[1:17:34] that old serpent called the devil and
[1:17:36] Satan which deceiveth the whole
[1:17:41] world think of that it deceiveth the
[1:17:44] whole He deceiveth the whole world he
[1:17:46] was cast out into the Earth and his
[1:17:49] angels were cast out with him so then
[1:17:52] Jes Jesus comes along and he prophesies
[1:17:55] that this deception would be so close
[1:17:59] that it would deceive the very elect if
[1:18:02] it were possible ain't that right so the
[1:18:05] prophet says by unbelief in all God's
[1:18:08] word has brought the the seed of
[1:18:11] unholiness in Satan's Eden we're now
[1:18:14] entering in where Satan is taken the
[1:18:16] throne as the Antichrist in an Eden of
[1:18:19] this Earth an Eden of sin perverted Rel
[1:18:23] everybody say perverted religion amen
[1:18:25] see perverted religion he started not
[1:18:28] upon I am Satan I'm the great Angel not
[1:18:31] upon that but upon perverting God's word
[1:18:34] and we know just how much he perverted
[1:18:37] it by missing one word one word and he
[1:18:40] perverted the whole the whole word of
[1:18:43] God see so he says upon perverting God's
[1:18:47] word and that's how he's brought his
[1:18:49] kingdom in every age now in this great
[1:18:53] deceitful age ready to take his throne
[1:18:57] by his people amen that's what he's been
[1:19:01] working on all this time so as we read
[1:19:04] Satan has ministers who are
[1:19:06] transformed as the Ministers of
[1:19:10] righteousness now I want you to notice
[1:19:13] now that Satan the prophet says can
[1:19:16] impersonate any kind of gift that God
[1:19:20] has got but he cannot not bring that
[1:19:23] word word by word that's where he failed
[1:19:27] in the Garden of Eden and that's where
[1:19:29] he always fails he doesn't fail upon
[1:19:33] gifts per se he can you impersonate any
[1:19:36] gift but he cannot bring that word word
[1:19:40] by word in other words he can't stay
[1:19:42] with it he can't believe in all of it
[1:19:45] amen see so brother Brandon preached
[1:19:47] about the false anointed ones and and he
[1:19:50] says this they can be Anointed with the
[1:19:53] Spirit speak in tongues dance shout
[1:19:57] preach the gospel and still a devil
[1:20:00] that's right ain't that right we all
[1:20:02] know that the real genuine Holy Spirit
[1:20:07] can fall upon a man and yet it only fall
[1:20:11] on his spirit and brother Bram said his
[1:20:14] soul is his germ see not the spirit it's
[1:20:18] in his soul is the germ and that germ is
[1:20:21] the word so he says I don't care how
[1:20:24] much you can preach and how will you do
[1:20:26] this and how much you love well that's
[1:20:28] one of the inlets to the spirit see you
[1:20:31] can't you can't love with your body you
[1:20:34] love with your spirit that's one of the
[1:20:36] inlets and you can love and even love
[1:20:39] God and still not be right see you can
[1:20:43] cast out devils and preach and do things
[1:20:45] and still not be right Jesus said so
[1:20:48] said that many would come in that day
[1:20:50] see it's the word
[1:20:53] that settles it stay with the word can
[1:20:57] you say man see and this is what this
[1:21:00] bride is she is a word bride word bride
[1:21:04] and her Ministry is a word
[1:21:07] ministry amen ain't that
[1:21:10] right so then we find that Satan the
[1:21:13] prophet says anoints his servants with
[1:21:16] unbelief another place he said Satan and
[1:21:19] his demons anoint Humanity to disbelieve
[1:21:22] God's word
[1:21:23] and Jesus here in Luke
[1:21:26] 11:24 said when the unclean spirit is
[1:21:28] gone out of a man he walketh through Dry
[1:21:30] places seeking rest and finding none and
[1:21:34] he says I'll return unto my house whence
[1:21:37] I came out and when he cometh he findeth
[1:21:41] it swept and garnished then he goeth and
[1:21:44] and taketh him seven other Spirits more
[1:21:47] wicked than himself and they enter in
[1:21:49] and dwell there and the last state of
[1:21:51] that man is worth wor than the first my
[1:21:55] see now brother Brandon quotes that
[1:21:58] scripture and then he he he he says this
[1:22:01] that's what happens to these meetings
[1:22:04] see when people go forth in revivals and
[1:22:07] men are just led to an intellectual
[1:22:09] conception he goes off and joins some
[1:22:12] church and lets it go at that satisfied
[1:22:15] yeah I want to just say here we don't
[1:22:16] want intellectual conceptions we don't
[1:22:19] want to bring people to intellectual
[1:22:21] conceptions
[1:22:23] ain't that right we don't want to just
[1:22:24] sit here as a morg it's important that
[1:22:28] we entertain the spirit of God it's
[1:22:31] important that we know how to bring the
[1:22:34] spirit of God in our midst can you say
[1:22:38] amen and not grieve him away from the
[1:22:44] service so many people grieve him
[1:22:47] because when he starts moving on someone
[1:22:49] someone starts dancing or shouting oh
[1:22:51] that's fanaticism
[1:22:53] you ought to know better than that if
[1:22:56] you're any type of a Believer you ought
[1:22:57] to know better than that you ought to
[1:23:00] know that brother brandham said don't
[1:23:01] criticize that person even though you
[1:23:04] say well I know he's doing wrong I I see
[1:23:06] what is life brother Bram said don't
[1:23:07] criticize that person yet is that could
[1:23:09] be a genuine anointing on that
[1:23:11] person you understand what I'm saying we
[1:23:14] want the spirit of God to have his
[1:23:17] way why because there could be a seat
[1:23:20] somewhere where the spirit of God Amen
[1:23:24] will get past that Spirit into their
[1:23:26] soul that's right true so we don't want
[1:23:30] them just to leave with an intellectual
[1:23:33] conception ain't that right where they
[1:23:36] say w that was powerful that was so
[1:23:38] profound the way they put it
[1:23:41] together it doesn't matter if you can
[1:23:43] put it together that's right doesn't
[1:23:45] matter if you can explain it and spell
[1:23:47] it out if you just lead them to
[1:23:50] intellectual conception it does no good
[1:23:52] right true so and I think you can all
[1:23:54] say men if you're Believers so he says
[1:23:58] men are just led to an intellectual
[1:24:00] conception he goes off and joins some
[1:24:02] church and lets it go at that satisfied
[1:24:06] that's all right see well there's
[1:24:08] nothing to all this other nonsense he
[1:24:10] begins to say see we should not have it
[1:24:13] the pastor says all that's all well that
[1:24:16] was way back in another age see and the
[1:24:18] first thing you know that devil returns
[1:24:21] back was other Devils and he becomes a
[1:24:24] religious devil and then he's really
[1:24:27] filled and then he's got pride and
[1:24:30] jealousy see he's even angry with the
[1:24:33] very God that wrote the Bible and he
[1:24:35] looks down there and he says these
[1:24:36] things that I do shall you do also and
[1:24:38] that man will say well that was just for
[1:24:40] the
[1:24:41] disciples see it only come to an
[1:24:44] intellectual conception of the message
[1:24:47] or of the Bible whatever you want to
[1:24:49] call it to me it's the same amen pise
[1:24:53] the Lord and when they begin to explain
[1:24:55] it away for another
[1:24:57] age then it shows they're under a
[1:25:01] different headship that's
[1:25:03] right you can't be that in in in the
[1:25:06] body of Christ now they have a Ministry
[1:25:09] of course they have a Ministry but
[1:25:11] they're not centering the people's faith
[1:25:14] upon the word of God you know the
[1:25:16] prophet said the worst thing that you
[1:25:18] can do is disbelieve
[1:25:20] God that's the worst thing you can
[1:25:23] do you know it's it's it's
[1:25:28] it's well anyways I think it gets us
[1:25:31] worked up on a lot of
[1:25:33] things and it gets us thinking about
[1:25:35] other things and thinking that God can't
[1:25:37] forgive and God can't do this and you
[1:25:40] know but the worst thing you can do is
[1:25:43] disbelieve
[1:25:46] God the tactic of the devil he says in
[1:25:49] another place is to get you to
[1:25:50] disbelieve God's word ain't that right
[1:25:53] well isn't that what he tried with Jesus
[1:25:55] there at Temptation Matthew 4 and3 when
[1:25:58] the tempter came to him he said if thou
[1:26:01] if thou be the Son of God throwing them
[1:26:02] questions out there isn't that what he
[1:26:04] does to us well if you're the bride if
[1:26:06] you're really really saved if God really
[1:26:09] loves you and this and that well see if
[1:26:12] thou be the Son of God command these
[1:26:13] stones to be made bread see but Jesus
[1:26:17] answered and said but it is written see
[1:26:20] th man shall not live by bread alone but
[1:26:22] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:26:24] mouth of God then the devil taketh him
[1:26:25] up into a holy city amen and Seth him up
[1:26:28] on the Pinnacle of the temple and said
[1:26:30] unto him if thou be the Son of God cast
[1:26:33] thyself down ain't that right see so
[1:26:36] what Satan was trying to do he was
[1:26:38] trying to get Jesus to doubt the word of
[1:26:41] what the word said he
[1:26:44] was ain't that right am Jesus's
[1:26:48] knowledge of who he was was only by the
[1:26:50] word of God that's right bless the Lord
[1:26:53] and that's the only way your knowledge
[1:26:54] is going to come by is by the word of
[1:26:57] God can you say Amen of who you are is
[1:27:00] by the word of God so he was trying to
[1:27:02] get Jesus to doubt the word which would
[1:27:05] have caused Jesus to act outside the
[1:27:08] will of
[1:27:10] God but Jesus was disciplined to the
[1:27:14] will of God Amen he was yes now Satan
[1:27:17] taught Eve to
[1:27:19] disbelieve and he has tried throughout
[1:27:21] the history his of mankind to teach men
[1:27:24] to doubt God he tried to teach Moses to
[1:27:28] doubt he tried to teach other men to
[1:27:30] doubt God's word so so don't think that
[1:27:33] Satan isn't going to try to get you and
[1:27:35] I to doubt God's word he he's going to
[1:27:38] do it now he may not be able to to to to
[1:27:42] get us to doubt that Jesus Christ uh uh
[1:27:46] you know uh didn't exist 2,000 years ago
[1:27:50] and he may not try to get you to doubt
[1:27:52] out that you know of of the former
[1:27:54] Church ages and what God done in Moses
[1:27:56] and what God had done in David but the
[1:27:59] point is is the word for our day is
[1:28:02] where he's going to challenge your faith
[1:28:05] the word for our day right amen
[1:28:10] hello see so so we find here um uh in
[1:28:14] the message proving his word brother
[1:28:16] brandham and talking about Satan said
[1:28:18] he's trying to teach you to doubt it see
[1:28:21] or
[1:28:22] yeah he's trying to teach you to try to
[1:28:24] doubt it and you that's sitting here
[1:28:26] right now if you want me to call your
[1:28:28] names Satan's been trying a long time to
[1:28:31] get you to doubt me don't you do
[1:28:36] that now isn't he still trying to do
[1:28:38] that trying to get us to make to make
[1:28:41] light of what God has done in this day
[1:28:44] like it it yeah it's okay but you know
[1:28:47] we're moving on to Greener pasture so to
[1:28:49] speak and that's the attitude that
[1:28:51] people have come on hello and and and
[1:28:55] yet see it's it's it's but but he says
[1:28:58] see Satan trying to get you to doubt me
[1:29:00] don't you do
[1:29:02] that amen stay with the message
[1:29:06] amen that's right Matthew 24:9 Jesus
[1:29:10] says and many false prophets shall rise
[1:29:12] and shall deceive many but notice what
[1:29:15] we're commanded to there to do in 1 John
[1:29:18] 4:1 beloved believe not not every spirit
[1:29:24] amen not talking about personalities not
[1:29:27] talking about men not talking about
[1:29:28] nothing else but Spirits believe not
[1:29:31] every spirit because behind everything
[1:29:34] there is a
[1:29:35] spirit ain't that right behind every
[1:29:38] Ministry there's a
[1:29:39] spirit so he says believe not every
[1:29:42] Spirit but try everybody say try in
[1:29:45] other words discern try the spirit
[1:29:47] discern the spirit whether they are of
[1:29:50] God because many false prophets are gone
[1:29:53] out into the world ain't that right so
[1:29:56] this is not just a request from God this
[1:29:59] is a command from God this is an order
[1:30:02] from God that we as Believers are to
[1:30:05] tried the
[1:30:08] spirit it's just like in nickan uh uh in
[1:30:11] the first church age was it not I think
[1:30:13] it was the first church age that God
[1:30:15] commended that church because he said
[1:30:17] you have tried them and found them to be
[1:30:20] Liars
[1:30:22] ain't that right yes sir because they're
[1:30:25] they no matter what little uh what they
[1:30:27] were starting to do at least they still
[1:30:30] had some
[1:30:31] discernment
[1:30:33] right now so brother Brown said now
[1:30:36] there is so much in the day that we live
[1:30:40] in pertaining to gifts so so many people
[1:30:44] judge people by gifts that they have
[1:30:47] well I believe that these things are
[1:30:49] gifts I believe that what we see see uh
[1:30:53] that we see take place as gifts and they
[1:30:55] are god-given
[1:30:57] gifts but if we do not use them in the
[1:31:01] right way that God intended them to be
[1:31:04] used then we can do more harm with the
[1:31:07] gifts than we could if we did not have
[1:31:10] the
[1:31:11] gifts ain't that right see the other
[1:31:14] night he says I made the statement at
[1:31:15] the pulpit saying this I would rather
[1:31:17] see Brotherly Love existing among the
[1:31:19] church if we didn't have one case of
[1:31:21] healing or anything else we must know
[1:31:24] everybody say we must know what these
[1:31:26] things are
[1:31:27] for we must know what these things are
[1:31:30] for ain't that right how many times have
[1:31:33] we seen men use their gift to divide the
[1:31:35] church divide the body of Christ they Ed
[1:31:38] their gift to draw people unto
[1:31:41] themselves to bring confusion among the
[1:31:44] people see they're taking a gift and it
[1:31:47] it you know hey we ain't doubting the
[1:31:49] gift but what is behind the gift what is
[1:31:54] motivating that gift can you say Amen
[1:31:58] see so what is it it's a
[1:32:01] distraction uh uh from what God is
[1:32:04] actually trying to do see amen see so so
[1:32:09] what are we to discern then well brother
[1:32:12] brandom in the spirit uh discernment of
[1:32:14] spirit he says now if a man comes and he
[1:32:18] has a great gift no matter if he belongs
[1:32:19] to our denomination or another
[1:32:21] denomination don't judge him by what
[1:32:24] denomination he come from or how he
[1:32:26] dresses but what you want to see is what
[1:32:29] he's trying to do with that gift what
[1:32:32] purpose he has if he's trying to take
[1:32:34] his influence and build himself a great
[1:32:36] name out of it I'd have discernment of
[1:32:38] spirit enough to know that that's wrong
[1:32:40] no matter how great a teacher he is how
[1:32:42] powerful he is how intellectual he is
[1:32:45] how his gift operates if he isn't trying
[1:32:48] to achieve something for the benefit of
[1:32:50] the body of Christ your own spiritual
[1:32:52] discernment would tell you that's wrong
[1:32:55] no matter how accurate or how perfect
[1:32:58] how it is it's wrong if it isn't used
[1:33:01] for the body of Jesus Christ to achieve
[1:33:04] something maybe he's got a great gift
[1:33:06] that he could draw people together with
[1:33:08] a great intellectual or spiritual power
[1:33:11] see that he could draw people together
[1:33:14] and maybe he's trying to take that gift
[1:33:16] and make himself famous so that he'll
[1:33:18] have a big name so that other Brethren
[1:33:20] will look up to him as some big person
[1:33:23] then that's
[1:33:24] wrong we do not have big preachers and
[1:33:27] little preachers we do not have big
[1:33:29] people and little people so do you
[1:33:31] understand what I'm saying not in the
[1:33:33] body
[1:33:34] hello now now some some may be going
[1:33:37] around worldwide and they're famous and
[1:33:39] and and and and that's the gift that
[1:33:41] they've got but he is no better than
[1:33:44] than that little person that's that's
[1:33:46] that's M making sure that the local
[1:33:48] church is going and and sweeping and
[1:33:50] cleaning and the musicians and nobody
[1:33:53] may know your name but to God you're
[1:33:55] important in the
[1:33:59] body ain't that right so see maybe he's
[1:34:03] trying to edify a certain thing here
[1:34:04] that he wants everybody else to get out
[1:34:06] of the picture and let him and his group
[1:34:09] be the pitcher that's still
[1:34:12] wrong amen but if if if he has a gift of
[1:34:16] God and he's trying to edify the body of
[1:34:19] Christ and I don't care what he belongs
[1:34:20] to you're not Discerning the man you're
[1:34:22] Discerning the spirit the life that's in
[1:34:25] the
[1:34:26] man see another place if he if we can
[1:34:29] find out that he's trying to lead the
[1:34:31] people not to break them up but to bring
[1:34:34] them together and to bring the Church of
[1:34:37] the Living God not all to one
[1:34:39] denomination but to an understanding a
[1:34:42] fellowship a Unity of the spirit can you
[1:34:44] say Amen it's said that a lot a lot of
[1:34:47] times you can't fellowship with others
[1:34:49] because they're trying to destroy you
[1:34:51] they're trying to destroy the
[1:34:54] church their whole motive is to empty a
[1:34:57] church
[1:34:58] out that's right absolutely hello to
[1:35:03] break up
[1:35:04] Brotherhood and then you say well then
[1:35:06] you're accused of of not fellowshipping
[1:35:08] well I thought you wanted to Fellowship
[1:35:11] well how do you how does light and
[1:35:12] darkness
[1:35:14] fellowship if a if if a man has a motive
[1:35:17] to empty the another man's Church to
[1:35:19] fill his church up right then you're not
[1:35:22] having Fellowship you're not walking in
[1:35:24] the light there's a spirit behind that
[1:35:29] thing it amazes me how people don't have
[1:35:31] the understanding what of what groups of
[1:35:34] Fellowship they get
[1:35:35] into they'll get into certain group and
[1:35:38] all of a sudden they lose their fire
[1:35:39] they lose their energy they lose their
[1:35:41] burden they lose everything that's right
[1:35:44] you don't see them around local body
[1:35:46] anymore something is at work and they'll
[1:35:50] tell you to your face oh we're all just
[1:35:52] fine no you're not amen something's
[1:35:55] wrong that's
[1:35:59] right and the problem is is they all do
[1:36:02] it for
[1:36:05] fellowship and ignorant of the spirit
[1:36:08] that's behind it
[1:36:11] all now
[1:36:13] yeah
[1:36:15] true but see here it is if he's trying
[1:36:18] to lead the people not break them up but
[1:36:21] but to bring them together and to bring
[1:36:23] the Church of the Living God not all to
[1:36:25] one denomination but to an understanding
[1:36:28] a fellowship a Unity of The Spirit Well
[1:36:31] then if his former L Reign latter Reign
[1:36:34] whatever he is see his spirit and his
[1:36:38] purpose is
[1:36:42] Right
[1:36:46] amen and the spirit that's in him no
[1:36:49] matter what move he belongs to that
[1:36:50] spirit that's in him is trying to point
[1:36:52] the people to Calvary away from himself
[1:36:55] away from anything else but his only
[1:36:58] achievement he has is to point them to
[1:37:01] Calvary the body of Christ is pointing
[1:37:05] them to Calvary pointing them to a
[1:37:07] bloody bleeding word pointing them to
[1:37:10] God of the realities of Jesus Christ for
[1:37:15] today can you say amen he doesn't care
[1:37:19] whether even his own movement which is
[1:37:21] fine it's good if he's a Methodist
[1:37:24] Presbyterian Roman cath whatever he
[1:37:26] wants to be by denomination but what is
[1:37:29] he trying to do the purpose of his heart
[1:37:31] that he's trying to get see well then
[1:37:34] you can see what's in the man's life
[1:37:36] whether his motive is for his
[1:37:38] denomination is he working for his
[1:37:42] denomination see it is is what whether
[1:37:45] it's for himself whether it's for
[1:37:47] worldly Fame whether it's for big names
[1:37:49] I you know to say well I predicted that
[1:37:52] and it come to pass I you know I I'll
[1:37:55] say it this way you know a lot of times
[1:37:57] you get preachers that are that that
[1:37:58] that say well the Lord done this and the
[1:38:00] Lord done that in our church in our
[1:38:02] church you know and they and and they're
[1:38:03] just you know it's almost becoming
[1:38:05] bragging you know the Lord done this
[1:38:06] well brother brandham he he constantly
[1:38:08] told of Miracles and things that was
[1:38:10] happening but I guarantee you and you
[1:38:12] can tell the spirit that brother
[1:38:14] brandham had it was not to say see here
[1:38:18] I
[1:38:18] [Applause]
[1:38:19] am never did he do that and when you
[1:38:23] start seeing them Spirits start fighting
[1:38:25] and and and again trying to empty
[1:38:27] churches and trying to do this and
[1:38:29] trying to do that it's almost like see
[1:38:32] God's here I don't know where else is
[1:38:34] he's moving but he's sure moving
[1:38:38] here brother he says see I predicted
[1:38:42] that and it just come to pass exactly
[1:38:44] well see you see that's wrong right
[1:38:47] there to begin with amen it's not about
[1:38:50] us
[1:38:52] our ministry is not about
[1:38:54] us
[1:38:57] hello brother brandom knew that that's
[1:38:59] why he was willing to go to people of
[1:39:03] five or to
[1:39:05] 100,000 he was willing true that's why
[1:39:08] he didn't get bound up Amen in in in in
[1:39:12] all these things like old Roberts and
[1:39:14] and them did because they had to have
[1:39:16] certain
[1:39:17] money and before they would win they had
[1:39:21] to have 10,000 they had to have whatever
[1:39:24] because they were so in debt but brother
[1:39:27] Brown stayed
[1:39:29] simple that way he could have a house
[1:39:31] meeting if God called him for that house
[1:39:33] meeting he would go if God called him
[1:39:36] out in the mountains of Canada to reach
[1:39:37] an Indian he would go you understand
[1:39:41] what I'm saying see so notice brother
[1:39:44] Brown said never on the platform under
[1:39:46] the Visions have I ever seen the Holy
[1:39:49] Spirit challenge anyone and tell them
[1:39:51] they was in the wrong church I've never
[1:39:54] have done that see and he says see he
[1:39:58] will tell them just exactly what kind of
[1:40:00] church they belong to and different
[1:40:01] things like that but he never did uh
[1:40:05] never did he ever challenge anybody's
[1:40:07] faith and say you belong to the wrong
[1:40:10] Church all right can you say Amen now
[1:40:14] you know it's bad enough when we when
[1:40:17] when when you see it out in in the in
[1:40:19] the uh in in the church world but then
[1:40:22] it's really bad when you see it in in
[1:40:24] the message
[1:40:28] Rings yeah now he said see you find
[1:40:31] gifts and so forth creeping up in the
[1:40:33] church and the operation of these gifts
[1:40:35] before you let it go to operating in
[1:40:39] things feel it pressing in your heart
[1:40:41] now the enemy is real slick can you say
[1:40:44] that with me the enemy is real
[1:40:47] slick and that's just what tears the
[1:40:50] church purch the pieces every time is a
[1:40:53] true gift operated
[1:40:55] wrong something God is trying to do and
[1:40:58] operated wrong it'll just simply not
[1:41:01] only uh hurt you but it'll tear the tear
[1:41:04] the whole church up see consult it take
[1:41:07] it through and through the Bible then
[1:41:09] test it and see if it's God or not just
[1:41:11] keep testing it and trying see if it's
[1:41:14] perfect right down the line and WR with
[1:41:16] the word then you're all right as long
[1:41:19] as the word has said it would be here
[1:41:21] would operate this certain way stay
[1:41:23] right with it don't never get off no
[1:41:26] matter what anybody does how real it
[1:41:28] seems to be if it doesn't reflect in the
[1:41:31] scriptures from Genesis to Revelations
[1:41:33] leave it alone don't take no chances
[1:41:37] we're in the last days when Satan is
[1:41:41] just deceiving as he can
[1:41:48] be God has done everything to show that
[1:41:51] he's God Amen and Satan has pulled every
[1:41:54] trick out he cannot be more deceiving
[1:41:57] than what he is today
[1:42:00] true now and I hope this is all right
[1:42:03] this morning but the ministry of God
[1:42:06] operates within the body of Christ and
[1:42:08] as we know God has placed in the Min in
[1:42:11] the body the five-fold
[1:42:13] ministry praise the Lord there gifts
[1:42:16] Pastor Prophet teacher evangelist
[1:42:19] apostle
[1:42:21] or missionary Apostle missionary see we
[1:42:25] call them missionaries today I guess but
[1:42:28] these gifts are predestinated
[1:42:31] amen that God set in his church and
[1:42:35] according to Ephesians 4 and 12 through
[1:42:38] 15 this ministry is given for the
[1:42:40] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:42:42] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:42:43] body of Christ till we all come into the
[1:42:46] unity of faith of of the faith and of
[1:42:49] the knowledge of the Son of God and to a
[1:42:51] perfect man and to the measure of the
[1:42:52] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:42:55] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[1:42:57] to and fro so this is the fightful
[1:42:59] ministry is that we grow up to where
[1:43:01] we're not wishy-washy we're not leaving
[1:43:03] questions in your mind we're not just
[1:43:05] scattering you out there and and destroy
[1:43:07] your confidence in the message and what
[1:43:09] God has done to where you just still you
[1:43:11] you you just gullible to anything the
[1:43:14] bride of Christ shouldn't be Gable these
[1:43:17] days I don't care what Ministry comes I
[1:43:19] don't care what personality comes I
[1:43:21] don't care what kind of a person says I
[1:43:22] don't care if what kind of friend you
[1:43:24] join up here with you should never be so
[1:43:26] gullible to to to swallow the
[1:43:31] Kool-Aid
[1:43:34] right and the ministry fful Ministry is
[1:43:37] given for that purpose yes that we
[1:43:41] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[1:43:43] and fr and of course it's not going to
[1:43:44] affect only the it'll only affect the
[1:43:46] elect and carried about with every wind
[1:43:49] of Doctrine see by the slight of men and
[1:43:51] the cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[1:43:53] and wait to deceive but speaking the
[1:43:55] truth in love may grow up into him in
[1:43:58] all things which is the head even Christ
[1:44:02] so now 1 Corinthians 12 and 20 Paul
[1:44:05] tells us that this body is a many
[1:44:08] membered body and brother brandom says
[1:44:11] that God has put us each one in the body
[1:44:14] to do certain
[1:44:15] things 1 Corinthians 15:16 makes mention
[1:44:20] of the ministry of the
[1:44:23] Saints and there are nine spiritual
[1:44:25] gifts that operate in the local body and
[1:44:27] of and of the Believers and that's
[1:44:29] wisdom
[1:44:31] knowledge speaking in tongues
[1:44:33] interpretation of tongues Gifts of
[1:44:35] healings Gifts of Prophecy and
[1:44:38] Etc and and these
[1:44:42] uh they're not necessarily predestinated
[1:44:46] gifts as they are as the fivefold
[1:44:49] ministry but these are gifts that God
[1:44:52] set in the
[1:44:54] church and brother Brown said see to
[1:44:56] show his love towards the church see he
[1:45:00] wants you to stay in order the great
[1:45:02] Holy Spirit himself being the tutor of
[1:45:04] the church but notice the prophet said
[1:45:07] they work through the body and they
[1:45:09] Circle through the body it circles see
[1:45:12] well then there are also helps and
[1:45:14] governments in the
[1:45:15] body and and you know I think of the men
[1:45:19] and women who helped the Apostle Paul
[1:45:22] and it wasn't just men it was it was
[1:45:24] women as well and Paul says mentions
[1:45:28] Aquilla and PR Priscilla and he says
[1:45:32] that they were his helpers in Christ
[1:45:34] Jesus and he said of them he says they
[1:45:37] have for my life laid down their own
[1:45:40] necks unto whom not only I give thanks
[1:45:43] but also all the churches of the
[1:45:45] Gentiles so they may have not been
[1:45:48] ministers because Paul declared plainly
[1:45:51] that a woman wasn't a minister but yet
[1:45:55] even she was a help to Paul yes and to
[1:45:58] all the
[1:46:00] churches of the Gentiles then Paul
[1:46:03] mentions that there was uh Phoebe who
[1:46:06] Paul said was a uh uh secur of many and
[1:46:11] of himself also then he mentions a a
[1:46:15] woman Mary who bestowed much labor on
[1:46:19] him and the brothers who were with him
[1:46:22] and he he goes on to to to many more but
[1:46:26] but so it wasn't all just Paul now we
[1:46:28] see Paul as the church age messenger man
[1:46:32] Paul was an important thing important
[1:46:35] Ministry because said If any man teach
[1:46:37] any other thing even if an angel from
[1:46:39] heaven comes down and teaches any other
[1:46:41] thing let him be a cursed so Paul was
[1:46:44] his ministry his teaching was the
[1:46:46] Cornerstone for the
[1:46:48] church and and and and so but yet that
[1:46:52] there was a other Ministry of the body
[1:46:56] that was
[1:46:57] operating but it was in wasn't in
[1:46:59] conflict with
[1:47:01] Paul hello amen it wasn't in Conflict
[1:47:05] they wer weren't working against what
[1:47:07] God was doing in
[1:47:09] Paul but they complimented
[1:47:12] Paul they helped him they furthered his
[1:47:16] ministry prise the Lord is that
[1:47:19] right but the ministry doesn't just
[1:47:22] operate when we come together
[1:47:25] Ministry should continue outside these
[1:47:28] walls witnessing
[1:47:30] testifying conducting ourselves as
[1:47:33] Believers
[1:47:34] should is that right there's if there's
[1:47:37] ever a people that are part of the body
[1:47:39] of Christ that should be written
[1:47:41] Epistles read and known of all men it
[1:47:43] should be us today because we are the
[1:47:45] completion of the
[1:47:47] body brother Bram says all how we need
[1:47:50] in Jefferson Ville thousands of lived
[1:47:52] voices the Thunder of of God thundering
[1:47:54] out in sweetness and Holiness Purity
[1:47:56] undefiled lives walking around in the
[1:47:59] Earth today without a blemish yes sir
[1:48:01] real Christians that's the Thunder
[1:48:02] against the enemy the devil don't care
[1:48:05] how loud you can holler that's right
[1:48:06] devil don't care how loud you can jump
[1:48:08] or how much you can do this or shout but
[1:48:10] What Hurts The Devil is to see that
[1:48:12] Sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[1:48:15] saying anything to him call him anything
[1:48:17] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:48:19] right on see oh my that throws him away
[1:48:22] that's the Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:48:24] just like you say well if he could
[1:48:26] preach like a Billy Graham or an old
[1:48:28] Roberts or somebody a great influential
[1:48:30] speaker see oh no sometimes the devil
[1:48:34] just laughs at
[1:48:35] that for sure he don't pay no more
[1:48:38] attention to that than nothing you get
[1:48:40] all the theology you wanted to and all
[1:48:43] the Seminary training and the devil just
[1:48:45] sits backs and laughs at it but when he
[1:48:47] sees that life that's the thing th that
[1:48:50] shakes the
[1:48:53] devil so so I I hope I'm under you're
[1:48:57] understanding what really Ministry is
[1:49:01] it's not just a man just standing behind
[1:49:02] the
[1:49:04] pulpit if if we're part of the body then
[1:49:06] then we all have a Ministry I I I truly
[1:49:09] believe that father and mother have a
[1:49:11] Ministry Amen to their children to the
[1:49:14] headship of their home it's it's a
[1:49:18] Ministry and this is why as fathers
[1:49:20] sometimes are so burdened down with
[1:49:22] things because the
[1:49:24] pressure is because we have an
[1:49:26] obligation it's not just a choice well I
[1:49:29] don't know I just you know sometimes
[1:49:32] fathers have to deal with things in the
[1:49:33] home and we don't like
[1:49:36] it sometimes it may make mom mad it
[1:49:39] might make the children upset true not
[1:49:42] understanding
[1:49:44] why and sometime we have to break it
[1:49:46] down to them so they can
[1:49:49] understand you understand what I'm
[1:49:51] saying being a a father it isn't all
[1:49:55] about making money amen you can go out
[1:49:57] there and make money and the devil's
[1:49:59] working on your
[1:50:10] wife every member has a Ministry in the
[1:50:13] body and every member every member and
[1:50:16] we're going to wind it down here but
[1:50:19] every member of the body is controlled
[1:50:21] by one
[1:50:22] head Lord there is only one intelligence
[1:50:25] everybody say one
[1:50:27] intelligence that operates the
[1:50:30] body and every member operates under
[1:50:33] that
[1:50:35] intelligence we have had ministers with
[1:50:38] great Ministries within the message that
[1:50:40] have come and
[1:50:42] gone and because they have great
[1:50:45] Ministries and have been able to get a
[1:50:46] following they become elevated in their
[1:50:48] heart to where they see themselves as
[1:50:51] the
[1:50:53] leader the voice to the people oh
[1:50:58] my and they get lifted up in in in Pride
[1:51:04] and it begins to get them to do things
[1:51:06] that God never called them to
[1:51:09] do hello before you know it and it
[1:51:12] happens most all the
[1:51:14] time the message gets pushed
[1:51:17] aside cuz when a man wants to elevate
[1:51:19] himself in the
[1:51:21] ministry there's no room for him in the
[1:51:25] message it hurts him to say the prophet
[1:51:28] said it hurts them to just stay with
[1:51:30] what a prophet said
[1:51:34] right and maybe not realizing it
[1:51:37] themselves but they fulfill what Paul
[1:51:39] said in Acts 20 and 30 where he says
[1:51:42] also of your own selves shall men arise
[1:51:45] speaking perverse things to draw away
[1:51:47] disciples after them yeah so what I want
[1:51:50] to say is no minister is the head of the
[1:51:53] body you with me no minister is the head
[1:51:57] of the
[1:51:58] body brother
[1:52:01] Brandon is not the head of the
[1:52:03] body right amen we ain't got that
[1:52:06] picture there for brother
[1:52:08] brandom we we got the picture there for
[1:52:10] what God
[1:52:13] done right so it's not about brother
[1:52:16] brandom he's not the head of the body
[1:52:19] Colossians 1:18 and he Christ is the
[1:52:23] head of the body amen the church who is
[1:52:27] the beginning the firstborn from the
[1:52:28] dead that in all things he might have
[1:52:30] the preeminence prise the Lord in every
[1:52:34] Ministry over every every member of the
[1:52:36] body he's going to have preeminence amen
[1:52:39] over every
[1:52:40] aspect right so the entire body is
[1:52:45] subject to its head the head tells the
[1:52:48] feet where to go it tells the hands what
[1:52:49] to do it tells the mouth what to speak
[1:52:51] and what not to speak it's the
[1:52:53] intelligence it's the head it tells it
[1:52:55] tells the eyes what to look at see it's
[1:52:57] the head that gives the perception of
[1:53:00] what the eyes are looking at see and so
[1:53:03] that's the intelligence so if Christ the
[1:53:05] word is the
[1:53:07] head and he controls the body then that
[1:53:11] means no man controls you yes hello if
[1:53:16] you're part of the body of
[1:53:18] Christ Isaiah 9 and six tells us that
[1:53:21] the government shall be upon his
[1:53:23] shoulders ain't that right amen we know
[1:53:26] the government is the head and the
[1:53:28] shoulders represent the body body it's
[1:53:31] it's the body so the
[1:53:34] government shall be upon his
[1:53:39] shoulders the government of God will not
[1:53:41] be upon just
[1:53:43] anybody it'll be upon the body that he
[1:53:46] redeemed and claimed for his own amen
[1:53:49] and if you're part of that body you're
[1:53:51] under that headship amen that government
[1:53:55] amen ain't that right that's right so no
[1:54:00] other head is going to rest upon the
[1:54:02] body but his own head which is the word
[1:54:05] of God and all who are subject or in the
[1:54:09] body are subject to the word for he it's
[1:54:11] the headship praise the Lord Brother
[1:54:13] Bram talked about the men and women who
[1:54:15] believe this message you know and he uh
[1:54:18] he said this he said just as soon as
[1:54:20] they heard the message they were solded
[1:54:22] on it 100% prise the Lord notice now
[1:54:26] that could only come by for ordination
[1:54:29] amen it's the only way it could come
[1:54:32] amen the only way that a man can be
[1:54:36] totally sold on this message is by for
[1:54:42] ordination being for ordained to be so
[1:54:45] right now our headship is a kingdom and
[1:54:49] Jesus said the kingdom of God is within
[1:54:51] you amen so brother Braham said now
[1:54:54] listen we are not a denomination we
[1:54:57] belong to a kingdom kingdom and the
[1:55:00] kingdom is the word of God made spirit
[1:55:02] and life in our own life true a't that
[1:55:06] right see the kingdom of God is the word
[1:55:10] of God May spirit and life in our own
[1:55:12] life bringing to pass every promise in
[1:55:16] this day as it did in that day when the
[1:55:20] word and God was
[1:55:23] one oh my and the word and God is one in
[1:55:28] his church today making it the headship
[1:55:32] of the body that is
[1:55:34] redeemed to bring the message in the
[1:55:37] last days and be taken up from the dead
[1:55:39] in the resurrection to go back and
[1:55:40] restore again see as Adam and Eve in the
[1:55:44] beginning In the Garden of Eden see
[1:55:46] that's what the headship is so the
[1:55:48] kingdom which is our headship is the
[1:55:52] word of God made spirit and life in our
[1:55:55] own life bringing the pass every promise
[1:55:59] of God praise the
[1:56:02] Lord praise the Lord
[1:56:05] amen what a Ministry we
[1:56:08] have when the head's connected
[1:56:11] amen see the kingdom of God he says is
[1:56:14] God's word made Power the Kingdom's in
[1:56:16] you and when the word comes in there
[1:56:19] what does this word begin it turns
[1:56:22] itself into Power making it say just
[1:56:25] exactly what it
[1:56:28] said see you can't say it says this and
[1:56:31] it says this and make it work you got to
[1:56:34] say the same thing it says that makes a
[1:56:37] confession amen can you say man so see
[1:56:41] when we're in the body then and the
[1:56:44] headship has come upon on that
[1:56:46] body it starts functioning in in every
[1:56:50] individual starts making it work in
[1:56:53] every individual therefore you're under
[1:56:55] such control that that
[1:56:59] that for example brother Bram talks
[1:57:01] about women working now you know good
[1:57:03] and well brother brah talked about women
[1:57:05] shouldn't be out in the factories and
[1:57:06] they shouldn't be out in here they
[1:57:07] shouldn't be Mayors and they shouldn't
[1:57:08] be this we got more is becoming more
[1:57:11] popular where young our young girls are
[1:57:13] becoming more career-minded than
[1:57:17] anything
[1:57:18] else now brother Brandon condemned it it
[1:57:22] was
[1:57:23] wrong but when you're under a
[1:57:26] headship when you're under that control
[1:57:28] of headship you cannot say well I know
[1:57:32] brother Bram said that but that's back
[1:57:33] in the
[1:57:34] 50s I know he said that but we're we're
[1:57:37] in different days we ain't going back to
[1:57:38] Grandma days something wrong there's a
[1:57:42] headship
[1:57:45] am that's true right surely you believe
[1:57:48] that with me
[1:57:50] I
[1:57:51] believe it's sad when we got mothers in
[1:57:55] this message that are leaving their
[1:57:56] children to Baby Setter so they can go
[1:57:58] do their own
[1:58:00] thing their own careers what they want
[1:58:02] to do yeah that's right you say well
[1:58:05] brother Bram allowed it he said that you
[1:58:07] know if if if we're financially broke
[1:58:09] then yeah we quit spending all them
[1:58:13] money on credit
[1:58:15] cards amen quit trying to be like the
[1:58:18] Joneses
[1:58:20] yeah no pun
[1:58:25] intended quit trying to be like
[1:58:27] everybody else most of America's broke
[1:58:31] that's right they're in debt they're
[1:58:33] driving these fancy things they're
[1:58:35] living in nice things and they're in
[1:58:39] debt that's
[1:58:41] true hello yeah so no wonder the woman
[1:58:45] has to go work but us men ought to ought
[1:58:47] to make it sure that our wives don't
[1:58:48] have to work work amen I want my
[1:58:51] children to be raised by my wife that's
[1:58:54] right right
[1:58:57] hello not by raised by somebody else
[1:59:02] amen so you can't say something contrary
[1:59:05] to what the word says and make it work
[1:59:07] you got to say the same thing it says
[1:59:09] and that makes the confession and the
[1:59:11] only way you do that is you're part of
[1:59:13] the body you're under a
[1:59:15] headship and it's making the word work
[1:59:18] see the headship is the word made spirit
[1:59:21] and
[1:59:22] life in
[1:59:24] you so now you're not just talking about
[1:59:28] the word over there you're not just
[1:59:29] talking about what a prophet said now
[1:59:31] you becoming what a prophet
[1:59:34] said because
[1:59:36] headship your ministry is not controlled
[1:59:39] by you
[1:59:40] then your ministry is under the unction
[1:59:44] of God then God can have his
[1:59:48] way
[1:59:50] God can have his will performed in
[1:59:53] you ain't that right the Lord how do we
[1:59:56] know what the word says one will take
[1:59:59] the Bible and say one thing another will
[2:00:01] take another the Bible and say another
[2:00:03] thing another will take another we got
[2:00:05] all kinds of voices about the Bible
[2:00:09] different ideas interpretations and all
[2:00:11] of that ain't that right and it has left
[2:00:14] every man confused on what to
[2:00:16] believe and and now I realized that in
[2:00:20] the message and and this goes on in the
[2:00:22] message just as much but I realize that
[2:00:25] our understanding of the word may be
[2:00:27] different on different levels we may all
[2:00:29] be on different levels of understanding
[2:00:32] of the word of God and so we're not
[2:00:34] going to see out to eye on everything
[2:00:36] but I don't believe that any true
[2:00:39] Revelation that is given by God will
[2:00:42] take away from the word of God I mean we
[2:00:45] might we might preach you know just the
[2:00:48] simple scripture of John
[2:00:50] 3:16 and and and it may be preached in
[2:00:53] Simplicity it may be preached in depth
[2:00:55] it may be preached but it's all focused
[2:00:57] on the same thing it's not taking
[2:01:01] away hello amen no matter how simple it
[2:01:05] is so so brother Bram says in the Old
[2:01:08] Testament if a prophet prophesied if a
[2:01:10] dreamer dreamed a dream no matter how
[2:01:12] real it seen before the church ever
[2:01:15] would accept it it had to be proven by
[2:01:17] the urum Thum you know that breastplate
[2:01:20] of Aaron where the lights reflected when
[2:01:22] that priesthood ended the urum th went
[2:01:25] with it but we've got a new Ur thumb and
[2:01:27] that's the word of God if your
[2:01:30] Revelation doesn't tie and and you say
[2:01:32] well God revealed it to me that I should
[2:01:34] be baptized in the name of Father Son
[2:01:35] and Holy Ghost if that don't tie with
[2:01:37] the word from Genesis to Revelations tie
[2:01:40] it together then your Revelation
[2:01:42] wrong well you say well God revealed to
[2:01:45] me that I should be baptized in Jesus
[2:01:47] name if it doesn't with the word then
[2:01:50] the uran Thurman don't back it up no
[2:01:52] matter how real it seems this is the
[2:01:55] authentic word this is God's Ur
[2:01:58] th so no matter what Revelation how
[2:02:01] simple how
[2:02:05] whatever and it may seem real it may
[2:02:07] seem right it may seem true but here's
[2:02:09] the word right here here it is amen as
[2:02:12] we're going to get into it more but you
[2:02:14] got people getting this Revelation that
[2:02:16] God's done away with Ministry
[2:02:20] you never be able to tie that with the
[2:02:22] word I've asked them I've asked them
[2:02:25] about it because as soon as they get
[2:02:28] tied with no preachers then there's no
[2:02:30] church we just sat home and listen to
[2:02:32] tapes the house is my church show me
[2:02:35] where in the Bible where that says that
[2:02:37] and they won't
[2:02:38] answer they won't answer because it
[2:02:40] doesn't say that it says forsake not the
[2:02:42] assembling of yourselves together that
[2:02:45] doesn't mean Me Myself and
[2:02:47] I
[2:02:51] right
[2:02:54] amen so we are living in the culmination
[2:02:57] of all prophecy spoke of the church and
[2:02:59] this word culmination is the climax the
[2:03:01] summit or the peak the highest point
[2:03:05] obtained this is where we're at amen and
[2:03:09] all scripture concerning the bride in
[2:03:11] both Old and New Testament must be
[2:03:13] fulfilled by
[2:03:15] us right
[2:03:17] yes
[2:03:20] and in order for this to happen we got
[2:03:22] to say the same thing the word says and
[2:03:24] this is why God calls us out of Babylon
[2:03:26] out of confusion amen see because the
[2:03:29] Rapture cannot happen if we are confused
[2:03:32] on the word of God the changing of our
[2:03:34] body the Millennium the adoption of sons
[2:03:36] manifestation of sons of God cannot
[2:03:38] happen if we're all confused about the
[2:03:40] word of God right can you say
[2:03:43] amen I I I I I could go more and more
[2:03:47] but I'm I'm going to wrap it up but I
[2:03:51] truly believe that in this age God wants
[2:03:56] preeminence in his own
[2:04:00] body and and and when I when I say that
[2:04:04] you know the nine spiritual gifts you
[2:04:06] know well brother Bram said they're set
[2:04:07] they're not pred well he says the
[2:04:09] fivefold ministry are predestinated the
[2:04:11] gifts are set in the church and they
[2:04:14] operate they operate within the body in
[2:04:16] other words he says you know that
[2:04:18] brother Amos may use him to prophesy one
[2:04:21] one night and maybe never use him again
[2:04:25] May jump over to brother Bill or you
[2:04:27] know Sister
[2:04:29] Martha but they they Circle through the
[2:04:32] body they they operate but see it's no
[2:04:34] man's certain gift my gift as a Ministry
[2:04:37] is not my gift this is why even us as
[2:04:41] ministers are going to be held
[2:04:42] responsible for what we've done with
[2:04:44] this
[2:04:45] ministry and every one of us is going to
[2:04:47] be held responsible for the gift that
[2:04:48] God has given because it's his gift and
[2:04:53] therefore we must become so pliable to
[2:04:55] him Lord so yielded to him so submitted
[2:04:58] to
[2:05:00] him and and I know how the flesh works I
[2:05:03] know I know how it works how you know
[2:05:07] the flesh wants you know the the the the
[2:05:10] flesh wants recognition the flesh wants
[2:05:12] this the flesh want the flesh wants to
[2:05:14] do its own
[2:05:16] thing but then God's doing something
[2:05:20] else and it's so easy to jump ship
[2:05:26] yeah when God's trying to do something
[2:05:29] against our
[2:05:31] flesh it's so easy to come against what
[2:05:34] God is trying to
[2:05:36] do
[2:05:38] because we're doing it on our
[2:05:41] flesh
[2:05:44] true anytime that you see a church fall
[2:05:46] apart it's really when Satan's
[2:05:49] battling the church it's never when
[2:05:52] they're in Revival does a church fall
[2:05:54] apart it's usually when people are
[2:05:56] discouraged it's usually when people are
[2:05:58] disgruntled it's usually when Satan's
[2:06:00] been able to work and cause division in
[2:06:02] the church and then they fall apart
[2:06:06] because they lose vision of what God has
[2:06:08] been trying to
[2:06:10] do they lose the fact that God is
[2:06:12] blessed they lose the fact that God has
[2:06:15] done
[2:06:16] something and they begin to get their
[2:06:18] minds and their eyes on something else
[2:06:22] and God is trying to do something God is
[2:06:24] trying to to bring us to something and I
[2:06:27] say to you church here I don't believe
[2:06:29] that we're here in vain at all am I
[2:06:33] believe that God is trying to bring us
[2:06:34] to
[2:06:36] something whether it's just this
[2:06:38] preacher I don't know I'm I'm going to
[2:06:41] include all of us in
[2:06:43] this but the more and more I'm seeing
[2:06:46] things I'm really believe that God has
[2:06:48] been trying to get me
[2:06:52] somewhere because he wants total
[2:06:55] preeminence he doesn't care about how
[2:06:57] well popular you
[2:06:59] are he he doesn't care about anything
[2:07:03] that you think you should
[2:07:04] be it's what he wants you to be
[2:07:08] right so the ministry in the body must
[2:07:11] be under his headship can you sayen you
[2:07:15] love the Lord amen if musicians will
[2:07:18] come
[2:07:19] hope we've helped you in some
[2:07:23] way church it's the headship the
[2:07:26] Dynamics that has come to the body
[2:07:29] that's going to take us home prise the
[2:07:33] Lord and we're sure looking forward to
[2:07:35] going
[2:07:37] home amen but while while we're
[2:07:41] waiting let's make sure that we're
[2:07:43] yielded to him in every aspect of our
[2:07:47] life
[2:07:49] if you have to give up things give it up
[2:07:52] if there's things that you know that the
[2:07:53] prophet has taught and you're struggling
[2:07:56] with ask God for the grace just say
[2:07:59] God I'm not going to make any excuses
[2:08:02] anymore I'm just going to follow
[2:08:05] you the Lord follow your will follow
[2:08:08] your ways can you say Amen prise the
[2:08:11] Lord what good is Ministry if you don't
[2:08:13] have
[2:08:15] him brother Brandon would have just been
[2:08:17] another man come along on the scene if
[2:08:19] he did not have God backing him
[2:08:21] up can you say amen and that's the same
[2:08:25] way that differentiates the ministry of
[2:08:27] the Bride versus everyone else she's
[2:08:30] here fulfilling the word of God the will
[2:08:33] of God she's walking in step and God is
[2:08:36] backing it
[2:08:37] up doesn't mean that it's always going
[2:08:39] to be easy doesn't mean that it's always
[2:08:42] going to
[2:08:43] be applauded by the world the one thing
[2:08:47] about it God's
[2:08:50] applauding God's
[2:08:52] applauding remember brother brandom
[2:08:54] taught told about that pianist that went
[2:08:57] and done a concert there I believe it
[2:08:59] was in Russia when he got finished you
[2:09:02] know the crowd just stood up and there
[2:09:04] just oooing and awing and clapping but
[2:09:06] he just kept looking up there in the
[2:09:10] balcony it just seemed like he didn't
[2:09:12] pay any attention to all the Woos and
[2:09:13] the alls and the
[2:09:15] applauds finally they looked and and
[2:09:18] there was his his
[2:09:20] teacher you would want to know what that
[2:09:22] teacher thought about
[2:09:24] it if the teacher said it's
[2:09:26] okay and that's okay that's the way I
[2:09:30] say if God says it's
[2:09:32] okay whatever it
[2:09:35] is then it's
[2:09:38] okay I love
[2:09:40] him never out loves that's the right
[2:09:43] song the
[2:09:45] Lord can you sing that with me
[2:09:49] I want to do live the
[2:09:54] way he wants me to
[2:09:59] live I want to
[2:10:02] deal until there's just no more to
[2:10:10] give I want to
[2:10:13] love love till there's just no
[2:10:19] [Music]
[2:10:20] oh I can
[2:10:23] never ever
[2:10:27] out oh saying it
[2:10:30] again I want to
[2:10:34] live the
[2:10:37] way he wants
[2:10:39] me to live I want to
[2:10:45] give until there there's just no
[2:10:50] more to
[2:10:52] give I want to
[2:10:56] love love to you there's just
[2:11:02] no I can
[2:11:05] never ever out
[2:11:08] love the
[2:11:10] Lord is they just play
[2:11:13] softly can we just bow our heads for
[2:11:16] just a
[2:11:17] moment
[2:11:20] Church no matter what excuses we come up
[2:11:22] with and how legitimate they may
[2:11:25] seem if it doesn't line up with the
[2:11:29] word we must cast it
[2:11:33] aside thought about the how many women
[2:11:37] are standing behind the pulpit today
[2:11:40] preaching and they have the excuses as
[2:11:43] to why they're doing it and to be honest
[2:11:47] a lot of them seem
[2:11:50] legit a lot of excuses will be legit to
[2:11:53] say oh yeah that sounds really good that
[2:11:55] sounds right that
[2:11:57] sounds sounds like good things
[2:12:00] there but it's against God's
[2:12:03] word so when it's against God's
[2:12:06] word then we have to throw every
[2:12:09] reasoning
[2:12:10] aside and I I will tell you God brings
[2:12:13] us through hardship Christian life is
[2:12:15] not
[2:12:17] easy
[2:12:20] and if there's ever a
[2:12:21] time that each of us as members of the
[2:12:24] body of Christ should be dependent upon
[2:12:26] God it's
[2:12:27] now he promised to be our protector our
[2:12:32] provider he promised he promised
[2:12:36] to to meet every
[2:12:40] need and if we're in his
[2:12:44] will then he will fulfill his
[2:12:47] word if we're outside of his will then
[2:12:49] we're on our
[2:12:51] own not saying that God won't bring us
[2:12:53] in line and he will if we're in elect
[2:12:56] he'll bring us back in line and maybe a
[2:12:58] good whipping whatever it will
[2:13:01] but but what I'm saying is in the hard
[2:13:04] times we can't fall apart and then go to
[2:13:06] plan B we can't say oh God I trust you I
[2:13:10] trust you I trust you when everything's
[2:13:12] good money's in the account things are
[2:13:16] going great life
[2:13:18] you know home Church Life marriage
[2:13:22] children all serving the lord
[2:13:24] everybody's just doing great oh I Trust
[2:13:26] You Lord and then when things become
[2:13:29] unraveled then we start going to plan
[2:13:32] B and what happens is then the questions
[2:13:36] come well are you really a Son of God
[2:13:39] well if you are a son of God this
[2:13:41] wouldn't God be answering your prayer
[2:13:44] well haven't you haven't you asked God
[2:13:46] to help you and he ain't helped you yet
[2:13:47] and seemed like like the Situation's
[2:13:48] getting worse you might ought to try
[2:13:50] this and then if we start doubting who
[2:13:53] we are if we start then we find
[2:13:55] ourselves working outside of God's Will
[2:13:58] and this is where the trust comes and we
[2:14:01] must stay under that headship this
[2:14:03] message is not old timey this message
[2:14:06] isn't for Grandma and Grandpa this is
[2:14:09] message is still appliable
[2:14:11] today and we must stay under that
[2:14:14] headship and yield Our Lives to it and
[2:14:17] let let the message cut us let it shape
[2:14:20] us let us let it mold us to where we can
[2:14:24] become more like God and our ministry
[2:14:28] our character everything about us
[2:14:30] becomes more
[2:14:31] Godlike because you remember that's the
[2:14:33] only Ministry that the body is working
[2:14:35] today is the very Ministry of Jesus
[2:14:39] Christ the very character that Christ
[2:14:42] had is in the body of
[2:14:44] Christ and church we didn't start out
[2:14:47] that way
[2:14:48] that all will end up that way if we'll
[2:14:51] let him cut us and we'll let him shape
[2:14:54] us and we'll let him moce nothing
[2:14:56] happens by accident there's nothing that
[2:14:59] happens to you without God allowing it
[2:15:03] and when he does allow it is for a
[2:15:04] reason don't Buck against it yield to it
[2:15:10] and say God whatever you want out of
[2:15:12] me mold me shape me let me be pable in
[2:15:17] your hands is that your is that your
[2:15:20] desire can you lift your hands and just
[2:15:24] ask God
[2:15:25] God mold
[2:15:28] me let my Ministry be your ministry let
[2:15:32] me be so sensitive to your will
[2:15:35] Lord oh father I pray Lord that's my
[2:15:38] prayer as a minister of this church as a
