be dismissed it's good to be here amen and um um glad it didn't snow amen and U that we could uh have service this morning even it's if it is a few amen and um brother Tim and brother Kevin had to work this morning and so we want to keep them in our prayer amen and um um I think there may be some out of town I don't know but uh so we want to just keep everyone in our prayer the ones that are sick amen but it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen and um uh want to congratulate um brother Matthew uh graduated from the police academy and so um we're just uh believing the Lord to help him and protect him and keep him uh keep him safe praise the Lord and um uh but if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Amos first of all and um the eighth chapter Amos 8 praise the Lord and before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father truly you are our refuge and we're so glad that we're safe hid away in you father Lord we thank you for the opportunity to be able to come to your house this morning and to work worship you and to glorify you father Lord we could be other places that father there's no place like like coming and meeting uh with uh Saints of like Precious faith and to meet with you father now we just ask that you would just move among us and have your way speak to every heart father Lord not only here but uh those that may be watching online I pray that you would just uh uh strengthen our hearts father and may the word just uh come alive within us Lord help us to be more like you father is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord uh so the book of amamos First of all and going to read the start at the 11th verse says says behold the days come sayth the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord and they shall wand from sea to Sea and from the north to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it amen then um if you want to go to the Book of Psalms uh We've read this uh psalms 27 praise the Lord and um brother brandham used this in the uh when he had preached the Rapture message and um it is uh certainly a timely scripture for us but we'll start at the first verse the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid you know it's amazing you can take one scripture and um and it it looks it looks Dreadful you know as we just read there where the famine is going to be in the land and it just seems like you know wow that's that's really rough but if if by God's grace you know the God would send us a prophet and would show us that there's something else that is going on at at at that time when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though in host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon on a Rock Amen then um the scripture we have been reading is Psalms 46 and um the first verse God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will we not fear amen you can have your seats this morning and um so thankful that we can confide in the word of God Amen and trust there's anything that we can trust in that's the word of God but if the word of God means nothing to us if we can't take it for a personal for our personal lives amen it it must be something uh that we take personally just as as uh brother Bram talks about the court case where the the man um was going to be you know he was going to be tried uh uh for doing wrong and his friend had gotten uh a pardon from President Lincoln I believe and Mr Lincoln was in a hurry and so he just scribbled on a piece of paper pardon you know or whatever he did and the friend went back to his friend that's in prison get going to die the next morning and he he told him said you're free I've got your pardon he says oh don't mock me he said that come from president of the United States it would be in a nice piece of paper and da d da you know and uh so he ended up being executed the next day so they they they went to court over it and and these things and you know the story but the conclusion was a pardon is not a pardon unless received as a pardon so the the pardon had the authority I mean it was written there and and it it come from the highest Authority but it it couldn't be effective if the young man didn't receive it in a personal way and so that's the way with the Bible That's The Way with any promise of God it has to be uh received and so when we think of God being present a present help uh in this day then we can see in the scriptures as to what in what way uh he is helping us and uh I I think that is important um you know we we're living in a time of trouble we know that uh it isn't going to get better uh um you know uh the corruption is on every hand and Satan is the the god of the the this evil age and um you know uh we we know and understand I believe that the time of trouble that we're we're looking at and and that we're facing is the judgments of God coming upon the Earth the world is falling apart it's it's a trouble like no other time in the history of of mankind and uh it's it's the end of time it's it's the end of all things more mortality is at its end corruption is at its end politics everything it's it's at its end and as as we know the prophet would take that scripture uh look unto me all ye ends of the Earth and be ye saved and and he tied that scripture to our age that that scripture was applying to this age when all ends of the Earth we're at the ends of the Earth everything is coming to its end it's not just one nation coming to its end uh but it's all things coming to an end and so uh God is shaking not only the Earth but also the heavens as was foretold by the the prophet Paul and according to uh Hebrews 137 it's the removing of those things that are shaken amen it's it's the removing of those things remember God shaking not only the Earth but the heavens and and and this this time of trouble this this what we're living in it's it's a removing of things that can be shaken of as of things that are made so only the things that cannot be shaken will remain amen that's the only thing that's going to remain and and so uh uh so we know that we're living in the day of the Lord uh um and and which is the coming of Christ and and this of course the Prophet Daniel for told of this time and told what would be sh taken and what would remain for here in Daniel 2:31 Thou King sawest and behold a great image this great image uh whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head uh was a fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet of iron and part clay uh uh which was is the Gentile kingdoms starting with Nebuchadnezzar all the way down to this day that we're living in and and then he says and thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smok the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to Pieces ain't that right and so so this is that removing of things that can be shaken see the day that we're living in of course Peter and Paul would tell us that this stone that that Daniel's talking about is a person and and uh 1 Peter 2 and6 wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him that stone him so it's not it he that believeth on it but but believeth on him shall not be confounded and unto you which believe he is precious that stone is precious see but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders dis lowed the same is made the head of the corner excuse me and a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereinto they were also appointed then you go into Ephesians 2:19 now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with Saints with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone ain't that right so then this coming Stone rolling out of the mountain striking that image of course we we know that's the coming of Jesus Christ which is the day of the Lord which we could take all the way back to uh uh uh Revelations 101 and Luke and and so many scriptures that we have talked about before but if you go back to Daniel 2:35 it says uh when that stone had smoked the image says then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the shaft of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them ain't that right so this signifying the removing of those things that can be shaken amen see and it says and the stone that smot the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth so uh uh then you go down to the 44th verse in the days of this king of these Kings shall God Of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed aren't you glad for that amen now think of that because when Paul is talking about the shaking he's going to shake not only the Earth but the heavens also and that which can be shaken will be shaken and that which will remain uh cannot be shaken will remain and then he says wherefore we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken well this is what Daniel is saying when when that Stone comes and the strikes the image which we know uh uh to be the revealed word of God for this age the manifestation of Jesus Christ amen because Prophet told us he is the word do you believe that Christ is the word that's right he is the word made manifest amen and so we we see all of these scriptures coming together in our age amen and so there's no other time that a a man could preach the world falling apart amen like in this age because that's exactly what is happening it ain't the just the United States falling apart it ain't just Rome falling apart or Germany falling apart or Russia but it's the world world that is falling apart because we realize that the stone is Jesus Christ the word made manifest amen and so uh uh we we see what a Ministry amen and says but the god of Heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it it shall stand forever not America not Russia not China but it the kingdom that God sets up that's the kingdom you and I are receiving do you believe them amen see so Daniel 7 and13 we read this last Sunday but he says I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came see that stone so he's called the the son of man he's called the Ancient of Days he's called The Stone he's called The Mighty Angel he's called the lamb amen he's called all God he's just all our all in all can you say amen amen one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days so now he's revealed not as priest he's not revealed as king he's revealed as judge amen amen Supreme judge you believe that amen see and they brought him near before him and there was given him Dominion not a political Dominion not a natural Dominion but a given him a dominion and glory and a kingdom and all people Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that shall which shall not be destroyed you believe that now notice go down that 17th verse and the Saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever oh aren't you glad for that amen so we may not have much in this life but if we can see what God is doing in this age the world is falling apart kingdoms are falling apart amen the the piety of man and the highness and loftiness of man all going to be just done away with but there is a group of people blessed are the meek in heart for they shall inherit the earth and and I just believe that is is the people of God uh uh and so this is where we're at in time amen we're we're we're where it's it's a blending of where it's the mortality is passing away eternity is coming in time and everything that is part of time corruption and everything is going to fade away Fade Out amen is falling away amen but here is a kingdom that's coming in power and there's a people of God that is being recognized as the people of God the children of God Amen and God has promised them a kingdom which shall never pass away aren't you glad glad for that now brother brandham compared this time amen we we know that we're living in the time the stone has come and and and the kingdom God is setting up a kingdom and and these things and church U uh you say well I don't see anything but see that Kingdom God is is having the preeminence in in a group of people in this age amen like never before it's in this age that he has been able to have complete total preeminence in a people that he Redeemed by his blood he purchased amen and and and this is where we're at in this age see amen the kingdom of God being set up amen see but brother brandom compared this time to that of the first Exodus because he he and and he done this in several places but in the Third Exodus you'll you'll hear him compare this age this time with that time of the first Exodus and and and so but but if you look at this we we read this I think Wednesday night but acts 7 and6 and God spake on this wise that his seed Abraham's seed uh should sojourn in a Strange Land and and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil for 400 years and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge God's saying this I will judge that Nation said God and after that they the the people my people that Seed of Abraham shall come forth and serve me in this place uh Exodus 2:24 God heard their groaning so so this is what happened they're in Egypt now they're in the world Egypt represents the world and and and the people are there but they're now they're groaning Amen to be delivered from slavery and to go back to their Homeland amen and God heard their groaning and remembered his Covenant amen with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and I I say this today that amen the message of the hour is is given to us because God remembered his Covenant I'm so glad for that it wasn't just God sending a a prophet just to send it but God remembered his Covenant there's something about this message amen or God would have never sent it to us but God remembered that Covenant just like he done with with here and and so he remembered his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob then you go in Exodus 3 and8 God said to Moses I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the that land unto a good land a large land unto a land flowing with milk and honey aren't you glad for that God remembered his Covenant and says I am come down to deliver go to the 10th verse he says now come therefore and I will send thee a prophet unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt oh my so as as we said brother Brown he read that scripture said what was God doing God was going in the form of a man to judge that nation and to deliver his people ain't that right and how unusual that was to Egypt amen where an old man uh just something insignificant but yet he had got with him he had a message of Deliverance and he brought judgment to a nation and deliverance to God's people aren't you glad for that well hey God has come in the form of a man in this age God came in a form of a man not to judge a nation but to judge the world can you say amen and he has also come to help his elect in this age I I I love the message uh because it's God displaying his care for us and and I've said it so many time that we shouldn't take the message for granted that we should cherish it we should listen to it we we should uh uh uh uh let it be uh a part of us every day of Our Lives amen be because the message God God sent this message it's a message of Deliverance it's it's and and and I I want to go further with this um you know brother brandom likened the day again that we're living in uh to that of Elijah's day so many scriptures speak of this day so many scriptures I believe it was brother Brown said there are more scriptures that speak of this day of the of the second coming than it than they did of the first coming and and so there there's so many scriptures that and and types and things that speak of our day but brother Brandon would liken the day of our day that we're living in to that of Elijah's day God sent Elijah Elijah was a prophet God wouldn't have sent that Prophet with without a reason but God sent that Prophet to bring judgment upon the nation of Israel amen Israel had violated all of God's laws and and and and as as we know God will not let sin go unpunished ain't that right he will not amen I they may be they they may be getting away with it or they think they're getting away with it amen but somewhere God uh is going to not let that go unpunished see and and so uh if you look in first Kings 17 And1 and Elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God liveth of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word think of that now how unusual that would have been that some man amen uh uh would come up to a King amen and and say you know what uh uh it ain't raining except what I say well he's talking to a king that's got everything at his at his fingertips he can call for a servant to come he comes he can call he knows what Authority is but here is this old man a man I don't I don't know how old he was but anyway he was he he wasn't much to look on and and yet he he tells that King it it'll be at my word it ain't raining unless it's my word see and and so but you you would think it would have been enough to cause them to repent but the prophet said they were so removed from the word of God till they couldn't recognize what was being said they were so far from the power of God and the word of God that they couldn't even discern a prophet staying in their mid see and so they just thought it was just a man pronouncing judgment upon them now you know brother Bram tells us that Israel he had they had a temple at in that time a church they had plenty of educated men they had plenty of prophets all over the country they had plenty of priests plenty of scribes plenty of religion he said it's the perfect picture of today see and and he says they even the king of Israel of course was Ahab and he was a modernist you know and and yet the prophet said he was the worst king of them all of all the kings amen before Ahab he was the worst of them he believed in religion certainly he had everything in a Modern Trend he had his 400 Hebrew prophets all of them well schooled and trained and God sent him another Prophet God didn't use His prophets amen but God sent his own Prophet to Ahab and Ahab wouldn't believe it Israel amen see wouldn't believe see and so uh uh the people had gotten so modern Church listen now the people had gotten so modern in their thinking see they didn't want to hear the true word of the Lord they had sincere men they had sincere people they was very religious but notice the great powers of God had been taken out of the church Church the great powers of God why they were in idolatry amen and and so the the powers of God was unknown to them so here a man saying it will not rain but that my word how foreign that would be what man could even Des dare to claim that but but it was God in that man and he was acquainted with the power and authority of God for he had that power and authority do you believe that but they were so far removed from him that it just seemed stupid it just seemed this guy was crazy amen see and the prophet would say that sin and unbelief by false teachers and modernists in the church had brought the place uh to this coming oncoming judgment see amen say that again sin and unbelief by false teachers and modernist in the church had brought the place to this oncoming judgment then they had turned from God's word and his profit to a modern theological terms of the word see so again brother Brown said it's just like the day we're living in exactly the same amen and and and so uh uh uh today you know they they say the word doesn't mean what it says you know uh uh you got the Skeptics that say well the Red Sea actually didn't open up Israel crossed over a bunch of reads and and and and and just a little bit of water or water the Bible says they walked on gr dry ground see and and and so but but they don't believe in miracles they don't believe in the power of God see they they don't believe in these things and and so uh and and and you know uh I think you know in in years ago they decided that Eve didn't eat an appos an apricot and and and it it's just it's constantly modernizing the Bible it it's constantly changing it to fit their idea of things but brother brandham says it takes that kind of a day to bring God's Wrath down upon the people it takes that kind see and so just as it was the cup of iniquity of the amorites had filled up in Moses time amen so has it filled up in this age the C of iniquity amen see and so now notice God knew that it would take more than just an ordinary theology it would take more than just an or any ordinary message it would take more than just preaching the word to crack their Stony Hearts he knowed it would take thus sayith the Lord to send that judgment down upon that people so he know that when he went out with thus sayeth the Lord can you say Amen so so again it it shows that that this message is not just your ordinary message it's not just your uh an ordinary theological uh uh uh a message of of whatever see but it would take thus say the Lord think of that now a man in this age come with thus sayith the Lord and because of it the world is falling apart kingdoms are falling apart time is coming to its end and a famine is in the land do you believe that now church that's how powerful this message is amen it's it's it's a powerful message see so now you know the the prophet had been so long in the presence of God until he could say that the Dew will not fall except at my word amen he he was in contact with God and and the prophets lived in the presence of God until they became the word of God I I think that's the same thing if the bride's to become the word you cannot you cannot become the word by by keeping your nose in in in things that are not right you got to stay in the presence of God can you say amen amen well we know that to be true any anyways so the prophets lived in the presence of God until they became the word and their message their message the prophet said their message is the word itself I I know people you got the critics that pick this message apart but I'm telling you the message is the word itself people say well what's the what's better the Bible or the message you can't tell them apart that's right can you say Amen it's the self same thing it's God sent a prophet with a message and his message is the word of God see because the prophet had thus sayth the Lord do you believe that see so now their message the prophet said M from God when a prophet received a message it might have even been against their own thinking how in the world is it going to happen just like Isaiah when Isaiah said behold a virgin shall conceive he had never seen that happen it was totally against the law of man or whatever um that you would want to call it a virgin being able to conceive but God said it would and he was so yielded to God to where he would just open his mouth and say Behold a virgin shall conceive and yet it may have been against his own thinking can you say Amen may have not been under able to understand what they were saying but they were speaking the word of the Lord and Israel had refused they were in such a bad shape in ahab's time that they refused to hear thus sayth the Lord see because it was too unusual for them they couldn't believe that a man's word could stop rain from coming amen they they they just couldn't believe that just like people cannot believe that a man's word could could bring squirrels into existence a man's word could actually amen bring uh or or cause a snowstorm to to go out of existence a man's word amen think of that amen it's too hard it's for people to believe it because it's unusual and and I I tell you this church sometimes we think it's too unusual amen for God to take our mortal lips and speak his word through it but a prophet said the word is in the bride amen and you've got to believe it you got to know it you got to stay in that presence you got to stay connected in the power of God in order to truly believe that God can take you and speak his word through you but they couldn't believe it amen they can't believe it today they couldn't believe it now brother brandom says see in that day when Elijah came up and he told him said now it ain't going to rain oh it must have struck the headlines amen I don't know what they had if they had newspapers or whatever but you know uh smoke signals I don't know but I guarantee it got around very fast here's this here's this fudy duddy man amen long long beard and and I you know he might have even stunk you know I don't know but be he had camel hair or uh clothing and and and and he comes up there and he he wasn't really dressed uh the occasion to stand before a king but it must have got around that this guy is claiming he's claiming that it ain't going to rain unless he says it you know and and so they you know the prophet says now they looked at their natural re sources here's a man saying it ain't going to rain but at my word dou shall not even fall upon the ground except what I say and they got to looking at their natural resources and the rivers was flowing really good the Lakes were you know maybe overflowing and all the reservoirs were were topped off and they probably laugh yeah yeah we're doing pretty good see and isn't that just the same way people are doing today amen you tell them about the coming of the Lord you tell them about judgment tell them oh we've got it made we've got everything up now amen everything's looking good now for us see but a prophet stands here and says there's no hope ain't no hope see and so you know think of it how can one man's word one man's word change everything they had been doing good they they they had been free I mean they had been whatever they were were doing it they were abounding and how is one man's word going to change it for us amen see they were so removed from the word till it was too unusual for them to believe but God brought judgment just like a prophet said it would brought judgment by sending a famine in the land you see brother brandom says to spurn thus say the Lord would be to cross the line of mercy and then comes the Judgment see and in 1965 brother Brandon would say we're entering into the Judgment because Mercy has been spurned amen God sent a prophet to try to bring this world back to try to bring this nation back to try to get it to repentance and it would not repent and so now he's saying we're entering into judgment because Mercy has been spurned think of it one man his word amen you think of the message that he preached I indict this generation that was not just a a a man just coming up with some message because people wouldn't receive him that was a voice of God speaking through that man and because God stood in that behind that Pulpit he indicted this nation and this generation by one man's word word now we see where we're at the world is in a spiritual drought spiritual famine and people are running to and fro trying to find the word of the Lord coast to coast and yet the Bible says they won't find it and brother brandom says see when God sends forth a message and tells the people and they don't receive it then he withdraws his servant and sends his plagues famine death spiritually speaking physically also but he said you watch for a depression brother you think you've seen something you just wait after a while you ain't seen nothing you think you're dying for a good spiritual Revival you wait till after a bit you just wait long and cried to hear the word of the Lord but he says see that voice that voice was quiet in the wilderness it was laying quiet see in the wilderness somewhere hid away see now that that seems you know uh uh fateful pronouncement there and a fatal thing and it is Amen to this world and to this generation and to the wicked amen man but then you have to take the scripture but the Lord is present to help in the time of trouble therefore we will not fear amen we we're not like those that look at the message and look at the pronouncements and laugh at it and say oh yeah y old FY duddy that ain't going to happen no the Lord has been our confidence the Lord has been our trust yes the Lord has our expectation Cometh From The Lord can you say man and and and and so we realize that we we are in his hands we we are not as as we don't have that judgment pronounced upon us because we look at the promises of God we have his blessings pronounced upon us can you say man so if you look at it God sent a famine to punish the unbeliever and at the same time he made a way for the believer God always does that Prophet said God always does that you can look it in the Bible God always does that Amen in Noah's time God done that amen God was sending a judgment upon the world for their sins and the filth and all that but God made a way for Noah and the believer can you say amen amen amen made a way of Escape in the day that God was going to drown Egypt he made a way of Escape across the sea for his people see so God always makes a way when there is no way amen he is that way can you say it with me he is that way God is that way he he makes a way and and so God made a way for Elijah the prophet said which represents the church to escape the famine and drought amen now he says Elijah had a secret place provided by God himself now the church never provided it for him the king never provided it for him he didn't provide himself but God provided somebody say God provided God provided a secret place for Elijah to be fed all the time during the drought where his food was provided day by day he didn't need to wonder what's going to happen tomorrow or wonder if the supply was going to run out God said I've commanded the Ravens to feed you and they will feed you can you say amen God will move it it it it's supernatural Church you serve a supernatural God you're worshiping a supernatural God that can make a way when there is no way your life is in his hands you don't have to worry you don't have to fear brother brandham says he ordained the Ravens his servants so bless them Birds his servants that kept the voice of Elijah alive during the time of his isolation from the church the Ravens brought him flesh and bread at morning and flesh and bread in the evening and he drank from the little Fountain while the rest of them down there were doing without any spirit spiritual food and water can you say Amen see that that there's no Revival in the land Revival for America is over I don't care how much they shout and they dance they got their nice choirs they've got their professional musicians they've got their professional preachers but Revival is over but that does not apply to the pride can you say amen that's right see so so Elijah God provided a secret place for his life to be sustained people were dying but Elijah's life was sustained he received strength yes he did you look at Elijah he didn't look like someone that hadn't had had missed a meal for a week or two thank of it this famine lasted three and a half month years three and a half years think about that and and and Elijah if you looked at him compared to everybody else he didn't look like he was going through drought cuz God provided a place for him can you say Amen brother Ram says what a wonderful thing a type of our secret place in Christ he's made a way for his believing children to escape it now see the Wrath and things that are to come see so the believer is not in the famine that's right that's right now notice brother brah said we've lived the time out at the time of the Rapture is at hand and we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength that it isn't the church that's going to supply it it isn't a pol politics that's going to supply this God's provided a secret place give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in can you say Amen now not not to keep you too much longer but look Matthew 24 and 27 Jesus said for as the lightning cometh out of the East shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be aren't you glad for that the coming of the son of man the son of man revealed we've read so many scriptures that tith to the son of man the coming Stone that's the son of man coming in clouds amen and and what Daniel saw what John wrote about and and and and and uh Zechariah and and uh Malachi and all of these uh prophets writing about this the son of man will come and notice what he'll be for who wheresoever the carcass is everybody say the carcass see your food amen God going to provide a food for you and that food would be the son of man the son of man will come when in the time of famine Lord and whoo wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered I say to you he's present to help in time of trouble amen the son of man is the carcass the food yes sir he's revealed he in the time of trouble the time when spiritual famine famine strikes amen and noce strength comes from food you believe it sure see so God knew what he was going to do here's a prophet saying that the church is needing a supernatural strength that will change the bodies amen but God would provide it for us through the the com coming of the son of man our strength would be given to us can you say Amen brother brandom in his prayer said we are desirous of thee to give us of that Heavenly Mana that food that would give us strength in the life that's in us not strength of in your natural life but strength in your spiritual life give you strength in your faith give you give you strength in your confidence and give you strength in your your your convictions you give you strength Amen to believe said as the blood carries away this food now to strengthen it to make more sales and to build us strong for the day may we receive of Christ that he might get into our Spirits this morning through the word and strengthen us for the hour that we're living in church God has provided it yes he has brother brandham said that this food this carcass son of man he said it's hidden which goes again right along with what David saying he shall hide me in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock rock revelation of who Jesus Christ is the revelation of the word of God can you say amen amen it's a hidden food but we're hid away where that food is that word hide means to put out of sight to conceal for shelter or protection can you say man so in the time of trouble God God hides the believer where the food is hello yes amen where the food is now now we know that something can be in plain sight and yet hidden ain't that right it can be in plain sight and yet so hidden to man can't even see it it's been proven in the Bible so many times you could look at the prophet Elisha how he came into Plain View remember when when I think it was the king of Syria kept trying to attack Israel they're going to come and Prevail over Israel and every time he he would he would plan something and they would go a certain route there was Israel waiting on them and Israel would drive him back and finally the king thought okay he got his all everybody together and says there's a spy in here somewhere that's telling you know it's kind of one of these uh leakers that we have someone's leaking it out you know and uh uh and finally someone says oh King Ed Ain't So everybody's loyal to you says but what what you don't know is Israel has got a prophet in the land and and he's telling he's telling the king of Israel everything you're thinking in your bed chamber ain't that right and and so this King Assyria says well you you go find out where he is and tell me so they found out where he was he was in Doan so the king got all of his army and told him says you go down there and Surround that City and you bring that man to me so they get around that City and and and y'all know the story The servant woke up one morning you know and he's out [Music] there wiping his eyes no doubt and he opens his eyes you know and I mean he he he he well his heart got to racing and he runs back inside and says oh Elisha we're in trouble you know we're surrounded and so he brought Elisha had to probably drag him out pull him out and says here look look and Elisha didn't skip a beat you know he just said well more are they that are with us than they that are with him right and I I I'm sure the the servant could do a little math and know that that he would something wasn't right you know and and so but the Bible says that Elisha walked right out there in to the enemy walked right out there to the enemy and they didn't know who he was that's right they didn't recognize him and he asked him who you looking for and they told him said well come here I'll show you I'll take you to him led him right to the enemy surrounded him yeah but the Bible says God closed their eyes to where they couldn't recognize him yet they were looking at him but he was hidden in plain sight that's it ain't that right that that goes on with with everything even Jesus amen see so brother random says now he said see today's people are spiritually blind to where the Lord can come in the midst of them and do what he promised to do and they can't see it they don't know his great power because they're spiritually blind ain't that right so he says God blinds the unbeliever from the true Genuine Food of the child the believer ain't that right he blinds the unbeliever from the very thing you're eaten from amen amen people not talk this message you you shouldn't get discouraged and say well maybe there's something about it that's wrong no just know that God's blinded it and your eyes could be blinded as well but God sent the food for you are you with me church we we don't understand these things and that doesn't mean that we're all high and mighty and and more better than other people we ought to be the most humblest people we ought to be the most meekest people we ought to be the most thankful people and and we ought to do our best to try to get people into this message brother brandom just re listening to today says if someone says they got the Holy Ghost and they're not out telling people about God he said there's something wrong with that person individual we ought to be telling people about God we ought to be witnessing to people hello amen tell them about what God has done for us see so so Jesus had to contend with so much unbelief in his day he was the word he was the very word of Prophecy that the prophet spoke of they spoke of him he was he was what the prophet said would happen a virgin shall conceive and there he was right in the beginning God for told of of Christ to come in Genesis 3:15 says I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou sh bruise his heel see so all the prophets spoke of him all the way from Genesis on they they spoke of Christ's coming he was that word manifest and then he performed the works of God and they still wouldn't believe him they they they still wouldn't do it he told them you know that the scriptures testified of who he was and yet they they were so blinded by their traditions and so full of unbelief that they couldn't see him for what he was and and that unbelief still holds to date that people still cannot believe that he was God they say he was a good man he was a prophet he was such and such but there were people that literally cannot believe that Jesus was the son of God can you say Amen they believe him to be a good man see and and even that little that woman told you know brother Brown something I got against you and and he said well I you know I hope that's the only thing and and he's what is it he says you make too much of God or Christ being God and and he said well he was God no he wasn't you know and and and the scripture that she used was Jesus wept you know and and he says but lady says as a man he wept But as God Amen he he he commanded stood there at the grave of a dead man that been dead four days and commanded him to live as God as man he hungered but as God he could turn the water into wine as as man he thirsted can you say man amen but he's would stand on the bow of a boat amen and command the storms Amen to dissipate and and all that why he fulfilled the word that was spoken of him do you believe that church brother bradam F fulfilled the word that was spoken of him this message is is the Bible this message is the Fulfillment of scriptures do you believe that that that's what I'm trying to tell you it it's it's it's more than just a man that came to us it it was God veiled in a body of Flesh Amen to deliver the word of God to us we we we want to be so convinced of that see amen see and so now listen brother brandham see so Jesus is is telling them you know search the scriptures and and because they testify who I am you're so well versed in the scriptures you ought to be able to see me cuz I'm doing exactly what the Bible says I do well brother Brown said see it's the scriptures that tell you the hour that we're living in you don't you don't necessarily have to find you know uh uh you know proof as far as science and all that look at the scriptures amen they tell you the hour that we're living in and the things you see done it's God everybody say it's God it's God himself among his people nothing can raise the dead but God nothing can do the things that he's doing now but him for the Bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever notice what he says don't you see the authority of the Living God in the Living Church the bride the sick are healed the dead are raised the cripples walk the blinds see the gospel Goes Forth in its power for the message and the messenger are the same can you say Amen see so so we look at all of these things of of God in Elijah God in Moses now we're looking at God in a man God in the bride see amen and and we have to look at this message Amen to say it is of god god ordained it it come from God it was God that spoke to us and used a man's voice can you say Amen it was so Supernatural that we have to say that it is God see and so today the world cannot believe that what happened in Tucson Arizona you know uh was the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory they want to say well it was a rocket it it it was smoked from a rocket it was this it's that but see it would take the believer now listen Church it takes the believer to be able to see it and say no that's God can you say Amen we we're not looking at it and and debating this thing and and trying to reason it out we know it's God it was something Supernatural that took place hallelu why it's our food yes it is the carnal the prophet said the carnal Minds wraps up the thing in their own ideas then God sends down and unfolds The Thing by his power so that's what happened to Ahab he got it all in his own thinking how it was all going to be and then God would send a prophet amen and he and his message was one he had that Authority ain't that right the prophet said the messenger the message and the Word was exactly the same thing the prophet the message and the word was the same thing can you say Amen see brother Bram said any man and his message is one he said that's why today that they do not believe in doing the works of God because they do not accept the message of God they don't believe the message but those who believe God's hour that we're living in these things are hidden food can you say Amen these things are hidden food true we don't need to look at the times that we're living in to get strengthened we don't need to and you forgive me but we don't need to study about all of Israel to be strengthened we don't need to get into the politics of things to be strengthened God sent us a prophet and he himself the son of man was revealed through that Prophet Vindicated it the word became flesh and that became our hidden food can you say Amen there's ever a time that we ought to study this message stay in the presence of God it is now can you say amen that's right see so we look throughout the ages Noah's eyes was open to the word of God and the promise Moses eyes John's eyes was open to the word and to the promise of God and we look as as like I say I I'll get ready to close but Matthew 22 1 and Jesus answered and spake unto them again by Parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for for a son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen my fatlings are killed all things are ready come unto the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their City then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy ain't that right so we see this is happening man is constantly making excuses and turning God's invitation to the marriage supper away turning turning it down ain't that right but notice the prophet says when God gives a man an invitation now you think of that now when God gives a man so here we're in a famine we're in a but God has invited God's inviting to a feast come come to the feast see because if you're not in if you're not feasting then you're going to die of famine you're going to die in the drought ain't that right and and and you know if you go look and brother brandom talks about it there in uh God how does that God doesn't send judgment without warning first and he said you might see a man go die and you say man that man didn't know he says oh no no no no he said that man knew he said it might have been he said you never know what God dealt with him in his heart might have just been a little prick one time and the man turned it down or whatever but he said he knew he knew what to do and is that right and so when God gives a man an invitation to do something or to receive the invitation and he's given him and he turns it down then there's nothing left after Mercy is spurned but judgment if you step over the boundaries of Mercy then there's only one thing left and that is Judgment ain't that right see so so and and and I'm talking about God's invitation I'm not talking about man's invitation I'm talking about God's invitation you know uh because there there's been you know I was in Pentecost and you know man you know you there's a lot of times man would be trying to bring an altar call and then he'd say now you know and I've heard it so many times you know there's someone out here you know that should be at this altar if you don't you know do it tonight you're lost you know and that happened so many times and only just brought fear upon the people so I'm not talking about man I'm talking about God and this invitation comes through the message of the hour the spirit of God bringing us to the message so anyways man man has done exactly that in all ages come up with excuses they come up excuses in Noah's day and well just all the way through and and so God would send his Prophet with thus say the Lord people would laugh at it they would just treat it lightly they would walk away from it and and and but what what God was doing by sending the sayth the Lord is inviting them to a feast and they would turn it down see and and so but brother random says the thing that people laugh at is the thing that we pray for hello see the thing that people are laughing at and the world treating lightly that's the thing that the elect is praying for ain't that right amen so so brother Bram talks about the 2,000 years ago how Israel turned down the invitation to come to the the wedding supper that spiritual feast and when they turned it down they went into judgment now notice here Paul would say in 2 Corinthians 2:3 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man man of sin be revealed the son of predition ain't that right see now notice what brother Braham says this Falling Away comes as people get away from the spiritual Feast they turning down the spiritual feast and when they do that that invitation to come to the spiritual Feast amen then there's a great Fallen away this is where we're at can you say Amen what is the spiritual Feast it's the carcass of the word can you say Amen brother Braham said they don't come to the spiritual Feast of his promise Vindicated word so this message that's why it's so different from the the the rest of messages and and and Ministries is because this is the Feast of God's promised word Vindicated it's what Eagles are that's where the Eagles are gathered can you say amen that's right see the word everybody say the word is Eagle food brother brandom called it the fresh clean meat the word of the Season he said you cannot feed the Bride of Jesus Christ Pentecostalism can you say Amen there is nothing else greater that will gather this elect than the message of the hour aren't you glad for that nothing outside of this Vindicated Word of Promise amen I'm I'm so glad that God has brought us to this place amen if the musicians will come the son of man revealed in this day the manifested word he's the one that appeared in the Ohio River just as brother brandham was baptized in the 17th person he's the one who has performed the supernatural things in brother branham's Ministry he's the one who foretold those things perfectly right brother Brown said he was only standing there when he did it he said I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man can you say Amen so you have to feed fully I'm I'm rep paraphrasing it the way brother Brown said he's asking the question but I'm going to he said you have to feed fully on every word to give yourself srength to Fly Above All these denominations and things of the world can you say Amen he's our present help in time of trouble he's the one you're feeding on Amen he's come to bring judgment and we see where the world's Fallen apart but at the same time he's come to be your food to give you strength to fly Hallelujah I love the Lord Psalms 37:39 the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in time of trouble he is their food hidden food in time of trouble can you say Amen oh I love the Lord amen
