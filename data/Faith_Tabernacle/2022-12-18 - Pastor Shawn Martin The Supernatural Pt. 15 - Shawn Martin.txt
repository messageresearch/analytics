Salvage God foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] already [Music] so just the same as his lovely name that's the reason why I love him so for Jesus the sweetest [Music] I'm so glad that we're able just to love him I think that's just a miracle in itself that we could stand in this day of people's rights and where the Bible is prophesied that men would become lovers pleasure lovers of their own selves more than lovers of God and yet we defy all of that and love him we love him that's a paradox amen How could a person with all the pleasure all the things that are around us the most evil age the greatest age where sin is and yet love the Lord amen but I do love him I thank the Lord for his goodness his grace amen and the musicians can be dismissed and certainly good to be in the house of the Lord this morning just to see everyone several that are out sick or out of town and but I'm just glad we was able to come amen and it's good to have my sister and um Chicana with us this morning amen and thoroughly enjoyed both songs amen and enjoyed all the songs today and but you'll be leaving right after service so we want to just keep her in our prayer that she has a safe trip back home and we're getting ready to head for Canada so I think it's cold here but uh they're really going to get in some cold weather but um so we keep them in our prayer but just good to have everyone that's been gone for a while brother Terry sister Alice God bless you good to have you all and brother and sister Walker Amen brother Enoch amen and um just uh always always miss those that haven't ain't able to make it for some reason and we want to keep Sister Kim Brumfield in our prayer and she's hurting pretty bad she had a fall last night and didn't break anything as the doctor said she didn't break anything but she can't move her right arm and so she's in a lot of pain so we want to keep her in our prayer today uh but also it's brother Branson's birthday today and and he's probably in the back but but uh it's his birthday and so we want to wish him a happy birthday does brother shalom's birthday yesterday and brother Matthew's birthday yesterday so we wish them happy birthday as well and uh sure appreciate these fine young men who serve the Lord and um there it's a very a rarity today to find young men young women that want to serve the Lord and but we really appreciate their lives amen and their Fellowship if you want to turn to the book of Ephesians the first chapter 22nd verse yes brother Amos as well and we're continuing to pray for Sister Lisa there and um but we'll be having a prayer meeting Tuesday night for or at seven o'clock so those that would like to come and and also Sunday morning service next week next Sunday and we want to remember service this evening

ministering for brother Stacy good bread this morning and or this afternoon I should say so we want to keep them in our prayer but the book of Ephesians the first chapter and I'm going to just read the 22nd 23rd verse and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all amen let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we humbly bow before you this morning recognizing Lord our need for you Lord we're nothing without you father we can't even walk without you holding our hand and Lord we can't speak this morning on the things that we would desire to without you speaking through us father we can't even believe without you believing through US lord it's it's your faith that you give to us and father how thankful we are Lord and we just ask that you would take complete control let this service be yours and in your hand father move not only for in the speaker but move in The Believer father oh God just have your way we invite you Lord to do anything that you would want father we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you can have your seats this morning and I'm going to continue on the subject that been speaking on and and using the title the supernatural I I believe that this this uh title is is relevant to what we are speaking about for the Church of the Living God is the supernatural it is Supernatural brother Brown said it's a supernatural body that men and women are born into by the Holy Spirit and its simple way so these men and women that are part of the body they believe in the Supernatural because they've had a supernatural experience for themselves and and so what we talk about it's we know it's a reality we know that angels are real we we we know that the spirit of God is real we know that God can do anything that he wants to do and it's a supernatural power that's holding us up it's everything about our Christian walk is Supernatural I think even just our families God keeping our families together it's a supernatural thing uh keeping our mind intact it's a supernatural thing everything it's it's just Supernatural and I and I thank God for that it the supernatural cannot be explained and so we dare not try to to explain it in in any way we just believe it a man can explain how the happen and we believe it can't can't explain how a man could stand there and call the son to stand still but but it did it and we believe that can't explain a lot of things can't explain you know how man could be in the woods and speak a squirrel into existence but it did it it happened and and we believe them things and so God is Supernatural and there is no way to explain God or his ways uh uh Isaiah 55 9 says for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts and and so this is why we come uh to service this morning and we come with great expectation and no doubt that you're battling with things and no doubt you're facing things that just seem to be impossible but it doesn't stop us coming with victory in our heart it doesn't stop us coming with praise on our lips because we believe in the Supernatural we may not be able to explain how it's going to happen but God is going to move we we may not be able to explain when it's going to happen but God's going to move and there ain't no obstacle that we face that is going to hinder God from doing it for he is Supernatural and we believe in the Supernatural because the Supernatural is us that's that's it follows us it's with us every every day that we're that we're maintaining a Christian Life That's a CR that's a supernatural thing I I hope you understand that it's God that's holding you and not you holding yourself it's God that desire I I you know when we pray as a family I always thank God for waking us up uh in our right minds and giving us a heart to serve him because you know how else can you have that desire it's a supernatural thing and we must never ever take them things for granted now we've been talking about the Pentecost and and the day of Pentecost and I you know what happened on the day of Pentecost cannot be explained it was the supernatural birth of the Church of the Living God and God God supernaturally planted that little Pentecostal seed that day and and brother Branham called it that little seed of Pentecost and now you know uh and I'm just going to take my time this morning and and talk uh to you but my reason for for speaking on this subject is to show that we're part of that church and even though we've got nearly 2 000 years of separation between that time and and and and and us now but we are still linked to that that first church we are are still linked and and all I can say it's still Supernatural it was It's Supernatural because we as you study the church ages the seals and and you know the history of it and how far the church has gone and and and these things and I you know I've I I had it at one time I had uh a series of DVDs um that uh uh I can't even remember the title of it now but it was about Israel in The Six Day War and and all the battles and how that God fought the battles for them and and and things like that and and they said that they're the only people they're the only people out of all these years and and it was Jews that was uh doing some talking there and and you know out of all the years of being scattered in the world they're the only people that still has their original language that has been scattered out in the world and yet they come back and they have their original language that they speak and and and they were talking just how amazing that was well I say It's Supernatural I'd say It's Supernatural they they even say that you know that that they they don't really even know the 12th tribe of Israel and all of that but you know what God does and they're supernaturally going to come together there's going to be 12 what 12 000 out of each tribe that's going to come and there ain't going to be one less or one more twelve thousand out of each tribe of those 12 tribes are going to make it do you believe that and and and and we can't explain it we can't put science to it all we know it'll be a supernatural work well I believe it's the same thing it's a supernatural happening what began on the day of Pentecost was a supernatural thing and we can find that the supernatural has been following us all the way through and it's here with us today and so that's that's my focus and brother random says if Pentecost was God's Vine which was a the new Vine that has grown up then these four destroyers has been the one that's eat the vine down now let's find out what Pentecost had and find out what we got lacking and then we ought to find out what the Destroyers are and who they are ain't that right so the day of Pentecost is not only my focus but it's the whole the whole beginning of the church or the first church uh uh there to see what happened in the church that first church after the day of Pentecost because again we're tied to that church a man and so we know again that the day of Pentecost was the birth or the inauguration of the church and and and a great thing happened on that day it was a it again a supernatural thing uh but did the disciples go back to being what they were uh what they were before the day of Pentecost or did something continue with them now I I just happen to believe that something changed them that that when they left that Upper Room something followed them the rest of their lives uh uh it changed Peter from a cow or to a to a having boldness ain't that right and and it it changed their whole lives and so what that experience that that they received supernaturally changed them same body same same person but yet something changed them inside of them and so you know uh um we we find that some people have uh something happened to them in a service but then afterwards they go right back into the same muck and mire and they they go back into the same pit that they they came from uh that go back to being the same person that they were before well that's not what happened on the day of Pentecost you understand what I'm saying some go for a little while and and they're and and and you think okay well let's let's give them some time let's see what happens and then they go right back into the same routine uh that that they were before uh they they received that so-called experience and and they might have received an experience but I'm talking about a supernatural experience that happened on the day of Pentecost can you say man and and and and and a lot of them don't even go all the way back in the world but what they do do is they become mediocre Christians they become lukewarm Christian they they maintain a a a a a spot in the church they they maintained that part they maintain rituals of religion but when it comes to really being on fire for God something happens and and I have to tell you a man that's not what happened with Peter you never find Peter becoming lukewarm you never find Paul becoming lukewarm you never find the 120 being lukewarm you just never found that because they received and experience uh of God that no man could ever explain and no man could take it away from them can you say man and and and so after after the day of Pentecost did did these people become some Scholars of of and educators of the Bible did they promote psychology after the day of Pentecost did they become professors of Christianity without the supernatural following them or uh are are they the only ones that received a Pentecostal experience and then all of their converts that they won to Christ all they had to do was just believe and say you got it I just believe I just believe uh uh did they teach that there was a certain way to receive the Holy Ghost did all their converts have to do what they did when they received it you understand so so there's a lot of questions uh you know uh uh that I would have uh uh I I just don't believe that they became educators of the Bible I just don't believe that they become just uh uh uh philosophers of the Bible I don't believe that they promoted psychology to the people after the they received the Holy Ghost I just don't believe that they taught that you had to have do a certain thing and be a certain way in order to receive it can you say amen amen the Bible doesn't teach any certain way that a man had to receive the holy ghost that comes later through denominational teachings that that there has to be a certain way a certain criteria a certain thing all Peter said to them was repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall everybody say you shall you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he didn't say repent be baptized and you come to me and I'll I'll teach you how to get the Holy Ghost or or you repent and you be baptized and then you come to the altar amen and you'll receive the Holy Ghost he said you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost repent can you say amen and and so we we find that we you know there were people in the Bible that received the Holy he goes just by through the preaching of the word they were just setting in their Pew hearing the Minister preach the word and they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost can you say man today you know uh and then you find even in the Bible where where not everybody received the Holy Ghost that way for you find that there was others that had hands laid upon them and they received the the Holy Ghost amen but one thing about it they received the same experience that Peter received and the Mary received and and and the the rest of the 120 receipt they received the same experience they were changed forever and ever can you say Amen well today some have have received at least by setting in their seat I I remember my my uncle little will he was little a year older than I was I believe he was or a little older but anyway but but um you know he had no emotions whatsoever you know and and he hated church he hated well he despised God and and and just uh he he was something else but one day God got a hold of him and and he he uh he called Wendell you know during the night uh I don't know two in the morning or so wanting to get get saved so Wendell Wendell led him to Christ and and um that's all Nathan talked about was the Lord just the Lord the lord lord well and then you know about that time in the morning three in the morning he Wendell gets the phone call and and and and uh it's Nathan you know uh I've been reading the Bible and I and and I want to get baptized you know I got to get baptized you know and Wendell says now yeah now well Nathan lived an hour and a hour away I think or a little over from where Wendell was and when was well can't we wait in this can we wait until tomorrow he said no I want to get baptized right now you know so he's well you just come on up then we'll we'll go to the lake you know so they baptized him you know but every time he come to church he just sit there he just is not on the law you know and but he was interested but he was just you know he just he just said it and he listened you know and uh I remember Wendell you know we was in a little church but window was preaching you know and and just out of the clear blue Nathan he jumped straight out of that chair out of that seat I got it got it you know and he starts yelling and and it scared all of us you know we we all Lord have mercy you know and he's I got it and fine window just stops and Nathan okay that's good what did you get a holy ghost you know and and and that young man was changed forever so so we we've seen that that that people have received it sitting in their seat some have received it at the altar some have received it in the woods some is received it in their car Dad talks about how he received it you know in the car him and mom was going to go on a date mom had the Holy Ghost you know and and so uh he uh he he he was ready to go on that date you know and Mom said during can you turn off that car for a moment and and so he turns off the car and he she says I want to ask you Darren do you have the Holy Ghost and and dad said it was just like water just throwing water in his face you know just like huh you know do you have the Holy Ghost and he's you know after after thinking I don't guess I do well Mom Mom prayed him through to the Holy Ghost in that car and and and so uh so you you can you know some people have received it in the prayer line you know some have received it out in the woods or at their home or whatever see so so it it there's no there's no definite way as to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we do know when it comes it'll be a supernatural thing so again Peter just lays this out repent be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so many people put the focus on how it's done uh where it's done when it's done you understand there are some Churches you know in the apostolic that they have Holy Ghost not and it's always on Sunday night you know that if you want the Holy Ghost come Sunday night you know and and and and and and but but you don't have to get it on a Sunday night you can get it right now on Sunday morning you know but but there's no way you know but but so we we focus on things of of how things are done or whatever you know brother Bram even talks about the group that baptizes three times four and the other group baptizes three three times backward and and they become so rigid about these things that that that that that that God can't move among them amen you understand what I'm saying so now if if a man uh does not truly repent then there's no power in water baptism no matter what you do you understand what I'm saying and I'm not saying it's the water baptism that saves you but I'm just telling you it does you no good amen to to to uh to get baptized if if you're not truly repentant in your heart but you know what if a man truly repents he can actually get the Holy Ghost before he gets baptized hello so the repentance is the is the main thing get the repentance if you truly repent actually get the Holy Ghost before you even get baptized acts 10 45 and they have the circumcision which believed were astonished as many came with Peter and uh because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God then answered Peter can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord now if if if they got to quote with me but I'm uh and it may not be verbatim but brother Bram said God will fill a man with the Holy Ghost knowing he will get baptized he will get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ can you say amen amen that's right and and so we we find a man that you don't have to wait for a certain order uh for the supernatural God to come and fill your life ain't that right now we know that the people in the upper room that 120 had to wait but they had to wait until the day of Pentecost had fully come ain't that right so they were up there 10 days before Pentecost uh the the day of Pentecost was fully come so they had to wait amen but in in this time or or even in the Bible after the day of Pentecost did one person have to wait a man to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it wasn't that way amen and and if you want the Holy Ghost this morning you say well I need the Holy Ghost well if you need it you can have it right now now that that's just the way it is and that's Bible that that that that's what it is because uh uh oh if you could understand amen that God already saw the names before the foundation of the world a man who would receive the Holy Ghost and he had already planned to give the Holy Ghost you understand what I'm saying that that was part of his plan so you're not waiting on God to do anything brother Branham even talks about it you know that that he said I used to you know used to we could teach it in such a way that you get that person to repent and they get baptized as soon as they come out of the water they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost a well you see there's no time for waiting it's really upon the person's heart can you say man the condition of Faith a man and so uh uh because brother Brown says God forgives you the Holy Ghost when he recognizes your faith ain't that right amen see recognizes your face so it's not God Amen if you're not gotten the Holy Ghost you say well I've repented I've I've gotten baptized in Jesus name and and I still ain't got the Holy Ghost well then there's something wrong there amen is just plain and simple there's something wrong can you say amen amen that's that's right see now now notice what was it that the 120 received on the day of Pentecost a man in the main Foundation of what they received is Luke 24 49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen acts 1 8 but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me so that power the Holy Ghost the power they receive made them Witnesses unto him both in Jerusalem and all judeans uh Samara and unto the outermost parts of the earth even today ain't that right so they receive power not from a bishop not from a Creed not from a denomination not from the pope it received power we're from on high it was a supernatural happening a supernatural event amen the prophet said the power of God took over the church on the day of Pentecost can you say man and that power is still taken over the church today we're part of that church you're not lacking power the power is here do you believe that yes sir if you're part of that body amen so we we find that any other time that a person received the Holy Ghost after the day of Pentecost they received the same power that they received on the day of Pentecost brother Branham called this power quickening power another place he called it Pentecostal power amen but whatever power it was it's the same power that's here today amen and so a person that really receives the Holy Ghost today that same power is is with them in them changing their lives do you believe that now the Bible gives us insight as to what took place on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2 and 2 and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it set upon each of them ain't that right and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so now according to the message of the hour this is an account which describes the order in which the Holy Ghost came on the day of Pentecost first thing that happened a wind came into the room ain't that right AI that when was the presence of God coming amen the second thing that happened there appeared cloven or divided everybody say divided cloven tongues or divided tongues of fire that appeared to them ain't that right now now the prophet said it didn't say divided tongues were in them a man or they didn't speak in divided tongues see they weren't doing that but divided tongues appear to them ain't that right now brother Brown said see it's not on them yet but it's there in the room with them circling around like in the wind I I I liked uh if you if if you get a chance if you hadn't listened to it or been a while go back and listen to God hiding himself in Simplicity they're in Albuquerque and the the the last I think 40 minutes of the sermon brother Brandon begins to talk to them about those that wanted to receive the Holy Ghost and and and uh he had them to stand up and just begin to praise the Lord and he he told now just Just Praise the Lord forget about everything just just begin to Praise Him and the people began to praise him and and people begin to scream and he said now see that's the Holy Ghost that's the Holy Ghost and and and and at one place he he he he called I think brother Shakira and he said brother Karen can you can you see that pillar fire going from wall to wall and he said no brother Brandon I can't see that well brother Branham could see that the pillar of fire was not in them people yet uh uh but it was in the room with them can you say Amen it was in the room and it was looking for someone just to surrender it was it was actually looking for someone just to be so yielded and you'd find it where he says now look look look look it's coming down on that sister pal you know and and you'd hear her uh uh reaction to that and and so they they anyway it's it's interesting you need to go and listen to that but here so the the pillar fire was in the room clothing tongues a fire was in the room circling around like in the wind and and so it was tongues the prophet said like fire that appeared to them and it rested on them ain't that right it didn't go in them as of yet but it rested upon them now the King James version tells us that it's set up on each of them and the prophet said how could it set you know set on them but it rested on them can you say Amen see it he says that's incorrect because it couldn't go up there and sit down but the original says it rested up on each of them a tongue of fire a tongue of fire set upon or rested upon each of them 120 people can you say amen and the next things that happen is they were all filled with the Holy Ghost ain't that right now so what was it the supernatural life came into them God divided himself up into them people that and that was the goal that was part of God's drama God's plan was to live in his people amen not for the people to say I've got something and they ain't got it that God to literally come into them and you will know that it would come is because it would change them it would Quicken them it would it would make them so different that they became oddballs they no longer tried to just uh uh uh float around with the world they they no longer tried to fit in society God wouldn't let them fit in society God wouldn't let them just float around he was in charge of them he's the one that quickened that mortal body can you say Amen they were no longer trying to be and fit in with the crowd and rub shoulders with everybody amen they were so changed that the world recognized well didn't didn't someone say about them having these men turned the world upside down Peter gave his life every one of them gave their lives for this gospel they didn't care they didn't it didn't matter amen they could threaten them they could whatever amen but they willfully gave their lives because they were quickened by the Holy Spirit they were Quicken and notice they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was nosed abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language ain't that right now this doesn't give us any other account as to what happened as far as I know uh what happened on the day of Pentecost or uh uh or what happened in the upper room and when they came out of that room that day then just what I read to you amen so so it's it's it's kind of uh that that's just what you read right there well then we find that brother Branham gives us different accounts as to what happened on that day uh here brother Brown said they wasn't talking they wasn't jabbering they wasn't doing nothing but just making a noise cloven tongues sat upon them as if it was fire oh they couldn't hold themselves and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost ain't that right another place when God poured in his life into the first branch of the tree that tree began to act like drunken people they staggered under the impact of the spirit lovely holy little women like the Virgin Mary out there acting like she was drunk for she was drunk up on the spirit and she tried to talk and she could not now whether that's in the up room I don't know he said out there so I don't know if that's in the upper room or out of the upper room it don't matter to me see so she tried to talk and she could not she had stammering lips which means cloven just a stammer in other places brother Brandon said stammering is stuttering trying to say something but but but but but but but but but but can't so trying to say something she was so full of the holy spirit that she couldn't say it see stammering lives and all of a sudden with another language they spoke out ain't that right so that's an account that brother Brown gives us so they notice if they were stammering couldn't say anything they were so impacted by the spirit of God so wrapped up that and and quickened that they couldn't say nothing they're just stammering and then all of a sudden they begin to speak in another language now in another count that brother Branham gives of it he said what was more of a mess than a dignified bunch of Jews that day than to see these people coming out there with stammering lips so here they're coming out now of the upper room they've been filled with Holy Ghost they come out staggering out of the upper room and they're just stammering they're making noises they're they're they're they're not making any sense to these people you understand what I'm saying now so now to me it doesn't matter whether it was in the room or outside of the room I just believe that they stammered stuttered and they spoke in another language and what they'd done is exactly what the Bible says would happen there in Isaiah 28 and 10 for preset must be upon precept precept upon precept lying up on line line up online here a little there a little for with stammering lips everybody say with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear well they had stammering lips and other tongues ain't that right brother Brown said when they completely surrendered and gave theirselves over to God God gave them a Pentecostal reality now church God will give you that too and I know he's given us uh several of us a Pentecostal reality and and what I'm saying is when you get the Holy Ghost you will get a Pentecostal reality now again the thing that was promised to them was you going to receive power after you received the Holy Ghost can you say Amen now the prophet said see God gave them a Pentecostal reality he led them up to Pentecost and give them the Holy Ghost so that's the Pentecost reality is receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost God God ain't putting up with all of this nonsense of people being religious and not coming to a new birth then you say amen and as we've said before the prophet says that a new birth is messy a birth is missing can you say amen and if you don't want to act crazy then you ain't gonna get the Holy Ghost if you're going to tell God God now I'll get the Holy Ghost but I don't want to get out there and dancing that ain't my nature amen well it might be God's nature you understand what I'm saying it's God's nature coming in you and taking over this Mortal body and whatever God wants to do with you you just say God I want it no matter what happens I don't care how crazy it looks if they if they call me a drunk if they call me an idiot if they call me crazy I don't care I don't care if my friends forsake me I don't care if I get embarrassed I just don't care all I want is the reality of what they had on the day of Pentecost can you say man so see they were he says he led them up to Pentecost and give them the Holy Ghost and there where they uh there were they under the spirit of God making all kinds of foolish signs to the people stammering and stammering and carrying on see so we we know what a stammer is is someone that cannot talk plain so the Pentecostal organization teaches us that it was unknown tongues that they were speaking but we know that that was that's wrong that's that's not even right but that's the Pentecostal conception of today now I looked it up unknown tongues is something which cannot be understood without there being the gift of interpretation so that's what unknown tongues are it's something that cannot be understood without there being the gift of interpretation amen see but according to the account that is given in in uh the book of Acts and what the prophet of God said they did not speak in unknown tongues because that every man heard them speak in his own language ain't that right now we know that this was a supernatural thing in itself a man not only uh uh well because there were there were uh uh well if you look at the Bible it looks like there's about 15 different countries and there could be more uh that maybe was not mentioned I don't know but but we do know there were thousands of them there in in the city that day and there was at least 15 different nationalities of men that that uh spoke in different languages around and and so uh uh and and and so uh uh and they all said this uh there we do hear them speak in our tongues or languages uh the wonderful works of God can you say man so even brother Brown tells us the 120 was not speaking in an unknown tongue uh uh here he says cloven tongue set upon them stammering they couldn't talk they were so full of the glory Holy Ghost filled them and out in the streets they went jabbering and you say man so it was not unknown tongues that they spoke brother Ram says see we want to change that around saying they had tongues of fire and here jabbering around and then went out and began to speak with an unknown tongue there's no such a thing as that in the scriptures friend any now listen to this anyone that speaks with an unknown tongue upon receiving the Holy Ghost does it contrary to the Bible so I'm going to say that again anyone that speaks with an unknown tongue upon receiving the Holy Ghost does it contrary to the Bible can you say Amen now I'm going to be honest with you I was so confused a lot as as as when I was young because I knew I didn't speak in tongues when I received the Holy Ghost you know and and and so I you know did I did I receive the Holy Ghost did I not receive the I thought I received the Holy Ghost but I didn't speak in tongues and and it was it was a lot of confusion for me and and even I remember my brother uh uh uh had had had you know wanting the Holy Ghost so bad and trying to find the Holy Ghost trying to get the Holy Ghost trying but the main you know thing we thought was speaking in tongues and and these things but we find here thank God for a prophet that anyone that speaks with an unknown tongue upon receiving the Holy Ghost does it contrary to the Bible I believe now notice I believe in speaking in unknown tongues and so do we we believe in speaking in unknown tongues can you say Amen but not everybody say but not upon receiving the Holy Ghost pushed see that's a gift of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is a spirit can you say man so again modern Pentecostals say that that uh the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost is is speaking in unknown or Angelic tongues but it's contrary even to the Bible ain't that right brother Brown said they had the cart before the horse for in Acts 2 the people spoke in a perfect dialect which even unbelievers heard and understood ain't that right see so so we find uh uh the the the uh that so that's not the the evidence of the Holy Ghost unknown tongues all throughout the message there is one thing uh he gives different accounts of different things but all throughout the message there's one thing that brother Branham solidifies in our hearts and that is speaking in unknown tongues is not the evidence uh that you have the Holy Ghost can you say Amen so now the prophet we know they spoke in a dialect we know they spoke in a perfect dialect language but now what language did they speak in brother Branham actually shares different thoughts as to what language they were speaking on the day of Pentecost he says he filled them 120 temples that was up there with himself with the Holy Ghost itself see the Shekinah Glory broke through upon the him uh just a moment Brother Sam can you turn that heater on it's cold I'm I'm kind of sweating a little bit up here and and it's uh it's kind of cold sorry if you're if you're burning up I it might just be preaching hell and fire and brimstone I don't know no but anyways the Shekinah Glory broke through upon them and then what Nimrod failed to do build a temple where every man spoke contrary to what he could understand so so notice that that and and and I got more quotes that I'll get into later on but brother Branham types confusion unknown tongues if unknown tongues cannot be understood in in an audience it's Babylon it's confusion that that's what it is that's why Paul would put it in order that when you're alone you speak with unknown tongues but don't speak it in before the people unless there is an interpretation to that so then what Nimrod failed to do build a temple where every man spoke contrary to what he could understand see so that that's what that's what Nimrod see he built the temple uh and God confused the language to where no one could understand what they were saying see see God came down and with one Galilean language made every man understand what he was saying and they know it was uh brought ain't that right in another place the biggest part of them was Galilean see uh uh the and for the people said are not all these galileans which speak well they could have been speaking Galilean but they were hearing them in another language it could been they were speaking another language their own language see see either way wouldn't matter now that's where we you can't get so rigid on what language they spoke in brother Brown said I really don't matter the key is it was not unknown tongues can you say Amen so whether they were speaking Chinese Greek or whatever it don't matter see and and whether they were speaking Galilean it don't matter we just know that every man heard them speak in their own language right so either way it wouldn't matter it still doesn't make the Pentecostal conception right because listen here's why not to say something different but just to set the fact straight why did Peter get up then and speak to the whole multitude and they everyone heard him in the language he was speaking for three thousand was converted of stunts Jews who were just as staunching their religion as could be but they must just understood every word Peter was uh of of Peter preaching on the prophets and so forth bringing up the Pentecost where they screamed out and said men and Brethren what can we do to be saved see and Peter said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of your sins ain't that right now brother Branham talks about uh an experience that happened to him and and that was I think he was in Mexico and and Billy Paul had taken him off the uh to you know taking him out and ushering him out and he was so weak and all that but he turned around and he saw a Mexican girl it was a teenager and and he said Billy I I want to talk to that girl and he said Daddy you can't you we got to get you he goes no I want to talk to that girl and so anyway made room where he could talk to this young lady and and well then brother Brown said I found out as I began to talk to her she just kept sitting there with her head down and I'd ask her a question she just said well found out she didn't understand English so he said we brought an interpreter up and he began or The Interpreter began to talk to her you know what brother Brandon was saying to her and he said all of a sudden I saw a vision and he said I began to tell her what I was seeing in the vision and she's stepped back and she's she told The Interpreter said I thought he's I thought he couldn't speak Spanish and and brother in the term interpreter asked president did you just speak Spanish because I didn't think so so they they actually uh later on don't hold that tape and and went and listened to it it was perfect English he was speaking English but the girl was hearing her and brother Brown said as long as he was to in the vision and as long as he was shown what the vision was he was speaking her in she was understanding it without an interpreter that's tongues that that's what the Holy Ghost does ain't that right see so he said see then the vision started he said you know they don't interpret Visions because you're speaking constantly never interpret a vision until it's over and then they tell them what happened he said I saw a vision he said I saw that little girl about six years old and he begins to tell her what happens see and quickly before anyone she looked up to that interpreter see and and The Interpreter asked did you speak in Spanish he said no I I spoke English see and so uh uh anyway he says as long as that Vision was gone and I was talking about that Vision in that Vision she heard what I was saying see so it was in God the Holy Ghost interpreting that ain't that right God knows how to get things done can I say this sometimes people are so scared to talk about the message to other people because they're afraid they're not going to understand but I I just got to say this if you're under an inspiration and if that is a righteous seed somehow someway the Holy Ghost is going to make sure they understand what is being said I just believe that I don't think we got to take down our pictures for visitors I I just don't think we got a quick quote in the prophet so we don't scare visitors I just believe if you preach the prophet and get inspired somewhere somehow God will make sure they understand can you say Amen isn't that not what the Holy Ghost does here was 120 and there was 3 000 people that need to be saved and birthed into the church and God would take that old dumb Galilean that he made sure amen that they understood every word that Peter was saying just get under the inspiration stay under the fire of God can you say Amen that's right see now brother Brown says now in another place how did they know they were galileans if they wasn't speaking Galilean see they all dressed alike how did they know they were galileans are not although these that speaking galileans how do we hear every man in our own tongue wherein we were born then up gets another man a Galilean Peter and began to preach to them and somehow another in that multitude of people three thousand Souls understood him and came and was converted and gave their lives to Christ ain't that right but now notice so so one place brother Brown says they were speaking Galilean now brother Branham now goes into another place and he said they were staggering like drunk men like drunk men talking not knowing what they were saying but we're preaching to the congregation in languages they didn't know but the congregation knew can you say man see so if they were galileans and they were speaking Galilean then they would have known what they were saying that brother Brown says they didn't know what they were saying but the people understood what they were saying so brother bran gives different accounts see speaking in language they didn't know see but the congregation knew see another place brother Brown said they didn't care how much uh well How They carried on or how their Church manners was screaming and crying and shouting and jabbering off languages that seemed like they was talking to one another and couldn't understand it see then them men out there in the audience of other nations and other tongues began to hear what they were saying they didn't know what they were saying they were jabbering but other people out there understood it can you say amen and see so they said these persons are certainly drunk so in another place brother Brown said they couldn't talk in their own language they were jabbering off so now they're not speaking Galilean they couldn't speak in their own language they were jabbering off something else the Bible says cloven tongues clothing is a parted tongue not saying nothing just jabbering running around like a bunch of drunk people see tell you birth is a mess foreign there in the upper room come out there speak in another language staggering like drunk people staggering and carrying on women see his own mother all of them uh uh in the upper room come out there jabbering something that nobody could understand what they were doing at first they had cloven tongue set upon them cloven means parted divided no one understood what they were doing they were just jabbing around and acting like they were drunk ain't that right so we see that brother Branham gives different accounts as to what happened in the upper room and what language they were speaking see in other places brother Branham says they were speaking in a Heavenly language a Heavenly language not Galilean not an Earthly language Heavenly language they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated upon each of them and it so quickened their body till they couldn't even speak and in an Earthly language anymore it quickened their body to a Heavenly language the place they're going to quickening power of God shook their mortal bodies so till their entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language can you say Amen see what a quickening power what something that belongs if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in your moral bodies it shall also Quicken your mortal bodies we are quickened then by the power of the Living God tongues quickened to a heaven new Heavenly language to speak to them a rapturing up raising up into a different atmosphere than what they had ever lived in with the new quickening life to them that come in them it quickened their language they spoke in new tongues now brother Bram Ties That to Mark 16. ain't that right so what they were doing was scriptural they were speaking in new tongues brother Brown says a Heavenly language not a mortal language not an Earthly language a Heavenly language and you say Amen their mortal bodies being quickened their language was quickened their thoughts were quickened their Spirits were quickened their life were quickened they were quickened all together they tried to talk and couldn't talk in any more human languages they were so quickened up in the presence of God till they spoke a new tongue a Heavenly language ain't that right so that's what Jesus promised that that it would do tongues is what God promised amen that the that the church world is telling us that's uninspired March 16. but brother Brown said it is inspired it's part not only of that day but it's part of this day it's the last commission not only to lay hands not only to cast out Devils but to speak with new times so we find notice brother Brown says the the sick being healed Devil's being cast out and speaking with new tongues is the word everybody say is the word in action here's the word in action the sick being healed is the word in action new tongues being spoke is new uh the word in action Devil's been cast out is the word In Action Program said look it quickened their bodies until they flew So Close To Heaven till it quickened their body to speak in a language they never heard of before it quickened their body they spoke in a new Heavenly language they were quickened into the presence of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost God's quickening power baptized them into that and they were in the place of worship then can you say Amen now you know you say well you know uh so now I'm confused what language do they speak do they speak Galilean do they speak some other language do they speak a Heavenly language you know but here's the thing brother Branham was not focusing on that people do but brother Branham didn't but one thing they did do they received power from on high one thing they did do is they spoke a language that the people could understand and you say Amen so whether it was the spirit of God supernaturally working a miracle on the one that was speaking and the one that was hearing I believe it was both I believe that was the miracle was that God would take a an old dumb uh uh Galilean that didn't know how to write to and and read his own name and yet move upon him that he could speak a language that he had never heard before and yet that other uh The Listener amen that was unconverted could hear exactly what was being said it was God that was doing it all hey man I believe it's the same thing God behind the pulpit and God in the pew you believe that I believe that so whether they spoke in Galilean or were they spoke in a heaven language it really doesn't matter to me what language they spoke in I just believe that brother Branham was letting us know that the people understood it as to what was being said and that it wasn't an unknown tongue a young man told Brother Branham one time he says I received the Holy Ghost as they did on Pentecost brother Brown said oh did you he said yes sir I did he said well how did you receive it he said I've spoken unknown tongues he said I received it as they did on the day of Pentecost and brother Brown said he could he knew the exact minute the exact hour exactly where he received it and so brother Brian's like well good you know whatever you know but then brother Brown told him says you know I I don't doubt that one bit that you know he said but it still isn't the evidence that that you have the Holy Ghost the young man said oh yes it is so brother Branham asked him he said were people around you when you received the Holy Ghost and he said oh yes yes everybody he said did they hear you speaking in English because they were all English-speaking people did they hear you speaking in English glorifying god of what happened oh no no no no no I was speaking in unknown tongues he said then you didn't get it according to the book of Acts can you say amen he said because there wasn't one word unknown so whether they spoke in a human language or a Heavenly language that's not the point I would readily say that they've done both but I'm not here going to debate on that but I would rather just say they've done both than to dispute a prophet you understand what I'm saying so we we find that even in the Bible there were people that received the Holy Ghost after the day of Pentecost and didn't speak in tongues at all ain't that right so a person can speak in tongues after he receives the Holy Ghost now we know that ain't that right so now now I don't believe that the Bible or brother Brandon gets technical as to tell how long after you receive it you can speak in tongues I believe you can speak at the moment the moment you receive the Holy Ghost it may be a second it may be a minute and maybe 10 minutes maybe 100 years or you may never do it it don't matter you understand what I'm saying speaking in tongues prophesying dream all of them things don't have any anything about you having the Holy Ghost it has nothing about spirituality as we will get later on in into it when we get to the Pentecostal age see so so the point of teaching this subject is not to systematically teach you to where you become so rigid in your way of belief that God can't do nothing else can you say man that like that you know to where we think that you have to act a certain way when you receive it you have to say a certain thing when you receive it you have to do a certain thing when you receive it it's it's God does anything he wants to but if you go back to the Bible upon receiving the Holy Ghost you will receive power and you shall be Witnesses unto him ain't that right that's the key so we want to leave room for God to move ain't that right people can receive the Holy Ghost while dancing we don't put limit on God ain't that right as I've said before you know now you've got your formal uh people in in the message and around that that don't believe in all that that just think that's all too much excitement you're putting on a show you're working up people you're you're doing all kinds of nonsense and as I've told you before brother Branham lean more healing more to the active side of things he says I'd rather have too much Wildfire than no fire at all he leaned more to inspirational preaching than intellectual ain't that right that's right see because he understood the way that the Holy Spirit moved he understood the nature anything alive is going to kick he says ain't that right so then if a man's experience doesn't match with the Bible and the the message of the hour which they all dovetailed together but if that experience does not match then don't receive it you don't take it can you say man but to say that things have to be done in certain in order would be a false statement for again in the Bible people received the Holy Ghost by hands being laid upon them others by preaching the gospel see others by whatever see some spoken new tongues after receiving the Holy Ghost others didn't ain't that right now as I get ready to close brother Branham said the principle to Revival is being flexible everybody say flexible flexible the key to Revival is flexible being flexible he said that is the principle of a Revival a people who are flexible not gullible but flexible right not ones that accepts anything but ones that can look sincerely in the word and if it's there we believe it there you go ain't that right yes sir so he says that's the principle of Revival a people who are flexible not to an intellectual talk but to the coming of the holy spirit in the form of the baptism so don't be flexible to an intellectual talk he's saying be flexible to the coming of the holy spirit in the form of a baptism that gives way to the word of God and rejoicing and is flexible in the anointing of the spirit ain't that right brother Brown tells her the time that he was out in the woods I think in Canada and and it was I think it got dark on him and so that he was uh he had entered into a place of woods that had been burned years ago and and as he's there a wind blew through Wind come I don't think that was accidental but the wind come through and he said you heard the office noise you know and he said it was the awfullest eeriest sound that it was given and so he he said they he said now them old trees were groaning making the Sound by that wind under that wind the wind blew [Music] and he said the reason why is because they were dead stiff and starchy dead Stefan starchy so that when so brother Brown tells him you know he kind of gives the illustration of what they were saying oh dear Miracles have passed oh can't have that in our church no no no no win coming down gonna blow oh holy ghost no no no don't speak oh no no no no don't dance oh no no shouting all that crying though you working up something oh this dog dead and formal stiff is that right he said the wind blowing there made them moan and groan he said they had no life to bend with the Wind right he said they had no bark to make them flexible and the sound was really spooky he says just like the organizations of today they can't bend to the spirit because they're so organized it would break up their organization they make spooky sounds they get behind the pool but make spooky sounds they're coming to church sitting in a Pew and they make spooky sounds ain't that right all right I remember where was it we we went to uh it was uh we we had met some uh ex-amish and I don't know how how new they were out out of the Amish but uh Seth had met him in at college so they invited him to come to church to their meeting and so I said yeah we'll go you know so the whole family went so we sit in the back you know and so the minister he was he was preaching and and you know it was dead quiet dead quiet and but he he talking about something that I agreed on so I said amen it was the funniest thing everybody turned around and I I could just picture this one [Music] and all of all of them turned around to look at me to say who who did that so that reminded me of that today I'm not not making fun of it it's just I'd never been in the place like that before but they did they cranked their necks so they say you know Divine Healing wasn't in the atonement and all that their nonsense of shouting going on just what Joel said brother Brown said you're taking the Joy from the sons of God amen restored that Joy God said he would do it another place he said the fires of persecution have burned them and the members has come in got ritualistic form and ungodliness and burnt the bark off of them and they're nothing but a bed dead bunch of Representatives only to groan and moan and make a lot of fussing about something God's doing he says another place I thought Lord what do you send the wind for if they're going to moan in hell and go on like that he's out there and hearing all that bunch of moaning why why are you sitting in the wind for for these for these trees for them people if you send an old-fashioned Pentecostal wind that like that fell on the day of Pentecost what in the world you doing that gonna send that forth they're just going to moan and refuse it and reject it he says then I noticed I noticed well all that moaning and groaning what's going on is I happen to look and there was undergrowth undergrowth little little saplings growing and they were just frolicking in the land just to blow it with the Wind and he says he I noticed he said they had life in them and then when that wind began to hit them they was twisting and ringing and shouting and having a glorious time so one is mono oh don't do that don't do that not Young Generation it's an undergrowth that's just having a ball they're enjoying everything that God has for them can you say Amen that's right see so here brother Brown said when that wind hit them they wasn't moaning and groaning they was just flexible and jumping and rejoicing and shouting and having a holy ghost meeting he said why they were flexible they had life they was moving with the wind just rejoicing they wasn't moaning about it they were rejoicing frolicking jumping having an old-time Revival brother Brown says another place let me tell you brother God's going to raise up a generation of people out of all this dead stuff that's going to restore saith the Lord God's going to raise up people who believes in signs and wonders going to raise up people who's got joy unspeakable and full of glory and when the rushing wind comes it gives right into it and frolics and dances and glorifies God hallelujah green leaves are clapping their hands and having a wonderful time well what a Frolic that little ungrowth was having but that big old tree's standing there just a moaning and growing and it was the same wind the same wind that was causing one to moaning wrong was calling to the other one to have an old-fashioned Holy Ghost Revival and they were frolicking shouting glorifying God they were bending them you just come in surprise so it was mainly just the locals that were there and he says a lot of times he said brother Brown was a totally different man than he was with all the people there he said man he'd get out there and dance and shout and just have a ball he said you know he says just because he was at home with with the home folk you understand what I'm saying so he says see so brother Brown said I became a Holy Roller Hallelujah that when the wind goes to blowing I can give in to it and say Yes Lord I believe you're the same yesterday or saying Jesus Christ that rose from the dead you live yet today and the spirit of God just sweeps it from one side to the other you think we're crazy but we're not we just got life and we're flexible that's the difference see there's a people that's got life and got flexibility ain't that right sure we know that there's all kinds of impersonators and all that but if you're going to dwell on that you're gonna get yeah you ain't gonna see the real you ain't gonna see the genuine that's there I'd rather see the genuine I'd rather look for something that's real if there's a thousand impersonators there's got to at least be one that's real I'd rather look for that one ain't that right so he says go ahead and mourn if you want to but God's moving his that undergrowth coming right on up and she's going right on in the seed can you say amen he said another place I'm glad uh he said I'm glad I'm that backwashed they call that hallelujah oh my soul can stay clear with God when the Holy Ghost comes down I won't moan and groan and take sides against it I'll agree with it and frolick with it and live with it and speak with it and sing with it and Shout with it and die with it Hallelujah Mighty rushing wind come from heaven like a wind see filled all the house where they were setting all the fundamentals began to groan but he had something coming up I will restore saith the Lord see here comes some more pine trees coming up they was ready to catch right into the wind and just frolicking having a good time I said if that Don't Put Me In Mind of a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting my goodness I think it's interesting how he describes a good old fashion Holy Ghost meeting you never find him describing a formal Church where people just sitting there like a nylon log and him calling out a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting but you do find it when he talks about Miriam beating the tambourine and they're dancing and Moses is singing in the spirit he said now that's Pentecostal right there that's a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting ain't that right and when he he didn't call them trees moaning and groaning under the wind a whole old-fashioned Holy Ghost meme it was them little ones that was having a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting when they were just frolicking in the wind dancing giving way to it can you say amen and I don't know about you but we are that generation that he was talking about we are that undergrow amen they can despise it they can reject it they can do whatever they want to they can call us all kinds of names that let us Frolic in the Wind of the spirit when the spirit God comes down it may be in a PR with us just as one or a group of us or in a meeting it don't matter when he comes I want to frolic with it I want to enjoy it I want to move with the speak with it live with it die with it can you say Amen oh yes we are that undergrowth if the musicians will come brother Andrew Cena the following quote yesterday on a Minister's chat and I thought it went long he said there is brother Brown said there is some kind of emotion within a born-again Christian when it pulsates there's something has to happen that's all there is to it can you say Amen you see things blow up when people get too rigid and we miss the things of God can you say Amen amen but if it's in the word I'll take it if it's there it's there ain't that right and we know that that first church had unknown tongues sure did and we have unknown tongues or I believe in them anyways but Paul would put the order into it as brother Branham put order to it and if we follow that order to it then we know it's of God can you say man you love him I love him I love him let's just sing that song I love him oh I love him [Music] I love you because [Music] he first loved me and

when he would come Among Us and move church just to encourage you just to keep pressing the battle lay aside every way that would so easily be beset you I don't care what that is I've just been asking the Lord for me just Lord help me to lay aside every way whether it's materialistic whether it's just in my heart things I'm holding on to I need to let go whatever it would be I just ask the Lord to show me and give me the grace too Let It Go and I tell you what there's nothing nothing worth holding on to in this world we can't take it with this church the one thing about it it'll all be over when we hear him say Well done thou good and faithful servant may God bless you richly I just I appreciate your stand for the gospel appreciate your stand your love for the Lord I don't take any of you lightly or for granted appreciate the experience that God has given you and how you stood you standing keep on standing these young people need to see it they need to see lives that are established in the gospel and I'm so glad that they've got men and women to look to so may God bless each Warrior here amen remember service 4 30 this evening may God keep you let's just bow our heads in prayer now father we thank you for the spirit we feel we just can't express enough how much we love you Lord knowing how much you love us may we become more anchored in that love Lord not anchored
