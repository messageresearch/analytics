[26:24] uh 20-year-old man associated with a
[26:27] student at brother Branson school was in
[26:29] a car wreck. uh his legs are broken,
[26:32] face and several other bones and also
[26:35] sister Zion Hoffman was diagnosed with
[26:38] Addison's disease and is in the
[26:41] hospital. And a brother from brother
[26:44] Diego's church
[26:47] u he he has fallen and is in the
[26:49] hospital. So we want to remember him
[26:53] along with grandpa. He is running a
[26:55] fever and is in need of prayer. And if
[26:59] we Uh we want to remember our pastor as
[27:01] he brings forth the word. Amen. Brother
[27:04] Amos, would you want to bring uh these
[27:07] needs before the Lord? And also uh
[27:11] there's a prayer request
[27:15] [Music]
[27:20] here. If any of us are looking for a
[27:22] perfect healthy life in this body, guess
[27:25] again. I think you've been here long
[27:27] enough to realize you're going to have
[27:29] trouble. I don't care how strong, how
[27:32] healthy you are. Brother Brandham looked
[27:34] at people said, "You look like a fine,
[27:36] healthy man to me, but had an affliction
[27:39] in there in his body." Let's look to the
[27:42] Lord in prayer. And God doesn't get
[27:43] tired of all these needs. You know, he's
[27:48] always standing by. He's not weary of
[27:52] us. Not tired of hearing us. Even though
[27:55] you prayed many times for the same thing
[27:57] over and over, he doesn't get tired of
[27:59] it. And there's a time appointed. Let's
[28:02] look to the Lord in prayer. Join my join
[28:04] join me in prayer if you would tonight,
[28:06] please. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we
[28:08] join together in prayer for these
[28:11] requests, Lord, we think of this one
[28:12] that's been in this traumatic accident,
[28:15] Lord. and the Lord legs broken, God
[28:19] knowing Lord sometime we just got to
[28:21] realize dear Lord what other people's
[28:24] going through and sometimes we have
[28:26] things happen to us that make us realize
[28:29] and knowing that pain is real it's awful
[28:32] Lord the trauma and the drama that goes
[28:35] along with it dear God Lord Jesus these
[28:37] other requests of people that's sick oh
[28:40] God Lord running a fever and our brother
[28:43] farmer Lord God and having that going on
[28:46] in his body. Been sick. I think of
[28:48] brother Boen as well. Dear God, he's
[28:51] been sick, too. They don't know what's
[28:53] going on with him. And dear God, I just
[28:56] pray that you'd help him. Lord, all
[28:58] these requests that was mentioned, dear
[29:00] God, there's many. We think of that
[29:01] other brother, Lord, was out there
[29:03] trying to earn a living for his family.
[29:05] Lord God, fell off of that deck and took
[29:08] a severe head injury, dear God. And
[29:11] Lord, laying there in the hospital right
[29:13] now, stable condition, but dear God, he
[29:16] needs you to move, Father God, for him.
[29:18] He's a believer. And we pray, God, that
[29:20] you move and touch these requests, Lord.
[29:23] Others that are out sick, I think, Lord,
[29:25] that may be uh Lord, that's not with us
[29:28] tonight. We ask it, oh God, that you'll
[29:30] just touch them, Lord. Lord, you never
[29:32] got tired of us, Lord. And we know,
[29:35] Father God, the enemy is relentless, oh
[29:37] God. He's got his punch coming, but
[29:39] we've also got a punch. We've got the
[29:42] punch line. I am the Lord that health
[29:44] all thy diseases. We can fire it right
[29:46] back. Dear God, though, though the
[29:49] attacks of the enemy may be many at
[29:51] times, dear God, so are your blessings.
[29:54] So are your promises, oh God, available
[29:57] 24/7. You're open six, seven days a
[30:00] week. You don't close. The shops never
[30:02] closed up. We come to you in the name of
[30:05] Jesus any time of the day or night. Dear
[30:08] God, under any circumstance, you're
[30:10] always there. We thank you for it, dear
[30:12] God. You're ever mindful these requests.
[30:15] Oh God, we know that you're hearing you.
[30:17] Lord, we believe that as we pray
[30:19] tonight, a shovel full of dirt just
[30:21] moved. Dear God, healing is on the way.
[30:24] Deliverance is on the way. Sound minds
[30:26] on the way, dear God. Because we pray
[30:29] and we believe, Father God, we hear from
[30:31] heaven. We believe and we believe for
[30:33] testimonies will come forth in Jesus
[30:36] name. Amen.
[30:41] And like a
[30:43] flood, his mercy
[30:47] raise. Unending
[30:50] love. Amazing grace. Let's sing that
[30:54] chorus again as brother Matthew comes.
[30:56] My chains are
[30:58] gone. I've been set free.
[31:02] My God, my
[31:05] Savior has ransomed
[31:08] me. And like a
[31:12] flood, his mercy
[31:15] reigns. Unending
[31:19] love, amazing grace. You can have your
[31:23] seats.

[31:44] short. I got nothing new.

[41:07] whole. Well, is that your prayer this
[41:10] evening? God, just lift our fill our
[41:15] cups full. Amen. We're just uh
[41:20] overflowing. Amen. And trust you had a
[41:22] good day today. And uh certainly good to
[41:26] see the sun shining. Amen. We needed the
[41:29] rain. And uh whatever God gives us,
[41:32] we'll take. Amen. He knows best. And so
[41:36] um but uh we love the Lord. And um if
[41:40] you have your Bibles, we're going to
[41:42] turn to the book of
[41:47] Revelations, the 22nd
[41:50] chapter. Amen. Revelations
[41:55] 22 and um the 17th
[41:59] verse we will read and um but before we
[42:03] go into the word we want to just maybe
[42:06] pray and brother Shamaya text me in the
[42:10] office asking we'd just continue to pray
[42:12] for the family and um uh still feeling
[42:18] uh pretty sick or or uh weak uh from the
[42:22] sickness and uh so we want to keep
[42:26] um all of them in our prayer and um
[42:30] brother Jerry is doing better uh feeling
[42:34] a lot better but um sister Bethany and
[42:37] Shou are getting better and uh uh but uh
[42:42] sister J Tony is feeling pretty weak and
[42:45] brother Shamaya pretty weak so uh we'll
[42:49] just go and and pray for them as well.
[42:52] And uh if you have a need on your heart,
[42:56] Amen. Just bring it before the Lord.
[43:01] Father, Lord, we we are believers in
[43:05] you,
[43:06] Father. Not because we've just been
[43:08] taught it, but we have seen you. We've
[43:11] seen you work the supernatural many
[43:13] times before.
[43:16] We've seen you change the situations
[43:19] around where people were doctors had
[43:22] given up on them and they were sentenced
[43:27] to die and yet they're living today
[43:30] because you
[43:32] intervened. And father, we're just
[43:34] asking that you'd have mercy on brother
[43:37] Shamaya and his family, in-laws. Father,
[43:41] that you would heal them, bring strength
[43:44] into their bodies,
[43:46] Father. Oh God, just take away every
[43:49] symptom of sickness away from them. I
[43:53] pray, Father, that you would be with us
[43:55] this evening as we would uh endeavor to
[43:58] speak your word tonight. and may you
[44:01] would give us the words to speak,
[44:03] Father. Lord, we certainly need your
[44:07] help tonight, Father. And if you would
[44:10] just come among us, we'd be uh forever
[44:13] grateful and just do an eternal work
[44:16] within us, Father, we ask it in Jesus
[44:19] Christ's name. Amen. And amen.
[44:24] Uh the revelations the 22nd chapter 17th
[44:28] verse it says and the spirit and the
[44:30] bride say
[44:32] come let him that heareth say come let
[44:36] him that is a thirst come and whosoever
[44:40] will let him
[44:43] uh whosoever will let him take the water
[44:47] of life freely.
[44:49] Then 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter, if
[44:53] you'd like to turn with me there
[44:57] um and just read the
[45:00] uh 13th
[45:04] verse. We have having the same spirit of
[45:08] faith according as it is written, I
[45:10] believed and therefore have I
[45:13] spoken. We also believe and therefore
[45:17] speak. Amen. You can have your seats
[45:21] this
[45:22] evening. And if I would to have a title,
[45:25] it would be the bride just simply
[45:27] believes. The bride simply
[45:32] believes.
[45:34] We hear so much of
[45:37] faith and uh and that's because it is
[45:40] essential to the the life of a believer.
[45:45] You can never underestimate faith and
[45:48] you'll never outgrow
[45:51] uh faith to where you don't need it.
[45:53] It's actually becoming more prominent.
[45:56] Uh faith is and um the moment that you
[46:01] leave away from faith, that's when Satan
[46:04] has you. Amen. Um the moment you leave
[46:07] away from faith and we know that what
[46:11] you believe according to the scriptures
[46:14] what you believe you will speak and um
[46:19] your faith will dictate your words.
[46:22] It'll dictate your
[46:23] actions. You will speak of what you
[46:26] believe and you will act accordingly.
[46:30] This is why brother Brown said, "You
[46:32] believe you're saved, then you say
[46:34] you're saved, then you act like you're
[46:37] saved. Then you associate with those
[46:39] that are saved." Amen. And it works
[46:42] righteousness.
[46:43] He said, "What if you come to the altar
[46:45] and say, "Well, I don't know." But in
[46:47] your heart, you believe you're saved and
[46:50] then don't say nothing about it. He
[46:52] said, "You'll never be saved until you
[46:54] believe it, accept it, and confess it.
[46:59] So then we uh look that that faith is
[47:03] important but also speaking what we
[47:06] believe is is important and uh because
[47:12] from the abundance of the heart the
[47:13] mouth speaketh
[47:15] and so according to the the scripture
[47:18] there uh our opening scripture the bride
[47:21] is going to speak. She's she's going to
[47:25] have a u well the prophet said she'll be
[47:28] the final voice to the final age. So she
[47:30] is going to speak and if you notice what
[47:34] she will be speaking of of course uh the
[47:38] the we we read the spirit and the bride
[47:41] say come. But the prophet said listen to
[47:44] the authenticated prophet of God who
[47:47] appears in this last stage. Now we
[47:50] believe he has appeared. This
[47:52] authenticated prophet of God has come.
[47:56] What he says from God, the bride will
[47:58] say. Ain't that right? So then we know
[48:01] she won't be saying a a lot of nonsense
[48:03] or radical rhetoric or whatever. But
[48:07] what he says, she will say, and the
[48:11] spirit and the prophet and the bride
[48:13] will be saying the same thing. So now
[48:17] the the prophet tells us uh uh years ago
[48:20] that the word is in the bride. How many
[48:24] believes that? So the word the word uh
[48:28] uh that uh if we could say it the
[48:30] vindicated word the word that the
[48:32] prophet brought is is in the bride.
[48:36] How did it get into her? Amen. Is
[48:39] because she is in harmony with Christ as
[48:43] he was with the father. Ain't that
[48:46] right? She is in harmony with Christ.
[48:50] Amen. In agreement with Christ, working
[48:52] with Christ. Amen. Coming under his
[48:56] headship. And uh as he was in harmony
[48:59] with the father, the prophet says he
[49:01] shows her his word of life.
[49:05] How? Through the vindicated prophet.
[49:08] Amen. Shows her his word of life. He
[49:11] shows her. She receives it. She never
[49:16] doubts it. Can you say amen? She never
[49:20] doubts it. Amen. So, so this is why that
[49:24] she can say exactly what a prophet says
[49:27] is because she has received it as thus
[49:30] sayeth the Lord and she never doubts it.
[49:34] Can you say amen? Now, this faith of
[49:38] course has a foundation. The faith that
[49:40] the bride has has a foundation. And uh
[49:44] brother Brandham has told us that faith
[49:46] has to have a basis. You just can't let
[49:49] faith be loose and wild. Uh your your
[49:52] feelings can get loose and wild. Your
[49:54] emotions can get loose and wild. But you
[49:57] cannot let faith get loose and wild.
[50:00] Faith has to rest itself not upon
[50:03] shifting sands of man's reasonings.
[50:06] Ain't that right? So then what does
[50:08] faith rest upon? It rests upon the word
[50:11] of God. That's what faith rests upon. It
[50:14] rests upon the word of God. And the
[50:17] Jesus said that man shall not live by
[50:20] bread alone but by every word that
[50:24] proceeds from the mouth of God. Ain't
[50:27] that right? Now we know that the mouth
[50:29] of God in uh uh the prophets are God's
[50:33] mouthpiece. They have spoken for the
[50:35] Lord. They have said, "Thus said the
[50:36] Lord," the word of God would come out of
[50:38] their mouth. And brother Brandham even
[50:41] said, you know, he says, "I am, you
[50:43] know, when when the angel of the Lord
[50:45] comes, I am God's voice to you." He
[50:48] said, "I may have offended you by saying
[50:50] that, but then he turns around and says,
[50:51] but I am God's voice to you." And he
[50:54] said, "I may have offended you by saying
[50:56] that, but it repeated it." Amen. So, it
[50:59] was letting us know, God letting us know
[51:01] that the prophet of this age is God's
[51:05] voice to you and I. Now, that's
[51:08] important to us because God gave his
[51:10] word in the beginning uh to Adam and
[51:13] Eve. And and as long as they believe
[51:16] that word, they didn't have to explain
[51:18] the word. They didn't have to go around
[51:20] reasoning the word. They just simply
[51:22] believed the word. And the prophet said
[51:25] nothing could harm them as long as they
[51:28] believe that word. We we know there was
[51:31] potential for sin. There was potential
[51:33] for death. There was potential sickness.
[51:36] There was potential for all the evil
[51:38] things that we have now. But it could
[51:41] not come upon them. It could not be
[51:44] exercised. It could not come into power
[51:47] until man doubted the word of God. Amen.
[51:51] So as soon as Eve doubted the word, then
[51:55] all creation fell. Ain't that right? But
[51:58] if you notice, she sinned. The prophet
[52:00] said, when she received the devil's lie
[52:03] in the womb of her mind, she listened to
[52:06] him. She she began to take note of what
[52:10] he was trying to tell her and and she
[52:13] began to listen and she received the
[52:16] devil's lie in the womb of her mind. And
[52:19] then the actual act came later on. See?
[52:23] And so we we find that God has always
[52:28] given his word just as he did to Adam
[52:30] and Eve. He has given his word through
[52:33] every age. How many believes that? Yeah.
[52:36] Throughout every age. And so now notice,
[52:39] brother Brandham said, if you are true
[52:41] seed, you will hear that word. Ain't
[52:45] that right? That's that's how the the
[52:47] bride is going to say the satan same
[52:50] thing. Amen. That's how she comes into
[52:52] harmony and speaking the same thing. Her
[52:55] the spirit and the prophet the bride the
[52:58] spirit and the prophet saying the same
[53:00] thing is she comes into harmony with
[53:03] God. Amen. And and he says if you are
[53:06] true seed you will hear that word. The
[53:09] spirit will baptize you into the body of
[53:12] Christ, filling you and empowering you
[53:16] and you will receive the word for your
[53:19] day and age. Can you say amen? So, so we
[53:23] see how powerful that is that before she
[53:26] could speak it, she had to hear that
[53:28] word and then she had to receive that
[53:31] word and come in harmony with the word
[53:34] for her day. Ain't that right? Now this
[53:37] faith as and and this is something we
[53:39] all know. So this is just uh uh
[53:42] reminding if we could say it that way.
[53:45] But uh you know and and I've come uh
[53:47] listening, you know, u um
[53:51] uh something popped up on my YouTube the
[53:54] other day of a man that left the message
[53:56] and and uh so I thought, well, I'm going
[53:58] to see what he says about that new pope
[54:00] and things like that and uh uh a lot of
[54:03] trash that he was saying. And I just
[54:05] turned it off and and I thought, you
[54:07] know, uh uh he's mocking Brother
[54:09] Brandham and mocking the message people
[54:12] and and um you know, and and anyways, I
[54:16] thought I enough of that junk. But but
[54:19] you know, this bride has that there's a
[54:23] faith that this bride has. She's not
[54:26] forced into this.
[54:29] She she is not um uh bribed into this.
[54:34] There's just something that that the
[54:36] bride has. And yes, she's ridiculed and
[54:39] yes, she's called fanatics and yes, she
[54:41] looks maybe looks stupid to the world
[54:43] and and and all that, you know, but but
[54:46] there's something I, you know, I got to
[54:48] just thinking about that. Well, what
[54:49] keeps me Amen. believe in this message?
[54:52] What why why don't I want to listen to
[54:54] that guy? Uh uh why why am I so firm
[54:58] with what brother Brandham taught? And
[55:01] and you know, a after I'd uh listened to
[55:04] that, I just turned on the tape and you
[55:06] just hear the brother Brandham talking
[55:08] and you know, you just I I just had to
[55:11] cry. I thought, "Oh, God." You know, I
[55:13] don't understand why anyone just can't
[55:15] listen to a prophet and just believe
[55:17] him. There there's just something about
[55:20] uh uh uh the prophet of the age and the
[55:23] word of God that he brought. But see,
[55:26] this bride, this the faith that this
[55:28] bride has is not an intellectual faith.
[55:32] You you'll never be able to reason this
[55:34] out and and even trying to explain it.
[55:37] You see, intellectual faith relies on
[55:40] human efforts, human intelligence, human
[55:44] achievements. Uh it relies on education,
[55:48] scientific study and achievements and
[55:50] and all that. And intellectually it may
[55:54] look right.
[55:55] Intellectually, it may look sound and
[55:58] all of these things and they may have a
[56:01] good argument, but here's what the Bible
[56:03] says. Let God's word be true and every
[56:07] man's word a lie.
[56:10] Can you say amen? Let God's word be true
[56:14] and every man's word be a lie. So see
[56:17] intellectual faith it it just comes from
[56:20] the mind and and of reasoning and well
[56:24] Satan works through that kind of faith.
[56:27] Uh uh uh uh brother Brandham identified
[56:30] intellectual faith to be Satan's wisdom.
[56:34] We hear you know a lot of wisdom and and
[56:37] the Bible says that the children of this
[56:39] world are wiser than the children of
[56:42] light and and these things. Well, it
[56:45] they get that wisdom from Satan. It's a
[56:48] it's Satan's wisdom. And you can go
[56:50] listen to the message. I encourage you
[56:52] to do it. Uh uh uh wisdom versus faith.
[56:55] And uh but but Satan preached to Eve in
[56:59] the garden and even quoted to her what
[57:03] God said. I know, you know, a lot of
[57:05] people, well, it's just the Bible. Stay
[57:07] with the Bible. Bible. Bible. Bible.
[57:08] Bible. We've had this Bible for years
[57:12] and years and years and people still
[57:15] didn't know what all this said because
[57:17] it was a closed book. Ain't that right?
[57:20] But the word, the revelation had to come
[57:23] from a prophet. That's just the way it
[57:25] is. God, the Lord doeth nothing. Uh the
[57:28] Amos said the Lord doeth nothing but
[57:30] what he first reveals to his prophets.
[57:33] Can you say amen? But see, uh, uh, Satan
[57:37] gave her the word. Amen. And it wasn't a
[57:40] prophet giving it to her. It, it was
[57:42] Satan that was repeating the word,
[57:45] quoting the word, but he did it in a way
[57:49] to get her to reason with what God said.
[57:53] If he would have just simply repeated
[57:55] what God told her, then Eve could have
[57:58] said amen to that and they would have
[58:00] stopped. But that's not what he wanted
[58:02] to do. He wanted to quote the word of
[58:05] God to get her to listen. But he did it
[58:08] with the intent to get her to reason
[58:10] with what God said. Reason with it.
[58:14] Ain't that right? See, no preacher
[58:16] should use the word of God or use quotes
[58:19] in a way to where the congregation
[58:21] starts to reason with God's word. Either
[58:25] this word is right or it's wrong. Either
[58:28] this message is right or it's wrong. Can
[58:31] you say amen? I pray to God that every
[58:34] time you leave this this this these
[58:36] services uh the church or uh whatever
[58:39] that you will be so solidified that this
[58:42] message is right. I want you to know
[58:45] that I believe this message is right. I
[58:47] don't care what it says. I don't care if
[58:49] I understand it or not. This message is
[58:51] right. Amen. I don't want you to ever
[58:54] walk away out of this church with
[58:55] reasoning and saying, "Oh my, maybe the
[58:58] prophet did miss it here. Maybe the
[59:00] prophet did do this." No, no, no. Well,
[59:02] that's not the way we want it done.
[59:03] Ain't that right? See, so in Timothy 1
[59:06] Timothy 1:4, Paul tells us to not give
[59:10] heed to fables and endless
[59:13] genealologies which minister questions
[59:16] rather than godly edifying which is in
[59:20] faith. 1 Timothy 6 and3 if any man teach
[59:24] otherwise and consent not to wholesome
[59:27] words even the words of our Lord Jesus
[59:30] Christ and to the doctrine which is
[59:32] according to godliness he is proud and
[59:34] knowing nothing but doting about
[59:37] questions and strife of words whereof
[59:41] cometh envy strife railings evil
[59:44] surmisings ain't that right in in 2
[59:48] Timothy 2:23 Paul tells us to avoid
[59:51] foolish and unlearned questions, knowing
[59:54] that they do gender strife. Now, the
[59:58] prophet said, "Satan always puts a
[1:00:01] question mark," Amen, to the word of
[1:00:03] God. I remember meeting with a a man uh
[1:00:07] that was on his way out. Uh his church
[1:00:09] didn't know it. A lot of folks didn't
[1:00:11] know it, but but uh uh uh just a few of
[1:00:14] us caught caught where he was going. and
[1:00:17] and he was a little upset with me and
[1:00:19] and uh cuz I preached a sermon right
[1:00:22] after him and he was belittling brother
[1:00:24] Brandham and saying you didn't need the
[1:00:26] the the uh the message to to get in the
[1:00:29] rapture and the third pull ain't nothing
[1:00:32] and it's been going on anyway. He was
[1:00:34] just before 300 people in Oklahoma. He
[1:00:38] was just spewing it all out and then I
[1:00:40] had to preach behind him and and so, you
[1:00:43] know, I just preached that the message
[1:00:44] is right and we're just dumb enough to
[1:00:46] believe it. And well, he was upset with
[1:00:49] me and he was calling all these
[1:00:50] preachers around and and so I thought,
[1:00:53] well, I I need to go visit with him. And
[1:00:55] so, we had a 4-hour talk and uh he done
[1:00:58] most of the talking. Uh but but all of
[1:01:01] his words was trying to get me to to
[1:01:04] turn, you know, he I could tell you
[1:01:06] everything about this message that's
[1:01:08] wrong and and I can tell you what
[1:01:10] happened, you know, years ago and it
[1:01:13] make you turn from this message. I
[1:01:14] looked at him, I said, you can tell me
[1:01:16] anything you want. It ain't going to
[1:01:18] take me from this message. This message
[1:01:21] is the truth. Finally, when he realized
[1:01:24] he couldn't convince me, just he got
[1:01:25] done with me and he was ready to go. But
[1:01:28] see, Satan always puts question marks a
[1:01:32] man across God's word. And he's very
[1:01:34] cunning in how he does it. He's very
[1:01:37] tricky. He's very sly. He's very uh uh
[1:01:41] But see, he convinced Eve that she
[1:01:45] needed something else outside of what
[1:01:47] God had already given her. The word that
[1:01:50] God had given her was enough, amen, to
[1:01:54] keep the enemy back. It was enough,
[1:01:56] amen, to keep all the powers of hell,
[1:02:00] amen, at bay, amen, if she would have
[1:02:02] just accepted and been content with what
[1:02:05] God had given her. Amen. But Satan was
[1:02:08] able to convince her that she needed
[1:02:10] more and there was there was actually
[1:02:13] better things outside of God's word.
[1:02:16] See, so Satan works through intellectual
[1:02:18] faith. His bride uh uh is an
[1:02:22] intellectual bride. Amen. His church is
[1:02:25] an intellectual church. The prophet said
[1:02:28] she is of the antichrist. She is
[1:02:30] religious, scientific, and educated.
[1:02:33] See? Uh but then he says God's little
[1:02:36] bride is humble and just simply believes
[1:02:39] the word of God. Amen. She's not looking
[1:02:42] for fantastic. She's not looking for
[1:02:46] better explanations. She's not looking
[1:02:48] for greater things. That's why she's not
[1:02:51] uh uh uh detourred when when someone
[1:02:54] rises to claiming to be another
[1:02:56] messenger. We we don't need eighth day
[1:02:58] messengers. We we we we're not looking
[1:03:01] for another message to come because God
[1:03:04] has already given us Exactly. Amen.
[1:03:08] Enough word here. Amen. To put us in a
[1:03:12] rapture, to put us in a body change.
[1:03:14] Amen. To to heal your sick, to to cast
[1:03:17] the devils out. Amen. to come into what
[1:03:21] God well to bring on a millennium. How
[1:03:24] many believes that we've got enough word
[1:03:27] here. Amen. That will put us in the
[1:03:30] millennium. Amen. I I believe that. But
[1:03:33] see, God's bride is humble and just
[1:03:36] simply believes the word of God. See,
[1:03:38] she is a word bride. Everybody say,
[1:03:40] "She's a word bride." Can you make that
[1:03:43] personal? I'm a word bride. See, I'm a
[1:03:45] word bride. And therefore, the word can
[1:03:48] only recognize the word. Ain't that
[1:03:51] right? See, it cannot the prophet said
[1:03:53] it cannot recognize a denomination or a
[1:03:56] perversion. It knows better. It's the
[1:03:59] word. Can you say amen? So, this bride
[1:04:02] knows better than to go hunting
[1:04:04] something new and listening to uh uh uh
[1:04:09] uh questions and and and things that
[1:04:12] would slight the word of God. See, so
[1:04:15] now the word uh uh brother Brandham said
[1:04:18] the word being manifest is the evidence
[1:04:22] that it's right. I want to ask you, have
[1:04:25] you seen the word of God manifest in
[1:04:27] this age? We we've seen the word of God
[1:04:30] made manifest. I I this there there's
[1:04:33] all kinds of things, amen, that we have
[1:04:36] looked uh that we of scriptures that we
[1:04:38] have has been waiting for this day uh in
[1:04:42] this age. Um uh I you know I I was
[1:04:46] listening to uh uh brother Biscoll an
[1:04:49] old tape and of uh 1987 and he made a
[1:04:53] statement that I just I wanted to jump
[1:04:56] up and down and shout but he said you
[1:04:58] know you hear in the scriptures where
[1:05:01] where uh Jesus said a greater than
[1:05:04] Solomon is here a greater than is here
[1:05:07] right and and but he said you never
[1:05:11] heard a greater than than you know uh
[1:05:15] Esther is here or a greater than uh uh
[1:05:19] Rebecca is here or Rahab the harlot.
[1:05:22] Amen. Because it wasn't that time but
[1:05:25] here in this day we can truly say amen
[1:05:30] that there is a greater because there is
[1:05:33] the bride. See they were just a type of
[1:05:36] the bride of Jesus Christ. Do you
[1:05:38] believe that? So, we're seeing that that
[1:05:40] there is scriptures being fulfilled.
[1:05:43] Amen. We're living out what Rahab the
[1:05:45] harlot typed out. We're we're living out
[1:05:48] what Rebecca and Isaac typed out. We're
[1:05:51] living out what Ruth typed out. We're
[1:05:54] living out all of these things. Amen.
[1:05:57] The word being made manifest is evident
[1:06:01] that it's right. Amen. We have seen
[1:06:03] Malachi 4 fulfilled, Revelations 10:7
[1:06:06] fulfilled, Revelation 10:1 fulfilled,
[1:06:09] and on and on and on, scripture after
[1:06:13] scripture. Ain't that right? See, so
[1:06:16] brother Brandham says, "If a woman goes
[1:06:18] out here and is married to a man and she
[1:06:21] goes out and makes love with another man
[1:06:22] and has affairs with him and come back
[1:06:25] to her husband, he should kick her out."
[1:06:28] He said, "Is that right? She must be
[1:06:30] true to him because she's vowed to him.
[1:06:33] And the bride of Christ is vowed to
[1:06:36] Christ and he is the word. Now, how many
[1:06:40] believe we've had an invisible union?
[1:06:42] Amen. Brother Brandon preached that the
[1:06:44] invisible union of the bride of of
[1:06:46] Christ and and and and that was a true
[1:06:50] union. Amen. In this day, that the bride
[1:06:54] and Christ are becoming one. They they
[1:06:57] the marriage is now. We've been married
[1:07:01] to the word of God. Christ our the
[1:07:04] living word. Amen. Which is Christ.
[1:07:06] That's why when they say, "Well, we need
[1:07:08] to get to Christ before we get to the
[1:07:09] message." They ain't even understand it.
[1:07:11] He is the word. And when we simply
[1:07:14] believe the word, Amen. With all that's
[1:07:17] within us for this day, we are become
[1:07:20] married to him. Married to the word.
[1:07:22] Ain't that right? Amen. So, it's more
[1:07:24] than just church membership and and and
[1:07:27] religion. We are literally taking on the
[1:07:30] bride of Christ and bearing his name,
[1:07:33] Miss Jesus Christ. Amen. See, so we we
[1:07:37] made a vow to Christ, not vow to a
[1:07:40] prophet. Oh my. You know, they they say
[1:07:44] we worshiping a prophet, worshiping a
[1:07:46] man, giving glory to William Brandham.
[1:07:49] That's nonsense. Amen. He was just a
[1:07:52] messenger. Amen. that that that
[1:07:54] connected us amen to Christ the word.
[1:07:57] Can you say amen? See, and so uh uh
[1:08:00] brother Brown said, "See her long hair,
[1:08:02] Nazerite vow shows that she is vowed to
[1:08:06] God. Her beautiful gown of his promised
[1:08:09] word for the age that she is living in
[1:08:12] wrapped around her, vindicating her with
[1:08:15] himself." see of Hebrews 13:8. Jesus
[1:08:19] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:08:21] forever. As she is part of the word
[1:08:24] groom, true to him in every point. Can
[1:08:29] you say amen? True to him in every
[1:08:33] point. He's vindicating her with
[1:08:36] himself.
[1:08:38] Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. and see. Brother
[1:08:42] Brham said, "A married woman shouldn't
[1:08:44] even wink at another man." Amen. She
[1:08:49] should make no signs, no emotions at all
[1:08:51] towards him, for she is absolutely a
[1:08:54] bride to one bridegroom.
[1:08:57] Can you say amen? See, she's absolutely
[1:09:01] a bride to one bridegroom. See, now
[1:09:04] remember, there was a tree of knowledge
[1:09:06] in the beginning of good and evil. It
[1:09:08] was a mixed tree. Amen. And and and God
[1:09:12] told Adam in in Genesis 21:17, "In the
[1:09:16] day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt
[1:09:19] surely die." Ain't that right? Well,
[1:09:23] Brother Brham said, "Denominations,
[1:09:25] they're part of that mixed tree." Amen.
[1:09:28] Tree of knowledge. Ain't that right? But
[1:09:31] here Jesus says in the New Testament
[1:09:33] there that that my sheep know my voice.
[1:09:38] My sheep know my voice. That's who we're
[1:09:41] married to is is the word of God. Ain't
[1:09:44] that right? You you can't get in union
[1:09:46] if you don't know his voice. But my
[1:09:49] sheep know my voice. And a stranger they
[1:09:53] will not follow. So any man's voice is
[1:09:56] his word. And a
[1:09:58] denomination, that mixed tree, they're
[1:10:01] not going to follow. They're not going
[1:10:03] to partake of that mixed tree. They're
[1:10:04] not going to partake of the tree of
[1:10:07] knowledge. Can you say amen? So
[1:10:09] therefore, the prophet said they will
[1:10:11] not add or take away from the word of
[1:10:13] God. They're just simply believing. We
[1:10:16] ain't got time to add. We ain't got time
[1:10:18] to take away. We're not here to dissect
[1:10:21] what Brother Brandham said and what he
[1:10:23] didn't say and what he meant and what he
[1:10:24] didn't mean, what his opinion was and
[1:10:26] not his opinion and all these things.
[1:10:29] Ain't that right? See, we're not here to
[1:10:31] take away from the word or at. We're
[1:10:34] just content with him the one that we
[1:10:37] married. We married him the person the
[1:10:40] word.
[1:10:45] Amen. So now the faith that that we the
[1:10:49] faith that this bride has is God's own
[1:10:51] faith
[1:10:53] which comes by the Holy Ghost being in
[1:10:55] you. Brother Bram said the Holy Ghost
[1:10:57] believes God's word every time. Always.
[1:11:00] God's the Holy Ghost always believes
[1:11:04] God's word every time. Amen. No matter
[1:11:07] what situation, no matter what's going
[1:11:09] on, no matter how discouraged you get,
[1:11:11] how low you
[1:11:13] get, the word, the Holy Ghost in you
[1:11:16] believes the word of God always.
[1:11:20] Ain't that right? See, so it isn't going
[1:11:22] to believe one thing today and then
[1:11:24] believe something else tomorrow and then
[1:11:27] a month from now, you know, believe
[1:11:29] something different than than than that.
[1:11:32] No, no, there's no discontentment. See,
[1:11:34] the bride just simply stays with the
[1:11:37] word of God.
[1:11:39] Come on, church. That's that's exactly
[1:11:41] where we're at. We're content with the
[1:11:43] word of God. That's exactly right. See,
[1:11:47] why? Because we know there's no other
[1:11:48] age. If we was in Luther's age, then
[1:11:51] they would have needed to come up. If we
[1:11:53] was in Wesley's age, we would have
[1:11:55] needed to come up. If we were in the
[1:11:56] Pentecostal age, we would have needed to
[1:11:58] come up because they only had part of
[1:12:00] the word. They just had a little portion
[1:12:02] of the word. But the full word has been
[1:12:05] restored to us in this
[1:12:07] age. And anything that tries to get us
[1:12:10] out of that and beyond that is of the
[1:12:13] devil.
[1:12:14] That's right. It sure is. See, it just
[1:12:18] simply stays with God's word. Now,
[1:12:21] Brother Brandon said, "Wisdom will
[1:12:23] reason." Now, wisdom will reason, but
[1:12:26] faith don't have no reasoning. It does
[1:12:29] nothing. Everybody say it does nothing
[1:12:31] but hold to the word. It holds the
[1:12:34] promise. Now, what does reasoning? I I
[1:12:37] looked up that word reasoning. It means
[1:12:39] argument, logic. See, intellectual faith
[1:12:43] just argues. It reasons with the word of
[1:12:45] God. Oh, yeah. It's true. I believe
[1:12:47] that. But, and then the argument, it
[1:12:50] lays out its argument. See? Oh, yes. I I
[1:12:53] I I believe this and I believe that, but
[1:12:55] but I I just don't. Well, then it starts
[1:12:57] laying out that argument. See where well
[1:13:00] well well if if if you if you looked at
[1:13:02] all the argument Amen you might be
[1:13:05] praying for your loved ones to get
[1:13:06] saved. Well in in all reality amen it
[1:13:09] looks totally impossible for them to get
[1:13:11] saved. And if you let the devil start
[1:13:13] laying out an argument for you will
[1:13:16] actually start arguing against the very
[1:13:18] promise that God gave you. Well, you're
[1:13:20] not to argue against the promise. You're
[1:13:23] just simply to believe it. I don't care
[1:13:25] what it looks like. I don't care how
[1:13:26] it's going to happen. I don't care when
[1:13:29] it's going to happen. God's word says it
[1:13:31] and I just simply believe it. Just
[1:13:35] simply believe. That's right. See, so
[1:13:38] intellectual faith just argues. It It
[1:13:40] finds logic. It goes with logic. Well,
[1:13:44] the word of God doesn't go with logic.
[1:13:52] Intellectual faith. So Noah, Noah when
[1:13:55] he came, he came with an unscientific
[1:13:57] message. Well, God never sent him to
[1:14:01] prove to the people that it was going to
[1:14:03] rain.
[1:14:06] Not one time out of that 120 years did
[1:14:09] God require Noah to prove to them people
[1:14:13] that it was going to rain or that his
[1:14:16] message was right. He had no proof. He
[1:14:20] just simply believed the message.
[1:14:24] Can you say amen? See, and so it wasn't
[1:14:27] Noah's job to show by education that he
[1:14:29] was right about the ra the rain coming.
[1:14:32] He was just responsible to preach the
[1:14:34] message. And the people was only
[1:14:36] responsible to believe the message. It
[1:14:40] wasn't up to the people to provide
[1:14:41] proof.
[1:14:45] You just had to believe it.
[1:14:48] Can you say amen? For them to believe
[1:14:51] Noah's message now that that's the
[1:14:54] strange thing because Noah looked dumb.
[1:14:57] He looked stupid up there. Sers's
[1:14:59] raining. It's going to rain when there
[1:15:01] science the science and the educated
[1:15:03] geniuses of that age could prove to them
[1:15:06] people there was no rain up there. Never
[1:15:08] had been rain at all. And for them
[1:15:12] people to sit there and believe the
[1:15:14] message, it made them look odd too.
[1:15:18] And so is it the message, Amen, may be
[1:15:21] odd today. It made brother Brandham look
[1:15:24] odd. It it made the people reject
[1:15:26] brother Brandham and it will make us who
[1:15:29] believe this message look odd as well.
[1:15:32] Because brother Brandham didn't have
[1:15:33] proof on everything. Amen. Of what he
[1:15:36] said. Amen. He didn't need the proof.
[1:15:38] And we don't ask for proof
[1:15:42] and we're not required to provide the
[1:15:44] proof. Amen. God said it. We believe it.
[1:15:48] That settles it. God proved it. Amen.
[1:15:52] God proved his own message. Can you say
[1:15:54] amen?
[1:15:56] So none of them could scientifically
[1:15:58] prove that rain was coming. Not one of
[1:16:01] them could scientifically
[1:16:03] prove that the ark would float.
[1:16:06] Scientifically speaking, the ark
[1:16:08] couldn't float. It was the wrong type of
[1:16:10] wood. Using soft wood instead of hard
[1:16:14] wood, using different things instead of
[1:16:17] come on. But God said it to do it that
[1:16:19] way. Amen. And Noah would simply
[1:16:23] believed and with an unscientific
[1:16:26] message built an arc, unscientific arc,
[1:16:31] but it floated exactly the way God said
[1:16:33] it would. Ain't that right? See, and so
[1:16:38] they just had to believe. God never laid
[1:16:41] the responsibility on us to prove that
[1:16:43] this message is right. He just requires
[1:16:45] us to believe it.
[1:16:47] And and genuine faith will always admit
[1:16:50] that the word is right. Brother Brandham
[1:16:52] said, "Faith will never argue against
[1:16:54] the word. It'll stay with the word. The
[1:16:57] way the word said do it, that's the way
[1:16:59] faith will recognize it." Can you say
[1:17:02] amen? Now, all of us know if you're
[1:17:05] really going to follow the word and
[1:17:06] you're going to believe that word that
[1:17:08] there's things that the word, amen, will
[1:17:10] have you doing and and believing that
[1:17:13] the world is totally against that it's
[1:17:16] against science. It's against education.
[1:17:19] It's against the way other people would
[1:17:20] do it of this world. And yet, you've got
[1:17:23] to stand there and just believe the
[1:17:24] word. You can't add to it. You can't
[1:17:26] take away from it.
[1:17:28] Come on, church.
[1:17:30] When the doctor says there's no more
[1:17:32] hope for you and you're still smiling,
[1:17:34] praising the Lord, well, will what? What
[1:17:37] is that? Is because you never detour
[1:17:39] your faith from this word. God says, "I
[1:17:43] am healed by his stripes." Yes, sir.
[1:17:48] Ain't that right?
[1:17:51] Yes, sir. Brother Brham said, 'If you
[1:17:54] try to place the days of miracles in the
[1:17:55] past and there's no such a thing and
[1:17:57] explain it away, well, there's only one
[1:17:59] word for you, brother. You're an
[1:18:00] unbeliever.
[1:18:02] Now, I'm sure you've heard of the phrase
[1:18:04] blind
[1:18:05] faith. I looked up that word. Blind
[1:18:07] faith is often described as belief
[1:18:10] without true understanding. believing
[1:18:13] without true
[1:18:15] understanding or without true perception
[1:18:18] or discrimination. It can be
[1:18:20] characterized as an unquestioning belief
[1:18:23] in something even when it is
[1:18:25] unreasonable or
[1:18:28] wrong. So blind faith has no
[1:18:31] discernment, right? It ready accepts
[1:18:35] whatever is presented without any regard
[1:18:38] to what God's word says about it.
[1:18:42] It's the gullible people who have blind
[1:18:44] faith and they are easily misled and
[1:18:47] misguided. Gullible it means easily
[1:18:50] duped, deceived, naive.
[1:18:54] So according to the Bible, the majority
[1:18:56] of people on the earth, they're
[1:18:58] gullible. Sure. And they they have this
[1:19:01] blind
[1:19:03] faith. And and and so in Matthew 24:5
[1:19:07] and 13, but Jesus says, "Many shall come
[1:19:10] in my name, saying, I am Christ and
[1:19:13] shall deceive many."
[1:19:16] Many walking right after them because
[1:19:19] they said they're the Christ, not
[1:19:21] requiring anything, not regarding what
[1:19:24] the Bible would say, just walking right
[1:19:27] after it and deceived. Yeah. 13th verse,
[1:19:30] many prophets shall rise and shall
[1:19:32] deceive many. Ain't that right? We find
[1:19:35] that the angel of the Lord foretold of
[1:19:37] this day through the prophet Daniel and
[1:19:40] and and Daniel 12:4, it says, "But thou,
[1:19:44] oh Daniel, shut up the words and seal
[1:19:46] the book even to the time of end of the
[1:19:49] end. Many many shall run to and fro and
[1:19:53] knowledge shall be increased." Ain't
[1:19:55] that right? See, people are going to run
[1:19:57] from one place to another, unsettled,
[1:20:00] restless, dissatisfied, discontent,
[1:20:03] following after one thing and another
[1:20:05] thing and another thing and another
[1:20:07] thing and and and and not regarding at
[1:20:11] all whether it's the word of God or not.
[1:20:14] They just got a blind faith. The prophet
[1:20:17] Amos picks it up in Amos 8:12, saying,
[1:20:20] "And they shall wander from sea to sea,
[1:20:22] and from the north, even to the east,
[1:20:25] they shall run to and fro to seek the
[1:20:27] word of the Lord, and shall not find
[1:20:30] it." Can you say amen? So, so with the
[1:20:34] same thing that Daniel is saying, Amen.
[1:20:36] Many shall run to and fro. But Amos is
[1:20:40] now telling us why they're running to
[1:20:42] and fro. They're trying to seek the word
[1:20:44] of the Lord. Can you say amen? And shalt
[1:20:48] not find it. Ain't that right? One
[1:20:51] commentator said they shall run to and
[1:20:53] fro to find a prophet or any person
[1:20:56] authorized by God to show them the end
[1:20:59] of their calamities. See, they they're
[1:21:02] trying to find the answers, in other
[1:21:04] words, and they're looking for a prophet
[1:21:06] or looking for some spiritual person
[1:21:08] that is authorized by God to give them a
[1:21:11] word from God.
[1:21:14] Right? Can you say amen? But why are
[1:21:17] they running to and fro? Because they
[1:21:19] have not accepted thus sayeth the Lord
[1:21:22] that came from a vindicated prophet in
[1:21:24] this day. Amen. Now, Brother Brown says
[1:21:27] this day that we're living in, it's such
[1:21:30] a day of unsettled peace, unsettled rest
[1:21:33] everywhere. People are running to and
[1:21:35] fro seeking whatever they may seek. Most
[1:21:38] anybody can get a following these days.
[1:21:41] No matter what they teach or think,
[1:21:43] somebody will listen to them. It's a day
[1:21:46] that the prophet spoke of. Jesus said,
[1:21:50] "It's the blind leading the blind, and
[1:21:53] the end result is them both falling in
[1:21:55] the ditch." But see, Jesus doesn't want
[1:21:58] us to be gullible. Can you say amen?
[1:22:00] This this this this this faith that the
[1:22:03] the bride has is not a blind faith.
[1:22:06] Amen. Just accepting anything and
[1:22:09] everything.
[1:22:10] Amen. In Matthew 24:23, if any man shall
[1:22:14] say unto you, lo, here is Christ, or
[1:22:16] there, believe it not. For there shall
[1:22:19] rise false Christ and false prophets,
[1:22:21] and shall shall show great signs and
[1:22:23] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:22:25] possible, they shall deceive the very
[1:22:26] elect. Behold, I have told you before,
[1:22:29] wherefore, if they shall say to you,
[1:22:31] Behold, he is in the desert, go not
[1:22:32] forth. Behold, he is in the secret
[1:22:34] chambers, believe it not.
[1:22:38] Ain't that right? And the only way to
[1:22:40] not believe that is to have a spirit of
[1:22:43] discernment to discern between right and
[1:22:46] wrong.
[1:22:48] Praise the Lord. Hello. See, so so this
[1:22:52] bride is simply believing, but it's not
[1:22:54] a blind faith. She's not just gullible
[1:22:57] as the world wants us to want wants to
[1:22:59] make us as just gullible. They're just
[1:23:01] following anything. No, we're not. All
[1:23:04] right. Come on. That's right. Amen.
[1:23:06] Hebrews 5:14. But but but strong meat
[1:23:09] belong to them that are full age,
[1:23:11] matured,
[1:23:13] even those who by reason of use have
[1:23:16] their senses exercised to discern both
[1:23:18] good and evil. Ain't that right? Now, I
[1:23:21] ain't going to take much longer, but we
[1:23:23] know that there are two opposing
[1:23:24] spirits. The prophet taught us that
[1:23:25] there's two opposing spirits at work in
[1:23:28] the in the world today. Both are very
[1:23:31] religious. He takes us through the Bible
[1:23:32] from beginning of Genesis all the way
[1:23:34] through. Shows us that these two spirits
[1:23:37] are very religious and and in this age
[1:23:40] they're coming to a head if they've not
[1:23:43] already. He says these spirits are the
[1:23:46] same as when they started in Cain and
[1:23:48] Abel. One is worshiping by beauty, by
[1:23:52] knowledge, by education, by science and
[1:23:55] ethics. The other is worshiping by faith
[1:23:58] of the revelation of the word of God.
[1:24:00] Amen. So the real he says the revelation
[1:24:04] or faith that a real true Christian has
[1:24:07] in God's word makes no claims of
[1:24:10] knowledge.
[1:24:13] I thought that was powerful.
[1:24:16] The faith or revelation that a Christian
[1:24:19] has in God's word makes no claims on
[1:24:23] knowledge.
[1:24:25] No claims of knowledge. In other words,
[1:24:27] makes no claims of having a doctor's
[1:24:29] degree. or coming from a doctor of
[1:24:33] divinity makes no claims of education or
[1:24:36] or having a schooling. Brother Brandham
[1:24:38] said doesn't belong to any denomination,
[1:24:41] any party, any sect. It belongs to
[1:24:44] Christ. It's his wife, not a church, his
[1:24:49] wife. We are not a church. Right.
[1:24:55] We've come through the church ages and
[1:24:58] it's been church, church, church,
[1:25:00] church. But we are the bride of Jesus
[1:25:03] Christ that has been united in union
[1:25:07] with him. Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:25:11] Brother Brandham called this bride of
[1:25:12] Christ the little faith woman that lives
[1:25:15] by faith. Amen. She just simply lives by
[1:25:18] faith. Amen. Aren't you glad you can
[1:25:21] live by faith?
[1:25:25] Brother Bram said she believes the word
[1:25:27] of God, obedient, waiting in love for
[1:25:29] the promised of the age to be confirmed.
[1:25:32] She's watching for it. She is part of
[1:25:34] that word and she is watching for her
[1:25:36] life to manifest that word. The body is
[1:25:40] waiting for which is the word. Waiting
[1:25:42] for the life which is the spirit to
[1:25:45] confirm or make it alive. That's what
[1:25:48] she's waiting for. No other life will
[1:25:50] work in her. She can't come to life any
[1:25:53] other way. Yet she feels it out there.
[1:25:56] She knows it's going to happen. And then
[1:25:57] here it happens. And then she wakes up.
[1:26:00] God said, "Let there be." And she came
[1:26:02] forth like the first one come forth. Can
[1:26:04] you say amen?
[1:26:06] So we find that these two spirits both
[1:26:09] are going to have a bride. Satan's going
[1:26:12] to have a bride. He's got his bride here
[1:26:14] on earth.
[1:26:16] Christ has his bride on earth. They're
[1:26:18] called, they're coming in a oneness, a
[1:26:20] union. Satan's bride is a prostitute.
[1:26:24] Bible calls her a the mother of
[1:26:26] harlots. Why? She claims to be Christ of
[1:26:29] Christ. She claims that Christ is her
[1:26:32] husband. And yet she's belongs to a a
[1:26:35] denomination at the same time. And and
[1:26:37] this bride is made up of what the Bible
[1:26:40] would call children of disobedience.
[1:26:43] And and brother Brandham said, 'What is
[1:26:44] disobedience? Rebellion against the
[1:26:46] word. Ain't that right? So these are
[1:26:49] illegitimate children claiming to be
[1:26:51] part of the church but illegitimate.
[1:26:53] Amen. To the word of God. Claiming to be
[1:26:56] part of the bride, but illegitimate to
[1:26:57] the word of God. Ain't that right? See,
[1:27:01] the prophet said she is the devil's
[1:27:03] bride wrapped in his religious sinloving
[1:27:05] knowledge for this present evil age to
[1:27:08] deceive you. Oh, a click or a
[1:27:11] denomination of seducing spirits by
[1:27:13] scientific knowledge and a modern
[1:27:16] civilization. See, she's claiming this
[1:27:19] church, this Satan's bride, she's
[1:27:21] claiming that she is building a great
[1:27:23] world for us to live in. Now, Brother
[1:27:26] Brandham said, you know, talking about
[1:27:27] Florida, he said they're trying to bring
[1:27:29] on a millennium without repentance.
[1:27:33] Ain't that right? Trying to bring all
[1:27:36] this beauty in. trying to bring in a
[1:27:39] millennium without
[1:27:41] repentance. So see, she has built fine
[1:27:43] churches, colleges, schools, hospitals,
[1:27:46] libraries, and temporary help for man
[1:27:50] without God's word.
[1:27:53] That's what a prophet says. See, and the
[1:27:55] people has fallen for it.
[1:27:58] The people have just sworn to it,
[1:28:02] and all of it's been done out apart from
[1:28:06] God's word. Yeah. See, prophet said she
[1:28:10] has taken the people and educating them
[1:28:12] into a better so-called civilization
[1:28:15] by knowledge away from God and his word.
[1:28:18] She has thrown the people into a pit of
[1:28:21] death. Amen. Got them looking to
[1:28:24] medical. I got them looking to
[1:28:26] scientific things, politicians, got them
[1:28:29] looking to education. And God's word has
[1:28:32] been left alone. Amen. Now they're
[1:28:35] telling a better world, a better
[1:28:37] America. Oh, great things are coming.
[1:28:41] Apart from God's word,
[1:28:45] and she's gotten the be people to
[1:28:47] believe
[1:28:48] this. She has built colleges. She has
[1:28:51] built universities. She has built
[1:28:52] hospitals. She has built libraries. She
[1:28:55] has built all of these things for
[1:28:56] temporary help of man. just enough to
[1:29:00] deceive them to get off of that word.
[1:29:04] Yeah. Can you say amen? Amen. And by her
[1:29:09] scientific knowledge, she has been able
[1:29:11] to be produce all of this outside or
[1:29:14] apart from the word of God. So, brother
[1:29:17] Bram said, see, she's so preated with
[1:29:19] Satan's wisdom and knowledge. The church
[1:29:22] has become, see, they send their people
[1:29:25] away to school to learn how to say amen
[1:29:27] just right. They learned them how to say
[1:29:29] all of this and be very intellectual.
[1:29:31] What is it? It's pregnantation of the
[1:29:33] devil. What did Satan pregnant Eve with?
[1:29:36] To disbelieve the word for
[1:29:40] intellectuals. And it ruined the whole
[1:29:42] creation. That's exactly what she's done
[1:29:45] in the world in the world today, the
[1:29:47] church. She's pregnantated herself with
[1:29:50] Bible schools and colleges and things
[1:29:52] like that. reading, writing, arithmetic,
[1:29:54] and they know more know more about God
[1:29:56] than a hot and
[1:30:00] tot. They know all their creeds, their
[1:30:02] prayer books, and everything else, but
[1:30:04] know nothing about God.
[1:30:06] Can you say amen? See, so this is
[1:30:09] exactly what Satan's bride has done and
[1:30:11] is doing and is achieving
[1:30:15] to where the people no longer know
[1:30:18] anything about the supernatural part of
[1:30:20] God. Amen.
[1:30:23] Oh my.
[1:30:26] It's amazing that even 33 years after
[1:30:29] the day of Pentecost that James is
[1:30:31] writing the church and and warning them
[1:30:33] and compelling them to contend for the
[1:30:38] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:30:40] saints. Now we're living in an age where
[1:30:43] faith is slow.
[1:30:45] Brother Brown says the church has turned
[1:30:47] the people over to the doctors,
[1:30:49] especially
[1:30:50] psychiatrists. People can't believe in
[1:30:52] the supernatural anymore. They can't
[1:30:54] believe in miracles anymore. The
[1:30:56] doctor's word has more effect upon the
[1:30:58] people than God's word does. Politicians
[1:31:01] have more influence on the people than
[1:31:03] God's word does. The media reports have
[1:31:06] more influence over the people striking
[1:31:09] fear and all these things in the heart
[1:31:11] more than the than the than than the
[1:31:14] word of God has an effect upon them.
[1:31:16] Denominational creeds and dogmas and
[1:31:18] programs have more sway over the people
[1:31:20] than the word of God does today. Can you
[1:31:23] say amen? But this is why the the
[1:31:25] prophet of Malachi 4, his message is so
[1:31:30] important to us.
[1:31:33] Is because his message was to restore or
[1:31:37] turn us back to the faith.
[1:31:41] Can you say amen? Restore that faith
[1:31:45] unto us.
[1:31:47] Now, people say, "Oh, you've been
[1:31:49] brainwashed." No, we've been restored
[1:31:51] back to the faith. We just simply
[1:31:54] believe God's word regardless.
[1:31:57] Amen. Amen. Come on now. I know Satan
[1:32:00] tries to get us to try to explain
[1:32:03] things. How are you going to get healed?
[1:32:06] How you you've been in this situation
[1:32:08] forever. How are you going to find your
[1:32:10] deliverance? It ain't up to me to
[1:32:12] explain it. All I know is God's word is
[1:32:15] true and it's going to happen according
[1:32:18] to God's word. Amen. Yes. You
[1:32:22] understand?
[1:32:24] God never did ordain us to build
[1:32:26] hospitals and schools and libraries, all
[1:32:30] that. You know what he commanded the
[1:32:31] church to do? Preach the gospel. And the
[1:32:34] gospel is the power of God demonstrated
[1:32:37] by the Holy Spirit. See, so now notice
[1:32:40] what the prophet said. Satan keeps the
[1:32:43] people from seeing the true revelation
[1:32:45] and faith of God's word being revealed
[1:32:48] and vindicated today. I'll say that
[1:32:50] again. It's Satan that is keeping the
[1:32:54] people from seeing the true revelation
[1:32:57] and faith of God's word being revealed
[1:32:59] and vindicated today by his schools,
[1:33:03] libraries, literature, hospitals, and so
[1:33:07] forth. He keeps them from it.
[1:33:10] We used to not fear germs until science
[1:33:13] discovered them.
[1:33:15] Now everybody's just germ phobic. Yeah.
[1:33:20] as if they're going to come down with
[1:33:21] some disease. But you know what? We've
[1:33:24] had that journey been there all along.
[1:33:25] But we didn't know it. We just took God
[1:33:27] at his word, didn't we?
[1:33:31] It seemed like the more they discover
[1:33:33] things and the more Amen. The more fear
[1:33:35] people get. They forget about what God
[1:33:37] said to 2,000 years ago, they forget
[1:33:40] what God has been doing. They forget
[1:33:41] that God's rode back the Red Sea. They
[1:33:44] forget the fact that there was three
[1:33:46] Hebrew boys thrown in a fiery furnace.
[1:33:49] God wasn't there the first step, second
[1:33:51] step. He wasn't there the last step, but
[1:33:53] when they got in that fiery furnace,
[1:33:55] there he was.
[1:33:59] And they come out unscathed. That's
[1:34:02] right. All right.
[1:34:04] But see, he keeps them from from this.
[1:34:08] He is now interpreting as he did to
[1:34:10] Pharaoh, trying to keep the people from
[1:34:13] seeing the meaning of the vindicated
[1:34:14] word of his promised age in the evening
[1:34:17] light. Vindicated and proved. Now, did
[1:34:20] you notice that we're not not blind
[1:34:22] faith? This bride has. It's faith in
[1:34:25] something that has actually been proved.
[1:34:29] Do you believe it? This message has been
[1:34:32] proved. Amen.
[1:34:34] And God didn't raise up a scientist to
[1:34:37] prove it. Amen. God didn't raise up some
[1:34:41] doctor of divinity to prove that this
[1:34:43] message is right.
[1:34:45] He didn't even ask us to prove it. He
[1:34:48] proved it himself. That's right. Can you
[1:34:51] say amen? And it just so happened that
[1:34:54] the scientific discovery of man caught
[1:34:58] it.
[1:34:59] That's right. Amen.
[1:35:02] And God's own critic took its picture.
[1:35:05] That's right.
[1:35:08] Ain't that right? So God proved his word
[1:35:12] himself, but he's Satan is trying to
[1:35:15] keep the people from seeing the meaning
[1:35:17] of the vindicated word of his promised
[1:35:19] age in the evening light vindicated and
[1:35:21] proved. He has tried by his knowledge
[1:35:24] and schools and better educated people
[1:35:26] and ethics and so forth to keep them
[1:35:28] from seeing that the message in other
[1:35:31] words the vindication
[1:35:34] anything so that they won't look at that
[1:35:36] and see that that's Jesus Christ. How
[1:35:39] many believes the message is Christ?
[1:35:41] Why? Because Satan hadn't been able to
[1:35:43] keep us from it.
[1:35:47] How you know it's Jesus Christ? He says
[1:35:50] he is the word and he's the word of this
[1:35:53] age.
[1:35:55] Ain't that right?
[1:35:57] So we find brother Brandham in his
[1:35:59] prayer he said this. We pray God that
[1:36:01] you'll so impregnate us with thy word
[1:36:05] that we can see only him. Amen.
[1:36:10] God impregnate us with his word
[1:36:15] with thy word that we can only see
[1:36:17] Christ. That's right. Can you say amen?
[1:36:19] Is that what you want? Amen.
[1:36:24] Christ is in the message. Christ is the
[1:36:26] word. And that's what Satan wants us to
[1:36:29] keep from seeing. He wants us to get so
[1:36:31] busy trying to prove the message is
[1:36:33] right.
[1:36:34] He wants us to get so bothered by the
[1:36:37] skeptics out there and and all these
[1:36:40] things to where we're afraid just to
[1:36:42] simply believe the message. But somebody
[1:36:44] is just simply going to believe this
[1:36:46] message.
[1:36:47] Somebody is simply taking the message
[1:36:50] and saying what a prophet said. Not to
[1:36:52] be ashamed of what a prophet said. Not
[1:36:54] to be scared of to say what a prophet
[1:36:56] said. The bride and the prophet and the
[1:36:59] spirit are going to be saying the same
[1:37:02] thing.
[1:37:03] Can you say amen?
[1:37:06] Brother Brham said everyone will belong
[1:37:09] to either the body of God which is by
[1:37:11] the word or the body of Satan by the
[1:37:14] church.
[1:37:16] The whole world will have to belong to
[1:37:18] some
[1:37:19] church. It worships some god.
[1:37:23] You've got
[1:37:25] to worship either the god of knowledge.
[1:37:28] You rely upon what you hear by
[1:37:30] knowledge. You rely upon this and that
[1:37:32] and the other. Or you rely upon God's
[1:37:35] word by faith, watching for him to
[1:37:38] vindicate it and make it true. Can you
[1:37:41] say amen? Praise the Lord. Do you love
[1:37:44] him? Amen. Amen. We could go more and
[1:37:47] more, but we'll leave it
[1:37:48] there. But she is just believing God's
[1:37:51] word. Simply believing.
[1:37:55] And she is speaking it. She is taking
[1:37:58] the word that she's received in her
[1:38:01] heart and she is speaking it. She speaks
[1:38:04] it in the midst of doubt, criticism,
[1:38:09] unbelief in a world that is so far from
[1:38:13] God. Yet she still speaks it because
[1:38:17] that's she just simply believes.
[1:38:20] May be unscientific to the world. It may
[1:38:24] may be just a word. She just looks dumb
[1:38:27] with no explanations. How how how are
[1:38:30] you going to get a body
[1:38:33] change? How how are you how's the
[1:38:35] rapture really going to happen? How are
[1:38:37] you going to be part of that? I can't
[1:38:39] explain them things. But you know what
[1:38:41] brother Brandham said? If you can
[1:38:42] explain it, then it's not faith.
[1:38:46] You have to you have to accept God by
[1:38:49] faith. You cannot explain God. You you
[1:38:52] cannot sit down and teach God in in one
[1:38:56] two three. It has to be it it it it you
[1:39:00] you have to accept God. Not reason God,
[1:39:04] not explain God. Accept God. Can you say
[1:39:08] amen? And when you can truly accept God,
[1:39:11] then you just let him have his way and
[1:39:13] accept his ways in whatever he does
[1:39:18] because it's right. Amen. Can you say
[1:39:20] amen? It's the musicians will come.
[1:39:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:34] Amen. I can't
[1:39:40] explain how a man could stand in this
[1:39:44] age and tell me that I'm
[1:39:48] justified and that I never did it in the
[1:39:51] first place.
[1:39:53] But I believe it. I believe it.
[1:39:57] I can't explain how a prophet could tell
[1:40:00] me that I am the virtuous, sinless bride
[1:40:02] of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:40:06] But I believe it.
[1:40:10] My mind, my body, the carnal part of me
[1:40:13] wants to try to explain
[1:40:15] that. But you can't explain it. You just
[1:40:18] accept it and believe it. Amen. And you
[1:40:22] live by faith. You walk by faith. You
[1:40:24] speak it just as it was spoken to you.
[1:40:28] Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:40:31] Amen. I love the Lord. Do you love him?
[1:40:39] I
[1:40:40] [Music]
[1:40:43] believe I
[1:40:46] believe you're my
[1:40:50] [Music]
[1:40:51] portion. I
[1:40:53] believe you're more than enough for me.
