may Feast at Jesus table all the time he he read the multitude turn the water into wine to the hungry call it now come and die well aren't you glad we can come and dine amen and not because we desire to so to speak but it's because he's bit us to come amen and we've answered that call and he's desired a man to meet us and defeat us and and as it's been said we've got a seven course meal a man not just part of the book but all the book a man and I'm so glad for that amen because it's building a rapturing faith within us and I thank the Lord for that the musicians can be dismissed appreciate Ann for filling in today amen she was quite nervous and we sprung it on her last night I just said you know you need to play the piano so I appreciate her doing that and appreciate all of our musicians and just good to be here and I trust you're glad to be here and and all the sickness is going around and um the sniffles and the whatever else but um we're here just to glorify the Lord and good to have Seth and Becca and little Titus with us again amen and uh they'll be leaving the Lord willing back home after service but we've certainly enjoyed the having them this week and got to get Titus used to is Pat Paul praise the Lord but uh amen but we love the Lord amen and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to um Ephesians the first chapter amen and we're just such a blessed people Amen to to have what we we know and to be able to believe it and you know as just thinking of the events that going on and in the world and and it seems like there's a crime there's a real cry for Revival um Everybody crying out for Revival they're looking they're wanting they're longing for a move of God and um I was listening to a message this morning Abraham and his seed brother Branham had preached and labored and he gave an altar call and no one moved and he said well surely there's someone here that needs the Lord and a man got up and he said well God bless you he said a Jew you know and just a little bit and he says another one coming up is it an Ethiopian and and he says you know what's the matter with you people you know and he said after hearing that word and nothing moves you anymore and so is these there he said you know he said you can walk out he said you walk out today he said you can walk out and he said you'll walk out to your Eternal destination and he's so he this was in 61. and he says they're going to come a time he said in the name of the Lord that you will cry for a service like this he said you wished you had it it'll be too late and you know I that really struck home and when I heard that this morning and and here lately especially this past week that's all you're hearing is we want a move of God we need a move of God God help us give us a move you know and they they are willing to take any kind of a move of God and um but I I I just thank God every day that we've been able to believe the message of the hour and to know that we're right on track because not because we're following another David koresh but we have seen it supernaturally Vindicated over and over again and we're not we're we're not crying out for Revival we are the Revival we're not crying for something that we haven't received this is something that is ongoing in our personal lives and I'm so glad for that I thought you know back there in 61 if them people would have only realized the effect of their actions to their children and to their grandchildren because now it's their what their grandchildren I guess that are crying out for a move of God in in in this age you know and um but I just thank the Lord I think of the move that is going on right now you know and uh in the in the college and and most of you probably heard it and things and how it's supposed to be is such a move of God such a you know and I say God bless them but at the same time there's no word that is being preached and I've I've you know I wanted to know about this revival what you know so you hear of the testimonies I've been listening to the testimony and not one thing about a miracle not one thing about supernatural signs not one thing it's just singing you know and the uh what seems to be the supernatural to them is that a group of young people been there for all week long singing songs and in somehow it's an attraction you know to to the world uh and they're saying this is it this is the beginning this is the Revival you know and and which you know that that's fine that could be the foolish virgin I don't know but uh but I'm I'm so glad that we're not moved away from the word of God and that we're not moved away from the supernatural we still believe in the Supernatural and we find it out as brother Branham was he he told us and he told us and how right it is that the the the Abraham seed received a a different sign than what Sodom and Gomorrah received amen Abraham received that Supernatural Messiah sign and uh I I'm just glad that we were we've been introduced to that and believed that amen do you love the Lord a man and so here we find in uh in Ephesians 1 22 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all amen let's just bow our heads father we as your children come to you this morning with bowed heads humbled hearts Lord thankful Lord that you have called us for this age and that you have given us a messiah sign Lord oh Lord and we can see it in scriptures Lord and how it fits and just before your coming you have given us this sign Lord we know it to be real true fulfilled and Lord we've got our heads lifted up knowing our Redemption draweth nigh that I pray father that you had just blessed the service this morning may you speak to every Heart Lord and I pray father those that are listening in may be sick I pray that you had touched them and heal them by your Mighty power Lord and I just pray God that you will just Elevate us all into a higher Realm Lord in you father May the word become more living and more real in our personal lives we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen you can have your seats this morning I want to just continue on this thought that we've been speaking on Sunday mornings and we know that God is a person and with a personality and he has existed before all things and by him were all things made he has always existed for he is eternal he's always and in him are attributes and God wanted to express himself through a body for he is he is Spirit and and and a spirit has to have a body a man to express itself um he didn't need another person to represent him such as you know a second or third person of the godhead uh but he just you know he needed a body that he could live in and express himself through uh for he's the only person in the godhead and how people get that all messed up I I don't know but that's just the way it is for uh the Bible says great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh so we find that Jesus Christ Jesus was the human body of of God he was the express image as the Bible would say of God and in him Paul told us that uh in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead so all that God was he poured into Christ and and so um uh brother Branham said that all all the richness of God was formed into him that human body all the mercies of God was formed into him all the wisdom of God all the knowledge all the power of God was formed into him in that human body and God took shape himself in in that body and expressed himself people say today that Jesus was just a prophet brother Branham said if he was just a prophet then we're all lost because we needed more than a prophet ain't that right and so but we know that he was deity God manifested In the Flesh that's that's what it was and and brother Branham said that the thoughts of God was expressed through that body a man for the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the word is a thought first amen so Jesus Christ is the Living Word a man not just the written word but he is the Living Word ain't that rhyme and so God expressed himself to the world through that body brother Brown said he came down in a body of Flesh and expressed himself in a life of love to take all that goodness that he was and give it willingly as the Supreme sacrifice that he might take the guilt of the guilty amen so think of that God holy may get God love and he would take all of that love and express it through the body of Jesus Christ it's the only way he could go to Calvary was by by the love of God that's the only way he could stay true and and and and and take the rejection and and and uh the sufferings and the ridicule is because the love of God and that love was expressed to you and I and It produced the person of Jesus Christ so God walked through that body God lived in that body he he talked through that body God had hands he had he had feet God had a tongue God God had ears he had uh uh uh it was it was Christ and he had eyes and and and and that's what he was and so he gave that body as a sacrifice amen he gave that body as a sacrifice and the purpose of that is that he might bring all of his sons and and daughters uh uh back to him and that the Holy Spirit can speak through us and continue his work amen now it's good to to know what he done in Jesus Christ and it's good to to you know uh you I'm sure you've seen him uh movies or uh of of of uh reenactment of what Christ was his life and how you know uh they do it the best they you know to their interpretation of what he was back then and and these things and and and some of them can be moving some of them can be stirring and you think wow that was you know and and you know and that's fine uh you know you can go to the Passion Play there in in uh uh Eureka Springs Arkansas and and uh they they do the reenactment of Jesus's life and and the crucifixion and all that and that's that's fine that's that's something that you know is is is a good thing but but but he he did that for the sole purpose is to bring other Sons and Daughters unto him that he could continue his work through them a man and so uh said he went away and the Spirit come in that that through his death he might perfect the church and bring the church submissive everybody say submissive see bring the church submissive and then the same spirit that was in Christ is in the church doing the same things Christ did amen and this is why it doesn't stump us when he says in the little a little while and the world seeth me no more but you'll see me for I'll be in you and with you even to the end of the world ain't that right I want to just drop this in because uh there's been you know there's only three times in the history of the world that God has come in his fullness in a body and the first time we see it there when God appeared to Abraham a man and it was in the form of Melchizedek and see uh uh Abraham and Sarah had come to their end of life and so God had taken a handful of dust as the prophet would tell us and he blew a man uh uh and and he formed a body a body was created and he actually done three bodies a man uh for Gabriel to step in one and another one to step in another and so two angels and then he created himself a body a spoken word body a man uh uh a human being and he he stepped into that body and that's how he appeared to Abraham was as a man ain't that right a man but Abraham by Revelation knew that it was more than a man it was God and and yet that that uh God in that body amen he drunk milk from the cow he he he ate uh uh meat from the cow of a calf and and he sat down with Abraham and talked with Abraham but uh something that showed that he was God is that he'd done a sign as and we all know that listened to brother Branham a man he performed he appeared as the son of man the prophet said a man and he performed the sign of son of man which is the Messiah sign ain't that rhyme and we all know what that sign was is that that as he's talking to Abraham and he's promising Abraham that he would visit them and and that it would the seed would come through Sarah Sarah was in the tent behind him and snickered amen within herself the Bible says she laughed within herself and God says where's thy wife Sarah and he says he's in the tent behind you she's in the tent behind Jesus well why did she laugh and she says I didn't laugh and he says you but you did laugh and and of course we we know that it was God Amen in a human body the second time that God came in his fullness is when uh the the natural Seed of Abraham uh the Jew came to its End Amen and God created a body in the womb of Mary and manifested himself as son of man ain't that right he becomes son of man again and he called himself son of man a man and he lived in that body amen for 33 and a half years a man but he performed a sign a man and it was the same sign that that Melchizedek uh uh manifest or performed a man it was the sign of the son of man a messiah sign ain't that rhyme a man and over and over he would uh uh he he performed it to Philip he uh I believe it were Nathanael he performed at uh uh uh to the woman at the well and he he he performed it uh to the Jew and the Samaritan a man's seat and so uh uh that that was the second time but then we find a man that this third time a man the Gentiles a man is to receive that same sign at their End Amen the Gentile a man and the Royal Seed of Abraham a man we're at the end of our time ain't that right amen but God promised that just before the fire falls a man he would come in flesh again he would appear in a body and he would perform a man as the son of man he would perform the sign of the son of man ain't that right and so we find that this is where we're at today that God has got a body here upon the Earth amen God's able to uh to accomplish a body on the earth and and the prophet said today God represents himself in the human flesh of his church God the Holy Ghost in his church moving through his church speaking with tongues interpreting tongues Healing The Sick and then the last sign the word so manifested till it's a discerner of the thoughts and in the intents of the heart ain't that right amen so last Sunday we spoke of the promise amen I just touched on it the promise that God gave to Abraham a man reads some scripture here Genesis 12 and 7 and the Lord appeared to Abraham or Abram and said unto thy seed will I give this land now think of that undivised seed Genesis 13 15 for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed be also be numbered amen see in Genesis 22 and 17 God said to Abraham thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy ain't that right amen now we know that God blessed Abraham a man with a natural seed and with the spiritual seed uh uh there and and the natural seed was Isaac a man but but we see through the message of the hour a man that and and the Bible it all goes together but uh that the natural seed was not the seed that God was really talking about amen uh uh it was not the real promise see uh many people today have it in their mind that God was speaking to the naturals about the natural seed and and that's not true he was actually speaking of of a spiritual seed a man a seed that would come forth from the supernatural ain't that right I'm just so glad for the supernatural amen if you take away the supernatural you ain't got nothing at all you wouldn't even have a testimony you wouldn't even have hope you you ain't got nothing to go off of ain't that right a man's seed but now we know that Israel is of that natural seed and and they were a people that God chose a man to display uh the supernatural by amen but yet they were the natural seed and and so the Bible tells us of the supernatural power a man that was performed by that natural seed Waters rolled back uh the dead raised Giants fell walled cities uh uh uh crumbled uh uh the jaws of a lion was ripped apart and and the Lion's mouths were were shut uh for Daniel as he was in that Den of Lions and and fire the fire lost its power Amen to the three Hebrew children as they were in the fiery furnace and and these things all of these things and many more a man but they were are done by the supernatural amen it took the supernatural to do this amen and yet they they were conquerors amen as as we mentioned just a little bit of how that that that that that natural seed were conquerors a man and and Sham guard for example he realized that he was the uh uh the seed a part of a covenant that God had made with his forefather Abraham and and here he was the enemy I believe of the many nights or something like that kept coming over and stealing his crop and and uh finally he just got tired of it and and he realized hold it amen they ain't got no right Amen to to bother me and my family and and and to mess with us I am of the Covenant of God Amen and I am of that natural seed and so he as being just a farmer took an ox gold and he went and met 600 of them uh uh the anime or maybe even more I don't know but the Bible says he killed 600 a man by one man with an ox gold a man but under an anointing by a covenant promise that God gave his forefather amen Abraham so so they were conquerors amen David stood there and faced that Goliath amen unafraid because he was part of a covenant amen see the seed even that natural seed you'll find that there was conquering a man ability conquering power and it wasn't that that David had the ability he wasn't that sham guard had the ability it was God was honoring the Covenant ain't that right but but in all that they conquered a man they did not conquer sin they didn't conquer death hell and the grave they they they weren't able to bring mankind into relationship with God they they were not able to to to make a man justify God in the sight of God they didn't conquer the lust and the passions of men they didn't conquer Pride amen they were just born of Flesh ain't that right they were a natural seed and and so they were not the seed of the woman who would bruise the the head of the serpent as God promised in in Genesis see and and if you just notice for a moment no woman has a seed of her own amen she's she's only a carrier of of man's seed ain't that right but God said to that serpent the woman's seed will bruise thy head you'll bruise his heel a man but he's going to bruise your head ain't that right a man's seat and so he said it would be the woman's seed and so it showed that God was speaking of a virgin birth a man because that was the only way a man that it could be attributed not to man's seed but to the woman's seed a man see it could only be her seed if it didn't come from man so God created the seed within her and it attributed it amen to being her seed ain't that right amen that's right see so we find that Jesus Christ is the true Royal Seed of Abraham amen because the natural seed could not bruise the Serpent's head amen but that would be one gate that God would conquer amen that would be one gate of the enemy amen that would be the main gate that of the enemy is that the seed would conquer the Gate of the enemy a man by bruising his head ain't that right amen now you know they they they they conquered but they didn't conquer everything because they didn't bruise a man of the Serpent's head and that word bruise means to make an atonement uh uh the prophet said that word bruise is to make an atonement so God even in the beginning was promising a redeemer ain't that right amen and he said it would be a seed that would come it would be a seed and then later on he would tell Abraham it would be thy seed amen and and but it wouldn't be a natural seed amen it would be of the faith Seed of Abraham ain't that right so God promising a redeemer to come the Messiah to redeem a man not to redeem the seed of man amen but to redeem the word of God Amen the word seed can you say amen amen not Redeeming the seed of man but to redeem the word seed now brother Branham says he come uh uh uh he said redeem is to pick up that which has fallen ain't that Ryan so to redeem back to a place where it was at the beginning amen he come to redeem back to a place where it was at the beginning so none will be picked up but them that was in his thoughts at the beginning ain't that right amen he come to redeem his Fallen thoughts amen and in order to do that he had to defeat the Gate of the enemy the very enemy that had to ride over you that kept holding you back a man that kept condemning you that had a right to condemn you before God before the atonement amen he come to make that atonement amen and defeat the enemy and conquer the enemy ain't that right see he come to redeem not this cannon father that we see running around professing to be Christians but that he came to redeem that which was in God's thinking at the beginning amen another place he come to redeem or to bring life to life those predestinated seed that God seen before the founding nation of the world and put their names in The Book of Life ain't that right amen another place he says God by his death the shed blood brought back bought back his own he bought back the spoken word seed bride ain't that right a man so this was the Conquering power a man that that that the natural Seed of Abraham could not do amen it could not bring back it could not buy back it could not break the power Amen to where the word could come forth amen and be made a reality it just couldn't do it to think of it today amen that you're here in Flesh and Bones and and and and and born of Sinner and yet you could stand here singing praises unto God lifting up holy holy hands think of that lifting up holy hands not because you say they're holy or I say they're holy but their holy hands before God Amen which show that the enemy had been conquered ain't that right see so we we find a man that that uh it was impossible for that natural seed to bruise the Serpent's head amen but all those Old Testament Saints in their Conquering the prophet said we're only Shadows of his coming so when you see them conquering amen uh uh when you read about sham guard and he's defeating the uh the the 600 Philistines that was just a a a type to show of a real conqueror that was coming amen when you see David standing there with just a slingshot amen and he's conquering a Goliath that was well trained and and put fear in the hearts of the people but there was a young boy amen and defeated that thing it was only showing of a real conqueror to come ain't that right so they were only Shadows of his coming amen reflecting Christ amen see but the prophet says but when he come it finished the whole fight amen as we had read Sunday it finished the whole fight amen so it was Jesus Christ The Royal seed at the Royal seed a man who was born with the power as the prophet says in his veins to conquer death and Hell amen see he was more amen than just a natural seed amen he came from the Royal Seed of Abraham ain't that right and the prophet said he conquered sickness he conquered Temptation when the enemy spit in his face mowed his jaw he turned the other side when they jerked his head or his beard from his face and spit on upon him he never wrought back he conquered the Gate of Temptation and took it he conquered and took the Gate of the leprosy he took the Gate of fever amen he took and he made every nature obey him amen he made that and think of that church amen so all of this diseases and all these things that are out here that it is causing the world to fear and to tremble amen we stand here knowing that he conquered them things amen he conquered it all amen you can say Amen if you're a Believer amen he conquered it amen to where you don't have to fear it you don't have to worry about it and he even conquered death amen to where if you went by the way of the Grave you don't have to fear it amen because you know you'll raise again amen it's already been conquered ain't that right so we're not looking for a conquer we found a conqueror amen he created a body Amen to where he could bruise amen the devil's head amen by anatoman amen that he could live in another body and show forth his victory the natural seed had conquered Seas they had conquered nature they had conquered lions and Fire but they couldn't conquer death but Jesus conquered death hell and the grave he's the one David didn't do it Joseph even as perfect he only had one flaw but he couldn't do it they couldn't take the keys from Satan but this Concord did God would come in a body Amen in his fullness amen and all power in Heaven and Earth was given unto him that's what Jesus said amen and that body took the took took the took your sickness he took the everything that you that would bother you and he took all the darts and he put it in himself can you say amen and he and as the prophet said he took the stinger out of Satan you know I think oh isn't a wasp or a bumblebee or something like that and once they sting you it's over I can't sting you again well the prophet said that was the devil amen he sunk his stinger in so deep in Christ a man that he couldn't get it out amen now he has nothing to sting you with he's a liar to begin with he's an imitator to begin or a a uh he's won that that uh not imitates uh well he does that too but uh uh he makes people scared of him but all he is is a bluff can you say man amen for we we found the Conqueror a man that that would fulfill amen what God Said thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy amen that's right and Christ did that ain't that right so the prophet said the fight was finished at Gethsemane and that Calvary now we everybody say now we we stand as conquerors amen there's no fight to it you stand as a conqueror it's already finished are you with me church it's already finished no wonder he could justify you before you ever got here no wonder amen that he could already glorify you before you even done your first sin amen you we would always think well uh or maybe just in my mind that that I had the first to give my heart to God and then God would act upon that amen but I found that he's already done it before the foundation of the world because he knew he would become the Seed of Abraham he he would become the role see he would create a body and he would become that seed to defeat the Gate of the enemy can you say amen he took the fight amen he conquered amen and he rose again now as the body of Christ as the body we are heirs and Joint heirs with him in all the blessings in all the promises ah can you say man that's right see now we talk and we read about the body of Christ today and I I believe that that we are part of the body how many believes you're part of the body amen we're part of that body but maybe to get a clear picture as to who we are as the body I want to just talk a little bit more about the Covenant uh that God made to Abraham and and you see the prophet said the only way that we can be saved is by being in the Covenant with Abraham that's the only way a man can be saved is he has to be in the Covenant with Abraham now that means that God had to foreknow you that when God was given the Covenant and said it's to thy seed amen Sean Martin was on his mind can you say amen amen and I was in that Covenant right then and we say that we were you know we sing that song while he was on the cross I was on his mind now church that's a reality for he was making the Covenant he was confirming the Covenant amen right there he was God's covenant to Abraham amen and while he was there hanging on the cross and that Royal Blood was dropping down and and uh uh Redeeming the earth I was on his mind I was redeemed right then can you say amen amen that's right see the blood was for me amen so but see you you cannot you cannot be in the Covenant unless you're the Seed of Abraham for it's to his seed thee and thy seed ain't that right but we're not of the natural Seed of Abraham a man so we're not the children of Promise in that way amen we have no claims to the promise of Abraham as being a natural seed I'm not of Israel I'm not I'm not part of the Israel in the natural lineage amen but see we find out amen you're reading in the Bible listening to the message you find out that it's not the natural that counts out it's not a natural lineage it's not the natural seed a man for we find out that that Abraham had other Sons besides Isaac ain't that right amen and and and we find of course it was uh Ishmael but then he had seven or had other Sons a man uh uh you know uh after Isaac a man you know uh God had changed Abraham to youth again and so when Sarah died uh uh uh Abraham married another woman and had other Sons and Daughters by by her but they were not part of the Covenant amen they were natural seed but they were not part of the Covenant amen for in Genesis 21 12 God told Abraham and Isaac everybody say in Isaac in Isaac shall thy seed be called in Isaac amen so we we again see the election of God and amen and and I say it this way your natural lineage is not a guarantee a man of of uh anything when it comes to the promises of God Amen your parents could be holy and righteous and clean living and and spotless amen but but that does no guarantee that you're part of the promises of God can you say amen for it's not by a natural lineage amen we we find uh looking at even Joe Josephus the well-known historian he tells us that even Adam had 70 sons and uh or had 70 children a and and uh of course a mix of sons and daughters and yet we only read of Abel and we only read of Seth after Abel you understand what I'm saying it was Enoch which was the seventh from Adam who was translated amen uh that he should not see death of who was of that lineage ain't that right see amen forward came from that lineage amen but he but but only he and his family a man uh uh went into the ark and and what happened to the rest of them you understand what I'm saying amen the Bible says or that the sons of God looked upon the daughters of of men and so that they were Fair the prophet says it was the sons of Seth a man that looked upon the daughters of men and committed adultery and and fornication and all this and and got destroyed the world ain't that right so it's not natural lineage if you're looking for natural lineage and and using that for your Alibi amen that that's not it ain't that right amen see so so we find it has to do with election so people think that all the Jews are God's chosen people but that's not true amen Romans 9 and 6 says breaking in Paul says they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children ain't that right amen see and so brother Brown says see that don't make them Israelites now watch what are you typing brother Branham I'm typing the church see all that confess Christ is not Christians all that go to church are not Christians all Abraham's seed wasn't them uh did not have the promise amen all of Abraham's seed did not have the promise it was in Isaac shall thy seed be called ain't that right Amen in the eighth verse that is he says Paul says they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise everybody say the children of the promise the children of the promise are counted for seed amen so not all the Seed of Abraham a man was counted of the promise amen not all of them was of of of of of of of the seed that God was speaking in the Mantra Amen brother Brown said it was an elect it was the promise and the promise was foretold to Abraham and the elect of God was for ordained before the foundation of the world so not all Israel is considered to be God's chosen people amen Revelation 7 tells us that God is going to take a hundred and forty four thousand Jews amen and and and that would be 12 son out of uh uh each tribe and there's 12 tribes ain't that right and he's going to seal them with this Spirit they are the ones who are really part of the Covenant amen amen they're the ones hey man but the rest of them are just cannon fodder and yet they're Jews ain't that right that God's got according to election he's got a number and he's going to seal 12 000 out of each tribe a man to be uh uh uh part of that that this in time uh uh uh when he when he deals with Israel amen he deals in other words he's dealing with Israel not all Israel amen but he's dealing with that 12 144 000. amen and when when Moses and Elijah come and begin to preach the message there will be 144 000 that'll accept this the message of the hour can you say amen amen that's right amen uh notice what the Jews now the Jews consider themselves all a part of the Covenant all Abraham's seed and and so they they look at what they said to Jesus in John 8 33 they answered him we be Abraham him seed but notice what Jesus said in the 37th verse I know that your Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word everybody say my word has no place in you so there were Jews a man that were not that the word did not have any place in them the Covenant didn't mean amen anything to them ain't that right like it did to David like it did to Sham guards like it did to Moses like it did to all of the elect down Through the Ages ain't that right amen so now the prophet said see the real Seed of Abraham believes the promise just like Abraham did because it's to Abraham and his seed after him can you say Amen now so we we look for just a moment and I hope I'm making a little sense to you but the natural seed who were part of the Covenant said amen they were believers hey can you say man Daniel was a Believer and he was supernaturally delivered from the Lion's Den amen the prophet said a supernatural light a supernatural angel came down by a man that believed in the Supernatural he trusted in a supernatural God do you believe that amen the Hebrew boys were Believers amen they were thrown into a fire that was heated up seven times hotter amen than it has ever been do you realize we're living in an age that's seven times worse than it has ever been amen worse right here in the middle of it all that God would prove by that natural seed that if you're a Believer he will deliver you just like he did in them amen there is a Deliverance you don't have to worry about it you don't have to fear you say oh it looks Troublesome don't you fear you stand like that natural seed and say I believe God I don't care how bad it looks I don't care what kind of a situation stand there as a Seed of Abraham and say I believe regardless brother Brown said while they were in the midst of the fire there was a supernatural sign of a supernatural God standing in the fire supernaturally saving them God is supernaturally saving his people today they are supernaturally being redeemed there supernaturally amen there's a a suit by Supernatural there's a faith that is being built in them for a Rapture amen there's other people that listen to this message don't get nothing out of it but there is a Believer a man that by the supernatural there is a faith amen ready for a Rapture rapturing faith is being built in them because they are a believer [Applause] Moses was a believer Bill Graham said he believed in a supernatural God and it met him and talked to him in a supernatural way at a supernatural Bush at a supernatural fire on a bush and he got a supernatural message a one-man going down a one-man Invasion to take over Egypt a supernatural message but it was from the supernatural God and I stand here to tell you the message that we have received has come from a supernatural God it has come supernaturally it ain't some man-made gimmick it ain't some some man-made idea amen it was from God himself and I'm so glad that I'm part of it that I am a recipient for that Supernatural message that came from a supernatural God supernaturally delivered a natural people out of the land of Egypt come on now the prophet said the people were delivered supernaturally now how are we a part of the Covenant of Abraham see notice in thy seed in Isaac shall I see be called yet through Isaac come Christ the rule Seed of Abraham now listen now he's the Royal Seed of Abraham and through Isaac he came notice Christ was in Abraham Christ was in Isaac Christ was in Jacob look how he come Christ was in Joseph Christ was in Moses Christ was in David Christ was in Jeremiah amen he's coming down to that natural seed you understand what I'm saying amen and as you're looking at it we're not reading about man's lives we're reading about Christ amen Paul or brother Brown said if you read the Bible through and through and don't see Christ in every bit of it you need to read it again it was Christ coming down through that natural seed Christ was shown in in sham guard Christ was shown Amen in the Hebrew children Christ was revealed it was Christ the Christ Christ all the way through that natural seed can you say amen amen but he is the real true seed ain't that right now notice we're talking about natural and spiritual now the first seed was Isaac of Abraham which came by the natural a flesh ain't that right Bram said Abraham's seed was Isaac which is Jewish natural he was the Lesser son Isaac was Abraham's son sexually ain't that right something that Abraham produced but the second seed was Jesus Christ which was spiritually I Isaac came through a sex act Christ came by promise for he was God's word made manifest ain't that right see he came by promise you got you got to study the message now brother Graham talks about it he came by promise Christ came by promise not by sex act hello that's right Isaac came by what Abraham did [Music] Christ came by what Abraham believed ain't that Ryan so it is with the body of Christ today now notice John 1 12 as and as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not a blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God you were born by the will of God can you say Amen so when it comes to us as being the body of Christ there's no natural lineage tied to us there's no natural tied to us it wasn't a church that birthedist it wasn't a denomination that brought us we came by the will of God ain't that right so the prophet said you're the Royal lineage everybody say I am though the Royal lineage then he says you are the promise you are the promise nothing natural you are the promise ain't that right he said see the rule Seed of Abraham which is by faith in the promised word is now being made manifest on the Earth today who is it Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and for ever right ain't that right now he goes and says now Isaac was only substitutionary until Christ came so Isaac being of the natural seed was a type of Christ just as much as Rebecca was the type of the Bride Isaac was substitutionary until Christ come and through the natural seed of Isaac look at that little lineage and what they conquered look at the enemy they defeated look at the supernatural that worked through that substitutionary but it was only until Christ came ain't that right yes sir so Christ did not come by Abraham's natural life but rather by Abraham's faith in the word of God see so the natural seed of Isaac finally failed the prophet said and died it backslid and hybrid too but notice the faith Seed of Abraham that he believed God's word regardless of what the circumstances was there you are who he says you know I just feel like shouting look the faith Seed of Abraham what was it not Abraham's body that produced Christ but Abraham's faith that produced that seed ain't that right Abraham's faith in what God's word no matter what come he called anything contrary to it as though it wasn't even there [Applause] and what was Jesus neither Jew nor Gentile he was God ain't that right he didn't come reflecting a Jew he didn't come reflecting Gentile he was the body of God said he came by Abraham's spiritual life who took everything contrary to God's word and called it as though it was not and believed God against hope he believed in hope that's the real seed that we're speaking of Amen now Abraham could only be a father of many nations through Christ not through Isaac can you say man Abraham look in Revelation 7 and 9. after this I be held in law a great multitude a man which no man can number now notice he's not speaking of the nation of Israel a man of the natural seed but he says of all Nations and kindreds and peoples and tongues stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed uh with white robes and Palms in their hands and cried with the loud voice saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb can you say Amen see amen notice Romans 4 and 16 therefore it is of faith that it might be of grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all ain't that right so now we can find out that every nation amen peoples of every nation tongues and language amen can be included in this Seed of Abraham in the promises in The Inheritance that God gave Abraham as an Everlasting Covenant a Grace Covenant can you say Amen but it can only be by the Royal see Jesus Christ could Abraham become the father of us all [Music] you see Faith produces what God Said so God wasn't dependent upon Abraham a man to to produce the seed on his own the seed would come by his faith in God's word do you realize faith gets you somewhere faith can move mountains faith can bring things into existence faith can bring things out of existence your faith can defeat the devils your faith can bring life to people it's true that's what that's what a prophet said if you have enough faith for yourself then have faith for that law wayward son or daughter no matter how Wayward they are even if God has to put them on a death's bed they'll be there anyhow by faith all things are possible to them that believe is that right so his faith Abraham's faith in God's word produced a supernatural seed amen see the promised word brother Brown said was that raw seed what God promised there was Christ everything that God promised was there in Christ in that body now today it stands the same thing everything that God promised is now in the body today so brother Graham said the sacrifice is paid the rule seed died the Royal seed rose again now everybody say now he's not giving us a history lesson in stopping now he brings it today the church stands Justified by believing that God believe in that work of calvary not by what you do what you don't do it's by believing regardless of the circumstance I believe how do you know because the work is finished and I believe it ain't that right amen see it stands justified by believing that and the rule seed the Royal seed Christ can come into these people and even make them join heirs Sons and Daughters of God is that not what happened to you Christ God almighty came and chose your body before he could do it he had to redeem you he had to cleanse you up justify you sanctify you [Music] give you a supernatural birth can you see amen see so now we are the rule Seed of Abraham remember Paul said from him begat many sons from him the seed be yet many sons notice in in Galatians 3 and 29 Paul writes if ye be christs then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise I think it behooves us to look at this book as promises [Music] it all depends who you are not every scripture applies to the bride and not every scripture applies to the foolish virgin not every scripture applies to The Sinner and ungodly yellow now I know we've had ministers mix it all up and they have tried to threaten the bride they have tried to to put pressure on people you can't do it it's promises we are Heirs of the promise ain't that right if God can't do it who can if God is the one that saved you he saved you to make you an heir of a promise not to be afraid of God not to Amen to fear God oh yeah you fear Him in a reverence but not fear Him in the way that he's going to strike you that it is impossible for a Believer Amen to cross the line amen so if you be Christ's then you argue Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise and brother Brown says it like this if you be in Christ then you are Abraham's seed not according to the flesh but according to the promise ain't that right see so brother Brown says now these who are of the Roll seed are the elect of God are the predestinated foreknown of God and were in the mind of God in his thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally I know you're you're you're you're you're in time here and things happen in time that it can never change what has been eternal and what is eternal ain't that right when it comes to Eternity time is just a little glitch just a little scratch when it comes to Eternity there's not spaces it's just a scratch so your little lifespan of say you lived a thousand years it's just a little scratch in in in and it never God doesn't look at them things I hope you understand God looks at what you've always been that's right that's good so what you are here can never change you know trying to even imagine trying to even describe how time is to God is impossible but we do know what was Paul that would say A Thousand Years is as a day so could you imagine what your 70 years is like to God just a millimeter of a second to God to us it seems like forever but God is just oh I love him you were eternal Hallelujah and and it'll never be erased from God's mind can you say man so here we find he says now see that you was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season and as each member came forth it became expressed and took place in took its place in the body yes amen not natural body Supernatural body word body thus this bride is the literal everybody say literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ ain't that right so now as Jesus came forth by the word for he was the word so does this body of Jesus Christ today come forth by the word [Applause] for she is the word the word spoke of her First Corinthians 12 13 for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body and notice now First Peter 1 22 he says being born again remember Jesus told Nicodemus except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and Nicodemus in His Brilliant intelligent intellectual carnal mind thought that he was speaking about entering the his mother's womb again he says how does a man enter his mother's womb again for the second time to be born again but then Peter explains how that birth happens being born again not of corruptable seed a sexual seed but of incorruptable by the word of God which liveth and abide us forever oh I hope you understand that you could not have a new birth except the word of God spoke of you there is a whole book of promises that was already foretelling of you thank you ain't that right so what is she the prophet said she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him ain't that right I hope it makes some sense to you today we are of that Royal seat of Abraham not by natural lineage but by this word so according to the Bible we see that the bridegroom and the bride must have blood relation they will be blood relation Isaac which type the the uh which was the type of Jesus Christ married his own blood relation his cousin ain't that right see and brother Brown said that's why she could go to the Waters of life so quickly this is why the angel of the Lord could speak to her she was blood relation to Isaac oh man see and he says a blood relation is who the angel of the Lord can speak to today the voice of God speaking today falls on many deaf ears millions of people can understand the voice of God and now he explains it you've got to be a blood relation there has to be a relation can you say amen and if he was their old seed I am that roll seed that's why the voice of God can speak to you today they were both they were blood relation not by mothers but by fathers and you say amen and Jesus said God was his father and the same father that was his father is our father [Music] Spirit can you say man in word so the bride the Bride In Christ are of the same word see do you believe that both were predestinated before the foundation of the world both carried the word Gene within them both have the same life within them have the same spirit in them both have the same power in them their blood relation ain't that right and and so that's why each of us have come uh uh see blood relation to Christ brother Branham says see uh uh through the sacrifice when our sins are emitted by the blood of Jesus not by what some church says what somebody else says but what the blood has done and proved that it's done by the word working to the same thing carrying out the same Ministry he had that's why we cannot just put it all on brother Branham but the works that I did Jesus said shall you do also that wasn't just speaking of brother Brown that was speaking to his role seed bride why they're of the same relation the same word that spoke of him now speaks of us and we are inheritance we are heirs with him heirs can you say Amen Church heirs God choose you for this last day the worst age ever to show that your Heir is a promise yes sir so you gauge in your Christianity by how you feel you're not doing it according to Abraham did it amen that's right so Isaac can Rebecca now notice they could marry being cousins they could marry because her seed was strong where Brown said their seed was strong the seed wasn't weak as it is today ain't that right and the seed that's in Christ and the Bride is a strong seed it ain't weak Church seeds weak hello they can't be United God can't Unite with the weak seed but this bride seed is strong because she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she's she's strong she'll take every word she'll count everything a lie it's strong enough to defeat the enemy with if Jesus can do it you can do it if Jesus stood it by the words you can stand by this word Jesus defeated the devil based upon the word of God he had power upon power upon power but he used not a want to show that the weakest Christian can take the word and defeat the same Devil by yeah this this seed ain't it ain't weak it's a word seed it isn't become weak with all this hybridization and Creeds and dogmas and all that can you say man it's a pure word seed and notice brother Brown said Rebecca made her decisions quick watch her real quick then in the meeting quickly if they're ordained to life they'll know it there's something in the message that stares them that's what steered Rebecca see the message stared her for the angel was leading her can you say amen he says in another place there's no way at all of getting to him getting a man to God unless he's predestinated to be a Son of God there's just no way of doing it amen Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and that's the truth everything he did there was something contrary see everything he did there was somebody to to be contrary to it if he did it this way well then it was supposed to be this way and this way see it was supposed to be back that way see it's just unbelief amen see every Everything he'd done there was always someone to question it everything he did it didn't matter how Supernatural it was there was always a crowd there being a skeptic and why did you do it this way why didn't you do it this way and and all that and brother Ben just plainly says it's because of unbelief ain't that right it takes being blood relation aren't you glad you're the body of Jesus Christ Lord praise the Lord amen so Jesus is the word he says and he is the bridegroom and the Bride is a part of the groom therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day and it's the same word same experience same life another place he said watch what God did to the Royal seed to make the Covenant confirm he took Christ which was the Seed of Abraham on Calvary he tore him apart he took the spirit off of him and put his body in the grave and his soul in hell and raised him up on the third day and raised up his body and brought it up into glory and there sent the spirit back down and kept the body on his right hand side sent the spirit back down to live in the church to make a church just so much with the Life of Christ that in the Resurrection the two will come together bride and bridegroom the church in Christ will be exactly alike with the same kind of ministry the same kind of power same kind of spirit he raised up the body of Jesus Christ and set him on his right side his right hand and poured down the spirit upon the church on the day of Pentecost and that's how he proved his Covenant with his church and that's how he proves that you're part of this Covenant amen and that you're part of the church is the same power same life the same word is now in you quickening you [Music] the Seed of Abraham another place brother Brown said we're born by Christ which makes us the supersede with Christ to God we're supersede I know this is simple but I hope it gets down into your soul we're supersede not by flesh not by the natural not because you got a lineage of a family tree that was all Christians not because your grandpa was in a brand of meeting can you say Amen you're supersede because you were birthed by Christ that rules seed Hallelujah don't look at your flesh look at what you are by the birth can you say man now we've talked about it notice in second Corinthians 5 17 If any man be in Christ he is a new creature he is a new creation oh things are passed away and behold all things are become new one place brother Brian said when you receive the Holy Ghost your sexual blood is dismissed buddy that means a lot your sexual blood is dismissed everything that was passed down to the genealogy of your family tree is dismissed I don't care what it is if it's in the physical if it's in the middle you say well my family's been mental had mental complications it's dismissed why because you're a rule Seed of Abraham you are what God was talking about thee and thy seed shall possess the Gate of its enemy can you shame I am you say well then if if Jesus conquered the gates then why am I having to fight amen is to show that he was Victorious remember Satan's already been stripped you're fighting a defeated enemy I think even the prophet said that you're fighting a defeated enemy when Jesus fought him he had your grand Satan had the grounds but Jesus defeated him by paying the atonement and the Redemptive price ain't that right there is no sacrifice that is needed anymore there is no more need for the shed the blood to be shed again now you have that token and that token must need to be displayed and that token is not natural blood it's the very life Supernatural life of God living in you now you're defeating and you're you're you're dealing with a defeated enemy quit let him talk to you quit let him defeat you quit listening to the lies that tell you that you're a defeated individual you're the super seed your blood relation you realize you're more than what that natural seed was if a natural seed if God could use the natural seed to defeat the natural enemy what can God do through a royal seed roll seed what is it you're the body of Jesus Christ the same God that lived in that one body is now living in you it's Christ in you not you and Christ it's Christ in you we read that quote a while back brother Brown says I'll choose a people and through them I'll defeat my enemy through them that's right and you say man let the sickness come and through them sickness will be defeated let that old cancer come and through them that cancer will be defeated you believe it people don't like the Old Testament because it's it's it's you know it's hearing someone the other day said it's just too gruesome you know what actually they're trying to they're trying to take stories out of the Bible That's too gruesome I think it was one professor in a Christian College if I remember right in a Christian College just just the other day reading from the Bible from the Old Testament and a group of people got together that the students got together to to take that out since he had no right to to read that I don't know what it was maybe it's Joshua's standing on a king's head I don't know but it was gruesome to them but you know what what they don't get is every in the net they were a natural people conquering if you can let quit this ringing in the the natural people conquering natural Gates but they were only testifying of what you would do in the Supernatural there there were Gates that were stronger than them that they could not defeat but you're on this other side of California you're on the other side of the atonement you you remember now they could do that under a blood atonement but it was a natural blood ain't that right they did they conquered remember Moses amen speaking flies into existence and brother Brown said he could only do that by natural blood he was under a blood atonement but it was a natural blood what can the church do under a royal blood when the true enemy has been defeated and conquered now you can go to your gate you can that the thing that is troubling your family you can stand up that gate and say devil you're a liar you've already been conquered I ain't gonna believe you see you're you're you're now fighting off of a finished fight you with me now see they were standing looking ahead to be done you're standing looking back and see what has already been done so now you're defeating on what has been done and if the blood of Jesus Christ ain't that strong then why are we serving God but it is so strong that you can defeat every devil of hell you can stand there based upon the action of calvary and now that rule blood is flowing through your veins his his do you realize that the very literal life of God is in you deity is not in heaven it's in you you are that body of Jesus Christ today your hands your mouth your eyes your feet are his see he done it at work to bring and I I really like that he done it to bring Satan defeat Satan so that he could bring you submissive to him oh man you love him the Royal Seed of Abraham now we know that Jesus reveals himself in Revelation as the beginning of the creation of God but we see that we are the continuation of the creation of God Abraham said now every son that you eat and born of a natural sexual birth the way you come see then when it it comes to a place to where you go through water baptism then Holy Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims this creation the same as he did him the Holy Ghost and God is the same Spirit it comes down and claims this body for the resurrection he was raised for our justification all the father has given me will come not one will be lost I'll raise it up at the last day not one hair of the head will even perish that is the beginning of the creation of God this is the continuation of the creation of God see it was through his blood cell that your natural blood cell was broken away brother Brown says now you're enshrouded you are enshrouded with the blood cell of Abraham's seed which is Christ there is no iniquity no filth inside of that blood cell for it can only contain the life of God which is the Holy Ghost aren't you glad for that what it means to have the Holy Ghost there's no filth in it there's no iniquity in it what you are born of is a new creation a blood cell which is of god word and in that blood cell that you're surrounded by and shrouded by there's no filth there's no iniquity there's there's nothing there but God Holiness righteousness empty musicians will come brother Brown says in this day there is to come a super raw Seed of Abraham when 2 000 years ago no this day that's exactly what it'll be would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son what's happening to show that your blood relation amen the show that the same life flows in your veins has it done him that's a conquering life it's a creative life and every word that he fulfilled now you're fulfilling now the same Ministry same Ministry was he a conqueror yes he was and you are too did heal the sick yes he did and this bride this body is too hello for you to walk over for people to walk away claim him and to be the body of Christ and do away with the supernatural shows they're not blood relation ain't that right he said now as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual bride raise up which will be the rule seed of the rule faith of Abraham's rule son she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise that's given to her according to Malachi 4 a scripture there is to rise a message that'll shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolic fathers again why to bring forth that word bride that Royal bride Theirs to rise on the scene and the power of Elijah that'll rise on the scene A wilderness man that'll come out and will have a message that will run right straight back to the word again and that's the hour we're living in you realize you're not a product of a church you're a product of this message your faith ain't coming in from inspired or come in existence by a Creed of man or some uh uh uh false Revelation or some personality of a man it comes straight by restored word that came from a Malachi for wow because your children of promise promise preacher promise no God promised ain't that right so this Malachi 4 that the prophet is calling you by the word Glory why that's your identification was that not Jesus's identification he found himself he identified who himself by the word and if you remember he told them Skeptics and them doubters if you really want to know who I am go search the scriptures you claim to know for they testify of me that's my vindication and so is it today the word of God is this rule bride's vindication it speaks of us you want to know if you can conquer look at what the word says no weapon formed against you shall prosper that's what the word says it speaks of you can you say man you love him amen what song in the book is mine oh every promise in the book
