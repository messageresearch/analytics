[35:49] My God is bigger, better, stronger. He's
[35:54] greater than
[35:57] you.
[35:59] Oh my enemies scatter cuz they know the
[36:03] battle is
[36:07] done. Oh my God are stronger. The
[36:12] victories already won.
[36:17] You see, he died for my ransom. He rose
[36:22] up on the third
[36:26] day. Oh, cuz my God is greater than
[36:31] death. Hell and the
[36:35] grave. Oh, I won't be
[36:40] shen. No, I won't be moved.
[36:45] Oh my God is
[36:50] faithful. His promise is
[36:53] [Music]
[36:54] true. So I'll speak to the
[36:59] mountains cuz it's time to
[37:04] move. Oh my God is bigger, better,
[37:09] stronger. My God is bigger, better,
[37:14] stronger. My God is bigger, better. He's
[37:18] stronger. He's greater than
[37:23] you. Can you give the Lord another hand
[37:26] clap of praise? Amen. Do you believe him
[37:29] to be faithful this
[37:31] morning? Amen. Can we just stand to our
[37:35] feet as we invite our pastor to come? I
[37:38] pledge allegiance to the land.
[37:43] Oh, I
[37:45] pledge
[37:46] [Music]
[37:51] alle with all my
[37:55] strength. With all I am, I will
[38:01] seek to
[38:03] honor his command.
[38:08] Oh, I
[38:09] pledge
[38:11] alance
[38:15] to the
[38:18] lamb. Now I have heard how
[38:23] Christians
[38:24] long
[38:26] ago were brought
[38:30] before. Oh, a
[38:32] ty throne. They were told that he would
[38:39] spare their
[38:41] lives if they would
[38:45] renounce all the
[38:47] name of Christ. Oh, but one by one. Oh,
[38:54] they chose to
[38:56] die. for the son of God. They would not
[39:03] deny like a great
[39:08] angelic choir sings. Oh, I can almost
[39:14] hear. Oh, their
[39:17] voicees ring. Oh, I
[39:20] pledge
[39:22] allegiance to the lamb. Oh, with all my
[39:29] strength, with all I am, I will seek to
[39:37] honor his
[39:40] commands. Oh, I
[39:43] pledge
[39:45] alance
[39:48] to the lamb.
[39:53] Now the years have
[39:55] come and the years have gone. Oh, but
[40:00] the cause of
[40:03] Jesus still goes
[40:06] on. Now our time has come. Oh, to count
[40:12] the
[40:14] cost, to reject this
[40:17] world, to
[40:19] embrace the cross. And one by one, let
[40:26] us live our
[40:28] lives for the one who died. Oh, to give
[40:34] us life. Till the trumpet
[40:39] shouts on the final day. Oh, let us
[40:44] proudly stand. Oh, and
[40:49] boldly say, oh, I
[40:52] pledge
[40:54] alance to the
[40:57] lamb. With all my strength, oh with all
[41:03] I am, I will seek to
[41:09] honor his commands. Oh, I
[41:14] pledge
[41:16] allegiance
[41:19] to the lamb.
[41:23] Oh, I
[41:25] pledge
[41:27] alance to the
[41:30] [Music]
[41:35] land. All I am, I will seek to
[41:42] honor his command.
[41:46] I
[41:47] pledge
[41:50] alce
[41:53] to the
[41:56] lamb. Well, isn't he worth living for?
[42:00] I'm so glad that I've committed my life
[42:03] to him. And uh sometimes it's just good
[42:07] to renew our love, renew our commitment
[42:09] to the Lord. Amen. and uh pledge
[42:13] allegiance to him. I ain't pledging it
[42:15] to no pope, no president, no government,
[42:20] no world. Amen. I want to pledge it all
[42:23] to God. Amen. And I tell you what,
[42:26] there's uh benefits in serving the Lord.
[42:30] Amen. And uh I love the Lord. Amen. And
[42:35] uh glad to be a Christian in this age.
[42:38] Glad to be a believer. believe in the
[42:41] the message that God has sent to us and
[42:44] to know to know uh we just been given
[42:48] insight you know uh a lot of things that
[42:51] brother Brandham talked about you know
[42:54] was just starting in seed form just in a
[42:57] little bit here and there but we are
[42:59] seeing it
[43:01] full-blown and u every time you listen
[43:04] to the the message you can say ahuh I I
[43:08] understand that I I can see exactly
[43:10] what's going on now. And uh I just thank
[43:14] the Lord that we have light to walk in.
[43:16] Amen. And I love him. And uh well, we um
[43:22] uh just another opportunity to come to
[43:25] the house of the Lord and to worship
[43:28] him. We don't know how much longer, you
[43:30] know, many more days we've got. Amen.
[43:33] Uh, but I I do know the Lord is coming
[43:36] very soon, and I want to give him
[43:38] everything that I've got. I I uh I've
[43:43] said it before, but I don't want to get
[43:45] to heaven and and you talking to Paul
[43:49] and you're talking to all the martyrs
[43:50] and you're talking to those that gave
[43:52] their lives for this gospel and and I
[43:56] ain't got a testimony to give them. I
[43:59] ain't got nothing. just well I lived it
[44:02] pretty easy in life you know but uh uh I
[44:06] want to be counted with them that gave
[44:09] their all to God and if you have to
[44:13] suffer in doing it do it anyhow it's
[44:17] worth it all and we can all share the
[44:20] story of just how amazing God has been
[44:23] to us it's been his faithfulness it's
[44:25] been his
[44:26] grace it's just been God all along and
[44:30] and I'm so glad for that. Amen. And uh,
[44:34] Brother Christian, it's really good to
[44:36] see you this morning and been praying
[44:38] for you and certainly love and
[44:41] appreciate you and your family uh, very
[44:44] much. And u uh, we're glad to have
[44:47] brother Josh, sister Loretta with us
[44:50] today and and uh, looking forward to
[44:54] what the Lord has given him and uh, to
[44:58] share with us. And so we want him just
[45:01] to take his time and to preach and we're
[45:03] going to pull on the gift. Amen. Our our
[45:06] meeting's coming up uh starting
[45:08] Wednesday night. And uh so I I uh I pray
[45:13] that you've been praying for the meeting
[45:15] and uh just looking forward to what God
[45:19] is going to do. Amen. For the lives of
[45:21] the people. Amen. But today's day and uh
[45:26] we just want God just to move in a
[45:28] special way. I just driving to the
[45:31] service this morning and you know a
[45:34] little tired and and of course just a
[45:36] lot of things going on and so my mind
[45:38] was just kind of wandering. I thought no
[45:41] I just started praying said God I just
[45:43] need you today. I I don't want it just
[45:45] to be just a normal day today and normal
[45:48] service. I I want you to speak to my
[45:51] heart and I just need renewing. And I
[45:54] think all of us could say that and just
[45:57] speak to us. Do something great today.
[45:59] And I know God is willing to do it. And
[46:02] if we are willing just to let him, let
[46:05] him do it. Can you say amen? And so if
[46:09] you have a need this morning, I know God
[46:11] can meet your need. And I promise you,
[46:14] he will do it. If you just get all the
[46:17] doubts, get all the unbeliefs and don't
[46:20] let your mind wander and just focus upon
[46:23] the word of God and amen it, believe it,
[46:26] and watch God just anoint his servant.
[46:29] Amen. And speak to us today. Amen. And
[46:32] uh maybe we could just kind of switch
[46:34] that song uh and and sing, I need thee.
[46:38] Oh, I need thee. Amen. Oh, I
[46:42] need thee.
[46:46] Oh, I need
[46:52] thee
[46:55] every
[46:58] hour, every second of the day. We need
[47:02] him. Oh,
[47:06] bless me
[47:09] now, my savior.
[47:14] I
[47:17] come
[47:20] to
[47:21] thee. Sing it as a prayer. Oh, I
[47:27] need thee.
[47:31] Oh, God. Touch your people this morning.
[47:36] [Music]
[47:39] Every
[47:41] hour I need
[47:44] thee. Oh
[47:47] yes.
[47:49] Bless me
[47:52] now. God bless
[47:54] [Music]
[47:57] you. I
[48:00] come
[48:03] to thee. Can we sing that one more time?
[48:06] [Music]
[48:08] I
[48:11] need thee.
[48:13] Oh, I need
[48:16] [Music]
[48:19] thee.
[48:22] Every
[48:24] hour I need
[48:30] thee.
[48:35] Bless my
[48:37] savior, my
[48:40] savior. I
[48:43] come
[48:46] to
[48:49] thee. I'm crying.
[48:55] Save
[48:57] your oh.
[49:01] Save
[49:03] [Music]
[49:06] a. Yes,
[49:07] Lord. My
[49:11] humble cry.
[49:18] Oh
[49:21] wow. On
[49:23] others thou art
[49:32] calling. Oh,
[49:35] do not
[49:37] pass
[49:39] me
[49:43] by. Amen. And I trust that your desire
[49:46] this morning was, "Lord, I have a need.
[49:49] I have a desire. Lord, don't pass me
[49:51] by." It was the woman with the issue of
[49:54] blood. As Jesus was going to uh uh to
[49:58] another destination, going to go speak
[50:00] to somebody else and bring forth a
[50:02] miracle for somebody else. But that lady
[50:04] seized her time, seized her opportunity,
[50:07] and said, "Lord, don't pass me by. No
[50:10] matter how impossible the situation may
[50:12] look, Lord, I'm seizing my opportunity.
[50:15] And I know every one of us has a desire
[50:17] and a need. We need the Lord to speak
[50:19] to. And I believe he can speak to that
[50:21] need this morning. Amen. You happy to be
[50:24] in the house of the Lord? Amen. If you
[50:26] would have your Bibles, let's open our
[50:28] scriptures. I have a few different
[50:31] places I would like to read. Ephesians 2
[50:34] and 4 and through the sixth
[50:37] verse. Then Ephesians 1:3, then 2
[50:41] Corinthians
[50:43] 10:4. I'd like to say it is an honor to
[50:45] be here this morning to be ministering.
[50:48] Appreciate the opportunity by your
[50:49] pastor to minister. I pray something can
[50:52] be said to be a blessing and to edify in
[50:54] some way. Good to have my family with
[50:56] me, uh, Loretta and the kiddos, Ethan
[50:58] and Belle. They're troopers. They travel
[51:02] almost everywhere I go. So, it's it's
[51:03] good to have them with with me this
[51:05] morning. But Ephesians
[51:08] 2:4, the Bible would say, "But God, who
[51:10] is rich in mercy, for his great love
[51:13] wherewith he loved us, even when we were
[51:16] dead in sins, hath quickened us together
[51:18] with Christ. By grace ye are saved, and
[51:22] hath raised us up together, and made us
[51:24] sit together in heavenly places in
[51:27] Christ Jesus." In Ephesians 1
[51:33] and3, blessed be the God and father of
[51:36] our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed
[51:38] us with all spiritual blessings in
[51:41] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And one
[51:45] more place in 2 Corinthians
[51:48] 10:4. Amen. You love the reading of the
[51:51] word.
[51:53] 2 Corinthians 10 and4.
[51:58] For the weapons of our warfare are not
[52:00] carnal, but mighty through God to the
[52:03] pulling down of strongholds, casting
[52:05] down imaginations, and every high fang
[52:08] that exalteth itself against the
[52:11] knowledge of God, and bringing into
[52:13] captivity every thought to the obedience
[52:17] of Christ. Amen. Can we bow our heads
[52:19] this morning? Dear gracious heavenly
[52:21] father, Lord, what an honor it is to
[52:23] come into your house one more time,
[52:25] Lord. God, no doubt there's needs and
[52:28] and and desires here that only you can
[52:30] touch and meet, Lord. God, we ask that
[52:33] you would just speak this morning, Lord.
[52:35] Move myself aside, Lord, and just speak
[52:37] to the hearts. God, as the word would
[52:39] come forth, may there be a heart to
[52:41] receive it, Lord. God, we commit this
[52:43] part of the service into your hands. We
[52:45] just ask that you would have your way
[52:47] this morning in Jesus Christ's name.
[52:50] Amen. You may be seated this morning.
[52:55] I just have a simple thought, some
[52:57] things I've been studying on. So I I
[52:59] hope it can all just make sense this
[53:01] morning. But my title would be subject
[53:03] to the heavenlies. And brother Brandham
[53:05] would read Ephesians 1 and would say,
[53:08] "Who has blessed us with all spiritual
[53:10] blessings?" He says, "Whereabouts?" In
[53:13] heavenly places in Christ. He says,
[53:15] "Heavenly places." Oh, how I wish I had
[53:18] time. Here I've got them marked right
[53:20] here in my Bible about heavenly places.
[53:22] What is heavenly places? Heavenly
[53:24] places, just for a moment, is the
[53:27] believer's position in Christ. See,
[53:30] where the believer stands in Christ is
[53:33] heavenly places. And I believe that this
[53:36] place is something that has been given
[53:37] to the bride. And brother Brandham would
[53:39] tell us that this is not addressed to
[53:42] the outsider, to the to the world, not
[53:44] to the not just to anybody, but it's
[53:47] addressed to the church that is in
[53:49] Christ Jesus. And I like how brother
[53:51] Brandham is is making the separation not
[53:54] just the church or a church but the
[53:56] church that is in Christ Jesus. And I
[53:59] believe that in this position is that
[54:02] spiritual blessings of God. Not
[54:04] necessarily blessings. We're thankful
[54:06] for the blessings of God, you know, but
[54:09] sometimes we we mistake blessings for
[54:11] spiritual blessings. And if we don't see
[54:14] the blessings of God like like a nice
[54:16] car or a nice house, money in the bank,
[54:18] we don't think that the spiritual
[54:20] blessings are still there. You know, uh,
[54:22] Brother Daniel's been to Nicaragua, but
[54:24] I I was in Nicaragua back there back in
[54:26] January. And a lot of the places we was
[54:28] at didn't have electricity, you know.
[54:31] Uh, they're very poor, live in huts.
[54:33] I've seen one family of three come to
[54:35] church upon a motorcycle, you know, and
[54:38] if they don't got a car, does that not
[54:40] mean does that mean they don't have
[54:41] spiritual blessings? You know, and so
[54:43] it's not the corporal thing and natural
[54:45] things that we look at that that that
[54:47] that we can say we got the spiritual
[54:49] blessings. But brother Brandon would
[54:51] tell us that spiritual blessings is many
[54:53] things, but he points out revelation.
[54:56] And I'm so thankful that even when we
[54:58] don't have much money in the bank, don't
[55:00] have maybe a nice car or a nice house,
[55:02] we still have revelation. And that is
[55:05] one thing the devil can never take away
[55:07] from us. And brother Brandham would
[55:09] preach a message called God's provided
[55:11] place of worship and would say the
[55:14] provided place that God has is going to
[55:16] have his name. Not just any name because
[55:19] Jesus would tell the discip the
[55:21] Pharisees in vain do you worship me. And
[55:23] brother Brandham would would say that it
[55:26] was because they were teaching doctrine
[55:28] uh to the people, the tradition of men
[55:31] for doctrine. And now they were taking
[55:33] the word of God and making it of none
[55:36] effect. So even though they was
[55:38] worshiping it, brother Brandham says
[55:39] they were sincere from the heart, but
[55:42] because they was under a name of a
[55:44] tradition, the the the the power of the
[55:47] word was not fair. But where the
[55:49] provider place of worship is going to be
[55:52] is in the name of Jesus Christ. And I'm
[55:55] so thankful that we would have a message
[55:58] in this generation that would bring us
[56:00] back to Christ that we can see the
[56:02] spiritual blessings of God. That even
[56:04] when I'm sick in my body, I can believe
[56:07] that God is still a healer. And the word
[56:10] of God is in effect today. It can still
[56:12] heal. It can still deliver. He can still
[56:15] baptize with the Holy Ghost. But Jesus
[56:18] would say, "I come in my father's name,
[56:21] and they that worship must worship in
[56:23] spirit and in truth." And that would do
[56:26] away with the denominational name tag
[56:29] and would put the provided place in
[56:31] Christ. And brother Brandham would say,
[56:34] "And the name is the word is in the word
[56:37] because he is the word." Amen. What is
[56:39] he then? The word interpreted is the
[56:42] manifestation of the name of God. No
[56:45] wonder flesh and blood has not revealed
[56:47] this to you. But my father which is in
[56:50] heaven has revealed it to you who I am.
[56:53] And upon this rock I will build my place
[56:55] of worship and the gates of hell cannot
[56:58] shake it down. Amen. Oh the church of
[57:01] the living God. Stand in firm on the
[57:04] foundation of Jesus Christ alone. And
[57:07] I'm so thankful that even when we're
[57:09] living in a time of shaking, we're
[57:11] living in a day of gross darkness,
[57:13] there's a position that the bride can
[57:16] stand upon in its fur, even when the the
[57:19] world's falling apart, nation against
[57:21] nation, the bride is in a safe place in
[57:24] Christ Jesus. And the Bible would tell
[57:27] us that there's going to be gross
[57:28] darkness in Isaiah 60 and2. For behold,
[57:32] the darkness shall cover the earth and
[57:33] gross darkness the people. But the Lord
[57:36] shall arise upon thee, and his glory
[57:39] shall be seen upon thee. A and I believe
[57:43] that it's talking about two different
[57:45] classes of people. Gross darkness ain't
[57:47] just coming all upon the earth, but it's
[57:50] coming against the earth. It's coming
[57:52] against individuals that is upon the
[57:54] earth. But at the same time, the glory
[57:56] of the Lord ain't just rising upon the
[57:59] earth, but it's coming inside earth and
[58:01] vessels. though in gross darkness and
[58:03] brother Brandham would tell us the gross
[58:05] darkness is spirits. He says it's
[58:08] perversions that that man wants to look
[58:10] like women and women wants to look like
[58:12] man. He says what is it? It's gross
[58:14] darkness over the people. In another
[58:17] place he would say that the people has
[58:19] become such subject to evil that the
[58:22] darkness is overshadowing them and the
[58:25] darkness is pressing against them. And I
[58:28] believe the darkness is also pressing
[58:30] against us. But the reason we're not
[58:32] falling subject to it is we're subject
[58:35] to another. The word of God has become
[58:38] our life that whenever darkness does
[58:40] come against homes comes against
[58:42] marriages. We we we can look at America
[58:45] today that marriages are falling in
[58:47] divorce. That we got teenagers that that
[58:49] can't help but go in drugs and in
[58:51] alcohol. They're falling subject to evil
[58:54] because gross darkness spirits are
[58:57] pressing against him. But I don't
[58:59] believe we have to fall subject to Oh,
[59:02] hallelujah. We're among darkness, but we
[59:04] don't got to be a part of the darkness.
[59:06] We've been called out by your word. And
[59:09] and I believe that it's demons that that
[59:11] you can't see, but it's spirits in
[59:14] another dimension. And that's why our
[59:16] our weaponry is not of this dimension,
[59:19] but another dimension. It's mighty
[59:21] pulling down the strongholds. And and
[59:24] this darkness wants to put you in an
[59:26] atmosphere of gloom. put you in an
[59:28] atmosphere of of unbelief and
[59:31] discouragement. But the spirit of the
[59:33] Lord will raise up a standard when the
[59:35] enemy comes in like a flood. And I
[59:38] believe that there's been a separation
[59:40] between the bride and between the
[59:42] church. Brother Brandham would tell us
[59:44] that that the devil is calling a church,
[59:47] but God is calling a bride. And I'm so
[59:50] thankful that whenever the church is
[59:52] falling into the world council of
[59:54] churches, there's a bride that is coming
[59:56] under the glory of the Lord. And we can
[59:59] look there in Exodus 8:22. The Bible
[1:00:02] would say, "And I will sever in that day
[1:00:04] the land of Gan in which my people dwell
[1:00:07] that no swarms of flies shall be there
[1:00:10] till the end thou mayest know that I am
[1:00:12] the Lord in the midst of the earth. and
[1:00:15] I will put a division between my people
[1:00:18] and thy people. And I love it because
[1:00:20] it's a prophet that is standing in the
[1:00:22] gap between judgment and between God's
[1:00:25] people and would stand up to Pharaoh and
[1:00:28] would say there's going to be a
[1:00:29] division. And the word sever means to be
[1:00:32] separated, to set apart. And so hear it
[1:00:35] here. Here here's Moses standing against
[1:00:37] Pharaoh. And we see I'm going to set
[1:00:39] apart in the land of Goan that when the
[1:00:42] flies does come, when the plagues come,
[1:00:45] there's going to be a division between
[1:00:48] my people and thy people. And you know
[1:00:51] that Goan was still in Egypt, but it was
[1:00:53] a separated place. Oh man, here we are.
[1:00:56] We're we're living in Leodosa, but
[1:00:59] there's been a bride age that God has
[1:01:01] separated us and set us apart. that when
[1:01:04] gross darkness comes against Lego to see
[1:01:07] we've been called out into a bright age,
[1:01:10] a bright anointing, that when gross
[1:01:12] darkness comes against our home, it
[1:01:14] cannot come. Oh, hallelujah. When it
[1:01:17] comes against your minds, you don't got
[1:01:19] to fall subject to it. Brother Brandham
[1:01:21] would talk about the u the death angel
[1:01:24] whenever it was coming through the land
[1:01:25] of Egypt. Brother Brandham says that
[1:01:27] death angel could strike any place. He
[1:01:29] could strike the priests.
[1:01:31] It could strike the the castles and it
[1:01:33] could even strike the Israelites, but
[1:01:36] there was a place that it could not
[1:01:38] strike. Then brother Brown would clarify
[1:01:40] himself. He would say it's not a home,
[1:01:42] but it's a place. Oh, hallelujah. And he
[1:01:45] says that place was where the blood of
[1:01:48] the lamb was. And he says that place
[1:01:50] that the death angel could not come
[1:01:52] into. And then he would say so it is
[1:01:54] today. There's a place that the gross
[1:01:57] darkness, the death angel cannot come
[1:01:59] into. not a church, but a place. And I'm
[1:02:03] so thankful that you might be here in
[1:02:04] Virginia. I'm in Oklahoma, but we're
[1:02:07] under the same place. We've been called
[1:02:09] out into the same position into heavenly
[1:02:13] places. Oh, hallelujah. Brother
[1:02:15] Brandham, he he would say this here.
[1:02:17] Notice it. It was the only place death
[1:02:19] could not strike. When death was about
[1:02:21] to strike the land, there had to be a
[1:02:23] certain place. All from under this died.
[1:02:26] Only one place. Now it didn't mean it
[1:02:29] was one house but there was one place
[1:02:32] and that was where the lamb was killed
[1:02:34] and where the blood was the death angel
[1:02:36] could not strike. And now the same thing
[1:02:39] is today. There was only one place the
[1:02:42] spiritual death cannot strike. That is
[1:02:44] the word. Death cannot strike the word
[1:02:47] because it's the living word of the
[1:02:49] living God. Oh man, I'm so thankful.
[1:02:52] Revelations would say, "And I heard
[1:02:54] another voice from heaven, saying, "Come
[1:02:55] out of her, my people, and be not
[1:02:58] partakers of her sins, that you receive
[1:03:00] not of her plagues." So the plagues are
[1:03:03] falling in Leodysia. But we heard a
[1:03:06] voice. We heard a message saying, "Come
[1:03:09] out of her, my people, my people, and be
[1:03:11] not partakers or be subject to those
[1:03:15] things." Oh my brother Brandon M would
[1:03:17] tell us he would say I don't want to
[1:03:18] hurt your feelings but I'm responsible
[1:03:21] for a message and that message is to
[1:03:24] come out of that mess. And I love it
[1:03:26] because then he would say now you may
[1:03:28] ask me where am I going to take you to?
[1:03:30] He says I'm not just going to take you
[1:03:32] out of some place then I'll put you
[1:03:34] somewhere. He says where am I going to
[1:03:36] take you? Is it the Brandham tabernacle?
[1:03:38] He says no I'm not taking you to the
[1:03:40] Brandham tabernacle because they got
[1:03:42] faults too. But I'm taking you to a
[1:03:44] place Jesus Christ and that is the word.
[1:03:47] Oh, he did not bring us to a tradition
[1:03:50] or bring us to a a pastor or bring us to
[1:03:52] a church, but he brought us to the
[1:03:54] living word that we can become subject
[1:03:57] to. And the same works that Christ done,
[1:04:00] we can also do in every one of our
[1:04:02] lives. Not just for the preacher but for
[1:04:04] the leoty. Not just for mamas but for
[1:04:07] young people can can defy the spirits of
[1:04:10] leotardia and produce the greater works.
[1:04:14] Oh hallelujah. Brother Brandon would say
[1:04:16] pass from death and creed into a living
[1:04:19] word of the living God. God's only
[1:04:21] provided plan for his age. His sons in
[1:04:25] the word age quickened by the spirit
[1:04:27] like a spark that is lit off of
[1:04:30] something to make it alive. seated now
[1:04:33] in heavenly places. And so he links the
[1:04:36] word age to heavenly places. And he says
[1:04:39] in past tense already alive and subject
[1:04:42] to every promise in the word of God. So
[1:04:46] once we get in this position of heavenly
[1:04:48] places, then our lives will fall
[1:04:51] obedient to the word of God. So, it's no
[1:04:53] longer we're bucking the system or or
[1:04:56] arguing with this part of the scripture,
[1:04:58] arguing with the with this part of the
[1:04:59] message. But once we're in this
[1:05:01] position, we fall subject to the word of
[1:05:05] God. And I believe that the the reason
[1:05:07] there had to be a separation between the
[1:05:10] bride and the church because the Bible
[1:05:12] would tell us that in Genesis and God
[1:05:14] saw the light and that it was good and
[1:05:16] God divided the light from the darkness.
[1:05:19] So wherever the light is coming,
[1:05:21] darkness is not welcome. So whenever the
[1:05:24] word begin to come over the earth, it
[1:05:27] separated the darkness from the light.
[1:05:29] It separated the bride from the church,
[1:05:32] the weak and fall subject to the the the
[1:05:35] living word. And brother Brandon would
[1:05:37] preach a message called shalom and would
[1:05:40] say the reason I say shalom is because
[1:05:43] it means God's peace. He says we're not
[1:05:45] looking back. He says, "We're looking
[1:05:47] forward to the breaking of a brand new
[1:05:50] day." So, we're not looking at a revival
[1:05:52] of yesterday. We're looking at a revival
[1:05:55] of today. Cuz the revival of yesterday
[1:05:58] cannot bring a peace in the middle of
[1:06:00] the storm. The revival of yesterday
[1:06:02] cannot bring joy in the middle of
[1:06:04] sorrow. But a revival of today is a
[1:06:07] breaking of a brand new day. that if you
[1:06:10] were discouraged tomorrow, you can step
[1:06:12] into a brand new day and feel the
[1:06:14] encouragement of almighty God. Oh,
[1:06:17] hallelujah. And I believe this meeting
[1:06:19] that is coming up this next week is a
[1:06:21] bra a brand new day for every one of us
[1:06:23] that if you're discouraged this morning
[1:06:25] and and you're you're beat down by the
[1:06:27] things of of life and of the world, you
[1:06:30] can step into a brand new day and walk
[1:06:32] out of these meetings with your joy,
[1:06:34] with your peace, with your happiness,
[1:06:36] with the refilling of the Holy Ghost. If
[1:06:38] you need healing for your body, step
[1:06:40] into it. If you need deliverance for
[1:06:43] your loved ones, step into it. If you
[1:06:45] need a renewing of the Holy Ghost, I say
[1:06:48] step into it. It's a revival of today,
[1:06:51] not of yesterday. Oh, hallelujah. Jesus
[1:06:54] Christ is still the same yesterday,
[1:06:56] today, and forever.
[1:06:59] Oh my. While the world is living in
[1:07:01] gross darkness where we've been called
[1:07:03] out, there's a calling out for the
[1:07:05] bride. and not just a calling out but a
[1:07:08] placing. And I believe this message has
[1:07:10] placed us into our inheritance and to
[1:07:12] our adoption where we are sitting in
[1:07:15] heavenly places and our souls is in
[1:07:18] heavenly places. So while our body is
[1:07:20] still fighting this earthly dimension,
[1:07:23] our soul is sitting in heavenly places.
[1:07:26] Brother Brandon would say, "Oh, let's
[1:07:28] just stop here just one more minute. In
[1:07:30] heavenly places now, not just out
[1:07:32] anywhere, but in heavenly places." We
[1:07:35] are assembled in the heavenly. It means
[1:07:37] that that is the position of the
[1:07:39] believer that if I'm prayed up, you're
[1:07:41] prayed up or the church is prayed up.
[1:07:43] We're ready for the message. And we have
[1:07:45] assembled ourselves together as saints.
[1:07:48] The called out, baptized with the Holy
[1:07:50] Ghost, filled with God's blessings, the
[1:07:52] called, the elected, set together in
[1:07:54] heavenly places. We are now heavenlies
[1:07:57] in our souls. Brother, there you are. A
[1:08:00] heavenly atmosphere. Oh, what could
[1:08:03] happen tonight? Oh my. We are heavenlies
[1:08:06] in our souls. And so, while we still
[1:08:08] have mind battles, while our body still
[1:08:10] has aches and pains, that soul has been
[1:08:13] sealed to the day of your redemption.
[1:08:15] The devil can plague your mind. He can
[1:08:17] plague your body, but he can never touch
[1:08:20] that soul. Oh my. And and I love how
[1:08:23] brother Brandham, he would put heavenly
[1:08:25] places is a heavenly atmosphere cuz many
[1:08:28] times we we don't we don't uh see the
[1:08:30] importance of atmosphere cuz brother
[1:08:32] Brandham would tell us that we're
[1:08:34] miniature creators, right? He would say
[1:08:36] you can create the atmosphere around
[1:08:38] you. He says there's some people that
[1:08:40] you don't like to be around. He says how
[1:08:42] come it's the atmosphere they're
[1:08:44] creating. He says then there's other
[1:08:46] people that you when you when you come
[1:08:47] in contact with them you pick up like
[1:08:50] like you never left each other. He says,
[1:08:52] "What is it?" It's the atmosphere
[1:08:54] they're creating. And I think sometimes
[1:08:56] it's the atmosphere that we create that
[1:08:59] sometimes pulls us out of the
[1:09:01] heavenlies. Oh, come on now. Cuz brother
[1:09:03] Brandon would tell us uh the the things
[1:09:06] you read on creates an atmosphere. He
[1:09:09] says the things you talk about creates
[1:09:11] an atmosphere. And that atmosphere can
[1:09:13] either lift you up or pull you down. You
[1:09:16] remember the two that walked on the road
[1:09:17] to Emmas. The Bible says they were
[1:09:19] talking about about the crucifixion and
[1:09:21] how they thought Jesus was the Messiah.
[1:09:24] And then the Bible tells us that Jesus
[1:09:26] himself drew near. And I love that,
[1:09:28] Uncle Sean. I never seen that before.
[1:09:30] That Jesus himself, it reminds me that
[1:09:33] that that the Lord himself showed his
[1:09:35] hand, you know. So here comes Jesus.
[1:09:37] He's walking among them. And he would
[1:09:39] ask him, "What are y'all talking about?
[1:09:41] And what manner of communications are
[1:09:44] these that makes you sad?" So the very
[1:09:47] things they were talking about was
[1:09:49] bringing on a heaviness over their
[1:09:51] spirits. Oh, come on. And sometimes we
[1:09:54] can do that. We can talk about the
[1:09:55] gloom. We can talk about the mistakes.
[1:09:57] We can talk about the troubles in the
[1:09:59] church. And that creates an atmosphere
[1:10:01] that we fail to recognize that Christ is
[1:10:04] in our midst. Oh, come on. I don't want
[1:10:07] to come to church. and the living word
[1:10:09] is coming across the pullpit, but my
[1:10:11] communication has created an atmosphere
[1:10:14] where I fail to recognize that Jesus is
[1:10:17] walking the aisles. Let me tell you
[1:10:19] this. Christ is still here in the power
[1:10:21] of his resurrection. He's here to meet
[1:10:24] your need. He's here to set you free.
[1:10:26] But change the atmosphere around you
[1:10:28] that you can recognize that he is in
[1:10:31] your midst. Oh, but Christ did not leave
[1:10:33] them there in that condition. The Bible
[1:10:36] says he rebuked them, right? He all
[1:10:38] fools and slow of heart to believe. And
[1:10:40] you brother Brown tell us that he took
[1:10:43] the scripture and went from the
[1:10:44] beginning all the way through the Bible
[1:10:47] speaking of himself. And yet they still
[1:10:49] could not see him. But then he broke the
[1:10:52] bread. And what would happen once he
[1:10:54] broke the bread? Then their eyes was
[1:10:56] open that they could see him. And what
[1:10:58] was the brick of the the the broken
[1:11:01] bread? It's the living bread. The
[1:11:03] brother Brandon must say, "What is that
[1:11:04] shout that that angel came down with?"
[1:11:07] He says, "That is the living word, the
[1:11:09] broken bread." So that broken bread that
[1:11:11] we've got in this generation has the
[1:11:14] authority to change the atmosphere. The
[1:11:17] negativity that you're dwelling in, the
[1:11:20] negativity that your family is dwelling
[1:11:22] in, your home is dwelling in. There's a
[1:11:24] living bread that has been broken in
[1:11:27] this generation that your eyes can be
[1:11:29] open to see. He is still Jehovah Gyra.
[1:11:32] He's still my provider. He's still my
[1:11:34] healer. He's still my savior. He's still
[1:11:37] my my sustainer. Oh my. We need to
[1:11:40] change the atmosphere so we can see
[1:11:42] there's a living God among
[1:11:45] us. Hallelujah. So that we can step up
[1:11:48] into heavenly places. I don't want the
[1:11:50] atmosphere that I'm creating to pull me
[1:11:53] out of those heights. Come on now. I
[1:11:55] want to live in those heights every day
[1:11:57] of my life. Not just on a on a Wednesday
[1:11:59] or a Sunday. I want to live on those
[1:12:01] heights. When it's midnight and the
[1:12:03] devil's bombarding my mind, I still want
[1:12:06] to be in those heights. When the devil
[1:12:07] comes against my children, I still want
[1:12:10] to be in those heights. When the devil
[1:12:12] comes against my marriage, against the
[1:12:14] church, I still want to live in those
[1:12:17] heights.
[1:12:18] Oh, I don't believe the devil has enough
[1:12:20] to pull you out of those heights unless
[1:12:23] you allow it. That's right. Oh,
[1:12:25] hallelujah. You see, brother Brandham
[1:12:28] would tell us that we've got the power
[1:12:30] to speak a world into existence and go
[1:12:32] and live upon it. He says, "But the
[1:12:34] problem of it is," he says it's
[1:12:36] controlled by the law of faith. And he
[1:12:38] says, "We don't got the faith to believe
[1:12:40] that." But I do believe we can speak a a
[1:12:43] spiritual world into existence and go
[1:12:46] and live in go live in that place.
[1:12:47] Brother Brown would tell us that the
[1:12:49] church or a man can live so close to God
[1:12:52] that the devil does not know what to do
[1:12:54] with him. What is it? You've created
[1:12:56] another atmosphere. Oh my. The things
[1:12:59] you read upon creates an atmosphere.
[1:13:02] What ought to happen? Once we start
[1:13:03] feeding upon the message of the hour,
[1:13:05] start listening to the tapes. It's
[1:13:07] changing that atmosphere that when the
[1:13:09] devil does come against you, he can
[1:13:12] never touch you. Oh, because there's
[1:13:14] many things in this other atmosphere.
[1:13:16] Spiritual blessings are in this
[1:13:18] atmosphere. And brother Brandon would
[1:13:20] tell us that that if you can believe it,
[1:13:22] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:13:25] believe, that is yours, not your
[1:13:27] emotions. Cuz your emotions can go up
[1:13:29] and down. Not your sensations because
[1:13:32] sometimes you don't feel God, but that
[1:13:34] soul, which is the real you. Whatever
[1:13:37] God leads that soul to believe, that is
[1:13:40] yours. So what is in this other
[1:13:42] dimension? And brother Brandham would
[1:13:43] tell us that that he he would be in a
[1:13:45] prayer line and there was a lady that
[1:13:47] would come close in that prayer line and
[1:13:49] she would start to cry and brother
[1:13:51] Brandham says she she she she can feel
[1:13:53] this but in this heavenly atmosphere
[1:13:56] that the the angel of the Lord is
[1:13:58] standing right here. She could not see
[1:14:00] it could not declare she noticed
[1:14:02] something was different about him. You
[1:14:04] see I don't want to notice something
[1:14:06] that's different about this word. I want
[1:14:08] to see what it is. You see, she was she
[1:14:10] was she was limited to her five senses,
[1:14:13] but there was a prophet that could live
[1:14:15] in that other dimension and could
[1:14:17] declare to her what is in her very
[1:14:20] presence. In another place, brother
[1:14:22] Brandon would say in this heavenly
[1:14:24] atmosphere, the angels of the Lord are
[1:14:26] mingling near even though we could not
[1:14:29] see them, they were still there, but in
[1:14:31] a heavenly atmosphere. But that was not
[1:14:34] just for the prophet because brother
[1:14:35] Brandham lived in that dimension. for
[1:14:37] the brand of Matelis. He would have to
[1:14:38] pinch himself many times to see if he
[1:14:40] was in a vision or if he was here. He
[1:14:43] was built to live in that dimension. But
[1:14:45] you were not or dictated by your five
[1:14:48] senses. But there's another sense.
[1:14:50] There's a six sense. And brother
[1:14:52] Brandham would tell us that faith, it
[1:14:54] rescues you from your five senses. Oh,
[1:14:57] come on. We're trium being, right? We're
[1:14:59] body, we're spirit, and we're soul. Our
[1:15:02] body has the five senses. Our soul. Our
[1:15:04] spirit has the five senses. But then
[1:15:06] that soul has two senses. Faith and its
[1:15:08] doubt. And brother Brandham says that
[1:15:10] faith rescues you from those five
[1:15:12] senses. So when your affection is being
[1:15:15] pressed against by gross darkness, then
[1:15:18] there's the soul. Faith rises up and
[1:15:21] says, "Not today." Brother Brandham, he
[1:15:23] he would tell us that whenever by faith
[1:15:25] you catch the word of God, it sends you
[1:15:28] into another dimension that makes it so
[1:15:31] real to you. Oh my. So even whenever
[1:15:34] your eyes cannot see that there's angels
[1:15:36] mingling here, your faith from that soul
[1:15:39] which is in
[1:15:41] heavenlies brings to you that there are
[1:15:43] angels here. Oh, whenever you feel like
[1:15:46] you're walking through the valley of the
[1:15:48] shadow of death, you fear no evil
[1:15:51] because that soul says the mighty angel
[1:15:53] is walking with me. Oh, come on now.
[1:15:56] Whenever you're in the lion's den, when
[1:15:57] you're in discouragement, then that soul
[1:16:00] lets you know even when your five senses
[1:16:03] does not declare it that the mighty
[1:16:05] angel, the angel of the Lord is walking
[1:16:07] with you.
[1:16:09] Hallelujah. The angels of God are
[1:16:12] mingling near. And brother Brown and I
[1:16:14] got this from Uncle Sean. Brother Brown
[1:16:16] would would talk about Elisha and
[1:16:18] whenever Gahesa would come to him and
[1:16:21] would say, "We're surrounded by the
[1:16:22] army." and and Elisha would say there's
[1:16:24] more with us than with him. And brother
[1:16:27] Brandon would say that Elisha might not
[1:16:29] have even seen those angels there, but
[1:16:32] he believed it because the word said
[1:16:35] they was there. Oh, come on. Sometimes
[1:16:38] we make it so spiritual. Oh, he's seen
[1:16:40] the angels of the Lord there. That's the
[1:16:42] reason why he believed him. It was all
[1:16:44] by faith that there's more with us than
[1:16:47] with him. And what would that faith do?
[1:16:49] It would open up the spiritual eyesight
[1:16:52] of that other land that he could see
[1:16:54] with that same faith. Oh, come on. It
[1:16:57] was a prophet that wasn't willing to let
[1:17:00] that boy go through confusion, but he
[1:17:03] would allow that boy or God would allow
[1:17:05] that boy his spiritual eyes to be open
[1:17:09] that he could see the same things. And
[1:17:12] we had a prophet that could look in that
[1:17:13] other dimension. But God has opened our
[1:17:16] spiritual eyes that we can look into the
[1:17:19] heavenlies and see the promises of God
[1:17:22] or yay and amen. Even when I don't feel
[1:17:25] it, even when I don't look like I can
[1:17:27] make it through it, the promises of God
[1:17:29] are still yay and amen. And my faith is
[1:17:33] declaring it.
[1:17:35] Hallelujah. My soul is declaring that
[1:17:38] they are there even when I don't see
[1:17:40] them. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham would
[1:17:43] say, "Blessing us with what? Divine
[1:17:45] healing for knowledge, revelation,
[1:17:47] visions, powers, tongues,
[1:17:50] interpretations, wisdom, fornowledge,
[1:17:52] all the heavenly blessings, joy,
[1:17:54] unspeakable and full of glory. Every
[1:17:57] heart filled with the spirit walking
[1:17:59] together, sitting together in heavenly
[1:18:02] places. Not one evil thought among us.
[1:18:04] Not one cigarette smoke. Not one short
[1:18:06] dress. Not one this, that, or the other.
[1:18:09] Not one evil thought. Nobody got
[1:18:12] anything against one another. Everybody
[1:18:14] speaking in love and harmony. Everybody
[1:18:16] with one accord in one place. And he
[1:18:19] says, "There you are has blessed us with
[1:18:22] all spiritual blessings." He didn't
[1:18:25] mention anything about a nice car. He
[1:18:28] didn't mention anything about a nice
[1:18:30] bank account. But he did say divine
[1:18:32] healing. He did say fornowledge. Oh, he
[1:18:34] did say revelation. Why would Jesus tell
[1:18:37] the disciples, "Rejoice not that the
[1:18:39] spirits are subject to you, but rejoice
[1:18:42] that your name is written in heaven." In
[1:18:45] a little church, you might not got a lot
[1:18:46] of money, but you can still rejoice. Cuz
[1:18:49] there's nothing the devil can do to take
[1:18:51] your name off of the lamb's book of
[1:18:54] life. There's a spiritual blessing
[1:18:56] called a revelation that once you get
[1:18:58] into the spiritual heights, you can see
[1:19:01] it for yourself. It's not good enough
[1:19:03] just for the preacher to see it, but
[1:19:05] you've got to see it. It's not good
[1:19:07] enough just for mama to see it. You've
[1:19:09] got to see it that my name is written on
[1:19:12] the lamb's book of life. I think it's
[1:19:15] time we get into the spirit and get
[1:19:17] transported into the Lord's day. Brother
[1:19:19] Brandon would tell us that John would
[1:19:21] get into the spirit and was transported
[1:19:24] into the Lord's day. And then he heard a
[1:19:26] voice saying, "I am Alpha and the Omega,
[1:19:29] the beginning the end." What was it?
[1:19:31] Once he got into the spirit, got into a
[1:19:34] heavenly atmosphere, he be to see who
[1:19:37] God really was, that he is the alpha and
[1:19:40] the omega. And brother Brandham says,
[1:19:42] once you get into the spirit, you'll
[1:19:44] start to go see things. You'll begin to
[1:19:47] see things just like John saw it. What
[1:19:50] did John see? That he is the alpha and
[1:19:52] the omega. But what can you see? He you
[1:19:55] can still see that he's the prince of
[1:19:57] peace. He's still the friend that
[1:19:59] stickketh closer than a brother. He is
[1:20:01] still the alpha and the omega.
[1:20:05] Oh, hallelujah. It's spiritual
[1:20:07] blessings. Oh my. Brother Brandon would
[1:20:10] tell us that now the you that's here and
[1:20:12] that's needing healing for your body.
[1:20:14] How many believers are here? Raise your
[1:20:17] hand. I'm a believer. As far as I know
[1:20:19] in my heart, how many possesses? He
[1:20:22] says, "You know beyond a shadow of doubt
[1:20:24] that in your heart right now, you've
[1:20:27] been raised from the dead. You know, oh
[1:20:29] my, what could happen in a meeting like
[1:20:31] this?" Yeah. He says, "I know I'm late,
[1:20:34] but what could happen right now?" Just
[1:20:36] think of it. What could take place? The
[1:20:39] potentials are laying in you right now.
[1:20:43] Oh my. Many times we put it all on God.
[1:20:46] If God wants to heal me, he'll heal me.
[1:20:48] If God wants to wants to set me free,
[1:20:50] no, the potentials are laying in you
[1:20:53] right now. If you can get in the right
[1:20:56] atmosphere, oh my, what creates the
[1:20:58] atmosphere, the preaching of the word,
[1:21:01] the Holy Ghost accompanies that word and
[1:21:03] then it conditions the atmosphere.
[1:21:05] That's why I'm so thankful that that
[1:21:07] that a pastor has a burden for this
[1:21:09] message, these tent meetings. He's
[1:21:11] bringing preachers in that preaches this
[1:21:13] message that the atmosphere can be
[1:21:15] conditioned that once your faith starts
[1:21:17] to rise, you can receive the spiritual
[1:21:20] blessings that God has for you.
[1:21:23] Oh my, he says the potentials are laying
[1:21:26] in you right now. Brother Brandham would
[1:21:27] even tell us that the rapture is laying
[1:21:30] in you right now. The potentials are
[1:21:32] there. But I don't believe that God has
[1:21:35] potentially called us to be the bride.
[1:21:37] The potentials are laying there, but I
[1:21:39] believe those potentials have to come to
[1:21:41] fruit. Oh man, I believe those
[1:21:44] potentials is not going to stay in a
[1:21:47] seed form, but they have to come to
[1:21:49] life. Whatever whatever seed is planted
[1:21:52] must come to life. And and I heard a
[1:21:55] quote the other day, Brother Brandham
[1:21:56] would talk about the acorn tree. And I
[1:21:59] think it's so incredible. He says, "If
[1:22:01] you wanted an acorn tree and I give you
[1:22:03] a an an an acorn," he says, "If you
[1:22:06] plant it in the south like you do in the
[1:22:08] north, it'll produce the same results."
[1:22:11] I thought, "My goodness." So, the church
[1:22:13] does not dictate it. The place does.
[1:22:16] Come on. The atmosphere you create, the
[1:22:19] the the condition that your ground is
[1:22:21] in, that's what dictates the the life of
[1:22:24] the seed. But you can take this word. If
[1:22:27] we plant it in Oklahoma, you can plant
[1:22:29] it the same way here. And if you have
[1:22:31] the right atmosphere, it'll bring it'll
[1:22:34] bring forth the same results in Oklahoma
[1:22:36] like it will right here in Blackburg,
[1:22:39] Virginia. Oh my, the potentials are
[1:22:41] there. And brother Brandon would tell us
[1:22:43] that that the the the that the church
[1:22:45] ought to be a million miles up the road.
[1:22:47] He says the potentials are there, but
[1:22:50] something is wrong. He says we have our
[1:22:52] rituals, we have our traditions, but he
[1:22:54] says there's no sincerity. And he says
[1:22:56] God loves sincerity. And he says the
[1:22:59] church is coming to the altar, but he
[1:23:00] says they're chewing bubble gum. He says
[1:23:02] they're they're snickering and hitting
[1:23:04] one another. He says there was no
[1:23:06] sincerity. But then he would talk about
[1:23:08] Zakius. And we say God caused him to do
[1:23:12] the ridiculous to see how determined he
[1:23:14] was to get to Jesus. Cuz we know the
[1:23:17] story of Zakius. He wanted the Bible
[1:23:19] would tell us that he desired to see
[1:23:21] Jesus and who he was. He did not just
[1:23:24] want to see the body of Jesus. He wanted
[1:23:27] to see who was inside of that body. Oh,
[1:23:29] come on now. I don't want to just see a
[1:23:31] preacher. I want to see who's the
[1:23:33] preacher talking about. Come on. I don't
[1:23:35] want to hear just just hear sermons. I
[1:23:37] want to see a living God. But he had a
[1:23:39] desire and he was sincere enough to
[1:23:42] fight for that desire. Brother Brandham
[1:23:44] says he would push a trash can up
[1:23:46] against the tree. would climb on top of
[1:23:48] that trash can and would start to climb
[1:23:50] a tree and he would come to the fork of
[1:23:53] the tree. And he says that's where the
[1:23:54] Old Testament and the New Testament met.
[1:23:57] And he says that put him in a position
[1:23:59] to see Jesus. Oh my. But he was willing
[1:24:02] to do the ridiculous. So then what would
[1:24:04] happen? The Bible says then Jesus walked
[1:24:07] by. So it was no longer Zakius desiring
[1:24:10] to see Jesus. Now it was Jesus desiring
[1:24:13] to see Zakius. Oh, once he was willing
[1:24:16] to do the ridiculous, then Jesus would
[1:24:19] say, "Zakayas, come down from there. For
[1:24:22] today I must abide in your house." And
[1:24:25] oh my, if you're willing to do the
[1:24:27] ridiculous, if you're willing to fight
[1:24:29] for that desire, then your answer would
[1:24:32] come by your way. I'm coming to your
[1:24:34] home tonight. If you're willing to get
[1:24:36] in the sincerity and say, "Lord, I'm
[1:24:39] willing to do what it takes. I'm going
[1:24:41] to see the miraculous in my life. I'm
[1:24:44] going to see the supernatural in my
[1:24:46] home, in my church, whatever it is. I'm
[1:24:49] willing to do the ridiculous.
[1:24:53] Hallelujah. And then what would happen?
[1:24:55] I know this is simple, but what would
[1:24:57] happen? The Bible says he would go to
[1:24:59] Zakius's house, but Jesus already said
[1:25:02] he was going to abide. And the word
[1:25:04] abide means to take up residence. But
[1:25:06] then Jesus would leave. Did that mean
[1:25:08] Jesus lied? No. The flesh may have left.
[1:25:11] But the revelation, the one Zakius
[1:25:14] wanted to see would forever abide in
[1:25:17] that hole. And that revelation would
[1:25:19] begin to change Zakius. Oh my. Because
[1:25:22] Bible tells us that Zakayas would start
[1:25:24] to go to all the ones that he' done
[1:25:26] wrong. And would and he would ask for
[1:25:28] forgiveness. He'd repay all the ones
[1:25:30] that he done wrong. What happened? That
[1:25:33] the body may have left. The preachers
[1:25:35] are going to leave in a couple weeks.
[1:25:37] But the revelation that they're bringing
[1:25:39] to you can abide in your heart, abide in
[1:25:42] your home, that it can bring a change.
[1:25:44] It can bring your body subject to the
[1:25:47] will of God.
[1:25:49] Oh, hallelujah. Because if you really
[1:25:52] know the potentials are on the inside,
[1:25:54] you'll be perseverant to get in the
[1:25:56] right atmosphere. And brother Brandham
[1:25:58] would tell us that men through all of
[1:26:00] the ages that's ever tried to achieve
[1:26:02] something, he says they had to be
[1:26:04] persistent. And he says in order to be
[1:26:07] persistent, you have to know that what
[1:26:10] you are after you can achieve. Oh man,
[1:26:13] that hit me square between the eyes cuz
[1:26:15] many times we do that as church members.
[1:26:17] We thank God for the brass revival. We
[1:26:19] thank God for peace and joy and we know
[1:26:22] it's there, but the devil tells us we
[1:26:24] can't achieve it. Oh, the devil tells us
[1:26:26] we can't have a total deliverance. He
[1:26:28] tells us we can't have joy in the midst
[1:26:30] of the trial. But before you can be
[1:26:33] persistent, you have to know what you're
[1:26:36] after is achievable. Oh man. And I've
[1:26:39] used this example so many times, but how
[1:26:41] many's ever been on a diet before, man?
[1:26:44] And I have struggled with my weight all
[1:26:46] of my life. I've been on diets. I've
[1:26:49] been exercising. But what happens is you
[1:26:51] get sick and tired of the weight, right?
[1:26:53] Then what you do is you tell yourself,
[1:26:55] "I'm going to start eating right. I'm
[1:26:57] going to start working out." But the
[1:26:59] first 3 to four days is hard. And if you
[1:27:01] can ever get over that hump, then you
[1:27:03] start to do better. But those first
[1:27:05] three or four days, your mind starts to
[1:27:07] tell you you can't do it. You can't
[1:27:09] achieve it. You can't lose weight. And
[1:27:11] then once you start to believe that,
[1:27:13] then you're not persistent. Then you're
[1:27:16] not persevering because you think that
[1:27:18] what you're after you can never achieve.
[1:27:20] And don't let the devil tell you that.
[1:27:22] that you cannot have joy, you can't have
[1:27:25] revival, you can't have your children,
[1:27:27] you can't have a the the filling of the
[1:27:29] Holy Ghost, you can't have a renewing.
[1:27:31] If you are led from your soul to a
[1:27:33] believing, then be perseverant against
[1:27:36] all the odds, against the negativity,
[1:27:39] against the doubt and the unbelief, be
[1:27:42] perseverant and say, "Whatever it takes,
[1:27:44] if I need to fast and pray for this
[1:27:46] meeting, I'm going to do it. If I have
[1:27:49] to lay aside my phone, I'm going to do
[1:27:51] it. I'm willing to do the ridiculous for
[1:27:54] me to see the miraculous.
[1:27:57] Hallelujah. Because there's a reward for
[1:27:59] it. The Bible would tell us in Hebrews
[1:28:01] 11:6, "But without thou faith, it is
[1:28:04] impossible to please him. For he that
[1:28:06] cometh to God must believe that he is,
[1:28:09] and he's a rewarder of them that
[1:28:11] diligently seek him." So the reward is
[1:28:14] only going to come from diligence. It's
[1:28:16] only going to come from perseverance.
[1:28:18] It's only going to come from somebody
[1:28:20] saying, "I'm going to do this against
[1:28:22] every opposition, against all the odds,
[1:28:25] I'm going to do it." Because you see,
[1:28:28] once our soul is in heavenly places,
[1:28:30] then the word starts to bring our body
[1:28:32] into subjection. And brother Brown would
[1:28:34] tell us, he would say, "Now we can
[1:28:36] preach the word, explain the word, but
[1:28:38] you have to receive the word." Oh,
[1:28:40] hallelujah. He says, "That's what sets
[1:28:42] it a fire, brother. When you receive the
[1:28:45] word, the revelation, something slips
[1:28:47] out of the unseen world yonder and comes
[1:28:50] rolling down through a mystical channel
[1:28:52] somewhere into your soul that says, "Now
[1:28:56] I see."
[1:28:58] And then he says this, "Your eyes
[1:29:00] brighten up. Your lips that hung down
[1:29:03] straighten up and smile. Every muscle in
[1:29:05] your body seems to rejoice. Something's
[1:29:09] going to happen." What made this change?
[1:29:12] The heavenlies came into the soul. Come
[1:29:15] on now. What was it? The revelation.
[1:29:17] Once you get that revelation, he says
[1:29:19] something slips out into an unseen world
[1:29:21] yonder and it brings it into your soul.
[1:29:24] And then your soul says, "Now I see
[1:29:26] you." And then your body gets brought
[1:29:28] into subjection that the the the smile
[1:29:31] that was no that wasn't there begins to
[1:29:33] smile again. every every muscle in your
[1:29:36] body begins to rejoice because your your
[1:29:39] body was brought into subjection by your
[1:29:42] soul. You see, we're not to be
[1:29:44] controlled by our emotions. Come on now.
[1:29:46] We're not to be controlled by by your
[1:29:48] affection or imagination and our
[1:29:50] conscience. But our soul is to control
[1:29:53] our body. We're going to make mistakes.
[1:29:55] We're going to make failures. But the
[1:29:57] the the soul is going to pick you back
[1:29:59] up and say, "I'm sorry." and continue
[1:30:02] going on. Brother Brandham says, "The
[1:30:04] spirit that raised him from the dead
[1:30:06] dwelling in you will also bring your
[1:30:08] mortal bodies, the dust of the earth
[1:30:10] into subjection." You see what is it?
[1:30:13] Subjection to what? Christ. Who is
[1:30:15] Christ? The word. Not the theology, but
[1:30:19] the word. Oh my. Not some theology, not
[1:30:23] some tradition, but the word. And I
[1:30:25] believe that that we don't have to live
[1:30:27] in spiritual poverty because of our
[1:30:29] emotions. My brother Brandon would tell
[1:30:31] the story uh the lady that was living in
[1:30:34] poverty. I I know y'all know the story.
[1:30:36] And and she would sell all of her
[1:30:38] furniture for food and the neighbor
[1:30:40] would call uh but would call charity and
[1:30:42] they would send investigators over and
[1:30:44] would ask her, "How old are you?" She
[1:30:45] would say, "I'm 80 years old." And she
[1:30:47] would say, they would ask her, "Do you
[1:30:49] have no family, no children, nobody that
[1:30:51] can take care of you?" And she would
[1:30:53] say, "No, I've got a son and he's over
[1:30:55] in India. He's a businessman." And they
[1:30:57] would say, "Man, does he not take care
[1:30:59] of you?" Does he not give you any money
[1:31:01] and financial support? She would say,
[1:31:03] "Oh, well, you know, he sends me uh
[1:31:05] beautiful pictures once or twice a
[1:31:07] month, but but I don't want to bother
[1:31:09] him about money. You know, it's a nice
[1:31:11] thing that he he sends me these
[1:31:13] pictures, but I don't want to bother
[1:31:14] him. He's busy." And they said, "Let us
[1:31:16] see those pictures." And she would go
[1:31:18] grab her Bible, open up the Bible. And
[1:31:20] in the Bible was money orders. Brother
[1:31:22] Brandham says she had hundreds of
[1:31:24] thousands of dollars in those money
[1:31:26] orders, but she was living in spiritual
[1:31:28] poverty because she failed to realize
[1:31:31] what was deposited to her. Oh, come on,
[1:31:34] church. I don't believe we have to live
[1:31:36] in spiritual poverty. If we can only
[1:31:38] recognize that we're not serpent seed,
[1:31:41] but we're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:43] We're not some casting. We're not
[1:31:45] tribulation saints, but we're the bride
[1:31:47] of Jesus Christ that he has given his
[1:31:50] name to.
[1:31:52] Whatsoever you do in word or do I indeed
[1:31:55] do all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:31:57] Christ. That's what the bride is doing.
[1:31:59] We have taken on his name. You see,
[1:32:02] brother Brandon, he and God's provided
[1:32:04] place of worship. Brother Brandham would
[1:32:06] get into an argument with I guess a
[1:32:08] trinitarian I think is what it was. And
[1:32:09] they were talking about water baptism.
[1:32:11] You know, brother Brandon, the man would
[1:32:13] come to brother Brandham and would say,
[1:32:15] "So, does everything your wife do when
[1:32:17] she sweeps, is she saying, "I'm doing in
[1:32:19] the in William Brandham's name, William
[1:32:21] Brandham's name." She He says, "No, but
[1:32:23] first, she has to take on my name." He
[1:32:25] says, "You can't just go down the street
[1:32:27] and say, "Come here, Mrs. Brown. Miss
[1:32:29] Brown, come be my wife." He says, "You
[1:32:31] can't do that. That would be adultery."
[1:32:34] But he says, you got to take, she has to
[1:32:35] take on your name through a marriage.
[1:32:38] And then once she takes on your name,
[1:32:40] then everything she does is now in your
[1:32:42] name. He says, "Now when sister Ma took
[1:32:45] on my name, when she's sweeping, that's
[1:32:48] in my name. When she's cooking, that's
[1:32:50] in my name." Cuz there was a union that
[1:32:52] took place between her and me. And the
[1:32:56] bride has taken on the name of Jesus
[1:32:58] Christ. This message has brought us
[1:33:00] together, has brought the body to the
[1:33:03] head, and has united us together. So
[1:33:05] when you're at the workplace, you're
[1:33:07] doing it in the name of Jesus. Whenever
[1:33:09] you're sweeping your home, cleaning your
[1:33:11] house, you're doing it all in the name
[1:33:14] of the Lord Jesus. And in that name
[1:33:16] becomes the the benefits comes the
[1:33:19] realities of the
[1:33:21] supernatural. Oh, we don't got to live
[1:33:23] in spiritual poverty. The apostle Paul
[1:33:25] would say, "What I keep under my body
[1:33:27] and bring it into subjection, lest that
[1:33:29] by any means when I preach to others, I
[1:33:32] myself should be a cast away."
[1:33:35] Scullfield would say, "Lead your body
[1:33:36] captive." So, I I lead my body captive
[1:33:39] and bring it into subjection. So, it's
[1:33:42] no longer your flesh leading you, your
[1:33:44] emotions leading you, and your feelings,
[1:33:46] but now you brought that into
[1:33:48] subjection. And then that word cast away
[1:33:51] in the Greek means not standing the
[1:33:53] test. And I thought, my cuz brother
[1:33:55] Brandon would tell us that tempted is to
[1:33:57] be tested. So every time the devil
[1:33:59] tempts us and tests us, he's trying to
[1:34:01] get you to be a cast away. Oh, and if
[1:34:03] you're having mind battles, he's trying
[1:34:05] to get you to be a cast away. But I
[1:34:07] bring my my my mind into subjection. I
[1:34:10] lead it captive unless I am a cast away.
[1:34:13] And the the the James 1:12 would say,
[1:34:15] "Blessed is the man that endureth
[1:34:17] temptation or testing, for when he has
[1:34:20] tried, he shall receive the crown of
[1:34:22] life, which the Lord hath promised to
[1:34:24] them that love him." And the Apostle
[1:34:27] Brother would tell us that that crown
[1:34:29] means eternal life. He says, "The crown
[1:34:31] of life means eternal life, and it's a
[1:34:34] domain upon the earth. And we're to be
[1:34:36] made kings and priests upon the earth."
[1:34:39] So that's why we cannot be a cast away
[1:34:42] when the devil comes. That's why the
[1:34:43] Apostle Paul knew if I can just keep my
[1:34:46] my my body into subjection. If I can
[1:34:48] just keep my mind into subjection,
[1:34:51] there's a crown of life that is waiting
[1:34:53] for me. Even when he was being beaten,
[1:34:55] he had the reward in mind. When he was
[1:34:58] being stoned, there was a reward in his
[1:35:00] mind. If I can just be perseverant, I
[1:35:03] can obtain the reward that God has given
[1:35:06] me. The Apostle Paul would say, "Satan
[1:35:08] buffets me." And we know what that
[1:35:09] means. Brother Brandon would tell us
[1:35:11] that it's blow after blow after blow.
[1:35:14] And the Apostle Paul, I think it's
[1:35:16] incredible that what he types it to. He
[1:35:18] says, "It's a thorn in my flesh." And he
[1:35:21] says, "Lord, take this affirmity from
[1:35:23] me." And the Lord would speak back to
[1:35:25] him and would say, "My grace is
[1:35:27] sufficient for thee that in your
[1:35:29] weakness my strength can be made
[1:35:32] perfect." And he was saying, "It's my
[1:35:34] flesh, not my soul. My flesh is weak. My
[1:35:37] flesh is being buffeted." But the Lord
[1:35:40] says, "I'm giving you grace to bring
[1:35:42] that flesh into subjection." Even when
[1:35:45] you're tired, even when you're beat
[1:35:46] down, his grace is still sufficient.
[1:35:49] It's still more than enough to meet the
[1:35:52] need. Even when you feel like you can't
[1:35:54] take another step, his grace is still
[1:35:56] there. Yeah. Oh man, it seems like it's
[1:35:59] that when we're at the lowest moment is
[1:36:01] when the devil comes or the Bible would
[1:36:03] tell us that Jesus was led into the
[1:36:05] wilderness to be tempted and he fasted
[1:36:08] 40 days and 40 nights and afterwards he
[1:36:11] was a hunger and then the Bible says
[1:36:13] then the tempter came to him and what
[1:36:15] did what did the tempter do in Matthew
[1:36:18] 4:3 and when the tempter came to him he
[1:36:21] said if thou be the son of God command
[1:36:24] these stones to be made bread that
[1:36:26] wasn't tempting the soul that was
[1:36:28] tempting the flesh. He was hungry. If
[1:36:31] thou be the son of God, turn these
[1:36:34] stones into bread. But then he would
[1:36:36] pick up scripture and would say, "It is
[1:36:38] written." And what I love about it is
[1:36:40] the Bible would tell us that then the
[1:36:41] devil would pick up his own scripture
[1:36:43] and would say, "Jump from this mountain
[1:36:45] and it is written that the angels are
[1:36:47] going to come and and will pick you up
[1:36:50] before you fall." And then Jesus would
[1:36:52] say, "It is written again." So even when
[1:36:54] the devil was coming with scripture to
[1:36:57] beat him down, there was a discernment.
[1:37:00] There was a discernment to say, "Hey,
[1:37:02] but it is also written." And many times
[1:37:04] the devil does that with condemnation.
[1:37:06] Says, "You made a mistake." And the
[1:37:08] Bible says here that you're not worthy.
[1:37:10] You're this and you're that. But that's
[1:37:12] when that soul rises up and says, "It is
[1:37:14] also written that there's nothing you
[1:37:16] can do." Oh, hallelujah. That there's no
[1:37:20] sin against me. There's no addiction
[1:37:22] against me. There's no past against me,
[1:37:24] there's no failures against me, it is
[1:37:27] also written, even when my flesh does
[1:37:30] not want to believe it, I still believe
[1:37:32] it.
[1:37:33] Oh my, that's when the enemy scatters is
[1:37:36] whenever his champion is beat down.
[1:37:39] Brother Brandon would tell us that the
[1:37:42] whenever the Philistines came against
[1:37:44] the Israelites and was boasting, he
[1:37:46] says, Goliath, he says, the devil only
[1:37:48] comes against you when he thinks he has
[1:37:50] the upper hand. And here comes Goliath.
[1:37:52] and he's boasting, "Send me out a man,
[1:37:54] you know, defy the armies of the living
[1:37:56] God." But something changed real quick
[1:37:58] when a man accepted the challenge and
[1:38:01] brought Goliath down. It was no longer
[1:38:03] the Philistines chasing the Israelites,
[1:38:06] but now it's the Israelites chasing the
[1:38:08] Philistines. How come their champion was
[1:38:11] brought down? The champion was brought
[1:38:13] into subjection. And brother Brandham
[1:38:16] says, "Who's your greatest enemy?"
[1:38:17] Yourself. So once your body gets brought
[1:38:20] into subjection, that's when every enemy
[1:38:22] scatters. Oh, come on now. That's when
[1:38:25] the devil gets on the run. Because if he
[1:38:27] can't get your mind or get your body, he
[1:38:29] can never get that soul. So I said,
[1:38:32] let's be bring our body into subjection
[1:38:34] and start chasing the devil. Bring our
[1:38:36] emotions into subjection. Bring our
[1:38:39] feelings into subjection. What I see,
[1:38:41] what I hear, what I feel, that does not
[1:38:44] matter. The only thing that matters is
[1:38:46] the word of God.
[1:38:48] casting down imagination. 2 Corinthians
[1:38:50] 10:4, my my opening scripture. For the
[1:38:53] weapons of our warfare are not carnal,
[1:38:55] but mighty through God through the
[1:38:57] pulling down of strongholds, casting
[1:38:59] down imaginations and every high thing
[1:39:02] that exaltth
[1:39:03] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:39:07] bringing into captivity every thought,
[1:39:10] excuse me, to the obedience of Christ.
[1:39:13] Brother Brown would say, "Cast down
[1:39:15] reasonings." He says, "Your reasoning
[1:39:17] power will go away when you die." But he
[1:39:20] says, "Your soul is going to be with you
[1:39:22] forever." Ain't that incredible? Cast
[1:39:25] down those reasonings because they're
[1:39:27] going to die anyways. Don't throw away
[1:39:29] your soul for reasonings. But g up that
[1:39:32] soul and cast down the reasonings
[1:39:35] because that soul is going to live
[1:39:37] forever. And what I think is is powerful
[1:39:40] is brother Brandham would talk about how
[1:39:42] whenever Jesus was upon the upon the
[1:39:44] boat and the storms was coming against
[1:39:46] that little boat, brother Brandham says
[1:39:48] that that he created the winds, he
[1:39:50] created the waves, it was creation from
[1:39:53] him. He says if he created them, could
[1:39:56] he not bring them into subjection? And
[1:39:58] he says he he he would speak peace, be
[1:40:00] still and they would have to obey him
[1:40:03] because he created them. He then goes on
[1:40:05] to say, "Let us remember he also created
[1:40:08] our bodies." He says, "If he created our
[1:40:11] bodies," he says, "Can't you not
[1:40:13] surrender your thoughts to him and
[1:40:16] surrender your life to him? Then your
[1:40:18] body can be brought into subjection."
[1:40:21] The Apostle Paul would say, "The life I
[1:40:23] once lived, I live no more, but Christ
[1:40:26] that lives hid me." His body was a
[1:40:28] creation just like the winds and the
[1:40:31] waves. He created those winds and the
[1:40:33] waves. Then they had to be brought into
[1:40:35] subjection. And then he would say, "And
[1:40:37] then our bodies will make a will obey
[1:40:39] him so much that whenever we lose full
[1:40:42] control of it and we're laying there in
[1:40:44] the grave and he says we're just a
[1:40:46] spoonful of dust," he says our bodies is
[1:40:48] still subject to him. Though when the
[1:40:50] voice of resurrection begins to ring
[1:40:52] out, that body has to come out of the
[1:40:55] grave. That's what happens when we are
[1:40:57] subject to the word of God. You might go
[1:41:00] the way of the grave, but when your
[1:41:02] emotions are gone, when your sensations
[1:41:04] are gone, that soul is still living. And
[1:41:07] that body that was once subject to the
[1:41:09] word will be brought out of that grave.
[1:41:12] It was Jesus when he came to the the the
[1:41:14] the tomb of Lazarus and was say,
[1:41:16] Lazarus, come forth. There was a deep
[1:41:19] call into the deep. He had to respond.
[1:41:22] Oh my. Even if we go by the way of the
[1:41:24] grave, we have to respond. Brother
[1:41:27] Brandham must say when the tribulation
[1:41:29] when the tribulation comes, he says the
[1:41:31] Holy Spirit is going to go back to its
[1:41:33] maker. And he says if we're tied to it,
[1:41:35] we're going to go with it as well. What
[1:41:37] is it? Our body has been made subject to
[1:41:39] him. Though whenever tribulation does
[1:41:41] begin to come, we're out of here. I
[1:41:43] don't believe we're going through the
[1:41:45] tribulation. Come on now. We're not
[1:41:47] tribulation saints. We're the bride of
[1:41:49] Christ, the rapturing generation that
[1:41:51] has been made subject to him.
[1:41:53] Hallelujah. Brother Brand, I think this
[1:41:56] quote is so powerful. He would say this.
[1:41:58] He spoke of this age and what would be
[1:42:00] now. The believers of this age has to
[1:42:03] believe this. What he promised today
[1:42:06] just as just as they had to come into
[1:42:09] the ark to be saved, go out of Egypt to
[1:42:11] be saved. They have to come into Christ
[1:42:14] to be saved now into the word message
[1:42:17] that he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:42:20] forever. How do you get in it? By
[1:42:23] baptism. Baptism of what? Water by the
[1:42:25] Holy Ghost. One spirit we all baptized
[1:42:28] into one body. And he says and his
[1:42:31] promised word, he says you won't have to
[1:42:33] interpret it. He will interpret it
[1:42:36] through you. What are you doing? What he
[1:42:38] promised to do. The church that follows
[1:42:41] him will be so much like him. And so the
[1:42:44] people will know. I love it. He asked
[1:42:46] the question, what are you going to do?
[1:42:48] What he promised to do. So, it's no
[1:42:50] longer I that liveth, but it's Christ
[1:42:52] that liveth in me. It's not me trying to
[1:42:54] do the greater works. It's him doing the
[1:42:56] greater works inside of my life.
[1:42:59] Hallelujah. Oh my. And God just needs a
[1:43:02] body to work through to perform the will
[1:43:04] of the father. And the Bible would talk
[1:43:07] about a man that was possessed with the
[1:43:09] devil. And and this man, this father
[1:43:11] would come to Jesus and would say, "My
[1:43:13] son throws himself into the fire, throws
[1:43:16] himself into the water. And if you can
[1:43:18] just do anything, have compassion upon
[1:43:20] me. And what would Jesus say? Jesus
[1:43:23] would look at him and would say, "If
[1:43:25] thou cast believe, all things are
[1:43:27] possible." And what would that man say?
[1:43:29] I do believe, but help my unbelief. Oh,
[1:43:33] man. Don't we get that place sometimes?
[1:43:35] Lord, I believe. I've not lost my faith,
[1:43:37] but I'm just weary. I'm just tired. I
[1:43:40] believe, but help my unbelief. And what
[1:43:43] I I think is so incredible is this man
[1:43:45] came to Jesus and says just have
[1:43:47] compassion on me. And man, Jesus wasn't
[1:43:50] there to give compassion, right? Because
[1:43:52] what would brother Brandham tell us
[1:43:53] whenever Jesus went to the pool of
[1:43:55] Bethesda? Brother Brandham says that you
[1:43:57] would think a man full of compassion
[1:43:59] would have stopped by everybody else and
[1:44:01] healed them. Y'all remember him talking
[1:44:02] about that? He says many people mistake
[1:44:04] compassion for human sympathy. He says
[1:44:07] compassion is to do the will of the
[1:44:10] father. So here came this man to Jesus
[1:44:13] said, "My boy is is possessed by a
[1:44:15] spirit, throwing him into the water,
[1:44:17] throwing him into the fire. Just have
[1:44:20] sympathy on me." And I'm so thankful we
[1:44:22] got a five-fold ministry that don't just
[1:44:24] have sympathy on you, but is bringing
[1:44:26] you the will of the father. The will of
[1:44:28] the father wasn't for Jesus to look at
[1:44:30] that man and say, "I'm so sorry you had
[1:44:33] to go through that. I'm sorry your house
[1:44:35] is is bound by devils. I'm sorry your
[1:44:37] boy is being tormented, but maybe if you
[1:44:40] if you do this and be good, maybe God
[1:44:43] will deliver you. Jesus didn't say none
[1:44:45] of that. He threw away human sympathy.
[1:44:48] It says if you can believe the will of
[1:44:50] the father can be manifested into your
[1:44:52] life. And this message has not brought
[1:44:55] us human sympathy. It has brought us the
[1:44:58] will of the father. That if you can
[1:45:00] believe, believe for big things.
[1:45:02] Whatever the spirit leads your soul to
[1:45:04] believe, believe it. Even if you're weak
[1:45:07] in faith, cry out to God. Lord, I
[1:45:10] believe, but help my unbelief. I don't
[1:45:12] want sympathy. Give me the promises of
[1:45:15] God. Give me the spiritual blessings of
[1:45:17] God. That I can have joy unspeakable and
[1:45:20] full of glory. That I can have my peace.
[1:45:23] I can have my children filled with the
[1:45:24] Holy Ghost. I don't want sympathy. Give
[1:45:27] me the will of the father.
[1:45:30] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, I don't want
[1:45:33] sympathy. I want the will of the father
[1:45:35] in my life. And what would happen? The
[1:45:37] boy would be made set free because of
[1:45:39] the will of the father. It was the will
[1:45:41] of the father claiming a body. And that
[1:45:44] body then would start to manifest what
[1:45:46] was in God's mind. And he's still
[1:45:48] claiming bodies today. Oh, you remember
[1:45:50] Elisha and Elijah? The Bible would tell
[1:45:53] us that that Elijah would go he he would
[1:45:55] go by Elisha. And I think it's
[1:45:57] incredible here Elisha was plowing with
[1:45:59] oxen. And the Bible says Elijah would go
[1:46:02] by him and just throw his mantle upon
[1:46:04] him. Didn't even say a word. Just threw
[1:46:06] his mantel upon Elisha. And Elisha
[1:46:09] stopped and he says, "Hang on, let me go
[1:46:11] kiss my mother and father goodbye and
[1:46:13] then I will follow you." And brother,
[1:46:15] the Bible would tell us that those oxen
[1:46:18] that he had, he slayed them. He would
[1:46:20] slay the oxen and would give it to the
[1:46:22] town's people to eat. Brother Brandham
[1:46:24] says, "What did that represent?" That
[1:46:26] was him killing everything behind him
[1:46:28] and choosing a new life. So he was he
[1:46:31] would go and brother Brandham would tell
[1:46:32] us there was three stages right to
[1:46:35] Elisha. He would he would go to uh he
[1:46:38] would go to Gilgal, I believe, right? He
[1:46:39] would go to Gilgal. And what I think is
[1:46:42] incredible is brother Brown would say
[1:46:44] that Elijah would test Elisha and would
[1:46:46] say, "The Lord is calling me to Gilgal,
[1:46:49] you stay here." And Elisha would say,
[1:46:51] "No, as the Lord liveth and my soul
[1:46:53] liveth, I'm going with you." They would
[1:46:55] go to Gilgal. The same thing he was
[1:46:57] going to the school of the prophets. And
[1:46:59] Elijah would say, "Stay here." He says,
[1:47:01] "No, as the Lord liveth and as my soul
[1:47:04] liveth, I'm going with you." We need
[1:47:06] some more believers like that. Even when
[1:47:08] my faith is tested, as long as there's a
[1:47:11] God in Israel, I'm going to follow you.
[1:47:14] They would go to the school of the
[1:47:15] prophets. And this is what I think is so
[1:47:17] powerful that there was there was 50
[1:47:19] prophets that would pull Elisha to the
[1:47:22] side and would say, "Hey, Elijah's
[1:47:24] getting old. Won't you stay here with
[1:47:26] us? He's going to die." And you know
[1:47:28] what he says? No. As the Lord liveth and
[1:47:31] as my soul liveth, I'm going with
[1:47:33] Elisha. Or Elijah, you know what brother
[1:47:35] Brandham said? Brother Brandham says he
[1:47:37] had tasted of God and he knew there was
[1:47:40] more for him. Oh my, we need some more
[1:47:42] believers like that. I've tasted of God
[1:47:45] before, but there was more for me.
[1:47:47] There's more power to come inside of
[1:47:49] this flesh. There's more anointing to
[1:47:51] come inside of my life. Let me be the
[1:47:53] embodiment of the supernatural of Jesus
[1:47:56] Christ.
[1:47:58] Oh, hallelujah. Then the Bible would
[1:48:00] tell us that they would go to Jordan and
[1:48:02] before as they were on the the border of
[1:48:04] Jordan, which was the third stage, and
[1:48:06] was about to cross over, the Bible says
[1:48:09] that those 50 prophets were watching
[1:48:11] from afar. And I thought that was so sad
[1:48:14] that here was the prophet taking the
[1:48:17] next generation into their inheritance
[1:48:21] and they were standing from afar. I
[1:48:23] said, "Lord, don't let us do that. Come
[1:48:25] on now. Time to stand from afar and
[1:48:27] watch others cross over into the
[1:48:29] promised land. Watch the others cross
[1:48:31] over Jordan, which is death. Watch all
[1:48:33] the other ones walk over and I'm
[1:48:35] watching from afar. The Bible says they
[1:48:38] would cross over Jordan. And then Elijah
[1:48:40] would say, "Hey, you've been with me a
[1:48:42] long time. What do you want? What's your
[1:48:44] request?" And the Bible says Elisha
[1:48:46] looked at him and says, "I want a double
[1:48:48] portion." Cuz we know he grabbed the
[1:48:50] mantel, right? Struck the struck the
[1:48:52] Jordan. They get across it and he says,
[1:48:54] "I want a double portion." And what
[1:48:56] would Elijah say? You've asked a hard
[1:48:58] thing, but if you keep your eyes upon
[1:49:00] me, when I leave, you shall have what
[1:49:03] you ask for. And brother Brandham says
[1:49:06] he never took his eyes off of Elijah.
[1:49:08] And he says, what does that represent?
[1:49:10] The word. He says the bride is to keep
[1:49:12] their eyes upon the word. We're not
[1:49:15] deifying, brother Brandham. But we have
[1:49:17] got deity, the word. And that is what
[1:49:20] we're watching. That is where our
[1:49:22] inheritance is going to come from is the
[1:49:24] word of God. Oh my. The Bible says as
[1:49:27] Elisha Elijah was going off in the
[1:49:30] chariots of fire that the mantle would
[1:49:32] fall back on Elisha. And you know what
[1:49:34] would happen? What what that he would
[1:49:36] pick up that mantle. And what is so
[1:49:38] important about this mantle and and as I
[1:49:41] was studying on these things, I I
[1:49:43] thought it was so incredible that the
[1:49:45] first time that this mantle was
[1:49:47] mentioned was whenever Elijah was
[1:49:49] running from Jezebel and he was in that
[1:49:51] cave and he was he was trying to hear
[1:49:54] from the Lord. He heard the earthquake.
[1:49:56] The Lord wasn't in the earthquake,
[1:49:57] right? Heard the fire. The Lord wasn't
[1:49:59] there. He heard another. The Lord wasn't
[1:50:01] there. But then that still small voice.
[1:50:04] And the Bible says once he heard that
[1:50:06] still small voice, he picked up that
[1:50:08] mantle and covered his face with it. And
[1:50:10] I thought, my goodness, what made that
[1:50:12] mantle so special was that still small
[1:50:15] voice. And if you look in the Greek, the
[1:50:17] the the definition of Elijah's mantle is
[1:50:20] glory. Everybody else's mantle or cloak
[1:50:24] meant mantle meant cloak, but Elijah's
[1:50:27] mantle meant glory. And I thought, "Oh
[1:50:29] my, we've got the glory of the Lord in
[1:50:32] this generation that has claimed our
[1:50:34] life, it was the glory of the Lord that
[1:50:36] whenever he threw that cloak upon
[1:50:39] Elisha, he would say, "I will follow
[1:50:41] again." It was the glory of the Lord
[1:50:43] that would split the Jordan and they
[1:50:44] would walk across it. But it was that
[1:50:47] same authority that Elisha would pick up
[1:50:49] and would say, "Where is the God of
[1:50:52] Elijah?" And the same miracle that
[1:50:54] Elijah would produce. Elisha was then
[1:50:57] demonstrating and little church, we've
[1:50:59] got our double portion in this
[1:51:01] generation. The glory of the Lord has
[1:51:04] risen upon thee. Not just around you,
[1:51:07] but upon you and has claimed your life,
[1:51:10] you shall speak to this mountain.
[1:51:12] Whatever you desire in your heart, you
[1:51:14] speak the word and doubt not. And it'll
[1:51:17] happen as you say. The glory of the Lord
[1:51:20] has risen upon thee. Brother Brown must
[1:51:22] say, "We've been claimed by the glory of
[1:51:25] the Lord." He says, "We once was claimed
[1:51:27] by the devil's pawn shop, but then the
[1:51:29] glory of the Lord claimed us out of it."
[1:51:31] Oh my. That's why greater is he that is
[1:51:34] in you, than he that is in the world.
[1:51:36] It's not by might, not by power, but by
[1:51:38] my spirit, saith the Lord. It's nothing
[1:51:41] you can do, but it's the Almighty God
[1:51:44] bringing you subject to his word.
[1:51:48] Hallelujah. Where is the God of Elijah?
[1:51:52] Where is he? Brother Brandham says the
[1:51:54] reason Elijah or God called Elisha was
[1:51:57] because he was he he would plow straight
[1:51:59] roads. And he says he could not look
[1:52:01] behind him. He says if he would look
[1:52:03] behind him, he would veer off. But he
[1:52:05] says he was keeping his eyes straight
[1:52:07] ahead. And little church, we're not
[1:52:09] looking behind us at a God of yesterday,
[1:52:11] a revival of yesterday, a message of
[1:52:14] yesterday. We're looking straight ahead
[1:52:16] of us. Brother Brandon must say this is
[1:52:18] bright time. He says the message of
[1:52:20] yesterday cannot condition you, but he
[1:52:22] says this is bright time. We're not
[1:52:24] looking behind us, but we are the Elisha
[1:52:27] that was plowing and looking straight
[1:52:29] ahead, forgetting those things which are
[1:52:32] behind and pressing forward to the
[1:52:35] things ahead of us. You know, brother
[1:52:37] Brandon would talk about a pain of fire
[1:52:39] and I'm bringing this to a close. He
[1:52:41] would talk about a pain of fire and and
[1:52:43] would say this here. The pain of fire.
[1:52:45] He says, "It's crazy if you would bring
[1:52:47] somebody that was cold and would say,
[1:52:49] "Here's a paint of fire." He says,
[1:52:50] "What's that represent? A fire of
[1:52:52] yesterday." He says, "That fire could
[1:52:54] could heat you up yesterday, but not
[1:52:56] today. Now it's painted." Oh, come on.
[1:52:59] We're not looking at a god of yesterday.
[1:53:01] We're not looking at a a tent meeting of
[1:53:03] last year. We're thankful for that. But
[1:53:05] what about today? I'm not looking of
[1:53:07] something of 10 years ago, 20 years ago
[1:53:09] when brother Brandon was upon the earth
[1:53:12] in the 60s, but I'm looking at a God of
[1:53:15] today. This ain't a painted religion.
[1:53:18] This is a reality that can still change
[1:53:21] lives. Let our musicians come this
[1:53:23] morning.
[1:53:25] We're looking straight at the word of
[1:53:27] God. No matter what comes and what goes,
[1:53:31] we're looking at the word of God.
[1:53:34] Isaiah 52:1, "Awake, awake, put on thy
[1:53:38] strength. Oh Zion, put on thy beautiful
[1:53:40] garments. Oh Jerusalem, the holy city,
[1:53:43] for henceforth there shall be no more
[1:53:45] come into thee, the uncircumcised and
[1:53:48] the unclean, and shake thyself from the
[1:53:50] dust and arise." Oh my bride, I think
[1:53:55] it's time that we put on the strength of
[1:53:56] the word and shake thyself from the
[1:53:59] dust. Shake oursel from our humanity.
[1:54:02] shake oursel from every thought that is
[1:54:05] that is that that is contrary to the
[1:54:07] word of God and leading it captive bring
[1:54:10] into subjection my body and lest when I
[1:54:13] preach to others I myself may be a cast
[1:54:16] away the Apostle Paul would say let us
[1:54:18] therefore cast off the works of darkness
[1:54:21] and let us put on the armor of light let
[1:54:25] us cast off those things and put on the
[1:54:27] glory of the Lord we've been claimed by
[1:54:30] it oh little church we've and claimed by
[1:54:32] brother Brandham would say, "Oh, what a
[1:54:34] day. What an opportunity that even the
[1:54:36] weakest of Christians has today testify
[1:54:40] for the glory of the Lord." What an
[1:54:42] opportunity to do something that the
[1:54:45] prophets desire to do. It's laid in the
[1:54:48] hands of the feeblest Christians, the
[1:54:51] little housewives. It's in your hands
[1:54:53] today to testify to the glory of Jesus
[1:54:57] Christ and his resurrection. It's in
[1:55:00] your hands. The ones that the feeblest,
[1:55:02] the tired, the most weary, it seems like
[1:55:05] your mind is bringing you down. Your
[1:55:07] body is bringing you down. But it's in
[1:55:09] your hands to testify of the glory of
[1:55:12] the Lord. Oh my. I say, don't let the
[1:55:14] devil take away our praise. Don't let
[1:55:16] the devil take away our joy. For we've
[1:55:19] been claimed by the glory of the Lord.
[1:55:21] But the devil meant for evil, God turned
[1:55:23] for good. Everything the devil's thrown
[1:55:25] upon us, God has brought us back.
[1:55:28] Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads tonight
[1:55:31] this
[1:55:31] morning, dear. Heavenly
[1:55:34] Father, Lord, how we love you. Thank you
[1:55:37] for this word that you've given
[1:55:39] us and calling us out, Lord, and placing
[1:55:43] us into heavenly places, Lord, claiming
[1:55:46] us by your
[1:55:48] glory. Lord, I ask that you would just
[1:55:51] be so real to us, Father, as we come
[1:55:53] into this
[1:55:54] meeting. Speak to the hearts, Lord.
[1:55:57] Speak to the
[1:55:59] needs, Lord. I know you can do it even
[1:56:01] now as we feel your presence here among
[1:56:04] us. Lord, if there's some that is weary
[1:56:08] and beat down, Father, maybe their flesh
[1:56:10] has got the best of
[1:56:12] them. Lord, may you lift up the feeble
[1:56:15] hands. May the weak say, "I am strong."
[1:56:18] Lord, I ask that you would
[1:56:20] encourage, strengthen.
[1:56:22] Father Lord, you're still Jehovah Gyra,
[1:56:25] our
[1:56:26] provider. Lord, we love you. Father, we
[1:56:30] commit the remainder of this service
[1:56:31] into your hands in Jesus name.
[1:56:37] Amen. The power. Can we sting and stand
[1:56:40] and sing
[1:56:42] this name of Jesus?
[1:56:47] [Music]
[1:57:05] and God bless you this morning as we
[1:57:06] turn to our
[1:57:08] [Music]
[1:57:11] pastor. Oh
[1:57:13] yes, God the
[1:57:17] [Music]
[1:57:23] [Music]
[1:57:25] We've got the
[1:57:31] power in the name. Do you believe that
[1:57:34] this
[1:57:36] morning? Oh, we've got the
[1:57:42] power to live in another atmosphere, a
[1:57:46] creative atmosphere.
[1:57:49] an atmosphere that Satan himself cannot
[1:57:52] live
[1:57:53] in. Oh
[1:57:56] yes, we will not be
[1:58:02] defeated. We've got the
[1:58:08] power in the name of the Lord.
[1:58:15] How for many years
[1:58:20] now, Satan's done his best to stop us.
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:28] But the bride of
[1:58:33] Jesus is still strong and
[1:58:39] alive. And like a
[1:58:41] mighty
[1:58:45] army, she's marching
[1:58:49] upward. It's the way brother Brandham
[1:58:51] saw
[1:58:52] us. Going up, up, up. Hallelujah.
[1:58:57] walking with
[1:58:59] God. Hallelujah. The devil don't know
[1:59:02] what to do with us. He's done
[1:59:03] everything. He's thrown everything at
[1:59:05] us. And we're still moving. We're still
[1:59:08] getting
[1:59:10] stronger. Heaven
[1:59:12] bound. Hallelujah.
[1:59:16] We've got the
[1:59:21] power in the name of the
[1:59:26] [Music]
[1:59:28] Lord. Though Satan
[1:59:34] raes, we cannot be defeated.
[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:41] We've got the
[1:59:46] power in the name of the
[1:59:49] [Laughter]
[1:59:51] Lord. Can you give him a hand clap of
[1:59:55] praise? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I won't
[1:59:59] be shaken. I won't be
[2:00:01] moved. So I We better go down again. So
[2:00:06] So I won't be shamed.
[2:00:12] ten and I won't be
[2:00:16] [Music]
[2:00:18] moved. My God is
[2:00:22] faithful. Isn't he
[2:00:24] faithful? His promise is true.
[2:00:29] So I'll say to this
[2:00:35] mountain, not going to get in an
[2:00:37] atmosphere of doubt. I'll stay in an
[2:00:40] atmosphere of faith and speak the
[2:00:44] word.
[2:00:47] Hallelujah. Oh, sing it again now. Oh, I
[2:00:53] won't be shaking.
[2:00:58] I won't be
[2:01:02] moved. My God is
[2:01:08] faithful. His promise is
[2:01:13] true. I'll speak to this
[2:01:19] mountain. It's time to move.
[2:01:26] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[2:01:31] greater than
[2:01:36] you. Oh, now why should I worry when
[2:01:41] giants come calling my
[2:01:45] name? Hallelujah.
[2:01:49] My God is so much bigger than any
[2:01:53] trouble I
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:58] face for power or
[2:02:02] [Music]
[2:02:03] riches, inches or fame.
[2:02:07] [Music]
[2:02:11] of God is so much better than all of
[2:02:16] these
[2:02:19] things. My soul won't be
[2:02:24] [Music]
[2:02:25] shen. I won't be
[2:02:30] moved. For my God is
[2:02:36] faithful. His promise is true.
[2:02:42] So I'll say to this
[2:02:47] mountain, you got to
[2:02:53] move. My God is bigger, better,
[2:02:58] stronger, greater than. Sing that second
[2:03:02] verse.
[2:03:05] All my enemies scatter cuz they know.
[2:03:09] They
[2:03:11] know Satan was defeated at Calvary. He
[2:03:15] knows it's
[2:03:18] done. My my
[2:03:22] my.
[2:03:25] Yeah. Oh, he died for my ransom and rose
[2:03:31] up on the third day.
[2:03:37] Cuz my God is greater than death, hell,
[2:03:42] and the
[2:03:45] grave. And I won't be
[2:03:50] [Music]
[2:03:52] shen. I'm not going to be
[2:03:57] moved. My God is
[2:04:01] greater. His promise is
[2:04:07] true. So I speak to that
[2:04:13] mountain. It's time to
[2:04:18] move. My God is bigger, better,
[2:04:23] stronger, greater than
[2:04:27] you. Do you believe that this morning?
[2:04:32] Hallelujah. Now, think of it. Satan's
[2:04:35] already met the word. And he knows what
[2:04:38] that word will do. He knows he was
[2:04:41] defeated at Calvary. He knows that Jesus
[2:04:44] come and took the keys of death, hell,
[2:04:46] and the grave. He knows all these
[2:04:48] things. The prophet said he's just
[2:04:51] nothing but a bluff.
[2:04:53] If he could get you to believe
[2:04:55] differently, now he already knows what's
[2:04:57] true. But if he can get us to believe
[2:05:00] differently, Amen. then he can have his
[2:05:02] way with us because we allow him to do
[2:05:04] that. But we are now understanding the
[2:05:07] word. We are understanding by revelation
[2:05:11] that we rose with Jesus Christ. We
[2:05:15] conquered with him. He represented us.
[2:05:18] And there is nothing the devil can do
[2:05:20] anymore. We ain't going to believe his
[2:05:23] lies. We ain't going to believe his
[2:05:25] scandals. We ain't going to listen to
[2:05:27] that old stupid devil. Amen. And I'm so
[2:05:31] glad for that. We've already won.
[2:05:34] Hallelujah. And I'm I've already Amen.
[2:05:38] So the prophet said, "You're not going
[2:05:40] to be sons of God. You are sons of God
[2:05:43] now." Amen. So now we're living like
[2:05:46] sons of God. Acting like sons of God,
[2:05:49] speaking like sons of God. Can you say
[2:05:52] amen? Sons with authority. I uh enjoyed
[2:05:56] the message today and appreciate Brother
[2:06:01] Josh um delivering his heart to us and
[2:06:05] we want to just take it take it uh to
[2:06:08] heart and don't let the devil take it
[2:06:11] from us. Amen. And uh I'm so thankful
[2:06:15] for the word of life. Amen. That we can
[2:06:18] feed off of and we can defeat the devil
[2:06:22] with. And praise the Lord. I love the
[2:06:25] Lord. And uh just a reminder, the

[2:08:33] speakers and all that until
[2:08:35] tomorrow. And um we had a scare. We

[2:08:43] to have to drive all the way to South
[2:08:44] Carolina today to go pick everything up,
[2:08:47] but the Lord really worked that out. And
[2:08:51] um so we got to go pick everything up or

[2:08:54] Ron Oak in the morning. And uh so we'll
