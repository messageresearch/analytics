[41:43] I look to you,
[41:46] my rock, my healer.
[41:49] I trust in you.
[41:51] [Music]
[41:56] Oh yes, yes, yes. Well, aren't you glad
[41:59] the healer is here?
[42:02] We can trust him. Amen. With our lives,
[42:06] Amen. And um
[42:09] uh glad that we can look to him. Amen.
[42:13] And everything that we go through.
[42:15] Praise the Lord. And it's good to see
[42:18] everyone in the house of the Lord. Uh
[42:22] the musicians can be dismissed. Amen.
[42:27] And um the different ones that were sick
[42:31] over the weekend. Uh certainly good to
[42:33] have you all back and good to have
[42:35] brother Kevin back. Amen. and it was his
[42:38] birthday actually uh Sunday and um so we
[42:43] wish him a happy birthday and belated
[42:45] happy birthday I should say and it's
[42:48] sister Mindy's birthday today so we wish
[42:51] her a happy birthday and u I trust both
[42:56] a good day amen pray blesses them
[43:01] richly
[43:03] many more years until the Lord comes
[43:06] healthy years and uh wonderful years,
[43:10] right?
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so um if you uh have your
[43:16] Bibles, we're going to turn first of all
[43:19] to the mar to the book of Mark.
[43:23] Amen. The 11th chapter.
[43:32] very familiar scriptures and and you
[43:35] know the the the chapter. So, we're just
[43:38] going to break in
[43:40] and um
[43:44] Jesus had uh spoke to the fig tree,
[43:47] cursed it, and um they came by the next
[43:50] day and saw it withered away. And uh so
[43:55] the 22nd verse, Mark 11:22, and Jesus
[44:00] answering saith unto them, have faith in
[44:03] God. For verily I say unto you, that
[44:06] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[44:08] Be thou removed, and be thou cast into
[44:11] the sea, and shall not doubt in his
[44:14] heart,
[44:15] but shall believe that those things
[44:18] which he saith shall come to, he shall
[44:22] have whatsoever he saith.
[44:26] Therefore, I say unto you, what
[44:28] thingsoever you desire
[44:31] when you pray, believe that you receive
[44:34] them, and you shall have them. Then go
[44:38] to the 16th chapter.
[44:43] Amen. This is the great commission that
[44:46] Jesus left the church.
[44:49] 15th verse. And he said unto them, "Go
[44:51] ye into all the world, and preach the
[44:53] gospel to every creature.
[44:55] He that believeth and is baptized shall
[44:58] be saved."
[45:00] And again, he that believeth and is
[45:02] baptized shall be saved, but he that
[45:05] believeth not shall be damned. And these
[45:08] signs shall follow them that believe in
[45:11] my name. They shall cast out devils.
[45:13] They shall speak with new tongues. They
[45:16] shall take up serpents. And if they
[45:18] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[45:20] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[45:22] sick and they shall
[45:25] recover.
[45:27] Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in
[45:30] prayer. Amen. Father,
[45:35] we are just mortals,
[45:38] Lord. Um
[45:40] and we're in need of you.
[45:43] As your prophet told us, we could take
[45:46] our physical hands, physical strength,
[45:49] turn the pages and read the the words,
[45:54] Lord, uh with our natural eyes, but it
[45:57] would take you to give us the
[45:58] understanding.
[46:00] And Father, may you do that tonight. I
[46:03] pray that you would just just move among
[46:06] us this evening and bless your people
[46:09] not only here present but those that may
[46:12] be watching and Father may faith be
[46:17] uh uh risen in our heart
[46:21] father and that we can have a a deeper
[46:25] walk with you father that's our prayer
[46:28] that's what we long for we ask it in
[46:32] Jesus Christ's name and the church says
[46:36] &gt;&gt; amen. You can have your seats.
[46:39] Praise the Lord. And um so the my title
[46:45] uh is he uh uh healing is ours when we
[46:50] accept it. And this will be just
[46:53] something simple
[46:55] uh but I hope it will
[46:58] u help us and encourage.
[47:01] But it it does seem like sickness and
[47:04] disease is attacking the people of God.
[47:08] Um
[47:10] uh and and like never before as as we
[47:14] know there's there's all kinds of uh
[47:17] demonic powers and and it's not only
[47:21] just in the physical realm, it's the
[47:23] spiritual realm, it's the mental
[47:26] um and and in in the spirit. And so, um,
[47:31] brother Brandham in his prayer, he said,
[47:33] "We are a needy people." How many
[47:35] believes that?
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; We are, we are a needy people. We're
[47:39] walking in a dark world with a great
[47:43] enemy of yours that we could not combat
[47:47] him at all if it wasn't for your Holy
[47:50] Spirit. Therefore, we are trusting,
[47:53] believing, and acting in faith that
[47:58] he'll go before us and make the way
[48:00] clear. So many pitfalls along the road
[48:05] set for our weary feet, but we are
[48:08] trying to follow the bloody footprints
[48:10] of him who overcome death, hell, and the
[48:14] grave.
[48:16] So we are dependent on the Lord for
[48:19] everything that we have need of. Uh I
[48:22] think the longer that I live and and
[48:25] hopefully all of us is that way is uh we
[48:29] see just how small, how little, how
[48:31] helpless we are without the Lord. And
[48:35] and so uh this is exactly what God wants
[48:40] us to do is depend upon him
[48:43] &gt;&gt; uh in in every aspect of our life. And
[48:46] no matter how talented or skilled or
[48:49] smart or whatever uh the Bible says
[48:54] acknowledge the Lord in all thy ways and
[48:56] he shall direct your paths. and another
[49:00] uh place says, "Lean not unto thine own
[49:03] understanding, but in all thy ways
[49:06] acknowledge him." And so uh we know that
[49:11] uh he is our savior. Um but but not only
[49:15] our savior, but he is our redeemer and
[49:18] he's our healer. He's our provider. He's
[49:22] the way maker, our deliverer, our
[49:24] victory. And so this is why we pray to
[49:27] him uh because uh it's an acknowledgment
[49:32] that we need him. He's got the answer.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; And so we pray to him not just for mere
[49:39] ritual or something to do or it's just a
[49:42] Christian thing. Uh but but we truly
[49:46] believe that he has got what we have
[49:50] need of and and and he does. He's the
[49:54] one that can supply uh what is needed.
[49:58] So, so I I believe that the prayer of a
[50:01] Christian
[50:03] uh should have results. Do you believe
[50:05] that the prayer of a Christian should
[50:08] have results? It it should or we're just
[50:11] praying for not. If if prayer is simply
[50:15] just to to to have words and just a
[50:18] ritual that we go through, then then our
[50:22] prayer is nothing. It means nothing.
[50:24] That's right.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; But prayer is the channel in which we
[50:27] talk to God. We make our petition known
[50:31] and then that prayer should get results.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that's what the Bible says.
[50:39] God answers prayer. Do you believe that?
[50:42] And and so he answers prayer. Brother
[50:45] Ram said he answers every sincere prayer
[50:48] in his own way. So then in our prayer,
[50:53] we do not bind God. We do not uh uh
[50:56] attach strings to God and say, "Well,
[50:58] now this is the way it's got to be. This
[51:00] is when it's got to be done, how it's
[51:02] got to be done, where it's got to be."
[51:04] It it it we we do not put strings and
[51:07] and and and and limits on God,
[51:10] restrictions on God. We just make our
[51:13] petition known and then leave it up to
[51:16] God to answer the prayer any way he so
[51:19] chooses because he knows best. Ain't
[51:22] that right? And so God has a way of
[51:26] answering prayer. That's what the
[51:28] prophet says that God has a way of
[51:31] answering prayer. So as Christians we
[51:34] should expect results from our prayer.
[51:38] Amen. Uh every one of us we should if
[51:41] you prayed for it expect results. Amen.
[51:45] Uh uh that's the way it should be. Now
[51:48] there's nothing negative in
[51:50] Christianity. That's what the prophet
[51:52] said that it's all positive. Amen.
[51:56] Nothing negative in Christianity. And so
[51:59] when we pray, we're not praying to a
[52:01] heathen God. Amen. But we're praying to
[52:05] a living God who has made the promises
[52:09] and given us these promises. He's made
[52:12] promises. He's made them to us. Amen.
[52:16] And therefore, we should expect if we're
[52:20] praying to a dead god, then forget it.
[52:22] Just just go through ritual. Amen. But
[52:25] if you're if we're praying to the living
[52:28] God, then we must know and believe that
[52:31] God heareth us when we pray. God is not
[52:35] only able to answer our prayer, but he
[52:39] will answer them. Now the Bible says we
[52:42] are heirs of promise. How many believes
[52:44] that I am an heir of promise? So then
[52:49] every scripture in the Bible is
[52:51] promises. uh to name one. Psalms 103:2
[52:56] uh bless the Lord, oh my soul, and
[52:58] forget not all he
[53:02] uh who forgiveth all thine iniquities,
[53:06] who healeth all thy diseases. So this is
[53:10] a promise that we are heir to. Ain't
[53:12] that right? It's not just words written
[53:15] uh uh down for us to look at and wonder
[53:18] about, hope for. Amen. and ponder. But
[53:22] it's it's it's a promise that we should
[53:26] expect. We are heir to that. He is the
[53:29] God that healeth all my diseases and and
[53:33] forgiveth all mine iniquities. And so uh
[53:37] James another promise 5:14 is any sick
[53:41] among you? Let him call for the elders
[53:43] of the church and let them pray over him
[53:46] anointing him with oil in the name of
[53:50] the Lord. Ain't that right? And the
[53:52] prayer of faith shall save the sick.
[53:56] Ain't that right? So that's a promise.
[53:58] Amen. The prayer of faith shall save the
[54:01] sick and the Lord shall raise him up and
[54:04] if he have committed sins, they shall be
[54:07] forgiven him. So that's another promise
[54:10] that we are heir to. Now, brother
[54:13] Brandham, he would tell us every
[54:15] minister of the gospel has a right to
[54:18] pray for his congregation. And they have
[54:21] a right. Everybody say, "I have a
[54:23] right." They, you're the congregation.
[54:26] They have a right to believe God and be
[54:30] healed. So divine healing doesn't belong
[54:33] to one man or one group. It belongs to
[54:37] all the people. Ain't that right?
[54:40] another place he says there ought to be
[54:42] a healing campaign in every church all
[54:46] the time going on everywhere. So then
[54:51] then it's God's desire to heal. Amen.
[54:54] And and if God has commissioned us to
[54:57] come together as believers, then there's
[55:00] there there there should be a healing
[55:02] campaign going on. Amen. In other words,
[55:05] healing taking place and and
[55:08] deliverances taking place and and uh the
[55:12] move of God, amen, moving among the
[55:14] people of God. Ain't that right? Because
[55:17] wherever God is, a uh demons cannot
[55:20] stick around when the presence of God
[55:23] and and he promised that I'd be there
[55:26] where two or three are gathered in my
[55:28] name. Amen. I will be there in their
[55:31] midst. Ain't that right? So then the
[55:34] church of the living God has been
[55:35] commissioned to lay hands on the sick
[55:38] and and they shall uh recover. Amen.
[55:41] They've also the church of the living
[55:43] God has been commissioned. Amen. To cast
[55:46] out devils. Amen. These signs follow the
[55:49] believer. Amen. And so whatever devil
[55:52] you're facing with and dealing with or
[55:55] whatever, Amen. you have every right to
[55:58] cast that devil out.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. through your
[56:02] prayers. Amen. And and uh so we we know
[56:06] the prophet tells us that the word devil
[56:09] or demon is a means tormentor. That's
[56:12] the English word for demon is is is
[56:16] uh uh tormentor. And so we know that all
[56:19] the sickness comes from the devil. Amen.
[56:22] And and and so it's it's a tormenting
[56:25] spirit that afflicts our our body. Amen.
[56:29] And we know that there's sickness of the
[56:31] body, there's sickness of the soul,
[56:34] there's sickness of the mind. Amen. And
[56:36] and it's a tormentor. Amen. That that
[56:39] he's he's attacking in every way. Amen.
[56:42] The Bible or or brother Brandham says
[56:44] hell, the lid of hell has been lifted
[56:47] off and demons are pouring in. And so
[56:50] it's it's spirits of sickness. It's
[56:52] spirits of diseases of all kinds. And
[56:55] it's attacking uh uh because we're we're
[56:58] made up of body, soul, and spirit. Ain't
[57:00] that right? And and now there's one
[57:02] thing that he cannot touch if we're born
[57:05] again. And that's the soul. The soul is
[57:08] sealed off to where Satan cannot get to
[57:10] that. But but he attacks us in our mind.
[57:13] He attacks us in our body. He attacks us
[57:16] in in in any any other way. And but the
[57:19] Bible says, "Greater is he that is in
[57:22] you than he that is in the world." Ain't
[57:27] that right? So the world is getting
[57:29] wicked and and we know that. But the
[57:31] prophet says, "On the other hand, you
[57:33] fail to realize the church is getting
[57:35] more powerful
[57:37] &gt;&gt; all the time." And I just believe that.
[57:39] Ain't that right? And so uh uh this is
[57:43] why I believe that a Christian has
[57:45] authority a amen over every part of uh
[57:49] of of is he's like I said he's made up
[57:52] of three parts body soul and spirit. And
[57:55] he doesn't just have authority over the
[57:57] soul. He has an authority over his body.
[58:00] He has an authority over every part that
[58:04] Satan would try to hinder. Amen. Do you
[58:08] believe that? And so um now now people
[58:11] act as though you know God doesn't want
[58:14] to heal uh doesn't want to save doesn't
[58:19] doesn't want to deliver and and and they
[58:22] they they sometime maybe we we think
[58:25] that we have to beg God for things and
[58:28] that we have to get God's attention and
[58:31] somehow amen he just doesn't seem to be
[58:34] hearing our prayers and and all that but
[58:37] that's so far from the truth. truth.
[58:39] Amen. Uh the problem, you know, the
[58:42] prophet said there's a lot of
[58:43] Pentecostal chickens and not eagles.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a lot of Pentecostal
[58:48] chickens and the denominations are
[58:51] giving them chicken food. He says, you
[58:54] know, they give them chicken food,
[58:56] denominational creed. They lived on that
[59:00] and that's all they know. They're
[59:02] earthbound.
[59:04] Ain't that right? See, there there's
[59:06] people that go to church, they're
[59:07] earthbound. And and because they have
[59:10] been fed chicken feed, Amen. And and
[59:14] denominational creeds and they don't
[59:17] know how to raise their feet and rise in
[59:21] the presence of God and claim victory.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; They don't know how to shout the praises
[59:27] of God. They don't know how to accept
[59:31] divine healing.
[59:34] Now, now the prophet tells us that
[59:36] healing is simple.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Healing is very simple to accept, to
[59:40] take. But if people don't know how to
[59:43] accept that healing and he says, why is
[59:46] it? Is because of the way they've been
[59:49] taught, what they're feeding on.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He goes on down, I'm
[59:54] afraid that these big cities need a lot
[59:56] of teaching. I'm sure they're just
[59:58] worked up on emotions and so forth. So,
[1:00:01] they need real scriptural teaching on
[1:00:05] how to receive healing.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Now, we're not we're not eating chicken
[1:00:13] food. Not this message ain't chicken
[1:00:16] food. It's eagle food.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? It's eagle food. And
[1:00:21] so, therefore, we we are a different
[1:00:24] class of people. and and brother
[1:00:26] Brandham spent a great deal teaching us
[1:00:30] how to receive our healing.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so if if if God would send us
[1:00:37] a prophet, I thank God for opening the
[1:00:39] seals. I thank God for for you know the
[1:00:42] spiritual things that we have seen and
[1:00:44] and the spiritual signs. But but but a
[1:00:47] teaching that that God sent through that
[1:00:50] prophet and that is how to for us to
[1:00:54] receive our healing. Amen. Remember we
[1:00:57] were we were eating chicken food. We
[1:00:59] were we were all of these things and we
[1:01:01] didn't know we didn't know how to
[1:01:03] receive our creeds didn't help us and
[1:01:05] Pentecostal ideas didn't help us. But a
[1:01:09] message came along to help us, teach us
[1:01:14] to know how to receive our healing.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; So we need to take note as to what he
[1:01:19] taught. This message is important.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The message of the
[1:01:27] hour is important. Now in the message
[1:01:31] faith is the substance which is in 47 he
[1:01:34] said I'll try to explain to you the best
[1:01:36] of my knowledge the reason I'm here
[1:01:39] tonight and how that you must approach
[1:01:42] God uh uh to receive your healing. He
[1:01:46] said I've suffered much and I know what
[1:01:49] it is to be sick and I want to help you
[1:01:53] and I can if you'll just believe.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. So don't just listen to the message
[1:02:00] and just say, "Well, that's a good
[1:02:01] sermon." Da da da. And forget about what
[1:02:04] he's saying. Take in what he's saying.
[1:02:06] He says, "I can help you."
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; That wasn't just for that crowd in 1947.
[1:02:12] God left it on tapes
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; so he can help us
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; and teach us how to accept our healing.
[1:02:21] If the Bible says, "Greater is he that
[1:02:23] is in us than he that is in the world,"
[1:02:26] we're not a defeated people.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Now, our opening scriptures have
[1:02:32] something in common, and that is we must
[1:02:34] believe in order to get results.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Prayer is to get results. If you
[1:02:41] don't expect to get results in your
[1:02:43] prayer, don't worry about it. Don't
[1:02:44] pray. Uh you're just you're just as uh
[1:02:47] you're not getting anywhere. But when
[1:02:49] you pray, expect results. When you have
[1:02:52] the minister to pray, expect results.
[1:02:55] Amen. When when you gather in your home
[1:02:57] and you pray, expect results. Amen. It
[1:03:00] it it's just that simple. We ought to
[1:03:02] come to church expecting results. Do you
[1:03:05] believe that? Amen. If we don't expect
[1:03:07] results when we come to the house of
[1:03:09] God, well, then it ain't going to help
[1:03:11] us. But the word is us. The word is
[1:03:14] supposed to benefit us. Amen. Just like
[1:03:17] tonight, you're not here just gathering
[1:03:20] in vain. There's a word that is to help
[1:03:22] you expect the results of it.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Cuz even brother
[1:03:28] Brandham tells us we'll not leave a
[1:03:29] sermon uh the same way or a church
[1:03:31] service the same way. We'll either go
[1:03:33] out worse or we'll go out better. See,
[1:03:36] so we expect results when we come to the
[1:03:38] house of God. When we pray, we expect
[1:03:41] results. So we we find amen that no man
[1:03:44] can get anywhere with God without faith.
[1:03:48] So then believers expect results. Why
[1:03:51] does believers expect results? Because
[1:03:54] the word of God says
[1:03:56] they take God at his word.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; I can promise you something and you and
[1:04:02] you don't have every right to expect the
[1:04:04] results of that. I'm a man. I can fail.
[1:04:06] But God never fails. God never fails.
[1:04:10] Can you say that with me? God never
[1:04:12] fails. He will never ever ever fail.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; I can fail as a preacher. You can fail
[1:04:19] as a mother, as a father, as a deacon,
[1:04:21] as a singer, whatever. But God never
[1:04:24] fails.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; So therefore, believers expect results
[1:04:32] because God never fails and they take
[1:04:35] God at his word. Now the prophet said a
[1:04:39] believer is the seed of Abraham and and
[1:04:42] and so they act like he acted. He's the
[1:04:45] father of faith and and we are the royal
[1:04:48] seed. We are the seed of faith. His we
[1:04:51] come the offspring of his faith. Not a
[1:04:53] natural seed like the Jews. We are
[1:04:56] offspring of his faith. Ain't that
[1:04:58] right? He believed God. Amen. And and we
[1:05:01] are the offspring. And so therefore, we
[1:05:04] are the seed of Abraham. And we we have
[1:05:07] the same faith of Abraham. And as
[1:05:10] Abraham believed, so do we believe.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Now, God is is sovereign in all of his
[1:05:17] ways. You believe that.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Now, it's easy to say that, but we have
[1:05:22] to if he's sovereign, then we have to
[1:05:24] understand that that he doesn't work
[1:05:26] when we want him to work. He doesn't he
[1:05:28] doesn't he he's sovereign. We can't tell
[1:05:31] him what to do. We can't rule him. We
[1:05:33] can't toss him around. Nobody orders
[1:05:36] God.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; He's sovereign.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; But he is tied to his word,
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; obligated to his word. Ain't that right?
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; So now he works. God being sovereign
[1:05:48] works in many different ways. Uh and and
[1:05:52] this is why we see miracles and we see
[1:05:56] healings. We see miracles, we see
[1:05:59] healings. And and and the prophet taught
[1:06:02] us there's a difference in in receiving
[1:06:04] a miracle and receiving a healing. Ain't
[1:06:08] that right? A miracle is done
[1:06:11] spontaneous.
[1:06:12] It's uh it's it's it's it's done
[1:06:14] immediately.
[1:06:16] You know, we can uh uh uh brother Amos,
[1:06:19] you could be blind and and you come up
[1:06:22] for prayer, we lay hands on you and and
[1:06:24] and all of a sudden your eyes come open.
[1:06:26] That's a miracle. It was done
[1:06:28] immediately. Ain't that right? Amen. But
[1:06:31] then divine healing is a miracle as
[1:06:34] well, but it is a process.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So now, Brother Bram
[1:06:43] says, if you had a cut on your hand and
[1:06:45] you done everything for it and nothing,
[1:06:48] it just keeps getting worse. See, after
[1:06:51] a while, you put something on your hand
[1:06:53] and it be to help it. It didn't get
[1:06:56] well. It's getting well. Everybody say
[1:06:59] it's getting well. It didn't get well.
[1:07:03] You got a cut. You put something on it
[1:07:05] and it starts mending. It starts getting
[1:07:07] better. Well, it didn't get well. It's
[1:07:11] getting well.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; But you can't say, "Well, I'm not well.
[1:07:18] I'm not well. I'm not I don't know what
[1:07:20] I'm going to do. I I just don't know."
[1:07:22] But if you're starting to see results,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; If if there's something there, you know
[1:07:27] that the medicine's helping,
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; then then you know it's getting well. So
[1:07:32] now, Brother Brandham says, and I want
[1:07:34] you to really listen to this. When the
[1:07:38] curse of sickness is taken off of you,
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; it's not every time a miracle,
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; right? Not every time it's a miracle.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; But now the the curse of sickness when
[1:07:54] you pray
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; when that believer prays and you rebuke
[1:08:00] that spirit.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; It's done.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; It's done.
[1:08:10] But now we we find there are times again
[1:08:14] that it happens the the miracle or the
[1:08:17] uh the that you you get uh spontaneous
[1:08:20] results. I'm as glad for them.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; You bet. But sometimes the prophet says
[1:08:27] the curse is just gone and the cure
[1:08:30] follows it.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; The curse is gone. Good.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; When you pray,
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; you believe it. You've spoken.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; You have every right to cast that devil
[1:08:46] out.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; And the curse is broken,
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; but the cure follows.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] So
[1:08:58] many times people easily stumble
[1:09:02] at when they when they pray for God to
[1:09:06] heal them and they don't see a
[1:09:07] spontaneous miracle. Then they tend to
[1:09:11] think that God isn't answering the
[1:09:12] prayer. God didn't hear that prayer. So
[1:09:14] we got to pray again and we got to pray
[1:09:16] again and we got to pray again and and
[1:09:18] and somehow one of these days he's going
[1:09:21] to hear my prayer.
[1:09:24] Don't you believe he didn't hear that?
[1:09:26] He heard you.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Did he not hear you the first time you
[1:09:29] you prayed?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother Sean.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Did he tell us how many times did we got
[1:09:33] to pray? He just said, "Pray."
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Whatever you ask for, if you believe it,
[1:09:37] you'll have whatever you desire. If
[1:09:39] you'll believe it, you'll have it.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, so see, so they
[1:09:46] they tend to and and this is human and
[1:09:48] and this is where we needed teaching
[1:09:53] to show us how to receive our healing.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; So, we tend to think that God isn't
[1:10:03] hearing our prayer or that he doesn't
[1:10:07] want to heal.
[1:10:09] I want it, but God ain't answering. He
[1:10:11] just doesn't seem to be helping me. I
[1:10:13] don't know if he wants me to be healed.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; I just don't know. I I don't know where
[1:10:18] I'm at. You know, I'm here struggling
[1:10:20] and God somewhere's up there doing
[1:10:22] something else and making revivals for
[1:10:25] everybody else and I'm suffering and I
[1:10:27] prayed, I begged, I'm I keep praying.
[1:10:30] I've been prayed a thousand times and
[1:10:32] and I just don't know what to do. I what
[1:10:34] what else, you know? Well, see, the
[1:10:37] prophet says I can I tell you what the
[1:10:38] prophet says. He's more more willing
[1:10:41] He's more willing to heal every person
[1:10:44] in the tent tonight, in this building
[1:10:46] tonight, wherever. He's more willing to
[1:10:49] heal than you are willing to be healed.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; You're the one that's in pain.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; You're the one that's suffering. You're
[1:10:58] the one whatever and you want to be
[1:11:00] healed.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; But no matter how much you desire to be
[1:11:03] healed, God wants to heal you more than
[1:11:04] you're you want to you want to be
[1:11:06] healed.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Now, that's what a prophet said. He's
[1:11:09] more willing to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:11:10] than you are to receive it.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet said he's here. He's here to
[1:11:17] heal the sick and afflicted. Another
[1:11:19] place he's here to heal every sick
[1:11:22] person right now.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Want you to understand way off the wild
[1:11:28] blue yonder. He's right here.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He says in another
[1:11:35] place, there is nothing impossible with
[1:11:37] him and he will bless you greatly if
[1:11:40] you'll just let him do it.
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Another place says there's no need for
[1:11:47] the daughter of God's church to be
[1:11:49] laying sick with sin. There's no need of
[1:11:53] unbelief in the church. We should have
[1:11:57] all of that out. We've seen God do too
[1:12:01] much in this age.
[1:12:03] We've seen God. We a prophet stood on
[1:12:05] this earth and declared his presence is
[1:12:08] among us.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So there we should
[1:12:13] have all the unbelief out with these new
[1:12:16] things that God sending us. We could
[1:12:19] reach up right up and grab it and say,
[1:12:22] "Amen." Walk right away with it. There's
[1:12:26] plenty of bomb in Gilead.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Jesus says, "Ask." Everybody
[1:12:33] say, "Ask."
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Ask and you shall receive.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Now come on church. We know what English
[1:12:40] means.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Not ask and you might receive. Not ask
[1:12:44] and I hope you'll receive it. You know,
[1:12:46] I'll tell you to ask and good luck.
[1:12:49] Ask and you shall receive that your joy
[1:12:54] may be full. This is the God of heaven
[1:12:57] coming in human flesh and giving us a
[1:13:00] promise. and you're heir to that.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 3:20, it says, "Now unto him
[1:13:09] that is able to do exceeding
[1:13:13] abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:13:16] think according to the power that
[1:13:19] workketh in us."
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Dy's not in heaven. It's in us. Right?
[1:13:24] It's in every believer. That's
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; so the power that workketh in us,
[1:13:28] there's got to be a power working. And
[1:13:30] that power works by faith.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; And he's able to do anything abundantly.
[1:13:36] Anything that we ask or think according
[1:13:38] to the power that workketh in us.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; If that power is laying dormant, you
[1:13:43] ain't going to get nothing. But if that
[1:13:45] power is working by faith, he's able to
[1:13:49] do exceeding abundantly all that you ask
[1:13:51] or think.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:56] Now if if we don't have the immediate
[1:13:59] results
[1:14:02] then again we tend to think that we need
[1:14:05] to go through another prayer line. Well
[1:14:07] I I got prayed for last year and they're
[1:14:10] having another prayer line. So I'm going
[1:14:12] to go back into it because I didn't get
[1:14:14] healed on this other one. And so um uh
[1:14:18] you know so so I need I need to go you
[1:14:21] know to another or or they say well I
[1:14:23] got prayed for by brother so and so but
[1:14:25] nothing really happened there. I'm going
[1:14:26] to go I'm going to go to another brother
[1:14:28] so and so and maybe he'll he'll help me.
[1:14:31] Now you understand brother Brandham
[1:14:32] dealt with that with the Pentecostals.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; They they would bounce from old Roberts
[1:14:37] then they'd go to Jack Co. then they'd
[1:14:39] go well in order. You know what I mean?
[1:14:41] But they they would go to TL Osborne,
[1:14:43] then they'd go to this, then they go to
[1:14:45] brother Brandham's meetings, then they'd
[1:14:46] just bounce and then and well, I got
[1:14:48] prayed for over here, and I didn't get
[1:14:49] nothing, so I'll go over here. I didn't
[1:14:51] get nothing, so I'll go over here. They
[1:14:53] didn't know how to receive their
[1:14:55] healing.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Now, in a prayer line, Brother Brandon
[1:15:01] prays for a lady saying, "Father, in the
[1:15:04] name of Jesus Christ, may my sister be
[1:15:06] healed." Now I pray for her through that
[1:15:10] allsufficient name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:15:12] Amen. Notice what he says to her after
[1:15:16] the prayer. Go rejoicing. Everybody say,
[1:15:20] "Go rejoicing."
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Saying, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord."
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell her she was healed.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; He told her, "Go rejoice and send thank
[1:15:32] you, Lord."
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; He's teaching how to receive healing.
[1:15:37] Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Then he addresses the congregation. Now,
[1:15:40] what I don't get is why you don't
[1:15:44] rejoice and praise God when you come
[1:15:46] through.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Why in the world are you coming through?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Why are you coming through the prayer
[1:15:51] line?
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; See, and so he said, "Why don't you just
[1:15:55] rejoice and praise God when you come
[1:15:57] through?" Now, that's what I can't
[1:15:59] understand, church. Don't you know that
[1:16:01] God's just as much God one time as he is
[1:16:05] another?
[1:16:06] Now, someone said to me not long ago
[1:16:08] said, "I don't understand it." Well, now
[1:16:10] listen. You know I'm not balling you
[1:16:12] out, don't you? He said, "You know I'm
[1:16:15] trying to get a truth over to you." Do
[1:16:17] you believe that? You realize that? See?
[1:16:20] Well, he said there wasn't a one pass,
[1:16:22] but what I seen, what was wrong with
[1:16:25] them? There wasn't one that come through
[1:16:27] the land, which what I seen. If I start
[1:16:29] into a vision, what does it do? It just
[1:16:32] scatters them. There you are. See, the
[1:16:34] people go by, the people go by and
[1:16:37] they'll come by and say, "Yeah, yeah."
[1:16:39] And you catch it. See, he says, "See,
[1:16:42] they say, "Well, no, I never got it."
[1:16:45] That's the reason they give prayer
[1:16:47] cards.
[1:16:51] Cuz if you don't, you'll come right back
[1:16:53] in the line again, and then you'll come
[1:16:55] back again. He says it just weakens your
[1:16:59] faith. Each time you get weaker and
[1:17:02] weaker, weaker and weaker.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So if they didn't get
[1:17:07] immediate results the first time, then
[1:17:09] they go back around back in the line.
[1:17:11] Then they get prayed for again and they
[1:17:12] need to get the results again. So they
[1:17:14] go right back again. So he had to have
[1:17:17] prayer cards so to keep all that from
[1:17:19] happening.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, so we get prayed
[1:17:24] for and then we judge whether we are
[1:17:28] healed or not by our symptoms.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; We we we come to get prayed for as it's
[1:17:42] like rubbing a rabbit's foot
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; for good luck.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:47] And then when we don't get what a
[1:17:50] spontaneous result, then we like, well,
[1:17:54] I don't well, one of these days. One of
[1:17:57] these days, right? See, and we're all
[1:18:00] guilty of it. See, so now Pentecostals
[1:18:03] judge the result of their healing by how
[1:18:06] they feel instead of looking at the word
[1:18:09] of God. Promises don't shift. Promises
[1:18:13] of God don't change. It's exactly the
[1:18:16] way God said it.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham, he was over at um
[1:18:23] uh the the brother in Chicago, Joseph,
[1:18:26] just had a meeting. He had a he had a
[1:18:28] week full week of gospel teaching on how
[1:18:31] to be healed.
[1:18:33] And so, Brother Brown says, "I wanted to
[1:18:35] go and f go to brother Joseph and find
[1:18:39] get a report to see how many went away
[1:18:42] last night
[1:18:44] saying, "Well,
[1:18:47] I still got it." Now, he just went
[1:18:50] through a whole week of teaching
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; on how to be healed.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; And he says, you know, that they all
[1:18:57] come back in and they didn't get the
[1:18:59] immediate results. Well,
[1:19:03] I still got it. He says, "And you'll
[1:19:06] probably always have it if you feel that
[1:19:08] way."
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; See, so so they weren't accepting their
[1:19:14] healing
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; because they were looking for immediate
[1:19:17] results.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; So when you pray, you must believe that
[1:19:27] God answered your prayer. the moment you
[1:19:30] prayed.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Whether you see results or not,
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; yeah.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham says, "If quickly
[1:19:40] you receive it and accept him and praise
[1:19:42] him and say, "Thank you, Lord. Let it be
[1:19:45] done."
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Walk right out of the building tonight
[1:19:49] perfectly well.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Well, that's good. That's that's the way
[1:19:52] we'd like things, just spontaneous.
[1:19:55] But if you're not, you're as good as
[1:19:59] well if you've accepted your healing in
[1:20:02] the seed form by the word.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; So whether you you got immediate results
[1:20:12] or whether you just got prayed for, you
[1:20:15] do not see no results, you're healed
[1:20:19] just as much as the one that got the
[1:20:22] immediate results.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; True. True,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; If you accept it in seed form.
[1:20:33] So don't forget, you rule by the word.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; You rule. Everybody say, I rule
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; by the word.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Word.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; I have dominion.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. I have dominion.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; By the word.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Not by my feelings. I do not rule by my
[1:20:50] feelings. I do not rule by my s
[1:20:53] symptoms. I do not rule by nothing else
[1:20:55] but by the word of God. God gave me the
[1:20:58] word to rule
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; to have dominion right
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; over every devil. I don't care what
[1:21:03] devil you're facing. You have the
[1:21:05] authority by the word and the word only.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now remember, brother Ram talked
[1:21:12] about the adoption and we believe that
[1:21:14] we're in that age of adoption and the
[1:21:17] child comes into adoption and uh because
[1:21:21] he's shown he is proven to be about the
[1:21:24] father's business
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; and and th this child uh he comes into
[1:21:30] adoption because he conducts himself the
[1:21:32] way the father conducts himself. He
[1:21:34] thinks the way the father thinks. He
[1:21:36] handles himself the way the father
[1:21:38] handles. You know, he handles situations
[1:21:41] the way the father handles situations.
[1:21:43] He believes like the father believes.
[1:21:46] Ain't that right?
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; See, and so his character and his
[1:21:50] behavior is molded by the tutor's
[1:21:53] teaching.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm going to say it because I
[1:21:58] believe with all my heart, this message
[1:22:00] is the message of the tutor.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; It is not brother Brandham's message.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was just the
[1:22:07] instrument.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. It was God speaking
[1:22:09] through that man.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; This message is the tutor.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; So there was people that didn't know how
[1:22:15] to receive their healing. Pentecostals
[1:22:16] and all the denominations. They didn't
[1:22:18] know how. But it was time for adoption.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; It was time for the sons of God to be
[1:22:23] made manifest. And so there had to be a
[1:22:25] tutor to teach us sons and daughters on
[1:22:29] how to handle things.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Surely.
[1:22:34] So the tutor gives the child tests to
[1:22:38] see how he does. Uh the Bible says every
[1:22:41] son that cometh to God must be chasened,
[1:22:44] tried, chastised.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; And if if if if he can't stand ch stand
[1:22:53] chastisement, correction,
[1:22:55] then the the Bible says he's a a bastard
[1:22:58] child. He's he's illegitimate. what he
[1:23:00] said.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; See, so the prophet said, "God tries
[1:23:03] you."
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; So can you say that with me? God tries
[1:23:06] me.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; God tries me. You You cannot be a son or
[1:23:10] daughter of God without chastisement.
[1:23:12] And and we know that God does not God
[1:23:15] does not uh uh uh correct us or he in
[1:23:19] other words he sends us through things
[1:23:21] just as that tutor sent the son that
[1:23:25] child through testings and trials to see
[1:23:29] how he would conduct himself.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, Brother Bram says,
[1:23:34] "If we walk up and say, I believe that
[1:23:36] Jesus Christ is the son of God, that he
[1:23:39] died for my sins and rose again the
[1:23:40] third day. He was wounded for my
[1:23:42] transgressions, bruised for my
[1:23:44] iniquities, the chastisement of my peace
[1:23:46] was upon him, and with his stripes I am
[1:23:49] healed." When you say that with a
[1:23:51] confess all your sins and your
[1:23:53] iniquities and your abilities and all
[1:23:55] that you have, lay it on the altar. Then
[1:23:58] there's nothing uh uh there there with
[1:24:01] nothing in your arms. Satan's going to
[1:24:04] shoot every dart at you. He can
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; when you confess that he's your Lord and
[1:24:11] Savior and you confess that Jesus Christ
[1:24:14] is my healer. He is my redeemer. Satan
[1:24:18] is going to shoot every dart.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; He says, "But then if you turn aside
[1:24:27] from that," now remember because Job is
[1:24:29] our example. Job's our example. God let
[1:24:33] Satan at Job. God let Satan inflict Job
[1:24:38] with with sufferings.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Yes,
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; he did. See? So, so when Satan is
[1:24:45] shooting darts at you, don't you think
[1:24:48] he's doing something outside of God's
[1:24:50] permission?
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; It's a test.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Sure is.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "But then if you turn aside
[1:24:59] from that and say, well, maybe I didn't
[1:25:01] get saved. Maybe I didn't get healed."
[1:25:04] Then turn away from that. The Bible says
[1:25:07] you are illegitimate children and not
[1:25:09] the children of God.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; He goes on, God sends those trials to
[1:25:16] test you, to prove you, to shake you up,
[1:25:20] and to give you a new hold.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; You remember, there is no weapon formed
[1:25:27] against you that's going to prosper.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; That's a promise.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; That is what we are heir to.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; So, you remember we talked about Abraham
[1:25:37] being the father of faith and and we
[1:25:39] being his seed. Brother Bram said, "If
[1:25:41] we are if our father," speaking of
[1:25:44] Abraham, "usted God and took a promise
[1:25:47] and impossibility
[1:25:49] and held on to it for 25 years before
[1:25:52] there was ever it was ever manifested,
[1:25:55] getting stronger all the time, his faith
[1:25:58] getting stronger. See, his seeds just
[1:26:01] like the father. No matter what happens,
[1:26:05] when we're prayed for, it's settled."
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Absolutely.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; The power of prayer
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; church. There's a power in prayer.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; We ain't just going through the motions.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; If God said it, we can believe it. It
[1:26:22] settles it.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; So he says, see, when we get everything
[1:26:25] out of the way, met all requirements,
[1:26:28] get everything out of the way, then ask
[1:26:30] God and stand there knowing you're going
[1:26:32] to receive it.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Now, he says, God tested Job like that.
[1:26:39] He tried Job
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; and see what kind of a reaction he would
[1:26:43] find in him. But when he took his sheep,
[1:26:46] took his ox, took his camels, took his
[1:26:49] children, I'll see what Job says now.
[1:26:52] See, and he and Job said, "The Lord gave
[1:26:56] the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the
[1:26:58] name of the Lord." The prophet said God
[1:27:01] found what he had told Satan he had in
[1:27:05] Job. None like him on the earth.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; And I believe there is a people that God
[1:27:12] is telling the devil there's none like
[1:27:14] them in this leoty and age. None like
[1:27:17] them. Go ahead, try it. Amen. And he he
[1:27:20] allows the devil to shoot darts at us
[1:27:22] and all that. But we've been taught by
[1:27:25] the tutor. Amen. And we're standing
[1:27:28] there. We think like the father. We're
[1:27:30] acting like the father. We're handling
[1:27:32] it like a father. like our father.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; So as the child goes through testings,
[1:27:42] the tutor starts to see the father in
[1:27:45] the child's conduct and behavior.
[1:27:48] He starts seeing the mirror of the
[1:27:50] father.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Like wow, that's exactly like you know
[1:27:55] Jim Bob would do. Oh, he'd be proud of
[1:27:58] his son.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; And he sends off the the report to the
[1:28:03] father. See, and and so therefore
[1:28:06] through the testings we are resting in
[1:28:09] the same word that our heavenly father
[1:28:12] rested in when he said, "Let there be."
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Remember, all of God's works was
[1:28:19] finished before the foundation of the
[1:28:21] world,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he rested.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Why? Resting in his own word. Now that
[1:28:30] word is in every son and daughter of God
[1:28:33] that when you speak,
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; you got to rest.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Got to rest.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:28:44] notice, Brother Bram said, you don't
[1:28:46] have to wait now for an evangelistic
[1:28:48] service or a person coming through
[1:28:50] praying for the sick. You have a right
[1:28:53] yourself.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; The greatest thing that God gave the
[1:28:56] world outside Jesus Christ is the Bible.
[1:28:59] Do you know what? The word of God will
[1:29:02] defeat the devil any place. Everybody
[1:29:04] say any place.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Anywhere.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Anytime.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; On his own ground.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Bring it on, devil.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; I'll defeat you anywhere, anytime, any
[1:29:17] place, on your own grounds.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Why? We've been given the word.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to be honest. I I just
[1:29:25] thank God for the message. The tutor is
[1:29:28] the one that gave us the word.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; If it hadn't been for a prophet come to
[1:29:32] the earth, we'd just have creeds.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And we certainly couldn't defeat the
[1:29:36] devil on that. It never would bring the
[1:29:38] manifestation of sons of God. But this
[1:29:40] message is bringing on the
[1:29:41] manifestations of sons of God.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Do did you know that the
[1:29:50] word of God alone Jesus made it so
[1:29:53] simple
[1:29:55] until the weakest Christian could do it?
[1:29:57] Gord.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Another place, Brother Bram says
[1:30:04] healing is when you in your heart know
[1:30:06] that God has done it for you and nothing
[1:30:08] can wave from it.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; And that's when you're going to get
[1:30:11] healed. You're going to get well.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Going to get well. Can you say amen?
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Can't look at the symptoms. Can't look
[1:30:18] at the negatives. Can't look at all that
[1:30:20] stuff. I mean, it may even get worse,
[1:30:22] but in in in your heart, you know it's
[1:30:24] done. It's settled. I'm a son of God.
[1:30:26] I'm a daughter of God. I will not
[1:30:28] question God's intentions. I will not
[1:30:31] question his motives, his sovereignty.
[1:30:33] All I know is I done exactly what he
[1:30:35] told me to do and it's done.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Did you know that Jesus we've said it
[1:30:43] before, but Jesus didn't always perform
[1:30:46] uh spontaneous miracles on on on the
[1:30:49] people?
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. uh John 4:46 it says there was a
[1:30:53] certain nobleman whose son was sick at
[1:30:56] Capernaum when he had heard when he
[1:30:59] heard that Jesus was come out of Judea
[1:31:01] into Galilee he went unto him and
[1:31:03] besought him that he would come down and
[1:31:05] heal his son for he was at the point of
[1:31:07] death and Jesus said unto him except you
[1:31:09] see signs and wonders you will not
[1:31:11] believe the nobleman saith unto him sir
[1:31:14] come down my child die lest my child die
[1:31:18] and Jesus sth unto him, "Go thy way, thy
[1:31:22] son liveth."
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't even go down there.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Thy son liveth." Then
[1:31:32] inquired this man of them the hour when
[1:31:35] he began to amend, right? Or actually he
[1:31:39] says, "Yeah, uh uh I I skipped." Jesus
[1:31:43] saith unto him, "Go thy way. Thy son
[1:31:45] liveth." And the man believed the word
[1:31:47] that Jesus had spoken unto him.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; And he went his way. And as he was going
[1:31:54] uh uh now going down back home, his
[1:31:57] servants met him and told him, saying,
[1:32:00] Thy son liveth.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Then he acquired of them the hour when
[1:32:04] he began to amend. And they said unto
[1:32:06] him, "Yesterday, at the seventh hour,
[1:32:08] the fever left him." So the father knew
[1:32:11] that it was at the same hour in which
[1:32:14] Jesus said unto him, "Thy son liveth."
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; And he began to amend.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; He didn't jump out of bed and say,
[1:32:24] "Woohoo." It wasn't spontaneous. But the
[1:32:27] word had already gone forth, thy son
[1:32:29] liveth.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; It was as good as done.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, so the prophet
[1:32:35] said, "Now the man wanted Jesus to come
[1:32:36] to his house and heal the boy." But
[1:32:38] Jesus didn't grant him his request.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; But yet he believed what Jesus said was
[1:32:46] the truth.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Thy son liveth.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Well, what about us?
[1:32:53] Well, we have the promise in 1 Peter
[1:32:55] 2:24. Who is he? Who his own self bear
[1:33:00] our sins in his own body on the tree
[1:33:04] that we being dead to sin should live
[1:33:06] unto righteousness by whose stripes you
[1:33:11] were were
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; healed.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Were healed.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Now, there is just as much power in that
[1:33:21] promise
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; as there was in the words that Jesus
[1:33:24] said to that man, "Thy son liveth."
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; I thank God for spontaneous miracles,
[1:33:37] and I think we've all had them
[1:33:40] in in throughout our life.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; But notice what Brother Brandham said.
[1:33:47] If God come down and healed me positive,
[1:33:50] right out with a miracle, it wouldn't be
[1:33:53] as great
[1:33:55] as it would if I can see the promise of
[1:33:58] God. Take it into my heart and stand
[1:34:02] there. I can say Jesus is now healing me
[1:34:06] for I have accepted his word. It's in my
[1:34:09] heart. He is now interceding for me
[1:34:12] before the father. I shall be well.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; There's what God loves.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Is standing there on his word and say
[1:34:24] it's right. He's healing me now every
[1:34:28] day.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; That's greater
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; than for God to come down and instantly
[1:34:35] heal you.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Hello. because you're being tested and
[1:34:40] you're proving that you believe God,
[1:34:43] that you're taking God at his word.
[1:34:45] You're disregarding symptoms and the
[1:34:48] pain and and and the feelings and
[1:34:51] everything and you're standing on thus
[1:34:53] sayith the Lord. He's healing me. I
[1:34:55] shall be well. I don't care what you're
[1:34:57] saying, Satan. I don't care about the
[1:34:59] thoughts. I don't care how I feel. God's
[1:35:02] word is right.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:35:07] So
[1:35:10] when when we are sick or we've got a
[1:35:13] need,
[1:35:16] I'll ask you when we pray,
[1:35:22] are we looking for a spontaneous miracle
[1:35:27] or are we just simply praying because
[1:35:30] God said to ask
[1:35:32] and we shall receive?
[1:35:36] Hello.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:35:41] I I I think we should get prayed for
[1:35:44] simply
[1:35:46] because it's in God's word.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; We should get prayed for simply because
[1:35:55] it's in God's word.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Not because I'm looking for a certain
[1:36:00] way. I'm not judging all of that. God
[1:36:03] said to ask and I'm going to ask. The
[1:36:06] prophet said ask for big things. Did he
[1:36:08] not?
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; So you cannot ask too big for God to
[1:36:12] where God says that's enough.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Ask abundantly.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; But don't judge it and don't try to make
[1:36:20] God do something you want him to do.
[1:36:23] Just follow his word. Ask. Doubt not.
[1:36:28] You shall receive.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:33] Can you say amen?
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; So, it shouldn't disappoint us when we
[1:36:37] pray and we don't see immediate results.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't act as though God didn't
[1:36:44] hear our prayer.
[1:36:47] Whether God answers our prayer in the
[1:36:49] way of a miracle or a healing, that
[1:36:52] shouldn't concern us. We know that it's
[1:36:56] already done.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:01] Can you say amen?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; So notice when we when we speak to the
[1:37:05] mountain as Jesus said, if you say to
[1:37:07] this mountain, be thou be thou removed
[1:37:09] and doubt not. So when we speak to the
[1:37:12] mountain, are we expecting immediate
[1:37:13] results? Is that where our faith is?
[1:37:15] Well, then I got to see it move
[1:37:16] immediately.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; But what did Jesus mean when he said,
[1:37:23] "If you shall say to this mountain, be
[1:37:25] thou removed, be thou cast in the sea,
[1:37:28] and it shall be done." The prophet says,
[1:37:30] "You look at the mountain and say, be
[1:37:33] thou lifted up and thrown into the sea,
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; and then in your heart believe that what
[1:37:40] you have said is taking place."
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; That's all you got to do.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; You spoke it.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; You're a son and daughter of God.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; You got the word. You're an heir to
[1:37:54] promise.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; So, all you've got to do is just
[1:37:58] believe. That's your That's what we're
[1:38:00] responsible for is believe it and speak
[1:38:03] it or speak it and believe it.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Believing
[1:38:10] it's already being done.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Maybe he says, he goes on, maybe just
[1:38:15] one little grain of sand,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; one little bitty grain of sand began to
[1:38:21] move through the whole mountain. Come
[1:38:23] on.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; You might not be able to notice it, but
[1:38:28] there's something in your heart says
[1:38:30] it's being done.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; You shall have what you say. That's the
[1:38:37] faith.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; He said many of us are prayed for at
[1:38:41] night. The next morning, we say, "Well,
[1:38:43] there's no difference. I don't feel any
[1:38:45] different." That's where we are failing,
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Why? Too much uh uh chicken feet.
[1:38:53] Come on now.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "See, we get prayed for the
[1:38:59] next morning." Well, there's no
[1:39:00] difference. I I don't feel any
[1:39:01] different. That's where we are failing.
[1:39:03] That that doesn't have to show one
[1:39:06] thing.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; But if thou believest in thine heart
[1:39:11] that what you say is being done, you
[1:39:14] shall have what you say. That's it.
[1:39:18] If you believe that what you say is
[1:39:20] already taking place, I don't have to
[1:39:23] feel it or see it. I believe it. And
[1:39:27] that's the reason it's taking place.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; You believe it.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; He says you'll have the desires of your
[1:39:36] heart.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Well, what if I confess and it just
[1:39:41] doesn't happen? Then I'm going to be
[1:39:42] embarrassed. Oh, no. No. That's the
[1:39:45] wrong way to think. Right.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Not taking God at his word.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; You're not looking at yourself as the
[1:39:50] power that you have as a son of God.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; If I'm taking God at his word, then you
[1:39:56] think God's going to disappoint.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; No, he won't.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; I hope this is all right.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; This just come from a burden.
[1:40:07] One time a man in Houston went through a
[1:40:09] prayer line and brother Bram talks about
[1:40:11] it and he says we had a line just coming
[1:40:15] through like we did last night saying
[1:40:17] God bless you had a little prayer and
[1:40:19] this man passed through and he was
[1:40:21] jerking so I don't know if he had pausy
[1:40:23] I don't know if he had what dad's got
[1:40:24] Parkinson's or whatever but he was
[1:40:26] jerking like this and he passed through
[1:40:29] and there had been a woman in a slow
[1:40:30] line down there that had been healed
[1:40:32] with a go go goer and she had an
[1:40:37] umbrella walking up and down the street
[1:40:39] screaming and going on. A little fella
[1:40:42] passed by. I said, "God bless you, my
[1:40:44] brother. You believe?" He said, "With
[1:40:46] all my heart." I said, "Go home now.
[1:40:49] Your faith will make you whole." Passed
[1:40:52] on by like that. And here he come back
[1:40:55] around in the line. He said, "Brother
[1:40:56] Bram, you told me I was healed and I'm
[1:40:58] still jerking." I said, "Brother, you
[1:41:01] told me you believed me." He said, "I
[1:41:03] do." He said, I said, "You're not acting
[1:41:05] like it." I said, 'You're to believe
[1:41:07] what I told you.' He said, 'Well, I do
[1:41:10] believe it.' I said, ' Then why are you
[1:41:12] coming back telling me you wasn't
[1:41:13] healed? See how easy it is? See? He
[1:41:16] said, "Well, Brother Brandham said, am I
[1:41:19] healed then?" I said, "Yes, sir. Just as
[1:41:22] you believe you are."
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Now, this isn't just healing. This goes
[1:41:26] for everything.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; There's some of you that that that are
[1:41:30] praying for your wayward children. It's
[1:41:32] got to be the same way. You're praying
[1:41:35] for your spouse. It's got to be the same
[1:41:37] way.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; See, so so he says, "What? What? Wh Why
[1:41:42] are you coming back and and and telling
[1:41:44] me you wasn't healed?" See how easy it
[1:41:47] is? He said, "Well, Brother Brandham, am
[1:41:48] I healed then?" I said, "Yes, sir. Just
[1:41:50] as you believe you are, did you believe
[1:41:53] he heard my prayer?" He told me if I'd
[1:41:56] be sincere when I prayed, get the people
[1:41:59] to believe me that nothing would stand
[1:42:02] before the prayer. You believe that?
[1:42:04] That's why Brother Bram said, "You got
[1:42:05] to have faith in the in the confidence
[1:42:06] in your pastor,
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; right?"
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Because he said, "If you ain't got
[1:42:10] confidence, then he ain't going to help
[1:42:12] you.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; You pray whatever. He ain't going to
[1:42:14] help you." Well, we got to have
[1:42:16] confidence in one another just as much.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; This is why we we can't disrespect one
[1:42:22] another. This is why we must treat each
[1:42:24] other and and and watch how we joke
[1:42:27] toward one another and watch how we cut
[1:42:29] up and watch what we say and because we
[1:42:32] are sons and daughters of God.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; We are. Amen.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Do do you believe that?"
[1:42:43] And he said, "Yes, sir. I believe it
[1:42:44] with all my heart." I said, "Go on." He
[1:42:46] said, "Okay." He started away a few
[1:42:48] minutes. Here he come back through the
[1:42:50] line. He said, 'I haven't stopped yet,
[1:42:52] Brother Brandham. I said, 'Well, now
[1:42:55] look, I'm not talking about when you
[1:42:58] stop.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; So now he's trying to get to him. I'm
[1:43:03] not saying you're healed when you stop
[1:43:06] the jerking,
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; right? He was looking at the um you know
[1:43:12] at at his his symptoms
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; and judging his healing by the symptoms,
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:19] He says, "You might not stop for a week
[1:43:22] or 10 days or 3 months or four months,
[1:43:25] two years." I said, "Abraham waited 25
[1:43:29] years on his. Is that right?" And
[1:43:32] scripturally, you know it. I said, "You
[1:43:34] believe what I told you." He said,
[1:43:36] "Well, I don't get it, brother
[1:43:38] Brandham." I said, "Brother, the angel
[1:43:41] of God who is declaring that I told the
[1:43:43] truth told me this. if I could get the
[1:43:46] people to believe me and be sincere when
[1:43:48] I pray. He said, "Oh, I see it. I see
[1:43:52] what you mean. I've already got the
[1:43:55] healing. I'm just waiting for it to
[1:43:57] stop."
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; I said, "That's right."
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "All right." He said, "I'm
[1:44:06] healed." And he went on and you know, he
[1:44:08] kept saying, "Praise the Lord. I'm
[1:44:10] healed." And he was healed.
[1:44:14] faith took a hold
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; because he would no longer let the
[1:44:19] jerking and the symptoms hinder his
[1:44:22] faith.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; He looked beyond the symptom and he saw
[1:44:26] the word of God.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; I'm healed. I was prayed for. I believe
[1:44:30] in that prayer. I believe God hears.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "See, if it isn't a spontaneous
[1:44:38] miracle, then you begin to say, oh, I
[1:44:42] don't guess. Maybe I better go back when
[1:44:43] brother Roberts comes. Well, maybe
[1:44:46] brother Brandham, he'd give me another
[1:44:47] prayer card and I'll go through. He said
[1:44:50] in another place, you should accept your
[1:44:52] healing. Everybody say, I should expect
[1:44:54] my healing or accept my healing. You
[1:44:56] should accept your healing. If you don't
[1:44:59] feel one bit difference in six weeks
[1:45:01] from today, you are still to accept it
[1:45:04] right now. Stay right with it and hold
[1:45:07] it as your personal property.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. Stay right with it. Now,
[1:45:14] that's what he wants.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; That's what God loves.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; I'm sure he does.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Stay right with it.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Stay right with it.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah, but I'm getting weaker. Stay right
[1:45:25] with it.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; It's getting worse. Stay right with it.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, but my children are just get just
[1:45:31] you're getting further and further like
[1:45:33] devils. Stay right with that promise.
[1:45:36] You are heir to promise.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; He's a promise. Can you say amen?
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; praise God.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; The moment you can accept your healing
[1:45:50] or salvation, Brother Brham said, if
[1:45:52] you're walking down the street, that's
[1:45:53] when you're turned around.
[1:45:56] The moment you accept it, you just quit
[1:45:59] letting the devil fight you over it and
[1:46:01] quit going back and forth. Just die out
[1:46:05] to where you can't see the symptoms. You
[1:46:07] disregard the symptom. You're looking at
[1:46:10] God's word and said, "I'm healed."
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; That's it. I'm healed
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; from this day forward. God, I accept
[1:46:16] your word. I'm healed.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And start thanking God.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the moment you start
[1:46:22] turning around."
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; See, so it's knowing how to accept our
[1:46:26] healing.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Now, if you notice Jesus in speaking of
[1:46:31] this leodyian age, he says, "I would
[1:46:34] that you would either cold or hot. I
[1:46:37] would that you was either cold or hot.
[1:46:40] And brother Bram says about this. He
[1:46:42] says, "If you are to believe God, then
[1:46:45] believe him."
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; No chicken food about that, is it?
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; If you're going to believe God, believe
[1:46:52] him.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; If you're going to serve him, serve him.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; If he's God, then he's God.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Right? Believe him.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; You don't He says, "If he isn't God,
[1:47:02] then just walk away and leave it alone."
[1:47:05] You don't want to act like something
[1:47:06] that you're not. He said you've got to
[1:47:09] be what you are. So in your heart, if
[1:47:11] you can truly believe and say, "I am a
[1:47:14] believer. I do believe God." How many
[1:47:15] believes God?
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; How many is a believer? Well, see now,
[1:47:19] we all go through testings. I'm telling
[1:47:21] you, we all go through testings. And and
[1:47:23] if we let Satan start putting questions
[1:47:25] in our mind and and start looking at
[1:47:27] everything around us, then that's when
[1:47:29] we're going to we're going to go off the
[1:47:31] out of the will of God. We're going to
[1:47:32] go off somewhere else. You got to stay
[1:47:34] with what that word says.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "They that are led by
[1:47:39] the spirit of God are the sons of God."
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Don't be led by your feelings. Don't be
[1:47:45] led by circumstances. Don't be led by
[1:47:46] nothing else but by the word of God.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; So he said, "See, he says, now I do
[1:47:53] believe God." Well, if I believe God
[1:47:55] have a need and I accept it right now,
[1:47:58] that settles it. Don't say no more about
[1:48:00] it. Just keep on praising God.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's how I got healed.
[1:48:04] He says, Satan said, "You're not healed.
[1:48:06] You're not a bit different." Now,
[1:48:07] Brother Brown's telling his own story
[1:48:09] now. So, he knows what he's saying. He
[1:48:12] said, "Satan told me, you're not healed.
[1:48:14] You're not a bit different." I said,
[1:48:15] "Stick around."
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, stupid devil. Stick around
[1:48:20] then.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you want to hear me
[1:48:22] testify, you just hang around. That's
[1:48:24] all you have to do. I will sure burn
[1:48:27] your ears every day cuz I'm going to
[1:48:30] sing his praises as loud as I can. And
[1:48:33] he left me.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; He left.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; That's what you got to do. Instead of
[1:48:42] just getting in the moldy grubs, instead
[1:48:43] of getting in depression, instead of
[1:48:45] just thinking of all the woe is me, lift
[1:48:48] up your head.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Let the devil talk. Right.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Zip his lip.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; And then we start talking.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus, for healing me. Jesus,
[1:49:06] I'll never forget what you've done for
[1:49:08] me.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, and you just start singing. You
[1:49:12] start glorifying God. Amen. There's just
[1:49:14] something bubbling in. Amen. Well,
[1:49:17] Satan's got to leave. He hates that.
[1:49:19] Why? Because you're not just a mortal
[1:49:21] being. You're a son of God.
[1:49:24] You're a son of God. There's a deity
[1:49:26] speaking through there. The word of God,
[1:49:28] faith is speaking now and he's got to
[1:49:31] leave.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; So if you have been prayed for, then
[1:49:35] don't question if God has heard your
[1:49:36] prayer. Believe that he heard it
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; and that it's already done.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; So then we change our actions, right? We
[1:49:43] change our we change our confession. We
[1:49:46] change everything. If I've been prayed
[1:49:47] for, I've done exactly what God says.
[1:49:49] Prophet says, "If we've met God's
[1:49:51] requirement, our sins are under the
[1:49:53] blood, everything is made right and
[1:49:55] there's our heart ain't condemning us."
[1:49:57] Now, come on, church. You say, "Well, I
[1:49:59] I know what Satan tells a lot of time."
[1:50:01] Well, well, see, God ain't answer your
[1:50:02] prayer, so you got to sin or something.
[1:50:04] And we're trying to dig up sins. We're
[1:50:07] trying to dig up stuff. Well, the Bible
[1:50:09] already said, "If our heart condemn us."
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Your heart will condemn you. If you are
[1:50:15] a believer, there will be something. And
[1:50:18] and that's where you got to just as the
[1:50:19] prophet said, "Father, if there's
[1:50:21] anything that I've done, if there's
[1:50:23] anything I need to make right, let me
[1:50:25] know." But if your heart's not
[1:50:27] condemning you, then the Bible says we
[1:50:30] have confidence toward God that he
[1:50:33] heareth us.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; So the only way God doesn't hear your
[1:50:40] prayer is an unconfessed sin. But if
[1:50:43] your heart doesn't condemn you, then you
[1:50:44] have confidence that God has heard your
[1:50:46] prayer. Ain't that right? And and the
[1:50:49] Bible says, Abraham staggered not at the
[1:50:52] promise of God through unbelief, but was
[1:50:54] strong in faith, being fully persuaded
[1:50:58] that what God had promised, he was all
[1:51:01] to perform. Therefore, it was imputed
[1:51:04] unto him for righteousness.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Now, notice in Romans 4:23, now it was
[1:51:10] not written for his sake alone. These
[1:51:12] promises was not given just for Abraham
[1:51:14] alone that it be imputed unto him, but
[1:51:17] for also us also to whom it shall be
[1:51:20] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[1:51:23] up Jesus our Lord from the dead who was
[1:51:26] delivered for our offense and was raised
[1:51:28] again for our justification. Now notice
[1:51:31] brother Brham reading that scripture he
[1:51:32] goes, "Oh brother, I could just hit the
[1:51:36] devil in the face with that scripture
[1:51:38] for 365
[1:51:40] days a year. and say, "You're a liar.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; There's the word. I am healed."
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Just by that one scripture.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; One scripture.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; And you got more than just one.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; More than just one.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; So slap him in the face with him.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. This all right.
[1:52:06] Brother Bram said if someone comes up
[1:52:08] and puts it on you, he said if somebody
[1:52:10] went down here and done some some kind
[1:52:13] of a something to you and let you get
[1:52:14] well, it doesn't inspire you. But here's
[1:52:17] what it is. He that believeth I am
[1:52:21] healed now.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; In other places, now some people goes by
[1:52:26] feelings. I'm not saved because I feel
[1:52:29] like I'm saved. He says, "The devil can
[1:52:32] beat you around the stump every day on
[1:52:34] that. But I'm not saved because I feel
[1:52:36] like I'm saved. I'm saved because I met
[1:52:38] God's requirements. God called me. I
[1:52:41] accepted it. And by faith, I believe it.
[1:52:43] Whether I feel good, whether I feel like
[1:52:45] it or not, I am anyhow cuz God said so."
[1:52:48] And accepting your healing, lady, it
[1:52:51] ain't how you feel. It's what you
[1:52:53] believe.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to let you go.
[1:53:00] The one thing I have found if you go
[1:53:03] just go through the prayer lines
[1:53:05] listening to them and things of what
[1:53:09] brother Brandham taught us and taught to
[1:53:11] people
[1:53:13] is that
[1:53:16] praising God, rejoicing
[1:53:19] and being happy is tied to our healing.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm going to read a series
[1:53:27] of quotes where brother Brandham
[1:53:29] instructs the individual or congregation
[1:53:32] on what to do after he prays for them.
[1:53:36] Now, if you was healed before, you know
[1:53:38] how to accept your healing, then go and
[1:53:41] rejoice and say, "Thank you, Lord. Be
[1:53:43] made well."
[1:53:45] Everybody accepting your healing, raise
[1:53:47] your hands up and say, "Thank you,
[1:53:49] Jesus, for healing me. Thank you, Jesus,
[1:53:51] for healing me." Give him praise.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't doubt a bit. Go home and get
[1:53:57] well. Get well. Right.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't say you are well. And it
[1:54:02] wasn't immediate results. He said go
[1:54:03] home and get well.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Sure. I believe you're all right. Just
[1:54:07] walk on out there rejoicing and giving
[1:54:10] praise. See, if thou canest believe, all
[1:54:12] things are possible. God bless you, my
[1:54:15] brother. Go rejoice and don't pay any
[1:54:17] attention to how you feel. Get well. God
[1:54:21] have mercy on our sister. He's praying
[1:54:23] now. and heal her of this nervous
[1:54:25] breakdown in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:28] Amen. Now, you going to get well,
[1:54:30] sister? You You're not going to worry
[1:54:32] about it no more. See, it's gone. That's
[1:54:35] all. That's right. Go away rejoicing.
[1:54:37] See another You believe sister Dorsa. Is
[1:54:41] that right? Fine name. All right. Now,
[1:54:43] go rejoicing Dorsa. Father, have mercy
[1:54:46] upon sister and heal her of this high
[1:54:48] blood pressure. And she's run down,
[1:54:51] father, and weak. I pray that she'll go
[1:54:53] home today and be well in Jesus Christ's
[1:54:56] name. Are you, sister? You You now
[1:54:59] believe it. Uh, Lord God, I now believe
[1:55:02] you healed me with all my heart. I go
[1:55:05] rejoicing for it. Is that the way you
[1:55:07] feel about it? Then go right on your
[1:55:09] road rejoicing then. See, that's how you
[1:55:12] accept your healing, right? See? Amen. I
[1:55:15] send this handkerchief this afternoon to
[1:55:16] that little boy for the healing of his
[1:55:18] body. In the name of Jesus Christ, may
[1:55:20] he and his mother be healthy and may and
[1:55:23] happy many many years for your glory.
[1:55:26] Amen. Go rejoicing now sister. God bless
[1:55:29] you. Another go mother doubt nothing. Go
[1:55:33] rejoicing. See and see. So when we pray
[1:55:37] we are to believe that God hears our
[1:55:39] prayers. Ain't that right? Brother Bram
[1:55:42] says God stooped down and picked us up
[1:55:44] and redeemed us and now we are above the
[1:55:47] angels right now. Which is it? An
[1:55:50] angel's a servant. We're sons and
[1:55:52] daughters. Which is the most thought of,
[1:55:54] your servant or your son or daughter?
[1:55:56] Prayer from a saint will go a million
[1:56:00] times higher than an angel because he's
[1:56:02] a son.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. if the musicians will come. He
[1:56:10] said, "I don't believe this side of
[1:56:12] eternity, how we'll ever realize what
[1:56:14] you are, the position that you are, that
[1:56:16] God has placed you spiritfilled people.
[1:56:19] You are sons of God. Why an angel's a
[1:56:21] servant. You're a son. An angel can only
[1:56:23] bring you a message, but you have to
[1:56:25] act. You're the actor on the scene.
[1:56:28] You're the son." See, the angels are
[1:56:30] servants to bring you the message. Said,
[1:56:32] "Here, I brought this message for you to
[1:56:35] do so and so. This is from father. I
[1:56:37] bring it to you." That's all that that's
[1:56:39] all it is. Amen. Your sons and daughters
[1:56:42] of God.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Another place go now rejoicing and happy
[1:56:47] saying thank you Lord and you shall. He
[1:56:50] said you will get well. Now sir, as you
[1:56:54] go rejoicing, go be happy. Sing songs
[1:56:58] all day long. He said, you're that quiet
[1:57:01] type of a person which would hurt you a
[1:57:05] little later in your life. You go on and
[1:57:08] just start singing hymns and rejoicing,
[1:57:11] testifying of your healing, and it'll
[1:57:13] leave you. God bless you, sir. So, even
[1:57:17] even Satan will try to use our quiet
[1:57:20] nature to keep us from being healed.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; But God wants us to rejoice,
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; testify.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Be happy.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Brandham
[1:57:34] praying for a man said, "Nothing is hid
[1:57:36] before you, Lord. You know all things.
[1:57:39] God be merciful. Forgive him of every
[1:57:42] trespass and take this desire of smoking
[1:57:44] away from him and heal him tonight. Hear
[1:57:47] the prayer of your humble servant. May
[1:57:49] his nerves quieten. May he go away
[1:57:51] tonight with a great faith in God,
[1:57:53] feeling strong, meeting the oppositions
[1:57:57] tomorrow, saying, "Oh, how I thank you,
[1:58:00] Lord, for you're healing me."
[1:58:02] See how you meet your opposition. See
[1:58:05] how you meet the devil. Amen. Thank God
[1:58:08] for the healing. When he says you're not
[1:58:10] healed, say, "Oh, yes, I am. I'm healed.
[1:58:13] Oh, God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[1:58:15] you. Thank you." Remember John Ryan?
[1:58:17] That's how he met his oppositions. Amen.
[1:58:20] He He was kind of the same way. He got
[1:58:22] prayed for and come back in the line and
[1:58:24] he said, "I thought you said I could
[1:58:26] see." He said, "You can see. Do you
[1:58:27] believe me? Do you believe me? What I
[1:58:30] just told you?" Oh, yes. you know, and I
[1:58:32] think he come around again. Finally,
[1:58:34] Brother Brand realized he was a Catholic
[1:58:36] and needed something to do. So, he says,
[1:58:37] "I tell you what you do. You go around
[1:58:40] and you start thanking God for your
[1:58:41] healing, right?" He said, "The next
[1:58:43] night, he was trying to preach and as he
[1:58:45] was trying to preach, John was up there
[1:58:47] in the balcony." He said, "Hold it. Hold
[1:58:49] it. Hold it." You know, and he says he
[1:58:50] stopped me right in the middle of my
[1:58:52] preaching and he said, "Thank God I can
[1:58:54] sing."
[1:58:56] Amen. See, and then he goes on the
[1:58:58] streets. He's saying extra, extra. He's
[1:59:00] selling newspapers, read all about it,
[1:59:02] and every once in a while, thank God I
[1:59:05] can see. He said he'd done that for two
[1:59:07] weeks. Meeting the opposition. Meeting
[1:59:08] the opposition. You know, the devil was
[1:59:10] fighting him that he was meeting the
[1:59:12] opposition. But, "Thank God I'm healed.
[1:59:14] Thank God I can save. Thank God for
[1:59:17] doing working a miracle. Thank God for
[1:59:19] my healing." He said he got down to that
[1:59:21] barber shop with that old skeptic
[1:59:23] looking at him said, "Hey, you know,
[1:59:25] John, I heard you went to a healing
[1:59:27] meeting the other night." Yes, sir, I
[1:59:29] did. Well, I heard you got prayed for.
[1:59:31] Oh, yes, sir, I did. Well, I heard you
[1:59:34] going around people saying you're
[1:59:36] praising God for being healed. Yes, sir.
[1:59:39] He said, "Well, you can't see." Amen.
[1:59:41] Instead of trying to argue with him, he
[1:59:43] raised his hands up, said, "Oh, thank
[1:59:46] God I can see." And at that moment, them
[1:59:49] scales came off his eyes and he went
[1:59:51] running down, amen, the street with the
[1:59:53] barber running behind him. Why? God
[1:59:57] honored his faith.
[1:59:59] [Music]
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord.
[2:00:05] Meet the opposition tomorrow.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Thank God I'm healed. Thank God I'm
[2:00:10] saved. Thank God for saving my children.
[2:00:13] Thank God for answering my prayer. Thank
[2:00:16] God for giving the desires of my heart.
[2:00:18] Thank God. Thank God. I know I can't
[2:00:20] meet the devil on on as a person, but
[2:00:23] I've got a promise that I can meet the
[2:00:25] devil with. I've been taught on how to
[2:00:28] receive my healing.
[2:00:30] He said, "If you need healing, here's
[2:00:32] the seed in the word. The word of God is
[2:00:35] a seed. Put it in your heart. Don't dig
[2:00:38] it up every morning to see if it's
[2:00:40] sprouted. Put it in there and leave it
[2:00:42] there. It's God's business to bring
[2:00:44] forth a harvest. You just leave it
[2:00:46] there. Water it by faith. Praise every
[2:00:50] day. Thanking God for it.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; We ought to be a people praising God
[2:00:56] every day. Every day. Every day. You're
[2:00:59] just feeling rotten. Just praise God.
[2:01:02] Amen. You're having problems, just
[2:01:04] praise God. Amen. I don't care what it
[2:01:06] is. Praise God.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord.
[2:01:18] We ain't victims.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; We ain't victims.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; That devil's scared when we get up to
[2:01:24] God.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; He hates children of God just laying
[2:01:29] there or or standing up praising God. He
[2:01:33] would rather keep us tired and sleepy
[2:01:35] and and everything else. But if I got to
[2:01:38] just flutter my eyes and just raise up
[2:01:40] my hand one more time, I'm going to
[2:01:42] thank God for my healing.
[2:01:46] [Music]
[2:01:47] Well, how many's thanking God for your
[2:01:49] healing?
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. God is the
[2:01:54] creator of our bodies. We've already
[2:01:56] been given the promise. Cast them devils
[2:01:59] out.
[2:02:00] [Music]
[2:02:02] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; He has no right over us. He has no
[2:02:05] right. Absolutely no right. He has no
[2:02:07] right over your children. Has no right
[2:02:09] over your body. Has no right over your
[2:02:11] mind. He has no right. I don't care if
[2:02:13] you're thinking you're going to have a
[2:02:14] nervous breakdown. He can't do it.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; You're that the the God that's in you is
[2:02:22] greater.
[2:02:24] Do you believe it?
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Then we act upon it. Thank God I'm
[2:02:29] healed. Thank God my children are saved.
[2:02:32] Thank God my husband, my wife is saved.
[2:02:35] Thank God for healing. Thank God for
[2:02:38] victory. Thank God for deliverance. God,
[2:02:41] I just thank you. You You said you come
[2:02:44] to you boldly before the throne of
[2:02:46] grace. I've done that as a son of God,
[2:02:49] as a daughter of God, and now I just
[2:02:52] give you praise. I just honor you, God.
[2:02:56] I just thank you. I'm taking you at your
[2:02:58] word, Lord. You're God of heaven and
[2:03:01] earth. You're sovereign. You're supreme.
[2:03:03] You're king of over everything. Lord of
[2:03:06] all lords. I thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:03:11] I thank you. I ain't defeated.
[2:03:15] There ain't a one of God's children
[2:03:17] defeated here tonight. We're victorious.
[2:03:20] Now, we need to take God at his word and
[2:03:22] just start thanking him. Be happy. Go
[2:03:24] rejoicing. Can you say amen? Don't worry
[2:03:27] about things. Don't worry about your
[2:03:29] defeats. Don't worry about your what
[2:03:31] whatever you're facing. Don't worry
[2:03:32] about your children. Don't worry about
[2:03:35] your sickness. Don't worry about it.
[2:03:38] You've got an heir to your heir to
[2:03:40] promise.
[2:03:42] I'm thinking of Psalms 37:25.
[2:03:46] David said, "I have been young and now
[2:03:48] I'm old. Yet I've not seen the righteous
[2:03:51] forsaken, nor a seed begging bread."
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; He is ever merciful and lendeth and his
[2:03:56] seed is blessed. Depart from evil and do
[2:04:00] good and dwell forever more. For the
[2:04:02] Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not
[2:04:06] his things. They are preserved forever,
[2:04:10] but the seed of the wicked shall be cut
[2:04:12] off. The righteous shall inherit the
[2:04:15] land and dwell therein forever. The
[2:04:18] mouth of the righteous speaketh. Wisdom
[2:04:21] speaketh the word, and his tongue
[2:04:24] talkketh of the judgment of his word.
[2:04:27] See, the law of his God is in his heart.
[2:04:31] None of his steps shall slide. The
[2:04:34] wicked watchth the righteous and seeketh
[2:04:37] to slay him. That's that old devil. See,
[2:04:40] the Lord will not leave him in his hand,
[2:04:43] nor condemn him when he's judged. Wait
[2:04:46] on the Lord and keep his way, and he
[2:04:48] shall exalt thee to inherit the land.
[2:04:51] When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt
[2:04:53] see it. When that devil's power is
[2:04:55] broken, you're going to see it. Amen. I
[2:04:58] have seen the wicked in great power and
[2:05:01] spreading himself like a a green bay
[2:05:04] tree. Yet he passed away and lo, he was
[2:05:07] not. Yay, I sought him, but he could not
[2:05:10] be found. Mark the perfect man. Behold
[2:05:14] the upright, for the end of that man is
[2:05:16] peace, but the transgressor shall be
[2:05:19] destroyed together. The end of the
[2:05:21] wicked shall be cut off, but the
[2:05:23] salvation of the Lord of the righteous
[2:05:25] is of the Lord. He is their strength in
[2:05:29] the time of trouble.
[2:05:32] Hallelujah.
[2:05:33] We're heir to that promise. Do you
[2:05:36] believe it? Can we just stand to our
[2:05:39] feet?
[2:05:40] Amen. What song?
[2:05:44] Oh, let's sing it now. It's already
[2:05:46] done. Oh, it's already done.
[2:05:52] Hallelu.
[2:05:55] It's already done.
[2:05:59] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:02] The battle is over.
[2:06:06] Victory is won.
[2:06:09] It's already done. Oh, sing it like you
[2:06:14] mean it now. Oh, it's already done.
[2:06:19] [Music]
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; I'm healed.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; I'm healed.
[2:06:25] Hallelujah.
[2:06:27] He's my chief physician.
[2:06:30] [Music]
[2:06:33] Bless the name of the Lord.
[2:06:37] Oh, it's Let's sing it now. I'm already
[2:06:41] healed. I'm already healed. Oh, I'm
[2:06:46] already healed.
[2:06:49] Hallelujah.
[2:06:51] [Music]
[2:06:53] Glory, glory, glory.
[2:06:58] Bless the name of the Lord.
[2:07:02] The battle's over.
[2:07:04] Victory is mine.
[2:07:07] [Music]
[2:07:09] Oh yes.
[2:07:12] Oh,
[2:07:14] it's already done.
[2:07:17] Hallelu.
[2:07:20] That's how you meet the opposition.
[2:07:23] That's how you meet them, old doubting
[2:07:25] devils. Just giving God the praise and
[2:07:29] the honor and the glory.
[2:07:32] Hallelujah.
[2:07:34] Oh, it's already done. Can we go up
[2:07:38] again?
[2:07:41] Oh, they're already saved.
[2:07:46] Hallelu.
[2:07:49] They're already saved.
[2:07:53] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:56] The battle is over. Yeah. It's not up to
[2:08:01] us to try to figure it out. It's just up
[2:08:04] to us to believe God and just go
[2:08:07] rejoicing and praising him. Oh, it's
[2:08:11] already done.
[2:08:14] Hallelu.
[2:08:18] It's already done.
[2:08:22] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:25] The battle is over.
