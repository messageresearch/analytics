it's a a real privilege that we have as mortal beings that we could reflect him amen and what love says John would say what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called sons of God and REM told us we're not going to be we are now sons of God Amen and I'm so glad for that amen the musicians can be dismissed it's just good to be in the house of the Lord today and what a beautiful day that we have and uh it's good to have uh Brad I believe and Michaela amen and uh just an honor to have them this brother Terry and sister Alice's son I hear so uh been good to have you all uh today and um we also just to remind you about brother Joe Greene's uh youth banquet coming up in October and uh I think we've got the information in the back and then also our fall festival is coming up November 5th and so looking forward to that brother Isaac Hatfield uh will be ministering the Lord willing for us that day and that's brother Wayne Lawson's son-in-law and uh but he is a uh just a fine young man and just coming along uh here in in his ministry and so I've been looking forward to having him and a good time there together but also good to have sister Jane back amen and trust your sister is doing well and thanks praise the Lord and Sister Kim weeks doing good amen and uh so we we thank the Lord for that as well and and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn back to the book of Jose the 12th chapter and um also the deacons have asked me to to remind you um you know the the the the traffic uh you know is it can be dangerous out here coming in and things and so they you know they're they want they're standing out there to to help make sure that there ain't no accidents but sometimes when cars are coming they're coming pretty fast this direction I guess it's this direction it's that direct it's both directions foreign s and so sometimes when they when they when they tell you there's no car coming they really mean that but uh it's because they don't see a car coming and so when they wave you to come and then you take your time uh a car is coming and and so you have to be really careful so when they do wave you uh kind of step on the gas a little bit and don't take your time you know it's kind of one of these things you can pill out if you need to and to make it on the other side and they even might take you out for a dinner or something I don't know I might be speaking ahead but but anyway so uh just just be careful and because we certainly don't want no accidents and someone get hurt but uh so anyways uh Hosea the 12th chapter and before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord I we certainly need him don't we every day that we live and I just you know we can't get enough of him today let's pray father we're your people here this morning and we find it in our hearts how needy we are Lord we tried the world we tried things and just never been able to satisfy us but Lord when you called us and you've done an inside work Lord we found heard that you're everything that we need and we're just here asking for more of you father the pressures of Life the things that we all go through we realize that we're no match for the devil but Lord if you could just come and give us strength that you'd pour yourself more and more into his father and may we be more yielded to you and I pray father that you would come in a special way this morning and you know the needs of your people but not only that you know how to meet the needs help me just to get myself out of the way father and Lord that you could speak through me and I pray Lord that any spirit that would try to hinder your people from receiving and pray Lord that you would drive it away from them and as your Prophet many times would ask you Lord that you would send your angels Lord by the people father to help them believe and I pray that you would do it this morning father may this service be divinely orchestrated by you father that when we leave this place we'd know that we'd been in your presence I ask it father in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen and amen Hosea the 12th chapter and we looking at the 10th verse it says I have also spoken by the prophets and I have multiplied visions and use similitudes by the ministry of the prophets also [Music] um I just felt uh to use another scripture and and we all know it I'm sure by Heart by now but Malachi 4 and um Malachi the the fourth chapter and um the fifth verse says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and we understand that that was fulfilled with John the Baptist but then it also speaks of another Ministry of his and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse and we know that last part is for this day that he would turn the heart of the children to the apostolic fathers and we we understand that the Elijah is the Holy Ghost the spirit of Elijah is the Holy Ghost for he is the prophet amen you can have your seats this morning we are living in a a very crucial time and the enemy is fighting on every hand and we know that there's no future outside of the rapture the Earth is is in labor pain the world is is falling apart on every front every hand whether it be on the religious civilization whether it be political um nations are against Nations Bible prophecy is being fulfilled like never before it's happening and there's only one way that the future to be bride and that is to be part of the body of Christ and and and I'm so glad that our future is bright the world is as as Jesus predicted men's Hearts failing them for fear and uh there's never been a time where fear has been on the earth and uh uh anxiety and and uh just things that are that are happening and men's minds are leaving them and and these things but God has left us a promise and and and that's that's what we look to but the ministry of a prophet is so important to the believer and uh because whenever God has something to say to his people he sends a prophet and um and and because a a prophet uh doesn't Express his own thoughts or ideas but rather expresses the thoughts of God and God chose the way his word would come God is Sovereign he does what he wants to do whether man believes it or not but God has always used prophets um it's it's been he as as I've said before that you know uh when God created the world and the Earth and and all the creation it was God speaking himself but uh when the people there in in in uh the Old Testament uh uh decided they didn't want God to speak uh to them um so he says all right he says I won't do that he because they said let Moses speak and uh to us and so um God says all right he he adhered to that but he says I'll raise up prophets and so it's it's the same word the same power of that word uh but it's it's through a man and so prophets are predestinated and foreordained and being part of God's word they they declared the the revelation of his word to the age and the time that God would predestinate them to and because the word of the Lord comes to a prophet then Jesus called them Gods the Bible even uh they're called them gods and Jesus referred to it and and there they it made them a God to the people that they were sent to and of course never a man worship never never amend any any True Believer never worships the man but what it is is that man when he has thus saith the Lord then the people are to adhere to that word because that word cannot fail you can kill the man but the word still lives it's just like uh the prophet Isaiah when he said behold a virgin shall conceive he didn't even know how a virgin would conceive never been done before history says that he was killed Saul to Sunder they they chased him and and he crawled up in a hollow log and they stopped the log and they and they sawed him asunder and and and martyred him for what he said but it did not they silenced the voice of that man but it did not stop the word because it was God it was God speaking through that man and so it was totally different man's word is is a failure the Bible says call every man every man's word is a lie but God's word is true and so uh therefore Moses being a prophet was a god Joseph was a God the prophets were gods and the Bible says they were and and um uh in Jesus said it it is written that they they were called Gods to whom the word of the Lord came and so they they were Gods because they had completely surrendered themselves to the spirit of God that they were working for the glory of God uh the prophet said when a man is Anointed of the spirit of God he has habits his actions and everything is God moving in him and sometimes he's misjudged and and so is it so but uh just reading quotes uh here but it says God does his own choosing by predestination chose the prophets for every age notice it he he he fixes the nature of that Prophet to fit that age he it's his style whatever he does he fits him whether he's educated or Not educated he fits the gifts the manner that he'll preach in the gifts he'll have and the message for that certain age God's predestinated that certain thing to happen and there's not another thing can take its place I don't care what it is how many man-made achievements nothing can take its place he's predestinated the man may be ignorant an ignorant man he might have predestinated him another kind of a man but whatever he is he gives him his class his gifts his nature his style whatever it is how he expresses himself and whatever he does he makes the man of the hour to catch the people of the hour and so another place he says all but those the elected whom he has sinned hate him amen only the elected love him but all the others uh uh uh hate him he said examine every instance and see if it's not right or see if it's right or not the only the ones that he has sent to he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as did receive him to him gave to them gave he the power to become sons of God and so again whenever a prophet speaks and thus saith the Lord and a Vindicated prophet he has thus that the Lord then his word has the same creative uh Power uh effect that was exhibited when God created the world ain't that right Genesis 1 1 it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth ain't that right and so we would also call the power of the word uh transforming power it was the power of transformation uh because in the second verse Genesis 1 and 2 and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters ain't that right and so the world was without form it was chaotic it was void Darkness was upon the Earth it was nothing but a complete chaos there confusion and and whatever and yet when the world was in that condition God spoke his word and the spirit of the Lord moved upon the face of the water and noticed this power of transformation the entire picture of the world was changed changed from a total chaos to a Garden of Eden and and so it was God's transforming power that could take something that was nothing and transform it and and make something wonderful out of it aren't you glad for that a man God could do that everything amen we don't understand the bleakness and how chaotic the world was because we we now we're living enjoying that what God was able to do transformed this this world to to where the trees could live and the flowers could bloom and and everything that we see is comes from God's spoken word ain't that right amen but you see uh God's plan it seeds in the earth and and then we know what he said uh there the law of God was let every seed everybody say let every seed bring forth of its kind ain't that right in all other words don't change your nature don't change your nature a man you bring forth what I've called you to to bring forth and so uh God God had planted apple seeds in the earth and he didn't want them growing up to be something else but what he had called it to be and he called uh this seed to be a certain kind and he planted this seed and he planted that seed in and they were all to bring forth of its kind every seed at that time was perfect do you believe that every seed was perfect it was laying in the ground in the beginning uh the palm trees the oak trees the Evergreens and and all of that the birds and the animals and everything was in perfect order with the word of God the Commandment of God Amen and it was to be such brother Branham said he had spoke the word and his great creating power had formed these things that come up even the man and woman for the Bible says let us make man in our own image male and female created he them ain't that right why what was it by the spoken word of God Amen and sold every word the Bible says that the word of God is a seed ain't that right it's a seed and so uh God when he created man and and woman he designed them to be a certain way and that seed was to bring forth of its kind amen and and they were the head because they were super to all other other creation other races uh the birds and the the flowers and the the trees and even the sun and the winds and and all of that man was Superior to all of that for God had made him an amateur God ain't that right that he would have dominion over God God's creation and so God would put man under the care that he put trees and animals and so forth and that would be his word man was under the the headship of the word of God Amen and they must never by no means break that word they must stay there don't take anything from it or add anything to it you must live by the word of God ain't that right now trees could not add to the word of God the flowers could not add to the word or take away from the word the the the grass and and the sun nothing could take away from or add to the word of God only man could do that because he was a he would he is a free moral agent ain't that right so he could choose and he could he he could choose to obey he could choose not to obey he could choose to add he could choose to take from and all of these things but yet man even though a free moral agent he was still under the same command as as all creation every seed must bring forth of its own kind and and and bring forth and and so uh uh so then we could ask this if every seed is to bring forth of its own kind and what preacher or anybody else has a right to make that word say something else other than what God intended the word to be ain't that right amen what good would it do what what good is it amen to change the word of God Amen God's already laid that word there and it has the power to bring forth of its own kind so why would we want to change it ain't that right a man say so so if if Mark 16 is God's word then it's got to bring forth of its own kind if Malachi 4 is God's word it'll bring forth of its own kind if Acts 2 38 is God's word it's going to bring forth of its own kind you believe that if man if first Thessalonians 4 and 16 is God's word and 17 then it's got to bring forth of its own kind if if Matthew 25 talking about the the foolish virgin and the wise virgin and and the the the the the the the sounding of the the voice of the bridegroom calling and and there's that wise virgin that has the all inner lamps it's got to bring forth of its own kind for it's a seed it's the word of God ain't that right every promise must bring forth of its kind and you see this is how God established his Eden amen what a beauty it must have been what a paradise it must have been in the Garden of Eden how perfect and how beautiful and sin didn't have to have the ha what didn't have the chance yet to tomorrow all it must have been a beautiful Greenery it must have been a beautiful tree it must have been beautiful grass it must have been beautiful amen no sin was able to touch it the Birds must have had just such a a glorious uh uh uh uh uh uh uh thing about it and and the and the the all these animals and what peace and what joy and what scenery it must have been a man because God would established his Eid and he established it by his word every seed must bring forth of its own kind and it was perfect seed under the law of God ain't that right and so this is not only does he establish his Eden that way but this is how he establishes his church amen every word after its kind ain't that right and Matthew 4 4 Jesus says it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word and that proceed us out of the mouth of God ain't that right but notice Satan always takes something else than the word of God in it's just his his way he he does it he's done it from the beginning he does it today and and and so the majority it's just like the majority of the people today are confused as to what the evidence of the Holy Ghost is amen and and you know uh uh uh and and I'll stay with my thought but but in Matthew 5 45 Jesus says the father maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and on the unjust ain't that right and and so what it it tells us and and and we could only really understand it by the message is that the that that that that the that a child of the devil can be anointed just as much as a Son of God can amen uh uh uh the blessings of God falls on on on Satan's Children as it does on God's children gifts are used by the devil's seed as they are by God seed ain't that right not tongues the interpretation of tongues and prophecy and the nine fruits of the spirit the nine spiritual gifts and can be impersonated by the devil ain't that right amen they can all be impersonated brother Branham says he can impersonate any kind of gift that God is God but he cannot bring that word word by word ain't that right amen he cannot bring the word word by word that's where he felt in the Garden of Eden and that's where he always fails a man is bringing the word word by word amen so that tells us that people can be Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues interpret the tons dance in the spirit preach the gospel and still be a devil ain't that right a man see and so brother Brown says this just like the corn in the field and the weed in the field and that's just in the natural uh of uh Faith wanted to plant a garden and and so we we've done that you know we're planting the garden and and I tilled it I I got out there and we tilled it up and and got all that grass and all that totally uh you know it looked dirt just it's just dirt so she goes and starts planting things and the corn and all these things and and and before you know it grass is coming up just as well well I know she didn't plant that you know uh she planted other things but not that but somehow in that Garden in that same dirt amen other stuff come up that we didn't want you understand what I'm saying and it got started getting away with her and she's like I need help help help you know uh uh uh because uh realizing that you can plant one thing but other things are going to grow up just as much well that just this it's just the nature to show what it is in the church God plants Sons and Daughters of God and other things come up and and and I have to say it you know there was things that got around that corn that that corn did not grow just right amen it just didn't grow didn't look like corn either and and you know when you got little bitty old knobs like that and and and and she says Dad to have it had taste it you know and I ain't no way I'm tasting that it just don't look right and I I just hate to tell you you know uh uh so someone tasted it and it it didn't taste like corn you know uh uh but that that's just the way it is well it's the same way in the spiritual you got you got God's unit got God seed that he planted and and and then you got weed in the field and they can be Anointed with the same Spirit a man of the Holy Ghost and that's a real believer is Anointed with ain't that right it can happen amen don't you you the same Sun that was shining on uh well the the the the the garden and the seeds that she planted the same sun was calling that grass out just as well uh uh the rain that fell upon her stuff fell upon the other stuff too amen that's what was making everything grow in that same Garden amen it was just that way well you know brother Brandon said the Antichrist will be Pentecostal to the DOT it'll be Pentecost to the dot and and you know why because the bride in this last day will not be cold formal dry and and that that's not the bride at all God never planted his sons and daughters to sit there in a church without an experience with God he he never planted Sons and Daughters of God to where they sit in a church and they're so dead and they're so dry and the spirit of God can't move upon them God never did plant such a thing ain't that right well Satan he's an impersonator a man and and so uh but this bride she will have all nine spiritual gifts in operation she will have all nine fruits of the spirit in in in operation she will have the spirit of God working in her midst ain't that right amen they try to tell us we're Beyond Pentecost and and because we're in a different age and the word that was back at Pentecost will not work for this this day what brother Brown did say that he said the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home of the Bride but they take that out of context of what brother Branham really meant because in that same sermon brother Brown said If a woman won't have a baby for her husband she'll take a dog or a cat or something she's got the mother something it's a nature but to Bear a child for her husband and raise it to the service of God that's entirely out of her line seeds should be so disgraced if she did by her sin loving Society of this 1965 type of women see it's a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern Church want any of these here screaming shouting tongues speaking Acts 2 38 youngins around her yeah yeah yeah see she don't want any of them hooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah while such a child with a mean immediately put her out of her denomination see they they had one like that and one of these churches and they'd throw her out real right quick why are you letting such stuff as this goal goal alone see you see she's pregnant with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabber in Acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific Society Church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at next Council she can't have it see so she don't want to be impregnated with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth see born of the spirit of God it has the spirit of God in it no intellectual Church John and Creed going bobbed hair fainted a painted face and there's no such thing as that in in the word in it all of that see you don't find that in the word of God see you find an old-fashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost Field child born of the spirit of God screaming holler and shouting praising God but that's all together out of the reaches for her she don't want that can you say Amen so brother Branham identifies as the only person that does not want such a thing like that as the modern Church of today amen but you find that Jesus was the word how many believes that Jesus was the word and the prophet says that that that that that the word uh uh uh that he if he would have come with Moses's word it wouldn't have worked if he would have come with Noah's work word it wouldn't work the word for their day wouldn't work in his day there ain't that right but the thing is here's the thing is Noah reflected Christ David reflected Christ Moses reflected Christ all of them prophets reflected Christ and do you believe that brother Brandon said they all reflected the coming of the perfect bridegroom so then therefore he was everything that they reflected amen what Moses reflected Jesus reflected what David reflected Jesus reflected what what Moses and and and and and all of them reflected he was and he reflected that can you say Amen well brother Branham says Luther and Wesley and even the Pentecostal age reflected the coming of The Perfect Bride amen go listen to The Harvest time he says it there see she's and and and so then today she is everything that they reflected amen everything amen and and if she isn't then she isn't the perfect word Jesus could reflect Moses because he was a reflected word or the perfect word you understand what I'm saying see he could reflect Noah he could reflect David he can reflect all of him because he was the perfect word with church we've come back to a perfect word that whatever they reflected we are today in its entirety in a Perfection can you say Amen so again the Antichrist will be Pentecost through the dot brother Brian says of all the ages of Deceit from the Garden of Eden all the way down there's never been an age so deceptive as this age false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders if possible to deceive the very elected now just a cold formal starchy church and so forth of man-made theology that wouldn't the elect would never pay no attention to that but it's up there almost like the real thing just leaving one word out is all you have to do promised of the age see a very great time Christians everywhere take heed to the hour We're living mark down and read and listen can you say Amen so then uh uh so so there's so much confusion as to what the Holy Ghost is uh today but it should not be in the bride that we should not be confused John 16 13. uh it tells us what the evidence of the Holy Ghost is how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come can you say man so when a man receives the holy ghost that the the spirit of God begins to reveal things not outside the word inside the word he shows him things he speaks of the uh of of things to come and and guides him into all truth so the prophet said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you can receive leave the word amen when you can receive the word not some system notice but have a clear understanding a clear understanding how do you know the word is clear and understand it watch it vindicate itself see we have a clear understanding of what Malachi 4 is we've seen it vindicate itself we have a clear understanding of these things a man that is happening in the day because we have seen it vindicate itself ain't that right so he says see it's always been every age if you can receive the word those priests had Jesus beat a million miles when it come to the fruits of the spirit gentle peaceful meek and lowly and yet he tore up the churches kicked them over you know and toward the people out and call them Snakes in the Grass and everything but he was that word he was that word that's it believe God God is the word and you just believe it ain't that right so notice the seed was to bring forth the sea need was to bring forth now the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it a man to transform it from a seed to a plant amen but it was already in the seed amen and whatever it was brother Branham says each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform it into the species that I've desired it to be ain't that right amen see he said that's what it must be everybody say that's what it must be that's what it must be whatever God planted and he's he put the power within that seed to be exactly what he commanded it to be ain't that right I want to say this for a moment you don't have to try to be a Christian you don't have to try to make it in a Rapture you don't have to try to be a a Son of God you don't have to try nothing if if God planted a seed in you it's going to happen it's going to be can you say amen I I I just believe that now we ought to be able to rest amen we ought to be able to rest can you say amen that's right see so it must be that's what it must be because I've given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be ain't that right so God has never changed do you believe that God has never changed his purpose is going to be fulfilled his purpose is not just uh he's not coming up with the plan as time goes like like we do we don't know tomorrow so we plan a little bit today and then we step in tomorrow and we learn a little bit more so we plan to maybe change our routes and change this and change that to our bitter understanding that God doesn't get a better understanding he's infinite he knows so he could plan before the foundation of the world even to this day he knew you would be sitting here today it's no accident that you're here today because God already decreed it in the beginning ain't that right he decreed you for this age you might say well why why do I have to live here amen why it's so horrible it's so hard it's so rough amen it's part of God's plan ain't that right it's part of God's plan so God is determined to fulfill his purpose and he'll do it and there's nothing everybody say nothing it's going to stop him nothing is going to stop him he gave that seed power to be transformed ain't that right so so and and hopefully we can bring it all together here but in the Garden of Eden the word of God was to hit you amen uh the word of God everything lived by the word of God the word of God was the The Authority in the garden every seed bring forth of its kind and as long as Man live by the word of God under that headship he could have dominion he could speak he could and it would happen he he didn't have to worry about sickness didn't have to worry about uh death didn't have to worry about you know the codes that you and I get and he didn't have to worry about you know the Temptations the Mind battles he didn't even know none of that existed because the word of God provided for him a a headship ain't that right but then he left her headship uh the word and listen to the LIE of the devil now notice brother Brown said the biggest lie ever told has 99 or 95 or whatever percent truth in it amen there's a whole lot of Truth so he says you know somebody could say well they was at the Tabernacle up here this certain night yes the people all gathered in yes they sung hymns yes the minister spoke yes that's right and then you know what they passed the bottle around and all them got drunk wrong he said see it was just the spirit fell down and they all got drunk see so it's just that much different when they not passing the bottle around see uh but a spiritual blessing of God fell upon the people they did stagger they did fall they did cut up like that but it wasn't a bottle that did it it was the Holy Ghost confirming his word with signs following see all of it seemed right is just but the bottle see and now I'd say was you up there oh yes was people there yes did they stagger yes see that's all right but that one thing ain't that right so that's how close it is just one word see and all these things so the first lie that was told in the garden had 99 truth in it see Satan admitted that what God Said was true but notice what he said you surely will not die but God said you surely will die but he just out of that one word right there and it changed the whole course of Nature and and this is where we got so brother Brandon said see the unbeliever will have to have a little bit of God's word to twist it around to make it fit the Creed and to make it more deceitful he'll say oh I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God I believe God is the father of Jesus Christ I believe all these other things but when it comes down to this other part oh that's for another day see there's the LIE of it ain't that right that's right see he's trying trying to twist a little of the word of the right word around to make it deceiving to the people ain't that right so this is this is and you just pardon me but this is what makes me leery of men who say they believe in the message brother Brandon being a prophet and all that but then they tell us but but you know you got to watch some of what he says because that's his opinions you you understand then and and and he got this certain subject from uh Darwin and and and he was you know uh this this little portion you know come from the Civil War and all that and brother Brandon was just caught up in all that and and so that that was his inspiration and and things like that see well to me that's where the LIE is you understand what I'm saying either you believe it or you don't believe it you know and and so or you know they they tell us that brother bran was the prophet of Malachi 4 but would turn around and willfully teach things contrary to what he taught such as adoption seven Thunders and the godhead and Etc or they teach that the wise virgin in Matthew 25 isn't the bride of Christ and and and and and these things well see that's where the LIE becomes that's that's where that little twisting up and and that's what causes the confusion ain't that right well see that's what Satan does he he sure we believe in tongues but when they when they when they take it out of context and they and they and they're not doing it way brother Brown I'm taught it something's got to be wrong with that sure we believe in interpretation of tongues but but when they do it outside of what brother Branham taught us then there's something wrong with that yeah you understand what I'm saying and and so uh uh if you notice the seed that God planted in the garden became deformed a man uh uh because Eve believe Satan's lie a man and anything that is deformed uh uh is taken from its original state in other words is there something wrong with it and and at deform means to to pervert to be changed over uh you know brother Ram talked about uh uh you know the farmers you know they're in Kentucky and I'm sure here too but uh uh uh where they they plant their whole fields of corn and all that and but after a while they have to get that hole and they start going around digging digging and and because what what it is is there's creepers that are growing up and they're trying to wrap around that corn and calls it to lean a certain way and and so they have to go out there and chop them with creepers out because they want a straight corn they they know what they planted they they know and they that's what they're after whatever I planted in the ground that's what I'm after and this creeper is trying to go in there and choke the life of it a man to deform it to not make it to wealth the farmer wants it to be you understand what I'm saying amen see you you can't just plant some thing and then just leave it you got to cultivate it amen and that's every one of us here amen just because you're in the message don't mean you just sit there and says well I just believe in a prophet no you've got to cultivate this thing every day of your life that's right you got to cultivate it because things creep in very easily so he says see if you didn't get those Creepers out where the corn was in the road like this then the creeper would reach over and grab a hold of that corn wrap itself around gradually so easy so slightly that you would hardly tell it was wrapping and finally it gets stronger and stronger and it pulls that core until it's deformed pulls it against itself wraps it around its own Vine deforming it from what it was to something else yet it's corn but he's before it's deformed corn can you say man well this is what's happened is God planted his sin see his seed of Sons and Daughters of God but the creeper was able to wrap itself around and deform sons of God you understand what I'm saying deform it see to where they now sit in denominations and bound by the Creeds and traditions of men they have no power to be sons of God they have no Liberty to be sons of God they can't be what God created them to be you understand what I'm saying to where that that when we talk about man being God it just foreign to us when we talk about overcoming it's foreign to the people when we talk about these things see because it's it's still the same seed but yet made in another way ain't that right so well what what done it what what deformed the the seed of Sons and Daughters of God by twisting the word by twisting the word Satan preached his Gospel of knowledge in the Garden of Eden and brother Brown said he has took that knowledge perverted knowledge contrary to the word and will and plan of God ain't that right he says now he has had 6 000 years to do just exactly what God did only in a perverted way and took the same amount of time to bring his own Eden we're not living in God's Eden we're living in Satan's Eden amen that's right it's it's an age it's a time of perversion now he has got an Eden here on Earth it's filled with wisdom and knowledge that was his gospel at the beginning knowledge wisdom science and God never did cater to such as them things no sir so now notice the prophet said now Satan could not dig up them seeds he couldn't dig them up and and Destroy them he could not destroy them so so what he done is he sprayed them with poison and it deformed the seed it didn't bring forth Its Right Kind it deformed The Original Seed and and that's what all religious programs are doing today a man programs of religion see they're still Sons and Daughters of God but it's being deformed they go to church wanting to do right and none never enters a nunnery to be a mean woman a minister never goes to school just to be a bad man you never join Church shake hands and put your name on the book or whatever you do in your church to be a bad person you do that to be a good person but it's the deception it's the deformity that does it Satan sprayed it God never had an organization and there is no such thing found anywhere in the words of God can you say man so see so these things that we just mentioned Bible schools sin and denomination they're not making Christian people they're not making Sons and Daughters of God they're not making them back into a Powerhouse for God look at people look at the Pentecost even on Azusa Street we just take that of the power of God that fell well even Wesley demonstrated the power of God Luther just demonstrated the power of God and now look where they set today just an old dried up 30 minutes sermon and and and they take the blood out they take the power out they take the Holy Ghost out they take the move of God now God can't do anything in them churches anymore amen and the people now they they are more it's about entertainment now they're more involved in sports they're more involved in television they're more involved in this why why why would they do it because there ain't no power of God to arrest their hearts and the young people are leaving the churches and and they're going out and doing their own thing and getting caught up in all kinds of sin begin and the prophet blame the church he blamed the weakness of the pulpit preachers don't preach against sin anymore and all that see it's only leaving the people deformed oh I'm a Christian or well they've even got to where they don't say I'm a Christian anymore I'm Baptist I'm Pentecostal I'm I'm Methodist I'm that I'm this and I'm the no relationship with God anymore that's a deformed Society can you say Amen so they're not making people Christians and bringing them back to original but rather deforming them making them something other than what God has called them to be oh my ain't many anymore coming to church is just a duty more than just a desire and an expectation to see God move they just come because it's a it's a religious Duty let's do it you know Justice let's clock into our time and let's move on you understand what I'm saying amen see but but notice now they're making them something other than what God called them to be Matthew 15 and 6 Jesus told the religious teachers of this day you have made the word of God or the Commandment of God of none effect by your Traditions Mark 7 13 make him the word of God of none effect through your Traditions which you have delivered and many such thing like things you do ain't that right see so so they're making the word of God of no effect God wants his word to prosper God wants his word to succeed and it will succeed it will everybody say it will succeed but it ain't going to succeed by denomination it ain't going to succeed amen by Seminary you can read this Bible backward and forward to a thousand years of your time name and it still don't make you a Christian oh but God's going to have his word Prosper can you say Amen but notice Satan made the word of God of no effect in the beginning that's exactly what happened unbelief and doubt that was his poison spray his unbelief and doubt he sprayed the seed with poison unbelief and doubt and Satan filled that cavity with knowledge and Science and civilization and it formed the whole entire creation of God now I I have to be honest we're living in an ages of of science technology but but but any of us again surely we can say that it's not better to us it's not made us better at all oh yeah we got we got fast cars yeah we we can instead of you know sending smoke signals to send a message we we you know we can email now and and like reading westerns you know and how they had to send that by telegram you know or or they had to send a message and wait for months to get it back and and now we just get on our computer you know and and push the button and they already got it you know you're talking did you get it yeah I got it yeah yeah okay good we didn't have to wait for a year you know but but and and we say oh that's made us better but look at the deformity today we we're more involved in sin and pleasures and ungodliness than ever before so science technology and all these things have not helped us movies have not helped us television does not help you it it only takes your children and deforms their minds and to where they're killing now and they're this and they're that and they're it's and it's it's just proven the more scientific we become the more technology The More Everything yes we we do Drive we're not like some that just stay with the horse and buggy and old Betsy and all these things so we we are appreciative of them things but at the same time we understand that that that these things will kill you we're more softer than than we don't have to go you know we don't have to walk to school you know uphill both ways anymore you know we drive to school yeah you know you know I I we don't have to thumb you know uh to go see your girlfriends anymore we just Dad hey Pops can I can I use your vehicle you know yeah you better take care of that thing too you know and and ZIP down the road we don't know any you know the pressures and all that that they had as far as the old ways you know I mean I'm thinking of camping you know and and you know I this was this was really nice you know and and and and I was telling the children we really have a luxury here you know uh uh because when we want to build a fire we don't have to rub sticks you know come on now I mean this is the this is the good old days you know we don't have to rub sticks and and and we just you know put a little coal there and spray it with with lighter fluid and I didn't want to tell you all my secrets but I want to you know and then put wood on top and it just catches Rod off you know I mean it was just great you're sleeping at 10. y'all thought we were really rubbing it oh no no no no we brought our mattress you know put it right in that tent it was just it was just a way of life you know so we had it a lot easier than they did back then you know and and these things but but it's technology everything has moved up and but it hasn't helped us in in we become softer ain't that right but but see in the beginning Satan sprayed it with doubt and believe unbelief and and so corinneathon made the word of God of no effect to Israel by exalting themselves over the real revealed word of God when Jesus came to the Earth the world lay in utter chaos and and and the prophet said it lay in all kinds of religion washing pots and washing hands wearing different robes and bonnets and so forth all of these things and the he says the genuine Israel of God had been so perverted from the laws and statues of God and and and John 8 and 44 Jesus said you're of your father the devil and the lust or the works of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and bold not in the truth because there is no truth in him ain't that right and so uh uh uh to be honest Jesus identifies uh uh them as being children of of Satan who who who killed the effects of the word to the people amen they they taught for uh Doctrine traditions of men and it killed the effects of the word to the people and so today the churches are exalting itself over the word of God and look what they are producing a people who are ignorant of God's promised word for this age religious yes very religious Church going and and doing religious Duty yes but God promised a word for this age can you say amen he promised a word for this age and so brother Brown says in her deformed seat of knowledge program has caused the whole race to be scientifically ignorant of the word of God God right here on Earth doing the things that he is doing by his promised word and they ignore it and walk away because they are scientifically ignorant scientifically ignorant so they are willfully ignorant amen so today if you just pardon me as we we go and and I won't keep you much longer but today men have crucified the effects of the word today how do they do it well Hebrews 13 and 8 says it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you believe that but then they will come along and say well in a way he is see Jesus said in Mark 16 15 through 18 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth then is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that not believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and what do men say well that was for another generation that was for another time God doesn't know do them things today and because we've got medicine and we've got this and we've got science and and all these things so there's no need for all of that see and right there they make the word of God of no effect to the people they crucified the effects of that word to the people can you say amen amen see so people doesn't think that it it matters well what teaching they said under and all that but to the elect it does matter it does matter amen why would God or why would Satan bring come into a form of religion and have his ministers to preach it and take that word has been ministered all over the the world today and yet they inject their own ideas and inject this why would he take the time to do this because it kills the effects of the word to the people it kills the Revival it kills the move of God it kills the experience of God to where we've got a generation amen rising up that is full of infidels they don't know the power of God and they're going into our elected offices and they're going in and they're passing laws against the move of God they're passing law against such a thing why because Satan was able to come in and spray his poison of unbelief and doubt when it come to the word of God denominational teaching kills the effects of the word every time theological teaching kills the effects of the word intellectual teaching kills the effects of the word and what does it do it kills it in the people kills it in the people can you say Amen right at the time of Jesus coming to the Earth the world again it lay in just utter chaos and because Satan's Children were doing exactly what he did in the Garden of Eden spraying spraying the poison of unbelief and doubt amen but if you notice the spirit of God moved again upon the seed that was predestinated moved upon the seed can you say Amen aren't you glad for that amen why is it that the spirit of Satan hates the spirit of God moving among the people oh my it's because the word lives when the spirit of God moves upon him see the power of transformation lays in that seed all it needs is the spirit of God to move upon it amen the prophet said the spirit of God moved upon the seed word he transformed translated and transformed Isaiah 9 6 of its promise he God was made human flesh to save that chaos time and when man was made in the image of God here comes God by the prophet for seeing it now remember the word the the prophet foresaw it just the same Prophet that seen Satan in his this last day of this educational program and things he has religious program the same prophet Isaiah 9 6 said unto us a child is born unto us a son is given his name Shall be Called counselor the Prince of Peace Mighty God the Everlasting father and of his Reign there will be no end and that word is God's word aren't you glad for that and the spirit moved upon that word and it formed in the womb of a virgin and a man a son is born not created he was born ain't that right and so we see that Jesus was that predestinated seed Behold a son he was that son when when Isaiah prophesied to hold a son a virgin shall conceive and shall bear forth a son then and all that Jesus didn't leave that scripture randomly he already had Jesus in mind ain't that right so the seed was laying right there in Prophecy in the word of God and the spirit of God moved upon that seed and it brought the the the the the seed from seed to plant it brought it from from word to reality Jesus was the reality of the scripture what God intended what God had in his mind Jesus was ain't that right see and so therefore the word that had come to the prophet spoke of him Satan during Jesus's time he tried to destroy and and deform that seed like he did the others in the beginning by spreading his poison of unbelief and doubt but the thing is he couldn't do it aren't you glad for that he he couldn't he couldn't do it he tried it he tried to destroy that seed uh when Jesus was on the boat asleep and Satan calls the winds and the waves to start trying to sink that boat but he couldn't destroy the seed he tried to deform that seed there at The Temptations uh when Jesus out in the wilderness I think for 30 40 days and and and and and and Satan kept trying to put a question mark If thou be the Son of God if thou be if thou be it's just like Jesus like Satan does us he puts a question mark in our mind are you really saved if you are saved then do this if you really believe then do this and if you really this and you did right and and if we're not careful we saw fallen for it trying to prove that we are sons of God you don't have to prove that you're a Son of God for nothing Jesus didn't have to prove that he was the son of God he knew he was the son of God he knew that the word spoke of him and so as as he would Satan would say well it is written it is written Jesus come back well it is written it is written but Satan had a knowledge of the word but he could not put the word in its right place he he would take that word full of unbelief and he would just scatter that word Jesus had faith in the word and he had the ability to put that word where it belonged so why why couldn't Satan destroy the seeds you know what brother Brown said Jesus had been sprayed with repellent of predestination so he couldn't use his deception Jesus had a repellent go back to Camping you you any of you've been camping you know you got to have some repellent yeah and Judah you know I mean he was ate up just bumps all over he didn't stay in the tent with us he he wouldn't do the hammock thing and he had his little net but somehow the little bug found the hole in the net so he kept with him a bottle of repellent that stunk but Jesus had been sprayed with repellent too and Satan couldn't use his deception and so brother Brian said see the word said he would be here amen and there ain't no devil going to bother him and no other Son of God that's predestinated to take his place aren't you glad you're predestinated take your place you're predestinated church now I I hope I'm making a little sense to you today but brothers and sisters there's a Rapture coming it's here adoption is here we're you're in the age of adoption it ain't gonna pass you by e the Rapture ain't gonna pass you by body change ain't gonna pass you by e are you with me you don't have to sit there and panic oh I got to do soccer no no God predestinated you for the age he predestinated you to believe this message somebody's gonna go be translated somebody can you say amen and Satan cannot do nothing about it he's trying he's trying to destroy you young people but he will never do it he's trying to take you out but he'll never do it he'll put sickness on you try to make you curse God but it'll never do it he tries every which way to get you to turn your back upon God in this message but he'll never do it he'll never weaken the faith of a predestinated seat we've got the repellent of predestination [Applause] and you say Amen so he sprayed you see he has sprayed with the repellent every Son of God is sprayed with a repellent Satan's poisoned denominational doctors don't even touch him at all he moves right along nothing going to bother him it didn't have any effect upon Him Jesus knew he was he had the faith in what he was he knew what the word said what he was and he had faith in the word of God can you say man why he was the word seed he didn't need Sensations he didn't need emotions he didn't need somebody babying him he didn't need somebody to prophesying over him yeah I hope you understand now I ain't against prophecy it ain't against all that stuff but I'm telling you we ain't on the emotional roller coaster Jesus could go through anything that he went through and still believe that he was a Son of God he can go through hell or high water and still stand on the word of God because he was a word seed foreign one day the spirit moved Upon Jesus again because there was some word about him to be fulfilled so the spirit of God moved upon him and the word come through the prophet notice Isaiah 53 and 7 he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as the Sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken so the spirit of God moved upon him because the word had to be fulfilled and it led him to Calvary amen and there he died and everything that was spoken of that seed if for that age was fulfilled in him there at Calvary can you say Amen but notice his death was not in vain it brought light in it life to all other predestinated seed that God had upon the Earth amen and he says here is the seed the spirit brings life transforming Sons and Daughters of God from the world in this dark chaos and to be Sons and Daughters of God and notice he redeemed us to every promise Hallelujah aren't you glad for that amen can you say that with me he redeemed us to every promise he redeemed us back to every promise amen we were deformed we were caught up in Satan's a little old creeper Amen to where it was all enticing we tried to be a Christian and yet something would lures over this way amen but we found out he redeemed us back to every promise of God everything that was in God's mind we are back to Redemption sprayed with the repellent of predestination Satan has no right over you you are free in the name of Jesus Christ he that the son is set free is free indeed and there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus can you say Amen can you lift your hands and Worship the Lord hallelujah we're free Amen to go back to every promise of God that he ordained for you and I to be oh how same thankful we are for that hallelujah we're thankful amen notice the seeds amen that were redeemed back to Ephesians 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will Romans 8 19 for the external expectation of the creature Wade is for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God aren't you glad for that do you realize that word right there that I just read them scriptures our seed words for this age just like my uh Isaiah 9 and 6 was seed word for Jesus's age so is these these sayings amen word seed for our age amen see and the seed is sown into the hearts of the elect of this day I say to you the word seed is here on Earth today do you believe it now if you give me just a little bit more time now amen but God took four thousand years to make his bridegroom masterpiece and the prophet said he has taken another 2 000 years to make his bride masterpiece and notice what he says in the Masterpiece it can only be a masterpiece when it's the perfect word it can only be a masterpiece when it's a perfect word so in other words couldn't be a masterpiece while them creepers were bringing us saying oh he got you in sin yes he did and and and we were we got scars of our past and what we've done and our failures and all of these things but then there came a redeemed Redeemer Amen to redeem us amen the Bible says we are Washed by the blood God's Own Blood Brother Brown says that word washed means loosed we are loosed by the blood of Jesus Christ and Prophet said if it's perfect blood then it's a perfect loosening no condemnation it's a perfect loosening loose from your past loose from the condemnation loose from the Mind battles loose amen from that Old stinking accuser amen he can accuse all he wants to but I'm loosed I don't have to listen to him I don't have to be a slave to him I don't have to be a slave to my path I am free as a Son of God why because I've got to be a masterpiece for this age and it can only be a masterpiece if it's a perfect word I say your past is counseled all right can you say amen amen your old flesh is canceled amen the prophet said your sexual blood has been dismissed coming back to perfect word I hope it's all right Joel 2 25 and I will restore unto you the years that the locusts hath eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm oh my God so listen to the restoration of the bright tree Brent talks about it in other places too but that bug it was one bug a man in four different stages and and it ate up amen throughout the church ages until the church was nothing but a stump that tree that bride tree was nothing but a stump brother Brian said what the Romans left they Lutheran's eaten what the lutherans left the Methodist eating and what the methodists left the Pentecostals eating until she's down to a stump he said the church is dwindling down amen but I will restore saith the Lord what will I do I will bring her back to her original condition what was your original condition as a little baby in in your mother's arms no no there's a far greater condition that you were in amen you you were full of stench he has a little old baby you might have been cute and cuddly cuddly brother will but you were as a stinker amen there was that old rotten nature that old rotten carnal adamic nature amen and as you grew up you begin to reflect that you begin to manifest it biting and hitting and pulling hair and screaming and letting to throw in the temper tantrums and all of that but there was a greater condition amen and that was in the mind of God ain't that right and so God says I will restore I'll bring her back to her original condition I'll bring her back to her original Doctrine I'll bring her back to the original word I will break every denomination into pieces and I will bring her back to my word and I say to you God is going to have a word bride in this age and I say to you she is here being made manifest as a word bride not reflecting our own ideas not reflecting tradition and doctrines of man but reflecting the original thoughts of God all right amen she is going to be an expression of his thoughts and it's happening we are living in the age of full restoration the restoration of the Bright Tree the restoration of God's Eden the restoration of Faith amen the restoration of the power of God in the church the restoration of what God planted on the day of Pentecost amen Luther's age did not bring the full restoration neither did Wesley's age neither did the Pentecostal age bring a full restoration amen they each had a restoration amen a restoration of this a restoration of that a restoration of the gifts amen all these things amen and and and and we went from one Church age to another from one denominational age to another and all these things but it's only in this age everybody say it's only in this age only in this age we hear a voice we've heard of us and come out of her my people come out of her my people can you say Amen don't you be damaged by them don't you be contaminated with it come out of her my people you didn't hear that in Wesley's age you didn't hear that in Luther's age you didn't hear that in any other age but in this age the because this is the age that God will bring full restoration to his church amen you realize we're not entering another denominational Church age the denominational ages are over if we could only grasp what that really means to us denominational agents is over why it's time for the word seed to bring forth of its kind and how is God restoring it all back the word returning in its pure form amen you realize that Malachi 4. is a work of restoration and when God promised I will restore saith the Lord he already had a prophet in mind behold I sin unto you Elijah the prophet before the coming in the great Dreadful day and it would be by the Malachi 4 that he would bring a full restoration amen see and so if sin and death and the fall of Man Came about by disbelieving the word if these denominations are cursed by God because they have accepted man's Creed instead of the word of God if the seed of God has been deformed because there was something added or taken away from the word of God then the original word has to be restored in order to bring everything back to its original condition amen and now we see why the angel Mighty angel of Revelations 10 1 has come the spirit of God moving upon the seed word amen why because God had some Sons and Daughters Amen in his mind when he spoke about Rapture he already had us in mind and the spirit of God now is moving upon the word and now we are coming forth we are coming forth as the manifestation of the word can you say man amen now it's not just word on Bible it's now word made flesh as Jesus Took the word he become the word that was on the Scrolls amen and everything that the word said he would be he was the word became flesh living in a body and so is it today the restored word is not just where we understand the word the restored word is when it comes into Sons and Daughters of God and they come and reflect what God had in his mind in the beginning amen the mighty Angel has come to anoint that word see to anointed to the word anointed amen the anointing does not take us outside the word can you say man amen this is why the bride checks everything with a word every move these days we're not vulnerable people we're not gullible people no more amen we we we we why because we're word seed amen we checking everything we're Discerning Spirits brother Brian said you don't judge the man but you can't judge the spirit discern the spirit of something and see what's what's happening what's working behind the scenes okay and if you're gullible if you're sitting here and you're just gullible it's your fault because the message has come to expose every tactic of the enemy every tactic of the devil can you say amen amen so what deformed the seed in the first place the Antichrist teaching amen first John 2 and 18 Little Children it is the last time and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time ain't that right so the first thing that he was he's an antichrist Spirit he's an antichrist because he's against the word amen and that's what started the whole thing in the beginning brother Brown said that's exactly what done the whole thing was turning from God's word not because Eve might have given Cain a spanking one day see that wasn't what done it the first thing that done it done the whole thing was that she turned from the word she turned from the word and the first thing started the prostitution in the Church of the Living God Christ's bride she turned from the word and accepted Roman Roman Dogma in the stead of God's word what's happening to every organizations that done the same thing can you say amen and so John said that that Spirit was working in in the church uh in his day shortly after the day of Pentecost and and and the the Antichrist Spirit deformed the seed by being against the word so brother Branham says this in order to get back to the original God God has to speak again God has to speak again so to bring the restoration brother Branham said the word of the Lord would drop on the earth as he did it in the beginning and always and will restore back what what started it against the word and what does this fella supposed to do when he comes Anointed with God's spirit talking about Malachi 4 he just brings the faith of the children back to the fathers that's how he restores he brings our faith back to original original belief in the original word of God can you say man do you love him it isn't because you know a lot of people expect him to be in a Rapture while they're just sitting there on the television you know flipping through the channels and and and these things and and they say well I'm going to be in a Rapture and yet you're sitting under a false teaching a false doctrines and false this there is a reason God sent us a prophet to restore our faith back to an original word can you say man do you love the Lord isn't he wonderful see then that's why it would take the seventh angel that's why my prophet of Malachi 4 is connected with the seventh angel for Revelations 10 7 and when he shall begin to sound all the Mysteries shall be finished all those things why did it become Mysteries because men would insert their own doctrines and bring a mess of confusion to where we in this age it was just Mass confusion it was just total total chaos but God would send a seventh angel and he'd have to be a prophet so that's why we can identify that to be a prophet of Malachi 4 Amen to restore the faith he would restore the Faith by restoring the original word opening these truths up can you say amen and yes his message sounds weird sounds odd because he did not come with the same old school of thought he come with thus saith the Lord he come with the original mind of God and he would not come the way of a denomination he would not come the way of a seminary wouldn't come with just theology message of theology or whatever intellectual amen it would be amen the prophet said that the Malachi 4 would restore the faith he would change the thoughts of the people and brother Brown says this the end time message should meet in time conditions where they've got off the message ought to bring it back always end time message meets end time conditions all the way through scriptures it'll have to do at this time a call back to the original word he says why all while all them Scruples of denominations arguing their difference about their Creed and notice where they're coming they're coming all back to Unity now they're coming to Unity but where's it at not taking us through the word of God they're taking all of their followers through the World Council of churches come come come with let's all be United let's drop our differences let's all just be brothers let's be Brotherhood but how can two walk together except they be agreed the Unity comes by the word of God can you say man see so God promised that he would send us a true prophet of the true word with the message to return to the original word of God and the faith of the fathers to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst the people with the power that will raise her up above these things and take her in at the same time do you love him if the musicians will come I got so much more to go but brother Brown said God isn't making Sons and Daughters you realize that this message isn't making Sons and Daughters it's not no you you just like I I couldn't make my son and daughter I I couldn't do that they were already in me right they were already in me we were in God's thinking before the foundation of the world see I cannot bring forth your son I cannot bring forth your daughter I can't I can't do that I have to only bring forth what was in me right and so is it today I can only bear my own sons that would bear my likeness and brother Brown says if you are a son and daughter of God then you were in God at the beginning you're his attributes if he wasn't there then then you never was or never will be but he said if you've got eternal life that life that's in you always was and you were in the loans of God before there even was a world see so what it means is you are a word seed God would send this Prophet for you [Music] and it would rest your heart and you would believe it and would begin to restore your faith back and before you know it you see [Music] there's nothing that can destroy the creepers in your life except a prophet God's sending a prophet [Music] as much as you know [Music] good as people do but Dr so-and-so can't destroy the creepers in your life some intellectual preacher cannot destroy the creepers in your life [Music] these conferences cannot destroy the creepers in your life you might have creepers in your own self you may have creepers in your home you may have creepers in your mouth in your marriage your children may have creepers that are deforming them a certain way [Music] that all the good as I've told you all the good the literature and all the books and all these things to train you how to do this and this and all their steps of programs that they have for you to do will never change and never loosen them creepers never break the power of them creepers in your mind God sent a prophet to bring a restoration of faith a faith that you could have in the word of God and as you begin to believe in that word something begins to take place one creeper loses its hold and another creeper loses its hold and another creeper loses its hold and you're finding yourself back to being sons of God with the power and authority that you can speak over the situation that's what you need is not intellectual what you need is the power of God to sweep over the sea to break them creepers in your life [Music] can you say man so you were in the loans of God and in this day the word the word is taking flesh again in this age aren't you glad for that the word to be brought back the manifestation of the word and today we're not in the seed stage as when locking a farmer goes out and plants seed in the dirt we're not in that stage we already been planted God planted that seed there in his church on the day of Pentecost God planted us as sons of God in his mind before the foundation of the world so then what are we back to seed yes seed Original Seed not deformed seed and we're maturing in the presence of God can you say Amen we're maturing or bearing witness of what seat we are you love the Lord isn't he wonderful appreciate your patience this morning I trust it was a help I love the Lord amen what song amen sing it now oh consume [Music] of your spirit consume me Lord maybe just like you come and Break Me Lord Bless The Broken Pieces Of My Life Let It Be You used [Music] sing it now or consume with the fire is that your prayer concern me Lord make me just like you come and Break Me Lord [Music] of my life let me be used [Music] sing it again oh come soon Let It Be A Prayer consume [Music] make me just like you come and break [Music] Bless The Broken Pieces Of My Life Let Me Be You say Brother Martin I've got a long ways to go that's okay God's power can change in a moment's time just keep believing take every word believe it get away from the world you'll watch the habits just begin to die I thought of how that you know in the fall leaves fall from a tree but not every leaf falls from that tree he's like well how's that all dead leaf how's it going to drop off for New Life if you watch when the spring comes that life begins to push them old leaves off and I thought that's so true just because you give your heart to the Lord doesn't mean that you still ain't got things that God has to deal with but as that life that new life begins to press itself and you begin to yield to that life and that life begins to take over it just begins to push that old stuff out of you it just begins to push it off I believe that's where we're at today just let the life of God just keep pushing it out before you know it you come back to original seed at original word you love him isn't he wonderful amen amen let's just sing this song all we all bow down [Music] we'll surrender their crown [Music] and worship [Music] Jesus [Music] unfailing love is [Music] sing it again and we all [Music] the Kings will surrender their crown and worship Jesus unfailing love he is the love oh one more time and we all we Bow Down his will
