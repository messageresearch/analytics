As we just go into prayer tonight, I don't have any written prayer requests, but we want to just keep uh those that we've been mentioning service in our prayers. Brother Joe's um my mind went blank, but his sister-in-law, so we want to keep her in our prayers. the Lord will just continue to touch her. Amen. Good to see Sister Kim Weeks tonight. Amen.

And maybe we could ask brother Terry if you would come and lead us in prayer tonight. Let's remember our pastor that the Lord would just move in a special way tonight. How many has an unspoken request to lift your hands? Man, the Lord sees every need tonight. Amen. Let's just all bow our heads and pray in your way as we look to the Lord. Heavenly Father, what a joy it is to be in the house of the Lord. Father, you saved us for divine purpose. Lord, we sing the song, our hope, my hope is in the Lord and forever more. Lord, I'm just thinking back 45 years or so, you know, when we were in denominations and we heard the word of the Lord and as the prophet God said, we heard the truth of this hour. We heard from our theophy and it spoke to me and Lord, you give us a revelation and I saw my name written there and I came to the word when that light struck that seed and how thankful I've been ever since. Lord, it's never been a a time that has grown grown uh cold or common or or just a a lukewarm feeling, but we're just so happy all of these years, Lord, to be able to serve you. And thank you for this great end time message, what it means to us. Lord, I'm I'm thankful that we was called out according to Revelations 18:4. We pray for Lord, even the the young people that was raised in the message. It's just very hard for them to to to realize that eagle scream sometimes because they was raised in it just like raised in a denominational church. But God helped them each one of them to realize and recognize Lord. This is this is a separation. Lord, this is a a different day, a different dispensation. It's a a truth. Lord, it's like has never been given back in denominational ages. A complete revelation of Jesus Christ. All been restored. You saved the best for last. Well, Lord, each one of the people that brother uh Daniel mentioned, I pray that you would touch each one of those. We're thankful that you've helped those who had the uh surgeries in their their knees. Just each one of those, oh God, how thankful we are.

Uh when the storm is raging. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it is raging. Um, but we're we're safe and secure and I thank the Lord for that. It's good uh just to have everyone. Um, House of the Lord, good to have brother Terry back with us. Amen. And brother Joe. Uh, we missed you all. And, uh, brother Josiah and his family are in route uh, home. And so we want to keep them in our prayer. And um it's just good to be in the house of the Lord. Good to have Sister Lisa back with us. Amen. As well. Amen. And the musicians can be dismissed. And uh before we uh go into the word um just some uh prayer requests that um was forgotten, but uh Sister Joyce um Brother Mark's mom is uh uh having some issues in her body and um I think they had released her uh yesterday was it from the hospital and um been just going through some uh things there and and so we want to uh to pray for her and then uh received a text. Brother Johnny Jones had a stroke last night and um has lost u I'll just read it how it was presented. He lost complete feeling in his left hand but has regained feeling in three. Uh two fingers are really weak but a blood clot has went to his brain and um they said his heart is good but the artery um that it came from is 70 70% blocked. Um he was in Tennessee. I I would assume maybe around Pigeon Forge or whatever. I don't know, but uh they were trying to get him into surgery as of this morning. I believe that's when I got the uh the uh text. Um and um so they were either trying to get him to Knoxville or fly him here to Rono. Uh what whichever hospital could get start the operation the soonest. And um so I I have not heard anymore um um uh &gt;&gt; still in surgery. &gt;&gt; Okay. So not into not in surgery yet, but trying to get him. So anyway, I I'm I'm sure they would appreciate the prayers and um you know, our life is just but a vapor and uh we certainly need God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh to help us out and and I I know they they need the Lord, you know, need us to be praying for this situation. Um, also, brother Andrew um, Glover u had just asked us to pray for he's got an unspoken prayer request and asked if we would just pray uh, for this need. And so let's just go into the Lord in prayer and um, we'll ask him to help us tonight as well. Father, we know prayer has been lifted up already this evening. And Lord, these requests that I have mentioned, Lord, Brother Mark's mom, Lord, I know that if it was my mother in this situation, Lord, I would certainly want the church to pray. Father, I pray Lord that you would just go to where she's at and touch her. Father, I just Lord, I don't know what all is going on, but she's weak, Father. And Lord, just needing a touch from you. &gt;&gt; I pray God that you would do it, Lord, tonight, Father. Work a miracle. And &gt;&gt; yes, Jesus. You see, brother Johnny, Lord, in this need that he's in, Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we we've got to have you. And Lord, Brother Johnny need you tonight, Father, that you would just uh come, Father. You You can do the operation yourself. There there's nothing too hard for you, Father. And may this blood clot dissolve that's in his brain, Father. and may he get total use, Lord, out of this hand and whatever else is ailing him. I I pray that you'd bring him out of that hospital, Father, Lord, as a testimony of your miraculous power. Father, we're dependent on you. And Lord, we we're asking that you would touch Brother Andrew and the situation, Lord, that he's facing. And I pray, Father, that you would meet the need. Go before him, Lord. Uh may the angel of the covenant go before, Father, and meet the need. Fight the battle, Lord. Father, we just commit uh leaving this into your hands, committing it to you. We pray, Father, that you would move tonight, Lord, as you know that we need you, Lord, and more now than we ever have before. Father, may the words of life come forth, and may I yield myself to thee, Lord, and may the people, Father, uh uh yield themselves, Lord, and open their hearts, and any spirit that would try to bind this service, I pray, Lord, that you would just defeat the enemy. We ask it, Father, and we just believe it in Jesus Christ's name. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. Bless the name of the Lord. Um, so if you'd like to turn with me to Matthew the 9th chapter, first of all, um, Matthew the 9th chapter. And it's good to have Sister Kim Weeks with us again. And um bouncing back good. Praise the Lord. And so um but Matthew the 9th chapter and 35th verse we will read. And Jesus went all about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues. and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep uh having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, the harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest. Then we'll go to Matthew uh the 25th chapter and we read this uh the other day and I'm going to just read it again. Um, Matthew 25:14, "For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one. To every man according to his several ability, and straightway took his journey. Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents. And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lord's money. After a long time the lord of those servants cometh and reckonth with them. And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliverest unto me five talents. Behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a few things. I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliverest unto me two talents. Behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a few things. I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter in thou into the joy of thy Lord. Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art in hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strolled. And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth. Lo, there thou hast that is thine. His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful uh servant, thou knowest that I reap where I sowed not and gathered where I have not stroed. Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money in the exchangers. And then at my coming I should have received mine own with us. Take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath 10 talents. For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he that um and he shall have abundance, but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath, and cast ye the unprofitable servant, into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth. Amen. You can have your seats this evening. And I would like to continue on the subject that I spoke on Sunday uh doing our best for the Lord. And we are all called to do something for God. And I I count it an honor to to do something for the Lord. He's been so good to us. And and um I want to do all that I can for his kingdom. And I'm sure that every one of us here feels the same way. U but we are his body and u so he operates through his body and but you would think that he would choose superhuman people to work and to use and to reflect his glory but uh that's not true. uh he doesn't always use people that have it all together. Uh in fact, it's usually the opposite. Um and so no matter who you are, what you are, if you're part of the body of Christ, u then God has put you here on this earth for a reason. And it it does not matter the age uh per se. Um uh we all go through the seasons. We all go through things um uh from the youth to middle-aged uh to to the the oldest. And and yet if God has us here on this earth, then he's still got something for us to do. &gt;&gt; I just believe that. And so um uh but he he saved us for a purpose and he called each of us to labor uh for his kingdom. And every one of us have our own unique way of doing something. Uh uh God didn't call uh us uh to do the same thing uh in the same way. uh whatever. But but some are able to sing, some are able to preach, some are able to play instruments, some um are able to um you know to to do whatever. But but God has given us the talents and he's actually given us our different personalities. He's given us just the way we are. Uh it all plays into what he wants us to do. Um and and and so whatever we are called to do, we must do it. &gt;&gt; We are responsible uh uh to do this. &gt;&gt; Now some of you know some of us may not have a real nice singing voice, but if God's called you to sing, then you're responsible for that. Uh some of us may not be fiery preachers like others or some of us may not be uh professional musicians as others are. And a lot of times that causes people to become dissatisfied in what they do. It causes them to build a complex uh of inferiority, to feel inferior to maybe someone else uh that we would think can do it better or or whatever. Um and and I I don't I don't believe that's the way God wants us to serve him. I I think that God wants us I truly believe that God wants us just to be uh believe in what we are in who we are &gt;&gt; and what he's called us to do. &gt;&gt; I I think that's what brother Brandham said that we are all responsible to find out what God wants us to do &gt;&gt; and and just to float along in life and and bump here and bump there. I I don't think that's what God is is wanting of us. But he's looking for a people that are solid, looking for a people that are willing to work and to work within the call that he's ordained for them. And so, but it it causes these things. And um as I was uh talking about the the man with the one talent, there was three men Jesus talks about. One had five talents, the other one was given two, the other one was one. And the others done great with their talents. But this one, this man, he um I I'll say that he got a complex about it. you know, he didn't have as much to do. Didn't have much talents as the others and he just had that one and so instead of doing something with it, he buried it and and Jesus said he buried it in the earth. Um and so um he hid his talent and and so uh but but in this Jesus is telling us that every man is going to give an answer for what he has done with what God has given him. &gt;&gt; Every one of us are going to give an account. Um, and you know, I I thought of, you know, how how many singers are out there singing for the world and great great uh talent and instead of using it for God, they have sold out and they're using it for the devil. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But then there's many that just keep their talent hid in the church and they don't do nothing with it. uh and it may be because of uh they don't feel like uh you know they're they're they've got much to offer. They they maybe feel like well you know I I just don't think it's important &gt;&gt; but if God gives us something it is important &gt;&gt; you are important in the body of Christ. Do you believe that? So then we we find that God gave us something to do and then he gave us something to do it with. God does not leave us unequipped but he gives us something to do and gives us something to do it with. Now I I brother Brandham talking he said I just noticing this young fella he goes that's your wife brother Burns is it that playing and singing there that young couple isn't a piano neither or he said it isn't a piano neither is it an organ it's some kind of an instrument they make a strum uh and pick it and do something for the Lord now if you could do that and sing and see that's when soul see you're you're doing this. In other words, they're doing it to win souls. That's their goal. Ain't that right? They may not be a preacher. They may not be uh uh uh world known, but what they got, they're doing it to to win souls. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, it's it in other words, it's all a part of it. Uh uh they may not been standing there. God God had a prophet on the scene at that time and he's the one that's getting ready to deliver the message. But but that didn't mean that that Brother Burns and his wife playing whatever they were playing and singing wasn't part of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; They they were all doing something and it was for the kingdom of God to win souls to to be a blessing. So he says do something no matter if you can whistle well whistle. See, just do something. Just testify or do something for the kingdom of God. And whatever you've got, put it to the use in God's service. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So now there there are uh uh uh several a few ministers here uh tonight and yet none of us preach alike. Uh but see that doesn't mean that anyone is in is is better or lesser or whatever. It's just that that God never called us uh uh to do it all alike. We're not called to do that. We're not called to uh uh uh uh you know to to to uh uh we all have a different presentation to to bring. But now we're all called to preach the message. How many believes that? See, we're we're called to preach the message as ministers. See, and and and because that's the age that we're we're living in. And and and so this message is our message to preach. But God never called us to compete against one another. I'm I'm not to try to be like brother Amos, and brother Amos isn't to try to be like brother Terry. and and and brother Terry ain't trying to be like uh brother Daniel or or or vice versa or or whatever. See, and so when when when we try to be like someone else, then we're we're only impersonating. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? We're we're only impersonating. And and we know what an impersonator is. Uh an impersonator is an actor. And and so you hear brother Brown talking about Hollywood all the time. Hollywood acting. Quit this Hollywood acting. And what he's trying to say is is quit impersonating. Quit being something that you're not. A ain't that right? See, God, if God didn't call you to do it, then then don't try to do it. Now, I as I've said, uh we should have examples. We should have men and women that we look up to, that we respect, that we admire. as Paul would even say, be followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises of God. You you you should have examples. I I think you young people should have elders that you would look to and say, "Lord, I I want to be like that." And but but that's not TO BE THEIR STYLE. That's that's not to try to impersonate them. But if you see them dedicating their lives, WELL, GOD, that's what I want. If if you see them being faithful in THEIR CALLING, WELL GOD, I WANT TO BE FAITHFUL IN MY CALLING. If you see them anointed and being used OF GOD, WELL GOD, THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BE. I I want to be anointed. I want to be used of God. But that doesn't mean that we so idolize a person that that we try to be like that person and and we preach like that person or try to sing like that person and and and all of these things. there there's too much fake that is going around. Uh fake singers, fake preachers, fake this, fake ministries is because no one and I don't say no one, but but a it's because a lot of people don't want to be they're they're not comfortable with way called them to be. &gt;&gt; And and so uh but there there are several mothers here. Amen. But you know, God didn't call all you mothers to to raise your children just alike. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, and so then when you when you try to be like someone, then then you're only impersonating. You don't want to be an actor raising your kids. You don't want to be an actor as much as we don't want to be an actor when we're preaching. You don't want to be an actor in raising your children. You don't want to be an actor in in in in whatever. See, God did not call us to be actors. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and so, Brother Brown says, "Many times people are trying to act like the other fella." &gt;&gt; He said, "Listen, you quit trying to act like the next fella and just act out your own convictions and you get along better. Just be yourself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I I'll say it this way. Be yourself with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Be yourself with the Holy Ghost. So, so people become miserable. WE GOT SO MANY miserable people in the world today because they're trying to be like someone else. &gt;&gt; That's right. And and we have to, you know, I I you know, again, I I blame a lot of that on on social media is because we're seeing so much good. So much things that looks appealing and and well, I want my house to be like that. I I want my children to be like that. I want my wife to be like that and I want my husband to be like that. Well, God didn't call your family to be like the next door's family. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and so people become miserable when when they try to be like someone else. Now impersonation is something that is not inspired of God. It's actually inspired of the devil because that's exactly what Satan has started out doing. He wanted a kingdom just like God's. And and he's determined that he'll be like God, show himself that he is God when he's not God. He ain't even close to being like God. And yet he's going to present himself as being God. That's impersonation. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and so he copies anything that God does. Now, Brother Brandon says, "See, all the things that the devil has, he stole the copyright from God to make it." See, Satan cannot create. Satan is no creator. He's a perverter of something God created. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? But see, the the prophet told us that nobody can take your place. &gt;&gt; So then if nobody CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE, then what's the use of anybody trying to be like you? &gt;&gt; IF NOBODY CAN TAKE MY PLACE, then what's the use of anybody trying to be like me? If if if then then that tells us that that no one can be like you. You can't be like nobody else. So then you are original &gt;&gt; and be original. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, brother Brandham says the American people through television and through picture shows, they have been they have seen so much of the put on till they become put on themselves. He said that's too bad. And we get it in church actors. He says God don't want them see be far be it from us to be actors. BE YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS YOU TO BE that way. &gt;&gt; Right? God wants you to be yourself. &gt;&gt; See, and and HE SAYS, "I DESPISE SEEING someone trying to do something that they cannot do." &gt;&gt; You're not called to do everything. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's why we HAVE A BODY. &gt;&gt; CUZ WE'RE NOT CALLED TO do everything. &gt;&gt; But when we don't do our part, then it leaves A HOLE BECAUSE I CANNOT TAKE THAT PLACE and you cannot take that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So then what what if we're going to do something for God, which God's called us to do something, then we've got to be content. Everybody say, "I need to be content." &gt;&gt; I need to be content with the way God made me. &gt;&gt; And use whatever talent we have been given. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, God wants to express himself through your body and and he wants to use you in the way that he designed you. And and we're all designed. We we're a special designed people. And and uh uh design means uh to devise for a special function or end deliberate uh purpose of planning. It's a deliberate purpose of planning to devise for a special function. So when God uh uh when he when he through throughout time way in the beginning he had this plan and he knew what he was going to do and and he would become the actor but HE NEEDED THE BODY. He needed the mask. Amen. To to do the part. Ain't that right? And so he designed you and every one of us in a certain way that in this age he could come in each one of us and act a different part through us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So then he made us with the right temperament. He made us in the right way. He made us with the right character, the right nature, the right personality that that he could take and and work through. So no gift or talent is a onesizefits all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And so brother Brandham says, "See, it's inscriptural for you or I to impersonate anyone else." Right? So be what you are and be a good one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's what we need to focus on. &gt;&gt; Be what we are and be a good one and fulfill your purpose so others can see you. If you're a housewife, be a real one. If you're a husband, be a genuine one. If you're a deacon, be genuine. Or a preacher, whatever you are. But don't try to take someone else's place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, in the uh things that are to be, brother Brandon talks about the the different uh varieties. And he says in my father's house is many kinds of mansions. See, I don't believe that when we get to heaven that we will be just everybody just look exactly alike. I don't believe that we'll all be blondes or brunettes or little big or all giants or whatever. I believe that God is a God of variety. The world proves that. He's got big mountains, little mountains, he's got plains, he's got deserts, he's got different things because he made it the the way he wanted it. GOD made it the way he wanted it. God made you THE WAY HE WANTED YOU, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SEE, and so he made the seasons. Summer, winter, spring, autumn, he made the seasons. It shows he's a God of variety. He made you in a variety. Some men are real blusterous. Some some are real dogmatic, others are fine, others are kind. And you just find all different kinds of people and they're in his kingdom. Look at St. Peter and judge him by Andrew. Andrew is that prayer warrior just stayed on his knees all the time. The Apostle Peter was one of those fire brands, that priest and so forth. PAUL WAS MORE SCHOLARLY LIKE THE PROPHET or something like that. Just sat back. See, Moses wrote the first four books of the Bible of of uh of the old. See, and which he wrote the Old Testament. See, and the rest of it was the laws, kings, psalms, and so forth. And what someone wrote of the prophets, but Moses wrote the laws. See, the first four books of the Bible, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. And then uh uh Paul wrote the New Testament. See, that's true. Mark, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John wrote the acts of what taken place so forth. But Paul separated law and grace and put it into its place. He was the writer of the New Testament. Ain't that right? See, so God made Paul in a certain way than he made Peter and Andrew. And he even put Paul in a certain uh uh uh a path in life. and and pet Peter didn't go through, you know, the Sanhedrin and become like, you know, he wasn't a teacher. HE WASN'T A BUT PAUL was Paul learned that law. He was a student of the law, but God would take that and use him to divide law and grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, we we find that brother Brandham is is showing that all of these men were called to do something for the Lord. Amen. But they THEY WERE NOT CALLED TO BE alike or to do uh or act in the same style like the others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So why would God choose us to preach the gospel if we're not the best preacher in town? &gt;&gt; Why would God choose us to sing amen uh uh for his kingdom if we're not the best singer in the world? YOU KNOW WHY WHY WHY WHY WOULD HE choose us you know you mothers to be a mother if if if you're not the best mother and if you're not you know UH UH ON SOCIAL media and everybody's ooing and oh and over your ability to be the mothers well why WOULD GOD THEN CHOOSE us a man TO DO THESE THINGS WELL I SAID IT THIS WAY WHEN GOD CHOOSE YOU he knew what he was doing &gt;&gt; he knew what he was doing and and so there therefore Four. See, we we do ourselves an injustice by comparing oursel with others. &gt;&gt; A minister should never compare himself by another man's ministry. &gt;&gt; A mother should never compare herself with another mother. You you young lady should never compare yourself to other young ladies. That's what causes discontentment. &gt;&gt; Hello. You spend more of your time trying to keep up with others than you do trying to work for God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's just true. &gt;&gt; SO HE GAVE US THE TALENTS. He gave us the gifts that enables us to work for him because God wants to use us. Everybody say, "God wants to use me." God wants to use me. &gt;&gt; He don't need you to be the best person in town. God can use what he what what he made you for. &gt;&gt; He doesn't need you to be a world preacher. &gt;&gt; He just needs needs you to to to he just called you to work. He's got a purpose to work through. Amen. See, so now there are things that the prophet tells us that God cannot use. There there are and I'm going to mention a few of them. Uh the prophet tells us that God cannot use a coward. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't he doesn't demand beauty out of you you sisters. He doesn't demand us to be have a well-trained voice to be the be singers to be used for him. &gt;&gt; That that's not what he's requiring. But he cannot use a coward. Amen. &gt;&gt; Another one. WHEN WE TURN ASIDE FROM THE THINGS OF GOD, THEN GOD CANNOT use us any longer. &gt;&gt; Another one, God cannot use your natural ability. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're full of theological training, GOD CANNOT USE YOU. GOD'S GOT TO HAVE EMPTY VESSELS. EVERYBODY SAY, "GOD'S GOT TO HAVE EMPTY VESSELS. so he can fill them. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Another place HE SAID THAT'S WHAT IT WAS AT PENTECOST. THEY had empty vessels SO GOD COULD FILL THEM UP. &gt;&gt; And brother, this day demands that. &gt;&gt; This day's got to have that. We'll either have that or we'll perish. &gt;&gt; SO THEN WE'VE GOT TO EMPTY OURSELVES OUT. Don't don't worry about what you can do and what you're able not to do and and and how good you can do it and how bad you're doing it AND ALL. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. JUST EMPTY YOURSELF OUT AND LET GOD FILL YOU. We've got to have that or we'll perish. &gt;&gt; Now, he cannot use our ability. Now, this word ability is the quality or state of being able, &gt;&gt; right? competence in doing something. But you remember what God said in I believe Zechariah, he said, "It's not by might nor by power, but by my spirit, sayith the Lord." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not by might, not by power, but by my spirit, sayith the Lord. Can you say amen? I I I just don't feel I just don't think that that we we ought to struggle in in what God has called us to do. Now, the Lord Taran, we we'll get more in in in into that, but but but WE'RE NOT UH I I just don't think we should be just exhausted and just, oh, I just don't know if I'm going to make it. I just I'm trying. Well, maybe maybe you're trying too hard. Maybe you're you're TRYING TO BE SOMETHING THAT GOD'S NOT CALLED YOU TO DO. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HELLO. &gt;&gt; WELL, it it's true. I I understand Satan fights us and and we fight. I I get that. But we've got to be we've got to be at at at ease, if I could say it that way, or comfortable, satisfied in the calling that God has called us with, &gt;&gt; and he's promised that he would give us grace, &gt;&gt; help us with, &gt;&gt; did he not? &gt;&gt; Is that NOT WHAT HE TOLD PAUL when Paul says, "Lord, just I" He said, "I I BESOUGHT THE LORD THREE TIMES TO take this away." It seemed to be a sticker in Paul's flesh. And Paul thought it was hindering him from doing more for God. And yet WHEN HE BESOUGHT THE LORD THREE TIMES, the Lord TOLD HIM, "PAUL, my grace is sufficient for thee. &gt;&gt; In thy weakness, my strength is made perfect." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, see, we find that God had a purpose for Paul's life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Ain't that right? And it wasn't all glorious, but yet there was a grace. &gt;&gt; A grace. &gt;&gt; You don't have to get burned out. There's a grace. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? THERE'S A GRACE for you mothers. There's a GRACE FOR YOU PREACHERS. THERE'S A GRACE FOR US PASTORS. THERE'S A GRACE FOR US FATHERS. THERE'S A GRACE FOR THE DEACONS. There's a GRACE FOR THE MUSICIANS. There's grace. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you may not feel that you're the best fit for the job, and you may give your excuses and and as to the reasons as to why you can't do it, but I I but but I'm not here to sympathize tonight. I just tell you, it ain't going to hold up &gt;&gt; in in in God's court. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; It it just won't hold up. Mighty men of the Bible gave excuses as to why they couldn't do it. They had their fears. They had their uncertainties. They had their complexes. &gt;&gt; They had their things that bothered them. And yet when God called them, they tried to give that as an excuse. God, I can't do that. Moses had a stuttering problem. &gt;&gt; Well, I CAN'T GO OUT THERE. WHAT you talking about? you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God didn't change his mind because God already knew it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and God didn't say, "Moses, that you know what? You really your your excuse holds up. I'm telling you. Duh. I don't know why I didn't think of that. &gt;&gt; Just go out there and just be be a shepherd. I'll go find somebody else." No. He called stuttering Moses &gt;&gt; to go before the king and say, "Let my people go." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; We we find see that that that there there was a lot. Gideon had his excuses. &gt;&gt; Uh um uh uh well, so many others had their excuses. Jonah had his excuses. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And and to us and to them, they were legit, &gt;&gt; right? but not to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the prophet said God could have chose the son to preach the gospel. He could have chose the wind. He could have chose anything. But he chose man to preach the gospel. He chose you mothers. He chose you fathers to raise children in this age, &gt;&gt; the most evil age, the most most insane age, the most darkest age ever, deceiving age. And yet, he didn't tell us. Now, I DON'T THINK Y'ALL can raise them. So, so, so don't don't don't you know uh uh they've got other plans for you to keep you from having children and and so you probably better not do that. &gt;&gt; No, that that ain't that ain't the truth. GOD'S GOT CONFIDENCE in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; So we find that the first thing that God done is is to be able to use man in in in in this age is that he redeemed a group of people and he made them his body here on earth. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Now let's go back in the beginning. Before the beginning, the first visible thing of God was a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? God is the spirit. No man has seen God at any time. But the first visual thing, visible thing by supernatural eye was the pillar of fire. See, and and so the prophet tells us this pillar of fire went out of God, which is the logos. ANOTHER PLACE HE SAID THE PILLAR OF FIRE is the anointing. &gt;&gt; It's Christ. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So when Peter when Jesus SAYS, "WHO DO MEN SAY THAT I the son of man AM?" AND PETER SAID, "THOU ART THE CHRIST." HE WASN'T JUST LOOKING AT THAT PLACE. HE WAS TAKING IT ALL THE WAY BACK FOR BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF TIME and said, "You're that logos. YOU'RE THAT PILLAR OF FIRE." AMEN. He identified who he really is. See, AND THIS PILLAR OF FIRE, brother said, is actually the attribute of the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; So this pillar of fire, Amen. That pillar of fire, Amen. Now that that pillar of fire, think of that. That's not another pillar of fire. That is the same pillar of fire that was there before the world was ever created. &gt;&gt; That pillar of fire came out of God. &gt;&gt; So that's not a a second pillar of fire. That's not the third pillar of fire. That's the original pillar of fire. It's the only pillar of fire. And it came out of God. That's the first visible form of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Isn't that awesome that we have a picture of that? &gt;&gt; Now, so the pillar of fire was the first body form of God &gt;&gt; and and so it was the only form that the spirit had and in that form he created heaven and earth. In that form he said let there be light and he created light. In that form he brooded over the earth. Amen. and Isaiah came up and birds begin to fly and and life come up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Came into existence. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And it's in that form, theophony form, pillar of fire, anointing that he would come down in the cool of the evening and brood among the trees and Adam and Eve would come and kneel before him and have fellowship with God. have communion with God with that pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The prophet said, "And the voice, a voice would come from that light and talk back to them." Ain't that right? Then you fast forward it. That same form pillar of fire was what Moses met &gt;&gt; at the burning bush. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a literal fire. It was that that was in that bush, &gt;&gt; A SUPERNATURAL FIRE THAT WOULD NOT GO OUT. THAT BUSH WOULD NOT BURN. IT WAS A A HOLY FIRE. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AND THE VOICE COME OUT OF THAT FIRE AND SPOKE TO MOSES. MOSES, TAKE off your shoes for the place you're standing is holy ground. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. THROUGH THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, AMEN. The prophet called that pillar of fire the angel of the covenant. Right. &gt;&gt; And and and it was the angel of the covenant. Amen. That that brought Israel out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Led. Now, you know, notice Moses led the children. I'm getting somewhere that Moses led the children of Israel. A prophet led the children of Israel. And and uh uh as God, the prophet said, would tell him where to go. Moses led the children of Israel as God in that pillar of fire led to would tell him where to go. So it's it was actually the supernatural being that was taking over Moses and leading the way. Moses was was uh uh well brother said Moses just got his information. Now now listen, Moses wasn't just a man. Moses realized that he was just weak and and and frail and he was a stutterer. He wasn't much. Uh when God totally stripped him, he just felt like HE WAS A NOBODY. THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTED HIM TO COME TO BECAUSE GOD NOW, AMEN, THROUGH that pillar of fire could anoint Moses and give him direction. And Moses instead of saying, "Well, I'm going to go this way cuz I think that's better." He would com submit to God and say, "Mo, God say, "Now, Moses, you go down and and follow this way." And Moses JUST AUTOMATICALLY GOT HIS INFORMATION AND BEGAN to lead the people in a certain direction and he led them to the the Red Sea. NOW, WHAT A STUPID IDEA. AMEN. SOME MAN, SOME A GENERAL, NO GENERAL, no smart man. If you're going to lead the people out of something away from the enemy, you're not going to lead THEM INTO A TRAP. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD HAD A HIS DESIRE. God had a plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND HE WOULD SHOW HIS POWER BY rolling back the Red Sea and letting the people walk forward that Moses had come to a place that he would yield himself to the pillar of fire. And God, brother Bram said, he was getting his message through there and giving it to the children of Israel on the road to a promised land. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Yeah. &gt;&gt; So he says, "The pillar of fire that called them out led them to the promised land under the anointing of a prophet." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, Moses was just a man without the anointing. And so are you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Us preachers, we're just preachers without the anointing. And you talking about bad preachers, we we probably would be just horrible preachers. I I am anyways. And and yet it would take AN ANOINTING. AMEN. WITHOUT THE ANOINTING, WHAT ARE WE as musicians? WITHOUT THE ANOINTING, WHAT ARE WE AS FATHERS AND MOTHERS? &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE ANOINTING, WHAT ARE WE? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So he says, see, the pillar of fire that called them out led them to the promised land under the anointing of a prophet. a pillar of fire that they could look at, led them to the promised land under anointed prophet. But then God bottled himself all up into one man, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; now the pillar of fire was in him in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Paul says in Colossians 2:94, "In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." AND JOHN THE BAPTIST SAW IT HAPPEN, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; He saw it HAPPEN WHEN HE BAPTIZED JESUS. Matthew 3:16, WHEN JESUS WAS BAPTIZED, AMEN, went up straight way out of the water, and lo, the heavens were opened up, and he John SAW THE SPIRIT OF GOD, AMEN, DESCENDING LIKE A dove and lightning upon him. Amen. and low a voice from heaven saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I am pleased to dwell." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just a lick of fire. It was all of God. &gt;&gt; Bottled up in a man. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram SAID THAT SAME ANOINTING CAME DOWN AT his baptism and went into Christ and dwelt IN HIM. AND JOHN knew it was him. He saw it happen. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So that pillar of fire was made flesh and dwelt among us. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Now just skipping through a lot here. But brother Brown said, "What was Jesus manifested for? To show God." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? A human being. God had a human being. God had a body on earth. Amen. To express himself. That's what Jesus was manifested for. To show God. TO SHOW GOD. NOT TO SHOW HUMAN ABILITY, BUT TO SHOW GOD. NOT TO SHOW HUMAN SMARTNESS, BUT TO SHOW GOD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; He was God. And through that purpose, he achieved a church that he, the fullness of God, might bring to pass every promise of God in these last days when he gets the preeminence in the church, the position, his place in the church. So we find in another place, brother Bram said, God came down in the image of man to redeem man and that brought man and God together. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth hugged and kissed each other. God and man, man embraced each other as fatherhood and sunship when the log go became flesh and dwelt among us. But then Jesus said, "I came from God and I go back to God." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And he did. He came from the pillar of fire and he returned back to being a pillar of fire. Ain't that right? So after his ascension, amen, he come as a pillar of fire. Uh uh Acts 226, Paul is given an account of his conversion. And he says, "As I made my journey and was come unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light. Not sunlight, not candle light, &gt;&gt; supernatural light. &gt;&gt; There shone from heaven a great light round about me." And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, "Saul, Saul, why perse persecutest thou me?" and I answered, "Who art thou, Lord?" &gt;&gt; He didn't just say, "Who art thou?" &gt;&gt; "Who art thou, LORD?" WELL, he only knew one Lord, and that was Jehovah. &gt;&gt; WHO ART THOU JEHOVAH? AND he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. &gt;&gt; See, so now he was manifesting himself in again in the form of a pillar of fire. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham said, "God changed himself from a pillar of fire to become a man. He dwelt in Jesus Christ, then changed himself from that back in the spirit again that he might dwell in man." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So now we read there in the book of Acts on the day of Pentecost. Amen. The same Holy Spirit, the same logos, the same anointing, pillar of fire, the same Christ that created all things in the beginning. Amen. And that was in the wilderness that led Moses and talked lip to ear to Moses and brought the children out of of of Egypt and and rode back the RED SEA AND PROVIDED FOR THEM EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. Now that same logos dropped down on the day of Pentecost. Now, now notice, Amen. Acts 2 and1. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them clothe tongues like as a fire, and it set up on each of them. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a pillar of fire coming down on one man. &gt;&gt; It was now LICKS OF FIRE coming and setting upon 120 people. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and they were all filled WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THEY WERE FILLED WITH THAT SAME LOGOS THAT JESUS had in fullness. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET SAID IT WAS SENT TO ANOINT other sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Now, it did not make them God. &gt;&gt; We're not gods. &gt;&gt; No. In a sense like God, we are not God, but we are anointed. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We are anointed. Everybody say, "I'm anointed." &gt;&gt; I'm anointed. Jesus said, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he hath anointed me to preach the gospel." Anointed me, amen, to set at liberty those that are captive. Anointed me. Can you say, "Amen." letting them know I'm not just doing this in my own self, but the father that dwelleth in me, he's doing the works. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; SO NOW, GOD DECIDED TO BYPASS YOUR WEAKNESSES. GOD DECIDED TO BYPASS YOUR FRAILTIES AND YOUR COMPLEXES AND AND YOUR EXCUSES AND HE DECIDED TO COME AND DWELL in you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO ANOINT YOU TO DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Anoint you. Second Coloss Corinthians 1:21. Now he which establishth us with you in Christ and hath anointed us is God. Same anointing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Right. So, it's not just now your flesh being anointed. It's not just your spirit being anointed. Amen. To prophesy and to dance and all of these things. But that anointing has COME DOWN TO ABIDE in you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. To make his abode IN YOU. AMEN. NOW, HE'S GOING TO WORK through you. &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? THEN THEN HOW COULD WE GIVE OUR OUR OUR OUR uh uh uh UH EXCUSES AS TO WHY WE CAN'T DO IT AND EXPECT GOD AMEN TO TO live by that. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; HE HE HE IS FAR ABOVE YOUR EXCUSES. &gt;&gt; YES, HE IS. &gt;&gt; HE'S FAR ABOVE OUR INCAPABILITIES. &gt;&gt; GOD DOESN'T NEED OUR CAPABILITIES. &gt;&gt; GOD DOESN'T USE OUR ABILITIES. &gt;&gt; Think about it. He just takes your body. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "When it come down on the day of Pentecost, it broke up and tongues of fire set upon each of them." It was God in this pillar fire, the logos, separating himself among his people, showing that Christ and the bride. See, God and his church are becoming one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I hope you understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. It may be just a little too simple, but that's okay. Christ and his church becoming one. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Not God superior and then here you are here with your complexes and inferior and he's expecting you to do SOMETHING AND YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. NO. GOD COME AND LIVED in you to raise you up. &gt;&gt; And now we becoming one. &gt;&gt; The works that I do shall you do also. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says this logos that was in him which was the spirit of God, the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons to God which is anointed with the same logos. &gt;&gt; Same logos. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You may say, "Oh, I just can't do it." But you're anointed with the same logos. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Every time a preacher gets behind the pulpit and BEGINS TO PREACH, HE DOESN'T GO BY HIS HOW HE FEELS. HE DOESN'T GO BY HIS ABILITIES. HE DOESN'T GO BY HIS SMARTNESS, BUT HE KNOWS HE'S ANOINTED WITH THE SAME LOGOS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ANOINTED. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So on the day of Pentecost, the prophet said, God the logos separated himself into men. God not in one person. He's in his church universal. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the works that I do shall you do also. Even greater than these &gt;&gt; shall you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? This is why Jesus said, "As the father has sent me, so send you." Prophet said, "How did the father send him?" By going with him. And how does Jesus send you? The same way the father sent him. He's going with us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He may send you out into this world on the job. He may send you to a church to preach TO A PEOPLE. HE MAY SEND YOU OUT INTO the school. He may send you out. Amen. And you're married and you're having the CHILDREN AND AND THE CHALLENGES ARE THERE. BUT HE SAID, "I SEND YOU THE WAY THE FATHER SENT ME." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'll go with you. &gt;&gt; I'll be with you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You're anointed as you're raising your children. You're anointed to raise THEM. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? &gt;&gt; So, the prophet said God was bottled and confined in one man, Jesus Christ. But now, everybody say, "Now, &gt;&gt; the scene's changed." &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's bottled and confined in the whole universal church of the living God. &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; So right now he says while God is here speaking with us in our hearts, he's in Africa. He's in Asia. He's in Europe. He's in England. Wherever believers are gathered together, there he is in the midst of them. &gt;&gt; Oh church, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not isolated alone. Oh no. He's with you. I believe. &gt;&gt; So if you have the Holy Spirit inside of you, then you've got a portion of God. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that ain't much." Oh, yes, it is much. &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus had the fullness of God. That's why he could do everything. But oh, I love the way how brother Brandham said that. He said, "You take go out to the ocean, you get a big dipper of water, spoonful of water." Amen. And pull that out of the ocean. Now that that water is in the cup, Amen. You ain't got all the water that's out there. You just got a little bit. But every element that is in that ocean is in this water. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The same element that's in that ocean in that whole body is in THAT SPOONFUL OF WATER. AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF GOD, THE SAME POWER OF GOD, THE SAME NATURE, THE SAME CHARACTER, THE SAME ABILITY TO CREATE, AMEN, AND SPEAK THE SPOKEN WORD is in you. If you've just got an ounce of God in you, &gt;&gt; just a little portion of God in you &gt;&gt; is enough to create heavens and earth. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; All that God was, he poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all that Christ was was poured over the church. Brother Brian said, "The last thing that the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power." In fullness. Everybody say, "In fullness." Now, he poured out his spirit on the day of Pentecost, and we're thankful for that. BUT IT WAS A PROMISE THAT THE SON OF MAN would be revealed in the evening time. I know there's a a preaching going on THAT THAT THAT WAS THE SON OF MAN BEING REVEALED on the DAY OF PENTECOST. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE JESUS said and it's not what the prophet said. It would be in this DAY THAT THE FULLNESS OF GOD THAT WAS POURED OUT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST WOULD COME INTO full manifestation in this last day. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's this day that the church is coming into adoption of sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's this day that the church as it comes into power, it comes into full manifestation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we have worked in a small measure. So been working in small measure all the way through while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body. But when that head and body unites together, I say it has, &gt;&gt; I say, we've come to an invisible union. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the body and the head has united together. The full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just exactly like that. You say, "WELL, I DON'T FEEL GOOSEBUMPS." YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL GOOSEBUMPS. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WELL, I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL LIKE ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP, BUT THE SAME POWER IS HERE REGARDLESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT. RECOGNIZE YOUR DAY. RECOGNIZE THE TIME GOD HAS SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE THE SAME YESTERDAY, UH, TODAY AND FOREVER. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT THE SON OF MAN HAS BEEN REVEALED. &gt;&gt; This isn't just a little tinkling. This isn't just a little move. THIS IS THE POWER OF THE GOD IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. I believe &gt;&gt; even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to the skies. The dynamics is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Now watch. Paul talks about this time happening in Ephesians 1:22 when he says, "And hath put all things." Everybody say, "All things." all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things. Everybody say all things to the church, &gt;&gt; which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all. Can you say amen? Christ becomes head of the church. Ain't that right? Amen. When the head and the body unite, Christ becomes head. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's our identification is by the headship. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Is true. &gt;&gt; Now, Colossians 1:18, "And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in &gt;&gt; all &gt;&gt; all things." Everybody say, "All things he might have the preeminence." &gt;&gt; Church, we are here. There there there is not a mistake that Brother Brandon preached the message of prisoner. How many's ever listened to that? A prisoner of Christ. If you haven't, you need to go go home, listen to a prisoner. &gt;&gt; There. It's not a mistake that brother BRANDON PREACHED THAT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE TIME THAT CHRIST IS TO HAVE THE PREEMINENCE OVER ALL THINGS IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; He wants preeminence over your life. He wants preeminence in this in in the pulpit. He wants preeminence in your ministry. He wants preeminence in the way you raise your family and the way you you be a wife and the way you be a husband. He wants preeminence in everything and all things. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? HE WANTS PREEMINENCE IN THE WAY, AMEN. that you your YOU CHILDREN ARE RAISED UP AND AND AND HE WANTS PREEMINENCE. &gt;&gt; That word to have preeminence in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I won't keep you long, but let me ask you, what was Paul's secret to being used of God? Paul would indirectly I guess tell us Ephesians 3:1 for this calls I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:1 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called. &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Timothy, I believe 1:8, "Be thou not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner." &gt;&gt; Paul just didn't consider himself a Christian. He considered himself a prisoner. &gt;&gt; Not in natural chains, even though he spent a third, I think onethird or so of his life in prison in in dark dungeons. And that's what caused him to go blind is in he lived in darkness most of his life uh preaching as preaching. He he he uh but but he he was more than just a prisoner in natural chains. He was a prisoner of love &gt;&gt; to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he would say it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me. &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Brandham says, he says we've got to he says we've got to get ourselves and our abilities out of the way and surrender to the will and power of God. Say, "Well, brother, I can preach." Well, he can't use that as long as you can preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all right. I can do this and I can do that. You can't do nothing. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We can't We can't do nothing. &gt;&gt; And God allows us I I brother Amos, I truly believe that that God allows us to blunder. &gt;&gt; God allows us to trip up. God allows us to fall flat on our face. Not so we can develop complexes and inferiority and withdraw ourselves and say, "Well, I'm just not good at that." But so that we would learn to humble ourselves &gt;&gt; and say, "Father, hold my hand." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember brother Brandham talking of that time that Billy Paul needed to go to the bathroom. It was dark and he said, "Daddy, I I got to go bathroom." He go, "Okay." He said, "Billy, just just right down the hall. just go. But daddy, I want you to take me. I'm just tired, Billy. Just just go on. It's It's okay. Dad's here. Oh, Daddy, I I want you. So, okay. So, he got up and he said, "Daddy, let me hold your hand." So, he held his hand. Well, there was a toy in in the darkness in that room and Billy Paul fell. I believe I'm telling the story right, something to that effect. But Billy Paul fell and when he got up, he looked at his dad and said, "Daddy, why don't you just hold my hand?" And I think that's the way we want is not to hold God's hand, but God, hold my hand. &gt;&gt; You know the dangers. You know where we're at. You know the traps. You know everything about it. &gt;&gt; For sure. &gt;&gt; God, just hold my hand. &gt;&gt; I'm nothing without you, &gt;&gt; but I am everything with you in me. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham, he says, see, so he says, then God can't use that because you can't do nothing. But if you'll yield yourself to God and let him do it. You say, "Well, Brother Brandham, I know I'm a teacher." Well, as long as you're the teacher, well, he won't get very far. But the Holy Spirit is our teacher. Sure it is. God sent the Holy Spirit to be tutor over the church, right? See, so what he does is he raises men to teach through them. What he does is he raises men to speak through them, to preach the gospel through them. He raises up up uh uh mothers to raise their children through them. Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He raises us fathers, amen, to to lead our children through through the father, through us. &gt;&gt; It's God doing the leading through us. &gt;&gt; Sure it is. Brother Bram said if the musicians will come. But Brother Bram said God sometimes takes his people out like that and shaves a few of their own wheels off. That's right. &gt;&gt; Shows them that they can't do just what they wanted to do. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? They're not in liberty to do what they want to do before they could come into full power and be a love servant to Christ. They have to be shaved off and then presented. Sometimes he takes them to the desert to do that. to shave them off and then bring them out, the anointed one, to fulfill the purpose that he's ordained them to be. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he does. &gt;&gt; I've heard it said, and I don't know if the prophet said it or who, but he said, "God can do more with one man in five minutes than a man can do in a lifetime." &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt; When God can get us in his hands and control us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think this is where we're at. There's spirits that are everywhere and and they're not just looking at age groups, but they they get into our children. And I don't say our children are demonpossessed. You should never believe that. But I do say just as the spirit works on us sometimes in a bad mood, spirit takes advantage of that. Satan tries to take advantage of things. we get up wake up on the wrong side of the bed or we have he he'll he'll cause a certain crisis and then get us try to get our spirit in an uproar. &gt;&gt; Well, he he'll try to work on our children to get our children to do things and act things. Even didn't brother Brown say that like when when the prayer line was getting ready to go or the end of the service or maybe an altar call then Satan will move on a little kid and cause him to start screaming or something like that. Satan does that. doesn't mean that the that kid's demonpossessed. It's just Satan working through them. So, see, we understand as believers that that that when our children are acting up or or well, our husbands or our wives or or an and act in the church is starting to trying to create that's that's a spirit that Satan is trying to move in to cause havoc. &gt;&gt; But we are anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are anointed. And if we can understand that, when you're at YOUR WITS END AND SAY, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO." REMEMBER, you're anointed. God didn't cause you to to have a family on to fail with that family. God didn't call me to be a preacher and to fail. GOD DIDN'T CALL US TO TO BE WHATEVER WE'RE DOING AND FAIL. But as long as you're in the line of duty, remember that as long as Moses and the children of Israel was in THE LINE OF DUTY, GOD STAYED with him. Through his failures, his mistakes, and his ups and his downs, and all of those things, God stayed with him because he was in the line of duty. Can you say amen? Aren't you glad you're in the line of duty? We ain't stopping. WE AIN'T QUITTING. WE'RE NOT UH UH UH uh uh stepping off to do our own thing. WE'RE RIGHT IN THE LINE OF DUTY. No matter how hard, no matter how challenging, NO MATTER WHAT GIANT stands in our way, I'm anointed. I'm anointed. Bless the name of the Lord. Amen. What's up? Oh, I have nothing. I have nothing without you. Sing that again. Take these hands. Oh, take these hands. Lift them up. have not the strength to praise you near enough. Oh, I am nothing. I have nothing without you. Oh, take my voice and pour it out. Let it sing the songs of mercy I have found. For I am nothing.

Oh, without you. Sing it now. And all my soul needs is all your love to cover me. So all the world So everyone that I come in contact with can see I'm nothing without you. Sing it now. Oh, and all my soul soul is all your love to cover me. So all the world will see I am nothing without you. Oh yes. Yes. In the presence. of Jehovah, God Almighty. Oh prince of peace, trles vanish, hearts are mening in the presence. of the king. Can we stand to our feet and sing it now? Oh, he entered the praise. Bless the name of the Lord, Prince of Peace. Trles vanish, hearts are bended in the presence of the king. as they just play softly. &gt;&gt; God bless you is our prayer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; May God be with you. May he use you in a great way. Amen. To complete the work. I truly believe that we're not going to have too many days left and we want to do all that we can for the kingdom of God and whatever he would want us to do. May God help us to be surrendered to even just well my prayer is God just shave me strip me of all my will that I can do something for the Lord. Amen. And uh just keep one another in our prayer. And um the prayer requests that were mentioned, we want to keep them in our prayer. And um uh brother Wayne, you know, will be here the 19th, 20th, and 21st, so in couple weeks, I guess. And so tell your friends about it. And I encourage you to to pray, pray for the meeting. And um we just, you know, my heart's desires, not that God would bring in souls. So, I'd love for that to happen, but just the needs that are here present and I know we got some that need the Holy Ghost and I'd love to see that take place and and uh healing miracles. And so, um I just believe that's that's and it's not brother Wayne that has that uh he's he's not the magic guy, but I believe he has dynamic ministry. And I believe if we come do our part and that is come expecting God, be prayed up and presenting the needs before God and let God just have his way. I I believe God will do that. Amen. And so uh tell tell folks about the meeting and uh we we won't be feeding anyone. Um, I think we were going to try to have something uh uh Sunday uh of the meeting, but other than that, we won't be feeding anyone. So, might let people know about that. But uh uh there are plenty of restaurants and so we'd love for anyone to come and be a part of it. But God bless you and uh just good to have again different ones that out out uh have them have y'all home and I hope everybody had a good time of fellowship with friends and family. Amen. Let's just bow our heads as we dismiss. Uh brother Terry, do you want to dismiss us?
