[36:57] special way this evening. Lord, touch
[36:59] the hearts and the lives of the people.
[37:01] Lord, we ask you, Father, just to come
[37:03] down, Lord, and and and and walk the
[37:06] aisles, Father. And Lord, we ask you,
[37:08] Father, just to calm the nerves. We ask
[37:10] you, Lord, Jesus, just just just let
[37:12] there be such a special anointing here
[37:13] tonight, Lord, we pray. We love you and
[37:15] thank you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[37:18] Y'all can be seated.
[37:28] Amen. Do you love the Lord? Amen. Amen.
[37:31] So, wanting to speak for just a few
[37:33] minutes tonight. I'm not going to be
[37:34] super long. Um on calling Jesus on the
[37:37] scene and uh we can we can start over in
[37:41] in in in Abraham. And this may be a
[37:43] little bit different, but it was what's
[37:44] what's been on my heart. So, I I hope
[37:46] it's a blessing. Um but but we we we we
[37:49] notice that over in in in in Abraham or
[37:53] with Abraham, he he was um he was just
[37:57] an an idoltor. He was an idol
[38:00] worshipper. His family made idols. And
[38:02] God had called him out not by anything
[38:05] that Abraham had done or that anything
[38:07] Abraham could do. But God called him out
[38:10] by election and and through God's and
[38:12] God through God's through God's through
[38:16] God's fornowledge and through his his
[38:19] his his choosing. And we know yes as as
[38:24] Christians that we can never we can
[38:26] never choose God. God God chooses us. Um
[38:30] um um
[38:32] there there there's a saying that says
[38:35] that says that says that that that that
[38:38] I chose God and that's just not not
[38:40] true. God has has chosen us and it's
[38:43] through his his fornowledge and and
[38:46] predestination. So so so so man so man
[38:49] does not does not does not does not does
[38:52] not seek God. He it's not it's it's not
[38:54] in him to seek God. It's but God through
[38:57] his fornowledge and his choosing God
[39:01] God's God God
[39:04] seek see seek see see see see see see
[39:05] see see see see see see see see see see
[39:05] see see see see seek see see see see see
[39:06] see see see see see see see see see see
[39:06] see see see see see see seek see seeks
[39:07] us and in the very beginning when man
[39:09] when mankind fell fell from from from
[39:13] grace his nature was changed and he and
[39:15] and he run away from God and he hid from
[39:17] God and that's still his nature yet yet
[39:20] yet today and and
[39:24] um BB because Because because because
[39:26] while while man is yet a sinner, God God
[39:30] seeks us. And uh brother Brandham said
[39:35] said he he said he said he said
[39:38] sometimes I notice sometimes I notice
[39:40] people go go out here and I was standing
[39:42] by by a big museum here
[39:45] here not not long ago a and I se and I
[39:49] seen the I seen the analysis of a human
[39:51] body. A man that weighed 150 pounds was
[39:54] worth 84 cents. 84 cents in the and the
[39:58] chemicals. He he said he said he said,
[40:00] "Could you think of it and think and and
[40:03] then you think you're you're somebody
[40:05] and you're worth 84 cents?" That's
[40:07] right. He he said, "But yet you put a
[40:09] $10 hat on 84 cents and you think you're
[40:12] and you think you're you're you're
[40:14] somebody else." He he and he said, you
[40:17] see, you wrap you wrap a
[40:20] $500 dollar coat around you and think
[40:23] you're somebody when you're just 80 80
[40:25] 84 cents. He said, you sure can take
[40:27] care of that of that of that 84 cents,
[40:30] though. He he said he said, "But
[40:32] remember in there, you've got a soul
[40:34] that's worth that's worth 10,000 worlds
[40:36] and let and and you let the devil push
[40:38] that around
[40:39] around any way." Yes. Yes.
[40:43] That that that's right. So the Bible
[40:46] says that we're we're born into the
[40:48] world and we're born into the world
[40:50] speaking lies. Our our nature is at such
[40:53] that we are and at at an enmity um
[40:57] against God. We
[41:00] because because we are lost and and
[41:04] without God. So what we have to have it
[41:07] is a nature change. And and brother Bam
[41:10] talks about how how how the brooding of
[41:13] God came over and he and and and brooded
[41:17] it brooded over over over the over
[41:19] over the earth and and and and
[41:23] and the word the word brood means means
[41:26] it means making love and brother Brandon
[41:30] brother Brandham described that love
[41:31] like a dove. It's it it's couping over
[41:34] it. And Andy and And and he and he said
[41:37] those those great wings would just would
[41:39] just come and hover over the earth and
[41:40] just coupoo at it and and brood over it.
[41:43] And and and and and the earth began to
[41:47] begin to take its shape and its form.
[41:48] And up came the the bushes and the plant
[41:51] life and the animal life. And then and
[41:53] and then and then and then and then and
[41:57] then God took those 84 cents worth worth
[42:01] of dust and he came and formed it and
[42:05] and and
[42:06] and he he he created humankind with that
[42:11] and and then he began to he began to
[42:13] brood to to brood o o over it and he
[42:16] made love to it and a and and yet if
[42:19] you're called and you're predestinated
[42:21] you're called and your predestinated
[42:23] nated. You you will see that and and and
[42:27] and you respond back. It's a love affair
[42:30] between between between
[42:33] between you you and and God. Romans in
[42:37] Romans 9 9:11 says it says for the
[42:41] children being not yet born neither
[42:43] having done any good or evil that the
[42:45] purpose of God according to the election
[42:47] might stand not of works but of him that
[42:52] calleth and another place in another
[42:55] place brother Brandham brother Brandham
[42:57] did describe the the brooding of God a
[43:00] as as as the logos of God where God's
[43:04] spirit
[43:04] came and and He he he he he was he was
[43:09] he was he he he was Jehovah and that
[43:11] that the the very spirit of God came out
[43:14] came out from God and separated itself
[43:17] and and it began to it began to to to um
[43:21] brood to to
[43:23] to brood over the earth and it began to
[43:26] coup at the earth and then that logos of
[43:28] God came down and it created it created
[43:31] man mankind and then and then that that
[43:35] that that that
[43:37] that logos came down and and and
[43:40] and created a body called called called
[43:44] called Mel Mel Melzdc and stepped down
[43:49] and and into that that body and he met
[43:53] with Abraham there there there on on the
[43:58] backside on the back side of the desert
[44:00] the the the the the logos of God where
[44:03] God would sit there And he would take
[44:05] the earth and he would and he and and
[44:09] brother Brandham said that he would take
[44:10] that the sun and he would speak it and
[44:14] that earth earth would begin to the or
[44:18] or he he he said the Adams would begin
[44:21] to to to form. He said he said one to
[44:23] pop off here and one woman to pop off
[44:24] there and and then he said and and then
[44:28] he said the the the the the sun the the
[44:31] sun be began to sh to form and take
[44:34] shape and then God took it and he threw
[44:35] it and he and he said he he he he he let
[44:38] it go for 100 for 100 for 100 million
[44:42] years and then he stopped it and then
[44:44] and then the
[44:45] locust of of God would take these stars
[44:48] and he he begin to begin to to put them
[44:51] here and to and to and to put them there
[44:55] and he would stop them. Right. Right.
[44:57] Right. And and all these exact spots.
[44:59] And God said, and God said the very
[45:01] first Bible was formed was formed in the
[45:04] heavens through through God where where
[45:06] where where he he would set there he he
[45:10] he would set there and form it just just
[45:13] exactly perfectly and to to where to to
[45:16] to where to to where to to where to to
[45:18] where it became begin to fall in his
[45:20] perfect place and his perfect timing.
[45:22] These storms the these these stars that
[45:24] we see and all these trees and
[45:26] everything, it's not random. God has
[45:28] predestinated them them them them them
[45:29] them them them them them them them them
[45:29] them them them them them them them them
[45:30] them them them them them them them them
[45:30] them them them them them them them them
[45:30] them them them them them them them them
[45:30] them them them them them them them them
[45:30] them them them them them them them them
[45:30] them them them them them them them them
[45:30] them them them them them them them them
[45:30] them them them them them them to to to
[45:33] to be there since since since since
[45:35] before the heavens was was ever formed
[45:39] and so so so so so so after so after
[45:42] after mankind after mankind had sinned
[45:45] he he he had marred his soul he was in
[45:47] such a relationship where where it was
[45:49] where God had had said had had said let
[45:51] us form man into into into
[45:54] into our image and and So at at first it
[45:58] wasn't even a physical being. It was
[46:00] just a spirit of Adam walking walking in
[46:03] the in the in in in
[46:05] in the garden. Mankind had was literally
[46:08] the logos of Christ sitting there
[46:10] walking walking in the garden. And then
[46:13] and then after that God had had had
[46:16] had created a body for him. And then
[46:20] from that body he he he he took out out
[46:23] out Eve. And when that man had fallen
[46:26] fallen that logos the the the very very
[46:29] spirit of God had had had departed had
[46:32] had had departed had departed from that
[46:34] man where where where where where where
[46:37] where where where where man had become a
[46:39] fallen being a and and and yet and and
[46:42] and and yet all the way down all the way
[46:45] down all the way down through throughout
[46:46] time God had promised man that that that
[46:49] he would come and and restore her her or
[46:53] him him him back again and God when God
[46:56] with the very log go of Christ God the
[46:59] very deity of Christ stepped down into
[47:01] human body on on on earth on earth and
[47:04] he died and he died for us on
[47:07] Calvary he he he he he then he then he
[47:11] then came and he then came and he a and
[47:15] and he restored man back again
[47:18] in in in that that that garden as as
[47:23] restored son and daughter of
[47:26] God. Why? Who? Why? Who? And we ask
[47:29] ourselves, who is God? He is the one
[47:31] that's that that that that's that that
[47:33] stood out there. And he rolled the
[47:35] stars. Brother Random said that that
[47:38] that that he that he rolled the stars
[47:40] the stars off of his hands and and the
[47:42] world he rolled the worlds out of his
[47:44] hands and he made the things which do
[47:46] not which do not not
[47:49] uh appear. And he says deity and deity
[47:52] himself lives in man. The the creator
[47:56] that made heavens and earth lives in
[47:58] mankind. Brother Bam says he he says he
[48:01] says he says why he says why. No wonder
[48:04] cripples when when you realize that that
[48:07] when you realize that that that you can
[48:09] can can can can straighten out because
[48:11] the the the
[48:14] the creators here
[48:17] the he he he said he said no wonder the
[48:19] blind they can't see o opens up he said
[48:22] because the the the
[48:24] the creators here the creator who who
[48:27] who who who he said the Bible said we
[48:30] who are sons and daughters of God his
[48:32] offspring
[48:33] Now then we are something like God was.
[48:35] Jesus said said himself said himself it
[48:39] is written you are gods written in your
[48:42] law. We become a part of God a son of
[48:44] God by adoption through Jesus Christ.
[48:47] Therefore if you realize that the very
[48:49] God that made the dirt and the earth and
[48:51] whatever is here is living among men.
[48:53] Where is our faith at at at at friends?
[48:57] He said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
[48:59] took his blood and went through the
[49:01] heavens, the heavens of of heavens and
[49:03] condemned every devil, took the keys of
[49:05] death and hell and sat down. And when he
[49:07] died on Calvary, he bowed his head. And
[49:09] as far as the atonement was made, and
[49:11] everything that you've got that you have
[49:13] got uh uh need of in this journey from
[49:16] earth all the way to to to to glory," he
[49:20] screamed, "It is finished. There is
[49:22] nothing else to to to
[49:24] to be added to it." Nothing else can can
[49:28] take away from it. That settles the
[49:29] Bible. The Bible is finished. The plan
[49:31] of God is finished. The atonement is
[49:33] made and the devil is defeated. And the
[49:35] only thing that we have to do is look
[49:37] and live. God's word God's word did
[49:43] declares that that that that Jesus
[49:45] Christ is the same is the same
[49:47] yesterday, today, and forever. So he's
[49:50] the same in power. He's the same in
[49:52] principles, the same in in in in in in
[49:58] in healing. And so so so so
[50:01] so it's it's it's who he is now. It's
[50:04] who he was yesterday. And it's who and
[50:06] it's who it's who it's who it's who he
[50:08] he he will always always be be because
[50:12] God is it is exactly is exactly is
[50:16] exactly the
[50:18] the the same. you guys have to help me
[50:21] out. I don't know what's I'm struggling
[50:22] tonight for some reason. And so it's
[50:25] just his attitude has to be the same
[50:27] towards every case that he has ever ever
[50:29] ever he has ever dealt with or or or or
[50:33] he did wrong at the first time. When
[50:35] when he dealt when he dealt when he
[50:37] dealt with the case when he dealt with
[50:40] the case the way the the way he did, he
[50:44] he said it's got to be. So, so we can
[50:47] see that that that that that God that
[50:50] that that these disciples and brother
[50:52] Random has talked about this in that
[50:54] message the the testimony on the sea.
[50:56] The disciples they had just come away
[50:58] away from this marvelous meeting that
[51:01] the God he had watched they had watched
[51:03] God raise the dead, heal the sick. Um
[51:06] the blind eyes were were were opened up.
[51:10] the the he he God had had literally
[51:12] taken taken five five loaves of bread
[51:15] and and and and and
[51:18] and two the two fish and multiplied and
[51:21] fed and and and and fed the five the the
[51:25] 5000.
[51:27] They had watched the lame walk and and
[51:31] and and the dumb and and the dumb to
[51:33] speak and and and and so so they're
[51:36] rolling out there out there on the sea
[51:38] to meet Jesus on the other side. And
[51:39] they began they were rejoicing. They had
[51:41] just gotten out of the greatest meeting
[51:43] the the greatest revival that that that
[51:44] they had ever seen. Seeing God the they
[51:47] were just rejoicing about it. and and
[51:50] and and they began to to to to to
[51:54] to testify to to to
[51:59] testify about it. They were they were so
[52:01] excited what with they began to began to
[52:03] talk about about the miracles they had
[52:05] seen on this day and the miracles that
[52:07] they had that they had had seen here and
[52:09] they and they and they seen seen seen
[52:12] this is seen seen there and they the
[52:15] excitement that they begin to see
[52:16] because the very thing that what God had
[52:19] promised all throughout the the old the
[52:21] old the the the old the old the old
[52:25] testament had begun had begun and they
[52:27] would see the manifestation of it of it
[52:30] of it of it of it in and their day and
[52:33] and and in in in their in their in their
[52:38] hour. And so so so so so so they they
[52:44] begin to see that that with Jehovah of
[52:47] the Old Testament that it was being
[52:49] manifested and Jesus
[52:51] Christ of the new God had had
[52:54] had had had showed up in in flesh and
[52:58] and was manifesting him himself himself
[53:01] himself in these last days or or in in
[53:04] in in their day. So, so and and and so
[53:09] and so, so, so, so, so, so, so,
[53:11] Nathaniel began to talk about, he began
[53:13] to say, um, um, he began to talk about
[53:15] how, how how when he was setting when he
[53:18] was sitting under the fig tree and, and,
[53:20] and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[53:20] and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[53:20] and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[53:20] and, and, and, and, and, and, and he
[53:21] was, he, he he he was sitting there and,
[53:23] and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[53:23] and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[53:23] and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[53:23] and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[53:24] and, and, and, and, and, and, and,, and,
[53:24] and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[53:24] and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[53:24] and, and, um, Andrew Andrew, I I I, I,
[53:27] I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
[53:27] I, I, I, I, I, I, I I think it was,
[53:28] well, was was, he came and got him. and
[53:31] and and and when and and and when
[53:34] Nathaniel had showed up at Jesus's in
[53:36] Jesus' presence, Jesus said said,
[53:39] "Behold, an Israelite and in whom in
[53:42] whom in whom there there is no guile."
[53:45] And he said, "Master, when did when did
[53:48] did did you know me?" And he said, and
[53:50] he said, "Before Andrew saw you or be be
[53:53] before Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Before Andrew
[53:55] Andrew Andrew saw you um or got you, I
[53:59] saw you. I saw you on on on under on
[54:02] under on under on under on under on
[54:02] under on under on under on under on
[54:02] under on the the the the
[54:04] the victory and a and and and the
[54:07] prophet has taught us that that that
[54:10] that Nathaniel was was was somebody who
[54:13] who was he was a student of the
[54:14] scriptures. He he he he he he he know
[54:18] the the the the the
[54:21] um scriptures and he knew and he knew
[54:23] what had had happened when when Abraham
[54:26] when um Abraham and and Melzdc was was
[54:31] what was sitting there and God and and
[54:33] and God called out out Sarah Sarah Sarah
[54:37] for for laughing at him and and so
[54:41] Nathaniel began to recognize that that
[54:43] the very God that that had come in the
[54:46] flesh and was talking and was talking to
[54:48] to to to Abraham was the very same God
[54:52] in the flesh. And the flesh standing
[54:54] standing standing standing be be before
[54:57] him him again. He had he had recognized
[55:00] the scriptural sign that that was that
[55:02] that was promised to him to him to him
[55:05] to him in those last days. So, so and
[55:09] and and and
[55:10] and they began to talk about how how how
[55:13] how God Jehovah had done had done had
[55:16] done had done throughout the day. And
[55:18] they were sitting there just overjoyed
[55:20] and rejoicing. And when they talked
[55:22] about and and they knew the stories of
[55:24] how of of of how of of how God would
[55:28] feed the children of of of of Israel as
[55:31] as as they marched across the desert,
[55:32] they would they would they would feed
[55:33] him with with with with man every day
[55:36] and water would come forth would come
[55:38] forth would come forth forth out of the
[55:40] rock and and and all the stories that
[55:42] they knew that they knew that they knew
[55:44] from from from their from their from
[55:47] their their their childhood was now
[55:49] standing. They were seeing the
[55:51] manifestation of of the promises. Oh,
[55:53] they got excited about it. You begin to
[55:56] see h how how how how
[56:00] how that that that that all the promises
[56:04] of of what Abraham had prophesied about
[56:06] and all the stuff and and all the stuff
[56:08] that Moses had prophesied about and
[56:10] Isaiah and and and all these prophets
[56:12] and all these prophets prophets prophets
[56:14] all these prophets throughout history
[56:17] they were seeing the very manifestation
[56:19] of the very logos of Christ Christ of
[56:22] Christ standing before them them. Oh,
[56:26] and and and and he he he was sitting
[56:29] there talking about talking about this
[56:32] and and and they began to talk about how
[56:35] how how how they saw that that that
[56:37] blind
[56:38] Barnameus just just a couple days just a
[56:42] couple of days of days of days be
[56:46] be before then and and how how how blind
[56:50] Barn made us year after year after year
[56:53] had sat by the gate and had begged of
[56:54] arms
[56:55] But but but but the prophet has taught
[56:58] us how how that h how how that how that
[57:01] Bararddmus had had a had a mom who who
[57:05] who
[57:05] who would who would who would who would
[57:09] who would set him on his lap and and and
[57:13] and she would she would begin to tell
[57:16] him to tell him the stories of of the
[57:17] old. She told him about about Elijah
[57:20] about Elijah and Elisha uh walking
[57:22] walking arm in- arm arm and arm through
[57:25] through the streets of Jericho and and
[57:27] Elijah Elijah smoke smokeote that
[57:30] smokeote that that that that river with
[57:33] with his mantle and the and the waters
[57:35] just rolled back and Barnameus was
[57:37] sitting there saying saying I'm not he
[57:40] he's I'm not a couple hundred hundred
[57:42] yards away away from that very spot
[57:45] right now and he would he would sit
[57:47] there and
[57:48] And he he was he was he was sitting
[57:50] thinking about this and he and how his
[57:53] mother would would tell him the stories
[57:54] of of of how of how how Moses had had
[57:58] part of the Red
[58:00] Sea and and and how all these different
[58:04] all these different these different
[58:05] these different these different heroes
[58:07] of the faith.
[58:09] And and and after a while after a while
[58:11] after a while
[58:13] Barnameus started to say he had started
[58:16] to to um hear here here he started to
[58:22] hear something. He started to hear a
[58:24] crowd come come walking up the street
[58:26] and and he said some of them were
[58:28] laughing and jeering and some of them
[58:29] were were crying out hosana on on onto
[58:33] on onto the king and and and and
[58:37] Barameus grabbed a man and said and said
[58:40] and said what is this? And he said, and
[58:42] he said, "Jesus, Jesus of of Nazareth."
[58:46] And he began to think, "I've I've heard
[58:48] of him." And and he he thought about all
[58:50] the miracles he had heard about about
[58:51] how about the lame walking and the and
[58:53] the and the and the dead and the and the
[58:55] dead coming back to life. And and
[58:57] Barardus cried jumped up and cried out,
[59:00] "Son, thou, thou, son of David, have
[59:02] mercy on me." And Jesus and Jesus turned
[59:05] around and and and and healed him. and
[59:08] be in and Barnameus the very things that
[59:10] that that man had had had heard about
[59:14] since sitting on his mama's lap
[59:16] lap lap
[59:18] lap a as a little boy he had sat there
[59:22] he he had heard the stories of of of of
[59:26] the of the great Jehovah God and and how
[59:30] how mighty God was and all the works
[59:32] that Jehovah that that that that
[59:35] that Jehovah had son. And there was
[59:38] Jehovah, the logos of God, standing
[59:42] standing and and and and and in front of
[59:45] him again, manifesting himself that he
[59:48] was the same yesterday, today, and
[59:50] forever.
[59:51] Oh my those those
[59:55] disciples were were
[59:58] were th those those disciples those
[1:00:01] disciples were excited about it and and
[1:00:04] they began to see what God had had had
[1:00:08] done through this one and through that
[1:00:09] one and and through this individual and
[1:00:11] that one a and they begin to praise God
[1:00:14] and to worship God. But but but but
[1:00:17] right then and there is when Satan when
[1:00:18] Satan has come up and and he saw him and
[1:00:21] he and he and he and he and he saw them
[1:00:24] them them them them them them them them
[1:00:24] them them them them them them them them
[1:00:24] them them them them them them them them
[1:00:25] them them them them them them them them
[1:00:25] them them them them them them them them
[1:00:25] them them them them testifying and
[1:00:26] that's when when he said when he said
[1:00:28] Jesus is not with them I'm going to sink
[1:00:30] them
[1:00:31] now and and and and and the the waves
[1:00:36] began to come up and began to to rock
[1:00:38] the boat and began to do this and and
[1:00:40] began to do that and and and Peter
[1:00:43] and and his brothers were were were were
[1:00:46] were worse worse were wor worse worse
[1:00:49] were worse worse worse were worse semen
[1:00:53] their entire lives they knew exactly
[1:00:54] exactly how to set the sail and and
[1:00:57] and and
[1:00:59] and how how how to row a certain way and
[1:01:02] and how to do this and that but it got
[1:01:04] to the point where where where where
[1:01:06] after they had done everything that they
[1:01:07] could do and then they and they and then
[1:01:10] and then they begin to they they begin
[1:01:13] to to to to cry out and then Jesus
[1:01:16] showed up showed up showed up on the
[1:01:19] scene saying it is I be not afraid.
[1:01:22] Brother Brandham said says say says say
[1:01:25] says say says say say say say say say
[1:01:27] say say say say say say say say say say
[1:01:27] say say say says that ju just just think
[1:01:30] friends that that in the ministry that I
[1:01:33] have had I have had from the Lord alone
[1:01:35] I've seen many many many times more
[1:01:38] miracles performed than what is written
[1:01:40] than what is
[1:01:41] written a and the Bible that that that
[1:01:44] Jesus Christ has done in these three
[1:01:46] years in one unit one group o of of of
[1:01:50] of his his ministry and and one group he
[1:01:55] has done more more miracles than than
[1:01:56] has been written in in this in this his
[1:02:01] Bible. Everything that that can be
[1:02:02] written in this Bible except leprosy
[1:02:04] that I know of has been has been healed
[1:02:07] even to three specific cases of people
[1:02:09] who were pronounced dead are living are
[1:02:11] living are living are are living tonight
[1:02:13] healthy and strong. Who did that? Jesus
[1:02:16] Christ. He's the same yesterday, today,
[1:02:19] and forever. And he and he is here
[1:02:21] tonight. And he Jesus was the rock that
[1:02:23] was in the wilderness that followed the
[1:02:25] children of Israel. What God has done in
[1:02:27] those
[1:02:29] days. What God has done in in in those
[1:02:32] days in in those days, he has to do
[1:02:35] again in these days. In these last days
[1:02:37] that we are standing in and living in
[1:02:39] now, or else he's not God. For he is the
[1:02:41] same yesterday, today, and
[1:02:43] forever. Now, now we can look at a
[1:02:46] covenant for just a couple minutes. a a
[1:02:48] covenant is is is kind of an odd thing.
[1:02:51] Um, here in America, we we we
[1:02:55] we shake hands and and I think in China,
[1:02:58] they um throw some salt on on each
[1:03:00] other. But but but but but
[1:03:03] but in the but
[1:03:05] but in the Bible days on in that time
[1:03:09] they would they would they would they
[1:03:12] would take a beast and and and and and
[1:03:14] slaughter it and they and they would and
[1:03:16] they and one man would stand on one side
[1:03:17] and one man would would
[1:03:19] would stand on on the other and and and
[1:03:22] and and they would and and and they
[1:03:26] would they would write their their their
[1:03:29] their their contract cont or or the
[1:03:31] agreement or or
[1:03:34] whatever it was that they had. And they
[1:03:37] would they would they would they would
[1:03:38] they would they would tear the thing in
[1:03:39] two and say and say and say a and say
[1:03:44] and say um
[1:03:46] see what they would do is take an oath
[1:03:49] over o over a dead beast and say let my
[1:03:51] body be as this dead beast if I don't
[1:03:53] keep this covenant. And and
[1:03:58] and what we can look at what we can look
[1:04:00] at and and realize that the same the
[1:04:02] same power that that that that that that
[1:04:05] Jesus Christ had has has he he he stood
[1:04:08] over it and he was he was he was he was
[1:04:11] he was torn into at at
[1:04:14] at Calvary. And this covenant, this
[1:04:17] covenant that that God has has given the
[1:04:21] the that God has given that has given
[1:04:24] the the the the church is the baptism is
[1:04:27] the baptism of of of of of the of the of
[1:04:32] the of of the Holy Ghost. And we we we
[1:04:35] we we can sit there a and and and and
[1:04:38] take the the
[1:04:40] um covenant that that Jesus Christ said
[1:04:44] and we can sit there and take the
[1:04:45] scriptures and it says Jesus Christ is
[1:04:47] the same yesterday, yesterday,
[1:04:49] yesterday, today and a and and and
[1:04:54] and forever. We we we we we can sit
[1:04:57] there and take the take the covenant
[1:04:58] that says by my stripes by my stripes ye
[1:05:03] ye are are healed. We can set them take
[1:05:05] the covenant and and say whatsoever
[1:05:07] things that that that ye have ha have
[1:05:10] need of need of and they can set that
[1:05:13] covenant and they can they can match it
[1:05:15] match it just together exactly and it
[1:05:17] matches it matches terror for tear
[1:05:19] because because God has given us a
[1:05:21] covenant and so we can we we so we we we
[1:05:24] we can we can we we we can take that
[1:05:26] covenant and and and we can stand there
[1:05:29] and and and be rest assured that God
[1:05:31] that God will will fulfill it because
[1:05:33] God is the same. Amen.
[1:05:37] So, so, so and and we notice now we
[1:05:40] can't just we can't just take a um um a
[1:05:42] a a um piece of paper and and and and
[1:05:46] and try to match it up just exactly.
[1:05:49] You'll never do it. You have to take the
[1:05:50] same the same the the same thing that
[1:05:53] that that that that
[1:05:58] that when it was torn too. You have to
[1:06:01] have you have to have the other half or
[1:06:03] else or else or else it's it's it's it's
[1:06:06] never going to match. You can sit there
[1:06:09] you can sit there and say and and and
[1:06:11] and
[1:06:13] and try your best to work it up and and
[1:06:16] and try it through works or or or or
[1:06:19] or you try and try and dance up and down
[1:06:22] and and holler and scream and shout, but
[1:06:23] until that covenant matches up just
[1:06:25] exactly right. Right. And he and and and
[1:06:30] you you you can take that word and stand
[1:06:33] firm and stand firm on God's promises be
[1:06:36] because because why? We have the other
[1:06:37] half half of of of the covenant.
[1:06:43] Brother Brandham says says has said that
[1:06:45] the bride is the covenant people
[1:06:48] unconditionally God called you out. God
[1:06:50] called you out out of the world and gave
[1:06:53] you the Holy Ghost, the seed of Abraham.
[1:06:56] you are are tonight with a with a
[1:06:58] blessed with a blessed with a blessed
[1:07:00] promise. Amen. He said, "My" He said,
[1:07:02] "Then if if
[1:07:03] if your Abraham's seed, you have you
[1:07:06] have this this this this promise in you.
[1:07:08] You believe God regardless of what takes
[1:07:10] place. The Holy Ghost makes you believe
[1:07:12] it. Makes makes you believe it. Believe
[1:07:15] it. Believe it."
[1:07:17] Anyhow, he said he he he said he he he
[1:07:20] he he said he said he said, "What are we
[1:07:22] scared about?" He he he's he all devils
[1:07:25] in hell couldn't shake you. Nothing at
[1:07:27] all at all at all at all at all can
[1:07:30] shake you. We receive a kingdom that
[1:07:32] cannot be moved. Oh my. Settle yourself
[1:07:34] on these thoughts one time and think of
[1:07:36] what God of what God has said. Not not
[1:07:39] your not your not your circumstances,
[1:07:43] not your nothing else, but what God has
[1:07:46] said has said. And in Galatians in
[1:07:48] Galatians chapter 3 29 says it says if
[1:07:51] ye be Christ then are ye are ye are ye
[1:07:56] Abraham's seed and hes according
[1:07:58] according according to to to
[1:08:02] to the promise. See so so if we are
[1:08:06] Christ then we are Abraham's
[1:08:09] seed and and if we're heirs we're heirs.
[1:08:13] We don't have we don't have to s sit
[1:08:14] there and and and and wander around and
[1:08:16] and and wondering if we're worthy or if
[1:08:18] we're not or for this or for that. No,
[1:08:20] sir. We can stand on the promise of God
[1:08:22] and realize we are hes we are heirs of
[1:08:25] Christ according according to what the
[1:08:26] promise
[1:08:27] according according according according
[1:08:30] to to that covenant that that God has
[1:08:32] has has has made for us. when when when
[1:08:36] when
[1:08:38] when David had had had had had met
[1:08:41] Goliath, he he he had already seen what
[1:08:45] God had done what God had done done done
[1:08:49] to to the lion to the lion and and what
[1:08:52] God had done had what had done had done
[1:08:55] to the bear and and and and
[1:08:58] and he knew and and and he knew that
[1:09:02] that that that
[1:09:04] that even know that that even though
[1:09:07] within himself he had he had he had he
[1:09:09] had he had no
[1:09:13] no abilities even though within himself
[1:09:16] self he was just he was he was an
[1:09:17] insignificant nobody
[1:09:20] but but but but but but yet he could
[1:09:24] stand firmly on the word of God and say
[1:09:26] who is this uncircumcised
[1:09:29] uncircumcised sized sized sized
[1:09:33] Philistine and he could he could sit
[1:09:34] there and see what God had done, what
[1:09:36] God had when God had had had had slain
[1:09:39] that lion.
[1:09:40] A andy and he slew the barrier and he
[1:09:43] knew that he could stand there in full
[1:09:45] confidence and in full assurance knowing
[1:09:47] that that that God had had had had his
[1:09:51] back. Why? Why? He see he said, "I am
[1:09:54] the seed of Abraham and I am an heir and
[1:09:57] an heir to the to to to the promise." In
[1:10:01] Galatians 4:6 it says, it says, "And
[1:10:03] because ye are sons, God hath sent forth
[1:10:06] the spirit of his son into your hearts,
[1:10:08] crying, ab crying, a a abba abba
[1:10:15] father." And and and wherefore thou art
[1:10:18] no more a servant, but a son, and if a
[1:10:20] son, than an heir of God, through an
[1:10:23] heir of God through Christ. How be it
[1:10:26] then, when when when ye knew not God, ye
[1:10:28] did service unto them, which by nature
[1:10:31] are are are which by nature are no know
[1:10:35] God's no gods. But now after that ye
[1:10:37] have known God, or rather are known of
[1:10:39] God, how turn ye again
[1:10:43] again to the weak and the beggarly and
[1:10:45] the beggarly and the beggarly and the
[1:10:47] beggarly elements elements where unto ye
[1:10:50] desire again uh where unto ye desire
[1:10:53] again to be in and bondage. Brother
[1:10:57] Brandham says say says it says says it
[1:10:59] says says say says say says what are you
[1:11:02] what are you scared scared about? He
[1:11:05] said, he said, "Are you afraid to take
[1:11:06] his his word, his word, his word, his
[1:11:09] word for anything?" He said, "Don't
[1:11:12] don't
[1:11:14] don't be afraid." He He He said he said
[1:11:16] he's called the thing, right? I am an
[1:11:18] heir. I am an error. I am an
[1:11:20] heir to this. He said he, "Oh, I I know
[1:11:24] I I know I know I don't deserve it, but
[1:11:27] I'm an air because and because and
[1:11:29] because and because and because and
[1:11:32] because I'm an air, I receive it." Amen.
[1:11:34] That's
[1:11:36] it. There you are. Be because because
[1:11:40] I'm an heir. That's it. We are we are an
[1:11:42] heir of of of salvation. Heir of the
[1:11:45] Holy Spirit. I'm an heir because Jesus
[1:11:47] has paid the price. Nothing I had I had
[1:11:50] nothing that I I had to do. I just felt
[1:11:53] he
[1:11:54] air. I felt heir to it. Amen. I am
[1:11:57] healed because I'm an heir to it. My
[1:11:59] diseases are gone. My afflictions are
[1:12:01] gone. Why? Because I'm an heir to it.
[1:12:03] All perfect assurance. Jesus is mine.
[1:12:05] Oh, what a foretaste of of glory divine.
[1:12:08] He he he he said he's old. Then Satan
[1:12:11] can't stand that because because he's a
[1:12:13] he's he's a defeated being. He's
[1:12:15] nothing. He is nothing nothing but a
[1:12:18] bluff. And Jesus has paid the price.
[1:12:20] Call us by grace. We're an heir. What a
[1:12:22] perfect setup. Setup. Setup that is.
[1:12:26] See, he said he's already all he's
[1:12:29] already defeated. I ne I never I never
[1:12:32] defeated him. Christ
[1:12:36] Christ defeated him. I'm just claiming
[1:12:38] my God-given given given privileges
[1:12:42] privileges. That's all that is all you
[1:12:45] do. You just tell tell you just tell
[1:12:48] Satan get get away from here. I've got
[1:12:51] an abstract deed on on this building.
[1:12:53] It's mine. I entered it. And so so so
[1:12:56] now we now we notice that God had raised
[1:12:57] up a man. Amen. Amen. A man. A man by by
[1:13:02] the name of of of Moses. And and
[1:13:07] and now we know that Moses that Moses
[1:13:10] was born in into this world for a for a
[1:13:13] a a specific purpose. And and and and
[1:13:17] that was that was that was to to deliver
[1:13:20] to deliver Israel Israel Israel out out
[1:13:24] of bondage. So, so, so, so, so, so, so,
[1:13:28] so, so so so and andy brought them out
[1:13:32] not, not not um um on his own, not on
[1:13:37] his on his on his own merits. And a and
[1:13:39] and now we notice that Moses had never
[1:13:41] performed one miracle.
[1:13:44] It It was the angel of God that that
[1:13:46] that that that had had had had gone
[1:13:51] before gone
[1:13:53] before Moses. It was a pillar of fire
[1:13:56] night and a cloud and and and and and a
[1:13:59] and a a cloud by by by by day. And and
[1:14:03] and and we and we can notice now and now
[1:14:06] now tonight that it's that same pillar
[1:14:07] of fire. It's that same cloud that that
[1:14:10] that
[1:14:11] that was leading that was that was that
[1:14:14] was leading Moses and and the children
[1:14:17] of Israel is the same cloud. And that
[1:14:19] same pillar of fire and the same pillar
[1:14:20] of fire that that is is is is leading
[1:14:23] us. We we we we we we we can sit there a
[1:14:28] and stand here in all confidence and all
[1:14:30] assurance knowing that that that that
[1:14:32] that that that we are serving a a a a
[1:14:35] vindicated God. We are following a
[1:14:37] vindicated a vindicated a
[1:14:40] vindicated message. The only vindication
[1:14:42] that Moses had was
[1:14:44] was well well not not the not the only
[1:14:49] all all all not the only only
[1:14:52] vindication but but but one one of Moses
[1:14:55] Moses's vindications was was he had a
[1:14:57] pillar of fire fire of fire of fire that
[1:15:00] that that
[1:15:01] that was leading
[1:15:03] him and and he had a pillar of cloud of
[1:15:07] of cloud of cloud of cloud that that
[1:15:10] that that that was with him.
[1:15:13] and and when when when we today as a
[1:15:15] bride of Christ can stand here and and
