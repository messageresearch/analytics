the gift amen and watch just God come and speak to you and uh he can just uh speak through brother Matt I've seen it happen so many times I I know that there's a really a big move going on to quieten the ministry down and just press play and Obey but I think if you're going to really obey you got to come to church and the church ain't your house playing internet or pushing play the church is the house of God and uh brother Brandon was very adamant about coming to the house of God meeting with Believers and he was a very big supporter of a five-fold Ministry God still uses the fivefold ministry today to speak to us and I'm so glad for that amen so uh I want to just maybe uh let let's just sing that song I know maybe we sing it often but here's my cup Lord I lift it up to you and um

hold on if God's here it's a special meeting I know we have special meetings but God's here so I don't know about you I'm expecting a special meeting with God Amen because when he shows up Oh Glory all things are possible amen I do want to greet you from our pastor Brother David Hunter M Indiana happy to have my wife and my littlest Li Ella and Lily with us my son is uh he's uh got maybe a little girlfriend that he he spent a little time with he went up to Pennsylvania this weekend so but I greet you from our pastor and we sure just love you and I want to say just take a minute just to thank you for the efforts that you put into ATT tent meeting I have been a benefit of it Lord and it doesn't go unseen what you do I know sometimes you labor and you're tired and you want to be in service and you don't get the opportunity to go I know what it's like I I work at camps but God sees everything that you do and it's sometimes the Unseen thing how many's ever seen your kidneys how many's ever seen your liver it's the Unseen things that make a body go and without them the body doesn't work the way it's supposed to but it's a prime example of how the body of Jesus Christ a small group can come together and put on a meeting that blesses exponentially it's a Unison and I I just I applaud you I say thank you keep doing it if the Lord carries amen but but just from the bottom of my heart we thank you Lord and I I know sometimes that me saying thank you I know that means something to you but he says thank you too so just B my heart and you know as we before we open the word you know brother an would tell us he said you never come to the house of God and leave the same you're going to you leave Better or Worse the Bible says if you touch any one thing agreeing let's agree this morning I'm going to leave better than what I came in let's agree brother man would also teach us he comes where he's invited so as we stand before we open the word let's just invite him to come and I'm just expecting great things today amen amen if you have a need upon your heart you just hold it before the Lord and just kind of a blessing and honor to be here and let's just invite him to take completely Liberty in the service you hold your need before the Lord and you know I don't know you or maybe I do know you but I don't know your need he does and his brother Shawn said God can speak through me I'm going to yield his everything I give my gift back to him and let's just have church this morning let's just let all pretenses let tomorrow go don't think about what happened don't don't think about that let's just enter into an atmosphere that's pleasing to God and let's have Church Father we just come before you just counted a blessing and honor to be here Lord what an atmosphere that's set this morning Lord and we've come to the table Lord and we've come hungry father we've come in great expectation father knowing that many generations back lord you had this meeting in your thoughts father God we've come together just to just to to sit at your table and feast father Lord you know the needs of your people father God you know the word that they have need of Father Lord I don't even know father but you know father God I pray that you'd come right just personal to them Lord and speak to their needs God as We've Come Together God may you bless each one God we give you the pre in the service father we just ask you Lord to move me out of the way God and speak your word God and may we just have a wonderful time in you this morning God may you deliver father may you heal father may you fill with the Holy Ghost father may you refill with the Holy Ghost God may you bring Deliverance father may you break the change father may you break the bondage father may you break down walls father we will move into higher Heights and deeper deaths with you God we love you this morning Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen if you have your Bibles with you this morning let's turn to Colossians chapter 1 just Colossians chapter 1 and you know I I think I've changed my thought 14 times you know it's just one of those things but you know I'm like Lord I'm going this way so if we go I I got about three or four messages here but they're probably going to all come out at once so that's just how God works when you go out like that and you don't know God has all these things that come to your mind but we're just going to let him have the message this morning it's his message so amen Colossians chapter 1 and we'll start reading in verse 12 he says giving thanks unto the father who hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who Deliver Us From The Power of darkness and hath translated us into his kingdom of his dear son and whom we have Redemption through the blood even the Forgiveness of sins who's the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that in Earth visible and invisible whether it be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him he is before all things and by him all things consists he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning of the first one from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all the fullness dwell and having be made peace through the blood of his Christ by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether be things in Earth or things in heaven how many loves this scripture and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your own Bible Wicked Works yet now hacky reconciled in the body of his flesh for the death I love this to present you holy unblamable unreprovable in his sight if you continue the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is heaven under Earth where for I Paul and made a minister amen you may have your seats may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of the word so you just paull and I'll just preach amen and we'll have church together amen I you know I just want to take my thought if I might by the help of the Lord and you just you just pull on the gift and we'll just we'll let God have his perfect will this morning into our place coming up higher coming up higher amen how many believe we each one have a place and I believe nobody else can take your place amen nobody else can do the job that you can do you say brother Matt but I'm not a preacher no but just as I told you just a minute ago every piece of the body is just as important as the other piece of the body amen you said brother mat I'm just a fingernail well you smash that fingernail one time you'll know how important that piece of the fingernail is why because there it is laying in the middle of the night and it's going boom bo what is it telling you I need help and what's the other part of the body do the other part of the body reaches over and begins to coddle that you know it's okay if you pray for your brother and sister it's okay if you see them hurting it's okay listen that's what the body is supposed to do not go talk about them not go beat them down the body is supposed to get behind them and comfort them the body is supposed to help one another listen this body our place is not to beat one another down come on somebody our place is to talk about them our place is to lift them up into Heavenly places he say brother Matt but they've been there for years yeah but your prayer can move mountains in your brother's life your prayer can change things in your brother life it's time saints of God this body get in a Unison because that is what God wants he don't want preachers fighting against come on somebody he's not pleased with preachers fighting against preachers yes we should stand for this message there's no backing down from this mess if God stood with it then I'm going to be standing with it come on somebody that's the place of a True Believer if God sent a Vindicated word and he stood with it that I'm going to stand in my place right there with it but it's time for the body to come in unity you said brother M but they're always weak well let me ask you are you praying for them well preach brother I know I step on list on evangelist I don't really care that's just how we're built amen we do care we're not trying to hurt somebody but if it's God telling you you need to be praying for that person and God has brought them to your mind three times that week and you've just sit there and thought about how ugly they are and how bad not ugly we preach how bad they are and how they're never going to get anywhere listen that was you one time you were in that place and you were in that condition but there was somebody that got down on their knees and began to pray for you there was somebody that went to a cross Oh Glory there was somebody that took your place well why don't you be the intercession for them why don't you go before the Lord I believe we got some snipers in the church come on it's an army how many what does a sniper do they're never seen they don't get any Glory but from miles away they can begin to pick enemies off you want to tell me the power of prayer brother Matt I'm telling you the power of prayer you get on your knees and begin to pray one for another you want to see a body come in unison come on somebody you want to see have church how many wants to have church well why don't you spend some time on your knees praying for your faster than well Glory that was a hook wasn't it set that one pretty good come on somebody you get in just a habit and we come to church and we come to church oh well we're just going to go here brother sea well praise the Lord if God is sent brother sha here then why don't you get behind him and why don't you get to I'm he didn't pay me for this why don't you get behind him and get to praying for him cuz Lord he's in his position he's studying then let me get in my place and not just sit here and and hold up Pew but let me get in my place place that we can have church when we get together brother Sean might not feel like it but I tell you what my prayers are interceded we going to have church whether he wants to or not I don't care how brother sea feels I believe it's the gift God set in this area and we're going to have church cuz I'm ready for church that's the expectation of the believer come on our expectations are right here and I know with our government we understand but that should not come through the doors of the church that should not come to the doors of your spiritual life come on somebody you don't have to live with a devil fighting you all the time you don't have live with a devil taking your ground come on somebody well preach brother M I believe I will how many loves him this morning amen verse 30 who delivered us from the power of the darkness there was a power of the darkness that held Us in place there was a power listen if you're under that power this morning you don't have to listen we've already agreed together we've already agreed I'm leaving better than what I came in if there was a power that's holding over your life today this morning you don't have to leave the same way you can because I'm here to tell you there's a power a transforming power that can change your life in a moment in a twinkling that your thoughts will not be the same that your actions will not be the same it's the power of the Holy Ghost it's the power of the word of God and God's word in its place will have its effect it's the power of Darkness now listen catch this here he says and ha translated the word translated to transpose to transfer to remove from one place to another all right I believe we have a testimony service just right here how would say Lord I don't understand at all but father I know I used to be here but Lord I'm not there any long Oh Glory then why don't we just say Lord Jesus in this place in this hour I'm not going to sit down on you I'm going to give you praise for where you brought me I'm going to get praise for what you're doing for me and I'm going to give you praise for where I'm going cuz I'm going in a Rapture listen it's time for the bride to go higher than she's ever gone the message has come the Holy Ghost is here the word is open it's time for you to feed and when you feed on the word of God you won't stay in that place you're going forward Glory this is a church in action it's not a church laying down on God God is looking for a church in action brother man said he said if you're life doesn't write another book of Acts take warning now right here in this place you can do one or two things with that brother Matt that's the way that's the way I've always been uh-huh but there's a power to transform you this morning that that type of thinking doesn't have to be what you have when you leave here that's a slave mentality come on somebody the children of Israel had slave mentalities cuz that's all they ever knew but when God set them free they still had the same mentality even though they were free and free indeed but listen this morning you're free and he set you free he set you free to dance he set you free to praise him he set you free to win every Victory he set you free this morning you ain't got to sit there and say Lord I don't know if I can you accept God's word you set me free that I'm going on in Liberty well preach brother man I believe we will I ain't no kind of preacher but I sure love the Lord don't you this is our place saints of God our places to be Earthbound come on in our mind we should not be Earthbound thinking if all you can think about is the next paycheck and how you going to pay your bills I ask you where's your prayer closet well preach brother come on somebody I know what it's like I got a family I got three kids I got a house I got all this I understand but that is not what God has called me to he has called me to a high calling he's called me to think on these things he's called me to stay out of the things of the world H Glory well preach he's translated this I believe we have a testimony how many just with the raise a hand say Lord I'm not who I was last year who did that it wasn't you there was a power to translate you from one place to another and let me tell you that same power that did the Translating there is the same power that's going to Quicken us in one morning between 6 and N there's a power that's going to translate you I believe it's even calling his bride higher right now listen there's a call within my life I don't even understand what it is but Lord I've got to go higher than I've ever gone before and if that means I need to die because the way to go higher is to die you must go down before you can go up I know it's a paradox but SS of God what about it this morning I challenge you go and humble yourself more than you've ever humbled yourself don't accept anything less than the word of God being made manifest in your life you don't have to you don't have to accept less for come on somebody well Glory listen now he's translated this how many knows his power is here this morning my brother man I didn't expect this kind of service sorry we here there's a power in the building and he went to the cross of Calvary so he can unleash this power so that you can be free of every doubt you can be free from your past come on some of you been message Believers walking in this message and there's still things in the past that hang over your life well I'm here to tell you this morning you don't have to stay in that position there's a blood that cleanses there's a blood that wipes free there's a voice that speaks over your life and says I set you free why would you go back to thinking that way come on somebody why do you have to think that way quit thinking that way that's not why I died that's not why I gave the Holy Ghost I gave for you to have a pure mind listen we got to overcome the devil listen the devil's real come on somebody the devil's not something fake in fact he's right there he's sitting he's a front row believer he believes but he can't live the life oh that's the difference he knows more than you do I know we think we know more because we've been that devil knows more than you do but the devil just doesn't know his place yet you got to let him know yourself in fact I don't want to clean it off let me get it good and dirty so you know where your place is still brother B said this is another message but we're going to preach here brother said overcoming was recognizing the devil and every one of his tricks I'm going to give you an example in my life cuz I'm just an open book just the way we go there was a time in my life for like two and a half three years I felt like i' done something wrong still preaching still going to church but this feeling of just condemnation you know brother bam had the same thing he preached the seals under that go back to 1965 or 64 when he went and took a walk with the Lord dares he said he felt like he'd done something wrong he said for 2 or 3 years I'd felt that way he preached the seals feeling that way so don't let the feelings determine your position and place in Jesus Christ but anyway I'm sitting here and I'm trying to study for a message and this is over me and just nobody ever been there come on somebody felt like you done something wrong you search your life you look Lord I'll make it right Lord I'm like Lord I can't even study feel like Lord I just can't get into the channel I get all right make fun of me that's all right about that time a brother texted me brother Brian Crow he said buddy you need to listen to this brother Samuel bounty's message I'm not getting anywhere okay so I started listening to brother Samuel brother Samuel about 15 minutes in or five minutes in he gives a quote from brother Brandon and it's a quote there anything too hard for the Lord and he says Sarah and Abraham we're having a little tiff I said he said that what so I turned off brother Samuel and I went to the message and right underneath where he said that he said the devil was trying to hold them and tempt them to make them feel that they've done something wrong and I'll tell you what when I recognized it was nothing but a devil trying to hold over my life and trying to keep me back I tabed myself a a good old crying fit right there in my chair and then I got mad cuz I Satan you no good nothing good for nothing I'm going to kick you on it made a preacher mad because I thought Lord if he's doing that to me he's doing that to every member of the body of Jesus Christ cuz if he could just hold you back a little bit from confessing the word with your mouth oh SS of God there's so much power in confessing the word from your mouth that I'm Healed I'm sealed I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I am a son of of God I am a daughter of God I've been born again I am a holy ghost filed baptized believing Christian I believe this message with everything I got there ain't a devil to hell going to stop this little Bride come on saints of God it's time we go into our place and to get in our place we got to put the devil in his place he has no authority over you this word has authority over you come on somebody if I could physically beat him I would why because I understand what it is recognize it's nothing but a lying Spirit straight out of the pits of hell and you don't have to listen to it you might hear it but address it a lot of times we hear it and here's what we do I can't raise my hand I can't I don't want to I can't say Amen like that brother because that's a devil trying to hide you back if the ministry of Christ was to set the captives free it's the same Ministry this morning it's the same Ministry of Christ and a lot of times it's just a slave mentality and you've got to come through listen I can't fight that battle for you but I'm here to tell you he's here and there's transforming power within the building that will bring you to another level higher in Jesus Christ than you even thought you could go listen let's don't put a limit to what God can do this morning come on somebody let's don't put a limit to what God can do he can heal the brokenhearted he can change the path come on somebody he's a God that can do all things and he does all things well and he's in the bill willing to transform you even farther than you thought thank well glory Lord have mercy thank you thanks for coming to church thanks for pulling this wouldn't be this service without you don't you give no praise to The Man Behind here yes he know he gives his gift and he studies and he prays and he ask God for leadership but you have just as much part sitting in the congregation listen I've sit to him during during Co I preach to an empty building it's hard I know how radio preacher can do it amen there's still a poll going on I'm not saying that but listen your place is not to sit at home and the stream it has its place but that's not the place our place is in the house of God because nobody can give praise like you can give praise listen I'm going tell you right now there ain't no Rock going to sit in brother Matt's place I'll be accused of being too loud and too rious then I will being quiet and not giving praise to God when he gives praise you know when you give praise when the preacher begins to preach and the word of God comes and it speaks to you directly don't you give no praise to the man of God you praise God because who is it that's speaking to you this guy doesn't know anything but there's a man that's in the building and he knows all things and he's here to transform you into the power that he wants you to be glory verse 14 how many loves the word it's our bread it's our life listen don't let your Bible grow stale brother Mt I'm there well you don't have to stay there that's right don't let the message grow stale oh brother Matt that's oh by the way we're human praise the Lord but the way to make the message not stay still is stay on your knees and when you go Lord you said there was something in this message that I need more of Lord I I don't even know how you get it but Lord I'm going to read I'm going to pray over it and I'm going to seek you with every come on it's time we seek him more than we've ever seek him before how many filled with the Holy Ghost well praise the Lord how many still wants more oh who put that desire there how many's getting more how many believes listen I play football so I'm going toan I talked about this last night I played football I was good I'm not trying to boast I was that's good what I did a left-handed quarterback I started my sophomore junior senior year broke every record except for two in high school went to University of Illinois they were recruiting me to go there Big 10 school but I realized even in that I never really gave my all I relied on let me ask you and this is challenging I know cuz this is where I am I appreci Lord I want it such the desire in my heart I'm going to get it whether it's just the desires for a Rapture I'm going I can't explain and I know I'm talking to Believers right now I'm talking to the bride you've got the same thing I've got cuz it doesn't just work on one person of the body but the body works together come on somebody and there's a desire down deep in your heart Lord I want to go higher than I've ever gone well let's time we quit doing the same thing and expecting the same results yeah we' set message PE with that same desire but it's picking up a't it I'm not talking about just looking at the world the world's where it is it's crazy gone we should reach for them don't get any higher in your place there one by Grace you would be there too but I'm talking there's such a strong brother M you're crazy leave me alone I'm crazy but pray for me I want more of this message I want more not just the Revelation not just the understanding I want to look in the mirror and see the reflection not of Matthew mlar anymore but the Lord Jesus Christ his thoughts his actions his words his come on somebody brother said the bride would have his word and know what to do with it well then it's time for a deeper sincerity to come into our place if we're going to go higher the only way to go higher is not just read more pray more it's to humble yourself in the sight of almighty God and say father I don't know how to get there but you've gave me this desire and so father I'm going to be here I'm going to be knocking Lord is that unjust judge I'm knocking at your door father I'm knocking at your I'm not going to be ashamed amen I'm going to be there I'm preaching with my whole heart this is all me right here but it's not just for me it's for the Bride of Jesus Christ quit making excuses quit let somebody else take your position it's your place to be there it's your place to get down before the Lord It's your place to seek God like you've never sought God before yes we have the opening of the word but are you feeding on it like you've never fed on it before you need to you're not feeding on the words of a man you're feeding on the son of man the unfailing body word of the son of man and brother Brandon would tell us he said have you fed fully if you've not fed fully will you do it now catch the next sentence so that you can Fly Above denominations and the things of the world what anointing are you under what anointing are you under what anoint we're not under just a ox you realize every one of those did not have an action denoted to it but the eagle did it was a flying eagle why because our place is not feeding on the things of the world our place is in the heavenlies and listen is to go higher and higher let me read you this quote where are you catching this from Brother B say this says I received this as an as an eagle Serv N I received the Holy Ghost that settles it I caught you by the horn sorry it didn't with me I didn't mean to Budd I hate that I shouldn't have paused it didn't with me I'm just still taking it moving higher and higher I'm just moving on way high high Ambitions high expectations now I'm not in here to tell you every one of you is a Prophet come on no you each one got a place but let me ask you have you come to the full potential in your place I know we get a lot of amens there why because God's Wan his bride to grow God's wanting his bride in full maturity do you realize what is even happening right now under the spoken word there's a light that's being shined on you it's a supernatural light and the Soul that's on the inside of you is coming to full maturity that is our place SS of God we're not to be Dilly down in the things of the world we're not to be have a child mind thinking come on we're not to have speak childish things come on the Bible Paul would talk about that but he said then I spoke as a man it's time for full maturity in The Bride of Jesus Christ though you go through every trial though you go through every heartache let your head be high and let your mouth be confessing the word of God expecting God to move Glory verse 14 in whom we have Redemption through his blood you know we can never take this place unless he took ours you could never be in this place this morning but I'll tell you he did let me read you quote here this is so good that's a long quote but hold on but oh I'd like to say something if I can forget what I was remembering what he is if I can't remember Jesus if I can remember him at the cross if I can remember what he done for me and I can remember the hour that he washed away my sins and give me the holy spirit to guide me then I'm lifted above everything that holds this Earth I'm lifted above every Earthly thing in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus where I can follow him there in his presence forgetting what I was and forgetting all my sins and everything sounds like a good place doesn't it go higher come on somebody get in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus where the things of the world don't really matter amen your past doesn't really matter why because we are future tense we are going to a place we are Eternal beings walking into eternity all my sins there because they're the Sea of God forgetting forgetting all my pasts forgetting everything and remembering that he made his home by his own death he took my place and that I had no right to go nowhere but to hell but he took my place Lifted Me From Hell he went there for me and he Lifted Me Up by his grace abundant now we are the sons and daughters of God and we sit in Heavenly places listen now now it's present tense listen we serve a present tense God and right now if the Bible says you are a son and daughter of God and your life reflects a born again experience then you can stand and speak the word as a son and daughter of God and if there's anything in your life that condemns you then I ask you why do you stay in that condemned state that is not your place you get on your face before God until all condemnation all doubt all fear is washed away and you've come into a place where all things become new and where his life is now living on the inside of you you've stepped into the sh kind of glory and in the Shak of Glory the Almond Tree went through the whole phase let's just stay in the Shak of Glory if he rent The Veil and said we could come in let's eat the Heavenly Mana let's stay in the light of the hour let's stay in the message of the hour let's stay in the pill of fire and watch God bring forth fruits in your life Glory man that's good I got to record that for myself that's good listen now he took your place but now you can take his you can come into righteousness how many say glory be to God glory to God man we could have oursel a shouting session right there but listen did didn't stop with him just taking our place he didn't stop the calvary he went to a death bar and Resurrection he didn't stay in a grave but on the day of Pentecost he broke himself up and that same Pillar of Fire is here this morning and he's calling to his bride come on up higher come to the heavenlies I've given you the word I've given you the Holy Ghost I took your place you have everything you have need of well if we have everything we have need of why are we still in the place that we are today come on I know why you asking that brother Matt I'm asking myself too brother Matt you filled with the Holy Ghost I am filled with the Holy

time his Georgie Carter I believe it was he was up on the side of a hill he said the mosquitoes were there he said I've been down my knees they were hurting and had thorns in my knees and finally I just decided Oh Glory why don't we just finally decide that I'm pressing through I'm getting into your presence father and I'm going to stay in your presence Lord and if I make a mistake father I know I got an advocate with the father so I'm right back into your presence again listen his blood is still good this morning his power is still the same this morning I say boo devil get off a God's people it's time we move saints of God it's time we go into the heavenlies more than we've ever gone it's time we come into this message when's the last time you pray listen it is brother Sean's job just to study it the Bible said in Revelations 10: 8 and9 you go get the book I can preach it brother man can preach it from the Housetop but God wants somebody that'll go get it for themselves brother Daniel

didn't open it and then close it it's still an open book but you've got to feed on it yourself that's your place of a Believer listen it make the message more to me than it ever made to me why because there's something in it that's going to make my life prophesy like it's never prophesied before there's something in it that makes my life say there she is there's my bride there's the one that's feeding on the open book there's the one that's coming to her position she recognized her prophet and her message but now she's taking her message and she's feeding on her message and it's transforming her life if you're not there I'm not here to beat you down I'm saying come on this is where God wants you the devil the devil wants you beat down he wants you afraid he wants you inability to think that this is yours and you can ever possess what God gave you can I remind you he's a liar so every time he breathes he lies how many likes a liar brother you take your car to the shop the guy says well it's going to be $25 you come back and it's $175 you like that guy no why what' he do he lied to you do you take your car back there uh-uh so why wouldn't we recognize that it's a devil that's lying to us all right brother M I'm I'm Devil's good at what he does now he'll influence you he'll make it feel he knows what it likes to feel like God's presence he knows kind of mimic that voice 99% right yeah healing is for everybody but yeah not really you've had too bad of a past and you know you you always just you can't get there stupid devil it's yours if he gave you a promise you can Bank on it if he gave you a promise come on somebody the Bank downtown might go out but the bank in heaven will he will meet every one of his promises I'm here to tell you he still fills with the Holy Ghost how many wants an acts 4 type of service this morning what happened in Acts four well read your Bible they had a rebaptism of the Holy Ghost they begin to talk about the goodness of God and what God was doing in their midst and all of a sudden the foundation begin to sh take again I tell you what saints of God I don't need to hear just about the mechanics I want to see the Dynamics I want to see the Bride In Action I want to come up higher I want to go into where God wants me to go it's not just for brother bam it's for the Bride of Jesus Christ to go and see this word open For Your Glory come on now he took your place but listen that blood must be in its place well Glory Moses brought a message and he told the people he said take the blood and put it on the lentil and across the top Oh Glory it was their responsibility Moses gave him the message right it was their responsibility to take the message and to do what the message said how did they do it brother Matt simple faith come on come on somebody you believe this message is sent from God you believe it's the word of God then we're not to just be hearers only we're to be doers and how do I do it brother Matt I simply say Lord that's your word I don't question it I don't doubt it I don't maybe understand it all but Lord that is your word you put your Pillar of Fire you put your cloud in the sky you Vindicated this word more than you've ever Vindicated any more message Father and you come I believe that word but but Lord I don't want to just read it on the page I want to see it living in me I want to see overcoming power then if my brother is struggling they shall lay hands on the sick I'll give you an example my grandmother 92 93 years old she ended up with legioner which legioner is a death sentence for an old woman sorry if you're 94 pray for me didn't mean to call you old but anyway it's a death sentence she's not a Believer I told my sister I said Carrie just lay hands on her I said don't even pray I said you the Bible didn't say you had to pray it say lay hands on them come on somebody I said in just simple obedience to the word of godall there's power in your touch come on somebody you don't know who you are if we can speak the word and go create a world and go live on it then there's something to do with the touch of a Believer s of God that scripture is for you I know you've put that on the minister and you put that on the prayer line but let me put it where brother Brandon put it there was a woman up in the in the balcony one time and she had a feeling for that girl and she had a feeling for that girl she let me take your seat and she couldn't get rid of that feeling listen if you have a feeling to pray for somebody then why don't you just pray for him I'm not trying to condemn her I understand I'm nobody God can you use your prayers the same as he can his come on somebody I know devil doesn't like that brother B said when somebody begins to pray for somebody something begins to happen direct quote if you want it I got it for you so there's an unseen force that begins to move where was I at praise the Lord amen you love him something begins to happen this word in Mark is for you it's time we take this message personal it's not just the church we come to but this is my message and when the message gets in its place and it's not just hearing it's and then when it gets on the inside of you it is going to do some incredible things how many's a witness of it how many wants more incredible get eaten then get eaten this message but M I don't understand it mm you realize who that is that's a devil because the Bible says it's given for you to know the Mysteries so the thought that say I struggle with this too I don't understand it very much and then you can build yourself a complex and say right behind that complex but you know what I'm not staying behind a complex of I don't understand I may not understood it before but I'm coming I'm not looking just to gete and I'm looking to get in his presence and when you get at the feet of Jesus and you're hungry you're listen m how many children do you let go I don't care if they don't stay in your house anymore they come to your house you're hungry you'll go to the grocery store won't you if you have to our heavenly father wants to feed his children how many being fed this morning Hallelujah you love him this morning let me get on Oh Glory brother man would say the token is what the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost cannot just we know about it but the Holy Ghost must be displayed this message must be displayed brother Matt I'm falling short don't stay there don't stay there you don't have to stay there if you've stayed there for 10 years I know I've never really got that high and I just don't think that's for me me I'm just a little nobody mhm blind baras sit there blind couldn't see but he got in the presence of God and they couldn't keep him quiet do you realize you may have never seen before you may never walk like you're going to walk after you walk after this service you made her live like you never Liv like you lived after come on somebody brother out you're trying to No I'm trying to say he's here and if he's here you recognize his presence when his presence is here it's finished it's finished amen if thou can't believe all things are possible this morning I can leave out of here better than I've ever left I'm nobody you guys don't even really know me but praise the Lord he's here that's what matters let me move on lost my place brother B the Bible would go on and say let me get to this I got 15 minutes I got close I'm not even halfway through I'm not two scriptures in thank you that's him that's your hunger amen what do you have need of this morning and I'm going to tell you this don't ask for a little thing oh Lord I don't want to tr he wants to be troubled that's a direct quote too I know brother your place is in a slave mentality you think you can't have the blessings of God well I'm here to tell you that's not right the truth is he wants to bless you more than you can handle brother man we talk about taking the whole ocean and putting in a 4- foot pipe right he said and the pressure underneath that if you block that up the pressure you know I I I'm not a big proponent of AI but I used AI what would them take the whole out of the earth put in a 4 foot five what would the pressure BEC coming I asked AI this because I didn't and it gave me like 14 pages of calculation did I understand any of it no at the end it gave a conclusion thank goodness there's a conclusion basically at every level it obliterates you there' probably be nothing left of you so how much does God want to bless you this morning I said Lord don't let there be anything left to me blow it all out Lord and let it be all you Lord Jesus that when I leave here Lord my footsteps are not just on the ground any longer but let it be like Enoch I'm going to walk with you hand in hand and then one day Lord that footsteps not going to hit ground any any longer it's going to take a step here and before long it's taking a step there and before long they're going to be where did he go I don't know I know I went to my place where he wanted me in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus back in the back in the back in the condition of Eden again can't preach for preaching 14 and then we have this verse uh let's go drop down to verse Verse 18 and he is the head of the body of the church for the beginning of the play firstborn unto all things he might have pren brother BR would talk about the three4 purpose of God and he would come down through there and he would say the second purpose is for what the second to have pre the first is to express himself completely in God in Christ and he did the world didn't see it but the elect that's him even when they couldn't understand it eat my flesh they didn't understand it but Lord where am I going to go and there might be times you don't understand this message but there's something within you I'm saying right here I'm not going anywhere I don't understand what's going on but the words of Life are right here in Christ the message of the hour second to have preeminence by this in his church which is the body so preeminence means this to hold the first place amen this takes extra exercise oh brother Matt he's he holds first place M how long has it been since you really got in your prayer closet when's the last time listen you know what you know what a love demands Fellowship don't talk to Ann for two days see how that goes couldn't do it could you why you love her that's right praise the Lord still tell her you love her don't you brother amen yes sir when's the last time you pulled up and said Lord I just come to tell you I love you it's not what I can get out of you Lord or what I need today I just come to express my love to you he deserves it he deserves the honor the Bible would also said he's the head of the body you know I was riding down the road I was tell show about this this is when the message really came open to me I grew up in message church but that doesn't mean it means you're in a good place to get born but there's more to it than just growing up in a messes Church hear me young kids hear me old people I don't care where you're at sometimes you need a birth of 90 you're in a good atmosphere this morning oh man I love him I'm ding down the road and just listen to the message brother BR said he said everything that happens on Earth happens in the heavens first the Lord quickened to me the cloud what was it it was the head where was the body he was coming to it the body was on Earth brother Ram himself didn't recognize it for what it was come on somebody a lot of these message people don't recognize it for what it was until the Holy Ghost says look at it right said look turn it to the right what do you see it's the head coming to the body what does the head do it does the thinking amen where's the speaking from it's from the head where's the vision from it's from the head it's all from the head this message is the headship of Christ coming down but it needs a body that will receive it as the headship and not as a thought of a man and not as idea and not put your thinking with it it is God's word to a body that will bring you into your place in ready for a Rapture that's like a bomb ain't it it did something to me I called I said honey honey honey honey I didn't want to go to work I have myself a fit in my car it's all right have fit in your car I've had some people look at me crazy in my car that's all right God's there with me they can look crazy B the hid I'll never forget his five my son was 5 years old sitting

to be something in there that's going to take me higher Lord and listen don't get in a hurry with the message if God stops you in paragraph three and leads you to the Bible and leads you to start searching that just do that that's not just for preachers I believe that is a gift and God helps you do that but that is for for God to commune with his people that's how he speaks to you how many times he spoke to you and you didn't say thank you Lord Glory the eagle Mama Eagle realizes there's potential musicians come on there's potential there's potential mom Eagle stands over top of them
