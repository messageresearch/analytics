[38:35] And um Amen. knowing that he will
[38:39] [music] hear our prayer and grant our
[38:42] request.
[38:43] Amen. And it's u good to be in the house
[38:46] of [music] the Lord once again and uh
[38:50] good to have said brother Tyler [music]
[38:53] with us. Amen. And we certainly
[38:56] appreciate him and his family. Praise
[38:59] the Lord. And um the uh [music]
[39:01] musicians can be dismissed. And so it's
[39:04] good to be back uh home. And um we
[39:08] [music] had a good time there in um
[39:12] Arkansas.
[39:14] And um trust um I heard y'all had a good
[39:19] service here uh Sunday and appreciate
[39:22] Daniel for um taking the service. Praise
[39:28] the Lord. And um on our way down, we
[39:32] kind of broke down there in Gayl or not
[39:36] Gayax but um
[39:39] um Withville and uh brother Matthew um
[39:44] Farmer, he saw us and so he stopped and
[39:47] we got to talk a little bit. So, but he
[39:50] asked me to greet you all. Amen. uh this
[39:53] evening. And so um brother Matthew said
[39:57] tell y'all hi. Praise the Lord. Uh if
[40:00] you have your Bibles, we're going to
[40:03] first of all go to the book of Genesis,
[40:05] the first chapter. And also just a
[40:08] reminder that um uh time goes back one
[40:13] hour
[40:14] um this uh weekend. And so, um, and also
[40:20] we'll be starting our Sunday service at
[40:23] 10:00
[40:25] this Sunday. So, just remember that it
[40:28] be at 10:00 instead of at 11. Give us a
[40:32] little extra time. Amen. For fellowship.
[40:36] Praise the Lord.
[40:38] And uh but here we look Genesis 1 and3
[40:44] but it says and God said
[40:48] let there be light
[40:50] and there was light. Amen.
[40:54] Then if you'll go to Isaiah chapter 55,
[41:00] a very familiar scripture to us.
[41:03] Isaiah 55. And uh we'll start at the
[41:09] 8th verse
[41:12] or at the ninth verse. It says, "For as
[41:15] the heavens are higher than the earth,
[41:18] so are my ways higher than your ways,
[41:21] and my thoughts your thoughts than your
[41:23] thoughts. For as the rain cometh down,
[41:26] and the snow from heaven, and
[41:28] returnneeth not thither, but waterth the
[41:31] earth, and maketh it bring forth and
[41:33] bud, that it may give seed to the swer,
[41:37] and bread to the eater. So shall my word
[41:40] be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It
[41:43] shall not return unto me void, but it
[41:46] shall accomplish that which I please,
[41:49] and it shall prosper in the thing
[41:51] whereto
[41:53] I sent it. Amen. One more scripture and
[41:56] that's in Matthew the 8th chapter
[42:00] uh Matthew
[42:05] chapter 8 and um
[42:12] [clears throat]
[42:16] fifth verse. And when Jesus was entered
[42:19] into compernum,
[42:21] there came unto him a centurion
[42:23] beseeching him and saying, Lord, my
[42:26] servant lith home at home sick of the
[42:29] Pauly grievously tormented.
[42:33] And Jesus saith unto him, I will come
[42:35] and heal him. The centurion answered and
[42:39] said,"Lord, I am not worthy that thou
[42:41] should us come under my roof, but speak
[42:44] the word only,
[42:46] and my servant shall be healed. For I am
[42:50] a man under authority, having soldiers
[42:53] unto me, and I say to this man, go," and
[42:55] he goeth. To another, "Come," and he
[42:57] cometh. And to my servant, do this. And
[43:01] he doeth it.
[43:04] And if you go down the 13th verse says,
[43:08] "And Jesus said unto the centurion, go
[43:10] thy way, and as thou hast believed, so
[43:13] be it done unto thee." And his servant
[43:16] was healed in the selfsame hour. Amen.
[43:22] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[43:24] prayer.
[43:25] Father,
[43:28] as we have gathered this evening, no
[43:30] doubt there are needs that are present.
[43:32] And
[43:34] Father, you're the only one that can
[43:37] meet the need,
[43:39] Father. And we're just asking that you
[43:43] would do so tonight.
[43:45] And Lord, I pray that you would take
[43:47] what simple words we would have, just a
[43:50] simple thought, and that you would just
[43:53] uh reveal it in a greater light, Lord,
[43:57] to us, Father. And when we leave this
[44:02] place, Lord, we know that we had been
[44:05] with you.
[44:06] May you work in a supernatural way this
[44:09] evening. anoint both speaker and hearer
[44:12] is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name.
[44:16] Amen. And amen.
[44:19] So you can have your seats this evening
[44:23] and if I were to
[44:26] take a title it would be the supreme
[44:29] authority of the word.
[44:32] And um
[44:34] as you know um thinking of words
[44:40] a word uh whether it is a a spoken word
[44:44] or whether it's a word that is written
[44:48] down on a piece of paper it it it has to
[44:52] come from someone. Uh words are not just
[44:56] self-existent or whatever. it uh they
[45:00] they derive from from someone. We know
[45:04] that words are vital to us uh because
[45:07] this is how we communicate. Uh it's it's
[45:12] one of the main sources of communication
[45:16] uh is is through words.
[45:19] And I think I've uh said it before, but
[45:22] uh there was a study that was done uh on
[45:26] how many words a person speaks. And they
[45:29] say the average person speaks up to
[45:33] 16,000 words a day.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; That's a lot of words, which they did
[45:38] say that women speak a little bit more
[45:41] than men. I I've uh you know, just
[45:45] thought I'd throw that in there. But uh
[45:48] the average words that are spoken per
[45:52] hour is 941.
[45:55] That's the average. Now I don't know who
[45:57] does these studies but they uh they do
[46:00] them and and so um but we find that
[46:04] words are important
[46:06] uh on an everyday basis. Um and uh uh
[46:13] words reveal what is in a person's
[46:16] heart.
[46:17] Uh this is how we express things. Um
[46:22] words uh uh you know will express
[46:26] complexes that a person may have. Uh
[46:30] express uh inferiorities.
[46:34] Um words are used to convey hate,
[46:41] malice, um uh pride. Um the words words
[46:47] will do that but also words are used to
[46:51] express love
[46:53] &gt;&gt; um kindness, humility and and these
[46:57] things. Uh they they can also be used to
[47:01] deceive
[47:02] uh uh others or they can be used to
[47:07] reveal the truth.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Uh words can be used to build up or to
[47:13] air down. Uh so uh words are important.
[47:18] Uh there's been many times that people's
[47:21] lives have been saved just because uh of
[47:25] the words because we use words to beg,
[47:29] to plead for mercy. Um we also use words
[47:35] to command and to express authority.
[47:40] If a person is plagued by fear and
[47:43] anxiety, well then uh the words he or
[47:47] she speak will express this uh uh they
[47:52] express the fear, they express anxiety,
[47:55] they express worry. Uh we we do these
[47:59] through through words that that we would
[48:01] speak.
[48:03] uh if a person is confident then he will
[48:06] uh express this confidence through the
[48:09] words that that he speaks.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; A person who possesses faith will speak
[48:15] words of faith.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; A person who speaks doubt will speak
[48:19] words of doubt. Um a person that's
[48:23] negative will just he will always his
[48:26] words will be negative. it it will uh
[48:30] and a person that's positive will speak
[48:33] uh words that are are positive. It's
[48:35] just that way.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, we find that Caleb
[48:40] uh uh was a man of faith
[48:44] &gt;&gt; and and his words expressed it. Uh for
[48:48] he he said, "Let us go up at once and
[48:52] possess the land.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; We are more than able to take it." and
[48:57] and his words was expressing
[49:01] uh what Moses the prophet had been
[49:03] telling them and and he had believed
[49:06] what the prophet said and and so when
[49:09] when the showdown came uh he was one
[49:13] that would express his faith in in words
[49:17] we're more than able you you don't find
[49:19] a person with faith uh saying well I
[49:22] don't think we can do this and I don't
[49:24] think God will heal and I just don't
[49:26] think but but we do find that uh the 10
[49:30] spies uh being unbelievers
[49:33] well then they expressed it through
[49:36] through through through words and they
[49:38] they said we we be not able to go up
[49:41] against the people for they are stronger
[49:43] than we
[49:45] &gt;&gt; if you take numbers 13:32 and it tells
[49:49] us that these 10 spies brought an evil
[49:51] report by their words.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we can by our words have
[49:57] bring forth a good report. By our words
[49:59] we can bring forth an evil report. And
[50:03] they said the the land through which we
[50:05] have gone to search it is a land that
[50:08] eateth up the inhabitants thereof. And
[50:11] all the people that we saw in it are men
[50:14] of great stature. And there we saw the
[50:18] giants, the sons of Anch. And uh which
[50:21] come of the giants. And we were in our
[50:23] own sight as grasshoppers and so we were
[50:27] in their sight. Ain't that right? So, so
[50:30] their words as they expressed uh their
[50:33] unbelief and their doubt. Amen. And then
[50:37] the the effect that these words had upon
[50:41] the rest of the the the people, the 2
[50:44] and 1/2 million people. Amen. uh uh
[50:47] numbers 14 and1 it says and all the
[50:50] congregation lifted up their voice and
[50:53] cried and the people wept that night and
[50:57] and all the children of Israel murmured
[51:00] against Moses. So notice this this the
[51:04] words that these 10 spies had brought
[51:06] words of unbelief now started uh to
[51:10] affect the it affected the the two and a
[51:13] half million and then they began to
[51:15] speak words of murmuring against the
[51:18] prophet and and and so they murmured
[51:21] against Moses and against Aaron and the
[51:24] whole congregation said unto them would
[51:27] God that we had died in the land of
[51:30] Egypt or What God we had died in this
[51:33] wilderness. Now think of that. That's
[51:35] the words that they were saying. And and
[51:38] wherefore hath God brought us unto this
[51:40] land to fall by the sword that our wives
[51:43] and our children should be a prey. He
[51:46] says uh they say were it not better for
[51:48] us to return into Egypt. And and they
[51:51] said one to another, let us make a
[51:53] captain and let us return into Egypt.
[51:57] So, so that tells us that when words are
[52:00] spoken in in a negative way, there's
[52:03] something down inside of the heart that
[52:07] that is causing these words to come.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you'll never get Caleb to talk
[52:13] in a negative way, not toward the
[52:15] message, not toward the prophet, not not
[52:17] toward the promises that God had had
[52:20] given because he was a man of faith. And
[52:22] and he would express these in in words.
[52:26] Now, I find that that spirits um uh they
[52:30] they work through words. They they uh um
[52:35] uh work through words that are spoken or
[52:38] and even work through words that are
[52:40] written down and and and also they
[52:44] anoint people to speak words. Amen. Just
[52:47] like Satan, he he he in the beginning he
[52:51] moved uh uh was able to get in and work
[52:55] through that serpent. Amen. To Eve, God
[52:58] had said spoke his word, his law, and
[53:02] Satan was able to work through that
[53:03] serpent and began to speak. again. But
[53:06] he spoke words of deception
[53:09] to where it would cause Eve to to be
[53:13] deceived and and to to break God's laws.
[53:17] We also find in First Kings um 22 and 20
[53:23] uh uh it it tells us that God sent a
[53:25] lying spirit, a man, to deceive Ahab.
[53:29] And and notice now, and the Lord said,
[53:32] who shall persuade Ahab that he may go
[53:35] up and fall at Ramothth Gilead? And one
[53:39] said, on this matter, and another said
[53:41] on that matter, and there came forth a
[53:43] spirit, and stood before the Lord, and
[53:45] said, I will persuade him. And the Lord
[53:48] said, well, how are you going to do
[53:49] that? In other words, wherewith and he
[53:52] said, I will go forth and I will be a
[53:54] lying spirit in the mouth of all of his
[53:57] prophets. and and he said, "Thou shalt
[54:00] persuade him, and prevail also. Go forth
[54:03] and do so." Now, therefore, the behold,
[54:07] the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the
[54:10] mouth of all these thy prophets, uh uh
[54:13] Micaiah speak unto uh Ahab, and the Lord
[54:17] has spoken evil concerning thee. Ain't
[54:21] that right? See, so so words can be
[54:24] anointed uh of of uh people can be
[54:27] anointed of the devil of Satan just to
[54:30] speak words and and and uh uh these
[54:33] things. And so therefore it it it
[54:36] behooves us to guard our mouth. It
[54:40] behooves us to guard our heart. It
[54:42] behooves us not just to say words. Amen.
[54:46] but to watch what is motivating us uh uh
[54:51] uh the words that are spoken. Now you
[54:54] know uh brother Brandham in in speaking
[54:57] to people uh who just gave their heart
[55:00] to the Lord and he said this. He says
[55:03] come into the church of wherever church
[55:05] you prefer. But remember make it a
[55:09] church that believes in divine healing
[55:11] and the full gospel because some of them
[55:15] others will pump poison into you and
[55:19] you'll lose your experience after all.
[55:22] So think of it. Amen. Uh uh through
[55:25] through false words, through words that
[55:28] would be against God, uh uh words that
[55:32] would try to get us to doubt the word of
[55:36] God. Amen. Is nothing but poison to us.
[55:40] Amen. And that's what Satan does. Satan
[55:43] by words can put poison into us. Amen.
[55:47] And to where we actually lose the
[55:50] victory. we we lose the victory. Can you
[55:53] say amen? Now, uh a question was asked,
[55:57] brother Brandham said, "Brother Beal,
[55:59] can can the Lord do effective work
[56:02] through me in a congregation where they
[56:04] do not believe in the spiritual gifts?"
[56:06] Now, notice, he says, "I doubt it very
[56:08] much. I'm I'm very much in doubt, dear
[56:11] friend, that the Lord could efficiently
[56:13] work through you because you are linked
[56:16] up among unbelievers."
[56:18] And the Bible said, "Yoke yourself not
[56:21] up with unbelievers, but come out from
[56:23] among them, and be ye separated, said
[56:26] the Lord, and then I will receive you."
[56:28] See, now I I believe if you live in a
[56:31] city where there is a church that does
[56:33] believe in signs and spiritual gifts,
[56:35] and you have them things working on you,
[56:37] I would go to that church where they
[56:40] believed it. Ain't that right? Because
[56:43] people that just they if if they don't
[56:45] believe in something, they're going to
[56:47] express it in words. People that do
[56:49] believe in things in something, they're
[56:52] going to express it in in words because
[56:54] they're going to communicate what what
[56:57] they believe. They're going to
[56:58] communicate with what they don't believe
[57:00] in and and and these things. Can you say
[57:03] amen? So, Brother Bram said,
[57:04] "Unbelievers will actually hurt you."
[57:07] Amen. because they speak words that are
[57:11] anointed with the spirit of unbelief.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram says, "Don't yoke up
[57:17] your yourself up unequally." Amen. He
[57:20] says, "I've seen people come to the
[57:22] platform and be healed, walk away, and
[57:26] mix up with unbelievers and their
[57:28] sickness come right back to them again."
[57:32] Ain't that right? So words have a a an
[57:35] authority. Words have power. Words,
[57:38] amen, can can be positive or or negative
[57:42] and and and and and what what we what
[57:45] what words do is expressing a spirit
[57:49] that that is or the nature of of an
[57:52] individual. Amen. See, and so the the
[57:56] kind of words that are spoken and the
[57:59] kind of words that that we hear matter
[58:03] to us and it matters to God. A ain't
[58:06] that right? See, Jesus said, "The words
[58:09] that I speak, they are spirit and they
[58:13] are life." Ain't that right? So the
[58:16] words that I speak, they're spirit and
[58:18] then life. So then the words that Satan
[58:21] would speak, Amen, would be words of
[58:25] destruction and words of death, u uh
[58:30] words that would um uh destroy our
[58:34] experience in God. Ain't that right?
[58:38] See, and so now thinking of the words,
[58:41] the way the words uh uh are spoken
[58:47] depend upon who is the who is speaking
[58:51] them. The way a words are used, the way
[58:54] the words are are are voiced or written,
[58:59] it depends on who is speaking them. See,
[59:03] not all words and now uh uh not all
[59:06] words have authority in them. And and um
[59:11] uh you you see the person that speaks a
[59:14] word must be in a position of authority
[59:19] before his or her word has authority.
[59:24] Ain't that right? See, a a word of a
[59:26] king is far different than the word of a
[59:30] beggar. A ain't that right? Amen. When a
[59:33] king speaks, he speaks with authority.
[59:36] When a beggar speaks, he speaks with
[59:38] with uh uh just a common word. Uh maybe
[59:43] asking for for shelter, asking for food,
[59:47] asking for help. Amen. See, he's using
[59:51] words to to uh uh uh express his need.
[59:56] where as a king, he's using words to
[59:59] express his authority and his position
[1:00:03] of power. The word of a judge is far
[1:00:06] different than the word of a convicting
[1:00:09] failing. See, and and and so see the
[1:00:13] word that that a king or a judge would
[1:00:16] speak, Amen. It it's the word of
[1:00:19] authority because they are in authority.
[1:00:23] Can you say amen? They're they're in
[1:00:26] authority. So whether they speak words
[1:00:28] or write words on a piece of paper, see
[1:00:32] they are words of authority.
[1:00:34] Ecclesiastes 8 and4 it says where the
[1:00:38] word of a king is, there is power.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Not just where the
[1:00:45] word uh of of somebody or anybody is,
[1:00:49] there's power. the word of a king,
[1:00:52] because that king is in a position of
[1:00:55] authority. And where that word of a king
[1:00:59] is, then there is power. And who may say
[1:01:02] unto him, "What doest thou?" Why? He's
[1:01:06] in a he's a he's in a position of
[1:01:09] sovereignty. He's sovereign. He can use
[1:01:12] his word in and no matter what. Uh he
[1:01:15] can use words to condemn. He can use
[1:01:17] words to uh to pardon. He can use words
[1:01:21] uh uh whatever because he's in this
[1:01:23] position of authority. Ain't that right?
[1:01:26] Within the government uh uh uh the
[1:01:29] United States, you know, uh authority is
[1:01:32] exercised by men who are in authority.
[1:01:36] And and the greater the position uh
[1:01:39] power a man has uh the the greater
[1:01:44] authority his words will have. A ain't
[1:01:47] that right? Amen. There's different
[1:01:49] levels of of uh positions and things in
[1:01:53] in in the government. Now, now
[1:01:56] government uh it's it means the
[1:01:58] continuous exercise of authority over
[1:02:02] and the performance of functions for a
[1:02:05] political unit. The the body of persons
[1:02:08] that constitutes the governing authority
[1:02:12] of a political unit or organization or
[1:02:15] uh or whatever. So men govern with
[1:02:19] authoritative direction or control.
[1:02:23] Amen. Men that are in government and in
[1:02:26] position of authority. It's they don't
[1:02:28] ask us what we want. They don't ask us
[1:02:30] what they should do. They they're in a
[1:02:33] position of authority. So they they use
[1:02:37] words uh uh to command. They they use
[1:02:40] words to establish laws and to enact
[1:02:44] laws and and and these things because
[1:02:47] it's it's a a word of authority within
[1:02:52] the government. There are different
[1:02:53] roles and positions and ranks. Uh there
[1:02:57] you you have uh uh a policeman that that
[1:03:01] is a a uh authoritative figure. You you
[1:03:05] have the mayor, he's an authoritative
[1:03:08] figure. You you have the governor that's
[1:03:11] an authoritative uh figure. You you have
[1:03:14] the congressman and the senators and and
[1:03:17] and the president and and all of these
[1:03:20] are are different levels of of
[1:03:23] government and and and each one of these
[1:03:26] have a different level of authority.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? and and and so they
[1:03:32] have this this this uh uh level of
[1:03:35] authority and their authority uh
[1:03:38] operates within their jurisdiction.
[1:03:41] Now I've thought of this word
[1:03:43] jurisdiction. It's the limit or
[1:03:46] territory within which authority may be
[1:03:50] exercised. So so the policeman has his
[1:03:54] jurisdiction of authority. Amen. and
[1:03:57] within his jurisdiction when he's
[1:04:00] operating and well then he's got an
[1:04:02] authority, a man, to command and and and
[1:04:06] and these things. Well, then the mayor,
[1:04:09] he has his jurisdiction of of authority
[1:04:13] to what where he operates and his words
[1:04:17] mean something. A ain't that right?
[1:04:19] Amen. If he's a mayor of this of this
[1:04:22] city, well, his words mean something
[1:04:25] here. But but now it wouldn't matter if
[1:04:28] it it wouldn't mean anything if he went
[1:04:30] down to Pawne Oklahoma and and started
[1:04:34] uh that's not his jurisdiction. Amen.
[1:04:37] His jurisdiction is here right in this
[1:04:40] city. Uh the governor has his own
[1:04:44] jurisdiction and and his jurisdiction or
[1:04:47] his authority uh is greater than the
[1:04:50] authority of the mayor or uh uh or maybe
[1:04:54] even that of the policeman. Uh and his
[1:04:57] jurisdiction is is spread out not just
[1:05:00] to a city, but it's to the state of
[1:05:02] Virginia. Ain't that right? Amen. And
[1:05:06] then there's the president that has
[1:05:07] jurisdiction. Amen. wherein he can
[1:05:11] exercise his authority and and and and
[1:05:15] uh over the nation and and these things.
[1:05:17] But but in their office, in their
[1:05:20] jurisdiction, each man can can speak
[1:05:24] words uh of authority. Now, thinking of
[1:05:28] this, Psalms 103:19, "The Lord hath
[1:05:32] prepared his throne, in the heavens, not
[1:05:35] not in a a state or not in a country,
[1:05:39] not in a city, but in the heavens."
[1:05:42] Amen. And his kingdom, everybody say,
[1:05:46] his kingdom ruleth over all.
[1:05:50] Amen. See, so it's a kingdom that is
[1:05:53] greater than any other kingdom on this
[1:05:56] earth. Amen. It it his kingdom ruleth
[1:06:00] over all. Amen. Whether it's Satan's
[1:06:02] kingdom and and and uh in invisible
[1:06:06] kingdom and and a ruler. Satan is the
[1:06:09] ruler of darkness and and and he's got
[1:06:12] his kingdom. He's got his domain. And
[1:06:14] yet the Bible says that God reignth over
[1:06:17] all, visible, invisible. Well, ain't
[1:06:20] that right? Amen. Psalms uh 47 and8, God
[1:06:25] reignth over the heathen. God siteth
[1:06:28] upon the throne of his holiness. Amen.
[1:06:33] See, so God's kingdom uh if if we could
[1:06:36] say it, God's rule isn't something that
[1:06:39] he's ruling somewhere and and and all
[1:06:42] men is ruling and they've got their
[1:06:45] jurisdiction. God is got his own
[1:06:47] jurisdiction, but God's jurisdiction is
[1:06:50] over heaven and earth. Amen. He rules
[1:06:53] over everything. Do you believe that?
[1:06:56] Amen. See, so his power is not limited.
[1:06:59] His his authority is not limited. His
[1:07:03] his word is not limited to anything.
[1:07:07] Amen. Uh uh Proverbs 21 and1 it says the
[1:07:11] king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.
[1:07:15] as the rivers of water, he turneth it
[1:07:18] whethersoever he will. Now, we can we we
[1:07:21] we can read a lot of scriptures
[1:07:23] concerning the the power and the
[1:07:26] authority and the sovereignty of God.
[1:07:30] God doesn't have to ask for permission.
[1:07:32] God doesn't have to uh uh seek our
[1:07:35] guidance and our will and and and and
[1:07:39] these things. He he just does exactly
[1:07:41] what he wants to do. And he tells us
[1:07:44] that my word will not return unto me
[1:07:47] void. Amen. That when I speak my word,
[1:07:50] it's going to accomplish. It's it's
[1:07:52] going to perform, Amen. that which I
[1:07:55] have sent it to do. So when we look at
[1:07:58] God's kingdom and God's authority, well,
[1:08:00] God's kingdom is is greater than man's.
[1:08:03] It's it's greater than any authority
[1:08:06] that man may have.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; We think of God, we think of supreme.
[1:08:12] Amen. The prophet said, "God is
[1:08:15] supreme." How many believes that?
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; God is supreme. We must not forget that
[1:08:22] church. Amen. That God is supreme. His
[1:08:25] kingdom is supreme. His government is
[1:08:28] supreme. His reign is supreme. His word
[1:08:33] is supreme. Amen. You know, within the
[1:08:37] United States, we have uh uh different
[1:08:41] types of courts. Uh we have federal
[1:08:44] court and we have the state courts and
[1:08:49] uh a lot of lot of courts and things and
[1:08:53] and within the federal courts uh there
[1:08:56] there's the district courts um which
[1:09:00] serve as trial courts of general
[1:09:03] jurisdiction.
[1:09:05] But then there's also the the courts of
[1:09:07] appeals. Amen. But then the highest
[1:09:12] federal court in the land is what? The
[1:09:15] Supreme Court. Ain't that right? The
[1:09:18] Supreme Court. Now I I I brother Bram
[1:09:22] had talked on this. I think the Supreme
[1:09:24] uh in uh courts and and and uh the uh in
[1:09:29] the absolute and things, but but I
[1:09:32] looked up the word supreme. It's highest
[1:09:35] in rank or authority. True.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; A position of unquestioned authority.
[1:09:42] This is what supreme means. Now, it's
[1:09:45] the highest in rank or authority. A
[1:09:49] position of unquestioned authority,
[1:09:52] dominance or influence, paramount,
[1:09:56] sovereign, chief. Ain't that right? So,
[1:09:59] so when the word supreme is connected to
[1:10:03] something, amen, then that something
[1:10:07] becomes the ultimate or the the the
[1:10:10] final say, the final authority. Amen.
[1:10:14] All the other courts, it it's just
[1:10:16] courts. It's it's it's it's this. But
[1:10:18] then there's a supreme court. Amen.
[1:10:21] which which tells us that you know uh uh
[1:10:25] uh a a lower court can a judge of that
[1:10:28] has the authority and and and maybe
[1:10:31] he'll decide a case and he'll say well
[1:10:34] this is the way it's going to be. Amen.
[1:10:36] Well, that person could say, "Well, hold
[1:10:38] it. I I I think I'm going to appeal
[1:10:41] that." And and he appeals it and it goes
[1:10:44] to a higher court and and and then it
[1:10:46] can go all the way up to the Supreme
[1:10:48] Court. Amen.
[1:10:51] And so when it gets to the Supreme
[1:10:53] Court, then once a decision is made in
[1:10:57] that court, then that is the final say
[1:11:00] so.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? And they can
[1:11:04] speak even contrary to the lower courts.
[1:11:08] Amen. The lower courts could decide
[1:11:10] something. But if the Supreme Court
[1:11:13] decides contrary, Amen. Then we'll go by
[1:11:16] what the Supreme Court says and not by
[1:11:19] what this says. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:11:22] See, so so we find amen that the supreme
[1:11:26] it it shows that you have come to the
[1:11:28] absolute. Amen. In in in when when
[1:11:32] supreme has come. Amen. See, and and and
[1:11:36] so we we find that uh uh there's no more
[1:11:40] argument. There's no more chance to
[1:11:43] appeal because the case has come to its
[1:11:46] ultimate. The word ultimate means the
[1:11:49] end, the maximum, the last, the amen.
[1:11:53] Can you say amen? Amen. It's come to its
[1:11:57] end. Can't keep dragging it out. Can't
[1:11:59] question it. Amen. You've got to abide
[1:12:02] by what that Supreme Court has has said.
[1:12:05] Ain't that right? See? Well, now,
[1:12:07] Brother Brandham talks about the judges
[1:12:09] in England and and they probably might
[1:12:12] still do it today, but but when they're
[1:12:15] preciding over cases, amen, the judges
[1:12:18] will wear a white wig. Amen. And uh but
[1:12:23] there's a reason why they wear that wig.
[1:12:25] And brother Brandon says, see, they wear
[1:12:27] that white wig to show that there's no
[1:12:30] other authority in that kingdom that's
[1:12:34] above their word.
[1:12:37] They are ruling as the absolute.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; They are ruling as the final. Can you
[1:12:43] say amen?
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are the final word in that
[1:12:47] kingdom. And there's no other word above
[1:12:50] their word. See, it's the ultimate of
[1:12:53] the kingdom. Well, we could say it this
[1:12:56] way. God's word is the ultimate. And
[1:13:00] man, it's the ultimate. It's the It's
[1:13:02] the final say. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:13:05] It's the final say. And in his word is
[1:13:09] mercy. And in his word is grace. And in
[1:13:12] his word is the power to deliver. The
[1:13:16] power to pardon. Amen. The power. Amen.
[1:13:19] To set free. Amen. Now the word is the
[1:13:24] ultimate. And the word always comes to a
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; prophet. Can you say amen? Amen. See, so
[1:13:32] it is not just a word that comes to a
[1:13:35] prophet. It's the supreme word of God
[1:13:39] that comes to a a vindicated prophet.
[1:13:43] Now, brother Brandham tells us that any
[1:13:45] gift uh a prophecy has to be judged.
[1:13:49] Amen. If if I come and I say, you know,
[1:13:52] thus sayith the Lord, yada yada yada
[1:13:54] yada, you know, and and I give a a
[1:13:57] prophecy, well, it cannot the church
[1:13:59] cannot receive that until there's been
[1:14:03] two or three judges that sit there and
[1:14:06] judge that prophecy to see if it's of
[1:14:08] the Lord or not. Now, Brother Brown
[1:14:10] said, "The reason why is because Satan
[1:14:13] can slip in there, Amen, and start
[1:14:16] speaking something." Amen. I've seen
[1:14:18] prophecies break up churches. I've seen
[1:14:20] prophecies break up marriages. I've seen
[1:14:23] prophecies break up homes and families.
[1:14:26] Amen. Because they weren't of God, Satan
[1:14:29] slipped in there and and and brought a a
[1:14:33] word of division in the name of the
[1:14:35] Lord. Can you say amen?
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, but with a prophet now, see a
[1:14:41] a prophet, a vindicated prophet has to
[1:14:44] stand before no man. Amen. No. No man.
[1:14:48] Amen. A prophet uh uh doesn't have to be
[1:14:51] judged. Why? The supreme word.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; The supreme word has come to him.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and Satan can't slip in there
[1:15:01] in in a vindicated prophet.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; I know people in this message, you know,
[1:15:07] uh that claim to be in this message,
[1:15:09] they they're acting like we've got to
[1:15:11] judge the brother Brandham by the word
[1:15:13] of God. Amen. And instead of instead of
[1:15:16] judging the prophet judging us, Amen. Uh
[1:15:20] uh we they're saying we ought to judge
[1:15:23] him. Amen. And and trying to tell us
[1:15:26] where he missed it and he he did this
[1:15:28] and he did that. Well, church, they
[1:15:30] don't know what a prophet is then. Amen.
[1:15:32] For a word that comes to a prophet, and
[1:15:35] I'm talking about a vindicated prophet,
[1:15:37] is the absolute. It's the supreme word.
[1:15:41] It's the final say.
[1:15:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; His word is supreme because it's the
[1:15:48] word of the Lord that has come to him.
[1:15:50] So therefore, the word that he speaks is
[1:15:53] the absolute.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; I know people have a hard time with
[1:15:56] that. That the message being the
[1:15:58] absolute. This message is the absolute
[1:16:01] to the believer and it is the absolute
[1:16:04] to the world.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; And they will be judged by the message.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So now, brother
[1:16:12] Brandon says, "Whoever stood to judge
[1:16:15] Isaiah to see whether his prophecy was
[1:16:17] right or not, they know from his time
[1:16:20] through through that he was a prophet
[1:16:23] who stood to say to Jeremiah when God
[1:16:26] told him he had made him a prophet
[1:16:28] before his born from his mother's womb."
[1:16:31] See all and all those who lived right,
[1:16:34] they know he was a prophet. And I say
[1:16:37] this, every believer in this age knows
[1:16:40] that brother Brandham was a prophet.
[1:16:43] That's just that's just way we believe
[1:16:44] it. We know it to be so, right?
[1:16:47] Believers know. See, another place he
[1:16:50] said there's nine spiritual gifts in the
[1:16:52] church. They might be like on this man
[1:16:54] tonight and one over here uh and so
[1:16:57] forth, you know. Uh, but prophecy of
[1:17:00] that type has to have two or three
[1:17:02] witnesses to look it over, judge it, and
[1:17:05] see if it's right or not. But you never
[1:17:07] saw them stand before Isaiah or Jeremiah
[1:17:10] or any of them to judge them. For they
[1:17:12] had thus sayith the Lord from their
[1:17:14] birth.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not not hitting and missing. Not
[1:17:19] not saying something in the name of the
[1:17:21] Lord and it not be and then saying
[1:17:23] something in the name of the Lord and
[1:17:24] that be true and and all these things.
[1:17:27] No, they had thus said the Lord from the
[1:17:30] beginning.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So he says another
[1:17:33] place, you never did you see anybody
[1:17:35] stand before Isaiah to judge it. He was
[1:17:38] born a prophet. And them prophets, they
[1:17:41] had thus said the Lord right up through
[1:17:43] their life. Ain't that right?
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; I I thought of the words uh you know the
[1:17:49] word of the prophets was Jesus's
[1:17:52] absolute.
[1:17:54] Yeah,
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; they were his absolute.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; He fulfilled every word that they said,
[1:18:02] spoke concerning him.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; He quoted their words,
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Sure he did. See, he he lived by their
[1:18:13] words. He received the revelation of who
[1:18:16] he was by their words.
[1:18:21] Ain't that right? And he told them, he
[1:18:24] told his critics, "Search the
[1:18:26] scriptures."
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; For in them you think you have eternal
[1:18:30] life, but they testify of me.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He wasn't taking them
[1:18:35] to some wild blue yonder. He wasn't
[1:18:38] writing some new Bible.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; He was telling them, "Go back to the
[1:18:43] prophet's words. That's the absolute.
[1:18:46] And if you can see it, you'll find who I
[1:18:49] am." Amen.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; So Jesus recognized the authority of
[1:18:57] their word. See, then we find that the
[1:19:01] word became flesh.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; That supreme word became flesh and dwelt
[1:19:09] among us. And a man in human flesh
[1:19:14] exercised supreme authority.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; The same word that said, "Let there be
[1:19:21] light." And there was light now
[1:19:23] [screaming] was in a man being spoken in
[1:19:28] human
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; flesh.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus had supreme authority over the
[1:19:35] winds and waves, did he not?
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; He showed he had supreme authority.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; He showed that he had supreme authority
[1:19:42] over the water by turning it to wine.
[1:19:46] Amen. And he showed that he had supreme
[1:19:48] authority by causing the blind to see
[1:19:51] and the lame to walk. He showed that he
[1:19:54] had supreme authority when he stood at
[1:19:56] the grave of Lazarus who had been dead
[1:19:58] four days and and and called Lazarus
[1:20:02] come forth. Amen. And and Lazarus came
[1:20:06] forth. Amen. It was not just a word of
[1:20:10] of the Pharisees. It wasn't just the
[1:20:13] word of a church. It was the word of God
[1:20:17] which was supreme authority.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mark 1:21.
[1:20:24] And they went into compernum. And
[1:20:26] straightway on the Sabbath day he
[1:20:29] entered into the synagogue and taught.
[1:20:32] Now notice he went into the church and
[1:20:35] he taught. And they were astonished at
[1:20:38] his doctrine. For he taught them as one
[1:20:43] that had authority
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; and not as the scribes.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Now the the scribes, they taught the
[1:20:53] word. Amen. And and no doubt that they
[1:20:57] exercised what authority they had in
[1:21:00] their church. The Pharisees taught the
[1:21:03] word and and all that. and and and and
[1:21:05] no doubt they exercise the authority
[1:21:08] that they were given within their
[1:21:11] church, their denomination or whatever.
[1:21:14] But the Bible says that that Jesus
[1:21:17] taught as one with authority, not as the
[1:21:21] scribes.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So he just didn't
[1:21:26] teach with authority. Amen. But he
[1:21:29] taught with supreme authority. Now,
[1:21:32] there's a difference there, right? Amen.
[1:21:35] He taught with supreme authority. Amen.
[1:21:38] There's people maybe that takes that
[1:21:40] word and they have the authority from
[1:21:42] their church or from their seminary and
[1:21:44] and maybe they've got degrees of of in
[1:21:47] scripture and they're theologians and
[1:21:49] they've got this an authority that the
[1:21:52] church has given them to stand behind
[1:21:54] the pulpit and to teach the word. But
[1:21:57] Jesus was one who taught the word with
[1:22:00] supreme authority
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; for he was the word. Right?
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Then then what does that mean then? Then
[1:22:10] his teaching was the final say. Yeah.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; You you you you you ain't going to take
[1:22:16] his teaching and just use it for a
[1:22:18] reference
[1:22:20] and and and and then use the Pharisees
[1:22:22] and the scribes teaching as a reference
[1:22:25] and then come up with your own idea.
[1:22:28] Jesus taught with supreme authority.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; So whatever he taught was the final say
[1:22:34] over it all.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? His teaching was the
[1:22:38] absolute and was the amen. So therefore,
[1:22:42] if their teaching, if the teaching of
[1:22:44] the scribes and the Pharisees and the
[1:22:47] Sadducees didn't line up with his
[1:22:49] teaching, then the people had every
[1:22:52] right not to listen to them because now
[1:22:55] [screaming] there was a teaching that
[1:22:57] had supreme authority.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; See, his teaching had greater authority
[1:23:05] in it. Yeah.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; A man may have authority in his home as
[1:23:10] as being the head of the home. A pastor
[1:23:14] may have authority in the local church
[1:23:17] as being the head of that local
[1:23:19] assembly. Men might hold different uh uh
[1:23:23] positions
[1:23:25] uh in the church and and they have this
[1:23:28] authority whether it may be you know
[1:23:30] deacons or uh uh song leaders or uh
[1:23:35] trustees or whatever. Amen. Would would
[1:23:38] uh be there and maybe even part of the
[1:23:40] five-fold ministry uh uh of of these
[1:23:44] things. Women even might have a level of
[1:23:47] authority. Uh I I believe a woman does
[1:23:50] have have a a level of authority in the
[1:23:54] home. Amen. To teach their children the
[1:23:57] ways of God and and and to teach them
[1:24:01] how to love and to respect and and and
[1:24:04] raise them in the fear of the Lord. Can
[1:24:07] you say amen? that no matter what
[1:24:09] authority a man has and and has the
[1:24:13] right to exercise, that authority must
[1:24:17] come under subjection to supreme
[1:24:20] authority.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It must come under sub
[1:24:25] subjection to supreme authority. Sir,
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:24:31] I don't believe this message was just
[1:24:33] for the church to teach us seals and
[1:24:36] teach us whatever. I think it was there
[1:24:39] for our homes. It was there for us men.
[1:24:42] It was there for our families, our
[1:24:44] marriages. I I don't believe you need to
[1:24:47] go outside and get psychology. Amen. To
[1:24:50] fix your marriage. I I just think you
[1:24:52] ought to just subject to the word of
[1:24:54] God. No matter what position you have,
[1:24:56] there has been a supreme authority.
[1:25:00] That's right. Amen. Can
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; See, and so therefore, the authority of
[1:25:06] men has to come subject to supreme
[1:25:09] authority.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Now, in the book of Revelations, John
[1:25:13] saw one likened to the son of man
[1:25:16] walking in the midst of the seven golden
[1:25:18] candlesticks,
[1:25:19] uh, which is the seven churches.
[1:25:23] And notice this one walking in the midst
[1:25:27] likened to the son of man. He had in his
[1:25:31] right hand seven stars.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; In his right hand. And in Revelations
[1:25:38] 1:20 it says, "The mystery of the seven
[1:25:40] stars which thou sawest in mine right
[1:25:42] hand and the seven golden candlesticks."
[1:25:45] The seven stars are the angels of the
[1:25:48] seven churches. and the seven
[1:25:50] candlesticks which thou sawest are the
[1:25:53] seven churches. So, so we we know as
[1:25:57] message believers uh that the seven
[1:26:00] angels messengers were in the right hand
[1:26:04] of the one like the son of man. And
[1:26:07] notice there is an elect right there.
[1:26:10] Brother taught us in each age there is
[1:26:13] an elect. But but John did not tell us
[1:26:17] that that elect was in the right hand.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; We don't see the elect in the right hand
[1:26:25] of God.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; But we see seven angels.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Seven messengers.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; See, and these seven messengers in the
[1:26:36] right hand of God were sent one to each
[1:26:39] age. Seven ages. Seven messengers with
[1:26:42] seven messages. a message per age. Ain't
[1:26:45] that right? And they were sent to pull
[1:26:48] the elect out of that age, out of the
[1:26:51] organizational system.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "It's the Holy Spirit
[1:26:57] that's built that bride, the elect
[1:26:58] that's pulled out of all the
[1:27:01] organization systems down through the
[1:27:03] ages." See, and and if you notice in
[1:27:06] each of the church ages, God addresses
[1:27:09] uh uh the angel of that age unto the
[1:27:13] angel of the church of Ephesus, unto the
[1:27:16] angel of the church of Sernrra, unto the
[1:27:18] angel of the church of Thatara, all the
[1:27:22] way down to the Leoa. Ain't that right?
[1:27:24] And brother Brown said, "Why?" Because
[1:27:26] that angel that that's in the hand of
[1:27:29] the the right hand of him, he's the
[1:27:31] leader of that church age.
[1:27:35] ain't bunch of leaders. God doesn't
[1:27:37] recognize a bunch of leaders. Amen. He
[1:27:39] recognizes one leader to each age with
[1:27:42] an authority.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And the message is
[1:27:49] addressed to him.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram says, "God help that
[1:27:54] guy that'll pull away from that
[1:27:55] message." But it was given to an angel
[1:27:58] and the angel was in his hand. Notice
[1:28:01] under his own control. See the angel in
[1:28:05] his hand, under God's control,
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; giving it thriving power from him, from
[1:28:13] his right hand. See, they're in his
[1:28:15] right hand. That is, they're in supreme
[1:28:18] power while they're here on the earth.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:25] supreme power while they're here on the
[1:28:28] earth giving their message because they
[1:28:31] are the lights from him giving the light
[1:28:34] to that church age.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; It's just like Noah's message, a one-man
[1:28:40] message given to that whole world in
[1:28:44] that day. Amen. And his message was
[1:28:47] supreme authority for that age.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? couldn't get around
[1:28:54] it. Amen. No matter how many other
[1:28:57] messengers rose up and no matter how
[1:28:59] many others, Brother Graham said, "No
[1:29:00] doubt other other boats were being
[1:29:02] built." But God had one man on the earth
[1:29:06] at that time with the supreme authority.
[1:29:09] He had the authority to build an ark. He
[1:29:12] had the authority, amen, to preach that
[1:29:15] there's a flood coming. He had the
[1:29:17] authority. It was the supreme authority
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; over all other messages in that day.
[1:29:23] Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Over other builders in that day.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And if you notice
[1:29:28] these messengers were connected to
[1:29:32] Christ held in his right hand. Brother
[1:29:35] Brand says right hand, the right hand or
[1:29:38] arm signifies the power and authority of
[1:29:41] God.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Think of that now. They came with the
[1:29:46] authority of God for that age.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; To pull out an elect.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; See, signifies the power and authority
[1:30:00] of God. Psalms 44:3. For they got not
[1:30:04] the land in possession by their own
[1:30:06] sword, neither did their own arm save
[1:30:10] them, but thy right hand and thine arm.
[1:30:14] See,
[1:30:16] that's how they got saved
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; is by his right arm and thy his right
[1:30:20] hand and the light of thy countenance
[1:30:23] because thou hastest a favor unto them.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; So the seven stars, these messengers
[1:30:28] with the message to each age are in his
[1:30:31] right hand. Amen. Which signifies,
[1:30:34] brother Brown says that the very power
[1:30:37] and authority of God are behind his
[1:30:40] messengers to every age.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Think of it. We could be sitting
[1:30:50] under another message. We could be
[1:30:53] caught up in some other doctrine without
[1:30:55] no authority from God.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Maybe authority from a church.
[1:31:00] Maybe the church backs it up. But let
[1:31:02] let God [screaming] back something up.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; And here we are tied to the thing that
[1:31:08] God
[1:31:09] places his approval on and his
[1:31:12] authority.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; John wrote about the seven spirits of
[1:31:16] God sent forth throughout the aven
[1:31:21] spirits. They're the seven messengers.
[1:31:25] Seven messengers. Colombia, Ireina, St.
[1:31:27] Martin Wesley, you know, Martin Luther
[1:31:30] and and and I say, "Brother Brandham,
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we don't have to wonder and
[1:31:35] guess who's the messenger is of this
[1:31:38] seventh age." Can you say, "Amen."
[1:31:41] Brother Brham said, "These seven
[1:31:42] messengers are making God known to the
[1:31:45] people."
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on now.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; They're making God known to the people.
[1:31:52] It ain't It ain't these TV evangelists.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; It ain't these radio preachers. It ain't
[1:31:57] the psychologist, Christian
[1:31:58] psychologist. It ain't. There's one man
[1:32:02] in the age today that has made God known
[1:32:05] to us.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And God has had one man to each age to
[1:32:12] make himself known through that man,
[1:32:14] through that message.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Jesus said in John
[1:32:19] 13:20, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:32:22] he that receiveth whomsoever I send
[1:32:25] receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
[1:32:28] receiveth him that sent me."
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; So then the prophet said, "These
[1:32:33] messengers speak and act upon his
[1:32:36] authority. He stands behind them with
[1:32:40] all the power of the godhead."
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Another place he says
[1:32:46] they go forth in the power, fire, and
[1:32:48] power of the Holy Ghost with the word.
[1:32:51] They are stars because they reflect
[1:32:53] light. The light they reflect is his
[1:32:56] light. They have no light of their own.
[1:32:58] They kindle not their own fires that men
[1:33:00] may walk in the light of their sparks.
[1:33:04] Ain't that right? So here another place
[1:33:07] it says see see him him walking through
[1:33:11] the the these church ages the Christ
[1:33:15] making himself known to his people down
[1:33:18] through these dark ages and down through
[1:33:20] every age.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; See while the church got formal and
[1:33:24] pulled out and some went one way some
[1:33:26] another but that little minority of the
[1:33:29] church still held on and Christ worked
[1:33:31] with them confirming his word. Why?
[1:33:35] Because that God would send a messenger
[1:33:38] to that age with the divine authority
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; and the elect grew or or gravitated to
[1:33:46] that message.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; That messenger
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; and God was with them.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says each time that the
[1:33:55] star came on the scene, the Holy Spirit
[1:33:57] came down and anointed that star and
[1:34:00] kept it just exactly like the first one
[1:34:02] was. We know the first one was Paul,
[1:34:05] right?
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so the the elect of each
[1:34:09] age recognized the the word of of
[1:34:13] authority that the messenger of their
[1:34:15] day had just as the centurion did in
[1:34:19] Jesus's day. Amen. When he said, "My
[1:34:22] servant my servant is is is sick. He's
[1:34:25] dying." Amen. And and and I I need you.
[1:34:29] Amen. What Jesus said, "Well, I'll just
[1:34:30] come over and and I I'll lay my hands on
[1:34:32] him." No. No, no. That centurion
[1:34:35] recognized an authority. [screaming]
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Recognized the authority.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; I'm under authority.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. But notice, he recognized that the
[1:34:48] authority Jesus had was above his
[1:34:50] authority.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; He recognized that Jesus had supreme
[1:34:54] authority. Can you say amen? He didn't
[1:34:57] have the authority. Amen. This this man
[1:34:59] realized he didn't have the authority
[1:35:02] over sickness and over death and and
[1:35:05] diseases and and all of these things.
[1:35:07] But here was a man that had a supreme
[1:35:10] authority.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; The authority that could
[1:35:16] command demons to leave. Just speak the
[1:35:20] word. Can you say amenise the Lord? Mark
[1:35:23] 1:23
[1:35:25] says, "And there was in their synagogue
[1:35:27] a man with an unclean spirit, and he
[1:35:30] cried, saying, Let us alone,
[1:35:33] for what have we to do with thee, thou,
[1:35:36] Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to
[1:35:39] destroy us? I know thee who thou who
[1:35:42] thou art, the Holy One of God?" And
[1:35:44] Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy
[1:35:46] peace, and come out of him.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the unclean spirit had
[1:35:50] torn him and cried with a loud voice, he
[1:35:53] came out of him. And they were all
[1:35:55] amazed
[1:35:56] in so much that they questioned among
[1:35:58] themselves, saying, "What thing is this?
[1:36:01] What new doctrine is this? For with
[1:36:04] authority commandeth he even the unclean
[1:36:06] spirits, and they do obey him."
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:36:13] with supreme authority.
[1:36:15] He commanded spirits to leave the
[1:36:18] people. Why? His word was the final say.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Doctors can say one thing but let God
[1:36:26] speak.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; And that becomes the final.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; See, and so we find that God being the
[1:36:35] word, God's the word and the word made
[1:36:38] manifest.
[1:36:40] Now, Matthew 2:6, "And thou Bethlehem in
[1:36:43] the land of Judah? Art not the least
[1:36:46] among the princes of Judah, for out of
[1:36:49] thee shall come a governor that shall
[1:36:52] rule my people Israel."
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Well, [snorts] aren't you glad for that?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. A governor that will rule my
[1:36:59] people, Israel. Amen. Not Satan the
[1:37:03] ruler. Amen. I'm so glad for that. Amen.
[1:37:06] See, and that prophet reading this
[1:37:08] scripture, he says, "The Holy Spirit
[1:37:10] today rules over the people." And the
[1:37:13] Holy Spirit is the word. Somebody say,
[1:37:16] "The Holy Spirit is the word."
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit ruling over the people.
[1:37:22] Amen. A sovereign rule, a supreme rule
[1:37:26] by the supreme word.
[1:37:29] Now notice and I I hope this all right
[1:37:32] but brother Brandham says in the days of
[1:37:34] the seventh messenger in the days of
[1:37:37] Leoian age its messenger will reveal the
[1:37:40] mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he
[1:37:44] will speak out and those who receive
[1:37:47] that prophet in his own name will
[1:37:50] receive the benefit effect of that
[1:37:53] prophet's ministry.
[1:37:56] And they that hear him will be blessed
[1:38:00] and become part of that bride of the
[1:38:03] last days who are mentioned in
[1:38:06] Revelations 22:17.
[1:38:09] Well, what does it say in Revelations
[1:38:11] 22:17?
[1:38:13] The spirit and the bride say come.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; The spirit and the bride say come.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; I I think that means something to us.
[1:38:22] Those that receive that prophet of this
[1:38:25] last day, a prophet of Malachi 4, that
[1:38:28] seventh angel messenger, Amen. Those who
[1:38:31] receive his message, Amen. and receive
[1:38:34] that prophet in his own name will
[1:38:36] receive the benefit effect of that
[1:38:38] prophet's ministry.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; It It's no longer It's not just us
[1:38:45] saying, "Well, brother Brandham done it.
[1:38:46] Brother Brandham did it. Brother
[1:38:48] Brandham did it." But there is a people
[1:38:50] that's received him. receive what he had
[1:38:53] to say and they become part of that
[1:38:56] ministry.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And they that hear him
[1:39:02] will be blessed and become part of that
[1:39:04] bride of the last day mentioned in 22:17
[1:39:08] Revelations. See, so what that tells us
[1:39:11] is is is we've had a prophet come with
[1:39:15] with a a a a voice of authority, but now
[1:39:19] the bride is going to speak.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And brother Brown
[1:39:24] says, "The word is in the bride."
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Can you say that with
[1:39:30] me? The word is in the bride. Well, what
[1:39:33] word is in this bride? A supreme word.
[1:39:37] The word that come to a prophet, she has
[1:39:40] received it. And that word now
[1:39:42] [screaming]
[1:39:42] is in her.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what Paul says? The word of
[1:39:46] faith is nigh thee, even in thy mouth
[1:39:48] and in thine heart. That is the word of
[1:39:51] faith which we preach.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; So, it's a word of authority that's in
[1:39:59] the bride.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; You may not have much in life. You may
[1:40:06] not have no position of authority in
[1:40:08] life. You may not be the governor, the
[1:40:10] mayor, or some politician. We don't have
[1:40:12] to strive for that. We've got an
[1:40:15] authority,
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; a supreme authority.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's showing that the sons
[1:40:24] and daughters are coming into adoption,
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; a position of authority. Can you say
[1:40:30] amen? And she is the final voice to the
[1:40:34] final age.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; She's not just part of the lower court
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; speaking. Amen. And and and and then her
[1:40:44] words are being changed in a higher
[1:40:46] court, but whatever she says. Amen. The
[1:40:49] supreme God backs it up because it is
[1:40:52] the supreme word of [screaming] God that
[1:40:54] she is speaking.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; That's true. She is the final voice to
[1:41:00] the final age. That's right.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; How how did she become this final voice?
[1:41:05] Amen. Well, she's fulfilling Revelations
[1:41:07] 10:8 through10. Amen. After the after
[1:41:10] the mighty angel come down with that
[1:41:12] book and and and the seventh angel,
[1:41:15] Amen. sounded, Amen. and revealed the
[1:41:18] what the inheritance in the book to the
[1:41:21] people. Then John
[1:41:24] was commissioned to go to the angel.
[1:41:27] Take that book, take that revealed word,
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; take that word of authority
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; and eat it up.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Eat it up.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Eat it up. He says, "I took the little
[1:41:41] book." Amen. Revelations there uh uh 10
[1:41:46] and 10. I took the little book out of
[1:41:47] the angel's hand and ate it up. It was
[1:41:51] in my mouth sweeted as was sweet as
[1:41:53] honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my
[1:41:56] belly was bitter. Other words, you're
[1:41:58] not going to be able to You're not going
[1:42:00] to take this book without persecutions.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; You're not going to take this book
[1:42:04] without trials. You're not going to take
[1:42:07] this book without troubles.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; The more you get and eating this book
[1:42:12] and accepting and receiving what a
[1:42:14] prophet said, amen, and taking it inside
[1:42:17] of you, hell is going to break loose.
[1:42:20] But don't you worry, brothers, sisters,
[1:42:23] don't you worry. You're eating the word
[1:42:25] of authority
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; that even the devil himself has to back
[1:42:30] up on.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; He said it was in in my belly bitter.
[1:42:37] And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[1:42:39] again before many peoples, nations,
[1:42:41] tongues, and kings."
[1:42:43] If you go to 2 Corinthians 3:2, Paul
[1:42:46] would say, "You are our epistle written
[1:42:50] in our heart, known and read of all
[1:42:52] men."
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; For as much as you are manifestly
[1:42:55] declared to be the epistle of Christ,
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; ministered by us, written not with ink,
[1:43:04] but with the spirit of the living God,
[1:43:07] not in tables of stone, but in fleshly
[1:43:10] tables of the heart.
[1:43:12] Well, aren't you glad for that?
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; And then the prophet says, listen to
[1:43:17] this. The authenticated prophet of God
[1:43:20] who appears in this last age, what he
[1:43:23] says from God, the bride will say,
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[1:43:30] will be saying the same thing.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:38] God has shown
[1:43:41] that
[1:43:43] the message that has come to us is
[1:43:46] supreme.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; It's it's come to its finale.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; It's come to its ultimate.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; It's come to the final say. And brother
[1:44:02] Brandamman speaking of the picture of
[1:44:03] the seventh angels that appeared over
[1:44:06] Tucson
[1:44:08] and there in the rising of the sun, he
[1:44:10] said, "If you'll turn the picture like
[1:44:12] this and look, turn it to the right, you
[1:44:15] can probably see it from the audience.
[1:44:18] It's Christ."
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; See, he's looking, his eyes looking
[1:44:21] here, just as perfect as it could be,
[1:44:24] wearing the white wig of supreme deity
[1:44:27] and judge of all heavens and earth.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you see his eyes, nose, his
[1:44:31] mouth? Just turn the picture from this
[1:44:33] the way they had it this way. The way
[1:44:36] it's supposed to be. He is supreme
[1:44:38] judge. There is none other but him. And
[1:44:42] that is a perfect identification again a
[1:44:47] vindication that this message is the
[1:44:49] truth.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Can you say amen?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; It's not to be questioned. It's not to
[1:44:56] be fought over. It's not to to be
[1:45:00] dissected.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; It's the supreme authority.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come
[1:45:11] and supreme power was once again
[1:45:14] demonstrated in this age.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; A man's words
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; had supreme authority over a storm.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; The words of a man that come from a man
[1:45:32] had supreme authority
[1:45:36] over all manners of sickness and
[1:45:38] diseases.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; It had supreme authority
[1:45:44] over two boys that were standing there
[1:45:47] snickering and laughing at what was
[1:45:50] going on.
[1:45:52] With supreme authority, that man spoke
[1:45:55] the word and created squirrels.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Supreme authority.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God night after night
[1:46:11] displayed [music] a supreme intelligence
[1:46:13] that revealed the secrets of the hearts
[1:46:15] of men.
[1:46:18] If that man could speak words
[1:46:22] with supreme authority behind them in
[1:46:25] the mountains
[1:46:28] that would cause a snowstorm to
[1:46:30] dissipate. [music]
[1:46:35] If that man could be out in the woods
[1:46:37] and [music]
[1:46:39] speak words of authority, supreme
[1:46:43] authority,
[1:46:46] and cause squirrels to appear. [music]
[1:46:49] If if that man could stand in a boat
[1:46:54] and speak words with supreme authority
[1:46:58] and give a fish back its life,
[1:47:03] if he [music] could speak the word with
[1:47:05] supreme authority in a house and grant a
[1:47:09] mother's [music] wish
[1:47:12] that I believe with all of my heart
[1:47:16] [music] that as he stood behind the
[1:47:18] pulpit But night after night,
[1:47:22] it was not just him [music] preaching,
[1:47:26] but he was preaching words with the
[1:47:28] supreme authority. [music]
[1:47:32] Can you say amen?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Supreme authority.
[1:47:39] He taught adoption with [music] supreme
[1:47:42] authority.
[1:47:47] They'll tell us he didn't understand
[1:47:48] adoption.
[1:47:50] That's a lie.
[1:47:53] He taught adoption with supreme
[1:47:55] authority. [music]
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; He taught Jesus name baptism with
[1:47:58] supreme authority. He taught the godhead
[1:48:01] with supreme authority. He taught the
[1:48:04] rapture with supreme authority.
[1:48:07] He taught the serpent seed with supreme
[1:48:10] authority.
[1:48:12] [music]
[1:48:13] When he told us get back to Pentecost,
[1:48:15] he had supreme authority to say that.
[1:48:19] Can you say amen? Supreme authority.
[1:48:22] [music]
[1:48:22] See this message is supreme authority.
[1:48:26] When he said this is not a Pentecostal
[1:48:28] age, this is a latter the latter day
[1:48:31] age. This is the bright age.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; This is the evening light. This is when
[1:48:36] Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow
[1:48:39] God's pattern. This is Luke 17:30. He
[1:48:43] said it with supreme authority.
[1:48:47] [music]
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're not living in a
[1:48:49] Pentecostal age. We're living in another
[1:48:51] age.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; We're not living in the Methodist age.
[1:48:54] We're living in another age. We're
[1:48:55] living on up here to the bride age, the
[1:48:58] calling out of the church and getting it
[1:49:00] together [music] for the rapture."
[1:49:01] That's the age we're now living in. And
[1:49:03] he said it with an authority that was
[1:49:06] supreme. [music] Supreme authority.
[1:49:10] Aren't you glad for that?
[1:49:13] Hallelujah. I love him. Amen. I pray it
[1:49:16] was a help to you tonight.
[1:49:19] Amen. [music] Amen. Amen.
[1:49:22] In the name [singing] of the Lord. Is
[1:49:25] that the one we got the power? [music]
[1:49:28] We've got the power
[1:49:34] in the name [singing]
[1:49:36] of Jesus.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; We've got the power.
[1:49:51] [music]
[1:49:57] We're [music] not beggars here today.
[1:50:02] That we are sons and daughters of God in
[1:50:04] a position of authority. [music]
[1:50:08] Don't use our words to to whine and to
[1:50:11] to [music] complain and but use our
[1:50:16] words with an authority over the devil.
[1:50:19] I don't care what problem you got,
[1:50:21] you've got the [music] authority over
[1:50:22] him.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; If you're sick, you've got an authority
[1:50:26] over it. If you're bound, you've got an
[1:50:29] authority over [music] it. If you're
[1:50:31] having issues in your home, you've got
[1:50:33] an authority over it.
[1:50:36] Amen. [music] minutes of supreme
[1:50:37] authority in this age.
[1:50:40] Supreme authority to claim your children
[1:50:42] and to claim your unsaved loved one.
[1:50:47] Amen. Supreme authority.
[1:50:50] Hallelujah. Do you love the Lord today?
[1:50:52] [music]
[1:50:54] Oh, [singing] we've got the power
[1:50:59] [music]
[1:51:01] in the [singing] name of the Lord.
[1:51:07] Now, for many years now,
[1:51:13] Satan's [music]
[1:51:14] tried to stop us.
[1:51:19] But [music] the bride [singing] of Jesus
[1:51:25] [music] is still [singing]
[1:51:27] alive.
[1:51:30] [music] Amen. And like a mighty
[1:51:32] [singing]
[1:51:34] army,
[1:51:37] we [music] keep marching upward,
[1:51:40] [singing]
[1:51:43] [music]
[1:51:44] winning every battle.
[1:51:50] for the Lord's on [singing and music]
[1:51:52] our side.
[1:51:56] We've got the power
[1:52:02] in the [music] name of Jesus. [singing]
[1:52:08] We've [music]
[1:52:09] got the power
[1:52:13] [music]
[1:52:15] in the [singing] name of the Lord.
[1:52:20] [music]
[1:52:21] Though Satan
[1:52:23] rages, [singing]
[1:52:27] [music] we will not be defeated.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; We've got the power
