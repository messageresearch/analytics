the gift that you placed Within Me Lord and that predestinated seed that you put in the people people father Lord I pray that it be quickened father even more Lord May there be a pool Lord I I pray father just don't let it just be a a an average service father but Lord may we know that we have been with you let it be an eternal thing Lord that happens within us tonight we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen um Luke the 1st chapter the 26th verse and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell th thou that art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among me women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be saying I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and power the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of the shall be called The Son of God then if you go to the 38th verse it says and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her then if you'll go to the fifth chapter chap same book um and we'll start at the the first verse it says and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of uh gurat some to that effect and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their Nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship and when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drought and Simon answered answering said unto him Master we have P all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless everybody say nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net and when they had uh this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break amen you can have your seats this evening praise the Lord Lord if I uh were to maybe use a title it would be the word is effective to those who believe it and you know I've I've I've talked about faith so much and and I guess most ministers do message Believers in one way or another and that is because uh faith in the word of God can never never be uh overemphasized and we're living in an age where our faith is really being challenged uh more than ever before in in my uh uh belief of it and um but we know and and these things you you you already know but just to remind us but that faith in the word of God is the only everybody say is the only ingredient that God requires a man to have it takes Faith to be saved it takes Faith to be healed it takes Faith to be delivered it takes Faith to to even be steadfast and unmovable and we're living in a in a shaking time and it's a falling away just exactly the way the Bible says it but it takes faith not to be in that great falling away it doesn't take great great strength it just takes faith and so it takes Faith to endure the Bible says he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved and and trust me there's there's only a few people that's going to endure and we're we're understanding the more that time terries uh just how few it really is going to be but when it's said and done it's only going to be by faith that they've endured it takes Faith to overcome it takes Faith to call those things that are not as though they were it it it and and and we know we we talk about rapture we talk about the changing of our body but none of that will happen without faith it that's the key thing that everyone will have that goes in the Rapture is faith faith brings about the body change faith is is what changes us from Mortal to immortality and it will take Faith to be caught up to meet the Lord in the air and and so uh um um uh a as human beings uh living in this life we will face challenges I I guarantee you you face challenges today uh or you're facing challenges or you're going to face challenges and and deal with issues in in in your life and we will always have problems I don't care how spiritual we get and how grounded in the word we we become we're going to have problems you're going to deal with issues you're going to we'll have sicknesses that we have to deal with we'll Satan is constantly and will be constantly as long as we're in this body of mortality he's going to be trying to put things upon us and and we're we're we're looking at at time where sicknesses are are becoming more prevalent than ever before doctors don't even know what to do with them uh hospitals insane asylums all these things are filling up like crazy and and and just sickness upon sickness upon sickness upon sickness and and these things and and these things ain't a a figment of our imagination these things are real and yet it's only by faith in the word of God that we can withstand any of this that is that that is here and and it it's it's the only way that we can defeat Satan in every one of his tricks is by faith for even Peter I believe it was uh Peter that said faith is the victory that overcometh the world or this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith that right and so so the the word of God though is is not just something to be learned it's it's not something that we just come into to a church to the service and then we hear a preaching and or we'll go home and play tape or play it on the car and and all of these things and then we we leave it when the tape is done or when surfice is over we leave we just all leave it you know there and then we go do our own thing it's the word of God is not just something to be used as a conversational piece uh that we all just discuss the end time and we all discuss what knowledge that we have and compare it with other what other people might have or not have as far as biblical knowledge and it's it's it was not written for men to make a career out of it and and and and and many men have made a career off of the word of God and and it's just nothing but a career and and but yet the word of God was given for us to believe it it is meant to be believed it it's got to be believed amen and and you know it it's amazes me uh to see the millions of people who who claim to be Christians and yet not have faith in the word of God that Christianity is built upon you you can't even be a Christian without faith you can't be saved without faith and and yet many people said church and don't have any faith in the word of God whatsoever they'll have more faith in in in their occupation or they'll have more faith in the government they have more faith in the doctors they have more faith in their money and in materialistic things or uh uh then then they they do the word of God and but you faith in money faith in in government faith in in politics faith in whatever it it does not make you a Christian it has to be faith in the word of God can you say Amen now so so uh uh we have seen how people have made Christianity about their good works or about what church they belong to or uh the rules of their church and and they do the same thing about healing amen you know uh if if the doctor gives them a clean bill of health yipp IIA you know uh then then they feel like they're going to make make it or or they'll they'll look for that certain preacher to lay hands upon them then they know that they're going to be okay and and and things like that and and yet yet that's that's not faith faith God never raised up men for us to have have have faith in personalities he he just never did and yet so many people go after the personalities you know brother random said I've seen people shout and praise the Lord and not enough Faith to heal a toothache now you think of that uh uh uh he can shout can dance can roll on the floor can be so professional in music so be so just right in the way they preach and conduct themselves and and can actually be the best tithe payers and can be the most dedicated church people and yet not have faith and and and that's the thing people lack the real ingredients and that is Faith amen and and the house of God or the Christian duties and and the things of Christian is just something that we do we go to work we we go shopping when we need groceries and and we we go to church too you know and it's all that we fit in a schedule see well and and and and that's not way God intended somebody's got to take God at his word come hell or high water sick or sin it doesn't matter the word of God is to be believed ain't that right we've seen people who live clean and moral lives I've seen them you know so legalistic in their teaching and yet they have no faith amen hardly to blow their nose see it it's just they they don't have no faith uh to do anything with but see healing and deliverance and salvation is only effective when we have faith in the word of God if you want to see Power in God then it takes faith if this if this word is ever going to live and we know that is this is the age where every scripture must be fulfilled that is spoken by the bride and it's going to it can only be by faith that we do this it ain't because you believe God sent a prophet it ain't because you go to a message Church it ain't it ain't because you sit under such a a uh maybe go to a dynamic uh uh meeting and and you go to Revival after Revival and youth meeting after youth meeting and and all of that it you know there there it's sadden that that it saddens me that so many people are lacking and they're looking and and and really got the ingredients and that is the word of God all they need is faith faith can you say Amen yes I I believe in Reviving Revival and and I think these meetings are good but when you go to them as as as your pacifier as as though you need you become like the drug addict and the alcoholic they they need something to keep them going they need something to keep them thriving well the only thing that'll keep you going is Faith it it's true can you say amen amen faith Faith keeps that word from being dead to you and keeps it alive amen now the Bible says that all things are possible to them that believe so do you realize that going to the doctor don't guarantee your healing we we'll we'll pay all kinds of stuff nothing wrong with going to doctors mind you but we'll give them all kinds of money and have no guarantee that we're going to get a clean bill of health and even when they do give us medication how do we know that's really going to work but we'll take their we'll take it we'll take it act like everything going to be all right because we're taking their medicine amen but when it comes to the word of God we always question the word of God for some reason but the Bible says all things are possible to them that take their medicine it didn't say that did it all things are possible to them that go to the doctor all things that possible to them that get a clean bill of health from Dr so and so it it ain't that all things are possible to them that believe can you say Amen following a personality doesn't guarantee you that you're going to heaven on and I I'll just be honest setting in a message Church doesn't guarantee you that you're going to heaven if if there's no faith that's right amen prise the Lord can you say Amen see so faith in the word of God is the only guarantee that you have ain't that right amen see so then we find that the authority over every devil in hell lays in the word of God faith in the word of God gives you the authority now when you have faith you don't have to beg God to do nothing for [Music] you can you say amen and when you have faith amen you don't have to beg the beg the devil to leave you alone faith is the authority faith in God's word is the authority the only way that you would be disappointed in God's word is when you ain't got faith in it but I guarantee you a man that has faith in God's word will never be disappointed amen because Faith brings results do you believe that see so then you you you can name any any devil of hell you can name any situation any circumstance and faith in the word of God is the only answer there is not all kinds of answers that fit for every you know that that well I need an answer for this and I need an answer for this and I need an answer for this no there's one answer to every problem and that is the word of God if you'll just believe it can you say amen amen you could be lacking and and in need of physical uh uh uh uh having a physical need you you could have a financial need you could have a spiritual need you could have whatever need that you want and one answer is faith in God God's word and all things are possible to them that believe can you say amen and it's true see so you you remember the blind man who cried out to Jesus and and and stopped uh uh uh Jesus stopped and told his disciples go get that man and bring him here well you know the the the the prophet said that Jesus never heard that man's cry for help it was a throne of people and there was some that was cursing him and there was some that was blessing him and there was some that was rejoicing and there was some that was that was complaining and and and and and uh uh you know uh brother raham said there's some of them booing and some of them cheering and and all these things and and so there was no way that Jesus could ever hear that Blind Man's cry amen for help but he said it was the faith of that blind man that stopped Jesus in his tracks ain't that right now you you think of that you may be around all kinds of nonsense and a lot of noise and a lot of things that are going on but there's one thing that'll get God's attention amen for you and that's Faith you got to have faith can you say amen that's right see and Jesus told the man thy faith Faith have saved thee Amen brother BR said you know look at it Jesus didn't say well I've healed thee so go on your way he said thy faith hath made thee whole thy faith has healed thee see so so here brother brandom says the man had enough Faith to in God to pull out of Jesus Christ or to stop him in his march to Calvary with the burdens of all human beings every death that ever died in the world or ever would rested upon his decision at Calvary and those things oppressing in his mind and leading in front of a multitude them mocking and making fun of him amen and everything and the priest hollering at him and sparring with him and and him walking right on down that same road that Elijah and Elisha come down together with their arms around one another the same road that Joshua led the children of Israel years before up them old Stones there as they marched around Jericho and the shouted the walls fell that same road Jesus Christ the son of God going to Calvary immediately to be crucified and the faith of that blind beggar stopped him in his tracks and he turned around and said what would I do for you can you say man and he said that I might receive my sight and Jesus said thy faith is sufficient amen thy faith is sufficient amen whatever you're needing your faith is sufficient can you say Amen the Lord faith is sufficient now you know brother brandom's goes on to tell us that the Man's eyes didn't come open all at once amen but as he went believing everybody say as he went believing as he went believing what Jesus said and praising God his eyes came open that's right see so then then there is nothing that can affect man more than the word of God if it is believed and and this is why man must live only by the word of God Amen I think of and we're very well familiar with the scripture here in Matthew 8:5 and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lith at home sick of py the py grievously tormented and Jesus Sith unto him I will come and heal him and the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should us come under my roof but just speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority this man recognized the authority that Jesus had I'm a man under Authority and and having soldiers unto me and I say to this man go and he goeth to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it and when Jesus heard it he marveled and said unto the unto them that followed verily I say unto you you I have not found so great a Faith No not in Israel I'll tell you why because it was not meant for the Jews it was meant for the Gentile that kind of Faith was meant to the Gentile just speak the word can you say amen that's exactly right and here you go in the 13th verse and Jesus said to the Ser Centurion go thy way and as thou Hast believed it what are you believing for as thou Hast believed so be it undone unto thee and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour amen you know today we we speak of uh speed just thinking of speed and and in terms of that and miles per hour and you know there's 200 miles an hour it's hard to believe that we could go there but we even go further than that and faster than that you know 10,000 M an hour and and all of that and that's that's terrific speed but when it comes to Eternity you know we we can't even fathom the the the type of speed that that that that is in that Rim you know and and uh we we just can't and and you know it's just like after Jesus had been glorified and received a glorified body he was raised from the dead and he ascended up into heaven to the Father the prophet said it wasn't just but few seconds just a few seconds that he had returned turned back amen and uh back to Earth amen and showing himself see amen and the prophet said he come with such terrific speed till he come right through a wall and the wall never moved and yet he stood there and ate fish and bread with his disciples but notice the point of this is he the prophet said he can come all the way from glory to your heart as quick as you can think about him now think of that he's not so far away from you amen just as quick as you can think about him he'll show up can you say amen that's right and as quick as you can confess wrong he can run the devil out and bring himself in just as fast as you can have enough Faith to believe it can you say Amen this ain't an all day process this ain't a hundred-year process God is right here the moment you can have faith for it and believe it he'll show up on the scene he's here to walk with you he's here to to to to protect you he's here to give you every need that you have amen that's awes God ain't using vehicles to get it down to you FedEx and UPS aren't you glad for that he can come in a moment's time just a moment you you you you you anchor your heart in that word and believe it he shows up glory to his name what makes the word of God so powerful I think this is as far as I know you never hear this in anywhere outside the message and it's because what makes the word powerful is that God is the word brother brandom laid that in there so much for us he is the word everybody say God is the word God is the word and and and he is manifested in and through his word ain't that right don't don't ignore the word of God and expect to walk with God it's the selfsame thing ain't that right and God only moves through his word so the prophet said if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word I don't care if you receive the doctor's report or not but don't you take this gospel don't take the word of God and treat it like a doctor's report amen if you want deity in your midst then receive that word hear that word take that word and receive it and welcome it and don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that [Applause] word can you say Amen some might take you know talk you out of getting a shot a flu shot and they might talk you out of doing this and they may talk you out of doing that but don't you let anyone come between you and this world you see to see him in action you must believe his word to see God in action you must believe his word if you want God if you want deity in your midst you've got to believe his word welcome that word Lord can you say amen hallelujah see so you will not see him if you are believing in anything outside the word of God now this is why again this is why it's so important amen uh for the seven the angel to come and reveal the mysteries of God to tie up the Loose Ends amen God was making a way to come to you reveal himself can you say Amen see so then then we understand that the seventh angel had to be a prophet Vindicated not just because he said he's a prophet right many people got this idea that they're the prophet oh my that God would vindicate this man the seventh angel had to be a Vindicated Prophet ain't that right and and he had to be a prophet because the word of the Lord only becomes to a prophet see a theologian could not tie up them lucians can you say Amen no no just no preacher amen could tie up them lucans see we we've had theologians we've had commentators all throughout the ages and they've only made a mess out of things can you say Amen that that's exactly right see so so then we've had men come on the seen who are very well vered in the Bible and very educated men amen that that that that they they could out talk us any day with this Bible amen but it didn't mean a thing amen it took a prophet and that Prophet had to be the sth angel Amen to reveal the mystery of this Bible to us and reveal tie up the Loose Ends can you say amen that's right see amen see so then the the the the only thing that theologians and commentators and whoever else and and and no doubt they were they were well-meaning in what they were doing but they've only made a mess out of things they've only made a mess out of the church they've only made a mess out and they're still making messes out of the church can you say Amen they're confusing the people right come on now that's exactly right to where the people don't know what to believe they don't know who to Anchor their faith in it's true and it's it happens even in the messag amen brother Bram said it's it's been always each time a group of leaders that gets the people all mixed up it's not so much the people it's the leaders that get them mixed up see so people's had enough Faith to say yes Jesus that was the son of God he's gone way away see and we can see enough to believe salvation but you can't believe all of it and they sto short see the church has been stopping short too long right there you go can you say Amen every time Through the Ages that God would try to bring the church further and show it more truth they would stop right there become some group of leaders of men amen would get the people all tangled up in such a mess that they couldn't even believe and you say Amen if they would have stayed with the the truth then then people of this age would believe that God sent a prophet they would believe in Malachi 4 but it's the preachers it's the leaders amen that's tell that tells the people there's no such thing as such that's right they would believe in miracles they would believe in signs and wonders of of scriptural signs and wonders but it's the leaders that have got the people all messed up can you say amen and they stopped short the church has been stopping short amen but now notice now amen they've done exactly what king uh joash did in the Old Testament amen remember that uh 2 Kings 13:14 now Elisha was Fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and joash uh uh um the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said oh my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and Elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows and he said to the king of Israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and Elisha put his hand hands upon the king's hands and he said open the window Eastward then he opened it and Elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the Lord now notice the promise the promise then the the uh he said the arrow of the Lord's deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria for Thou shalt Smite the syrians in aec uh uh till thou Hast consumed them and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said to the king king of Israel Smite upon the ground and he smoked Thrice three times he only smoked three times and he stayed back ain't that right just the way the church has been doing just cutting short of it all and the man of God was wroth amen angry with him and he said thou should have smitten five or six times then had us thou submit Syria till thou had us consumed it whereas now Thou shalt Smite is Syria but Thrice hello church amen he had the word of God he should have acted upon the word of God he already was saying that he would he would consume it why didn't he act upon it he always stopped short of it amen the prophet said that's it the church has been striking short of what God revealed to them see God has revealed to us something in a great way in this age amen see and striking short they only struck a couple times Well we can be free from sin well that's good and we can have joy that's good but why don't we strike for Divine Healing why don't we strike for the power of God why don't we restrike strike to the restoration of the gifts why don't we strike that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever why would we be satisfied with the god of history in our own lives amen why don't we strike until he's the same yesterday today and forever in our life in my life I know what a prophet done I know what God done in in him but that promise is for me too he is the same yesterday today and forever we need a church with faith Amen to keep pressing keep striking don't stop short of it yes sir amen the prophets at see Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever wow God's got his hand rested on ours how many believe God's got his hand rested upon ours amen just like Elijah rested his hand upon that King God's hand is resting Upon Our hand his hand of Mercy is upon us amen yes sir he said let's win the victory over sin and everything that Jesus died to free us from see the church is striking short they just made a little strike but it don't do no good everybody say it don't do no good I'm going to tell you church you can say well I just believe in a prophet it ain't going to do you good this day to just believe in God sent a prophet oh B I believe in Oneness it ain't going to do you any good amen what what's the point of believing in Oneness if you're going to stop short of everything else can you say amen he said it doesn't do any good like we strike just one time two times let's keep striking Calvary spelled Freedom everybody say Calvary spelled Freedom Calvary spelled your inheritance Calvary spelled everything that you have need of Cal resp spells it for you amen don't you sit and wait for God to do something you act up it now every promise in the book is [Music] yours Hallelujah he said yes sir Calvary don't strike short everything the Bible says say it with him see that's right say it with him if God said it say it with him if he said by my stripes you're heal say it with him don't look at and say well I just don't know amen say it with him that's how you strike back that's how you keep striking if he said Revival is yours if we're in a bride's Revival and you're in the part of that bride say it with him Hallelujah can you say Amen we're in a day age of adoption amen don't sit back there and say who is me I just don't know say it with him amen keep striking that's right I hope it's all right sure it is amen everything the Bible says say it with him he said how do you do it the Prophet The Seer had his hand upon him and as long as Christ has got his hand on you in the baptism of the Holy Spirit keep striking for God is with you Hallelujah glory to God sir Hallelujah we shouldn't be a defeated people we shouldn't be a sin bound people we shouldn't be a lukewarm lotsy of people can you say amen that's right see see someone striking short in their life they're stopping short and victory is stopping in their life they're stopping short and Satan is coming open them amen and they're now starting to act like leoa church members come on church that's right to where it seemed like the bride is just and that even the the thought of Bride and the preaching of the bride of Christ it just seem like it's such a myth to us don't let it be a myth to you keep striking keep striking yes sir people used to be on fire for God they used to not join the gossip sessions they used to be involved in the things of God now their faith is limited they sat on a Pew half asleep anymore like nothing's moving anymore little old thing comes their way and they just don't know what to do for you know what they start trouble they start this they start that they just and and you think what happened they used to have the fire they used to be the Amen on zelus for God now they're part of the division group and they're part of this and they're part of the backsliders oh my what is it they struck short that's right they stop short can you say Amen there is no reason to stop short when you got a prophet telling you keep striking there is no reason to stop short when you got a prophet telling you you can make it you will be Victorious you will be an overcomer that's what that Prophet told that King he should have listened to that Prophet amen come on that's right Lord but what happens they limit their faith but if you look God is calling his elect to a complete and total Victory Deliverance amen Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now notice what the prophet says now this Prophet this Prophet everybody say this Prophet what prophet the prophet of Malachi 4 there is no other Prophet that's going to do this to you that's right I don't care if there's a billion prophets rise on the scene there's only one Prophet Elijah the prophet that is going to restore us back and the prophet said this Prophet will restore the faith of the people back to the B can you say Amen the Lord Prophet never told us to put our faith in gifts as though they're the absolute Prophet never told us to put our faith Amen in some uh Fang dangle thing as though it's the thing of the answer he would take us back to the word of God the Bible restore our faith back and his message is not just any message that has come along but it is the the end time message do you believe that amen the prophet of Malachi 4 has a message and it is the end time message for an end time people and the prophet says always end time message meets end time conditions all the way through the scriptures and it will have to do at this time a call back to the original word how is his message going to meet end time conditions by calling us back to the original word this is the time for Rapture this is the time for a body change this is the time for adoption this is the time amen every promise in the book amen concern in this bride is to be made flesh in this bride has got to meet end time conditions can you say amen amen yes sir you couldn't come into adoption messed up in your mind and modled up with the with the word of God that's right exactly can't can't can't have a Rapture and your mind's all muddled up about this Bible that's right brother can you say amen he come to bring us back to the original word well but the Greek says that I don't care what the Greek says the prophet said it Hallelujah he can disagree with the Greek I don't care I believe him I believe him over Greek I believe him over Hebrew I believe him over every smartest man his message was to call us back to the word of God do you believe it yes sir prise the Lord and we can know if this Prophet that is to come is the real one sent from God or not brother Braham said how will you know that how can you know if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul so w with all these naysayers that says well brother Bram didn't know the Bible brother Bram didn't he just using his own opinions and and all that nonsense you know what that means they don't believe that he was Malachi 4 they don't believe it they're make Believers can you say amen for a prophet would tell us that this prophet of Malachi 4 will not deviate from the word of God he'll be in that word as Paul was in the word that's right he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one ioda in that last age when there will be many everybody say many many false prophets appearing now he didn't say there would be a many elijas no right he didn't say behold I'll send you a bunch of Elijah the prophets come on now but he did say there will be many false prophets yes amen amen God promised one Prophet One messenger and he told us what his message would be and that is to restore the faith take us back to the original word can you say amen he says see in that last stage when there will be many false prophets appearing watch and we see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you'll be lost but when that last day Prophet comes on the scene if he is truly that Prophet he'll be crying out get back to the word or you're lost get back to the word or you're lost can you say Amen God we need faith in the word of God Amen we're looking at the end times we're looking at the things we ain't got time to play around we got to get serious about this thing do you believe it Hallelujah see he won't build up on a private Revelation or an interpretation but on the word right amen amen so others who are not true prophets will build upon their private Revelation or interpretation now there is no doubt in my minded I'm sure it's yours as well can can you give me some Bas on this someone's messed with that somehow but there is no doubt in my mind that brother Brandon was the prophet of Malachi 4 he was also the messenger of Revelations 10:7 there is no doubt in my mind that the last part of his ministry was that of the open book that was brought down by the mighty angel of Revelations 10:1 do you believe that brother brandom talks about it and how he tells of going up into the canyon sabinaa Canyon I believe and and he's up there and and early early early in the morning and and he's got his hands raised he's asking God what what all this constellation of seven angels was about and and all that and he says he said it must have been a vision or whatever but he said all of a sudden he felt something in his hand and he looked and it was a sword y'all remember that I'm not going to go into the whole story you all know it well enough but the the sword glistened and he described the Ivory and all of that about that sword and a voice and he said I was afraid of knives I'm scared and but there was a voice that said don't be scared don't be afraid this is the king sword right and he thought well if it said a king sword then that might have been different but he said but this is the king sword a ain't that right and he said there's only one the king and that's God and his sword is this sharp is this sharper than two edges sword ain't that right and and so he goes on down about this sword he says see see he says there's one thing that I understand uh uh about it is the principle of do he said well here it is he said I don't understand one word of it but one principle of dueling but the best of my understanding the knife striking AC cross and then finally the swords if they lock the enemy and you lock swords then it takes the strength everybody say it takes the strength of the man dueling because his sword would be pointed at to my heart and mine to his and they're locked and as our knives striking each other then they strike see uh uh and then the swords come together and the one that can shove the other one down swords see the sword straight to the heart so it takes even though the sword be the word it takes the hand of strong faith strong faith can you say Amen oh yes sir takes the hand of strong Faith to hold it there to bring it to the heart of the enemy amen oh my amen so you you you know where we're getting at right the brides got the strong hand now brother Brandon had a strong hand of Faith every time he walked out in that Pulpit it was by his faith he knew God would honor his word he he always defeated every night he defeated the Devil by the word of God ain't that right now now notice uh this may be a little lengthy but brother Ram talks about the symphony and he talked about the Russian composer and uh the one who composed Peter and the Wolf and he said the symphony acts out on symbols and everything and and you you all heard him talk about it but he said anyone who knows the story that's reading it off of a paper and can hear that Symphony how it's acting that out the drama playing it out then they know every change see and they can look at it here and see the change but now see so what happens if the composer writes something and we find out it isn't just acted outright see well then we find out then that there is something that happens there is something lacking and we see them uh he who composed it has made it up wrote it out and then the symphony is playing it and hits a wrong note well there's something wrong the director gave the wrong motion right he said well that's what's the matter today my Lutheran Brethren Baptist Brethren Pentecostal Brethren all my brethren from all different denominations that's what it is you're trying to give a note that hit back in the days of Luther or Wesley and like that see when actually the music sheet here shows that it's another day we can't live in the light of Luther he was a reformer we appreciate his part but he's played that out we're over here at the back of the book now we can't play it out like that amen see he says the only way that you're ever going to be able to do it my brethren is this the Brethren of the world of the different parts of the world I might say there's only one way for that director to do he said he has to get in the same spirit that the composer was in then he's got it can you say Amen now I I have to tell you that the our Prophet did not come in a church Spirit he did not come in a world Spirit he did not come amen with the religious spirit he come in the spirit of the composer and when the church the symphony itself where the world is a watching for these signs and wonders when the church and the composer and the director they all get in the spirit of the composer then when they say the days of Miracles is past well it don't hit the right note but when it gets in the right swing of it and the right Spirit of it how are you going to do it until the spirit comes down of the composer can you say amen hallelujah you love him he says see then when you say the days of Miracles never pass the symphony Cries Out amen see when we hit and say Jesus Christ the same yesterday to every today and forever the symphony Cries Out amen you shall receive power after this the Holy Ghost has come upon you and the symphony Cries Out amen I got it ain't that right well there's no more guesswork about it the whole symphony is Right In harmony with the word aren't you glad for that aren't you glad for the mighty angel coming down oh hallelujah amen the composer himself amen the spirit of that composer amen has gotten upon the director and is upon the symphony amen yes sir the prophet and the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing yes sir amen they just believe the word see so so he said it's a magn magnificent thing the director the composer must be in the same spirit and so must the musicians be in the same Spirit to act it all out and the world is wondering what's going on see the communism they talk about and made me sick with it and all this inter in inte integration and everything else and segregation oh mercy such all this nonsense when the coming of the Lord is at hand there is something hitting wrong they're they're talking about this and talking about this and they're all talking about everything else but but what is God is doing it's because they don't believe the word they believe their Creeds they believe everything else but the word amen it's true he said see they're they're they're hitting something wrong and I'm afraid that the directors have gotten out of the spirit of of the composer but when when we get that composer spirit that original power of God that the the Bible said men of old was moved by the ghost to write this Bible you'll see them two Chinese pieces of paper will come together just like God's Bible and the believer will come together because they're both in the same Spirit they're both the same thing they dovetail right straight together and what we need today is directors that's right back to the word back and believe it just as it said then you see the God himself that's the unveiling can you say say amen amen oh do you love him amen now we know that there are two Spirits at work that's something we we know we wouldn't have known that if it wasn't for this message thank God for the message of the hour we wouldn't know what was happening all around the prophet said there's two Spirits at work today the Holy Spirit and the devil Spirit and the devil is working in deception and the people of the Earth are now right now and maybe they've already made their choice but he said they're making their choice now he said that years ago yeah they they're making their choice now notice the Holy Spirit he is here calling out a bride for Christ and and she as Ruth did makes her choice yes sir I'll go the word only I'll go that's that's the bridegroom that's what she's married to is the word amen can you say Amen I'll go yep and how is he calling out his bride he is doing it by vindicating his Word of Promise to her for this age showing that it is Christ amen so if the finger is supposed to move in this age the finger will move if the foot is supposed to move in this age the foot will move if the eye is to see in this age the eye will see see the spirit of God as it's growed into the full stature of God is the age that we're living in now see and the Holy Spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour the holy spirit is doing this so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos I hope you understand am you see why you got to believe it got to believe it yes sir the only way to be called out of this chaos that's right amen thank God but notice he said the devil's Unholy spirit is here calling his church by the error as usual by a perversion of the word of God like he did at the beginning and who's following it every deceived individual but the elect will not be deceived it ain't happening we're living in a generation as we get ready close but let me talk now that we're living in a generation of sign Seekers true and the the thing that has created this is thousands of sign workers the prophet said he said they know nothing about the true move of God and his word in the last days give them blood and oil and fleshly demonstrations on the platform and they'll support it whether it's God's word or not whether it's scriptural or not they don't care yeah because they're sign Seekers brother Bri said the only way you can tell who they are is give them a word test word test ain't that right speak the word and see what they have to say about it if they don't believe the word then they have no GC germ in them ain't that right I thought a saddening thing um you know uh about this Eclipse that happened Monday and how I I I I've wondered if um if the world has gone as crazy as they did this time as thinking this was a sign of some significance and and of of course there was so much confusion opinions and speculation as to what it was all about right everybody giving their opinion and idea saying it was you know the end of the world saying the Rapture you know asking if there was any churches to be open so they could go in and pray my goodness good you know could could you imagine God sending a sign like that and poor mortal man having to depend on that for his eternal destination and then God not give a clear answer to what it's about God doesn't do them things I'm not going to going to say that it didn't have any significance anything that happens I think is with significance that's right but there was no profit on the earth to give the interpretation of its significance that's right and it it had no meaning for the bride praise the Lord it it didn't let us know that we're at the end time it didn't let us know that the Rapture is about to take place uh it didn't draw us it wasn't there to draw us closer to God it wasn't there to get us more ready it wasn't there to give us more faith uh uh it it wasn't there you understand uh and and so whatever significance it might have been it it it wasn't there to give us rapturing Faith or anything like that because we know uh by the message of the hour and again this is where people just you know and it's a shame on message people that that's just it just shows how ignorant they are of the of the word of God and the lack of faith in the message of the hour but but there's only one sign that was promised of this generation that Jesus promised to give us and that was the sign of Jonas being raised from the belly of the well and that was the sign of the Resurrection there was one sign given to this generation that every person the whole world should have taken notice of and looked for that sign can you say Amen other signs yes there there was other things but one particular sign that that was was above everything one sign that would matter amen and it would it would determine men's Destiny was that one sign whether they rejected it or received it on now and that was the sign of the Messiah sign of Resurrection sign of the Messiah and we've seen that sign performed night after night after night after night after n seven times around the world and the sign that matter no one asks about it it was the son of man being revealed yes sir can you say amen and that one sign that Jesus plainly said would come and that he would send it and would be he himself being revealed and the world rejects it they'll take any other sign right right come on now brother brandham said what what do we have in this our day multitudes are working signs until we have a generation of sign Seekers that know little or nothing about the word or a true move of the spirit of God if they see blood oil and fire they are happy and it matters not what is in the word they'll support any sign even UNS scriptural ones can you say amen and the prophet said this is why you cannot claim that manifest ation is the evidence of being Holy Ghost filled can you say amen he said we know that true manifestation is the evidence of the Holy Ghost doing Mighty acts but it is not the evidence of a man being filled with the spirit even if that individual has abundance of manifestations he said the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of Our Lord it is receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live Jesus never did stress the importance of works as he did the word he knew that if the people got to the word The Works will follow can you say Amen you love the Lord he says here that Satan will try to deceive the Bride of this last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself through Creeds or just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her yeah sad message people go that way just as much but God never placed signs ahead of the word that's right God never plac signs ahead of the word amen can you say amen God never plac signs of ahead if this message ain't going to draw you close some in Eclipse ain't going to draw you close if this message ain't going to wake you up the eclipse ain't going to do it and no other sign is going to do it it's the Awakening of the bride what is it the message of the [Music] hour taking her back to the original word you love him I hope I'm making sense to you God never plac signs ahead of the word follow signs follow the word that's right as when Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord when she did as the word said the proper sign came come to the word first and then watch the miracle can you say amen and church put the word first we've got the word we're not looking for another Prophet to come we're not looking for the seventh seal to be open we're not we're not looking for anything we've got it thank Jes and even if there were something to come take what you got you got enough to create worlds you got enough for rapturing Faith you got enough to take a body change and be caught up to meet the Lord in the air can you say Amen brother brandham says if the as the musicians will come he said I believe we're now at the time that the word should have preeminence amen I believe we're now at the time where the word should have preeminence personalities have had the preeminence the world has had preeminence our own ideas have had preeminence long enough the word must have preeminence I believe that the time to lay aside our Creeds and our thoughts and come back to the word is now he said Mary never waited for anything else she got the word of God in her heart and she was going around testifying that she was going to have a baby before she had any evidence of it or not can you say Amen do you see that's where we're at right now you say well I don't feel good I I I don't I don't I don't feel saved you don't need to feel saved amen well I don't feel healed I I still got all the symptoms you'll have symptoms as long as you keep grapping about it and magnifying that thing oh I'm just going to have a nervous breakdown well then go ahead and have one just have it and don't be surprised that you did you're the one that brought it on you confessed it we've got the word of God to stop that thing can you say Amen you ain't supposed to go by feelings well if I could just have someone to prophesy on me I know I'll be saved forget it you got the word Mary how disappointing would it been if God would have told Mary Mary this does this this this this and then she say Beat It unto me according to my word and then she goes and starts finding someone to prophesy over her and have a vision I got to really know if this is of God or not oh sir have you had a vision of me me pregnant or me having a having having the Christ child it didn't matter if he had a vision or not the angel said it and so is it that the angel has come to this bride in this day and has gave us the word of God through the prophit of the hour amen can you say Amen she didn't need anything else she didn't look for anything else she was satisfied Hall with the word of God thank can you say Amen oh we could go on and on but I hope we've helped you somehow hallelujah hallelujah can you lift your hands unto the Lord and just worship him oh how thankful we are for the revealed word of God it can't be made more clear to us God can't do anymore for us he's Vindicated it over and over and over now we must believe believe it take God at his word as Mary did and believe it with all of our soul our heart our mind everything that's within us and go confessing it it's done it's over it's God has provided can you say amen hallelujah hallelujah what song In The Name Of The Lord oh we've got the power in the name of Jesus we've got the

hallelujah thank the Lord for that oh sing it once again oh it's already done hallelujah it's already done praise the Lord the Battle Is Over Victory is one it's already done I want to read a couple quotes brother brandom said all of you in here that's saved tonight you just get in your head that you're not saved and go around saying I'm not saved no more he said then you're not saved he said that's a big word for a Baptist isn't it but that's true he said your backslid whenever you do that but here's a a a a word and we know it but I I want to just encourage you with that brother brandham talking about how that you know he he said here he said um uh he talking about Christ he says Christ took all the legalism upon himself he took the law upon himself and the law nailed him to the cross of what we must do and must not do and must do and must not do he said to today we don't treat the sinner like Paul did the Philippian jeller when he asked what must I do to be saved he said we tell them what they must quit doing he said but he didn't ask what he must quit doing he asked what he must what must I do to be saved and Paul told him believe everybody say believe on the Lord Jesus Christ not come join our congregation and stand up before the church and say this and we'll sprinkle you or immerse you or whatever you want to do our way he said and if you're not in our church well then he said no that wasn't it he said just believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house everybody say my house my house shall be saved is that not a promise then all you're required to do is to believe it he said see if you can believe for yourself then you can believe everybody say say I can believe for your house also have enough faith in God to believe for yourself then believe for your children also and that same faith will save your children that saved you if you just keep praying God will answer prayer don't you worry hello a me what he telling us don't you worry see he said just ask him and believe it and get it anchored in your heart and just keep moving on that's the way it's done aren't you glad for that oh lift your hands unto the Lord hallelujah aren't you glad that God sent a prophet to tell us how to do these things claim your children claim if you've got the faith for yourself claim them and just keep moving on keep moving on keep praising God that's the way it's done ain't that right one more he said now Paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word priest actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword it went to the consciences of men like a surgeon's knife and it cut out the diseases and set captives free everywhere those early Believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and God confirmed that word with signs following the sick were healed Devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action and that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last age it is here stronger everybody say stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold to the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday God's going to give you you the kingdom Hallelujah aren't you glad for that bless the name of the Lord this is not a hype up this is not something to get you all hyped up and a a myth mythical mythology or what this is thus sayith the Lord that has given you if you can just believe him amen praise the Lord don't worry about it just believe let your faith go and just believe and rest God going to take care of it all the word that you've been receiving in your heart that you've been welcoming and let it fill your mouth don't you say negative things about the situation let the word of God come from your mouth it is the it is greater in this age in this bride than ever before that's right then you say Amen now you think of that praise God if Jesus could say if the serpent if that if that Centurion could recognize the word that Jesus Jesus had and say speak the word and that word is even greater than it ever has been in the true bride what about you speaking the word can you say

right we're going home this this is the thing that God has given us he he can't give you anything else but the word don't let the prophet become common to you don't let the revealed word become common to you don't let the devil run all over you and tell you you're Misfit take God's word and lay claim to it and watch God come into action for you do you believe he's the same yesterday today and forever I believe that God bless you is our prayer amen let's sing it again it's already done hallelujah it's already [Music] [Applause] [Music] done now you know this is a word Revival there ain't no

praise the Lord the Battle Is Over Victory is won it's already done now as they just play softly let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer as we dismiss father as we have heard the word of God

eternal and father you've given it in our hands to defeat any devil of hell you showed it father yes I I heard your Prophet today and how he said that you could have when when Satan came to you at that hour of Temptation that you had such power within you that you could have sent him back to hell where he came from but you didn't you simply use the word to show that the weakest Christian could defeat the Devil anywhere anytime under any situation thank you Father for showing us thank you for showing the power of your word to us father now I pray that you would Bless the people father I know there are those that are sick here they're suffering in their bodies father I I just pray that the faith would just anchor in them Lord and that they can just walk and just confess their healing those
