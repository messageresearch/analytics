[8:50] I pray that you had healed them

[8:57] have and what is ailing them
[9:00] Lord we don't take these things lightly
[9:03] Lord we've seen
[9:05] people just uh their lives end at a
[9:09] simple headache or
[9:11] whatever Lord but father we're we're
[9:14] looking to you
[9:16] that you would reach down your hand and
[9:18] just touch them
[9:20] and Satan we just command you to uh
[9:25] leave their bodies
[9:27] Lord and that they can just be well
[9:31] today
[9:32] father we thank you for for hearing our
[9:35] prayer
[9:36] and I pray father that you would be with
[9:38] us this morning in this part of the
[9:41] service God uh just Lord I'm nothing
[9:46] without you and we had asked that you
[9:49] had anoint the lips of clay and anoint
[9:52] the ears and hearts of your people to
[9:54] receive father may it all be done in thy
[9:58] name
[9:58] Lord we just love you give you glory and
[10:02] honor in Jesus Christ's name
[10:06] amen and amen praise the Lord
[10:10] of the book of Ephesians the first
[10:12] chapter and
[10:18] start at the 15th verse is wherefore I
[10:21] also after I heard of your faith in the
[10:23] Lord Jesus
[10:25] and love unto all the saints cease not
[10:28] to give thanks for you making mention of
[10:31] you in my prayers
[10:33] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[10:36] the father of Glory may give unto you
[10:39] the spirit of wisdom
[10:41] and Revelation in the knowledge of him
[10:45] now think of that they give you this is
[10:48] the prayer that Paul would have the
[10:50] burden
[10:52] is that the Lord would give you the
[10:54] spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the
[10:57] knowledge of him
[10:59] the eyes of your understanding been
[11:02] enlightened that you may know what is
[11:05] the hope of his calling
[11:07] and what the riches of the glory of his
[11:10] inheritance
[11:12] in the Saints
[11:14] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[11:17] his power to us word who believe
[11:20] according to the working of his mighty
[11:23] power
[11:24] amen you can have your seats this
[11:27] morning
[11:32] what a prayer that Paul would pray
[11:37] and that was just that was his burden
[11:40] and and
[11:43] I think that's any true man of God's
[11:47] burden
[11:49] is that the people's eyes would be
[11:52] enlightened and the Lord would give
[11:55] give us the spirit of wisdom and
[11:58] Revelation and the knowledge of him
[12:01] and you can certainly feel the passion
[12:03] the burden that brother Branham had
[12:06] as he is
[12:08] laying out the word and opening the
[12:13] Mysteries to us
[12:15] today I I'm going to continue on the
[12:19] Supernatural and that would be my title
[12:23] and
[12:25] we know that again God is a supernatural
[12:29] being that's that's what he is he is
[12:31] unseen in all of his works
[12:34] are Supernatural his presence is
[12:37] Supernatural
[12:39] everything he does is Supernatural and I
[12:42] I think this is the something that
[12:47] more than just being taught I I pray
[12:50] that it can really be down in our soul
[12:55] because uh if we're going to walk with
[12:58] God it it must you walk with the
[13:02] supernatural
[13:03] that means the Unseen is more real to
[13:06] you
[13:07] than the natural would be or what is
[13:10] seen
[13:11] and so wherever the Lord is the
[13:16] supernatural takes place brother Brown
[13:18] said wherever a supernatural being is
[13:21] he'll do Supernatural signs because the
[13:25] Supernatural is in him and he said you
[13:28] just can't get out of it
[13:31] you just can't get out of it so he says
[13:34] how can you stand in the face of wind
[13:36] without having wind blowing how can you
[13:39] get in water without being wet water's
[13:41] wet that's the chemical of it it's wet
[13:44] and so when you're when you get in water
[13:47] you're going to get wet right
[13:49] and so when you get in the presence of
[13:52] God the supernatural then there's going
[13:55] to be Supernatural signs and
[13:58] Supernatural workings of a supernatural
[14:01] God
[14:02] ain't that right and and so there's only
[14:06] one Supernatural God right amen we're
[14:09] not uh uh you know we're not serving
[14:13] three four five whatever uh the Bible
[14:16] says in the beginning was God in the
[14:20] beginning God created the heavens and
[14:23] earth ain't that right Deuteronomy 6 4
[14:26] says Hear o Israel the Lord our God is
[14:30] one Lord he's one and thou shalt love
[14:34] the Lord thy God with all thine heart
[14:38] with all thy soul with all thy might and
[14:42] so there's always been one true lord
[14:45] always being one God right and as we
[14:49] have talked last Sunday that God has
[14:52] hidden himself in different forms
[14:56] but he's always been the same God he has
[15:00] never changed and and so the the message
[15:03] of the hour has enabled us to look back
[15:07] beyond the beginning and see what God
[15:10] was before there ever was the beginning
[15:13] and how he's unfolded himself all the
[15:16] way up to this age and what other
[15:19] message can give that to you there there
[15:22] there's no other message that's been
[15:24] able to describe God from the beginning
[15:28] and all the way up to this age and and
[15:32] so John 1 1 very familiar and and very
[15:37] prominent in understanding God and that
[15:40] is in the beginning was the word and the
[15:44] Word was with God and the word was God
[15:48] and and so but as the prophet would tell
[15:52] us before it became a word it was a
[15:56] thought ain't that right it was the
[15:58] thoughts of God and so the word is the
[16:02] thoughts of God expressed God thought it
[16:06] then he spoke it and it became word
[16:09] ain't that right well so then John tells
[16:13] us that the word is God the word is God
[16:19] and so then the prophet would tell us
[16:22] see the whole thing is God unfolding
[16:26] himself in his attributes so the Eternal
[16:32] thoughts of God was about himself can
[16:36] you say Amen
[16:37] unfolding himself in his attributes and
[16:42] of course we are his what attributes and
[16:46] then God being made material tangible
[16:51] ain't that right amen so God unfolding
[16:55] himself in his attributes of course he's
[16:59] he's love he's he's healer Savior and
[17:02] God unfolding himself in these things
[17:04] but but we were part of them thoughts
[17:07] too amen because God had to have a body
[17:11] ain't that right amen and you know good
[17:14] and well as we know that he's not just
[17:17] pouring himself just to anybody
[17:19] it's his attributes it's his thoughts
[17:23] you either was in his thoughts in the
[17:25] beginning or you're not ain't that right
[17:27] so we are his thoughts today we are his
[17:31] thoughts made manifest it's what God
[17:34] wanted to be God wanted to be tangible
[17:39] ain't that right God wanted to be
[17:42] tangible so he so so who who did he have
[17:45] he had the lamb he had Jesus Christ
[17:47] ain't that right but we Jesus Christ
[17:50] wasn't the only only thought that he had
[17:53] in his mind we were in his thoughts as
[17:56] well ain't that right Jesus was in his
[18:00] thoughts as Redeemer we were in his
[18:02] thoughts as redeemed ain't that right so
[18:06] it's God unfolding himself in his
[18:09] attributes and then God being made
[18:12] material tangible that we can talk to
[18:16] speak with in his whole church body and
[18:19] everything ain't that right well Jesus
[18:22] God uh he was the tabernacle a man that
[18:26] God dwelt in ain't that right that human
[18:29] body God was in his human body and yet
[18:31] Jesus had to pray and and and brother
[18:34] Brandon says yes he had to pray All
[18:36] Flesh has to pray that's what the Bible
[18:37] says amen so who was he talking to he
[18:40] was praying to the God within him
[18:44] ain't that right
[18:46] he's praying not to God up in heaven he
[18:48] was praying to the god in him
[18:51] so so then another place brother Brown
[18:54] says in him was thoughts in God was
[18:57] thought he wanted to become material
[19:02] and what did he do then he spoke a word
[19:05] and the Word was materialized that's the
[19:08] whole picture from Genesis to Revelation
[19:11] ain't that right what's the picture he
[19:14] wants to become tangible
[19:17] he wants to become visible he he he
[19:21] wants to become material and so the word
[19:25] that was spoken a man from Genesis to
[19:28] Revelation gives us the whole picture of
[19:30] it God change it in forms and and and
[19:33] and these things into where we are today
[19:35] so so it's hell Elohim uh uh
[19:40] materializing so that he can be touched
[19:43] he can be felt and and these things so
[19:47] then that was the word in the beginning
[19:49] and the word became flesh
[19:54] the word became flesh ain't that right
[19:56] see so God had already said through the
[20:00] prophet Isaiah that his word would not
[20:02] return unto him void but that it would
[20:04] accomplish that which he sent it to do
[20:07] and it would perform amen and and
[20:10] prosper so when the word came to David
[20:13] it was God in David when the word come
[20:16] to Isaiah it was God in Isaiah do you
[20:20] believe that amen see God was showing
[20:23] what he was after the word coming Amen
[20:26] to to uh Moses that was God coming in
[20:30] Moses ain't that right amen the word
[20:33] coming to Joseph it was God in Joseph
[20:36] not God sending his word amen but God
[20:40] coming Amen in and and and and that's
[20:43] why brother Brandon would say if you
[20:45] can't see Christ in every scripture then
[20:47] go read it again because it was Christ
[20:49] and every one of them men it was Christ
[20:52] ain't that right there their own lives
[20:55] you know when they were man they were
[20:57] men amen and we can see that they were
[21:00] men look at all the mistakes they made
[21:01] but when they were anointed they were
[21:04] God they're but they're flesh their own
[21:08] lives testified of God ain't that right
[21:10] testified of Jesus Christ
[21:13] ain't that right David did David
[21:16] testified of Jesus Christ yet yet as a
[21:20] man when he was man look at all the
[21:22] failures but when that anointing Came
[21:25] Upon him
[21:26] God would testify through his life of
[21:29] what he wanted
[21:33] Joseph and Moses and all them men
[21:38] see so the word came to all the prophets
[21:41] and it was God doing the speaking and
[21:44] the acting
[21:46] in them men
[21:48] ain't that right so the word is God
[21:51] but it never said that the word became
[21:55] flesh
[21:57] until Jesus Christ came
[22:01] ain't that right
[22:03] the word never became flesh until Jesus
[22:07] Christ came
[22:08] because everything that was in David was
[22:11] in Christ
[22:12] everything all the god that anointed and
[22:16] came into Joseph was in Christ
[22:19] everything that they talked about their
[22:21] lives portrayed it was in Christ
[22:24] ain't that right amen it was Christ and
[22:28] it all so all that God was he poured
[22:32] into Christ
[22:34] the god in David was in Christ the god
[22:36] in Moses was in Christ the God and all
[22:40] of them men and and and they they were
[22:42] in Christ
[22:43] last Sunday we talked about God hiding
[22:46] behind skin
[22:48] and he was veiled uh in the Old
[22:50] Testament uh behind the badger skin and
[22:55] and by faith the people knew that he was
[22:58] in there and they would approach uh
[23:01] um uh the the Tabernacle by faith but
[23:05] then he was veiled in another skin
[23:09] God would Veil himself in another skin
[23:12] which is the body of Jesus Christ
[23:15] and God created his own body and poured
[23:18] himself into it and became human brother
[23:22] Branham said God occupied a three-room
[23:25] house
[23:26] bodies sow and spirit of the Lord Jesus
[23:29] Christ
[23:30] amen and he came notice he came to take
[23:35] on himself
[23:37] the full form of man
[23:40] ain't that right
[23:42] the full form of man to redeem the full
[23:45] form of man back to God
[23:49] that's why he come in flesh and in Soul
[23:54] he come the full form of man become That
[23:58] Body Soul spirit that he might redeem
[24:02] the full form of man
[24:05] oh my
[24:07] God so we we find that
[24:10] First Timothy 3 16 it says and without
[24:14] controversy great is the mystery of
[24:17] godliness
[24:18] God was manifesting flesh
[24:21] you realize that's still a mystery
[24:25] it's still a mystery today
[24:29] the mystery of godliness
[24:32] Colossians 2 9 in him dwelleth all the
[24:36] fullness of the godhead bodily
[24:39] people
[24:41] people have tried for years and they're
[24:43] still trying to separate the name of
[24:47] Jesus Christ from God
[24:49] but it is impossible to do it because
[24:51] Jesus was God now I want you to bear
[24:54] with me listen to me now
[24:56] John 5 43 says I come in my father's
[25:00] name that's what Jesus said I come in my
[25:03] father's name so the name of the father
[25:06] is Jesus Christ
[25:10] ain't that right amen for the father was
[25:14] in him
[25:15] remember Jesus said as I sin as the
[25:18] father has sent me so sin are you
[25:21] and and the prophet would ask how did
[25:23] the father send him he went with him
[25:27] even in him
[25:29] and as the father sent him so he sends
[25:32] you
[25:34] can you say Amen
[25:35] so so Jesus bore the father's name
[25:40] because God was in him
[25:46] John 1 18 no man has seen God at any
[25:50] time the only begotten son which is in
[25:53] the bosom of the father he hath declared
[25:56] him
[25:57] we've we've read these John 14 8 Philip
[26:00] saith unto him Lord show us the father
[26:02] and it sufficeth us and Jesus said unto
[26:06] him have I been so long time with you
[26:09] and yet thou has not known me
[26:12] and Philip say me Philip he that has
[26:16] seen me has seen the father
[26:18] I'll sayest thou then show us the father
[26:20] believeth thou not that I am in the
[26:23] father and the father in me the words
[26:25] that I speak unto you I speak not of
[26:27] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[26:29] me he doeth the works
[26:32] John 10 30. Jesus says I and my father
[26:36] are one
[26:39] can you say Amen so what God had in his
[26:43] mind in the beginning remember brother
[26:46] I'm talking about Michelangelo and the
[26:48] sculptor and what he had in his mind
[26:51] Jesus was that masterpiece
[26:55] ain't that right God was able to become
[26:58] tangible
[27:02] and what happened the supernatural took
[27:04] place
[27:05] amen
[27:08] in Hebrews 10 20 Paul tells us that the
[27:12] Flesh of Jesus was the Veil
[27:15] now throughout the Bible God has had
[27:18] many titles
[27:20] he is called our righteousness
[27:23] our peace
[27:25] ever present he is called father he is
[27:28] called son he is called the Holy Ghost
[27:32] he is called the I am
[27:35] he was called the Jehovah
[27:38] and the prophet you know he someone had
[27:42] asked him about it about the the names
[27:45] of God and and brother Brown said the
[27:48] names of God has been changed all the
[27:50] way through
[27:51] the Old Testament
[27:55] until it came to Jesus Christ
[28:01] ain't that right
[28:02] that's right and these titles that has
[28:06] been given him depict what he is to
[28:10] Mankind and what he can do
[28:13] he is peace
[28:15] but he is Supernatural peace
[28:18] because God is Supernatural
[28:21] he is Joy but he is a supernatural Joy
[28:25] ain't that right
[28:27] that's right see and and and even in
[28:30] that Supernatural piece look at what the
[28:32] world calls peace and they're crying out
[28:35] for peace yet the peace that they get
[28:37] doesn't quelch the the turmoil it
[28:41] doesn't stop anything but when the peace
[28:43] of God comes it can come in the middle
[28:46] of the worst Havoc of your life
[28:50] and give you such a peace
[28:54] that no devil in hell can torment you
[28:58] it's a supernatural piece
[29:01] can you say amen for God is Supernatural
[29:07] he is provider
[29:10] but the way he provides is Supernatural
[29:15] can you say Amen
[29:16] everything may be yeah your bills maybe
[29:19] just be piling up and you don't know
[29:21] what to do
[29:22] right but when God comes on the seeds
[29:24] and begins to provide
[29:26] it'll leave you speechless
[29:29] you don't know how it happened but he
[29:31] did it
[29:32] because God is Supernatural
[29:37] you believe it
[29:40] needs nothing he can create what is
[29:43] needed by speaking his word
[29:45] look what he'd done for Abraham for
[29:47] example Abraham needed a ram
[29:51] he needed a sacrifice
[29:53] and at the time he needed it
[29:57] sometimes I I don't know sometimes God
[29:59] just Waits and waits and waits and waits
[30:02] sometimes he'll wait till the last
[30:04] second
[30:06] now you remember Abraham going up that
[30:08] mountain he already testified me and the
[30:10] lad will return
[30:13] and then I Isaac asked Him Father I see
[30:15] everything I see all this stuff for
[30:17] sacrifice where's that sacrifice and he
[30:20] didn't tell Isaac well you're that
[30:21] sacrifice he said Son God will provide
[30:24] himself
[30:26] God will provide himself a sacrifice why
[30:29] would he say it himself because God's
[30:31] the one that gave the promise Isaac was
[30:34] a promise from God Abraham it didn't
[30:37] matter to God it wasn't or it wasn't up
[30:39] to Abraham Amen to keep that sacrifice
[30:42] alive or Isaac alive it was God's
[30:44] promise
[30:46] so therefore he knew that God would
[30:48] provide his own self a sacrifice
[30:51] because God wouldn't let his own word
[30:53] die he would let his own word fail
[30:59] so Abraham I mean look God waited till
[31:03] the very last second
[31:04] he built the sacrifice he built it or
[31:07] built the altar he built everything and
[31:10] delayed his son on that altar not
[31:13] worrying one bit about it
[31:16] and there he grabbed that dagger anyway
[31:18] with all the force he was gonna going to
[31:21] uh uh slay his own son and at that time
[31:26] God withstayed his hand
[31:30] thank you
[31:32] and he turned around there's the ramp
[31:35] God provided
[31:38] and sometimes when you don't know what
[31:40] to do
[31:41] and when you're at your lowest point and
[31:44] you just think you're gonna and God
[31:45] ain't seeming to answer you hang on
[31:48] God has proven in this Bible that he is
[31:51] Supernatural
[31:52] and he's not moved by your time he's not
[31:54] moved by my time he's not by move by
[31:57] your situation he can move when the most
[32:00] impossible situation there is look at
[32:03] the Hebrew voice amen you know the
[32:05] prophet describes it three three steps
[32:08] he was not there two steps he wasn't
[32:10] there one step he wasn't there but when
[32:12] they walked in that fire there he was
[32:16] that's just God he's on time can you say
[32:20] Amen so he's Supernatural now so but uh
[32:23] so he's all of these things the seven
[32:25] Redemptive names and the I am and and
[32:28] and on and on and on we could go he's
[32:31] called The Rock and and these things but
[32:34] when he poured himself into the body of
[32:37] Jesus Christ he took on a human name and
[32:42] all that God was he poured in there and
[32:47] that human name represented every title
[32:51] that God ever had
[32:53] that human name
[32:57] is that right
[32:58] in Jesus dwelt the prince of peace
[33:01] the Everlasting father
[33:03] Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Shalom Jehovah
[33:06] Nissi ain't that right
[33:08] listen even John 14 27 tells the tells
[33:12] the the his disciples peace I leave with
[33:15] you
[33:16] well how can he leave that peace what is
[33:18] he going to do come up with movies
[33:20] so people get their mind off of the
[33:22] turmoils come on bro what's he gonna do
[33:25] I'll write a bunch of books so people
[33:27] can just just hide themselves off in a
[33:30] room and read and read and read and
[33:32] forget about their troubles that's not
[33:33] peace
[33:37] what's he gonna do give him a vacation
[33:39] plan
[33:41] send them to the Bahamas and say that's
[33:43] my peace
[33:46] no he God was in him
[33:50] and it was God speaking through that
[33:52] body
[33:53] that would say peace I leave with you my
[33:57] peace I've given to you not as the world
[33:59] giveth is it
[34:02] give I unto you why
[34:05] because the Prince of Peace
[34:08] the Prince of Peace was veiled in that
[34:10] body
[34:11] ain't that right
[34:13] so all the titles that God ever had are
[34:16] titles
[34:17] to one name
[34:19] Jesus Christ
[34:21] ain't that right
[34:23] listen Zechariah 14 9 and the Lord shall
[34:26] be king over all the Earth
[34:28] in that day there shall be
[34:31] one Lord and his name one
[34:36] one Lord and his name one
[34:39] right
[34:41] amen see so the prophet said if you were
[34:44] baptized in the name of Jehovah Rapha or
[34:47] Jehovah Jireh or any of those titles it
[34:50] would have to be Jesus Christ
[34:54] not yahshaway
[34:56] Jesus Christ
[35:02] we had that one
[35:04] young brother that coming in you know
[35:06] and of course you know
[35:10] his
[35:11] his Pastor got him
[35:13] you know secluded them little old church
[35:16] even though there's other message people
[35:18] around
[35:19] they come you know trying to convince us
[35:21] it was yahshua yahshua is to correct
[35:26] and I told him I said but a prophet told
[35:28] us Jesus Christ
[35:31] the Bible tells us Jesus Christ
[35:34] we'll stay with that
[35:37] ain't that right
[35:38] see all the titles the names that ever
[35:41] belonged to God was made one human name
[35:43] the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:47] you believe that can we say that again
[35:49] all the titles
[35:52] and every name that God had came under
[35:54] one name
[35:56] the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:59] ain't that right showing that you don't
[36:02] need to call upon Jehovah Jireh and
[36:04] Jehovah Rapha and Jehovah Shalom and
[36:06] Jehovah whatever you need and for
[36:08] whatever God is to you just call on the
[36:11] name of Jesus Christ he'll give you
[36:13] peace he'll give you salvation he'll
[36:16] deliver you he'll be your Victory he'll
[36:18] be your banner he'll be your life he'll
[36:21] be your provider
[36:23] can you say Amen the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:26] every Supernatural part of God is in
[36:29] that name
[36:30] [Applause]
[36:33] Colossians 3 17 and whatsoever you do in
[36:37] word or deep
[36:39] do all everybody say do all in the name
[36:42] of the Lord Jesus
[36:45] now what is Jesus brother Brown said
[36:48] Jesus is God's Redemption name
[36:52] ain't that right
[36:54] acts 4 12 tells us that there is no
[36:56] salvation in any other name
[37:02] there's no salvation in Jehovah Jireh
[37:07] no salvation in Jehovah shalom
[37:11] hello
[37:12] there ain't no salvation and I am that I
[37:15] am
[37:17] just as much as there's no salvation in
[37:19] Buddha
[37:21] there there's no salvation at all any
[37:23] other name no other name
[37:25] there's no other name can you say Amen
[37:28] there is no salvation in any other name
[37:31] for their for there is no other name
[37:35] under Heaven among given among men
[37:38] whereby we must be saved Jesus Christ is
[37:43] God's Redemption name
[37:47] amen
[37:49] so God's only name is Jesus Christ
[37:52] and what is Jesus Christ again the word
[37:56] made flesh
[37:58] keep that in your mind the word made
[38:00] flesh
[38:04] well the brand said what is it it's the
[38:06] true interpretation of the word
[38:09] what is the word made flesh the true
[38:11] interpretation of the word
[38:14] ain't that right
[38:15] so the name of God is in the word
[38:18] because he is the word
[38:24] so what is he then the prophet would ask
[38:26] the word interpreted is the
[38:28] manifestation of the name of God
[38:32] yeah now listen now because he says
[38:35] where two or three are gathered in my
[38:39] name
[38:41] I'm gonna be there
[38:43] you can't separate God from his name
[38:48] oh goodness
[38:50] gathered in my name what is he then the
[38:53] word interpreted everybody say the word
[38:56] interpreted
[38:58] is the manifestation
[39:01] of the name of God
[39:05] oh
[39:10] brother Brown said he is God's chosen
[39:12] place of worship
[39:14] and God's name is given to him
[39:18] he is God's place of worship and God's
[39:21] name is given to him he is the word of
[39:25] God he is the name of God
[39:29] hello see he is both word of God and
[39:34] name of God
[39:35] he is the he was the word made flesh
[39:39] you're with me he was the word of God
[39:42] Lamb of God name of God and was God
[39:46] that's what he was the Chosen and only
[39:50] place of worship to God
[39:55] now we know there is not one
[39:57] denomination
[39:58] that manifests the name of God
[40:02] of Jesus Christ right
[40:04] why because they're not the
[40:06] interpretation of the word
[40:08] they're not the true interpretation of
[40:11] the true word of God
[40:12] and they are not the interpretation and
[40:15] they're not interpreting the word of God
[40:17] so people are manifesting
[40:21] the name of their denomination so they
[40:24] manifest the name of Baptist they
[40:25] manifest the name of UPC
[40:28] they manifest the name of apostolic or
[40:31] whatever Assemblies of God or
[40:33] Pentecostal or what whatever they they
[40:36] manifest because they have become the
[40:40] interpretation of what their
[40:44] denomination teaches
[40:46] man
[40:48] right
[40:50] they they they're manifesting the name
[40:52] of Baptist because they've come become
[40:54] the interpretation of what the Baptist
[40:57] teaches
[40:58] that's why brother bran would say I'd
[41:00] ask him are you Christian well I'm
[41:01] Baptist are you Christian well I'm
[41:03] Methodist I didn't ask you that I asked
[41:05] you if you're a Christian well I'm
[41:06] Catholic
[41:10] ain't that right
[41:12] now notice John 5 43 Jesus said I come
[41:16] in my father's name and you receive me
[41:19] not
[41:20] three if another shall come in his own
[41:23] name him will you receive is that not
[41:26] true for today
[41:30] [Applause]
[41:31] they'll receive the name of Baptist
[41:34] they'll receive the name of Pentecostal
[41:37] they'll received the name of
[41:38] Presbyterian
[41:42] hello
[41:43] but according to Revelation 17 3 them
[41:46] names are names of blasphemy they're
[41:50] Blasphemous names
[41:52] there's only one thing no wonder the
[41:55] prophet would hit that thing so hard if
[41:59] you're Baptist and you're expecting to
[42:01] go to heaven because of that name
[42:03] there's no other name
[42:07] you don't want to bear that name
[42:13] in Deuteronomy 16 God tells the people
[42:15] that their sacrifice will only be
[42:17] accepted in the place the Lord chooses
[42:19] to place his name
[42:21] and so notice in Jesus day there were
[42:25] thousands of people who worshiped at
[42:28] their churches back then it was called
[42:30] synagogues
[42:32] but we call it churches today
[42:35] and there was thousands of them that
[42:37] would go to their churches and and and
[42:39] not one time do you ever hear of them
[42:43] getting saved
[42:45] getting healed getting delivered there's
[42:48] no record of it
[42:52] but there was one woman who worshiped
[42:56] where the word was being interpreted
[43:02] then you say Amen
[43:03] the place where God had placed his name
[43:07] and she was forgiven of her sins
[43:12] and you say Amen she was forgiven of her
[43:15] sins
[43:16] notice when the believer who was blind
[43:19] came to the word
[43:23] where the word was being interpreted
[43:26] which was the place that God had placed
[43:28] his name
[43:29] the blind Saul
[43:34] when the believer who had evix a
[43:37] daughter vix with the devil came to
[43:39] where the word was being interpreted the
[43:41] place where God placed his name her
[43:44] daughter was made whole at that same
[43:46] hour
[43:48] when the interpretation of the word
[43:53] the place where God placed his name came
[43:58] and stood at the grave of Lazarus a man
[44:02] that had been dead for days his soul was
[44:05] on a journey
[44:07] four days out
[44:10] yet that same word brought that man back
[44:14] to life again
[44:16] sir yes sir
[44:18] man
[44:20] never heard it at other churches
[44:23] it was where the word was being
[44:24] interpreted
[44:26] it was where the manifestation of the
[44:28] word was
[44:30] that had the name of God
[44:32] for God was with him in him can you say
[44:35] Amen
[44:36] John 14 10 Jesus said the father that
[44:38] dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[44:42] ain't that right
[44:43] so no wonder God was pleased to have his
[44:46] name there
[44:50] because the name now we all know the
[44:53] name represents your character it it the
[44:55] name represents your nature it the name
[44:57] represents who you really are your name
[45:01] brother Brian said there's so much value
[45:03] in a name
[45:04] that's why I tell them you know if you
[45:06] gotta if you got a child named Ricky or
[45:08] Elvis change that name change it change
[45:10] it to number one
[45:13] change it to whatever but but don't call
[45:15] him Ricky Don't call them Elvis He said
[45:18] and there's never been an age
[45:20] that that name has been used Elvis
[45:25] all right till this age
[45:28] ain't that right it's what he said
[45:31] so see God was in the place where he
[45:34] placed his name and showed that he was
[45:37] there by his Supernatural works
[45:42] brother Brown said the perfect
[45:44] manifestation of God in the Sun
[45:48] was by the indwelling spirit
[45:51] manifesting in word and works
[45:56] so again the perfect manifestation of
[45:59] God in the sun was by the indwelling
[46:02] spirit manifesting in word and works and
[46:06] they were not human uh what was a
[46:10] humanitarian works
[46:13] they were Supernatural works
[46:16] not humanitarian
[46:18] it was a Supernatural Ministry
[46:22] he manifested a supernatural life
[46:25] he spoke Supernatural words
[46:28] he did Supernatural things
[46:31] and you say Amen he raised the dead he
[46:34] opened the eyes of the blind he said at
[46:36] Liberty those who were bound
[46:38] he healed the Brokenhearted
[46:40] he fulfilled all prophecy that was spoke
[46:43] of him
[46:47] he performed the sign of the Messiah
[46:50] these were the works of God
[46:54] do you believe it Supernatural
[46:58] and he couldn't have done it
[47:01] if he wasn't the word
[47:07] it's the word that produces the works of
[47:10] God because it is God
[47:12] ain't that right so again God was
[47:14] perfectly manifested in Jesus Christ
[47:18] by the indwelling spirit
[47:23] manifesting the word in word and works
[47:28] now
[47:29] I want to go back to our opening
[47:32] scripture Ephesians 1 22.
[47:36] and hath put all things under his feet
[47:41] and gave him to be the head over all
[47:43] things to the church
[47:46] which is his body
[47:51] ain't that right
[47:53] then what does it say
[47:55] the fullness of him
[47:57] everybody say the fullness of him
[48:00] that feel is all in all so what is the
[48:03] fullness of him the church
[48:06] which is his body
[48:09] is the fullness of him
[48:11] right as I've told you before in the
[48:14] creation of Adam you see Adam and spirit
[48:16] form
[48:17] because God said let us make man in our
[48:19] own image
[48:21] man existed in spirit
[48:24] then you find we see Adam in flesh form
[48:29] hello
[48:30] the spirit of Adam became in that body
[48:32] of Flesh
[48:34] that God wasn't done yet
[48:37] we see Adam in another form and that's
[48:39] bride form
[48:41] can you say Amen she wasn't another
[48:44] creation
[48:45] she was just the fullness of Adam
[48:48] she was what was in Adam
[48:50] now she was the expression of Adam
[48:53] in so much that her name was Adam
[49:02] so what is the church
[49:05] the spiritual body of Jesus Christ
[49:09] and it is made up of human beings
[49:13] but the human beings were attributes of
[49:16] God before the foundation of the world
[49:19] God not only wanted a body so he could
[49:21] redeem man
[49:24] he wanted a wife
[49:26] he wanted to be wife
[49:31] great is the mystery of godliness
[49:35] hello
[49:38] so God is unfolding himself
[49:42] he's not manifesting a church
[49:45] he's manifesting himself
[49:48] and the church is his body
[49:53] hello
[49:54] so how do we become part of the body
[49:56] First Corinthians 12 13 for by one
[49:59] Spirit we are all baptized into one body
[50:05] right
[50:07] that's right see and what is the church
[50:10] the Tabernacle of God
[50:13] [Music]
[50:15] becoming tangible
[50:20] amen
[50:22] I have to say you know that
[50:25] out of all the New Testament Church ages
[50:33] now I know that people you know there
[50:35] are some saying that there's that well
[50:38] you know
[50:39] one spoke the other day
[50:42] and said that you know it's just been
[50:46] confusing to him about bright age
[50:49] and are we in laodicea are we in Broad
[50:51] age what are we and he said he got down
[50:53] into prayer and and God spoke to him
[50:58] and said it's no different than what
[51:00] it's been in every other age there's
[51:01] always been a bright age in every age
[51:05] that is not what the prophet said
[51:11] so I don't care who spoke to him
[51:15] it wasn't the god of the prophet
[51:20] hello
[51:25] because we've been climaxing climaxing
[51:28] the prophet said this is the greatest
[51:30] age ever
[51:32] and I want to say this is the greatest
[51:34] condition that the church has ever been
[51:36] in
[51:37] she has come to the height of of what
[51:40] God has wanted in her
[51:44] can you say Amen not God just dwelling
[51:47] in portion of his church
[51:50] that God dwelling in his fullness in the
[51:53] church
[51:54] hello
[51:56] that's right you say well what about the
[51:58] days of Acts what about Pentecostal that
[52:00] was the seed form
[52:02] that's what God started in seed form
[52:05] that you are not seed form you are a
[52:09] matured bride of Christ
[52:12] you are the complete thought of God
[52:16] can you say amen and there's never been
[52:18] a bright age but this age
[52:21] there's never been a Perfection of the
[52:23] church like it is in this age
[52:29] can you say Amen
[52:31] that's just where I feel and that's the
[52:33] way I see it in the message
[52:35] see the church is the Tabernacle of God
[52:39] it's the veil that God hides in himself
[52:42] himself in
[52:44] so God not only one looking at Jesus as
[52:47] a body
[52:49] but he was looking Beyond Jesus
[52:53] he was looking Beyond it
[52:55] he said now this is going to be my
[52:57] masterpiece and so through David and all
[52:59] these he began to talk about Jesus their
[53:02] lives portrayed Jesus Christ and when he
[53:05] come God poured himself into that bottle
[53:08] ain't that right that his thoughts just
[53:11] didn't stop there
[53:12] because Jesus says I must go away but
[53:15] I'll not leave you comfortless I will
[53:18] come to you
[53:22] ain't that right and the world not going
[53:25] to see me anymore but you'll see me at
[53:28] that day you'll know that I'm in the
[53:30] father you and me and I in you
[53:32] ain't ain't that right so now Jesus the
[53:35] god in that body that human body is now
[53:39] talking of another body
[53:41] [Music]
[53:43] ain't that right
[53:46] now so we find great notice what Paul
[53:50] says great is the mystery of godliness
[53:52] and I hope that I hope I'm making sense
[53:54] to you
[53:55] great is the mystery of godliness God
[53:59] was manifested in flesh
[54:01] God always keeps the people wandering
[54:06] the unbeliever is so stumped
[54:10] right but the believer recognizes him
[54:14] not by his body
[54:16] but by what he is
[54:19] in that body
[54:21] they'll recognize the supernatural God
[54:23] is there by the supernatural works
[54:27] ain't that right
[54:29] that woman at the well knew she was
[54:31] expecting she knew the Messiah would
[54:34] come with a supernatural sign
[54:37] and when he performed it she saw it
[54:42] the others they didn't know
[54:44] they were still looking for God behind
[54:46] the badger skin
[54:49] and the world today is still stumped
[54:52] because they're looking for a God that
[54:54] was 2 000 years ago in a Corporal body
[54:57] physical body
[55:01] and they don't know God's moved on
[55:04] into his spiritual body the supernatural
[55:07] body the church today
[55:14] say the mystery continues
[55:18] Colossians 1 25
[55:20] whereof I am made a minister
[55:23] according to the dispensation of God
[55:25] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[55:28] the word of God even the mystery
[55:31] which has been hid from ages from
[55:33] Generations but has now made manifest to
[55:36] his Saints
[55:37] to whom God would make known what is the
[55:41] riches of the glory of this mystery
[55:43] among who the Jews nope the Samaritans
[55:48] nope
[55:50] you see it was what was made manifest to
[55:53] them was God in Christ
[55:56] God in Christ
[55:58] he performed a sign that Supernatural
[56:00] sign to the Jew and he performed the
[56:03] super natural sign to that Samaritan
[56:06] both the prophet said both raises of
[56:08] people got that Supernatural sign but
[56:11] that Supernatural sign had never yet
[56:13] been declared to the Gentiles yet
[56:19] but this mystery would be known in this
[56:22] day
[56:23] and that mystery is Christ in you
[56:28] can you say Amen Christ in you the hope
[56:31] of glory
[56:33] the same sign that God did before
[56:36] Abraham is the same sign that he'd done
[56:39] in Jesus Christ that body is the same
[56:43] sign he done in this age
[56:47] not through a word born body but a
[56:50] redeemed born body
[56:53] not a created body
[56:55] but a redeemed body
[56:57] a sex-born body that was redeemed
[57:02] and you say Amen
[57:04] now it's letting us know it's letting us
[57:06] know where we're at
[57:08] the mystery is revealed Christ in you
[57:11] the hope of glory
[57:13] can you say Amen
[57:15] yeah not church member Christ in you

[57:29] and I know I know people have gone so
[57:31] far out on that Eighth Day and now it's
[57:34] gotten to the place that if you mention
[57:35] eight day everybody just their hackles
[57:37] raised and say oh I hear you just
[57:39] Brother Brad was the one that brought
[57:40] the Eighth Day in
[57:42] and if you really go listen to that he's
[57:44] he's talking about the Earth he's
[57:46] talking about the world but he's also

[58:50] own life in you and then lose you and he
[58:52] has to depart from you he's with you
[58:55] that's your token
[58:59] can you say man that's the token that
[59:02] this bride has
[59:10] notice
[59:12] because I think this is really
[59:15] interesting or I got excited as someone

[1:00:43] he is both root and offspring of David
[1:00:47] the Brighton Morning Star in him dwells
[1:00:50] the fullness of the godhead bodily where
[1:00:53] we in there
[1:00:56] are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:00:59] where in the godhead
[1:01:02] in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[1:01:05] bodily wherein there
[1:01:08] we are Sons and Daughters of God you're
[1:01:10] not Sons and Daughters of God by Earthly
[1:01:12] parents you're not Sons and Daughters of
[1:01:14] God by Earthly things programs don't
[1:01:17] make you a son and daughter of God pizza
[1:01:20] parties don't make you a son of daughter
[1:01:22] of God signing your name on a road
[1:01:24] doesn't make you a son and daughter of
[1:01:26] God and just believing God sent a
[1:01:27] prophet doesn't make you a son or
[1:01:29] daughter of God but being part of the
[1:01:31] godhead
[1:01:33] you're part of God
[1:01:42] hello
[1:01:46] in him in him that's why you got to be
[1:01:49] in him
[1:01:52] birth in him
[1:01:54] and you say Amen
[1:01:56] now notice
[1:01:58] in him dwells the fullness of the
[1:02:00] godhead bodily where in there
[1:02:02] our sons and daughters of God in God's
[1:02:06] godhead
[1:02:08] as Sons and Daughters we are in the
[1:02:12] family
[1:02:13] God wanted to be family
[1:02:19] right
[1:02:21] that's Eternal thoughts
[1:02:25] so that's what makes us work
[1:02:27] [Music]
[1:02:31] if you wasn't predestinated to begin
[1:02:33] with you'll never be worked
[1:02:38] if Jesus wasn't predestinated the Lamb
[1:02:41] of God the Messiah he couldn't be word
[1:02:45] but because he was the one that God had
[1:02:48] in his mind
[1:02:51] he was the Tabernacle of God he was the
[1:02:55] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:02:58] world
[1:02:59] he was the one that all the prophet
[1:03:02] spoke of
[1:03:06] and in him
[1:03:08] well the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:03:12] yes sir and the word became flesh
[1:03:16] hello
[1:03:17] the deal is the word's becoming flesh
[1:03:19] again
[1:03:23] the word is becoming flesh again
[1:03:27] that means she's bearing her name his
[1:03:30] name
[1:03:31] that's why only a prophet could do it
[1:03:33] not denomination they'd call you
[1:03:35] Baptists they'd call you this but he
[1:03:37] called you miss Jesus Christ
[1:03:39] can you say Amen because he knew the
[1:03:41] thoughts of God was becoming tangible
[1:03:44] God becoming tangible again not in the
[1:03:48] physical body of Jesus Christ but in a
[1:03:50] in a a mini-membered body of Jesus
[1:03:54] Christ
[1:04:00] see as Sons and Daughters were in the
[1:04:02] family if you're in there
[1:04:08] Glory Glory Glory
[1:04:12] I'm excited
[1:04:16] no wonder you're going to conquer no
[1:04:18] wonder
[1:04:19] the devil's trying to get you he tried
[1:04:21] to get Jesus too
[1:04:23] he couldn't get Jesus and he can't get
[1:04:25] you
[1:04:26] he can
[1:04:28] he got his feather sins one time and
[1:04:30] he's getting his feathers singed again
[1:04:33] the same God we're part of that same
[1:04:37] thought
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:46] s
[1:04:47] Holiness standards don't make your sons
[1:04:49] and daughters
[1:04:51] being in the godhead
[1:04:54] makes you sons and daughters
[1:04:57] Glory Glory
[1:05:00] I hope it makes sense to you
[1:05:02] Ephesians 3 14 for this cause I bow my
[1:05:06] knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:07] Christ
[1:05:09] of whom
[1:05:11] say it with me the whole family in
[1:05:15] heaven
[1:05:16] and Earth
[1:05:18] is named
[1:05:21] what are you named what's your name
[1:05:26] that's what Paul's saying
[1:05:29] of whom the whole family in Heaven and
[1:05:32] Earth is named
[1:05:35] notice acts 15 14 Simon Simeon hath
[1:05:39] declared how God at the first did visit
[1:05:42] the Gentiles to take out of them a
[1:05:47] people
[1:05:48] for his name
[1:05:51] right
[1:05:53] Satan's trying to put the name of
[1:05:55] Baptist
[1:05:57] you have to forgive me but it's it's
[1:05:59] just truth
[1:06:01] and maybe there's someone denominational
[1:06:03] person that's watching
[1:06:06] there ain't no other name
[1:06:08] them names are Blasphemous names that
[1:06:11] are of the devil
[1:06:12] to get you away from the name of Jesus
[1:06:14] Christ
[1:06:16] you cannot bear the name of Baptist and
[1:06:18] and have power in the name of Jesus
[1:06:21] Christ you must bear the name of Jesus
[1:06:24] Christ
[1:06:27] for that name is tied to God and God
[1:06:29] Alone
[1:06:31] can you say man
[1:06:33] well it's true
[1:06:35] not all the Gentiles are going to have
[1:06:37] his name
[1:06:39] but he has taken out from the Gentiles
[1:06:43] a people for his name
[1:06:46] and when is this done Revelations 18 6
[1:06:49] and I heard another voice from Heaven
[1:06:51] saying come out of her my people
[1:06:53] do you realize
[1:06:55] never has that been done never has that
[1:06:57] been uttered never has that been a a a
[1:07:00] fulfillment of scripture until this age
[1:07:04] I heard another voice from Heaven saying
[1:07:06] come out of her my people that ye be not
[1:07:09] partakers of her sins and that you
[1:07:12] received not of her plagues
[1:07:14] now notice
[1:07:17] how does he move them out how how God
[1:07:20] the prophet says Al Hosea says he Hume
[1:07:24] them out
[1:07:25] how do you come out God has to do it
[1:07:28] himself
[1:07:29] how else can you come out of the
[1:07:31] Traditions that you were in
[1:07:33] it took God to do that foreign
[1:07:36] I'm telling you the devil's got such a
[1:07:38] stronghold in them Creeds and traditions
[1:07:40] and darkness of men
[1:07:42] and it's so powerful that it blinds men
[1:07:46] even though God would do something right
[1:07:48] before their eyes
[1:07:52] it takes God to go in there and do a
[1:07:55] hewing out
[1:07:57] but that's what the Bible says that God
[1:08:00] took out a people for his name
[1:08:04] and God says I have viewed them out by
[1:08:07] the prophets
[1:08:09] the book of Hosea
[1:08:12] and this word huge means chopped he
[1:08:15] chopped Israel out from the rest of the
[1:08:18] Nations
[1:08:19] and how does he do it by his two-edged
[1:08:22] sword his word
[1:08:25] ain't that right
[1:08:26] see by the prophets who had the
[1:08:29] Vindicated word he chopped his Nation
[1:08:33] from the rest of the Nations
[1:08:37] in this last day God has chopped his
[1:08:39] bride from the denominations by his
[1:08:42] Prophet by his word promised in Malachi
[1:08:45] 4.
[1:08:47] ain't that right what has he done he has
[1:08:50] hewed himself out a bride from the rest
[1:08:53] of the churches
[1:08:57] that right
[1:08:58] remember in the Old Testament the
[1:09:00] prophet took the word that came to him
[1:09:02] and chopped Israel out
[1:09:04] and he told them Moses told told them
[1:09:06] separate yourself from the rest of them
[1:09:09] see they want to act like the rest of
[1:09:11] the Nations they wanted a king
[1:09:13] they wanted to be like everybody else
[1:09:15] ain't that right brother Brown said it's
[1:09:17] just like the churches today they say we
[1:09:20] believe the word but then turn around
[1:09:21] say well we should do this and we should
[1:09:23] do that and we should do this totally
[1:09:25] against the word
[1:09:27] hello
[1:09:28] and the problem says I don't care what
[1:09:31] they say
[1:09:33] the words right
[1:09:35] now that's where the bride is right now
[1:09:37] I don't care what they have to say
[1:09:41] the words right
[1:09:45] why we've been hewed out
[1:09:51] he's chopping her out by the word they
[1:09:54] say we should use titles
[1:09:56] to baptize that's not what the prophet
[1:09:58] taught
[1:10:01] right
[1:10:02] they say there's been a bride age in
[1:10:04] every bride age in every age that's not
[1:10:06] what the prophet taught
[1:10:09] they want to tell us there's two Lords
[1:10:11] that's not what the prophet taught
[1:10:13] they want to tell us there's two Souls
[1:10:16] that's not what the prophet taught
[1:10:20] and you say Amen they say your theophany
[1:10:23] isn't already in existence but it's just
[1:10:25] uh that it's only in the mind of God and
[1:10:28] then when you get there you'll get it
[1:10:29] that's not what the prophet taught
[1:10:34] and you say Amen they say the Holy Ghost
[1:10:37] is a psychologist that's not what the
[1:10:40] prophet taught
[1:10:41] [Applause]
[1:10:42] surely you can say Amen to that too
[1:10:46] you say well you're just hammering
[1:10:47] someone no I'm telling you the Prophet
[1:10:51] hewed this bride out
[1:10:57] hello
[1:10:59] they say men that's married two or three
[1:11:01] times can preach
[1:11:03] that's not what the prophet taught
[1:11:08] can you say Amen
[1:11:10] now listen Church
[1:11:12] brother Brown said Christ never sent me
[1:11:14] to build organization Christ sent me to
[1:11:17] build individuals to the stature of
[1:11:21] Jesus Christ
[1:11:22] that they may be the PowerHouse and the
[1:11:25] dwelling place of the Spirit by his word
[1:11:31] hello
[1:11:33] you can't be uh uh the stature of a
[1:11:36] perfect man uh built to that without the
[1:11:39] word
[1:11:40] you cannot beat the PowerHouse and
[1:11:43] Dwelling Place of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:44] without the word it's all by the word
[1:11:48] that's why God would send a prophet in
[1:11:50] this age
[1:11:55] is this all right
[1:11:59] see build up the individual to that
[1:12:01] place who's going to do it priest nope
[1:12:04] Pope nope
[1:12:06] a prophet with the message
[1:12:09] it's the message that is building us up
[1:12:13] not to intellectualism
[1:12:18] not to where we know it all then we get
[1:12:21] bored with church and we just now we're
[1:12:23] just looking around fussing and fighting
[1:12:25] and arguing
[1:12:26] that's not a people that's hewed out
[1:12:30] [Music]
[1:12:37] he said not build an organization to a
[1:12:40] greater denomination
[1:12:41] but build the individual to Sons and
[1:12:44] Daughters of God that's the idea
[1:12:47] what's the idea of the message to build
[1:12:50] Sons and Daughters of God up
[1:12:52] to where they become the PowerHouse of
[1:12:55] God they they they become the living
[1:12:57] Place Dwelling Place of the Spirit by
[1:13:00] his word and brother Graham said when
[1:13:03] the bride will get back to being a word
[1:13:06] bride
[1:13:10] amen
[1:13:11] was he not a word man
[1:13:16] Jesus Christ was he not a word man he
[1:13:19] was a word individual the word was made
[1:13:22] flesh
[1:13:24] so when the bride will get back to being
[1:13:26] a word bride she will produce the very
[1:13:29] works that Jesus produced
[1:13:33] notice brother Brown called her a word
[1:13:36] bride
[1:13:38] ain't that right
[1:13:39] a word bride
[1:13:41] see so when she returns to being a word
[1:13:45] bride
[1:13:46] she will then produce the very works
[1:13:48] that Jesus produced now notice now I'm
[1:13:51] going to be closing here in a minute but
[1:13:54] the prophet said God's body United as
[1:13:58] his bride being one
[1:14:03] listen now
[1:14:05] being one
[1:14:09] so we're not looking at a Jesus of
[1:14:11] yesterday
[1:14:13] two thousand years ago
[1:14:15] the bride
[1:14:17] and Christ
[1:14:19] are one
[1:14:24] so I said
[1:14:26] God's body United as his bride being one
[1:14:29] him and Christ together
[1:14:31] is the spirit working in the flesh of
[1:14:33] the church like like everybody say like
[1:14:36] it worked in the flesh of Jesus
[1:14:40] so as I was saying earlier there has
[1:14:44] been no no Ministry
[1:14:46] outside this ministry Paul Saint Martin
[1:14:49] any of them
[1:14:50] like the ministry of Jesus Christ none
[1:14:55] that's the ministry
[1:14:57] that is Promised for our day
[1:14:59] that's the minute that's the very works
[1:15:03] The Works that I do shall you do also
[1:15:07] never has that been fulfilled for this
[1:15:09] until this day
[1:15:12] and I know people will debate on me on
[1:15:14] that one but with me on that one but I'm
[1:15:16] telling you that the brother Branham
[1:15:19] brought these promises to life for our
[1:15:22] day
[1:15:26] this day
[1:15:28] so he says see like it worked in the
[1:15:32] flesh of Jesus Christ because it's part
[1:15:34] of his body
[1:15:38] not Twain but one they are one husband
[1:15:43] and wife is no longer two but one
[1:15:48] and Christ and his body is one
[1:15:53] and the same spirit that was in Christ
[1:15:56] is in his bride in his body
[1:16:00] that unites them together with all the
[1:16:05] words
[1:16:07] that's what connects you to every
[1:16:09] promise spoken
[1:16:11] of this age
[1:16:13] Christ in you
[1:16:15] makes you one
[1:16:17] [Music]
[1:16:18] then you say Amen to God
[1:16:22] and the same spirit that was in Christ
[1:16:24] is in his bride in his body that unites
[1:16:27] them together with all the word and God
[1:16:29] living in there himself manifesting it
[1:16:34] you're just the body
[1:16:38] oh if I could just be a Christian just
[1:16:40] be the body
[1:16:43] oh if I could just do all the things
[1:16:45] just be the body
[1:16:47] God will do the works
[1:16:52] yield
[1:16:55] ain't that right
[1:16:58] so this means that the brides will have
[1:17:01] both spirit and word
[1:17:05] right and Jesus said my spirit is word
[1:17:09] and laugh
[1:17:10] now notice National Force put Israel
[1:17:13] inner Homeland National Force will put
[1:17:16] the church in the world Council of
[1:17:17] churches but everybody say but the power
[1:17:21] of God will put the people in The Bride
[1:17:25] the world forces this way the world
[1:17:27] world forces that way that God forces
[1:17:30] upward the spirit of God which is the
[1:17:33] word of God my word is spirit and life
[1:17:35] will put the bride in her place
[1:17:40] can you say Amen you will be there by
[1:17:43] the word and by the spirit
[1:17:45] you will manifest him by word and spirit
[1:17:49] that's your place that's your position
[1:17:53] can you say Amen he'll put the bride in
[1:17:56] her place because she will recognize her
[1:17:59] position in the word not in a church not
[1:18:03] in a Creed in the word
[1:18:07] then she's in Christ will put her in her
[1:18:11] place no National Force will do it
[1:18:17] Russia's not he not for you
[1:18:21] Russia's heating up for this world
[1:18:25] Council of churches ain't heating up for
[1:18:27] you
[1:18:29] whatever's happened in the politics and
[1:18:31] governments and that ain't for you the
[1:18:34] power of God is for you
[1:18:37] amen don't worry
[1:18:40] listen the word is God John 1 1.
[1:18:44] and the spirit is God John 4 24. you
[1:18:48] cannot have one without the other
[1:18:50] they're one all one one and the same
[1:18:54] so if a person truly has the spirit of
[1:18:56] God he will have the word of God
[1:18:59] right
[1:19:00] it was that way with the prophets
[1:19:03] right they have the spirit of God in
[1:19:05] them and the word of God came to them
[1:19:08] and what did it make them God
[1:19:12] they were called gods
[1:19:14] by God himself
[1:19:18] so it was the word that came to the
[1:19:22] prophet John at the river
[1:19:24] the prophet said he was both the prophet
[1:19:26] and the messenger
[1:19:28] for that day
[1:19:30] the Bible says he was filled with the
[1:19:32] holy ghost from his mother's womb
[1:19:36] notice what the prophet says the word
[1:19:37] everybody say the word
[1:19:39] always comes to the spirit field
[1:19:45] that is the evidence
[1:19:48] of being filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:52] and Jesus said it was the evidence
[1:19:56] John 14 16 and I will pray the father
[1:19:59] and he shall give you another comforter
[1:20:02] that he may abide with you forever even
[1:20:05] the spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:20:07] cannot receive and you say Amen so what
[1:20:11] is the comforter it's the spirit of
[1:20:13] Truth
[1:20:14] and it is a person
[1:20:17] not a thought not a ghost the person
[1:20:21] the comforter is the spirit of truth and
[1:20:23] the world cannot receive him
[1:20:26] ain't that right so what is the spirit
[1:20:28] of Truth in John 17 17 Jesus said Thy
[1:20:32] word is truth
[1:20:36] right
[1:20:37] so the spirit of the word
[1:20:40] will come to you
[1:20:42] the spirit of the word the spirit of
[1:20:44] Truth
[1:20:45] will come to you he's going to be your
[1:20:47] comfort
[1:20:49] all the words are comfort
[1:20:52] then you say Amen
[1:20:54] why is it because it's not mixed with
[1:20:56] anything
[1:20:58] it's pure word
[1:21:02] so the world cannot receive the Holy
[1:21:04] Ghost
[1:21:05] y'all with me the foolish virgin cannot
[1:21:08] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:21:10] because they failed to go on to the
[1:21:11] fullness of the atonement
[1:21:15] true
[1:21:17] and neither can they receive the word
[1:21:20] the world cannot receive the Holy Ghost
[1:21:22] they cannot receive the word
[1:21:24] because the word and spirit are one
[1:21:30] ain't that right
[1:21:32] notice now John 14 26 but the comforter
[1:21:35] which is the Holy Ghost
[1:21:38] whom the father will sin in my name
[1:21:42] he shall teach you all things
[1:21:45] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:21:47] whatsoever I have said unto you can you
[1:21:49] say Amen so we see the word coming
[1:21:53] because the spirit of God
[1:21:59] well I got the Holy Ghost I don't need
[1:22:01] the word
[1:22:03] you got some ghost
[1:22:07] that I ain't gonna call it holy
[1:22:11] and you say man
[1:22:14] see the word coming because the spirit
[1:22:16] of God notice Spirit of Truth
[1:22:20] John 14 18 I will not leave you
[1:22:23] comfortless now this is this is Jesus
[1:22:25] speaking right
[1:22:27] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:22:30] come to you
[1:22:31] the world's looking for a physical
[1:22:32] coming what they didn't know it was God
[1:22:35] in that body speaking
[1:22:38] to another body
[1:22:41] hello
[1:22:44] so Jesus is the comforter he is the
[1:22:46] spirit of Truth the word which is God
[1:22:51] yet a little while the world seeth me no
[1:22:53] more but you see me because I live you
[1:22:56] shall live also
[1:22:59] at that day you shall know that I'm in
[1:23:01] the father you and me and I in you
[1:23:03] so now how are you going to know
[1:23:06] how are you going to know
[1:23:08] again this the Holy Spirit or the word
[1:23:12] always comes to the spirit field
[1:23:17] I want to take my time for just a moment
[1:23:19] I promise I'm Gonna Let You Go
[1:23:22] you'll probably think man what's
[1:23:23] happened to this guy
[1:23:25] every service now
[1:23:28] I'll tell you why I feel the urgency
[1:23:32] I don't know how much longer we got
[1:23:37] I just I don't know it's just in my
[1:23:39] heart anyways
[1:23:41] so how are you going to know
[1:23:44] Prophet says he who can receive the word
[1:23:48] believe the word
[1:23:50] and you say man
[1:23:52] the word comes the spirit field how are
[1:23:55] you going to know he who can receive the
[1:23:57] word believe the word
[1:24:00] someone asks what is the evidence that a
[1:24:02] person is really filled with the Holy
[1:24:03] Ghost John 14 26 when the Holy Ghost has
[1:24:06] come he will show you things to come see
[1:24:09] heal perfect it
[1:24:12] did he not do that
[1:24:15] is he's not doing that today
[1:24:18] taking the words of a prophet and
[1:24:20] perfecting it in your life
[1:24:24] he'll perfect it man-mades won't do it
[1:24:27] and he is the word so when he the Holy
[1:24:30] Ghost has come he will identify himself
[1:24:33] in you with the scripture
[1:24:38] and that is the true sign that the holy
[1:24:41] spirit is in you because it is the word
[1:24:47] now listen
[1:24:49] the prophet told us the Holy Spirit has
[1:24:51] been bound by these denominational
[1:24:52] Rivers for almost 2 000 years
[1:24:56] but it is to be loosed in the evening
[1:24:59] time
[1:25:00] by this evening time message
[1:25:03] the Holy Spirit lose by the evening time
[1:25:06] word
[1:25:09] the Holy Spirit back in the church again
[1:25:11] Christ revealed in human flesh in the
[1:25:15] evening time
[1:25:17] can you say man
[1:25:20] do you love him
[1:25:23] and that's what happened in according to
[1:25:25] Revelations 10 1.
[1:25:27] that Mighty angel came down
[1:25:30] with an open book
[1:25:32] the spirit of Truth came down
[1:25:34] with the open Word
[1:25:36] can you say amen and I say to you the
[1:25:39] spirit and word is here
[1:25:42] yes sir and Jesus had the indwelling of
[1:25:46] the Spirit dwelling in him without
[1:25:48] measure and the word came to him
[1:25:51] ain't that right acts 1 1 Jesus began to
[1:25:54] both do and teach
[1:25:58] both do and teach John 17 or 7 16 Jesus
[1:26:03] said my Doctrine is not mine but the
[1:26:05] father that sent me brother Brown said
[1:26:07] make no mistake about it a person that
[1:26:10] is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into
[1:26:13] the body of Christ receiving the
[1:26:15] fullness of the spirit will be in the
[1:26:18] word all the way
[1:26:22] that's what he said
[1:26:25] say it again make no mistake about it
[1:26:30] a person that is truly baptized with the
[1:26:33] Holy Ghost into the body of Christ
[1:26:35] receiving the fullness of the spirit
[1:26:38] will be in the word all the way that is
[1:26:40] the evidence of being baptized with the
[1:26:42] Holy Ghost Judas failed and multitudes
[1:26:46] failed right there
[1:26:50] you say Amen
[1:26:54] being in the word
[1:26:57] we're gonna make it personal because the
[1:26:59] prophet did it
[1:27:00] being in the word for your age
[1:27:04] everybody say for my age
[1:27:06] is the evidence
[1:27:08] that you have the Holy Ghost
[1:27:11] and brother Brown said evidence has to
[1:27:14] do with receiving the word
[1:27:20] amen
[1:27:21] First Corinthians 14 37 If any man think
[1:27:25] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[1:27:27] him acknowledge that these things that I
[1:27:30] write unto you are the Commandments of
[1:27:31] the Lord
[1:27:33] brother Branham after reading this
[1:27:34] passage of scripture he said we see that
[1:27:37] the proof of the indwelling spirit was
[1:27:40] to acknowledge and follow what God's
[1:27:43] Prophet gave for his age as he set the
[1:27:46] church in order
[1:27:49] and you say Amen
[1:27:54] and notice what Paul said to them who
[1:27:56] claimed to have another revelation First
[1:27:58] Corinthians 14 36 what
[1:28:02] came the word of God to you out from you
[1:28:05] and came it unto you only
[1:28:10] now notice what brother Brian says after
[1:28:12] reading this
[1:28:14] the evidence excuse me
[1:28:17] the evidence of a Spirit-filled
[1:28:20] Christian believer is not to produce the
[1:28:24] truth
[1:28:28] we don't need eight day Messengers
[1:28:33] we don't need higher Revelations
[1:28:38] it's not up to us to produce the truth
[1:28:43] the word but to receive the truth the
[1:28:48] word and to believe and Obey it
[1:28:54] I'll read it again the evidence of a
[1:28:57] Spirit-filled Christian believer is not
[1:28:59] to produce the truth the word but to
[1:29:02] receive the truth the word and to
[1:29:04] believe and Obey it
[1:29:07] can you say Amen
[1:29:10] you love the Lord isn't he wonderful
[1:29:13] so now we know what the word is for our
[1:29:16] day and where it come from
[1:29:18] Malachi four five and six behold I send
[1:29:20] unto you Elijah the prophet Revelations
[1:29:22] 10 1-7 we know what that's all about so
[1:29:26] I'm not going to go into that but
[1:29:27] brother Brown said he the lamb took the
[1:29:30] book opened the book and tore up the
[1:29:33] seals and sent it down to earth to his
[1:29:35] seventh angel to reveal it to his
[1:29:41] people
[1:29:42] his eternal thoughts
[1:29:44] his attributes
[1:29:48] his people
[1:29:50] they don't belong to the organization
[1:29:52] they've been hewed out by the prophet
[1:29:55] and they're called his people
[1:29:58] can you say Amen
[1:30:03] and notice the prophet that seventh
[1:30:06] angel must have been a prophet or the
[1:30:07] Mysteries wouldn't have came to him the
[1:30:08] word wouldn't have came to him he
[1:30:09] wouldn't have been able able to open up
[1:30:11] the Mysteries
[1:30:13] ain't that right and that seventh angel
[1:30:16] is the prophet of Malachi 4.
[1:30:20] because there's no other promise given
[1:30:23] to us about a prophet
[1:30:29] hello
[1:30:35] and if you notice Malachi 4
[1:30:38] God didn't say behold I send unto you
[1:30:41] Elijah
[1:30:42] a bunch of prophets
[1:30:45] the prophet
[1:30:48] and you say Amen and what was the
[1:30:50] prophet a Divine interpreter of the word
[1:30:54] had the Divine interpretation the signs
[1:30:56] of him foretelling and for knowing that
[1:30:58] was a vindicate to the people that he
[1:31:00] was a prophet
[1:31:02] and today
[1:31:03] by God's help in another place he says
[1:31:06] this we now have the perfect
[1:31:07] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:31:10] vindication
[1:31:12] see so we're not looking for New
[1:31:14] Revelations
[1:31:15] we are just receiving the word that came
[1:31:18] to us
[1:31:20] if the musicians will come now
[1:31:23] I got more to say but I'll hush
[1:31:26] but the
[1:31:28] we know that we're only just to receive
[1:31:31] we're not to come up with new word new
[1:31:32] revelation we're just to receive
[1:31:35] because look at the prophecy for you in
[1:31:38] Revelations 10 8 and 9. John was told to
[1:31:43] get the book
[1:31:45] from the angel
[1:31:47] and eat it up
[1:31:49] receive it
[1:31:51] believe it
[1:31:53] amen can you say man
[1:31:57] wonderful
[1:31:59] remember Revelations 22 17 the spirit
[1:32:02] and the bride say come
[1:32:05] let him that heareth say come
[1:32:08] brother Brown said see the bride speaks
[1:32:11] the same word
[1:32:14] as does the spirit
[1:32:16] for she is a word bride proving
[1:32:20] she has the spirit
[1:32:23] amen do you love him
