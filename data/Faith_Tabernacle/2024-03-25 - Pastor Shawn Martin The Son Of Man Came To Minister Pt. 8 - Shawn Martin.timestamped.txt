[45:50] amen and amen praise the Lord uh the
[45:55] book of Philippians the second chapter I
[45:58] forgot my glasses so we're going to try
[46:01] this here but it says um third verse let
[46:06] nothing be done through Strife or vain
[46:10] Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each
[46:14] esteem other better than themselves look
[46:17] not every man on his own things but
[46:20] every man also on the things of others
[46:23] let this mind be in Christ which was
[46:25] also in Christ Christ let this mind be
[46:28] in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[46:31] who being in the form of God thought it
[46:33] not robbery to be equal with God but
[46:37] made himself of no reputation and took
[46:39] upon him the form of a servant and was
[46:42] made in the likeness of men and being
[46:46] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[46:50] himself and became obedient unto death
[46:53] even the death of the Cross amen then if
[46:57] you'd like to turn with me to the book
[46:59] of
[47:00] Galatians the 5th
[47:03] chapter Galatians chapter
[47:07] 5 and
[47:10] um the we'll read the 26th
[47:18] verse says let us not be desirous of
[47:21] vain
[47:22] Glory provoking one another and envying
[47:27] one another amen you can have your seats
[47:31] this
[47:33] evening praise the
[47:35] Lord I um want to maybe just continue on
[47:39] that thought that this morning the son
[47:42] of man came to
[47:44] minister and um one thing uh that Jesus
[47:50] shows us uh in his life and that is that
[47:54] it takes humility
[47:57] uh to minister to others and humility is
[48:01] a a very powerful thing and uh brother
[48:05] brandham really actually talks uh uh
[48:08] quite a bit on on
[48:10] humility and um you know uh have you
[48:14] ever just wondered why we do foot
[48:17] washing uh brother brandham says it's
[48:20] it's because it's an act of
[48:23] humility and um and so
[48:27] uh humility is is a great thing and this
[48:30] is actually what Jesus did when he
[48:32] washed his the disciples feet he was it
[48:35] was showing the humility within him amen
[48:39] and uh then he says I leave this as an
[48:42] example uh that you should do as I have
[48:45] done unto you and so uh uh brother
[48:50] brandham he says we want to be humble
[48:53] more than anything else because that
[48:56] that's the secret to power can you say
[49:00] Amen now I thought about our ministering
[49:03] um our our ministering is different than
[49:06] just the
[49:07] average
[49:09] um uh I guess the norm of of way uh most
[49:15] do um you know a lot of them pass tracks
[49:18] out and uh you know they'll they'll have
[49:22] soup supper or they'll have have a movie
[49:25] night or they'll have have something to
[49:27] draw the crowd in and and um you know
[49:31] and then you know uh uh joining up uh uh
[49:35] with a denomination or uh just so many
[49:38] things there but for us our ministry is
[49:42] a Ministry of
[49:43] power and uh if if there's ever a time
[49:47] that the gospel should be preached and
[49:49] this is what uh Jesus told us to do is
[49:52] preach the gospel and we know brother
[49:56] Brandon would and say it's more than
[49:57] just talking but it is a demonstration
[50:01] of the Gospel it is it is dist uh uh
[50:04] demonstration of power uh uh and and so
[50:08] then then we want that power how many
[50:11] wants that power we want to demonstrate
[50:14] that power well the secret to that power
[50:17] is
[50:18] humility uh is humility and and so uh um
[50:23] brother Braham said if if you want Power
[50:27] then see how humble you can get just get
[50:30] away from all your worldly thinking and
[50:33] humble yourself before God then you got
[50:37] more power than the man that runs all
[50:39] over the building and makes a big lot of
[50:41] noise because you have been able to
[50:43] conquer yourself amen so humility comes
[50:48] by a man conquering himself can you say
[50:52] amen amen and and Conquer yourself and
[50:56] commit commit yourself to Christ seed to
[50:58] humble yourself before him that's really
[51:02] power and he goes on show me a church
[51:05] that's humble real humble not arrogancy
[51:07] but a church just a sweet Humble Church
[51:11] I'll show you a church that has the
[51:13] favor and power of God in it that's
[51:16] right that's the thing it takes is
[51:18] humility humbling ourselves before God
[51:21] and letting God just work through US
[51:24] ain't that right amen now humility is
[51:26] not uh uh uh having the complexes you
[51:31] know well I I just you know I just
[51:33] really can't do that and I just you know
[51:35] oh woe is me and and you know that
[51:37] that's not humility at all uh uh but but
[51:41] humility is acknowledging God Amen in
[51:45] all of our ways ain't that right I find
[51:47] a lot of people don't praise because of
[51:48] hum they they lack that real humility
[51:51] Amen to to Really acknowledge God in all
[51:54] their ways and and so uh but God
[51:57] respects humility the prophet said
[51:59] another place he said he dwells in
[52:02] humility another place God humbly glows
[52:06] in hum humility of the believer no
[52:09] matter how ignorant he is amen so uh uh
[52:14] it it it it doesn't take ignorance it
[52:16] takes humility ain't that right and and
[52:20] so uh if it's if it's genuine humility
[52:24] and the true humility then it will
[52:26] always cause a man to seek to please God
[52:30] in everything because that's that's what
[52:33] it is humility acknowledges God and and
[52:37] so uh uh now we know that God died um um
[52:41] Christ died to um to redeem uh mankind
[52:46] to redeem that that elect and and uh
[52:50] that he might have the complete
[52:52] preeminence in the church to express
[52:55] himself through through US ain't that
[52:57] right so God died amen that he could
[53:01] redeem us from the hands of of the enemy
[53:04] that he could take us out from the
[53:06] clutches so we don't have to be a puppet
[53:09] to the devil that we don't have to be a
[53:11] slave to the devil that God himself
[53:14] could have complete preeminence in the
[53:17] church ain't that right now God has not
[53:19] called us to to to fight with him and
[53:23] and to struggle with him and well I'm
[53:26] going to do it my way and you do it your
[53:27] way and and all that I don't believe
[53:29] that's where the church stands today I I
[53:32] believe that God has got a church that
[53:35] he can actually have total preeminence
[53:38] in amen I just I just believe that and
[53:41] and I think that's the desire of the
[53:44] Church of the Living God is that God
[53:46] it's not my will but it's thine be done
[53:50] and how many believes that amen our our
[53:53] desire is for that but but we find that
[53:56] if humility isn't there then then the
[54:00] the thing that takes its place is pride
[54:03] it's it's a it's it's either a display
[54:06] of real humility or or or pride is is in
[54:10] in uh being displayed amen my uh ear
[54:14] things went off I don't know if y was
[54:15] messing with it but uh uh or maybe the
[54:18] battery went out but uh uh so we we find
[54:22] that this is what caused um uh the the
[54:28] uh what happened in the garden or or in
[54:31] in heaven was that Lucifer had set out
[54:35] to establish his own kingdom ain't that
[54:37] right amen set out to establish a throne
[54:41] for himself and we've read this uh
[54:44] before but Isaiah 14 and and 12 it says
[54:49] uh uh how art thou Fallen uh oh uh from
[54:53] Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning and
[54:55] how did thou uh art thou cut down to the
[54:59] ground which did weaken the Nations for
[55:02] thou H has said in thine heart I will
[55:04] Ascend into heaven and I will exalt my
[55:07] throne above the stars of God and I will
[55:10] sit also upon the Mount of the
[55:12] congregation in the sides of the north
[55:14] and I will Ascend above the heights of
[55:17] the clouds and I will be like the most
[55:20] high so there's nothing in consideration
[55:23] of anyone else he's not considering God
[55:26] not glorifying God not not seeking to
[55:29] please God it it was all about himself
[55:32] and and so uh then we we know that it
[55:35] was Pride that caused him to rebel and
[55:39] it it was Pride that caused him to
[55:41] become uh jealous it was Pride that
[55:45] caused him to cease from glorifying God
[55:48] and looking upon himself wanting a
[55:50] better better Kingdom realizing in
[55:53] himself that he can make a better
[55:55] Kingdom and and and it was all self-
[55:57] glory it was all self-exaltation he had
[56:00] literally exalted himself in his heart
[56:04] above God thinking that he was better
[56:06] than God and that he could have a better
[56:08] way than what God could have and so uh
[56:12] uh then but if you look at at Lucifer's
[56:16] position in heaven it was uh it was
[56:19] quite a position that he had uh uh for
[56:23] uh you know uh the prophet said he was
[56:25] God's right-hand man uh so so it wasn't
[56:30] like that he needed something to do uh
[56:34] it wasn't like that he needed to to to
[56:37] make something for himself God had
[56:38] already made it and he gave him the most
[56:41] prestigious position the greatest
[56:43] position above all Angels Above anything
[56:46] else and and the prophet said that God
[56:49] granted him almost co-workers with him
[56:53] he was a coworker part ly equal with God
[56:58] only Satan could not create so so Satan
[57:02] was up there next to God at his rightand
[57:05] man he he was above everything else and
[57:09] and the only thing he could not do was
[57:11] create amen so what a position that
[57:14] would have been but he wasn't satisfied
[57:16] with that position he wanted to do
[57:18] something different and pride actually
[57:21] got him and deceived in thinking he
[57:25] could come up with something better than
[57:27] God but who can come up with anything
[57:29] better than God what position and and
[57:32] and you think of this if if God has
[57:35] given you a position you could do
[57:37] nothing better in any other position
[57:40] than what God has called you to be if
[57:43] God has made you some certain way given
[57:46] you a certain personality a certain gift
[57:49] a certain a certain thing to work with
[57:52] God you can never come up with anything
[57:55] better for yourself
[57:56] than what God has already given you
[57:59] that's right can you say Amen well
[58:01] that's the way with Satan but he got
[58:02] puffed in up in his heart and he wanted
[58:05] something better and he actually thought
[58:08] he could come up with something better
[58:10] and so brother Brown said now see isn't
[58:12] that just the way people get today let
[58:15] God just bless a fell and put a little
[58:18] confidence in him and he gets to be a
[58:20] know- it all he gets to be and then he
[58:23] starts an organization he's got to do
[58:25] something that's different ain't that
[58:27] right and and and you know I've been
[58:29] listening to quite a bit to uh uh
[58:32] several sermons uh but brother brandham
[58:34] had preached the influence of another
[58:37] and and then he just titled it influence
[58:40] and I think he preached it four or five
[58:41] times and and uh you ought to go and
[58:44] listen to them I uh they really spoke to
[58:47] me but uh uh King Uzziah you know uh and
[58:52] and if you want to read about him in the
[58:54] Bible and God really blessed that man uh
[58:57] with with with such a kingdom and he
[59:00] started out very humble he started out
[59:03] acknowledging God he's he was he was
[59:05] trained he was raised up with Godly
[59:07] Parents and and uh he he he wanted to be
[59:12] right he he sought God and therefore God
[59:15] blessed his humility God blessed his his
[59:17] kingdom to where he was he was next to
[59:20] Solomon uh in in in the glory and and
[59:24] and things like that and and so but but
[59:27] through all the things that that God
[59:30] blessed Uzziah with somewhere he he got
[59:34] lifted up in his heart the Bible says
[59:37] and and he he started it it was all
[59:40] getting to his head like man I've really
[59:43] I've really done something here you know
[59:45] and and he he before you know it we find
[59:48] in his end that he tried to take another
[59:51] man's place he tried to take uh the
[59:54] place of the ministry and and so he went
[59:57] in there going to offer up the
[59:59] sacrifices and and just do his little
[1:00:02] thing and and uh uh then when the when
[1:00:06] the ministers came and told him says
[1:00:08] King you can't do that that's not your
[1:00:10] calling uh I've got my we got our
[1:00:13] calling and you got your calling but
[1:00:15] then he got wroth right he got all upset
[1:00:18] and before you know it he he was fulled
[1:00:20] with Leprosy and and uh uh and and
[1:00:24] that's the way he died was uh uh by
[1:00:27] leprosy he died a disgrace amen because
[1:00:31] of uh the what he had done but see he
[1:00:35] wasn't satisfied and the prophet said as
[1:00:38] as a king God blessed him uh uh he
[1:00:42] became a blessing to the people as king
[1:00:46] uh uh he was a blessing and and but when
[1:00:49] he tried to take The Minister's Place
[1:00:51] notice the prophet said he became a
[1:00:54] curse to the people and I thought that
[1:00:56] that how how that speaks to all of us
[1:00:59] here that God has got a place God has
[1:01:02] got a position for us and it it it
[1:01:06] doesn't matter what it is but as long as
[1:01:09] we abide in that place God will bless us
[1:01:13] and we are a blessing to others but when
[1:01:16] we come out of that place and we try to
[1:01:19] do something that God has not called us
[1:01:21] to do then we become a curse to others
[1:01:25] can you say amen now the prophet said
[1:01:27] God has a hard time trying to get
[1:01:30] somebody that he can deal with that'll
[1:01:32] stay humble and meek and stay in the
[1:01:35] place until God calls him to do
[1:01:38] something he said a man that God can
[1:01:40] bless and he'll still still keep himself
[1:01:43] a man and not be an angel or a god see
[1:01:48] as soon as man uh as man gets blessed
[1:01:52] and has a little something given to him
[1:01:54] he wants to become a god
[1:01:56] he wants to become an angel he wants to
[1:01:58] become some great person see what what
[1:02:01] you know what I do it's me and me and
[1:02:04] mine and and all that see that's the
[1:02:07] wrong attitude God's hunting somebody
[1:02:11] who he can bless and pour out the
[1:02:13] blessings and more he bless the little
[1:02:16] the man will
[1:02:18] become ain't that right he said and
[1:02:21] you'll never get more of God until you
[1:02:24] become nothing so so we're not out to
[1:02:27] become something don't don't try to be
[1:02:30] something try to become nothing and and
[1:02:33] that's not belittling yourself in in the
[1:02:35] point that you uh uh you you have all of
[1:02:38] these complexes and and there there's a
[1:02:41] lot of people that just have low uh
[1:02:44] self-esteem that's really not humility
[1:02:47] amen we've got to know that we're
[1:02:48] children of of God we've got to know
[1:02:50] that the we do have power within us we
[1:02:54] we are the royal Seed of Abraham we are
[1:02:57] Sons and Daughters can you say man so
[1:03:00] humility is not belittling yourself
[1:03:03] there there's a lot of uh young people
[1:03:05] that that don't have a lot of uh s Satan
[1:03:08] really works especially with youth um uh
[1:03:12] because they're kind of in no man's land
[1:03:14] and they ain't really got their uh uh uh
[1:03:17] really established in themselves and so
[1:03:20] they're looking for acceptance they're
[1:03:22] they're they're looking for approval and
[1:03:24] and this is why we we call it peer
[1:03:26] pressure you don't you don't find adults
[1:03:29] getting in peer pressure it's usually
[1:03:31] young people that that that gives into
[1:03:33] peer pressure and because they want to
[1:03:35] be identified with something and maybe
[1:03:38] they've got low self-esteem and they
[1:03:40] don't feel like they're anything and
[1:03:42] they they they just they feel so out of
[1:03:44] place and they just you know and that's
[1:03:46] where Satan really talks to to a lot of
[1:03:49] our young people uh uh they'll go off
[1:03:52] into drugs they'll go off that because
[1:03:54] they really have nothing no standards
[1:03:56] they don't really believe in themselves
[1:03:58] you understand what I'm saying girls
[1:04:00] will take just any old God because they
[1:04:01] don't just they just don't believe in
[1:04:04] themselves that they deserve better than
[1:04:06] that or or even guys will do that you
[1:04:08] you understand what I'm saying I think
[1:04:09] we ought to build uh self-esteem in our
[1:04:12] children tell them how important they
[1:04:14] are tell them how nice they look tell
[1:04:16] them uh uh how how of a man they are or
[1:04:19] a woman they are becoming and and and
[1:04:22] really really build them up uh not to
[1:04:25] where it's a prideful not a a a false
[1:04:28] conception amen sure our children got a
[1:04:31] lot of faults but but if if we don't
[1:04:33] just keep uh hammering them on their
[1:04:35] faults and and really remind them just
[1:04:38] how special they really are can you say
[1:04:40] Amen but then there is a humility uh
[1:04:44] that that we all have to have and that
[1:04:46] again that's not belittling that's uh
[1:04:49] ourselves and and and uh not having uh
[1:04:53] you know just self-esteem and and all of
[1:04:55] that just trashing ourselves and all
[1:04:57] that I I don't believe that's that's it
[1:04:59] at all I but I do believe that we've got
[1:05:02] to come to the reality that we are
[1:05:04] nothing without God Amen can you say
[1:05:07] Amen we're nothing without God and and
[1:05:10] and so you true humility is one that
[1:05:13] would acknowledge God see and so uh uh
[1:05:17] we we find he says you've got to get uh
[1:05:20] uh little before you can get big you'll
[1:05:23] never be big in your own self
[1:05:26] how many believes that you'll never be
[1:05:28] big oh but I Got Talent you'll never be
[1:05:31] anything on yourself oh but I can really
[1:05:34] sing and everybody really likes it
[1:05:36] you'll never be nothing on yourself you
[1:05:39] you can sing like an angel but if God's
[1:05:41] not in it it means nothing you you can
[1:05:45] play like moven or or whoever you know
[1:05:48] but if God's not in it it means nothing
[1:05:52] can you say Amen so so then we find that
[1:05:55] you've got to get little before you can
[1:05:57] get big and you'll never be big in
[1:05:59] yourself you'll only be big as God will
[1:06:04] be big in you so how many knows we need
[1:06:07] him we need him it doesn't matter who we
[1:06:11] are it doesn't matter what we need
[1:06:17] him notice what brother Bram said about
[1:06:20] his own Ministry he said God has given
[1:06:22] me a gift that I might maybe do
[1:06:24] something else
[1:06:26] he said see it's it's and he's talking
[1:06:28] about how the difference between his
[1:06:30] ministry and just ministers and he he
[1:06:33] talking about the ministers how they get
[1:06:34] up and preach and they whatever he said
[1:06:36] but God's given me a gift that I I might
[1:06:39] maybe do something else it it's a gift
[1:06:41] of being a Seer or a prophet and or
[1:06:44] whatever you want to call it servant
[1:06:45] with a Divine gift that come on when I
[1:06:48] was a baby about 3 or 4 minutes old when
[1:06:52] mom opened up a little wooden window and
[1:06:55] here it came in see now he says see I
[1:06:58] had nothing to do with it it's God's
[1:07:01] love right now notice what he says if
[1:07:04] IID had had my choice of my Ministry it
[1:07:08] certainly wouldn't have been this now
[1:07:10] you think of that so brother Brown
[1:07:12] saying if I had the choice to choose
[1:07:14] what I wanted to be I wouldn't be this
[1:07:17] what what I am now but God made him that
[1:07:20] way amen and God has made every one of
[1:07:22] us the way we are God's G given us
[1:07:26] something to do amen ain't that right
[1:07:29] see so he says see it would have been
[1:07:31] something else I'd like to have being
[1:07:33] like Mr Baxter a preacher uh uh but this
[1:07:36] is what God wants me to do and I'm happy
[1:07:40] everybody say I'm happy I'm happy to do
[1:07:43] it for him because he's allotted me this
[1:07:47] to do to pray for his sick people now
[1:07:50] ministers don't get the criticism and
[1:07:52] things that we do on this see it's not
[1:07:55] cross it's not the thing that wearies
[1:07:57] you through the night and burden of
[1:08:00] people and so forth your faith don't
[1:08:02] have to go and challenge such as it does
[1:08:05] here see so it' been much popular and
[1:08:08] nicer if I could have just been a
[1:08:10] minister and had great big church
[1:08:12] somewhere and preach the gospel but it
[1:08:15] wasn't my lot ain't that right am so so
[1:08:20] uh uh brother brandham just kind of
[1:08:21] letting us know uh a little bit in his
[1:08:24] heart amen uh but yet now now see uh uh
[1:08:29] Lucifer uh uh God had given him his
[1:08:32] position but he he wasn't satisfied but
[1:08:35] notice he used his influence he used his
[1:08:39] influence in heaven to divide amen he
[1:08:43] used his influence to to take his
[1:08:47] followers away from God can you say amen
[1:08:51] amen that's what Pride does see and so
[1:08:53] he calls 2/3 of the angel to leave their
[1:08:56] place and to follow him you know it's
[1:09:00] it's interesting um uh as as we we know
[1:09:05] that the lid of hell has been lifted
[1:09:07] brother Brown said demons are pouring in
[1:09:10] everywhere it's it's conquering Nations
[1:09:13] and homes and churches it's conquering
[1:09:15] people it's everything and and and have
[1:09:19] you notice what it's causing people to
[1:09:20] do forsake the paths of righteousness
[1:09:24] can you say Amen that's right see and
[1:09:27] and people are now becoming lovers of
[1:09:30] their own selves more than lovers of God
[1:09:34] they're they're exalting Humanity more
[1:09:37] than God himself they're exalting their
[1:09:41] own cre their own uh bylaws their own
[1:09:44] ways their own dogmas amen their own
[1:09:47] teachings and and all of that instead of
[1:09:51] just uh humbling themselves but it's the
[1:09:54] spirit
[1:09:55] that they are anointed with can you say
[1:09:58] Amen the same spirit amen that CS that
[1:10:02] division in heaven is the same spirit in
[1:10:06] the day that we're living in amen the
[1:10:09] devil could not pour himself Out Among
[1:10:12] the people and anoint the people without
[1:10:15] that characteristics being displayed in
[1:10:17] the people that's
[1:10:19] right ain't that right so this has to do
[1:10:23] with the influence that they're under
[1:10:26] but if you notice that Lucifer he he
[1:10:28] didn't care about what happened to the
[1:10:30] other angels that followed him he didn't
[1:10:33] care that that he would cause them to to
[1:10:36] leave their own estate he didn't care
[1:10:39] about even the woman in the garden amen
[1:10:42] uh there she had perfect Fellowship her
[1:10:45] and her husband fellowship with God but
[1:10:47] he didn't care about that he didn't care
[1:10:50] that he would break that peace away and
[1:10:53] that Fellowship from God and he didn't
[1:10:56] care that that of what would happen to
[1:10:58] mankind when Adam fell he didn't care
[1:11:02] about any of them things can you say
[1:11:05] amen he doesn't care about Humanity
[1:11:08] being ruined and broken and devastated
[1:11:12] amen that's what Pride does doesn't care
[1:11:15] about the millions that are being
[1:11:17] deceived in this age and by his own
[1:11:20] trickeries and lies all he wants is his
[1:11:25] own own
[1:11:26] kingdom you believe that all he wants is
[1:11:30] his own kingdom it it amazes me how that
[1:11:33] God would would would would so vindicate
[1:11:37] the The Prophet's message even having
[1:11:39] his picture taken with that man and yet
[1:11:42] there will be ministers arise and try to
[1:11:44] diminish that and and and say well it's
[1:11:47] this and it's that yeah all it is to me
[1:11:50] is a spirit that started in the
[1:11:52] beginning to take away our faith to to
[1:11:55] take away our worship to take away our
[1:11:58] confidence in the god that confirmed
[1:12:00] this
[1:12:02] message
[1:12:04] amen according
[1:12:08] to 2 Thessalonians 2 and 3 we all know
[1:12:12] it but says he opposeth talking of Satan
[1:12:15] opposeth and exalteth himself above all
[1:12:18] that is called God or that is worship so
[1:12:20] that he as God sth in the temple of God
[1:12:22] showing himself that he is God and that
[1:12:25] right so Satan through his pride he will
[1:12:27] deceive Millions just to achieve his
[1:12:30] goal and this is what's happening and
[1:12:33] and and pride is is what caused him to
[1:12:35] do this and according uh to 1
[1:12:38] Corinthians 11:14 Satan transforms
[1:12:41] himself into an angel of Light and his
[1:12:44] ministers are transformed as Ministers
[1:12:47] of righteousness so he's religious as
[1:12:49] can be and has a Ministry ain't that
[1:12:52] right but but but the heart of it all is
[1:12:55] pride pride is at the the core of that
[1:12:58] Ministry amen and and so we know that
[1:13:01] Satan can impersonate any gift that
[1:13:03] God's got he can preach the gospel he
[1:13:06] can perform the Miracles he can prophesy
[1:13:09] speak with tongues of men and angels
[1:13:11] dream dreams operate in the Supernatural
[1:13:14] realm amen and because remember they
[1:13:16] said Lord Lord have we not cast out
[1:13:18] Devils have we not prophesied have we
[1:13:19] not all these things right amen he can
[1:13:22] sing testify play music hold an office
[1:13:24] in the the church be a part of the
[1:13:26] five-fold ministry he can even display
[1:13:28] the fruits of the spirit Amen brother
[1:13:30] Bram said if you want to just go by the
[1:13:32] fruits of the spirit compare Jesus with
[1:13:34] the priest and you'll find that the
[1:13:35] priest actually showed more amen
[1:13:38] especially on that day when he whipped
[1:13:40] them when he whipped them uh out of the
[1:13:42] temple can you say amen amen see there
[1:13:45] there but but one thing he cannot do he
[1:13:48] cannot the prophet said bring that word
[1:13:51] word by word that's God can you say Amen
[1:13:55] amen that that's the thing that God sets
[1:13:57] his church on that's that's what he sets
[1:13:59] his a kingdom on Amen is the word of God
[1:14:03] and Satan cannot bring that word word by
[1:14:07] word he'll bring most of it but he won't
[1:14:10] he won't bring it all the way through
[1:14:12] and that's the deception so you can have
[1:14:15] any of the gifts of God without having
[1:14:18] God the prophet said and God is love
[1:14:21] amen ain't that right so then what we
[1:14:25] see in the ministry of Christ is
[1:14:28] humility amen again people think that U
[1:14:34] humility is is like being a
[1:14:37] pushover one who agrees with everything
[1:14:39] you say and can't stand on his own
[1:14:41] convictions and and um and and they call
[1:14:45] that
[1:14:47] humility but brother BR said that's not
[1:14:49] true he said Jesus was the humblest man
[1:14:52] that ever walked on the Earth but he
[1:14:53] wasn't so humble that he could bring
[1:14:56] correction he said and you you can be
[1:14:58] too humble see you can get so humble
[1:15:01] until the devil will you make a puppet
[1:15:03] out of you ain't that right he said he
[1:15:07] was humble and to washing the disciples
[1:15:09] feet he was forgiving enough to pray for
[1:15:12] those who drove spikes into his hands
[1:15:14] amen but when he saw wrong going on in
[1:15:18] the church he was man enough to Plate
[1:15:20] ropes and to run the money changers out
[1:15:23] of the house ain't that right another
[1:15:26] place Jesus loved the people he even
[1:15:28] gave his life there for those Pharisees
[1:15:31] that were crucifying him and he prayed
[1:15:33] for their forgiveness but yet he said
[1:15:36] you Generation of Vipers Snakes in the
[1:15:38] Grass and so forth like that see he
[1:15:40] wasn't exactly talking to the being that
[1:15:43] human being it was a spirit that he was
[1:15:46] talking to he said just look at Peter
[1:15:49] coming behind him said Lord you can't do
[1:15:51] that see and he turned around says get
[1:15:54] thee behind me Satan Thou Art always an
[1:15:56] offense to me well he wasn't speaking to
[1:15:59] Peter see he wasn't speaking to that he
[1:16:01] was the Fountain of Truth and it was a
[1:16:03] spirit that was on that apostle that was
[1:16:06] making him say that hello see he wasn't
[1:16:10] speaking to Peter he loved him he loved
[1:16:12] him and know he was to be the head of
[1:16:14] the church at Jerusalem he wasn't going
[1:16:17] to speak back to Peter he was speaking
[1:16:19] to the spirit that was causing Peter to
[1:16:22] hinder The Works of God
[1:16:26] yes amazing how Spirits get on
[1:16:29] people and then then they think oh
[1:16:32] you're correcting me it's not that it's
[1:16:34] the
[1:16:35] spirit it's the spirit that's trying to
[1:16:38] bring division it's the spirit that is
[1:16:40] trying to
[1:16:44] work sometimes it's a spirit that tries
[1:16:47] to get us to think that we're
[1:16:48] nothing it's a spirit that gets people
[1:16:51] disgruntled gets unsat dissatisfied
[1:16:54] right thinking I need to go do something
[1:16:56] else no just stay in your position amen
[1:17:00] can you say Amen we got a
[1:17:04] Ministry
[1:17:06] Lord so Jesus wasn't so humble that
[1:17:10] Satan would make a a puppet out of
[1:17:13] him but he was humble to where he would
[1:17:16] do nothing but the father's will can you
[1:17:20] say amen and not his own John 5:30 Jesus
[1:17:24] said I can of my own self do nothing as
[1:17:28] I hear I judge and my judgment is just
[1:17:30] because I seek not my own will but the
[1:17:33] will of the Father which sent me amen
[1:17:36] John 6:38 for I came down from heaven
[1:17:39] not to do my own will but the will of
[1:17:41] him that sent me can you say Amen so see
[1:17:44] his ministry was a true Ministry because
[1:17:46] it wasn't founded upon
[1:17:48] Pride amen this is why Jesus prayed
[1:17:51] often that's right he was a man of
[1:17:53] prayer he prayed often why
[1:17:55] because he knew that it wasn't him he
[1:17:58] needed an
[1:18:00] auctioning amen the Lord hello so
[1:18:04] brother Bram says he prayed to the God
[1:18:05] that was within him
[1:18:08] amenallah what's the display of real
[1:18:12] humility how how he was
[1:18:15] God and and none other than God in human
[1:18:20] flesh and and God showing how how the
[1:18:25] humility because God is the author of
[1:18:27] humility I believe and he comes in a
[1:18:31] human body not seeking recognition right
[1:18:36] amen not seeking Glory right he comes in
[1:18:41] a way that he hides
[1:18:43] himself right he didn't come to have his
[1:18:46] name among the Great Men of the earth he
[1:18:50] didn't come in a display of arrogancy
[1:18:52] and pride but came in humility and in
[1:18:57] weakness right it he come the Bible says
[1:19:00] he spoke a Common Language among Common
[1:19:04] People amen right so he didn't speak the
[1:19:07] language of dignitaries and theologians
[1:19:09] he didn't come as a rich man flaunting
[1:19:12] his wealth he had no home he had no
[1:19:14] place to lay his head the prophet said
[1:19:17] at his birth he had to borrow a Manger
[1:19:19] right at his death he had a borrow a
[1:19:22] grave ain't that right and yet he was
[1:19:25] God he was so humble and meek that the
[1:19:28] people didn't recognize him as God
[1:19:31] that's right they crucified him for
[1:19:32] saying he was God
[1:19:34] Amen right yes sir see and and and so uh
[1:19:39] uh and the people that did recognize him
[1:19:41] as God it took a revelation amen Jesus
[1:19:45] even told him who do men say that I the
[1:19:47] son of man am and and some of them
[1:19:50] repeating everybody else what they said
[1:19:52] and some say you're a prophet and some
[1:19:53] say you're this some but who do you say
[1:19:55] that I am and and Peter stood up there
[1:19:58] Christ the son of the Living God right
[1:20:01] took him all the way past Abraham even
[1:20:04] all the way to the
[1:20:07] beginning Jesus said Flesh and Blood
[1:20:09] could not reveal this to you Peter it
[1:20:11] was my Father which is in heaven hath
[1:20:13] revealed it took a revelation ain't that
[1:20:15] right see and so that was the only way
[1:20:17] that that the people could recognize him
[1:20:20] amen but he displayed the attributes and
[1:20:23] the character istics of God he
[1:20:26] manifested the power of God and yet he
[1:20:29] did not make a reputation for
[1:20:34] himself he didn't do what he did to have
[1:20:37] a
[1:20:39] following
[1:20:43] right if he was doing it for that reason
[1:20:46] he he probably would have compromised on
[1:20:49] his
[1:20:50] teachings CU remember he said except you
[1:20:53] eat the Flesh of the and drink the blood
[1:20:54] blood or or drink the blood and eat the
[1:20:56] Flesh of the son of man you have no life
[1:20:58] in you and because of that saying they
[1:21:01] walked away from him saying this is a
[1:21:03] hard saying brother BR said they were
[1:21:05] thinking he was a vampire how we going
[1:21:07] to eat
[1:21:08] him but did he change it no brother Ram
[1:21:11] said he actually said it to weed down
[1:21:13] his crowd so he wasn't after a
[1:21:16] following right right see and and and
[1:21:20] and so then then he turns around after
[1:21:22] they they leave him and he looks at his
[1:21:25] disciples and he gives them the
[1:21:26] opportunity to leave as well see if he
[1:21:29] was after a falling he wouldn't have
[1:21:30] even given them the opportunity to
[1:21:33] leave because that's not the way men do
[1:21:36] who are trying to build a kingdom unto
[1:21:39] themselves I thought brother Brahman
[1:21:41] said in every case you will notice that
[1:21:43] a false prophet is one who is outside
[1:21:45] the word just as we showed you that
[1:21:47] Antichrist means anti- so these false
[1:21:50] prophets come perverting the word giving
[1:21:52] it a meaning that fits their own
[1:21:54] devilish ends and have you ever noticed
[1:21:57] how the people who lead others astray
[1:21:59] bind them closely to themselves by fear
[1:22:02] they say if the people don't do what
[1:22:04] they say or if they leave then
[1:22:06] destruction will follow see they are
[1:22:09] false prophets for a true Prophet will
[1:22:11] always lead one to the word and bind the
[1:22:14] people to Jesus Christ he won't tell the
[1:22:18] people to fear Him or what he says but
[1:22:21] to fear what the word says can you say
[1:22:23] Amen see so so we find that that it it
[1:22:27] it takes a real humility that uh uh for
[1:22:31] Ministry because God wants to use us he
[1:22:35] he he wants to reflect his power through
[1:22:37] US amen but but he's got to have a
[1:22:40] people that don't get puffed up amen you
[1:22:43] got to have a people that don't get it
[1:22:45] in their heads that you know what we're
[1:22:46] the one that's making this thing Run
[1:22:48] come
[1:22:49] on you got to have a h have a people
[1:22:53] that that knows how to wait upon him and
[1:22:56] say God you use me any
[1:23:01] time you know we're not wasting our time
[1:23:03] just waiting on the
[1:23:05] Lord I think more people are wasting
[1:23:07] their time by not waiting on the Lord
[1:23:10] amen prophesying when the Lord doesn't
[1:23:14] prophesy doing things that the Lord
[1:23:16] hadn't
[1:23:18] done and why they're doing all of this
[1:23:20] and God's not saying anything right
[1:23:24] that's the waste of
[1:23:26] time yeah that's
[1:23:28] right you love the Lord I think a lot of
[1:23:32] times we don't see a lot of things you
[1:23:34] know now in
[1:23:35] Pentecost there was prophecies going
[1:23:38] forth almost every service always
[1:23:41] someone having a dream always someone in
[1:23:44] Visions always someone
[1:23:47] prophesying
[1:23:49] always coming to the message you don't
[1:23:51] see that a lot right
[1:23:56] now you know I believe that all of that
[1:23:58] is right I believe in
[1:24:02] gifts but I think the reason why it's
[1:24:04] slowed down is because there is a people
[1:24:07] that actually are learning to
[1:24:09] wait cuz a lot was being spoke that God
[1:24:12] ain't
[1:24:14] spoke a lot of things was being done in
[1:24:17] the name of the Lord that it was not God
[1:24:20] hate to say it but it's just the truth
[1:24:23] we went by emotion it was going by
[1:24:25] feelings it was going by unctions or or
[1:24:28] impression the prophet would call that
[1:24:32] impression hello amen see in other words
[1:24:35] getting ahead of God doing something
[1:24:37] that God wasn't in doing something
[1:24:39] saying something that God wasn't saying
[1:24:42] that's exactly what the devil was able
[1:24:43] to do hello get a church that was acting
[1:24:48] outside of God's
[1:24:49] will but we've got a a people by the
[1:24:53] message of The Hour That is learning
[1:24:56] just to Simply humble themselves and
[1:24:59] wait am God gave the gift so that he can
[1:25:04] use that gift God gave the talent so he
[1:25:08] could use that
[1:25:10] Talent right
[1:25:13] amen don't do it for vain glory
[1:25:16] amen whatever God gives you to do it's
[1:25:21] needed only if God is in
[1:25:25] it if God is using it that's what we
[1:25:27] want right that's that's what we want
[1:25:31] see so we we find brother Brown says I
[1:25:34] do not think that we should ever by any
[1:25:36] means ever try to judge a person by the
[1:25:38] denomination they belong to or by the
[1:25:40] group that they are assembled with
[1:25:43] whether they be Methodist Baptist
[1:25:44] Presbyterian or Pentecost or whatever
[1:25:46] they are we should never judge the men
[1:25:48] by the denomination that he belongs to
[1:25:50] we should always judge him by the spirit
[1:25:52] he has see whether is latter rain former
[1:25:55] rain inner outer rain or no rain
[1:25:59] whatever it might be we should never
[1:26:01] judge him by that but by his Spirit
[1:26:04] everybody say by his Spirit see we are
[1:26:06] to discern
[1:26:07] Spirits watch what the man has in mind
[1:26:10] watch what he's trying to achieve if the
[1:26:13] man by a gift no matter how great that
[1:26:16] gift is can you say Amen now if you look
[1:26:20] in in Ephesians 4:7 and I'll get ready
[1:26:22] to close but to every one of us is given
[1:26:26] Grace according to the measure of the
[1:26:29] gift of
[1:26:30] Christ can you sayen that whatever God
[1:26:34] has given you to do there's Grace for
[1:26:37] that try to do it outside of that
[1:26:40] there's no Grace you'll
[1:26:44] fail there's a lot of people try to be
[1:26:46] like brother brandham yeah and they and
[1:26:49] they had had nervous breakdowns oh wow
[1:26:51] even in in brother bram's day
[1:26:55] they they they were falling
[1:26:57] apart no man could ever do what brother
[1:26:59] brandom done it was Grace upon that
[1:27:04] man ain't that right and thank the Lord
[1:27:07] he didn't get exalted above
[1:27:20] it when he ascended up on high he led
[1:27:24] captivity captive and gave gifts
[1:27:26] everybody say gave gifts unto
[1:27:30] men there are men who have the ability
[1:27:32] to preach and to teach there are people
[1:27:36] that have the the gift of of to to play
[1:27:39] music to
[1:27:41] sing some have the gift to be officers
[1:27:44] in the
[1:27:45] church whether it be Deacon trustee or
[1:27:49] Treasurer or even even Sunday School
[1:27:54] teacher not everybody can be a Sunday
[1:27:56] school teacher take someone with the
[1:27:58] gift to be able to get down to their
[1:28:00] level and and bring the Simplicity of
[1:28:03] the
[1:28:04] Gospel can you say Amen but God has
[1:28:08] given gifts to to to his body to uh to
[1:28:14] where you know that that people can
[1:28:16] actually be what Paul called to be and
[1:28:19] that is helps in the church amen now
[1:28:24] notice of all gifts I I don't care how
[1:28:27] small it may seem or or how big it may
[1:28:31] be that for one there's no great ones
[1:28:33] Among
[1:28:35] Us not in the body that's
[1:28:39] right but the reason the prophet said
[1:28:42] for God giving gifts is to Magnify Him
[1:28:47] Lord not magnify us but to Magnify Him
[1:28:51] and to unify the people
[1:28:54] PA well what are we going to unify them
[1:28:57] around us
[1:28:59] no unify them around the word of
[1:29:02] God can you say Amen to bring the body
[1:29:07] together and to help us to unite our
[1:29:10] efforts and our
[1:29:12] prayers see so these gifts that are
[1:29:15] given to
[1:29:17] us are for to work for him work for him
[1:29:22] how many wants to work for our Lord
[1:29:25] man I want to work for our Lord I don't
[1:29:27] want to work for Shawn
[1:29:29] Martin cuz we fail right I want to work
[1:29:33] for him you can never be a failure when
[1:29:36] you're working for
[1:29:37] him ain't that right that's right so so
[1:29:41] God knew we were going to need his gifts
[1:29:43] brother BR said he gave us the gift of
[1:29:45] the Holy Ghost because we were going to
[1:29:46] need it he gave us the gift of Divine
[1:29:49] Healing he said now you know should we
[1:29:52] practice Divine Healing when we got the
[1:29:54] best doctors in the world God Gave You
[1:29:56] Divine Healing cuz he knows you have to
[1:29:59] use it he gave you the gifts of the
[1:30:02] Spirit ain't that right another place
[1:30:04] said they tried to tell us that years
[1:30:06] ago that there was no such thing as
[1:30:08] speaking with tongues and prophecy and
[1:30:10] all these great gifts that God promised
[1:30:12] in the early church and gave to them
[1:30:14] them days have passed he said you think
[1:30:16] that stopped that hungry-heart people
[1:30:19] they took a hold of this word and know
[1:30:21] that the Bible said the promises unto
[1:30:24] you and to your children and to them
[1:30:26] that's far off even as many as the Lord
[1:30:28] Our God shall call and they stayed on
[1:30:31] their knees and cried and begged and
[1:30:34] kipped up their heels and screamed until
[1:30:36] God poured out the same Holy Ghost upon
[1:30:38] them that he did uh uh on them at the
[1:30:43] beginning we have them trying to take
[1:30:45] Gifts of Pastor Prophet evangelist
[1:30:48] teacher the fivefold ministry the Min
[1:30:51] missionary out of the church God's never
[1:30:54] done that he placed them gifts in the
[1:30:57] church amen hallelujah he also gave the
[1:31:01] to the church nine spiritual gifts you
[1:31:04] see without these things we have no
[1:31:06] Ministry amen you might as well pass
[1:31:09] Donuts around or
[1:31:12] something but we have the nine spiritual
[1:31:15] gifts wisdom knowledge speaking in
[1:31:17] tongues Gifts of healing interpretation
[1:31:19] of tongues and so forth nine spiritual
[1:31:21] gifts all everybody say all
[1:31:24] to show his love towards the
[1:31:28] church that he wants you to stay in
[1:31:33] order it's not so well oh that guy's a
[1:31:36] prophet man he can prophesy and he's all
[1:31:39] the time prophesy wow that's cool that's
[1:31:42] nothing to do with that
[1:31:44] man that's a
[1:31:46] gift that God will
[1:31:48] use for our benefit for the benefit of
[1:31:52] the church
[1:31:55] can you say Amen see the great he says
[1:31:58] he want that he wants you to stay in
[1:31:59] order see the great Holy Spirit himself
[1:32:02] being the tutor of the church another
[1:32:06] place these gifts are given to edify
[1:32:08] everybody say to edify or to keep
[1:32:11] together now do you understand why Paul
[1:32:14] would tell us that no prophesying
[1:32:16] without an interpreter
[1:32:19] right on amen he said if everybody would
[1:32:22] speak in tongues and there was someone
[1:32:24] that was ignorant of all this stuff that
[1:32:25] look and think you all
[1:32:27] mad why it's not for our edification
[1:32:31] that's
[1:32:32] right we've got a
[1:32:36] Ministry brother BR say well they they
[1:32:38] you say well I just can't hold it yes
[1:32:40] you can hold
[1:32:42] it you
[1:32:46] can
[1:32:48] amen so he said these gifts are to edify
[1:32:51] or to keep together not to not to divide
[1:32:54] not to bring confusion that's right
[1:32:57] amen and to melt together the one big
[1:33:01] body of the
[1:33:03] Lord another place he set set gifts in
[1:33:06] his church to bring his church together
[1:33:08] to keep it coordinated to work for the
[1:33:11] good of his
[1:33:12] church another place nine spir different
[1:33:15] spiritual gifts should be operating in
[1:33:17] the church to keep the church
[1:33:20] clean
[1:33:21] hello notice how these gifts to bring it
[1:33:24] he said just like ananas and safaris and
[1:33:27] so forth the spirit of God rise up and
[1:33:29] call somebody else and tell them they're
[1:33:30] living wrong and rebuke that sin
[1:33:33] openly that's what the holy spirit is in
[1:33:35] the church for to keep the church clean
[1:33:37] and ready for the coming of the Lord
[1:33:40] right praise the Lord and the Holy
[1:33:43] Spirit is to operate these gifts can you
[1:33:45] say Amen now church I truly believe that
[1:33:48] there is a people that are
[1:33:49] humble yes sir to where God can have
[1:33:52] preeminence that these gifts can operate
[1:33:55] right the Lord because really it's not
[1:33:57] for us to serve ourselves even in
[1:33:59] speaking in tongues he said you Paul
[1:34:01] said you pray in the secret and you
[1:34:02] speak in tongues that's edifying
[1:34:04] yourself you're speaking that before
[1:34:07] God hello Amen brother brah says the
[1:34:10] same thing over and over and
[1:34:13] over but it takes
[1:34:16] humility because CU it's it's the humble
[1:34:19] person that seeks to to do only the will
[1:34:21] of the father and the only do as the
[1:34:24] father shows them and and and I know
[1:34:27] that that bride this people is upon the
[1:34:29] Earth and I believe that we're here in
[1:34:30] this there there part of that is in this
[1:34:33] assembly tonight where the Prophet said
[1:34:35] the word is in the bride they do only
[1:34:38] his will they have thus said the Lord
[1:34:41] that they keep
[1:34:42] silent yall know the
[1:34:48] quote
[1:34:50] now the prophet said the Holy Spirit
[1:34:53] freely sets these gifts in the church
[1:34:55] and they perfectly everybody say
[1:34:57] perfectly
[1:34:59] operate if you just won't get excited
[1:35:02] and try to take what you think
[1:35:04] yourself that's where people make
[1:35:06] mistakes and I find that among the
[1:35:08] people that somebody gets all influenced
[1:35:10] and kind of hepped up a little by the
[1:35:13] Holy Spirit see which it's wonderful
[1:35:15] stimulated but there's someone will come
[1:35:17] to you and say does the Lord say so and
[1:35:19] so and you don't have to give them that
[1:35:22] answer
[1:35:24] you don't have to give them an answer
[1:35:26] can you say amen that's right don't you
[1:35:29] say it unless God says it then you've
[1:35:32] got thus sayi the Lord then nothing can
[1:35:35] keep it from happening it's just got to
[1:35:38] happen he said I'd take anybody to
[1:35:41] church tonight you've never heard the
[1:35:43] Holy Spirit speak in the meetings of
[1:35:45] thus sayth the Lord but what had
[1:35:46] happened exactly that way exactly out of
[1:35:50] the millions of
[1:35:51] cases it's absolutely has to be
[1:35:55] right ain't that right if the Holy
[1:35:58] Spirit would come and say to me by
[1:36:00] Vision I want you to go to the
[1:36:03] presidential graveyard tomorrow I'm
[1:36:05] going to bring up George Wasington he
[1:36:07] said I'd invite the whole world to come
[1:36:08] and see it done it it could have it
[1:36:11] could have to happen for the Holy Ghost
[1:36:13] said so that makes it the truth but
[1:36:15] until he says that you just wait you
[1:36:18] know you're saved you know you're filled
[1:36:20] with his goodness you know see how if he
[1:36:24] is in you he'll act his life out in you
[1:36:27] so just be
[1:36:31] satisfied can you say that with me be
[1:36:33] satisfied
[1:36:34] satisfi just be satisfied he wants to
[1:36:37] use you sure he'll sure do it he knows
[1:36:42] where you're at amen can you say Amen
[1:36:45] Lord you love the Lord amen see it's not
[1:36:48] for Vang Glory what what Ministry it's
[1:36:51] you know brother R he would say in this
[1:36:53] place he says I'm here tonight to try to
[1:36:55] help you to have a solid faith in Jesus
[1:36:59] Christ by the gift of the Divine a gift
[1:37:02] coming from God which was given to me
[1:37:04] allotted by grace of the Lord to
[1:37:06] manifest Jesus Christ to you in his love
[1:37:10] that's why I'm here tonight is to help
[1:37:12] you to believe on him I think that's
[1:37:15] what every gift ought to do every one of
[1:37:18] us true is we're here to get the people
[1:37:21] to
[1:37:21] believe we're here to get the sinner to
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:27] believe you believe that well then if
[1:37:30] we're going to watch what we do in the
[1:37:31] church we got to watch what we do
[1:37:33] outside the
[1:37:35] church amen be the example the example
[1:37:39] of a real
[1:37:41] believer that's
[1:37:44] right amen you love him am amen if the
[1:37:48] musicians will
[1:37:52] come
[1:37:59] today most people judge Men
[1:38:03] by the gift he
[1:38:06] has and they are god-given
[1:38:10] gifts but the prophet says but if we do
[1:38:13] not use them in the right way that God
[1:38:14] intended them to be used then we can do
[1:38:17] more harm with the gifts than we could
[1:38:19] if we did not have the gifts amen ain't
[1:38:24] that right yeah we could do more harm
[1:38:27] with the gift than we could without the
[1:38:30] gift think about he said I would rather
[1:38:33] see Brotherly Love existing among the
[1:38:35] church if we didn't have one case of
[1:38:38] healing or anything else we must know
[1:38:42] what these things are
[1:38:44] for amen can you say amen
[1:38:48] amen you love the
[1:38:51] Lord may God help us
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:56] not to serve or not
[1:38:59] to operate for vain
[1:39:02] Glory but help us to be
[1:39:05] conscience of our
[1:39:07] littleness right of our need for him for
[1:39:10] Jesus says without me you can do nothing
[1:39:13] yes and what does that mean what what
[1:39:16] what does that put us in it puts us in
[1:39:19] desperation God not my will but thy will
[1:39:21] be
[1:39:22] done should cause us to
[1:39:24] pray it should cause us to keep our
[1:39:27] spirit
[1:39:28] quietened it should cause us to think
[1:39:31] twice before we act before we speak
[1:39:35] before we
[1:39:36] respond God let me respond with Grace
