you this uh weekend is it this weekend uh yeah last weekend I thought you had a camp meeting or something that you're getting ready to preach at oh beginning of August okay for some reason I thought it was this weekend but we still won't pray for brother Amos amen Lord will help him amen and uh the Lord and we uh uh glad he's been able to uh get out and preach and you know the people of God need good preaching good preachers and um and so I know he and sister Lisa have been a blessing as they've traveled around and but here Mark the 11th chapter and we're very familiar with this scripture reading but the 12th verse it says and on the moral when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it then the 19th verse says and when even was come he went out of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remember and saith unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou cursed is withered away and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things so ever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them what a promise amen let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father truly you're moving among the Earth we see that sin is is spreading rapidly and in the world is getting so evil father and you you predicted it would happen it would be this way but Lord we also are a people that that see your hand and you're Supernatural being is present with us father we're so glad for that Lord and this is why we could come together tonight Lord on a Wednesday night under great expectation that you'll be here with us father you promise where two or three are gathered in your name you would be here and Lord we're just now asking that you would have the preeminence in this part of the service anoint Lord the gift that you placed within me help me to get myself out of the way and anoint the people their hearts their ears to hear and receive we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seats this evening and last Wednesday we preached on the subject the power of faith and I I want to continue with that subject and as I stated last Wednesday and we all know it but God God has meant for his people to be a people of authority and uh people of power and um just to look back and and go reminisce of things but in the beginning a man was made to be a god brother Brahm said he's absolutely a god and because he was made in the image of God and we can find that in Genesis he is a Son of God and if he's a Son of God then he's heir to all things uh heir of all that God is and so man was given a domain and that domain was the Earth and God gave him power over the fish the fowl of the air he gave him power over all things of all creation and and he could just speak and everything would obey him what a what a position to be in what a power to be to have and and so God is God Of Heaven and Earth he's God of the universe but Adam he was the ruler in his domain and brother Branham called him a king ruler man was King ruler and so even though uh man has fallen yet he still has that appearance he's still there's something about him and and brother Branham talks about how that uh uh man has light and and of course science has discovered this uh and that's how they're able to do the x-rays and that brother Brown said that we were born with four lights a rays of light and it's in our body and and when we reach he says the age of 20 to 25 then one of those Rays go out and then when we reach 35 or 40 or so another ray goes out and and when we get you know uh past 65 well he said we're we're living on our last ray of light uh there and and so uh he he says every time you take an x-ray picture uh you're tearing down them rays that are in your body and he said that's the reason you don't have no more you stick these kids feet in the machines and because it was just tearing the Rays right out of their little body and and so he he goes on and he talks of how that we are full of light cells and which is Cosmic light and and uh and that's what we have as a human being but then the Bible says that God is light and he's a Different Light than Cosmic light it's a it's a different thing and and so and this is what puts us in connection uh here it calls brother Branham says when we're walking in light of God in in in God's light he says see uh as sons of God now you can't just walk in the light of God and not walk as sons of God Amen so when when that light said God comes inside of us it's not a cosmic light then it's it's a different light that that is God and we are sons of God and so he says see God is Not Cosmic light but God's light operated through the cosmic light of our bodies ourselves see he said we're absolutely we were absolutely at one time real genuine sons of God you believe that we were absolutely at one time real genuine sons of God Amen but see sin has had an effect upon uh uh the human uh kind and and upon man to where he's nothing today like God made him to be and and and so brother Branham describes it it's like a seaweed you get in the bottom of a seed a lot of times divers this is they'll get under the the seaweed and before they know it they're wrapped in such a way they can't get out of it well that's what sin has done to the human being that's what communism has done to the Nations that's what that's that's what coldness has done to the church see it's it's intertwined sin has intertwined and a man to where he can't get out of it and and and so uh brother Brown says and then in the human body see it wrapped us he says and it's pushing out this light of God see by denominations and denying faith and so forth uh so forth It's pushed out all the Rays of God's great power of Faith that's in us that should be ain't that right amen see we weren't made to be uh the way we were born in sin and shaping a nickel we weren't made to uh to wallow in sin we we were made to have God's rays of light shine through us a man see and so but but he said see but but slowly uh since the beginning of time it's it's been in uh entwined man and and make it him powerless and and hopeless and and all of these things and he says see they pushed out all those the the Rays in such a place till all we've got is just the lodge and Satan no power of God moving no Supernatural moving no presence of God in the place anymore they're uh uh you talk about the fruits of the spirit it's it's gone from the church you're talking about the attributes of God it's gone from the church to where it's just a lodge amen and he says see now then below the lodge the church is because it's just pushed all all Darkness out and even and and even saying it doesn't happen see denying that it could happen the miracles of god they don't believe that the miracles of god can happen they don't believe uh uh so we set up the psychology we set up uh uh marriage programs we set up the AAA and we set up all these programs of human trying to help human and and look at the mess we've gotten in uh we we've exalted politics so high and every man is disappointed by it amen and and and then we've we we've exalted the the the the sports and we've elevated that them up and and all that made Gods out of him and all that but when it comes to God himself being God then who he is we don't believe in any of that the churches don't believe that see and and and so and and how far different that was from from Adam when he walked the Earth and and so so brother Brown says man has something weighed down inside of him to where if he can only let that light grow and he he talked about that light being like a little old button you know uh he said when a man is saved see he said a little bit of him is is is of God or is God see so when a man repents and he gets the Holy Ghost and he well a little bit of that of of of man is God see now God come inside of him he said that's the little light that comes in to make him quit doing things that are wrong see and and so he says if that man can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out well that little button-like of the light and power of God will keep growing and growing and growing and growing see you it will crowd out all the unbelief ain't that right and this is why we we come to church that's why it's important to come to church that's why it's important to get into the the things of God why we want to get all of that unbelief all that stuff out and if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got the power to do it amen if you've got the Holy Ghost there's something in there that wants to grow and grow and you let that grow then it'll push out everything else that is not like God ain't that right and he says now you don't do that you don't crowd out this unbelief and growing the light growing and all that you don't do it by exhortations of bodily exercise he said you do it by a Sanctified consecrated life that the holy spirit moves through you ain't that right so we need the Holy Spirit to move through us uh uh mightier than ever before amen that's right see let that Holy Spirit grow that light and and so now having said that I believe that God has never intended for us to be victims amen a victim I I looked up that word victim it's someone or something that has been hurt damaged or killed or has suffered either because of the actions of someone or something else or because of illness or a chance uh these things so that's that's a victim uh uh to where you know you get hurt and and you get wounded you're damaged and suffered and and all of these things well I I now all of us right now we can all say we have been a target of the devil amen ever since our birth we've been a Target whether it's been in the physical whether it's been in the spiritual uh uh mental or whatever there we've been targeted see but when God saved us when God saved us he delivered us out of the hands of the enemy do you believe that how many been delivered from the hand of the enemy amen see he delivered us from the hand of the enemy to where Satan can't touch us again now he can touch us physically if God allows him to uh to where you know he can he can we suffer pain or whatever but I'm going to just talk about that that that emotionally I'm talking about spiritually I'm talking about that that inward man a man to where Satan can't touch us again you see God doesn't want us to live the Christian Life dwelling on our hurts can you say Amen and and I find more and more and more people talking about hurts and and and and and and they thrive on that and and when I say they thrive on that it's it's almost like an excuse not to go anymore with God they use that as an excuse to not to believe in Ministry anymore they use it as an excuse a man to not go to church anymore they use it as a as an excuse Amen to we're not not to involve themselves in the in the church anymore they they use it as an excuse not to put their all into the things of God anymore and and it will hurt I used to I've been hurt I've been this and I've been stomped on I've been all of these things well you know uh uh that's not even living the Christian life amen when we're dwelling on hurts when we're dwelling on our wounds when we're dwelling on in all the negative about life that's not living a Christian Life a man because uh there's positive in Christianity that's all there is brother Brown said there's no negativity in Christianity ain't that right see so we've all been hurt at some point in our lives amen and and and I'm sure we could all raise our hands on that in in some way if if even even before you got saved if you're going to do anything for God you're going to get hurt if you're going to uh you can get hurt by your own in in your marriage you can get hurt by your own family in your in your with your children you you can get hurt by your parents you can get hurt by by anything it's just we're subject to them things ain't that right but see Satan is good at what he does and he tries to bring these things upon us but what he does is not permanent not to a Believer not to a Christian amen his work is not permanent ain't that right amen see I I thought of this acts 10 38 the Bible says God anointed Jesus of Nazareth us with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him ain't that right so that was the ministry that Jesus had amen we read there in Psalms 107 and 20. he sent his word and healed them ain't that right well that's not just a physical healing that's that's the that's the that's body so in mind and spirit amen that's a healing and and the way he does it he sends his word and healed them and delivered them from their destruction he didn't send a psychologist a man to heal them he didn't send a marriage counselor to heal them he didn't send these all uh uh a philosopher to heal them he sent his word so God sends his word to heal our hurts ain't that right and and there is a lot of hurt people in the mess message a man there's a lot of hurt people but it shouldn't it shouldn't surprise us a bit you know when you go to the hospital and you're seeing the the you you're seeing the the emergency room filled up you're seeing all the rooms that are filled up well it doesn't surprise us amen because that's what a hospital is for it's it's it well you don't go to the hospital when you ain't got nothing wrong it's when you got something wrong that that that you go to the hospital because they're there to take care of you they're there for you to recover they're there Amen to help you amen through the situation ain't that right well uh uh then then it shouldn't surprise us that that within the message ranks there's a lot of hurt people a man see but you see the message is the word of God do you believe it and God I believe is sending his people a man to where the message is so that they can be healed ain't that right amen not just any word is is going to heal them God sent his word to heal them his word that's right see amen so so they may have uh all kinds of hurts and their life is a mess and all that but God sends them a man to his word amen to heal them a man see and the Bible says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony ain't that right they overcame everybody say I'm overcoming amen God called us to overcome amen not to sit and cry a bit and then and whine about it amen but to overcome it amen I I know we've all got a different life we've all got a different past we've all got different things and and I guarantee you every one of us wants to sit down and just say I've had enough of it amen but there's something about the word of God Amen that keeps healing our wounds that that that keeps yeah uh uh helping us to recover from everything can you say Amen you cannot keep a Christian down you can't keep him out you you just can't hold him down the word of God has been sinned Amen to heal him and to deliver them from their destructions amen and so now we find that not everybody receives their healing and it's not God's fault amen uh brother Branham said it's just like a man dying on the doctor's steps and refused to take his medicine he said it ain't the doctor's fault it ain't the medicine's fault it's the man because he won't take the medicine that's the way it is with the church today we've got bomb amen see uh uh we got Physicians we got medicine but Sinners die in their seats in their churches and go to torment because they refuse to take the medicine can you say man well I'm telling you we've got the greatest message on the face of the Earth that that is so powerful it'll change your body it'll change your way of thinking it'll change everything about you but you got to take the medicine ain't that right we got to take it see he said it ain't the doctor's fault it's the man's fault that won't come see that's right but we've got a bomb in Gilead amen we got a bomb church can you say Amen you say well you know how you you may look at your life right now and you may look at the Promises of God and say it seems like I'm so far away from that but I'm telling you we've got a bomb we've got a bomb in Gilead a man that'll help you get to that place Amen to where every promise is alive in you that's right Jesus said if you shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast and to see it shall be done that's what he said ain't that right well how's that going to be amen I'll tell you we got a bomb in Gilead ain't that right he also said in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover how's that going to be done because we've got a bomb in Gilead ain't that right he sent his word to heal them of their diseases that's right see now you know all them promises you realize them promises that Jesus just and they were just two of them that we I just read amen you realize he's talking to people that have been hurt stop rejected despised and and and and all of these things and and and people whose lives are all messed up but Jesus said if you just believe you can do them things amen he didn't say well if he was born in a new home a good home and if you got money in in your account you had no battles you've had no hurts you've had he's talking about people whose lives have been wrecked and miserable that there's a problem in Gilead a man that can restore that situation Amen to where they can be a sons of God you believe it see you have to come to the word and receive healing for the wounds eat that right amen so there's people that that that that that uh are witnesses that God can make something beautiful out of a life that was considered to be hopeless you believe that now Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe so faith has power over all things as we said the other night faith has power over all things it has power over sickness power over hurts power over death power over wounds power over sufferings power everything over everything all things faith is the thing that makes all things possible amen and they overcame the World by their faith amen for this is the victory ain't that right faith is the victory as I said last week we we must not have a victim mentality amen and I looked up that word victim mentality it's the belief that one is always a victim the idea that bad things will always happen to one amen see you can't just wake up that day and and wake up tomorrow amen well what next you know I I'm just all gloomy I'm in the dumps I'm in there and acting as though it's always going to be that way you've got to get get out of that victim mentality there's too many promises there's a bomb in Gilead can you say Amen that that's right see so you are going to face challenges you will you're going to face it in your marriage you're going to face it in the church you're going to face it on the job you're going to face it in the business World you'll you're going to face it in the ministry everywhere you are you're going to face the challenges in in life ain't that right the easiest thing is to run away from it all but you ain't going to be able to run away amen everywhere you go there's an enemy there to taunt you amen and to pester you and to torment you but there's a bomb in Gilead can you say amen amen see now now John 16 33 Jesus said in the world you shall everybody say I shall have tribulation in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer he didn't sit there and start passing out handkerchiefs and napkins a man for you to cry with and blow your nose amen he said but be of good cheer I have overcome the world Amen who's overcome the bombing Gilead ain't that right he's proven to be the antidote he's proven to be the the cure for everything that you have ailments are with ain't that right he's provency so now he showed us amen by him overcoming as you see God come in flesh human flesh just like you and I he suffered rejection he suffered the hurts he suffered he was despised and and and and and sped upon he suffered the embarrassment the shame he endured all of them things and yet he says I have overcome so he showed us as a man how you can overcome ain't that right he showed us as a man that we can overcome amen see now number one he had quickening power ain't that right he had quickening power don't think for a moment and you're going to overcome by yourself hey man that's right and don't think for a moment that some carnal Unholy Ghost Field amen unregenerated man is going to help you overcome amen the enemy that you're going that you're facing with can you say Amen it's a spiritual warfare it ain't a carnivore Fair it's not a natural Warfare It's a spiritual warfare the devil's been after this church the devil's been after our home the devil's been after your home the devil's been after your children amen and what else what man can stand there amen and offer you what God has for you amen the only thing there is a doctor can't do it when the doctors fail they're still a bomb can you say Amen when everything else fails there's still a bomb in Gilead now he says I've overcome so don't think you're going to overcome by yourself no sir notice brother Bram said see that quickening power that come upon Jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word for that day ain't that right that's how Jesus overcome you say well he was God well good Lord what in the world are you you're really getting it too close well if you're sons of God what are you ain't that right Jesus is flesh and blood just like you but he had quickening power ain't that right he had all of God in him he was God but brother Bram talked about that ain't that right he talked about that like you go in the ocean you ain't gonna drink all that ocean and you don't have to have all that ocean in you to have the the the the the the the qualities or the minerals and all of that that's in that ocean you can take a a a a Dipper full a spoonful and drink it and everything that's in that ocean you just partook of ain't that right yes sir now God is it was he was all God the fullness of godhead would dwelt bodily in him but I'm going to tell you the fullness of the godhead is in his church today and if you're part of that church the same God that was in him in every quality every character every attribute hell power that was in him is in you you try so that quickening power that come upon Jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of that day see and and he couldn't have done what he'd done church he could not have done what he'd done without the quickening power do you believe that look Luke Luke 4 18 the spirit of the Lord this is Jesus saying it the spirit of the Lord is upon me amen aren't you glad he identified it the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord amen he couldn't have done any of that except the quickening power was in him and the spirit of the Lord was upon him see that he can fulfill every word that was spoken of him to do because he had the quickening power now notice the prophet said the holy spirit is here on Earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained a life in this age aren't you glad amen the ministry of God Amen the holy spirit that is up on the Earth today amen not just to get you to roll on the floor amen not just to get you all happy and excited and goosebumps and then you don't know what you are and who you are and how you are and all these sayings see that he's here looking out Those whom he has ordained to life amen they've been trapped in sin they've been wounded they've been hurt amen they've been almost elderly destroyed amen but God is taking them people and he's healing them making them sons and daughters again restoring them back into the position that they were called to be in the first place now notice he says now so the holy spirit is here on Earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does just like it did on Jesus Christ the great super Son of God who redeemed us all it comes down and takes its place of Abode into the human life and notice it brought the quickening power amen he found you did he not he found you you was on your road to whatever maybe he was just raised in church man and or maybe he was a drunk or it doesn't matter what you are or what you were a man it took the Holy Spirit to find you if he'd never found me I'd still be a church member or a backslid out in the world somewhere but he found me amen and he found you as well amen and brought the quickening power to you now notice when that goes brother I'm talking about the quickening power when it fell upon Luther it manifested the promise of that hour when it fell up on Wesley it manifested the promise of that hour when it falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour when a fellow from Moses it manifested the promise of that hour it fell upon Noah it manifested the promise of that hour when it fell Upon Jesus it manifests the promise of that hour see it's the Holy Spirit coming down to Quicken make alive those people that's been for ordained of God to be in the Rapture why is the word for the age ain't that right every promise that is for this age the Holy Spirit has come to make manifest and and then you say well am I the one that's going if the Holy Ghost has found you you're going Glory see God going to take all the questions out there ain't no point there's no point in in us being in the message and still wondering if we're children of God there's there's no point if we're having the holy if we've got the Holy Ghost amen God doesn't want us just sitting around questioning all the time I wonder if I'm going to make it I wonder if this and I'm wondering that if you could look at the power that has come to you it's a quickening power it's a quickening power can you say Amen see so it's the Holy Ghost if you've got the Holy Ghost this is what it's come to do to you it's come to you to Quicken and make a lie make you alive amen see because you're ordained of God to be in the Rapture so no question about it I'm going in a Rapture that's why we say it not I want to meet you in the Rapture I'm going to meet you in the Rapture I will meet you in the Rapture why because the Holy Ghost has come and it's quickened now now brother Brown said notice that is if he is a true Eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true eagle now the little Eagle probably in the barnyard was eaten all right but he knowed it wasn't exactly right but when he heard the truth he then received this truth and you say man so we got a power Jesus overcome the world by power the quickening power amen but if you look at perfect faith in the message perfect Faith he brother Brown said Jesus had Faith with his power Faith see because faith is what causes a man to take action if you don't believe it you ain't gonna act upon it if you don't believe that you're you know your your Rich uncle is giving you ten thousand dollars you ain't gonna go if you don't believe in it you'll just kind of laugh at it and you say I forget that I ain't gonna spin my gas all the way down there and look like a fool if you really believe it if he sends you a letter he calls you out and says you know I hadn't seen you a while but really been thinking about you and you're in need and and I'm going to give you thousands of dollars here I got to check fifty thousand and you really believe that buddy it wouldn't take much you'd get in that car and you'd go yeah at least I would but uh we ain't got no Rich uncle so faith is what causes a man to take action now if Jesus didn't have faith he wouldn't have healed the sick or raised the Dead he would have done just like a lot of us and just sit there and cried about him and ask God why why are you allowing these things to happen but he had Faith with this power if he didn't have faith he wouldn't have used the word to defeat the Devil with he would have just put up with them mind battles and let the devil haunt him and haunt him and he would have never spoke the word if he didn't have faith that the word would work if he didn't have faith that the word was for him and applied to him he would have never defeated the devil with that he would have just said shoe devil get away I just don't understand everybody forsakes me and I just don't know why God's putting Temptations I just gave my heart to God if he didn't have faith he wouldn't have surrendered to the father's will he wouldn't have surrendered his will to the father and be led into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil but the Bible says he was led to be tempted of the devil he was led in the wilderness but if he had had not faith in what he was and in in God's word amen that he would have never surrendered his will if he didn't have faith see he wouldn't have he wouldn't have surrendered his will there at at in Gethsemane when he said not my will but thine be done he would have never walked up God to Golgotha they didn't drive him to Golgotha they led him to Golgotha he willfully gave his life he'd done it by faith can you say man he did it by faith yes sir see it was in human Faith which stimulates the human intellectual uh side of man but he had the faith of God everybody say the faith of God we talked about it see uh uh the other night you know the have faith in God it means have the faith of God possess the the faith that God has ain't that right so God by his faith created the world did he not amen he would have never created if uh there was darkness in in all these things it was just it was impossible there was nothing to to of of anything to excite the mind at all but he had faith in his own word ain't that rad there was nothing positive out there he had desires with him but within him amen uh to have things amen but if he had not Faith amen it would have been a hopeless situation it would have just been a dreamer but he had faith and by his faith he believed in his own word therefore he said let there be he by his faith defeated All Odds by his faith he wrote our names in the Lamb's Book of Life yet we didn't even exist as human beings yet but by faith he desired it he desired it it was in him we were in him there was something in him calling for it and by faith he acted upon him before we even become into existence in natural form he had already wrote our names in the Lamb's Book of Life by faith he predestinated us he called us by his faith he Sanctified us and glorified Us by his face so he didn't need us to be here first as proof he didn't even need us to be born right he didn't need us to live a sin sinless life on our own before he could call us he did it all by faith and here you were born a wretched sinner but there was a man or there was a God who by faith called you to be something different ain't that right see he he designed our lives he he he not only just started us but he put an end to it he's already got an expected end for every one of us can you say amen and I'm telling you he knows you're going to make it brother Bram said I saw y'all over there amen I don't think he was just talking to that group of people there I'm talking I thought he I believe he was talking to every son and daughter of God and when he was over there beyond the curtain of dime he saw us there he didn't need me to be born on this Earth to see me it was God by faith God by faith he did it by faith faith knows what's going to be do you believe that if you're guessing at it that's not faith if you're wishing for it to be that's not faith faith knows it's going to be you believe it that's why God already decreed the end from the beginning it's by faith he ain't he didn't wish it to happen he didn't wish you to Salvation his faith puts you to Salvation decreed you to Salvation he already knows it's going to happen I hope you understand God's faith God's faith God's faith it's going to happen Faith knows it's going to be and see the only way that kind of faith can exist is by the word of God that's right for Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away and God cannot go back on his promises because he cannot change ain't that right he cannot go back see now now look at this uh brother Brown says can you imagine how pure and adulterated his promises are how infinite can you imagine how pure and how infinite his promises are he said if I'd go to a spring and my grandfather drank out of that spring and it was clear and testing the water and it was a hundred percent pure my father drank out of it it was a hundred percent pure all the way down through life I drunken out of it and it was at a hundred percent pure why I'd have enough Faith to go back and believe if I take a drink of that water it would be all right why see because through all the generations it's been proven it's been tested to be a hundred percent proof ain't that right so we we find see he said because the stream that's gushing it up you see that water see uh where it's coming from its foundations down there it's bad it's throwing up more pure water all the time it can't get stagnant ain't that right so he says now if it'll test 100 pure how much more will the promise of God test 100 pure percent right because of the basis of it God's word comes from God and he is that Fountain he is the pure inexhaustible Fountain he is the holy fountain ain't that right so see the word comes from God see and which is infinite pure holy and he cannot lie for his God so there you are now when God promises anything you say that's right can you say man when God promises anything our answer is that's right why it's already been tested Noah drank from that Fountain David drank from that Fountain amen all the prophets of old the Patriarchs amen the shamgar drank from that Fountain and it tested to be right and now here you are it's your time to drink from that same Fountain and take thee in the promises of God and I guarantee you it's still just a pure word of God that's where your faith needs to be based off of [Music] have you ever wondered why brother Branham always used stories in the Bible almost all of his sermons he's used in the story of whatever why because he's taking you back to Generations where they tasted of that pure water they tasted of that word and it never failed them now you can taste of the same word and it'll never fail them can you fail you can you say man now people always putting their faith in everything else but the word of God but if you want the face of God it has to come only from the word of God yes sir see amen so we're not we're not coming to doctors Faith we're not coming to the you know to to the the counselor's Faith or theology Faith we're coming to perfect faith in perfect word ain't that right see so we we find there's always of course going to be the mixed multitude that we're going to have to deal with that's where the negative comes from that's where the game Sayers come out of and and I looked it up a game Sayer is one who contradicts what God says in his word again Sayer will always contradict What God Says in his word he just will you know it's it's the same thing it's always been it's always been that mixed multitude that attracts distracts the people from the promises of God God does something great in the in in a service and it'll be the game Sayers to pull them off aside and tell about the problems and tell them about the wolves and tell them all that and if if you if you're not careful and you start listening to that game say your faith that God had just done your faith will dwindle you got to stay on the word of God ain't that right you know Jude 1 11 uh mentioned those who perished in the game saying of Korah see he was he was of that mixed multitude ain't that right and there were many who were listening to the promises of God and yet they perished because they sat and listened and come under the influence of the gang saying of Korra but we are not like them everybody say I'm not like them and I hope you believe that I'm not like them let them talk ain't my ears ain't for that let them do whatever they want to I ain't gonna fight with it ain't doing that we're not like them we don't notice we are of the lineage that have taken that that that that have taken as the prophet says the power of faith and pulled from the supernatural God and has received their heart's desires we are of that lineage of that people we've come from that lineage a faith seed a faith line a man who have taken a man the power of faith and have pulled from the supernatural God and have received our heart's desire I'm telling you can have your heart's desire through the power of faith now God believed his own word and then he asks us to believe his own his word also ain't that right now we know Jesus was God made flesh The God Who created All Things by his faith in The Invisible was now expressing himself through a human body expressing that same faith called Jesus Christ God who created the world by his faith expressed his faith by speaking the word and it was so now he comes into a human body called Jesus Christ and he expresses that same faith I'm gonna get somewhere but you just hang in there Jesus believed in what the word of God said did he not he believed in what the word of God said why God was in him believing his own word God was in the human body having total preeminence in the body and he was believing his own word in what he had said through the prophets Jesus said it was written with me ain't that right it's written of me see and so now now men All Around Jesus was putting their faith in other things some put their faith in the doctor's report some put their faith in the church some put their faith in the Creeds of men or their Church Traditions amen they were putting their faith in all kinds of things see and and and and and that's fine if they want to do that but I guarantee every one of them showed up disappointed amen church will let you down preacher will let you down philosophy will let you down Creeks of men will let you down doctors will let you down can you say Amen but all their faith was in that but Jesus had the face of God which believes his own word the faith of God doesn't rely upon what a doctor tells you Faith Of God that brother Bram talks about the the perfect Faith he said if the doctor came to you on a Friday morning tells you you're gonna die within three days or by Monday morning you're going to be dead he said if you had that perfect Faith you'd laugh in that doctor's face now if you have faith in the doctor you sit and cry a while you eat your last meal Last Supper call the friends and family hopefully you got your wheel out and all these things and cross your fingers hoping the doctor's wrong yeah but if you have the face of God you look at the doctor and say Doc I know that's what you are and you're telling me from a scientific standpoint but my faith is in the word of God and the word of God Says by my stripes you're healed can you say Amen so I'll take that report over a doctor's report see God believes his own word now now you know people people sometimes will say well if God would just tell me personally that the promises are for me I I would just have more for more faith if he would have just wrote my name in uh uh you know there in the Bible and and if he would just just spell it out for me then then then I can I can really regress that but you realize even if Jesus told you verbatim called you out verbatim you still can't have faith unless it's totally revealed to you by God can you say man but I'm telling you God doesn't have to call you by name and he doesn't have to reveal it to her or or tell you he he didn't have to write you know Sean Martin every Pro uh name you know the promise there well it belongs to Sean Martin well when when when the prophecy was given forth I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption or leave his soul in hell it did not say Jesus Christ so Jesus did not have a name personally to where he could look and and visibly see his name I'll not suffer Jesus Christ amen to see corruption and I ain't gonna leave amen Jesus Christ so in hell it didn't say that but there was a God that was in Christ that knew what that scripture meant and it knew that it pertained to that old body and God in Christ believed that word for him is that all right so God doesn't have to believe God doesn't have to do that you see every promise everybody say every promise is to the believer every promise is to the believer you don't have to have your name physically tied to it every promise is to the believer so the question is are you a believer ain't that right see the word of God is written to the believer and all things everybody say all things are possible to them that believe you don't have to sit there Tangled Up by the devil all things are possible to them that believe restoration is pi is possible healing is possible Deliverance is possible if you're a believer last Wednesday we talked to the two men who needed Jesus but each man exhibited a different level of faith the one man had to have Jesus lay his hand on the girl he was a Jew but the Roman soldier who was a gentile knew the authority of the word and only required Jesus to speak the word so so his faith was a greater Faith than that of the Jew ain't that right but both got what they needed from Jesus because of their faith and you say man jerias got what he needed and and and the Roman Centurion got what he needed but it shows that the different levels of faith that a man can have a man that don't have to settle with just a little old faith or we can say first level faith as I'm saying you know some people have enough Faith to get healed others have enough Faith to get saved others have enough Faith to overcome others have enough Faith to believe the whole in the atonement in full atonement you see the foolish virgin they're going to go through the tribulation because they rejected the fullness the atonement in its fullness good people Godly holy people virgins but they didn't have the faith to reach up and grab all of it so they reject the atonement in its fullness amen so so we we find the greatest faith that a man can have is when he recognizes the authority of the word and that's all he requires he doesn't require feelings he doesn't require sensation he doesn't require proof he recognizes the authority of the word just speak the word ain't that right see faith and gifts are all right but gifts will fail faith in the land of hands one of hands is all right but there's a greater Faith than that and it's the ultimate faith for it's God's faith and it's taking God at his word is that right now I believe this is why God sent us a prophet of Malachi 4 for the word everybody say the word comes to a prophet Sensations come to maybe something else theology comes to something else but the word come to a prophet ain't that right and today the believer of this day the adorndained believer has recognized the authority of the word of God recognize the authority of the word and upon that Faith there will be a rapture upon that Faith by that Faith there's going to be a body change by that faith the old is going to be turned young again ain't that right now brother Brahm says I want you I want you to get built up now in this holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour everybody say the faith of this hour all kinds of Faith but there's a faith of this hour the the faith see it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be a rapturing faith to be taken up oh sure they had a level of Faith back and loser but not enough Faith to get them out of here they had enough faith in Pentecost but look where all that went too not enough Faith to get us out of here but there's a people on this Earth that has recognized the authority of the word again amen and it's a rapturing faith it's a power to change them and I say it's changing us now yes sir so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether that be of God or not now that if it's of God if you believe it of God what is it going to do it's going to build your faith that's what it's doing it's going to build your faith now Church you realize where we're coming from look as the church has moved look where we've elevated in so much that the prophet said we're in an astronaut age can't you can't have the message and living on a horse and buggy that's a slap in God's face in my opinion if God gave we couldn't have the astronaut age spiritually without the message of the hour but it's a perfect faith perfect Faith given to that individual makes him an astronaut because by that Faith he has the power to rise up above everything he rises higher than Luther Wesley pinnacock he rises above it all he's into orbit the power of faith is a creative power you believe it see you you don't need things to get better before the miracle comes your faith has the power to create God didn't take in this day he didn't take dirt and creates and make squirrels he spoke his word and created squirrels when there was no squirrels now I think we talked about it last maybe not last Wednesday but when Jesus performed his first miracle he took water and turned it into wine see brother Brown said he took water which potentially someday might have been wine but it was water first says what did he do when he fed the 5 000 people he took something that had been like water he took a fish that once swam and was born from an egg and broke it and another fish growed onto the creation that was the original creation he took bread that was once a seed and then he turned it into a wheat and then into bread and then he broke from this bread and the creation only molted plaid but everybody say but in the woods there was nothing there to make a squirrel Let There Be and there was without anything to break it from what is it the same Jesus Christ see greater things than this will you do for I go to my father not take something that's been created and break something from it and multiply a creation but absolutely create showing that he's the same Jehovah that stood back there and said let there be am there was his word was made manifesty and when he was made Flesh on Earth he he took his original creation broke it back and multiplied it but now in the last days when he comes down Among Us the same light that moved down and said let there be light he J see he just speak the creation into existence greater than this will you do for I go to my father remember we're at these times [Music] we're at these times and you say Amen see so we we have come to where all we need is the word to be spoken Bridge yeah I'm not I'm not saying that laying on hands is wrong brother Branham did it all of his ministry but I am telling you this we're in an age we're in a Time where all we need is the word to be spoke can you say man and I want to say it this way the word has been spoken through a prophet and every promise is at our fingertips all that is required of us is to believe how many believers do we have now all that's required of us is just to believe ain't that right now see now notice if you will believe what he said then you will do what he said for it's God in you believing and performing his own word now I'm going to close I want to leave this with you we have read about and talked about the faith that Jarius had jerias he believed that if Jesus would come and if he would just lay his hands upon his daughter she would live be made well we then have read about the faith that the Centurion woman had and and his faith was if you'll just speak the word my servant shall live and and we see the power of their faith but then let's just for just a few minutes look at the faith Jesus had because I I think that's important and I think that's the faith that we're coming to my thoughts of this Jesus brother Brown said had perfect faith it's a different type of faith now remember the boy that had an absolute epilepsy demon see when he met Jesus the disciples couldn't do nothing with him so when he met Jesus the the boy was threw into a harder fit than he had ever had and brother Brown said it's because that devil knew that he had met faith on a different level than what the apostles had he had met a perfect faith and that's what we must have everybody say we must have it perfect faith to make the perfect word of God perform perfectly that's it we must believe it without a shadow of a doubt ain't that right so notice the faith that Jesus had he said I can do nothing in myself he couldn't heal the Sick by his own ability he couldn't raise the dead by his own ability he couldn't walk on the Water by his own ability but his faith wasn't it himself ain't that right his faith was in the word now brother Brandon said he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word I think that's where our faith is coming he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and they was in him and that gave him Faith because he understood his position it's one thing to look at him and says oh if I could have that Minister just just to pray for me it's one thing to say oh if I just was with brother Branham if I could just been there and he could tell me everything what I needed to know that's one thing that's good your faith there whatever but Jesus faith he understood his position he wasn't looking to say man if I was in the days of Joshua if I was just in the days of David if I could have just been with him no he knew his position so his faith was in what he was God made him to be and you say man see he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word they was in him and that gave him Faith because he understood his position another place he know what he was because the scripture had said he was this and hear every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was blind Bartimaeus knew what he was and his faith reached out to him and he got healed right the woman at the well knew what he was knew who he was he had performed the Messiah sign ain't that right and and she said sir give me the drink you know and and and she went into the Town come and see a man who has told me all these things isn't this the Messiah so her faith uh uh uh by her face she knew who he was Mary Magdalene knew who he was the Legion of demons knew who he was ain't that right but the most important thing was he knew who he was he didn't need people to tell him you're the Messiah you're the Messiah you're the Messiah you're the Messiah he had taken the scriptures and by his faith knew that the scripture had applied to him he was the one that wouldn't see corruption he was the one whose Soul wouldn't be left in hell he was the one and he's so relied upon that scripture that he told him all that was there destroy this Temple and within three days I will raise it up again what was it it was this God that was in him believing that only his own word now notice brother Brian said he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him see so he could do nothing in himself it was his faith in God ain't that right he relied upon what he was and the scriptures told him what he was so notice in the face of sickness his faith controlled him in the face of death his faith controlled him in the time of Temptation his faith controlled him in the face of rejection and criticism his faith controlled him brother Brian said Faith perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it he said now just watch when you believe anything do anything and you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances is that don't have one thing to do with it it Masters that circumstance if it's in a room of sickness and the Lord's revealed that this certain thing is going to happen you just speak it and go on yeah just don't ask any questions it's already over just keep going why Faith Masters all circumstances well if you do this so-and-so's going to do see you see well it already got it mastered see Faith believes that God will work it out what a faith we need eh Faith believes that God's going to work it out I don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow see it Masters all circumstances that's the faith Jesus had Satan was over there in the in the in the Temptation trying to twist all the scriptures and and even question and put the question mark in him if thou be the Son of God and every time by faith Jesus would take the word and would write back to the to the devil give it right back give it right back why he did it by his faith brother Brown said if Jesus relied upon what God made him and what the word of God said about him then cannot we rely upon what God has made us as believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had Faith what he was and if you are a Believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer you're a believer you love him a man cannot have faith when his heart is condemning him in church this is where this is where we've got to live a right life forsake the world man you cannot have this faith and and dilly-dallying with the world get rid of it because you cannot have confidence in God toward God if your heart is condemning you brother Brian said you know what brother said if your heart is condemning you you put yourself right back as a sinner again wow that's what he's saying he said when you automatically put yourself back there a sinner by knowing you're wrong now in that sense you know you say well I thought I had the Holy Ghost that's that's not the point the point is is you may have the Holy Ghost but if your heart's condemning you you can't have confidence in God you can't have that Faith you you can't act as a son of God I'm telling you Church we can't be Dilly dealing with the world and have this type of faith [Music] just can if our heart condemns us but if our heart doesn't condemn us then we have confidence toward God then what does he say then you can ask what you will it'll be given to you ask see you love the Lord so we we find the only thing the prophet said you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are can you say Amen you see well how do I get that Faith by the message of the hour I know people have used this message for legalism and just to beat the people up and all that stuff and and they they've taken it totally out of context and I understand and there's people that makes Grace a disgrace and all that and and there ain't no no and then then everybody just wants to live loose well you can't live like that either you see the message doesn't come to beat you up and it doesn't come to let you live in any way all you want to it come to let you know you're a son of God you're a Son of God God

lay hands on I recognize you as a man of authority you speak as one with an authority now speak it so Jesus spoke the word see the Centurion believed in who he was and Jesus spoke because he believed in who he was not because the Centurion believed in who he was Jesus didn't need somebody to prop him up [Music] that's why he could go alone and face Calvary because he had a perfect faith in the
