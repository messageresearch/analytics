[45:00] involved um and um pray for them that
[45:04] the Lord would just Comfort their hearts

[45:09] was preaching there Sunday and um uh
[45:14] when that happened and so they've
[45:16] actually asked him to stay over and and
[45:20] uh minister at the memorial service and
[45:23] so we want to keep brother Andrew in
[45:25] prayer so Sister Mariah and I I think

[47:49] you oh God I pray that you would grant
[47:53] that now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[47:57] and the church
[47:58] says amen and
[48:01] amen we're going to read the book of
[48:04] Joshua the uh 14th
[48:07] chapter
[48:09] and we're going to start at the seventh
[48:12] verse but it says 40 years old was I
[48:17] when Moses the servant of the Lord sent
[48:19] me from kades Baria to aspy out the land
[48:24] and I brought to him word again as it
[48:27] was in Mine
[48:28] Heart nevertheless my brethren that went
[48:31] up with me made the heart of the people
[48:35] melt but I wholly follow the Lord my
[48:39] God and Moses swear on that day saying
[48:44] surely the land where upon thy feet have
[48:48] trotten shall be thine
[48:50] inheritance and thy children's forever
[48:53] because thou Hast wholly followed the
[48:55] Lord my God and now behold the Lord hath
[48:59] kept me
[49:00] alive as he said these 40 and5 years
[49:04] even since the Lord spake this word unto
[49:08] Moses while the children of Israel
[49:11] wandered in the wilderness and now lo I
[49:13] am this day four score and 5 years
[49:17] old as yet I am as strong this day as I
[49:22] was in the day that Moses sent me and my
[49:26] strength was then even so is my strength
[49:29] now for war both to go out and to come
[49:33] in now therefore give me this mountain
[49:36] whereof the Lord spake in that day for
[49:40] thou heardest in that day uh how the
[49:44] anakims uh were there and that the
[49:47] cities were great uh yeah great and
[49:51] fenced if so be the Lord will be with me
[49:54] then I shall be able to drive them out
[49:56] out as the Lord said amen you
[50:02] can have your seats this evening and um
[50:07] I want to continue maybe on the the
[50:12] subject uh that we've talked about the
[50:15] past two Wednesdays I guess uh taking
[50:18] our inheritance by the word of our
[50:21] mouth
[50:23] and uh the word um to uh inherit the
[50:29] word inherit is to come into possession
[50:34] of or receive especially as a right or
[50:38] Divine
[50:39] portion and so we're we're this is what
[50:43] we're talking about is Caleb's
[50:46] inheritance God had promised him an
[50:49] inheritance and so he's he's wanting his
[50:53] inheritance you see you can only inherit
[50:57] that which has been given to you it has
[50:59] to be something given and uh to have an
[51:03] inheritance somebody has to leave you
[51:06] something uh and so uh the prophet in
[51:10] the uh adoption
[51:12] series uh tells us that God did leave us
[51:15] something he left you something and he
[51:19] he did that before the foundation of the
[51:22] world Amen and so he goes on uh uh to
[51:27] tell us what he left he said a name
[51:30] written on the book that when the lamb
[51:33] would be slain you would be recognized
[51:36] with it what an inheritance amen wrote
[51:39] our name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[51:42] before the foundation of the world that
[51:44] we would be recognized with it and and
[51:48] well how did we get this inheritance and
[51:51] Paul would tell us there in the book of
[51:55] Ephesians uh first chapter the 11th
[51:58] verse and of course the book of
[52:01] Ephesians is the deals with the second
[52:04] um uh uh work of redemption uh there's
[52:08] two parts of redemption that's coming
[52:11] out and going into and so uh brother
[52:14] Bram talks about the Book of Joshua
[52:16] being the book of or book of Ephesians
[52:19] parallels with the Book of Joshua and uh
[52:22] dealing with our inheritance our placing
[52:26] and so Paul would tell us there in
[52:28] Ephesians 1:11 in whom also we have
[52:32] obtained an inheritance say it with me I
[52:35] have obtained an
[52:37] inheritance amen and and and and notice
[52:41] being
[52:42] predestinated according to the purpose
[52:45] of him who worketh all things after the
[52:48] counsel of his own will so then this
[52:52] this this inheritance is Comes To Us by
[52:55] predestination
[52:57] you you did not get this inheritance by
[53:00] by uh turning a new Leaf you you did not
[53:04] uh uh brother Braham said you don't
[53:06] receive this inheritance because you
[53:08] walked uprightly amen the The Armenian
[53:11] Doctrine uh cannot bring you to your
[53:14] inheritance it it does not have that
[53:16] power to do that the only way you can
[53:19] get that inheritance is uh uh by
[53:23] predestination and so brother brandom
[53:25] says before he was po before he was God
[53:27] before he was savior before he was
[53:30] healer before he was all of this he
[53:33] predestinated he he put the Lamb's name
[53:36] on the book looked down through by his
[53:39] for knowledge and seen your name and put
[53:42] it in there too well what is it and
[53:45] after a while we come in the world born
[53:47] by sinful parents we walk around on the
[53:50] world you know and first thing you know
[53:52] that like that little hook nose Jew uh
[53:56] Paul see he was carrying out and the
[53:58] first thing something said here here
[54:00] here here here you know and you say oh
[54:03] Abba Father see you're going around as
[54:07] as we would use the Expression painting
[54:08] the town red and and uh living like a
[54:11] Helen and and doing whatever you were
[54:14] doing in in your life but something be
[54:16] to pull on you like it did with Paul and
[54:20] and and and surely all of us can
[54:22] experience that in some way shape or
[54:24] form we're not here because that we were
[54:27] uh made to do it amen there was
[54:29] something that was pulling uh uh us uh
[54:33] us amen calling us and so uh and and and
[54:37] and our response was Abba Father and so
[54:40] here we began to come see predestinated
[54:44] us to our inheritance in him which was
[54:47] predestinated to us see we inherited it
[54:51] before the foundation of the world see
[54:54] oh for his own purpose to work out his
[54:56] own good will to be a God and savior
[54:59] ain't that right so Caleb uh
[55:02] representing a a that that predestinated
[55:06] group amen if you want to find yourself
[55:08] in scripture then then then read the
[55:11] book of of of Caleb and or or of of of
[55:15] Joshua and and find out what Caleb was
[55:18] and what he did because he represents
[55:20] the the believer of this day who is
[55:23] following the end time leader uh uh
[55:26] Joshua ain't that right and so your
[55:29] inheritance is is is predestinated unto
[55:32] you and it's it's your legal right to
[55:36] lay claim to that inheritance amen and
[55:40] and we talked about last uh uh Wednesday
[55:43] about laying claim amen you have a right
[55:46] to lay claim to it as as as this is what
[55:49] Caleb was doing he he was laying claim
[55:52] to his inheritance he he wasn't worried
[55:54] about everybody else's inheritance he
[55:55] wanted what was rightfully his amen and
[55:59] he laid claim to it and that word again
[56:01] lay claim is to demand as being one's
[56:04] property to assert one's right or title
[56:08] to to say that you own it and so th this
[56:12] he wasn't going to bargain With the
[56:14] Enemy he wasn't there to to to mingle
[56:16] With the Enemy No he wanted his Mountain
[56:20] he wanted to possess it as his own amen
[56:25] and so I I think it is time to lay claim
[56:28] to our inheritance either either we're
[56:31] going to lay claim to it or or we're
[56:33] going to be out in the wanding in the
[56:34] wilderness one of the two but but I I
[56:37] don't believe that we can be sons of God
[56:39] in this day amen and not lay claim to
[56:42] our inheritance and so this is exactly
[56:45] what Caleb was doing he was so inspired
[56:48] by what God had told him amen uh uh uh
[56:52] uh uh through the the the mouth of a
[56:54] prophet he was so uh uh uh believing it
[56:58] and and and resting in what God had told
[57:01] him that his age didn't matter his his
[57:05] his ability whether whether he could
[57:07] defeat the giant or not defeat he was
[57:10] not looking at his stature he was not
[57:12] looking at his ability he just knew that
[57:15] God said he could have it and that's
[57:17] exactly the way he was doing it he was
[57:20] laying claim to it by the word of God
[57:24] ain't that right and so uh uh uh uh uh
[57:28] Caleb had entered the land through the
[57:30] ministry of Joshua and I believe that's
[57:33] what uh the the message is in this day
[57:37] is is uh the ministry of Joshua uh of
[57:40] course as i' I've told you I believe it
[57:42] is the ministry of Moses I believe it's
[57:44] the ministry of zerubabel I believe it's
[57:46] the ministry of Joshua I believe it's I
[57:48] believe that he fulfilled this message
[57:50] fulfills a lot of things amen but that
[57:53] Joshua Ministry amen represent the end
[57:57] time leader of this day and we know that
[58:00] that that you know brother BR said well
[58:02] the the Holy Ghost is Joshua and that's
[58:04] exactly right no man in his right mind
[58:06] or his natural Ministry his Natural
[58:09] State could lead a people into a
[58:11] supernatural land but God is the well
[58:14] the we we look at the prophet you know
[58:16] and and uh uh well brother Brandon said
[58:19] the Holy Ghost is the prophet amen the
[58:21] Holy Ghost is the spirit of Elijah in
[58:24] this day amen but it rested upon that
[58:27] seventh angel messenger ain't that right
[58:30] and and so uh uh and and this is why
[58:33] that that we we follow the message of
[58:35] brother Brandon is because it wasn't
[58:38] just a man that brought us the message
[58:40] of the hour this message is not brother
[58:42] brandom's message it's the angel of
[58:44] God's message it's it's God's message
[58:47] amen spoken through the prophet in this
[58:50] age can you say amen amen see so uh uh
[58:54] uh and so when he had came had entered
[58:57] the land amen uh under the ministry of
[59:00] Joshua Caleb told Joshua Now give me my
[59:03] Mountain remember that now he's telling
[59:06] he's reminding Joshua of the promise
[59:08] that was given to him and now he looking
[59:11] at Joshua as the leader amen and he said
[59:15] now Joshua give me my Mountain amen give
[59:18] me amen the Liberty to go possess the
[59:21] mountain it's time for it I'm in the
[59:23] land I I'm I'm here and I don't want to
[59:26] just dilly-dally around I I don't want
[59:28] to just wander around I'm not called to
[59:30] wander in the land of promise I'm called
[59:33] to to take what is rightfully mine ain't
[59:37] that right and and so it was Joshua amen
[59:41] that that gave him the Liberty under the
[59:44] ministry of Joshua amen Caleb had the
[59:48] Liberty to possess amen his inheritance
[59:52] amen you see the word was so real it was
[59:55] made so real to Caleb amen that all he
[59:59] could see was himself as the Overcomer
[1:00:03] whatever giant would come his way
[1:00:05] whatever obstacle would come his way it
[1:00:08] didn't matter to him the promise was so
[1:00:11] real to Caleb that he could see himself
[1:00:14] defeating that giant he could see
[1:00:17] himself conquering any W City he could
[1:00:20] see himself amen obtaining his
[1:00:23] inheritance can you say Amen see you
[1:00:26] Caleb had nothing to possess in the land
[1:00:28] of Egypt Israel had nothing to possess
[1:00:32] in the land of Egypt see the prophet
[1:00:34] said The Inheritance didn't lay in Egypt
[1:00:37] uh you look at numbers 34 And1 and the
[1:00:40] Lord spake unto Moses saying command the
[1:00:42] children of Israel and say unto them
[1:00:45] when you come into the land of Canaan
[1:00:47] this is the land this is the land that
[1:00:50] shall fall unto you for an inheritance
[1:00:54] even the land of Canaan with the Coast
[1:00:56] thereof amen see so so the inheritance
[1:01:00] didn't lay in Egypt The Inheritance amen
[1:01:02] did not lay in the wilderness amen you
[1:01:05] never find Caleb or or any of them
[1:01:08] possessing in in in in the wilderness
[1:01:12] because the inheritance didn't lay there
[1:01:14] amen the Bible says that they passed
[1:01:17] amen through the land of Esau but could
[1:01:19] not possess his land amen see uh
[1:01:23] Deuteronomy 2 and4 and Comm command thou
[1:01:26] the people saying you are to pass
[1:01:29] through the coast of your brethren the
[1:01:31] children of Israel see or uh children of
[1:01:34] Esau which dwell in sear uh and they
[1:01:37] shall be afraid of you and take ye good
[1:01:40] heed unto yourselves therefore meddle
[1:01:43] not with them don't mingle with them
[1:01:46] don't settle down there with them don't
[1:01:49] don't try to possess this land with them
[1:01:51] see because he says for I will not give
[1:01:54] you of their land no not so much a much
[1:01:58] as a foot breath because I have given
[1:02:01] Mount seir unto Saul for possession can
[1:02:04] you say Amen so see there there there
[1:02:07] was possession uh uh uh Esau had a
[1:02:10] possession amen but it did not belong to
[1:02:13] Caleb it did not belong to Israel it God
[1:02:17] had allowed them amen you see and and
[1:02:20] and there are people that are settling
[1:02:22] down in religion they're settling down
[1:02:24] into whatever amen but God has called us
[1:02:27] to go further God has called us to
[1:02:30] pursue amen higher things greater things
[1:02:33] than God can you sayen that's right see
[1:02:37] and so God didn't give them Esau's land
[1:02:39] for an inheritance we find that Israel
[1:02:42] even passed through the plains of Moab
[1:02:45] and that's where they met BAC and balum
[1:02:47] and and and all these things but see God
[1:02:50] did even though they passed through that
[1:02:51] land god did not give them that land for
[1:02:55] an inheritance they had to keep moving
[1:02:58] on God wanted them to keep moving can
[1:03:01] you say amen and I say it this way as
[1:03:03] the prophet would tell us our
[1:03:05] inheritance didn't lay in the land of
[1:03:08] justification and neither did it lay in
[1:03:11] the land of sanctification and neither
[1:03:14] did it lay in in the land of the new
[1:03:17] birth either we've had to keep moving on
[1:03:20] can you say amen amen but we find out
[1:03:23] that the Lutheran amen they they failed
[1:03:25] to move move on Amen they settled right
[1:03:27] there that that in that portion of
[1:03:30] justification they you know and and and
[1:03:33] the weslan settled in the land of
[1:03:35] sanctification and the Pentecostal amen
[1:03:38] settled in the land of restoration of
[1:03:40] the gifts and and all of these things
[1:03:42] now you know there's a lot of people or
[1:03:44] not a lot but there is a teaching going
[1:03:46] on that the new birth is is the the the
[1:03:50] the land of inheritance but that's not
[1:03:52] true amen because uh you know brother
[1:03:55] Brandon talks about it how that the
[1:03:57] Pentecostals thought that when they had
[1:03:59] received the new birth that they had
[1:04:01] arrived and and and uh he said but they
[1:04:04] did not receive the inheritance see even
[1:04:07] though the prophet said they were born
[1:04:09] into the family as a son they were born
[1:04:13] into the kingdom of God but they didn't
[1:04:16] receive the inheritance so which tells
[1:04:19] us that the inheritance or the New Birth
[1:04:22] is not your adoption ain't that what
[1:04:25] brother Bram said the new birth is not
[1:04:27] your adoption and so the inheritance
[1:04:30] lays in the land of adoption that's
[1:04:33] that's our inheritance ain't that right
[1:04:35] amen yes we've had to pass through
[1:04:37] justification but we didn't settle there
[1:04:40] we we we passed through sanctification
[1:04:42] but we didn't stop there we passed
[1:04:44] through the gifts and the tongues and
[1:04:46] and all of these things and and and but
[1:04:48] we didn't stop there there is an
[1:04:51] inheritance that God has given us as an
[1:04:55] El amen see so brother brandham says now
[1:04:59] people say well praise the Lord I got
[1:05:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:05:03] settles it that seals me into the
[1:05:05] kingdom I'm a son and daughter of God he
[1:05:08] said that's true but that don't have
[1:05:11] nothing to do with your inheritance yet
[1:05:14] see he said in another place when the
[1:05:16] Pentecostal church and these people in
[1:05:18] the last days here that's beginning to
[1:05:20] find the new birth being born again they
[1:05:23] thought that settled it no sir you ups
[1:05:26] and downs and ins and outs and things
[1:05:29] like that God can't place you as a son
[1:05:32] see but when you stay in the Kingdom
[1:05:35] stay in the gospel stay right amen one
[1:05:38] of these days God will call you out and
[1:05:41] set you aside adopt you as his son
[1:05:44] before the people and give you something
[1:05:47] that'll shake the nations with it see
[1:05:49] what I mean it's the adoption into the
[1:05:52] family amen another place brother
[1:05:54] brandom in his pray prayer he said we
[1:05:56] believe that one of these days the holy
[1:05:59] spirit will move in not with a new birth
[1:06:03] for we've receive that through Christ
[1:06:06] but you'll adopt your church then see
[1:06:09] then she'll be clothed in the power of
[1:06:12] the resurrected Lord another place he
[1:06:15] says your adoption is not your birth
[1:06:17] your adoption is your placing can you
[1:06:21] say Amen it's your placing see so then
[1:06:25] when we are born of the spirit of God
[1:06:28] born again see then then we are sons and
[1:06:31] and yes that is true but according to uh
[1:06:35] uh uh Ephesians 1:5 Paul says that we
[1:06:39] were predestinated unto adoption he said
[1:06:42] having predestinated us unto the
[1:06:45] adoption of children or Sons by Jesus
[1:06:49] Christ to himself according to the good
[1:06:51] pleasure of his will see so now brother
[1:06:54] brandham said Paul Paul is speaking of
[1:06:57] The Last Day sons of God the sons of God
[1:07:01] in this last day there is a people amen
[1:07:04] sons of God that have been predestinated
[1:07:08] unto adoption amen yes they had to pass
[1:07:11] through this and they had to pass
[1:07:13] through sanctification justification
[1:07:15] amen the Pentecostal amen and and these
[1:07:18] things but they were
[1:07:19] predestinated Amen to inherit a land a
[1:07:23] promise amen and in inheritance amen see
[1:07:27] and so we we find that you're not here
[1:07:30] on Earth by accident there is a purpose
[1:07:33] amen for you being here ain't that right
[1:07:36] so now brother Brandon would say now in
[1:07:38] this in this age that we're now living
[1:07:42] at this age it's beyond Pentecost
[1:07:44] everybody say it's beyond Pentecost now
[1:07:47] now now you cannot deny Pentecost amen
[1:07:51] uh the Pentecostal experience you cannot
[1:07:53] just as much as you cannot deny
[1:07:55] justification sanctification you cannot
[1:07:58] deny p i I know a lot of people in the
[1:08:01] message are afraid of that word
[1:08:02] Pentecostal amen but there is a
[1:08:05] Pentecostal experience and it will make
[1:08:07] you act just like they did on the days
[1:08:09] of Acts Amen in the days of act on the
[1:08:12] day of Pentecost we believe in speaking
[1:08:14] in tongues we believe in the gifts we
[1:08:17] believe in Prophecy we believe in all
[1:08:19] these things amen but we believe in
[1:08:21] justification we believe in
[1:08:23] sanctification we believe in all of that
[1:08:25] us amen there is an inheritance can you
[1:08:28] say amen amen so we're not a people that
[1:08:31] deny what was there amen amen we're just
[1:08:34] moving on and not settling in the land
[1:08:38] that God never gave us to
[1:08:41] possess amen you see there's a land for
[1:08:44] you to settle down
[1:08:46] in ain't that right that's right so he
[1:08:49] says see it's beyond Pentecost Pentecost
[1:08:52] has settled itself into organizations
[1:08:55] and started faking whole lot about
[1:08:58] organization see amen see so in this age
[1:09:02] it tells us amen and there's several
[1:09:05] quotes where brother Brown said we're
[1:09:06] beyond the Pentecostal age we're Beyond
[1:09:08] Le oia or or we're in the bride age
[1:09:11] where it's seed time it's it's the shuck
[1:09:14] which is Pentecost has dried up and and
[1:09:17] all of these things which is telling us
[1:09:20] it's time to take our inheritance ain't
[1:09:23] that right we are living as we said so
[1:09:26] many time we're living in the book of
[1:09:29] Ephesians amen that's what we're living
[1:09:32] in as the bride of Christ see our
[1:09:35] inheritance is in the land of adoption
[1:09:39] we know what that promised land was to
[1:09:41] Israel amen uh uh it it was in that land
[1:09:45] amen that under the ministry of Joshua
[1:09:48] which was the ministry of Grace it was
[1:09:50] not a Ministry of legalism under Moses a
[1:09:54] Ministry of condemnation
[1:09:56] it was a Ministry of Grace and under
[1:09:58] that Ministry there was a positioning
[1:10:01] there was a placing there was a dividing
[1:10:05] of inheritance and Joshua under by
[1:10:08] inspiration placed them in the land
[1:10:11] where they belonged ain't that right see
[1:10:14] and brother Bram tells us he calls it
[1:10:16] the land of adoption amen you see it's
[1:10:19] the it's the adopted son that falls air
[1:10:23] to the inheritance amen inheritance can
[1:10:26] you say Amen inheritance is greater than
[1:10:29] just blessings amen You Can Dance you
[1:10:31] can shout you can speak in tongues you
[1:10:33] can do all them things and brother Bram
[1:10:35] calls that blessings amen but we're not
[1:10:38] talking about blessings we're talking
[1:10:39] about inheritance that you have been
[1:10:43] predestinated to and and you've got to
[1:10:45] fight every giant you got to fight
[1:10:47] everything that tries to hinder you and
[1:10:50] and claim claim what God has given you
[1:10:54] before the found of the world Amen so
[1:10:58] brother brandom says see adoption is a
[1:11:01] placing is placing a son see The
[1:11:04] Inheritance given you by predestination
[1:11:07] if it's given you by predestination then
[1:11:09] no wonder brother Brown tells us no one
[1:11:11] can take your place no one can take your
[1:11:13] place can you say Amen you can't look at
[1:11:16] somebody else and say well he's he's in
[1:11:18] my place no quit dreaming about somebody
[1:11:21] else quit wishing you were there in them
[1:11:23] and take what God has given you that's
[1:11:26] right that's right can you say
[1:11:29] amen that's right now if you you
[1:11:33] look uh Israel had been persecuted by by
[1:11:37] pharaoh and and had been in bondage for
[1:11:42] hundreds of years as as we know and they
[1:11:45] were deprived of worshiping the true and
[1:11:48] living God they they they were deprived
[1:11:51] of of of being what God had called them
[1:11:53] to be amen and they were held slaves uh
[1:11:57] uh under the the a strong Taskmaster
[1:12:01] amen but see God had made them a promise
[1:12:04] Amen in in his Bible or in his word and
[1:12:08] uh by the prophets the prophet said that
[1:12:11] he had give them a land see God
[1:12:14] remembered that God remembered his
[1:12:16] promise God knew there was a land
[1:12:18] waiting for them even though they were
[1:12:21] in bondage and getting whipped and and
[1:12:23] tormented amen and deprived of being uh
[1:12:27] uh what God had called them to be God
[1:12:29] remembered there's a land waiting for
[1:12:31] them amen and at a time he would deliver
[1:12:35] them and take them out of that land of
[1:12:37] bondage into a land uh of
[1:12:41] inheritance see and so so they they they
[1:12:45] they they were slaves there amen there
[1:12:47] was no inheriting in that land amen but
[1:12:50] when they entered into this land they
[1:12:53] they didn't go into that land to be
[1:12:55] slaves again they didn't go in that land
[1:12:57] to be tormented Again by the enemy they
[1:13:00] were now the possessor because they were
[1:13:03] now in the land of inheritance oh yes
[1:13:06] sir amen and and no doubt the enemy was
[1:13:10] stronger in that land than it was in
[1:13:12] that land for they were they were far
[1:13:15] more uh uh well you never find the
[1:13:19] Israel looking at the Egyptians saying
[1:13:21] we look as grasshoppers in their sight
[1:13:23] and we're we're as grasshoppers but when
[1:13:25] they come into this land of inheritance
[1:13:27] the enemy was so great so big so strong
[1:13:31] that they felt like they could not make
[1:13:34] it ain't that right but yet when they
[1:13:38] entered that land amen there was a
[1:13:41] people like Caleb that drove back the
[1:13:43] enemy and possessed their inheritance
[1:13:47] can you say Amen now I say to you there
[1:13:49] is a difference between a restored Son
[1:13:51] of God and a sinner amen see they didn't
[1:13:54] go that land amen just to be identified
[1:13:58] as a sinner they went in that land to be
[1:14:00] identified as a son ain't that right
[1:14:04] amen they went into that land not to be
[1:14:06] identified as a victim as one that is
[1:14:09] defeated they went in that land to be as
[1:14:11] to be identified as a
[1:14:14] conqueror possessor ain't that right you
[1:14:18] know when when man
[1:14:20] sinned he separated himself from God and
[1:14:24] he cross the great
[1:14:26] Chasm the brother Brandon would tell us
[1:14:29] and when he did that he put himself on
[1:14:32] the side of death this side of death and
[1:14:36] there was that great Chasm that that he
[1:14:38] could not go back into what he was amen
[1:14:41] before he had sinned there was no way
[1:14:44] for him to get back and and and to to to
[1:14:48] come back to what he was and and brother
[1:14:51] brandom talks about this Chasm you know
[1:14:54] there's a there's just just a a a big
[1:14:56] big big uh gap between man and God now
[1:15:00] man's on this side where it's a sight of
[1:15:02] death torment amen destruction amen and
[1:15:06] and and he can never come back and on
[1:15:09] this side he was a Son of God this side
[1:15:12] he is a sinner acting like a sinner uh
[1:15:15] uh uh uh thinking like a sinner talking
[1:15:18] like a sinner amen under the slave of
[1:15:20] the of the devil a puppet for the devil
[1:15:23] but on this side was a Son of God Amen
[1:15:27] and and you know the prophet said he's
[1:15:29] an offspring of God on this side see
[1:15:31] where he started with was he's a Son of
[1:15:34] God he's an offspring of God he's an
[1:15:36] inheritance of the earth he can control
[1:15:39] nature he can speak things into
[1:15:41] existence why because there was nothing
[1:15:44] separating him from God he was in unity
[1:15:47] with God but when he sin he crossed this
[1:15:50] Chasm and could not get back can you say
[1:15:53] Amen that he could speak the prophet
[1:15:55] said things into existence because he's
[1:15:57] a Creator himself now have you ever
[1:15:59] thought brother Brown said Satan is not
[1:16:01] a Creator his subjects is not a Creator
[1:16:05] Satan cannot create but man was made to
[1:16:10] be a Creator when he was on this side of
[1:16:13] the chasm he stood as a Son of God and
[1:16:16] his domain was the
[1:16:19] earth he's a Creator see because he's a
[1:16:24] offspring of God ain't that right that
[1:16:27] the prophet said when he when he crossed
[1:16:29] that Chasm then he separated amen his
[1:16:33] sunship now he becomes a sinner he he
[1:16:37] becomes that that Holy image of God has
[1:16:39] left him amen and and uh uh uh he well
[1:16:45] brother BR said now he's under the hands
[1:16:47] and Dominion of Satan and and all that
[1:16:50] but then God would provide a substitute
[1:16:52] and in the Old Testament they had the
[1:16:54] blood of bulls and goats and and uh yet
[1:16:57] that blood could not divorce sin it
[1:17:00] could not take away that Chasm amen it
[1:17:03] it still left that Chasm amen because it
[1:17:06] could not uh uh uh divorce sin it would
[1:17:09] only cover sin a ain't that right
[1:17:13] meaning the prophet said that that that
[1:17:15] if I've got a red spot on my hand and
[1:17:18] and and I cover it you know uh uh you
[1:17:21] know uh with with something and I and I
[1:17:23] cover it there well just because I cover
[1:17:26] it and you can't see it doesn't mean
[1:17:28] that it's not there it's still there
[1:17:30] ain't that right so that was the blood
[1:17:32] of bulls and goats it covered their sin
[1:17:35] but man was still a sinner in the eyes
[1:17:37] of God and therefore he could not cross
[1:17:41] amen back to in that Chasm under the
[1:17:44] blood of bulls and goats because it's
[1:17:46] still there ain't that right but God
[1:17:49] would create a blood if if you listen to
[1:17:52] that the the message God hiding himself
[1:17:55] in Simplicity or no no the breach amen
[1:17:58] uh in the breach brother BR talks about
[1:18:01] that bleach that God created himself it
[1:18:03] was the created blood of God Amen that
[1:18:07] was a bleach for sins of men amen I
[1:18:10] looked up that word bleach it means to
[1:18:12] remove to wash out Amen to uh uh uh to
[1:18:18] take away well brother brandom goes and
[1:18:20] talks about that you know the the drop
[1:18:22] of ink that that it can stain a shirt it
[1:18:25] can stain whatever amen but you take
[1:18:27] that same drop of of of of ink and put
[1:18:31] it in a bucket of bleach you'll never
[1:18:33] see it again because the power of bleach
[1:18:37] it it breaks the elements of that ink it
[1:18:40] breaks the power and it sends it back
[1:18:43] amen all them elements that that came to
[1:18:46] make uh that ink has now been broken up
[1:18:49] and there's no such thing as ink in that
[1:18:51] bleach he said that's the if bleach can
[1:18:54] do that how much more powerful can the
[1:18:57] blood of Jesus Christ uh take a man's
[1:19:00] sins and so with it's confessed and
[1:19:04] dropped in that blood it you well
[1:19:07] brother Bram said you'll never be able
[1:19:09] to find it
[1:19:10] again ain't that right you'll never be
[1:19:13] able to find it again brother Bram says
[1:19:16] the coloring of sin goes back through
[1:19:18] the mediators and down through the time
[1:19:20] until it hits the accuser Satan and lays
[1:19:22] on him not you if lays on him till the
[1:19:26] day of judgment see what happens to the
[1:19:29] son he now becomes imperfect fellowship
[1:19:33] with the father again he's no longer in
[1:19:36] a Chasm he's now brought back in
[1:19:39] Fellowship through the blood of Jesus
[1:19:42] Christ into fellowship with the father
[1:19:45] ain't that right he said see he's becom
[1:19:48] in perfect fellowship with the father
[1:19:50] again standing on the other side of the
[1:19:52] chasm with no remembrance of sin against
[1:19:56] him there's no stain of bleach can be
[1:19:58] seen anywhere he's
[1:20:00] free how many's free he's free now that
[1:20:05] means something now you're not just free
[1:20:07] as an American a lot of people said well
[1:20:09] I'm American I'm free to do whatever
[1:20:11] want to but they're still bound there's
[1:20:13] a lot of people walk in the streets
[1:20:15] today amen and they're bound but the
[1:20:17] blood of Jesus Christ has literally set
[1:20:20] us free that even if you were in prison
[1:20:23] you're still free even though you were
[1:20:26] in man-made shackles you're still free
[1:20:29] and there is no devil of hell that can
[1:20:31] bind you again now you think of that
[1:20:34] Chasm when man was on this side of the
[1:20:37] chasm he lost what God's purpose was for
[1:20:40] him he lost the thoughts of God Amen God
[1:20:43] become a mystery to him the purpose of
[1:20:46] God become mystery everything about God
[1:20:48] was a mystery but when that Chasm was
[1:20:51] broken or or repaired and the breach was
[1:20:54] prepared uh repaired and the man was
[1:20:57] able to come back in Fellowship amen now
[1:21:00] comes to him again what God's purpose is
[1:21:03] for him now comes again what God had
[1:21:07] intended for him to be in the first
[1:21:11] place you believe
[1:21:14] that so now brother Bram said see
[1:21:18] there's no more stain of bleach can be
[1:21:20] seen anywhere he's free Hallelujah just
[1:21:23] as that Chlor Clorox and or that ink can
[1:21:26] never be ink no more because it's broke
[1:21:29] up you can't go down there amen say well
[1:21:32] I'm going to get that ink I'm going to I
[1:21:34] I'm going to I'm going to pour you know
[1:21:36] sift that uh that bucket of bleach and
[1:21:39] and and sift it through a strainer until
[1:21:41] I find that ink you'll never find it
[1:21:44] there's no such thing as ink in that in
[1:21:46] there amen it's been broke up not hid
[1:21:51] it's broke it's demolished it's
[1:21:53] destroyed
[1:21:57] now so he says and when s confessed sin
[1:22:00] is confessed and dipped into the blood
[1:22:04] he says see a man or a woman that's been
[1:22:06] dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it
[1:22:08] kills all
[1:22:10] symptoms every molecule of sin goes back
[1:22:13] to the devil and laid on him till the
[1:22:14] day of judgment where his eternal
[1:22:17] destination will be thrown into a lake
[1:22:19] of fire and the chasm is bridged and
[1:22:22] never to come into remembrance no more
[1:22:27] and a man stands Justified as a Son of
[1:22:31] God God made a way for you to come back
[1:22:36] to your
[1:22:37] inheritance God made a way it's one
[1:22:40] thing to preach about your inheritance
[1:22:42] but if your if the chasm is still there
[1:22:44] there's no way for you to come into your
[1:22:46] inheritance there's no way for you to
[1:22:49] understand what God is wanting of you
[1:22:51] but in this age there's been a voice and
[1:22:55] that voice is the voice of the blood
[1:22:57] that says you're forgiven there is no
[1:22:59] sin against you you are Justified as
[1:23:03] though you had never done it in the
[1:23:05] first
[1:23:06] place it's the voice of the blood on now
[1:23:10] screaming
[1:23:11] out can you say amen and a man stands
[1:23:15] Justified as a Son of God brother bradam
[1:23:19] says now look when that real genuine
[1:23:22] birth of the Holy Spirit comes into a
[1:23:24] man he's a Son of God not pretend you're
[1:23:29] not pretending to be a daughter of God
[1:23:31] it ain't a myth that we're preaching
[1:23:34] here it is a literal
[1:23:37] thing you stand as a Son of God and have
[1:23:40] more uh greater Authority than even the
[1:23:43] president of the United States you have
[1:23:45] even greater Authority than the Angels
[1:23:47] that's right
[1:23:49] prise it's what a prophet
[1:23:51] said you have more Authority than your
[1:23:53] angel he he said he said what what what
[1:23:56] is recognized more the prayer of an
[1:23:58] angel or a prayer of a Son of God he's a
[1:24:00] Son of God Amen he said what has more
[1:24:03] Authority than an angel or a son he said
[1:24:06] a son he said an angel's just a servant
[1:24:09] and it's at your bidding amen now you
[1:24:14] know angels are here to help you believe
[1:24:17] angels are here to help you when you're
[1:24:19] struggling angels of God are here right
[1:24:22] now to move you into a fa higher Faith
[1:24:26] yeah Prophet teaches it that's right the
[1:24:29] Angels they're here for you amen that's
[1:24:35] right yes sir now watch he said now when
[1:24:38] that real genuine birth of the Holy
[1:24:40] Spirit comes into a man he's the son of
[1:24:43] God there is no Chasm everybody say
[1:24:45] there is no
[1:24:46] Chasm between him and God there is no
[1:24:50] Chasm between you and
[1:24:52] God it's true am Satan wants to tell you
[1:24:56] there's a Chasm but there's
[1:24:58] not see he is his son in his presence so
[1:25:05] you're no longer as Adam kicked out God
[1:25:08] made a way you are an Adam
[1:25:13] restored into the presence of God again
[1:25:16] right amen that's right which means
[1:25:20] you're no longer a sinner yeah amen
[1:25:26] I know we've talked about this but
[1:25:28] you're no longer a
[1:25:30] sinner the blood of God has so
[1:25:33] powerfully washed you well didn't Paul

[1:25:46] Brown said it was the perfect blood that
[1:25:47] is loost loosed you and if it was
[1:25:49] perfect blood that had loosed you then
[1:25:51] it's brought a perfect loosening right

[1:25:56] loosening not just one little string and
[1:25:59] loosed you not just the loosening of the
[1:26:01] handcuffs to make you uh your life
[1:26:04] easier for you but the handcuffs have
[1:26:07] been
[1:26:08] destroyed the Rope has been taken off

[1:26:18] you amen that's right we uh the family
[1:26:22] and the young man
[1:26:24] we we uh went up to the star there in
[1:26:27] Rono last night to look over the
[1:26:30] city and there was a another young man

[1:27:27] most thing in your past that you would
[1:27:30] like to
[1:27:32] forget and I I said
[1:27:36] well you know I I I I said uh to be
[1:27:39] honest there's no way that you can
[1:27:41] forget your past you know so there'd be
[1:27:44] no way to dwell on that and wishing you
[1:27:47] could forget this and forget that what's
[1:27:49] done is done and you know it'll always
[1:27:52] your memory will be there so there's no
[1:27:55] man that could ever really forget his
[1:27:57] past that's said people have tried to
[1:28:00] run from their past for years and
[1:28:02] because it haunts them and and things
[1:28:04] like that but I said young man I I said
[1:28:07] there is one that can forget your past
[1:28:12] and I said that's
[1:28:15] God and he got wide eyed he said oh
[1:28:18] really you know and and so I said you
[1:28:21] know I I said you know to think of it
[1:28:23] you know he's God having an infinite
[1:28:26] mind knows the end from the beginning I
[1:28:29] said I don't know if you know God or
[1:28:31] anything like that but I said I am a
[1:28:32] Christian and I I I'm a Believer in God
[1:28:37] and I I said you know God uh he knows
[1:28:40] where I am at all times he knows every
[1:28:43] thought that we think I said he even
[1:28:45] knows you and and these things and and
[1:28:48] um I said he actually knows us better
[1:28:50] than
[1:28:52] ourselves but I I said one thing though
[1:28:55] that God wanted to do is he wanted to
[1:28:58] forget about your past he wanted to
[1:29:01] forget what you are as a sinner and I
[1:29:04] said so what he done is he created a
[1:29:08] blood and that would make him
[1:29:12] forget and it is so powerful that even
[1:29:15] an infinite God that knows the end from
[1:29:17] the
[1:29:18] beginning that knows every flea that's
[1:29:21] bad its eye that knows the the the depth
[1:29:23] of each each breath not only ours but
[1:29:27] every horse every cow every hippopotamus
[1:29:30] every lion down to the mosquitoes to to
[1:29:33] whatever every heartbeat on the face of
[1:29:36] the Earth God knows and he counts them
[1:29:41] and yet he creates such a blood that is
[1:29:43] so powerful there's one thing he can't
[1:29:46] remember is my
[1:29:49] sins my
[1:29:51] past and because of this is I am free
[1:29:56] from my past I can actually walk away
[1:30:00] from my past because the one thing that
[1:30:04] matters is whether he knows my past or
[1:30:07] not whether he's going to hold that
[1:30:10] accountable to me but because he's made
[1:30:13] a blood there's nothing held against me
[1:30:17] that even though I know what I've done
[1:30:19] in the natural I can even try to remind
[1:30:22] God about what I done and he just says
[1:30:25] what sins are you talking about there's
[1:30:28] nothing he can remember because he's the
[1:30:31] one that created the sea of
[1:30:33] forgetfulness I don't know where that
[1:30:35] sea is he says there's a sea there he
[1:30:38] created it for
[1:30:40] himself that even when Satan comes to me
[1:30:44] and reminds me of my past amen it
[1:30:47] doesn't affect my relationship with God
[1:30:50] right I am a son of God
[1:30:54] and even though my past might haunt me
[1:30:56] in my mind a lot of things of regrets
[1:30:59] and wishes things I wish have I could
[1:31:01] have redone and all that I still ain't a
[1:31:04] sinner in the sight of God that's
[1:31:07] right hallu I don't know how he took it
[1:31:10] but he was
[1:31:12] kind but you see he cannot remember them
[1:31:16] now God did this why would God do this
[1:31:20] to restore us back to where we would no
[1:31:23] longer longer be under bondage of the
[1:31:25] devil how how could you be a conqueror
[1:31:28] as a sinner how could you be an
[1:31:31] overcomer a possessor of your
[1:31:34] inheritance if Satan is dictating your
[1:31:37] life but God has broken the power of
[1:31:40] Darkness over your
[1:31:42] life are you with me yes sir amen broken
[1:31:47] that power see so now God did that so we
[1:31:50] can come into our inheritance now notice
[1:31:53] brother said Jesus never left you you an
[1:31:56] inheritance he never left us an
[1:31:58] inheritance he only came down and paid
[1:32:01] for your inheritance can you say Amen
[1:32:04] say it with me he paid my for my
[1:32:07] inheritance he paid for my inheritance
[1:32:10] he didn't give us our inheritance he
[1:32:13] paid for our inheritance and brought you
[1:32:16] to your
[1:32:17] inheritance ain't that right amen the
[1:32:20] blood has already been paid it's all
[1:32:23] already bought the your Redemption is
[1:32:26] already been paid for 2,000 years ago
[1:32:29] but in this age there is a book that has
[1:32:32] been opened and your name is
[1:32:35] there and every promise in the book is
[1:32:38] yours it's your inheritance you don't
[1:32:41] have to be sick you don't have to be
[1:32:43] beggarly you don't have to be down and
[1:32:46] brokenhearted you don't have to have
[1:32:48] that Spirit of anxiety and
[1:32:50] depression you don't have to have that
[1:32:52] unbelief hanging on you you
[1:32:55] yes you believe it
[1:32:58] am see your name was put on the Lamb's
[1:33:01] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:33:02] the world God gave you your
[1:33:06] inheritance whether you deserved it or
[1:33:09] not that didn't
[1:33:11] matter he gave it to you before the
[1:33:13] foundation of the world you love him
[1:33:16] Amen brother Brown said see your
[1:33:18] inheritance was first before the lamb
[1:33:21] your inheritance was first before the
[1:33:24] blood was shed your inheritance was
[1:33:26] first before the foundation of the world
[1:33:29] ain't that right Jesus only come he says
[1:33:32] now here's the way here's the way they
[1:33:34] tried to make it well God said there's a
[1:33:37] lot of people lost I don't want them you
[1:33:39] know lost I want him to be saved so I'll
[1:33:41] send Jesus down and perhaps maybe maybe
[1:33:44] somebody will feel sorry and know what
[1:33:47] I've done and get saved oh mercy he said
[1:33:50] I wouldn't run my office like that even
[1:33:51] as poor as I do run it some times then
[1:33:54] see I wouldn't do it like that well how
[1:33:57] about God see God by his foreign
[1:33:59] knowledge seen exactly who would be
[1:34:01] saved and who wouldn't be saved He sent
[1:34:04] Jesus to save those that he already
[1:34:06] chosen see didn't Paul say uh uh uh uh
[1:34:11] five verses behind this I believe
[1:34:13] speaking in about Ephesians that he
[1:34:16] chose us in him before the there was
[1:34:18] even a world that's our inheritance God
[1:34:20] chose us aren't you glad God chose you
[1:34:24] that's your
[1:34:27] inheritance he chose you to every
[1:34:31] promise that's what makes this word so
[1:34:33] real that's that's why the message is so
[1:34:35] dear to us it takes the promises and
[1:34:39] hands them to us in our lap and lets us
[1:34:43] know it's yours you've got a right to
[1:34:45] claim it don't you let the devil talk
[1:34:48] you out of your healing don't you let
[1:34:50] the devil talk you out of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:53] don't you let the devil talk you out of
[1:34:55] a
[1:34:57] Rapture and you say Amen it's your
[1:35:00] inheritance he chose you see so he says
[1:35:04] see that's our inheritance God chose us
[1:35:07] and let Jesus come and pay the price the
[1:35:10] what his shedding of his blood that no
[1:35:13] sin would be accounted to
[1:35:16] us nothing you
[1:35:19] do then he takes that scripture he that
[1:35:21] sins willfully after receiving the
[1:35:23] knowledge of the truth there's no more
[1:35:25] sacrifice he said now there's where
[1:35:27] you'll rise up again and say brother
[1:35:29] bradam how about that but just remember
[1:35:32] who have received the knowledge of the
[1:35:34] truth they never receive the truth they
[1:35:37] just receive the knowledge of it yes but
[1:35:41] there was a is a people on this earth
[1:35:43] like Caleb that reeded the
[1:35:46] truth and wouldn't let it go they
[1:35:49] received it can you say amen amen look
[1:35:53] at the 10 spies that went over that
[1:35:56] land they received the knowledge of what
[1:35:58] was in that land they saw the land in
[1:36:00] which they were to be placed they
[1:36:03] partook of the evidence of that land but
[1:36:06] then what did they do they had the
[1:36:07] knowledge of it but then they gave an
[1:36:09] evil report to the people so much that
[1:36:13] their Ministry their voice caused the
[1:36:16] people's hearts to
[1:36:17] melt think of it I don't want a Ministry
[1:36:20] like that I'd rather stand there
[1:36:22] proclaiming the promise of
[1:36:25] God to whoever even if it's to the
[1:36:30] cows yeah than to have such an evil
[1:36:34] report of negativity that would cause
[1:36:37] the people's hearts to
[1:36:40] melt can you say Amen yes sir we're not
[1:36:44] here dwelling on what you are in in in
[1:36:47] the physical we're not here dwelling
[1:36:48] upon your mistakes we're not here
[1:36:50] dwelling upon the the the limitations
[1:36:53] that you might have whether you're
[1:36:54] talented or not talented smart or not
[1:36:57] smart that doesn't matter there is a
[1:37:02] promise
[1:37:04] amen can you say Amen
[1:37:08] sir see so they partook of it but they
[1:37:11] gave an evil report of it down Through
[1:37:14] the Ages God has given a Revival to the
[1:37:18] church down Through the Ages can you say
[1:37:22] amen amen they saw the land brother BR
[1:37:25] talks about it he said let's just say
[1:37:26] the land is the Holy Ghost he said they
[1:37:29] saw the land they tasted of it amen in
[1:37:33] other words you you can't tell me that
[1:37:35] any god-given Revival that came to the
[1:37:37] people was just some formal intellectual
[1:37:40] Revival come on no sir it was it was an
[1:37:45] evidence that there's a land it's an
[1:37:47] Evidence of the Holy
[1:37:49] Spirit can you say Amen brother BR said
[1:37:52] they had the supernatural all the way
[1:37:54] down Through the Ages they had tongues
[1:37:56] they had prophecy they had they had all
[1:37:58] these things amen down Through the
[1:38:01] Ages true hello yes sir amen Luther
[1:38:05] spoke in
[1:38:07] tongues yes sir it's what brother Bram
[1:38:09] said Wesley had Supernatural Miracles
[1:38:13] with
[1:38:14] him every age has had an Evidence of a
[1:38:18] land ain't that right amen amen that's
[1:38:22] right they've all experienced some
[1:38:24] Supernatural power of God whether it be
[1:38:26] a portion or whatever but what did the
[1:38:28] lutherans do they gave an evil report of
[1:38:31] it what did the weslan do give an evil
[1:38:34] report of it what did the Pentecostal
[1:38:36] AES do gave an evil report of it that's
[1:38:39] right yes yes sir and what's happened
[1:38:43] just like it did with them 10 spies and
[1:38:45] all those that believed it they died and
[1:38:48] every age that church has died because
[1:38:51] they went and they went into form alism
[1:38:54] amen amen to where the lutherans don't
[1:38:56] even resemble what Luther was when he
[1:38:59] first brought the message the wesle
[1:39:01] don't even resemble what Wesley was when
[1:39:03] he first brought the message the
[1:39:05] Pentecostals don't even resemble what it
[1:39:07] was on ausa Street that's exactly right
[1:39:11] can you say Amen they've all gone to
[1:39:13] formalism and formalism is a death
[1:39:16] sentence by turning down the word of God
[1:39:19] God forbid that we would get so formal
[1:39:22] dead and dried up where we don't even
[1:39:25] know the power of God
[1:39:27] anymore can you say Amen sir that's
[1:39:30] right we need the power of God do you
[1:39:33] believe that we need the power of God
[1:39:35] how else is Caleb going to defeat them
[1:39:39] Giants he said I'll be able to do it if
[1:39:41] the Lord is with me and so is it with
[1:39:44] us try to do it on your own self you'll
[1:39:47] die just as much you'll be
[1:39:49] defeated ain't that right well what is
[1:39:52] formalism it's the the practice or the
[1:39:54] doctrine of strict adherence to
[1:39:56] prescribed or external
[1:39:59] forms everything's got to be just right
[1:40:01] everything's got to be this way you know
[1:40:03] formalism come into the church when
[1:40:05] Catholicism was born at ner Rome brother
[1:40:08] Brown said they organized and set
[1:40:10] together a church called The Universal
[1:40:12] Church there they made a universal
[1:40:14] prayer they had a perfect harmony that
[1:40:17] was their idea of Harmony where
[1:40:19] everybody said the same prayer at the
[1:40:21] same time
[1:40:23] oh everybody had everything just exactly
[1:40:26] right that's what they do today
[1:40:28] everybody around the world's got to have
[1:40:29] a certain time that they all play the
[1:40:32] same thing and listen to the same thing
[1:40:34] and all of these things and they call
[1:40:36] that Unity that's not Unity amen amen
[1:40:40] see so they had a perfect harmony
[1:40:43] everybody had to be together everybody
[1:40:45] had to say the same thing the same
[1:40:47] prayer was was said that was formalism
[1:40:50] that had come into the church
[1:40:55] but if you notice
[1:40:57] Caleb he had a different Spirit than
[1:40:59] them others it's what the Bible said he
[1:41:01] had a different
[1:41:03] spirit amen as I said before the word
[1:41:06] had become so real to him how through
[1:41:09] the preaching of the Gospel through the
[1:41:11] preaching of the word ain't that what
[1:41:14] Paul said Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:41:15] hearing come by the word of God yes it
[1:41:18] becomes so real to him the word becomes
[1:41:20] so precious and so real to him that he
[1:41:24] would not let it
[1:41:26] go no sir this is where you know we we
[1:41:29] talked about it where Paul said what
[1:41:31] said that the word is NY even in thy
[1:41:34] mouth everybody say in thy mouth what is
[1:41:37] in thy mouth the word is NY even in
[1:41:40] thine mouth and in thine heart that is
[1:41:44] the word of faith which we
[1:41:47] preach brother Braham said now the only
[1:41:49] thing that God can do to make his word
[1:41:52] real is to get some good preacher who
[1:41:54] can preach the word that's the official
[1:41:56] and the initial way can you say Amen yes
[1:42:00] sir that's what God does he sends a
[1:42:02] preacher anoints that preacher Amen to
[1:42:05] preach the gospel and we all know what
[1:42:07] the gospel is it's the word made Power
[1:42:11] the word demonstrated so it isn't just
[1:42:13] something here just saying some little
[1:42:14] old thing no no it's the word being
[1:42:17] demonstrated and it's building our faith
[1:42:20] so what we have seen in this day is a
[1:42:22] prophet come with thus say the Lord a
[1:42:24] Divine word and we saw it Dov tail with
[1:42:27] scripture after scripture after
[1:42:29] scripture and now it's our turn to
[1:42:32] preach this same message in the gospel
[1:42:35] to build faith not build doubt not to
[1:42:38] bring division not to bring confusion
[1:42:40] can you say Amen why we've got an
[1:42:45] inheritance
[1:42:48] right so the gospel is the word made
[1:42:51] power now as I get ready to close what
[1:42:54] caused Adam to lose his
[1:42:57] inheritance well brother brandham said
[1:42:59] he turned loose of the word the very
[1:43:02] thing that he needed he did he didn't
[1:43:05] need to had no tricks he didn't needed
[1:43:07] no psychology he didn't need to be smart
[1:43:11] he didn't need to know the ways of the
[1:43:13] world he just needed the word and God
[1:43:16] gave him that word to live
[1:43:20] by and as long as he had the word he had
[1:43:25] Dominion his domain was the earth he
[1:43:28] lived as a
[1:43:30] God he could speak to the winds peace be
[1:43:34] still and it would happen I think it was
[1:43:36] brother Wendell that so uh uh just
[1:43:38] wonderful message Sunday but he had put
[1:43:41] it you know talked about it you know
[1:43:43] he'd speak to a tree be PL move plucked
[1:43:45] up and planted over here and it would
[1:43:47] happen he he he could move mountains he
[1:43:50] could say I don't like that mountain
[1:43:52] right there you know it's in my way of
[1:43:54] the sunset so he would say Mountain be
[1:43:56] be moved and be over here he could re he
[1:43:59] could replace the Earth and and and do
[1:44:01] whatever he wanted to with the Earth if
[1:44:04] not replace but you know what I
[1:44:06] mean and and and so but he did that by
[1:44:11] hanging on to the word that God gave him
[1:44:15] but when he turned loose of the word he
[1:44:19] lost his
[1:44:21] inheritance and the prophet said when he
[1:44:23] lost his life he also lost his
[1:44:25] inheritance in life because he had
[1:44:28] completely con Supreme control of the
[1:44:30] earth he was a god of the earth God's
[1:44:32] the god of the universe everywhere but
[1:44:34] his son had this Earth under his own
[1:44:36] control he could speak he could name he
[1:44:38] could say he could stop nature he could
[1:44:40] do anything he wanted to but when he did
[1:44:43] that he lost his inheritance see Adam
[1:44:46] could say let this mountain be moved
[1:44:48] over here uh uh over there and it would
[1:44:50] do it see Adam could say let this tree
[1:44:53] uh uh here be plucked up and planted
[1:44:55] over here it would do it for he had
[1:44:57] complete Supreme control as a minor God
[1:44:59] under God our father because he was a
[1:45:02] Son of God he said oh now couldn't we
[1:45:04] stop here just a minute and get back to
[1:45:07] our real sermon then if the blood has
[1:45:09] cleansed it back what about now look at
[1:45:13] look what that Son of God the second
[1:45:15] Adam did he and then he says the works
[1:45:18] that I do shall you do also see Adam
[1:45:22] lost his in in itance the earth now it
[1:45:24] passed from his hand to the one he swed
[1:45:27] out to Satan he swed his faith in God to
[1:45:30] Satan's reasoning therefore his eternal
[1:45:32] life his right to the Tree of Life his
[1:45:34] right to the Earth belonged to him and
[1:45:36] he forfeited every bit of it to the
[1:45:38] hands of Satan he passed it from his
[1:45:41] hand to Satan now there has been he said
[1:45:44] it it it returned and has been polluted
[1:45:47] and the seed of Adam has destroyed the
[1:45:49] inheritance that Adam should have had
[1:45:51] and that's the Earth ain't that right
[1:45:54] why because Adam L let go of the word
[1:45:58] but there was a Caleb that was a type of
[1:46:01] this last day bride that would follow
[1:46:04] that end time messenger that would not
[1:46:07] turn loose of the word no
[1:46:11] sir everyone else let go of
[1:46:14] it and you think of it these stem spies
[1:46:18] they were probably no doubt men of great
[1:46:21] reputation they must
[1:46:24] have it a some old
[1:46:28] beggar they must have had great standing
[1:46:31] among the
[1:46:33] people right because what they said so
[1:46:36] turned them from the message of the hour
[1:46:39] so turned them what they said caused
[1:46:42] their hearts to melt CU they must have
[1:46:45] had great respect for these men great
[1:46:49] respect that would turn their heart from
[1:46:52] the message
[1:46:53] and they let go of the
[1:46:55] word that Caleb wouldn't let go no sir
[1:47:00] he wouldn't let go of that word aren't
[1:47:02] you glad for
[1:47:03] that yes sir see God sent the
[1:47:08] prophet Moses to give word give his word
[1:47:12] to the
[1:47:14] people Moses wasn't just a prophet he
[1:47:16] was the
[1:47:17] manifestation of the word that was given
[1:47:19] to Abraham and God Vindicated Moses
[1:47:23] before the people you think of that the
[1:47:25] people had saw the supernatural they had
[1:47:28] saw the the Red Sea open they had saw
[1:47:33] you know their clothes never wore out
[1:47:34] their shoes never never grew old did you
[1:47:38] know every time they were hungry God fed
[1:47:40] them every time they were thirsty there
[1:47:41] was a rock that followed them oh my and
[1:47:44] it wasn't just a little tricker you know
[1:47:47] a trickle it it was a gushing it was a
[1:47:50] such a gushing that that it actually
[1:47:52] last Ed I mean there was still water
[1:47:55] years later when when when uh was it
[1:47:59] Jehoshaphat and Ahab join made Alliance
[1:48:02] and and they were they they wandered out
[1:48:04] in the desert and they were they were
[1:48:06] thirsty they were about to die and all
[1:48:08] that and and they remembered there was a
[1:48:10] prophet Elisha and and the prophet
[1:48:13] Elisha told them to start digging and
[1:48:16] and the prophet Elisha knew that there
[1:48:18] was water under there that flow from
[1:48:21] that rock
[1:48:23] and when they were digging that's what a
[1:48:25] prophet said now that and and he told
[1:48:27] them to dig because there was water
[1:48:29] there and when they dug the water began
[1:48:32] to Spring
[1:48:33] forth that wasn't a little trickle of
[1:48:36] water that come from that rock it was a
[1:48:38] Guster and yet these men with an evil
[1:48:41] report made their hearts to melt that
[1:48:45] they would forget about their
[1:48:46] inheritance they would forget about the
[1:48:48] supernatural that was with them they
[1:48:49] would forget about everything all right
[1:48:53] yeah and they
[1:48:55] died oh church do you love
[1:48:59] him you would think that God wasted his
[1:49:02] time in sending Moses to to them or that
[1:49:06] he wasted his time in proving to them
[1:49:08] time in time
[1:49:09] again see but God didn't waste his time
[1:49:13] for the word was sent to a predestinated
[1:49:16] people and all out of all them millions
[1:49:20] of people there was only two that really
[1:49:22] knew what it was all about and that was
[1:49:25] Caleb and Joshua sir they stayed with
[1:49:28] the word they stayed with it can you
[1:49:30] amen and there is a people that's going
[1:49:33] to stay with it in this age church if I
[1:49:37] can just encourage you don't get
[1:49:38] discouraged keep pressing on keep
[1:49:41] pressing on can you say Amen if you'll
[1:49:44] watch the pattern of every Son of God
[1:49:47] remember as we talked about you know it
[1:49:50] but before the people could God would
[1:49:51] allow the people to going to the
[1:49:53] promised land he brought them to their
[1:49:54] final testing and that was that Kadesh
[1:49:57] barnea right and and and Kadesh Baria
[1:50:01] means judgment it's it's it's testing
[1:50:03] time and and it was a testing time for
[1:50:06] the people they had to make their
[1:50:08] judgment they had to judge between God's
[1:50:11] word and and an evil report their faith
[1:50:14] was to be tested to see if they really
[1:50:16] had the faith that to to believe because
[1:50:20] God would not allow unbelief to enter
[1:50:22] into that land unbelief that kept them
[1:50:24] from entering into that land there had
[1:50:26] to be a Heart full of Faith Can you say
[1:50:29] Amen they didn't need another Prophet
[1:50:32] amen God had already sent him a prophet
[1:50:35] amen so so God didn't say okay you know
[1:50:38] before I be before I you know y'all I
[1:50:41] send the 10 spies and all that i' I've
[1:50:43] got to send you another Prophet along so
[1:50:45] so you can get this and so you can
[1:50:47] really understand because maybe Moses
[1:50:49] ain't making it clear to y'all I I don't
[1:50:51] believe that just as much as I don't
[1:50:53] believe we need another Prophet to lead
[1:50:54] this bride around I I believe that God
[1:50:57] sent a prophet of Malachi 4 and he was
[1:50:59] so clear that a Believer can understand
[1:51:02] that every promise is for them and they
[1:51:05] will lay hold to that word that's right
[1:51:08] yes sir I just believe that
[1:51:11] amen see so so we look at these things
[1:51:15] it would be nice it would be nice if God
[1:51:19] would have just let everybody just hear
[1:51:21] Moses hear Moses just here
[1:51:23] Moses but God allowed the 10 spies to go
[1:51:26] over knowing knowing that they had an
[1:51:29] evil heart of unbelief knowing what they
[1:51:32] were going to do he allowed them to see
[1:51:34] the evidence of the land but he also
[1:51:35] allowed them to see the Giants the
[1:51:38] obstacles everything there and then they
[1:51:40] would come back and of course they would
[1:51:42] forget about the evidence they would
[1:51:44] override the evidence and everything
[1:51:46] that God said in his word and saw the
[1:51:48] truthness of it the manifestation of it
[1:51:51] and all they saw was GI all they saw was
[1:51:53] The Impossibles all they saw and then
[1:51:56] they began God would allow them to voice
[1:51:58] it out to the people God would allow
[1:52:02] them at Kadesh barnea just before they
[1:52:04] would cross into the land to see where
[1:52:07] they were with this can you say Amen yes
[1:52:10] sir see and it would be so great if God
[1:52:14] would keep the negative away from the
[1:52:16] message of the hour it'd be great if he
[1:52:20] would just keep us from I'm saying all
[1:52:23] the
[1:52:24] negative amongst around the message the
[1:52:27] message ranks and around the church and
[1:52:30] in from our home and it'd be
[1:52:33] nice if he had just only let us see all
[1:52:36] positive about
[1:52:39] everything that God allows people to
[1:52:41] rise up in a church and cause division
[1:52:43] he allows people to rise up with an evil
[1:52:45] Port report about the message and the
[1:52:47] messenger he allows us to see and to
[1:52:50] hear what the make believers are doing
[1:52:53] and what they are saying he allows us to
[1:52:56] come to this to where we have to make
[1:52:59] our
[1:53:00] choice but I tell you what church as for
[1:53:02] me in my house as Joshua said I'm going
[1:53:04] to serve the Lord I'm going to serve the
[1:53:07] Lord no matter what it takes can you say
[1:53:11] Amen yep God lets us see the good and
[1:53:13] the ugly but he does it to see where
[1:53:16] your faith is and even Jesus had to be
[1:53:19] tested he had to be tried but he
[1:53:21] withstood every bit of
[1:53:23] he stayed right with the word of God he
[1:53:25] defeated Satan upon the word of God you
[1:53:27] ain't going to defeat Satan on your
[1:53:29] personality your charisma you ain't
[1:53:31] going to defeat Satan by being grouchy
[1:53:33] and by by by you know uh uh uh gossiping
[1:53:37] you you ain't going to defeat Satan by
[1:53:39] dancing and shouting and being talented
[1:53:42] you'll defeat him only by the word of
[1:53:45] God and and God has already given us the
[1:53:47] word God's already given us the Word of
[1:53:49] Promise in this age amen all I believe
[1:53:52] it that's right I believe it do you
[1:53:55] believe it if the musicians will come
[1:53:58] God bless
[1:54:01] you brother brah talks about he says the
[1:54:04] Seed of Abraham must first be tested to
[1:54:07] see if they really believe the word
[1:54:09] remember the only way that he could keep
[1:54:11] the promises of God because he believed
[1:54:13] the promise of God I'll say that again
[1:54:16] the only way that he could keep the
[1:54:19] promise of God is because he believed
[1:54:21] the promise of God it's the only way
[1:54:24] we'll keep the promise of God is when we
[1:54:25] believe the promise of God and was
[1:54:28] tested whether he believed it or not we
[1:54:30] are brought to that test the Seed of
[1:54:32] Abraham today is brought to that test
[1:54:35] will we take God's word or will we take
[1:54:37] what man said about it will we take what
[1:54:40] some organization has made up as a Creed
[1:54:43] and accept that or do we take what God
[1:54:45] said if God's word is true we believe
[1:54:48] God's word regardless of what anything
[1:54:50] else is we let Every Man's word be a lie
[1:54:54] and God's be truth the true Seed of
[1:54:57] Abraham but before you can become that
[1:55:00] true seed you've got to go through the
[1:55:02] test like Abraham did himself he
[1:55:05] promised not only to Abraham but to his
[1:55:07] seed would that but his seed would
[1:55:09] possess the enemy's Gates oh my just
[1:55:12] think the patriarch was fully persuaded
[1:55:14] in it in his test of the promise of the
[1:55:17] word of God it was right see regardless
[1:55:20] of what the circumstances was he still
[1:55:22] believed the word was right the Abraham
[1:55:25] the great patriarch never wavered in
[1:55:27] faith when he was brought to that
[1:55:29] testing time he believed that God was
[1:55:31] able to raise him up from the dead he
[1:55:33] believed it because God made the promise
[1:55:35] and when God made a promise that he
[1:55:37] would be father of Nations see uh uh he
[1:55:40] believed that that was so he didn't know
[1:55:43] how it would be when the baby come after
[1:55:46] he had trusted 25 years and then asked
[1:55:49] to destroy the baby he still knew that
[1:55:51] God's promise was true and he gave his
[1:55:54] son see his seed is the same thing the
[1:55:58] promise of God is the seal to those who
[1:56:01] are the Seed of Abraham the promise is a
[1:56:03] seal a signed witness and when we
[1:56:05] believe every promised word then the
[1:56:07] seal is given to us to confirm the
[1:56:10] promised by oh aren't you glad for that
[1:56:13] being the Seed of Abraham we go through
[1:56:15] the test whether we're going to believe
[1:56:16] the Bible or not the Bible is this word
[1:56:19] of God see it is it it is because it is
[1:56:22] God and then after you've went through
[1:56:25] the test to believe when some of them
[1:56:27] says well the days of Miracles has
[1:56:28] passed if you accept that that's
[1:56:31] contrary to the word if you say you do
[1:56:33] not receive the Holy Ghost today there's
[1:56:35] no such thing just the 12 apostles
[1:56:37] received it well the word said Peter
[1:56:40] preaching it on the day of Pentecost he
[1:56:42] said repent every one of you be baptized
[1:56:43] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:56:45] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:56:47] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:56:48] the promises unto you and to your
[1:56:50] children to them that's a far off even
[1:56:52] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:56:54] that's exactly what it means so now if
[1:56:59] you're ready to take the test of God's
[1:57:01] acid test and follow that prescription
[1:57:04] I'm telling you you will find out that
[1:57:06] God keeps his word if you'll believe it
[1:57:08] can you say Amen you love him we could
[1:57:11] go on and on and on about this see but
[1:57:14] when it's done amen we take that test
[1:57:18] knowing that his word is right God's
[1:57:21] word is right
[1:57:23] God's word can you say that with me
[1:57:24] God's word is right do you believe it
[1:57:26] God's word is right God's word is
[1:57:31] right God's word is
[1:57:35] right I'm sure when Caleb saw that giant
[1:57:40] first giant standing
[1:57:42] there and he wasn't meeting he might
[1:57:46] [Music]
[1:57:49] die I'm sure he no doubt in his heart
[1:57:53] maybe in his mouth God's word is right
[1:57:57] God's word is
[1:57:58] right and I have every right to defeat
[1:58:01] you John because God's word is right and
[1:58:05] you lift your hands unto the Lord just
