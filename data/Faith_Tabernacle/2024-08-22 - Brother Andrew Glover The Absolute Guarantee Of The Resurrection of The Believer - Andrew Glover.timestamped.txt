[42:38] brother Kevin back with us and uh
[42:41] brother Bob and Sister Janice and um
[42:46] just all those that were gone maybe over
[42:48] the weekend and and uh just good to have
[42:53] everyone and uh we want to um keep uh
[42:57] sister paty in our prayer and the report
[43:01] that she got her test didn't turn out
[43:03] just the greatest uh at least from the
[43:06] medical standpoint of it but um says her
[43:11] right leg is only getting 40% blood flow
[43:15] and left leg is about 80
[43:18] uh% uh blood flow and then kidneys uh
[43:23] about stage three failure and one of
[43:27] them is even worse than
[43:30] that uh so uh the surgery uh they um you
[43:37] know the blockages in her stomach and
[43:39] leg uh they're saying it's just too
[43:41] risky for surgery at this point and um
[43:46] so she's supposed to be getting a CAT
[43:49] scan on her neck uh there um what they
[43:53] say it's uh the left side is about uh 75
[43:57] 85% blocked and will have to have
[44:00] surgery and uh so we want to just keep
[44:03] her in our prayer you know um there's no
[44:07] problem too hard for
[44:08] God and we we know that uh I think we've

[53:27] says amen amen and amen God bless you
[53:31] tonight if you have your Bibles we want
[53:33] to go to the book of 1 Corinthians the
[53:34] 15th chapter the book of 1 Corinthians
[53:37] the 15th chapter and then we're also
[53:39] going to look in the book of St John the
[53:40] 14th chapter amen 1 Corinthians chapter
[53:44] 15 Amen in verse number one we do want
[53:47] to greet you all tonight in the name of
[53:48] the Lord we sure count it an honor
[53:50] privilege to be able to stand here
[53:51] tonight and speak to you amen from the
[53:53] word of the lord we just pray something
[53:55] will be said to be a blessing to to you
[53:57] in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number one
[54:01] Paul here writing he says moreover
[54:04] Brethren I declare unto you the gospel
[54:07] which I preached unto you which also ye
[54:10] have received somebody say received and
[54:13] wherein ye stand so whatever they
[54:16] received is where they're standing Now
[54:18] by which also ye are saved if you keep
[54:20] in memory what I preached unto you
[54:23] unless you have believed in vain for I
[54:26] delivered unto you first of all that
[54:28] which I also received there's that word
[54:30] received again how that Christ died for
[54:33] our sins now I want you to catch this
[54:35] according to the scriptures so the way
[54:38] that Christ died was according to the
[54:39] scripture and that he was buried and
[54:42] that he rose again the third day
[54:45] according to the scriptures I love that
[54:48] because he's not doing anything outside
[54:51] of the scriptures he died according to
[54:53] the scripture he was born according to
[54:55] the scripture and he rose according to
[54:57] the scripture now in the book of St John
[55:00] the 14th chapter St John's gospel the
[55:03] 14th chapter and the 19th verse brother
[55:06] brandham reads this scripture and it is
[55:08] the rising of the Sun and he says now
[55:11] yet a little while and the world seeth
[55:14] me no more but ye see me because I live
[55:19] ye shall live also brother BR said
[55:22] speaking to his wife because I live ye
[55:26] shall live also amen we ask the Lord
[55:29] this evening to add the blessing to the
[55:31] reading of his word as you can have your
[55:33] seats here this afternoon I want to uh
[55:35] by the help of the Lord for just a few
[55:37] moments tonight if I would if I would
[55:39] take a subject here tonight I want to
[55:40] talk to you for a few moments on the
[55:42] absolute guarantee of the resurrection
[55:45] of the believer amen the absolute
[55:47] guarantee of the resurrection of the
[55:49] believer of course I believe that as we
[55:51] are here tonight amen we're not
[55:53] following any uh religion or any God but
[55:56] rather we're following the Lord Jesus
[55:57] Christ amen then we are firmly
[56:00] established upon the foundation that
[56:02] Christianity is based upon resurrection
[56:05] and it's not based upon replacing you
[56:07] know sometimes we get in our mind amen
[56:09] that it would be easier for God Amen
[56:11] maybe just to replace us or maybe find
[56:13] somebody else but God Amen is not
[56:16] interested in replacing us but rather he
[56:18] is interested in restoring us and
[56:20] resurrecting us now uh from the message
[56:22] I am the resurrection and life brother
[56:24] I'm speaking here uh speaking of job and
[56:26] he says now I know my redeemer liveth
[56:29] and at the last day he will stand upon
[56:32] the Earth for after the skin worms
[56:33] destroy this body yet in my flesh shall
[56:36] I see God brother BR said now he seen
[56:39] the resurrection would be brought about
[56:41] by man someday and the sin question
[56:43] would be settled when that righteous one
[56:46] the Son of God came to die amen for
[56:48] Sinners see there was no man on Earth at
[56:51] that time or no man since that could
[56:53] ever Bridge the way between a holy God
[56:57] and a sinful man there was no man could
[56:59] ever bridge the gap between a holy God
[57:01] and a sinful man but job here 4,000
[57:04] years before his coming amen he saw his
[57:08] death his burial and his resurrection
[57:10] amen and his justification that come by
[57:13] the resurrection he said and the
[57:16] absolute guarantee of the resurrection
[57:18] of the believer now what a comfort it is
[57:21] to know amen that those things are true
[57:24] amen it's not a fiction story
[57:26] amen we are not following cly devis
[57:29] fables amen but whether we are following
[57:32] a Vindicated word of God Amen that has
[57:34] been Vindicated in the heavens it has
[57:36] been Vindicated on the earth and it has
[57:38] been Vindicated in the lives of the
[57:40] Believers now I'll say this the word of
[57:42] God is Not fiction how many can agree
[57:45] amen the word of God is Not fiction I
[57:47] believe amen that it's true and I
[57:49] believe that the results that it Bears
[57:52] amen actually proves that it is the
[57:54] truth brother R said now this is not
[57:56] fiction this is the Bible amen it's
[57:59] God's truth it's his promise I've tried
[58:01] it and tested it and I know you can take
[58:03] God's word and he will make it right
[58:06] with you amen you can take God's word
[58:09] and he will make it right with you amen
[58:11] he will bring it to pass amen I think
[58:14] it's amazing brother Sean has said it
[58:16] over and over that we're here amen
[58:18] preaching the promises of God Amen the
[58:20] promises are not coming from a seminary
[58:23] they're not coming from a denomination
[58:25] amen but rather the these promises are
[58:27] coming from God's word amen and they're
[58:29] not just man's promises but whether
[58:31] they're they're they're rather God's
[58:33] promises and their tried promises
[58:35] they're true promises amen and God
[58:37] always brings his promises to pass now
[58:40] we know by a prophet's teaching amen
[58:42] what the word absolute means how many
[58:44] how many's thankful for a prophet that
[58:46] preaches some sermons called an absolute
[58:48] he says now Webster says amen that it is
[58:51] perfect in itself it is Unlimited in its
[58:54] power it is primarily in all ultimacy
[58:57] amen it's Unlimited in its power amen
[59:00] it's perfect in itself and it really is
[59:02] an ultimate amen it's an absolute see
[59:05] it's Unlimited in its power amen it's
[59:07] perfect in itself and it really is an
[59:10] ultimate now amen some some people amen
[59:13] I think it's funny that we're this far
[59:14] down the road and some people are still
[59:16] trying to determine what the absolute is
[59:18] amen but let's just say what a prophet
[59:20] said he said the absolute is the word of
[59:22] God now I know some people think there's
[59:24] multiple absolutes but really there's
[59:26] only one absolute amen and to a Believer
[59:29] it's not what somebody thinks about the
[59:31] message amen or the way somebody
[59:33] preaches the message but the absolute to
[59:35] a Believer amen is the message of the
[59:38] hour he said see the word absolute is
[59:40] Ultimate therefore he said I think that
[59:43] everybody should have an ultimate see
[59:45] every great achievement that's ever been
[59:47] achieved amen there has been an absolute
[59:50] behind it no matter what it was it's had
[59:52] an absolute behind it every person in
[59:55] order to achieve something has to First
[59:57] have the absolute amen and that's the
[59:59] final wine back through this that back
[1:00:01] to the other amen till you come to the
[1:00:04] absolute or the amen amen or the
[1:00:06] ultimate so when you come to the
[1:00:08] absolute amen there's nothing to be
[1:00:10] added to it and there's nothing to be
[1:00:12] taken from it amen but it is the
[1:00:14] finality he said you've got something to
[1:00:17] tattoo Amen in other words It's the
[1:00:19] final time post to every achievement
[1:00:22] it's somewhere see it might wind through
[1:00:24] many different things till gives to that
[1:00:26] tpost but there's an amen to all of it
[1:00:29] amen there must be such a thing amen you
[1:00:31] cannot go on through life without having
[1:00:34] one amen you cannot go through life
[1:00:36] without having an absolute now amen we
[1:00:39] know what the word absolute means I also
[1:00:41] took time and looked up the word
[1:00:43] guarantee amen the word guarantee amen
[1:00:46] it is a formal promise or Assurance amen
[1:00:49] it is something that is typically in
[1:00:51] writing amen that is certain conditions
[1:00:54] will be fulfilled amen it is something
[1:00:56] that gives a certainty amen of an
[1:00:58] outcome so when you have a guarantee you
[1:01:01] have something in writing amen that will
[1:01:04] give you a certainty of an assurance of
[1:01:06] an outcome let me say the only absolute
[1:01:09] guarantee that I know of Amen is the
[1:01:11] revealed word of God that has been
[1:01:14] brought to us through a Vindicated
[1:01:16] Prophet listen I believe this message is
[1:01:19] written in the Bible but I believe that
[1:01:21] it is interpreted Amen on about 1,200
[1:01:24] books and tapes listen amen we don't
[1:01:26] have to go find what a scripture means
[1:01:29] amen we have an absolute ultimate we
[1:01:31] have a we have a primarily an ultimate
[1:01:33] listen amen if you want to know how to
[1:01:35] baptize go hear what a prophet said if
[1:01:37] you want to know how to take communion
[1:01:39] go hear what a prophet said if you want
[1:01:41] to know how to have church and have
[1:01:42] order and all these different offices
[1:01:44] amen go hear what a prophet said listen
[1:01:47] we are not just another church amen on
[1:01:49] the side of the road following something
[1:01:52] amen we have received an absolute
[1:01:54] guarantee amen and it's not just any
[1:01:56] kind of guarantee amen it's a perfect
[1:01:59] guarantee amen it's a it's a it's a
[1:02:01] primarily an ultimate in itself now you
[1:02:04] all know the prophet of God did not
[1:02:06] replace the Bible amen but rather he
[1:02:08] interpreted the Bible and the Bible was
[1:02:10] wrote by inspiration Timothy says all
[1:02:13] scripture is given amen by inspiration
[1:02:15] of God and is profitable for Doctrine
[1:02:18] for reproof for correction amen for
[1:02:20] instruction in righteousness brother B
[1:02:23] comes along and says many of the
[1:02:24] prophets amen writing they did not know
[1:02:27] what they were writing amen but they
[1:02:29] just wrote it down amen imagine that
[1:02:31] you're just writing amen and all of a
[1:02:33] sudden you find yourself writing
[1:02:35] something and you don't even know what
[1:02:37] you're writing amen see because it was
[1:02:42] inspiration now I'm not one that just
[1:02:44] believes Moses had inspiration or Paul
[1:02:47] had inspiration or Jeremiah or Zechariah
[1:02:50] I believe William brandham had
[1:02:51] inspiration because in 1962 he is told
[1:02:55] amen pick up your pen amen and write and
[1:02:58] as he picked up his pen and begin to
[1:03:00] write what did he begin to write about
[1:03:02] he begin to write about a bride amen who
[1:03:05] would have the potentials of God and as
[1:03:08] she neared The Headstone amen she would
[1:03:10] be so much in His image amen that the
[1:03:13] same works the head did amen the body
[1:03:16] would do see they were writing amen
[1:03:18] prophecy amen of coming of the Messiah
[1:03:21] now in St John 5 and: 46 Jesus said amen
[1:03:25] for had you believe Moses amen you would
[1:03:27] have believ me he said now see for he
[1:03:29] wrote of me look at this word wrote amen
[1:03:32] it means to describe it means to write
[1:03:34] with reference to the form of the
[1:03:36] letters amen it means to Amen to put on
[1:03:38] paper or some other material it means to
[1:03:41] commit to writing things amen not to be
[1:03:43] forgotten it means to write down to
[1:03:46] record amen it is used to those things
[1:03:48] which stand amen written in the sacred
[1:03:50] books of the Old Testament so Jesus
[1:03:53] looks at him and he says now listen if
[1:03:55] you had believe Moses amen then you
[1:03:57] would believe me amen because he wrote
[1:03:59] Of Me In verse 47 he said but if you
[1:04:02] believe not his writings amen then how
[1:04:05] shall you believe my words amen so there
[1:04:08] was not something could happen amen
[1:04:10] different from what Moses wrote see they
[1:04:13] were trying to say well we believe Moses
[1:04:15] amen but you're different but if they
[1:04:17] really studied it amen they would see
[1:04:19] that what Moses wrote Amen in symbol

[1:19:18] gospel preacher of Christianity I have
[1:19:20] no doubt at all in my mind not one
[1:19:22] Shadow of Doubt but we POS have the
[1:19:25] sealed truth other religions may be all
[1:19:28] right amen but we have the truth so now

[1:19:55] dead substance The Sun Shines for a seed
[1:19:58] that's gerti to life and this Bible and

[1:20:31] there to come forth by the Sun or by the
[1:20:35] light now brother said it very plain he
[1:20:37] said without light amen nothing can live
[1:20:40] without light think about that without
[1:20:43] light nothing can live now I love
[1:20:45] Matthew 4:16 it said the people which s
[1:20:48] in darkness saw great
[1:20:51] light and to them which sat in the
[1:20:54] region and the shadow of death amen
[1:20:57] light is sprung up can I say to you that
[1:21:00] was more than just a verse that was a
[1:21:03] prophecy from Isaiah 9 and verse two
[1:21:06] where he said the people that walked in
[1:21:07] darkness have seen a great light they
[1:21:10] and I listen they that dwell in the land
[1:21:13] of the shadow of death but upon them oh
[1:21:17] God upon them the light has shined so
[1:21:20] there's a people who's dwelling in the
[1:21:22] land underneath the influence of the
[1:21:25] shadow of death but there's a people in
[1:21:28] the middle of that land who the seed was
[1:21:30] in their soul from before the foundation
[1:21:33] of the world and when the light come it
[1:21:36] went directly to the seed and now
[1:21:38] there's confusion on America but there's
[1:21:41] glory on the bride there's confusion

[1:30:00] Darkness more that they love light now
[1:30:03] John 3:16 for God so L the world that he
[1:30:05] gave his only begotten son that
[1:30:07] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:30:09] perish but have everlasting life for God
[1:30:12] sent not his son in the world to condemn
[1:30:14] the world but that the world through him
[1:30:16] might be saved now he that believeth on
[1:30:19] him is not condemned but he that
[1:30:21] believeth not is condemned already see
[1:30:23] because not beli in the name of the only
[1:30:26] begotten Son of God now watch verse 19
[1:30:29] and this
[1:30:30] is this is the condemnation that light
[1:30:35] is coming to the world and Men loved
[1:30:39] Darkness rather than light see because
[1:30:43] their deeds were evil look at this word
[1:30:45] condemnation it's a separating it's a
[1:30:48] sundering it's a separation it's a trial
[1:30:52] or a contest now see when light comes
[1:30:56] amen light brings Darkness to a trial
[1:30:59] when light comes it brings Darkness to a

[1:31:08] of that side of the of the of the Rope
[1:31:10] have more strength he said well here it
[1:31:12] is but everyone that doeth evil hateth a
[1:31:14] lie neither cometh to the LIE lest his
[1:31:17] deeds should be reproved but he that
[1:31:19] doeth truth cometh to the light that his
[1:31:22] deeds may be made manifest that they are
[1:31:25] wrought in God he said so when the word
[1:31:28] of God Rises all Superstition
[1:31:31] denominational fanaticism things amen is
[1:31:33] spread away and it shows just exactly
[1:31:36] what it is he said see the word of God
[1:31:38] made manifest always somebody say
[1:31:41] always it always separates amen the

[1:31:49] F fascism all these other isms can rise
[1:31:51] superstitions Cults whatever it might be
[1:31:54] might rise but when that King light of
[1:31:56] the Bible raises up all superstitions
[1:31:59] until it's a Vindicated proves his life
[1:32:01] we have no right to argue against that
[1:32:03] because it shuts all other light out
[1:32:07] Jesus said let every man's word be a lie
[1:32:10] and mind me the truth see his word amen
[1:32:12] his word is superior over all over all

[1:32:53] conqueror is here amen then tell me what
[1:32:55] is this evening light he said in the
[1:32:57] evening time that we're now living where
[1:32:58] Christ through his ministers has
[1:33:00] preached the gospel for 2,000 years but
[1:33:02] this is the evening lights he said the

[1:33:13] Resurrection see when they didn't know
[1:33:15] he had raised from the dead although
[1:33:17] they loved him they believed him but
[1:33:19] they didn't know he had raised from the
[1:33:20] dead they argued against him but now
[1:33:22] here it is in the evening time he's
[1:33:24] going to reveal himself amen that he is
[1:33:27] raised from the dead how did he do it
[1:33:29] not by preaching the word he's already
[1:33:31] did that and still they didn't believe
[1:33:33] and 2,000 years of preaching the word
[1:33:35] the church still don't believe but the
[1:33:37] evening light has come the manifestation
[1:33:40] of the resurrection and he taken them in
[1:33:43] he performed a miracle or did a thing
[1:33:45] just like he did before his crucifixion
[1:33:47] they knew it was him and their eyes come
[1:33:50] open he opened the eyes of the true
[1:33:53] believers by the manifestation of his
[1:33:56] resurrection listen amen he walked with
[1:33:58] them for six hours and preached them a
[1:34:01] gospel sermon beginning at Genesis all
[1:34:03] the way to the present day and it still
[1:34:05] did not open their eyes hey but in the
[1:34:08] evening time when they constrained him
[1:34:10] to come in he went into a little room
[1:34:13] and he took the bread and when he took
[1:34:15] the bread he broke the
[1:34:16] bread brother Terry he broke the bread
[1:34:19] and by the breaking of the bread was the
[1:34:21] opening of their eyes brother said what
[1:34:23] is the bread that's being broke today it

[1:34:28] Revelation it is the full revelation of
[1:34:32] the Gospel of Jesus Christ he said see

[1:34:36] ask you this what does the lot come to
[1:34:38] do he said the evening lights are here

[1:35:33] around this is to reveal to bring out if
[1:35:36] you haven't got any eyes then what's the
[1:35:39] use to reveal see there has to be eyes

[1:36:04] when the evening light has come can I
[1:36:06] say this we are reading the word in
[1:36:08] light amen we are reading it in the same
[1:36:11] light it was wrote in are you hearing me
[1:36:14] in other words Exodus 13:21 the Lord
[1:36:16] went before them by day in a pillar of
[1:36:18] cloud to lead them by the way and by
[1:36:21] night in a pillar of fire Amen to give
[1:36:23] them life to go by day and night now
[1:36:25] watch he took not away amen the pillar
[1:36:28] of cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire
[1:36:30] by Night amen from before the people
[1:36:34] listen we have today a pillar of cloud
[1:36:37] which is revelation 101 amen and we have
[1:36:39] a pillar of fire which is Exodus 13
[1:36:43] which is hanging over a prophet's head
[1:36:45] now I'm just going to go ahead and say
[1:36:46] it since I'm this close to it amen
[1:36:47] somebody said the other day said well
[1:36:48] brother Andrew he's just pointing all
[1:36:50] the people to a cloud I thought well you
[1:36:52] know you probably meant that as an
[1:36:53] insult but to me that's a compliment
[1:36:55] amen because I'm not ignorant of what a
[1:36:57] prophet taught a prophet said that's our
[1:36:59] Lord up there amen so if you accuse me a
[1:37:01] pointing somebody to a cloud amen thank
[1:37:04] you brother sister I'm pointing them to
[1:37:06] the present day reality of who Jesus
[1:37:08] Christ is amen our God is not an idol
[1:37:11] because I'm not a dumb Gentile who is
[1:37:14] condemned by idols and condemned by
[1:37:16] Traditions but in that those who sat in
[1:37:19] the regions of the Shadows of death a
[1:37:21] light has come listen we were under the
[1:37:24] shadow of denomination and we couldn't
[1:37:26] believe in the right way of God we was
[1:37:28] under the shadow of denomination and we
[1:37:29] couldn't believe in the right way of
[1:37:31] Divine Healing but brother Terry God who
[1:37:33] is rich in Mercy hey he sent a light
[1:37:36] into the midst of the generation listen
[1:37:38] and we're no longer under
[1:37:40] Shadows that's right somebody say well
[1:37:42] that's a lot well brother B said it is a
[1:37:44] lot he said and God is a
[1:37:47] lot we know that Pillar of Fire see the
[1:37:50] disciples just wrote what they seen him
[1:37:52] do but Moses had the revelation so he
[1:37:54] went down into Egypt for 3 years and
[1:37:55] studied and seen that God of the Old
[1:37:58] Testament was the Jesus of the new see
[1:38:01] what did he get he got the Revelation
[1:38:03] and he come back and said I was not
[1:38:04] disobedient to the heavenly vision think
[1:38:06] of it that same Pillar of Fire that came
[1:38:10] upon those men that wrote the Bible is
[1:38:13] the same Pillar of Fire here today
[1:38:17] interpreting the Bible amen
[1:38:21] GL how we think him for that what a
[1:38:25] comfort what an identification I'm so
[1:38:29] glad to be identified in that I don't
[1:38:31] know what to do I'd rather be identified
[1:38:33] in that than all the Baptist Methodist
[1:38:36] Presbyterian Lutheran and all the rest
[1:38:38] of them see identified in that word with
[1:38:41] the Shak glory and Revelation lays the
[1:38:45] Shak glory and Revelation is in the word
[1:38:48] so the pillar of fire appear invisibly
[1:38:49] Among Us is identifying the messages
[1:38:52] right like he did at Mount SII he said
[1:38:55] notice the same Pillar of Fire that sent
[1:38:57] to Moses to Paul that wrote the Bible is
[1:39:00] now sent to reveal it it's the grace of
[1:39:03] God it's the unchanging God fulfilling
[1:39:06] the promises of Matthew 28 Lord I'm with
[1:39:08] you always fulfill in John 14:12 the
[1:39:11] works I do you do also fulfill in Luke
[1:39:13] 17:30 in the day when the son of man
[1:39:14] will be revealed see Malachi 4 that same
[1:39:17] light has come to what to manifest to
[1:39:21] make known to the people the promises
[1:39:23] that he made for this day hey it's the
[1:39:25] manifested light for the day somebody
[1:39:28] say well why aren't you focusing Amen on
[1:39:30] justification that was the light of
[1:39:32] Luther's day amen why are you not
[1:39:34] focusing on sanctification that was the
[1:39:36] light of Wes's Day come on we might as
[1:39:38] well preach and why are we not going
[1:39:40] back to the restoration of the gifts
[1:39:41] because that was Pentecost day but this
[1:39:44] is brid
[1:39:46] light it's bride day it's bride time
[1:39:50] it's Malachi for revealing time it's
[1:39:52] Luke 1730 revealing time see what it is
[1:39:55] there is that same Pillar of Fire that
[1:39:58] same light among us bringing forth the
[1:40:00] life that when it was in Christ Jesus
[1:40:02] doing the same thing in the bride church
[1:40:05] today
[1:40:07] amen so the same thing the light did in
[1:40:11] him is doing in her he said now see will
[1:40:15] you believe it amen will you receive it
[1:40:20] will you acknowledge it will you accept
[1:40:22] it will you judge it as being from God
[1:40:25] listen because this light is your right
[1:40:28] out of
[1:40:30] here come on Church lot coming to you is
[1:40:34] an Evidence it's time to go home
[1:40:36] remember thir The Statue liberty he said
[1:40:38] them most sparrows laying out there he
[1:40:40] said I asked the GU I said why why are
[1:40:42] they laying here dead he said well sir
[1:40:44] the light was on the Statue of Liberty
[1:40:46] and then little old birds they got
[1:40:47] caught out there in the storm and
[1:40:50] darkness and instead of trying to use
[1:40:52] the light to fly to safety they flew
[1:40:55] against it trying to beat it out now the
[1:40:58] very same light that caused them to Die
[1:41:02] My could cause them to live if they
[1:41:06] would have used it
[1:41:07] right now don't get mad at me but it is
[1:41:12] equivalent to me of a bird using the
[1:41:14] light to fly
[1:41:15] to I'm going get in trouble but what's
[1:41:17] new okay it's equivalent to me that
[1:41:21] somebody say well you know I think we
[1:41:23] ought to take time and study brother
[1:41:24] bram's just a man and prove that well
[1:41:26] we're not
[1:41:28] ignorant we're not ignorant we know he
[1:41:31] was a man so what happens is is guys
[1:41:33] gets to studying on trying to make sure
[1:41:35] everybody knows brother R's a man and
[1:41:37] rather than using the light to ride
[1:41:39] themselves into a Revival they used the
[1:41:41] lot to prove that brother Brandon was a
[1:41:43] man and he made mistakes and he was
[1:41:45] human and he told liot amen but listen
[1:41:47] what a prophet said he said they were
[1:41:49] laying there because their brains just
[1:41:50] beat out trying to beat the light out
[1:41:53] accept the light and say thank you and
[1:41:55] let it leave them they tried to beat it
[1:41:57] out they should have just said thank you
[1:41:59] for what a prophet said and believed it
[1:42:02] and walked in it but they spent years
[1:42:04] trying to prove that it was a man that
[1:42:05] was saying what was being said let me
[1:42:07] say it as plain as I know how I am not
[1:42:10] an ignorant person I know brother
[1:42:12] Brandon was a human but you're looking
[1:42:13] at one preacher that will never lay down
[1:42:15] the sword and say this message is not an
[1:42:18] absolute it's not a perfect and oh God
[1:42:22] it's an ultimate to the Salvation it's
[1:42:25] primarily an ultimate it's above
[1:42:26] feelings it's above Traditions it's
[1:42:29] above educated guesses it's above
[1:42:31] reformers it's above preachers it's
[1:42:34] above commentators it's above everything
[1:42:37] it's the light of the Gentiles that has
[1:42:39] come to carry us out of the land of
[1:42:42] death yes sir infidels will rise Creeds
[1:42:45] will rise people say the Bible's not
[1:42:46] right he said oh God don't let me beat
[1:42:48] against your
[1:42:50] light let me accept it in my heart
[1:42:53] heart and say it's right
[1:42:56] Lord that's right I'll walk in the light
[1:43:03] he said now listen them Birds could have
[1:43:04] taken that light and searched it right
[1:43:06] around as it was moving up there and
[1:43:08] went right on nice and Cove under some
[1:43:10] houses somewhere in a shelter and had
[1:43:13] been protected from the storm now watch
[1:43:15] that light was coming to them to protect
[1:43:17] them from a storm brother turns and says
[1:43:20] in the great storm of formality
[1:43:23] come on Church the great storm of
[1:43:25] indifference and a great storm of denial
[1:43:28] of God three storms he says are coming
[1:43:30] in the end time a great storm of
[1:43:33] formality okay so what happens is people
[1:43:36] get a little reserved and they they lay
[1:43:38] off for the moving of God they lay off
[1:43:39] the spirit of God and so what people
[1:43:41] start doing is they start fighting the
[1:43:43] light by saying well you a bunch of dead
[1:43:44] churches and and then you need to move
[1:43:46] of God you need the amen no just preach
[1:43:48] the message he said see because God
[1:43:51] don't let me try to beat the light out
[1:43:52] let use it to walk in it see I believe
[1:43:55] it Lord there you are amen walk in the
[1:43:57] light as I see it in the scripture
[1:44:00] that's light it's God's word so let me
[1:44:02] walk in it Lord let me walk in it never
[1:44:05] never try to deny
[1:44:08] it that's right now let me say this
[1:44:11] before you can walk in the light you got
[1:44:13] to step in the light and brother said in
[1:44:15] the light of that angel of God stand
[1:44:17] there on the mountain that day
[1:44:18] everything that Moses once had or
[1:44:20] thought he never would happen it come to
[1:44:23] be a reality he said I think if men and
[1:44:26] women today would ever step in the light
[1:44:27] of the Holy Spirit under the unction of
[1:44:29] God's spirit and the light of God's word
[1:44:31] everything that God has promised will
[1:44:34] illuminate to you and will be real Again
[1:44:37] Church of the Living God when the reason
[1:44:39] Moses fell in the first place here's
[1:44:41] what was the matter it was the lack of
[1:44:43] having what the burning bush had that's
[1:44:46] right and what our failure today is amen
[1:44:48] is lack having what the Holy Spirit has
[1:44:51] the Holy Spirit has all good things for
[1:44:52] us if we receive the Holy Spirit then
[1:44:54] all things are possible not only
[1:44:56] possible but promised to us Jesus said
[1:44:59] ask the father anything in my name I'll
[1:45:01] do it if he abide in me in my words and
[1:45:03] you ask what you will it'll be given to
[1:45:05] you see when we step into the light of
[1:45:07] God's word with the unction of the Holy
[1:45:09] Spirit to shine the light on it brother
[1:45:12] The Impossible becomes little things
[1:45:14] then oh church amen Moses under
[1:45:18] education seen no way to go to Egypt and
[1:45:21] deliver God's children but once step in
[1:45:23] the burning bush and everything he ever
[1:45:26] thought he would be it become a reality
[1:45:28] to him again come on some of y'all amen
[1:45:30] have let the devil bury what God said
[1:45:32] you could be you've let him bury the
[1:45:34] fact you can be an overcomer you've let
[1:45:36] him bury the fact you can live so close
[1:45:38] to God till the devil don't know what to
[1:45:40] do with you but I say tonight unto you
[1:45:42] that sit under the shadows of the
[1:45:45] condemnation of the devil I say arise
[1:45:47] and shine thy light has come it's a
[1:45:51] glorious light it's a power ful life
[1:45:53] it's a messiah life and if you'll step
[1:45:55] out of that Creed light and step out of
[1:45:58] that shadow of death and step over
[1:46:00] underneath the spout where the Shak
[1:46:02] glory and the Revelation comes out every
[1:46:05] promise of God will become as real to
[1:46:07] you as it did to brother
[1:46:10] brandom yes sir One Step In The Light
[1:46:13] God's word see then when God's word is
[1:46:15] Promised becomes enlightened by the
[1:46:16] presence of the Angel of the Lord Stop
[1:46:21] Moses now
[1:46:24] and I say this to you once you stepped
[1:46:27] in the light put your walking shoes on
[1:46:31] and just walk on in the light Bible says
[1:46:34] if 1 John 1:7 if we walk in the light if
[1:46:38] we walk in the light if we sit in the
[1:46:42] light if we talk about the light on if
[1:46:45] we scrutinize the light if we put the
[1:46:49] light on trial if we walk in light
[1:46:55] as he is in the light we have Fellowship
[1:46:59] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:47:02] Christ his son cleanseth
[1:47:05] us from all sin look at this word walk
[1:47:10] it means to make one's
[1:47:13] way it means to progress I love this one
[1:47:17] to make due use of opportunities
[1:47:23] so if we progress in the light as he is
[1:47:27] in the light then we make use of the
[1:47:30] opportunities that are given by the life
[1:47:32] look at this word opportunity it is a
[1:47:34] set of circumstances that makes it
[1:47:36] possible to do something it is a chance

[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:33] light sister Jane said
[1:58:36] today when's the last time you sit down
[1:58:38] in darkness y'all know what I'm talking
[1:58:40] about Darkness gets around you and
[1:58:42] pressures get around you in all kinds of
[1:58:44] situations you just sit down and flip a
[1:58:46] light on just to I don't think I've I've
[1:58:49] I had to been home to speak to you since
[1:58:52] I was out in California a few months ago
[1:58:54] was out there preaching some meetings
[1:58:56] and on on one of those days I think it
[1:58:57] was Monday brother amamos we went down
[1:58:59] to the four square uh gospel a
[1:59:02] Pentecostal Four Square movement there
[1:59:04] we went down there and toured Amy simple
[1:59:05] mcferson uh her whole uh compound or I
[1:59:09] shouldn't use that word I'm sorry that's
[1:59:10] on the internet uh building Church she
[1:59:13] built we went down there and toured it
[1:59:15] and brother brother Terry is probably
[1:59:17] one of the highlights of my life is I
[1:59:19] stood in the Los Angeles Temple and
[1:59:21] there a guy and you you look at it today
[1:59:23] and how far it's gone I mean I mean just
[1:59:25] homosexuality perversion I mean just
[1:59:27] just just filth invaded that invaded
[1:59:29] that whole
[1:59:31] area but I stood there in in the ansas
[1:59:34] temple and I just put on my earbud and I
[1:59:37] turned on looking at the Unseen and I
[1:59:40] heard brother bradam and he said this he
[1:59:41] said it's me I'm the Lord come down it's
[1:59:45] not brother brandom he has nothing to do
[1:59:47] with this I'm using his
[1:59:50] voice he so surrendered himself to me
[1:59:53] it's me it's the Lord will you come down
[1:59:55] go listen to it when you get home look
[1:59:56] at the scene 59 listen friends I'm
[1:59:59] standing in the exact place that a
[2:00:01] prophet
[2:00:02] stood and the Lord and I'm standing
[2:00:04] there and brother Sean I'm looking
[2:00:06] around and I see these balconies they're
[2:00:08] all big and it's all up there and in my
[2:00:10] head I'm saying nearly 50 60 years ago a
[2:00:13] prophet stood right here right lck come
[2:00:16] right in this building listen and it
[2:00:18] pushed against the darkness do you know
[2:00:20] what this message is it's a message of
[2:00:23] Resurrection wherever you put this
[2:00:25] message if there's a seed there it'll
[2:00:28] raise it up I got to looking and doing
[2:00:30] some research on why brother Bill they
[2:00:32] even brought brother brandom to the
[2:00:33] Angeles Temple I thought he went there
[2:00:35] under Amy simple McPherson's invitation
[2:00:37] she was dead and gone when brother
[2:00:38] Brandon went there he went there under
[2:00:40] her son Ral McPherson's invitation and
[2:00:42] you know what he said I I read some
[2:00:44] history on it they said our last hope to
[2:00:46] bring the healing Revival back was to
[2:00:47] invite William brandham I thought my
[2:00:50] goodness
[2:00:53] and some revived they went a little bit
[2:00:55] further with a Revival of healing but
[2:00:56] there was a
[2:00:57] bride who didn't just want the first
[2:00:59] sign of the second pool she wanted the
[2:01:01] third pool she wanted the bread she
[2:01:04] wanted her eyes to come open she wanted
[2:01:06] to see more than just the gift or more

[2:07:43] amen did you enjoy that this
[2:07:46] evening amen thank God for the
[2:07:50] light and to walk in that light amen the
[2:07:55] light of this age not a glare but the
[2:07:59] light
[2:08:00] amen and um you know I was thinking of
[2:08:05] um thing that was sent
[2:08:09] um it was saying that they had
[2:08:12] discovered 2,000 year old seeds in
[2:08:17] 1963 inside an ancient jar in Israel
[2:08:22] and they were planted in
[2:08:24] 205 and a tree that had been extinct for
[2:08:27] over 1,800 years
[2:08:30] sprouted hallu and you know I I thought
[2:08:33] of that if that natural seed all it
[2:08:36] needed was light because it's under that
[2:08:39] law that of God let every seed bring
[2:08:42] forth of its own kind it just had to
[2:08:44] fall right under that that
[2:08:47] atmosphere and no matter how long it
[2:08:50] took but once it got in that right
[2:08:53] atmosphere under that light amen it it
[2:08:55] it sprung forward and I thought you know
[2:08:58] our names have been written in the
[2:09:00] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:09:02] foundation of the world and but yet it
[2:09:05] was just waiting for the right light to
[2:09:08] come and and I'm so glad that that light
[2:09:11] has come it's brought a quickening power
[2:09:15] amen and here we are today aren't you
[2:09:18] glad for that and I thought of that
[2:09:20] brother brandom said there's a true
[2:09:22] church there's a church that's waiting
[2:09:24] for the coming of the Lord God always
[2:09:27] grant grant it but just those who are
[2:09:31] ordained you say what good will it do to
[2:09:34] stand if it's this kind of a system well
[2:09:38] there's a predestinated seed and when
[2:09:41] that light
[2:09:43] strikes they'll catch it like that
[2:09:46] she'll Bloom they'll Bloom right now
[2:09:49] sure others will just go right over the
[2:09:52] top of it they believe in their system
[2:09:54] and that's just the way it's always like
[2:09:57] it was in the days of Noah they believe
[2:09:59] the same thing those who were
[2:10:02] predestinated to eternal life they got
[2:10:04] it and no man can come to me said Jesus
[2:10:07] except my father draws him and all that
[2:10:11] the father hath given me see we just got
[2:10:14] to scatter the seed throw the light and
[2:10:17] each one of you ought to be a lighthouse
[2:10:19] can you say Amen you love love the Lord
[2:10:22] isn't he wonderful amen so may we just
[2:10:25] keep walking in the light don't let
[2:10:28] Darkness consume you don't let the
[2:10:30] darkness of this world and don't get
[2:10:32] wrapped up in politics I implore you
[2:10:35] don't don't don't get wrapped up in
[2:10:37] politics you say well that's my American
[2:10:39] right but what about your Christian
[2:10:40] right don't get wrapped up in that
[2:10:43] that's all Darkness they cannot bring
[2:10:45] light to you they can't get get you out
[2:10:47] of anything walk in the light as he is
[2:10:50] in the light we're going home church and
