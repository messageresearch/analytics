[36:22] Lord, my battle scars are many.
[36:26] My medals must be few. For in the midst
[36:30] of conflicts raging
[36:33] so often I've failed you.
[36:37] But somehow you've kept me standing. You
[36:40] pick me up each time I'd fall.
[36:44] You don't cast out wounded soldiers.
[36:48] You just love them through it all.
[36:54] And one day all the soldiers will come
[36:58] home.
[37:00] We'll cease fighting for the battle will
[37:04] be won.
[37:08] And as the captain says, "Well done. You
[37:11] fought the fight. The race is run.
[37:16] Wounded soldier.
[37:20] The war is over. Never welcome a home.
[37:31] In my heart I am a victor.
[37:34] Many times the flesh is weak.
[37:38] So often I have begged your grace lest I
[37:42] go down in defeat.
[37:45] But Lord, I recall that battle that was
[37:49] fought by you alone.
[37:52] As your blood flowed from that rugged
[37:55] cross, our victory was won.
[38:01] And one day all the soldiers will come
[38:05] home.
[38:08] They'll cease fighting for the battle
[38:11] will be won.
[38:15] And as the captain says, "Well done. You
[38:18] fought the fight. The race is run,
[38:24] wounded soldier.
[38:27] The war is over.
[38:30] Welcome
[38:31] home.
[38:34] In my heart I am a victor. Though many
[38:38] times this flesh is weak,
[38:42] so often I have begged your grace, lest
[38:45] I go down in defeat.
[38:49] But then I recall that battle that was
[38:53] fought by you alone.
[38:56] As your blood ran from that rugging
[38:58] cross, my victory
[39:01] was won.
[39:04] And one day all the soldiers will come
[39:08] home.
[39:10] Oh, they'll cease fighting for the
[39:14] battle will be won.
[39:18] And as the captain says, "Well done. You
[39:21] fought the fight. The race is run.
[39:26] Wounded soldier.

[39:33] Welcome
[39:34] home.

[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I
[45:38] love him.
[45:41] Yes, I
[45:44] love him.
[45:47] Because
[45:49] he first
[45:52] loved me
[45:54] [Music]
[45:58] and purchase
[46:01] my
[46:03] salvation
[46:06] [Music]
[46:08] on Calary
[46:13] [Music]
[46:16] Sing it again.
[46:18] Oh, I
[46:22] love him.
[46:25] I
[46:27] love him. Do you love him?
[46:31] Oh yes. me first.
[46:35] Love me
[46:40] and purchase
[46:43] my
[46:45] salvation
[46:50] on Calary
[46:56] tree.
[46:59] [Music]
[47:01] Amen.
[47:03] Praise the Lord. If you have your
[47:05] Bibles,
[47:06] we'll just go right on into the word.
[47:10] Isaiah the 43rd chapter. We read these
[47:14] um scriptures a couple weeks ago, I
[47:17] guess. And going to read it again. Um
[47:22] and uh the musicians can be dismissed.
[47:25] Amen. And then um wanted to say brother
[47:28] Andrew Glover will be with us uh next
[47:31] Sunday and ministering for us. So we're
[47:34] looking forward to that.
[47:37] And um also many of you might have heard
[47:40] uh Ann and Branson having a baby and um
[47:45] might have seen a little change in Ann
[47:47] and um not that she's getting grumpy or
[47:50] anything like she said, you know, the uh
[47:55] but uh she's having a they're both
[47:57] having a boy and um so she's having it
[48:01] and he's happy for it. Amen. And uh but
[48:06] we're uh uh glad for them. And um um
[48:11] it's hard to believe my little girl is
[48:14] um well, it's hard to believe she's
[48:15] married and it's really hard to believe
[48:18] she's having a baby, but uh we're we're
[48:21] excited about it. And I guess that'll
[48:23] make um uh our sixth grandchild and uh
[48:28] brother Kevin and Sister Melissa's
[48:30] first. And so we congratulate them. And
[48:33] I know they're excited, that's for sure.
[48:36] And uh we really happy for uh Branson
[48:40] and Anne and pray the Lord just blesses
[48:43] them dearly. Amen. But uh so Isaiah the
[48:49] um
[48:51] 43rd chapter and we're going to start at
[48:53] the first verse.
[48:56] But now thus said the Lord that created
[48:59] thee, oh Jacob,
[49:01] and he that formed thee, O Israel, fear
[49:04] not, for I have redeemed thee. I have
[49:06] called thee by thy name. Thou art mine.
[49:10] When thou passest through the waters, I
[49:13] will be with thee. And through the
[49:15] rivers,
[49:17] uh, they shall not overflow thee. When
[49:21] thou walkest through the fire, thou
[49:23] shalt not be burned, neither shall the
[49:26] flame kindle upon thee. For I am the
[49:29] Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel,
[49:31] thy Savior. I gave Egypt for thy ransom,
[49:35] Ethiopia and Sabba uh for thee. Uh since
[49:40] thou was precious in my sight, thou hast
[49:42] been honorable, and I have loved thee.
[49:46] Therefore will I give men for thee, and
[49:49] people for thy life. Fear not, for I am
[49:52] with thee. I will bring thy seed from
[49:55] the east, and gather thee from the west.
[49:58] I will say to the north, give up, and to
[50:01] the south, keep not back. Bring my sons
[50:04] from afar, or from far, and my daughters
[50:08] from the ends of the earth. Even
[50:10] everyone that is called by my name. For
[50:12] I have created him for my glory. I have
[50:16] formed him. Yay, I have made him. Then
[50:21] the 21st verse, this people have I
[50:25] formed myself.
[50:27] They shall show forth my praise. Amen.
[50:32] Then if you'll go uh uh the book over,
[50:35] next book over, Jeremiah
[50:39] uh 31.
[50:43] Jeremiah chapter 31
[50:46] and we'll start at the first verse.
[50:49] At the same time, sayeth the Lord, will
[50:51] I be the God of all the families of
[50:54] Israel, and they shall be my people.
[50:58] Thus sayeth the Lord, the people which
[51:00] were left of the sword found grace in
[51:03] the wilderness, even Israel, when I went
[51:06] to cause him to rest. The Lord hath
[51:10] appeared of old unto me, saying, "Yeah,
[51:14] yeah, I have loved thee with an
[51:16] everlasting love. Therefore, with loving
[51:20] kindness have I drawn thee." Amen. Let's
[51:25] just bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[51:27] Father,
[51:29] we're just truly grateful for your words
[51:33] of life,
[51:35] Father, that we can find comfort,
[51:39] Lord, in our
[51:42] times of here on earth as we live and we
[51:46] face many things
[51:49] of the enemy. But Lord, thy word, thy
[51:53] promise is a comfort to us. And Father,
[51:58] I pray Lord that you would just bless
[52:01] the reading of your word, the
[52:03] ministering of your word, as well as the
[52:06] hearing. Father, may the anointing of
[52:09] your spirit just fall upon us, Lord, and
[52:12] help me to yield myself to you is our
[52:15] prayer. I pray you'd forgive us of our
[52:18] sins and our shortcomings.
[52:21] And Father, may we learn more of how to
[52:27] better conduct ourselves and handle
[52:30] ourselves in this mortal life. Father,
[52:34] for the world sees us and they look and
[52:38] as your prophet said, we're the only
[52:40] Bible that many will ever read. Lord,
[52:43] may we be the right interpretation of
[52:46] it. We ask in Jesus Christ's name. And
[52:50] the church says,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. You can have your
[52:54] seats this morning.
[52:58] Um,
[52:59] so I I'm going to use the title again,
[53:02] holiness, a people separated unto the
[53:06] Lord. And um, we preach the doctrine of
[53:11] holiness. uh because we believe in it
[53:15] &gt;&gt; and we don't preach on it a lot. uh uh
[53:20] well and because I I believe that we
[53:24] we've
[53:26] have gone further as far as in in
[53:30] knowledge of the word revelation but uh
[53:35] to where we know that what is required
[53:37] of us like Paul would say leaving the uh
[53:42] the principles of the doctrine let us go
[53:45] on to perfection not laying again the uh
[53:49] the the the the works of repentance and
[53:52] and these things, but sometimes it's
[53:54] good to go back and look at these
[53:57] things, especially for young people and
[54:00] and and uh things. And so, um, the Lord
[54:05] willing, want to just take some time,
[54:08] um, the next few services, uh, as far as
[54:12] Sundays that I do preach, um, and and
[54:15] deal with this subject of of holiness.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Uh, we we believe in it and, um, we
[54:23] believe that, uh, holiness is a must. It
[54:27] it's it's it's certainly a a must. Um uh
[54:31] for the Bible says that no man can see
[54:34] God without it. So we've got to have
[54:37] holiness. And um um
[54:41] uh Paul would tell us in Ephesians, God
[54:44] chose us in Christ
[54:46] uh that we should be holy uh and without
[54:50] blame before him in love. So um uh
[54:54] Christianity has holiness in it.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Um uh the Bible also tells us that we
[55:01] are to follow peace and holiness.
[55:05] Um uh it also there in the book of
[55:09] Psalms I believe it says we are to
[55:11] worship the Lord in the beauty of
[55:14] holiness. So holiness has beauty to it
[55:18] and uh uh it's clean and and pure. Uh
[55:23] it's it's definitely not the beauty that
[55:27] that the world seeks and the women of
[55:30] the world. They seek beauty in a totally
[55:34] different way than what God would call
[55:37] beauty. But uh beauty that God would
[55:41] look at is in holiness. Holiness has
[55:44] beauty. And so, um, the prophet said,
[55:48] "God doesn't dwell in beauty made by
[55:50] hands, but the beauty of holiness is
[55:54] where God dwells."
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Oadiah 11:17, breaking in, it says,
[56:01] "Upon mount Zion shall be deliverance,
[56:05] and there shall be holiness." Amen. So,
[56:10] so if you're going to see holiness,
[56:12] it'll be with the bride of Christ. Amen.
[56:16] And, uh, there will be deliverance and
[56:18] holiness. Now, you know, u holiness um,
[56:24] uh, looking it up, it's a sacred place
[56:27] or thing. Holiness again is a sacred
[56:30] place or thing,
[56:33] consecrated,
[56:35] dedicated,
[56:37] hallowed. So the the uh the word
[56:42] consecrate means to make or declare
[56:46] sacred
[56:48] to set apart.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; So this is what the beginning of
[56:53] holiness would be is set apart,
[56:56] consecrated
[56:58] uh declared sacred.
[57:01] uh the word dedicate
[57:04] uh uh looking up these three words cuz
[57:06] holiness is a sacred place or thing.
[57:09] Consecrated, dedicated, hallowed. Uh but
[57:12] the word dedicate is to again set apart
[57:16] for a definite use
[57:19] &gt;&gt; to devote to the worship of a divine
[57:23] being. Amen. So, so um dedicated. It's
[57:28] not to be used for nothing else, but for
[57:31] its intended purpose. I I mentioned that
[57:34] last uh week is, you know, when you're
[57:37] wiring a house, we would uh uh there's
[57:40] some some circuits that are dedicated
[57:44] circuits.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; You you can't mix it and have lights on
[57:48] it or or uh uh recepts on it. You can't
[57:52] it can't be used uh refrigerator has got
[57:55] to be a dedicated circuit. uh a stove
[57:58] has got to be a dedicated circuit. In
[58:01] other words, it's just for that and
[58:04] that's it. And uh um and so uh when when
[58:09] we're thinking of holiness, it's not
[58:12] mixed up. It's it's dedicated for one
[58:16] specific thing. Ain't that right? And so
[58:19] uh also the word sacred again, it means
[58:23] to set apart. All three of these
[58:25] consecrate, dedicate, sacred is has that
[58:28] to set apart. To set apart, not not
[58:31] blending in, not mixed in, but taken out
[58:34] from and set apart. It means holy. So,
[58:39] uh um uh uh devote, dedicate,
[58:43] consecrate, hallow. It means to set
[58:46] apart for a special and often higher
[58:50] end. Amen. So it's it's not left in
[58:54] something that is degraded or something
[58:57] that is just common things but is taken
[59:01] out to be set apart for something
[59:03] greater than what it was in. Amen. So uh
[59:08] if if there is to be holiness then there
[59:12] has to be a separation. Can't have
[59:15] holiness and not separation.
[59:18] uh uh and separation has always as we
[59:21] know it's always been God's way. In the
[59:25] beginning of creation, he separated
[59:27] light from darkness. Ain't that right?
[59:30] Uh uh so God from the very get-go, he
[59:33] had to separate. And brother Ram said
[59:36] the reason why he had to separate is the
[59:38] the darkness from light is so that the
[59:41] light could shine upon the seed and
[59:44] bring a bring the seed uh to what it is
[59:47] was supposed to be. So there had to be a
[59:51] separation to make room for the seed to
[59:54] grow. Ain't that right? So then we find
[59:57] that even though Abel and Cain they were
[1:00:01] twins, they were both worshippers of
[1:00:04] God. Uh there was no other god at that
[1:00:08] time that man had made. Uh so they both
[1:00:11] believed in the same God. Uh uh they
[1:00:14] worshiped and and built an altar and all
[1:00:18] of these things and and and all that and
[1:00:21] and and a sacrifice unto God, but God
[1:00:23] separated their worship. God separated
[1:00:27] their sacrifice. God separated this.
[1:00:29] Amen. By giving Abel a revelation of
[1:00:33] what sacrifice would be accepted. Amen.
[1:00:37] Uh uh and so their their sacrifice was
[1:00:41] different, their worship was different
[1:00:44] and one was accepted, one was rejected
[1:00:47] because the revelation made the
[1:00:50] difference. Revelation separated it.
[1:00:54] Amen. And so uh when God first came to
[1:00:57] Abraham, he commanded him to separate
[1:01:00] himself. And the prophet said, "See, God
[1:01:04] called for total separation. Separate
[1:01:07] yourself from your kinsmen. Separate
[1:01:09] from your father's house. Separate from
[1:01:12] all your associates. Completely
[1:01:15] annihilate yourself from all these
[1:01:18] things and walk with me." Ain't that
[1:01:21] right? So God is bringing holiness uh to
[1:01:25] Abraham by separating him, amen, from
[1:01:28] everything that he has known, amen,
[1:01:31] because God wanted him to walk with him.
[1:01:35] Ain't that right? Abraham was to walk
[1:01:38] with God. And in order to do that, God
[1:01:41] required a separation. And and brother
[1:01:44] Brandham says, "What a privilege it is
[1:01:46] when a man is being called like that."
[1:01:50] Amen. So, we're not The word holiness is
[1:01:54] is dear to us because it's it's a
[1:01:58] separation to walk with God. Amen.
[1:02:02] Without holiness, you ain't going to
[1:02:04] walk with God. Without holiness, you
[1:02:06] will not see God. Ain't that right? See,
[1:02:09] so we we find amen that God wouldn't
[1:02:12] bless Abraham fully until he um made a
[1:02:17] complete separation. Amen. We also read
[1:02:21] where God separated Israel uh the people
[1:02:24] that we had just read about in our
[1:02:26] opening scripture which I believe that
[1:02:28] that uh as the prophet taught us
[1:02:30] scripture is a two-fold. So I believe
[1:02:33] that he was not just talking to a
[1:02:35] natural people but he's talking to a
[1:02:36] spiritual people but here is the natural
[1:02:39] people. God separated them from Egypt
[1:02:43] and the way that he separated them was
[1:02:46] by requiring a token of them. Amen. and
[1:02:50] said, "When I see the blood, I will pass
[1:02:53] over you." Ain't that right? So, there
[1:02:56] had to be a separation. And that was by
[1:02:59] the blood of the lamb. That was by a
[1:03:02] token. Amen. So, God also commanded the
[1:03:06] children of Israel to separate
[1:03:08] themselves from all the heathen nations.
[1:03:12] Amen. They were to live separate. They
[1:03:14] they separate lives, separate ways. uh
[1:03:18] uh they were not to partake in in their
[1:03:21] heathen practices. They were not to uh
[1:03:24] uh partake in their worship of other
[1:03:27] gods. They they were not to um uh even
[1:03:32] their diet was to be different. Amen.
[1:03:35] Why? Because they were a holy people.
[1:03:38] God called them to be a holy people to
[1:03:42] be separated for a dedicated purpose.
[1:03:46] Amen. They were to be dedicated unto the
[1:03:48] Lord, consecrated unto God. Amen. As
[1:03:52] we've talked about the vessels of the
[1:03:53] the temple and and uh uh the high priest
[1:03:57] and everything involving in the temple,
[1:04:00] God would would make uh uh consecrate
[1:04:04] they it would be uh uh consecrated for
[1:04:07] that specific purpose and that alone.
[1:04:10] Amen. And so uh uh therefore even their
[1:04:14] diet as I said and we see this when
[1:04:16] Israel was taken into captivity uh the
[1:04:19] king like Daniel and Nebuchadnezzar and
[1:04:22] and uh they they were going to be tested
[1:04:24] just like a lot of others uh uh but but
[1:04:28] he wanted them to eat their his his
[1:04:32] diet, his way, his food and and Daniel
[1:04:36] and and said no, we can't do that. um uh
[1:04:40] let us eat the way we're supposed to be
[1:04:42] eating and then uh try us and and and
[1:04:45] for a few days and see if there ain't a
[1:04:47] difference. Right? And there was a
[1:04:49] difference. Amen. There was a difference
[1:04:51] in the way they ate. And so uh they kept
[1:04:54] themselves separated and undefiled even
[1:04:57] though they were in captivity. Even
[1:04:59] though they they lived in the palace and
[1:05:03] uh uh uh were were under the king and
[1:05:06] serving the king, they kept themselves
[1:05:09] holy, dedicated, undefiled, consecrated.
[1:05:13] They had to kept themselves separated.
[1:05:16] Ain't that right? Well, God has called
[1:05:18] us to be separated as we've read the
[1:05:21] scripture 2 Corinthians 6:17.
[1:05:24] Wherefore, come out from among them.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. come out from among them. Have you
[1:05:30] young people, have you wondered why
[1:05:32] you're so different and why this message
[1:05:35] is so different? Why people don't
[1:05:36] understand you and they call you a cult?
[1:05:39] And it's it's good that they would think
[1:05:42] us strange. Amen. It's a sign that we've
[1:05:45] come out. We're we're not mingling.
[1:05:47] We're not that they don't see us as one
[1:05:50] of them. We're not trying to be
[1:05:52] different. I think if anything, they see
[1:05:55] more of God. They see something in you
[1:05:58] that they don't see in other Christians
[1:06:00] and they don't see in other church
[1:06:03] members of of of different denominations
[1:06:06] or or whatever. Amen. And and and so
[1:06:09] this is what God has called us to do.
[1:06:12] Come out from among them and be
[1:06:15] separate, sayith the Lord. We shouldn't
[1:06:17] be afraid to tell what we believe. We
[1:06:20] shouldn't be afraid. Amen. and and and
[1:06:23] afraid of criticism and to be rejected
[1:06:26] and well if I say you know tell them
[1:06:29] that I believe in a prophet they're
[1:06:30] going to make fun of me. Well, you
[1:06:33] should you you well Paul tells us to
[1:06:35] glory in in persecution when when when
[1:06:39] they criticize you for the way you
[1:06:42] believe and and the life you live and
[1:06:44] and these things. It's not that you're
[1:06:46] trying to be uh stand out like a sore
[1:06:48] thrum. Amen. But you're separated. Amen.
[1:06:52] If they can talk about their ideas and
[1:06:54] they can talk about their ways, why
[1:06:57] can't we talk about our ways? Amen. But
[1:07:00] see, yes, it is strange, but that's fine
[1:07:03] because God, this message makes us
[1:07:06] different. Amen. And it's just true. If
[1:07:09] you're in a message church or you're you
[1:07:12] say you believe in a prophet and you're
[1:07:13] scared to talk about a prophet and and
[1:07:16] you're afraid, well, you've not really
[1:07:18] sold out to this message. A. Amen. It's
[1:07:21] just the truth. Amen. Uh uh but we find
[1:07:25] that it says, "Wherefore come out from
[1:07:27] among them, and be ye separate, sayeth
[1:07:30] the Lord. And touch not touch not the
[1:07:34] unclean thing, and I will receive you
[1:07:37] and will be a father unto you, and you
[1:07:40] shall be my sons and daughters, saith
[1:07:42] the Lord Almighty." Ain't that right?
[1:07:45] So, so uh uh we we talk about adoption.
[1:07:48] We talk about the manifestation of sons
[1:07:50] and and and and and these things, but it
[1:07:53] cannot happen until there's holiness.
[1:07:56] Until there is a separation, until we
[1:07:59] are fully consecrated, dedicated for
[1:08:03] that purpose. Can you say amen? We're
[1:08:06] we're not to be used for the devil. My
[1:08:09] my my body is not for the devil. Amen.
[1:08:12] To give vent to him, to allow him to
[1:08:15] express himself. You understand what I'm
[1:08:17] saying? Amen. And I know he puts
[1:08:19] negative thoughts in our mind to get us
[1:08:21] to talk negative. And you talk negative,
[1:08:23] then you believe negative, then you act
[1:08:25] negative, and then your worship's
[1:08:27] negative, and and then your testimony is
[1:08:29] negative, and then your actions are
[1:08:31] negative. Well, you're just letting the
[1:08:33] devil express himself right through you
[1:08:35] because everything about Christianity is
[1:08:38] positive.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's right. See,
[1:08:42] every promise of God is positive, not
[1:08:45] negative. So then we've got to
[1:08:48] consecrate ourselves, amen, for this
[1:08:50] purpose, that God could work himself
[1:08:53] through us. Uh first Peter uh uh
[1:08:56] 11:15-16
[1:08:58] says, "But as he which hath called you
[1:09:02] is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of
[1:09:08] conversation." Amen.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, in all manner of
[1:09:11] lifestyle, your your life should be
[1:09:14] holy. Our life should be holy here at
[1:09:17] the church. Our life should be holy at
[1:09:19] home. Our life should be holy when we're
[1:09:22] by ourselves. Our our life should be
[1:09:25] holy wherever we are. Amen. It we should
[1:09:29] be holy in everything. When we talk,
[1:09:32] when we when we act, when we think, when
[1:09:34] we uh worship, when we sing, when we uh
[1:09:38] Everything about us should be uh uh our
[1:09:42] word should be consecrated unto God. You
[1:09:45] understand what I'm saying? Surely.
[1:09:47] Amen. Yes. You can't stop things from
[1:09:50] coming into your mind, but you can sure
[1:09:52] stop it from uh uh uh Satan from
[1:09:55] building a nest in your mind and and
[1:09:58] allow dwelling on these thoughts. Yes,
[1:10:00] it's easy to dwell on negativity, but as
[1:10:03] as as Christians, as believers, we
[1:10:06] understand that we are to be holy.
[1:10:10] Therefore, we must cast down all
[1:10:12] reasonings, all imaginations,
[1:10:15] everything. Brother Brand says,
[1:10:16] basically, cast down all unbelief.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, so your behavior
[1:10:23] should be holy. Amen. And and because it
[1:10:26] is written, be ye holy, for I am holy.
[1:10:30] So be set apart, be dedicated, be
[1:10:32] consecrated. See, be set apart to the
[1:10:36] word and that alone. Ain't that right?
[1:10:38] Amen. Don't hear the word. Rejoice of
[1:10:40] the word and say, I believe that word.
[1:10:42] And then when someone else comes in a
[1:10:44] negative, oh, really? Well, now I don't
[1:10:46] know what to do. No. Dedicate yourself
[1:10:49] to that word. I don't care what they
[1:10:51] say. I don't care how good it looks. I
[1:10:53] don't care uh uh what it seems like. I'm
[1:10:55] dedicated to this. I believe this. I'll
[1:10:58] say this. I confess this. Can you say
[1:11:01] amen? Dedicated. God wants the word
[1:11:04] which is his promises to have
[1:11:06] preeminence in us. Do you believe that?
[1:11:10] Brother Ram said when a man has the kind
[1:11:12] of promise given to him like Abraham
[1:11:15] had, he's asked to separate himself from
[1:11:18] unbelievers. How many's got the promise
[1:11:21] that Abraham had? Same kind of promise.
[1:11:24] Amen. Because we're Abraham's seed. So,
[1:11:27] we have been given. Amen. We are a
[1:11:30] people that's been given the same kind
[1:11:32] of promise that Abraham had. Amen. And
[1:11:35] therefore, we're asked to separate
[1:11:38] ourselves from unbelievers.
[1:11:40] That's what makes so many people fail
[1:11:43] with healing. come down and the Lord
[1:11:45] perform a miracle on them and they get
[1:11:48] off among uh the amongst unbelievers
[1:11:51] uh that say, "Well, now you're just
[1:11:53] worked up, dear." You know, uh now you
[1:11:56] know there's nothing to that. Now,
[1:11:58] that's just mental emotion. That's the
[1:12:01] devil. See, and the first thing you
[1:12:03] know, there's the devil coming right
[1:12:05] back. And you say, "Well, maybe I I you
[1:12:09] know, I I don't know." Well, there you
[1:12:10] are. right back in the same condition
[1:12:13] where you were. So, you've got to
[1:12:15] separate yourself. Can you say amen? How
[1:12:18] many believes in the healing power of
[1:12:20] God? How many believes in the salvation
[1:12:22] of God, deliverance of God, everything
[1:12:24] about the word, God's promises are to
[1:12:28] us. Amen. But to remain there, to to
[1:12:32] have them promises effective, Amen. is
[1:12:36] to separate separate yourself, Amen.
[1:12:39] from these things. Don't don't think for
[1:12:41] a minute that you can be a Christian and
[1:12:43] and live for God without there being a
[1:12:46] separation. Amen. God has requires you
[1:12:50] to separate. Amen. See, we're not to be
[1:12:53] like the world. We're not to talk like
[1:12:55] the world. We're not to think like the
[1:12:57] world. We're not to act like the world
[1:12:59] or behave like the world or uh uh have
[1:13:02] the mannerisms of the world. Ain't that
[1:13:05] right? There's a literal separation.
[1:13:09] Amen. When I'm on the job, I'm
[1:13:11] separated. When I'm at school, I'm
[1:13:13] separated. Amen. When I'm among uh uh uh
[1:13:16] the world, at restaurant, at a
[1:13:18] restaurant, or or or grocery store or
[1:13:21] wherever we're at. Amen. Separated. When
[1:13:24] I'm talking to the center, I'm
[1:13:26] separated. Can you say amen? Amen. There
[1:13:28] there's a separation. Now, notice our
[1:13:31] worship is to be different and what we
[1:13:34] feed off of is to be different. God help
[1:13:38] us all. Ain't that right? So, Brother
[1:13:40] Brham says how happy a real Christian is
[1:13:45] to separate himself.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're happy when we're separating
[1:13:50] ourselves. This is this isn't doom and
[1:13:52] gloom. I just don't know. Hey, do I
[1:13:55] really have to do that? Everybody's
[1:13:57] going to make fun of me. Everybody's
[1:13:58] going to look at me different. I'm just
[1:13:59] the oddball at work. I'm just the
[1:14:01] oddball at school. I just don't know.
[1:14:03] I'm even the oddball at church, you
[1:14:05] know. Well, separate yourself. Amen.
[1:14:08] believers are happy. Amen. They consider
[1:14:11] themselves blessed because God has
[1:14:13] required of them to separate themselves
[1:14:17] because he's given them the same promise
[1:14:20] that he gave Abraham.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; The word holiness
[1:14:27] used to have a meaning amongst the
[1:14:29] church.
[1:14:30] Uh and with that there was a life
[1:14:35] portrayed
[1:14:37] u a certain lifestyle that portrayed
[1:14:41] holiness.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; The women didn't wear makeup.
[1:14:46] They didn't wear things that pertained
[1:14:47] to a man. Right.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Didn't put on earrings. Didn't put on
[1:14:52] all kinds of jewelry.
[1:14:55] Um didn't didn't cut their hair. Men
[1:14:58] didn't have long hair.
[1:15:00] didn't smoke, drink, cuss,
[1:15:03] uh person that that smoked and drank and
[1:15:07] cussed, they were just automatically
[1:15:09] considered sinners.
[1:15:12] And because there was a holiness
[1:15:15] about the church.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; That that uh uh you know that uh sinners
[1:15:23] felt looked down upon
[1:15:26] uh a lot of times simply because they
[1:15:28] felt condemned for what they were doing.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Uh but it was a holiness in the church.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Uh holiness had meaning amongst
[1:15:38] Christians.
[1:15:40] They they didn't go to the movie
[1:15:42] theater. They didn't hang out at the
[1:15:45] beach with all the nudity.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; I am so glad my dad kept me from that
[1:15:49] stuff. Dad wouldn't let us go to the
[1:15:52] public uh public pools
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; because of of the nudity. Uh, dad just
[1:15:57] didn't let us hang around places that
[1:16:00] had cigarette smoke and and uh drinking
[1:16:04] and we we just didn't go to the beach
[1:16:07] when everybody was out there and the
[1:16:09] naked ladies and all that. I thank God
[1:16:11] for a dad that believed in holiness.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Uh they didn't hang out with sinners. Uh
[1:16:18] Christians that believed in holiness.
[1:16:20] Christians just didn't hang out with
[1:16:22] sinners and unbelievers. Uh they they
[1:16:25] weren't rude. They they weren't um uh
[1:16:30] they they weren't snobby. They didn't
[1:16:33] have a Now some have you know and they
[1:16:35] still do today have a holier than thou
[1:16:38] attitude when you you know when they
[1:16:40] amongst people but but believers true
[1:16:43] believers just they didn't have that
[1:16:46] attitude but they didn't hang out with
[1:16:47] them because there was a holiness there.
[1:16:51] They they they didn't they didn't have
[1:16:53] the same lifestyles. They they didn't
[1:16:55] have the same type of conversations.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Usually now Christians uh so-called
[1:17:05] Christians hang out with everybody and
[1:17:07] and they'll the the sinners will drink
[1:17:09] and and and they'll talk about their
[1:17:12] rock and roll and they'll talk about
[1:17:14] this and the movies they've watched and
[1:17:15] all that. And the good little old
[1:17:17] Christian just stands real silent, not
[1:17:19] saying a word, just looking around maybe
[1:17:21] just, oh goodness.
[1:17:24] But back then there was a holiness.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Christians actually dominated
[1:17:29] the atmosphere.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; True. That's true.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; They they dominated it because they
[1:17:34] believed in something.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; They didn't condone sin,
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; See, holiness brought about a separation
[1:17:43] there. there was holiness and men and
[1:17:46] women were dedicated and consecrated to
[1:17:49] the Lord
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; throughout the years. Uh the devil has
[1:17:55] made holiness to be about the works of
[1:17:57] man
[1:17:59] and and um where men base destination of
[1:18:04] their soul uh on their works which is
[1:18:08] legalism
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; and we know that to be facts
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; and uh John Wesley is the one that
[1:18:16] brought in uh uh sanctification the
[1:18:18] message of holiness
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; and
[1:18:22] uh they they didn't wear rings, they
[1:18:24] didn't wear necklaces, they didn't, you
[1:18:27] know, I mean, they had strict
[1:18:30] strict rules
[1:18:32] uh uh in what they would consider uh
[1:18:36] holiness to be. Now, uh which brought
[1:18:39] forth uh uh legalism.
[1:18:42] And the word legalism is strict literal
[1:18:46] or excessive conformity to the law or to
[1:18:50] a religious or moral code. See, and so
[1:18:54] it's it's basically the same thing that
[1:18:56] they did under Moses's law.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; The law of Moses, they serve God by
[1:19:00] merit of what they did uh what they did
[1:19:03] or didn't do. And and and so brother
[1:19:07] Bram says, "See, in the world today, uh
[1:19:10] uh where all these ism, this is rises
[1:19:14] up, watch on all the cults, cults of
[1:19:17] nonmeat eating and illegalist that I've
[1:19:21] got to do so and so. And if I don't
[1:19:23] speak with tongues, if I don't do this,
[1:19:25] if I don't shout, if I don't dance, then
[1:19:28] there's something wrong with me." That's
[1:19:30] legalism.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So they serve God by
[1:19:35] merit and and so but but we we
[1:19:38] understand that that uh legalistic
[1:19:41] disposation
[1:19:43] uh uh ended when when Christ who was the
[1:19:48] true real royal seed of Abraham he he
[1:19:52] come to the earth and the prophet said
[1:19:54] he took all the legalism upon himself
[1:19:57] and paid the price of redemption and
[1:20:01] God's church is back in grace again.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; See, so then uh we as the uh uh the true
[1:20:11] seed of Abraham, we're we're under
[1:20:13] grace. Christ put us back under grace
[1:20:17] and not under the law to where I don't
[1:20:20] have to gain God's favor. I don't have
[1:20:23] to try to appease an angry God. His
[1:20:26] anger has already been been appeased
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; through Christ. Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; So the prophet said he taken the law
[1:20:36] upon himself and the law nailed him to
[1:20:40] the cross of what we must do and must
[1:20:43] not do and must do and must not do. So
[1:20:47] our salvation is not everybody say is
[1:20:50] not based on our works.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Our salvation is not based upon our
[1:20:57] works. And that's exactly what Satan
[1:20:59] calls holiness to be as is it it became
[1:21:03] a law. It became a works. It become it
[1:21:07] become trying to sanctify people, get
[1:21:11] people safe and by what they did and
[1:21:14] what they didn't do and and before you
[1:21:17] know it, it's it's like the uh uh the
[1:21:19] strict religions of the Muslims and all
[1:21:22] that long garments and you know and and
[1:21:25] pious and and and uh uh uh you know,
[1:21:29] you've got the uh monks that they they
[1:21:31] they dedicate themselves to to a certain
[1:21:34] religion and and and they stay to
[1:21:37] themselves and they stay, you know, and
[1:21:39] they they penalize themselves and and
[1:21:42] they punish themselves and the nuns
[1:21:45] punish themselves and everybody's
[1:21:47] punishing themselves trying to be
[1:21:49] holier, trying to gain God's freedom, a
[1:21:52] favor and and all of these things. Well,
[1:21:55] that's not what holiness is about.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Hello. Right?
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; So we find that there is nothing that a
[1:22:08] man can do to save himself.
[1:22:11] You're already saved by grace.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "You can't stop eating
[1:22:16] meat. You can't stop doing this or that.
[1:22:19] You cannot stop. Christ saves you and
[1:22:23] that alone."
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? According to the
[1:22:27] Bible, you can't even come to him unless
[1:22:31] he first chooses you to come.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; So God elected and called Abraham before
[1:22:40] he done one good thing.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Before he done anything to gain God's
[1:22:48] favor or what we would call that would
[1:22:51] gain God's favor, if there was anything
[1:22:53] that he could do, he didn't do that. And
[1:22:56] yet he still had God's favor.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; God called him and chose him. Elected
[1:23:02] him. Ain't that right? The prophet said
[1:23:05] God called him and said that through him
[1:23:08] he was going to make him a father of
[1:23:11] nations. No matter what you do, Abraham,
[1:23:14] you don't have to do one thing. I've
[1:23:16] done it.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; So that tells us that the promise is a
[1:23:22] sure thing.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:25] Ain't that right?
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Did God blindly choose Abraham? No.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; No. What if What if God said, "Well, I'm
[1:23:34] going to choose Abraham and give him my
[1:23:36] promise." And then he goes down there
[1:23:38] and tells Abraham to separate himself
[1:23:41] and from his kindred and to leave that
[1:23:44] land that he and everything that he's
[1:23:46] known and go to a a place he's never
[1:23:48] known before, never seen before and all
[1:23:51] that. And then Abraham says, "No, I
[1:23:52] don't think I'm going to do it. I'm
[1:23:54] going to live right here in the land of
[1:23:56] her. If you've got anything to say or do
[1:23:58] for me, uh uh you just got to do it
[1:24:00] here.
[1:24:02] What What if God would have done that?
[1:24:03] What if Abraham would have responded to
[1:24:06] God in that way? Ain't that right? See?
[1:24:09] Amen. Then what what would have God
[1:24:11] done? See what what would God do then?
[1:24:13] If Abraham just bucked and balked and
[1:24:16] says, "I'm not interested. Uh you just
[1:24:19] go do your thing."
[1:24:20] And and uh yeah, cuz I ain't going to
[1:24:23] separate. Well, you see, God would have
[1:24:25] never done such a thing like that. Ain't
[1:24:28] that right? See, God knows all things.
[1:24:30] Everybody say, "God knows all things."
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Acts 15:18, "Known unto God are all his
[1:24:37] works from the beginning of the world."
[1:24:40] Notice Romans 8:29. For whom he did
[1:24:45] forno. Everybody say forno. who he did
[1:24:49] forno. When did he forneew them? Before
[1:24:53] the foundation of the world, he also did
[1:24:56] predestinate.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? In Romans 11 and two,
[1:25:00] Paul speaks of Israel declaring that God
[1:25:03] hath not cast away his people which he
[1:25:07] forneew.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So then he already
[1:25:13] forneew Abraham. He knew all about
[1:25:16] Abraham. very acquainted with the the
[1:25:20] least uh details of Abraham. Amen. And
[1:25:23] the prophet said, "God by election chose
[1:25:26] Abraham for he knew what Abraham would
[1:25:31] do."
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Another place God
[1:25:36] didn't call Abraham because he was a
[1:25:39] good man, but God knew what Abraham
[1:25:43] would do. So this this uh uh uh you know
[1:25:49] we were again raised in Pentecost among
[1:25:52] the apostolics and and um now you know
[1:25:57] no long no no short sleeve men couldn't
[1:25:59] wear short sleeves couldn't wear beards
[1:26:02] mustaches
[1:26:04] you know uh their their sideburns had to
[1:26:06] be a certain length couldn't wear their
[1:26:09] hair in the middle guys couldn't do that
[1:26:12] to wear couldn't wear certain colors
[1:26:14] Um, no, no. Uh, some of them didn't wear
[1:26:18] wedding rings. Uh, um, you know, um, you
[1:26:23] know, then the ladies had to have a a
[1:26:25] certain style of of dress and all this.
[1:26:29] But I remember I remember men and women
[1:26:33] both going around the outside of church
[1:26:37] when no one's looking and they're
[1:26:39] sneaking televisions in and and there
[1:26:43] women are slightly trimming their hair
[1:26:46] just to see what they can get away with.
[1:26:48] Or if they couldn't trim the hair, they
[1:26:51] would burn the hair. They they would do
[1:26:54] whatever it took. And then if they ever
[1:26:56] got caught, well, I didn't cut my hair.
[1:26:58] See, I I I uh you know, and I remember
[1:27:02] even even the girls, you know, when
[1:27:04] they're going out uh uh uh out away from
[1:27:07] home and and doing they're slipping
[1:27:09] pants on and and putting a little makeup
[1:27:13] on when they're away from mom and dad
[1:27:15] and and oh, it was a lot of stuff. What
[1:27:18] did it do? It was a holiness trying to
[1:27:21] keep people together. Amen. It became a
[1:27:25] legalism and yet it done nothing but
[1:27:28] cause people to rebel.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Is that not what the law of Moses done?
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; You Bible readers ought to know what it
[1:27:40] exactly done. It caused rebellion. They
[1:27:43] became rebels.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; They're the one that wanted the law.
[1:27:48] They're the one that says, "Hey, we can
[1:27:49] live it. You just bring it on, puppy.
[1:27:51] We'll we'll live it. I don't care how
[1:27:53] holy it is. I don't care how strict it
[1:27:55] is. We got it together and they became
[1:27:57] rebels.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Because they couldn't live it.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; They couldn't.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. They couldn't live it. See, and so
[1:28:08] God knew, see, that Abraham would would
[1:28:12] would separate from his kindred. God
[1:28:15] knew that Abraham would leave his home.
[1:28:18] God knew, Amen. that he would turn his
[1:28:21] back on idolatry and all of these
[1:28:24] things. Brother Brham said God knew that
[1:28:27] Abraham would raise his children to fear
[1:28:31] the Lord.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; So God wasn't gambling a man upon
[1:28:35] Abraham. He knew Abraham. He knew more
[1:28:40] about Abraham than Abraham knew about
[1:28:42] himself.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:46] God knew that if Abraham had the chance,
[1:28:49] a man, to follow after God, he would.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Oh, there's so
[1:28:58] much of this legalism today. Touch not,
[1:29:01] taste not. You don't do things legally.
[1:29:05] I didn't come to this church tonight
[1:29:07] legally. I feel tired. I've been
[1:29:10] nervous. I'm upset. I'm wondering about
[1:29:13] something that's out before me. My
[1:29:15] heart's burning even as such as much
[1:29:19] till my heart's a fluttering. I got a
[1:29:21] cramp pain right at this minute. Just
[1:29:24] shooting back and forth up and down
[1:29:26] through here. Weak, nervous, trembly.
[1:29:28] Amen. Catch a hold here and squeeze. Got
[1:29:30] my toe squeezed up in my shoes. I felt
[1:29:33] anything but coming down here. Why did I
[1:29:36] come then? Because I love God.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Live or die, I must stand here for him.
[1:29:47] It's not because I have to. He wouldn't
[1:29:49] care about whether I did or not. If I
[1:29:52] die, I'd go to heaven anyhow. But I'm
[1:29:55] coming because I love him.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; You serve God because you love him, not
[1:30:02] because you just got to do it.
[1:30:06] I I think sometimes people focus more on
[1:30:10] things that God's not really concerned
[1:30:12] about.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; And we make it a thing of salvation,
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And you know, men and women or or
[1:30:22] ministers have and and and well, men,
[1:30:25] women, both, they they have injected
[1:30:27] their own ideas of what holiness ought
[1:30:30] to be. And then when they see people not
[1:30:32] living up to their own standards, well,
[1:30:34] they can't be a Christian. They can't be
[1:30:36] this. They're wrong. And and then we
[1:30:39] say, just like what law would do, law
[1:30:42] demands justice.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Now in Colossians 1:9
[1:30:55] through10, Paul says that he says, "We
[1:30:58] do not cease to pray for you
[1:31:02] and to desire that you be filled with
[1:31:05] the knowledge of his will in all wisdom
[1:31:09] and spiritual understanding,
[1:31:12] that you walk that ye might walk worthy
[1:31:16] of the Lord unto all pleasing."
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:20] being fruitful in every good work and
[1:31:24] increasing
[1:31:25] not in my knowledge,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; not in your knowledge,
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; but in the knowledge of God.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Now, first John 3:21,
[1:31:38] beloved, if our
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; heart condemnth not, if our heart
[1:31:42] condemnth not, then we have confidence
[1:31:45] toward God.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; I I think that's important because every
[1:31:53] son and daughter of God
[1:31:55] will have a condemnation in their own
[1:31:58] heart if they're wrong.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; It don't take someone down the street to
[1:32:05] condemn you.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; God will condemn you in your own heart.
[1:32:10] Your own heart condemns you
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; when when you're not living right. and
[1:32:16] and the the the the preacher walks on
[1:32:20] down your avenue
[1:32:23] or you hear the prophet talk about
[1:32:25] something that you're struggling with,
[1:32:28] there's something down inside of you
[1:32:30] that just pricks your soul.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not right.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Most people, they get mad.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:40] when
[1:32:42] uh they get their what we call their
[1:32:46] toes stepped on. Well, he's preaching
[1:32:48] against me. He knows all about me. So, I
[1:32:52] Yeah, I get it. No, maybe it's just God
[1:32:56] trying to talk with you.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; And if there's something there,
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; help us, God.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; We ought to just thank God.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, if you've got a heart
[1:33:05] to serve God, you ought to cherish that.
[1:33:09] Amen.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Every day of your life.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz not everybody has that.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Not everybody's able to hear something
[1:33:20] of God and be pricked in their soul.
[1:33:23] Most people are hearing that they're
[1:33:25] okay.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:32] So if there's something that's pricking
[1:33:34] your heart, then you ought to just
[1:33:36] humble yourself and say, "God, whatever
[1:33:39] it is, I just want to be right."
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; So if our heart condemnth, not though,
[1:33:46] then we have confidence toward God, and
[1:33:51] whatsoever we ask, we receive of him.
[1:33:54] Why? because we keep his commandments
[1:33:57] and do those things that are pleasing in
[1:34:00] his sight.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; God has called us to a life of
[1:34:07] separation and a full obedience.
[1:34:11] And one of these scriptures, and I'm
[1:34:13] going to get more into it uh later, the
[1:34:15] Lord willing, but Deuteronomy 22:5,
[1:34:18] the woman, everybody say the woman,
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; shall not wear
[1:34:24] that which pertainth unto a man.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Neither shall a man, everybody say a
[1:34:30] man,
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; put on a woman's garment.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; For all that do so are abomination unto
[1:34:37] the Lord thy God.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. So, do you do you know,
[1:34:40] young people, it is an abomination. It
[1:34:43] is not just a choice. It's an
[1:34:45] abomination to God.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; When a woman puts on pants,
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; I don't care where church they go to. I
[1:34:52] don't care if they sing in the choir. I
[1:34:54] don't care if they talk about God every
[1:34:57] day of their life.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; If that woman puts on pants, it's an
[1:35:02] abomination to the very God that she
[1:35:05] claims to serve.
[1:35:07] So, don't be disillusioned
[1:35:09] when you seeing all these women up there
[1:35:11] in their little pants, cute little pants
[1:35:13] or whatever they got and they're
[1:35:15] worshiping God and they're leading the
[1:35:17] the choir or they're in the musicians or
[1:35:20] they're dancing and they're shouting and
[1:35:22] they're woo and they're talking about
[1:35:24] God and they love God and and all that.
[1:35:27] Remember what the Bible says.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; It's an abomination for a woman to wear
[1:35:33] pants. Amen.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; You say that's being judgmental. Well,
[1:35:36] God help us by the Bible to be that.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; We're not condemning nobody, but there
[1:35:44] has to be a separation.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; They're truth.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; So, we're not judging people in the in
[1:35:52] the s that's between us them and God.
[1:35:56] But what we're saying is that I don't
[1:36:00] want my daughters wearing pants. And I
[1:36:02] don't want them getting confused by
[1:36:04] somebody else wearing their pants and
[1:36:07] claiming to love God and claiming to
[1:36:10] have an anointing and claiming all of
[1:36:12] that and now they're just sat here
[1:36:13] confused. I want them to understand it's
[1:36:16] still an abomination.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:36:22] It's an abomination
[1:36:24] for a man to to put on a pair of shorts.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; You know that
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; it's an abomination.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you'll only find it at a
[1:36:37] prophet. Hearing a prophet. He said
[1:36:40] that's women's undergarments.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; I don't care how they do them up. Right.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; I don't care how they have made him to
[1:36:50] look manly.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; A prophet says it's wrong
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; for a man to wear shorts.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Whether you're doing it at the beach or
[1:37:02] whether you're doing it in the pool,
[1:37:04] where wherever, it's wrong to put on a
[1:37:08] woman's undergarment.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; It's just as much as abomination as it
[1:37:15] is for a woman to put on pants.
[1:37:18] Can you say amen?
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Now the the common argument that people
[1:37:22] use today is well that both men back in
[1:37:25] the in the Bible days they wore robes.
[1:37:27] Men and women wore robes and they were
[1:37:29] all the same. You will never get me to
[1:37:31] believe that nonsense. if God would
[1:37:34] require a people that he called out and
[1:37:37] made for himself to be a holy people and
[1:37:41] he told them a woman should not wear
[1:37:43] that which pertainth to a man and a man
[1:37:45] shouldn't wear that that pertainth to a
[1:37:47] woman and here they all wear the same
[1:37:49] kind of material or the same kind of
[1:37:52] garments. That's nonsense.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know much of the history but I
[1:37:59] promise you this. There was a
[1:38:01] difference. There was a difference.
[1:38:03] Amen.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; So we we find that it is a spirit of
[1:38:11] unbelief that explains the word through
[1:38:14] reasoning.
[1:38:16] Another one first Corinthians 11:3. But
[1:38:19] I would have you know that the head of
[1:38:21] every man is Christ and the head of the
[1:38:23] woman is the man and the head of Christ
[1:38:26] is God.
[1:38:28] Try to tell that to the women in society
[1:38:32] today.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; It also goes on to tell us that a woman
[1:38:40] is not to cut her hair.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; And that a man
[1:38:46] is not to have long hair.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I I'll you know, we've
[1:38:53] talked about it years ago, but we'll go
[1:38:55] into it as we go along as to why this uh
[1:39:01] uh is to be. But parents, we've got to
[1:39:05] teach our children the way of holiness.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; We're we're living in a dark age. I get
[1:39:15] it. We're living in the most evil age
[1:39:17] and we're living in the most deceptive
[1:39:19] age.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; And spirits are flo every one of us are
[1:39:25] spirit beings as the prophet taught us.
[1:39:28] We can catch spirits.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; We can catch one another's spirit.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Yeah.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; See, so then we've got to we've got to
[1:39:40] make sure that we teach our children the
[1:39:44] way of holiness. And the only way of
[1:39:47] holiness is a Bible holiness.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; It's not what I think to be holiness.
[1:39:55] It's not what you think to be holiness.
[1:39:57] It's not what the neighbor down the
[1:39:59] street thinks to be holiness. It's what
[1:40:01] God considers to be holiness. Amen.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Now, 2 Corinthians 6:14, "Be ye not,"
[1:40:09] everybody say, "Be ye not."
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Be not
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; unequally yolked together with
[1:40:14] unbelievers.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; For what fellowship hath righteousness
[1:40:18] with unrighteousness? And what communion
[1:40:21] hath light with darkness?
[1:40:24] And what concord hath Christ with?
[1:40:27] And or what part hath he uh uh that
[1:40:31] believeth with an infidel?
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; See, what agreement hath the temple of
[1:40:36] God with idols?
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; For you are the temple of the living God
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; as God has said. Ain't that right?
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; You are a temple made for deity.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why people raise up
[1:40:54] temples. Go to India. Go, go all these
[1:40:58] other places. There's temples that is
[1:41:00] erected to put their gods in.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Well, you're the
[1:41:06] temple that should be consecrated to one
[1:41:09] God, and that's the living God.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; You're the temple that should be
[1:41:15] dedicated only to the living God, the
[1:41:18] one true living God.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So we we find he says,
[1:41:24] "For you are the temple of the living
[1:41:26] God, as God hath said, I will dwell in
[1:41:30] them and walk in them, and I will be
[1:41:33] their God, and they shall be my people.
[1:41:36] Wherefore, as we've read, come out from
[1:41:39] among them, and be ye separate, sayith
[1:41:41] the Lord. Touch not the unclean thing,
[1:41:43] and I will receive you, and will be a
[1:41:46] father unto you, and you shall be my
[1:41:48] sons and daughters, sayeth the Lord
[1:41:50] Almighty." Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; So, do not do not Everybody say, "Do not
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; yoke up yourself with unbelievers."
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; What is an unbeliever? One that denies
[1:42:04] the word.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; They can go to church and still deny the
[1:42:08] word.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Remember Jehoshaphat,
[1:42:14] he did that. He made an alliance with
[1:42:16] Ahab.
[1:42:18] Uh, and they went out to war without
[1:42:20] consulting the Lord. The prophet said
[1:42:22] Jehoshaphat knew better than to do that.
[1:42:25] He knew better than to go out with Ahab.
[1:42:27] He knew better than to go out to war
[1:42:29] without consulting God first.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? But why did he not do
[1:42:34] that? Why didn't he come consult the
[1:42:36] Lord? Because he come under the
[1:42:38] influence of unbelievers.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet said. He said,
[1:42:45] "And that's the way you do when you get
[1:42:47] mixed up with unbelievers. You claim
[1:42:50] your healing here and go outside and
[1:42:52] somebody say, "Oh, it's nonsense.
[1:42:54] There's nothing to it. Don't believe
[1:42:55] that. That's psychology." Well, they're
[1:42:57] saying that in the message now. That's
[1:42:59] psychology. You're just mentally worked
[1:43:01] up. Look out. Right there is the biggest
[1:43:05] danger line you've ever hit.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; You separate yourself from that person
[1:43:11] right then. have nothing else to do with
[1:43:13] them at all. Nothing. But how do you do?
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; you can be kind.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Don't be snobby and a jerk.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Father.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; See, but but he says if they want to be
[1:43:28] led to the Lord, then you do so. Lead
[1:43:30] them to the Lord. But keep yourself away
[1:43:33] from unbelief.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen, brother.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; You listening?
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; There's got to be holiness unto the
[1:43:41] Lord.
[1:43:44] He said, "You go into a church and watch
[1:43:46] the way that minister behaves himself.
[1:43:48] His congregation will do the same
[1:43:49] thing." It's exactly right. You just
[1:43:52] watch it. Go into a church and watch the
[1:43:53] way the pastor teaches and what he does.
[1:43:56] It's that spirit, the kindred spirit.
[1:43:58] So, let's stay among believers. Let's
[1:44:01] stay where we belong and don't get on
[1:44:05] Satan's ground.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; You see, today the problem is the world
[1:44:14] wants mixers and and it's sad to say the
[1:44:16] church is okay with it. Church wants to
[1:44:19] be mixers. We don't want to stand out.
[1:44:22] We want don't want to be too odd.
[1:44:25] So, let's just mingle,
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham would say it this
[1:44:33] way.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "It ain't how close you can
[1:44:37] walk to sin without sinning."
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's how far you can stay
[1:44:42] away from it.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; That's it right there.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; People usually that hang around
[1:44:50] together, he says why they have
[1:44:53] fellowship with each other when they got
[1:44:56] things in common. I think it's strange
[1:45:00] when a person claims to be a Christian
[1:45:02] and they'd rather hang out with sinners
[1:45:03] than they would the church folks.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; I just think that's weird.
[1:45:10] Yeah.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Because the company you hang out with.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Is the ones you've got fellowship with,
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; the ones you've got more in common with.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Well, sure. See, so if you've got things
[1:45:25] in common, like little children, they
[1:45:27] play with each other. Why? They've have
[1:45:29] things in common.
[1:45:32] But another place, after you once join
[1:45:34] yourself up with an unbeliever, you
[1:45:36] kindly take on his ways if you don't
[1:45:40] watch.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; And I want you to I want you to listen,
[1:45:45] young people, those of you that are
[1:45:46] going to these public schools,
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; you may not have that opportunity to go
[1:45:52] to homeschool. I wish you did.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; But sometime mom has to work or or uh or
[1:45:59] whatever. And so, you know, she ain't
[1:46:01] got that time that she would want to to
[1:46:05] invest in in your schooling and things
[1:46:07] like that. Number thing that we keep our
[1:46:10] children and and and I I I want you you
[1:46:13] young people going to the public schools
[1:46:15] is the there are spirits out there.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; There are spirits that are trying to
[1:46:20] take you and dominate you
[1:46:24] and take you to hell.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Yeah. Amen.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; You're you're around that all the time.
[1:46:33] Girls wearing shorts.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're seeing the girls and the
[1:46:37] guys kissing one another.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe they're hugging one another
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; and you're seeing this constantly on a
[1:46:44] daily basis.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; And and and you're seeing them act
[1:46:48] unseemingly.
[1:46:50] If you don't know what the Bible says
[1:46:52] about it, you'll think that's okay.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Hello. And a lot of times they're
[1:47:00] claiming to believe the same Bible you
[1:47:01] believe. They're believing to be a
[1:47:03] Christian. Everybody just about believes
[1:47:05] to be a Christian.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Everybody says they're okay. Everybody
[1:47:09] says they're going to heaven these days.
[1:47:11] Why? Because there's no holiness.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; There's no separation.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And the church has long lost that
[1:47:20] holiness
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; to where we just look and say, "Well,
[1:47:25] everybody's okay. What's right? What's
[1:47:28] wrong?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; And then the preacher looks bad when
[1:47:31] he's But what about mom and dad should
[1:47:33] be teaching this to their children?
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Don't you kiss a boy unless you're
[1:47:38] married.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; That still stands today. But we put the
[1:47:43] TVs. We put movies up. Amen. And our
[1:47:46] children are watching them.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Slopping and kissing. Committing
[1:47:54] adultery. Yeah.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you've heard it. It's become
[1:47:59] big news of the CEO
[1:48:03] uh that got caught on the camera. They
[1:48:05] were at a concert and a kissing camera,
[1:48:08] you know, shown right upon him and he
[1:48:10] had his arms around her and they saw
[1:48:12] that they were discovered and he he
[1:48:14] ducked down. Man, he he's hiding. She
[1:48:18] was over there, you know, and the guy
[1:48:20] that was doing the concerts. Oh, what's
[1:48:23] what do we have here? They're either
[1:48:25] committing adultery
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; or they're very shy people.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Found out that, you know, that was his
[1:48:33] secretary and
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; he's married, got a wife somewhere else
[1:48:37] with two boys.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; And he's over there with another woman,
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; And the world is just beating them up.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Both got fired. Oh,
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; from their jobs over it.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, here's my deal, though.
[1:48:56] I'm thinking, why is the world making
[1:48:58] such a fight?
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; That's true. That's true.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; People are doing this every day.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; They're hypocrites.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; They're doing it every day. Their boys
[1:49:07] and girls are doing it every day. The
[1:49:09] prophet said, "The moment a boy kisses a
[1:49:11] girl and they're not married, that is
[1:49:13] potential adultery."
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; They're committing adultery.
[1:49:21] I know that's not popular, but it's
[1:49:23] true.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Boys aren't to put their hands on girls.
[1:49:27] Girls ain't to to be be hugged by boys
[1:49:30] and and and and vice versa and all that
[1:49:32] without being married.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; It's wrong.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; But it's happening everywhere. So why
[1:49:41] pick on them?
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, what they done was wrong. Yes, he's
[1:49:45] a he's a scumbag
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; cheating on his wife.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; But if you really want to put it,
[1:49:52] Brother Bram talking about marriage and
[1:49:54] divorce. He says, "If I sent that tape
[1:49:56] everywhere else, it'd break up this
[1:49:57] nation."
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Everybody's doing it.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; But what's sad is when the church begins
[1:50:05] to do it.
[1:50:08] And so I want to tell you young people
[1:50:10] and you mothers and your dads ought to
[1:50:13] teach your young children that it's
[1:50:16] wrong to do them.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Well, that might make them judgmental. I
[1:50:22] would rather them to stand there and
[1:50:24] know what's right and what's wrong
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; than to be part of the scripture that
[1:50:29] says woe unto them that call evil good
[1:50:33] and good evil.
[1:50:36] Can you say amen?
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; There's good people.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; No doubt they're good people.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; But good people go to hell just as fast
[1:50:48] as the evil person does.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they do.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; So he says, see, after you once join
[1:50:56] yourself up with unbelievers, you kindly
[1:50:59] take on his ways if you don't watch.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:07] Brother Brandham says, "A man was
[1:51:08] talking to me the other day and he says,
[1:51:10] 'I don't know what I'm going to do. I
[1:51:12] had a good, honest boy, and that boy is
[1:51:14] getting, so he takes what he puts his
[1:51:16] hands on." I said, "Why?"
[1:51:20] The father says he's associating with a
[1:51:22] thief.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; See, you hang around with somebody
[1:51:26] that's a thief, you'll be a thief
[1:51:29] yourself. Yeah.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Old Kentucky mammy used to say, "If you
[1:51:33] lay down with a dog that's got fleas,
[1:51:35] you'll get up with fleas, too."
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; You take a woman that's no good and let
[1:51:39] a girl see a a good decent boy and the
[1:51:42] first thing you know, he's as honorary
[1:51:44] as a pup. Turn it right vice versa. You
[1:51:47] know, you are known by your company. So,
[1:51:50] separate yourself.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; I I understand that that that church has
[1:51:57] problems too. Every family here has got
[1:52:00] problems.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; All of our young people are not angels.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; All of our you parents are not angels.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; And I get it. You know, we can look and
[1:52:10] it's so easy for for young parents
[1:52:13] that's got children to look at the other
[1:52:15] parents say, "Well, they ain't doing
[1:52:17] this and they ain't doing that." And
[1:52:18] what you don't realize every other young
[1:52:21] couple is looking at you and saying,
[1:52:22] "Well, I don't know why they let their
[1:52:23] children do this and I don't know why
[1:52:25] they're doing this and I don't know why
[1:52:26] they're doing that." See, we we can all
[1:52:28] find fault just amongst ourselves. But I
[1:52:30] would rather be amongst you than I would
[1:52:33] be amongst out there. Amen. With people
[1:52:36] that are a godless and don't know this
[1:52:38] message and don't believe this message.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:46] See, and and and and so if we're not
[1:52:49] careful, we become as Balum did when he
[1:52:52] looked at Israel and he looked at all
[1:52:55] the hinder parts
[1:53:00] and and and thought, "How in the world
[1:53:02] could a holy God put up with such a
[1:53:05] people like this?"
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; But what he didn't realize is God had
[1:53:10] called these people holy unto himself.
[1:53:13] He had separated them not because they
[1:53:17] were perfect, not because they were
[1:53:19] sinless,
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; because he loved them.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; I hope this all right.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; So, Jehoshaphat being yolked up with
[1:53:31] believers, the prophet said he took the
[1:53:33] unbelievers away. And that's the way
[1:53:35] many spiritfilled Christians after
[1:53:37] revival falls because they yoke
[1:53:40] themselves up amongst people that said,
[1:53:42] "Well, I go to church. We're as good as
[1:53:45] the rest of them." Now, I want you to
[1:53:47] you young people, you probably got
[1:53:49] family that same way. I I go to church.
[1:53:55] Doesn't bother me to watch movies. We're
[1:53:58] okay. I love God. God just looks at the
[1:54:01] heart. That's the common thing that
[1:54:02] everybody says. Yeah.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; God looks at the heart.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; But we also know from the abundance of
[1:54:09] the heart, the mouth speaketh.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; See, and and and so uh um we we look at
[1:54:19] all these things, but he said, see, uh
[1:54:22] uh uh they yoke themselves up amongst
[1:54:25] people that said, "Well, I go to church.
[1:54:28] We're as good as the rest of them." And
[1:54:30] you lose your experience.
[1:54:34] I hope it's all right.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; This way I feel, so I'm fine with it.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; You might have got an experience at our
[1:54:42] tent meeting to where you cried and you
[1:54:44] just felt God. But you can lose that
[1:54:47] experience. And don't you forget that.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; You can lose that experience by hanging
[1:54:51] around with unbelievers. That's right.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; You You can get an experience today
[1:54:57] where you just feel God and you feel
[1:54:59] broken and and God just moves and you
[1:55:01] just cry and and you you're under that
[1:55:04] presence. Amen. And God is actually
[1:55:06] doing something for you. But you can
[1:55:09] lose that when you're going out there
[1:55:11] and letting your friends, amen, be
[1:55:13] unbelievers and that's all you're
[1:55:15] hanging out with and they don't know
[1:55:17] about miracles of God. They ain't
[1:55:19] looking for a rapture. They ain't
[1:55:21] looking for. They're interested in
[1:55:22] sports. They're interested in the movie.
[1:55:24] They're interested in some gal or girl.
[1:55:27] Amen. That that has no convictions
[1:55:29] whatsoever of God. Amen. And if you're
[1:55:32] hanging around that, you'll lose your
[1:55:34] experience.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; So he says, stay right in the word road.
[1:55:46] Stay right in the road. No matter what
[1:55:47] the rest of them does, you know where
[1:55:50] you belong. You know who you belong to.
[1:55:54] Stay right under the power of prayer all
[1:55:56] the time. Don't let them call you off to
[1:55:59] something else in amusements and so
[1:56:01] forth, saying, "Well, there's no harm in
[1:56:03] this, and if there's a question, don't
[1:56:06] do it. Stay away from it."
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; And and and and parents, if our children
[1:56:13] are not able to stand up for themselves,
[1:56:16] then don't allow them.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Stand for them.
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; I thank God for a dead that would do
[1:56:29] such a thing.
[1:56:32] Now, the prophet said in another place,
[1:56:34] "Don't mix Mary."
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. We're talking about holiness.
[1:56:39] a separated people unto the Lord. Don't
[1:56:42] mix Mary.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Marry a boy that believes just exactly
[1:56:48] like you do. For after all, God is the
[1:56:52] main important thing.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; That we are here in the earth to do is
[1:56:57] to serve him.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. See, and if you do marry
[1:57:03] or anything contrary to that, you'll pay
[1:57:05] for it in the days that lays ahead of
[1:57:07] you. You must always remember it's by
[1:57:10] faith and not by sight.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And and I know I I I
[1:57:16] know boys and girls, they get all giddy
[1:57:19] around one another and and they think
[1:57:21] they fall in love and they think this
[1:57:22] and they think that and and uh you know,
[1:57:25] a boy can swoo a girl uh big time and
[1:57:28] and and girls can dress in such a way
[1:57:31] that that they sexy and they appeal to
[1:57:33] you and you think you're in love and and
[1:57:36] all of these things and and all this,
[1:57:38] but remember, God is the main thing in
[1:57:40] your life.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Hello. You can be all giddy and and and
[1:57:44] and all these goosebumps when you're
[1:57:46] around a boy or around a girl and and
[1:57:49] all that, but remember when marriage
[1:57:50] when you marry that person, all that
[1:57:53] leaves.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. And then you're
[1:57:58] set there and then you got to think now.
[1:58:00] What am I going to do about my family?
[1:58:02] What am I going to do about my children?
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:09] Amen.
[1:58:12] See, so so think now
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; plan.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; I've always, you know, told my children,
[1:58:20] you know, think, pray
[1:58:23] now. What do you want in a girl? What do
[1:58:26] you want in a boy?
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; What do you want that special person in
[1:58:30] your life to be?
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Right? while you're sober, while you're
[1:58:34] not intoxicated with feelings and and
[1:58:37] and goosebumps and and uh your hormones
[1:58:40] going wacko. Just think,
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; what is it that I want?
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; What is it kind of a home do I want my
[1:58:49] home to be? What what what do I want my
[1:58:52] children to be raised in?
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; And then stay with that.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Pray for that right one.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:02] Ain't that right?
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Stay with it. And then when all the the
[1:59:06] the goosebumps and he makes me feel good
[1:59:10] and and and she just Oh, she's the
[1:59:12] perfect one. Think about what you've
[1:59:14] been asking God.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; And then be sober.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; And pray. Brother said, "Pray, pray,
[1:59:27] pray."
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:30] Ain't that right?
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; It's
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; like brother George Smith says, there's
[1:59:33] a lot worse things than being single.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; There's a lot worse things to be in
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; than being single. Cuz once you get
[1:59:43] married, that's it, buddy.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham, another place,
[1:59:53] watch how you make your alliance.
[1:59:55] Watch what you're doing. how you yoke
[1:59:58] yourself up with unbelievers. Keep
[2:00:00] Everybody say keep
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; yourself
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; clean.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Especially in the day that we're living.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Keep yourself clean, especially in the
[2:00:14] day that we're living. And I will tell
[2:00:17] you, social media has opened the door to
[2:00:20] all kinds of evil things.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen?
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Now, we find as I get ready to close,
[2:00:36] the majority of people today have this
[2:00:38] idea that separation isn't a part of
[2:00:40] Christianity and they think that if the
[2:00:43] promise is unconditional,
[2:00:45] which it is, then they don't have to do
[2:00:48] anything. But, but what they failed to
[2:00:51] see is the promise is to those who God
[2:00:54] knew would want it. Yeah.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; See, like brother Brandham says, before
[2:01:00] there was a world, you were in God's
[2:01:03] thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost
[2:01:05] because he knew you'd be wanting it.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Now, we didn't know right now, but God
[2:01:12] knew.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; We might have been content with the
[2:01:14] world. We might have been doing
[2:01:15] whatever. We're searching for things and
[2:01:17] we just didn't know.
[2:01:19] But God knew you.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God knew that if ever given a
[2:01:24] chance,
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; you would take it.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; So God knew you would want it before you
[2:01:34] even knew you wanted it.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; that's true.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; So he said, see, he knew you'd be
[2:01:39] wanting it. And he chose you himself
[2:01:42] because you desired. See, he chose you
[2:01:44] in Christ before you or Jesus any of you
[2:01:47] was on the earth. And he sent Jesus to
[2:01:50] die to prepare the way to send the Holy
[2:01:52] Ghost to bring you to himself.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; So God when he called Abraham, he was
[2:01:59] not trying to do get Abraham to do
[2:02:01] something against his will.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; True, brother.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Abraham was willing to go to another
[2:02:09] land. Abraham was willing to forsake his
[2:02:13] idolatry. Abraham was willing. See, he
[2:02:16] readily accept God's will for his life.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Now, there are people who just refuse to
[2:02:27] repent
[2:02:29] and admit that they're wrong. They
[2:02:31] justify their actions and their words
[2:02:33] and thoughts and and before you know it,
[2:02:37] it just becomes a battle. It becomes
[2:02:39] just a uh you know, against God's word.
[2:02:43] and and and because they're not they're
[2:02:45] not wanting to just surrender.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; They're not wanting to give up. And and
[2:02:51] so that's where you become people become
[2:02:54] rebels in the church.
[2:02:57] And and if you're not careful, it
[2:02:59] becomes then it becomes legalism. I want
[2:03:01] to tell you the promises of God are to
[2:03:04] those who want them promises.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And the promises and
[2:03:10] and and holiness is for those who want
[2:03:13] holiness.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; When God calls a people to separate,
[2:03:18] there ain't this, well, I'm I I don't I
[2:03:21] just go down to the next church.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; it ain't that way.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; It's people that really are ready to
[2:03:31] surrender.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, church, we'll be
[2:03:35] surrendering all of our lives. Paul
[2:03:38] says, "I die daily."
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; See, so so if it's against God's word,
[2:03:45] we must repent of it and separate
[2:03:47] ourselves from it. Ain't that right?
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Now, did did Abraham make mistakes? Yes.
[2:03:55] Did Did Abraham uh failed to obey at
[2:03:58] times? Yes. The prophet said he even
[2:04:01] backslid.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; But I want to ask you, was God
[2:04:05] disappointed in Abraham? No.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Right. See, Abraham wasn't perfect in as
[2:04:12] as as in sinless, right?
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; He was under grace,
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; And God had made an unconditional
[2:04:23] covenant. And that's the only way God
[2:04:26] could keep his promise to Abraham.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The children of Israel
[2:04:34] wasn't perfect either. We saw their ups
[2:04:36] and downs. We saw their backslidings.
[2:04:38] And we saw the things like that. Uh uh
[2:04:41] but notice what God said in Numbers
[2:04:43] 23:21. He hath not beheld iniquity in
[2:04:46] Jacob. Neither hath he seen p uh
[2:04:50] perverseness in Israel. The Lord his God
[2:04:53] is with him and the shout of a king is
[2:04:57] among them. Can you say amen? Well, how
[2:05:00] can that be? a people that is was was
[2:05:03] sinful, a people that had their ups and
[2:05:06] downs. Uh uh Abraham backslid, lied, and
[2:05:09] and all of these things. Well, the
[2:05:12] prophet said there was a brazen serpent
[2:05:14] going before them. There was a pillar of
[2:05:16] fire. There was an atonement to take
[2:05:19] away that sin that was on Israel. It was
[2:05:23] election.
[2:05:24] God was going to take them through. Yes
[2:05:27] or no? God's give the uh covenant
[2:05:31] unconditional. I'll save Abraham and his
[2:05:34] seed.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him?
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; So, we find that the color red is a sign
[2:05:43] of danger to us. But yet, the color red
[2:05:46] is a sign of redemption. Redemption, red
[2:05:49] is redemption color to God.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; It means redemption. And and redemption
[2:05:55] comes through red through the shedding
[2:05:56] of the blood. The Bible says without the
[2:05:58] shedding of blood, there is no remission
[2:06:00] of sins. Ain't that right? In the Old
[2:06:03] Testament, God required a heer. That
[2:06:05] heer had to be red, a red heer, solid
[2:06:08] red, no spots in it or or whatever. And
[2:06:12] and and brother said, perfectly red
[2:06:15] because God looks through red.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? God looks through red.
[2:06:21] He chose red to look through blood.
[2:06:24] Amen. And and so Isaiah 1:18, God says,
[2:06:28] "Come now and let us reason together,
[2:06:30] sayeth the Lord. Though your sins be as
[2:06:33] scarlet, they'll be white as snow.
[2:06:35] Though they be red like crimson, they'll
[2:06:37] be as shall be as wool." Ain't that
[2:06:40] right? So the prophet tells us, and you
[2:06:42] go look it up and try it. When you when
[2:06:44] you look at red through red, it's white.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So when God looks at
[2:06:53] us a a uh uh that is red uh scarlet red
[2:06:59] from our sins and and all of that when
[2:07:02] he looks through the blood of Christ and
[2:07:04] looks at us. Amen. All he sees is white.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; God
[2:07:10] God provided something that would
[2:07:13] separate us from our sins.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a people that is
[2:07:22] rebellious. I'm going to live in old
[2:07:24] way. And so God says, "Okay, yeah, you
[2:07:25] go ahead. I still love you. You're my
[2:07:27] you're my babies and and you know, all
[2:07:30] these things." No. God would choose a
[2:07:33] people that that is full of mistakes
[2:07:36] that that that you know that that that
[2:07:39] fail many times, but the heart is
[2:07:41] saying, "God, I want to serve you. I I
[2:07:46] Yeah. Oh, I hope you understand. You
[2:07:48] see, how could we separate ourselves
[2:07:51] from sin?
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; How could we separate?
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet said, God looking
[2:08:01] through the blood, he doesn't see you no
[2:08:03] more as a sinner. He sees you redeemed.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; You're redeemed because he always sees
[2:08:08] you through Christ. That's the reason we
[2:08:10] can be perfect. Not perfect in the sense
[2:08:13] of sinless. We're perfect in the eyes of
[2:08:15] God when we're in Christ. Can you say
[2:08:17] amen?
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him? Amen. God tried to
[2:08:21] get make a covenant, a a a conditional
[2:08:24] covenant with man and man broke it. And
[2:08:26] the prophet says man just can't keep his
[2:08:28] promise to God because his adversary is
[2:08:31] too great.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you something. Our
[2:08:34] adversary is too great
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; to try to do it on our own. We can't do
[2:08:38] it.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Why? We were all born with a sinful
[2:08:42] nature, a carnal nature. We all know
[2:08:44] these things. Amen. And and because we
[2:08:47] have this sinful nature, we have sinful
[2:08:50] desires. Our desires are lustful. Our
[2:08:53] our desires are evil. Our desires are
[2:08:56] sinful.
[2:08:58] You understand what I'm saying? Amen.
[2:09:00] And because we have that sinful nature,
[2:09:03] we're under the devil's control.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; So, we have no holiness. We can try to
[2:09:12] act holy and try to obtain holiness, but
[2:09:14] it only makes us hypocrites.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; The Apostle Peter taught us to add
[2:09:21] faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[2:09:24] patience, brotherly kindness, charity.
[2:09:26] Taught us to do this. Brother Brandham
[2:09:27] talked about it in the message, Stature
[2:09:29] of a Perfect Man. And he said, "There's
[2:09:31] some people that have a portion of this
[2:09:34] that don't even pretend to be
[2:09:35] Christians, but that won't do it. It's
[2:09:38] like a black bird trying to put on
[2:09:40] peacock feathers in his wings.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; To make him a peacock. He only disgraces
[2:09:45] himself. Be better to stay a black bird.
[2:09:47] And when he tries to exercise these
[2:09:49] things without being a Christian, he's
[2:09:51] just simply all out of place.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says another place, the
[2:09:57] devil is religious and he can put on a
[2:10:00] very much pious and holiness actions,
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; but God looks on the heart.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that right?
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; So, we find that God had to do the
[2:10:12] separation
[2:10:14] because as Paul said, they that are of
[2:10:16] the flesh do mind the things of the
[2:10:17] flesh
[2:10:19] and and and all of these things. If if
[2:10:22] you're a duck, you like water, right?
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; If you're a pig, you like you like to
[2:10:27] wallow in the mud. If you're a buzzard,
[2:10:29] you you like to eat dead things. It's
[2:10:31] it's your nature. And brother Brandham
[2:10:33] said, if you're a devil, you'll like the
[2:10:35] things of the world. If you're a
[2:10:36] Christian, you'll like Christ.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; So, where are you at today? You claiming
[2:10:41] to be up here eating the things of the
[2:10:43] Lord and then going down and rooting
[2:10:45] with the devil. There's something wrong
[2:10:46] with that. Ain't that right?
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; See, so so God had to do the separation.
[2:10:51] God had to do the calling out. He
[2:10:53] couldn't say, "Brother Bill, I've I've I
[2:10:56] require you to separate yourself, but if
[2:11:00] you've got that sinful nature, you ain't
[2:11:02] going to be able to do it. you'll start
[2:11:04] being able to live and tow the line as
[2:11:06] far as on the outward amen side. But
[2:11:09] down inside, there's still something
[2:11:10] there that's craving these things. So,
[2:11:13] there's not been a true separation.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; A minister, Brother Brand was talking to
[2:11:23] a certain
[2:11:26] minister
[2:11:28] uh or about a Yeah. talking to a certain
[2:11:30] minister and he was telling him about
[2:11:32] another pastor
[2:11:35] that asked his congregation to sign a
[2:11:38] pledge
[2:11:39] that uh they would at least attend
[2:11:42] Sunday school for 6 months out of the
[2:11:44] year.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; And he sent out 500 cards to his
[2:11:48] congregation
[2:11:50] and he said only two cards come back
[2:11:54] two committed.
[2:11:56] And they're at a restaurant and Brother
[2:11:58] Brown's talking while their waitress was
[2:12:01] excited about this dance that she was
[2:12:03] going to go to when she got off work.
[2:12:06] And I think there was on the radio. They
[2:12:08] were advertising it and uh this about
[2:12:11] this dance that was to take place
[2:12:13] tonight and the DJ said they would be
[2:12:15] there and and all that and playing songs
[2:12:18] and all that. And so she was excited.
[2:12:20] And brother Brown said this little girl
[2:12:22] started, you know, across the floor
[2:12:24] hollering, "Todoodle deod."
[2:12:28] And
[2:12:30] said they was going to have some kind of
[2:12:31] an old barn swing dance or something or
[2:12:34] another. And she got down there to that
[2:12:35] radio and she throwed a kiss to the guy
[2:12:37] through the radio. So excited she didn't
[2:12:40] know I was at the door. And she said,
[2:12:43] "You know, to honey, I'll see you there
[2:12:46] tonight." And I thought, "Yeah, it's
[2:12:49] true. You'll be there. No doubt at all.
[2:12:51] You'll be there." And she walked over
[2:12:53] and she kept going around the floor
[2:12:55] hollering, you know, and like she was
[2:12:56] dancing. And she said, "Oh, excuse me."
[2:12:59] She said, "I I just love to dance." So,
[2:13:02] well, Brother Ram said, "I noticed
[2:13:04] that." And she said, "Oh, I just love
[2:13:07] it." He said, "Well, I believe that."
[2:13:09] So, he looked at that minister after
[2:13:11] this minister was, you know, or about
[2:13:14] his congregation.
[2:13:17] And he said, "You think that girl,
[2:13:20] you think that girl would have to
[2:13:23] be made to sign a card to go out to that
[2:13:25] old barn tonight for that dance?"
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Now, you wouldn't have to get her to
[2:13:30] sign a card to agree
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; cuz it's down inside of her.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "See, it's
[2:13:37] it's because in her heart is a spirit
[2:13:41] that feeds on that."
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. And he said, "See, if a
[2:13:46] man's born of God, when the church bell
[2:13:48] rings, you can't stay away from it.
[2:13:50] There's something on the inside that
[2:13:52] calls you that out, the deep calling to
[2:13:54] the deep." See, you've got to go. You've
[2:13:57] got to get right here, brother. If that
[2:13:59] spirit in there is still worshiping the
[2:14:01] world, the love of God's not even in
[2:14:04] you. Can you say amen? So in other
[2:14:07] words, in order for there to be true
[2:14:09] holiness, God has to do the separation
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; from the soul.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Inside out.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; I pray that this helped you today. But I
[2:14:27] I I do pray that
[2:14:30] you young people, all of us, but you
[2:14:33] young people really see the need for God
[2:14:36] to separate you.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Down into your heart to where you say,
[2:14:40] "God, circumcise my heart."
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's the only way you're going to
[2:14:46] survive. That's right.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Just to be honest. And you
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; I pray that God does that to my
[2:14:52] children. I've prayed that through all
[2:14:54] for all of my children.
[2:14:57] But I pray that for you children, you
[2:14:59] parents that got children.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Because the world is so strong, the pull
[2:15:05] of the world is so real.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; That there could be holiness.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; God make us holy.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; It's not that you again, it's not a
[2:15:18] sinless perfection. It's that the blood
[2:15:21] covers you.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; You're walking doing his will. You've
[2:15:26] got that desire. The desire is gone from
[2:15:28] the world.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; The the girls can't attract you no more.
[2:15:32] The worldly boys can't attract you no
[2:15:34] more. The worldly things can't attract
[2:15:36] you.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; The the attraction just ain't there. You
[2:15:40] used to love movies. You used to love
[2:15:42] television. It's just not there no more.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; You used to love just spending your time
[2:15:47] with with in things that just was
[2:15:49] ungodly, not right. But it's just not
[2:15:52] there.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; What is it? God has separated you.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; He's brought a holiness to you.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's going to use you
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; for his glory.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; His glory.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You love him?
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We love
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; a true separation.
[2:16:18] And this is what the people of God have
[2:16:20] come to is a separation.
[2:16:30] It's not that we got the tape measure
[2:16:31] out.
[2:16:34] It's not that we're over here checking
[2:16:36] everybody, making sure they're doing
[2:16:38] good, and putting our nose in
[2:16:40] everybody's business. That's Now, I'm
[2:16:41] going to tell you, that's just that's
[2:16:42] just the way it is with legalism.
[2:16:45] Everybody's got their eye on everybody.
[2:16:53] But we find out it takes God.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; And that shows the true election.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Is that when God comes knocking on the
[2:17:03] heart, there's something that responds,
[2:17:05] God, that's what I want.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; I want to be that.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; And if you're having struggles with
[2:17:11] things,
[2:17:13] that's just where you lay your life at
[2:17:14] the altar and say, "God,
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; I want more of you."
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:20] I I just want more of you. I I I I want
[2:17:23] I want the old things to die. I want the
[2:17:27] world just to lose its hold.
[2:17:30] And I want to come more into you and
[2:17:32] what your plan is for my life.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Let the world do what they want to do.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; But I'm separated.
[2:17:44] You've separated me. you you've caused
[2:17:46] me to come for this this purpose.
[2:17:51] The world ain't going to listen to the
[2:17:52] message. They don't want the message,
[2:17:54] but that's okay.
[2:17:56] It's for you.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:20:36] [Music]
[2:20:43] [Music]
[2:21:00] Okay,
[2:21:01] brother Terry and Sister Alice,
[2:21:06] supposed to be having a meeting with her
[2:21:09] son today over the phone and
[2:21:12] needing to
[2:21:15] be seeking counseling and things for his
[2:21:17] marriage and other situations and
[2:21:22] they're asking God for wisdom.
[2:21:25] And I tell you what, I I think that's
[2:21:28] honorable when parents would come and
[2:21:32] just asking for God's wisdom.
[2:21:34] we realize just how
[2:21:39] sacred these things are and you know the
[2:21:42] words that we say our children need that
[2:21:46] and um and so they're just asking for
[2:21:49] all of our prayer here today is that we
[2:21:52] could just bind together that the spirit
[2:21:55] of wisdom would come upon them and just
[2:21:58] touch I know they've been praying for uh
[2:22:01] their son and as a parent I I know
[2:22:04] they're they're burdened for him and and
[2:22:07] things and and so we just want God to be
[2:22:11] there and not only to be here with them
[2:22:14] but to be on the other end dealing with
[2:22:18] that situation and the spirit of God
[2:22:20] just working. And so let let's just pray
[2:22:24] together. Father,
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; oh God,
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; here's an elderly
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; couple. father, minister of the gospel
[2:22:35] and his wife
[2:22:38] and still give us grace
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; just humble in their heart to ask for
[2:22:43] your guidance in this.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that you would direct
[2:22:48] this their words and that their words
[2:22:52] would be inspired of you.
[2:22:55] May your presence just be in that place
[2:22:57] and let it be over there where where
[2:23:00] Brad is, God.
[2:23:02] Father, I pray Lord that you would just
[2:23:05] work a work God. That you would just
[2:23:08] move in this situation, Lord, and turn
[2:23:11] things around.
[2:23:13] Father, I pray that the desire would be
[2:23:15] there, Lord. And he would follow that
[2:23:18] desire to serve you and to consecrate
[2:23:21] himself to you, Father, as we see the
[2:23:24] time is drawing near, Lord. And oh
[2:23:28] father, we know that you're I just
[2:23:29] believe you're bringing the children in.
[2:23:32] Parents have been praying and seeking
[2:23:34] you and holding on. Father, oh God, let
[2:23:38] it be this time. Oh father, break every
[2:23:42] wall. Uh that the enemy is built up.
[2:23:45] Father, I pray God that Satan would be
[2:23:48] feeded to be defeated today. Oh Lord, we
[2:23:52] thank you. go before them in Jesus
[2:23:55] Christ's name. We thank you, Father.
[2:23:59] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed
[2:24:02] be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.

[2:41:18] "Surely
[2:41:21] the presence
[2:41:24] of the Lord
[2:41:26] is in this place.
[2:41:29] I can feel

[2:41:40] I can see feel the brush of angels

[2:41:52] Surely the presence

[2:41:59] is in this place as they play softly
[2:42:03] now. God bless you.
[2:42:06] is our prayer.
[2:42:09] Just know that we praying for each of
[2:42:12] you and
[2:42:14] pray that God just brings us all up
[2:42:18] closer and higher.
[2:42:20] And
[2:42:22] as I always I solicit your prayers
[2:42:26] and um
[2:42:29] I want to be drawn closer to the Lord. I
[2:42:32] I want to so reflect him. I want to
[2:42:35] reflect him to my wife, to my children,
[2:42:38] to you. I want to reflect him to the
[2:42:41] sinner.
[2:42:43] I want God to so separate me
[2:42:48] from the world.
[2:42:51] That he could so use me.
[2:42:53] Amen. That's that's certainly my desire.
[2:42:56] And I know that's your desire for
[2:42:59] yourself as well.
[2:43:01] May God bless you. Keep one another in
[2:43:03] your uh prayers. Amen. remember uh
[2:43:07] prayer service tomorrow at 7:00
[2:43:12] and u for those of you who can make it
[2:43:16] and um
[2:43:18] we want to keep sister Martha in our
[2:43:20] prayer and u Satan is really fighting
[2:43:25] her in her body
[2:43:27] and u doctors have not been able to find
[2:43:31] out at this point what's going on
[2:43:34] but we know we know ultimately it's the
[2:43:36] devil, but something's really happening
[2:43:41] and
[2:43:42] I know there she's a private person. She
[2:43:45] doesn't like a lot of attention to her,
[2:43:49] but she needs our prayers
[2:43:52] and so
[2:43:55] when you pray, pray for her that God
[2:43:58] will just help her. And I've heard that
[2:44:01] Sister Christa will be having u some
[2:44:05] kind of surgery tomorrow and so we want
[2:44:07] to keep her in our prayer as well. God
[2:44:09] will bring her through and give her a
[2:44:12] speedy recovery. Amen. And so I think
[2:44:17] that is it at this point. Uh brother
[2:44:20] Josiah and
[2:44:22] Judah will be coming home I think today
[2:44:24] or tomorrow. So we want to keep them in
[2:44:27] our prayers. they would be traveling.
[2:44:30] Amen. And so, um, also, uh, Brother
[2:44:33] Diego, I don't have my phone, but he's
[2:44:36] going to be having a meeting August, uh,
[2:44:41] 21st.
[2:44:43] I think it's 21st, 2nd, and 3rd, 23rd,
[2:44:48] somewhere's in there. And, uh, I'll try
[2:44:50] to get more information, but he would
[2:44:54] just be excited if any of us could go.
[2:44:57] they come here to ours. He helps him and
[2:45:00] his brother has helped us with the
[2:45:01] translation
[2:45:03] and brother Wayne uh will be
[2:45:04] ministering, brother Andrew Glover,
[2:45:07] uh brother uh
[2:45:11] Samuel Browning and then another his
[2:45:15] Hispanic brother. So, they'll all be
[2:45:18] ministering. So, uh I know you'll hear
[2:45:20] great word, hear the message, and um uh
[2:45:25] you'll you'll be blessed. And so if
[2:45:27] you're able to go, it's about 7 hours
[2:45:29] away. So um might be a little drive, but
[2:45:33] uh it'll be worth it if if you can go.
[2:45:36] So uh God bless you and let's just bow
[2:45:39] our heads in prayer. Levi, do you want
[2:45:41] to dismiss us in prayer?
