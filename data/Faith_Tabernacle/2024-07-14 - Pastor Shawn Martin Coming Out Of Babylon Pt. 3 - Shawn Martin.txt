the book of uh Revelations the 18th chapter we want to look at that uh also just let you know there will be no evening service tonight and um so I think some of us going to go visit um brother Shi and sister bethan and and uh cheer them up and so um um going to do that this evening um also um sister uh Bethany uh Lawson Hatfield um I know by Lawson but brother Wayne's daughter um is having some issues um been struggling uh uh for a a month or so and uh passing out and um anyway she had an episode last night and they had to rush her to the hospital and um the doctors don't know what to do at this point and um so they're asking for prayer and you know brother Wayne's been a real dear friend to me uh through the years and and uh been a real support to us uh here at the church and supported this church um for many years now and um um you know he's um uh just been a real blessing to many many people around the world um and he stood with this message for many years and and you know I just I I can understand the the you know the con concern that he would have of course brother Isaac you know that's his wife and um so really want to just take in in to Heart uh for this situation that uh I know the Lord can heal her raise her up uh or he can let the doctors know what is going on and uh you know if the Lord chooses that way to work through the doctors but whatever it is I know it's a concern for the family at this point brother Wayne is uh in Tennessee right now preaching a meeting and so I know his heart's you know I'm sure torn wanting to be home uh with his daughter uh there and uh she can't get out of bed uh or she'll she'll just fall and pass out and um so um it's it's a concern for them and so uh maybe we could just go into the Lord to the Lord in prayer for this need and just uh ask the Lord for his help today for us as well father we are just standing in behalf of uh Bethany here a young mother Lord with her child and young wife her husband Lord and I I know that's concern and your brother Wayne or daddy father mom M Christen Lord um I I'm just asking that you would just touch Bethany Lord I don't know what's going on Lord but we do know where it's coming from it's a spirit that's attacking her body but not only attacking her but indirectly attacking brother Wayne's Ministry and brother Isaac's Ministry Lord as he coming up giving devoting his life to this message Father preaching it Lord and brother Wayne giving his life Lord to this his ministry to this message I just pray father that you would just touch Lord and that you would raise her up off that bed whatever is going on Lord that she could be a mother to her her child Lord and father that she could uh be able to stand behind her husband as he would Minister the gospel father I pray that you would drive that spirit away from her father we as a church are believing and standing with the family Lord in this situation and I pray also father that you would be with us this morning how we need you father pray that You' just give us your unction your inspiration father May Revelation come to us Lord and let it so be embedded in our soul oh God I pray those that are gone out of town wherever they are I pray that you would bless them be with them Father bring them home safely father we just pray and we just give All to You Lord bless brother Wayne as he's laboring to preach your gospel this morning Father I know there's a weight on his heart father and but Lord he's standing at the post of Duty God anoint him use him in a mighty way we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord uh Revelations the 18th chapter and um going to start at the uh first verse and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people not all people are going to come out but there is a voice for the elect come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues amen you can have your seats this morning I want to maybe just continue on the thought coming out of Babylon and um I'm so glad that we've been able to come out amen and um uh that that's to me is is Grace and it's in this last day that we have heard the voice of God calling us out amen and through the message of the hour it's amazing how preaching of the Gospel has an effect Upon Our Lives but it does and we must never never underestimate the the power of preaching the gospel and for all of us ministers we must take it uh uh treat it with such importance that it's not just preaching a sermon but we're we're we're been called to have an effect upon the people and uh and you know it's why we must preach the message because the message is the key of calling us out amen it's the only way we can come out is by the message of the hour and so but because we have heard voice of God it it means that there is nothing nothing able to hold us and keep us any longer uh bound and and according to the scriptures Babylon captures it's a it's a predator um and it captures its prey and holds them and so it's it's not something that you can just join and then leave anytime you want you you you just can't come and go anytime you please this is not something to play with um uh uh you know it's it it it took it took the voice uh of God to bring a Deliverance so we would call it the voice of Deliverance uh it's it's just like the children of Israel in the Old Testament they could not just come and go go uh uh you know enter into Egypt and leave Egypt anytime they wanted uh because they were a people that was held captive by that nation and that's what that's why it took a promise of God to give them a a sure future that they would never they would not be slaves and and and and held captive in bondage in Egypt forever but but they they could not come out on their own this this it would take a voice of Deliverance a message of Deliverance to actually bring them out and so God would tell them that that they're going to be in captivity for this certain amount of time but I will come and I will deliver them and and so uh uh it took Moses that was the whole point of Moses's Ministry was to deliver them people came with a message of Deliverance and and uh um and by his message the supernatural took place by his message God defeated the Enemy by his message a token was given to the people provided for the people that they could escape this death angel that was getting ready to pass through the land but but the key to the supernatural was the message the key of of of of safety was the message everything that the people needed to be delivered was by the message that Moses brought to them if Moses had not come with the message the people would have never been delivered the people that would reject Moses's message would have stayed behind in captivity so God would deliver them by a prophet's message and that message would be a message of Deliverance he did not send than just a any Ministry it had to be a prophet's message that would come to the people to deliver them ain't that right so the Deliverance of the people God did not use a natural Army to deliver them uh uh uh he did not use a psychologist to deliver them he did not deliver them by some intellectual genius amen he delivered them by the power of God through the message of Moses amen the word of the Lord ain't that right and that message destroyed their enemy that because it was not a man's message it was the message of the Lord and and it it destroyed the enemy and and in Exodus 14:13 uh Moses said to the people fear not remember they they' come out of Egypt now they're getting ready to looks like they're going to be slaughtered by that same enemy that was chasing them him and and they're they're look like they're trapped the Red Seas before them but God intentionally LED them that way to show forth his power but notice the message of that hour the message of the hour told them fear not stand Ste and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you uh to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever amen the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace so so as as Egypt was to the people of Israel a natural people so has Babylon been Amen to God's elect amen and and Babylon has actually been an enemy to God's people throughout time and and like like um Second Kings 20 and 16 and Isaiah said unto Hezekiah hear the word of the Lord behold the days come that all that is in thine house that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried away into Babylon uh carried into Babylon nothing shall be left sayeth the Lord and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which Thou shalt beget shall they take away the Babylonians take away and they shall be Unix in the Palace of the king of Babylon then you you you could look in in um uh uh uh 2 Kings 24 and8 jein was 18 years old when he began to Reign he reigned in Jerusalem 3 months and his mother's name was uh NE neusa something like that and and and um the daughter of uh elthan uh from of Jerusalem something to that effect and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord according to all that his father had done at that time the Servants of nebuch Nezar king of Babylon come against Jerusalem and the city was SE besieged and Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon come against the city and his servants did besiege it and and you could go on through that scriptures of how they uh uh captured that City and they took uh the king they took the the the inhabitants of Jerusalem uh uh into captivity uh then you could also go into Jeremiah and how he he talks uh uh uh the Babylonian uh come King Nebuchadnezzar come against Israel again Jerusalem and capture the king put his eyes out and and and and they served the Babylonians and the CH calans and and all of these things and so uh uh but if you notice anytime they went into captivity uh to Babylon it's when the people drifted from the word of the Lord when God's people drifted from the word of the Lord then Babylon Ians would have the power to bring them people into captivity and and and uh and this captivity was was a serious thing because they would make the people serve their gods they would make the people talk their language they would try their best to to uh uh uh make Israel make their enemy where just obsolete I guess it would be the word uh uh but God would always Preserve Israel but there was one time remember the prophecy was that Israel would serve in Babylon for 70 years and and that's a long time to be in captivity serving other gods and and and such but but see uh uh uh uh but but God promised uh that Babylon would be utterly destroyed he he promised that Jeremiah 51:24 God would say I I will Render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Cala uh all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight sayeth the Lord behold I'm against thee Oh destroying Mountain so he calls Babylon a destroying Mountain sayeth the Lord which destroyeth not just just uh uh uh Israel not just attacking Israel but which destroyeth all the Earth and I will stretch out my hand upon thee and r thow thee down from the rocks and I will make thee a burnt mountain and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner nor a stone for foundations but Thou shalt be desolate forever now I believe that it's talking of this day of of of Babylon of of of the age of course we know that the nation Babylon is long gone but that Spirit has carried on to where in Revelation it talks of mystery Babylon so so it it's uh uh what the nation was in the Old Testament all of its traits and its characteristics have been carried over in the New Testament but so so it's it's actually even though it doesn't exist as a nation as it did in the Old Testament is still existing in this in this age and so that God has promising that that they they're not going to take a stone of thee and and bring it a Cornerstone and build something else and and they're not going to uh uh take the stone for a foundation No all he said you're going to be desolate forever but but this destroying Mountain this power will be literally destroyed everything about it will be totally gone now notice he called it a destroying mountain now when I read that scripture it reminded me of the scripture in Zechariah 4:7 where God says who art thou oh great Mountain before zere reable Thou shalt become a plain and and of course we know the ministry of zerubabel if you read zerubabel go listen to the ministry of Grace or the message of Grace brother Braham talks about it but he talks about it in several places but but I believe that that Ministry this is prophetic of today in this age and and brother bram's Ministry actually fits this prophecy of zerubba amen and the ministry of how that he would set forth The Headstone amen he would not lay the Cornerstone that's been laid but he would Now set The Headstone up on the building and it's at that time that this mountain this great Mountain which which which uh uh uh uh to me fits with this scripture uh of Jeremiah calling it a destroying Mountain a man is in and then you look at even Daniel uh Daniel sees it as an image and there's a stone rolling down amen it's described in several ways but but in in when it's all said and done it's in this age that that kingdom is destroyed that Babylonian power that Babylonian Kingdom that Babylonian influence inspiration character whatever you want to call it it's destroyed utterly Amen in this age amen and and it it is to be destroyed when according to Daniel it's destroyed when the stone coming and rolling down the mountain which is the coming of the head stone Jesus Christ that's Jesus Christ can you say Amen you're putting all these scriptures together then you realize that at the revealing of the son of man that's that's when this all takes place is is uh the destroying of this and and and every nation is going to fall every kingdom is going to fall but but you know Jesus Christ is the stone do you believe that it is written you know uh where I believe it's Paul or Peter said the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner it's The Headstone amen and and we know that in Colossians 1:18 Paul in speaking of Christ said is the head of the body the church ain't that right amen so uh uh he is the word therefore the word of God is The Headstone that comes to the body the church and and uh and and I hope it making a little sense to you but the seventh angel of Revelations 10:7 who is a prophet uh is on Earth at the time of this coming headstone amen and it scripture after scripture speaks you realize that brother random said there's more scriptures that talk of this coming than the first coming there's more scriptures that talk about you and your place your position of and and and and everything that it does about anything else of of of the first coming of Christ it's it's really amazing but but we find that the word uh uh comes to the prophet and so the seventh angel is the prophet that God promised to send in Malachi 4 and his ministry is going to affect everything his ministry it it has affected the world I I look look look at the world falling apart there's a there's a reason for it why did is why did Egypt fall apart because God sent a message of Deliverance can you say amen and and and the power that Egypt had over God's people no longer it was broken because there was a prophet stood with the message of Deliverance Let My People Go ain't that right and that message was to bring them people out of Egypt and whatever Egypt had and whatever Glory Egypt was was no more it it it it it fell upon apart and this world is falling apart this nation is falling apart the Babylonian system is falling apart denominations are falling apart world powers are falling apart uh uh uh men's minds are falling apart genius intellectuals are falling apart everything is falling apart why because it's time for deliverance it's time for deliverance of all things for there was a mighty angel that stood on the earth and said time shall be no more time of intellectual shall be no more time of of a politics shall be no more time of denomination shall be no more time of corruption shall be no more everything is changing why there is a city that's coming there is a a a God's kingdom is coming it's time for the people of God to come out of the corruption come out of Babylon come out of all the systems and dogmas and and the control of men come back to being sons of God and not only in your faith not only in your mind not only as as in your position but this whole vile body is going to be changed amen sickness and death and sin and all of that has lost its hold it's losing its hold because God sent a message of Deliverance it's in a message of Deliverance and and it's all coming to not everything that's not part of God's kingdom is falling apart and so the ministry of brother brandom which we believe to be the the ministry of Malachi 4 the seventh angel messenger and and it's it it his ministry was to turn our hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers not Pentecostal age Pentecostal fathers of of of uh the the day of Pentecost and and so this is the time that we uh that God has set for a time of Deliverance to be delivered from Babylon we have received the message of Deliverance in this last stage it is the last message to come is the last message I know other men have risen up trying to come up with their message but this is the last message to the elect and I will say it's the last message that this world will ever receive it's the last sign it's the last of everything can you say man to turn this message down is is to to walk away from Mercy it's true so now we are we are not to fear in this age amen men's hearts are failing for fear people don't know what to do uncertain about the political future right and if you're putting your faith in politics if you're any any in in any way you you've missed it am if you're putting your faith in Donald Trump or any Republican as though they're the Savior that's going to make your life better you've missed the bolt it's the message of the hour there's no future in politics there is no future in religion there is absolutely no future in education there is no future in in in science or whatever you want to call it it's all falling apart can you say Amen your only future is to get into the message of the hour your your only future is to take what God has provided by the message of the hour the token has been provided in this age for it was the message of the hour that loosed the Holy Spirit remember the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years to Prophet it but it is to be loed in the evening time by this evening time message and brother brandham showed us that the holy spirit for this age is the token life amen and that is what has been released to us so we are not to fear for the power of God that's in this message is destroying our enemy to where we shall see him no more the enemy is not people the enemy is Satan himself that is influencing people amen and and these things so now if you noce Micah I believe that's Micah uh 4 and10 being pain and labor to bring forth oh Daughter of Zion like a woman in travail for now shalt thou go forth out of the city and thou shalt dwell in the field and thou shalt go even to Babylon there there shalt thou be delivered there the Lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies can you say Amen so this is what we're seeing is a deliverance from from B Babylon and and from the hand of her now Babylon what is Babylon it's a state of confusion we don't look at Babylon just it as a natural Nation but we look at babyon what Babylon truly means it's it's confusion a state of disorder or disturbance now we know that God is not the founder of Babylon never was even in the old Testament uh for he's not the author of confusion and and uh uh according to scripture confusion is the direct result of sin or unbelief now notice Daniel 9 and7 oh Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as at this day to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and unto all Israel that are near here and that are far off uh through all the the countries whether thou H thou Hast driven them because of their transp trespass that they have trespassed against thee see so confusion has come be to them because of transgression trespassing against God oh Lord to us belongeth confusion of fa to our Kings to our princes and to our father others because we have sinned against thee ain't that right so when a man disbelieves God's word because that's what the sin is is unbelief when a man disbelieves God's word turn God's word down what does he do he automatically goes into confusion that's why this nation is in confusion of today because they turn down the message of the hour any time God's revealed word Vindicated word is turned down the people go in into utter confusion can you sayen this is exactly what Eve done she she had God's word lived by God's word then she listened to that Serpent of course Satan incarnated himself in that Serpent and began to talk through that serpent to Eve he talked to her the word quoted God's word verb badum until he got one he left one word out ain't that right amen one word and she became confused because she listened to him and brother Brown said she she believed all one every promise but got confused on one Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever ain't that right so when we don't take God's word and believe it holy holy then you come into a state of confusion to what you don't know to where you become you don't know if it's really right or wrong you start listening to this you start listening to that well but but you know and and then all of a sudden people start discrediting the message they start discrediting the messenger well he was man and he missed it here he missed it there well I I can believe well then you start becoming your own absolute and then you throw yourself into confusion to where you don't know the government sounds good the neighbor sounds right uh uh this preacher sounds right this denomination sounds right and before you know it you're back into a state of confusion you don't know what to do can you say amen and the point was is to get us out of Babylon to call us out of this confusion and if we're going to come out of confusion you've got to have an absolute amen now if you notice James 3:16 for where envying and strife is notice that where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil word work where evil and strife is now so I look this word up Envy envying because if there's envying there's confusion so I looked up this word envying it means jealousy indignation so now we can go back it was Cain that became jealous of his brother Cain because of his jealousy refused to accept the word the revealed word that came to Abel ain't that right see the carnal always gets jealous of the spiritual the fundamental Believers always get jealous of the Believers who had the supernatural moving among them and and and and Moab of the Old Testament is another prime example of how they got jealous of their Brethren they were fundamental believers they done everything they had the same altars the same number the same sacrific the same everything even they had a prophet among them but not Vindicated of course and and and approved him to be a false prophet but nonetheless they got jealous of the Brethren of Israel because they had a pillar of fire they had a mercy seat they were Vindicated of God and they became jealous and in the end it brought confusion among Israel right because Israel joined themselves up with them right see and so uh uh we're you know we're we're did Cain get his nature to be jealous brother BR said well that come from his father Satan and and then you look what Satan was in the beginning his his name was actually Lucifer and and you realize that he had the he had he he was he was next to God he had he was co-workers with God he could not create but he was co-workers with God he he set just I mean there was there was God Satan and then it it drifted all the way down angels and and positions and all that but Satan was right here next to God and and he was a beautiful angel he he had it all ain't that right and but what happened he got jealous jealous ining jealous of God and and and and what did it brought confusion to where he was able to draw 2/3 of the angels I think it was 2/3 or a third one he drew Angels under his Gathering through jealousy everything it was one worship it was everybody was satisfied God was God yeah but then jealousy arose and brought envying in heaven right amen come on now Prophet said he wanted a brighter and a better and prettier Kingdom than what God had so envying where envying and strife is there is confusion that's right now I looked up the word strife it means contention a desire to put oneself forward Rebellion yeah so so brother Bram said see Disobedience means Rebellion yeah brother Bram talks about or or Paul I believe uh uh in the Bible talks about children of Disobedience children of rebellion and it all goes back Strife so so these things causes confusion if if it would be nice if if if if it was just one Doctrine One Faith one belief one God one Lord and and and and truly there is but why does why do we we have more than one God why do they teach that why why do they teach more than just one doctrines and and and why why do we have it's confusion and it all stems from Rebellion jealousy Rebellion Strife they can't let God be God and just rule that's right so they are rebellious children of strife children of disobedience and brother Bram said what are they rebelling against they're rebelling against the revealed word of God and what does that do brings confusion amen that's right brother BR said see Cain rebelled against Abel's revealed Revelation that was Vindicated of God that it was righteous right another place he said see the Pharisees with their own denominational knowledge of what the word of God was selected handpicked men rebelled against the Vindicated word of God made manifest for the day Jesus Christ and they killed him see if they would have just let Jesus say I am the word I am the truth the way and the life and let God vindicate that which God did everybody could have believed it see but oh no we ain't going to do that he's not part of us he's teaching something contrary than what we taught instead of just humbling themselves saying God's Vindicated his message they said oh no and they taught the people not to believe that and then they crucified him it brought confusion among the people right it's always that way we hear about Noah building the ark that's you know but then the prophet says there was other people building arcs there was other people building boats why didn't they just just do what they were doing just just continue on and just believe Noah's message but they they got jealous they and it ca strife and before you know what Disobedience and then they start working among the people confusion don't believe that old oh oh fogy you know and and and and and then they started questioning the message oh do you have proof it's going to rain we've never we've got all of our technology to show that it'll never rain see and they were confusing the people right come on now that's right they brought confusion amen so where there is rebellion and strife contention you will always find confusion now if you look 1 Samuel 15:23 it says Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry so if you study history you'll find out that both Witchcraft and idolatry was practiced in Babylon so that would tell us that a man doesn't have to literally practice Witchcraft and idolatry to be in Babylon just being rebellious against the revealed word of God and being stubborn which I looked up the word stubborn it's a display of pushing against arrogance fighting against it makes you part of Babylon that's right just to fight against the revealed word of God just to rebel against the word of God and say well I don't have to listen to that I ain't doing that and and then you you you fight against it you're just part of Babylon because it's the same thing as witchcraft it's the same sin as witchcraft and idolatry amen so envying Rebellion Strife contention against the revealed word of God breeds confusion and every evil work so then we can see that Babylon comes from the devil he is the one who desired in the beginning to put himself forward against God's revealed provided way because of his jealousy so therefore he's the author of confusion notice Isa Isaiah 14 and12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did US weak in the Nations for thou has said it in thine heart God never told him he said it in his heart he put himself in in a position that God never would put himself in put him in because he can't be it but he says I I thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the sons of God or stars of God Sons of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high amen I will be so he he's the one that sets himself forward and of course if he's going to be like the most high God then he's got to have a following he's got to have a drawing and so this has been his whole motive in on the earth is to have a following now we all know that God had a son Adam but Satan could not have a son but but he's got to do what God does so he cannot create a son like God did so the only thing he could do was to Incarnate himself in the serpent which was next to man the Bible says he walked he had legs he talked he was the most subtle of all Beast smart shrewd beautiful yeah Satan incarnated himself and he convinced and we all know how he became s Cain was his son through a sex act and and Satan was able to come through that direction amen and this is how he's been able to influence Mankind and all this time he's been able he's been after he's been after worship to take all the worship from God the true God and EST Lish his own self his own kingdom his own ways his own garden his Eden all these things right because he's the one that set himself forward and any man any woman boy girl that sets themsel as the authority above God's word is inspired of that Spirit Cain did it Cain did it Cain offered something that he thought would be good but when God did not accept it he got upset and instead of humbling himself amen and saying K Abel's right I see God Vindicated that sacrifice so I'm going to and God God gave him that AB offer God offered it said will you just not do what your your brother did if you just do it I'll accept it that's right oh no he couldn't do that think about that's coming in line with God's revelation I ain't gonna do that and so he slew yeah the righteous so the original name for Babylon was Babel and its origin is found in Genesis as we talked about last Sunday I believe it was founded by Kush and uh the son of ham but it was Nimrod the son of kush Noah's grandson that brought the kingdom of Babylon Babel to power and magnificence and the whole point of the building of the Tower of Babel uh which again was in Genesis there was to build a man-made Earthly Dominion apart from God Dominion apart from God power apart from God right and a government apart from God all these things anything apart from God and so the Bible states that Nimrod was a mighty one in the Earth in other words he was a man of influence the word Nimrod means to take to steal Rebel it means a tyrant and this is exactly nimrod's character his nature he's the one that challenged questioned the supremacy of God he was the Bible called him a mighty warrior or Hunter uh uh a mighty Hunter a warrior before the Lord one writer says that signified he was in opposition of the Lord a warrior in opposition of God so his his his whole motive you know and and and to oppose anything of God and and so that was his nature his character that's the way he was built so before Babel the whole earth was of one language of one speech it was also the entire our Earth had only one religion as as we talked about last Sunday the people believed in one God Supreme Eternal invisible who by the word of his mouth spoke all things into existence and that in his character he was loving good and just this was what all people believed of any religion that that people had it was just one religion and that was God was God he was Supreme he was the one that created heaven and earth they all believed in that no other God nothing it was only one God ain't that right but then Nimrod come see we being inspired of the devil set out to accomplish three things to build a strong Nation to propagate his own religion and to make a name for himself and he was successful at doing that you see when when people be be come anointed of Satan then what happens they become inspired to seek and to do something outside of what God has provided for them and I I I hope I'm making some sense to you just speaking of what Babylon and what inspired Babylon it was it was established to do something outside of God's provided way amen and this is also how mystery Babylon got started but Nimrod was known for strength and Ambitions he sought power and control Beyond human limits his his accomplishments were so Monumental that the kingdom of Babylon was called the head of gold amongst all World governments right and he built a super Tower and a super religion the prophet said so Babylon is actually where idolatry began the confusion of religion began at Babylon Babel uh uh it was there that s corrupted the minds and heart of men to where they rejected the truth and it became the seat of idolatry so so in in in in other words uh uh the people now began to see that that there's more than one God there's more than one way of worship there's more uh uh than than all these things just like they're saying today that there's more more than one way to get to heaven and and on and on and on there's more than one just God accepts all kinds of Lifestyles and and and things like that as as you know it's all confusion and this is this is what this is what Nimrod done by propagating his own religion and his own ways and idolatry it just brought confusion hello it's true it's the basis of Babel is Babylon is is the basis for every system of idolatry and the theme of Mythology though the names of the Gods differ in various sections of the land according to the language of the people and then Babylon Babel uh the land of the childes calans whatever it became the oppressor it became the oppressor it become a dictator and I read this the other day and thought it went with what brother brandham taught it and and uh according to what the ancient historians recorded Nimrod was deified as a father of the Gods and was given the title of emancipator deliverer of mankind rebelling against the authority of Heaven men worshiped Pagan deities the name zeroster means seed of a woman this is an illusion to Genesis 3:15 in the a in this ancient religion see much of pagan mythology traces its historical origin back to Genesis 11 Babel and Nimrod in rebellious uh Pagan religion man's idea becomes the standard of Truth man decides to be his own deliverer def deifies himself and seeks to restore Paradise through Empire Building yeah Nimrod is not only a founder of Empire building and Rebellion but he also founded false Worship in a one World religious culture so this is historians talking of these things of of what Nimrod was and what how all this started at Babylon but not only that it was a forced religion he not only propagated his religion but now it became a forced religion brother Braham said it was a forced Unity that represented by groups of people at Babylon see we want to have Unity so how are they going to do it force people to come together force people in one worship force people can you say Amen it's all inspiration of the devil amen see and so if you know uh it's like uh that started at Babel but then you you find out years later in Babylon the king Reser raises uh erects an image brother Brown said it was a holy image a a the image of a holy man and and all Babylon was required uh uh uh captives and and citizens uh were were required to to to bow down to this worship uh this Idol of worship see it was a forced worship and those who did not do it we find out was thrown into the fiery furnace right see and and so they they were persecuted for not doing that it was also in Babylon that uh that everybody was for to pray a uh to another God outside of the one true God and Daniel refused to do it and he was thrown in the Lion's then for it it was a forced worship a ain't that right see so then babyon brother Bram said Babylon is the only type of our modern organized religion right amen if you want to find a type for it it's Babylon and it's a forced Unity so brother Ram says it was founded by Nimrod and a forced Unity among religious people and that's what the Creeds and our denominations do today it's a force Unity you either belong to this or you're out I I just speaking of this uh the Methodist Church um yeah probably should have said that but a man uh was talking to me the other day about it and and how he belonged belongs to it and just here uh in town uh you know they they have decided to vote in uh way everybody I guess seems to be going in in homosexual and and and the lifestyle of that way and they've AC the church denomination has accepted that well he and several others have withstood that and said no we're not going to be a part of it and they kicked him out don't him you're not welcome here at this church and and he says I I can't even go I can't even walk in that building anymore because I've disagreed with them and they they they won't let us in we don't know where to go that's right but see it's a force Unity among religious people and that's what Creeds and are denominations do today forced Unity you either belong to this or you're out and we're coming now and we can see to a forcing all in this age they're going to force all into one great Unity but he said that but that is a man mechanical made device by a man and it cannot stand it is not God's will it is not God's program no matter how people try to say it is it isn't it can't be it's just impossible for it to be God wouldn't put his name in such a thing as that that denies his word how can God live in something that denies his own word right what is what is communism we got communism and everybody talking about communism everybody worried about communism Russia China I think and different ones are communists what is communist it's a force Unity that's that's that's what it is and and I looked it up communism it's a system in which goods are owned in common and are available to all as needed see so everybody shares equal everybody see it's it's you know it's a theory advocating elimination of private property a system in which goods are owned in common and are available to all as needed a theory advocating elimination of private property so what yours is mine what's mine is yours come on it's equal so if you got more money than I've got brother Doug that's wrong you shouldn't have that so you can't say that it's your $10,000 that's my $10,000 too see it's a force something amen ain't that right now communism though is actually a a perversion of what they had in the days of Acts that's right it's it's it's a look acts 2:43 and fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles and they all and all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and part of them to all men as every man had need right right that's right acts 4:30 and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one Soul neither said any of them that ought uh that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common so you know what brother Brown says Pentecost had real communism Pentecost but it was under the authority of God it was the power of God it wasn't a Force com thing it wasn't a force Unity see man is trying to bring that about out apart from God apart from the power of God yeah yeah hello they're trying to bring a love a human love and force everybody into this that you accept it all but we find out it don't work cuz look what they're doing now you got to love homosexual you got to accept everybody but don't but look at them them same people are out on the streets fighting against Jews because it doesn't work so they want to shut us down from preaching against the sin that you got to just love everybody and if you don't love according to what they say it's hate but then they'll go out on the streets burn buildings and burn this and because it won't work the only thing that brings people truly together is the power of God and that's what happened at Pentecost amen can you say Amen so brother Brandon said that the communism that Rush and China and all these other countries have is a false Pentecost see so so he says brother Brown talking about Russia they're trying to force all men into communism where every man has everything commonly see uh the Devils come around and got into that into the world and made a political power to force man to that can you say Amen trust me it's it's it's coming yeah a political power to force men into a Unity that's what Nimrod started with but God had a Unity right but Nimrod under the inspiration of Satan started his own kingdom Babel Babylon come on now and then he's going to force everybody to his Unity his religion I don't know but see Pentecost produced it this Unity by the power of God coming into the people now if you look at it when the Catholic Church rose up which is Mystery babblin it's it's we all know it's part of it all it's it's trying to make everyone become Catholic brother brah said the Protestant church under the Federation of churches the World Council of churches is trying to force all the little churches out and require everyone to belong to the union of churches it's just a work of the devil everybody got to belong can you sayen but it ain't going to last because it's under a man-made program right I want to say it to you man has nothing to do with your salvation man should have nothing to do with your convictions man has nothing to do with your calling it isn't that we make preachers it's God calls them preachers we can't ordain preachers and and just because we pray over a man you know that makes him a preacher God has to make him a preacher God has to make you a Christian God has to unite the hearts can you say man man has nothing to do with you belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ you're born into this body by one spirit and that's his Spirit no National Force can make you that way right you believe it amen Acts 2:47 says the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved John 6:44 no man can come to me except the Father which ha uh has sent me draw him Romans 9:16 so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it or complete it until the day of Jesus Christ can you say Amen brother R says God does not force man to do anything you do it on your own free will he can warn you throw a barricade across your path but you walk your own self with your own decision in his presence to make him your savior but Satan has perverted God's plan to his own plan and wants to force everything that's what legalism is all about is to make people Christians you legalism don't make people Christians Force everybody to dress long you know long sleeves long skirts long hair and what it does it becomes a force if the spirit of God can't put it in you nothing will as brother Bram said I've you know you he said I've seen you know women long hair long skirts that has a temper like a blade saw or whatever buzz buzz saw you know it's it's it's because it's not a force of of worship it's not a force of unity it's God's power God's spirit dealing on the individual's lives but see Babel brought on a forced worship it was the first organization ever started brother Bram said this this great Babylon was just a false Gathering it was a false coming together and notice another place what he says in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the word just as we showed you that the that Antichrist means anti- word so these false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear they say if the people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow see they are false prophets for a true Prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ he won't tell the people to fear Him or what he says but to fear what the word says can you say Amen as we get ready to close now the city if you look notice the city of Babel the city was 120 Mi around each side was 30 mi from wall to wall it was it was surrounded by a wall 30 mi from wall to wall the city the walls were 80 ft High 40 ft wide across the top it had streets that were 200 ft wide the gates of the city were made out of brass and right in the center of that city was the [Music] throne so and no matter what gate you entered it had different Gates but what no matter what gate you entered every street LED right to the throne that was in the in in the city see all roads pointed to the throne by the Throne uh you know and I'm getting this from uh the church age book uh but by the throne flowed the river Euphrates with uh the Tigris there and it watered the whole uh uh shinar Valley and in the city there was swinging Gardens and and that hung around the walls and brother brand said what the city was it was a type of the great Celestial city of God yeah and that anything that Satan does it's always a perversion of what God has and so this city was what was was a perversion of actually the city that is promised to come see it's a perversion of God City it and and and and it's just like this Mortal life is a perversion of eternal life that's that's just what it is ain't that right see so uh uh so then then nimrod caused all the other cities to pay tribute to this one city which is again a perversion of the new Eternal City to come for Revelations 21:24 and the nations of them which are saved walk uh shall walk in the light of it the the city the Heavenly City and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall be no night there and they shall bring the glory and honor of the Nations into it in other words they're going to pay tribute to the city but it ain't a force but here now under the devil would pervert what God's start got and and and the plans of God and he would raise up his own City and would cause by force all the nations to pay tribute to it a perversion can you say amen amen so what is Mr Babylon and we'll get more into it the Lord willing but it's a perversion of what God has it's a perverted Church a perverted Unity a perverted worship a perverted Pentecost and it's brought nothing but Mass confusion can you say Amen you know as we said last Sunday that when God started the church uh there on the day of Pentecost it was a Pentecostal Church there was only one Faith one Lord one baptism one Doctrine one church and and so then then anything that man does apart from God it it always brings confusion it breeds confusion and and and so then then you have to ask here we are Seven Ages later Church ages how how how why do we have the confusion if it started out with one Lord one baptism One Faith one Doctrine one church and and and one Spirit baptizing the people into the church how how do we end up with all these other stuff it's it's because it's brought confusion man somewhere got away from the word of God and started his own thing and that's how Mr babblin has started it's under the Same Spirit same inspiration same motive same everything can you say amen that's exactly right and if you look Revel 62 and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat upon the throne or sat set up sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer everybody thought this was was Christ even brother Brown said he thought it was Christ until the seal became open and then he realized this was Satan riding on a white horse he was an impostor acting as though he was Christ looking as though he was Christ coming into the church innocent yeah can you say amen and yet it was an antichrist spirit and Antichrist means against Christ against the word ain't that right and and so re remember in the first church age there was a certain thing that got started uh uh in the church age that the Holy Spirit was against and and Revelations 2:6 God says but this that this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nickan which I also hate see so so that thing started in the first church age 3ome years or just a little bit after the day of Pentecost here comes another Spirit riding in which was the Deeds of the nicians remember niiko means to conquer yeah Ley see means the church the Ley nians conquer the Ley conquer the church take the Holy Spirit out of the church and give it all to one holy man and let him be the boss of it all is that what Nimrod began he began to be the superior one father of the Gods so so then leoty means the church so they were trying to overthrow God's true church come on and to do that was to bring confusion to divide to to conquer right amen ain't that right yes so notice the people were being subjected somehow in a way the prophet said that was absolutely contrary to the word of God they were trying to take the church where God had pastors and the spirit of God moving by gifts in the Church of the Living God and they were having a Doctrine start that they were going to have some priests Bishops popes and so forth see it was not in God's plan but that began to creep into the church you see on the day of Pentecost God came into the church himself to operate it amen and we find out that the book of Acts you know they on on if you look at your book The the title is the Acts of the Apostles brother Brown that wasn't the Acts of the Apostles he said it should be written the acts of the Holy Spirit right it was Christ in the apostles performing The Works can you say amen he gave them power to become sons of God he's the one that added to the church daily he directed The People where to go and what to do he was the one that translated Philip from one place to another place he was the one who raised Paul from the dead he was the one who brought the people under conviction by his very power it was him in the church him operating in the church but then Here Comes This Spirit of antichrist work working in the church to take the Holy Spirit out and if you notice the Apostle Paul did his best to warn the people of this Acts 20 and 29 he said I know this that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock notice this Grievious woles will come in among you not sparing the flock how is this he's going to bring confusion in that's right amen also of your own selves of your own selves amen not not heathens of the Romans and and and whatever but of your own in the in amongst you shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them remember all people after the day of Pentecost One Faith one Lord one baptism one Spirit one Unity God working among them but now people will rise up among them drawing disciples after them is that not what Satan done in the in heaven yeah to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears see so so then then if you notice the true church has always had to discern what spirit is working among them always it's been that way All Through the Ages and Paul was telling them discern because there's men among you that's going to rise up and it's going to break that Unity it's going to bring division because they're jealous and strife and they're they're putting themselves forward above the word of God that that I have brought unto you that God has done on the day of Pentecost and they're going to draw disciples under themselves they're going to break that Unity can you say Amen even Jesus said in Matthew 7:15 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are raving wolves see brother briam said the wolves that Paul was speaking of were the Deeds of the nians yes and in the first church age and I'm getting ready close but in the first church age it was called the Deeds the deed of the nicians what were they doing they were just kind of entertaining the thought you know maybe having people over for supper and and and as they're having supper throw out a little question what do you think about if we do it this way what what what what what do you think if we just you know you know don't don't you think that maybe maybe that the apostles are just acting a little too asserting themselves maybe Paul's acting like he's a big wig or something I I mean I don't know I'm just asking you if you feel that way you know and and here have some more mashed potatoes you know and and and it's just little tidbit praise God I'm just anxious for church tonight Paul's going to be preaching bless the lord well he just slandered Paul yeah he just slandered the preachers yeah but oh bless the Lord we're going to have a good time but they just putting in a little tidbit just like the serpent did with Eve oh you think God really meant that come on now oh God's a loving God you know what I mean and and they were introducing things to the people right see instead of Shing the up one faith and inuring up they started questioning just so little questions W you think brother Brandon really meant it that way I mean can you have you ever found it in the word of God that it was that way or not I mean of course everybody else says that he's kind of wrong I mean aren't we supposed to believe the Bible after all I I mean I don't know you know I mean I'm just asking you maybe you could you know praise God we're message Believers aren't we but it was just little tidbits here Deeds of the nicians see and so they were entertaining that idea planting thoughts in the people's minds that would listen to them men of influence men that had good Charisma you know yeah these days they get people to feel sorry for them oh I'm being such attacked I just they they they they just don't see and and they're preaching against me all the time and and people start feeling oh bless your heart so they win people over by sympathy but then if you notice the second Church age it become the doctrine amen of the nicians now it had crept into the church enough to where now ministers are standing behind the pulpit and are teaching it as Doctrine this is the way it's want to be right right see so they start teaching it now exerting it be not just behind in the kitchen table and not just in the secret but now they're coming in and starting to present it to the people and so it became the doctrine of the nickan but notice by the time the Third Church age came it become a persecution yeah that if you don't believe the way we believe it you'll die now brother br brother Brown says the first church age was still Pentecost and the Pentecostal church was quite a large church at the beginning with Pentecostal power but they had a denominational Spirit come among them trying to dominate the church which was called the Deeds of the nicians then it come to the second Church age it was denomination and Pentecost was being more squeezed out formalism form worship formal this everything that God started at the day of Pentecost started being pushed out the door just a little bit and now it becomes stronger in the second Church age to where the Prophet said by the time the Third Church age came around Pentecost was almost squeezed out I see how Satan does that so subtly mystery Babylon of course the Third Church age was the age that when Nia uh Council took place and this is when the colonel brother Brown said the colonel nicians had overpowered the Pentecostal groups and he said when I say Pentecost that doesn't mean this organization of the day that we're living in that's just as guilty as the rest of them but I mean the real Pentecostal the real spirit of God with the original Doctrine with the original blessings with the original names with the original exactly the way it began at the beginning like it went through the Bible can you say Amen if the musicians Will Come Bless the Lord Jesus another place he said so way back there in the early church a very short period after Pentecost the false Vine that Babylonian Vine Antichrist see that false Vine got to intertwine itself around the True Vine and we find the Deeds of the nicians and that spirit is going to be found fighting the True Vine until it is destroyed by God can you say amen amen that spirit will be destroyed amen but until then it's going to fight your faith it's going to fight your joy it's going to fight everything about you amen it's it's it's it's just his that's can you say Amen but if you notice that Antichrist Spirit could not come into the church without meeting resistance and that's what I really liked about it Revelations 2:1 it says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy Works thy labor thy patience and how thou can cannot bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and not and has found them Liars The Prophet said God and the church agreed upon one thing that they hated the Deeds of the nicians the True Vine the True Vine the true church that was in the E Ephesian Church age Ephesian Church they hated the Deeds of the nicians and they resisted that Spirit just like the the tribe of Shem they resisted that Spirit of nimrod that was was trying to bring confusion they resisted that teaching they resisted that doctrine that he was trying to put in upon the people even though they were few and it seemed like the world that Nimrod won the world over his religion spread throughout the world but there was still a people that would resist that [Music] spirit and there that true elect that true church found them they tried that spirit and found them to be Liars brother Braham said how do they know that they were Liars because they weren't quoting with the word of God he says if a man says the days of Miracles is passed that man is a liar for the Bible says that Jes it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if a man says that you've got to be baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost using titles that man is a liar we could go on and on and on if that man stands and tells you it's okay for you women to wear your makeup that man's a liar tells you that you can just live any old ungodly way that man's a liar can you say Amen why amen how do you know because he's not quoting with the word of God Peter said here repent and be baptized every one of you for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost see so anything they found them to be Liars because they were teaching against the word of God can you say Amen brother brandom says why why do these false prophets come against the true prophet and discredit his teachings why do they do that it's because they're run and true to form as did their forefathers when they with stood the prophet Micaiah uh uh in the days of Arab there was 400 prophets false prophets 400 of them against one true prophet and all them 400 prophets were saying the same thing they agreed upon same thing and they were saying the same thing until they got the people confused as to which is right because it looked like the majority was right surely 400 of them were saying the same thing surely they got to be right here's that old one one man saying totally different than what these 400 prophets amen and so they started they they began to get confused just like it was when them 10 spies against the two spies and the people got confused upon the promises of God they all believed the the majority can you say Amen brother Braham says see they were all of them were saying the same thing till they fooled the people but one Prophet just one was right and all the rest was wrong because God had committed the Revelation to him only one can you say Amen prise the Lord then he says this only the elect can you say that with me only the elect will not be deceived only the elect why brother briam said cuz they are f fill with the spirit of God and are led by him he said there isn't any man can fool you Paul could not fool any elect had he been wrong and in that first church age the elect there could not be fooled for they tried the false Apostles and Prophets and found them to be liars and put them out Hallelujah his sheep hear his voice and they follow him aren't you glad that there's been a Voice of Truth in this age that can bring you out of Babylon that you can believe it with all of your heart and know that it's thus sayith the Lord don't have to question it don't
