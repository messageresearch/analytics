[17:26] Heavenly Father, what a joy it is to be

[17:31] saved us for divine purpose. Lord, we
[17:34] sing the song, our hope, my hope is in
[17:36] the Lord and forever more. Lord, I'm
[17:39] just thinking back 45 years or so, you
[17:42] know, when we were in denominations and
[17:45] we heard the word of the Lord and as the
[17:47] prophet God said, we heard the truth of
[17:48] this hour. We heard from our theophy and
[17:50] it spoke to me and Lord, you give us a
[17:52] revelation and I saw my name written
[17:54] there and I came to the word when that
[17:56] light struck that seed and how thankful
[17:58] I've been ever since. Lord, it's never
[18:00] been a a time that has grown grown uh
[18:03] cold or common or or just a a lukewarm
[18:07] feeling, but we're just so happy all of
[18:09] these years, Lord, to be able to serve
[18:11] you. And thank you for this great end
[18:13] time message, what it means to us. Lord,
[18:14] I'm I'm thankful that we was called out
[18:17] according to Revelations 18:4. We pray
[18:19] for Lord, even the the young people that
[18:21] was raised in the message. It's just
[18:23] very hard for them to to to realize that
[18:26] eagle scream sometimes because they was
[18:28] raised in it just like raised in a
[18:29] denominational church. But God helped
[18:31] them each one of them to realize and
[18:34] recognize Lord. This is this is a
[18:36] separation. Lord, this is a a different
[18:38] day, a different dispensation. It's a a
[18:40] truth. Lord, it's like has never been
[18:42] given back in denominational ages. A
[18:44] complete revelation of Jesus Christ. All
[18:47] been restored. You saved the best for
[18:49] last. Well, Lord, each one of the people
[18:52] that brother uh Daniel mentioned, I pray
[18:54] that you would touch each one of those.
[18:56] We're thankful that you've helped those
[18:58] who had the uh surgeries in their their
[19:00] knees. Just each one of those, oh God,
[19:03] how thankful we are. We we thank you how
[19:05] you use doctors use medicine, you heal
[19:07] by music, but all healing comes from
[19:09] almighty God. You build the tissue. They
[19:12] can set a bone, but only God can build
[19:14] the tissue. Lord, bless the word of the
[19:16] Lord. It comes tonight, Lord. I thank
[19:18] for I think you mentioned brother Joe's
[19:20] sister-in-law touch her Lord to raise

[31:57] Um he was in Tennessee. I I would assume
[32:01] maybe around Pigeon Forge or whatever. I
[32:04] don't know, but uh they were trying to
[32:07] get him into surgery as of this morning.
[32:09] I believe that's when I got the uh the
[32:14] uh text. Um and um so they were either
[32:19] trying to get him to Knoxville or fly
[32:21] him here to Rono. Uh what whichever
[32:26] hospital could get start the operation
[32:30] the soonest. And um so I I have not
[32:34] heard anymore um
[32:38] um uh
[32:39] &gt;&gt; still
[32:46] in surgery.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Okay. So not into not in surgery yet,
[32:50] but trying to get him. So anyway, I I'm
[32:54] I'm sure they would appreciate the
[32:55] prayers and um you know, our life is
[32:59] just but a vapor and uh we certainly
[33:03] need God.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; And uh to help us out and and I I know
[33:08] they they need the Lord, you know, need
[33:11] us to be praying for this situation. Um,
[33:15] also, brother Andrew um, Glover
[33:20] u had just asked us to pray for he's got
[33:24] an unspoken prayer request and asked if
[33:28] we would just pray uh, for this need.
[33:31] And so let's just go into the Lord in
[33:34] prayer and um, we'll ask him to help us
[33:38] tonight as well. Father,
[33:42] we know prayer has been lifted up
[33:45] already this evening.
[33:47] And Lord, these requests that I have
[33:51] mentioned, Lord, Brother Mark's mom,
[33:55] Lord, I know that if it was my mother in
[33:58] this situation, Lord, I would certainly
[34:01] want the church to pray.
[34:04] Father, I pray Lord that you would just
[34:07] go to where she's at and touch her.
[34:11] Father, I just Lord, I don't know what
[34:15] all is going on, but she's weak, Father.
[34:19] And Lord, just needing a touch from you.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; I pray God that you would do it, Lord,
[34:26] tonight, Father. Work a miracle. And
[34:29] &gt;&gt; yes, Jesus. You see, brother Johnny,
[34:31] Lord, in this need that he's in, Father,
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, we we've got to have you. And
[34:39] Lord, Brother Johnny need you tonight,
[34:42] Father, that you would just uh come,
[34:44] Father. You You can do the operation
[34:47] yourself.
[34:48] There there's nothing too hard for you,
[34:51] Father. And may this blood clot dissolve
[34:54] that's in his brain, Father. and may he
[34:58] get total use, Lord, out of this hand
[35:01] and whatever else is ailing him. I I
[35:05] pray that you'd bring him out of that
[35:06] hospital, Father, Lord, as a testimony
[35:11] of your miraculous power. Father, we're
[35:15] dependent on you. And Lord, we we're
[35:18] asking that you would touch Brother
[35:19] Andrew and the situation, Lord, that
[35:22] he's facing. And I pray, Father, that
[35:25] you would meet the need. Go before him,
[35:28] Lord. Uh may the angel of the covenant
[35:31] go before, Father, and meet the need.
[35:35] Fight the battle, Lord. Father, we just
[35:38] commit uh leaving this into your hands,
[35:41] committing it to you. We pray, Father,
[35:44] that you would move tonight, Lord, as
[35:46] you know that we need you, Lord, and
[35:49] more now than we ever have before.
[35:52] Father, may the words of life come
[35:55] forth, and may I yield myself to thee,
[35:58] Lord, and may the people, Father, uh uh
[36:02] yield themselves, Lord, and open their
[36:04] hearts, and any spirit that would try to
[36:07] bind this service, I pray, Lord, that
[36:10] you would just defeat the enemy. We ask
[36:13] it, Father, and we just believe it in
[36:16] Jesus Christ's name. And the church
[36:19] says,
[36:21] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen.
[36:23] Bless the name of the Lord. Um, so if
[36:28] you'd like to turn with me to Matthew
[36:31] the 9th chapter, first of all,
[36:35] um,
[36:39] Matthew the 9th chapter.
[36:42] And it's good to have Sister Kim Weeks
[36:46] with us again. And um bouncing back
[36:50] good. Praise the Lord. And so um but
[36:56] Matthew the 9th chapter
[36:59] and 35th
[37:02] verse we will read.
[37:05] And Jesus went all about all the cities
[37:09] and villages teaching in their
[37:10] synagogues. and preaching the gospel of
[37:12] the kingdom and healing every sickness
[37:15] and every disease among the people. But
[37:19] when he saw the multitudes, he was moved
[37:21] with compassion on them because they
[37:24] fainted and were scattered abroad as
[37:27] sheep uh having no shepherd.
[37:31] Then saith he unto his disciples, the
[37:34] harvest truly is plenteous, but the
[37:36] laborers are few. Pray ye therefore the
[37:40] Lord of the harvest that he will send
[37:41] forth laborers
[37:43] into his harvest. Then we'll go to
[37:47] Matthew uh the 25th chapter
[37:52] and we read this uh the other day and
[37:57] I'm going to just read it again.
[38:02] Um, Matthew 25:14,
[38:05] "For the kingdom of heaven is as a man
[38:08] traveling into a far country, who called
[38:11] his own servants, and delivered unto
[38:13] them his goods. And unto one he gave
[38:17] five talents, to another two, to another
[38:19] one.
[38:21] To every man according to his several
[38:23] ability, and straightway took his
[38:27] journey. Then he that had received the
[38:30] five talents went and traded with the
[38:32] same and made them other five talents.
[38:35] And likewise he that had received two,
[38:38] he also gained other two. But he that
[38:41] had received one went and digged in the
[38:44] earth and hid his lord's money. After a
[38:47] long time the lord of those servants
[38:50] cometh and reckonth with them. And so he
[38:53] that had received five talents came and
[38:56] brought other five talents, saying,
[38:58] Lord, thou deliverest unto me five
[39:00] talents. Behold, I have gained beside
[39:03] them five talents more. His lord said
[39:07] unto him, Well done, thou good and
[39:09] faithful servant. Thou hast been
[39:11] faithful over a few things. I will make
[39:14] thee ruler over many things. Enter thou
[39:18] into the joy of thy Lord. He also that
[39:21] had received two talents came and said,
[39:23] Lord, thou deliverest unto me two
[39:25] talents. Behold, I have gained two other
[39:28] talents beside them. His lord said unto
[39:31] him, Well done, thou good and faithful
[39:34] servant. Thou hast been faithful over a
[39:37] few things. I will make thee ruler over
[39:40] many things. Enter in thou into the joy
[39:43] of thy Lord. Then he which had received
[39:46] the one talent came and said, Lord, I
[39:50] knew thee that thou art in hard man,
[39:52] reaping where thou hast not sown, and
[39:55] gathering where thou hast not strolled.
[39:58] And I was afraid, and went and hid thy
[40:01] talent in the earth. Lo, there thou hast
[40:04] that is thine. His lord answered and
[40:07] said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
[40:11] uh servant, thou knowest that I reap
[40:14] where I sowed not and gathered where I
[40:16] have not stroed. Thou oughtest therefore
[40:19] to have put my money in the exchangers.
[40:22] And then at my coming I should have
[40:24] received mine own with us. Take
[40:27] therefore the talent from him and give
[40:29] it unto him which hath 10 talents. For
[40:32] unto everyone that hath shall be given,
[40:35] and he that um and he shall have
[40:38] abundance, but from him that hath not
[40:41] shall be taken away even that which he
[40:43] hath, and cast ye the unprofitable
[40:47] servant, into outer darkness, there
[40:49] shall be weeping and nashing of teeth.
[40:53] Amen. You can have your seats this
[40:56] evening.
[40:59] And I would like to continue on the
[41:01] subject that I spoke on Sunday
[41:04] uh doing our best for the Lord.
[41:08] And we are all called to do something
[41:11] for God. And I I count it an honor to to
[41:15] do something for the Lord. He's been so
[41:18] good to us. And and um I want to do all
[41:22] that I can for his kingdom. And I'm sure
[41:26] that every one of us here feels the same
[41:29] way.
[41:31] U but we are his body and u so he
[41:36] operates through his body and but you
[41:39] would think that he would choose
[41:42] superhuman people to work and to use and
[41:45] to reflect his glory but uh that's not
[41:49] true. uh he doesn't always use people
[41:53] that have it all together.
[41:56] Uh in fact, it's usually the opposite.
[42:00] Um and so no matter who you are, what
[42:03] you are, if you're part of the body of
[42:06] Christ,
[42:08] u then God has put you here on this
[42:10] earth for a reason. And it it does not
[42:14] matter the age uh per se. Um uh we all
[42:20] go through the seasons. We all go
[42:22] through things um uh from the youth to
[42:26] middle-aged uh to to the the oldest. And
[42:30] and yet if God has us here on this
[42:33] earth, then he's still got something for
[42:36] us to do.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; I just believe that. And so um uh but he
[42:42] he saved us for a purpose and he called
[42:46] each of us to labor uh for his kingdom.
[42:51] And every one of us have our own unique
[42:54] way of doing something. Uh uh God didn't
[43:00] call uh us uh to do the same thing uh in
[43:07] the same way.
[43:09] uh whatever. But but some are able to
[43:12] sing, some are able to preach, some are
[43:15] able to play instruments, some um are
[43:19] able to um you know to to do whatever.
[43:23] But but God has given us the talents and
[43:27] he's actually given us our different
[43:30] personalities. He's given us just the
[43:32] way we are. Uh it all plays into what he
[43:36] wants us to do.
[43:39] Um
[43:40] and and and so whatever we are called to
[43:43] do, we must do it.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; We are responsible
[43:49] uh uh to do this.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Now some of you know some of us may not
[43:54] have a real nice singing voice, but if
[43:58] God's called you to sing, then you're
[44:02] responsible for that.
[44:05] Uh some of us may not be fiery preachers
[44:08] like others or some of us may not be uh
[44:13] professional musicians as others are.
[44:17] And
[44:18] a lot of times that causes people to
[44:23] become dissatisfied in what they do. It
[44:26] causes them to build a complex
[44:30] uh of inferiority, to feel inferior to
[44:35] maybe someone else uh that we would
[44:39] think can do it better or or whatever.
[44:42] Um and and I I don't I don't believe
[44:46] that's the way God wants us to serve
[44:48] him.
[44:50] I I think that God wants us I truly
[44:53] believe that God wants us just to be uh
[44:57] believe in what we are in who we are
[45:00] &gt;&gt; and what he's called us to do.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; I I think that's what brother Brandham
[45:05] said that we are all responsible to find
[45:08] out what God wants us to do
[45:11] &gt;&gt; and and just to float along in life and
[45:15] and bump here and bump there. I I don't
[45:19] think that's what God is is wanting of
[45:22] us. But he's looking for a people that
[45:25] are solid, looking for a people that are
[45:28] willing to work and to work within the
[45:32] call that he's ordained for them. And
[45:35] so, but it it causes these things. And
[45:39] um as I was uh talking about the the man
[45:44] with the one talent, there was three men
[45:47] Jesus talks about. One had five talents,
[45:50] the other one was given two, the other
[45:51] one was one. And the others done great
[45:54] with their talents. But this one, this
[45:57] man, he um I I'll say that he got a
[46:01] complex about it. you know, he didn't
[46:04] have as much to do. Didn't have much
[46:07] talents as the others and he just had
[46:10] that one and so instead of doing
[46:14] something with it, he buried it and and
[46:18] Jesus said he buried it in the earth. Um
[46:22] and so um he hid his talent and and so
[46:27] uh but but in this Jesus is telling us
[46:30] that every man is going to give an
[46:33] answer for what he has done with what
[46:37] God has given him.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Every one of us are going to give an
[46:41] account. Um, and you know, I I thought
[46:46] of, you know, how how many singers are
[46:49] out there singing for the world and
[46:52] great great uh talent and instead of
[46:56] using it for God, they have sold out and
[47:00] they're using it for the devil. Ain't
[47:02] that right?
[47:04] &gt;&gt; But then there's many that just keep
[47:06] their talent hid in the church and they
[47:09] don't do nothing with it.
[47:11] uh and it may be because of uh they
[47:15] don't feel like uh you know they're
[47:18] they're they've got much to offer. They
[47:21] they maybe feel like well you know I I
[47:25] just don't think it's important
[47:27] &gt;&gt; but if God gives us something it is
[47:30] important
[47:31] &gt;&gt; you are important in the body of Christ.
[47:35] Do you believe that? So then we we find
[47:38] that God gave us something to do and
[47:42] then he gave us something to do it with.
[47:46] God does not leave us unequipped but he
[47:50] gives us something to do and gives us
[47:54] something to do it with. Now I I brother
[47:58] Brandham talking he said I just noticing
[48:01] this young fella he goes that's your
[48:03] wife brother Burns is it that playing
[48:05] and singing there that young couple
[48:07] isn't a piano neither or he said it
[48:10] isn't a piano neither is it an organ
[48:12] it's some kind of an instrument they
[48:14] make a strum uh and pick it and do
[48:18] something for the Lord now if you could
[48:21] do that and sing and see that's when
[48:24] soul see you're you're doing this. In
[48:26] other words, they're doing it to win
[48:28] souls. That's their goal. Ain't that
[48:31] right? They may not be a preacher. They
[48:33] may not be uh uh uh world known, but
[48:37] what they got, they're doing it to to
[48:40] win souls.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, it's it in other
[48:44] words, it's all a part of it. Uh uh they
[48:47] may not been standing there. God God had
[48:49] a prophet on the scene at that time and
[48:51] he's the one that's getting ready to
[48:52] deliver the message. But but that didn't
[48:55] mean that that Brother Burns and his
[48:57] wife playing whatever they were playing
[48:59] and singing wasn't part of the kingdom
[49:02] of God.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; They they were all doing something and
[49:05] it was for the kingdom of God to win
[49:08] souls to to be a blessing. So he says do
[49:12] something no matter if you can whistle
[49:16] well whistle. See, just do something.
[49:20] Just testify or do something for the
[49:24] kingdom of God. And whatever you've got,
[49:28] put it to the use in God's service.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So now there there are
[49:37] uh uh uh several a few ministers here uh
[49:41] tonight and yet none of us preach alike.
[49:44] Uh but see that doesn't mean that anyone
[49:46] is in is is better or lesser or
[49:50] whatever. It's just that that God never
[49:53] called us uh uh to do it all alike.
[49:57] We're not called to do that. We're not
[49:58] called to uh uh uh uh you know to to to
[50:03] uh uh we all have a different
[50:06] presentation to to bring. But now we're
[50:09] all called to preach the message. How
[50:12] many believes that? See, we're we're
[50:14] called to preach the message as
[50:16] ministers. See, and and and because
[50:18] that's the age that we're we're living
[50:21] in. And and and so this message is our
[50:24] message to preach. But God never called
[50:27] us to compete against one another. I'm
[50:31] I'm not to try to be like brother Amos,
[50:33] and brother Amos isn't to try to be like
[50:35] brother Terry. and and and brother Terry
[50:38] ain't trying to be like uh brother
[50:40] Daniel or or or vice versa or or
[50:43] whatever. See, and so when when when we
[50:47] try to be like someone else, then we're
[50:50] we're only impersonating.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? We're we're only
[50:54] impersonating. And and we know what an
[50:57] impersonator is. Uh an impersonator is
[50:59] an actor. And and so you hear brother
[51:02] Brown talking about Hollywood all the
[51:04] time. Hollywood acting. Quit this
[51:06] Hollywood acting. And what he's trying
[51:08] to say is is quit impersonating. Quit
[51:11] being something that you're not. A ain't
[51:14] that right? See, God, if God didn't call
[51:16] you to do it, then then don't try to do
[51:19] it. Now, I as I've said, uh
[51:23] we should have examples. We should have
[51:25] men and women that we look up to, that
[51:28] we respect, that we admire. as Paul
[51:30] would even say, be followers of them who
[51:33] through faith and patience inherit the
[51:35] promises of God. You you you should have
[51:38] examples. I I think you young people
[51:41] should have elders that you would look
[51:42] to and say, "Lord, I I want to be like
[51:45] that." And but but that's not TO BE
[51:47] THEIR STYLE. That's that's not to try to
[51:50] impersonate them. But if you see them
[51:53] dedicating their lives, WELL, GOD,
[51:55] that's what I want. If if you see them
[51:58] being faithful in THEIR CALLING, WELL
[52:00] GOD, I WANT TO BE FAITHFUL IN MY
[52:02] CALLING. If you see them anointed and
[52:05] being used OF GOD, WELL GOD, THAT'S WHAT
[52:07] I WANT TO BE. I I want to be anointed. I
[52:10] want to be used of God. But that doesn't
[52:12] mean that we so idolize a person that
[52:15] that we try to be like that person and
[52:18] and we preach like that person or try to
[52:20] sing like that person and and and all of
[52:23] these things. there there's too much
[52:25] fake that is going around. Uh fake
[52:28] singers, fake preachers, fake this, fake
[52:31] ministries is because no one and I don't
[52:34] say no one, but but a it's because a lot
[52:38] of people don't want to be they're
[52:40] they're not comfortable with way called
[52:43] them to be.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; And and so uh but there there are
[52:47] several mothers here. Amen. But you
[52:49] know, God didn't call all you mothers to
[52:53] to raise your children just alike.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, and so then when
[53:00] you when you try to be like someone,
[53:03] then then you're only impersonating. You
[53:05] don't want to be an actor raising your
[53:08] kids. You don't want to be an actor as
[53:10] much as we don't want to be an actor
[53:12] when we're preaching. You don't want to
[53:13] be an actor in raising your children.
[53:15] You don't want to be an actor in in in
[53:17] in whatever. See, God did not call us to
[53:21] be actors.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and so, Brother
[53:25] Brown says, "Many times people are
[53:27] trying to act like the other fella."
[53:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Listen, you quit trying to act
[53:33] like the next fella and just act out
[53:36] your own convictions and you get along
[53:40] better. Just be yourself."
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I I'll say it this
[53:46] way. Be yourself with the Holy Ghost.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Be yourself with the
[53:52] Holy Ghost. So, so people become
[53:54] miserable. WE GOT SO MANY miserable
[53:58] people in the world today because
[54:00] they're trying to be like someone else.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. And and we have to, you
[54:05] know, I I you know, again, I I blame a
[54:08] lot of that on on social media is
[54:11] because we're seeing so much good. So
[54:14] much things that looks appealing and and
[54:16] well, I want my house to be like that. I
[54:18] I want my children to be like that. I
[54:20] want my wife to be like that and I want
[54:22] my husband to be like that. Well, God
[54:25] didn't call your family to be like the
[54:28] next door's family.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and so people
[54:33] become miserable when when they try to
[54:36] be like someone else. Now impersonation
[54:39] is something that is not inspired of
[54:42] God. It's actually inspired of the devil
[54:44] because that's exactly what Satan has
[54:46] started out doing. He wanted a kingdom
[54:48] just like God's. And and he's determined
[54:51] that he'll be like God, show himself
[54:53] that he is God when he's not God. He
[54:56] ain't even close to being like God. And
[54:59] yet he's going to present himself as
[55:01] being God. That's impersonation.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and so he copies
[55:08] anything that God does. Now, Brother
[55:11] Brandon says, "See, all the things that
[55:13] the devil has, he stole the copyright
[55:16] from God to make it." See, Satan cannot
[55:19] create. Satan is no creator. He's a
[55:22] perverter of something God created.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? But see, the the
[55:28] prophet told us that nobody can take
[55:30] your place.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; So then if nobody CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE,
[55:34] then what's the use of anybody trying to
[55:36] be like you?
[55:37] &gt;&gt; IF NOBODY CAN TAKE MY PLACE, then what's
[55:40] the use of anybody trying to be like me?
[55:42] If if if then then that tells us that
[55:45] that no one can be like you. You can't
[55:47] be like nobody else. So then you are
[55:50] original
[55:51] &gt;&gt; and be original.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[55:56] Now, brother Brandham says the American
[55:58] people through television and through
[56:00] picture shows, they have been they have
[56:03] seen so much of the put on till they
[56:06] become put on themselves. He said that's
[56:09] too bad. And we get it in church actors.
[56:13] He says God don't want them see be far
[56:17] be it from us to be actors. BE YOURSELF.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS YOU TO BE that way.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Right? God wants you to be yourself.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; See, and and HE SAYS, "I DESPISE SEEING
[56:31] someone trying to do something that they
[56:34] cannot do."
[56:35] &gt;&gt; You're not called to do everything.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's why we HAVE A
[56:40] BODY.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; CUZ WE'RE NOT CALLED TO do everything.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; But when we don't do our part, then it
[56:47] leaves A HOLE BECAUSE I CANNOT TAKE THAT
[56:49] PLACE and you cannot take that place.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So then what what if we're going
[56:56] to do something for God, which God's
[56:58] called us to do something, then we've
[57:01] got to be content. Everybody say, "I
[57:04] need to be content."
[57:05] &gt;&gt; I need to be content with the way God
[57:08] made me.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; And use whatever talent
[57:14] we have been given.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Yeah.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Now, God wants to express himself
[57:20] through your body and and he wants to
[57:25] use you in the way that he designed you.
[57:28] And and we're all designed. We we're a
[57:31] special designed people. And and uh uh
[57:35] design means uh to devise for a special
[57:38] function or end deliberate
[57:42] uh purpose of planning. It's a
[57:45] deliberate purpose of planning to devise
[57:48] for a special function. So when God uh
[57:53] uh when he when he through throughout
[57:56] time way in the beginning he had this
[57:59] plan and he knew what he was going to do
[58:01] and and he would become the actor but HE
[58:05] NEEDED THE BODY. He needed the mask.
[58:07] Amen. To to do the part. Ain't that
[58:10] right? And so he designed you and every
[58:14] one of us in a certain way that in this
[58:18] age he could come in each one of us and
[58:22] act a different part through us.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So then he made us
[58:29] with the right temperament. He made us
[58:31] in the right way. He made us with the
[58:34] right character, the right nature, the
[58:36] right personality that that he could
[58:41] take and and work through. So no gift or
[58:46] talent is a onesizefits all.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[58:53] &gt;&gt; And so brother Brandham says, "See, it's
[58:56] inscriptural for you or I to impersonate
[58:59] anyone else." Right? So be what you are
[59:02] and be a good one.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Now, that's what we need to focus on.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Be what we are and be a good one and
[59:10] fulfill your purpose so others can see
[59:13] you. If you're a housewife, be a real
[59:16] one. If you're a husband, be a genuine
[59:19] one. If you're a deacon, be genuine. Or
[59:23] a preacher, whatever you are. But don't
[59:26] try to take someone else's place. Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Now, in the uh things that are to be,
[59:34] brother Brandon talks about the the
[59:36] different uh varieties. And he says in
[59:39] my father's house is many kinds of
[59:41] mansions. See, I don't believe that when
[59:43] we get to heaven that we will be just
[59:46] everybody just look exactly alike. I
[59:49] don't believe that we'll all be blondes
[59:50] or brunettes or little big or all giants
[59:53] or whatever. I believe that God is a God
[59:56] of variety. The world proves that. He's
[59:59] got big mountains, little mountains,
[1:00:01] he's got plains, he's got deserts, he's
[1:00:03] got different things because he made it
[1:00:05] the the way he wanted it. GOD made it
[1:00:08] the way he wanted it. God made you THE
[1:00:10] WAY HE WANTED YOU,
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SEE, and so he made the seasons.
[1:00:15] Summer, winter, spring, autumn, he made
[1:00:17] the seasons. It shows he's a God of
[1:00:20] variety. He made you in a variety. Some
[1:00:24] men are real blusterous. Some some are
[1:00:27] real dogmatic, others are fine, others
[1:00:29] are kind. And you just find all
[1:00:32] different kinds of people and they're in
[1:00:35] his kingdom. Look at St. Peter and judge
[1:00:39] him by Andrew. Andrew is that prayer
[1:00:41] warrior just stayed on his knees all the
[1:00:43] time. The Apostle Peter was one of those
[1:00:45] fire brands, that priest and so forth.
[1:00:48] PAUL WAS MORE SCHOLARLY LIKE THE PROPHET
[1:00:51] or something like that. Just sat back.
[1:00:53] See, Moses wrote the first four books of
[1:00:56] the Bible of of uh of the old. See, and
[1:00:59] which he wrote the Old Testament. See,
[1:01:01] and the rest of it was the laws, kings,
[1:01:04] psalms, and so forth. And what someone
[1:01:06] wrote of the prophets, but Moses wrote
[1:01:08] the laws. See, the first four books of
[1:01:10] the Bible, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
[1:01:13] and Deuteronomy. And then uh uh Paul
[1:01:16] wrote the New Testament. See, that's
[1:01:18] true. Mark, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John
[1:01:21] wrote the acts of what taken place so
[1:01:23] forth. But Paul separated law and grace
[1:01:26] and put it into its place. He was the
[1:01:29] writer of the New Testament. Ain't that
[1:01:31] right? See, so God made Paul in a
[1:01:34] certain way than he made Peter and
[1:01:37] Andrew. And he even put Paul in a
[1:01:40] certain uh uh uh a path in life. and and
[1:01:45] pet Peter didn't go through, you know,
[1:01:47] the Sanhedrin and become like, you know,
[1:01:49] he wasn't a teacher. HE WASN'T A BUT
[1:01:51] PAUL was Paul learned that law. He was a
[1:01:54] student of the law, but God would take
[1:01:57] that and use him to divide law and
[1:02:00] grace.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, we we find that
[1:02:06] brother Brandham is is showing that all
[1:02:08] of these men were called to do something
[1:02:10] for the Lord. Amen. But they THEY WERE
[1:02:14] NOT CALLED TO BE alike or to do uh or
[1:02:19] act in the same style like the others.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; So why would God choose us to preach the
[1:02:27] gospel if we're not the best preacher in
[1:02:29] town?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Why would God choose us to sing amen uh
[1:02:35] uh for his kingdom if we're not the best
[1:02:37] singer in the world? YOU KNOW WHY WHY
[1:02:40] WHY WHY WOULD HE choose us you know you
[1:02:43] mothers to be a mother if if if you're
[1:02:46] not the best mother and if you're not
[1:02:49] you know UH UH ON SOCIAL media and
[1:02:52] everybody's ooing and oh and over your
[1:02:54] ability to be the mothers well why WOULD
[1:02:57] GOD THEN CHOOSE us a man TO DO THESE
[1:03:00] THINGS WELL I SAID IT THIS WAY WHEN GOD
[1:03:02] CHOOSE YOU he knew what he was doing
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; he knew what he was doing and and so
[1:03:08] there therefore Four. See, we we do
[1:03:11] ourselves an injustice by comparing
[1:03:15] oursel with others.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; A minister should never compare himself
[1:03:20] by another man's ministry.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; A mother should never compare herself
[1:03:25] with another mother.
[1:03:28] You you young lady should never compare
[1:03:31] yourself to other young ladies. That's
[1:03:34] what causes discontentment.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Hello. You spend more of your time
[1:03:40] trying to keep up with others than you
[1:03:42] do trying to work for God.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; It's just true.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; SO HE GAVE US THE TALENTS. He gave us
[1:03:55] the gifts that enables us to work for
[1:03:59] him because God wants to use us.
[1:04:03] Everybody say, "God wants to use me."
[1:04:06] God wants to use me.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; He don't need you to be the best person
[1:04:10] in town. God can use what he what what
[1:04:13] he made you for.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; He doesn't need you to be a world
[1:04:16] preacher.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; He just needs needs you to to to he just
[1:04:20] called you to work. He's got a purpose
[1:04:23] to work through. Amen. See, so now there
[1:04:26] are things that the prophet tells us
[1:04:29] that God cannot use. There there are and
[1:04:32] I'm going to mention a few of them. Uh
[1:04:35] the prophet tells us that God cannot use
[1:04:38] a coward.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; He doesn't he doesn't demand beauty out
[1:04:45] of you you sisters. He doesn't demand us
[1:04:49] to be have a well-trained voice to be
[1:04:51] the be singers to be used for him.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; That that's not what he's requiring. But
[1:04:56] he cannot use a coward. Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Another one. WHEN WE TURN ASIDE FROM THE
[1:05:03] THINGS OF GOD, THEN GOD CANNOT use us
[1:05:06] any longer.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Another one, God cannot use your natural
[1:05:13] ability.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; If you're full of theological training,
[1:05:20] GOD CANNOT USE YOU. GOD'S GOT TO HAVE
[1:05:24] EMPTY VESSELS. EVERYBODY SAY, "GOD'S GOT
[1:05:26] TO HAVE EMPTY VESSELS.
[1:05:28] so he can fill them.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Another place HE SAID THAT'S WHAT IT WAS
[1:05:34] AT PENTECOST. THEY had empty vessels SO
[1:05:37] GOD COULD FILL THEM UP.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; And brother, this day demands that.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; This day's got to have that. We'll
[1:05:45] either have that or we'll perish.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; SO THEN WE'VE GOT TO EMPTY OURSELVES
[1:05:51] OUT. Don't don't worry about what you
[1:05:53] can do and what you're able not to do
[1:05:55] and and and how good you can do it and
[1:05:57] how bad you're doing it AND ALL. DON'T
[1:05:59] WORRY ABOUT THAT. JUST EMPTY YOURSELF
[1:06:02] OUT AND LET GOD FILL YOU. We've got to
[1:06:07] have that or we'll perish.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Now, he cannot use our ability. Now,
[1:06:14] this word ability is the quality or
[1:06:17] state of being able,
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:22] competence in doing something. But you
[1:06:26] remember what God said in I believe
[1:06:28] Zechariah, he said, "It's not by might
[1:06:32] nor by power, but by my spirit, sayith
[1:06:35] the Lord."
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Not by might, not by power, but by my
[1:06:40] spirit, sayith the Lord. Can you say
[1:06:42] amen? I I I just don't feel I just don't
[1:06:45] think that that we we ought to struggle
[1:06:48] in in what God has called us to do. Now,
[1:06:52] the Lord Taran, we we'll get more in in
[1:06:54] in into that, but but but WE'RE NOT UH I
[1:06:58] I just don't think we should be just
[1:07:00] exhausted and just, oh, I just don't
[1:07:03] know if I'm going to make it. I just I'm
[1:07:05] trying. Well, maybe maybe you're trying
[1:07:08] too hard.
[1:07:11] Maybe you're you're TRYING TO BE
[1:07:14] SOMETHING THAT GOD'S NOT CALLED YOU TO
[1:07:16] DO.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; WELL, it it's true. I I understand Satan
[1:07:23] fights us and and we fight. I I get
[1:07:26] that. But we've got to be we've got to
[1:07:29] be at at at ease, if I could say it that
[1:07:32] way, or comfortable,
[1:07:34] satisfied in the calling that God has
[1:07:38] called us with,
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; and he's promised that he would give us
[1:07:43] grace,
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; help us with,
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; did he not?
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Is that NOT WHAT HE TOLD PAUL when Paul
[1:07:49] says, "Lord, just I" He said, "I I
[1:07:51] BESOUGHT THE LORD THREE TIMES TO take
[1:07:53] this away." It seemed to be a sticker in
[1:07:56] Paul's flesh. And Paul thought it was
[1:08:00] hindering him from doing more for God.
[1:08:03] And yet WHEN HE BESOUGHT THE LORD THREE
[1:08:05] TIMES, the Lord TOLD HIM, "PAUL, my
[1:08:08] grace is sufficient for thee.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; In thy weakness, my strength is made
[1:08:14] perfect."
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; So, see, we find that God had a purpose
[1:08:21] for Paul's life.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Ain't that right? And it wasn't
[1:08:24] all glorious, but yet there was a grace.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; A grace.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; You don't have to get burned out.
[1:08:33] There's a grace.
[1:08:35] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? THERE'S A GRACE for
[1:08:37] you mothers. There's a GRACE FOR YOU
[1:08:39] PREACHERS. THERE'S A GRACE FOR US
[1:08:41] PASTORS. THERE'S A GRACE FOR US FATHERS.
[1:08:44] THERE'S A GRACE FOR THE DEACONS. There's
[1:08:46] a GRACE FOR THE MUSICIANS. There's
[1:08:48] grace.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:52] You believe it?
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Now, you may not feel that you're the
[1:08:57] best fit for the job, and you may give
[1:09:00] your excuses and and as to the reasons
[1:09:04] as to why you can't do it, but I I but
[1:09:09] but I'm not here to sympathize tonight.
[1:09:12] I just tell you, it ain't going to hold
[1:09:14] up
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; in in in God's court.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; It it just won't hold up. Mighty men of
[1:09:22] the Bible
[1:09:24] gave excuses
[1:09:27] as to why they couldn't do it. They had
[1:09:31] their fears. They had their
[1:09:33] uncertainties. They had their complexes.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; They had their things that bothered
[1:09:38] them. And yet when God called them, they
[1:09:42] tried to give that as an excuse. God, I
[1:09:44] can't do that. Moses had a stuttering
[1:09:46] problem.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Well, I CAN'T GO OUT THERE. WHAT you
[1:09:48] talking about? you know.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; God didn't change his mind because God
[1:09:54] already knew it.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; And and and God didn't say, "Moses, that
[1:09:59] you know what? You really your your
[1:10:01] excuse holds up. I'm telling you. Duh. I
[1:10:05] don't know why I didn't think of that.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Just go out there and just be be a
[1:10:10] shepherd. I'll go find somebody else."
[1:10:12] No.
[1:10:13] He called stuttering Moses
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; to go before the king and say, "Let my
[1:10:19] people go."
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; We we find see that that that there
[1:10:25] there was a lot. Gideon had his excuses.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Uh um uh uh well, so many others had
[1:10:31] their excuses. Jonah had his excuses.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; And and to us and to them, they were
[1:10:40] legit,
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; right? but not to God.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the prophet said God
[1:10:48] could have chose the son to preach the
[1:10:50] gospel. He could have chose the wind. He
[1:10:52] could have chose anything. But he chose
[1:10:53] man to preach the gospel. He chose you
[1:10:56] mothers. He chose you fathers to raise
[1:10:58] children in this age,
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; the most evil age, the most most insane
[1:11:04] age, the most darkest age ever,
[1:11:06] deceiving age. And yet, he didn't tell
[1:11:08] us. Now, I DON'T THINK Y'ALL can raise
[1:11:11] them. So, so, so don't don't don't you
[1:11:14] know uh uh they've got other plans for
[1:11:16] you to keep you from having children and
[1:11:18] and so you probably better not do that.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; No, that that ain't that ain't the
[1:11:23] truth. GOD'S GOT CONFIDENCE in you.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; So we find that the first thing that God
[1:11:32] done is is to be able to use man in in
[1:11:36] in in this age is that he redeemed a
[1:11:39] group of people
[1:11:42] and he made them his body here on earth.
[1:11:44] Do you believe that?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Now let's go back in the beginning.
[1:11:47] Before the beginning, the first visible
[1:11:51] thing of God was a pillar of fire.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? God is the spirit. No
[1:11:57] man has seen God at any time. But the
[1:12:00] first visual thing, visible thing by
[1:12:03] supernatural eye was the pillar of fire.
[1:12:06] See, and and so the prophet tells us
[1:12:09] this pillar of fire went out of God,
[1:12:11] which is the logos. ANOTHER PLACE HE
[1:12:13] SAID THE PILLAR OF FIRE is the
[1:12:16] anointing.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; It's Christ.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; So when Peter when Jesus SAYS, "WHO DO
[1:12:23] MEN SAY THAT I the son of man AM?" AND
[1:12:25] PETER SAID, "THOU ART THE CHRIST." HE
[1:12:27] WASN'T JUST LOOKING AT THAT PLACE. HE
[1:12:29] WAS TAKING IT ALL THE WAY BACK FOR
[1:12:31] BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF TIME and said,
[1:12:33] "You're that logos.
[1:12:35] YOU'RE THAT PILLAR OF FIRE." AMEN. He
[1:12:38] identified who he really is. See, AND
[1:12:41] THIS PILLAR OF FIRE, brother said, is
[1:12:44] actually the attribute of the fullness
[1:12:47] of God.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; So this pillar of fire, Amen.
[1:12:52] That pillar of fire, Amen. Now that that
[1:12:55] pillar of fire, think of that. That's
[1:12:56] not another pillar of fire. That is the
[1:12:58] same pillar of fire that was there
[1:13:01] before the world was ever created.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; That pillar of fire came out of God.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; So that's not a a second pillar of fire.
[1:13:08] That's not the third pillar of fire.
[1:13:10] That's the original pillar of fire. It's
[1:13:12] the only pillar of fire. And it came out
[1:13:15] of God. That's the first visible form of
[1:13:18] God.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Isn't that awesome that
[1:13:23] we have a picture of that?
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Now, so the pillar of fire was the first
[1:13:30] body form of God
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; and and so it was the only form that the
[1:13:36] spirit had and in that form he created
[1:13:40] heaven and earth. In that form he said
[1:13:44] let there be light and he created light.
[1:13:46] In that form he brooded over the earth.
[1:13:49] Amen. and Isaiah came up and birds begin
[1:13:53] to fly and and life come up.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Came into existence. Ain't that right?
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; And it's in that form, theophony form,
[1:14:04] pillar of fire, anointing that he would
[1:14:08] come down in the cool of the evening and
[1:14:10] brood among the trees and Adam and Eve
[1:14:14] would come and kneel before him and have
[1:14:17] fellowship with God.
[1:14:20] have communion with God with that pillar
[1:14:23] of fire.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The prophet said, "And
[1:14:26] the voice, a voice would come from that
[1:14:29] light and talk back to them." Ain't that
[1:14:32] right? Then you fast forward it. That
[1:14:35] same form pillar of fire was what Moses
[1:14:39] met
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; at the burning bush.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a literal fire. It was that
[1:14:47] that was in that bush,
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; A SUPERNATURAL FIRE THAT WOULD NOT GO
[1:14:53] OUT. THAT BUSH WOULD NOT BURN. IT WAS A
[1:14:56] A HOLY FIRE.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; AND THE VOICE COME OUT OF THAT FIRE AND
[1:15:02] SPOKE TO MOSES. MOSES, TAKE off your
[1:15:04] shoes for the place you're standing is
[1:15:07] holy ground.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. THROUGH THAT PILLAR OF FIRE, AMEN.
[1:15:11] The prophet called that pillar of fire
[1:15:13] the angel of the covenant. Right.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; And and and it was the angel of the
[1:15:17] covenant. Amen. That that brought Israel
[1:15:19] out of Egypt.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Led. Now, you know, notice Moses
[1:15:28] led the children. I'm getting somewhere
[1:15:31] that Moses led the children of Israel. A
[1:15:34] prophet led the children of Israel. And
[1:15:37] and uh uh as God, the prophet said,
[1:15:40] would tell him where to go. Moses led
[1:15:42] the children of Israel as God in that
[1:15:45] pillar of fire led to would tell him
[1:15:48] where to go. So it's it was actually the
[1:15:50] supernatural being that was taking over
[1:15:54] Moses and leading the way. Moses was was
[1:15:58] uh uh well brother said Moses just got
[1:16:01] his information. Now now listen, Moses
[1:16:03] wasn't just a man. Moses realized that
[1:16:06] he was just weak and and and frail and
[1:16:09] he was a stutterer. He wasn't much. Uh
[1:16:12] when God totally stripped him, he just
[1:16:15] felt like HE WAS A NOBODY. THAT'S WHAT
[1:16:17] GOD WANTED HIM TO COME TO BECAUSE GOD
[1:16:20] NOW, AMEN, THROUGH that pillar of fire
[1:16:23] could anoint Moses and give him
[1:16:25] direction. And Moses instead of saying,
[1:16:28] "Well, I'm going to go this way cuz I
[1:16:29] think that's better." He would com
[1:16:31] submit to God and say, "Mo, God say,
[1:16:34] "Now, Moses, you go down and and follow
[1:16:37] this way." And Moses JUST AUTOMATICALLY
[1:16:40] GOT HIS INFORMATION AND BEGAN to lead
[1:16:42] the people in a certain direction and he
[1:16:45] led them to the the Red Sea.
[1:16:48] NOW, WHAT A STUPID IDEA. AMEN. SOME MAN,
[1:16:53] SOME A GENERAL, NO GENERAL, no smart
[1:16:56] man. If you're going to lead the people
[1:16:58] out of something away from the enemy,
[1:17:00] you're not going to lead THEM INTO A
[1:17:02] TRAP.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD HAD A HIS DESIRE. God had a
[1:17:07] plan.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; AND HE WOULD SHOW HIS POWER BY rolling
[1:17:11] back the Red Sea and letting the people
[1:17:14] walk forward that Moses had come to a
[1:17:18] place that he would yield himself to the
[1:17:21] pillar of fire. And God, brother Bram
[1:17:24] said, he was getting his message through
[1:17:26] there and giving it to the children of
[1:17:28] Israel on the road to a promised land.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Yeah.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; So he says, "The pillar of fire that
[1:17:34] called them out led them to the promised
[1:17:37] land under the anointing of a prophet."
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, Moses was just a
[1:17:44] man without the anointing. And so are
[1:17:47] you.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Us preachers, we're just preachers
[1:17:52] without the anointing. And you talking
[1:17:55] about bad preachers, we we probably
[1:17:57] would be just horrible preachers. I I am
[1:18:00] anyways. And and yet it would take AN
[1:18:03] ANOINTING. AMEN. WITHOUT THE ANOINTING,
[1:18:05] WHAT ARE WE as musicians? WITHOUT THE
[1:18:08] ANOINTING, WHAT ARE WE AS FATHERS AND
[1:18:10] MOTHERS?
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE ANOINTING, WHAT ARE WE?
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; So he says, see, the pillar of fire that
[1:18:22] called them out led them to the promised
[1:18:24] land under the anointing of a prophet. a
[1:18:27] pillar of fire that they could look at,
[1:18:28] led them to the promised land under
[1:18:31] anointed prophet. But then
[1:18:34] God bottled himself
[1:18:37] all up into one man, Jesus Christ.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; now the pillar of fire was in him in
[1:18:45] flesh.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Paul says in Colossians 2:94,
[1:18:51] "In him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[1:18:54] Godhead bodily." AND JOHN THE BAPTIST
[1:18:57] SAW IT HAPPEN,
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; He saw it HAPPEN WHEN HE BAPTIZED JESUS.
[1:19:03] Matthew 3:16, WHEN JESUS WAS BAPTIZED,
[1:19:06] AMEN, went up straight way out of the
[1:19:08] water, and lo, the heavens were opened
[1:19:10] up, and he John SAW THE SPIRIT OF GOD,
[1:19:14] AMEN, DESCENDING LIKE A dove and
[1:19:16] lightning upon him. Amen. and low a
[1:19:19] voice from heaven saying, "This is my
[1:19:21] beloved son in whom I am pleased to
[1:19:25] dwell."
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just a lick of fire. It
[1:19:30] was all of God.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Bottled up in a man.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram SAID THAT SAME ANOINTING
[1:19:39] CAME DOWN AT his baptism and went into
[1:19:42] Christ and dwelt IN HIM. AND JOHN knew
[1:19:46] it was him. He saw it happen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So that pillar of fire
[1:19:53] was made flesh and dwelt among us. Do
[1:19:56] you believe it?
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Now just skipping through a lot here.
[1:20:00] But brother Brown said, "What was Jesus
[1:20:02] manifested for? To show God."
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? A human being. God had
[1:20:09] a human being. God had a body on earth.
[1:20:11] Amen. To express himself. That's what
[1:20:14] Jesus was manifested for. To show God.
[1:20:17] TO SHOW GOD. NOT TO SHOW HUMAN ABILITY,
[1:20:20] BUT TO SHOW GOD. NOT TO SHOW HUMAN
[1:20:22] SMARTNESS, BUT TO SHOW GOD.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; He was God. And through that purpose, he
[1:20:29] achieved a church that he, the fullness
[1:20:33] of God, might bring to pass every
[1:20:34] promise of God in these last days when
[1:20:36] he gets the preeminence in the church,
[1:20:40] the position, his place in the church.
[1:20:45] So we find in another place, brother
[1:20:47] Bram said, God came down in the image of
[1:20:49] man to redeem man and that brought man
[1:20:52] and God together.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth hugged and kissed each
[1:20:56] other. God and man, man embraced each
[1:20:59] other as fatherhood and sunship when the
[1:21:02] log go became flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:21:05] But then Jesus said, "I came from God
[1:21:07] and I go back to God."
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; And he did. He came from the pillar of
[1:21:13] fire and he returned back to being a
[1:21:15] pillar of fire. Ain't that right? So
[1:21:18] after his ascension, amen, he come as a
[1:21:22] pillar of fire. Uh uh Acts 226, Paul is
[1:21:26] given an account of his conversion. And
[1:21:29] he says, "As I made my journey and was
[1:21:32] come unto Damascus about noon, suddenly
[1:21:36] there shone from heaven a great light.
[1:21:39] Not sunlight,
[1:21:41] not candle light,
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; supernatural light.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; There shone from heaven a great light
[1:21:49] round about me." And I fell unto the
[1:21:52] ground, and heard a voice saying unto
[1:21:53] me, "Saul, Saul, why perse persecutest
[1:21:56] thou me?" and I answered, "Who art thou,
[1:22:00] Lord?"
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't just say, "Who art thou?"
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; "Who art thou, LORD?" WELL, he only knew
[1:22:06] one Lord, and that was Jehovah.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; WHO ART THOU JEHOVAH?
[1:22:11] AND he said unto me, I am Jesus of
[1:22:13] Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; See, so now he was manifesting himself
[1:22:20] in again in the form of a pillar of
[1:22:23] fire. Yes.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham said, "God changed
[1:22:26] himself from a pillar of fire to become
[1:22:28] a man. He dwelt in Jesus Christ, then
[1:22:32] changed himself from that back in the
[1:22:35] spirit again that he might dwell in
[1:22:38] man."
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; So now we read there in the book of Acts
[1:22:43] on the day of Pentecost. Amen. The same
[1:22:47] Holy Spirit, the same logos, the same
[1:22:52] anointing, pillar of fire, the same
[1:22:54] Christ that created all things in the
[1:22:56] beginning. Amen. And that was in the
[1:22:59] wilderness that led Moses and talked lip
[1:23:02] to ear to Moses and brought the children
[1:23:05] out of of of Egypt and and rode back the
[1:23:08] RED SEA AND PROVIDED FOR THEM EVERY STEP
[1:23:11] OF THE WAY. Now that same logos dropped
[1:23:14] down on the day of Pentecost. Now, now
[1:23:18] notice, Amen. Acts 2 and1. And when the
[1:23:21] day of Pentecost was fully come, they
[1:23:24] were all with one accord in one place.
[1:23:26] And suddenly there came a sound from
[1:23:28] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and
[1:23:30] it filled all the house where they were
[1:23:32] sitting. And there appeared unto them
[1:23:35] clothe tongues like as a fire, and it
[1:23:39] set up on each of them.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a pillar of fire coming down
[1:23:44] on one man.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; It was now LICKS OF FIRE coming and
[1:23:50] setting upon 120 people.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and they were all
[1:23:56] filled WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:23:59] THEY WERE FILLED WITH THAT SAME LOGOS
[1:24:02] THAT JESUS had in fullness.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET SAID IT WAS SENT TO
[1:24:12] ANOINT other sons and daughters of God.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Now, it did not make them God.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; We're not gods.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; No. In a sense like God,
[1:24:29] we are not God, but we are anointed.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; We are anointed. Everybody say, "I'm
[1:24:36] anointed."
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; I'm anointed. Jesus said, "The spirit of
[1:24:40] the Lord is upon me, for he hath
[1:24:42] anointed me to preach the gospel."
[1:24:45] Anointed me, amen, to set at liberty
[1:24:48] those that are captive. Anointed me. Can
[1:24:52] you say, "Amen." letting them know I'm
[1:24:54] not just doing this in my own self, but
[1:24:56] the father that dwelleth in me, he's
[1:24:58] doing the works.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; SO NOW, GOD DECIDED TO BYPASS YOUR
[1:25:04] WEAKNESSES.
[1:25:06] GOD DECIDED TO BYPASS YOUR FRAILTIES AND
[1:25:10] YOUR COMPLEXES AND AND YOUR EXCUSES AND
[1:25:14] HE DECIDED TO COME AND DWELL in you.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO ANOINT YOU TO DO WHAT YOU'RE
[1:25:22] DOING.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Anoint you.
[1:25:27] Second Coloss Corinthians 1:21. Now he
[1:25:30] which establishth us with you in Christ
[1:25:34] and hath anointed us is God. Same
[1:25:37] anointing.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Who hath also sealed us and given the
[1:25:44] earnest of the spirit in our hearts.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Right. So, it's not just now your flesh
[1:25:50] being anointed. It's not just your
[1:25:52] spirit being anointed. Amen. To prophesy
[1:25:56] and to dance and all of these things.
[1:25:58] But that anointing has COME DOWN TO
[1:26:00] ABIDE in you.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. To make his abode IN YOU. AMEN.
[1:26:08] NOW, HE'S GOING TO WORK through you.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? THEN THEN HOW COULD WE
[1:26:14] GIVE OUR OUR OUR OUR uh uh uh UH EXCUSES
[1:26:18] AS TO WHY WE CAN'T DO IT AND EXPECT GOD
[1:26:21] AMEN TO TO live by that.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; HE HE HE IS FAR ABOVE YOUR EXCUSES.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; YES, HE IS.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; HE'S FAR ABOVE OUR INCAPABILITIES.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; GOD DOESN'T NEED OUR CAPABILITIES.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; GOD DOESN'T USE OUR ABILITIES.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Think about it. He just takes your body.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "When it come down
[1:26:48] on the day of Pentecost, it broke up and
[1:26:50] tongues of fire set upon each of them."
[1:26:53] It was God in this pillar fire, the
[1:26:56] logos, separating himself among his
[1:26:59] people, showing that Christ and the
[1:27:02] bride. See, God and his church are
[1:27:06] becoming one.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; One. Can you say amen?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It may be just a little too
[1:27:14] simple, but that's okay. Christ and his
[1:27:16] church becoming one.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Not God superior and
[1:27:21] then here you are here with your
[1:27:22] complexes and inferior and he's
[1:27:24] expecting you to do SOMETHING AND YOU
[1:27:26] JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. NO. GOD COME
[1:27:28] AND LIVED in you to raise you up.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And now we becoming one.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; The works that I do shall you do also.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; So he says this logos that was in him
[1:27:46] which was the spirit of God, the
[1:27:48] anointing through the sanctifying grace
[1:27:50] of the blood brought many sons to God
[1:27:53] which is anointed with the same logos.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Same logos.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; You may say, "Oh, I just can't do it."
[1:28:03] But you're anointed with the same logos.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Every time a preacher
[1:28:08] gets behind the pulpit and BEGINS TO
[1:28:10] PREACH, HE DOESN'T GO BY HIS HOW HE
[1:28:12] FEELS. HE DOESN'T GO BY HIS ABILITIES.
[1:28:15] HE DOESN'T GO BY HIS SMARTNESS, BUT HE
[1:28:17] KNOWS HE'S ANOINTED WITH THE SAME LOGOS.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; ANOINTED.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; So on the day of Pentecost, the prophet
[1:28:27] said, God the logos separated himself
[1:28:30] into men. God not in one person. He's in
[1:28:35] his church universal.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; So the works that I do shall you do
[1:28:40] also. Even greater than these
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; shall you do.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? This is why Jesus
[1:28:47] said, "As the father has sent me, so
[1:28:50] send you." Prophet said, "How did the
[1:28:52] father send him?" By going with him. And
[1:28:55] how does Jesus send you? The same way
[1:28:57] the father sent him. He's going with us.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He may send you out
[1:29:03] into this world on the job. He may send
[1:29:05] you to a church to preach TO A PEOPLE.
[1:29:08] HE MAY SEND YOU OUT INTO the school. He
[1:29:10] may send you out. Amen. And you're
[1:29:13] married and you're having the CHILDREN
[1:29:14] AND AND THE CHALLENGES ARE THERE. BUT HE
[1:29:17] SAID, "I SEND YOU THE WAY THE FATHER
[1:29:19] SENT ME."
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; I'll go with you.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; I'll be with you.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You're anointed as
[1:29:27] you're raising your children. You're
[1:29:28] anointed to raise THEM. RIGHT.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:29:44] the prophet said God was bottled and
[1:29:46] confined in one man, Jesus Christ.
[1:29:49] But now, everybody say, "Now,
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; the scene's changed."
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's bottled and confined in the
[1:29:57] whole universal church of the living
[1:29:59] God.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; So right now he says while God is here
[1:30:03] speaking with us in our hearts, he's in
[1:30:05] Africa. He's in Asia. He's in Europe.
[1:30:08] He's in England. Wherever believers are
[1:30:11] gathered together, there he is in the
[1:30:13] midst of them.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Oh church, do you love him?
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not isolated alone. Oh no.
[1:30:20] He's with you.
[1:30:23] I believe.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; So if you have the Holy Spirit inside of
[1:30:26] you, then you've got a portion of God.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that ain't much." Oh,
[1:30:29] yes, it is much.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus had the fullness of God.
[1:30:34] That's why he could do everything. But
[1:30:36] oh, I love the way how brother Brandham
[1:30:38] said that. He said, "You take go out to
[1:30:41] the ocean, you get a big dipper of
[1:30:42] water, spoonful of water." Amen. And
[1:30:46] pull that out of the ocean. Now that
[1:30:47] that water is in the cup, Amen. You
[1:30:51] ain't got all the water that's out
[1:30:52] there. You just got a little bit. But
[1:30:55] every element that is in that ocean is
[1:30:58] in this water.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The same element
[1:31:03] that's in that ocean in that whole body
[1:31:05] is in THAT SPOONFUL OF WATER. AND THE
[1:31:08] SAME AMOUNT OF GOD, THE SAME POWER OF
[1:31:10] GOD, THE SAME NATURE, THE SAME
[1:31:12] CHARACTER, THE SAME ABILITY TO CREATE,
[1:31:16] AMEN, AND SPEAK THE SPOKEN WORD is in
[1:31:19] you. If you've just got an ounce of God
[1:31:21] in you,
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; just a little portion of God in you
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; is enough to create heavens and earth.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; And all that Christ was was poured over
[1:31:41] the church.
[1:31:42] Brother Brian said, "The last thing that
[1:31:44] the church is going to see is Christ
[1:31:46] manifested in his power." In fullness.
[1:31:51] Everybody say, "In fullness." Now, he
[1:31:53] poured out his spirit on the day of
[1:31:55] Pentecost, and we're thankful for that.
[1:31:58] BUT IT WAS A PROMISE THAT THE SON OF MAN
[1:32:01] would be revealed in the evening time. I
[1:32:05] know there's a a preaching going on THAT
[1:32:07] THAT THAT WAS THE SON OF MAN BEING
[1:32:09] REVEALED on the DAY OF PENTECOST. THAT'S
[1:32:10] NOT WHAT THE JESUS said and it's not
[1:32:13] what the prophet said. It would be in
[1:32:16] this DAY THAT THE FULLNESS OF GOD THAT
[1:32:19] WAS POURED OUT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST
[1:32:22] WOULD COME INTO full manifestation in
[1:32:24] this last day.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; It's this day that the church is coming
[1:32:35] into adoption of sons.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's this day
[1:32:40] that the church as it comes into power,
[1:32:44] it comes into full manifestation of
[1:32:46] Jesus Christ.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the dynamics of
[1:32:50] this church will be a refilling of the
[1:32:51] Holy Spirit.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; That we have worked in a small measure.
[1:32:55] So been working in small measure all the
[1:32:58] way through
[1:32:59] while the headstone is coming down to
[1:33:01] unite with the body.
[1:33:04] But when that head and body unites
[1:33:06] together, I say it has,
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; I say, we've come to an invisible union.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; And the body and the head has united
[1:33:15] together. The full power of the Holy
[1:33:17] Ghost will raise her up just exactly
[1:33:20] like that. You say, "WELL, I DON'T FEEL
[1:33:22] GOOSEBUMPS." YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL
[1:33:23] GOOSEBUMPS.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WELL, I JUST DON'T
[1:33:27] FEEL LIKE I'M ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP. YOU
[1:33:29] DON'T HAVE TO FEEL LIKE ON THE MOUNTAIN
[1:33:30] TOP, BUT THE SAME POWER IS HERE
[1:33:33] REGARDLESS.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT. RECOGNIZE YOUR
[1:33:38] DAY. RECOGNIZE THE TIME GOD HAS SHOWN
[1:33:41] HIMSELF TO BE THE SAME YESTERDAY, UH,
[1:33:44] TODAY AND FOREVER.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT THE SON OF MAN HAS BEEN
[1:33:50] REVEALED.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; This isn't just a little tinkling. This
[1:33:53] isn't just a little move. THIS IS THE
[1:33:56] POWER OF THE GOD IN THE CHURCH.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. I believe
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; even the dead that's dead in Christ for
[1:34:05] hundreds of years will rise in the
[1:34:06] beauty of his holiness and take a flight
[1:34:09] to the skies. The dynamics is the Holy
[1:34:11] Spirit.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Paul talks about this time
[1:34:15] happening
[1:34:17] in Ephesians 1:22
[1:34:19] when he says, "And hath put all things."
[1:34:22] Everybody say, "All things."
[1:34:24] all things under his feet and gave him
[1:34:29] to be the head over all things.
[1:34:32] Everybody say all things to the church,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; which is his body, the fullness of him
[1:34:38] that filleth all in all. Can you say
[1:34:40] amen? Christ becomes head of the church.
[1:34:45] Ain't that right? Amen. When the head
[1:34:48] and the body unite,
[1:34:50] Christ becomes head.
[1:34:53] Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; That's our identification is by the
[1:34:56] headship.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is true.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Now, Colossians 1:18, "And he is the
[1:35:05] head of the body, the church, who is the
[1:35:07] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[1:35:09] that in
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; all
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; all things." Everybody say, "All things
[1:35:13] he might have the preeminence."
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Church, we are here. There there there
[1:35:19] is not a mistake that Brother Brandon
[1:35:20] preached the message of prisoner. How
[1:35:22] many's ever listened to that? A prisoner
[1:35:23] of Christ. If you haven't, you need to
[1:35:25] go go home, listen to a prisoner.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; There. It's not a mistake that brother
[1:35:30] BRANDON PREACHED THAT.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE TIME THAT CHRIST IS TO HAVE
[1:35:35] THE PREEMINENCE OVER ALL THINGS IN THE
[1:35:38] CHURCH.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; He wants preeminence over your life. He
[1:35:41] wants preeminence in this in in the
[1:35:43] pulpit. He wants preeminence in your
[1:35:44] ministry. He wants preeminence in the
[1:35:46] way you raise your family and the way
[1:35:48] you you be a wife and the way you be a
[1:35:51] husband. He wants preeminence in
[1:35:52] everything and all things. CAN YOU SAY
[1:35:54] AMEN? HE WANTS PREEMINENCE IN THE WAY,
[1:35:57] AMEN. that you your YOU CHILDREN ARE
[1:35:59] RAISED UP AND AND AND HE WANTS
[1:36:02] PREEMINENCE.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; That word to have preeminence in your
[1:36:06] life.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; I won't keep you long, but let me ask
[1:36:13] you, what was Paul's secret to being
[1:36:16] used of God?
[1:36:19] Paul would
[1:36:21] indirectly I guess tell us
[1:36:26] Ephesians 3:1 for this calls I Paul
[1:36:30] the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
[1:36:35] Gentiles.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:1 I therefore the prisoner
[1:36:40] of the Lord beseech you that you walk
[1:36:43] worthy of the vocation wherewith you're
[1:36:45] called.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Timothy, I believe 1:8, "Be
[1:36:49] thou not therefore ashamed of the
[1:36:52] testimony of our Lord, nor of me his
[1:36:56] prisoner."
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Paul just didn't consider himself a
[1:36:59] Christian. He considered himself a
[1:37:02] prisoner.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Not in natural chains, even though he
[1:37:06] spent a third, I think onethird or so of
[1:37:09] his life in prison in in dark dungeons.
[1:37:12] And that's what caused him to go blind
[1:37:15] is in he lived in darkness most of his
[1:37:18] life uh preaching as preaching. He he he
[1:37:22] uh but but he he was more than just a
[1:37:25] prisoner in natural chains. He was a
[1:37:27] prisoner of love
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; to Christ.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; That's why he would say it's not I that
[1:37:37] liveth but Christ that liveth in me.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:44] Brother Brandham says, he says we've got
[1:37:47] to
[1:37:52] he says we've got to get ourselves and
[1:37:53] our abilities out of the way and
[1:37:55] surrender to the will and power of God.
[1:37:58] Say, "Well, brother, I can preach."
[1:38:00] Well, he can't use that as long as you
[1:38:03] can preach.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; That's all right. I can do this and I
[1:38:07] can do that. You can't do nothing.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:38:12] Can you say amen?
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; We can't We can't do nothing.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; And God allows us I I brother Amos, I
[1:38:21] truly believe that that God allows us to
[1:38:23] blunder.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; God allows us to trip up. God allows us
[1:38:29] to fall flat on our face.
[1:38:32] Not so we can develop complexes
[1:38:36] and inferiority and withdraw ourselves
[1:38:38] and say, "Well, I'm just not good at
[1:38:40] that."
[1:38:41] But so that we would learn to humble
[1:38:43] ourselves
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; and say, "Father, hold my hand."
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Remember brother Brandham talking of
[1:38:50] that time that Billy Paul needed to go
[1:38:53] to the bathroom. It was dark and he
[1:38:56] said, "Daddy, I I got to go bathroom."
[1:38:58] He go, "Okay." He said, "Billy, just
[1:38:59] just right down the hall. just go. But
[1:39:02] daddy, I want you to take me. I'm just
[1:39:04] tired, Billy. Just just go on. It's It's
[1:39:07] okay. Dad's here. Oh, Daddy, I I want
[1:39:09] you. So, okay. So, he got up and he
[1:39:13] said, "Daddy, let me hold your hand."
[1:39:15] So, he held his hand. Well, there was a
[1:39:16] toy in in the darkness in that room and
[1:39:19] Billy Paul fell. I believe I'm telling
[1:39:20] the story right, something to that
[1:39:22] effect. But Billy Paul fell
[1:39:26] and when he got up, he looked at his dad
[1:39:29] and said, "Daddy, why don't you just
[1:39:31] hold my hand?"
[1:39:33] And I think that's the way we want is
[1:39:35] not to hold God's hand, but God, hold my
[1:39:38] hand.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; You know the dangers. You know where
[1:39:41] we're at. You know the traps. You know
[1:39:43] everything about it.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; For sure.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; God, just hold my hand.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; I'm nothing without you,
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; but I am everything with you in me. Can
[1:39:52] you say
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham, he says, see, so
[1:39:58] he says, then God can't use that because
[1:40:00] you can't do nothing. But if you'll
[1:40:03] yield yourself to God and let him do it.
[1:40:05] You say, "Well, Brother Brandham, I know
[1:40:07] I'm a teacher." Well, as long as you're
[1:40:10] the teacher, well, he won't get very
[1:40:12] far. But the Holy Spirit is our teacher.
[1:40:15] Sure it is. God sent the Holy Spirit to
[1:40:17] be tutor over the church, right? See, so
[1:40:21] what he does is he raises men to teach
[1:40:23] through them. What he does is he raises
[1:40:26] men to speak through them, to preach the
[1:40:28] gospel through them. He raises up up uh
[1:40:31] uh mothers to raise their children
[1:40:33] through them.
[1:40:35] Hello.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; He raises us fathers, amen, to to lead
[1:40:39] our children through through the father,
[1:40:42] through us.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; It's God doing the leading through us.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Sure it is.
[1:40:50] Brother Bram said if the musicians will
[1:40:53] come. But Brother Bram said God
[1:40:55] sometimes takes his people out like that
[1:40:57] and shaves a few of their own wheels
[1:40:59] off. That's right.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Shows them that they can't do just what
[1:41:02] they wanted to do.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? They're not in
[1:41:06] liberty to do what they want to do
[1:41:08] before they could come into full power
[1:41:10] and be a love servant to Christ. They
[1:41:12] have to be shaved off and then
[1:41:14] presented. Sometimes he takes them to
[1:41:16] the desert to do that. to shave them off
[1:41:19] and then bring them out, the anointed
[1:41:21] one, to fulfill the purpose that he's
[1:41:23] ordained them to be.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he does.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; I've heard it said, and I don't know if
[1:41:31] the prophet said it or who, but he said,
[1:41:32] "God can do more with one man in five
[1:41:35] minutes than a man can do in a
[1:41:38] lifetime."
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; When God can get us in his hands
[1:41:44] and control us.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think this is where we're
[1:41:48] at. There's spirits that are everywhere
[1:41:53] and and they're not just looking at age
[1:41:56] groups, but they they get into our
[1:41:59] children. And I don't say our children
[1:42:01] are demonpossessed. You should never
[1:42:03] believe that.
[1:42:05] But I do say just as the spirit works on
[1:42:07] us sometimes in a bad mood, spirit takes
[1:42:11] advantage of that. Satan tries to take
[1:42:13] advantage of things. we get up wake up
[1:42:15] on the wrong side of the bed or we have
[1:42:18] he he'll he'll cause a certain crisis
[1:42:20] and then get us try to get our spirit in
[1:42:23] an uproar.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Well, he he'll try to work on our
[1:42:26] children to get our children to do
[1:42:28] things and act things. Even didn't
[1:42:30] brother Brown say that like when when
[1:42:32] the prayer line was getting ready to go
[1:42:34] or the end of the service or maybe an
[1:42:36] altar call then Satan will move on a
[1:42:38] little kid and cause him to start
[1:42:39] screaming or something like that.
[1:42:42] Satan does that. doesn't mean that the
[1:42:44] that kid's demonpossessed. It's just
[1:42:46] Satan working through them. So, see, we
[1:42:48] understand as believers that that that
[1:42:51] when our children are acting up or or
[1:42:54] well, our husbands or our wives or or an
[1:42:57] and act in the church is starting to
[1:42:59] trying to create that's that's a spirit
[1:43:02] that Satan is trying to move in to cause
[1:43:05] havoc.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; But we are anointed.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:13] We are anointed. And if we can
[1:43:14] understand that, when you're at YOUR
[1:43:17] WITS END AND SAY, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
[1:43:20] DO." REMEMBER, you're anointed.
[1:43:26] God didn't cause you to to have a family
[1:43:29] on to fail with that family. God didn't
[1:43:31] call me to be a preacher and to fail.
[1:43:34] GOD DIDN'T CALL US TO TO BE WHATEVER
[1:43:37] WE'RE DOING AND FAIL. But as long as
[1:43:41] you're in the line of duty, remember
[1:43:42] that as long as Moses and the children
[1:43:45] of Israel was in THE LINE OF DUTY, GOD
[1:43:47] STAYED with him. Through his failures,
[1:43:50] his mistakes, and his ups and his downs,
[1:43:53] and all of those things, God stayed with
[1:43:56] him because he was in the line of duty.
[1:44:00] Can you say amen?
[1:44:03] Aren't you glad you're in the line of
[1:44:04] duty? We ain't stopping. WE AIN'T
[1:44:06] QUITTING. WE'RE NOT UH UH UH uh uh
[1:44:09] stepping off to do our own thing. WE'RE
[1:44:11] RIGHT IN THE LINE OF DUTY. No matter how
[1:44:13] hard, no matter how challenging, NO
[1:44:15] MATTER WHAT GIANT stands in our way, I'm
[1:44:17] anointed.
[1:44:19] I'm anointed.
[1:44:22] Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:44:26] Amen. What's up?
[1:44:36] Oh,
[1:44:37] I have nothing.

[1:50:03] of Jehovah,
[1:50:10] God Almighty.
[1:50:17] Oh prince
[1:50:20] of peace,
[1:50:26] trles
[1:50:28] vanish,
[1:50:33] hearts
[1:50:35] are mening
[1:50:41] in the presence.
[1:50:48] of the king. Can we stand to our feet
[1:50:52] and sing it now?
[1:50:55] Oh, he entered the praise.
[1:51:14] Bless the name of the Lord,
[1:51:18] Prince of Peace.
[1:51:25] Trles
[1:51:26] vanish,
[1:51:32] hearts are bended
[1:51:40] in the presence
[1:51:46] of the king.
[1:51:51] as they just play softly.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you is our prayer.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; May God be with you.
[1:52:02] May he use you in a great way.
[1:52:06] Amen. To complete the work.
[1:52:10] I truly believe that we're not going to
[1:52:14] have too many days left
[1:52:18] and we want to do all that we can for
[1:52:22] the kingdom of God and whatever he would
[1:52:24] want us to do. May God help us to be
[1:52:28] surrendered to even
[1:52:31] just
[1:52:33] well my prayer is God just shave me
[1:52:36] strip me of all my will
[1:52:41] that I can do something for the Lord.
[1:52:44] Amen.
[1:52:46] And uh just keep one another in our
[1:52:48] prayer. And um the prayer requests that
[1:52:52] were mentioned, we want to keep them in
[1:52:54] our prayer. And um uh brother Wayne, you
[1:52:59] know, will be here the 19th, 20th, and
[1:53:02] 21st, so in couple weeks, I guess. And
[1:53:06] so tell your friends about it. And I
[1:53:09] encourage you to to pray, pray for the
[1:53:12] meeting. And um we just, you know, my
[1:53:17] heart's desires, not that God would
[1:53:20] bring in souls. So, I'd love for that to
[1:53:22] happen, but just the needs that are here
[1:53:25] present and I know we got some that need
[1:53:29] the Holy Ghost and I'd love to see that
[1:53:32] take place and and uh healing miracles.
[1:53:38] And so, um I just believe that's that's
[1:53:41] and it's not brother Wayne that has that
[1:53:44] uh he's he's not the magic guy,
[1:53:48] but I believe he has dynamic ministry.
[1:53:50] And I believe if we come do our part and
[1:53:53] that is come expecting God, be prayed up
[1:53:56] and presenting the needs before God and
[1:53:59] let God just have his way. I I believe
[1:54:02] God will do that. Amen. And so uh tell
[1:54:06] tell folks about the meeting and uh we
[1:54:10] we won't be feeding anyone. Um, I think
[1:54:13] we were going to try to have something
[1:54:16] uh uh Sunday uh of the meeting, but
[1:54:21] other than that, we won't be feeding
[1:54:22] anyone. So, might let people know about
[1:54:25] that. But uh uh there are plenty of
[1:54:28] restaurants and so we'd love for anyone
[1:54:31] to come and be a part of it. But God
[1:54:34] bless you and uh just good to have again
[1:54:37] different ones that out out uh have them
[1:54:40] have y'all home and I hope everybody had
[1:54:43] a good time of fellowship with friends
[1:54:46] and family.
[1:54:48] Amen. Let's just bow our heads as we
[1:54:51] dismiss. Uh brother Terry, do you want
[1:54:54] to dismiss us?
