[51:59] this morning
[52:01] Lord don't let it just be a man a bit
[52:04] Lord help me just to get myself out of

[52:15] within his father I pray Lord that you
[52:18] would do a creative work
[52:20] Lord no doubt there are many battles and
[52:23] and things that your people are going
[52:25] through and Satan fighting on every hand
[52:29] but I pray that you silence the enemy
[52:31] Lord and build Faith within our hearts
[52:34] today Father may we be ever fervent
[52:38] about this message and about our
[52:41] personal walk with you father and ever
[52:43] determined not to look back we pray
[52:47] father and Lord we just now just ask you
[52:51] to come in Jesus Christ's name amen
[52:56] praise the Lord the book of Hosea the
[53:01] 12th chapter
[53:03] and the
[53:07] the 10th verse
[53:09] but it says I have also spoken by the
[53:11] prophets and I have multiplied visions
[53:14] and used similitudes
[53:16] by the ministry of the prophets amen you
[53:21] can have your seats this morning
[53:29] I believe that we're we're living in the
[53:32] closing hour of time and
[53:35] we can't put enough emphasis on that
[53:40] of just really it's been preached about
[53:43] and said so many times throughout the
[53:46] ages but
[53:48] we Are Witnesses of the reality of it
[53:52] just by the scriptures unfolding
[53:55] and prophecy being fulfilled and
[53:58] it would have ever thought that we'd be
[54:00] living in an America the way it is today
[54:04] and the challenges that we have and
[54:08] uh seeing things that we're seeing and
[54:12] it it truly is uh the end of time
[54:17] and as the prophet would tell us it's
[54:20] the greatest time for it's the blending
[54:23] of Time and Eternity
[54:27] and
[54:28] we we believe that the the changing of
[54:32] the body is imminent to the believer
[54:35] it's uh uh the catching away the
[54:39] Millennium the the marriage supper of
[54:42] the Lamb is soon at hand all of these
[54:45] things that that the Saints of old have
[54:48] have longed to see and and
[54:52] um but but as we look at it at not all
[54:55] all of these things aren't just going to
[54:57] happen to people randomly
[55:01] um uh is it's not going to be that way
[55:04] and and people aren't just being picked
[55:07] randomly for these uh events and things
[55:10] like that uh but we know that this is
[55:14] the time of preparation this is the uh
[55:18] we're preparing for it we're not just
[55:20] waiting we're preparing every service
[55:24] every day we're preparing and and
[55:29] um so brother Branham would tell us in
[55:31] several here quotes but uh so I'm just
[55:34] going to read them but he says before
[55:36] the church can have the Rapture it's got
[55:38] to have rapturing faith
[55:40] uh says now God's just now loosening up
[55:43] the church everywhere getting in order
[55:46] so now now so he can get it into get
[55:49] into the Rapture got to give it
[55:51] rapturing Faith before it can go in the
[55:53] Rapture I believe that through those
[55:56] seven Thunders will be revealed in the
[55:59] last days in order to get the bride
[56:02] together for rapturing Faith because
[56:04] what we got right now wouldn't be a we
[56:07] wouldn't be able to do it now you know
[56:09] he's talking years down back so so we we
[56:13] can't apply that today because we do
[56:15] have what it takes uh for Rapture and
[56:19] Faith amen another one they're Mysteries
[56:23] amen talking of the seven Thunders
[56:25] they're Mysteries we don't know what
[56:26] they are yet but my opinion they'll be
[56:29] revealed right away and when they do uh
[56:33] it'll give faith for that Rapture and
[56:35] Grace for that church to move out in the
[56:38] church age book what was in those
[56:40] Thunders no one knows but we need to
[56:43] know everybody say we need to know it's
[56:46] important that God would give it to us
[56:48] because we needed to know I mean I mean
[56:50] we're at the end of time and and we
[56:53] needed a way of Escape we needed to get
[56:55] out of here we need to and what we had
[56:57] back then what the church had that it
[57:00] wasn't ready for it it couldn't Luther
[57:01] couldn't bring the church into a
[57:03] rapturing uh uh Wesley or even the
[57:06] Pentecost could not bring it into a
[57:08] Rapture uh so what was in those Thunders
[57:12] no one knows but we need to know and it
[57:16] will take not a reformer but he says it
[57:19] will take a profit to get the Revelation
[57:21] because God has no other way of bringing
[57:25] out his scriptural Revelations except by
[57:27] a prophet the word always came by
[57:30] prophet and always will and that is uh
[57:34] that this is the law of God is evident
[57:37] by even a casual search of scripture the
[57:41] changing god with unchanging ways
[57:43] invariably sent his prophet in every age
[57:46] where people had strayed from divine
[57:50] order with both the theologians and the
[57:54] people having departed from the word God
[57:56] always sent his servant to these people
[57:59] but apart from theologians in order to
[58:03] correct false teaching and lead the
[58:05] people back to God
[58:08] another place now this messenger of
[58:10] Malachi 4 and Revelations 10 7 is going
[58:13] to do two things one according to
[58:15] Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the
[58:18] children to the fathers two he will
[58:20] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[58:22] thunders in Revelations 10 which are the
[58:25] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[58:28] it will be by these divinely revealed
[58:32] mystery truths that literally turn the
[58:35] hearts of the children to the
[58:37] Pentecostal fathers amen and and and
[58:40] brother Branham called it seven thunders
[58:43] of Revelation and then he said may he
[58:47] show may he God show the bride how to
[58:51] prepare for the great translation faith
[58:55] now church this is what's happening
[58:58] today by the message of the hour it is
[59:02] showing you and I how to prepare for
[59:06] this translation because we realize that
[59:09] it's not just going to randomly happen
[59:11] to us it's not just going to one day
[59:14] just all of a sudden it clicks and we go
[59:17] it's it's not that it's it's the message
[59:20] of the hour and church we've had this
[59:23] message for 60 years or so or close to
[59:27] it of uh I don't know how how long it's
[59:31] been close to that since that and since
[59:33] the prophets left the scene
[59:35] but uh um so we've had this message and
[59:40] I I'll be honest most people have fought
[59:42] with it they have debated it they have
[59:46] put their own opinions to it they have
[59:49] allowed things to come in with it and
[59:52] and and all of these things and and and
[59:55] which that is Satan's way of doing it
[59:58] but this message is pure it is right it
[1:00:03] is perfect you have received a perfect
[1:00:06] word in this day
[1:00:07] no matter what men do with it and what
[1:00:10] they say about it and and all of these
[1:00:12] things you've got your your extremes
[1:00:15] this way extremes that way you you got
[1:00:17] one you know we don't need don't need a
[1:00:20] Ministry and just stay with the prophet
[1:00:23] just stay and play tapes then you got
[1:00:25] one that is so far-fetched out this way
[1:00:28] that they're adding to and they become
[1:00:30] the final that they become the voice of
[1:00:32] what brother Branham has said then and
[1:00:34] all of these things and and uh uh but in
[1:00:38] all of the confusion and all of the
[1:00:41] fussing and the fighting and the feuding
[1:00:43] and all of this there is a bride being
[1:00:47] prepared because all the the the the the
[1:00:51] weirdos that are taking this message and
[1:00:54] taking it to extremes and all of these
[1:00:56] things and I'm I I say weirdos I don't
[1:00:59] know what else to call them but uh uh
[1:01:02] the extremists that are taking this pure
[1:01:04] message and bringing it into extremes
[1:01:06] time ain't stopping for them time is not
[1:01:11] stopping people may be getting confused
[1:01:13] but this elect is not being confused
[1:01:15] she's staying right with the message of
[1:01:18] the hour can you say Amen yes we've
[1:01:21] we've had all kinds of crazy things in
[1:01:23] Ministry to where people say well I
[1:01:25] don't believe in Ministry we're just
[1:01:27] going to stay and play tapes and and it
[1:01:29] does not matter what they think God's
[1:01:31] word Still Remains the Same if there's a
[1:01:34] fake there's a there's a real if if
[1:01:37] there's a one that is all messed up
[1:01:39] there's someone that has stand balanced
[1:01:41] with the word of God Amen and so uh uh
[1:01:45] but but it's it's preparing and this is
[1:01:48] what's happening today now the prophet
[1:01:50] will go on in another place we found out
[1:01:53] what the thunder means that's perfectly
[1:01:56] we know that the Thunder everybody say
[1:01:58] the Thunder was the voice of God
[1:02:02] they have made Thunders a mystery these
[1:02:04] days and all that but it's really simple
[1:02:06] the Thunder was the voice of God when
[1:02:09] the seal opened amen and so uh uh the
[1:02:13] the Thunders isn't something that is
[1:02:16] different from what's already written in
[1:02:18] the Bible uh any Revelation that that a
[1:02:23] true prophet of God will get has to come
[1:02:26] from the Bible ain't that right now it's
[1:02:29] open to us because an intellectual mind
[1:02:32] cannot understand this Bible I I
[1:02:34] challenge you go read this Bible you
[1:02:36] know and and and get one of these boys
[1:02:39] to read this Bible every day of their
[1:02:41] life till they're a thousand years old
[1:02:42] and they'll still not understand this
[1:02:44] without a prophet it just ain't gonna
[1:02:46] happen and yet it's laying there it's
[1:02:49] it's it's there amen see so uh uh we we
[1:02:53] find that uh uh uh uh the the voice of
[1:02:57] God is is the thunder is the voice of
[1:03:00] God now brother Branham said this all
[1:03:03] this idea of interceding with Jude for
[1:03:06] politics and interceding with Saint
[1:03:08] Cecilia for something else excuse me
[1:03:12] that's nonsense I don't say them people
[1:03:14] are not honest and sincere
[1:03:17] and there are a lot of honest and since
[1:03:19] their people still going to church you
[1:03:21] know and and he says but I don't say
[1:03:24] you're not sincere in doing it if you do
[1:03:27] but you're wrong you're sincerely wrong
[1:03:30] that's right they say well this Angel
[1:03:33] this appeared to Saint Boniface and said
[1:03:36] this and that and the other and they
[1:03:38] they can say this I don't doubt that a
[1:03:42] bit in my mind but what somebody saw the
[1:03:44] vision I don't doubt what Joseph Smith
[1:03:47] saw the vision but it wasn't according
[1:03:49] to the rest of the word I don't doubt
[1:03:52] that Kenneth Hagin didn't see a big old
[1:03:54] angel uh and he describes that he saw
[1:03:56] this big old angel and it was so many
[1:03:59] feet high and da da da da I don't doubt
[1:04:01] that I ain't going to argue with that
[1:04:03] but it's not against it's not according
[1:04:04] to the word it has to come with the rest
[1:04:07] of the word can you say amen that's
[1:04:10] right he said so therefore it's wrong
[1:04:12] see it's wrong to me he said that's the
[1:04:15] way the church ages and see and all the
[1:04:18] rest of it and when anybody thinks that
[1:04:20] he has those seven Thunders if it does
[1:04:23] not compare with the rest of the word
[1:04:25] there's something wrong here it's got to
[1:04:28] come thus said the Lord for this is the
[1:04:30] book this is the revelation of Jesus
[1:04:33] Christ in its entirety so what you need
[1:04:36] for rapturing Faith lay is right here in
[1:04:39] this Bible it just took a prophet to
[1:04:41] divinely open this the mysteries of this
[1:04:45] Bible up ain't that right
[1:04:47] so we can truly say that the Divine that
[1:04:51] the seven Thunders are revealed and this
[1:04:54] is an open book to us ain't that right
[1:04:57] not reading from a closed mind but God
[1:05:00] has opened the enlightened the eyes of
[1:05:02] our understanding which Paul that's what
[1:05:04] Paul prayed that the eyes of our
[1:05:06] understanding would be enlightened that
[1:05:08] we may know what is the hope of his
[1:05:10] calling amen and so uh uh he said see
[1:05:15] someone has been many has been saying to
[1:05:19] me and theologians said brother Branham
[1:05:21] if the Lord God said you see with your
[1:05:24] experience that the Lord has given you
[1:05:25] for his people humbling saying this and
[1:05:28] said you you would be eligible to write
[1:05:31] a Bible yourself your your word if God
[1:05:34] has manifested and I said that might be
[1:05:37] true see he was trying to catch me and I
[1:05:40] said but you see I couldn't do that see
[1:05:43] he said well why couldn't you you have
[1:05:46] all the qualifications I I said but you
[1:05:49] look one word cannot be added or taken
[1:05:52] away he said well them seven Thunders
[1:05:55] you see uh wouldn't them seven Thunders
[1:05:57] blasting out uh won't that be a
[1:06:00] revelation to be given to some man I
[1:06:02] said no sir it would be adding something
[1:06:05] to it or taking something from it it's
[1:06:08] all revealed in there and the Seven
[1:06:11] Seals opened up the revelation of what
[1:06:14] that was ain't that right that's what it
[1:06:17] was see it's still in the word you see
[1:06:20] you can't get out of that word you won't
[1:06:22] leave the word and God's spirit will
[1:06:25] never never leave that word it'll stay
[1:06:29] right with the word blinding some and
[1:06:31] opening the eyes of others it'll always
[1:06:34] do it ain't that right think of that the
[1:06:37] gospel blind some the opening of the
[1:06:39] word will blind some and Open the Eyes
[1:06:42] of others but that's the that's the way
[1:06:44] it is so the seven Thunders were reveal
[1:06:47] field in the opening of the seals and
[1:06:51] and that is what prepares the church for
[1:06:54] a rapturing faith and and for a Rapture
[1:06:57] ain't that right so now when the seventh
[1:07:01] angel was sounded the Bible says the
[1:07:03] Mysteries were finished finished we
[1:07:07] don't need him to come back and finish
[1:07:09] some mystery it's finished ain't that
[1:07:13] right it's done it's revealed and so
[1:07:15] brother Branham he would go on and say
[1:07:18] the book is absolutely a sealed book
[1:07:20] until the Seven Seals is broken it is
[1:07:24] sealed up with Seven Seals the seals
[1:07:26] will not be released until the message
[1:07:29] of the seventh angel so we are presuming
[1:07:32] I'm just reading a bunch of quotes we
[1:07:34] are presuming but the genuine everybody
[1:07:36] say the genuine revelation of God will
[1:07:40] be made perfect in that sounding and
[1:07:43] Vindicated truth ain't that right a man
[1:07:47] sees so I I say it this way you cannot
[1:07:50] read this Bible with an intellectual
[1:07:52] mind you cannot just sit there brother
[1:07:54] Brown said you cannot read the Bible
[1:07:56] like you would a newspaper or a magazine
[1:07:58] or whatever amen and and and you could
[1:08:01] read a a book and and and it gives you
[1:08:04] all the details and all that you cannot
[1:08:06] read this that way it you have to be in
[1:08:09] the spirit of it it it's between the
[1:08:12] lines everything you're what you're
[1:08:14] reading is great but you need
[1:08:16] inspiration to put it all together to
[1:08:19] make it one beautiful picture ain't that
[1:08:21] right amen that's right and this is why
[1:08:24] we we got to not get in the spirit of
[1:08:26] the world but get in the spirit of God
[1:08:28] it's time to get in the spirit of God
[1:08:31] Spirit of Revelation not trying to make
[1:08:33] you know uh uh uh to make something big
[1:08:36] out of something that's not it at all it
[1:08:39] is so simple that even the smart will
[1:08:41] override uh or I will not see it see but
[1:08:44] though the elect will ain't that right
[1:08:47] but now the Revelation is not made known
[1:08:49] until the lamb takes the book and breaks
[1:08:52] the seals and opens the book and the
[1:08:55] Lambs got to take the book it's his it's
[1:08:59] his book this word is his ain't that
[1:09:01] right it's his mind that that was
[1:09:04] written it it's it's his word so he says
[1:09:07] now no matter no man in heaven no man in
[1:09:10] earth Bishop Pope cardinal state
[1:09:12] presbyter or whatever he is can break
[1:09:14] them sealed uh uh or reveal the book but
[1:09:18] the lamb we have probed and presumed and
[1:09:23] stumbled and wondered that's the reason
[1:09:25] we're all in such a confusion but with
[1:09:28] the Divine promise that this book of
[1:09:31] redemption will be perfectly opened by
[1:09:33] the lamb and the seals thereof will be
[1:09:36] loosed by the lamb in the last days in
[1:09:38] which we are living now ain't that right
[1:09:42] so so then the seven Thunders hold the
[1:09:46] secret to rapturing Faith I'll set this
[1:09:49] way the message of the hour is the
[1:09:52] secret to rapturing Faith don't you
[1:09:55] don't have to go get all these
[1:09:56] translations you don't have to get all
[1:09:57] this literature you don't have to go to
[1:09:59] conferences and Bible schools and all of
[1:10:02] that just play the tapes amen come to
[1:10:05] church and hear the message of the hour
[1:10:07] being preached and don't come with the
[1:10:09] critical heart don't come with some uh
[1:10:12] backslidden heart in a vax living
[1:10:14] condition your mind wandering
[1:10:16] everywhere's come prepared to hear and
[1:10:18] receive from God can you say amen that's
[1:10:22] exactly right see and so uh it took the
[1:10:26] ministry of a prophet to reveal them uh
[1:10:29] so again the ministry is the agency uh
[1:10:33] uh uh in which a purpose is fulfilled
[1:10:36] and a minister is part of the ministry
[1:10:39] for he is the agent that God uses I I
[1:10:43] thought of First Corinthians 9 17 the
[1:10:45] Apostle Paul which was also a a prophet
[1:10:49] uh first Angel messenger he said this a
[1:10:52] dis dispensation of the Gospel is
[1:10:55] committed unto me to think of that God
[1:10:58] would commit such a important part of
[1:11:02] his mind and Revelation a man to give it
[1:11:06] unto a man and then that man must be
[1:11:09] true that man must be faithful that man
[1:11:12] must not he must not waver he must oh he
[1:11:16] go he went through trials did not Paul
[1:11:17] go through them amen he was stoned three
[1:11:20] times and left for dead and he was
[1:11:22] beaten he was Shackled he was
[1:11:25] Shipwrecked he he went through all kinds
[1:11:28] of stuff and yet God committed the
[1:11:32] gospel unto him amen and such was the
[1:11:35] the responsibility that Paul had that
[1:11:38] brother Branham would come in the final
[1:11:40] age the the most important of all times
[1:11:43] and he'd say I preached what Paul
[1:11:46] preached and the people said were
[1:11:48] resting on it we're resting on it can
[1:11:52] you say amen amen see so uh uh uh in
[1:11:55] another place Paul would say the gospel
[1:11:58] of the uncircumcision was committed unto
[1:12:01] me amen First Timothy 1 11 according to
[1:12:05] the Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God
[1:12:08] which was committed to my trust and I
[1:12:11] think Christ Jesus our lord who hath
[1:12:14] enabled me for that he counted me
[1:12:17] faithful putting me in into the ministry
[1:12:20] now we're talking a Ministry of prophets
[1:12:22] but later on we're going to get to us a
[1:12:24] Ministry a man but he counted me
[1:12:27] faithful everybody say he counted me
[1:12:29] faithful he counted me faithful now
[1:12:33] think of that putting me into the
[1:12:36] ministry a man second Corinthians 5 20.
[1:12:40] then now then we are ambassadors for
[1:12:45] Christ as though God this beseech You by
[1:12:49] us God talking through us to you and
[1:12:52] beseeching you through us or by us we
[1:12:56] pray you in Christ that be ye reconciled
[1:13:00] to God see so so it's a Ministry now the
[1:13:03] world is trying to get its program over
[1:13:06] uh uh look at the laws that are being
[1:13:09] passed um Democrats and Republicans
[1:13:11] alike are trying to get their agenda uh
[1:13:14] over to the to the people and get it in
[1:13:17] working order and and these things and
[1:13:20] we know good and well someone's behind
[1:13:22] the scenes someone's doing things that
[1:13:24] that maybe we don't know uh of course we
[1:13:27] say God again it is you know but but at
[1:13:29] the same time there's human uh uh behind
[1:13:32] this there is no way Biden God in I'm
[1:13:35] just going to be honest I'm I'm I'm a
[1:13:37] big doubter on that one there is no way
[1:13:39] that Biden God in sitting in the
[1:13:41] basement and and all of these things
[1:13:43] someone got him in someone and we can
[1:13:47] say well it was the will of God but I'm
[1:13:48] talking about men someone was behind the
[1:13:51] scenes because they've got an agenda
[1:13:53] that they're trying to push they're
[1:13:55] trying to push they're trying to close
[1:13:56] out uh Christianity they're trying to
[1:13:58] close us up they're trying to shut us up
[1:14:01] they're trying to do away with America
[1:14:02] as as a Sovereign Nation and it blows my
[1:14:06] mind but they're they're doing it and
[1:14:08] and we're seeing the laws pass left and
[1:14:11] right left and right left and right amen
[1:14:13] and so uh uh so so they're they're
[1:14:16] they're they're they're trying to get
[1:14:17] World Order and and on all these things
[1:14:20] and whoever's involved in it they're
[1:14:22] pushing their agenda trying to get it
[1:14:24] out Democrats and Republicans fighting
[1:14:26] and all these things well then there's
[1:14:28] the churches that are trying to get
[1:14:29] their agenda over in and and and and and
[1:14:32] and things and denominations and and and
[1:14:35] and and things and and and and and then
[1:14:38] then on top of all this Satan is trying
[1:14:40] to get his agenda over which we know
[1:14:43] most of the churches are just his pawns
[1:14:45] and and and he's he he's the god of the
[1:14:48] world and and and the kingdoms of these
[1:14:51] this world is his and and all of that
[1:14:54] and and so he is trying very hard to get
[1:14:57] his agenda over uh um and and and and
[1:15:01] and I say this he's succeeding he he is
[1:15:05] succeeding uh uh in this world and and
[1:15:08] in his agenda uh uh and said you know
[1:15:11] brother Brown said brother the lids come
[1:15:12] off of hell and streams of demon powers
[1:15:14] pouring from everywhere it's conquered
[1:15:17] the Nations it's conquered politics till
[1:15:19] it's rotten to the core it's conquered
[1:15:21] the churches till they know nothing but
[1:15:22] denomination ain't that right we look
[1:15:25] and demonic spirits have invaded uh uh
[1:15:28] the churches as much as they have
[1:15:31] invaded Hollywood and and the The Honky
[1:15:34] Tonks and politics and everything else
[1:15:37] amen and and we know that demons afflict
[1:15:40] in in the Physical Realm of the the
[1:15:43] Flesh and and uh they they torment and
[1:15:46] the diseases and all these things but
[1:15:49] then the prophet enlightened our eyes
[1:15:51] and he says they also uh in afflict and
[1:15:54] and in in the spiritual realm as well in
[1:15:58] that Spirit realm he said Satan now I
[1:16:00] want you to listen now because because I
[1:16:02] am getting somewhere but but Satan in
[1:16:06] the spirit gives unclean habits
[1:16:09] see and so forth and unbelief you might
[1:16:12] live just as pure and holy and clean and
[1:16:16] yet be a sinner it's your faith that
[1:16:18] saves you many people they're just as
[1:16:20] pure and clean and yet a lot of a lot
[1:16:23] cleaner sometimes than people who
[1:16:25] profess uh Christian lives but yet would
[1:16:29] deny the Holy Ghost and would deny the
[1:16:31] every operation of the power of God
[1:16:33] they're unbelievers no matter and yet
[1:16:35] very religious see and the Antichrist
[1:16:39] spirit is a very religious spirit just
[1:16:41] to the Mark just as religious as it can
[1:16:44] be it's the Antichrist Jesus even said
[1:16:47] it would deceive the very elect if
[1:16:49] possible in that last day in the last
[1:16:52] day that's true so he says then it
[1:16:54] behooves us it behooves you to know
[1:16:57] where your uh uh where you're doing what
[1:17:00] you're doing where you're standing and
[1:17:02] what you're talking to ain't that right
[1:17:05] so so Satan tried very hard to get his
[1:17:08] agenda demons come on on so-called
[1:17:11] Christians brother brand I'm talking
[1:17:13] about so-called Christians not not Holy
[1:17:15] Ghost Field Christians but he said now
[1:17:17] remember those ministers down there and
[1:17:19] that that was them prophets they were
[1:17:21] prophets they were religious men
[1:17:23] offering a sacrifice they were just as
[1:17:25] religious as the teachers of this day
[1:17:28] but brother they was a long ways from
[1:17:30] knowing the truth see don't you see how
[1:17:33] religious the devil is the devil's not
[1:17:35] an anti no anti-great-big thing like
[1:17:38] communism all against Christianity
[1:17:40] that's not see that's that's just uh he
[1:17:44] said see that that's just the devil but
[1:17:46] it's not the Antichrist he said that's
[1:17:49] just all the of the devil but that's not
[1:17:51] Antichrist the Antichrist is very
[1:17:54] religious very religious he repeats it
[1:17:58] was a religious spirit that crucified
[1:18:00] Christ it's always been a religious
[1:18:03] World a religious people that crucify
[1:18:05] defies it's the religious people that
[1:18:07] was against the true Christ it was the
[1:18:09] religious prophets that was against uh
[1:18:12] uh the true prophet mataya it's the
[1:18:15] religious people of the day that's
[1:18:17] against the message of God ain't that
[1:18:19] right see so so another place uh notice
[1:18:23] what Jesus said to the religious people
[1:18:24] in Matthew 23 and 27 he says woe to you
[1:18:29] uh uh scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites
[1:18:31] for you are like undewighted septicers
[1:18:34] and which indeed appear beautiful
[1:18:37] outward but are within full of dead
[1:18:39] men's bones and all of all uncleanness
[1:18:42] even so you are you also outwardly
[1:18:46] appear righteous unto men but within you
[1:18:49] are full of hypocrisy and iniquity woe
[1:18:51] unto you scribes and Pharisees
[1:18:53] Hypocrites because you build the tombs
[1:18:55] of the prophets and garnish the skep
[1:18:57] scepters of the righteous and say if we
[1:19:01] had been in the Days of Our Father we
[1:19:03] would have not been partakers with him
[1:19:05] the blood of the prophets wherefore you
[1:19:07] be Witnesses unto yourself that you are
[1:19:09] the children of them which kill the
[1:19:11] prophets he said see fill ye up then and
[1:19:15] the measure of your fathers you serpents
[1:19:17] and you Generation of Vipers how can you
[1:19:19] escape the damnation of Hell wherefore
[1:19:22] behold I send unto you prophets and wise
[1:19:25] men and scribes and some of them you
[1:19:27] shall kill and crucify and some of them
[1:19:30] you shall Scourge in your synagogues and
[1:19:33] persecute them from City to city that
[1:19:36] upon you may come all the righteous
[1:19:39] blood shed upon the Earth from the blood
[1:19:41] of righteous Abel unto the blood of
[1:19:44] zechariah's son of uh barakas or
[1:19:48] something like that uh whom you slew
[1:19:50] between the temple and the altar verily
[1:19:53] I say unto you all these things shall
[1:19:55] come upon this generation now notice all
[1:19:58] Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that kill us
[1:20:01] the prophets and stone is them which are
[1:20:04] sin unto thee how often would I have
[1:20:07] gathered thy children together even as a
[1:20:10] hymn gathereth her chickens under her
[1:20:12] wings and you would not watch now it's
[1:20:16] interesting to me that these religious
[1:20:17] people are Church going uh people and
[1:20:21] and yet he the manifested word if I say
[1:20:24] the manifested word for that's exactly
[1:20:27] what he was he was the Fulfillment of
[1:20:29] Prophecy he was the manifested word and
[1:20:32] he could not gather them religious
[1:20:35] Church going I mean uh piety and and and
[1:20:38] you couldn't point a finger to them in
[1:20:41] in only Jesus in that day could point a
[1:20:43] finger to them because he could discern
[1:20:45] the very heart of them amen but just the
[1:20:48] your average person they just looks like
[1:20:50] oh man he's holy he's wild I mean look
[1:20:53] at that guy if anyone's going to heaven
[1:20:55] he's going to heaven you know but here
[1:20:57] come the manifested word and he tried to
[1:20:59] gather them unto himself and they would
[1:21:02] not gather okay ain't that right amen
[1:21:05] and so uh he could not gather them uh
[1:21:08] see they were anointed uh uh uh uh
[1:21:12] religious Church going but they were and
[1:21:14] they were were anointed for John 11 51
[1:21:18] talks of how that Caiaphas the high
[1:21:21] priest prophesied and his prophecy was
[1:21:24] true ain't that right but he was the one
[1:21:27] he was one of them that crucified the
[1:21:30] word Christ ain't that right so so then
[1:21:34] we look at catfish but then you find
[1:21:36] there was another more treacherous than
[1:21:37] even him and that was Judas that walk
[1:21:40] with the message of the word and and of
[1:21:43] the hour and the manifested and he he
[1:21:45] took part in the healing of the sick he
[1:21:48] was the one that one of them that Jesus
[1:21:50] gave power to to cast out devils and to
[1:21:52] do this and to do that but when it come
[1:21:55] to the word he crucified it he betrayed
[1:21:58] it yes and so he he walked and talked
[1:22:01] and had Association a man with the
[1:22:04] message of the hour and yet he betrayed
[1:22:06] Jesus Christ see they fulfilled what
[1:22:10] they were supposed to do amen and and
[1:22:12] Jesus no matter how much of anointing he
[1:22:15] had no matter how much of power that he
[1:22:17] had and Authority that he had I mean
[1:22:19] look at the authority they asked him one
[1:22:21] time well what what with what Authority
[1:22:23] do you do these things you understand he
[1:22:25] had that Authority and yet he could not
[1:22:27] gather a man that religious uh bunch of
[1:22:31] people amen see but the word of that day
[1:22:34] couldn't gather them amen and so again
[1:22:37] Matthew 24 24 for there shall arise
[1:22:40] false Christ false prophets and shall
[1:22:43] Source great signs and wonders in so
[1:22:45] much that if it were possible they shall
[1:22:48] deceive the very elected ain't that
[1:22:50] right now we we we wouldn't know a lot
[1:22:54] of this I I remember hearing brother
[1:22:56] Perry in Green in his testimony of how
[1:22:59] that these things just stumped them even
[1:23:01] hearing uh brother biscoll and and
[1:23:04] coming out of the Pentecostal and things
[1:23:06] and they were stumped of how that people
[1:23:08] could prophesy and speak in tongues and
[1:23:11] see dreams and shout and all of these
[1:23:14] things and and yet live like you know uh
[1:23:17] Live Well Hypocrites and things like
[1:23:20] that you know and and it stumped them
[1:23:22] and and and then brother Brandon
[1:23:24] preached that anointed ones at the end
[1:23:26] time and and man it see you know it
[1:23:30] saddled their heart they said and and
[1:23:32] things and and here we're privileged to
[1:23:35] know these things amen well Christ means
[1:23:38] anointed ain't that right and notice
[1:23:40] what brother Brown said they're anointed
[1:23:42] anointed and uh but yet falsely anointed
[1:23:46] to the word falsely anointed to do the
[1:23:49] word they're denominational anointed but
[1:23:52] not to the word ain't that right so
[1:23:55] Jesus said that there will come false
[1:23:57] anointed ones and and brother Brown said
[1:23:59] well you'll ask them well are you Jesus
[1:24:01] and they said I ain't no way you know
[1:24:03] I'm almost an insult I ain't Jesus you
[1:24:05] know and he says they wouldn't stand for
[1:24:07] that but when it comes to an Old Glory I
[1:24:10] got there mourning and it's a genuine
[1:24:12] anointing he said remember campus had it
[1:24:14] too and prophesied so did Balaam have it
[1:24:17] and prophesied but that don't have
[1:24:19] nothing to do with this inside can you
[1:24:21] say Amen unless that was God's seed
[1:24:24] talking about the inside his Gene from
[1:24:27] the beginning predestinated you're
[1:24:29] finished
[1:24:30] you can prophesy dreams dreams run all
[1:24:33] over the place and shout and scream and
[1:24:36] cry and but if there's not a
[1:24:38] predestinated seed you're finished ain't
[1:24:40] that right see so God could gather that
[1:24:43] that little woman at the well he could
[1:24:45] gather her to him Jesus in his ministry
[1:24:49] could gather her and yet she was
[1:24:51] ill-famed she was uh no good she was a
[1:24:53] prostitute and yet she had something
[1:24:56] that he could gather a man and draw her
[1:24:59] with the priest he was holy not blunt
[1:25:02] without blemish no one could put a
[1:25:03] finger and yet the prophet says he was
[1:25:06] had no representation he had no Eternal
[1:25:09] representation and so Jesus could not
[1:25:11] Jesus the message that Jesus brought the
[1:25:14] life that Jesus brought was not a magnet
[1:25:16] Amen to that that priest but it was a
[1:25:19] magnet to that Samaritan woman can you
[1:25:21] say amen amen see and so uh uh there
[1:25:25] therefore it's it's not religious it's
[1:25:28] not anointing it's it's it you know good
[1:25:31] and well uh anointing is part of the
[1:25:34] Christian Life and and these things and
[1:25:36] we'll get into it more later on but uh
[1:25:39] uh but but notice what he says here he
[1:25:41] said that has nothing to do with it a
[1:25:43] cargo bird can count just as much as any
[1:25:46] the rest of them I've seen heathens
[1:25:49] raise and shout and speak in tongues and
[1:25:51] drink blood out of a human skull and
[1:25:53] call on the devil any of them Sensations
[1:25:56] and things forget it
[1:25:58] amen can you say Amen now was brother
[1:26:01] Branham trying to bring us all to dead
[1:26:03] as without Sensations that's nonsense so
[1:26:06] you got that other side that says oh
[1:26:08] it's just formal receive the Holy Ghost
[1:26:10] without sensation you know everybody
[1:26:11] just uh you know and and and and half a
[1:26:14] uh well I say all of them don't have an
[1:26:16] experience with God Amen brother Branham
[1:26:19] never did take the spirit of God away
[1:26:22] from us amen uh uh thinking of uh
[1:26:25] brother Mike Seaver he says every time
[1:26:27] that he went to the Tabernacle when
[1:26:28] brother Brown come unannounced he said
[1:26:30] brother Brown I always I mean he was he
[1:26:32] was Loose as a Goose just felt at home
[1:26:35] dancing shouting with the rest of them
[1:26:37] amen uh because he felt at home amen
[1:26:40] with just the locals amen you saw the
[1:26:42] picture how how did he get on that
[1:26:43] plaque how did he get on the setting on
[1:26:45] that Pulpit there amen with his hands
[1:26:47] lifted up amen he was in the spirit amen
[1:26:51] but you get in the spirit these days and
[1:26:53] people criticize it and getting the
[1:26:55] shout and all that well that's you're
[1:26:56] just working them up I've been in
[1:26:58] Pentecost long enough to know that's not
[1:26:59] working them up we know how to work them
[1:27:02] up we want to work you up we'll work you
[1:27:04] up amen but I don't want any of that and
[1:27:06] and and and so but so brother Brown
[1:27:09] never took away amen the spirit of God
[1:27:11] from the church amen he never he never
[1:27:14] get us to former for formalism to where
[1:27:16] you can't say Amen you can't shout you
[1:27:19] can't stand and glorify God Amen you
[1:27:22] can't be free in the spirit if there's
[1:27:24] ever a time to be free it's in the house
[1:27:26] of God among Believers amen especially
[1:27:29] when the word is going forth amen but
[1:27:31] see uh uh but yet he he says them things
[1:27:35] have nothing to do with them are
[1:27:36] blessings
[1:27:37] ain't that right blessings he says but
[1:27:40] see uh uh he says see it's in it's your
[1:27:43] heart in that word everybody say it's my
[1:27:46] heart in that word and that's Christ
[1:27:49] bring in there and watch it make itself
[1:27:53] known just as it opens up like any other
[1:27:56] seed and declares itself for the age
[1:27:58] it's living in amen so talking about the
[1:28:02] the close deception and thing brother
[1:28:05] Brown said now just a cold formal
[1:28:08] starchy Church see and so forth a
[1:28:12] man-made theology that wouldn't the
[1:28:14] elect would never pay any attention to
[1:28:15] that see you know in in any of these
[1:28:18] denominations that that's not close
[1:28:22] amen see he says but it's up there
[1:28:25] almost like the real thing just leaving
[1:28:27] one word out is all you have to do the
[1:28:31] promise of the age very great time
[1:28:33] Christians everywhere take heed to the
[1:28:36] hour We're living can you say Amen but
[1:28:39] yet if you notice it's in this time of
[1:28:42] deception the greatest deception ever
[1:28:44] that God is calling out a people for his
[1:28:49] name amen he's calling he chose to do it
[1:28:53] he could have done it in any age but
[1:28:55] he'd done it in this age in the most
[1:28:57] treacherous time the most deceiving age
[1:28:59] the age that Satan has perfected his
[1:29:03] Eden and yet he says I will call out a
[1:29:06] people for my name out of that amen or
[1:29:10] now he could have done it when it was in
[1:29:12] its infancy but that wouldn't have been
[1:29:13] a challenge but in the age where Satan
[1:29:16] and all of his Force and and where he is
[1:29:19] now taking the throne by by his own
[1:29:22] people and and he has brought such a
[1:29:25] deception that brother Brown said that
[1:29:27] the people thanking their worshiping God
[1:29:29] when they're all reality they're
[1:29:30] worshiping Satan because they go by
[1:29:33] Sensations instead of the word of God
[1:29:36] and and and their faith is in this and
[1:29:38] their faith is in a gift their faith is
[1:29:40] in in in some Doctrine their faith is in
[1:29:43] some Theologian and and all of these
[1:29:46] things and Satan is working through all
[1:29:48] of this amen and they think well just
[1:29:50] because I go to church and I've claimed
[1:29:51] Jesus and I love Jesus and all of that
[1:29:53] and and they don't realize that they're
[1:29:56] victims to the devil and it is true amen
[1:30:00] you tell them about God said on the
[1:30:01] problem they don't want to hear it amen
[1:30:03] you tell them about the Holy Ghost you
[1:30:04] need to be born again they don't want to
[1:30:06] hear it they got their own ideas and and
[1:30:08] and and these things see but but out of
[1:30:11] all of that God is calling a people for
[1:30:13] his name amen and so brother Brown says
[1:30:17] see it's a people that receives his name
[1:30:19] engaged in his name going to a wedding
[1:30:22] to be married to him Amen to become part
[1:30:25] of him see by predestination
[1:30:29] see just as a man that chooses a right
[1:30:32] wife in life was ordained to be part of
[1:30:35] his body so that is the bride of Christ
[1:30:37] will be and is now from old ordained by
[1:30:41] God to be part of that body aren't you
[1:30:45] glad for that amen so how is he doing it
[1:30:48] how how how is this happening by a
[1:30:51] prophet for he chopped them out by his
[1:30:55] Prophets
[1:30:56] ain't that right chopped out his elect
[1:30:59] see His prophets had thus set the Lord
[1:31:01] because the word came to them and that
[1:31:04] word that came to them was a two-edged
[1:31:06] sword amen and he was a hack and then he
[1:31:10] was shaping that's what this Prophet
[1:31:11] every time he was preaching every time
[1:31:14] laying in that word you you didn't
[1:31:16] realize what he was doing the world
[1:31:18] rejected him and all these things but he
[1:31:20] was he was shaping out a bride cutting
[1:31:23] out a bride for his for for his name
[1:31:27] amen so by the word the prophets hewed
[1:31:31] out God's people you see the word only
[1:31:34] affects the bride it it only affects the
[1:31:37] bride amen now we can get discouraged we
[1:31:40] look at the majority and think well
[1:31:41] nothing's happening but don't get don't
[1:31:43] look at the majority amen don't look at
[1:31:46] what people are doing they're claiming
[1:31:47] to be in the message and what they're
[1:31:49] doing and living backsliding living
[1:31:51] worldly and can't make it to church half
[1:31:53] the time and and and and and can't you
[1:31:55] know you just you wonder about people
[1:31:58] you know and and and it's just almost
[1:32:00] like they they they they they they
[1:32:01] they're going on a trip and yet they
[1:32:04] they stop at the gas station just to get
[1:32:06] maybe you know five dollars worth just a
[1:32:08] little bit you know you gotta watch it
[1:32:10] you know uh uh because you know because
[1:32:12] the the the word about the the air and
[1:32:14] all that so let's just get a little bit
[1:32:16] you know and then they're going and then
[1:32:18] they uh
[1:32:20] I hope we can find a gasket well why
[1:32:22] don't you just fill the thing up you
[1:32:24] know you understand what I'm saying but
[1:32:26] people just live just barely enough
[1:32:28] barely enough and there's Victory here
[1:32:31] there is there there is so much to a
[1:32:33] Christian life amen there's an adoption
[1:32:36] of Sons there's an authority there that
[1:32:38] we could speak over the devil and watch
[1:32:41] him flee over our children over our
[1:32:43] lives over the church over everything
[1:32:46] but if we're just going to live just
[1:32:48] barely just making it barely you'll
[1:32:51] never overcome the world that way you'll
[1:32:53] never be the way God has called you to
[1:32:55] be let the Prophet let the message cut
[1:32:58] you out to be what God intended you to
[1:33:02] be
[1:33:02] [Applause]
[1:33:04] can you say man
[1:33:07] see the word only affects the elect and
[1:33:09] and how many wants the word to affect
[1:33:11] you amen I want the word to affect I I I
[1:33:14] mean if God would have spent take the
[1:33:17] time to send a prophet my way
[1:33:19] he would take the time to send a prophet
[1:33:22] and a prophet even wanted to go out in
[1:33:24] the woods he wanted to go up in the
[1:33:26] mountains and God showed him exactly
[1:33:28] what he would be if he ever done that
[1:33:29] and he saw himself as a bum you remember
[1:33:31] that why God so cared for this elect and
[1:33:35] he knew that that mouthful Prophet was
[1:33:37] the only way to cut out this Bride for
[1:33:39] his name he already said I'd have a
[1:33:42] bride for my name a people out of the
[1:33:44] Gentiles for my name and God already had
[1:33:46] a prophet in mind with the word of God
[1:33:48] to speak that word can you say amen and
[1:33:52] that prophet got discouraged but he
[1:33:54] never gave up God wouldn't let him give
[1:33:55] up because he had you in mind
[1:33:58] and therefore we ought to be sincere
[1:34:00] about this message we ought to give
[1:34:03] everything that we have to this message
[1:34:05] don't you lean this way and don't you
[1:34:07] lean that way and don't you follow that
[1:34:08] and follow this stay with the word of
[1:34:11] God let the word cut you out
[1:34:17] God wants a church to be powerful not
[1:34:19] weak foreign
[1:34:23] God wants a church standing on her feet
[1:34:27] and she is by the prophet's words
[1:34:30] by the message of the hour
[1:34:32] it's our day it's our time
[1:34:35] can you say Amen
[1:34:37] now notice Jesus being the word not just
[1:34:40] the word coming to him as as it did the
[1:34:42] prophets but Jesus was the word
[1:34:45] Jesus was the word that the prophet and
[1:34:49] yet could not could not chop out those
[1:34:52] religious people he wanted together as a
[1:34:55] priest but the man had no representation
[1:34:56] he wanted to
[1:34:58] he tried but the man got mad
[1:35:02] the man always trying to deceive him
[1:35:04] always trying to trip him up
[1:35:07] ain't that right
[1:35:09] so the prophet says he couldn't get that
[1:35:10] priest because the priest was an
[1:35:12] educated scholar a theologian in the
[1:35:14] word but had no representation in Heaven
[1:35:16] Wasn't in God's thinking at all ain't
[1:35:20] that right but notice II Timothy uh uh 2
[1:35:23] and 16 but shun profane in vain bablens
[1:35:27] where they will increase unto more
[1:35:28] ungodliness and their word will eat
[1:35:31] their word will eat at Duff a canker of
[1:35:34] whom is
[1:35:39] felitus and and so who concerning the
[1:35:43] truth have erred now
[1:35:45] go back
[1:35:47] Sean profane and vain Babylons for they
[1:35:50] will increase unto more ungodliness and
[1:35:53] their word or by say their word will eat
[1:35:56] as a canker
[1:35:57] will eat and eat and eat watch what you
[1:36:01] hear watch what you listen to watch what
[1:36:04] you yield your heart to your mind to can
[1:36:06] you say man now amen see a man who
[1:36:10] concerning the truth have aired saying
[1:36:12] that the resurrection is all passed
[1:36:14] already and and they overthrow the faith
[1:36:17] of some nevertheless everybody say
[1:36:20] nevertheless the foundation of God stand
[1:36:22] assure
[1:36:24] their word that does that is deceptive
[1:36:26] that that eats as a canker and all that
[1:36:28] he'll never shake the the foundation of
[1:36:31] God it will never cause the foundation
[1:36:33] of God to crumble amen for the
[1:36:36] foundation of God standing sure having
[1:36:38] this seal the Lord knoweth them that are
[1:36:40] his ain't that right
[1:36:43] now the age that we're living in is a
[1:36:45] laodicean age we all know it it's a
[1:36:48] lukewarm age
[1:36:50] buddy if there's ever a time of fighting
[1:36:53] it's now
[1:36:55] Revelations 3 15 God says I Know Thy
[1:36:58] works that thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:37:01] I would that thou her cold or hot
[1:37:04] so then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[1:37:07] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[1:37:10] out of my mouth
[1:37:12] now brother Brown says in this
[1:37:13] lukewarmness it's a lukewarm age
[1:37:15] lukewarmness Demands a penalty from God
[1:37:21] it Demands a penalty from God and so God
[1:37:24] indicted this age and brought a sentence
[1:37:26] upon them
[1:37:28] and the penalty is that they are spewed
[1:37:31] out of God's mouth
[1:37:34] and notice the prophet said it's the
[1:37:37] church that is spewed out not not the
[1:37:40] individual
[1:37:41] ain't that right not not the individual
[1:37:44] it's it's the church that is is spewed
[1:37:47] out and so he says now we are not we are
[1:37:52] not in the mouth of God but rather we
[1:37:55] are engraved in the palm of his hands
[1:38:00] ain't that right see so and and carried
[1:38:03] in the bosom of God we are in his
[1:38:06] Sheepfold and in his pasture but never
[1:38:08] everybody say never in his mouth
[1:38:12] so what is in his mouth the word
[1:38:15] the word is in his mouth and and this is
[1:38:19] what Jesus said there in Matthew 4 4 man
[1:38:22] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:38:25] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:38:27] mouth of God ain't that right so then
[1:38:31] notice what the prophet said the word is
[1:38:33] supposed to be in our mouth
[1:38:35] the word is supposed to be in our mouth
[1:38:37] what the word of God
[1:38:39] must live in our mouth
[1:38:42] now I think this is important
[1:38:45] because the church is his body do you
[1:38:48] believe that so we're his agency
[1:38:51] if anyone's going to speak it's the
[1:38:53] church
[1:38:56] true it's already prophesied that you're
[1:38:59] going to speak
[1:39:00] as the body of Christ for the spirit and
[1:39:03] the bride and then the prophet says and
[1:39:05] the prophet
[1:39:06] will be saying the same thing
[1:39:09] ain't that right so the word is supposed
[1:39:12] to be in our mouths and and so what is
[1:39:14] uh uh to be in the mouths of the church
[1:39:17] the word the word first Peter 4 and 11
[1:39:21] says if any man speak let him speak as
[1:39:25] the oracles or the word of God
[1:39:28] a man see II Peter 1 21 for the prophecy
[1:39:32] came not in Old Time by the will of man
[1:39:34] but a holy man of God Spade as they were
[1:39:38] moved by the Holy Ghost ain't that right
[1:39:41] see so the church uh uh in this layout
[1:39:45] they've gotten away from the word they
[1:39:48] had gotten away and and brother Branham
[1:39:50] said they are no longer fervent about it
[1:39:52] and when we say the church we're talking
[1:39:54] of the church natural the carnal Church
[1:39:56] they got away from the word in other
[1:39:59] words they were no longer fervent about
[1:40:01] the word and they are lukewarm about it
[1:40:04] see uh uh and then he goes talks about
[1:40:07] like the Baptist they've got their Creed
[1:40:09] and dogmas based on the word of God and
[1:40:12] you cannot shake them from it see they
[1:40:14] have taught that the apostolic days of
[1:40:17] Miracles are over and that there is no
[1:40:19] baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:40:21] subsequent to believing see so they they
[1:40:25] take their doctrines uh uh and they say
[1:40:27] it's based upon the word but when the
[1:40:30] truth comes they don't want the truth
[1:40:32] and and so therefore they become
[1:40:35] lukewarm about it the Methodist teach
[1:40:37] that there is no water baptism based
[1:40:40] upon the word now and that
[1:40:42] sanctification is the baptism of the
[1:40:44] Holy Ghost well we know now that that's
[1:40:46] not true it's it's not true you can be
[1:40:49] Sanctified and not even have the baptism
[1:40:51] of the Holy Ghost amen see but but then
[1:40:54] there's the Church of Christ and they
[1:40:56] major in regenerational baptism and yet
[1:40:59] they go down into the water the prophet
[1:41:01] said Dry Sinners and come up wet Sinners
[1:41:03] amen and they claim that their Doctrine
[1:41:05] is is word based as well but then you've
[1:41:08] got the Pentecostals that they'll take
[1:41:10] the word and and they'll sell out to it
[1:41:13] uh for Sensations and and things and if
[1:41:17] you can produce a manifestation of of
[1:41:19] like oil and blood and tongues and other
[1:41:21] side signs whether in the word or not or
[1:41:24] whether properly interpreted from the
[1:41:26] word the majority will fall for it amen
[1:41:28] and we've seen that so many times and
[1:41:31] and someone have a dream and someone it
[1:41:33] doesn't matter if it was with the word
[1:41:35] they would just go with the dream and
[1:41:37] and they would go with this and they
[1:41:38] would go with that and they forfeited
[1:41:40] the word and they become lukewarm with
[1:41:43] the word can you say Amen so he says see
[1:41:46] the word has been put aside so then at
[1:41:49] the end of the ages God's spews them a
[1:41:54] man out to where they no longer if I say
[1:41:56] they no longer amen speak from God they
[1:42:00] they are speak for God Amen they no
[1:42:03] longer uh uh and and will say it this
[1:42:06] way the Baptists no longer speak for God
[1:42:08] Amen the charismatics no longer speak
[1:42:11] for God Amen the Pentecostals no longer
[1:42:13] speak for God God has spewed them out of
[1:42:16] his mouth do you believe that amen they
[1:42:19] know no longer and and here's the thing
[1:42:21] people say well they've got part truth
[1:42:22] it does not matter they no longer speak
[1:42:25] for God
[1:42:27] they no longer speak for God people get
[1:42:30] all these quotes and all these things
[1:42:31] from these writers and they get these
[1:42:33] all these books to learn how to be a
[1:42:35] better parent how to be a better you
[1:42:37] know a preacher and to be a better
[1:42:38] Church goer and be a better you know a
[1:42:40] wife or husband and all these things and
[1:42:42] you're taking something that God has
[1:42:44] spewed out of his mouth
[1:42:48] God spewed out of his mouth they have no
[1:42:51] right to the word can you say man
[1:42:52] therefore we're not required to listen
[1:42:54] to them
[1:42:57] we're not required to hang our soul in
[1:42:59] the words that they speak God is not
[1:43:01] requiring his elect to stay with them
[1:43:06] true it's been so much that he spewed
[1:43:08] them out and then he says come out of
[1:43:09] her my people
[1:43:11] come out why because you need rapturing
[1:43:14] faith in this age
[1:43:16] you're needing something to get you out
[1:43:17] of here
[1:43:18] ain't that right amen there's babbling
[1:43:21] it's confusion
[1:43:24] oh they're trying to bring this
[1:43:25] confusion in this message saying well
[1:43:27] brother Branham you can't trust brother
[1:43:28] Branham in this and you can't you don't
[1:43:30] know what he really was of God into this
[1:43:32] I say nonsense these Babylonians coming
[1:43:35] into this message trying to bring a
[1:43:37] spirit of confusion nonsense
[1:43:40] why would you want to take something if
[1:43:42] you you can't even have confidence in if
[1:43:45] God had so much confidence in this
[1:43:46] message you can too
[1:43:48] because it's the only way you're going
[1:43:50] out of a rat or getting in a rapture
[1:43:52] can you say man see so he's calling he's
[1:43:56] calling us out he's called us out you
[1:44:00] know and and so they're no longer the
[1:44:02] mouthpiece they have not the power can
[1:44:04] you say that with me they have not the
[1:44:07] power to bring the bride into what God
[1:44:12] wants them to be why because they have
[1:44:15] no longer a mouthpiece the word is no
[1:44:18] longer in their mouth
[1:44:19] Luther had the word in his mouth amen
[1:44:22] and he called and he left out amen
[1:44:25] Wesley had the word in his mouth and
[1:44:26] what little Revelation he had and he
[1:44:28] called that elect out amen now we're
[1:44:31] living in an age that the word full word
[1:44:33] has been restored you cannot look back
[1:44:36] to a Methodist stage and say well I'm
[1:44:38] going to live off that that is no longer
[1:44:41] a man he did not have what it took a man
[1:44:44] to cut that bride out like it is in this
[1:44:47] age
[1:44:49] I hope that's okay
[1:44:51] amen so what they the what they have I
[1:44:55] don't care if it's just a little truth
[1:44:56] whatever what they have will not bring
[1:44:58] the church into rapturing faith
[1:45:01] it will not
[1:45:03] now God says for out of Seven Ages I
[1:45:06] have seen nothing but men and steaming
[1:45:08] their own word above mine
[1:45:11] so at the end of this age I am spewing
[1:45:13] you out of my mouth it is all over I am
[1:45:16] going to speak all right yes I am here
[1:45:19] in the midst of the church the amen of
[1:45:21] God faithful and true will reveal
[1:45:24] himself and it will be by my prophet
[1:45:30] amen thank you
[1:45:34] Revelations 10 7 we all know it but in
[1:45:37] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:45:40] angel and he shall begin to sound the
[1:45:42] mystery of God should be finished
[1:45:44] why he had the word
[1:45:47] he had the word in his mouth
[1:45:50] you see why we believe in a prophet and
[1:45:52] why we stay with the prophet
[1:45:55] it doesn't matter good people I'm you
[1:45:57] know you were you were not trashing the
[1:45:59] people at all
[1:46:01] we're trashing the system
[1:46:03] we don't believe in the system you see
[1:46:05] if you're going to hang your soul on
[1:46:07] something
[1:46:08] God's got to give you something to hang
[1:46:10] it on
[1:46:12] amen because this this isn't this isn't
[1:46:15] a game
[1:46:16] this isn't just a myth God is coming
[1:46:21] what we're seeing today in politics and
[1:46:23] the world and and the things it it it is
[1:46:26] it should be a reality check to the
[1:46:30] church
[1:46:31] in world and around the world to see
[1:46:34] what's happening we are living in the
[1:46:36] days of lot we are living in the days of
[1:46:39] Sodom and Gomorrah we are living in the
[1:46:41] days of Noah we're living in these times
[1:46:46] return them and as God has always done
[1:46:49] it in them times he's always provided
[1:46:52] the way of Escape
[1:46:55] to get out of here
[1:46:59] God provided an art back in that day but
[1:47:01] in this day he's not providing an ark in
[1:47:04] in a literal Ark
[1:47:07] didn't you say man
[1:47:09] he's he's providing a body
[1:47:13] brother Brown said the body of Christ is
[1:47:15] the ark today
[1:47:18] and just as Noah in Noah's day just
[1:47:22] before the destruction God provided a
[1:47:24] prophet right Noah was the prophet
[1:47:26] and the Bible says Noah stood in the
[1:47:28] door
[1:47:29] of that art
[1:47:31] tell them the people come
[1:47:33] anybody come why he didn't stand at the
[1:47:36] end of the Ark he didn't stand away from
[1:47:38] the ark and say go go go go go I want to
[1:47:41] make sure there was no confusion
[1:47:44] I'm right here
[1:47:46] come
[1:47:47] he stood right there
[1:47:49] and you see this Prophet stood in the
[1:47:51] door
[1:47:53] everybody's got an idea of how to get in
[1:47:55] the body
[1:47:57] that a prophet of the age a prophet of
[1:47:59] the hour knew where the door was
[1:48:03] knew where the real power laid knew
[1:48:05] where the Dynamics Jesus says I am that
[1:48:07] door
[1:48:08] and these people that try to separate
[1:48:10] the message from Christ is nonsense they
[1:48:12] they they're telling you right then they
[1:48:14] don't know this message they don't
[1:48:16] understand whatever brother Branham that
[1:48:18] Prophet stood we were here we are in the
[1:48:20] days of Noah God has provided a body the
[1:48:23] ark you got to get in the ark you got to
[1:48:27] become part not a denomination not shake
[1:48:29] the preacher's hand you got to get in
[1:48:30] the body can you say amen and here is a
[1:48:33] prophet standing just like Noah did in
[1:48:35] that day in the literal amen since there
[1:48:37] was a prophet in this day standing at
[1:48:39] the door of Christ saying come come
[1:48:42] here's the entrance into the body can
[1:48:44] you say Amen don't you depend upon a
[1:48:46] sensation and say you're in the body
[1:48:47] don't you depend upon some gift and say
[1:48:50] you're in the body don't depend upon
[1:48:52] some Doctrine and say you're in the body
[1:48:53] don't say well I've got I'm in it I
[1:48:56] belong to a denomination I'm okay that's
[1:48:58] not it the prophet stood at the door of
[1:49:01] the Ark so that you and I don't have to
[1:49:04] be confused
[1:49:07] why because the prophet said he is the
[1:49:09] Dynamics to the mechanics
[1:49:11] can you say man when you'll know the
[1:49:15] people know they're in the ark when the
[1:49:16] dynamic strikes them
[1:49:18] because he is the door
[1:49:20] can you say Amen you love him
[1:49:24] so here
[1:49:26] brother Graham said there it is see he
[1:49:28] is sending a Vindicated prophet he is
[1:49:31] sending a prophet after almost 2 000
[1:49:33] years he is sending someone who is so
[1:49:36] far from organization education in the
[1:49:38] world of religion that as John the
[1:49:40] Baptist and Elijah Abode he will hear
[1:49:44] only from God
[1:49:49] aren't you glad for that and he will
[1:49:52] have thus saith the Lord and speak for
[1:49:56] God
[1:49:59] so brother Brown taught an adoption a
[1:50:01] certain way stay with what brother Brown
[1:50:02] taught
[1:50:07] ain't that right
[1:50:09] if he taught things certain way stay
[1:50:11] with what he taught
[1:50:13] and ask God to give you the spirit of
[1:50:16] Revelation
[1:50:19] so your revelation will fit through the
[1:50:22] whole Bible that your Revelation won't
[1:50:24] take out scriptures
[1:50:26] can you say man
[1:50:28] that you can actually say Amen to it all
[1:50:31] [Music]
[1:50:33] a prophet never took away from the Bible
[1:50:37] he never lived apart from the Bible
[1:50:40] can you say man
[1:50:42] why he had thus saith the Lord he knew
[1:50:45] the mind of God he will hear only from
[1:50:48] God he never heard from theologians he
[1:50:51] never heard from traditionalism
[1:50:53] he never heard from anything he didn't
[1:50:55] care what people thought
[1:50:57] he didn't care what they believed he
[1:50:58] didn't care what they said
[1:51:01] he stayed right with the word for he
[1:51:03] will hear only from God
[1:51:05] and he will only have the Sith the Lord
[1:51:09] can you say man
[1:51:11] and he will speak for God he will be
[1:51:15] God's mouthpiece And he as it is
[1:51:19] declared in Malachi 4 6 will turn the
[1:51:22] hearts of the children back to the
[1:51:23] fathers notice he will bring back the
[1:51:27] elect
[1:51:28] of the last day
[1:51:30] and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet
[1:51:33] give the exact truth as it was with Paul
[1:51:35] he will restore the truth as they had it
[1:51:38] and those elect with him in that day
[1:51:42] will be the ones who truly manifest the
[1:51:45] Lord and be his body and be his voice
[1:51:49] and perform his works
[1:51:52] it's the elect that he will be able
[1:51:55] together
[1:51:56] gather can you say Amen everyone else
[1:52:00] will be just like them Pharisees and the
[1:52:02] Sadducees it doesn't matter what God
[1:52:04] done to and showed the Vindicated
[1:52:06] message and the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:52:08] he could not gather them
[1:52:10] but there was an elect he could gather
[1:52:12] and this message is gathering any Lacks
[1:52:15] everyone else will despise that everyone
[1:52:17] else will say proud of my brain of my
[1:52:19] brand of mine I don't care I'm glad to
[1:52:21] be a brand of mine
[1:52:22] because I see it's more than just a man
[1:52:25] it was God Amen with the ministry of a
[1:52:27] supernatural Supernatural speaker to
[1:52:29] that man together me for a rapture
[1:52:36] only through the Vindicated Prophet will
[1:52:38] he bring back the elect
[1:52:41] notice now
[1:52:43] is this okay
[1:52:45] what would God call a people out for
[1:52:47] this evil age for
[1:52:49] his name
[1:52:50] can you say that with me his name
[1:52:53] why is God sending a prophet why did he
[1:52:55] restore the word why did he do all these
[1:52:57] things that he'd done in this age to
[1:52:59] call out a people why for his name
[1:53:03] notice the reason it is is to try her
[1:53:08] his bride
[1:53:10] his bride is the most tried people on
[1:53:14] the face of the Earth
[1:53:16] today
[1:53:18] talking about demons
[1:53:21] brother Brown said it would have been
[1:53:22] easier just to be lived in that day
[1:53:25] and to be burned to a stake and get it
[1:53:27] over with
[1:53:28] to be whatever be a martyr and get it
[1:53:30] over with
[1:53:32] but it's not that way today it's a more
[1:53:34] treacherous hour
[1:53:36] demons just constantly battling fighting
[1:53:40] us
[1:53:41] he'll fight you in your sleep
[1:53:43] have you ever had that happen you're
[1:53:45] thinking oh if I could just go to sleep
[1:53:46] and get and get my problems over with
[1:53:48] and he's right there in your sleep
[1:53:50] wake up and he's right there in your bed
[1:53:53] putting thoughts in your mind allowing
[1:53:55] things to happen and you react maybe a
[1:53:57] different way that you you really wanted
[1:53:59] to or or something like that and and
[1:54:02] then you feel bad or or it's just
[1:54:05] constant constant constant battles
[1:54:07] constant Warfare but notice the reason
[1:54:10] is to try her his bride see notice when
[1:54:14] she and this is why the trying is going
[1:54:16] on when she is made manifest and been
[1:54:19] tried and been proven and proved to
[1:54:23] Satan why is the trials coming your way
[1:54:25] to prove to the devil it's not to prove
[1:54:28] to you that you're a Son of God you
[1:54:30] already know you're a son and daughter
[1:54:31] of God you've already got his seal
[1:54:34] within you amen even as Paul said his
[1:54:37] Spirit Within Me cries I'm a father
[1:54:40] ain't that right but it's to prove to
[1:54:43] the devil that you're not one of his
[1:54:45] little suckers you're not his Pawn
[1:54:48] you're not someone that can be so easily
[1:54:51] messed with
[1:54:52] ain't that right look what he's doing to
[1:54:54] the homes today look what he's doing to
[1:54:56] the children today look what he's
[1:54:58] what he saw today but there is a people
[1:55:00] he has no hands to he cannot touch them
[1:55:05] they can touch them physically he can
[1:55:07] touch him and send the problems and the
[1:55:09] trials all that way but that Soul has
[1:55:11] been forever sealed
[1:55:13] can you say man
[1:55:15] now notice thee look look now when she
[1:55:19] is made manifest
[1:55:21] been tried been proven proved to Satan
[1:55:24] like it was at the beginning
[1:55:27] in the Garden of Eden so shall it be in
[1:55:29] the end
[1:55:32] can you say man you see this bride is
[1:55:35] being tried like no other H I believe
[1:55:37] that
[1:55:38] I believe this Variety in this age the
[1:55:41] elect of this age she'd been called out
[1:55:42] how many's been called out aren't you
[1:55:44] glad you called out
[1:55:45] I am so glad to be called out
[1:55:49] but if we only knew that he was calling
[1:55:52] out to try us
[1:55:54] and to prove us
[1:55:55] and Buddy the trials go
[1:55:58] and the fire is hot but if you could
[1:56:00] only know that he's got a place prepared
[1:56:02] for you
[1:56:03] if you only knew that he already has the
[1:56:05] confidence in you that you will not fall
[1:56:07] you will not fail
[1:56:09] aren't you glad for that see so the more
[1:56:12] you surrender to the message the more
[1:56:14] you're going to be tried the more
[1:56:16] Revelation comes to you the more you're
[1:56:18] going to be tried get it down now don't
[1:56:20] be scared to try
[1:56:22] all right amen
[1:56:25] because God's already promised he will
[1:56:26] keep you through it
[1:56:28] the more you surrender and say God make
[1:56:30] your will known to me God give me this
[1:56:33] Revelation that's going to be tried to
[1:56:35] the uttermost
[1:56:40] now what what is God bringing us back to
[1:56:42] because he's going to gather us
[1:56:44] by a prophet he's Gathering us
[1:56:48] brother Brown said notice he says as a
[1:56:50] seed starts in the ground it comes up
[1:56:53] through carriers the life of it and ends
[1:56:56] up the same seat everybody say the same
[1:56:58] seed as it was when it was when in the
[1:57:01] ground
[1:57:02] see so the same way the seed of Deceit
[1:57:05] fell in the ground back in Eden is the
[1:57:09] same
[1:57:10] way it ends up in the last days
[1:57:14] just as the gospel seed was when it fell
[1:57:17] into a denomination at nicer Rome so it
[1:57:20] ends up in a super organization today
[1:57:24] just as the seed of the church fell
[1:57:26] signs and wonders and a living Christ
[1:57:27] among
[1:57:28] soweth in
[1:57:32] under the ministry of Malachi 4.
[1:57:35] that's what he says
[1:57:37] amen aren't you glad for that got a
[1:57:39] Ministry
[1:57:41] that's bringing this to you
[1:57:43] you're the people that Satan don't know
[1:57:45] what to do with
[1:57:47] amen he says it is restored the Church
[1:57:51] is restored back again to the original
[1:57:53] faith that was once given
[1:57:56] so notice what brother Brown says now
[1:57:58] this evil age everybody say this evil
[1:58:01] age
[1:58:03] is to prove to Satan
[1:58:06] she is not like Eve
[1:58:13] God made his own garden
[1:58:15] and Satan come in and took that woman
[1:58:19] and she surrendered it
[1:58:21] out of God's Own Garden
[1:58:24] Satan had no power nothing nothing
[1:58:27] like today nothing
[1:58:30] that blows my mind
[1:58:33] so God says okay
[1:58:37] all I could do is let you make your
[1:58:38] garden
[1:58:41] so Satan today has come up with his own
[1:58:43] garden the most deceitful ever
[1:58:47] more deceitful than it was in the Garden
[1:58:50] of Eden in guard's Garden
[1:58:53] Satan had no power to do nothing to her
[1:58:55] all they done is just talk talk talk
[1:58:57] there was no influences there was no
[1:59:00] evil there was no sickness no nothing
[1:59:01] nothing no mind about nothing
[1:59:04] he just walked into God's Garden I mean
[1:59:06] and twisted the word just one little
[1:59:09] word and that was deception in his
[1:59:11] infancy but it's in this day that God
[1:59:14] has allowed him to do his own garden
[1:59:16] go ahead do your own garden and all the
[1:59:19] evil Powers is here
[1:59:22] every demonic spirit is around
[1:59:25] everything that Satan never wanted is
[1:59:27] here a lot more treacherous than it was
[1:59:30] in the Garden of Eden
[1:59:31] and God says out of this age I'll bring
[1:59:33] a bride out
[1:59:35] of his own age he is only eaten I'll
[1:59:39] call a bride out
[1:59:41] can you say amen that's exactly right
[1:59:43] this evil age is to prove to Satan she
[1:59:47] is not like Eve she is not that type of
[1:59:51] woman
[1:59:52] oh
[1:59:54] hallelujah
[1:59:56] hallelujah we're not that type of a
[1:59:59] person
[2:00:00] time to give Eve a ear to his Delights
[2:00:03] and his deception yes the Mind battles
[2:00:06] are there yes the darkness is there yes
[2:00:08] everything is present and we feel all
[2:00:11] these things are approaching all around
[2:00:13] us that we're not like that woman we
[2:00:16] will not fall
[2:00:19] we will not fall
[2:00:22] we will not fall
[2:00:24] aren't you glad for it
[2:00:26] yes sir he sent a prophet together us
[2:00:29] gather us
[2:00:31] Hallelujah
[2:00:32] and she will be Tried by his word
[2:00:36] the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by
[2:00:40] the word
[2:00:41] and Adam's bride believed every bit of
[2:00:44] the word all but confused on one promise
[2:00:47] that he's the same yesterday today and
[2:00:49] forever
[2:00:51] but failed on One Promise under the
[2:00:54] temptation of the enemy face to face
[2:00:57] and now the people that's called for his
[2:00:59] name of course is his bride she is to
[2:01:04] come in contact Again by the same thing
[2:01:10] not by just denominational truth or
[2:01:13] something but every everybody say every
[2:01:15] word
[2:01:18] come and contact same enemy that he
[2:01:21] faced as we're facing today
[2:01:23] except he is now more treacherous than
[2:01:27] he has ever been
[2:01:29] he's got all the powers behind him he's
[2:01:32] able to do anything he wants to in this
[2:01:34] age because they're his kingdoms
[2:01:37] and look what he's doing
[2:01:40] there's a people that will not fall
[2:01:42] can you say Amen
[2:01:47] in the beginning of the Bible man was
[2:01:49] given the word to live by
[2:01:52] one word was misinterpreted by a man
[2:01:55] called Satan
[2:01:57] in a person of an animal called The
[2:01:59] Serpent
[2:02:01] Satan in this person could talk to Eve
[2:02:04] and misinterpret the word to her
[2:02:07] and the Word was lost
[2:02:10] in the middle of the Bible Jesus was
[2:02:12] tempted of Satan same guy
[2:02:15] that knows what he said it is written
[2:02:18] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:02:20] every word
[2:02:22] he tried it but he couldn't do it
[2:02:26] brother Brown said it has been promised
[2:02:28] that the God of this world would rise up
[2:02:30] in the last days
[2:02:33] and just to think of it after 1900 years
[2:02:37] of this gospel preaching
[2:02:39] the world system is more evil than it
[2:02:42] ever was when Christ was here on the
[2:02:44] Earth
[2:02:45] Abraham said the world system is more
[2:02:47] evil the world is heading to a great
[2:02:49] climax you know that the Lord is
[2:02:52] fulfilling his word on every hand
[2:02:54] the world is heading to a climax why the
[2:02:58] spirit of lawlessness moral Decay
[2:03:00] scientific religion has led it to the
[2:03:03] cage of every hateful and unclean birds
[2:03:05] as the Bible has said ain't that right
[2:03:09] and you can find that in there in
[2:03:12] Revelations 18 1-5
[2:03:15] and brother Branham actually reads that
[2:03:18] and how Babylon the great is Fallen is
[2:03:20] fallen and has become the habitation of
[2:03:22] devils and the hold of every foul Spirit
[2:03:25] and the cage of every unclean and
[2:03:27] hateful bird
[2:03:29] and and he just he goes on but then
[2:03:32] notice what he says that is laodicea
[2:03:37] he said that throws the church exactly
[2:03:39] back to Revelations 3 14 the laodicean
[2:03:43] age lawlessness
[2:03:46] but real religious
[2:03:49] real religious but Lawless can you say
[2:03:52] Amen
[2:03:54] the 17th verse they're uh Revelations 18
[2:03:59] or 3 Revelations 3 I think 17 it says
[2:04:04] because thou sayest I am rich and
[2:04:07] increased with goods and have need of
[2:04:08] nothing and know it's not that thou art
[2:04:11] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[2:04:15] and so Revelations the 18th chapter ties
[2:04:19] perfectly with this age
[2:04:21] Abraham said not Daniel's age not Noah's
[2:04:24] age but this age amen
[2:04:27] Amen in this last evil Age and and we
[2:04:30] know as I get ready to close now
[2:04:33] the Natural Woman types the church
[2:04:37] and if you notice how the majority of
[2:04:39] women today
[2:04:41] are
[2:04:42] I guess we could say insufficiently
[2:04:44] dressed
[2:04:48] and
[2:04:49] foreign
[2:04:50] just going around you know uh hardly any
[2:04:54] clothes and things like that and but
[2:04:56] it's it's fitting for this evil age to
[2:04:59] show the condition of the church
[2:05:01] the natural Church
[2:05:04] brother Brown said did you know any
[2:05:06] woman that undresses herself like that
[2:05:08] is not in her right mind
[2:05:10] do you know she is whether she believes
[2:05:13] it or not or thinks not she is a
[2:05:16] prostitute
[2:05:17] though the woman might stand with her
[2:05:19] hand before God and swear that she's
[2:05:20] never been touched by any other man but
[2:05:23] her husband and that might be the honest
[2:05:25] truth but she still is a prostitute for
[2:05:27] Jesus said whosoever looketh upon a
[2:05:29] woman to lust after her hath committed
[2:05:31] adultery with her already
[2:05:32] and you say man
[2:05:34] so what it is is the Bible says she's
[2:05:36] naked and don't know it ain't that right
[2:05:40] and and I want to just give you all you
[2:05:43] sisters and I I want to say I appreciate
[2:05:45] you sisters
[2:05:47] uh life
[2:05:48] and your willingness to not dress sexy
[2:05:53] and have a sex appeal
[2:05:55] and that you're living clean and holy
[2:05:58] because
[2:05:59] what you
[2:06:02] I know you know it but just to remind
[2:06:05] you and enforce
[2:06:07] what has already been told you through
[2:06:09] the years is that you're the type of the
[2:06:12] the bride
[2:06:14] as the Natural Woman is looking and
[2:06:17] going naked and and and you know skimpy
[2:06:21] and sexy and all these things she is
[2:06:24] actually don't know and she don't know
[2:06:25] it but she's actually typing out the
[2:06:27] carnal Church
[2:06:28] so are you sisters you're you're typing
[2:06:31] out a a bride of Christ that is staying
[2:06:36] clean to her husband
[2:06:37] and I want to tell you young people and
[2:06:40] and you girls don't you dress sexy
[2:06:43] don't try to get on these tight clothes
[2:06:47] short skirts
[2:06:48] it's wrong
[2:06:50] don't don't look at the world and think
[2:06:52] that's appealing if if you if you've got
[2:06:55] to get a guy like that if you got to get
[2:06:57] a guy by showing your body in every
[2:06:58] curve of your body
[2:07:00] something wrong with you
[2:07:02] and there's something wrong with the guy
[2:07:06] if a guy has to be drawn by sex appeal
[2:07:08] something wrong with him
[2:07:11] it should be your character
[2:07:14] it should be your your your inner person
[2:07:17] and any Christian girl
[2:07:20] and and you pardon me but any Christian
[2:07:23] girl is beautiful
[2:07:25] because her character is what makes her
[2:07:27] beautiful
[2:07:29] when she's staying true to God and she's
[2:07:32] living right before the Lord
[2:07:35] that's that's Beauty it's real Beauty
[2:07:38] natural beauty will fade
[2:07:42] but in all reality if if you have to
[2:07:45] dress sexy to get a guy
[2:07:48] you just wait
[2:07:51] tell the girl that's sexier than you
[2:07:53] comes along
[2:07:56] you'll only appreciate your body until
[2:07:59] he gets tired of it
[2:08:02] but he won't appreciate the inside the
[2:08:04] inward part
[2:08:06] of really what you are
[2:08:08] and I thank God and I think all of us
[2:08:10] husbands should be
[2:08:12] count ourselves so blessed to have women
[2:08:15] the way our wives
[2:08:17] I am so thankful for my wife
[2:08:20] I look at her just constantly thinking
[2:08:23] God you blessed me with such a wonderful
[2:08:25] woman
[2:08:26] such beauty and character and such
[2:08:29] beauty and solidness
[2:08:32] I can't I just can't thank God enough
[2:08:34] for her
[2:08:36] I thank God for my daughters
[2:08:39] that are trying to live true
[2:08:42] but sometimes I see that Satan tries to
[2:08:44] woo them
[2:08:46] that I want to tell you don't don't you
[2:08:48] let the devil woo you that way
[2:08:51] don't you let the devil think that
[2:08:53] you're you're you need to do something
[2:08:54] else
[2:08:57] because what you'll start doing is
[2:08:58] you'll start attracting things that
[2:09:01] shouldn't be even a part of your life
[2:09:04] stay true to God Stay True to this
[2:09:07] message
[2:09:08] can you say man
[2:09:09] you love the Lord
[2:09:11] amen
[2:09:13] now notice what the prophet said the
[2:09:16] spirit that's anointing her to do such
[2:09:18] things is an evil prostitute spirit
[2:09:22] her outward being her physical body her
[2:09:24] flesh she might be clean she might not
[2:09:27] commit any adultery and could swear to
[2:09:30] God and be the truth that she never but
[2:09:33] her spirit everybody say her spirit is a
[2:09:36] prostitute spirit
[2:09:38] she has been so blinded by the God of
[2:09:40] this world of fashion she dressed
[2:09:42] herself sexy and got out there
[2:09:46] yet the musicians will come
[2:09:49] but a woman can't be in her right mind
[2:09:52] and put on a bikini
[2:09:54] she is possessed with the prostitute
[2:09:56] Spirit now you settle that with God lady
[2:09:59] because you'll find out someday that
[2:10:01] that is the truth
[2:10:03] how could you a lady knowing how sacred
[2:10:05] your body is and expose it out there to
[2:10:08] these lustful sinful Devils that walk
[2:10:10] the street of this day
[2:10:14] if sons of God was all still sons of God
[2:10:17] your husband was the son of God he would
[2:10:19] either make you put on clothes or Leave
[2:10:21] You
[2:10:22] if a boy was the son of God he would
[2:10:24] never marry such a thing
[2:10:26] see
[2:10:27] I'm telling you the truth and someday
[2:10:29] you'll meet it naked adulterous and
[2:10:32] don't know it can you say man
[2:10:37] so sisters
[2:10:39] stay true
[2:10:42] you mothers teacher daughters
[2:10:45] to live right
[2:10:48] don't let him wear them short skirts and
[2:10:51] sex appeal dresses
[2:10:53] and it's sad to say that young girls are
[2:10:55] wearing these sex appeal
[2:10:58] it's sad
[2:11:01] that they're being taught it they're
[2:11:02] being allowed to do these things
[2:11:05] but you remember who you are
[2:11:08] as a woman and you teacher to girls
[2:11:12] who they are but they are not just for
[2:11:15] the world's picking
[2:11:18] if they are Daughters of God
[2:11:21] and this is the way God wants them to
[2:11:23] live live clean live pure
[2:11:26] and this message is gathering us
[2:11:29] Gathering us around
[2:11:31] aren't you glad for that
[2:11:33] aren't you glad that the prophets stay
[2:11:35] true to the word of God
[2:11:38] we see that there's two two opposing
[2:11:41] Spirits at work today of course one of
[2:11:44] them is the Holy Spirit the other one is
[2:11:46] the spirit of the devil
[2:11:48] which is in this last day working in
[2:11:50] deception and the prophet said there
[2:11:51] cannot be more than two heads and the
[2:11:54] people of the Earth are now making their
[2:11:58] choice
[2:11:58] [Music]
[2:12:00] I want to put that to you now she's
[2:12:03] making her choice the people of the age
[2:12:05] are making their choices
[2:12:07] this is where the separation is coming
[2:12:10] it is manifesting time
[2:12:14] and people are making their choices
[2:12:15] their Trials come things come
[2:12:19] and watch what the choices they make
[2:12:21] [Music]
[2:12:23] right
[2:12:24] what they're going to do see where it's
[2:12:27] taking them
[2:12:29] that the message of the hour is drawing
[2:12:31] the elect together
[2:12:33] can you say man amen he says the holy
[2:12:36] spirit is here calling out a bride for
[2:12:38] Christ he is doing it by vindicating his
[2:12:41] Word of Promise to her for this age
[2:12:43] showing that it is Christ
[2:12:46] if the finger is supposed to move in
[2:12:48] this age the finger will move if the
[2:12:49] foot is supposed to move in this age the
[2:12:51] foot will move if the eye is to see in
[2:12:53] this age the eye will see the spirit of
[2:12:55] God as it's growled into the full
[2:12:57] stature of God is the age that we're now
[2:12:59] living in the Holy Spirit is here
[2:13:01] vindicating the message of the hour and
[2:13:03] the Holy Spirit is doing this so that
[2:13:05] the people that believe God will be
[2:13:08] called out of this chaos
[2:13:12] so now you know why he's Vindicated the
[2:13:14] message of the hour so that you and I
[2:13:16] could be called out of the chaos
[2:13:19] he said see the devil's Unholy spirit is
[2:13:21] is here calling his church by the error
[2:13:24] and as usual by perversion of the word
[2:13:27] of God like he did at the beginning see
[2:13:29] it coming right back to that seed time
[2:13:32] again from Eden here it is again can you
[2:13:35] say man
[2:13:36] but here as as the church natural is
[2:13:40] found naked
[2:13:43] if you notice at the same time the bride
[2:13:45] is found closed
[2:13:49] I'm going to just read you some
[2:13:51] scriptures right fast Revelations 1 13
[2:13:53] and in the midst of the seven golden
[2:13:55] seven candlesticks one likened to the
[2:13:57] son of man
[2:13:59] clothes thereby say closed with a
[2:14:02] garment down to the foot
[2:14:03] brother Brown said that was the bride
[2:14:06] and gerd about the paps with the golden
[2:14:08] girdle Revelations 3 5 he that
[2:14:11] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[2:14:14] white raiment Revelation 7 9 after this
[2:14:17] I beheld and lo a great multitude which
[2:14:20] no man could number all of nation of all
[2:14:22] Nations kindreds people's tongues stood
[2:14:24] Before the Throne and before the lamb
[2:14:26] clothed with white robes and Palms in
[2:14:30] their hands
[2:14:32] Revelations 19 7 let us be glad and
[2:14:35] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[2:14:37] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[2:14:39] wife hath made herself ready and to her
[2:14:42] was granted as she should be arrayed in
[2:14:44] fine linen and clean and white for the
[2:14:46] fine linen is the righteousness of the
[2:14:48] Saints aren't you glad for that
[2:14:52] how's she going to be clothed
[2:14:54] brother Brown said all men has forsaken
[2:14:56] me because I took a true word and stood
[2:14:58] by the word I've stayed right here to
[2:15:01] what he said to me preach the word not a
[2:15:03] denominational philosophy preach the
[2:15:06] word that was my commission stay with
[2:15:07] the word and Brethren who has listened
[2:15:10] to this on tape I was a great guy when I
[2:15:12] come among you just Healing The Sick
[2:15:14] speaking of visions and showing things
[2:15:17] but when I went to tell you the truth
[2:15:18] about the word what did you turn your
[2:15:20] back on me for
[2:15:22] do you realize it's just fulfilling what
[2:15:24] the scripture said yes it does that way
[2:15:26] now I can hardly get in a place
[2:15:29] see letter comes all the time one come
[2:15:31] the other day said brother Branham I had
[2:15:33] the greatest confidence in you but I
[2:15:34] heard you say that a certain
[2:15:35] denomination which I belong to was
[2:15:37] backsliding said I have no more
[2:15:39] confidence in you at all now from now on
[2:15:42] said there was about 25 of the Brethren
[2:15:45] of my denominations setting in one of
[2:15:47] your meetings we just got right up and
[2:15:49] went out off when you when you said that
[2:15:52] see well all men has forsaken me but
[2:15:54] there's one thing he stood by me see I
[2:15:57] wasn't disobedient to the heavenly
[2:15:59] vision that happened down there on the
[2:16:00] river I stayed true to him he's been
[2:16:03] true to me I'm trusting in Him someday I
[2:16:05] don't know when for crowning of my
[2:16:07] Ministry I've stayed just as true as I
[2:16:09] could be I don't know what it'll be I
[2:16:12] don't know when it'll be and just when
[2:16:15] he's ready I am done up here I hope
[2:16:18] he'll Crown my Ministry of this of
[2:16:20] letting me take the clothes of the word
[2:16:22] and dress his bride in the clothe of the
[2:16:24] word and for his righteousness I hope he
[2:16:27] will Crown me and let me stand on that
[2:16:29] day and say Behold the Lamb of God that
[2:16:31] taketh away the sins of the world
[2:16:33] there's so many heels to climb upward
[2:16:35] and the strain sometimes it gets hard
[2:16:38] but the one that points the pathway
[2:16:41] knows just what's best he knows what's
[2:16:44] best the tolls of the road will seem
[2:16:46] nothing when we get to the end of the
[2:16:48] way let's hunt for that Bloody footprint
[2:16:51] just remember Friends The Sands has been
[2:16:53] washed in the footprints of that
[2:16:55] stranger on Galilee Shore and that voice
[2:16:58] that subdued the rough Billows will be
[2:17:00] heard in Judea no more but the path of
[2:17:03] that long Galilean so gladly I followed
[2:17:05] today and the toll of the road will seem
[2:17:08] nothing when I get to the end of the way
[2:17:10] in the first part of the scripture he
[2:17:13] says I read he gave to me when I was a
[2:17:16] young man just a boy standing out there
[2:17:18] shoulder straight chest thrown out shock
[2:17:21] of wavy black hair and now I stand
[2:17:23] stooped shouldered bald-headed graying
[2:17:25] an old man of 53 years old but he's
[2:17:28] sweeter as the day goes by I've not
[2:17:30] shunned to declare to you the whole
[2:17:32] Gospel of Jesus Christ and my heart's
[2:17:34] desire is to meet the church which he
[2:17:36] has died for clothed in the righteous
[2:17:38] business of his own blood dressed in his
[2:17:40] word in the righteousness of his word
[2:17:42] for his word can never fail and
[2:17:44] therefore I know if I'll stand by the
[2:17:46] word and be true to the word and if the
[2:17:48] word abides in me and I in him at that
[2:17:50] day I'll be happy that I stay true
[2:17:54] aren't you happy
[2:17:55] that he has stayed true to the word
[2:17:58] I'm so happy

[2:24:17] fighting laid aside all doubts
[2:24:21] lay inside all the confusion just take
[2:24:24] him at his word and believe
[2:24:27] God bless you brother will could you
[2:24:30] dismiss us in prayer
[2:24:34] foreign
[2:24:34] [Music]
