afternoon and uh just come full of Faith amen the musicians can be dismissed appreciate the musicians and uh sister Rihanna for filling in for us and she's come right along on that piano praise the Lord appreciate them all and I just appreciate God's people amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Matthew the 11th chapter and um we also uh brother Bob is going to be going in for a checkup tomorrow I think going as hard it's a physical or whatever there and so we want to keep him in our prayer that he just gets a good report and uh praise the lord we want brother Bob around for a while amen he's certainly been a blessing to us and a real uh a real Soldier he and Sister Janice and they put in many years for the Lord the kingdom of God and we just love them dearly amen Matthew the 11th chapter and we'll start at the 28th verse it says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen let's just bow our hearts Lord Jesus there's just not enough emphasis that we could put upon you Lord your power and your might and your love faithfulness and all that you are Lord as the song would say oh for a thousand tongues to sing praise and honor to you father but Lord as we realize we only have a short lifetime Lord and we only have just one tongue that God to worship you and to speak but father let our lives declare let everything that's within us declare you and your glory in your mind father may you pray your presence come the presence of the king of kings Lord of lords come among us tonight and Lord you know the needs of your people I pray that you would meet them Lord and that you would just subdue Lord all enemy Lord that has come against your people father Lord we just Commit This service into your hands we need you Lord father anoint myself take what little words we would have and Lord just open it up to us as our prayer may it be effective in a positive way to your people draw what's closer to you we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seeds also I had forgot to mention uh this morning the financial report there is in the back anyone that wants to look at it and we appreciate brother Tim uh for doing that for us and taking the time and I know what can be a lot of work and for him and he's running his business and home and all that and but yet willing to to help us out and never complaining and we certainly appreciate that a lot of work goes on behind the scenes that maybe most don't realize uh but I just thank God for men and and even women that that just helped uh they're willing to help behind the scenes and that way we could just come to church and enjoy ourselves amen and uh so uh but I'm thinking again on the title uh resting and thus saith the Lord and um uh uh I think it's a powerful scripture and of course this word rest is to refrain from labor to be free from anxiety or disturbance having Peace of Mind and Spirit to remain confident so that's that's what the Lord wants us to do he wants us to be free from labor and exertion uh in in our spirit and our soul to be free from anxiety and fear and disturbance he wants us to have peace of mind he he wants us to be confident and if there's ever a time that we need to be confident it is today with the world the way it is and so much uncertainty but but there is a way for us to remain confident and uh and so uh this this this risk gives us an idea of what Jesus is meaning when he said come unto me and you shall find rest on in your soul and uh so people today seem to be physically exhausted they mentally exhausted and and spiritually exhausted um um just uh exhausted all around and uh but Jesus was speaking rest for the soul you shall find rest and and it's so important then if if we are to come to him to find such a rest then it is important to know what to come to uh uh because we cannot find rest if we don't come to him another scripture that is prophetic of our day and uh uh Nance Isaiah 45 22 where Jesus has said or God said in the Old Testament be ye saved or looking to me and be saved all the ends plural of the earth and uh this this scripture uh been laying there all these years speaking of this day and uh for it says all ye ends of the Earth look unto me and be ye saved we we are at the end of all things the the system of the Earth has come to its end world history has come to its end civilization has come to its End Church ages have come to its end denominations have come to its end time has come to its end everything is is come to its end we are truly at the ends of the Earth and this world cannot continue anymore much longer uh uh uh as as it is and so uh but it's at this time that we are commanded by God to look look unto him and be ye saved and so now it's sad to say in this condition uh that the world is in uh people don't know what to look for they they don't know where to look and uh my they're they're trying to find comfort in religion uh look into religion but they ain't finding rest there they're they're looking to politicians but they're not finding rest there they're looking to their jobs but they ain't finding rest there you ain't finding rest in economies in the economy you you there there is just no rest but but so if if he told us to come to him that we might find rest and look to him to find life then we need to know we we need to know what he is and where he is and uh the the the prophet of God said at the end of each World System he always makes himself known amen God always makes himself known so he's not he's not some say look unto me and then he doesn't make himself known he he does and and so then the command is coming to me look unto me find rest be be saved amen and that's that's the most important thing of Our Lives is that we can find rest amen trouble's coming and we got to have that rest and and the the shaking is going on there Paul uh uh uh their prophesied of this day and and and God said you know not only will I shake the the Earth also but I'll shake the heavens or not only will I shake the heavens I'll shake the Earth anyways the earth and the heavens are going to be shaken and everything is going to be shaken and that which can remain shall remain and that which will be shaken will be shaken will be removed ain't that right well we're living in this time of shaking home life being shaken the church is being shaken everything is being shaken to the core a man and uh so so to come to him then then the the thing that the prophet has taught us is that you've got to come to the word ain't that right you you have to come to the word for he is the word come come to the word and find rest for your souls look to the word and and be ye saved uh all ye ends of the Earth now but this means more than just carrying a Bible or and having a Bible and it means more than just reading your Bible which we should all read our Bible but it means more than that it means more than just memorizing uh Bible verses and and and things like that uh here John 1 1 it tells us really what the word is in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God but it doesn't just stop there in the 14th verse it says and the word everybody say the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory story The Glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so the word was the beginning in the beginning was the word which is an expression of God's thoughts and the Word was with God the Word was God you can't you can't take God from the word you can't separate God from the word the word from God it's all the same and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us which Paul later says and God was in Christ reconciling the world so unto himself so the word was made flesh God in flesh ain't that right and so it it then it was at then that when the word became flesh that he said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest unto your soul so so what I believe that the word made flesh is what he is today the word made flesh is what he is today to come to him we do not come to a physical body that he once lived in when he made that statement come unto me all ye that uh are heavy laden see because he isn't here today in his physical body do you believe that so we're not looking for a physical stature uh maybe with nail scarred hands and and and stripes on his back now the Bible never promised that we would that he would come to us in that way the Bible says that the Jews will see him that way and they'll look upon him uh with no scarred hands and say where did you get these scars uh and he says in the house of my friends ain't that right but he never promised to come to us Amen in a physical form or his physical body but he is here in the form of his promised word manifesting himself he is revealed in his own word ain't that right Prophet said he is sitting or hiding in his own word so God now if you notice God isn't in in the word of a man he's not in man's words he does not reveal himself in the words of a man only in his own word does he reveal himself ain't that right so his word is the saith Lord ain't that right his word is thus saith the Lord and that is why Satan hates the word of God uh uh Satan will promote man's words he'll promote man's ideas his man's theology man's Doctrine he'll promote man's dogma and Creeds he'll promote anything outside the word of God Amen because he hates the word of God do you believe that amen the Bible even says that he transforms himself into an angel of Light and his Minister's work as Ministers of righteousness um uh second uh Corinthians 11 13 for such are are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as Ministers of righteousness who's in shall be according to their Works ain't that right a man in also in second Thessalonians 2 and 3 the the Apostle Paul tells us why Satan does this why does he transform himself into an angel of Light amen and he says let no man deceive you by any means for that day this day shall not come except there there come a falling away the day of the Lord and that man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition who opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worship so that he Satan asked God sent us in the temple of God showing himself that he is God ain't that right so so he God is light do you believe that that's what the Bible says in John that God is light and and yet we Paul is telling us that Satan transforms himself into an angel of Light showing himself to be God and ain't that right a man showing himself to be God but the Bible tells us there in John uh first John 1 5 God is light and in him is no Darkness at all ain't no Darkness at all ain't that right so Satan May transform himself as an angel of Light but his works are the works of darkness amen and and his power as the Bible says is the power of Darkness so he as in as an impersonator transforms himself into an angel of Light a man impersonating as God ain't that right amen but the problem is with this God is the word ain't that right God is the word now the Prophet said that Satan can impersonate any kind of gift that God has got amen he can impersonate speaking in tongues he can impersonate uh uh prophesying he can impersonate uh visions and dreams he can impersonate all kinds of things amen he can prophesy he can he can dance and shout and roll on the floor and cry and and and and and all of these things he can impersonate any gift that God's got but he cannot everybody say he cannot bring that word word by word he cannot bring that word word by word ain't that right amen and so that's what he failed in on in the Garden of Eden and that's where he always fails is he cannot bring that word word by word amen and his ministers can't do it either amen they'll take the Bible and they'll start reading and they'll take the scriptures but then they'll apply their own interpretations Amen to the Bible ain't that right now now Satan quoted uh to Eve uh the serpent quoted to Eve what everything that God said that one word amen he missed one word ain't that right amen but that one word a man uh calls death to the whole world it it caused all the corruption the sickness and the pain the death and everything is by that one word so it's important to stay with the word of God ain't that right amen for that's the only where you're going to find Christ for he is the word amen now Matthew 24 and 24 it says for there shall arise false christs or false anointed ones and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible it would deceive the very elect now now we know that that scripture that was was a prophecy speaking of this day there's never been a time in in the history of mankind that it has been such a deceptive hour amen such as a deceptive hour is in this age and and and he says that there would arise false Christ which Christ means anointed ones amen so there would be false uh uh Christ false prophets in other words the prophet said false anointed teachers of the word they can expound on the word but false Anointed with it a man anointed but they're false a man because uh uh see they they they they're putting their own slant to the word of God Amen see and and and so the prophet said they can be Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues dance shout preach the gospel and steal a devil amen anointed teachers but anointed people with false teaching ain't that right another place he said anointed ones Christ plural prophets plural see if there was if there is such a thing as cry as a Christ singular then these would have to be anointed ones that their prophecy of what they were teaching would be the difference because they are anointed ones ain't that right both anointed the true and the false anointed one but where is the difference is their teaching one is a true teaching and one is a false teaching ain't that right one is showing Christ because Christ is the word and the other one isn't showing price hey ain't that right and so it's in this day that we are commanded to look and live uh look unto Jesus and and and and be saved and come to him and find rest for our souls and yet in this day that we are to look it's in this day that false Christ and false teachers a man will arise amen and deceive the very elect if it were possible so you can see that there it is such a confusing age in this time it's an age of deception and Satan Works through deception ain't that right it's not like God saying well you know maybe you know yeah God's saying well I'm gonna go build a house and Satan said well I'll just go if you're going to build the house I'll go build a car no no that ain't that ain't it it's it's it's it's it's it's if God does something Satan's got to counteract that Satan's gotta you understand to where it's a duplicate or a uh but it's a fall ain't that right that looks like the real now now so so we've got to see him we've got to come to him we've got to look to him and so the prophet would tell us how will the people that's believing him know know it know him unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is so you'll not understand Christ outside this word you'll not seek him outside the words you'll not know him outside this word ain't that right for Daniel said the wives shall know ain't that right the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their God see the wise shall know their God now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word ain't that right a man says so now if you're just bear with me I'm not going to keep you alone but I really want to get this to you today amen the bride will only know him and as her mate her husband which he is a man no Christ be able to look at him and recognize him and come to him only by knowing the word of God Amen you've got to look in the word of God and and and but notice how the prophet called it he's the revealed word ain't that right he's the revealed word so what is he the revealed word what is Christ in you in this age the revealed word what is the message of Malachi 4 the revealed word what do we come to the revealed word what do we look at the revealed word ain't that right there is something about this revealed word that'll give rest to your soul it's true amen it's what's keeping us from Great Tribulation ain't that right yes sir now my title again is resting in thus uh saith the Lord now that's what the word of God is do you believe that it's thus saith the Lord not the Sith man not the saith Elijah not the saith uh uh Jeremiah not in the saith uh uh these things but it's thus saith the Lord now if a theologian comes a man then don't look at that and don't gather around that because you'll not see Christ there ain't that right don't look unto a denomination and don't gather around that denomination for it you'll you won't come to Christ that way for Christ is not in there if a sensation arises well don't look at that or gather around that can you say Amen because you won't see Christ in it amen there there these things have no way to bring you to Christ or reveal Christ to you amen that you know that they're they're finding what they're doing but we've got to look to Christ amen and be you saved we we've got to come to Christ amen and and find rest unto our souls so when you come uh to a theologian or a denomination or some uh idea uh sensation or whatever what you're coming to is a personality of men amen it's man's idea man's thoughts man's thing that you know and it's all built and founded upon man or a group of men ain't that right but God never told us to come to a man and and as much as people want to say that we worship brother Brandon we're not worshiping a man we ain't coming to a man can you say Amen it's not a man that you've come to it's not a building that we come to it's none of that we've come to the word the word can you say Amen the word see so so we are to come unto him and find rest in our soul look unto him and live eternally amen we know that we've only got a space that's a limited time in this Natural Life in this in this natural body that we're all going to perish amen but but we've got a way to live eternally if we can look and live be saved ain't that right well he is the word so as we've said it started as a thought of God ain't that right that's what a word starts as is a thought and then that thought was expressed into word which we call the spoken word of God and then it becomes word fulfilled or the word materialized ain't that right now when Jesus there in his day the people should have been looking for the word to be fulfilled and if they would have looked for the word to be fulfilled then they would have recognized him when he came ain't that right because Jesus did not come as a theologian he did not come as a doctor of divinity he didn't come with all these titles of of that man have today amen he did not come representing a denomination or a seminary or a Doctrine or a thought or a or a whatever he was the word made flesh can you say man so then they should have recognized him a man because in other words uh uh he he he was the Fulfillment of the word but the reason why they did not recognize him is they were looking for their own interpretation of the word to be fulfilled they had their own idea of how this Bible should have been fulfilled and when it did not be fulfilled that way then they did not believe him and yet there he was God made flesh revealing himself to the people and they crucified him ain't that right they crucified the Messiah that's why it is so important not to add or take away from the word of God Amen Deuteronomy 4 2 amen you shall not add unto the word which I command you neither shall you diminish ought from it take away faith that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you amen Matthew I believe it is or where in the New Testament John or Jesus said that man shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Revelations 22 and 18 for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of this prophecy uh uh of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book ain't that right so we are told not to add or take away because the moment you add or you take away you miss Christ you won't see him for he is the word ain't that right amen and and and the revealed word so now people have Twisted the word to fit their own devilish means amen and then they wonder why they missing Christ well you know the Bible plainly says that it's in this day that Jesus will come as a thief in the night amen as a thief in the night in other words he will come and the people will not know that he came he will come and be gone before the people realize it ain't that right but it's in that coming in that coming that we are to be awake and look and live can you say man so then he's not going to come as a thief in the night to everybody oh amen see the thief breaks into the house to get something ain't that right he goes in there to get the jewels and when he gives them Jewels he slips back out amen and takes his possession with him so here comes Jesus as a thief in the night a man to come to get who those he had redeemed he comes to get his jewels a man and when he leaves the world don't know nothing about it but those that he came for they seek him they recognize him amen so he comes and and the world will know nothing about it it's because again they have their own interpretation of the scriptures and are blind amen now look look at this and and I won't keep you much longer but second Peter 3 and 1. this Second Epistle behold I now write unto you in both which I steer up your pure Minds by way of remembrance that you be mindful of the words that which were spoken before by the prophet holy prophets and of the Commandment of us um uh the Apostles of the Lord are savior uh knowing this verse that there shall arrive there shall come in the last day scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming in other words where's the Fulfillment of his coming when is it going to happen we've heard about it for years when is it going to be ain't that right for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation ain't that right now Church they are doing that very thing today ain't that right and notice now when he comes in as a thief in the night a man and and it's in that time he comes as the thief they're asking where's the promise of his coming now think of that he comes as a thief and they're asking where is he at where's the promise of his coming notice it's in this layout of seeing that the age that this happens amen and I'd encourage all you young people and and whoever Elders too alike to listen to the church ages but but you find notice what Jesus said to this lay Odyssey and age the age that he is to come as a thief in the night the age that the world is saying where's the promise of his coming and yet he says to this layout of cnh behold I stand at the door and knock and you say Amen If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me ain't that right right at the the time at the ends of the Earth at the time that it's it's so crucial to look to him and be ye saved Amen to come unto him and find rest to your soul amen the the the the time that he comes as a thief in the night and yet the world he's standing on the outside of the church trying to get back in standing on the outside of the age trying to get back in can you say Amen he's not talking about the individual he's talking about the church ain't that right so here Jesus Christ the end this scripture tells us then shows us that Jesus Christ is making known his presence amen by the word becoming flesh again amen amen that's right it John ain't seeing him in it writing about his physical body knocking at a door he comes in this age as the word may flesh word revealed ain't that right and they reject him and the people don't see that it's him the Bible does not mention any other age in the seven Church ages where Christ is manifested in that age but this age this age this is the age that he's kicked out this is the age it's only here and when it comes to reveal himself the church World kicks him out ain't that right so what what did they kick out the revealed word the revealed word now church God cannot lie what he says he's going to fulfill you believe that amen uh as we I believe said this morning he is eternal and then that makes his word eternal he is eternal he cannot change he cannot be altered you cannot diminish God you cannot you make him any other way than what he is he's eternal his word is eternal you can't change his word you you can't diminish his word whatever he says and and so then it's up to us to find out what he really means if if we were there and we heard him say let there be light and we come up with with the tricycle see there you are God well it had been the wrong interpretation of what he said we had our own interpretation of what life should be but he already knew what light should be so then when he said let there be light and light appeared then that's God's interpretation and you say amen that's God's word revealed interpreted ain't that right yes sir see so so it doesn't matter how many years go by God's word will be fulfilled amen see Jesus said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away so so then we find uh the word was expressed through Prophets amen uh through prophets that's they they had thus set the Lord second Peter 1 and 20. it says knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God prophets right holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so it was not the words of a man it was the words of God ain't that right now maybe they didn't have the understanding of what even they were saying that it was God that knew what he would say and God knew what he was after amen second Timothy 3 16 all scripture is given by inspiration of God ain't that right so a true Vindicated Prophet is the one that has thus saith the Lord the word of the lord always everybody say always comes to the prophet amen Amos 3 and 7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets ain't that right so if any God is going to do anything it's got to be done through the prophet the word comes to the prophet ain't that right and notice the prophet prophets were called Gods amen because not of the other their stature not because of their position in the Earth but because they had the word of the Lord they had thus saith the Lord ain't that right uh John 10 34 Jesus answered them is it not written in your law that I said you are Gods see if he called them Gods the prophets unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken and here he was the word made flesh the Son of God ain't that right see so uh the prophet said if a man has the word of God it's not the man it's the word that the peoples listening to it isn't the man it's the word amen now if and if the prophets Jeremiah Isaiah Elisha if they had thus saith the Lord God said as long as that word was going from them they were Gods God said himself he was the one done the announcing because it wasn't a man he had took the man out and put himself in there to speak use the man's lips use the Man's Tongue and that man become the mouthpiece of God and when it come from God uh from that man as God speaking amen it was thus saith the Lord and there was nothing that was going to alter that word amen it would be fulfilled brother Brown says in this place and this he says check back to the Bible and see if the prophets are anything ever done anything outside of first seeing it first to be done because you can't say it's thus saith the Lord unless the Lord has said it and you know it it ain't a mythical workup or some mental emotion it isn't psychology see it is absolutely God foreshowing something that's going to happen correctly and it will happen every time do you believe that it'll happen every time it'll never fail once amen now we find that God let his the the children of Israel By His prophets remember when they wanted the king Israel decided they wanted a king and they told the prophet Samuel what they wanted and the Bible says in first Samuel 8 and 6 said the thing displeased Samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord now this broke Samuel's heart as a prophet he was he was he was the one uh over the the people and they told him we don't we don't want you we want a king and and so he cries unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the people and all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them ain't that right so we we find that the words uh uh that the prophet said this is what this is is a written word of what the spoken word was that come to the prophets ain't that right everything of this Bible is the written word of God and it it it was the leadership of of Israel amen see it was uh the prophets the word amen see God LED his people by the word of the prophets a man see and so we we find um uh that that God hearkened unto them and he told them what would happen to them a man once they get a king the king was going to take their children take their daughters amen they would be servants unto him and he would take the best of the land he would take the best of their fruits he would take the best of everything and and on and on and on and yet they said well uh they said nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the nations and that our King May judge us and go out before us and fight our battle think of that they wanted a king to be like the Nations but God made them different God made them a different Nation he didn't give them a king to rule over them he gave them a prophet because that Prophet had his words and church so isn't today God did not make us to be like everybody else and be under a denomination in the pope and and and and a bishop and and a Creed and all of that he gave us a prophet to lead us to lead us the prophets led the People by the word thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord I think two thousand times in the Old Testament you'll you'll you'll read thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord why God was leading his people through the prophets and you know where they were leading them to to the coming Messiah they were pointing them to the coming Messiah their prophecies was was speaking of coming Messiah they were leading them and you say Amen all the types and shadows but it was all speaking of Messiah coming and their prophecy was correct and God Vindicated it to be so do you believe that they were anointed and were the mouthpiece of God Amen and they were living notice they were living in the time of Prophecy prophesying of what was to come prophesying it was Christ in them speaking through them about himself ain't that right but then it changed the word became flesh the word materialized and became flesh that word that was spoken out of the mouths of prophets become material last if you notice not one of those prophets said come unto me and I'll give you rest not one of them they always pointed messiah messiah messiah's coming ain't that right and when Messiah came ain't that right amen see they just pointed to him and and Jesus was the one that they spoke of amen and if you notice Jesus never pointed to a coming Messiah all the prophets before him talked of coming Messiah talked of a redeemer talkative of him to come and and these things but when he came he never pointed to a coming Messiah a coming Redeemer a whatever he he pointed to himself I am he ain't that right and that's when he came all scriptures began to be fulfilled everything that the prophet said of the Messiah began to become to happen and come to pass and and you read the Bible this was done that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the Prophet this was done that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the prophet everything that Jesus done was the was the Fulfillment of the word of God and he said come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I'll give you rest look unto me every scripture that spoke of the Messiah was fulfilled through him and I say to you he was greater than the prophets you believe that he was greater than the prophets he was the prophecy fulfilled he was all the prophet's words put together made flesh see he was the word that came to the prophets and spoke through them that right but then he came as the word that was spoken made manifest so he the revealed word said come unto me and you shall find rest unto your souls hope it's all right but you have to know if you're going to come to him if you're going to look unto him you have to know what his promise for this day you have to know are we are we speaking of something still to come or are we at the end to our scriptures must be fulfilled amen see you you you you have to know what he promised for this day and didn't see it being fulfilled amen so don't be blinded we cannot be blinded by some interpretation of man man see if a man doesn't know about Malachi 4 do you realize if he doesn't know about Malachi 4 and if he doesn't know that it's to be fulfilled in this day he will actually miss seeing Jesus he will actually missing Christ in the Fulfillment of Malachi 4. and you say Amen that's right see everybody's got their own interpretations of what Malachi 4 means some say well that's speaking of of of John the Baptist or speaking of a group of men it's speaking of this it's speaking of that but God alone has his interpretation of what Malachi 4 means ain't that right and when it become fulfilled everybody rejected it everybody you understand but there was an elect that saw Christ the man ain't Christ right so see people are looking to a denomination they've come to a Creed or a Dogma they're looking at the man's opinion about things and all the while they're not finding rest for their souls can't look to a man can you say man yes I'm going to say it this way it's not all about brother Branham God took his servant home we're not sitting here twiddling our thumbs waiting for Brother Brown to come back to get Revival brother he's here Jesus Christ is still here in a body of people you say man but you have to find him and come to him in order to find rest so look at what the scriptures have said and promised and then watch it being fulfilled I believe that we're living in the day of Jubilee this isn't the day of denominations they've served their time this isn't a day of Creeds and dogmas they serve their time this isn't the day where personality arises there I know they're trying it but it's not the time we are not called to follow a personality we're not called to follow uh some man's ideas we're not called I don't care how anointed they are if they're drawing uh uh and pointing to their personality to their own Ministry their own kingdom it's wrong we are to look to him in this day and be saved we've been bound by these things for so long but God promised a day of Jubilee do you believe that that's right so then it's in this day that you will see him Christ in the Fulfillment of that you ain't gonna see him in a group bound are you with me I hope you're making a little sense to you you ain't gonna see him in a group that is bound and formal by traditions by false doctrines by man's and personalities no no you ain't gonna see that because that's not what God promised us in this day then you say man he promised us a Year of Jubilee to where we can break from all of them things and be a son and daughter of God in this age that's what God's called you to be do you believe that there have been scriptures that have been laying dormant for years and years do you realize that I have a week ago through the whole Bible of scriptures that speak of our day but but there are scriptures that speak all these scriptures speak of the bride of Christ amen and we we know that Adam had a counterpart and that was Eve right his bride so Jesus is the second man Adam has has a counterpart has the bride he's got his bride and so not only does the scripture speak of of the bridegroom which Jesus fulfilled as Messiah but it also speaks of that counterpart which is the Bride of Jesus Christ and all this time it's been people prophets raising up and saying she's coming she's coming she's coming he spoke of her whether it be the the wise virgin that was the bride ain't that right Revelations 19 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints that ain't something in the Millennium that's something happening right now that speaks of this day then you say Amen it's been laying dormant for 2 000 years just lay him there but in this age it's being fulfilled by a group of people called The Bride Revelations 22 15 and the spirit and the bride say come what is it the word is in the bride then you say Amen she has returned to being the mouthpiece of God in this age yes sir see so we as elective God are not foretelling of the bride of Christ that is to come we are the bride we are the Fulfillment of all scriptures that speak of the Bride you with me there's no other age to come we're at the end of this thing so Christ is not revealed as as a spoken word but he's revealed in the manifestation of the word and you say man or I should say not only in the in the in the spoken word but in the revealed word now we are living in the time of the word fulfilled we are the Fulfillment of the prophet's prophecy I got to ask you what's greater the prophet or the prophecy amen okay that stumped you you see it's Christ in you and what is Christ in you the word made manifest not a gimmick not a sensation not a good feeling you got it's the word made manifest ain't that right and if you notice it took a prophet to introduce Jesus when he came in his to the world in his physical body John the Baptist introduced him to the People by pointing him out the whole dilemma of God which taketh away the sins of the world the prophet introduced us ain't that right and Jesus being the word Jesus being the word came to the prophet not to the Theologian not to the teacher not to the the religious he came to that prophet amen and the prophet had the revelation of the word standing before them ain't that right amen but why did he have to be why was it important that Jesus be introduced because the people were steep in Traditions people had been taught over and over and over traditions of men interpretations of man of what Messiah should be when he would come and how he would come and when he would come and where he would come and and all of these things and and and and and so it left the people in confusion it left the people in darkness because no matter what their interpretation was it never changed God's reality it never changed what God's interpretation was ain't that right it never in in it never changed amen saved but but they didn't have him born in a as a baby in a Manger they didn't have him coming to a prophet that that was just a wild man coming down to the creek amen uh they didn't have him that way they had him coming in in in in in in other ways you know but but so it took a prophet to introduce him to the people that that elect could know Christ when he came amen so have we had a prophet in this age can you say Amen we've had a prophet Malachi 4 5. behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse can you say man now as I close it's the prophet that has the Divine interpretation of the word theologians will come and will interpret their own in their own thoughts about the word but when a prophet comes he has no thought on of his own he is the mouthpiece of God and he gives us the correct interpretation of what this Bible is that way we can see him Christ revealed then you say man and he's revealed in his own word oh not just because we've gathered but he's revealed in his word ain't that right and the people are walking in darkness today and he's come as a thief in the night and there's some Jewels he's come for and I I just have to tell you I'm one of them I'm one of them and and I I've come to him I've come to him and I'm finding Rest In My Soul I'm finding more that this message is more than just a man I see God over that man and I that's where the message really come from amen he just used the mouthpiece can you say man amen and the prophet could take that word and place the scriptures we didn't know what the word meant we had no idea but as he even said he was a Baptist amen and and had Baptist ways and all that but when the word was revealed to him he said this book become a new book and I say to you this book has become a new book and it's not only just a new book it's actually we see it now in flesh the word is being made flesh in a group of people Christ made real can you say man it's a body of Christ upon the earth that is fulfilling every prophecy that speaks of her in this day I say to you look and live house look and live come and find rest find rest for your soul Allelujah the prophet has the Divine correct interpretation you remember in the Old Testament God wrote some words on the wall and that word could not be interpreted no one knew the meaning of that word the king he called all the his soothsayers and diviners and all of these guys in told him what he would give them if they would interpret the meaning of the words that God had put on the wall they had no idea I couldn't tell it the King was troubled he was upset about it but then his wife I believe it was his wife says hey hold it be it rest O King there's a man that was in your father's Kingdom that he gave the interpretation of a dream to your father calling call him have him to come he'll interpret it they called that old Prophet Daniel amen and the King says I've heard that that the gods of gods is in you that you have that gift to Divine or to interpret in in these things and and Daniel under the unctioning of the Holy Ghost began to interpret what the words of God had put on that wall can you say man and church this interpretation has been sealed up it's been hid it's it's been you know uh uh from the foundation of the world but men have put their own ideas to what the Rapture should be oh my they put their own ideas as to what the resurrection is they put their own ideas to all kinds of things some say we're still in the you know I had one man tell me he said well we're in the sixth Church age I looked I said oh my in my heart I'd say God I thank God for a prophet you'll see everybody has tried to interpret the words of the book and they've not been able to but here come a lamb the lamb that opened the seals as we talked about this morning but he had to have a prophet on the earth and when he had that profit he come and gave the book to the prophet and the prophet began to reveal the true interpretation of the book can you say Amen now we understand what's happening we understand the day that we're living in we understand that we're not looking for another church age but now we're looking for an eternal Church age we're understanding that we're at the end of time we're at the end of everything but it's at this time that the manifestation of the sons of God is to be revealed ain't that right all scriptures concerning this bride is to be revealed now and so where do you see him where do you seem Church Christ in me Christ in me and you shall find rest you shall find rest to your soul can you say man so here come the prophet in this age the Lord said I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he gave that Prophet to us to give us the correct interpretation of the word for this day and by doing so he came to introduce Jesus Christ to us they're revealed manifested word of God and I say to you this message reveals Christ if you cannot see Christ it's because you're blinded by traditions may God and remember it's in this age is it not in the age of laodicea that he tells you I've got Isaac come to me and anoint thy eyes with thyself so that thou may see right it's in this age why you can't see him if you're blind can you say Amen all do you love him we could go on and on about this but if the mess of the Earth the musicians will come this message is Christ cannot separate this message from Christ Christ the revealed word Christ The Living Word amen and we have found rest for our souls praise the Lord do you love the Lord can we just sing the song I love him I love him oh I love him
