Supernatural working within us amen and uh it's certainly good to see everyone in the house of the Lord and uh see everyone is surviving the cat so this is good and um uh it's always good to be uh gathered with God's people amen and the musicians can be dismissed but uh just to say happy 51st anniversary to brother Terry and sister Alice and um uh we certainly appreciate them and I tell you these days staying together for that many years is a miracle um and they are a a great example to all of us amen and we certainly love brother Terry and sister Alice and their love for the Lord and this message amen and um we just appreciate him coming driving all that way you know they live on the other side of Rome Oak and uh so they they uh Drive um a ways to come to church and we certainly appreciate their effort and their faithfulness and and um their their love praise the Lord and um if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms and uh we've been reading this verse and I'm going to read it again and um but also uh next Sunday afternoon we'll be having question and answers again so um uh we look forward to that amen and um there there won't be any service this evening but um also um I had just got news uh there in in my office just before I came up of um of a group of Believers in Pakistan and um trying to fix that map but um uh in Pakistan that is about to lose their Church uh Church property they they bought it um uh 13 years ago and um out the Clear Blue uh a Muslim man has um come and U says that he owns that property and uh is wanting them to move and is threaten threatening to bulldoze the building down and uh so they've taken it to the authorities the authorities uh have heard both sides and they they are agreeing with the Believers uh but this this uh man he's um he's he's produced a title and uh saying that it's his but um the the Believers have also produced a title saying that it's theirs and the man that they bought it from is no longer I guess he's either not living or he's well he's just not around so I don't know um and in in them places Muslims have the they Superior it doesn't matter what they say so to speak and so but the uh the authorities had told this man that he's going to have to U negotiate with the Believers and so he is demanding uh $99,000 they've got to have $99,000 and um actually they've got to have it in four days and um so brother uh I guess brother Hughes was up there and so brother Wayne had asked him to check all the documents and uh to make sure everything's legit and um um you know with the church's documents and things like that and um uh brother Hugh sent back a video saying it is it is legit the church does have a legit um standing and they are not this isn't a scam this isn't something just to get money whatever everything they brother Hughes has found is is right on and so if if you all would uh like to help in that way if anyone would like to help to give money um um you could give it to brother Tim and uh we we can get it sent uh over and uh try to help um I know we're a small church but uh think anything would help at this point and there's other churches of course that U uh I'm sure hopefully will uh help out in this situation and um we're we're we're blessed to have what we have here and um I I feel sorry for well for the the the people there and so I would love to help as much as we can and so anyway if you would like to give you've got something to give uh you can give it to brother Tim and um we'll make sure that they get it amen you love the Lord amen amen uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and uh just talk to our Lord father we're so glad to be called your children and we enter into this place with Thanksgiving and to your courts with praise father because we have so much to be thankful for even though we're living in a rough time a a time of uncertainty in life yet we have a bright future and Lord we know that our future is in your hands our life is in your hands and I just thank you Lord thank you for saving our soul thank you for answering the many prayers now father we just ask that you would come and meet with us today Lord that you would speak to us Lord through your word for father your word is creative no matter what the situation we may be going through or the mountain that we're facing your word Lord is the superiority over at all and I just pray father that you would anoint me and Lord that I could just yield myself to you and you could just use these mortal lips to speak to us your people Lord just anoint the the ears and the hearts of your people today Lord we just give it all to you now and just ask that you would bless that group of Believers there in that country and that you would provide for them Father Lord we thank you in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen and amen um so we want to look at Psalms the 46th chapter and um the first verse it says God is our refuge and strength a very present help and trouble therefore will not we fear uh though the Earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof Sal um there is a river the streams whereof it shall make glad the city of God and the Holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early in other words he'll help her in the dawning of the day amen then if you'll turn to the uh 62nd chapter Psalm 62 and um we'll look at the uh first verse there amen Psalms uh 62 and 1 truly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved then go down to the sixth verse he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved in God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us salom amen you can have your seats this morning and um I'm again going to use the title he's a present help in trouble and if you notice um David says he only is my raw walk and my salvation and the the prophet says that one one Christian can represent all believers one one Christian in the Bible and so uh we we look at that David then would represent all believers of all ages and uh this is exactly how every believer feels toward God he only is my rock and my salvation now we uh we don't serve the Lord because it's just the family way of doing it uh we don't serve him uh you know well we don't serve him to escape hell even um we we uh Christianity isn't just uh something that we put in our busy schedule along with everything else and and then you know if if we're just getting too busy then we just scratch that part out and and uh that that's that's not uh the way Believers serve God but uh as as we read there uh every believer fulfills what the psalmist said trust trust trust in him at all times trust in him at all times and so uh it is the way of a Believer to seek God for help amen that's just the way the believer is uh Psalm 70 And1 it says make haste oh God to deliver me make haste to help me oh Lord in the fifth verse I am poor and needy make haste unto me oh God Thou Art my help and my deliverer oh Lord make no tearing and so this is this is why prayer is such an vital part important part to the believer is because we we realize that God Alone is our Rock and our Salvation it's it's just something there and the reason why we hold to him at God uh more than anything else is because we believe in the Supernatural and and we know that God is Supernatural and and his actions are Supernatural and and so we we know that when we're up against the wall uh we we don't despair we we don't fall apart because we believe that God we just believe in the Supernatural and so we cry unto him to work in the Supernatural now in in 2 Chronicles uh the 14 th chapter the 11th verse the enemy came in against King ASA a man uh which was um I believe King over Israel or or Judah or uh uh uh but he was King there and and the enemy had come against him to destroy him and and in the 11th verse there it says and ASA Cried unto the Lord his God and said Lord it is nothing with thee to help I I think that's the right approach when we when we're asking God for help it's it's it's nothing with you to help uh whether with many or with them that have no power help us oh Lord Our God for we rest on thee how many's resting on him amen we we rest on thee and in thy name we go against this multitude oh Lord Thou Art Our God let no man Prevail against thee let not man Prevail against thee and and so what this this is the approach that every believer has toward God it's not blame it's not God why are you allowing this to happen to me and and why do I have to go through this and God look look look where I'm at and and I just I don't understand you're just not fair and and all of these things but but but the believer just looks at God and says God I need your help it's it's just common that we go through things it's human that that we Face things but but but the believer knows where to go for help amen and to cry out too as I have stated you know uh we are living in in the time of of trouble there is trouble on every hand and and um the the trouble that I'm not speaking or the yeah that I'm speaking of is is is not the trouble that we go through in maybe in our personal lives of maybe like your your your car breaking down or uh uh you know you needing money to to to pay the light bill or or or uh needing a job or whatever that that's not the trouble that I'm talking about now now we've all we all have our personal troubles that we go through and and uh there there's been people in need um ever ever since uh man fell into sin uh people have uh experienc needs in their life and and God's people has had times of trouble to where they needed God uh to heal them they needed God to protect them from danger they needed God to come on the scene and and and provide the need or uh uh uh heal them from a dead deadly disease or or or whatever and and and God has always been a a help in the time of our trouble our personal trouble uh that we've gone through and I I thinking of a of a young man there in the Old Testament uh who had borrowed an axe uh from his neighbor a friend and and uh he needed it to to chop some wood and and he was there by the the Jordan River and and as he began to chop he was swinging at a and the ax said uh the Bible says it was made out of iron and and it it it flew off the handle and went in the river and and sunk to the bottom and and the young man he he began you know to to panic cuz he had borrowed the axe and and so he had went to the man of God to to find help in the in the time of trouble for he knew that the word of the Lord come to the prophet and that God was with that Prophet the Supernatural and and and the Bible says that the Prophet come and and uh and and I I can't remember everything that happened but I do know this that the Bible says that God caused that AED to swim amen it swam to the shore now you know that's God being a help in the time of trouble amen and you may have not had such a thing like that but but God has been your help God has been my help in the time of trouble we we have no reason to complain about life we we have no reason to Grumble about the things that we go through because if we stop and we look at it every situation in that we've gone through you couldn't be here today if it had not been for the grace of God to help you in the time of trouble amen and so often we forget about these things that that that God has but every believer has a testimony of God moving on the scene for them in some way or another and and and to be honest uh uh God has been a help to the unbeliever as well amen every morning they get up amen God gives them breath God gives them a heartbeat God gives them that chance to serve him God gives him that them that chance He blesses them sometimes we look at it and think man the unbeliever has has far greater uh uh uh blessings well you know than than what we have but in that day they'll be without excuse on that day amen because God has been good amen to both unbeliever and the believer ain't that right amen but the unbeliever won't acknowledge that they but but we as Believers realize that God Alone is our Rock and he is our our Salvation amen see but so so we all go through the time of trouble and God has been a help but the time of trouble that I'm speaking of is of course the Great Tribulation that is is uh uh soon at hand and and you know uh we've talked about it but the prophets uh uh uh David and and Daniel for told of this time of trouble uh there in in Daniel 121 uh at that time shall Michael now we know Michael uh is Christ it's uh it's it's he's he's Christ and Michael shall stand up the great Prince uh which standeth for the people of thy children and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book amen now now I believe that this is tied to re Gans 10:1 the mighty Angel amen coming down with an open book in his hand and the prophet said that angel is none other than Christ himself and he comes to claim his redeemed he comes to claim his redeemed and and and and that Redemption claim is a Deliverance do you believe that I I it's not just to make us church members it's it it it's not to give us a a religious feeling but this Redemption claim is a Deliverance he comes to deliver everyone that is found written in the book the Lamb's Book of Life amen now we read this uh last Sunday I believe but Ezekiel 34:12 as a Shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will I seek out my Sheep amen and will deliver them amen and think of that the shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep see that are scattered so will I amen I come amongst them I'll seek out my sheep and deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the Cloudy and dark day now the prophet said God today is not going to deliver his people by education he never promised to do that he's not going to deliver them by theology never promised to do that he's not going to deliver them by science he never promised to do it he's not going to deliver them by denomination he never promised to do that but he will deliver them by the power Supernatural power of changing their lives and molding them into Sons or children of God Amen so everyone found written in the book amen that Lamb's Book will be delivered now you know David also foretold of this time of trouble amen we've read it psalms 27 And1 the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear amen see when when the Lord is your light he's your salvation when he's your rock there there's there's no no no reason to fear see and and and how different that is with the believer and the world for for we see that fear is gripping the world but but I shall not fear for for the Lord is my light the Lord is my salvation he only is my rock a ain't that right see the Lord is the strength of my life he's the preserver of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though and ho should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing if I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock ain't that right so again brother brandham used that scripture to build his thought uh when he preached uh the message the Rapture amen and and so then we find that God even mentions the time of trouble amen uh to job uh telling him that he had reserved the Treasures of the hail against the time of trouble against the day of battle and War amen see so God even foretold of this time of trouble that is at hand but again the Believers don't have to fear for the Lord is a help in time of trouble now uh if you look and I've got a lot of scriptures this morning so you bear with me but um and I think it would be good just to study them out uh uh in in your daily devotion but uh Psalms 37 and 37 Mark the perfect man behold the upright for the end of that man is peace can you say Amen think of that no wonder you don't have to fear the end of this man the perfect man that upright man and it's not the perfect man in his moral uh uh uh duties or uh standards or or whatever amen there's only one that makes us perfect and that's the blood of Jesus Christ amen he hath perfected once for all them that are Sanctified ain't that right so mark that perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace but the transgress shall be destroyed together amen the end of the wicked shall be cut off but the Salvation everybody say the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him not trusting in the stock market not trusting in a politician not trusting in the government not trusting in a church not trusting in a personality but trusting in the Lord amen see and so Psalms 41 And1 blessed is he that consider the poor War the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble the Lord will preserve him and keep him alive amen and he shall be blessed upon the Earth and thou Wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies amen and I I don't really think it's keep him and alive in the fact that that that we don't die there's Believers that do die but but they're not dead believer that is that goes in the ground uh the the the Bible calls says they're asleep amen they're asleep because they aren't dead God has kept them alive and we will see them again amen see and and so uh uh uh God will not deliver the believer uh uh unto his enemies to the whe of his enemies I'm so glad for that so the the True Believer has a promise that in the time of trouble God will be a help he's present to help amen now the whole world knows that trouble lays ahead they know that trouble is is is here and it's getting worse they they know that they know that it's a different kind of trouble than any other trouble that's the that the world has ever uh known and and because never before has fear been so prominent in the hearts of men hearts of people as it is today you know they come up with this sign uh saying a few years ago no fear no fear no fear you know and and and what you know but and and it it's a sign of toughness you know you can't do me you can't scare me and and all of these things but it the prophet said it's kind of like the boy that's going through the the the graveyard and and whistling and and and he's he's doing that because he's scared but he's trying to convince him he's not scared and so this is why we've got comedy this is why we got the pleasure this is why we got all of this is the world is trying to convince themselves amen that everything's okay when they know that it's not okay and fear really is in the hearts of men can you say amen amen and and so they they know amen Luke 21:25 Jesus for told of this day and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring now you know brother Bram said that's the tidal waves that we're experiencing you know they thought we were going to have a tidal wave in California the other day uh uh California had a seveno whatever on the Reus scale uh six miles under the ocean and uh uh uh they they they thought it they were warning people sonomy and and all these things and and and but but we we know that earthquakes and things are are ramping ramping up as uh uh by the day and and and so he said Jesus says for the powers or he says and men's Hearts failing them for fear why for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken now we so we know we're living in that day we're not looking for that day to come it's happening right now people don't know what to do everything that they're trusting in amen is falling apart people don't know who to trust what to trust aen and most of of what they're doing is is a gamble it's it's just well I'm going to try this and see if it works I'm going to try this see if it works and and and it's just no one trust anything anymore and so but a person who has any kind of spiritual understanding knows that this scripture is being played out now uh uh it it's just the facts and and so people are looking after those things which are coming upon the Earth and we we know as Believers and as message Believers tribulation is setting in amen it isn't just a time of trouble that's just going to pass away like like uh like like our little troubles they they come and they go you know understand what I'm saying this trouble amen is is something that's going to remain amen because God is doing something it's it's setting in amen and and we we we also know by the message that since the opening of the the seals the six seal has to do with the Great Tribulation and it's a time this time of trouble is when God's Wrath is poured out upon the earth now the world is looking to a political educated genius to stop the trouble and and believe it or not they they think they found him they think they found him that he's going to stop all wars and and is the Golden Age going to bring in the Golden Age I got good news for him they ain't found him nothing is going to stop this time of trouble amen you see because it's already been written you know God says uh you know and and I I I I feel like this this nation is exactly the way God is speaking here in Deuteronomy 32 and 28 they are a nation void of counsel neither is there any understanding in them oh that they were wise that they understood this that they would consider their latter end if you go to the Third 5th verse to me belongeth Vengeance and recompense their foot shall slide in due time for the day of their Calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them make haste see for the Lord shall judge his people and repent himself for his servants when he seeth their that their power is gone and there is none shut up or left see and and in other words no nothing preserved see and he shall say where are their gods their Rock in whom they have trusted you see this is where we're coming down to amen people have trusted in everything but God they have trusted in politics they have trusted in their own strength they've trusted in their 401k or whatever they've trusted in the government they trusted in their abilities they trusted in their finances they trusted in in their materialistic things and they trusted in everything entertain amen instead of God Amen and and and God now is telling them amen that he's going to say where are their gods their Rock in whom they've trusted which did eat the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings let them rise up and help you and be your protection see see now that I even I am he and there is no God with me I kill and I make a alive I wound and I heal neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand you remember that the Bible says there's going to come a time where every every tongue and every knee is going to Bow before Him and acknowledge that he is Lord ain't that right amen see for I the 40th verse for I lift my hand to heaven and I and say I live forever if I wet my glittering sword and mine hand take hold on judgment I will render Vengeance to mine enemies and will reward uh them that hate me I will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh and that the blood of the slain and of the captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy Rejoice oh ye nations with his people amen for he will avenge the blood of his servants and will re render Vengeance to his adversaries and will be merciful unto his land and to his people can you say Amen see so this is a time of trouble that cannot be kept away amen from po by politics it cannot be kept away amen by World Peace it cannot be kept Away by United Nations amen they're trying Every Which Way Amen to stop this trouble from from coming on see amen and and I'll say this the church can't even prophesy it away amen you can't even pray long enough and hard enough Amen to keep this trouble away amen for it's already been written amen 1 Thessalonians 5:2 for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night and when they shall say sa peace and safety then sudden destruction ction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape ain't that right see they they're not realizing the time that we're in they they just see this as just a democratic trouble as something of a of a political party bringing trouble but what they don't know is the world is falling apart because tribulation is coming amen we're right on the verge amen of this and it is already heading in now I find a parallel between Israel and the church today when Israel turned to idol worship which is idolatry uh they they got into trouble and and the world is steeped the church um is steeped in idolatry worshiping numerous of Idols so so many Idols that that you can't it take uh hours and probably days di mention uh of these things but now we're not talking about the elect because the elect worship God only ain't that right the elect he only is their Rock he only is their salvation see and and so but but notice amen uh uh uh uh here David again uh uh Psalms 2211 be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help they of that now there is none to help girlfriends can't help you boyfriends can't help you that's right pleasure can't help you Hollywood can't help you getting wrapped up in sports can't help you can you say amen amen there is none to help see so he's he's he's looking to God because there's nothing in the earth that's going to help in the time of trouble amen Psalm 60 and11 give us help from trouble for vain everybody say vain is the help of man vain is the help of man I it it doesn't matter what politician what what side gets into office vain is the help of man it it doesn't matter if if if if we go all the way up to the pope vain is the help of man there's nothing that's going to be able to help in the time of trouble but the believer looks to God amen now these two scriptures that we just read are are so foreign to humanity today uh and and we have been living in what is called uh the day of man right man's day yeah and and the prophet tells us man's day is the number six yeah that's right it was on the sixth day that God created man man's day see brother Bram said man's day is man's doing yes sir man's work man's Church man's idea of worship it's man's everything for it is man's world cosmos A ain't that right see so so we've been living in this time of of man's day man's glorification see it's a day where we have worldly conglomeration of gity and and mess and de possessed things on this Earth whether it's in the church or or whether it's out in the world Amen and if I could say it this way discern the spirit that's behind [Music] things amen see then then we go on about man's day brother BR said it's a day where the world is dedicating themselves to the knowledge which came by Satan and man's day is glorified not by the word of God but by the knowledge that he has man's day is a day when people are worshiping Satan in this day thinking they're worshiping God but they're worshiping him through a Creed man-made denominations and Creeds that's brought the people right down to the greatest deception the world has ever known see it's a day when the people are exalting man and his accomplishments right amen ain't that right it it's the day that the works amen by the knowledge of man is glorified Amen brother BR says look what see all the brag of the Communist see somebody trying to get somebody to the Moon he said well God's trying to get people to Heaven not to the stupid moon but that's a great accomplishment we may never go to the Moon brother Tim but we're going higher than the moon God's our help see says and and look they're they're trying to get somebody to the Moon look how they're spending millions and billions and trillions of dollars in a wasted effort and when they get there they ain't going to find nothing let them go to the go to Mars they ain't going to find what they're looking for hello it's man's day amen he said see his Works Satan's works are exalted above God's word and manifested works see the wisdom of Satan which he gave to Eve at the beginning now listen don't miss this the wisdom of Satan is exalted to the throne of worship in man above the Vindicated word for of God for the hour our churches prove that by their seminaries and schools of learning that's learned more than God's word knows about it they think see and there doct so and so and teacher so and so and professors so and so has exalted their own knowledge so-called from Satan truth see so-called truth from Satan above the Vindicated promise of God made clear right before them and man falls for it because it's the day of man see so the prophet says uh this is not God's day see God is the God of this Earth see or God is not the God of this Earth the Bible says he isn't he's the god of heaven so but this is not God's day that we're living in God's day is not filled of full of man's knowledge and man exalting himself and and and man's works and and Satan being glorified and lifted up God's day is not a day of deception amen and you say Amen so so man's day is is is a day where man's faith in God and His word is almost uh uh extinct yeah faith is slow yes sir people put more value in a doctor's words than they do God's word they put more value in man's word than God's word they they they put more value in a politician word than they do God's word ain't that right and so the people of the age they're they are letting science and education dictate their faith the educated professionals have taken the preeminence over God's word we have doctors of divinity philosophers lecturers psychologists in the pulpits yeah no longer are are they they The Minister's spirit filled and believing in the Supernatural brother Bram say man's day it's a day where men of God who are preaching this truth gospel are mocked and scorned man's day is a is a day where man is judged by man amen can you say amen and he says in this uh another place this is the day of men that's the reason they slam you around and do what they want to with you they mock you they scorn you for your stand for the gospel and for the truth it's man's day yeah exactly come on now you remember Jehovah God come in flesh and man got a hold of him and spit upon Him tried on him tried to push him over the brow of the hill but they got him they spit on on him they mocked him they whipped him they slapped him they stripped him brother Braham said they stripped him naked and embarrassed him the god of Heaven because it's man's day true amen and he says right now the world does what it wants to with the Christian they call him all manner of evil names making fun of him he said they call you now Holy Roller and fanatic but there will be a time come see they won't do that they'll scream and whail and fall at your feet can you say Amen why he says another place they will well and how for the lamb is coming in see wrath with his wrath to judge the world Amen now listen now amen Malachi 4:3 and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the SES of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of host brother Ram says there are there there there'll not be left root nor Branch nothing to come back to oh my what a time of trouble yeah that's coming nothing to come back to ain't going to be no sin pop up again ain't no unbelief going to pop back up again this is a total Deliverance for the elect you believe that nothing to come back to they'll be done now when will this take place we read the scripture Wednesday night Malachi 4:2 but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall remember amen this healing that he's talking about is not a physical healing he's not referring to amen a healing of some sickness a healing of whatever this healing has to do with our body change corruption being put away and incorruption setting in giving way to incorruption Mortal mortality giving way to immortality can you say Amen oh do you love him see he shall rise with healing in his wings showing that he is a present help in the time of trouble now notice this happens in the day of the Lord now brother Bram says the day of the Lord is when the judgments fall and after that comes the Millennium so this this tribulation is nothing it's judgments falling upon the Earth falling upon mankind amen those that had refused the the full atonement of the word yes sir amen can you say amen that's right now notice amen the prophet would tell us the Lord's day everybody say the Lord's day now we're not talking about man's day we're talking about the Lord's day two different days two different things the Lord's Day is when the days of man are over and the kingdoms of this world will then become the kingdoms of our God they have tried to silence God they have tried to put him out they can put him out of the church they can put him out of our nation they can put him out of our schools they can put him out of our homes but they'll never do away with God for the day of God is here God's going to raise up his kingdoms God's going to show himself mighty God's going to show himself to be present never changing the same yesterday today and forever that's right thank God and at this time the world isn't going to find help now let's just read Revelation 6 and12 and behold or and I beheld and when he had opened the Sixth Seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black and as sackcloth of hair and and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell onto the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and the Rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand what a time now notice at this time it's a time of judgment Mercy will be over ain't that right because blood is no longer on The Mercy Seat that's right amen Revelations 22:11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still he that is filthy amen let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is Holy let him be holy still see so then it's going to be a time as God told Israel in Jeremiah 2:26 as the Thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house of Israel ashamed their kings their princes their their priests their Prophet saying to a stock Thou Art my father and to a stone thou Hast brought me forth see oh my amen a ain't that just dumb looking at a stone and saying Thou Art my father thou has brought me forth but isn't that amazing that men will worship things that it has not nothing to do with their salvation has nothing to do with their help and they look to it as their help it isn't even a living substance and yet they pray to Idols they pray to things oh Church you you know what they're doing today so to the stone thou has brought me forth see for they have turn their back unto me and not their face but in the time of trouble they will say arise and save us but where are their gods that thou H has made thee right let them arise if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble for according to the number of thy cities are thy Gods oh Judah ain't that right amen they they'd rather go they'd rather go to a basketball game a football game than they do the house of God then let them basketball players and let them sports stars and players save them in this time of [Music] trouble got to the place that church that they they will they will take a break I know of Assembly of God Church in in in Oklahoma my uncle and them used to go to that that now this is Assembly of God Pentecostal church that they had Church on the day of Super Bowl but time and and but when they had church when they had church was on halftime they brought the TV to church so they could all watch Super Bowl and during halftime which is what 30 minutes I've never watched Super Bowl I think it's 30 minutes or so hour they had church now it tells you where the priorities are most people are that way today we were having Church in a in a Presbyterian Church in in Pennsylvania and and and uh it on super bow you know and some dear precious lady she come and s in most of our service and at the end of it she says aren't we supposed to be watching Super Bowl I said no ma'am you're in the wrong place she says I guess I am oh but where are these Gods that's going to be able to save them in that day right you understand what I'm saying where's these Geniuses that's going to be able to help they seem to have the answers come on brother because God's going to show them in this time of trouble that they ain't got no answer not to help in this time of trouble now brother Braham says I don't know the minute or hour but I know I know everything is fulfilled and ready for the Rapture the church is called out it'll be a secret going just vanish and that'll be all and the world go right on just the same people preaching people thinking they're getting saved just exactly like they did in the days of Noah and so forth Noah entered into the ark and the people went right on the world turning just the same think of it and eternally lost thinking they're saved what a time can you say Amen see so this trouble is a trouble like never before now Psalms 7:17 break it in it says the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the Lord upholdeth the righteous amen the Lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be forever they shall not be ashamed in the evil time the world's going to be ashamed by the gods that they have served when he comes amen and shows himself they're going to be bearers they're going to be ashamed but they the righteous shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied he's a present help in the time of trouble ain't that right now notice Psalms 37 and 23 amen the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord and by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him in his or with his hand aren't you glad for that amen see so so in this time of trouble amen there there is God pouring out his wrath amen and it's it's already beginning if if you understand what I'm saying here the world is not going to fall apart it is is falling apart amen that's true look at nature and how the upset and even in nature yeah the seasons brother Bram said it shows It's The Sign of the times ain't that right now David was a perfect example of the righteous man he had fail made many EX mistakes but not one time did David turn his back on God and start worshiping Idols hello he failed God he sinned against God but he never got to a point that he look to other things for his help remember he even had a chance to remember he said I you know wasn't he given the choice to either fall in the hands of man or in the fall in the hands of God he had the chance but he says I let me fall into the hands of God for he is merciful he never found man to be equal or above God he never found man to be such a position that he appeals to man instead of God come on Church even if you don't feel like you're you're going to make it there is something about a believer that will never look into to the world and try to find that satisfaction he'll look to God it's just something about a Believer now now look see that's the way of a righteous man see uh uh uh uh David says here in 84 and2 my so longth yay even fainteth for the courts of the Lord my heart and my flesh crith out for the Living God in another place he said my soul followeth hard after thee that's the righteous man come on church that's the righteous man there's so many enticements out in this world but God remains God to us there's not one God of this world that has satisfied and been able to be compared to the god that we serve that's right all [Music] right now if you notice six is the man's day notice what a prophet said but seven is his day of redemption Lord six is man's day six man's day man's Works man's idea man everything is exalted of God in man's day Satan is become God of worship the God of this evil world but seven is God's day of redemption oh my name you remember when Jesus said when you see these things begin to happen look up your Redemption draweth nigh yes sir amen if you notice there is that other day that God speaks of the Bible speaks of and that's the day of the Lord not man's day but the day of the Lord the Lord's day brother Bri said the Lord's Day is when man's days are over it's finished ain't that right now this day is a Time notice now this this is a time of trouble for the wicked and yet this is a time of redemption for the righteous true Isaiah 2 and12 for the do day of the Lord of host shall be upon everyone that is proud and lofty and upon everyone that is lifted up and he shall be brought low and upon all the Cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up and upon all the Oaks of Bashan and upon all the high mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up and upon every Tower and upon every fenced wall and upon all the ships of Tarsus and upon all Pleasant pictures and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down when at the day of the Lord and the Hess of men shall be made loow and the Lord alone everybody say the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day and the idols he shall utterly abolish now I'm trying to tell you of this time of trouble isn't like anything else this day that you're living in is not like any other day all Idols God is going to utter abolish and they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the Earth for the fear of the Lord remember the men's Hearts failing them for fear not happening in other any other age but this age come on now hello and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the Earth in that day the day of the Lord shall a Man cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold which they made for each one for himself to worship to the Moes and to the bats to go into the Cliffs of the rocks and into the tops of the Ragged rocks for fear of the Lord in other words everything that they have trusted in is now they're finding there ain't no help amen what they found comfor in and what they indulged in and the Lord kept telling them repent repent and they were able to shut their ears and their minds off by the pleasures of life now they're going to have to come face to face with it that's right amen they were able to make excuses in in in one day but now when the day of the Lord comes there ain't no excuse ain't G to be able to walk out of church and and join another church because that old crazy preacher just keep preaching amen against you that's right on the Lord himself shall come the day of the Lord shall come and men that they have trusted in their Idols it'll all be Cast Away you understand now so he says see that go into the Cliffs of the rocks and into the tops of the Ragged rocks for fear of the Lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth Isaiah 13:6 how ye for the day of the Lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pains and Sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed at one another their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the Sinners thereof out of it Joel 1:15 alas for the day for the day of the Lord is at hand and as a destruction from the almighty shall it come Joel 2 and 1 I hope this all right this morning blow ye the trumpet in Zion and sound an alarm in my Holy Mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the Lord cometh for it is now at hand a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and of thick Darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and a strong there hath never been the like neither shall be anymore after it even to the years of many generations and fire devith before them and behind them a flame burneth the the land is as the Garden of Eden before them and behind them a desolate Wilderness yay and nothing shall Escape them the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and as Horsemen so shall they run amen like the noise of Chariots on the top of mountains shall they leap like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble as a strong people set in battle array before their face the people shall be much pained all faces Shall Gather Blackness they shall run like Mighty Men they shall climb the wall like Men of War and they shall March everyone on his ways and they shall not break the ranks neither shall one thrust one another neither uh uh thrust another uh they shall walk everyone in his path and when they fall upon this world they shall not be wounded they shall not run to or fro in the city they shall run upon the wall they shall climb upon the houses they shall enter in at the Windows like a thief the Earth shall Quake before them the heaven shall tremble the sun and the moon shall be dark and the sun sh or the Stars shall withdraw their shining and the Lord shall utter his voice before his army for his Camp is very great for he is strong that ex executeth his word for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible who can abide it you see the day of the Lord is a judgment day it's a time of God's Wrath not a time of God's mercy this world has been given Mercy yes sir and they've spurned it they've rejected it now it becomes a day of judgment ain't that right and remember it's at the ends of the Earth that the day of the Lord comes yes Lord amen ain't that right or we could say it this way when the day of the Lord comes then comes the ends of the Earth now notice second Peter 3 and10 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night so so now think of that the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night it comes in gradually not just it comes in slowly gradually as a thief in the night in which the heavens notice at the day of the Lord this time of trouble the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements uh uh uh shall melt with fervent Heat and the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up see so the day of the Lord brings on the tribulation where the Earth will be purified of all of man's works all of man's Idols all the germs and the filthiness and the you understand brother bradam said see this is the day of men men are fighting right Nation against Nation wars and rumors of wars but the day of the Lord will come when these kingdoms will become the day of our Lord and of his Christ see now notice though also the Rapture everybody say the Rapture the Rapture happens in the day of the Lord hello tribulation sets in in the day of the Lord a day of judgment a day when God pours out his wrath remember the Bible in Malachi calls it the great and terrible day of the Lord ain't that right but then we see that the Rapture happens in the day of the Lord notice now uh uh 1 Thessalonians 5 and two uh we we read this but uh uh part of it already but it says for you know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night say it again the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night right you look at that and tie it with the message the prophet always takes that for the Rapture can you say amen for when they shall say peace and safety are we not in that age bringing in a golden age everything going to be okay look at all of them prophesying that's right then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape so what is the day of the Lord It's the coming of the lord it's the age of rapture can you say Amen notice Revelation 16:15 Jesus says behold I come as a thief hello see so his coming will be as a thief in the night am the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night this is exactly what Paul was speaking of in in in or referring to in first Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God do you know that the only thing this message has effect upon is God's elect the others ridicule it the others mock it the others burn it but it's for the elect amen so the day of the Lord is is is the coming of the Lord it comes as a thief in the night in Revelations 10:1 Paul John saw what Paul was talking about I saw another Mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the book and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun his feet as pillars of fire remember everyone whose name is written in that book shall be delivered remember this is not two different comings John is not talking of one coming and Paul talking of a different coming it's the same coming and if you know notice when they're talking about this coming they're not talking about judgment like all the others are talking of judgment can you say amen that's right see but they are showing that he comes as a present help to that elect that predestinated seed in their time of trouble that is true amen Lord he comes he comes to claim what he has redeemed amen aren't you glad for that and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord oh my that ought to make us happy today praise the Lord to think of it he comes not to destroy us but to be our present help in the time of trouble did you know the prophet said the dead in Christ cannot come forth until he takes the rights of redemption he said see and now he walks forth from a mediator where death put us in the grave he comes forth with the rights amen and even those who are alive and remain till his coming shall not hinder them which are asleep for the The Trumpet Of God shall sound at that last trumpet when the last seal is broke how many believes the last seal is broke that seventh seal is broken and when the seventh Angel's given his message the last trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the air see he's come forth now to claim his possession that's right that's why we're not looking for another age we're not looking for another messenger we understand where we're living at he's come forth to claim his Poss prise the Lord now where was John when he saw the coming Lord Revelations 1:10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day not in man's day the Lord's Day amen Prophet said see John was transmitted from the aisle of patmas in the spirit over into the Lord's day amen see the Lord's Day the day of his coming his judgment that'll be the Lord's day ain't that right so there he was watching the coming of the Lord in the Lord's Day Prophet says that he was actually God was showing John the rehearsal of his coming now now I have to tell you and we could go we'll go more into it as as we go by God's grace but if you studied the message you know that he was caught up in our day this day can you say Amen John 2,000 years ago or so was sitting there because the enemy had banished him but God remembered him and while he was sitting on that island he said I just got in the spirit and got caught up over into this day the Lord's dayl John saw what you saw amen what did he see then he saw saw Christ as judge can't have judgment without a judge can you say amen and it can't be a righteous judgment without a righteous judge amen so Revelations 1:13 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with the Garment down to the foot and the Girt and GT about the paps with a golden girdle now brother Brandon describes all this to show that that's not the priest he's not in his priesthood he's as a judge by the way John describes him being dressed his head and his hair were like white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as flame of fire ain't that right so so the prophet said see his hairs were like white as wool show knowing that he is Judge Supreme Judge John shows he says that he wasn't in the day of his prophecy as a prophet neither was he Plum out in the days of his kingship but he was in the day of the Lord as a judge aren't you glad for that now this fits with John 5 and22 for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son there also the Bible tells us in Acts 1731 that he God hath appointed a day see in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man Jesus Christ see whom he hath ordained where of Heath given Assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead amen second Timothy 4:1 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom see so he becomes judge in the day of the Lord now I'm getting ready to close but Daniel 17:13 and I saw in the night because here's now that Daniel writing of the same thing that John saw I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the Clouds Of Heaven you know it's amazing how one man just doesn't write all events about it but God will take different men different prophets throughout the Bible and and they see different things about the same thing so he says one like the son of man came with the Clouds Of Heaven well John didn't say that he came with the CL Clouds Of Heaven but here he is saying it I saw him come with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him and there was given him Dominion he didn't come to be sped upon he didn't come to be ridiculed he didn't come all the there was given Dominion glory and a kingdom that all people Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed the 18th verse now the Saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom even forever and ever amen what is it it's the day of the Lord not man's day the day of the Lord ain't that right now notice see in the ninth verse Daniel describes him now this Ancient of Days the son of man the prophet said came to the Ancient of Days and now watch I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head was like pure wo amen see seeing the same thing that John saw his head was white hairs was white as wool ain't that right go to the 10th verse and a fiery stream notice at this happening a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousands thousands ministered unto him and tens uh uh 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open what was it the day of the Lord a time of trouble can you say Amen so he came he came with a cloud his hair white as wool now notice John or Jesus for told of this same coming Luke 21:25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moons and the Stars upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's heart failing them for fear looking for things after those things and looking after those things which are coming upon the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then they shall see the son of man coming with a cloud with power and great Glory can you say amen and then notice what he says after that when you these things begin to come to pass look up lift up your head your Redemption draweth nigh why because this coming the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory is the very thing that John saw as the mighty angel coming with an open book and John says he brother brandom says he comes for Redemption claims it's Rapture time amen can you say Amen can you pull up that cloud I was going to have you two uh ask you earlier forgot so notice six is manday seven seven is redemption lift up your head your Redemption draweth nigh if you can understand we changed the corner here hello brother Brown said the days are f finished now he's coming to claim what he has redeemed talking about the the seals being open the book amen the lamb coming forth to take the book see when the lamb come forth to claim his Redemption what he had redeemed time was finished then no wonder the trouble is happening in the world today time is finished time for politics is over time for government is over time for civilization as we know it is over time of corruption time of sin time of sickness and disease it's hold there Redemption your Redemption draw with nigh can you say Amen now I I read this next quote and and uh I've never saw it before i' I've heard the message but heard him preach it but never it never stuck out like it did last night but brother Ram said see he left the father Throne to take his own Throne amen prise the Lord he now has come forth from his intercessory work to claim his own Throne his redeemed subjects his own Throne his redeemed subjects that's righten he's been able to have dominion in you amen he's got you to a place that he's able to have preeminence in you now he comes to claim you he's been able to work his will in you he's been able to do everything that he's wanted upon the Earth through you you are his victory that's good brother BR said Christ died for this purpose we're not sitting here arguing with his word we're not sitting here charging with his will that's right we become his throne now he comes to claim claim his redeemed subjects now as we get ready to close brother brah said you see the picture the other day talking about that picture there how he turned it remember now we didn't have I think it's on time that's Time Magazine that's not the way it shows in Time Magazine actually or Life Magazine the the Earth is actually if if you saw it all I think it's on this side of of what I'm looking at so I guess it'd be on this side uh the Earth is like this because it should be like that and so brother br's talking about said you see the picture of the day how he turned that picture now I think I've mentioned it before but brother Ed Hunter he was in I think it was the rising of the Sun that that service I'm I'm pretty sure that's that's the one but they this uh Life Magazine had just come out with this picture so everybody was before service they were all looking at the picture and they were just oh wow that is so cool you know all this stuff he said never one time that it Dawn on them to turn the picture not one time so they were wondering what does these men mean and and and so they were just oh wow this is really cool they go inside brother brandom didn't even know it and how he mentioned it how that as he's looking at the picture the angel of the Lord says turn it to your right GL and when he turned it to the right that's what it is so brother Bri says now you see the picture the other day how he turned that picture sideways there and the Very picture of those seven angels being lifted up turn it to the right hand side there is the face of the [Music] Lord hallu Jesus looking down to the Earth again he said you remember when I preached the seven Church ages I could understand why Jesus standing there with a white over his head he was a young man so see now he's looking at John and and what John writes about how he's got white his hair was white as wool Daniel talks about it and and a even a prophet at that time didn't understand it how in the world is he you know he's a young man how does he have white hair amen so he says see I took it back in the Bible and it says he came to the Ancient of Days whose hair was white as wool Jesus was only 33 and A2 years old at his crucifixion so he says I called up brother Jack Moore a theologian he said oh brother brandham that's Jesus in his glorified State stage and and said after his death bural and Resurrection he turned to that well that sounded all right for a theologian but it didn't go good see it didn't hit hit the something didn't hit right with a prophet right so I went up there and started on that first church age and there the Holy Spirit revealed it now you got it right on your church ages I guess the books will be up pretty soon the full detail of it and it showed that Jesus was Judge there is a white wig that they used to wear put on a wig on and wear it as a judge England still does it when you got supreme authority and that turning sideways in this picture that there he is amen right his black hair you can see it in the side of his beard uh uh there and the white wig on see he is the last of the authority he is supreme authority even God said so himself this is my beloved Son hear ye him there he is with them Angels amen not a Thunderhead Cloud but a cloud of angels can you say Amen see the message which was the seven breaking of them Seven Seals that revealed serpent seed and all these things here and it shows that it is his covering it's his supreme authority he is supreme and he is wigged or covered Hallelujah do you love himen amen isn't the Lord wonderful what a day we're living in amen if the musicians will come according to the scripture I believe it's in Isaiah it says the day of the Lord is a day of Darkness the day of the Lord is a day of darkness and and of course we know that to be spiritual Darkness a spiritual blindness and if you notice where we're at it ties in with that because Isaiah 60 I think it says that gross Darkness Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people in Shalom the message Shalom brother Brandon preached them twice preached that sermon twice he deals with that amen and he talks of how that the darkness has come we're living in a time where Darkness has covered the Earth gross Darkness the people he said they're wonderful people good people but they just can't see they they he said they just can't get it he shows it's it's a Darkness it's gross Darkness amen see the day of the Lord is is is is is a dark day it's a day of Darkness but yet there as the prophet Isaiah is talking of this gross Darkness falling upon the people and darkness upon the Earth what does he start out with arise Shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee can you say [Music] amen I think that's powerful and in that message Shalom as he's talking about the darkness and the gross darkness and all these things notice he says it's just before [Music] day the morning and he's talking about the Pres present time where we're at the morning star has come out to hail the day coming and the Holy Spirit showing its light it's coming a time when the light and darkness will have to be separated yes amen one from the other church and its order will take the order of the day and Christ and his light work promise will go in the Rapture that's the only thing that's left for them to do it's a day today is the dawn of a new day for many who are looking for his coming oh my church we're in that day of the Lord it's a new day for us it's a dawning of a new day it's not Darkness to us it's light to us and it's come to take us home oh aren't you glad for that church can you just Worship the Lord and love him my my my he's not left us alone he's not forgotten about us the world passing laws against us they're they're doing everything else to get rid of

Hallelujah that he's with us amen and I uh I'm just so glad for that glory to God if uh you can be seated I've asked sister uh Kim weeks to come and take 10 minutes and uh her and brother John had uh delivered uh some the things that we had uh got money for that you you given for to help with the hurricane relief and so uh yes yeah yeah you can pass them out they've taken some pictures we had tried to get it up on the screen but they were too small and so um they they give some pictures there but um anyway God bless y'all um we were privileged to go uh be the hands and feet for you uh North Carolina you know is my hometown and uh where most of the devastation happened was I live in the Foothills and the mountains are stomping grounds right there and um so it's been near and dear to my heart to go and uh I cried a lot when it first happened and uh John and all of his wisdom told me to quit crying and do something about it so um but we went uh the day after Thanksgiving and uh all the videos doeses not prepare you that you can watch all the news doesn't prepare you for what you're going to see it's uh uh it's devastating still uh but the the mountain people are strong people and and they will get through it somehow in all of this and uh it feels like the government is trying to cover it up and uh I don't know if you've been paying attention but I pay pay a lot of attention and it just seems to there's no money for them we can send billions overseas but there's no money to help the people so whether you're giv 20 or a thousand they they need they need what what's coming um so um I'd like to tell you right quick we had some money from our our car club and uh they had trusted us to take and and and give it away and so I just ask God to to guide us you know you guide us where you need this money to go and uh uh all the stories are here you're going to hear stuff maybe that's a little fabricated but um it's real uh it has happened and um so right when we we we went to uh where our contact was and you have to have a contact if you're going up in there and uh the contact was in a volunteer Camp these volunteers are coming from Texas and uh Alabama and from all over the United States just to help you know it's just amazing and and in this volunteer Camp there are campers but there's also tents and most of the tent uh people that are living in the tents are volunteers because they have no place to go they have uh maybe they um their home was destroyed or they rented and uh so they have stayed there to get a so that they can get fed but also they're sending them out to help people clean up and and and stuff and but right when we got there there was an emergency uh volunteers were running for their vehicles to they had received a phone call that a young family a father and mother and three littles were in a tent and it was cold up there it was blowing snow it was windy three littles were in a tent the two youngest would not stop crying no matter how hard they tried what they were doing the children would not quit you know and it scared them because they thought you know they've lost lives up there because because of the cold so they were running to get them and put them in a hotel and we were able uh because of our car club to put envelope in their hands to to help um but U just absolute dire needs they have nothing and uh so um we were also sent to a family and you may have heard the story but um uh uh Grandpa and Grandma went to church on Wednesday night and their son daughter-in-law and three daughters also at church well the three daughters wanted to go home with their grandparents and they let them go and uh the next day was the flood and uh them girls lost they lost mom and dad and they lost their home and they lost everything the girls are 8 years old 12 years old and 16 and uh staying in a two bedroom trailer with Grandma and Grandpa they found the dad in Tennessee the body um mom's never been found and uh this is real I mean this we went to the family's home and uh um spoke with them and just wonderful people they love the Lord they don't know what we know but they love the Lord you'll see a picture of them if it comes around and the Grandpa's 66 he just retired um and is uh going to raise three children three girls um in that home uh but uh we were able to help them and it just did my heart good you know uh I lost my mom when I was a little girl I know what it's like and uh to to imagine those little girls have lost both at one time and and um so so many so many needs what you're hearing is not embellished it is not uh it's real these people are are in serious trouble uh all the flood victims just not just North Carolina but Tennessee and Georgia also um only like 3% had flood insurance and for the most part insurance companies would not sell them flood insurance because it didn't seem to be a risk but um we passed homes that from the front look like I thought you know why didn't the water touch them but coming back down the whole back of that house was gone you were looking at a facade to the front of that house brother wheel the back was completely I mean it was gone there was nothing to it but um even like the rolloffs are um it'll take your heart it'll it'll tear you up because it's somebody's life there there was one uh I just happened to glance was we was going by and there were photos ruined you know frames of photo albums a little bear child's bear um it'll change you I cared already but it'll change your whole outlook to go to these places if any one of us you know home should be our sanctuary and if anyone of of us went home today and our house had went up in a fire or or something we could only begin to imagine what What U these people are having to go through but um they they uh they still want you to go to the next house because they might need you worse right they're they're like well you know we're okay why don't you go help this one and and I love that about mountain people as a mountain people thing right there I think but um Bible F Tabernacle you uh this little Sanctuary I don't know exactly how much they gave but um I think Britney Told Me Maybe This was the second load right Britney or the third some second and uh we delivered um a buddy heater uh there was a a small like uh battery operated saw uh wet and dry vacuums um heavy duty trash bag just like a huge box of of those and U uh brooms shop brooms um hammers household brooms um to to them from you you we uh loaded up the truck and and uh I was thrilled I th I was thrilled as as they were unloading it and I was just thinking about my church family and and Lord just bless my church family uh for for a giv of what they had to to try to help and uh uh oh uh this is just it's just near and dear to my heart y'all forgive me but um I did uh they were happy to get everything but uh I did I did hear a story sister Britney um that um kind of made me smile uh so the people like when they have a need they come into the volunteer Camp because they have uh uh trailers with with stuff you know that they can help them with and uh uh evidently some men come in to get propane and that sort of thing and the uh had some wives with them there was great enthusiasm for a it's just a br these people can't work their their their livelihoods are destroyed at the moment uh if there's if there's U plants they're they're under mud uh you know they're trying to dig out and uh so they were so excited Britney God bless you for thinking of them they were so excited to get a new broom uh and uh but you know even if it's just mud in their homes if they have their home at all uh it's tons of mud tons and and uh uh they will rebuild uh our contact is a contractor uh and he was actually just visiting in the area to he was building a home and it was destroyed and uh but he has dedicated the next year without any p trying to help these people rebuild I like that he's standing there talking and he's got a cigarette in his mouth and but there's something in his heart that cares and I like that and um so I I had asked him this morning what are the needs right now and uh he said always propane and propane tanks they they've got to get through the winter and it's cold uh but from his end of course they're trying to get them into a shelter even if it's just a tiny house they're trying to get them into a shelter and uh he said Building Supplies uh monetary gifts um and of course we have the the church you know the foreign Brothers need to save their church too so uh and I know we're just a small group but God supplies he he does he owns he owns it all anyway but um anyway it's it's it's it's a real need please don't forget them if if it's just if it's just that you're praying your heart out please don't forget these people Cu uh I just can't imagine being in their shoes and uh we will be going back uh the 21st if if the Lord puts anything on your heart we'd be glad to take it with us or you know if brother sha has a plan for maybe how we could help again but uh it was an honor to walk through that mountain for you and and uh to know that my my congregation cared enough to to do what we did and and uh uh we uh I just found out last night that you know you have all these uh conspiracy kind of people right and there are some that are claiming that this didn't happen or this this isn't as bad as they you know you you get all kind of things but um my cousin uh is married to a fine man that um works for Duke power been with him for many many years years and he was telling us that or telling my family yesterday that he had to do it twice but that uh as much as they were trying to get the power back on up there they were pulled away from their job many times to go get bodies out of trees he said you don't he said you it'll never leave me he said uh it was the hardest thing I could have worked all day on a power line that could have kill be but to go get innocent people who had no idea what was coming U they they needed buckets to to lift the people out of of the bodies out of the trees and stuff and but um and and you know God none of it surprises God you know he knew he knew but but um still as a human let's just keep them in our prayers and um uh uh you know if we if we do decide to do something U God bless you but God bless you for what you've already done because it was such an honor to to to uh be there on on the behalf of f t that a missing honey we're good that spe for do certainly appreciate everyone giving and um and what you could give and donate and appreciate um um brother John and Sister Kim for taking that down and uh brother Daniel and sister Britney taking the first load down uh to uh brother Donnie's and um they were able to distribute um what was given and so um uh we certainly don't want to forget uh the people there I I know it's going to take a take a while for them to recover and um from what I had heard that um uh some were building little kind of Shack homes or whatever in the government the Amish okay they told well yeah yeah I don't understand why they're doing that but uh we certainly appreciate all the volunteers that have been helping the people down there and we want to uh keep them in our prayer the the people and and the volunteers and um because anyone that's volunteering you know that it's it's taken from their it's it's not comfort for them either um and so I certainly appreciate uh them and uh for the work that they're doing and and we will continue to um if anyone has anything that you want to donate um uh to give uh for this cause um I know people not here that people have donated um old clothes and uh all the way down to worn underwear and uh so don't don't do that uh SE yeah we certainly uh be keeping them in our prayer and um um and as we had mentioned anyone that would like to give for that the Believers there in Pakistan um uh I know it would be a blessing to them as as well um we can stand to our feet and uh uh brother Matthew uh as I guess most of us know he's uh he's been training to be a policeman and um he's going to need a lot of prayer for that and the bad guys are going to need a lot of prayer too once he gets after him but uh no he's entering a a dangerous job and um so we want to we really want to keep him in prayer he's been um 24 weeks 21 weeks he's been in boot camp and uh uh he has described some of his training and uh I am so glad that the Lord called me to be a preacher and not a policeman and uh he's had to go up against some big guys and they were they were there to beat him up and uh he he broke his thumb and um some other guys broke some bones but he had they they had to do it for training to know what they were up against and uh so he he's been through the meal for these 21 weeks but he is graduating and uh uh the uh graduating the police academy uh this coming Thursday the 12th at uh 1:30 uh in the afternoon uh in Bristol and so he's inviting everyone that want to come and uh be a witness that um you're you're more than welcome and I'm sure he could give us some uh directions and things like that but um anyways we we just really congratulate brother Matthew and all of his hard work and and um and just ask the Lord to to be with him and and actually y'all don't mind I know we've taken a little bit of time but maybe we could just pray for brother Matthew and um the Lord would just go with him and keep him and give him the wisdom and and uh just watch over him his his friend he brought a friend that was a policeman um been a couple years ago now a year but B brought a a a young man to church just a fine young man and U but since that time uh he had been U hit by a car and um I don't think he's even able to work uh it started back but he's in a lot of pain still uh just broke bones and but he was doing his job been a policeman and the car ran over him and they hit him and and so he's just been uh so you know it's it's dangerous work but brother Matthew if you'd come and maybe the uh ministers would come and we could just lay hands y'all can just play a song [Music] and [Music] h [Music] J [Music] amen so again this Thursday 130 there in Bristo and um and also uh little Jonathan is not feeling good today seemed like sickness just uh uh going making its rounds and so uh this why sister hope and him's not here and so we want to just uh pray uh for for him today amen and um um I don't know brother Mark you want to come up and dismiss us in prayer and you can pray as well for Jonathan and Daniel had forgot to mention him nearing the request but amen I'll pray
