verse 7. Amanda says and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat amen if we could then turn over to the uh 12th verse for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment for I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for token upon the house where ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt amen can we read that one more time and the blood shall be to you for token upon the houses where ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you amen can we just bow our hearts for a moment now dear heavenly father Lord you see this little thought I I had on my heart father and Lord you see that I'm just a little nervous Lord and I asked father Lord that you would just come and make a way tonight father I pray that you would just use me in a special way to speak to your people father and Lord I pray that you would just move any Spirit that's trying to hinder the service for others Lord

Christ's name we pray amen you can be seated amen I I had just a little thought on my heart uh if I could give it a title um I would like to maybe title it the blood will never lose its power and are you thankful for the blood tonight amen so if we go and I may kind of go back and forth and you guys are just going to have to have to bear with me tonight but uh if we go back to the very beginning when God created uh the universe when God of the universe longed for Fellowship and the God who formed the mountains the God who carved the rivers who spoke light and the sun came forth he put the moon and the stars in its place yet he longed for Fellowship he longed to be able to express himself amen see he couldn't have fellowship with the angels see they were made to Give Him worship night and day they were made to sing Holy Holy are you Lord God Almighty every day and night you know the God created them to worship him but he wanted to express every attribute that was within himself he couldn't Express himself to the angels and he couldn't Express himself to anyone else inside of him was the attribute of Savior inside of him there was an attribute to be a Healer he wanted to express himself amen he couldn't Express himself to his angels they couldn't be lost his angels couldn't be lost they couldn't be sick they were Immortal beings his brother Branham says so he wouldn't display his healing power he couldn't display his salvation so what did he have to do he had to create man he had to create a man in his own image so he put a man on a free moral agency to make a choice if you take this uh you live if you take that you die and every man that comes into the world is still set with the same thing so God gave us each a a a choice uh he put within us to make decisions so every day we wake up we have to make a decision we have to decide whether we're going to get out of bed and go to work we're going to have to decide which vehicle we're going to take to work amen we have to uh uh uh some of the decisions are not easy uh my wife was actually just telling me yesterday she says decisions to cook is just so hard I don't know what to do I want to make this or I want to make that but uh so she's all the time what do you want and I said well I'm not I'm not the the queen of the kitchen I said you are you are the queen of the kitchen you can decide and and I'll just have to eat it amen so so God put uh uh the free moral agents and the human being amen so so what did God do he then created Adam and Eve amen God then tells Adam uh uh and Eve he says Thou shalt not eat of the fruit of the tree of Good and Evil you know so the decision he God told him God laid his judgment out right there on the table God told him you shall not eat of this tree but the choice was still up to them whether they did it or not you know he said if you eat of this tree you will die so so he his judgment came forth amen so when God began to fellowship with Adam and in the cool of the evenings Amen brother Branham says now man was born to have Fellowship man in the beginning back in the Garden of Eden he had wonderful Fellowship God came down fellowship with the company of men and women every evening in the quality evening God would come down under the big palm trees perhaps his uh sacred light as it was shining down on Adam and Eve and that get great cathed neutral in the open fellowship with God and nothing to worry about as long as they were fellowshipping amen see it was a perfect Fellowship between God and man amen aren't you thankful for that yeah uh you know maybe maybe Eve would then say uh uh uh uh Adam you know it's a little chilly over here you know I'm a little cool and then Adam being in perfect fellowship with God would then say uh uh wind peace be still you know he then could say you know it's okay you know I I'll just speak to the wind and maybe uh she would say Adam you know the sun is just a little bright but you know I like this view over the mountains and and then Adam would say you know don't have no fear but then he would turn around and say tree be plucked up there and be planted right here as a shade for E see it was perfect uh commune with God Amen man but then sin broke that Fellowship amen causing a separation between God and man hey man what a tragedy what I well I was just studying I I was uh putting this together and and as I was just studying the the fellowship and listening brother Brown I'm talking about the fellowship God had with Adam hey and it broke my heart that that uh when I come down to this part the part that brother Branham says that sin is what uh separated God between man it broke it broke that Fellowship so that's why you know uh there's so many denominations today in the world they are trying to find a way back to God you know so so so what do they do they they try to bring a religion they try to bring uh uh they tried to bring their works and and uh that was the same with Adam and Eve when they had eaten of that tree their eyes were open and they knew that they had sin they knew that they were naked so what did they do they took out fig leaves and made a covering brother Branham says that covering or covering means religion so just like in the church world today you know uh they see that they're wrong they see that they were born in this world of Sinners so what they're trying to do is they try to bring their denomination they're trying to bring their covering to God as a sacrifice they're trying to get God to accept the Badness but some of them seen that the Baptists don't seem to be working so they try to create this and then they try to create that you know and to bring themselves back into that relay relationship that was once back in the Eden our Garden of Eden amen Genesis 3 verse 8 says and they heard the voice talking of Adam and Eve they heard the voice of the Lord walking in the garden uh in the cool of the day the time that God would meet them for Fellowship and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord called unto Adam and said Where Art Thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid see that never happened before when God would call unto Adam Adam was always there and where when God would always come to meet Adam Adam was always there to have that relationship but when God showed up Adam was nowhere to be found see and he hid themselves he said I was afraid I was naked and I hid myself what caused them to be afraid sin sin is what broke that relationship between God and and man but God who is in rich in Mercy still long for that Fellowship aren't you thankful for that he still Longs for that fellowship and he said I will put enmity between thy seed and the Serpent's Seed in order for them to come back into that relationship with God God himself had to provide a covering so what did God do God took the blood of a lamb he took the blood of a lamb and he clothed Adam and Eve with him so Adam and Eve's religion didn't work Adam and Eve's religion I couldn't bring God in and then back together a sin was still in the way so God said I will bring you a covering and by the blood of the Lamb there will always be you will always have to come under the blood to have fellowship with me amen so he took the blood of the skin or the skin of a lamb and clothed Adam and Eve with it signifying that one day there was to come a perfect lamb to take away the sins of the world amen they had to come by gloss provided way not their provided way we have many people in the world today trying to come up with their own ideas but they have to become God's provided away and that is a blood sacrifice amen Adam and Eve came back into fellowship with God but still couldn't be that perfect Fellowship that they had once had amen because sin was still there see the blood that covered them was only a type of what was to come and Israel used to uh uh Israel used to take the red heifer and sacrifice uh her upon the Altar for the remissions of sins amen they would take the heifer and lay it on the altar and when they would uh then they would maybe take a rock so after they took this heifer they laid it on the altar and then maybe they would take a a rock or they had to take something uh sharp and they will begin to cut the after at the lamb or the or the heifer's throat and the animal and as they were cutting the throw uh as they were cutting the animal the the blood of the animal we would begin to cover them the blood would begin to pour out upon them so they had a place the lamb in a certain way that when they began to cut that uh the throat of that lamb uh or heifer the blood would cover them amen and they had to be fully covered amen the believing worship our worshiper had to be identified with his Sacrifice by the token and when the blood was placed to where he could stand under the blood the blood must be over him and that was a token that he had identified himself guilty and have proven that an innocent substance attitude to have taken his place amen God had to see the blood and for years the guilty one was just covered but that covering could not take away the desire for sin it was not a perfect offering it it was a shadow of the real thing to come so each year the man would sacrifice and each year come back because he still had the same desire to sin so every year they had to take a lamb or a heifer every year they had to come back and they would cut that Lamb's throat year after year in order to be covered but he still had that desire to sin he still had the desire to to to do the things of the world amen the life of the animal atoned for his sin but being an animal's blood that was shed and animal life that was given it could not come back upon the man God could not come to that full relationship with man because that sin was still there and he still craved those things of the world Amen because there wasn't a perfect sacrifice a perfect sacrifice hadn't come yet amen so so what they did ah see it could uh so year after year maybe little Johnny would have to come with his little lamb maybe maybe year after year maybe maybe uh his father would send Little Johnny to go out and and grab his lamb and bring it before his father and as he stood there the father would then take the knife and he would begin to cut the throat of that little lamb and as a little boy watched as he watched his little lamb who was so innocent give his life the father would begin to say shut one day we'll do this for the last time and you'll have to sacrifice your lamb no more one day there will come a perfect sacrifice hold on my son be of good cheer amen there will come a perfect sacrifice and year after year they waited amen first John 1 29. and then the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and say behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world so year after year ever since the fall of Man they become an eye they wanted they longed for that fellowship with God so ah they could only sacrifice that lamb but see it was only a covering and see we uh we who was lost in sin needed uh something greater than that animal blood we needed something greater to make us clean we needed something greater to take away the desires of the world we needed a perfect sacrifice and John says here he comes John says behold this is the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world so God being made perfect sent his son in the form of a man to be made lower than the angels to be beaten to be warned to suffer Agony on the cross to Bear our shame and reproach so that we could be made perfect through him in love so that blood of the animal could not come back upon the worshiper because there was no Power in the Blood It could only cover the worshiper so maybe we would maybe if we would take maybe this this cup and we see that it's a cup but then as we place something over it see that blood could only cover the cup this rack could only cover the cup but see you know it's a cup you still see it there so see that's that the blood could only cover the sin the sin would never go away that sin was still there so we needed a perfect sacrifice to take away the sin and the desires that when God sees the blood he sees a perfect sacrifice he don't see the sin no more amen are you thankful for that brother Branham says if it had come back talking of the animal our blood it would still not have availed but when Christ the perfect substitute was given and his blood was shed then the life that was in Christ came back upon the repentant sinner that the life being the perfect life of Christ sinless and righteous then the guilty one could go free for he had no desire to sin The Life of Christ had to come back upon Him amen that's what it means in Romans 8 and 2 the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death amen has made us free amen how how can we have life how can we have life if the dead things of the world are still in US you can't you can't have the The Life of Christ in you with the dead things of the world in you you know how can light have fellowship with Darkness it can't happen so there had to come a perfect sacrifice there had become something to to take away the desires you can't be born again and still crave the things of the world it won't work it won't so what did he have to do God had to take you through justification by faith Sanctified through his shed blood and then he gave you the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is Christ Living in you amen Christ didn't come just to cover our sins Christ didn't come just to to uh try and just uh well I'll just cover you but you just go on as you were but no he he longed for a fellowship he longed to fellowship with you he longed to have fellowship with me and the only way to do that he had to come God himself had to come in the form of a man and sacrifice himself amen he says Christ didn't come just to cover our sins but he said I have come that you may have life because I live you shall live also amen the blood shall be to you hey man as a token amen are you thankful for that amen because I live you shall live also amen what is a token it's a sign that the price has been paid amen a token ah to board a plane would be a ticket so so if you were to go five plane or uh ride in a plane then you had to purchase a ticket before they let you on you couldn't just go up to that pilot and said here here's fifty dollars or here here here's a hundred dollars that pilot would say no you have to go you have to go and make a purchase of your ticket amen and to board that plane and brother Branham says then the blood was a token or an identification the blood identified the worshiper uh had slain the lamb and accepted the lamb and applied the token to himself that he was not ashamed amen and of God didn't see the blood upon the worshiper he couldn't recognize his sacrifice so if we refer back to the cup if we if we take that if we take this and we hide it again if we if we only covered it up yeah God seen God sees the uh he covered the Lamb's blood covered it up but see God's still seen that God still sees the sin but but if you take away the blood God couldn't God couldn't uh God couldn't the atone for the I'll get it out the atone uh the the Lamb's blood could not atone for that worshiper because he hadn't applied the blood so what did he have to do he had to go get the lamb he had to go get the lamb and he had to come and he had to sacrifice and order for that blood to come upon him but see if God didn't see that blood if if this rag was not on this cup I mean you see the cup now and but see God could not their sins couldn't be forgiven God God couldn't look as them as clean amen he remained Unforgiven there had to come a lamb there had to come a death amen just like today there has to come a death if you're going to get the token hey man you have to surrender yourself you have to prepare yourself for God to receive uh to give you the Holy Ghost amen the believer had to be covered in thou Lamb's blood the believer had to be identified with his sacrifice as a token that he uh had done what God Said do amen we we look at Cain and Abel you see uh Cain had brought a sacrifice but see he came brought his fruits the fruits of his labor he brought in the uh Bocce God wouldn't accept that but see Abra or Abel had a revelation from God that it took a blood sacrifice it took a blood sacrifice to be free and you know of course you know the story King gets jealous and he smites Abel uh uh but just like the church world today they're trying to bring God the fruits of their labor amen Matthew 7 22 says many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have we not cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from ye that work iniquity see Cain was religious Cain was a religious person but he didn't come with the right sacrifice there are many religious people out there in the world today but only there's only one person there's only one Church there's only one bride who has received the Revelation that you have to come under the perfect sacrifice of the Lamb of God Amen uh Christ didn't shed his own blood for us to still crave the things of the world when when his blood was shed it took every desire I once had every craving I once had and it did it away hey man Psalms 103 verse 12 says as far as the East is from the West so far he's even remove my transgressions from me he doesn't remember them he doesn't remember your sins [Applause] brother Branham says you're standing completely you never sin at the first place God didn't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness brother Bill you never did it in the first place you are accused of it by the Accuser oh yeah Satan accuses you every day of it but God don't remember brother Branham says but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God Amen God don't remember it amen a greater sacrifice has come in this day they didn't have that back then it could only cover God could still see the sin but in this day God don't see it no more in this day you're free amen from the guilt of sin now Satan may try to condemn you and he does every single day every single day Satan comes to me and tries to remind me of my sin he may try to torment your flesh he may try to remind you of this he may try to remind you of something you did years and years ago and but as long as you're under the blood that's where God drew the line Satan can't cross that bloodline it's become our Shield the blood is our Shield amen so you take the cap hey man you take that cat and you pick up a cat that's that's wandering around in your house and you throw it outside so you're doing your work and and you're going on and on and and then all of a sudden you you hear him hear meow you hear something scratching you're like oh my goodness where's that cat so you're looking around all over the place but the cat is still outside he's just scratching out the door to get in and that's what Satan's trying to do to us every single day the blood has kicked Satan out of our lives he's just trying to tell you a little scratch scratch here hey hey you remember what you did years ago you remember what you did years ago brother Bill see it's just Satan just scratching out the door trying to get in and as long as you keep that door closed as long as you keep the blood applied Satan can't come in he can only come in if you let him he can only have his way in you if you let him hey man that's what the blood does for us the blood has come to set us free the blood has come to make a way that you condemnation has no hold on you amen you threw the cat outside what are you worried about amen so you say well you know I did this I I did that don't think about that you're only trying to remain remind god of what you've done but see God don't remember him he's looking at you going wow well I gave you my blood well what are you talking about I don't remember you doing that I don't remember that sin that you did years ago I don't remember your drinking habits I don't remember your smoking habits come on are you listening amen sometimes we become guilty of that all satan will put in condemnation on us and then we'll go we'll just start crying we'll do the Lord we'll just start begging God please forgive me God I'm so sorry yeah we fall every day but I'm talking about Sin see a True Believer can't sin you're crying out to God forgive me God is just looking at you he says what in the word are you talking about what are you doing crying for I don't remember and if you did apparently I've forgiven you of it amen it's been put in the sea of forgetfulness amen the sign that says no fishing amen you ain't gonna catch nothing amen amen he that is born of God cannot sin amen First John 3 9 says whoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed God's seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God Amen I just love that scripture whoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God Amen brother Branham says you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with that pure on a dry unadulterated bride word that heat Washed by the Water of his own blood and he be and that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was so you're the same as he was he that is born of God cannot sin when he has filled you with the Holy Ghost and giving you that token you have become identified with him now you can stand holy as he is Holy you can stand Guiltless as he is Guiltless amen we have become one with God Amen now you can come boldly Before the Throne of God you're you were made you were made sinless as he is sinless you're made holy as he is Holy so now you can come boldly Before the Throne of God ask what you will and shall be given to you ask what you will what are you scared of Satan is just scratching out the door every promise in the book is yours every promise of God is at your disposal you now have access to every word of God because you're free because there's no sin we remember the sins as humans and it's and trust me it is aggravating I wish we could I wish we could go ah I wish we could never remember some of the things we used to do but see it's there so Satan can remind you sure but you got to know who you are you got to know where you stand you need healing you need Deliverance get under the blood you need a loved Allah a lost loved one saved get under the blood you need the Holy Ghost get under the blood whatever you have need of it's yours every promise in the book is yours you've got a belief for it you've got to believe for it amen Egypt has been in slavery for many years day after day beaten being torn apart being a slave to sin then one day there came a message there came a call a message calling them to come out Moses says hey you don't have to suffer no more you don't have to take the beating anymore you don't have to take the uh you don't have to be a slave to your sin no more you don't have to be a slave to your Taskmaster no more come out of her and I'll take you to a new land you know you see this land is Flowing with milk and honey this land has everything you have need of and whoever took heeda to that call was saved and it's the same today there came a message from God through the through the prophet through the voice of brother Branham there came a message calling us to come out amen come out of what come out of the formal ideas come out of that sin come out of laodicea come there's a new land I'll take you to God says there's a new land I'll take you to this land is Flowing with milk and honey you see you see this land is where the lion lays down with the lamb then this lamb the the lame leaps for joy in this land there are sickness and disease can't enter there for this land is pure This Land Is Holy and all who take heed this message shall be saved amen so death getting ready to strike Egypt at night and all those who had the token would be saved and it's the same today God getting ready to strike the land getting ready to strike this Earth and only those who have the token will be saved what is the token for us today it's Jesus Christ and what is Christ it's the word and what is the word for us today it's the message of the hour under the message amen so that's what the trouble is with our schools today they've taken the token out they've taken Christ out of our schools so shootings take place all the time you you read the news I I don't get on I hate the news it's too depressing my wife lets me know it keeps me updated with everything in the world because I have no idea and uh and uh so that's what's happened with her schools today that's why there's so many shootings in the world that's that's that's why there's so many uh here years ago I actually remember um uh this big shooting that happened here at Virginia Tech I remember uh we was I'm almost thinking he's at brother Roy's or we were somewheres uh near uh are not way somewhere we was at a hotel and dad was getting ready to preach somewheres and we actually seen it on the news that a shooting had taken place um here in Tech and I don't know if it was that same year or if it was like the next year but I know it was like it wasn't really far apart but I know they were talking about it on the news and then but that but that's what that's what's happening in the world today is they've taken Christ out of the schools they said well because you used to they used to pray before they started school and you know us being homeschooled mom would always pray with us every morning we'd always do our devotions every morning before we start school brother Branham teaches us that and so they would always they would always uh pray before but then somewhere somewhere uh someone didn't like that idea so they kicked God out of their schools and then someone comes in possessed by the devil and shoots a bunch of people up and then they go where where is God God this world is crazy they kick them out and then they want him back in the students are now identifying as cats and dogs I don't understand I mean blessed God bless brother Branson who has to teach them students I just I I don't know God that's why God didn't put me there because he knows I wouldn't be able to handle it I mean them kids identifying as dogs and cats and using the potty right I mean not even in the stall they've got a little special place for them and that's where they go I mean that is that is wacky I mean and that's a nice word for it insane brother Terry amen ungodly teachings are now coming in the school I teaching they're trying to teach your kids that you can be whatever you want to be I mean I don't know how they can even justify that I mean you take the command the the everything that a man and a woman is help us see it's a man and a woman I'm honest what God and that's what it's become Satan's trying to take God Satan's trying to take the token off our job sites that even the job site has to be that has become such an ungodly place I mean me and brother Junior we have to work every once in a while thank God sometimes it's just me and Junior and and working on a house and and we get to turn on our own music we get to uh turn on a tape we get to do we get to do whatever we want and uh but when we get around the Knuckleheads man they will beat us to the radio and they will play the wackiest music you've ever heard of I mean they come from Floyd so it's a bunch of hippie musics mixed with Spanish music mixed with American music and everybody else's music and it becomes wacky I mean it is so ungodly and but that's what our job sites have become ah they become ungodly they can live any old way and here me and bro junior is trying to be a light we're trying to shine our light but if we just become we become so sick we become so tired of of having to listen to that music and and having to be around them because they're they they cuss constantly and just no God godliness about him he's actually in a job uh yesterday and uh we was there uh me and Junior was putting some stuff together and one of our electricians walks in and uh the owners of the uh the barn had a picture of Jesus a land or hanging on the window this guy walks in looks at that geez this picture laughs at it and says it looks like that he did whatever with his mother and I was I turned around and I was in my heart I said God you gotta forgive that man that was just such an ungodly thing to say I I just don't know where if God don't touch that man he God bless his soul see and now uh the world that Satan has become our uh well this is Satan's Eden I mean this is Satan's World they've kicked God out America gave up God a long time ago and now see see Satan has preeminence over the world he has preeminence over our job sites he has Brandon's in everything we we do outside of our family outside of our church in worldly things Satan has the dominion over them so see what now what Satan does now that he's got all that Satan is now trying to come in our homes come on are you listening now Satan is trying to come in our home he's trying to get the people to take the token out of their homes anymore a good television is better than that uh they're more important than the things of God that's how the world sees it people today are good television show wow well you know that's why brother Brandon blasted it he said Satan snuck a good one on us when he brought in television and he says some would stay home from church to watch television amen now now a lot of people now they will go to church yeah they they were there but soon as they get out of church they're going to go home and they turn on the television but see it's an ungodly thing and see Satan snuck a good one on us when he brought that in and anymore good television is more important than the things of God wives not knowing how to raise their children not knowing how to serve their husbands so what do they do they they their their children become a nuisance so what do they do they give them the iPad they give them the movies they give them the video games to entertain them because they're just driving me crazy my mind's about to go oh my see Satan working in there Satan's trying to have his way in our homes amen instead of taking care of the kids they leave him with a babysitter and then they go work off for eight hours a day and come home and then go to bed because their kids are in bed so they go to bed wake up and their kids are still in bed and they go to school the only times they get to see them is on the weekends man what an ungodly thing to do this bins today are forgetting how to leave their homes they're forgetting how the lead family the way the word teaches anyone can lead a family anyone can provide for a family but which it's when you uh the husband has to come under the authority of the word that's what it has to be anyone can do that but can they lead they're they're their their their family under the token too busy trying to become rich too busy trying to make their dreams come true kids too busy indulging in the things of the world too busy with the movies too busy with the video games that they have no desire for the things of God my two kids nowadays the teenagers today are are too focused on having a boyfriend too focused on having a girlfriend that if that don't work out for them oh yeah they came in I've seen it I I watched it we had someone come in and they were in the world and God delivered him God delivered him from the smoking God delivered him but then he started liking a girl and the girl says well I don't have nothing to do with you I I'm not interested that man was so devastated that he went back into the world his mom was like Michael uh what's going on well what's happening and he goes he goes why aren't you come why aren't you coming to church he goes mom I have no desire for the things of God see they let one thing come in the way and that's what they left their focus on Ma you got to get under the token yeah yeah God can still deliver but you gotta stay longer you've got to get the Holy Ghost hey man without the Holy Ghost it's not gonna work amen I am trying to hurry here I see that the time is ticking down so just because the school are the children and they're becoming so much indulgent in the things of the world that they can't be reached and then the parents are like where's the power of God where is it it's because you get the token out of the homes my just because you say you're a message believer don't mean you're saved turning on a tape once a month don't mean you're safe amen you want to see Revive on your home we've got to get under the token if we want to see a change in our kids if we want to see a change in our wives our husbands we have to get under the token we have to apply the token for our family we have the authority if if we're under the shed blood of Jesus Christ if Christ has given you the Holy Ghost then you have the authority to claim for your kids it's a promise it's a promise y'all know the story of my grandma my mom was sitting there listening to a message and I'm just going to cut this uh really short the story but that's totally here before but she was sitting there under a message and she said she was telling Dad she says that our Sean she said I don't know what happened but she says I heard myself say I send the Holy Ghost after my family and I I'm just a matter of days her mom gives her heart to the Lord I'm telling you it's still real the blood still has power amen but see Satan didn't stop there Satan's trying to get in our churches amen there's no church Order anymore the song leader the musicians living the old way they want preachers don't want to take time to study anymore churches are trying to bring in the donuts trying to bring in the entertainment to bring the people instead are trying to bring the people in to church instead of getting them to the token preachers trying to preach their own interpretations I was on the phone with brother Andrew wow yeah yesterday and we was just our day before Sunday and we was talking and I just told Brother Andrew I don't understand preachers call themselves message Believers and yet they're trying to and they're trying to bring their own interpretation to the word of God I'm I don't you know I mean the they've got to do what they got to do you know I guess but amen so so Satan's trying to bring uh trying to get our churches trying to get the pastor to kick out the token is what he's trying to do amen the preacher's trying to preach their own interpretations preachers and pastors being scared their church is being scared to identify themselves with the message so they're taking down the pillar of fire they're taking down the cloud all because they're scared to be identified with this message scared to lose their congregation scared to think what what the world thinks about them my in order for the blood to work for you you must be identified by the blood in order for the message to work for you and your family you have to come under the message you have to be willing to be identified with the message amen you must have to want to be identified with a message don't Nick pit the prophet don't Nick bam man Nick pick this what he says about this and what he says about that see my little child does that at home my little child my mom or my wife will come in and she'll cook us a big meal and she'll try to feed my little baby she'll try to feed Autumn something and Autumn is just pushing this way pushing that away she did nitpicking picky and being all of that and and then I ask I asked my wife I said why is she not hungry I said if she had snacks yeah well that's why that's why she don't want it if she's not hungry enough to want it she because she replaced his desire was something else amen you understand what I'm saying and it's the same with the people today see see no matter if you try to give my daughter something that she really likes she really likes rice and beans and when he's trying to feed her rice and beans last night and she wouldn't take it she came no no I don't want it and then I asked my wife she'd been snacking yes yeah well that's why she's already full and it's the same with people today man Brother Sam talking about it today people don't want to come to church no more churches just become oh well it's just a thing well and you know if I get time I'll go we'll see they're already full they're feeling those desires for God for something else maybe they're listening to this preacher T.D Jakes maybe they're listening to that or maybe they're listening to Benny Hinn see then they try to bring their ideas in but see it won't work you're nitpicking the message because you already uh been full you've already been feasting on something else you've got to become clean you've got to become empty for God to fill you amen it just tells me they're they're not hungry it just tells me they don't want it enough somewhere along the line they've been eating on what this other person said or what that other preacher preached instead of feasting on the word on what God sent for us in this day now see when you become hungry enough you you won't care if that barbecue gets all over your face you won't care about wearing the mashed potatoes a little bit because you be you were empty you were starving I tell my wife about when is supper gonna be ready I'm starving and she says well it's almost ready so so when she places that food man I can eat away I don't care about the barbecue sauce I don't care about what what that person thinks of me about what that person thinks of me all I know is this is good food and I'm going to indulge in it hey man you've got to be identified sometimes we have to wear our food to be identified with it it just happens amen and it's the same thing with the word of God you won't become hungry enough uh or you'll become hungry enough you won't care what this person says or what that person says when you're hungry enough you're just going to indulge in everything that God has for you oh you don't care if they have the idea lines up with what you believe you're gonna indulge in it you're gonna say thank you Lord thank you for that message amen amen you have to be identified with every word of God identified with every word of God so God told Israel to take the Lamb's blood and apply it on the door for when I see the blood I will pass over you can you imagine if Israel had killed the lamb taken the blood and they put that blood in a jar and said well I killed the lamb like he told me to but I'll just put the blood over here because I'm not sure what my neighbors will think about it well I'll put the blood in a jar because I'm not sure what this person said will think about it see they're scared scared to be identified come on are you listening now scared amen you have to be identified you have to be identified with everything God's God gives you amen me spitting all over this is messing my iPad up so God told Israel to take the blood well I killed the lamb like he said well I'm not sure what my pastor will say well I'm not sure I'm not sure about this over here or that person over there you see it might make me shout a little bit what's you it might make me cry a little bit well I don't know I don't well is it really for this day is is that is the can you imagine God telling them to to kill the blood and apply it and your family will be saved can you imagine them going up to God and says God is that for us I mean you're talking about that's for us today I mean I just I just don't know come on now brother Brandon says and then when you take a person that doesn't believe that the Holy Ghost is for the day see what they're doing they are denying the token which is the very symbol of you being connected with your sacrifice see how high the token will work for you if you keep questioning it how can the token work for you if you keep questioning the token well I just I just don't know I just my sin is just too great I don't know just take God at his word if he says do it then you better do it take every promise and apply to your life apply it to your family come on now so Israel couldn't take the blood and sprinkle here or he couldn't just dab it over here God had to see the blood if he wanted to keep the death angel out of his home he had to make it visible on his door God had to see it everybody had to see it and it's the same today you can't just well I'm gonna take this idea well I'm gonna take that idea no no you got to be identified this blood has to be visible to everybody it don't care who sees it come on now God has to see the blood I know that's the only part that matters that God has to see the blood but sometimes your neighbor's gonna see it sometimes your church family is going to see him Hallelujah you could say God whatever it takes whatever it takes God I want the power to be over my family God whatever it takes I want that power of the blood to cover me I wanted to cover my home I want to be so lost in it Lord that all you see is the blood it don't matter who sees it God as long as you see it that's all that matters I wanted to cover my church friends I wanted to cover my church family my church my pastor Let It cover me Lord because without thou token it's impossible to come into that perfect fellowship with God without the token you're lost and when the believer began to take the blood and cover his door the eldest child could rest in peace because he knew that if the blood was applied over the door like God said it was it would be enough that boy said that blood would be enough as long as it's over the door that's enough for me that's good enough for me lift our death angel come the promise had become stronger than the death angel just like the bride today when you begin to put God's word into action when you begin to proclaim the message over your home you can watch the blood carry you through every trial you can watch the blood become stronger than your sickness come on I'm talking about the blood you go from gossiping to testifying of God come on you'll go from listening and singing to worldly music and singing oh the blood of Jesus you go from watching the movies the dirty movies into listening to the message I'm telling you it happens it will change your life forever it'll turn you from a sinner to a saint brother Bill is a witness to that I'm a witness to that that's what the blood can do that's what the blood has the power to do it'll keep you in your lowest time sister Jane when you feel like giving up and you can't seem to press on it'll be there to carry you it'll turn your sadness into Joy it doesn't mean that he'll keep the mountains away it doesn't mean that he'll keep the valleys away he's not going to keep the Giants away from you but he has promised to bring you through them he promised that you will have Victory if God before me who can stand against me if I am covered by the blood who can stand against me Revelations 12 11 says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony they overcame them by the blood of the Lamb God has put confidence into you that you not might will overcome but you will overcome he's going to defeat Satan through you amen we've already read the back of the book and we've won you can't sell you can't fall sure the struggles sure we struggle sure he sees the failures but it's not how many times we fall it's about how many times we'll get up sure we're gonna fall we fall every single day but you gotta get up you gotta keep pressing the battle you've got to keep fighting for the blood will never lose its power as long as you have the blood you are victorious Satan will bring up your past but you'll have to remind him of his future you read the back of the book and we've won hey man and as long as you're under the token sin has no hold on you depression has no hold on you complexes has no hold on you as long as you're under the shed blood of Christ you remain Victorious but if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised Christ from the dead shall Quicken what is that word Quicken mean make alive it shall make alive your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you and then you can speak to your storm you can speak to the storm and watch it disappear the same light God stood on the boat and said peace be still and if that same life that is quick in your moral body you can speak to your storm you can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's a promise to you hey man you can speak the word and watch your family come back together I'm telling you you can you can it's a promise you're gonna overcome you're gonna make it that's the power of the blood today that's what the message has done for us today it's come to set us free it's come to get us ready to to to go for a Rapture it's ready to are gonna make us ready for a new land this message this Blood it's restored us back to the full relationship that Adam once had in the garden what the perfect blood has done for us and we stand sinless in the eyes of God if the musicians will come his blood has restored us back to that relationship we can have perfect relationship with God Adam couldn't Adam could sit there and and speak he could calm the wind he can come Adam himself could what about us today what about us today A lot of times we just well I just don't know if the blood is powerful I just I just don't know no I'm telling you I'm telling you you can speak to your storm Tony you could say peace be still and you can watch it obey oh that's the power of the blood that's the power of the message for us today it's restored us back to that relationship it's taken away all the sin [Music] in a world where there's so much darkness and evil prevailing God took a pride and this layout of cnh without spot and wrinkle and made you his own you say well How can there be no spot or blemishes on his bride in a world of hate in a world of confusion and disunity how can it be all because of the power of the blood of Jesus Christ all because he gave us the token the message of the hour to prove that he is the same yesterday today and forever the power of the blood he took a bride out of this dark and sinful world I mean I don't see how the world can become more sinful I don't see how it can become more just broken yeah God has called a people without blemish without spot without wrinkle here you are tonight oh you could have been in The Honky Tonks tonight you could have been partying Brother Sam would have been having your way like you did years ago The God Who was rich in Mercy says I want them for my own I want them as my child I want to express myself to him I want to express myself to sister Bethany how do I express myself to brother shamaya so we give you the token give you the token that you can be free brother Branham says I've often wondered what to do if I had a few drops that little blood of Jesus in a charger and cut it back and could put it back in my hand I thought how would I hold it how would I cherish it with my own life not just spoil or destroy it in any way but do you know in his side I have a greater than the blood of the Lord Jesus in my care tonight and that's the purchase of his blood and then he turns around and says [Music] you are the purchase of his blood [Music] he gave his blood that you could be free that you could be his and therefore he would cherish you more than he does his own life [Music] cherish you more than he does his own blood is because he gave his life [Music] that's the power of his blood oh my so when you're covered you don't have to be scared about missing the rapture when you're covered you don't have to worry about tomorrow you don't have to worry about your children you don't have to worry about your husband or your wife whatever you have need of right now the blood still has power [Music] to meet your need aren't you thankful for that the blood still has power to save brother Matthew [Music] and
