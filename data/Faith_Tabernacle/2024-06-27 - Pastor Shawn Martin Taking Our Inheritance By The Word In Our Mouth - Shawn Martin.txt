here this evening based upon your promise that where two or three are gathered in your name you would be here and father we have come under expectation knowing Lord that you'd meet with us and father we're just inviting you to do your work work a supernatural work within every one of us father you alone know the needs tonight and you know the things father whether it be sickness discouragement whether it be just situations Lord that they're facing that need answers Lord need you to come on the scene we pray that you would do it tonight father anoint the lips of clay Lord and help me just to get myself out of the way and may you speak to your people we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord now the Book of Joshua the 14th chapter and we're going to read the um seventh uh start at the seventh verse this is Caleb speaking he says for 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh barnea to es uh spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in Mine Heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I wholly follow the Lord my God that's right and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land were on thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou Hast wholly followed the Lord my God and now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 40 and5 years even since the Lord spake with spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and 5 years old as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain wherefore the Lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anacom were there and that the city were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said amen you can have your seats this evening and also we want to remember communion uh this Sunday evening as well the Lord willing but um if I would have a title it's uh would be taking our inheritance by the word in our mouth the Lord and um I would also like to read if you wouldn't mind to ro uh turn to Romans the 10th chapter and um we're going to start at the 8th verse Romans 10 and 8 and it says but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thine heart that is the Word of Faith with which we preach that if thou con shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that the god ha raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with a heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation so here we reading the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth amen and in thine heart ain't that right that is the word of faith which we preach so here we we look at uh in in our first scripture reading um Caleb is is talking about uh his inheritance in the promised land and um Joshua is fixing to take them over into the land of promise and um uh of course we know what the land is that's that's the land of adoption Israel uh as long as they were in the wilderness they were just sojourners they they could not possess any land uh they they traveled through the land of Moab they travel to Esau's portion and different things but God told them don't even look at that that's that's not your land and so they they had an inheritance that they had to go to and so uh we know that it's the land of adoption this is what brother brandham type that land out as is the land of adoption many people think it's the uh the Millennium but he said that's not true because uh in the Land There was Wars there were conquering and fighting and and that's not to be in in the Millennium ain't that right so Ephesians 1 and5 Paul would say having predestinated us unto the adoption of sons uh by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and so it's in that land is where we possess our inheritance that has been given to us by promise ain't that right and and and it's it's to it's to the Overcomer and and um uh it's um so Caleb's inheritance was in that land and and uh God God had delivered uh the children of Israel for that purpose uh from the land of Egypt called them out to go into the inheritance uh if they refus to go in then they perish they died and that's exactly what happened uh but before he would allow them to go into the promised land uh he brought them to a place called Kadesh Baria uh which was uh uh brother said it was the Judgment seat of the world and so this this was the testing ground it was The Proving Ground uh and and and you know brother Brandon would type that out um to where uh there 1 Peter 4:17 judgment begins at the house of God and so you you think of that they had to come to a judgment they they had to make their choice they they had to uh God uh had Moses to send 12 Spies over into the land uh now you have to remember they they heard about all that land they heard what was supposed to be in the land uh God never told them about the Giants mean as far as I know uh but he did tell them that he would drive the enemy out he he would drive the inhabitants out before them uh uh but he he he gave them specific things that the of that that land held and so he sent the spies over and of of of course uh um uh 10 of the spies when they came back they had an evil uh report of unbelief uh and and and it's because they they they saw the Giants in the land and uh they saw the walled cities in the land uh uh and they and but they also saw every promise that Moses told him was going to be in the land they they partook of the the fruit they they they uh saw the milk and honey they they saw all of these things but yet they they had a a evil report of unbelief so there was only two that had a good report of faith and and so uh but God would allow that amen before they could go into that promised land and partake of the promise God would allow that the people would hear two different reports and then the people had to judge as to what was truth and and what wasn't uh now they had plenty of opportunity they they had saw the the mighty Miracles all the way through uh uh uh the journey uh God brought them out with a mighty hand and and uh but but not only just out of Egypt but even in in the wilderness he provided for them he clothed them he he fed them he he gave them water he everything they didn't need a red cross the prophet said they didn't need they had Dr Moses and and his medicine was the word of God and and so they they saw the supernatural they uh uh the pillar of fire was with the smitten Rock was with them the Brazen serpent was with them the The Mercy Seat and and all of these things but but uh uh uh uh yet God God wouldn't just allow them to go in they had to judge amen between the two reports so one report declared uh all negative about the land uh declared of uh uh dealt with the symptoms dealt with the problems dealt with the issues that the land had and and and and and and that report explained to the people as to why they couldn't overcome why they couldn't take the land why you understand and and if you've read read that that story amen they saw themselves as grasshoppers uh uh and and and so um that that that's what they got out of out of that so then there was that other report that never looked at the the Giants never looked at the issues never looked at they it just it dealt with the promise of God that we're more than able and everything that God said was would be in that land is there in the land and and and so it it reminded the people that God was the one who gave the promise ain't that right amen and and then they even brought the evidence of the land back to show that that God was right what he had said about the land but of course the people having an evil heart of unbelief amen they they uh uh believe the negative report and we know that these were the unbelievers and make Believers and and and all of these things and so they never went into the land uh that God had told them and in numbers 14:22 uh uh God would say because all those men which have seen my glory and my Miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these 10 times uh uh and have not hearkened to my voice surely they shall not see the land which where I which I swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoke me see it now now they were acquainted with the message of the hour they were they sat under a prophet's Ministry and and that Prophet was a Vindicated Ministry but all all the time when trouble come they provoke God they just kept provoking God and provoking God and and and so God was just tired of it he says he tempted me these 10 times and so God made that decree at that Kadesh Baria that final action uh uh there that they would never see the land uh they will not enter into that land but notice he said see uh uh uh the 24th verse but my servant Caleb uh because he had another spirit with him uh and hath followed me fully him will I bring into the land wherein he went and his seed shall possess it now now the prophet identified these two men Joshua and Caleb he said Joshua represented the messenger of this hour the end time leader and Caleb represented that believer that followed that in the end time believer that believed in in the message ain't that right and and so we we find that that Caleb had a different Spirit he was of another uh uh uh kind altogether he was one of the spies uh uh that went over into the land and when he come back he stood with Joshua and and and began to tell the people but God said it and and what God Said is true and here is the evidence thereof up so so Caleb could not see any negative about it all he could see was promise after promise after promise after promise and and you know there's two types of people in in in the message ranks amen they will see nothing but trouble in the message they'll see nothing but negativity in the message but then there will be those that they see nothing but promise after promise after promise after promise but see Caleb didn't follow everything that came along Dayan came on the scene and and and Drew many with him but Caleb stood with J uh with Moses uh uh Kora rose up and came on the scene and Drew many with him but Caleb stayed with the prophet of the age of that hour balam had come on the scene and and caused the people uh uh to mingle and and get into a idolatry and adultery and and it it it was just a mey but Caleb was had a different Spirit he was of a of a different kind and and and the prophet said you know the there there was only two out of the two and a half million that knew what it was all about they knew they had an understanding of what Moses's message was about they they had an understanding of what the journey was all about they had an understanding of what the pillar of fire was all about and and the smitten Rock was all about and and and all of these things and they they they weren't just just uh uh uh going blindly amen but they had an understanding that this was God taking us to the land of promise can you say amen and and so uh um Caleb yes he saw uh uh what the others saw he saw the Giants he saw the wal cities and and and yet he saw everything else and him the promises outweigh the negative amen well the the other spies saw what Caleb saw they saw amen the the the all the promises they they saw they tasted of the evidence that that Caleb had tasted of and partook of and all of that but all they could see was the negative and and and that's what they talked about and church if if we could say it this way let's not have a negative spirit amen let let's not get into a negative Spirit I'm talking about me I'm talking about you I'm talking about deacons I'm talking about preachers I'm talking about all of us here amen when the Trials come don't get into a negativity Amen to where all you see is the Giants in the land can you say Amen that that's exactly right see and and so we we find that they doubted God and they died in the wilderness and they they not only died physically but but we understand by Jesus amen words that they died spiritually they were cut off separated from God and and church this is where we're at today amen Moses had already given his message Moses had already brought him up amen under the supernatural hand of God brought them up to that Promised Land amen now it was their time Amen to make a judgment whether God was right or or or the unbelievers were right you understand what I'm saying amen and they would make that judgment based upon uh uh the the the reports amen that they've heard amen and this is what's happening today God's not going to send us another Prophet amen God's not going to send us another messenger God's not going to just send us something else to convince us if we cannot be convinced by the message of the hour and the and the supernatural that has happened in this age there will be nothing ever to convince us amen see God God's not going to do anymore it's now time for us Amen to to judge what report is Right amen did God called me to be an overcomer did God say that he would be with me amen then let's believe that amen but but or we'll look at the negativity we'll look and and judge it by our feelings we'll judge it by what we feel and what we don't feel and and all of these things and if you're not careful you'll judge God Unfaithful amen by the ne netives that is in your life can you say amen amen and I say God help us all in that amen you see uh people are dying today and they're dying spiritually people are literally amen being cut off from the life of God and you see what's amazing it's in this age that a prophet would stand and and tell us that the token God is requiring a token this is the only age that God is requiring a token and that token is a token of life life must be on display life must be manifested life can you say amen and only that believer is going to manifest the life you say well what kind of a life word life amen word life where it's showing the evidence of the land that that life is is uh uh bringing that word to life in in uh uh Our Lives ain't that right so the token of life must be on display Caleb holy follow the lord holy follow the lord now now the the others came out but they didn't wholly follow the lord every little issue that rose up they complained they murmured they they griped they griped about the way God was doing things they they griped about Moses his leadership and they griped about this and they griped about that and everything was just a oh yeah they they they were coming they they were being led up to that Promised Land but God was going to give them one final time Amen to make their judgment about the word of God can you say amen that's true see and so Caleb wholly followed the Lord you see you follow the Lord by believing his word amen you say well I follow the lord you know because I don't cut my hair you ladies and and and I wear long skirts that ain't following the Lord amen if you're not following his word if you can't believe all of the word amen then then you're not wholly following the Lord amen and I think this is where the separation is coming amen that there's going to be somebody that's going to wholly follow the lord regardless sink or swim he come hell or high water we're going to follow the lord and believe him for what he says is the truth you see it takes courage amen uh uh uh uh to possess the land amen and and we know that if you're going to believe the word the word comes through a prophet we all know that so so God's already sent us a prophet it's been Vindicated time and time again a ain't that right amen but but now now and and we know that brother branham's Ministry tied both Moses Ministry and Joshua's Ministry amen so we're not looking to for some Messenger to come and take us over to the land it's already taken it's already there we've already got a a messenger ain't that right and it may not be in a physical sense but we got the message of the hour amen if we can just believe it and watch what let it take us over into our inheritance that's what this message is about can you say Amen see but it takes courage it takes courage to possess the land you you understand that church amen we're in an age where fear is gripping the people just like it did back then amen at a time that we should rise up in courage to take our inheritance fear is overcoming the age amen see and and those that are gripping those that are afraid to move in with God and to take God at his word watch that spiritual death take place amen and it's just the truth amen see it it it's it's it we're Beyond playing games church we we're just beyond this amen and and and I'm talking for me I'm talking for you I'm talking for anybody that's going to listen to me amen we're just beyond playing gain we're just beyond amen all these things we we look at Russia rising up we look at Israel doing uh uh and and what what's happening there we look at the world condition and how everything is you may think and the world may think it's all chaotic but it's not chaotic according to the Prophecies of God God's already prophesied these things are going to happen but in the middle of all that there's a prophecy concerning the bride that she takes a courage and she possesses the gates of her enemies can you say Amen see so it takes courage Amen to possess the land it takes courage amen we you may be fighting today and you're not fighting a natural battle you're fighting a spiritual battle it's not a natural enemy that you're fighting amen it's a it's a spiritual Enemy enemy Supernatural enemy that you're fighting and and and God cannot use a coward a ain't that right that's what the prophet said God cannot use a coward God cannot use someone that is afraid to take him at his word God cannot use someone that is wholly relying upon their feelings and their Sensations and and and wanting to feel good all the time sometimes amen you ain't going to feel good sometimes you you doubt is going to tried to overtake you sometimes your back is going to be against the wall sometimes you're not going to have all the answers Amen to why the trouble is coming your way sometimes life becomes a headache to ush sometimes being in the will of God Amen sometimes it's just discouraging that somebody has got to take courage Amen to stand there and to keep pressing on Amen and and well the only way you can do that courage comes by believing the word of God do you believe that courage comes by just believing the word of God Amen that's where Caleb's courage come they he believed the word of God Amen well the others didn't believe the word of God they were just following sure they were following but they did not follow holy they didn't follow the word holy therefore they didn't have the courage Amen to go over into the land ain't that that right well you know Saul's an example of how that God would try to get Saul you know tell him what to do but he was a coward he he couldn't face up to the situation and always ducking always trying to find easy route and always trying can you say man well God cannot you depend on someone who backs down now notice in speaking of the children of Israel uh brother brandham said they had already seen these miracles look look what was with them they had the smitten rock with them they could drink from it they had a breast serpent with them for healing they had a prophet with him that had the word of God and over the prophet was a pillar of fire that was doing the leading and not one time everybody say not one time not one time had it ever failed them and we can truly say that not one time has that Pillar of Fire ever failed us not one time has this message ever failed us amen now now you you you can point the blame or they could have pointed the blame at Moses said well he failed him look at him you know but no no who you know who failed him was Kora Kora failed the people Dayan failed the people amen balum failed the people amen they're the one that hindered them from getting into the promised land can you say amen that's exactly right and God swallowed them up God uh uh whatever amen balum uh uh caused the people to commit a sin that God never would forgive them for a ain't that right amen it wasn't the message fault it wasn't Moses's fault it was the people constantly looking for something else outside of the message of the hour amen God can't do anything more than what he does Amen he's Vindicated this message over and over and over and over again he'll never do anymore now we've got to judge it to be right judge it to be true amen ain't that right so it had never failed them he says Oh Glory I feel like shouting look it hadn't failed God doesn't fail he cannot fail and remain God he's still God see the smitten Rock The Brass serpent a prophet an atonement oh do do you understand when we're following a prophet that there is an atonement that is with that there there's the pillar of fire that is with it that there there is a smitten rock that is with it amen everything that Israel had we have it today amen they say well we got to get correct people to Christ before we get into the message amen hogwash amen the fact that they followed Moses's message they had blood with that message they had an atonement with that message they had healing power with that message they had everything that they needed with the message of the hour and everything that they had templified Christ and we have Christ with this message the message is Christ if you need Redemption just stay with the message you need power for healing stay with the message if you need if you're thirsty and you need water amen there's a rock that is following us and that rock is Christ can you say Amen yes sir see the smitten Rock The Brass serpent a prophet and atonement a sacrifice everything Grace had provided for them already see and and after God had done all those things see they were like a lot of people today that has to be babied around but God don't want babies are you with me God God don't want babies God wants men and women you see and and and this is what where we're at today is the land of adoption well what is that land of adoption it's where matured Sons and Daughters of God come into their possession of the word of God it doesn't belong to Pentecostal babies it belongs to matured Sons and Daughters of God not babies can you say amen amen that that's true church I I I hope we get it down to us in in and really down into our heart amen God ain't babying us amen go God ain't going to pamper us amen God ain't just sitting there balling with us and patting on the back and handing us a napkin amen and blow your nose son you know I you poor little thing I I just feel sorry for you no God sent them for a reason he sent them to Kadesh Baria for a reason he had a purpose in doing that ain't that right he allowed them to go through the all these things that they went through to show them their P his power and by the time they got to Kadesh barnea they should have been strong like Caleb and said I don't care about the Giants I don't care about the world city I don't care about any sympton God said it's right and it's right but they didn't do it and you'd think it'd be that same way today amen amen that's right say but a matured son what is a matured Son Well a matured son is an obedient son go go listen to the the words of the message hear ye him and adoption and that a series on adoption and so many other uh uh messages that a a an a a uh an adopted son is a matured son but he's also an obedient son what do you mean he knows how to handle the business he's been under a tutorship and he wasn't looking out the window while the the teacher was trying to say things he wasn't talking and being the class clown while the teacher was trying to teach them something but he was a studious uh uh boy he he he he he was eager to learn about the father's business can you say amen that's right see so he knew he knows that that son is an obedient son knows how to handle the the business knows what needs to be done knows what not needs to be done and and and he's he's he's come into an agreement with the father he's he's past his adolesent uh you know the the teenage years were just arguing and I know better than Dad and and and this and that and and it just becomes a tug-of wh and and and two heads in the house fighting back and forth and and and all these things oh no no no that that's a son amen that is disobedient that's a son that'll never come to adoption that's a son that the father can't trust amen but an adopted son is a son that the father could place his confidence sin amen and give him the inheritance of the land of the business uh whatever so he's in agreement with the Father which for us we're in agreement with the word for the word is God ain't that right amen so so to to say that the message is different from God different from Christ it to me it's a it's an ignorant uh unlearned son amen because if he would listen to the tutor he would find out that the word is nothing but God himself and when you come in agreement with the message you come in agreement with the father amen he's not trying to change things not arguing and complaining about way the father does things ain't that right now brother Brown said if that boy was just a renegade no good didn't care for the father's business all he thought about was flirting and running with women drinking or gambling or horse racing that boy would always be a son but he was never placed in position to have heir to all his father's his what his father had but if he was a good boy and he was about the father's business and he proved to be the right child then they had a ceremony see and and and I had to say it this way but Caleb proved to be the right child amen all these others didn't prove anything amen when the time come when the final test come amen that God would give them over amen and let them come over into the promise land they failed everyone but there was Caleb because he was attentive to the word of God he was attentive to that prophet's words and what that Prophet said Caleb hung his life upon Caleb hung his soul Upon A can you sayen that's right see and so we we find they they took the boy if the right child if he proved the to be the right child they had a ceremony they took the boy out into the street and put a white robe on him they set him up on a scaffold so all the city could see they made a feast uh and a jubilee and the father then had the ceremony of adoption he adopted his own son into his own business and then the son was co-equal with his father in other words if he had been today the son's name on the check was just as good as the Daddy's Oh my he had access to the account he had access to everything that the father had no question to it because he had been proven he had been tried he had been tested amen he had gone on The Proven ground and come out right can you say amen and that's the same way God is proving Us in this age I'm so glad that God sent a prophet I'm so glad to what God done for back then and I I thank God for the stories of that Prophet they never get old amen for for me to hear what God done to that Prophet but it only solidifies my heart that God with that man and whatever that man said that's my absolute can you say amen amen it was a Vindicated uh God Amen God Vindicated that man for me that I could understand and know that this is the Father's will for my life if he said I can do it I can do it if he said this is rapturing age then I better not be flirting around with every other girl I better get ready can you say Amen if he says that this is the age of of of of of transition of translation amen I don't want to play footsie with everybody else I don't want to get every get my eyes off of everything else I want to look at the father's business there is a land for me amen and if I've got to overcome I'm going to overcome if I've got to fight my way I'm going to fight my way I ain't going to let fear dictate me I'm not going to let the demons dictate me I'm going to serve God for this is my age this is my time it's the land of adoption this is the land of adoption can you sayen now thing of it Israel had the word and Caleb had the word they both had the word they both said unto the prophet amen but Israel was not interested in the word oh no when trouble come Amen in the church they all got their nose all in the church's business they all got bothered they all started choosing sides amen they all started getting all tore up about the problems in the church but Caleb wouldn't get troubled up he wouldn't get involved in all that he stayed with Moses he stayed with that word because that word was going to take him somewhere and he gained Courage by the word how often many times people forget the word forget what God promised forget what God said forget about all the things that God has done in this age when trouble come see but they were not interested in the word they didn't pay attention to the word can you say Amen see and and and yet Caleb he paid attention for the word come from a prophet amen amen and you know what as the as our opening scripture we saw that that word that come forth from that Prophet came in down into Caleb and now that word was in Caleb's mouth give me my Mountain why would he say give me my Mountain because the God said that mountain is yours amen how does he know that he's going to overcome how does he know amen that he's going to run that enemy off because God spoke through a prophet and said that mountain is yours that mountain is yours and now the word that come out of that prophet's mouth was now in CB's mouth and he says that's my mountain and every enemy is defeated can you say Amen every enemy is defeated amen see let the word come into your mouth and Amen Let the word come into your mouth can you say Amen don't let words of negativity come in your mouth don't let words of Gossip come in your mouth don't let the words of the world come into your mouth receive the words of Life see the word came forth from the prophet now was in Caleb because he believed every word that the prophet said he knew the prophet was vindica there was no questions to it can you say Amen you know it is troubling when people still questioning the message but let them question it's their testing time amen we're at Kadesh Baria if you want to say it that way amen and and a lot of people are failing because of the troubles are there they're seeing all this stuff trouble around they're getting more caught up in the Politics as though that's going to be their answer oh my yeah God have mercy but there's a bride that's going to be attentive to the word of God and you say amen and and Caleb Caleb seeing the pillar of fire over Moses that Prophet spoke volumes to him that that picture speaks volumes to me I don't just disgard it and say well it's not a Fitting Place for the church and Afraid what people will think for me to happen that that that that speaks volumes to me he saw the cloud he saw the supernatural signs and wonders and knew that they were scriptural he saw everything fitting in place and it gave him courage because he knew he was part of it are you with me do you know that you're part of this thing we're not on the sidelines church God sent a prophet for us he well Malachi 4 you if if you're the believer you're part of Malachi 4 we talk about brother Brandon being part of Malachi 4 We're part of Malachi 4 for God said I'll send unto you Elijah the prophet he sent unto me Elijah the Prophet this message was for me to give me courage can you say amen and the Word was in him in him yes aren't you glad for that I'm going to go back to Joshua 14:9 this is again or yeah uh Caleb speaking Moses swear on that day now he's reminding Joshua he's kept this word in his heart come on now he's kept this word in his heart all these years his soul has clung to these words Moses swear on that day saying surely the land whereon thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance ain't that right and thy children's forever because thou Hast wholly followed the Lord my God and now behold the Lord hath kept me alive oh there's so much there that we could go into have you ever just thought of why the Lord keeps you alive praise the Lord why does the Lord keep preserving you when you get so discouraged and yet you're still here tonight why that's good now amen can you say amen amen you see it it wasn't it wasn't Caleb it wasn't Caleb hiding behind the Rocks when the enemy came and said oh Moses said I'm going to have that land so I better I bet but Joshua you you just forgive me I'm going to go hide just to save my life because there's a promise hovering over me y'all go right ahead no it wasn't up to Josh or Caleb to save his life and and Caleb knew that the Lord hath kept me alive Church there's a promise the Lord has kept my faith intact the Lord has kept my joy intact the Lord has kept my sanity intact can you say man why there's a promise sir for me to fail on that promise would be for God to fail now Caleb was living this he was breathing this this was part of him he knew he couldn't die praise the Lord hallelujah everybody else scared to death but not Caleb he's going to persevere amen can I ask you what is this message to you what's the message to you is it just something you just sitting here following and just just I don't know or you looking at it as promises to you promises to you Satan is breathing his fire down your neck threatening to destroy you amen but there's a word concerning you that you yourself must know God is keeping me alive for this hallu I ain't going to be scared I ain't going to worry I ain't going to fret I going to sit there and and play footy with the devil that's right the Lord has kept me alive these 45 years you think Caleb had trouble you bet he had trouble everybody has trouble we can sit there and and play the violin for us the fiddle on our little old Tunes according to our little old trouble but Caleb had troubles just the same but he kept the word right before him he always kept the word he didn't he knew he was going to face them Giants come on now hello well you are too amen this ain't going to be a cakewalk this isn't going to be just a picnic in the park can you say amen amen so as yet I am a strong this day as this day as I was in the day that Moses sent it to me sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now I pray to God that if God takes us home we don't die half back slid you understand what I'm saying I hope that that that that end of my journey that's right that that my faith is weaker than when it first started I hope not hope not I know when when I first come to this message I was so excited about this message I hope I'm more excited about this message when I die than when I first started I pray that my faith is just as strong or even stronger than when I first started can you say Amen this is Caleb I'm just as strong as it was back then I'm just as able as I was back then and time doesn't make any difference age doesn't make any difference I know I've had troubles down the river but it doesn't make any difference I know I've gone through a lot of things Joshua but but but but it doesn't make any difference I'm looking at the promise he just kept looking at a promise that's it Hallelujah he was different than the rest of them am they looked at the fact that they didn't have food so they complained they looked at the fact that they didn't have you know uh uh water and they complained every time they say well look it would be better if we just all go back yeah God said no they ain't going I've showed them everything I needed to show them and they should have believed me that's right but they ain't going in that Promised Land can you say Amen oh do you love him so this this this explains our our troubles this explains the discouragements this explains the challenges don't don't pray for God to deliver you and take you out of it face it like a Christian face it like a man help us God to face it not complain about it but take God at his word speak the promises of God yes sir amen amen you may not feel like you're going to make it but look at the word God said I will make it amen and when that Revelation came to me that I was part of this bride it's been many years ago and a lot of things have happened since then but I'm still as able I still believe it I know I'm going to be part of it can you say Amen it doesn't matter because I'm looking to an eternal word that's what you got to look at tonight church I'm as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me and my strength as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war everybody say for war my strength is strong for War you can endure your troubles you can endure your trials don't sit there and be moan them you're just as strong today as you was back then you can endure you will endure let that word be in your mouth I believe my strength for war both to go out and to come in therefore Josh you might ought to just passed that over to my children or someone else that's more capable now that's not what he said he said give me my Mountain can you say Amen give me my Mountain amen is that the way you feel amen give me my Mountain well some of you feel that way anyways give me my Mountain I'm going to take it hello going to take it you see Moses wasn't there to keep reminding him of the promise that's right but he didn't need to because that word had now come into Caleb's heart and here years later now he's reminding Joshua Joshua that's my promise I'm going to keep you now I'm going to hold you I'm going to tell you I'm going to remind you of what Moses said to me about my promise yep amen see it was in his mouth the word was in his mouth see we're living in a time where it's the word or it's nothing you cannot rely on your intellect you can't rely upon your goodness you can't rely upon your servitude you can't rely upon nothing you got to rely upon the word of God am hello church amen there is no human way possible that you're going to withstand the devil in this hour but the word of God will withstand him amen the word will with stand any demon amen that's right see so so it's it's the word or nothing and and the testing ground is to see who is really interested in the word that's right interested in the word it's good to say God sent a prophet it's good to Rejoice about God sent in Malachi 4 but who is interested in the word that he brought get in them tapes right are you with me now play them tapes young people play them tapes amen that's true get off that get off that phone get off that YouTube get off Facebook get get get get quit playing the audios of everything else get into the message you're going to need it you got to know what that Prophet said about you you got to identify yourself with that message or you identify yourself with something [Applause] else that's the problem today you get one one girl doing something then all the other girls want to do it so they don't feel left out one boy will do something and he'll say well I'm doing this and I'm doing that and all the other boys will follow that if they're not grounded because they want to identify with something you don't have to identify your marriage with anybody else's marriage you identify your marriage with the message of the hour identify your church with the message of the hour identify your home with the message of the hour hour identify yourself with the message of the hour you don't have to go with anything else let them do what they're going to do I'm going to stay with the message can you say Amen am that's good Hallelujah you see we don't need another Prophet to come on the scene amen we don't need another bride leader we just need someone interested in the word enough to take at his word that's where we're at you love him am that's good the word has come to us by way of a prophet as you know now notice this ain't an easy thing this ain't going to be an easy ride nope El Eve had the perfect word given to her there was no mind battles there was nothing when God gave that word she wasn't fighting sickness she wasn't fighting migrain she wasn't fighting nothing she lived in a perfect Eden amen she had the authority she had Dominion she was co-equal with her husband Adam she knew the will of God that she's the one that stopped to let Satan talk to her yes sir amen and she failed to believe God's word god God's Hebrew bride failed to believe his word that's right Christ Pentecostal bride failed to believe God's word true the prophet said they were all pregnated with the wrong seed before their husband could get to them amen but in this age there is a Perfect Bride A Perfect Bride on the Earth right now in God's Eden no in Satan's Eden Satan has perfected his Eden he's brought it to an evil age of deception and yet God says I'll have a bride amen amen and it's in this age we're put on the the the testing grounds of what we're going to do you're not just hearing from one little imp of a devil you're in hearing from every demon from everywhere on all sides amen come on if Satan can't get you one way he comes out you another way if he can't come you that way he comes at you on three ways he's constantly talking constantly talking constantly talking if he can't scare you he'll entertain you oh yeah hello land of entertainment to pull you away from the word of God suck you away from the word of God and how many people are following for it and then when Satan comes for the final punch they ain't got enough Faith to stand that's right and they're crumbling all right but there's going to be a bride that's going to be attended to the word of God there's going to be young people attending to the word of God I know we're living in an age where young people all they do is grip and complain they grap about their job they comp you know me brother Shi was talking he said you know you you can't even correct them anymore you can't even correct them that's right you correct them they they they just walk off the job that's right there there's nothing there anymore but Tim you know what all that is it's just a soft easy age lazy age but I got good news for you young people God's going to have a bride that's going to be rugged you you young people are are are are cut out uh from all of that you you're a different specimen in in that God has given you a promise and you can't just sit there and belly a you've got to look at your devil your trial your giant and you got to have that same rugged faith that preacher has that Mom and Dad has that the Saints of old have and you got to say give me my [Applause] Mountain you got to know that this Rapture is for you you got to believe it with all of your heart that's right that's why we ain't playing you know footsy with the devil everybody else getting TVs but there's a young people that just ain't wanting it it's just true Lord you know I was raised in in in Pentecost and sad to say we didn't we didn't believe in TVs we didn't believe in going to the movies we didn't believe in makeup we didn't believe in cutting the hair we were Holiness but you know most most of the my friends most of in my age or older or younger and even parents they were only doing it because it was a law a lot of the children were only doing it because their parents made them do it every one of them just about maybe one or two out of 50 60 people young people that I'm personally acquainted with they've all left two three maybe the only ones that are standing in in out of all of that because they were only doing it because of mom and dad they were only doing it because they were made to do it and and and you know it because they would sneak and they got away that that that you know and and even parents would do it too women would do it they they trim their hair just where it wouldn't look like it was cut they try to get away with it wearing makeup to just enough to where it wouldn't being too noticeable hello church it's just the truth but God's got young people that don't care about sneaking around that's right they've got convictions of their own the Ragged Christians they ain't saying well I just I wish I could do that but my parents won't let me no no they're standing on their own two feet because they realize the promise was given to them the words that come out of that prophet's mouth is now theirs they have received itall can you say amen amen Yep this bride of Christ today that's on the earth she is a word bride Amen brother BR said God is proven that she is not like Eve that she is not that type of a woman she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word but she will stand the test that's right aren't you glad for that she will stand the test you know uh brother brah says I'm trying to tell you what's the truth and that's God's word we got to hear that small voice of God to measure up to the word we're going through a time of testing Hallelujah don't you like that we're going through a time of testing then his his his his reaction is going through a time of testing Hallelujah hallu he said did you realize that after that testing come time comes that tutorship of that son that was born into a denominational family if he stood the test and remained with the father's desire then that boy was taken out and he was put on a garment and and then there was a ceremony set and that boy was placed then into the family to which he was born in that's what the matter with our Pentecostals today they just jump here and there and organizations would pull them this way and that way they don't stay with the word but if you'll stay with the word then God sing if you abide in me and my word abide in you see he cannot deny it it's his it's his word then there will be a time sometime where you'll be taken out and set aside and be be given something that's genuine Hallelujah the power of almighty God I don't believe that we got a lot of time I don't believe that there's a time I know you know the prophet now some you know are teaching that as soon as you get the new birth you're adopted well that's not what brother brandham taught totally against what brother Bram taught see and and and and so you got to be attentive to the uh the word of God Amen well the prophet taught that the new birth came and he said that is not your placing that is not your adoption but then there's a time of maturity there's a time of growth and and you say well I I ain't got much time what what what what's the where's the time frame it's not time frame it's how much you can yield to the word of God it's how much you can believe the word of God let the word of God be your headship can you say amen Amen Let the word of God Be Your headship come become so submitted to that word that's why you got to know what the word says and become submitted to it deny yourself and follow him can you say amen that's right see so we find he says see God is waiting for his children but they just won't line up when they come to that testing time will you accept it well the church will put me out all right there you are see then go see that's not Abraham's seed Abraham's seed doesn't act like that Abraham's seed see well now I don't care what come contrary to Abraham he stayed right with the Word of Promise he just stayed right with it no matter how Sarah come and others come different ones come everything he counted it as though it wasn't see he looked he believed that he could see the Promise because God promised it to him and that was all there was to it it was God's word and it stayed right in him ain't that right then God gave him the final test I'll give him a double portion and try him now he's already got the sun he sees that he's got it see but now I'll tell him take that son up and kill it see let that son see will he kill that son I'll try him now I'll try him God loves to try his people I mean he waited I mean you think that would have been good enough waiting for 25 years and and and not even counting anything that was negative his body you know getting older Sarah over there dead doubting you know her wound dead milk veins dried she's over there trying to provide another way and and all of these things but Abraham just stayed with the promise yeah and then he gets the son and God says I'll try him doubly now Abraham go kill him go offer him up as a sacrifice but the word stayed in him that word remained in him he went out there and he told that that his servants he says you'll stay here me and the lad will return why because he knew that even though that boy would die God would raise him up God had promised it to him can you say Amen is that the faith you have tonight if it's not God give it to us can you say Amen if the musicians will come take that son up and kill it let that son see will he kill that son said Abraham true to the word how when how when you receive the promise how you going to stop the thing how you going to how you going to ever expect to be a father of Nations and here you are 115 years old now little Isaac about 15 14 years old how are you going to be a father of Nations when you're 115 years old here's your only child you're destroying your only evidence that you have how am I going to make it if I ever get out of my organization how am I ever going to make it if I do this oh listen to that still Small Voice and come to the word you say I Heard a Voice tell me this if it's contrary to the word it wasn't God's voice God's voice comes to the word can you say Amen you love him that's Hallelujah and what is the word that we're believing Paul says we come not unto you in word only but in power and demonstration of the holy spirit so the word that we're believing is is it's it's made Power brother Bram said as well as in voice so we're not just talking about the Bible anybody could have the Bible and yet have wrong interpretations of the Bible but when you see that scriptures come alive today then you know it's the word of the Lord amen it's the word of the Lord speaking ain't that right therefore we're talking about the Revelation the word that we have received the word that is n thee it's the Revelation that has been preached in power and demonstration and it's matching it's scriptural it's matching every promise of the Bible for this age can you say amen and then when we receive that word into our hearts how do you receive it into your heart by believing it by just simply believing it God said it I ain't going to try to reason it I ain't going to try to figure it out God said it it's over it's done and when you receive it into your heart it becomes into your mouth for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh can you say Amen so we don't speak the word by reasoning you don't reason God's word you speak the word by faith because you believe God's word you believe it you don't consider the symptoms you don't consider the Giants you don't consider the negative you don't consider nothing you received it by faith into your heart and by the mouth the mouth speaketh can you say amen and what does it do you may not have a natural sword but the word in your mouth has become a sword to the enemy amen and what we have is the king sword can you say Amen God's very own word that he used to defeat nations with enemy with Satan with every time he used the word of God right Hallelujah that same word is in our mouth press
