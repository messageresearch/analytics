Jes the son of God Treasure of Heaven crucified Worthy is the [Music] Lamb amen isn't he worthy amen I'm so glad that we have found him found him to be worthy when we looked and we in finding to be uh a Holy Roller or something odd something that we couldn't accept but we found him to be everything that we were looking for and I'm so glad for that amen you love the Lord certainly good to be here amen and uh beautiful day today and uh so we'll take all we can get amen and U it's good to have brother Thomas amen here with us and um uh he's now preaching the gospel amen and so we're thankful to the Lord for raising up young men and uh that carry this message on praise the Lord and um the musicians can be dismissed amen appreciate uh their uh playing and amen I think we've got some of the best musicians in the world Amen and um appreciate them giving their talent over to the Lord um if you'd like to turn with me St John the 19th Chapter and while you're turning um brother Virgil of course has passed away and his memorial service uh will be on Friday and so the visitation will be at 3: in the afternoon and then the service will be at 4: in the afternoon and uh so we want to keep the family in prayer and um the Lord will just um uh Comfort their hearts and be with the um I think it's Full Gospel assembly brother Darren's Church um I guess that's the name of it that's where he attended and I'm sure it's a great loss to them as well so we want to to just keep all of them in our prayer uh also uh we'll be having service this Saturday at 5:00 p.m um with brother Jonas hilderbrandt and U so we want to remember that and um um they're going to we'll be having a fellowship dinner uh Sunday afternoon after the service at Camp Christie and so we want to remember that as well um they uh Camp chrisy uh Diane had called uh sister Martha also told Daniel that they're going to let us uh set up the tent instead of that Monday they're going to let us set it up Sunday so we're going to we're going to do that um that way um uh it'll make it easier on you brethren uh to where you wouldn't have to miss work I know um some um have to operate businesses and things like that and so it would make it easier if we done it Sunday afternoon and so we're going to be setting up the tent uh on the 13th of April on a Sunday after the morning service so um um just remember that instead of uh Monday it'll be the the 13th on Sunday and um anyway it's hard to believe that the meeting is already coming up and getting all geared up and prepared and and so looking forward to a wonderful time in the Lord um and uh so I think um this um uh Sunday brother Sandy and His congregation will be coming or uh some of them or uh Saturday and Sunday and so uh uh looking forward to having them as well to be in service with us and uh uh so uh been a while since we've got to see brother Sandy and uh sister Hannah and uh so it'll be good to have them uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord and uh father Lord we stand before you realizing our insufficent efficiency and our need for you father I just pray Lord that you would come in a special way and just have Supreme control over this portion of the service lord it's your word and it's anointed father for it come from you these are words of life and now we pray that you would just anoint your servant and father help me to yield myself to you and that you could take what simple words we would have and that you would multiply them to the people and may they just uh the words find a beding ground in every heart Lord father draw us closer to you as our prayer and Lord we be careful to give you praise and glory in Jesus Christ's name amen so we look at John the 19th Chapter and I'm just going to read the 30th verse and it says when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished everybody say it with me it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost you can have your seats this evening and um I will use the title again it is finished and I'm so glad for that what a reality that is to us and it it must be a revelation to us as all things of the scriptures uh must be um and it must be um uh predominant in this age because there is so much fear so much anxiety so much worry that is prevailing in the land today um it's a fulfillment of Prophecy for Jesus said that there would be uh men's Hearts would fail them for fear and the prophet he said this he said the biggest trouble there is in the church today is a bunch of fear so not just not just fear in the world but they fear in the church and and of course fear does not come from God it's of the devil for the Bible says that God has not given us the spirit of fear but of love peace and a sound mind so he says people's always scared and that's of the devil now notice what he says next don't be scared now this is the prophet of God tell telling us don't be scared be brave everybody say be brave see he said you don't have to uh have nothing to be then he says there ain't nothing to be afraid about see there's nothing to be afraid about simple words but what a revelation when fear is trying to grip the hearts of the people not only out in the world but in the church a prophet stands and tells us there's nothing to be scared or afraid about so people are afraid uh in in one place he tells us that people are afraid that they ain't going to get healed uh and we could say that they're afraid that they're not going to get their Deliverance they're afraid that they're not going to get their prayer answered maybe they're praying for lost loved ones or whatever and they're afraid that somehow something's going to happen to them before uh uh uh they give their heart to the Lord or or whatever but the prophet says uh they're scared that God will not keep his word now now that's all part of the devil just as well so so there are there are people that are uh uh they're scared they're they're fearful of looking for things that are coming up on the earth they don't know anything about the future they they they're they're just running scared and then there's people that are just scared that God won't keep their word keep keep his word and and brother brandom says in another place the American Christian seems to be afraid that God won't keep his word now that's the American Christian and afraid if you just don't squeeze and hold or something he said see it's nothing that you can do in the beginning it's what God has done can you say Amen so this this word finished it it is finished as as we talked about it last Wednesday I believe it means entirely done amen that's what finished is it means there's nothing else to be done it's uh uh nothing that uh uh anyone can do and and he says the whole Plan of Salvation all that can be done for mankind by the heart of God was finished when Christ said those words it is finished the whole plan of God was finished at that time now he says now in another place what is finished then our complete ticket all the way to Glory it's finished can you say Amen so he didn't just finish the beginning part of your life amen but he finished it all the way to Glory it is finished and he says it was wrote out at Calvary in the blood of Jesus Christ Christ so then all we have to do is rest brother Matthew that that's all we've got to do is is just rest and so I looked up in the Webster what what does rest mean and and it means freedom from labor you don't have to labor you're free from it you're you're at rest that's that's all you've got to do is just rest it means to refrain from labor or exertion to be free from anxiety or dis disturbance ain't that right see so this is what was given to us when when the plan of God was finished at at Calvary brother brandham says there's nothing there can be nothing else added to it nothing else taken from it that settles it the Bible is finished the plan of God is finished the atonement is made the devil is defeated and the only thing we have to do do is look and live can you say amen amen don't have to recite Creeds don't have to be something special all you have to do is look and live ain't that right but it's it's funny of how that man always wants to have something uh uh to do with his salvation and and the prophet had dealt with it uh uh uh many times and but but th this comes from the Fallen nature that carnal nature of of man where he has to have something to do with it it was after that man had sinned or Adam had sinned that he tried to cover himself up and and uh the prophet said the holy image of God had had left him and and so now he's he's left with a carnal nature a a backsliding sinful State and and all of these things and so in his carnal State he he came up with his own covering his own religion Amen to cover him and and and and and and and to act as though uh nothing was a Miss nothing was wrong but we find that that covering didn't work amen when God come in the cool of the evening and and Adam uh ran and hid from God ain't that right but see we we find the Bible says the carnal mind is enity against God for it is is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so all of our own efforts to cover ourselves and to have our own religion and and to do something uh uh for our Salvation amen is always contrary to God's plan because we do it by a carnal nature we do it uh from a carnal standpoint ain't that right amen so man-made religion will not work there's nothing that that will work do you believe that amen there is nothing and and and we I know this is simple but there there's not one of us uh that can save ourselves amen you you there's no you can't be educated enough can't be good enough smart enough Rich enough or whatever as the prophet said we're all born defeated amen we're all born defeated and so therefore we all have something common in common now now there may be uh uh guys that are very rich and and uh here we are we we we may not be doing too good uh in in business-wise or MoneyWise or or whatever but but what makes us all common is we're all born defeated can you say amen amen see and and and yet God allowed us to be born this way amen he allowed it Romans 8 and2 tells us that we were made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who subjected the same in Hope ain't that right so God subjected us to vanity God subjected us to uh uh allowed us to be born Sinners and and allowed us to be M Misfits and uh to to to you know to to be Renegades if if you could say that way he allowed us to be miserable failures and he he he made it to where we would have our complexes and our struggles and and our mistakes and uh to be he allowed us to be trapped into sin can you say amen he made it to where we would know defeat and and what it would be uh like to to be enslaved to to the devil and to be afflicted he made it to where we would be helpless and and hopeless and uh uh uh full of uh of uh of things that we have to deal with with in this in this old flesh but see God made it that way but yet the same God that made us subject to this vanity also made us subject to a hope a ain't that right see but it would take a work of Grace amen he didn't just subject us to vanity and then to Hope and then leave us to our own self to get us out of the mud pit and and get us out of the condition of vanity and hopelessness and and and unworthiness and and get us to a place amen that's not up to us it would take an work of Grace aren't you glad for that amen a work of Grace to bring us from one condition to uh another amen for as we all know if you've lived long enough you cannot pull your own self up by your own bootstraps amen see and so we were all born as the prophet would call it uh you know like an like man in a pit that had fallen in a pit trying to get back up trying to scramble trying to climb his way but the walls are too smooth and too slick and too high and and there there's no way we could get our own foothold and climb our way up and and all of these things uh we we have nothing to pull ourselves up can you say Amen so God made it to where that the only thing that could get us out is he himself amen he he would do that and you know we sing that old song Love Lifted Me Love Lifted Me when nothing else could help God's Love Lifted Me ain't that right so you know men men through through uh history throughout history and time has um uh been able to maybe some men have been able to break uh uh uh uh past and break through break out of the most secured prisons in the world and and and they were held in captive in in some building or some dungeon and and natural bars and and they were able maybe to dig themselves out or uh uh do do whatever but see our captivity uh was a spiritual condition ain't that right amen and and so no man uh uh is able to escape that um the the condemnation of sin that that weighs him him down amen he can't escape that on his own he can't escape the carnal nature within him on his own he he cannot escape the carnal desires that come from within amen as we have seen you know every New Year people are making a New Year's Revolution and and uh uh turning over a new Leaf but they're all the time failing because they can't escape that carnal nature that thing that makes them do what they do they can't escape it and and so they they find themselves a slave no man can overcome the death sentence that he is under on his own ain't that right amen but God made it amen he made it to where he would be the hero to our story and our story is not one of of Vagabond our story isn't one of of just a sinner a rotten no good but our story is a story of redemption can you say amen and so God made it to where he would get the glory and honor and praise from us amen Isaiah 43 and 13 God says yay before the day was I am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand and and I tell you church that's exactly the way God wanted it amen he didn't need help from us he didn't need help from you the preacher or or or the the the pope or or whatever in him alone is the attribute of Savior in him alone is the attribute of healer there is no doctor that can heal there is no preacher that can heal there is nobody there's no medicine that can heal God Alone is our healer God Alone is our savior Our Redeemer our deliverer amen so there is no other savior God speaks in in Isaiah 46 and5 saying to whom will you liken me see and make me equal and compare me that we may be alike amen see so God knows amen that there's nothing like him amen there's God knows that amen out anything outside of him is a creation he's the only Creator can you say Amen amen he's not just an inventor he's a Creator man invents things God creates things a ain't that right see and so God knows that we cannot save ourselves amen and he knows that that no man uh preacher Deacon uh doctor whatever has that ability uh uh to heal there is no not a denomination that can re redeem or deliver uh there there's no politician that that that can bring uh uh what we need and God knows that ain't that right so this is why he would say in Isaiah 22 or 45:22 look unto me ain't that right amen there's one thing that we need to look at in this age and that's to God don't look at a personality don't look at a man don't look at a church don't look at a religion don't look at a Doctrine don't look at anything else but look unto him and he says look unto me and be ye saved to all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else amen I think that's our Christian that's is the the the point of Christian life is to understand that he is God and there is none like him and to understand that we are in his hands and and that that there's nothing that can deliver take us from from his his hands amen so so don't look to anyone else amen don't don't look to anything else amen don't look to yourself don't look to a denomination or an organization don't look to your family don't look to your husband your wife your children your parents don't look to a preacher don't look to any professional look to him and be ye saved all ye ends of the Earth can you say Amen now God says here in in Isaiah 46 and3 hearken unto me oh House of Jacob and all the remnant of the House of Israel which are born by me from the belly which are carried from the womb and even to your old age I am he and even the hair to hairs will I carry you I have made and I will bear I even I will carry and I and will deliver you can you say Amen so here's God promising I'm going to carry you I'm going to deliver you I'm the one that made you I'm the one that kept you and I am the one amen see it's me so to whom will you liken me and make me equal and compare me that we may be like he says they lavish gold out of the bag and weigh silver in the balance and hire a Goldsmith and he maketh it a god they fall down yay they worship they bear him upon the shoulder they carry him and set him in his place and he standeth and from his place shall he not be removed or shall he not remove yay not one one shall cry unto him yet can he not answer nor save him out of his trouble remember this and show yourselves men bring it uh uh uh again to mind oh ye transgressors remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God God there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from the ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure can you say Amen so so it it is God and and and and he should get the glory that's what he wants is the glory out of our lives he wants the glory out of our songs he wants the glory out of our preaching he wants the glory out of Our Testimony he he wants the glory out of out of our worship can you say man everything he wants the glory for he's the only one that's God Amen we we don't uh uh I I know there's Gods out in the world there there there's millions of gods amen not just outside of Christendom but inside of Christendom where men have their own imagination of what God is amen preachers preaching behind the pulpit and deny God the right to be a Healer to the people and God the right to come down and deliver amen they would rather uh lean to a program that man has made and teach man uh how to deal with alcoholism instead of a God to come down and deliver them but see God is God ain't that right we shouldn't lean to all these crutches and and all these man-made things there's one God and he's the one that's got us in his hands and has promised to deliver us now many men have have died and we know that uh and you know there have been other men that hung on a cross uh like Jesus did you know but there's no other man's death has that ability had the ability Amen to finish the Plan of Salvation you see because Jesus wasn't just a man but he was God living in a human Tabernacle called flesh human flesh ain't that right amen and and he was created amen he he didn't have the human blood as far as sex blood uh Gentile blood he you know people call him a Jew he was not a Jew people call him a gentile or whatever he was not such he was neither Jew nor Gentile and you're not saved by the blood of a Jew or a gentile you're saved by the blood of God it was God's creative blood that was living or flowing through them veins a ain't that right see and so his death was was to think of it his death was not the result of men taking him captive and forcing him to go to Calvary and forcing him to lie down on the cross and forcing his hands to to to to uh you know forcefully holding his hands in place his feet and place so they could drive and nail and all that no no no many men had been forced to die but not this man not Christ can you say Amen John 10:17 Jesus says therefore doth my father loved me because I Lay My Life down no one took that his life from him he laid his life down can you say Amen but he had a reason for it amen he had a reason no man taketh from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again this commandment have I received of my father amen 1 John 3:16 it says hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us he laid it down can you say Amen think of that that's the god that we serve is that God would become human being amen so that he could lay down his life for us he couldn't do it in spirit form amen but he promised that he would be Our Redeemer he promised amen that he would bring a way back for us to be Sons and Daughters of God he promised that he wouldn't leave us subject to vanity uh uh always amen but he would bring us back to a hope can you say amen amen the Bible tells us that God commended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us amen so that he had to do it that way he he couldn't wait for us to become righteous and then Die For Us amen because we couldn't be righteous in that way can you say Amen so Calvary is not a work of rebellious men it's not even the work of Satan amen and and even though these men who crucified him was anointed of the devil yet calary was not is not a work of Satan it's not a work of rebellious men it's a work work of Grace can you say Amen Calvary is a work of Grace amen that he would willfully lay down his life amen see this comes from the unconditional Covenant that God made see it's not what you or I have done it's solely based on what he has done can you say Amen we are his victory do you believe that we are his victory he went to fight for us he went to battle for us amen he sought to to pay the price for us he sought to set us free he sought to heal us he sought to redeem us he sought to save us and Deliver Us he sought to Amen to to answer every one of our prayers he sought to live down inside of us and to Quicken us amen and we are his victory we are we are his victory you believe that amen you see and we had nothing to do with it amen as as when God made that un unconditional Covenant with Abraham amen God put him in a deep sleep Amen to show that a Abraham had nothing to do with this Covenant amen it's uh brother brand says see an evening time or when the sun went down watch what happened first a real deep sleep fell over Abraham showing Abraham now I made a covenant with Adam Adam if you'll do and I'll take you in partners with me if you'll do certain things I'll do certain things and Adam broke his promise man always breaks his promise can you say amen and and I'd have to say that we've broken our promises brother Terry amen all of us have broken our promise in one way or another amen so if this was another conditional Covenant we'd be of all men most wretched and miserable and Hell bound but God made an unconditional Covenant can you say amen that's right see and so he says uh man always breaks his Covenant but Abraham God says to Abraham but Abraham this is this is not what if you'll do this is what I'm going to do can you say Amen it's not what you do it's what he has done this is my Covenant with you unconditionally another place Abraham I'm just going to shut you off to show you there's not one thing you can do about it this is my Covenant can you say amen God had a covenant that we had nothing to do [Music] with amen another place he says what was it God saying now Abraham my son I'm going to show you that it's not going to be nothing that you have to do I'm going to do it anyhow I'm determined to save man regardless so I'm not making a covenant depending upon you like I did Adam I'm making a covenant with myself and you have nothing to do with it Abraham I'm not resting that Covenant up you I'm resting that Covenant upon me he said I'm determined to save man regardless and God's going to do it by Grace he will do it can you say Amen see so therefore none of us needed to be there that day at Calvary amen God could have a Calvary and have a sacrifice even before we were born amen and and we we didn't because we had nothing to do with it this was his Covenant that he would make with himself can you sayen amen see and at that day at Calvary before we had done good or evil before we breathe the first breath or even recognized upon Earth God could say at Calvary it is finished can you say amen amen without me having to do one thing about it he finished it because it's his Covenant it's his work amen and it was ryant upon him Lord finish the work before we were even born can you say Amen so if we could just see just how secure we are amen and quit letting that devil just run us ragged can you say amen I I I don't believe that God has called us to be a Christian to live our Christian lives afraid of being lost afraid of being going to hell afraid of of being turned down can you say Amen at the End Amen I believe that he sent his spirit in this day crying Abba Father amen his Spirit within us bearing witness that we are sons of God and we need to quit let the the devil tell us amen that we're Misfits and that we're Bound for hell and that we've crossed the line of Mercy amen and look to Calvary and say but it's finished notice John 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not everybody say shall not shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death un life I'll say that again he that heareth my word I say the message of the hour he that heareth the word for the age can you say amen he that knoweth his place lord well brother Brown said he that understandeth his place for this hour amen he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation you think God just you didn't stumble into this message just by accident you didn't stumble in it well I was born in this message so I just couldn't help it amen there's a lot of people that was born in this message and walked away when he's just old enough to do so amen and and then there's others preachers that were raised in this message and now flat deny this message and and curse the the god of brother brandom and and and the angel and the pillar fire all of these things see amen it's no accident that you're still believing this message I thank God for the message of the hour can you say amen amen it's something that Drew me to this message it wasn't intellect it wasn't amen because there's a retirement fund at the end when I get old or whatever amen it was the fact that there was a deep calling unto the Deep amen now notice he that heareth understandeth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is already passed but is already passed from Death un life think of that you're already you're not in the balance you're not teetering the fence you know leaning to death and leaning to life and leaning to death and trying to hang you've already pass you're not on the fence anymore you're into life you pass from Death under life so as Believers we don't have to worry about being lost amen and and to be honest I God doesn't want us to worry about being lost come on church that's of the devil that's for fear can you sayen sure you got to make your calling and election sure and and if you don't know where you stand then make your calling and election sure amen and then stand upon the word amen now watch John 6:37 all that the father giveth me shall come to me when were they given to him before the foundation of the world when your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life hello the lamb was slain for them names amen amen and all that the father ha given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out rough Sinners as we may be we may painted the town red and all the faults and the failures that's right yet he says I will not cast them out can you say Amen for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is aren't you glad he knew this is the Father's will that sent me that all of uh that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing that's the father's will that every name every one that he gave to him he would lose not one and they would come to him and he would not cast them out am talking about the grace of God but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone that which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I'll raise him up at the last day so the prophet read that scripture and says and they cannot be lost you cannot be lost can you say Amen cannot be lost now you say you know he says well then people people thinks that that makes people loose that kind of teaching makes people loose so people think he said but brother you don't serve God under a frown under a frown of a serpent God is not one of those these guys with the black snake whip driving you around he's a father he's love God is love and the Bible said in St John he that loveth is of god you love God you love God how many loves God you love God well most of us love God and he says see I wouldn't be if I went out and got on a drunk tonight I never drunk in my life but if I went out and got a drunk I wouldn't be afraid of getting a weapon that isn't the reason I don't go and do it so we don't go you know abstain from drinking because we're afraid God get mad at us we don't abstain from the movies and and and and the wh house and and all of these things and from smoking and cussing and swearing and all these afraid that God's going to kick us out he said that isn't the reason I don't go and do that stuff the reason I don't do it is because I love him amen can you say amen I love him I come to church because I love him turn my head from them women because I love him can you say amen I love him he loves me I love him he loves me now that's where we got to come to is understanding he loves me it's not a works of law it's not something that I got to do it's because he's already done something for me and I love him for it can you sayen is that not what the gospel is is to show what he's done for us to bring our love and our appreciation to a greater place he's already already done something for me and I love him for it there you are see so God wants us to love him how many believes that God wants us to love him but love doesn't come by law living under law remember Israel came out of Egypt under Grace Grace was there before law prise the Lord amen Israel was in Egypt without law right they didn't have any laws the prophet said there was grace and grace provided them a profit Grace provided them an atonement Grace provided a pillar of fire not law Grace So law came into the piture because again Israel wanted something to do for themselves yeah yeah yeah instead of relying upon the grace of God but law is not what brought them out of Egypt it was Grace under a sacrificial lamb Grace provided the lamb to bring them out God didn't give them a law well if you do this and if you do that if you do this then I'll bring you out it was simply Grace providing an atonement amen and when they came came out there was not a feeble person among them now think of that there was you know and and uh if you watched the Ten Commandments you you you know that now they put that there's feeble people and all that but the Bible says there wasn't a feeble person among them that's right Psalms 105:37 he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes so they might have been 150 and they yet they were not feeble yeah why Grace and I say to you there's there there's not I say there's not going to be a feeble person amen that coming into this bride we ain't barely making this thing Grace Grace yes sir God's Great Grace is upon this people can you say Amen it's the grace of God so as the prophet told us law is the polian that put you in jail Redemption is what pays for your fine and get you out law imputes condemnation amen so if you've got condemnation then you're not serving God right you're not understanding the grace of God you're you're under this this this this law amen and and law can never save a sinner can you say Amen it's the grace of God that resurrects faith in the heart of the believer and therefore righteousness is imputed unto him see so if you're if you're living under under the law then you'll never see the love that God has for you under law breath fear Grace breeds Faith that's right can you say Amen see and and and so you know if if you're living under the law you you'll never be able to understand the love that God has for you therefore you'll never be able to love him appropriately or accurately or uh uh to love him because 1 John 4 19 says we love him everybody say I love him because he first loved us he's the one that initiated the love relationship he first loved me and my response is I love him back can you say Amen so then brother bradam says now if you love him you don't have to worry if you love him just do what you want to it'll always crying to do something for him crying you love him day and night if something had happened you'd happen to be trapped into something the bitter tears would run down your cheeks all night you couldn't have no rest for the souls of your feet till you come back to the art again Ark again can you sayen see so it's not a have to it's not a burdensome amen it's not making you do something it's just falling in love with him and when you fall in love with him you're not worried about being lost you're not worried about making mistakes you're not worth cuz you don't want to make the mistakes and you know you'll make mistakes but when you make them mistakes there's you just can't stop until you get right back again it's just a love can you say amen I hope this all right so notice God brought Israel out of Egypt to bring them into the land of promise the promise came by grace and not by law amen not Abraham if you do this I do this but Abraham I give it to you yeah but what what I just gave it to you but Israel chose law over Grace because they wanted to have something to do with it think about that did it bring him more faith into God no did it bring him into a greater love relationship with God no did it cause them to understand the message of the hour more no can you say Amen see and so under law they never came to know the grace of God under law they never came to know the supernatural power of God under the law they never come to know the intent and desire of God brother Bram says see it's law that brings us to recognize we're wrong but it's Grace That Forgives us the law has no hope of redemption and to uh uh uh and to complete it it can't see so see it has no Grace in it law has no Grace in it because law only points that you are a sinner but Grace tells you how to get out of it so Israel under law never learned how faithful God was they never learned the mercy of God true so therefore they continued in their unbelief because because they were under law see it was a fatal mistake the prophet said see instead of resting in God's provision provided way in resting in God providing a prophet God providing a a Brazen serpent God providing a pillar of fire to lead them God providing an atonement they continued in their unbelief and hardened their hearts yeah now in Paradox I think in' 61 or 62 of course the message is profound and brother Brad leading up to what was coming in the opening of the word but he tells us he's talking about law and Grace and he said Joshua represented Grace and Moses represented the law Grace could not exist at the same time law existed Joshua then could not come into His full ministry while Moses was still there Joshua was there but he couldn't come into his ministry because of Moses the law ain't that right so therefore Moses had to go off the scene so that Joshua could come into his ministry why law could not take the people over into the promise and law cannot take us over into the land of the book open book where all the promises become a reality can you say Amen it will not take you to your promise law will not take you to your healing law will not take you to your adoption law will not take you to Salvation law will not take you to the authority and manifestation of sunship only Grace the ministry of Grace could take them over into the land of inheritance and positionally plac them the land was already given to them by Grace amen can you sayen so the difference Moses or Joshua's Ministry wasn't dealing with the People based on what they did didn't do his ministry dealt with the People by what God had promised them Lord his ministry dealt with their predestination can you say Amen brother brandham said the promised land represented a day of Grace no law a day of Grace I know you might be a scumbag I know you might be a misfit I know you might be a weakling I know all these but I'm reminding you of God's promise can you say Amen not pointing to what you've done amen not pointing to what you are not pointing to how you feel but pointing to what God has already done God gave them this land and this inheritance was predestinated to them now we know that the message of the hour is what the message of Grace amen exactly go listen to the message of Grace Amen brother Brandon preached on it the message of Grace amen it's a message of Grace not a message of Law and man have have ministers tried to to to make it about law make this message about law of dos and don'ts yes the apostolics and and a lot of them make this Bible of of law amen but we found out by the message of Grace that it's actually a book of love it's a love letter to God writing a love letter to his bride can you say Amen see so we're not living in a time of law this is not a time of law don't come under a a law it's a day of Grace God thought of you before the foundation of world you were a seed Gene of God in God's mind you are an attribute of his thinking ain't that right that's what the message of Grace has been telling us you're an attribute of his thinking yeah but you don't understand how I feel that doesn't matter you are an attribute of what God thought of you in the beginning can you say Amen you are an eternal Gene seed yes sir and it's thinking then you were righteous you were holy you were perfect in his thinking you wasn't a sinner in his thinking you were a son Amen in his thinking that's right there you go amen now we were trapped into sin at the beginning but the Bible says Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil sir now brother brandham in the mystery of Christ revealed said justified in his sight why are we Justified we are his victory can you say that with me I am his victory well why are you his victory because I did have nothing to do with it he's the one that done it I'm his victory all of that work was to bring me forth and here I am not as a sinner not as a as a son of Duran Martin but I'm here as a Son of God Amen the church is his victory we come forth in this last day with his glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him Satan couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us ain't that right that we're bound right see we're already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational Creeds to an eternal word of the Eternal God which is him himself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever so Christ was God's provided sacrifice that would finish the plan amen aren't you glad for that Amen to God it wouldn't have mattered if anyone else said it was finished but when he said it is finished it was finished God couldn't have come up produced a better sacrifice than Christ amen if he could have produced it he would have done it that Christ was none other than himself in human flesh and it was at that moment when Christ said it is finished that Satan's power was broken and now he's nothing but a bluff that's right ain't that right Amen brother brandom said in the old Covenant what if a little mule would be born out in some pastor some night he said I don't know whether you ever farmed any or not but this mule was born a flopped ear that's a horrible mule to begin with he's knock kneed and crosseyed and his tail sticks right straight up is what a horrible looking mule now if he could look around to his mommy Mammy he'd say you know what as soon as the Master of the House comes out he's going to knock me in the head I'm not even worth uh the food I eat I'm no good but if his M Mammy was really instructed she'd say but wait a minute son just a minute I'm going to tell you something you don't know that's what I want to tell you see you don't know who you are son see you you see you're born under a Birthright and when the master of the house I don't care what you look like when the Master of the House comes out uh uh to see he's got a new mule born the thing then the thing he has got has to do is go get a lamb without a blemish and take that perfect lamb and that perfect lamb dies so that you can live then the little mule kicked up his can kick up his heels and have a big time can you say Amen see he had a mamy that knew he had a mamy that knew the book and so did we have a prophet to know the book and to tell us something that we didn't know ain't that right he said well that's the way it is with us we're imperfect no good born in sin shape in iniquity come into the world speaking lies we're no good to begin with but God don't look at you amen he looks at the sacrifice he looks at the lamb he doesn't see you because he sees Christ Christ died for you how many believes Christ died for you Christ died for you that's that's not just something a cliche of words that is a true Revelation he died for me died for you amen that's right see now he says now if you can find some Fault With Jesus then your healing might not be right but if you don't find no fault with him then it's perfect your healing is perfect see sure God called you by his grace not that not that you would but if God would see the scripture said he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world that was God God's word and when God speaks it's as good as finished right then another place that little mule could kick up them little heels and knock them little uh uh knock knees together and nicker and go all over the field because he's free he don't have to die a lamb died for him he's perfectly safe oh is that the way you feel tonight you're perfectly safe don't have to fear about dying the lamb died for him you don't have to fear about what you are it's what he was he was the one who died for you then you find fault in him then I'll tell you why you can't be healed see but when you find no fault in your sacrifice God's accepted that sacrifice and when he accept the sacrifice he accepts your confession in that sacrifice and you become part of it he said I feel religious now cuz I know I didn't have a chance to begin with but I didn't look at myself I looked at the sacrifice that was offered for me it was perfect and God already accepted it so then I'm all right now when I see what he did what he is it isn't me it's him it isn't you it's him can you say Amen I'm not the perfect one he's the perfect one I find no fault in him the Lord can you say Amen so we're entering into the land of promise this is the time the message of Grace and brother Bram says now you don't come by laws and rituals and orders you come by predestination that's right amen can you say ma'am you don't worship because it's a ritual thing it's something that's in you you're coming by predestination you're you're not doing these things because someone's forcing you and someone's compelling you and someone's making you do it and and they're working the music up and they're getting everything all geared up no you're coming by predestination another place he says we're end ending the seventh Church age the church age the Pentecostal age do you see it we're entering that Holy convocation we're entering into that real genuine eternity where the church is called not to some station or some denomination but into eternity with their Eternal King we don't have it at all no such things as days and things and times you passed into eternity where you come from you was there to begin with another place he says you enter into life not keeping a day or a shadow Paul said over there in Hebrews the 4th chapter you keep days and shadows and things like that I'm scared of your experience we don't pass into certain days and orders you passed from Death under life not days and times you passed into eternity it was finished can you say Amen it's finished so then everything a Christian has brother Bram said it's his faith resting in the finished works of Calvary everything was finished and completed and now we just rest our faith in a finished work because we not find no fault in him we find no fault in his sacrifice we find no fault in his blood I find no fault in his life I find no fault in the virgin birth yeah I find no fault in what he had to say Amen to the Pharisees and the saddu I find no fault in him amen can you say Amen see therefore I'm not looking at him blaming him I'm not looking at the word finding fault for he is the word I'm resting in it my faith is resting in a finished product a finished work it's finished that's right thank [Music] Lord everything was finished and completed and we rest our faith in the finished work now notice what he says and any gift that says different anything different from that don't believe it it's not of God hello cuz there's where the price was paid there's where everything was finished right there amen sir so we're looking at our sacrifice now notice 1 John 2 And1 my little children these things write I unto you that you sin not and if any man sin everybody say it if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Christ Jesus the righteous John is speaking to Sinners or to Christians not Sinners right my children I write these things unto you ain't that right see co-workers in the gospel brother BR says how we could go into details with that and break that down of how that it makes the Holy Ghost makes intercession for our ignorance we have an intercessor an advoc an uh uh an advocator sometimes he said we got the Holy Ghost we stag ignorantly stagger into something the holy spirit is there to make advocate for us he's our advocator amen he's our attorney he stands there and pleads for us can you say Amen we don't plead for ourselves because the Holy Ghost in US pleads for us have you ever just done something wrong and there's just a burden in your soul in your Agony oh God forgive me oh God I'm sorry oh there's something there there's a the holy spirit in there making intercession amen hello amen I believe it and the Holy Spirit giving utterance sometimes with words you can understand and he makes intercessions for us that's what the Holy Ghost is when I walk into anything I walk like a little kid you walk like a little fella see we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything and you say oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to take a Christian Life I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid I'll do this don't be afraid we have an advocate he doesn't have to come and die for you again it was finished oh he stands by us he's in us he makes intercession for us the Holy Spirit constantly constantly making an advocate for us all the time can you say Amen so our sins doesn't make us sinners all over again are you with me now you get the Holy Ghost you're sealed till the day of your Redemption and you make a mistake that don't make you a sinner again Christ doesn't have to come over and die for you again it was finished the ticket was already paid for you to make it all the way to the other side sir that's right brother Brian says now you will do wrome but you won't do it willfully you don't do it willfully you're trapped and anything you're trapped into two or do something that you don't mean to it's not sin yet for you'll repent the minute you see that you're wrong you'll turn quickly and say I didn't see that I didn't mean you'll say that all through life a man don't want to be that's the reason we are so stupid and so in dark down here on the earth that's there's a blood atonement for us all the time to keep us covered there's nothing for you to do but simply believe nothing did you know that there's nothing else for Jesus to do when he said it was finished his work was done the Bible says he went he is sitting at the throne at the right side of the father brother brand says when a man sits down that means he's finished and he sat down at the right hand of the father to show that it is finished amen can you say Amen am if Jesus was standing here in a suit and tie you came and you needed healing oh and you asked him to heal you you know what he'd say no I can't right I've already done it it's finished so you can't get him to do something he's already done he's not here to Redo can you say Amen so then he cannot save you cannot heal you he's I've already did that so he says if you was a sinner and you'd come tonight you couldn't be saved tonight I'm going to say that again that's pretty powerful isn't it if you was a sinner you came tonight you couldn't be saved tonight you would have to accept your salvation that was paid for you 1900 years ago Jesus saved you when he died and said it's finished that's when he saved you that's when he healed you that's when he delivered you hello church that's when he made a way for you to overc come that's when he made a a way for you to come to a millennium and a Rapture and be part of that new Heaven and Earth right right that's when he saved you but you have to accept it when he knocks at your heart then you accept your salvation you accept Jesus as your personal savior he was wounded for your transgression with his stripes you was healed you have to accept him as your healer on the same basis you accept him as your savior amen so quit looking forward to what he's going to do he's already done it so therefore our faith is based upon a finished work it's done it's finished now go your way rejoicing don't bring let the devil bring you into fear don't let the never bring you under condemnation you're under grace it all was done by grace for you can you say Amen oh isn't he wonderful so we believe you must accept that finished work of Calvary now brother Bram said if you don't accept it then the gospel isn't going to do you any good remember the story of The Crow you know the crows kept flying over and the farmer didn't like it so he finally trapped one of them and caught him and he tied him up put a string to his little foot and to a pole and and the crow could go a little ways but he'd come to that end of the rope and he'd fall back right and so this happened day after day when he'd see all the crows coming over he he'd go and and and try to join them and fall back and next day triy to join him fall back and finally got to know his boundary got hurt too many times of trying got discouraged from trying always a failure by trying so he just gave up he had run out there but he knew his his boundary now one guy just coming along and he saw that little bird and he felt sorry for that little guy so he got his little pocket knife and he he was able to catch that bird and he loosened that rope let him down and the bird just sat there and he went ahead and left and the crows crows coming over you know and oh that old crow he looked at him and he he went but he'd only go to his only certain spot only and yet he didn't know he was free because in his mind he had come to so used to habits and I'm telling you right now don't get used to failure so used to failure that you give up trying don't get so used to your habits that you lose sight of Victory can you say Amen to where the devil can convince you you'll never be able to fly like that you'll never be able to be like that I'm telling you it's finished it's over can you say Amen keep flying keep trying keep believing brother Bram said if you're sick I wished I could heal you but no man can do that it's already done healing lies in you who what I've Been Waiting for God to do it healing lies in you it's your faith in the finished work that God did on Calvary with Jesus Christ outside of that there is no healing outside of that there is no salvation no church no denomination no ritual nothing packs salvation Jesus Christ he was wounded for our transgression with his stops we were healed he was wounded for our transgressions transgressions he says excuse me by his stripes we were all in past tense we were healed our sins were forgiven back then can you say Amen we were delivered back then our way was Secure back then sir oh my don't sit around say oh I'm just waiting on God to do something no it's in your hands it's in your hands can you say Amen but here's the thing about it the faith that the believer has is God's Own Faith yes sir it's the faith of God you see when he sent his Spirit back into you it was to Bear witness with your spirit that you are the Son and Daughter of God he comes in you the same God that stood on the invisible platform in the beginning and said let there be and there was he did that by faith he spoke it by faith that same God now is in you believeth his own word taking your mouth and speaking his words of life it's already done I am healed I am saved I am going to make it why it's God believing his own word in you it's not God in heaven believing it deity is not in heaven deity is in you and he believes it is finished he believes can you say amen God in you looking at the sacrifice and saying it's it's perfect it's right it's over withall amen believing in the finished work if the musicians will come and any Minister that has God in him will point the people to the finished work of Calvary for that's the job of every Minister that's the job of every parent that's the job of everyone that we testify to that does the testifying is pointing them the people to a finished work can you say Amen so many ministers have tried to make a name for themselves or they have pointed the people to something that isn't the real gospel amen they they they they you know they brother Bram you hear Brother Bram talking about they've had old running out of their hands and and blood and and and all of these things I I like what brother Bram said he said if God wanted you to pour out oil he had made you a Texas oil well or an olive tree or something but he made you a human being to preach the gospel and to bring the message to the people of the Salvation of the finished work of Jesus Christ it isn't to glorify us it isn't to build our own kingdom it isn't to establish our name in this life it is to point the people's Faith to a finished work of Calvary and to let them know it is finished it's done you don't have to worry you don't have to fear here you don't have to beg just accept what God has already done for you brother Braham says I believe that all the healing that was ever done or would be done was completed at Calvary he was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were past tense already healed at Calvary now the only thing that I can do or any other minister could do would be to preach the word or do something in the way that would cause you to have faith in the finished works of the Lord Jesus at Calvary that your faith has already purchased can you say amen I I know i' I've got to go but here he says in another place I find out that one of the greatest hindrances that the church has got today is that they're scared to death
