[46:19] and listen to brother
[46:21] brandham
[46:23] um sometime this morning and and um he's
[46:28] talking about you know the the the rod
[46:30] of
[46:31] Aaron he said that represented the the
[46:35] center how we were all cut off from the
[46:38] life of God but then we were able to
[46:41] come into His presence amen
[46:44] and as that Rod began to Bud it didn't
[46:49] Bud bring forth anything than what it
[46:52] was in its original
[46:54] state and I thought you know how
[46:56] wonderful that is is when the presence
[46:58] of God we come into the presence of God
[47:01] we don't bring forth anything else but
[47:04] what God originally predestinated us to
[47:07] be and what a change that is from this
[47:10] old life it's it's truly a change and
[47:13] I'm so glad for that you love the Lord
[47:16] the musicians can be dismissed amen and
[47:20] uh um it's uh just good to have everyone
[47:24] in the house of the Lord and and um good
[47:27] to have sister Martha back amen with us
[47:29] and um uh glad she's recovering and and
[47:33] um uh we want to just continue to
[47:36] remember um sister Hannah and and
[47:39] brother Bob and U maybe there's others
[47:43] that are sick that I don't know about
[47:45] but um good to see sister um um um horn
[47:52] Alice amen good to have you back am man
[47:56] and uh that she's recovering and the
[47:59] sickness just going around everywhere
[48:01] and uh you know i' I've been fighting
[48:04] this uh I don't know what it is but um
[48:08] uh just anyways anyway but we're here uh
[48:14] pressing the battle and um brother
[48:16] Andrew asked me to to greet you all and
[48:20] he's ministering there brother Wayne's
[48:22] today and uh brother Amos and sister
[48:25] Lisa I believe are in Pennsylvania with
[48:27] family and so we um want to just
[48:31] remember them that the Lord give them
[48:33] safe travels back home and um praise the
[48:37] Lord uh you can be seated for just a
[48:40] moment I was planning to have service
[48:44] tonight um uh but I I had heard to the
[48:48] great B that brother Darren kener is
[48:49] going to be having a watch service
[48:52] tonight and uh I'm not sure if anyone
[48:56] else or any other churches I haven't
[48:58] really uh talked to anyone uh as far as
[49:02] if they're having watch night services
[49:04] we usually uh brother Charlie had them
[49:07] or brother Roy and so we would just go
[49:10] over there and uh participate uh support
[49:15] theirs so uh if you know of uh a service
[49:19] that someone is having um a watch Night
[49:22] Service and you want to be part of that
[49:24] and uh I'm sure uh they would appreciate
[49:29] you uh coming and uh uh there and and
[49:34] being part of that also I I want to to
[49:38] say that I appreciate um all those who
[49:41] have labored over the weekend uh to to
[49:46] to make this a change I'm sure it was a
[49:48] surprise to to you uh there but we trust
[49:53] that you like it and uh uh we uh it's
[49:58] been a few months back that
[50:01] um the trustees had talked to me about
[50:05] uh needing a nursery another Nursery we
[50:07] just ain't got a lot of room in the back
[50:10] and um we've got uh uh different ones uh
[50:15] you know children being born and uh so
[50:19] we've been needing to get something you
[50:21] know done so we weren't using the tape
[50:24] room in the back
[50:26] uh anymore so we had talked about uh
[50:30] changing all that there and uh so that
[50:34] we'd have a little bit more room uh for
[50:37] the the nursery and um of course that's
[50:40] been a few months back and
[50:43] hadn't just been setting and a lot of
[50:46] that was just because we didn't have the
[50:48] the funds uh to really uh to do what we
[50:52] wanted to do and so uh my daughter uh
[50:56] she told me she said Dad I'll I'll I'll
[50:59] pay to get all this done if if we needed
[51:02] to do it and uh so uh she bought some
[51:06] paint and began to do it and I uh do
[51:10] some painting and kind of clearing
[51:13] things out and um then the boys
[51:18] uh brother Josiah brother Daniel and
[51:22] brother
[51:23] Junior uh they said well we'll we'll pit
[51:27] you in and so uh I think they got him a
[51:30] door from Brother Sam I think and um
[51:34] they found
[51:35] some tile downstairs that we had left
[51:38] over uh that we'd use downstairs that
[51:42] flooring and so they began to put
[51:45] everything together brother Josiah
[51:47] bought all the lights uh here for the
[51:50] church and U I think they really look
[51:53] nice and um so uh they they they moved
[51:58] the door and they got all that together
[52:00] and and um uh so then they uh they heard
[52:07] me announce to you all that would' be
[52:09] that I'm wanting to do some
[52:11] changing and um
[52:15] so uh everyone pitched in um and uh
[52:20] Wednesday night after church we decided
[52:22] to uh to do some repay and and uh just a
[52:27] little bit of change and so anyways I
[52:30] certainly appreciate them uh doing that
[52:35] not just spending money because I think
[52:37] we've all uh they all spent put some
[52:40] money into it but they've also put their
[52:42] labor in time and uh so we certainly
[52:46] appreciate that and I I I do want to say
[52:49] that I
[52:51] again uh you as a church you all have
[52:55] uh uh been so willing and and have
[53:01] showed such a um a desire to uh to carry
[53:09] on I and I I'd say my my vision I feel
[53:12] like the Lord has given me uh even with
[53:16] our spring meetings and um we started
[53:20] out you know here at the church and um
[53:24] uh from the from the
[53:26] GetGo um uh you were willing to um help
[53:31] feed and and things like that and and uh
[53:35] then we just we just outgrew it we were
[53:37] putting people in the basement during
[53:39] our meetings and so the Lord just opened
[53:43] it up a way and brother John Sister Kim
[53:47] uh you know mentioned about Camp
[53:50] Christie and and that has opened up and
[53:52] you know we've now we've just
[53:55] uh wow you know we've really grown in in
[53:58] the meetings and I I think we had over a
[54:02] thousand people uh this past meeting in
[54:08] uh the Saturday night
[54:10] service and who would have ever thought
[54:13] that that we would be there I that's
[54:17] never what I in you know uh looked for
[54:20] we just I've always just had a desire a
[54:24] burden to bring people in fellowship and
[54:27] then to feed them as they came and uh
[54:30] just uh I I felt it to me it was just a
[54:33] small way of letting them know that we
[54:36] appreciate them for coming and and uh
[54:40] just something to do for the bride of
[54:43] Christ and um but but you have you know
[54:47] you have been willing to to participate
[54:50] and to help and and even as we have uh
[54:55] uh gotten um have have grown in in these
[55:00] things and uh you know uh God has given
[55:06] a lot of you the the the ability the
[55:09] knowhow the and the
[55:12] willingness uh to to want to carry this
[55:15] out and I I I want to say I thank you so
[55:18] much well I first come here uh which I
[55:21] guess was about 12 years ago um you know
[55:25] brother Mark and Brother
[55:27] Sam uh they they were the the big um
[55:32] main ones that done a lot of work around
[55:35] here uh man I I remember them both
[55:39] spending hours brother Mark used to uh
[55:43] he was in the closet there and we got
[55:45] him out of there and uh just a little
[55:49] old
[55:50] board uh sound board now we got one you
[55:53] know big and
[55:56] brother Mark uh put so much effort I
[55:58] mean kept that thing uh just SP and span
[56:02] so orderly and I hope these guys are
[56:05] doing the same continuing with
[56:08] that and uh but but a lot of times they
[56:13] they spent uh hours uh here during the
[56:17] night uh you know I they they work late
[56:21] late night sometimes and um
[56:25] and God has has blessed us with young
[56:29] men that are rising up that carry that
[56:32] same
[56:34] desire and
[56:36] um I certainly appreciate that
[56:38] appreciate just everyone just just God
[56:42] knows what he's doing
[56:45] and if he wants something to stay alive
[56:48] he'll keep it alive and he'll keep he'll
[56:51] keep
[56:52] people uh you know bring the help as we
[56:55] need them and things but I I certainly
[56:58] appreciate all the the labor and you
[57:03] know when we
[57:05] um
[57:07] um
[57:09] um when I first started doing the
[57:11] meetings here in January which is coming
[57:14] up next week um you know my goal was is
[57:19] to just to for our church we didn't even
[57:24] announce it for the first several years
[57:27] then people would hear about it and ask
[57:30] why they weren't invited or ask can they
[57:33] come things like that but my goal was is
[57:36] just for the church to where we wouldn't
[57:38] have
[57:39] to uh no no cooking no nothing like that
[57:44] you just come enjoy it and then we would
[57:49] and you know we have tried to keep that
[57:51] just because I want you all to
[57:55] enjoy uh en enjoy yourself here at the
[57:59] meeting but you know what it just it
[58:03] again it just goes to show uh that it's
[58:06] really in the heart of the people and
[58:09] and the type of people that we do have
[58:11] here at the
[58:12] church um you know again I've always I'm
[58:16] I I've always liked Fellowship I've I've
[58:18] always you know but again I've been
[58:21] pretty
[58:22] ridiculed pretty hard for put in meeting
[58:26] uh cooking after you know us cooking and
[58:29] uh one told his congregation you know
[58:32] that it's a shame that a pastor would do
[58:35] that and but I've I've never and he was
[58:39] referring to us but I've never um I've
[58:43] never tried to demand that to be I've
[58:46] always just if you don't want to do it
[58:48] then don't do it if you do want to then
[58:51] we'd love to have you but I um Brother
[58:56] Sam I think it was last year opened his
[58:59] his uh the barn up for for the visitors
[59:03] uh to come and and and and people just
[59:06] so appreciated it you know and even
[59:09] though I you know uh my my goal was not
[59:13] to do any of that but yet cuz I didn't
[59:15] want you all to feel burdened to do it
[59:18] like you had to do it or that I was
[59:20] asking or expecting you all to do it but
[59:23] and I appreciate Brother Sam opening
[59:25] that just shows brother Sam's heart to
[59:29] to want to just help people and that's
[59:31] just been Brother Sam all through the
[59:33] years that I've known him is to want to
[59:36] help people and um and then you know uh
[59:41] a couple sisters um you know uh you know
[59:46] and I hope it's okay to mention your
[59:48] name but sister hope uh you know ask
[59:52] well can we do that again this year you
[59:54] know and um and uh so you know I of
[59:58] course I made it just very clear now you
[1:00:01] don't have to do this don't feel
[1:00:03] obligated this is just you know cuz I've
[1:00:06] already put it on the flly no food we
[1:00:08] ain't cooking but uh but then I I tell
[1:00:12] you know but I told her you know if if
[1:00:14] that is something that you all want to
[1:00:15] do then you know who am I to tell you
[1:00:18] not to do it uh cuz I always know it's
[1:00:20] going to be a blessing you know uh to
[1:00:23] those that do come and um so again I I I
[1:00:29] want to thank just all of you all for
[1:00:33] for your support what you know just just
[1:00:37] coming to the house of the Lord and
[1:00:39] being a part in that way or what
[1:00:42] whatever you know you God has called you
[1:00:45] to do thank you thank you so much um
[1:00:49] because you know
[1:00:53] um I um you know I
[1:00:57] just well just thank you so much you
[1:01:00] know God God knows what we need and he
[1:01:03] sends the right people
[1:01:05] along and um I think we all got a part
[1:01:08] in this um and uh sure wouldn't be uh
[1:01:14] preaching to pews wouldn't be a good way
[1:01:15] to do it huh that'd really be
[1:01:18] discouraging uh so God brings the people
[1:01:21] but also people that want to help people
[1:01:23] that want to put their labor in in any
[1:01:27] in in any way and uh so God bless you
[1:01:31] very much and if it's just just coming
[1:01:34] to the church coming to the house of God
[1:01:36] saying Amen to the word uh that that
[1:01:40] that is so much you you everyone has
[1:01:43] their part in in this thing and so God
[1:01:47] bless you very much and looking forward
[1:01:50] to the meetings that are
[1:01:52] coming uh I guess it' be next week
[1:01:56] Monday next Monday and um looking for
[1:01:59] what God's got in store uh for us all
[1:02:03] and um I'm believing God's going to do
[1:02:05] great things amen and so um if you'd
[1:02:10] like to stand with me we're going to to
[1:02:14] read here in first
[1:02:16] Thessalonians the um the fourth chapter
[1:02:21] it's a it's a scripture that we we're
[1:02:24] very familiar
[1:02:49] with
[1:02:53] and
[1:02:55] we'll start at the 13th verse 1
[1:02:57] Thessalonians
[1:02:59] 4 and
[1:03:03] 13 but I would not have you to be
[1:03:05] ignorant Brethren concerning them which
[1:03:08] are asleep that you sorrow
[1:03:10] not even as others which have no hope
[1:03:14] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[1:03:16] rose again even so them also which sleep
[1:03:21] in Jesus will God bring with them
[1:03:25] with
[1:03:26] him for this we say unto you by the word
[1:03:29] of the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:03:32] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:03:34] not prevent them which are asleep for
[1:03:37] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:03:40] heaven with the shout and with the voice
[1:03:42] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[1:03:44] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:03:46] first then we which are alive and remain
[1:03:49] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:03:51] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:03:54] and so shall we ever be with the
[1:03:57] Lord wherefore Comfort one another with
[1:04:02] these words amen let's just bow our
[1:04:06] heads we talk to our Lord
[1:04:09] father truly we are honored that you
[1:04:14] would bid us to come today to your house
[1:04:18] to meet with
[1:04:19] you father we realize that we're not
[1:04:22] just a normal Gathering
[1:04:25] that Lord we it's a gathering of your
[1:04:28] children your redeemed your elect
[1:04:31] father Lord and you thought of us Lord
[1:04:36] more valuable than your own
[1:04:38] blood and oh God as we sit here under
[1:04:44] great
[1:04:45] anticipation Lord for you to speak to us
[1:04:49] I pray that you would just anoint us all
[1:04:51] help me to get myself out of the way and
[1:04:53] Lord may you be able to speak through me
[1:04:56] Father anoint the gift that you placed
[1:04:58] in my life Lord and anoint that word
[1:05:01] seed within each and every heart Lord
[1:05:04] father we give this service now into
[1:05:06] your hands in Jesus Christ's name and
[1:05:10] the church
[1:05:11] says amen amen you can have your
[1:05:18] seats you know we're at the closing of
[1:05:21] another year time is just rapidly wow
[1:05:26] rapidly
[1:05:28] uh uh passing uh brother Ward uh text me
[1:05:34] in the office and he's he's up there
[1:05:37] preaching for brother Mike walls today
[1:05:40] and but he said you know it's been 18
[1:05:42] years uh he said I remembered just
[1:05:45] sitting here been 18 years uh New Year's
[1:05:50] Eve that he was preaching a meeting here
[1:05:52] I guess and got a called that his mom
[1:05:55] was passing so he left the meeting and
[1:05:59] and um his mom had already passed the
[1:06:02] time he got there but you know he said
[1:06:05] how time just goes and that's true time
[1:06:08] just just flies and who who would have
[1:06:11] ever thought that we'd be here at 20
[1:06:13] facing
[1:06:15] 2024 but it it it it just just time goes
[1:06:19] and uh but with with that each closing
[1:06:23] year here it brings us closer to the
[1:06:27] coming of the Lord it brings us closer
[1:06:30] to the Rapture and of course we know the
[1:06:32] word rapture is is to be caught up it
[1:06:36] that that's what it is and brother
[1:06:38] brandham was very clear that there is
[1:06:40] going to be a
[1:06:42] Rapture and uh he taught that in the
[1:06:45] message the Rapture uh 65 uh brother
[1:06:48] brandham said all Christians uh believe
[1:06:52] that there will be a r Rapture so all
[1:06:55] Christians if you're a Christian you're
[1:06:56] going to believe that there's going to
[1:06:58] be a Rapture and he said how many in
[1:07:01] here believes at the Bible teaches there
[1:07:03] will be a Rapture of the church he said
[1:07:05] yes sir that's right exactly a catching
[1:07:09] away of the
[1:07:11] church he said this Rapture that we're
[1:07:13] talking about is only for the bride
[1:07:17] remember the Bible says and the rest of
[1:07:19] the Dead live not for a thousand years
[1:07:22] see this great rapture
[1:07:24] if there's not a Rapture friends then
[1:07:27] where are we at where what are we going
[1:07:30] to do what age are we living in what
[1:07:33] promise do we have but there is going to
[1:07:36] be a Rapture the Bible says there will
[1:07:39] be and it'll only be for the elected the
[1:07:42] elected lady the bride in this day
[1:07:45] that's pulled out the church ain't that
[1:07:47] right now he preached that um after he
[1:07:51] preached that message the Raptor he had
[1:07:53] four more sermons to preach uh before
[1:07:56] the Lord took him home and so he
[1:07:59] preached the Rapture then the next night
[1:08:01] he preached on the subject things that
[1:08:03] are to be and he said now speaking last
[1:08:06] night on The Rapture so tonight I want
[1:08:08] to speak on this subject that we might I
[1:08:11] might tie it together with last night's
[1:08:14] message now there's going to be a
[1:08:17] rapture we know that that's in the
[1:08:19] future to be now Jesus is here speaking
[1:08:23] about he's gone ahead to prepare a place
[1:08:26] for us and that's important he's tying
[1:08:29] that that scripture to the Rapture he's
[1:08:31] gone to prepare a place for us and then
[1:08:35] on down he in that sermon the things
[1:08:38] that are to be he says now he Jesus said
[1:08:42] when you see my life ending it's ending
[1:08:45] for a purpose and I'm going away to
[1:08:48] prepare a place for you that where I am
[1:08:51] there you may be also so that's what
[1:08:54] this Rapture is about is that where he
[1:08:56] is that we could be there with him also
[1:08:59] and it's it's not that we're going to
[1:09:02] see Jesus as a as a Halo there I believe
[1:09:05] we're going to see him in his physical
[1:09:07] body amen I know some teach that that
[1:09:11] that body is done away with but that's
[1:09:13] not true amen uh it's it's a glorified
[1:09:16] body it's an eternal body and if it's an
[1:09:18] eternal body and and you say well how do
[1:09:21] you know that because the Bible says
[1:09:22] that our bodies will change like un his
[1:09:24] own glorious body so so there is no
[1:09:28] corruption with his body and there will
[1:09:30] be no corruption with our body and so
[1:09:32] we're not going to see a Halo We're
[1:09:34] going to see him in his body and he says
[1:09:38] I go away I'm going away to prepare a
[1:09:41] place for you that where I am you may be
[1:09:44] there also see so Jesus is telling his
[1:09:47] disciples that this life is not ended in
[1:09:50] death amen see he says because I go and
[1:09:55] prepare a place see that is to receive
[1:09:58] them see shows that there uh he was
[1:10:01] speaking to them that there was a life
[1:10:04] after this life is ended and and and and
[1:10:08] and we we we know by our scripture
[1:10:10] reading that this life is not only
[1:10:13] ending uh when you die amen but there is
[1:10:16] going to be a people that will never die
[1:10:18] and this life will end for them and they
[1:10:21] will enter into another life can you
[1:10:23] amen so after this life is over there is
[1:10:27] a life that we go into so as you get
[1:10:29] older that becomes more of a reality to
[1:10:33] you see every year it it should becoming
[1:10:36] a more of a reality to us that there is
[1:10:39] another life there this life cannot
[1:10:41] continue I thinking of uh uh my my wife
[1:10:45] you know she was doing stuff on the
[1:10:47] floor and uh last night and and she was
[1:10:49] there for a while and and uh uh uh you
[1:10:53] know maybe had had her legs crossed or
[1:10:54] whatever and set in Indian style as we
[1:10:57] would say that and and uh but I had to
[1:10:59] help her up she say I'm just getting too
[1:11:01] old I you know I can't do this much more
[1:11:04] you know and I'm thinking old you know
[1:11:06] uh but but you know it just tells us
[1:11:09] that life life is is we we start feeling
[1:11:12] things that maybe we didn't feel and
[1:11:15] experiencing things that we didn't feel
[1:11:17] when we were 15 16 18 years old you
[1:11:20] don't understand what I'm saying and and
[1:11:22] so then it lets us know
[1:11:24] that that we we start looking after for
[1:11:26] another life what what's going to happen
[1:11:28] to us you know what I'm saying and and
[1:11:31] and you know I that's becoming more
[1:11:33] clear to me or more of a thought is is I
[1:11:36] ain't got much time left uh you know it
[1:11:39] could be an accident it could be some
[1:11:42] you know it could be a health problem it
[1:11:44] could be just whatever but but if all of
[1:11:46] us really think about it there's no age
[1:11:49] limit amen that God takes people home
[1:11:52] and and when you're number called that's
[1:11:54] it ain't that right so every day we
[1:11:57] should be thinking of that life
[1:11:59] thereafter and and uh the the life
[1:12:02] thereafter you can have plans but uh uh
[1:12:04] in this life and them plans can just
[1:12:06] stop automatically and and be totally uh
[1:12:10] uh uh uh you know disrupted but he says
[1:12:13] see you begin to uh as you begin to see
[1:12:16] your your days uh your life see drawing
[1:12:19] close then you begin to pack up closer
[1:12:22] getting ready for that great event it's
[1:12:25] a continuing of this same life in
[1:12:28] another world another place can you say
[1:12:31] Amen so you'll be in a body and and and
[1:12:35] and but you'll be in another world it's
[1:12:37] it's another place that's what the
[1:12:39] Rapture is about so so he he talks that
[1:12:43] in in in in the things that are to be
[1:12:45] but the next n uh uh uh uh brother
[1:12:48] Brandon preached on the subject modern
[1:12:50] events are made clear by prophecy and
[1:12:53] and you ought to go listen to the five
[1:12:55] sermons uh back to back just uh uh he's
[1:12:58] getting ready to leave and and and in
[1:13:00] them sermons he preaches Jean seed he
[1:13:03] mentions that more than he ever did in
[1:13:05] in any other tape uh uh uh of his of his
[1:13:08] life is Jean seeds and and he's he's
[1:13:11] preparing the people he's telling us
[1:13:13] there's something else he's got
[1:13:15] something to say in other words you know
[1:13:17] and so he preaches modern events made
[1:13:19] clear by prophecy he says we're not
[1:13:21] living in a Pentecostal AG we're living
[1:13:24] in another age we're not living in a
[1:13:26] Methodist age we're not living He said
[1:13:28] we're living in another age we're living
[1:13:31] on up here to the bright age the calling
[1:13:34] out of the church and and if if I'm not
[1:13:37] mistaken he mentions bright age more in
[1:13:40] them five sermons than he ever did in in
[1:13:43] in in the uh his other time uh we're
[1:13:46] living up here to the bride age the
[1:13:48] calling out of the church getting it
[1:13:51] together for the rapture
[1:13:54] that's the age we're now living getting
[1:13:57] get ready for the Rapture so he has come
[1:14:01] to understand his purpose and his uh uh
[1:14:04] for his ministry of being on this Earth
[1:14:07] and he's telling us now amen and and if
[1:14:10] I could say it this way amen it it it
[1:14:13] his he didn't want us get caught up in
[1:14:16] in in in in making Souvenirs of his
[1:14:19] suitcase and his belt buckle and his
[1:14:22] whatever and and and then we've arrived
[1:14:24] because our children now have all of
[1:14:27] these things and and and who cares about
[1:14:29] a belt buckle that he had and who care
[1:14:32] you know I and and don't get me wrong I
[1:14:34] I I love going and visiting the places
[1:14:36] that he was at and and them things but
[1:14:39] but that doesn't that that's fine but
[1:14:42] but that's not why he came so that I
[1:14:44] could go and touch his Tombstone and I
[1:14:46] could touch this and and and take some
[1:14:49] dirt home and and all that that that has
[1:14:51] no bearing amen but because he come to
[1:14:55] get us together for a Rapture amen this
[1:14:59] thing is winding up this thing is coming
[1:15:01] to a close can you sayen so the Rapture
[1:15:04] isn't a a a a metaphor a figure of
[1:15:07] speech it's a it's a real happening see
[1:15:11] Jesus said in John 5 and2 the hour is
[1:15:14] coming and now is when the dead shall
[1:15:17] hear the voice of the Son of God and
[1:15:20] they that hear shall live amen see the
[1:15:24] hour is coming and and now is that the
[1:15:27] dead is going to hear the voice of the
[1:15:30] Lord amen see well when he died and he
[1:15:34] rose again there was the the Old
[1:15:36] Testament saints that had waited upon
[1:15:38] Him believed upon him they rose with him
[1:15:42] amen see amen they heard the voice amen
[1:15:45] but here we are we're in a generation
[1:15:48] amen and that was just the dead amen but
[1:15:50] look at all the saints that that the
[1:15:52] disciples that followed him and they
[1:15:55] were never changed amen they just
[1:15:57] continued on in the natural life but in
[1:16:00] this age the cycle of Life of this
[1:16:03] mortality is going to be broken and not
[1:16:07] only the dead is going to raise but
[1:16:09] those that are alive and remaining are
[1:16:12] going to be changed and caught up to
[1:16:14] meet the Lord in the air amen see so uh
[1:16:18] the dead is going to hear the voice of
[1:16:21] the Lord a Son of God and shall live uh
[1:16:24] uh so so that's at the time of rapture
[1:16:27] amen see and and so it's going to break
[1:16:30] the cycle of death and corruption that's
[1:16:32] what the Rapture is about breaking the
[1:16:34] death of the cycle of death and
[1:16:37] Corruption and it's not just for one man
[1:16:40] amen not just for one man but it's for
[1:16:42] All Peoples of every out of every tongue
[1:16:45] and tribe and nation and Kindred ain't
[1:16:48] that right amen not just for Israel amen
[1:16:52] but out of every every tribe Kindred
[1:16:54] tongue and Nation there is going to be a
[1:16:58] Rapture that is going to take place it
[1:17:01] could be out in the very jungles where
[1:17:03] they don't know their ABCs but they'll
[1:17:04] be caught up with us Amen to meet the
[1:17:07] Lord in the air amen see so now one
[1:17:11] might think I I I had a brother tell me
[1:17:14] you know uh a couple years ago that that
[1:17:16] the Rapture is not a literal thing uh
[1:17:19] but it is actually being caught up in
[1:17:22] Revelation amen that that's what the
[1:17:24] Rapture is is being caught up but
[1:17:26] brother brandham didn't teach that at
[1:17:28] all now now uh uh now now notice brother
[1:17:31] Brown did say this he said to the church
[1:17:34] the bride the Rapture is a revelation to
[1:17:37] her amen see the Rapture is a revelation
[1:17:40] it's revealed to her see that the
[1:17:43] Revelation the true bride of Christ will
[1:17:45] be waiting for that revelation of the
[1:17:48] Rapture see now we've already got that
[1:17:50] revelation of the Rapture amen but now
[1:17:53] it is a revelation for the Revelation is
[1:17:56] Faith Can you say Amen you cannot have a
[1:18:00] revelation without it being Faith see
[1:18:02] faith is a revelation because it's
[1:18:05] something that's revealed to you ain't
[1:18:08] that right so so the Revelation gives
[1:18:11] Faith to the bride in order for her to
[1:18:14] be taken
[1:18:16] up ain't that right so the Revelation
[1:18:19] has got to come to you the revelation of
[1:18:21] this Rapture has got to come you amen
[1:18:24] see so brother brandom says see he says
[1:18:26] I want you to get built up now in these
[1:18:29] holy Oracles of God in the faith
[1:18:32] everybody say in the faith then he says
[1:18:35] the faith of this hour not the faith of
[1:18:38] Methodist not the faith of of of of the
[1:18:40] Pentecostals not the faith of Baptist
[1:18:43] not the faith of Lutheran and all that
[1:18:45] the faith of this hour can you say amen
[1:18:48] amen see so he says see it's going to
[1:18:51] take more faith a greater Faith than
[1:18:55] ever was in any age that's why you don't
[1:18:57] need to listen to theology amen those
[1:19:00] that don't they could be great speakers
[1:19:02] they could be great theologians
[1:19:04] philosophers and all of that but there's
[1:19:06] got to give a faith for this hour can
[1:19:10] you say amen and if God is going to
[1:19:12] require a greater Faith than ever before
[1:19:14] then surely he's going to give it to us
[1:19:17] surely he's going to provide some way
[1:19:19] that you can have that Faith so it's
[1:19:22] going to take more faith than it ever
[1:19:24] was in any age for this this has to be
[1:19:28] rapturing Faith to be taken up ain't
[1:19:31] that right see so the Revelation comes
[1:19:34] before the Rapture the revelation of the
[1:19:36] Rapture comes before the event amen see
[1:19:40] when the Holy Ghost he says comes and
[1:19:42] reveals the word and makes it live just
[1:19:45] exact then it's a revelation to you can
[1:19:49] you say Amen say that again when the
[1:19:51] Holy Ghost comes and reveals the word
[1:19:54] which he did by a prophet and makes it
[1:19:56] live just exactly and we know he did
[1:20:00] amen what other man could stand up
[1:20:02] outside of Jesus Christ and look at that
[1:20:04] and say this day this scripture is
[1:20:05] fulfilled and take scripture after
[1:20:08] scripture after scripture after
[1:20:09] scripture and not only can he do that
[1:20:11] this bride can do that yes sir amen see
[1:20:16] you it makes it live just exact then
[1:20:19] it's a revelation to you you see it it's
[1:20:22] un it its promise for the hour ain't
[1:20:26] that right see so the spirit Jesus told
[1:20:29] us that the spirit of Truth he would
[1:20:30] send the spirit of Truth amen and we
[1:20:33] know the spirit of Truth has comeing
[1:20:34] this day and has made the word known to
[1:20:37] us and is making it live just exactly
[1:20:41] what he said it would amen see then then
[1:20:46] it becomes a revelation and when it
[1:20:48] becomes a revelation then you can start
[1:20:52] walk Walken by
[1:20:54] faith can you say Amen when see because
[1:20:57] Faith doesn't come but by Revelation
[1:21:00] amen and when God reveals it amen he he
[1:21:03] Reveals His word he makes it he live
[1:21:06] just exactly the way he promised it it
[1:21:08] doesn't matter if the world accepts it
[1:21:10] or not amen God's word Still Remains the
[1:21:13] Same and it lives he makes it live just
[1:21:16] exactly the way he said it would live
[1:21:19] then it becomes a revelation can you say
[1:21:21] amen and the elect will see it see amen
[1:21:24] then it becomes a faith to us amen then
[1:21:27] you can start walking with God by faith
[1:21:30] Walking with God by faith can you can't
[1:21:32] walk with god without Revelation amen
[1:21:34] for the faith is the Revelation the
[1:21:36] Revelation is the faith that comes to
[1:21:39] you see amen that's right see amen then
[1:21:43] then you you now begin to fulfill what
[1:21:47] Enoch typed out for the Bible says he
[1:21:49] walked with God he walked with God God
[1:21:53] did he walk by feelings no did he walk
[1:21:55] by sensation no did he walk by
[1:21:57] theologians no did he walk by what he
[1:21:59] thought it should be no he walked by
[1:22:02] faith it was a revelation to him how
[1:22:05] else did he build that pyramid amen as
[1:22:07] brother Wayne brought to us last year I
[1:22:09] believe it was this around this time
[1:22:11] amen and what a revelation that Enoch
[1:22:14] had of the whole church and the coming
[1:22:17] and and all of these things had it a
[1:22:19] revelation of this day and he began to
[1:22:22] walk with God by faith and it took him
[1:22:26] home and that was only a type amen that
[1:22:30] he was the type of us can you say amen
[1:22:33] amen see Amen brother Brown said his
[1:22:35] whole body was transformed to meet a
[1:22:38] type in God and he was taken to heaven
[1:22:41] without even seeing death now you're
[1:22:44] that people sitting here in this in this
[1:22:46] building there's people all in this
[1:22:48] around this world Amen that Enoch typed
[1:22:51] for this age didn't type any other
[1:22:53] people but this age Enoch was the
[1:22:56] seventh from Noah which was a type of
[1:22:58] the church ages and all he said now all
[1:23:01] the rest of the six men before him died
[1:23:04] but Enoch was translated Enoch was
[1:23:06] raptured the seventh showing that it's
[1:23:08] the seventh Church age that takes the
[1:23:11] Rapture can you say Amen another place
[1:23:13] there's no doubt that we're in the
[1:23:15] seventh Church age we all know it why
[1:23:18] it's been revealed to us it's been
[1:23:21] revealed the re has come to
[1:23:24] us can you say Amen we're we're not in
[1:23:27] we're not waiting for an eighth day
[1:23:29] messenger we're not waiting for another
[1:23:30] Prophet to come amen it's been revealed
[1:23:33] to
[1:23:35] us we're living in the seventh Church
[1:23:38] age amen we all know it see it's the
[1:23:41] seventh Church age that takes the
[1:23:44] Rapture amen he says the end time bride
[1:23:47] will be called out of the rapturing or
[1:23:50] called out he said the rapturing without
[1:23:52] death will be called out of the seventh
[1:23:54] Church age see we we which we are now
[1:23:58] bearing record of that age can you say
[1:24:01] Amen we know it not because some some
[1:24:04] teacher come and told us but the word
[1:24:06] was revealed to us and the spirit of God
[1:24:08] made it live now it's a revelation we're
[1:24:11] not in the first church age we're not in
[1:24:13] the sixth Church age we're not in I had
[1:24:15] one you know brother a man tell me years
[1:24:17] ago oh no no I was trying to tell him
[1:24:19] about this I just come in the message
[1:24:21] I'm trying to tell him about that were
[1:24:23] you know uh uh uh in the seventh Church
[1:24:25] age and all he said we're not in the
[1:24:27] seventh Church age we're in the sixth
[1:24:29] you know and and and I don't know if he
[1:24:31] just was mocking or what I don't know uh
[1:24:33] I was pretty young you know uh about it
[1:24:35] but I was excited telling everybody man
[1:24:37] we're ready man for this Rapture you
[1:24:39] know and but but now we we're not
[1:24:41] guessing about it we're not taking some
[1:24:43] man's word the word has been revealed
[1:24:47] and it's made now living and now we've
[1:24:50] got the revelation we are that seventh
[1:24:52] age people we are that rapturing people
[1:24:55] we are there is no other time amen I so
[1:24:58] that's why all these other doctrines
[1:25:00] don't move me that's why all these moves
[1:25:02] don't move me all these these things
[1:25:04] that the world's getting and the
[1:25:05] churches are having and it doesn't move
[1:25:08] me I'm not looking for the prosperity of
[1:25:10] America I'm looking for home it's a
[1:25:13] revelation to
[1:25:15] me yes sir Glory so now the Rapture
[1:25:21] involves being change from Mortal to
[1:25:24] immortality that's what the Rapture
[1:25:26] involves in now see because he says here
[1:25:29] Paul 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show
[1:25:33] you a mystery we shall not all sleep but
[1:25:35] we shall all everybody say we shall all
[1:25:38] be changed we shall all be changed see
[1:25:42] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:25:44] we're not all going to sleep we're not
[1:25:45] all going to go by the way of the grave
[1:25:47] but we all have a promise we're going to
[1:25:49] be changed amen so this WAP rure is is
[1:25:53] including uh uh uh both dead and living
[1:25:57] we're all going to be changed in a
[1:25:59] moment in the twinkling of an eye at the
[1:26:01] last Trump not not president Trump
[1:26:03] either see at the last Trump for the
[1:26:06] Trump shall uh sound amen and the dead
[1:26:09] shall be raised Incorruptible and we
[1:26:12] shall be changed for this corruptible
[1:26:15] must put on incorruption Amen and this
[1:26:17] Mortal must put on immortality so when
[1:26:20] this corruptible shall have put on
[1:26:22] corruption and this Mortal shall have
[1:26:23] put on immortality then shall be brought
[1:26:26] to pass the saying the scripture the
[1:26:29] prophecy that is written death is
[1:26:32] swallowed up in Victory No More Death to
[1:26:36] contend with no more corruption to
[1:26:38] contend with no more agonizing to
[1:26:41] contend with we're going to be changed
[1:26:43] that's what this Rapture is all about
[1:26:45] you can be caught up in Revelation and
[1:26:47] still have heartaches and still have
[1:26:49] agonize and and still shed your tears
[1:26:52] and and still go through the hell and

[1:30:24] says that this Rapture is going to take
[1:30:26] place between 600 and 9 ain't that right
[1:30:29] so it's not just about getting caught up
[1:30:31] in Revelation this is a real
[1:30:35] event yes sir 6 and N some morning he
[1:30:38] says see so and and a people who truly
[1:30:41] believe this message amen and and and
[1:30:44] are following it we believe exactly what
[1:30:46] brother Ram said about it amen that's
[1:30:49] right amen see brother Bram did not
[1:30:51] change that his latter I mean he's
[1:30:53] talking all the way up uh uh the the

[1:30:59] sermons of his life he's talking about a
[1:31:02] Rapture he's talking about a literal
[1:31:04] Rapture he ain't now if if if if all of
[1:31:07] a sudden God has changed that that that
[1:31:09] thought amen that now it's just going to
[1:31:11] be caught up in Revelation and it's just
[1:31:13] going to be some other way then then
[1:31:15] surely God wouldn't have a prophet that
[1:31:17] is supposed to get us ready for whatever
[1:31:20] Amen to preach the last sermons of his
[1:31:22] life about a Rapture and he ain't got
[1:31:25] time to change what he said no it's
[1:31:27] preachers that change what he says it's
[1:31:29] these Scholars that change what he said
[1:31:31] it's the doubters that change what he
[1:31:33] says but there is going to be a Rapture
[1:31:36] amen and we must be looking forward to
[1:31:39] it ain't that right Amen brother R said
[1:31:42] you see these little pockets going

[1:31:49] up missing you say they don't hear he
[1:31:51] from them they're standing there and
[1:31:53] then they're not that's the way the
[1:31:55] Rapture is going to be one of them will
[1:31:57] drop right down and this T terestrial
[1:32:00] body would take on a Celestial body and
[1:32:03] there will be no hide or hair or bones
[1:32:05] left it'll be transformed in a moment of
[1:32:07] time dropping right out of space and

[1:37:11] one will be going here or down there and
[1:37:14] the first thing you know they're not
[1:37:19] there now you know what brother Brandon
[1:37:22] called The Rapture he actually called it
[1:37:24] the titled the message a sudden going
[1:37:27] away of the
[1:37:29] church that's what the Rapture is going
[1:37:31] to be that's what he called it a sudden
[1:37:33] going away of the church ain't that
[1:37:36] right so I looked up what sudden it it's
[1:37:39] marked by an abruptness you got plans to
[1:37:42] do something you got you you you got
[1:37:44] your whole life scheduled out you got
[1:37:46] your whole day scheduled out amen you
[1:37:48] you you may be going on a vacation you
[1:37:50] may be meeting
[1:37:51] you uh other people at for the coffee
[1:37:53] shop or to go have lunch or whatever and
[1:37:56] all of a sudden they Su in
[1:37:58] abruptness amen and not just your plans
[1:38:01] but life life Trials come to sudden
[1:38:07] abruptness everything that you've gone
[1:38:09] through whether it's it's in your health
[1:38:12] whether it's in your mind whether it's
[1:38:14] whatever it is it all comes to a sudden
[1:38:16] abruptness see sudden is marked by an
[1:38:20] abruptness H or an unexpected occurrence
[1:38:25] unanticipated right see so then that
[1:38:28] tells us that the sudden going away of
[1:38:30] the church does not the suddenness is
[1:38:34] not does not happen to the bride in
[1:38:36] other words it it's not the bride that
[1:38:39] is left un un un unguarded or caught by
[1:38:43] surprise it it's not the bride that that
[1:38:47] it happens unexpected to she's already
[1:38:50] had the Revel
[1:38:51] she knows that this is rapturing G she's
[1:38:55] looking for the Rapture she's preparing
[1:38:59] this is what her life was is preparing
[1:39:02] for the I understand we got to work I
[1:39:05] understand we got family I understand
[1:39:07] we've got obligation but the Rapture is
[1:39:09] our first priority we're leaving here it
[1:39:13] could be today it could be tomorrow it
[1:39:15] could be any second that's how close we
[1:39:18] are brother brandham said it's later
[1:39:20] than you think it's later than you think
[1:39:23] can you say Amen when you think it might
[1:39:25] happen in a minute it's later than
[1:39:30] that it's later can you say Amen so it's
[1:39:34] not going to be a sudden thing to the
[1:39:35] bride because she has been expecting
[1:39:37] this to happen she's been preparing for
[1:39:40] this to happen she's been unloading for
[1:39:43] this to
[1:39:44] happen Hallelujah can you say amen

[1:45:18] this I got to do that I got to make my
[1:45:20] dresses a little little long and I don't
[1:45:23] you know and and usually when people are
[1:45:25] like that then they want to see how far
[1:45:26] they can get away with what they can get
[1:45:28] away with you know what I'm saying we we
[1:45:30] were in it I mean we were in the
[1:45:32] Apostolic Pentecostal and women you know
[1:45:34] the women would trim their bins it's
[1:45:36] just enough so the preacher won't preach
[1:45:37] against there just enough people won't
[1:45:39] it's Same Spirit just cut it off shave
[1:45:41] him you understand what I'm saying or or
[1:45:44] they try to get along see they try to
[1:45:46] get as far as they could go see and you
[1:45:48] know and or if someone's got the desire
[1:45:50] wear high heels and they want to know
[1:45:52] how much they can get away with before
[1:45:53] it starts becoming illegal you you know
[1:45:56] what I'm saying but for us none of that
[1:45:59] matters anymore we our names been
[1:46:02] written in the book something else is
[1:46:04] calling me the preacher didn't call me
[1:46:06] Mama didn't call me daddy didn't call me
[1:46:08] amen you didn't call me I didn't call
[1:46:11] you something is pulling me
[1:46:14] home something's pulling me why it's
[1:46:17] Rapture time it's the time that
[1:46:20] Redemption is now made known the lamb
[1:46:22] has come to redeem those he has
[1:46:30] purchased remember the eaglet in the
[1:46:32] chicken yard brother Brown uses that a
[1:46:34] lot oh yes well there's a reason he's
[1:46:36] using that right Parable that little
[1:46:40] eaglet heard the scream of Mama and
[1:46:43] realized all of a sudden something was
[1:46:45] different see he couldn't find his
[1:46:47] identity in the chicken yard couldn't
[1:46:49] find it in the the trucks couldn't find
[1:46:51] it in the hunting couldn't find it in
[1:46:52] the girls and the boys couldn't find it
[1:46:55] in the church he couldn't find it in the
[1:46:58] seminaries he couldn't find it in the
[1:47:01] concerts he just couldn't find it I mean
[1:47:03] he searched it in the bars he find I
[1:47:05] mean you can search in the bars you can
[1:47:06] search it in the churches it's just
[1:47:08] about as bad as the B as as either
[1:47:11] one and and you're searching everywhere
[1:47:14] right he search and he couldn't find his
[1:47:18] identity everything was too
[1:47:21] Earthly he went all around in the Earth
[1:47:23] or in that chicken yard
[1:47:25] Earth and he couldn't find something
[1:47:27] something was wrong something was
[1:47:29] different but he heard something from
[1:47:32] above the voice from above that was not
[1:47:37] Earthly amen looked it up looked up
[1:47:40] there and he found his identity he was
[1:47:44] looking as though he was in a
[1:47:48] mirror amen
[1:47:51] see so we find amen that that you know
[1:47:54] the prophet of church didn't have that
[1:47:55] satisfying something the world didn't
[1:47:57] have that satisfying something but you
[1:48:00] heard something else that was a
[1:48:03] scream ain't that right well Matthew 25
[1:48:08] calls it the voice of a
[1:48:11] bridegroom can you say Amen yes sir see
[1:48:15] he said you realize that you were born
[1:48:18] for that right you realize that when you
[1:48:22] heard the scream you realize you were
[1:48:25] born for that you were born for this
[1:48:29] message Hallelujah ain't that right
[1:48:32] you're part of it you fit into it like a
[1:48:35] glove on a hand you fit in this message
[1:48:39] the message fits you you fit this
[1:48:42] message it's like hand and gloves
[1:48:47] am amen you see birds of of a Feather
[1:48:50] they flock together because they have
[1:48:52] something in common Lord Brother Bram
[1:48:55] said birds and doves has nothing in
[1:48:57] common their diet is different although
[1:48:59] a dove could be hatched under a buzzard
[1:49:02] that's right depends on what it was to
[1:49:03] begin
[1:49:05] with now in that see though the dove
[1:49:08] might have to be mothered a while by
[1:49:11] that by that Buzzard but finally he'll
[1:49:13] find his
[1:49:15] mate right right we might maybe there's
[1:49:18] some of us here that was Mother by a
[1:49:25] buzzard denominational
[1:49:28] Buzzard oh yeah that's
[1:49:32] okay but then you had to find your
[1:49:39] mate he said see that's what the church
[1:49:41] is doing today for Jesus is the word and
[1:49:43] he is the bridegroom and the bride is
[1:49:45] part of the groom right therefore the
[1:49:49] word that is is to be filled fulfilled
[1:49:52] this day is the same part of the word
[1:49:54] that was fulfilled in his day it's the
[1:49:57] same word same experience same life all
[1:50:01] right that's why this message is
[1:50:03] appealing to
[1:50:04] us yes it's the same Lord
[1:50:09] Jesus right
[1:50:12] am
[1:50:13] am so that's the ones that's going to be
[1:50:15] in the
[1:50:16] Rapture remember Adam was both masculine
[1:50:19] and feminine Spirit male and female
[1:50:24] because he was Spirit man before he came
[1:50:27] into a body amen then when he become
[1:50:30] flesh man animal Flesh on
[1:50:33] Earth he is showing portraying here the
[1:50:36] bride see God never took and made
[1:50:39] another being but he took part of Adam
[1:50:42] the original creation took from him a
[1:50:44] rib from his side took the feminine
[1:50:47] Spirit out of Adam left the masculine
[1:50:49] spirit in there and placed it in the
[1:50:51] feminist part therefore part of his
[1:50:54] Spirit part of his body part of Flesh of
[1:50:56] his flesh bone of his bone word of his
[1:50:58] word life of his life and that's the way
[1:51:00] the bride is to Christ that's why the
[1:51:03] Rapture of the r seed has to come first
[1:51:06] see the argument decades long argument
[1:51:09] centuries long argument is that the
[1:51:11] bride has to go through the tribulation
[1:51:13] first but this brother brond is
[1:51:15] explaining this this is why the Rapture
[1:51:18] has to go first before
[1:51:22] tribulation right see the rest of the
[1:51:25] Dead live not for a thousand years and
[1:51:28] they're brought up at the white Throne
[1:51:30] judgment and remember brother BR said we
[1:51:32] do not want to be at that th white
[1:51:34] Throne judgment he said flame me alive
[1:51:36] cut me piece by piece inch by inch and
[1:51:39] tear me apart do whatever you can but
[1:51:41] don't let me stay at the stand before
[1:51:43] the white Throne judgment then at that
[1:51:46] time there's no
[1:51:47] mercy ain't that right amen see the rest
[1:51:50] of the Dead going to live not for a
[1:51:52] thousand years they're going to be at
[1:51:53] the white Throne judgment but there is
[1:51:55] no judgment to the roll seat or the
[1:51:58] predestinated Seed of Abraham because
[1:52:00] you're part of
[1:52:02] him are you with me now see you're part
[1:52:06] of him and how do you know you're part
[1:52:08] of him the scream of mama has come the
[1:52:12] eagle scream has come and you no longer
[1:52:15] kept wandering around in the barnyard
[1:52:17] amen trying to cluck and trying to
[1:52:19] practice here you're scratching and all
[1:52:21] that the scream caught your attention
[1:52:23] and before you know it you're trying to
[1:52:26] fly amen you're trying to now you found
[1:52:29] another identity so you can say oh you
[1:52:31] can't fly oh yes I can fly that voice is
[1:52:33] telling me I can fly that voice is
[1:52:35] telling me it's time to come up the
[1:52:37] voice is telling me it's Rapture time
[1:52:39] the voice is telling me it's time to
[1:52:41] change your environment change your
[1:52:43] condition change the
[1:52:47] atmosphere and you respond to the voice
[1:52:49] HJ you get your nose out of the
[1:52:52] television and you respond to the voice
[1:52:54] you get your nose out of The Honky ton
[1:52:56] and you respond to the voice you get
[1:52:58] your nose out of the movie theaters and
[1:53:00] you respond to the voice you get your
[1:53:02] nose out of everything and out of
[1:53:04] people's business and all and you
[1:53:06] respond to that voice now you put your
[1:53:10] energy into Flying Like an
[1:53:13] Eagle
[1:53:16] Hallelujah yes sir
[1:53:18] why now you've known that you're part of
[1:53:20] his flesh of his flesh you're part of
[1:53:23] him word of his word life of his life
[1:53:25] yes sir you've heard the
[1:53:28] voice that's why the Rapture has to take
[1:53:31] place God will not leave you here I
[1:53:34] promise you the things that are had
[1:53:36] coming up on this Earth no man knows
[1:53:38] what's going to happen it it you can't
[1:53:41] even fathom what's going to happen after
[1:53:44] the bride is gone but God rich in Mercy
[1:53:47] has identified himself with you you and
[1:53:50] you could identify yourself with him and
[1:53:53] before that takes place amen before the
[1:53:56] tribulation and all hell breaks loose
[1:53:57] and Satan is actually able to have his
[1:54:00] way Amen on the earth like he has always
[1:54:02] wanted to amen God is going to snatch
[1:54:05] you out the only reason why Satan can't
[1:54:07] have his way in everything that he's
[1:54:09] doing you look at the corruption you
[1:54:10] look at the evil and the perverseness
[1:54:12] and all that amen and yet we think
[1:54:14] that's that's horrible and it is
[1:54:16] horrible but you can just imagine amen
[1:54:19] there's something there that is stopping
[1:54:21] him from going all the way with it is
[1:54:23] because there's a bride upon this Earth
[1:54:26] amen that God says oh no don't you touch
[1:54:28] it amen don't you do nothing yet can you
[1:54:30] say Amen you and I as the bride of
[1:54:33] Christ has got a protection around us
[1:54:36] amen you've got a protection and not
[1:54:38] only that you've got the authority to
[1:54:39] claim your children you've got the
[1:54:41] authority to claim your spouse you've
[1:54:43] got the authority God has given you that
[1:54:45] Authority upon this
[1:54:48] Earth
[1:54:51] good but before the wrath of God comes
[1:54:53] he's going to take you out here
[1:54:57] amen and his brother Brown said woe to
[1:54:59] them that are left behind
[1:55:02] then good
[1:55:06] amen so brother
[1:55:08] Bram I hope this all right this
[1:55:11] morning the Lord Brother Braham said
[1:55:12] don't get the Rapture of the church and
[1:55:14] the white Throne judgment mixed
[1:55:16] up because the Rapture of the church
[1:55:19] there is no judgment amen that's true
[1:55:23] there is no can you say amen amen
[1:55:25] another place it
[1:55:27] said the elected goes first in the
[1:55:29] Rapture because they cannot they cannot
[1:55:31] everybody say they cannot say it
[1:55:34] personally I
[1:55:35] cannot go in the Judgment that's amen
[1:55:40] the elect goes in the Rapture first
[1:55:42] because they cannot go into the Judgment
[1:55:46] you see there's a word concerning this
[1:55:49] John John 5:24 Jesus said verily verily
[1:55:51] I say unto you he that heareth my
[1:55:54] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:55:57] ha everlasting life and shall not come
[1:56:00] into condemnation he knew what the wrath
[1:56:03] of God was going to come he knew that it
[1:56:05] was going to be poured out he knew the
[1:56:06] darkness that that was coming upon the
[1:56:08] Earth but he left us a promise you will
[1:56:10] not go into into condemnation you will
[1:56:13] not be judged you will not face that
[1:56:16] that wrath you will not take this is why
[1:56:18] a prophet could say Shalom
[1:56:22] Church shall not come into condemnation
[1:56:25] but is passed from Death un life ain't
[1:56:27] that right so by God's grace we have
[1:56:30] been tied to the very thing that is
[1:56:32] going to take us
[1:56:33] out amen is bringing on this Rapture
[1:56:36] remember the prophet said the end time
[1:56:38] message is to get the bride ready and
[1:56:40] prepared for the Rapture see what what
[1:56:42] can it do according to Malachi 4 is to
[1:56:45] bring them back to the faith the faith
[1:56:48] now with that that and and and what What
[1:56:52] My Title was I didn't tell you was
[1:56:54] atmosphere for Rapture atmosphere for
[1:56:57] Rapture you see the message changes your
[1:57:02] atmosphere see bring you back bring them
[1:57:06] back to the faith that see and and and
[1:57:10] the faith has a different atmosphere
[1:57:12] from unbelief atmosphere bring you back
[1:57:15] to the faith that was once delivered to
[1:57:16] the Saints bring them back to the faith
[1:57:19] of the father's the Pentecostal part in
[1:57:23] the restoration time I will restore
[1:57:25] sayith the Lord that's real event in
[1:57:29] time evangelism end time evangelism
[1:57:33] right
[1:57:36] remember the angel of the Lord told
[1:57:38] Brother brandham that his ministry would
[1:57:40] be that liken unto uh John the
[1:57:45] Baptist and he was in the Ohio River
[1:57:49] baptizing a group of people and on his
[1:57:52] 17th person amen as he was baptizing
[1:57:55] them a light
[1:57:57] appeared and brother brm tells it in
[1:58:00] many places but this one he says I was
[1:58:02] baptizing at 2:00 in the afternoon and
[1:58:04] right out of the out of that brassy
[1:58:08] sky where there hadn't been rain for
[1:58:10] weeks here he come with a Roar and said
[1:58:13] as John the Baptist was sent forth to
[1:58:15] forerun the first coming Christ you're
[1:58:17] sent forth with the message to forerun
[1:58:20] the second coming of Christ amen so
[1:58:23] brother brandham is getting his
[1:58:24] commission he knows
[1:58:26] now even though he may have not known it
[1:58:28] fully at that time but now it's is Lord
[1:58:32] is
[1:58:34] establishing to him that his ministry
[1:58:37] going to be different from till osburn's
[1:58:39] and and Jack Cole's and uh uh who all
[1:58:42] them other men his ministry would be
[1:58:45] like John the Baptist forun the second
[1:58:48] coming amen and so this explains why his
[1:58:51] message is so important because later on
[1:58:54] in his ministry it was revealed to him
[1:58:56] that his
[1:58:57] message that that was to forun the the
[1:59:00] second coming was that of the seventh
[1:59:03] angel of Revelations 10:7 right his
[1:59:06] message was of that and then in that
[1:59:09] message would be what Jesus Promised in
[1:59:11] Malachi 4 he would be that prophet and
[1:59:13] his message would actually turn that the
[1:59:16] heart of that elect back to the faith
[1:59:18] right see so so uh uh it's it's all
[1:59:22] preparing for Rapture so this uh uh
[1:59:25] brother Braham said see the seventh
[1:59:27] Angel's message under the seven under
[1:59:30] the same trumpet and this is the Feast
[1:59:31] of trumpets uh the message that he's
[1:59:34] preaching B said the seventh Angel's
[1:59:36] message under the same Trent same
[1:59:39] everything exactly same seal what is it
[1:59:42] to do to call the people the bride out
[1:59:45] of that Pentecostal and World tradition
[1:59:48] to the genuine wine atonement the word
[1:59:50] Christ impersonated in his word here
[1:59:53] made flesh Among Us science has proved
[1:59:56] it by pictures right the church knows it
[1:59:59] the world around see we firmly know it
[2:00:02] for he's never told us one thing and
[2:00:04] thus say the Lord but what's been the
[2:00:05] truth see did he not say down there on
[2:00:08] the river as John the Baptist was sent
[2:00:10] so will this message see so then so his
[2:00:14] message is that of the angel of seventh
[2:00:17] angel his message is tied to the Rapture
[2:00:21] for it's the shout right 1 Thessalonians
[2:00:24] 4:16 the Lord himself shall descend with
[2:00:27] a shout and in that Rapture message
[2:00:29] brother Brown says the shout is the
[2:00:32] message to gather the people right see
[2:00:36] so the message of the seventh angel is
[2:00:38] is the key to the Dead Rising out of the
[2:00:42] ground it it's it's the key to the
[2:00:44] changing of our bodies it's the key to
[2:00:46] us being caught up to meet the Lord in
[2:00:48] the air
[2:00:50] and and brother Brown said the
[2:00:51] bridegroom call comes through this right
[2:00:54] the message it it's the bridegroom call
[2:00:57] so this is why they want to nitpick
[2:00:59] brother brandom they want to say well
[2:01:00] that's his opinion and this opinion all
[2:01:02] that well whatever they want to say
[2:01:04] that's fine all I know is the bridegroom
[2:01:07] call it is the bridegroom call amen see
[2:01:11] amen and and calling us to the marriage
[2:01:13] supper of the Lamb amen see so so this
[2:01:17] message is is like Mama's voice was to
[2:01:20] the eagle that little eaglet see Amen in
[2:01:24] it it's to us the message is to us that
[2:01:27] same way brother brandham he said a man
[2:01:29] asked me a few moments ago about the
[2:01:31] coming in the Rapture well we know we've
[2:01:34] lived the time out we've lived the time
[2:01:36] out the at the time of rapture is at
[2:01:40] hand and we're looking everybody say
[2:01:42] we're looking for a rapturing faith that
[2:01:46] can pull the church together and give it
[2:01:49] some Supernatural strength that can
[2:01:52] change these bodies that we live in and
[2:01:55] now we when we see a God that can raise
[2:01:58] the dead off the floor or out of the
[2:02:00] yard and bring him back to life again
[2:02:02] and present him before us when we see a
[2:02:05] God who can take a cancer that's eat a
[2:02:08] man to shatter and raise him up to a
[2:02:11] strong healthy man that ought to give
[2:02:13] rapturing Faith to the people that when
[2:02:16] that light flashes from the sky and the
[2:02:19] trumpet sounds the body of Christ will
[2:02:21] be quickly gathered together and changed
[2:02:24] in a moment and taken into the heavens
[2:02:28] can you say Amen now I say to you that
[2:02:30] we're not waiting for something we're
[2:02:32] not looking for something to give us WRA
[2:02:34] uh Supernatural strength this message is
[2:02:37] the thing that's given this elect a
[2:02:40] supernatural
[2:02:42] strength prise the Lord can you say man
[2:02:46] the fly amen we found that we're not
[2:02:49] like nothing like the chicken and we've
[2:02:52] also found out we're nothing like the
[2:02:53] hawk now you go listen to uh uh
[2:02:57] uh
[2:02:58] the yeah spiritual food seed is not air
[2:03:02] with the Shu shall not be air with the
[2:03:05] Shu uh uh them and and brother brandom
[2:03:08] talks about the hawk and how that the
[2:03:10] hawk is a brother to the eagle and and
[2:03:14] we we uh we got a couple Hawks that hang
[2:03:17] out in our yard you know and they just
[2:03:19] sit in the trees and they're looking for
[2:03:21] us to skin deer and
[2:03:24] throw yeah throw the access out and uh
[2:03:28] away and things like that and so they
[2:03:31] they they they learned just to kind of
[2:03:33] hang out for a while in the trees and
[2:03:35] stuff and and so brother BR says see but
[2:03:38] the hwk was similar to The Eagle he he
[2:03:41] was made he he was made to fly in the
[2:03:44] heavenlies to hunt for his food and he
[2:03:46] used to fly in the heavenlies to hunt
[2:03:48] for pursue food but nature always always
[2:03:51] God has nature to testify what's really
[2:03:53] going to happen or what is happening or
[2:03:56] whatever and and brother Bram says but
[2:03:58] that haulk has gotten so soft he's so
[2:04:02] soft that he won't go hunting anymore he
[2:04:04] just sits on the poles he sets on the
[2:04:06] trees you you drove around the the
[2:04:08] highways and you see this Hawk on that
[2:04:10] on the telephone pole or the fence pole
[2:04:13] he's waiting for food you know he's got
[2:04:15] the god-given talent to go up you know
[2:04:18] but he's too soft he's too lazy he he's
[2:04:22] content just sitting there until someone
[2:04:24] squishes the mouse and then he goes and
[2:04:26] gets it you know and and that's food to
[2:04:28] him right see so he he he's gotten soft
[2:04:32] brother BR said he has long lost his
[2:04:35] identification of his original creation
[2:04:38] he don't fly in the skies anymore he Ops
[2:04:41] on the ground like a vulture sets upon a
[2:04:43] telephone post hops along hunting for
[2:04:45] Dead Rabbits the hawk wasn't made to do
[2:04:47] that see that's just like the natural or
[2:04:50] the church and he's talking of the
[2:04:51] natural church church natural it was
[2:04:53] made see the church was made similar to
[2:04:56] The Eagle it should take the place in
[2:04:58] the heavenlies but instead of that it's
[2:05:00] gotten soft it don't fly into the
[2:05:02] unknown no more and and and Into the
[2:05:04] Blue right that's right see no sir it's
[2:05:07] dependent on its modern ways of adoption
[2:05:10] of Education of Theology and in some
[2:05:14] man-made denomination looking for a
[2:05:16] bunch of Dead Rabbits half rotten that
[2:05:19] something uh else had and you know what
[2:05:21] now they're willing to accept gays and G
[2:05:24] transgenders and and all of that they're
[2:05:26] so soft eating maggoty food and and
[2:05:29] filth and and all of that you know
[2:05:32] brother Bram even talked about that
[2:05:33] these guys will you know put their keys
[2:05:35] in the Hat and and and then then pull a
[2:05:37] key out and whatever key they got that's
[2:05:39] the woman they go to to to to bed with
[2:05:42] and swapping wives and all that happens
[2:05:44] in the church amen and and and they're
[2:05:47] soft when they should be flying in the
[2:05:49] heavenlies they should be a a a a a real
[2:05:53] uh uh Powerhouse for the for the world
[2:05:56] to look at look where they're at today
[2:05:58] so steep in politics and and just
[2:06:01] corruption can you say amen he said see
[2:06:04] what is it they're hopping along on the
[2:06:05] ground now that's right just a hawk see
[2:06:08] that that that's what tells it see but
[2:06:10] the eagle hasn't changed a bit see he
[2:06:14] stays an eagle and you know what an
[2:06:17] eagle lives in a different atmosphere
[2:06:19] than that Hulk and then that chicken and
[2:06:22] that Sparrow and all of these things
[2:06:24] he's in a higher he's in an Heavenly
[2:06:27] atmosphere and that's where you should
[2:06:29] be as Eagle when you're at home and
[2:06:31] sickness comes don't you sit there like
[2:06:33] some old chicken and say I just don't
[2:06:35] know I just I'm just going to pull my
[2:06:37] hair I don't know what to do oh yes you
[2:06:39] do if you're an eagle you've been
[2:06:41] feeding off this work you know what it
[2:06:43] is to pray you know what it is to
[2:06:45] believe you know that God still works
[2:06:47] miracles
[2:06:51] quit acting like a chicken quit acting
[2:06:52] like a
[2:06:55] hawk I'm afraid to shake somebody's hand

[2:08:29] eagle oh try it one time it'll make you
[2:08:32] different but you'll be glad you're
[2:08:34] different because God will walk with
[2:08:41] you that's
[2:08:45] free Lord but still true eagles live in
[2:08:49] a different atmosphere that's right

[2:11:52] in my
[2:11:53] house can you say Amen why I'm an eagle
[2:11:56] I live in a different
[2:11:58] atmosphere we're going to change this
[2:12:01] thing the message tells me to
[2:12:04] change it'll change your beliefs it'll
[2:12:06] change your habits it'll change the way
[2:12:08] you live the way you look at things
[2:12:10] it'll change your
[2:12:12] outlook if there's ever a time that we
[2:12:14] should be rugged Christians the message
[2:12:16] should make us rugged Christians and
[2:12:18] brother Braham said we ought to be
[2:12:19] rugged Christians not some soft soaped
[2:12:22] up you know to where someone sneeze we
[2:12:25] all pass
[2:12:27] out be rugged Christians God's looking
[2:12:31] for rugged
[2:12:38] Christians
[2:12:40] Praise You Love the
[2:12:44] Lord hallu now notice eagles live in
[2:12:49] that different atmosphere brother Brian
[2:12:50] said see the church was once the carrier
[2:12:53] of a true word justification then it
[2:12:55] become a carrier of sanctification then
[2:12:57] it become a carrier of the baptism of
[2:12:59] the Holy Ghost restoration of the gifts
[2:13:02] but then when he goes on and keeps going
[2:13:05] back see this the the the the see that
[2:13:08] that believer or whatever churchgoer see
[2:13:11] tried to eat something Mana of another
[2:13:14] day it's rotten it's no good right
[2:13:18] but an genuine Eagle of this day knows
[2:13:22] that that was all right but we've got
[2:13:25] that plus until Jesus Christ is made
[2:13:29] manifest in the fullness of his power as
[2:13:32] he promised to be in the last days now
[2:13:35] she talking about the church which if
[2:13:37] you go listen to the Future uh not
[2:13:39] future home uh the the the the seed
[2:13:41] shall not be air with the shuck brother
[2:13:42] B identifies that shuck as the
[2:13:44] Pentecostal age she is now a a dry
[2:13:49] shut the life has passed from her the
[2:13:52] spirit of God passed through her is true
[2:13:55] and will not she will not be Heir with
[2:13:59] the Vindicated seed word she sure will
[2:14:02] not be she will not be in the
[2:14:07] Rapture she'll be a church
[2:14:10] member may come up come up in the second
[2:14:12] res resurrection and be judged according
[2:14:14] to what she's heard ain't that right but
[2:14:17] she ain't going to be in a
[2:14:18] Rapture that Pentecostal shuck ain't
[2:14:20] going to be in a Rapture anyone that
[2:14:22] keeps looking back and looking back
[2:14:24] instead of ref instead of moving on with
[2:14:26] the light is going to be is not going in
[2:14:28] a
[2:14:29] Rapture can you say Amen now the world
[2:14:31] wants to move and and advance in
[2:14:33] technology but they don't want to
[2:14:34] advance in
[2:14:37] God Amen brother Bram talked about that
[2:14:40] too you know back at we py Beal you know
[2:14:43] we lived in py where Pony Beal was right
[2:14:46] y'all know who Pony Beal was
[2:14:53] thank
[2:14:54] you Terry out
[2:14:57] west well he was with Wild Bill hickcock
[2:14:59] and boy you go PA me you'll learn all
[2:15:02] about
[2:15:03] him yeah and so he lived you know I
[2:15:08] don't know when he lived but he lived
[2:15:10] out there in the in the air of the West
[2:15:14] Western days and so you know but but
[2:15:18] every
[2:15:19] year uh everybody dresses up you know a
[2:15:23] certain time of year and they reenact
[2:15:25] the pawn he Bill and what he done and
[2:15:28] and you know and and and these guys will
[2:15:30] walk down to our little through the
[2:15:31] little old town of 2,000 people you know
[2:15:34] and uh all the little guys just oo and
[2:15:37] all wow that's so cool you know but
[2:15:40] brother Brandon talks about that how
[2:15:42] they always want to reenact the past
[2:15:44] always lived out you know and then he
[2:15:45] tells them modern women he says well why
[2:15:47] don't don't you wear Grandma's dress
[2:15:50] then if you want to really go back then
[2:15:52] wear my grandma's dress wash that makeup
[2:15:55] off your face quit cutting your hair and
[2:15:58] act like a woman but they don't want to
[2:16:00] do that
[2:16:02] right amen see so if they want to go
[2:16:05] they only want to go just a little bit
[2:16:06] back not not too far back not to the day
[2:16:09] of Pentecost where you get really get a
[2:16:11] holy ghost experience right see so the
[2:16:15] prophet says see she no more flies into
[2:16:17] the blue into the unknown unto the
[2:16:19] supernatural where the powers and
[2:16:20] Heights and the promises of God Eternal
[2:16:23] Word is made possible see where all
[2:16:25] things uh all things to them that
[2:16:27] believe she won't believe that see she
[2:16:30] said see she falls right back on the
[2:16:32] telephone wire and said well my
[2:16:34] denomination says the rabbits is all
[2:16:36] right well if denomination you know one
[2:16:40] Deacon told told told the pastor you
[2:16:42] know and says well well they've
[2:16:44] legalized marijuana so I can I can I I I
[2:16:47] have ever right to to to to smoke
[2:16:49] marijuana if I want to you know well
[2:16:52] that Deacon got set
[2:16:54] down and and but but you you just
[2:16:57] because they say it just because they
[2:16:59] say it's okay to go half nude not even
[2:17:02] half
[2:17:04] anymore does that make it okay
[2:17:07] absolutely not we go by the word of God
[2:17:10] ain't that right see so so my
[2:17:13] denomination says the rabbits is all
[2:17:15] right though they got maggots in them
[2:17:17] see but they're all right and she
[2:17:19] depends on that but she's not going in
[2:17:22] Rapture you understand what I'm saying
[2:17:24] see so so when you're really feeding off
[2:17:26] the message it's going to change
[2:17:28] everything about you because it's
[2:17:30] preparing you for a Rapture it's
[2:17:32] preparing you for a body change it's
[2:17:34] preparing so therefore instead of
[2:17:37] falling apart on things you know what
[2:17:39] brother Bram even told us and and this
[2:17:41] is not a to
[2:17:43] bring chew out or even into a legalism
[2:17:46] brother brand is just telling what is
[2:17:48] really in us as as the sons of God that
[2:17:52] even if you burnt your hand on on the
[2:17:54] fire on a stove he says usually what we
[2:17:57] do is and we start panicking go get the
[2:18:00] whatever turpentine or whatever he said
[2:18:01] go get something and and put it on there
[2:18:04] he said but if you would just shake it
[2:18:06] off and not even pay a b he said it
[2:18:08] wouldn't even it wouldn't even touch you
[2:18:11] but he's telling us this because of what
[2:18:13] we are made to
[2:18:15] be praise the Lord are you with me I can
[2:18:19] give you a quote I I don't have it right
[2:18:21] here but I can give you a quote where he
[2:18:22] says
[2:18:24] that but what is it we fall apart
[2:18:27] because the world does
[2:18:30] it if the world is falling apart let
[2:18:32] them fall apart but you've been lifted
[2:18:34] out of that
[2:18:35] barnyard there's nothing left there but
[2:18:39] judgment but God has prepared you for a
[2:18:44] Rapture and it ain't just going to come
[2:18:48] you've been changing your
[2:18:50] environment you've been changing the
[2:18:52] atmosphere all around you brother R said
[2:18:54] you got the ability to change your
[2:18:55] atmosphere you got you you got the power
[2:18:57] to change it don't you let somebody else
[2:19:00] in influence you you let this word
[2:19:03] influence you can you say amen that's
[2:19:06] right so we've not changed from what God
[2:19:08] started us out to be on the day of
[2:19:10] Pentecost see the seed that was that the
[2:19:13] seed that was planted on the day of
[2:19:15] Pentecost was the original seed God
[2:19:17] planted that he started his church now
[2:19:19] we're living in this day where the seed
[2:19:22] that same seed has ripened that's right
[2:19:25] can you say Amen what they claim to be
[2:19:27] the church they take out miracles did
[2:19:29] they did did that seed that God planted
[2:19:32] in its infancy did it work miracles did
[2:19:35] it perform signs and
[2:19:38] wonders sure it
[2:19:40] did so now we are that same church that
[2:19:44] same seed that has come to maturity for
[2:19:48] Rapture that's the
[2:19:51] truth so then if we are that one then
[2:19:54] notice brother BR said the shuck has to
[2:19:56] pull away so the grain can get in the
[2:19:59] presence of the sun I hear the coming of
[2:20:01] the combine Lord it won't be long and
[2:20:03] then the great elevator will take up his
[2:20:05] bride into the glory for in the presence
[2:20:07] of God another place what did it pull
[2:20:10] away for so that it would bring the
[2:20:12] Grain in the presence of the sun to
[2:20:14] ripen the grain to a golden ripen for
[2:20:17] the Master see so that's why everything
[2:20:19] is pulling away from you amen everything
[2:20:22] you know quit quit trying to be attached
[2:20:24] to things that people that that God is
[2:20:26] trying to take away from you you you got
[2:20:28] to stand alone in this message and and
[2:20:30] let it ripen you to where you you you're
[2:20:33] not hanging on to this idea and this
[2:20:35] idea and that idea and what what grandma
[2:20:37] says and what mama says and what daddy
[2:20:39] says and what preacher says and what
[2:20:41] this says stay with this
[2:20:44] message stay with it and then let it it
[2:20:47] ripen you receive it in you let it ripen
[2:20:52] you can you say Amen see oh yes see it
[2:20:56] it it it pulls away so that it brings
[2:20:59] that grain that seed you that's where
[2:21:02] we're at see not Chuck we're we're
[2:21:04] bright it's bride time sea time in
[2:21:06] presence of the sun to ripen the grain
[2:21:09] to a golden ripen for the master why is
[2:21:11] it pulled away sure it causes heartaches
[2:21:14] tears see that they don't lay before the
[2:21:19] s n but the s o n to be ripened to the
[2:21:23] true Full Gospel to manifest everything
[2:21:27] that Jesus Promised in the Bible didn't
[2:21:29] you say Amen so when we hear that voice
[2:21:32] and we're connecting as Mama to that

[2:21:53] believe in that everybody an
[2:21:56] eagle now what do I do

[2:22:05] believe the word why can't we believe
[2:22:06] the word if they can see signs and
[2:22:07] wonders why can't we believe signs and
[2:22:09] wonders if brother ramam can put a token
[2:22:11] over his children why can't we put a
[2:22:13] token on our children if he could rest
[2:22:14] in that token why can't we rest in that
[2:22:16] token can you say man if he walked with
[2:22:18] God why can't we walk with God Amen you
[2:22:21] say oh well he was a prophet oh nonsense
[2:22:23] that's the devil talking in in that
[2:22:25] sense he had a particular Ministry we
[2:22:27] understand that he walked in he lived in
[2:22:28] the presence of that angel and all that
[2:22:30] stuff amen but as brother BR said Moses
[2:22:32] was just he was not the bride he was
[2:22:34] part of the of the of the of the Bride
[2:22:37] of the people brother Brandon was not
[2:22:39] the bride he was part of the Bride he
[2:22:41] was part of us and he was calling us to
[2:22:44] come up higher come up higher and you

[2:22:58] called see he said there's a raising up
[2:23:01] of a body today among the people there
[2:23:03] will be no more organizations it goes
[2:23:05] that goes right into Rich l
[2:23:07] osia so the Angel's message is to pull
[2:23:10] us out of the Pentecostal and World
[2:23:12] Traditions now notice what brother brm
[2:23:15] said in the invisible Union of the bride

[2:23:56] and make a big mess of
[2:23:58] himself and everybody be gone and he
[2:24:00] just sitting there and but one day a
[2:24:03] poor old man a man come by and saw that
[2:24:05] poor old thing and he picked it up and
[2:24:08] he cut it loose and he set it on the
[2:24:10] ground the buzz that Crow just sat there

[2:24:47] of life that's what the Bible said your
[2:24:50] H your first husband that you were
[2:24:51] married to the world the anointed
[2:24:53] bridegroom which forain you has washed

[2:24:58] church no that doesn't sound right you
[2:25:00] might find that in the AL Almanac but

[2:25:04] washing of the Water by the word in the
[2:25:07] word you're standing completely
[2:25:10] Justified as though you never did it at
[2:25:12] the beginning this is my message to the
[2:25:16] church

[2:26:10] Lord oh what a time it will be
[2:26:15] amen
[2:26:22] what a
[2:26:23] timeall I thought of this um I got I
[2:26:27] mean taken a long time but I got a lot
[2:26:29] to go but I
[2:26:32] do you know in the early
[2:26:35] years brother brandom of of his
[2:26:39] ministry um he was in San Antonio Texas
[2:26:44] and he was walking out on the platform
[2:26:46] to speak
[2:26:47] and a man started speaking in
[2:26:49] tongues brother Bri said it was like a
[2:26:52] machine gun rapidly way back way back
[2:26:55] there the fellow raised up and said thus
[2:26:57] sayth the Lord the man that's walking to
[2:26:59] the platform is going forward with the
[2:27:00] ministry that was ordained of almighty
[2:27:04] God and as John the Baptist was sent as
[2:27:08] the first Forerunner of the coming of
[2:27:10] Jesus Christ so he packs a message that
[2:27:13] will cause the second coming of the Lord
[2:27:15] Jesus Christ
[2:27:18] brother brandan was
[2:27:21] so astounded I guess or whatever he
[2:27:24] began to ask do you know that man do you
[2:27:26] know who he was nobody knew who he
[2:27:31] was then after that
[2:27:37] happening Brother
[2:27:39] Brandon talks about being in
[2:27:45] Arkansas after after after that and he
[2:27:48] said I was trying to explain it trying
[2:27:50] to explain the pillar of
[2:27:53] fire cuz he had seen it but nobody else
[2:27:56] had as of yet and he said people knew
[2:27:59] they would sit and listen Methodist
[2:28:01] Baptist Presbyterians and so forth and
[2:28:04] then I happened to look and coming in
[2:28:06] the door here it come that Pillar of
[2:28:12] Fire it was just
[2:28:15] going
[2:28:18] he said I I I said I will not have to
[2:28:20] speak anymore for here it comes now and
[2:28:23] it moved up and people began screaming
[2:28:26] and they come up to where I was and
[2:28:28] settle down
[2:28:30] around just as it was settling down a
[2:28:33] Min Minister run up and said I see that
[2:28:35] and it struck him blind as could be and
[2:28:38] he staggered
[2:28:40] back you can look at his picture right
[2:28:42] there in the book and see as it as see
[2:28:45] it as he staggered back with his head
[2:28:47] down like that you can see his picture
[2:28:50] and there it settled down just the
[2:28:53] newspaper photographer caught it at that
[2:28:56] time but the Lord wasn't
[2:28:59] ready then after that he he talks about
[2:29:03] how he had went after that event he he
[2:29:07] sometime later he went to that Houston
[2:29:10] Coliseum there in Houston Texas and
[2:29:14] there's that skeptic that was
[2:29:18] trying to prove that brother Brian was a
[2:29:21] fraud in healing and that God didn't
[2:29:23] heal and d d
[2:29:24] and but then the angel of the Lord come
[2:29:27] down whirling in that room
[2:29:30] and all the thousands people that had
[2:29:33] gather he said saw
[2:29:35] it but notice what he said this is
[2:29:39] profound because we weren't there when
[2:29:42] that
[2:29:43] happened but he said yet the one that
[2:29:46] sees the picture see that picture was
[2:29:50] taken there in that Houston colum
[2:29:53] Coliseum when brother branham's critic
[2:29:56] you know hired a photographer to take
[2:29:58] pictures of him not brother brandham but
[2:30:01] him and he had his picture with his fist
[2:30:05] taken with his fist right under brother
[2:30:07] FF Bosworth's nose and
[2:30:10] Posen none of them pictures took
[2:30:14] took but that photographer took a
[2:30:16] picture when that angel of the Lord
[2:30:17] settled and here it was right
[2:30:20] there brother BR said see the one yet
[2:30:24] the ones that sees the picture has a
[2:30:26] greater proof than you that seen it with
[2:30:29] your natural eye cuz with your natural
[2:30:32] eye you could have been mistaken it
[2:30:34] could have been an optical optical
[2:30:37] illusion but that's not an optical
[2:30:40] illusion that's the truth where
[2:30:43] scientific research proves that it's the
[2:30:45] truth
[2:30:47] and the Lord Jesus Christ has did this
[2:30:50] amen what's he done he's done it for you
[2:30:52] and I Amen to give us proof that what
