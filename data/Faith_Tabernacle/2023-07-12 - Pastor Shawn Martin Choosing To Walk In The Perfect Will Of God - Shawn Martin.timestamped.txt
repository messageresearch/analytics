[33:21] father no doubt that Satan has fought
[33:24] your people today and been warring
[33:28] upon them Lord maybe in the Physical
[33:30] Realm spiritual Realm
[33:33] the Lord we're asking you to come Among
[33:37] Us
[33:38] Lord that you would defeat the Devil
[33:41] tonight Lord and drive every spirit
[33:44] that is not like you away from the
[33:46] people
[33:48] father help us to believe father
[33:51] and I pray Lord that you would just Lift
[33:54] us up into a Heavenly Realm
[33:57] draw was closer to you father and what
[34:00] little words we would have I pray that
[34:02] you would multiply them and Lord let it
[34:05] sink into every Heart Lord
[34:07] Lord we give this service to you now in
[34:11] Jesus Christ's name and the church says
[34:15] amen and amen
[34:18] the uh
[34:20] I want to just read the 12th chapter
[34:23] of the book of Colossians
[34:29] I'm not good at these names so if I miss
[34:31] it Miss say it you just forgive me but
[34:38] Colossians the fourth chapter 12th verse
[34:42] it prefers
[34:45] who is one of you a servant of Christ
[34:47] saluteth you always laboring fervently
[34:50] for you in prayers
[34:53] that you may stand perfect
[34:56] and complete in all everybody say all in
[35:01] all the will of God
[35:04] amen you can have your seats this
[35:07] evening
[35:10] that you may stand perfect and complete
[35:13] in all the will
[35:15] of God
[35:17] and if I would have a a title
[35:21] um I guess it would be choosing to walk
[35:23] in the perfect will of God
[35:26] and last night just
[35:30] I don't know uh
[35:33] couldn't sleep but just asking the Lord
[35:36] you know what I could speak on
[35:40] uh that would be a
[35:44] beneficial be a help
[35:46] and woke up with this thought on my mind
[35:50] and and so it just kind of opened up to
[35:53] me and so we're just gonna talk about it
[35:56] but
[35:57] uh of course the will of God is the plan
[36:03] that God has uh
[36:06] for us
[36:08] where you in other words we're not we're
[36:10] not God doesn't want us to wonder
[36:12] aimlessly
[36:14] through life
[36:16] just you know bumping here and bumping
[36:19] there and just trying just going but he
[36:22] wants us to to he's got a plan
[36:26] and and and that plan is his will
[36:31] so then therefore as Believers we should
[36:34] all
[36:36] uh strive
[36:38] uh to know
[36:41] what is the will of God
[36:43] and then walk in that wheel
[36:48] and so uh as as we know throughout the
[36:52] Bible and and even in our personal walk
[36:55] that being in the will of God is where
[36:59] the peace of God Lays
[37:02] being in the will of God is where the
[37:05] blessings of God lay
[37:08] it's it's where the blessings are it's
[37:10] where that we can find rest
[37:13] is in in the will of God walking in that
[37:16] wheel
[37:18] now we we teach strongly on
[37:21] predestination we believe in
[37:23] predestination because the Bible teaches
[37:27] it
[37:28] and I'm going to go through several
[37:29] scriptures but to to talk about this for
[37:33] a moment but Ephesians 1 and 4
[37:37] Paul would say according as he hath
[37:40] chosen Us in him
[37:43] before the foundation of the world
[37:46] so when did he choose you not when you
[37:49] come to an altar
[37:50] but he chose us in him before the
[37:53] foundation of the world way before the
[37:55] world ever began
[37:57] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[38:01] before him in love aren't you glad for
[38:03] that now that's something that's that's
[38:05] predestinated having predestinated us
[38:09] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[38:12] Christ to himself
[38:14] according to the good pleasure of his
[38:18] will
[38:19] not my will not your will but his will
[38:24] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[38:26] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[38:30] Beloved so then we find that God
[38:33] predestinated it all according to his
[38:38] own will to the good pleasure
[38:40] and we've talked about it uh and that is
[38:45] that God could only predestinate
[38:48] by his foreknowledge
[38:50] ain't that right
[38:51] knowing in the beginning what would be
[38:55] now if you go on down to the ninth verse
[38:58] of Ephesians it says having made known
[39:01] unto us the mystery of his will
[39:05] so this this will was a mystery but it's
[39:08] made known to us
[39:10] according to his good pleasure which he
[39:13] hath purposed in himself
[39:15] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[39:17] of times he might gather together in one
[39:19] all things in Christ both which are in
[39:23] heaven and which are on earth even in
[39:25] him ain't that right
[39:27] 11th verse in whom also we have obtained
[39:32] an inheritance being predestinated
[39:35] everybody say being predestinated
[39:38] according to the purpose of him who
[39:41] worketh all things after the counsel of
[39:44] his own will
[39:47] so God has a will and from that wheel is
[39:50] a plan
[39:52] and is a purpose it but everything that
[39:55] God does is based off of his own will
[39:57] not our will
[39:58] ain't that right so then then we find uh
[40:03] again that that he he predestinated
[40:06] everything according to that that
[40:07] purpose and and and so notice God
[40:12] doesn't just know about our beginning
[40:15] and our end
[40:17] and uh but he has predestinated
[40:22] he has decreed it he has ordained it to
[40:27] be so
[40:28] he just didn't foresee you and and
[40:32] foreknow you and say well I I understand
[40:34] by my foreknowledge that they're going
[40:37] to be born at a certain time and and
[40:39] they're going to this is going to be
[40:40] their end over here because I can
[40:42] foresee it but he decreed it
[40:45] he declared it he he ordained it ain't
[40:48] that right so so your salvation
[40:52] is predestinated and ordained of God do
[40:56] you believe that
[40:57] you being in heaven is not by chance but
[41:02] it's predestinated or ordained of God
[41:07] every person that is going to go in the
[41:10] rapture
[41:12] is not going to be there by chance
[41:15] it is predestinated
[41:18] it is ordained God decreed it
[41:22] from the beginning ain't that right
[41:25] sitting at the marriage supper at that
[41:28] table at the marriage supper of the Lamb
[41:31] it everyone that is going to be there
[41:34] isn't there by chance
[41:36] it isn't that God will look at us and
[41:38] say oh you made it wow okay wow yeah no
[41:42] he decreed it
[41:44] he predestinated it
[41:46] so you couldn't miss it if you had to
[41:49] right
[41:50] because he it's it's according to his
[41:53] purpose his will ain't that right
[41:56] so so he knew our beginning
[41:59] he decreed it and he also decreed the
[42:02] end for here Jeremiah 29 11.
[42:06] it says for I know the thoughts that I
[42:09] think towards you saith the Lord
[42:10] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[42:13] give you an expected end
[42:16] ain't that right aren't you glad you got
[42:18] unexpected in
[42:20] we may not know that in in our own mind
[42:22] but God's already declared that him to
[42:25] be
[42:26] you couldn't lose if you had to
[42:29] ain't that right and and this is why
[42:31] Satan cannot do anything to to tear us
[42:35] down he cannot destroy us because God
[42:39] has predestinated us
[42:41] now Isaiah 46 and 9 it says God's
[42:45] speaking remember the former things of
[42:47] old I for I am God and there is none
[42:51] else
[42:52] I am God and there is none like me
[42:56] declaring the end from the beginning
[43:00] from ancient times the things that are
[43:03] not yet done he's already declared it
[43:06] saying my counsel shall stand and I will
[43:10] do all my pleasure
[43:13] I will do all my will ain't that right
[43:17] so yes our Salvation comes by faith
[43:22] ain't that right
[43:24] and yes our healing comes by faith
[43:28] are being in the rapture it comes by
[43:31] faith for the prophet even told us that
[43:33] you've got to have its rapturing faith
[43:35] that you got to possess all of these
[43:37] things come by faith ain't that right
[43:39] the Bible even tells us that the just
[43:43] shall live by faith ain't that right but
[43:47] how can a man believe unless he's
[43:51] predestinated to belief
[43:53] ain't that right see so brother Branham
[43:57] after preaching on the end time signed
[44:00] seed I believe in 62 uh uh says to the
[44:04] audience if you're not right with God if
[44:07] there's something in you won't let you
[44:09] believe this Bible to be the inspired
[44:11] word of God you could not believe uh um
[44:15] that you could live according to its
[44:18] rules would you do so much as just raise
[44:21] your hand and say God be merciful I want
[44:24] you to pray for me brother Branham that
[44:26] I'll be that kind of a Christian are you
[44:28] here raise your hands and he says thank
[44:31] you young lady thank you God bless you
[44:33] all right there's one person in the
[44:34] building that thinks that see two of
[44:36] them that thinks that he says now I'm
[44:38] not one of these persons to persuade if
[44:41] the word can't move it you can only do
[44:45] it as you're predestinated to believe it
[44:48] ain't that right he said you remember
[44:50] although Jesus done so many miracles the
[44:54] Pharisees couldn't believe it they
[44:57] couldn't get it in their head because
[44:59] they wasn't to be that way
[45:03] ain't that right so see there there is a
[45:06] predestinated plan there's a
[45:09] predestinator which tells us that God is
[45:12] in control that God is is working
[45:16] everything after he is on Wheel his own
[45:19] purpose now acts 13 and 46 it says then
[45:26] Paul and bartimus uh wax bold and said
[45:30] it was necessary that the word of God
[45:32] should first have been spoken to you but
[45:35] seeing you put it from you and judge
[45:37] yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life
[45:39] Lo we turn to the Gentiles so so see
[45:43] they're talking to the Jews the Jews
[45:45] have turned it down so he said we're
[45:46] going to turn to the Gentiles for so
[45:49] hath the Lord commanded us saying I have
[45:51] set thee to be a light of the Gentiles
[45:54] that thou shouldest be for salvation
[45:56] unto the ends of the Earth and when the
[45:59] Gentiles heard this they were glad and
[46:03] glorified the word of the Lord and as
[46:06] many everybody's saying this many as
[46:08] were ordained to eternal life
[46:12] believed
[46:13] ain't that right not one less not one
[46:17] more but as many as were predestinated
[46:20] decreed ordained to eternal life they're
[46:24] the ones that believed so a man must be
[46:28] ordained even even uh ordained to
[46:31] eternal life if he in order for him to
[46:35] to believe ain't that right
[46:37] so again God could ordain men to eternal
[46:41] life by his foreknowledge as we said it
[46:44] we'll say it again for everyone's sake
[46:47] is that God did not look let's say he
[46:50] takes two people and says I Choose You
[46:52] and I don't choose you I'll send you to
[46:55] heaven and send you to Hell first of all
[46:56] God doesn't send anyone to hell they
[46:59] they send their own selves to hell but
[47:02] see God by foreknowledge he could
[47:04] already see and know what would be
[47:06] therefore he would ordain and
[47:09] predestinate according to his will
[47:13] hey ain't that right see so he can
[47:16] ordain men to destruction by his
[47:20] foreknowledge as well as for ordained
[47:23] men to eternal life by his foreknowledge
[47:26] well we look at Jude three there are
[47:30] certain men tripped on in unawares who
[47:33] were before of old ordained to this
[47:37] condemnation ungodly men ain't that
[47:41] right see why how did God why would God
[47:43] do that is he already foreknew what
[47:47] would be ain't that right he knew that
[47:50] if these men would come to the Earth
[47:52] they would not accept the the Salvation
[47:55] they would not accept the the the the
[47:57] the provided way that God would have
[48:00] they would actually despise it and turn
[48:03] it down and become exactly what they are
[48:08] ain't that right so there are certain
[48:10] men crept in unawares who were before a
[48:14] vote ordained to this condemnation
[48:16] ungodly men turning the grace of our God
[48:19] into lasciviousness and denying the only
[48:22] Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ now
[48:25] so God did not allow them or they
[48:28] weren't born on this Earth and then all
[48:31] of a sudden they turned down the grace
[48:33] of God they they they they they made the
[48:36] grace of God as in some uh horrible
[48:39] thing uh uh and then God is surprised
[48:42] that they've done this no God already
[48:45] knew that they would do it ain't that
[48:48] right yes sir see he knew that so God
[48:51] knew by his foreknowledge who would
[48:55] accept salvation and who would not ain't
[48:59] that right so God isn't wasting his time
[49:02] uh uh trying to get everybody saved he
[49:06] already knew who would and who wouldn't
[49:08] be saved but yet according to his
[49:11] foreknowledge he could work out all
[49:14] things according to his will
[49:16] ain't that right now let's look at
[49:19] Romans 9 and 9. for This Is The Word of
[49:22] Promise at this time uh this is God
[49:25] speaking uh at this time will I come and
[49:29] Sarah shall have a son and not only this
[49:32] but when Rebecca also had conceived by
[49:34] one even by Our Father Isaac see Rebecca
[49:38] had twin boys right uh uh uh Esau and
[49:41] Jacob for the children them children not
[49:45] yet being born neither having done any
[49:48] good or evil see manifesting upon this
[49:51] Earth good works or bad works or
[49:53] whatever but that the purpose of God
[49:56] according to election might stand not of
[50:00] works but of him that calleth it was
[50:02] said unto her the elders Shall Serve the
[50:05] younger as it is written Jacob have I
[50:08] love but Esau have I hated
[50:12] what shall we say then is there
[50:14] unrighteousness with God God forbid for
[50:17] he saith to Moses I will have mercy on
[50:20] whom I will have mercy and I will have
[50:22] compassion on whom I will have
[50:24] compassion so then it is not of him that
[50:27] willeth nor of him that runeth but of
[50:30] God that showeth Mercy
[50:33] for the scripture sayeth unto Pharaoh
[50:36] even for the same purpose have I raised
[50:39] thee up that I might show my power in
[50:42] thee and that my name might be declared
[50:45] throughout all the Earth well let me ask
[50:47] you was Pharaoh a preacher
[50:49] was he was he a leader in in in in in
[50:52] the gospel absolutely not he was a
[50:56] heathen King
[50:57] that that gave Israel a hard time that
[51:00] despised Moses's message
[51:03] ain't that right and yet God says but
[51:05] I've raised thee up for this purpose
[51:07] that my glory might be revealed in thee
[51:10] ain't that right see so Pharaoh had a
[51:14] part to play in God's plan
[51:17] ain't that right
[51:19] so he says God goes on in the eighth
[51:21] tenth verse therefore uh or Paul would
[51:24] say therefore hath he Mercy on whom he
[51:26] will have mercy and whom he will he
[51:30] hardness
[51:31] well that will say unto me then why does
[51:33] he yet find fault uh uh for who hath
[51:36] resisted his will the will of God Nate
[51:40] but o man who art thou that replyest
[51:42] against God shall the thing formed say
[51:45] to him that formed it why hast Thou made
[51:47] me thus hath not the Potter power over
[51:51] the clay of the same lump to make one
[51:54] vessel unto honor and another unto
[51:57] dishonor what if God willing to show his
[52:01] wrath and to make his power known
[52:04] endured with much long suffering the
[52:08] vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction
[52:11] can you say Amen see and that he might
[52:15] make known the glory or the riches of
[52:19] his glory on the vessels of Mercy which
[52:22] he had a four beforehand prepared unto
[52:26] Glory
[52:27] so God is in charge I'm going to believe
[52:29] God is in charge and everything that God
[52:31] does is right do you believe that amen
[52:34] that that's right see so you cannot
[52:36] question God as to why he done this and
[52:39] why he done that he does it according to
[52:41] his own will and he's righteous in his
[52:45] what he does
[52:46] ain't that right so by the foreknowledge
[52:49] of God there are vessels of Wrath who
[52:53] are fitted for Destruction and there are
[52:56] vessels of Mercy that he has beforehand
[52:59] prepared unto to glory amen that's right
[53:04] now let's look at Acts 2 and 22 ye men
[53:08] of Israel hear these words Jesus of
[53:10] Nazareth a man approved of God among you
[53:14] by Miracles and wonders and signs which
[53:18] God did by him in the midst of you as
[53:21] you ye yourselves also know him being
[53:24] delivered by the determinant counsel and
[53:29] foreknowledge of God
[53:32] God determined it would happen God
[53:35] foreknew it would happen and here now
[53:38] Jesus comes to Earth and everything that
[53:42] God foreknew would happen and declared
[53:44] would happen it happened
[53:47] and and and and and and so now he's
[53:49] telling these men amen that Jesus or God
[53:52] worked through him and and he done signs
[53:55] and wonders and miracles but you
[53:58] crucified him you you nailed him to the
[54:01] Cross you put him in the grave but it
[54:03] was all for ordained of God for God
[54:06] foreknew it
[54:07] ain't that right see so him being
[54:10] delivered by the determinate counsel and
[54:12] foreknowledge of God you have taken and
[54:15] by Wicked hands have crucified and slain
[54:18] ain't that right
[54:19] so then we go uh uh looking in in First
[54:23] Peter and I I'm wanting to say lay a
[54:25] foundation hopefully uh uh right fast
[54:29] but First Peter 1 and 1 Peter an apostle
[54:32] of Jesus Christ to The Strangers
[54:34] scattered throughout pontus Glacier uh
[54:38] Cappadocia Asia and bisnia something
[54:43] like that all these all these uh uh uh
[54:46] uh uh strangers scattered through these
[54:49] these places notice in the in the second
[54:51] verse he left everybody say elect
[54:54] according to what the fort knowledge of
[54:59] God the Father ain't that right so so we
[55:03] are elect according to the foreknowledge
[55:06] of God the Father a man see so now we
[55:11] know that God could have kept uh uh the
[55:15] the the evil men ungodly man these
[55:18] Wicked hands from uh uh being born uh
[55:22] but he didn't he could have kept Pharaoh
[55:24] from being born but he didn't he allowed
[55:27] it ain't that right he could have kept
[55:30] all of these things and and and the the
[55:32] question is so much is why why is there
[55:35] so much sin why is there so much evil
[55:37] why does bad things happen why why why
[55:40] do we have all of these things and of
[55:42] course everyone wants to blame God even
[55:44] those who don't even believe in God when
[55:46] bad things happen somehow there's a God
[55:49] all of a sudden and they want to blame
[55:51] him
[55:52] but but we find that there has to be a
[55:55] contrast
[55:57] there has to be a contrast it takes the
[55:59] night to show the day it takes death to
[56:03] show life it takes sorrow to show the
[56:05] joy and happiness it takes the mountains
[56:08] to show the valley it takes the bad
[56:11] times to show the good times ain't that
[56:13] right that's that's right see and
[56:16] everything outside of God is a creation
[56:21] ain't that right everything outside of
[56:24] God is a creation so we're gonna maybe
[56:27] if I could look at it this way is that
[56:30] God is in control of everything but he's
[56:33] not making everybody be something that
[56:36] they're not to be
[56:38] and you say man
[56:40] as I've said before God could not make
[56:43] pharaoh to be a a Moses neither could he
[56:47] make Moses to be a pharaoh
[56:50] God already foresaw what they would be
[56:52] before the foundation of the world
[56:55] that's why Jacob could not be an Esau
[56:57] and Esau could not be a Jacob God did
[57:00] not try to make them be what they were
[57:02] not to be
[57:04] hello so therefore knowing that they
[57:07] would be this he ordained a part for
[57:10] them in in time
[57:14] hello
[57:15] to to play his purpose and his will
[57:20] now we find that everything outside of
[57:23] God is a creation God is infinite and he
[57:28] is self-existent one
[57:29] so there is no one that created God God
[57:33] was always
[57:35] everything else is a creation of God
[57:39] so then we look at this Colossians 1 and
[57:42] 16 it says for by him who God
[57:47] where all things created that are in
[57:50] heaven that are in Earth whether they're
[57:53] visible or invisible whether they be
[57:56] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[57:58] or Powers all things everybody say all
[58:01] things we're created by Him
[58:05] and for him
[58:07] so there's not nothing that was created
[58:09] just by by chance there there was
[58:13] nothing just randomly created everything
[58:16] was created by Him and for him
[58:20] for he has planned for his will whatever
[58:23] he's desired everything was created so
[58:27] the good and the bad were created by Him
[58:30] and for him light and darkness was
[58:34] created by Him and for him
[58:38] God tells us uh in Isaiah 45 and 6 as to
[58:42] why he created both now listen to this
[58:44] God says that they may know from the
[58:47] rising of the son and from the West that
[58:49] there is none besides me
[58:52] I am the lord and there is none else
[58:56] then you say Amen that they may know now
[58:59] notice that he wants us to know that
[59:01] there is none no other God beside him
[59:04] that he is the only one and there's
[59:06] nothing else there ain't that right so
[59:09] what does he do he says I form the light
[59:11] and create Darkness
[59:14] I make peace and create evil I the Lord
[59:18] do all of these things why that you may
[59:21] know that I am the lord and there is
[59:24] none else
[59:25] can you say amen amen well that that's
[59:28] true and and and then you go Isaiah 54
[59:31] and 16 God says behold I have created
[59:35] the Smith that bloweth the coals in the
[59:38] fire and that bringeth forth an
[59:40] instrument for his work and I have
[59:42] created the waster to destroy
[59:46] but notice what he says in the following
[59:48] verse no weapon that is formed against
[59:52] thee shall prosper
[59:54] every tongue that shall rise against
[59:57] thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn so
[1:00:01] he doesn't make the uh uh the good or
[1:00:04] the evil he doesn't he didn't create all
[1:00:07] of these things to destroy he created it
[1:00:10] that you may know that he is the god
[1:00:14] and that he's the only one can you say
[1:00:17] Amen
[1:00:18] see by his foreknowledge God knew
[1:00:21] what Satan would do and yet he created
[1:00:23] him
[1:00:25] by his foreknowledge God knew beforehand
[1:00:28] that Satan would cause men to fall and
[1:00:31] yet he created him you believe that the
[1:00:34] fall of Man was not a mistake the fall
[1:00:36] of Man Would did not leave God you know
[1:00:39] just a blindsiding god knew it would
[1:00:42] happen beforehand and yet he created
[1:00:46] God knew that Satan would bring sickness
[1:00:48] upon the Earth and yet he created him
[1:00:51] God knew that Satan would make us slaves
[1:00:54] uh uh his slaves and yet God created him
[1:00:58] God created Satan to be a contrast to
[1:01:02] what he himself is
[1:01:04] ain't that right Satan is a destroyer
[1:01:07] God is a builder Satan gives death God
[1:01:11] gives life
[1:01:13] ain't that right Satan works in the
[1:01:15] darkness God is light and he his works
[1:01:19] is light see so we find that that God
[1:01:22] needed something to contrast what he is
[1:01:26] for God Is A Healer do you believe that
[1:01:29] but he needs somebody to be sick so he
[1:01:31] could be Express himself as the Healer
[1:01:34] God is savior but he needed someone to
[1:01:37] be lost that he could show forth his
[1:01:40] power as a savior
[1:01:43] God is a mighty deliverer do you believe
[1:01:46] that that he needed somebody to need
[1:01:49] delivering somebody that would be bound
[1:01:51] amen and somebody to hold a power over
[1:01:55] his people that he could reach down and
[1:01:58] by the power of His Deliverance he could
[1:02:01] rescue them and now we know God as a
[1:02:04] deliverer
[1:02:06] ain't that right see so God has allowed
[1:02:09] the evil to exist so that he might show
[1:02:12] to his elect what he truly is and I say
[1:02:17] to you God is the only one
[1:02:19] he's still upon the throne we know him
[1:02:23] to be the mighty conqueror look at all
[1:02:25] the times that God has delivered you
[1:02:27] look at all the times that God has
[1:02:29] answered your prayer and he's healed you
[1:02:31] he's saved you he set you free and and
[1:02:34] all of these things isn't that wonderful
[1:02:37] amen but see as we wouldn't love God we
[1:02:40] wouldn't really know God for what he
[1:02:42] truly is if we didn't have our downside
[1:02:46] if we didn't have our mistakes we
[1:02:48] wouldn't know him as as one that could
[1:02:51] take a broken life and mend it all back
[1:02:54] over again
[1:02:56] but it took something to contrast what
[1:02:59] he was
[1:03:01] ain't that right
[1:03:03] see so God works everything after the
[1:03:06] Council of his own will
[1:03:09] and and Satan Satan cannot thwart the
[1:03:13] purpose of God or the plan of God do you
[1:03:16] believe that amen the Bible even says
[1:03:19] the foundation of God standeth Shore the
[1:03:22] Lord knoweth them that are his
[1:03:27] amen it's true does God give all men to
[1:03:31] repent he sure does but will all men
[1:03:34] repent absolutely not does that catch
[1:03:37] God by surprise no God already knew they
[1:03:40] wouldn't
[1:03:43] ain't that right
[1:03:45] so now
[1:03:46] this is what I'd like to speak on for a
[1:03:50] few more moments
[1:03:51] is even though we are the predestinated
[1:03:54] elect of God
[1:03:56] we all have a free will
[1:04:00] right
[1:04:02] predestination does not do away with
[1:04:05] free will
[1:04:07] and Free Will means that we have the
[1:04:10] right to choose
[1:04:12] to reject it's within us
[1:04:15] within our power
[1:04:17] to say I I want that and I don't want
[1:04:20] that
[1:04:21] that's why we have commercials today
[1:04:23] that's why you have your Billboards
[1:04:25] that's why you have all kinds of things
[1:04:27] ads
[1:04:29] trying to get you to choose their
[1:04:31] product
[1:04:33] they can't make you
[1:04:35] but if they can sway you enough
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:39] to look at their product and say man
[1:04:40] that looks good I think I'll get it
[1:04:43] well they didn't make you do it you've
[1:04:46] done it on your own
[1:04:49] ain't that right
[1:04:51] now if God if if God didn't give us a
[1:04:55] free will
[1:04:56] then I honestly I think it would be
[1:04:59] pretty easy life would just be easy
[1:05:02] no choices to make no decisions
[1:05:05] not nothing of right and wrong to look
[1:05:09] at it would always just be right
[1:05:12] we would just be under the command of
[1:05:13] God just to do it
[1:05:15] the sun automatically Rises and sets
[1:05:18] because his creator made it happen
[1:05:20] and said to do so
[1:05:22] that the Stars just come out at night
[1:05:24] and they're hanging in the air by the
[1:05:26] power of God's word
[1:05:28] they ain't got no choice about it they
[1:05:30] just they're there
[1:05:32] ain't that right
[1:05:33] see but we we have to make choices
[1:05:39] so predestination does not mean that we
[1:05:43] get to just to coast along in life
[1:05:46] well I'm predestinated so bless God
[1:05:49] I got it made
[1:05:51] well that that's fine
[1:05:56] but it doesn't take away your battles
[1:06:00] it doesn't take away the Warfare
[1:06:03] it doesn't take away the fact that
[1:06:05] Satan's out to get you and you've got to
[1:06:07] be on your toes
[1:06:10] ain't that right
[1:06:12] see so it doesn't mean predestination
[1:06:15] doesn't mean that we can do do anything
[1:06:18] we want to do
[1:06:19] because in the end we are predestinated
[1:06:22] to go to heaven
[1:06:24] that that that's that's not what
[1:06:26] predestination is
[1:06:28] some people say well you know one saved
[1:06:31] always saved and and they use that as a
[1:06:33] disgrace for a license to sin
[1:06:36] well I can go out and smoke and commit
[1:06:38] adultery and listen to Old Country Music
[1:06:40] and do this and do that bless God I'm
[1:06:42] saved
[1:06:43] that's that's that's not what God meant
[1:06:46] about predestination
[1:06:48] [Music]
[1:06:49] ain't that right see he foreknew that
[1:06:53] you would make a choice
[1:06:55] to serving
[1:06:59] so again predestination is based on the
[1:07:02] foreknowledge of God
[1:07:04] God knew before we were born what we
[1:07:08] would choose therefore he could
[1:07:11] predestinate based off his foreknowledge
[1:07:15] but in this life everybody say in this
[1:07:17] life
[1:07:18] now we come into the reality God saw it
[1:07:21] in his mind
[1:07:23] but now in this life
[1:07:25] is where he saw that we would make our
[1:07:27] choice
[1:07:28] in this life we still have choices to
[1:07:33] make
[1:07:37] amen
[1:07:39] see so
[1:07:43] his predestination didn't take away our
[1:07:45] choice
[1:07:47] but he knew what choice we would make
[1:07:49] therefore he predestinated
[1:07:52] but now you've got to make them choices
[1:07:57] Deuteronomy 30 19 it says I call Heaven
[1:08:00] and Earth to record this day against you
[1:08:03] that I have set before you life and
[1:08:06] death
[1:08:08] right
[1:08:09] blessings and cursing
[1:08:12] therefore choose life
[1:08:15] yes yes
[1:08:16] it's yours to make
[1:08:19] he sets it before all of us life and
[1:08:23] death
[1:08:24] blessings cursings
[1:08:28] ain't that right
[1:08:31] see that thou that that both thou and
[1:08:34] thy seed may live
[1:08:37] that thou mayest love the Lord thy God
[1:08:41] see love is something that whelms within
[1:08:45] us
[1:08:47] by a free moral agency
[1:08:52] amen amen it's something that we can
[1:08:55] feel it's
[1:08:58] so that thou mayest love the Lord thy
[1:09:01] God and that thou mayest obey his voice
[1:09:03] and that thou mayest cleave unto him
[1:09:06] for he is thy life
[1:09:10] so he sets himself before you
[1:09:13] for he is thy life
[1:09:15] and the length of thy days
[1:09:17] choices
[1:09:19] Joshua told Israel choose you this day
[1:09:22] whom you're going to serve
[1:09:23] ain't that right
[1:09:25] so so setting this predestination aside
[1:09:29] that's what God done by foreknowledge
[1:09:31] we're going to look at us now
[1:09:35] we've got choices to make
[1:09:39] life or death
[1:09:42] blessings or cursings
[1:09:47] right
[1:09:49] and making choices is not easy
[1:09:54] it's not an easy thing to do to make the
[1:09:57] right choice
[1:09:59] and you young people teenagers
[1:10:02] especially are finding this out
[1:10:05] you see we do not arrive at the finish
[1:10:09] line
[1:10:11] I just told you I I just told you our
[1:10:15] destination
[1:10:17] the Rapture the body change
[1:10:21] sitting at the table at the marriage
[1:10:23] supper of the Lamb
[1:10:25] coming to our end and I believe we're
[1:10:27] here the church is coming to its end
[1:10:30] I believe we as our lives there ain't
[1:10:33] too much time left
[1:10:35] amen right
[1:10:37] but see we do not arrive at this Finish
[1:10:40] Line in the same condition
[1:10:44] that we were in at our birth
[1:10:49] when we reach the Finish Line we are
[1:10:52] reflecting Jesus Christ
[1:10:54] that's his purpose that's his will
[1:10:57] when we come to the Finish Line we are
[1:10:59] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:11:02] When we arrive at this Finish Line we
[1:11:05] have perfect faith
[1:11:06] rapturing Faith right
[1:11:09] when we come to the Finish Line we have
[1:11:11] perfect love
[1:11:15] at the finish line
[1:11:17] or when we come to this Finish Line when
[1:11:19] we reach this Finish Line what are we
[1:11:21] we're capped with the Capstone
[1:11:25] when we come to the finish of our life
[1:11:28] see we we are matured wheat
[1:11:31] you believe that
[1:11:33] see something different than what we
[1:11:35] were at the beginning of our birth
[1:11:37] see we didn't start that way what we
[1:11:41] what we end up being is not what we
[1:11:44] started out being
[1:11:47] ain't that right
[1:11:48] for for and I hope this is okay but
[1:11:51] Psalms 51 5. David said uh behold I was
[1:11:55] shaping in iniquity and in sin did my
[1:11:58] mother conceive me
[1:11:59] as we said many times we came into this
[1:12:02] world speaking lies
[1:12:04] we we we were born with the carnal
[1:12:08] nature that was an enemy to God
[1:12:11] and this carnal nature could not be
[1:12:14] subject to the law of God could not come
[1:12:17] under the the God's headship
[1:12:20] ain't that right his word amen see we we
[1:12:24] were Rebels
[1:12:25] we had a nature to be a rebel
[1:12:28] we had a nature to go wrong all the time
[1:12:31] brother Brown said you take a child and
[1:12:33] you don't you don't teach him good or
[1:12:35] bad he'll take bad all the time every
[1:12:38] time because his nature so at at the
[1:12:42] very beginning of our birth we already
[1:12:45] had a bad start
[1:12:47] Satan already had a jump ahead over us
[1:12:51] in the sense that he we're in nature
[1:12:54] that would follow him
[1:12:57] we'd weak bite you know as a little kid
[1:12:59] never have to be taught you bite lie get
[1:13:03] mad throw Hissy Fits
[1:13:06] on and on and on
[1:13:08] because it was our nature to do so
[1:13:11] ain't that right
[1:13:13] so now notice though what the Apostle
[1:13:16] said in Romans 12 and 2.
[1:13:18] be not conformed to this world
[1:13:22] ain't that right look at that be not
[1:13:25] conformed to this world but yet we have
[1:13:28] everything within us to be conformed to
[1:13:31] this world
[1:13:32] everything about us wants to be
[1:13:34] conformed to this world our nature wants
[1:13:38] to be conformed to the world our our
[1:13:40] attitude wants to be conformed to the
[1:13:43] world our speech our eyes our hearing
[1:13:46] everything wants to be conformed to the
[1:13:49] world
[1:13:51] and you say Amen it leans to that way
[1:13:54] but yet here's a scripture that tells us
[1:13:56] don't be conformed to the world that's
[1:13:59] not God's will for you that's not God's
[1:14:01] plan for you
[1:14:05] but be ye transformed everybody say
[1:14:07] transformed
[1:14:09] see be transformed by the renewing of
[1:14:11] your mind that you may prove what is
[1:14:14] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:14:17] will of God
[1:14:19] amen or somebody that's going to prove
[1:14:22] it
[1:14:24] ain't that right
[1:14:27] see we got we got today Christians
[1:14:29] so-called Christians
[1:14:31] there ain't no change in them
[1:14:34] there ain't nothing wrong uh that's
[1:14:36] happened in their lives Christians
[1:14:38] singing in the choir preaching behind
[1:14:40] the pulpit still smoking her cigarettes
[1:14:42] chewing their tobacco taking their
[1:14:45] social drinks
[1:14:50] then you say Amen
[1:14:52] see that autodimic nature trying to fit
[1:14:55] in in a religion or in Christendom
[1:14:59] but still being conformed to this world
[1:15:07] this word conformed because it says be
[1:15:09] not conformed to this world
[1:15:11] the word conform means to Fashion alike
[1:15:13] conform to the same pattern
[1:15:16] so every individual
[1:15:19] the Bible even says there's nothing new
[1:15:21] Under Heaven nothing
[1:15:23] why because every one of us is born with
[1:15:25] the adamic nature
[1:15:27] at Old carnal sinful nature we the only
[1:15:31] thing is it's getting more evil
[1:15:34] that old same nature that's that was in
[1:15:36] the generations uh uh uh in Jesus's time
[1:15:41] is the same nature today
[1:15:43] problem is we've made more room for sin
[1:15:47] it's more easier to sin
[1:15:50] got it on our phones got it on our
[1:15:52] computers got it on all these other
[1:15:54] things used to you couldn't look at
[1:15:57] pornography unless you went to an adult
[1:15:58] store now it's on the phone now it's in
[1:16:00] your home now it's wherever you want to
[1:16:02] go
[1:16:03] you can dig in as far as you want to go
[1:16:06] but what is it it's a sinful nature
[1:16:10] but here we're the Bible is telling us
[1:16:12] be not conformed to this world
[1:16:17] so then you know what that means he set
[1:16:19] before his life and deaths and you've
[1:16:22] got to make your choice
[1:16:24] choices are hard
[1:16:29] you see because it says be transformed
[1:16:32] and
[1:16:33] changed
[1:16:35] change from one thing to another
[1:16:38] change from a sinner to a saint
[1:16:40] changed right
[1:16:42] Earthbound Heaven bound changed
[1:16:45] transformed
[1:16:46] and this transformation happens by the
[1:16:49] choices you make
[1:16:52] hello
[1:16:53] you say oh it's going to happen by my
[1:16:54] predestination he predestinated you
[1:16:57] because he knew the choice you would
[1:16:58] make
[1:16:59] now you're here upon this Earth for a
[1:17:01] limited time to make your battles
[1:17:04] you're going to be tried and proven
[1:17:09] I hope it's all right
[1:17:13] see God sent his word by way of a
[1:17:16] Vindicated prophet
[1:17:19] and I pray to God that we've all made
[1:17:21] that choice to follow
[1:17:25] the message that he brought
[1:17:27] now notice notice we had a choice not to
[1:17:30] just listen to the message not just to
[1:17:32] listen to that prophet but we had to we
[1:17:35] had to make a choice with it
[1:17:38] Revelations 18 4 and I heard another
[1:17:40] voice from Heaven saying come out of her
[1:17:42] my people
[1:17:44] don't sit there and listen to it and
[1:17:46] then stay there
[1:17:47] and remain you've got to make your
[1:17:49] choice to come out
[1:17:51] can you say Amen come out of her my
[1:17:54] people that you being not partakers of
[1:17:57] her sins and that you receive none of
[1:17:59] her plagues do you realize that you're
[1:18:01] very my new people that have made their
[1:18:03] choice to come out there's thousands of
[1:18:06] people that have heard the same message
[1:18:08] and refused to come out
[1:18:10] that God knew you would make a choice
[1:18:13] that choice has cost you
[1:18:16] it has cost you family it's cost you
[1:18:19] popularity it's it's it's it's called
[1:18:21] names to be put upon you as an occult as
[1:18:24] a man follower and everything else
[1:18:27] but you made the choice
[1:18:30] to come out
[1:18:33] ain't that right
[1:18:36] now what if what what if we hadn't made
[1:18:39] the choice to come out
[1:18:40] would still be enslaved
[1:18:43] do the teachings and traditions of men
[1:18:46] there wouldn't have been a change take
[1:18:48] place within us
[1:18:50] but because we made the choice
[1:18:53] ain't that right that choice was hard
[1:18:59] when we heard about the Holy Ghost
[1:19:00] coming and living inside of men
[1:19:04] we had to make a choice to receive it or
[1:19:08] walk away from it
[1:19:10] I've known preachers that have seen
[1:19:12] Baptist preachers actually
[1:19:15] that were very well known among the
[1:19:17] native Indian people as a Baptist
[1:19:20] preacher
[1:19:21] he saw that the Holy Ghost was right
[1:19:25] he saw it he sat there and talked with
[1:19:27] my dad and and and and the pastor
[1:19:30] talk to him says I know you're it's
[1:19:32] right I want it
[1:19:35] but I can't
[1:19:37] because the church will kick me out
[1:19:41] see these choices Ain't Easy
[1:19:46] man tells us that the Holy Ghost is a
[1:19:48] good feeling or a sensation that you get
[1:19:52] but the prophet told us it's the life of
[1:19:53] God that comes inside of us
[1:19:56] now we had to make the choice
[1:19:58] either to take what man says what the
[1:20:00] Holy Ghost is or take what a prophet
[1:20:02] said the Holy Ghost is
[1:20:04] we had to make the choice do we stop
[1:20:06] with the sensation do we stop with a
[1:20:08] good feeling do we stop with the dance
[1:20:10] or do we go all the way until we know
[1:20:13] that we know that we know that we've got
[1:20:15] it
[1:20:16] not just on our spirit but on our inner
[1:20:19] soul
[1:20:20] can you say Amen Jesus said about the
[1:20:22] Holy Ghost in Acts 1 8 you shall receive
[1:20:25] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[1:20:27] upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto
[1:20:30] me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea
[1:20:32] and Samara and unto the outermost parts
[1:20:34] of the earth ain't that right
[1:20:37] see you shall receive power no power
[1:20:40] until you get the Holy Ghost
[1:20:42] that right can't be Witnesses of him
[1:20:45] until you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:20:46] well what if we had made the choice to
[1:20:49] believe what men said about it there
[1:20:51] would have never been a transformation
[1:20:56] ain't that right
[1:20:58] what if we made the choice to walk away
[1:21:00] when we heard about the salvation that
[1:21:02] Jesus Christ had to offer
[1:21:05] where would we be
[1:21:07] what what what if we believed what man
[1:21:10] said about salvation you're saved when
[1:21:12] you join our denomination or saved when
[1:21:15] you shake the preacher's hand or or when
[1:21:17] you when you put your name up on on a on
[1:21:21] a card or a roll or you you repeat us a
[1:21:24] certain Creed
[1:21:27] right but something within our heart
[1:21:29] told us
[1:21:31] that what the Bible says about it is the
[1:21:33] truth
[1:21:34] and we accepted it repent be baptized
[1:21:38] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:21:39] Christ and you shall receive the the
[1:21:42] gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:44] that's the formula to Salvation
[1:21:49] see so we made our choice to believe the
[1:21:51] Bible and God knew you would make that
[1:21:54] choice
[1:21:58] all throughout our lifetime
[1:22:02] we will have to make choices
[1:22:05] I want to tell you young people this
[1:22:10] you're going to have to make your
[1:22:11] choices
[1:22:14] and as you're growing up
[1:22:16] you're realizing how difficult they are
[1:22:21] you're understanding what Mom and Dad
[1:22:23] and preacher and everyone had had to go
[1:22:26] through
[1:22:28] and we still have to make our choices no
[1:22:30] matter how old we are
[1:22:34] just because you follow chose to follow
[1:22:36] the message of this day doesn't mean
[1:22:38] that you can just Coast the rest of the
[1:22:40] way until you get to heaven
[1:22:42] and and I'll tell you why because the
[1:22:45] following scripture that I read to you
[1:22:47] gives this an example and that's in
[1:22:49] second Thessalonians 2 1.
[1:22:52] now we beseech you Brethren by the
[1:22:54] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by
[1:22:56] our gathering together unto him
[1:22:59] that ye be that ye be not soon shaken in
[1:23:03] mind
[1:23:04] shaken
[1:23:07] or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by
[1:23:09] word nor by letter as from us as that
[1:23:12] the day of Christ is at hand let no man
[1:23:15] deceive you by any means
[1:23:18] [Music]
[1:23:20] for that day shall not come except there
[1:23:23] come a what Falling Away first
[1:23:28] and that man of sin be revealed the Son
[1:23:30] of Perdition so this tells us right away
[1:23:33] the people will start start out
[1:23:35] following what's truth
[1:23:38] start out following
[1:23:40] they'll go so far
[1:23:42] but then they're going to fall away
[1:23:45] right they make the choice to follow but
[1:23:47] somewhere in that choice it wasn't true
[1:23:50] then they start listening they make the
[1:23:53] choices start hanging around unbelievers
[1:23:55] start listening to this and start
[1:23:57] listening to that start listening to
[1:23:59] those that question and throw questions
[1:24:00] and they start trying to reason with it
[1:24:02] they start trying to and before you know
[1:24:04] it they for feeling exactly what God
[1:24:06] said they would they would fall away
[1:24:10] ain't that right
[1:24:12] so you you you cannot afford to Coast
[1:24:19] in First Corinthians 9 24 Paul explains
[1:24:22] it like this he says know ye not that
[1:24:24] they which run a race would run in a
[1:24:27] race run all
[1:24:29] all run
[1:24:31] everybody that's in that race is all are
[1:24:33] running
[1:24:34] but one everybody say one receive at the
[1:24:37] prize
[1:24:38] so run everybody say run
[1:24:41] run that you may obtain
[1:24:44] run
[1:24:45] not because your friends are running
[1:24:48] run not because everybody says it's a
[1:24:50] good thing to do
[1:24:51] run not because it's a sunny day
[1:24:54] run that you may obtain
[1:25:01] now notice what he says and every man
[1:25:03] that striveth for the Mastery is
[1:25:07] temperate in all things
[1:25:10] choices
[1:25:12] choices
[1:25:14] right
[1:25:15] every man that Strife is for the Mastery
[1:25:18] is temperate in all things now they do
[1:25:20] it to obtain a corruptable crown
[1:25:23] or a corruptable trophy
[1:25:25] something that they can put on their
[1:25:27] fireplace something they can put around
[1:25:29] their neck some kind of achievement of
[1:25:31] Ward
[1:25:33] but we do it for an Incorruptible crown
[1:25:38] a reward that's incorruptible
[1:25:40] a reward that will not fade away so we
[1:25:44] make our choices because we understand
[1:25:46] what we're striving for
[1:25:51] this word temperate means to exercise
[1:25:53] self-restraint
[1:25:58] and in this day
[1:26:01] this generation
[1:26:03] one thing they lack is self-restraint
[1:26:06] if it feels good they do it
[1:26:09] they want to do it they just do it
[1:26:12] and it's like they're Unleashed
[1:26:15] to do whatever they want no restraint
[1:26:18] but you got to have self-restraint
[1:26:20] when you're walking with God Amen
[1:26:23] because there's choices
[1:26:28] one might claim to be sealed with the
[1:26:30] Holy Ghost
[1:26:32] we understand Paul there in Ephesians 4
[1:26:34] 30 tells us that the holy spirit is a
[1:26:37] seal
[1:26:38] says grief not
[1:26:40] the holy spirit of God whereby you're
[1:26:42] sealed unto the day of redemption
[1:26:45] but I will say this God will not give
[1:26:47] someone the Holy Ghost
[1:26:49] that ain't going to obey his word
[1:26:53] he doesn't do it by chance he doesn't do
[1:26:55] it half-blind
[1:26:57] it's not a blind date
[1:27:01] it's not guesswork
[1:27:03] well I'll give him the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:04] see what happens
[1:27:06] him by foreknowledge knew
[1:27:09] can you say man
[1:27:11] therefore he predestinated to give you
[1:27:13] the Holy Ghost
[1:27:17] and we know what the Holy Ghost is for
[1:27:19] Jesus said in John 16 13 how be it when
[1:27:23] he the spirit of Truth the Holy Spirit
[1:27:26] when he the spirit of Truth has come he
[1:27:28] will guide you into all truth
[1:27:31] now is there everything you're going to
[1:27:33] know is all truth
[1:27:36] no
[1:27:37] you're going to hear all kinds of
[1:27:38] reports
[1:27:41] if if it'd be it'd be nice if we just
[1:27:44] had blinders like the horse does you
[1:27:46] know they put them blinders on a horse
[1:27:47] so they can keep better control of him
[1:27:50] so I ain't looking to the left and ain't
[1:27:52] looking to the right he ain't seen all
[1:27:53] the glamor and all these things
[1:27:56] so we can keep him straight on track
[1:27:58] but for us Satan shows us everything
[1:28:01] that's out there
[1:28:03] amen you heard the truth now you're
[1:28:06] going to hear a bunch of lies that sound
[1:28:07] like truth
[1:28:08] you heard the truth now you're gonna
[1:28:10] you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna
[1:28:12] see these enticing spirits that are all
[1:28:14] around
[1:28:15] and you have to make the choice
[1:28:23] you have to make the choice the Holy
[1:28:25] Ghost will be the one to lead you
[1:28:28] and and if you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:28:30] will be led
[1:28:32] but they that have the Holy Ghost will
[1:28:34] have to make choices to walk in all
[1:28:37] truth
[1:28:38] you have to make choices you believe
[1:28:40] that can you say that with me I have to
[1:28:43] make choices to walk in all truth
[1:28:48] it isn't just hand it to me truth is
[1:28:50] given to you but you have to make the
[1:28:52] choice to walk in all truth
[1:28:55] you have to make that choice to pray you
[1:28:57] have to make that choice to dedicate you
[1:28:59] have to make that choice to concentrate
[1:29:01] your life to God you have to make these
[1:29:03] choices
[1:29:06] all right come on man look Amos 3 3 can
[1:29:10] two walk together except they be agreed
[1:29:12] you know what he's telling you you
[1:29:14] cannot walk two people cannot walk
[1:29:16] together except they be agreed husband
[1:29:18] and wife cannot walk together except
[1:29:20] they be agreed
[1:29:24] it's true
[1:29:26] got to be an agreement
[1:29:28] second Corinthians 6 14 be not be ye not
[1:29:31] unequally yoked with unbelievers for
[1:29:33] what Fellowship haths righteousness with
[1:29:35] unrighteousness what communion has light
[1:29:37] with darkness and what Concord hath
[1:29:40] Christ with Belial or what part has he
[1:29:43] that believeth with an Infidel what
[1:29:46] agreement hath the temple of God with
[1:29:47] Idols for you are the Temple of the
[1:29:51] Living God
[1:29:52] as God has said I will dwell in them and
[1:29:56] walk in them and I will be their God and
[1:29:58] they shall be my people wherefore come
[1:30:01] out from among them and be separate
[1:30:03] saith the Lord and don't touch that
[1:30:06] unclean thing and I will receive you
[1:30:10] and you say Amen
[1:30:12] so we have to make the choices
[1:30:16] the word of God which is the will of God
[1:30:19] is set before us and then we choose to
[1:30:21] walk in that
[1:30:22] and again
[1:30:24] I may be repeating myself but just
[1:30:27] because God foreknew what choice we
[1:30:28] would make
[1:30:30] does it mean that our choices will be
[1:30:32] easy
[1:30:35] to make
[1:30:38] see we are a human and have a carnal
[1:30:40] sinful nature that we have to deal with
[1:30:42] I'm going to try to hurry
[1:30:44] but Romans 7 14 and I I trust you're
[1:30:47] listening to me and hope we're getting
[1:30:50] it to you
[1:30:51] but Romans 7 14 for we know that the law
[1:30:54] is spiritual but I am carnal sold under
[1:30:56] sin
[1:30:59] for that which I do I allow not for what
[1:31:02] I do
[1:31:03] that I do not
[1:31:05] or that I that do I not
[1:31:07] but what I hate that I do
[1:31:11] if then I do that which I would not I
[1:31:14] can send them to the law that is good
[1:31:16] now then it is no more I that do it but
[1:31:19] sin that dwelleth in me
[1:31:22] brother Branham interprets this
[1:31:24] scripture to be he says in other words
[1:31:26] Paul is saying in me are two persons
[1:31:31] one wants to do right and the other one
[1:31:33] wants me to do wrong
[1:31:35] every time I start to do right wrong
[1:31:37] hinders me
[1:31:38] have you ever had that
[1:31:40] we all struggle with it
[1:31:43] and I know you young people you struggle
[1:31:45] with it you may not understand
[1:31:46] everything that that is going on well
[1:31:48] Paul is telling you
[1:31:51] you say well I thought I had the Holy
[1:31:52] Ghost well you can have the Holy Ghost
[1:31:54] but it doesn't take away your choices
[1:31:57] it doesn't and he's telling you here
[1:32:00] that it does not it does not make you a
[1:32:02] total
[1:32:03] if you you know you forgive me if if you
[1:32:06] don't agree but it doesn't make you a
[1:32:08] total God man
[1:32:10] you still got a human element about you
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:14] you got to deal with your human nature
[1:32:16] you got to deal with your human desires
[1:32:19] if if we had none of that there would be
[1:32:21] no Temptations
[1:32:22] there would be no trying of our faith
[1:32:24] there would be nothing there we'd just
[1:32:26] be like God and and and nothing to be
[1:32:29] tempted right
[1:32:32] so brother Brandon goes on he says you
[1:32:34] are an outward man which is controlled
[1:32:36] by six senses which we know
[1:32:39] he corrects that later five senses you
[1:32:42] are an inward man controlled by one
[1:32:44] sense which is Faith and this Faith
[1:32:47] disagrees with all five senses if the
[1:32:49] five senses doesn't agree with faith
[1:32:52] but one is contrary to the other as long
[1:32:54] as the five senses agree with the faith
[1:32:57] wonderful
[1:32:58] seeing the five senses smell taste fill
[1:33:01] here
[1:33:02] see a thing I got it all see that's
[1:33:05] that's what this is your five senses but
[1:33:07] then if they disagree with that sense of
[1:33:10] faith
[1:33:11] then then don't listen to your five
[1:33:13] senses
[1:33:16] he said one is contrary to the other he
[1:33:18] says but when the five senses disagrees
[1:33:20] with faith then
[1:33:22] leave the five senses alone
[1:33:25] now for instance here Jesus made a
[1:33:27] statement a promise the inside man says
[1:33:29] that's true God makes that statement he
[1:33:32] makes a promise the inside man says
[1:33:34] that's right that's true the outman
[1:33:36] outside man reasons and says it cannot
[1:33:39] be true to you
[1:33:41] then then ignore the outside man and
[1:33:44] accept the Insight man
[1:33:46] make that choice now that's the same
[1:33:48] thing that Paul's speaking of he was
[1:33:50] sold under the law to carnal sin every
[1:33:52] one of us is the same way that's the
[1:33:54] reason we have troubles the way we do of
[1:33:56] married four or five times and this and
[1:33:58] that and all kinds of sin and adulches
[1:34:00] and everything else along in our lives
[1:34:02] is because of those things we are carnal
[1:34:04] and that part must perish
[1:34:06] and then inside we are a spirit Man soul
[1:34:09] inside see and that's faith in God's
[1:34:11] word then we bring our outside body
[1:34:15] under subjection to the word by Faith by
[1:34:18] accepting what God Said
[1:34:23] God make that choice
[1:34:26] how can I take a Cocker Burr and make a
[1:34:28] grain of wheat out of it it's impossible
[1:34:29] for for me to do it the only way it can
[1:34:32] be done is because inside that cocklebur
[1:34:35] has been transmitted from cockleberry
[1:34:37] wheat uh a word to it uh cockle
[1:34:40] bird to a germ called we laugh
[1:34:42] then you bury that cocklebur it'll
[1:34:44] produce a grain of wheat because there
[1:34:47] has been a life of wheat put in that
[1:34:49] Cocker bar and the life of the kookabur
[1:34:52] has been taken out but the nature of
[1:34:54] that cocklebur is still sticky and it
[1:34:56] will be until this new life has fully
[1:34:58] been developed out of the ground and
[1:34:59] raised up again when it comes forth it
[1:35:02] then it's no more a cockle bird but a
[1:35:04] wheat
[1:35:06] but while it's here on Earth see and in
[1:35:09] out of the earth and the caucouper it's
[1:35:11] still sticky but it's got the nature of
[1:35:13] the inside of it the of Wheat and as
[1:35:16] long as you're in this life you're going
[1:35:18] to be sticky and have a carnal nature
[1:35:20] that's bothering going to bother you as
[1:35:21] long as you live but the inside of you
[1:35:24] you're born again
[1:35:26] and when you're raised up you're in the
[1:35:28] likeness of Christ and all the sin is
[1:35:30] gone from you ain't that right
[1:35:32] brother Graham talks about that Indian
[1:35:33] chief that got converted and after a
[1:35:36] while uh you know later on someone asked
[1:35:39] that Indian chief you know how he's
[1:35:41] doing he said well me good and me bad
[1:35:43] and he said well what does that supposed
[1:35:45] to mean he said well I got I got like
[1:35:47] two dogs you know uh uh fighting Within
[1:35:50] Me one's a white dog and one's a black
[1:35:51] dog and oh really you know and he said
[1:35:54] well well who's who's winning Chief and
[1:35:56] he's well that all depends what I feed
[1:35:58] the most
[1:35:59] yeah whatever dog I'm feeding then then
[1:36:02] that's what's going to overcome that's
[1:36:04] what's going to rule me
[1:36:06] are you with me now
[1:36:07] yes sir see so so you having the Holy
[1:36:11] Ghost you
[1:36:12] cannot just feed off of anything and
[1:36:15] grow in a spiritual Realm you cannot
[1:36:18] grow yet no we're striving at the end to
[1:36:22] be just like him but you've got to make
[1:36:23] choices amen now to get there
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:31] gotta make them choices
[1:36:34] having a problem with your phone get off
[1:36:36] the stupid phone
[1:36:38] I know the world's got it all set up
[1:36:40] he's got traps for us
[1:36:42] he's got all kinds of traps to get us
[1:36:45] away from the real thing that in the
[1:36:47] reality we are Christians
[1:36:50] and we must live like Christians choose
[1:36:52] talk
[1:36:54] whatever like Christians
[1:36:58] now see so brother Branham he says see
[1:37:01] that's a good answer it depends on which
[1:37:04] one you cater to which nature you cater
[1:37:07] to the Nate the carnal nature after the
[1:37:10] things of the world or the spiritual
[1:37:11] nature after the things of God see so
[1:37:14] there is always a wrestling
[1:37:17] and I I'm gonna let you go here but
[1:37:19] there's always a wrestling when it comes
[1:37:21] to us choosing to walk in the will of
[1:37:23] God
[1:37:24] and yet and yet you are a predestinated
[1:37:27] son and daughter of God
[1:37:29] think of that
[1:37:31] yeah and yet as a predestinated Son of
[1:37:34] God I've still wore
[1:37:38] Within Me
[1:37:40] that God already knew that I would
[1:37:43] overcome
[1:37:45] but he didn't take the battles away from
[1:37:47] me he didn't take the struggles away
[1:37:49] from me but by his foreknowledge he saw
[1:37:52] that I'd make them choices he saw that I
[1:37:55] would wrestle it out
[1:37:59] you say man
[1:38:01] we find Jesus was predestinated to be
[1:38:03] what he was the Lamb of God he was
[1:38:05] predestinated to do what he did
[1:38:08] but you know what he had to wrestle it
[1:38:10] out
[1:38:12] he had to surrender his own will to the
[1:38:14] will of the father
[1:38:16] that's right you believe that
[1:38:18] remember when he said there in Luke 22
[1:38:20] and and uh says that when he was at the
[1:38:24] place he said unto them his disciples
[1:38:26] pray that ye enter not into temptation
[1:38:28] and he was withdrawn from them about a
[1:38:30] stone's cast
[1:38:32] and kneeled down and prayed and sang
[1:38:34] father if thou be willing remove this
[1:38:37] cup from me you talking about a struggle
[1:38:40] if you're willing remove this thing from
[1:38:42] me nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:38:46] done
[1:38:47] and there appeared an angel from unto
[1:38:50] him unto him from Heaven strengthening
[1:38:52] him and being in an Agony he prayed more
[1:38:56] earnestly
[1:38:58] think of that now he didn't just get up
[1:39:01] it wasn't a five-minute prayer
[1:39:05] he was wrestling it out
[1:39:08] being in agony he prayed more earnestly
[1:39:11] and his sweat was as it were great drops
[1:39:13] of blood falling down to the ground
[1:39:15] brother Brown said it was one of the
[1:39:17] most greatest victories that Christ ever
[1:39:20] won or proved his great Messiah ship as
[1:39:23] when he said to God not my will but
[1:39:26] thine be done that was the greatest
[1:39:28] Victory he ever won all the Demons of
[1:39:31] Torment around him to tempt him and to
[1:39:33] try him but he overcome
[1:39:37] made the choice
[1:39:42] amen
[1:39:43] Galatians 1 4 Paul says speaking of
[1:39:46] Christ that he gave himself for our sins
[1:39:48] that he might Deliver Us from this
[1:39:50] present evil War evil world according
[1:39:53] everybody say according to the wheel of
[1:39:56] God and our father
[1:39:59] so he had to he had to wrestle it out
[1:40:01] the Apostle Paul he told us that he was
[1:40:04] called from his mother's womb to preach
[1:40:06] the gospel to the Gentiles
[1:40:08] he he was he he was called to be an
[1:40:11] apostle of Jesus Christ through the will
[1:40:12] of God in other places he said and then
[1:40:14] he tells us I Die daily
[1:40:17] I Die daily
[1:40:19] so it was a constant choice
[1:40:23] it was a constant Warfare he didn't
[1:40:26] Coast
[1:40:27] one of the greatest men uh uh in the in
[1:40:32] in in the church ages
[1:40:34] uh uh to set the the foundation
[1:40:41] and and every man after that all the
[1:40:43] Angels seven angels after that had to
[1:40:45] build according to that
[1:40:48] he placed that and it looked like his
[1:40:51] life would have been easy
[1:40:53] him knowing that he was an apostle uh by
[1:40:56] the will of God him knowing what he was
[1:40:59] called to do and yet he had the war and
[1:41:03] wrestle it out
[1:41:05] on a daily basis but you know God knew
[1:41:08] he would do that
[1:41:10] I believe
[1:41:12] that God makes it clear very clear
[1:41:16] to us what is death and what is life I
[1:41:20] believe that
[1:41:22] I believe that God makes it clear to us
[1:41:24] as to what his will is for us
[1:41:29] but
[1:41:31] our sticky nature gets in the way many
[1:41:33] times
[1:41:35] and causes us not to see the will of God
[1:41:38] clearly
[1:41:41] our own Ambitions our own desires
[1:41:45] our own Cravings that that that human
[1:41:48] side of us we know what the will of God
[1:41:51] is
[1:41:55] but our own ambitions
[1:41:58] this whole flesh causes us not to see
[1:42:01] clearly
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:07] we know we know we shouldn't do it
[1:42:11] sure looks good and we'll explain every
[1:42:14] reason why we should do it
[1:42:19] and it's because we've not died to
[1:42:21] ourself
[1:42:25] I want to say this that not every
[1:42:27] decision that we make is going to be the
[1:42:29] right one
[1:42:31] sometimes we get ahead of God and we do
[1:42:33] our own thing instead of waiting on him
[1:42:35] to work things out
[1:42:37] oftentimes we get so carnal that we
[1:42:39] yield to our own lusts instead of
[1:42:41] yielding ourselves to God
[1:42:43] in these times that God corrects us
[1:42:46] we find ourselves if we could set this
[1:42:49] way on our backside
[1:42:51] high and dry
[1:42:53] the blessings of God ain't there the
[1:42:56] anointing of God isn't there
[1:42:58] it's kind of like Abraham when he went
[1:43:00] left the the Homeland and went down to
[1:43:02] Egypt
[1:43:04] he backslid Prophet said he showed him
[1:43:06] back he was backslidden leaving the
[1:43:08] Homeland to go down to Egypt got himself
[1:43:11] in trouble did he not
[1:43:13] now the prophet said see he shouldn't
[1:43:15] have been in Egypt but he went
[1:43:18] but
[1:43:20] he did not lose the Covenant
[1:43:24] he lost the blessings of the Covenant
[1:43:28] while he was in Egypt
[1:43:30] didn't you say man
[1:43:32] no it was a mistake but God spared him
[1:43:36] did he not
[1:43:37] he spared Sarah's life he spared him
[1:43:41] and brought him back
[1:43:44] but he got himself in the heap of
[1:43:46] trouble many times by us making the
[1:43:48] wrong decisions we lose the blessings of
[1:43:50] the Covenant but we don't lose the
[1:43:51] Covenant
[1:43:53] and then our failures the blood of Jesus
[1:43:55] has been provided as an atonement for us
[1:44:00] the prophet said now you will do wrong
[1:44:02] but you don't do it willfully you're
[1:44:04] trapped and anything you're trapped into
[1:44:06] or do something that you don't mean to
[1:44:08] do it it's not sin yet you'll repent the
[1:44:11] minute you see that you're wrong
[1:44:13] and you'll turn quickly and say I didn't
[1:44:15] mean it I didn't see that you'll say
[1:44:17] that all through life
[1:44:18] men don't want to be that's the reason
[1:44:21] we're so stupid and so and dark down
[1:44:23] here on Earth that there's a blood
[1:44:24] atonement for us all the time to keep us
[1:44:27] covered
[1:44:28] I mean thank God for the blood
[1:44:30] I thank God for the blood
[1:44:33] that I want to say it this way that
[1:44:35] doesn't mean to say well then shoot I'm
[1:44:37] just going to live my life and the blood
[1:44:39] of Christ still covers me you'll pay for
[1:44:41] every mistake you make
[1:44:44] can I say that again you're going to pay
[1:44:47] for the mistakes
[1:44:49] we pay for our disobediences
[1:44:55] Galatians 6 and 7 says be not deceived
[1:44:58] God is Not mocked for whatsoever man
[1:45:00] soweth that shall he also reap
[1:45:03] for he that soweth to his flesh shall
[1:45:04] reap of the flesh reap corruption but he
[1:45:07] that soweth through the spiritual of the
[1:45:08] spirit reap everlasting life
[1:45:11] amen
[1:45:13] amen now sometimes we may have to pay a
[1:45:16] great price
[1:45:17] for the decisions we make
[1:45:20] but I want to tell you
[1:45:23] and I I pray to God that the Lord will
[1:45:26] just help plant these in in your spirit
[1:45:29] your soul
[1:45:32] but our decisions can set us back
[1:45:37] in God
[1:45:39] our progress it can hurt our ministry
[1:45:42] it can hurt our influence with people
[1:45:45] it can hurt us in the kingdom of God by
[1:45:49] our decisions
[1:45:50] that's why we we can't just float along
[1:45:54] in life
[1:45:59] our decisions can be a detriment to us
[1:46:02] in our work for the kingdom of God most
[1:46:04] of all our decisions can haunt us for
[1:46:07] the rest of our lives
[1:46:11] this is why we cannot make decisions
[1:46:13] lightly
[1:46:16] we see that Abraham just for an example
[1:46:18] Abraham chose to listen to Sarah and he
[1:46:22] went into Hagar
[1:46:24] total outside of God's Will It produced
[1:46:27] an Ishmael
[1:46:29] he got ahead of God's program
[1:46:32] went outside God's will right
[1:46:35] his actions now his his actions did not
[1:46:38] change God's mind
[1:46:39] God said that him and Sarah was going to
[1:46:41] have a son
[1:46:42] and God meant it that wouldn't change
[1:46:47] but through Abraham's choices of getting
[1:46:51] out of God's will
[1:46:53] he produced an Ishmael
[1:46:56] right
[1:47:00] now that didn't change the Covenant with
[1:47:03] Abraham God made an unconditional
[1:47:05] Covenant
[1:47:06] but Ishmael never went away either
[1:47:09] Ishmael until this day has remained a
[1:47:13] thorn in Israel's side
[1:47:18] and you say man
[1:47:20] and he actually become a great nation
[1:47:24] but it was outside the will of God
[1:47:27] David a man after God's Own Heart
[1:47:30] anointed to be king over Israel but he
[1:47:31] made a bad choice
[1:47:34] he looked at a man's wife
[1:47:36] had him killed married her
[1:47:40] right
[1:47:41] the Bible tells us he paid dearly for
[1:47:43] what he did
[1:47:45] every time in the Bible when a a man of
[1:47:48] God or a person makes a bad choice they
[1:47:51] pay dearly
[1:47:52] God's going to bring that correction
[1:47:56] and you say man but he makes it all work
[1:47:58] out for his own good
[1:48:00] so what what I'm trying to tell you and
[1:48:02] and is is you you young people you know
[1:48:05] see our choices are rewarded
[1:48:08] both good and bad
[1:48:10] can you say man
[1:48:12] and and a lot of our choices does not
[1:48:15] touch us about doesn't touch us whether
[1:48:18] we're hinge on whether we're going to
[1:48:19] heaven or not
[1:48:21] our choices will hinge on what happens
[1:48:24] here
[1:48:26] I've seen men make the bad choices that
[1:48:28] takes them out of pulpits
[1:48:30] and the gift Still Remains in them
[1:48:34] but they they've wasted their Ministry
[1:48:37] by the bad choice they made
[1:48:44] come on yeah
[1:48:46] men that are called to be deacons men
[1:48:48] that you know and even even women called
[1:48:51] to be Preachers Wives
[1:48:54] or to help and all these things they get
[1:48:57] they get so messed up
[1:49:00] does it change their destination I don't
[1:49:03] think so
[1:49:06] but what it does it makes it it makes
[1:49:08] misery
[1:49:10] they can't fulfill exactly what God's
[1:49:12] called them to do
[1:49:19] the same man
[1:49:22] you say I love God I know there's people
[1:49:24] that love God
[1:49:25] there's men that are preachers that have
[1:49:27] made their mistakes can't even stand now
[1:49:29] can't even get behind the pulpit
[1:49:30] according to the word of God and they
[1:49:32] love God
[1:49:33] they've repented
[1:49:38] but they sold it
[1:49:39] they made the choice
[1:49:43] and all this life whether they live to
[1:49:45] be 80 to 100.
[1:49:47] that gift is within them
[1:49:50] and they'll just they'll just long to be
[1:49:52] back in a Pulpit that they can't be in I
[1:49:54] hope you understand you young people you
[1:49:57] have not messed up your lives in any way
[1:49:59] sure you've made minor mistakes sure
[1:50:01] you're this and and you're going to make
[1:50:03] plenty of them every one of us does it
[1:50:05] this preacher does it
[1:50:07] and we all regret it and we all pay for
[1:50:09] it there's not a one of us here that
[1:50:12] have that have have looked back in our
[1:50:15] life without regret and say man I wish I
[1:50:17] would have done something different
[1:50:18] right
[1:50:22] but I want to tell you
[1:50:23] as long as God tarries there's going to
[1:50:26] be preachers we're going to need
[1:50:27] preachers stand and take this place
[1:50:31] you with me
[1:50:32] we're going to need this Young
[1:50:34] Generation to rise up to what God has
[1:50:36] called him to be and be fervent but
[1:50:38] don't you let Satan mess your life up
[1:50:41] by wrong choices
[1:50:49] don't cruise through life
[1:50:52] living life just for fun
[1:50:56] I said well I'm predestinated glory to
[1:50:57] God you know
[1:50:59] it'll all work out
[1:51:01] the thing is you've got to make the
[1:51:03] choices life and death is before you
[1:51:08] you ministers just as much
[1:51:12] you
[1:51:14] God's called you to preach the gospel
[1:51:16] okay so we're going to be preachers
[1:51:19] then you hang around the video game you
[1:51:21] hang around the comedy you listen to
[1:51:23] this you're listening to that listen
[1:51:25] that never spend time with God never
[1:51:26] spend time for nothing
[1:51:31] I'll say it in in this way too we'll
[1:51:34] live our lives any old way don't care
[1:51:37] what people think
[1:51:38] to where and I'm not saying it's here
[1:51:40] I'm just saying
[1:51:42] to where people look at our lives and
[1:51:44] don't respect us don't trust us then we
[1:51:46] oh we're preachers we're gonna get up
[1:51:48] here we're going to preach Who you gonna
[1:51:50] preach to people that don't like you
[1:51:52] people don't trust you people don't
[1:51:54] respect you
[1:51:58] you do no good
[1:52:04] you see what I'm saying
[1:52:06] we make choices and these choices affect
[1:52:10] we got to be in the will of God
[1:52:12] if God called us to be ministers then
[1:52:14] we're going to have to we're going to
[1:52:15] have to live that life
[1:52:17] God help us to live the life
[1:52:19] if God has called us to be Christians
[1:52:21] let's live a life so that somebody can
[1:52:24] see Christ in US
[1:52:31] choices that we make and every one of us
[1:52:33] are are are called to it
[1:52:37] you agree
[1:52:41] so I know you young people you go
[1:52:43] through battles and you're going through
[1:52:44] them
[1:52:46] you realize you're a target for the
[1:52:48] enemy because the devil would love to
[1:52:50] have you
[1:52:51] because you're a life that ain't wrecked
[1:52:53] yet
[1:52:58] and you're at a place that Mom and Dad
[1:53:00] can't help you
[1:53:03] you're getting to an age where Mom and
[1:53:05] Dad can't can't help they can give you
[1:53:06] advice but you're gonna have to make
[1:53:07] your choice
[1:53:12] what am I going to want out of God
[1:53:14] you want to just live an average
[1:53:15] Christian live an adverse Christian then
[1:53:18] but God will never be real in your life
[1:53:20] you understand that God will never be
[1:53:22] real in your life
[1:53:24] go to church read your Bible God sent a
[1:53:27] prophet hear quotes amen whatever just
[1:53:30] go through the hum drum then you walk
[1:53:33] without relationship with God God will
[1:53:35] never be real in your life
[1:53:38] it's choices does that hinder you your
[1:53:40] salvation absolutely not I don't believe
[1:53:43] so
[1:53:46] but when it comes down to it how
[1:53:48] effective was you here on Earth
[1:53:53] what was your testimony like
[1:53:58] could you stand the trials
[1:54:01] did you complain
[1:54:04] did you wither
[1:54:06] did you leave shop
[1:54:08] close up shop
[1:54:10] when the going got bad
[1:54:13] you know what I'm saying
[1:54:15] there's choices
[1:54:17] that we must make
[1:54:20] if I want to be a better Christian I got
[1:54:23] to make the choices God help us to make
[1:54:24] the choices
[1:54:26] if I want influence in my life help me
[1:54:29] to make the choices
[1:54:31] and there's plenty to be made
[1:54:34] but most of all let's serve the Lord
[1:54:38] I don't care how bad you've Fallen I
[1:54:40] don't care where you're at in life
[1:54:42] don't you ever let the devil destroy you
[1:54:46] don't ever get to the place where it
[1:54:47] don't matter
[1:54:48] I've fallen I've I've made this mistake
[1:54:51] so it don't matter it does matter
