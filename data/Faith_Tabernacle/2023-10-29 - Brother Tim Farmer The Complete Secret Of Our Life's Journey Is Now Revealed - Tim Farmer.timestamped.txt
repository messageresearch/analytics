[52:07] this the complete
[52:10] Secret Of Our
[52:13] Lives has now been
[52:18] revealed now I want you to think about
[52:20] that this morning your
[52:22] life how many that times and time times
[52:26] past you had questions in your
[52:30] life how many's got questions this
[52:35] morning and when you were
[52:39] younger going through life going to
[52:43] school you know there's many things that
[52:46] you
[52:48] questioned you know and there came a day
[52:52] and time that you realized you was here
[52:57] you say brother Tim did the prophet talk
[52:59] about that
[53:01] yes he said the first thing I
[53:05] remember is crawling across the floor
[53:09] and my mother had let my uncle in it was
[53:12] snowing outside and the snow was melting
[53:15] off his boots and I was licking the snow
[53:19] off of his boots and he said I realized
[53:22] I was
[53:24] here
[53:25] that may be
[53:27] strange and when I heard him say that
[53:29] there's thing things that went back in
[53:32] my mind that I thought about when you
[53:35] realized well I'm
[53:39] here this is my life you know Mom Dad
[53:42] going to work getting up you know the
[53:44] everyday
[53:46] grind and the things that that you had
[53:49] to do and and I I want to tell you back
[53:53] then they didn't have kindergarten to
[53:55] start you out they just throwed you
[53:57] right in the first
[54:00] grade and I was always in my mind they
[54:04] would say you know you're going to have
[54:05] one of those main
[54:08] teachers and I want to tell you my mind
[54:11] brother Tim I imagined in my mind what
[54:14] she look like
[54:16] and you know I seen an old program years
[54:19] ago called The Wizard of Oz remember the
[54:21] the wicked
[54:23] witch and she had a uh a mole on the end
[54:27] of her
[54:29] nose my mom went and signed me up for
[54:32] first grade you ain't go believe
[54:34] this I walked in AR she looked exactly
[54:38] like that
[54:41] woman life I said oh my and boy she
[54:47] was and so so I kind of walked the
[54:50] straight
[54:52] line and I watched myself because she
[54:55] scared me to
[54:57] death and so she she was one of those
[55:00] and you probably remember this they
[55:01] don't have this in school anymore if you
[55:04] she caught you talking or chewing gum
[55:07] boy it'd be good if we had those
[55:08] problems again wouldn't
[55:10] it if she caught you doing those things
[55:14] that you know she'd come up and she had
[55:16] a ruler and she say put your hand
[55:20] out oh after that one time that was
[55:23] enough for me
[55:26] and I'd sit back out I wouldn't say
[55:28] nothing you say brother Tim that's hard
[55:30] to believe about you well you can
[55:32] believe
[55:34] it but
[55:36] life our lives has a very special
[55:40] meaning the family we were born
[55:43] in the places we have come through in
[55:46] our
[55:47] lives every obstacle every trial
[55:51] everything has a reason behind it
[55:55] amen the prophet told us that our lives
[55:59] and this great message that he has given
[56:03] me and you this
[56:04] morning that God has revealed to us his
[56:09] Secrets but it's about your
[56:12] life it's about why that you were here
[56:17] why that you was born in the first place
[56:21] why that you that God ever thought of
[56:24] you
[56:25] and he knew you before there was a world
[56:29] ain't that wonderful and he had a plan
[56:32] for you you didn't just come on you know
[56:35] maybe uh you ain't never heard this but
[56:38] my wife sitting there uh she was the
[56:41] youngest of uh the one in her
[56:45] family and when she was a little girl
[56:49] her oldest sister kindly picked on
[56:51] her and she told her one day said well
[56:55] you don't even supposed to be here you
[56:57] was a
[57:00] mistake I heard Daddy and Mama talking
[57:04] and you was a
[57:08] mistake but how many knows God don't
[57:11] make
[57:13] mistakes and when we come to this
[57:15] message it was such a blessing to know
[57:19] that your life and your very being here
[57:21] was no
[57:23] mistake
[57:25] that's
[57:26] right and we talked about Jesus's birth
[57:29] brother brandham said the Virgin birth
[57:32] ain't half the mystery of what a natural
[57:35] birth
[57:37] is
[57:39] you all the millions one do you know
[57:42] you're one in a
[57:47] million one in a
[57:50] million all the ones that could have
[57:54] been wasn't
[57:57] and brother Brenham said what was the
[57:59] intelligence behind that one crawling to
[58:03] where the egg was and the Egg coming up
[58:06] there to that one and them connecting he
[58:09] said they had to be a supernatural
[58:13] intelligence behind it to connect
[58:16] together and what color
[58:19] hair that you would
[58:22] have and what color eyes that you would
[58:25] have you know I Ain't Too Tall this
[58:29] morning but when I come to this message
[58:31] you know God made me exactly the way he
[58:34] wanted me be what height you would
[58:37] be brother Brenham said even your
[58:41] nature the things that he thought of you
[58:44] before you got here just like a mom and
[58:46] dad getting ready for a baby and make
[58:49] him ready for the coming he said God
[58:53] spoke all of these things all the
[58:55] beautiful mountains and the flowers and
[58:57] the thing he prepared for your
[59:02] coming you see why we should be
[59:05] worshippers you see why we should be the
[59:08] most happiest people on the face of the
[59:10] Earth this morning you see why that we
[59:14] it's more than a song to us it's more
[59:17] than just a worship to us it's our very
[59:20] life it's our very being that's why we
[59:23] were here that's why we came down this
[59:25] way we're not a mistake we are the very
[59:29] offspring of almighty
[59:32] [Music]
[59:34] God
[59:36] Amen you're supposed to be in
[59:39] here say sin interrupted oh I love this
[59:43] devil interrupted everything but he
[59:45] didn't stop
[59:47] God and might have been an interruption
[59:50] but God just said I've got a
[59:52] plan from the foundation of world going
[59:55] to be a little Interruption here we're
[59:57] going to have to swing down into time oh
[1:00:00] I love that but after a while we're
[1:00:02] going to swing back up into
[1:00:04] eternity and I've got a
[1:00:07] plan and your life your very natural
[1:00:10] life that she was told she was a mistake
[1:00:12] my wife now I beg the difference about
[1:00:15] the other two now I thought and I
[1:00:17] shouldn't say it's maybe mean a little
[1:00:19] bit to me now I know they ain't more
[1:00:22] mistakes but to me it'd be like they
[1:00:23] would be the mistak
[1:00:25] [Laughter]
[1:00:27] say you ever thought that but God gives
[1:00:32] life and we taught by the great secrets
[1:00:35] of almighty God in this hour that that's
[1:00:38] how serpent SE got on
[1:00:40] there because God is the author of Life
[1:00:44] all
[1:00:45] life regardless brother brandham said
[1:00:48] and I'll quote him perverted life or any
[1:00:50] kind of
[1:00:52] life it's the higher life
[1:00:55] it come down from that higher life
[1:00:58] there's a love there's a great love of
[1:01:00] almighty God but there's also a lower
[1:01:04] love and it come down from that great
[1:01:07] love and it come down to this hour so
[1:01:09] people say well that ain't love yes it
[1:01:12] is it is the perverted love of the
[1:01:14] higher love
[1:01:17] everything come from
[1:01:19] him all
[1:01:21] life
[1:01:23] everything
[1:01:25] generated from
[1:01:26] him because he it or allowed
[1:01:30] it because it was part of his great
[1:01:34] plan the Lord and you know we went
[1:01:37] through all of those ages the church
[1:01:40] went through all of that time from the
[1:01:42] time of
[1:01:43] Paul and Paul said I'm looking through a
[1:01:46] glass
[1:01:47] Darkly still a little dark for
[1:01:50] Paul all the great things but I'm
[1:01:52] looking through the glass dark but then
[1:01:55] up there at the end there's going to be
[1:01:57] a
[1:01:58] Perfection then we're going to see face
[1:02:01] to
[1:02:02] face we're going to face it off and God
[1:02:06] is going to come face to face with his
[1:02:10] church in the end time to reveal what
[1:02:14] this whole secret of your life was all
[1:02:17] about why you came the way you came why
[1:02:20] you come through this and come through
[1:02:23] that it was God bringing you to that
[1:02:26] place and all the time brother Brenham
[1:02:29] said you walking around down through
[1:02:30] here there's a little spark in
[1:02:33] there you didn't know what it was but
[1:02:36] you would go so far and you say why
[1:02:37] better not going much further is that
[1:02:40] right oh there's something to come to
[1:02:42] you may be in school or whatever say but
[1:02:45] something held you
[1:02:47] back it's something little spark of life
[1:02:50] you're not understanding something going
[1:02:52] on here why am I here
[1:02:55] it was a mystery to
[1:02:58] you why is this and you sat out there
[1:03:02] maybe fishing like I did or
[1:03:04] hunting looking at
[1:03:06] everything all around you what's this
[1:03:10] about where am I headed what's all this
[1:03:13] about all my
[1:03:16] feelings don't say you don't have them
[1:03:19] and feelings and and mind battles and
[1:03:22] this and that brother and them said a a
[1:03:25] child gets to a certain age about 12 or
[1:03:27] 13 a years old and the devil is waiting
[1:03:31] to give him a mind
[1:03:36] blast and some don't handle that mind
[1:03:38] blast too
[1:03:40] good he
[1:03:43] blasts he tries to take it he tries to
[1:03:47] affect
[1:03:48] you he tries to mess you up
[1:03:52] mhm and when we
[1:03:55] were we're born in sin just because
[1:03:58] we're bride this
[1:03:59] morning that don't get you out of the
[1:04:02] category that you were born in sin
[1:04:04] conceived in iniquity come to the world
[1:04:07] speaking
[1:04:09] lies is that right in the same type of
[1:04:12] body as everybody else walking
[1:04:15] around same feelings same emotions same
[1:04:20] passions same
[1:04:22] everything ain't no difference
[1:04:24] that's except one thing there was a seed
[1:04:28] Gene of almighty God that was placed
[1:04:32] down actually you're sold from the
[1:04:35] foundation of the world Amen and Satan
[1:04:39] can blast everything else and he can
[1:04:42] make this body sick but he can't get to
[1:04:45] that seal of almighty God that seed
[1:04:47] that's down in there and at the right
[1:04:50] time it will come forth and you'll begin
[1:04:53] to look around
[1:04:54] and you say why I done that oh I'm so
[1:04:57] ashamed don't ever want to go back to
[1:04:59] that what was I thinking yeah you was
[1:05:02] thinking the way he was thinking but
[1:05:04] something woke up in you one day and you
[1:05:08] recognized that something was going on
[1:05:11] and you recognized you might have went
[1:05:13] to an altar I don't know you might have
[1:05:15] been riding down the road I was riding
[1:05:16] down the road going to my grandmother's
[1:05:20] house and God just a dealing with me I
[1:05:22] didn't tell nobody prise the Lord I
[1:05:25] didn't tell nobody but God was dealing
[1:05:28] with me didn't tell Mom and Dad or
[1:05:31] anything but God was dealing with and
[1:05:33] the only thing I know how to pray
[1:05:35] brother brandham wrote him a note and
[1:05:37] put it in a tree Mr
[1:05:40] Jesus mm you say God cares about that
[1:05:43] you better believe he cares about that
[1:05:46] he said I didn't know how to talk to him
[1:05:48] I didn't know how to approach him I
[1:05:50] didn't know how to get to him but I know
[1:05:52] I needed him and I didn't know how to
[1:05:55] pray I was raised in a Pentecostal home
[1:05:59] a Pentecostal holess the day that they
[1:06:01] used to live
[1:06:02] Holiness and the ladies would shout and
[1:06:05] praise God and I remember as a little
[1:06:07] boy sitting on watching and I had their
[1:06:10] High tied up in pin and they were
[1:06:12] shouting it wasn't it wasn't fake it was
[1:06:15] real that was the age and they would
[1:06:18] shout and praise God and I sat there as
[1:06:20] a little boy I'd hear something go ping

[1:06:25] shout and dance their higher
[1:06:27] down mhm they lived right they loved
[1:06:32] right they done all those things right
[1:06:37] for their age brother brandham said

[1:06:41] Ghost back there don't say that they
[1:06:43] didn't have it they had it for their day

[1:06:50] what was for that time and that hour
[1:06:54] mhm now how about you oh my your life
[1:06:59] now by this message of this hour just
[1:07:03] like Abraham has
[1:07:06] unfolded and God has unfolded while
[1:07:09] you're here and why you see what you
[1:07:14] see and why you know what you
[1:07:17] know and what has happened to you he'll
[1:07:21] not lose none of
[1:07:22] themen
[1:07:25] you no
[1:07:27] one no one could preach and teach and
[1:07:32] bring what we have today to this
[1:07:37] hour oh they hit at
[1:07:40] it brother Terry they talked about it
[1:07:44] some Luther preached
[1:07:48] justification that's what when he it
[1:07:50] struck him when he was reading Romans as
[1:07:52] a priest and he fell back down that that
[1:07:56] stair
[1:07:59] step he was beating himself up trying to
[1:08:03] bring himself
[1:08:04] under trying to bring himself to subject
[1:08:07] to God sincere wan to love God want to
[1:08:10] sincerely praise God and worship
[1:08:14] him but he didn't realize there's a
[1:08:16] nature there's a sin question has to be
[1:08:20] answered it's something that's got to
[1:08:22] happen
[1:08:25] and so when he was reading that just
[1:08:27] reading the Bible justification and it
[1:08:30] struck him that a priest or a pope that
[1:08:34] no one else could pray my sins that I'm
[1:08:37] Justified solely by the Lord Jesus
[1:08:40] Christ and what he done to shed blood at
[1:08:42] Calvary and my goodness down back over
[1:08:45] that he fell back down over that but
[1:08:48] brother when he got up from there he was
[1:08:52] fre that far
[1:08:57] anyway and just justification what did
[1:08:59] it cause cause the Reformation is
[1:09:02] actually this
[1:09:03] weekend prise the lord it's actually
[1:09:05] this weekend on Halloween Luther October
[1:09:09] 31st nailed his 95 thesises of
[1:09:13] everything that had more than that but
[1:09:15] he had 95 against them 95 thesises of
[1:09:20] everything that the Roman Catholic
[1:09:22] Church was doing that was contr
[1:09:24] to the
[1:09:27] Bible man' is that
[1:09:30] right and so what had it started it now
[1:09:34] what did the world think brother
[1:09:36] brandham said they thought it was a
[1:09:37] bunch of arguments a bunch of monk of
[1:09:40] monks that's right bunch of caring on
[1:09:43] they brought him up there and they could
[1:09:45] have killed him but you know Ain't It
[1:09:48] Strange they never killed
[1:09:51] Luther they would stand there and argue
[1:09:53] with him
[1:09:55] they could have killed him they they
[1:09:57] they throwed him here his own friends
[1:09:59] because they were afraid they were going
[1:10:01] to kill him actually kidnapped him put a
[1:10:05] bomb fold over him took him way out in
[1:10:08] the country somewhere and kept him in a
[1:10:11] place where nobody was at and so he just
[1:10:14] wrote things and they took it out and B
[1:10:18] it out ain't just something God knows
[1:10:19] how to do things
[1:10:21] don't but what was his life he thought
[1:10:23] he was going to be a priest he thought
[1:10:26] he was going to be but ended up being
[1:10:27] the fifth Church age
[1:10:30] messenger what a
[1:10:33] life no matter where you

[1:13:45] hour Luther could preach it we're
[1:13:47] justified by Calvary and what he done
[1:13:50] there but brother brandham comes on the
[1:13:52] scene now remember this is mckisic
[1:13:55] that's behind this and mchis DEC
[1:13:58] teaching says I want to go a little bit
[1:14:00] farther and bring it out because Luther
[1:14:02] couldn't bring it all the way

[1:14:49] so in this hour he comes and he stands
[1:14:52] up one day day and he says this is stuff
[1:14:55] sayth the Lord you are the
[1:15:06] sinless you were the
[1:15:10] sinless blessed is the man whom the Lord

[1:16:09] sinless brother BR said you was trapped
[1:16:11] into

[1:16:16] say he trapped had to come his
[1:16:18] way and you didn't ask to come his
[1:16:22] way
[1:16:23] something happened and you had to come
[1:16:25] this way is that right so before the
[1:16:29] foundation of the world because you had
[1:16:30] to come God went ahead and wrote your
[1:16:33] name in the Lamb's Book of Life and he
[1:16:36] had in the back of his mind one
[1:16:39] day one day their life is going to
[1:16:41] unfold oh they won't know what's going
[1:16:43] on but I'm going to slip down I'm going
[1:16:46] to send them a Vindication like the
[1:16:48] world of Earth has never seen and I'm
[1:16:50] going to come down there as mckc again
[1:16:53] I'm going to speak about him here in
[1:16:55] Abraham Paul's going to hit him a little
[1:16:57] bit but I'm going to have a Vindicated
[1:16:59] Prophet as a bride standing in Le oia
[1:17:03] that will be all mixed up and we're all
[1:17:06] confused and not understand why am I
[1:17:09] here what's going on why am I in this
[1:17:11] situation and I'm going to send my word
[1:17:15] by a Vindicated prophet and I'm going to
[1:17:17] come down
[1:17:20] myself yes sir
[1:17:23] I've had people say you've lost your
[1:17:25] mind you went off the deep end no I
[1:17:28] ain't lost my mind I got it brother
[1:17:30] Terry I got my mind back when this
[1:17:34] message struck my heart and begin to get
[1:17:37] into what God had said about his bride
[1:17:41] this thing was not about a a church or a
[1:17:44] denomination or a building or some Fly
[1:17:48] by Night Ministry this was the ministry
[1:17:51] of MDC in the end time not this time
[1:17:55] letting a little bit out of it all of it
[1:17:58] to unfold the complete secret of why you
[1:18:02] here and why you had to come about God
[1:18:05] oh he talked about God in this hour
[1:18:07] himself but do you know he talked more
[1:18:09] about you than he did
[1:18:12] himself
[1:18:14] amen amen we recognized it was God
[1:18:16] brother BR said we always know
[1:18:18] Theologian knows he always
[1:18:21] great is great he is the greatest he's
[1:18:26] the author of life we know all about
[1:18:30] that we always thought that even when
[1:18:33] you wasn't converted you thought that
[1:18:35] there's a God that he's great and he's
[1:18:38] passy and
[1:18:40] out but brother Brenham said what makes
[1:18:42] him great to me is that he can come down
[1:18:45] and make himself so small to get down to
[1:18:49] where you at and talk to you and
[1:18:52] communicate with you and know the very
[1:18:55] hearts and desires of your thoughts even
[1:18:58] down that the prophet said if you have a
[1:19:01] hang nail anybody ever had a hang nail
[1:19:03] that God is concerned because the pain
[1:19:05] of the Hang nail if he's concerned about
[1:19:08] a hang nail this morning then what if
[1:19:10] he's concerned about the Mind battle
[1:19:12] you're going through he's concerned
[1:19:14] about young people the troubles and the
[1:19:16] things that you facing and on your job
[1:19:19] he knows about you and he wants to know
[1:19:22] about you he called you to fellowship
[1:19:25] and have that great fellowship with him
[1:19:27] and communion this morning that's why he
[1:19:30] done these things to let you know it's
[1:19:32] all
[1:19:36] right it's going to be all

[1:28:15] calling I'm no different than
[1:28:19] you just in office yes is that
[1:28:24] right I have the same battles and
[1:28:27] probably more battles cuz he's going to
[1:28:30] come against that word so you pray for
[1:28:33] your pastor and he said don't you get
[1:28:36] out here and try to straighten this out
[1:28:38] to do that he said the best thing say
[1:28:40] with me the best thing I'm glad
[1:28:43] everything was answered in this message
[1:28:45] how about you if everybody just go on
[1:28:47] and do what he said to do and leave it
[1:28:50] alone just do what he said to do do and
[1:28:52] love one another like we're supposed
[1:28:55] to this ain't no normal love this is the
[1:28:58] very G love of almighty God that should
[1:29:02] be in our souls brother Brenham said
[1:29:05] those that love this message should love

[1:45:12] theophany two angels and God in a
[1:45:15] theophany 25 years had
[1:45:19] passed brother brandham said that his

[1:45:24] he was in a
[1:45:27] famine he was sitting there
[1:45:31] waiting and here comes mkis DEC the
[1:45:38] Lord because he had to get the
[1:45:42] church B in the right thinking of
[1:45:45] mind and he had to get
[1:45:48] her to the place
[1:45:51] that she was a part of it because what
[1:45:53] she
[1:45:54] said when he says sah is going to he's
[1:45:57] telling Abraham Sarah's going to have a
[1:46:00] child and brother Brenham said she
[1:46:02] laughed in herself or laughed up her
[1:46:05] sleeve she didn't think nobody heard
[1:46:08] her who's this weirdo out

[1:46:37] said why did Sarah laugh
[1:46:43] uhoh then she looked at almighty God in
[1:46:46] his face and called him a liar that's
[1:46:48] what brother Brown
[1:46:49] said said well she didn't come right out
[1:46:51] and say he was a liar she said who
[1:46:54] what's going on here huh me be
[1:46:58] a to conceive a

[1:47:25] wall could have killed her struck her
[1:47:27] dead but I love this but he couldn't

[1:47:33] Abraham and then brother brandham souped
[1:47:35] it up it got better and better and he
[1:47:37] said how many times could he throw dust
[1:47:40] in the
[1:47:42] dirt how many times you failed how many
[1:47:45] times that you done wrong how many times
[1:47:47] you said something you shouldn't have
[1:47:49] said and you know it
[1:47:52] he could have throwed you in the dirt
[1:47:54] but he couldn't done it cuz you a part
[1:47:57] of Christ and if he throw you in there
[1:47:59] he throw Christ in there and he's not

[1:48:10] tonight there's a Lamb's Book of Life
[1:48:12] tonight and they're part of
[1:48:15] Christ so whatever he does with him
[1:48:19] listen
[1:48:21] he's going to do with
[1:48:23] me ain't that
[1:48:26] beautiful someone asked me in my church
[1:48:28] one time they said Jesus I preached a
[1:48:31] message one morning Jesus don't own it
[1:48:36] all no I'm getting him looks like I got
[1:48:43] my news flash in blackburg this morning

[1:49:05] is this stream it's a streaming oh my
[1:49:11] listen he don't own at
[1:49:15] all you say why didn't don't on it all
[1:49:18] because that was his choice that's
[1:49:25] right cuz he didn't want heaven without
[1:49:29] you he didn't want the kingdoms without
[1:49:33] you he didn't want that's what your life
[1:49:35] is about that's the secret huh Adam
[1:49:41] walked out the door on almighty
[1:49:44] God therefore shall a man leave his
[1:49:48] father and his mother and and cleave to
[1:49:50] his
[1:49:53] wife one day
[1:49:56] Adam you're going to love somebody more
[1:49:58] than you love
[1:49:59] me boy say brother Tim
[1:50:03] really one day you're going to think of
[1:50:06] somebody more and you're going to leave
[1:50:10] me and you're going to throw yourself
[1:50:13] and all the human race into death
[1:50:16] because you love that
[1:50:19] woman
[1:50:23] amen and when that scripture says that
[1:50:25] in
[1:50:27] Hebrews therefore shall a man leave and
[1:50:30] cleave to his wife the word cleave
[1:50:33] there means he shall not just leave with
[1:50:37] her and grab a hold of we've been taught
[1:50:38] that through Pentecost and down through
[1:50:40] our but the actual says this he shall
[1:50:44] pursue her all the rest of the days of
[1:50:49] his life and that will be what his life
[1:50:52] will be caught up in you say that's an
[1:50:55] awful
[1:50:58] thing Adam
[1:51:01] terrible Papa
[1:51:04] Adam what did you
[1:51:08] do now let's
[1:51:12] go
[1:51:13] down several thousand years
[1:51:17] now in a garden called guest
[1:51:24] Amen brother brandham said the greatest
[1:51:26] decision that was ever
[1:51:31] made he had a right to have a
[1:51:36] family a wife children a
[1:51:40] home cuz he was a
[1:51:46] man he had a
[1:51:48] right
[1:51:50] and in that
[1:51:52] Garden he had a
[1:51:56] chores and the father said will you do
[1:52:01] it
[1:52:02] Lord and so much was the
[1:52:06] pressure that he sweat the BL his blood
[1:52:10] out through his sweat
[1:52:15] glands No One Like Him
[1:52:18] amen ever
[1:52:22] be and I talked to a doctor and said
[1:52:25] that's really truthfully a person would
[1:52:27] have to be to a point and said their
[1:52:30] heart and everything would break down
[1:52:32] and it wouldn't be able to stand
[1:52:36] it you just blow off the
[1:52:40] PTI but that was the
[1:52:44] lamb the perfect

[2:00:22] beef and he drunk
[2:00:26] milk and he ate
[2:00:34] cornbread sound like he kind of back
[2:00:36] woods
[2:00:39] fell God
[2:00:41] is and he sat there and he e
[2:00:44] it and he said now
[2:00:48] Abraham
[2:00:49] and brother brandham said when he said
[2:00:54] Abraham few days before that he changed
[2:00:57] him from Abram to Abraham he talked to
[2:01:01] him and when he said Abraham there's no
[2:01:04] way no one knows that that was almighty
[2:01:06] God told me I'm Abraham now oh my and
[2:01:10] the same voice was
[2:01:12] now in a man sitting under an oak tree
[2:01:17] say it's as simple as that yeah
[2:01:19] talking to him and telling him that
[2:01:22] she's getting ready to conceive and I'm
[2:01:24] going to visit
[2:01:26] you in the time of life and I'm going to
[2:01:28] give you that son and he's his name's
[2:01:31] going to be called Isaac oh my what a
[2:01:35] visitation you know what she got on
[2:01:38] board she got in the right attitude
[2:01:41] matter of fact they felt pretty good is
[2:01:44] that right cuz a few days after that
[2:01:46] their bodies
[2:01:47] changed and they went back the 20 years
[2:01:49] on and took a 100 mile Journey all way
[2:01:51] down to
[2:01:57] G then something when God speaks to you
[2:02:00] and does something you just start
[2:02:01] feeling good
[2:02:05] again now I told you I was going to
[2:02:07] close now listen as we
[2:02:11] close he stepped out to him
[2:02:16] there and he revealed to Abraham
[2:02:20] a different
[2:02:22] order a mchis DEC
[2:02:26] order that
[2:02:29] Abraham I'm the author of life I'm I'm
[2:02:33] the one I'm your all and
[2:02:37] all and your
[2:02:41] life is planned
[2:02:45] out and I knew you before there was a
[2:02:48] world
[2:02:50] and I will never leave
[2:02:52] you because you came from
[2:02:55] me and I will come to get
[2:02:59] you and I will get you
[2:03:02] out and I'll give that promise because
[2:03:05] it's me that's doing all these
[2:03:08] things and in this great
[2:03:11] hour I read to you Luke 20 uh
[2:03:15] 4 brother brandham said those that went
[2:03:18] to the road of
[2:03:20] amas it says that Jesus just stepped out
[2:03:23] of the Bush on
[2:03:25] them they were going down they were so
[2:03:28] sad they was down the dumps they knew
[2:03:30] something was going on but they couldn't
[2:03:31] put their finger on it they didn't
[2:03:33] understand it and one of my favorite
[2:03:36] messages that brother brandham preached
[2:03:38] is modern events are made clear by
[2:03:43] prophecy he just stepped on the
[2:03:46] scene and begin to take them down
[2:03:48] through the
[2:03:50] scriptures and unveiled the secret
[2:03:52] things that was in the scriptures
[2:03:54] already been written that the very of
[2:03:56] modern day events that had went on was
[2:03:59] the very things that they had witnessed
[2:04:01] and
[2:04:05] saw and so the more they went the better
[2:04:08] they felt because they said later on
[2:04:09] their hearts were burning within them as
[2:04:11] he spoke to
[2:04:14] them he said now when you start talking
[2:04:17] the word he'll show up
[2:04:19] he said just like them you're talking
[2:04:21] foolishness you're talking about riding
[2:04:22] a motorcycle ain't nothing wrong riding
[2:04:24] a motorcycle if you're talking about
[2:04:26] doing this and that he won't show up but
[2:04:29] if you're walking around talking about
[2:04:31] the word he said God will come on the
[2:04:33] scene and begin to join you and talk it
[2:04:36] right with
[2:04:39] you we talk about so much stuff and
[2:04:42] we're so negative and a Christian don't
[2:04:44] supposed to be negative so you preaching
[2:04:47] by I'm preaching about myself too is
[2:04:48] that right and we get so negative and
[2:04:51] down when the very secret of our life
[2:04:53] has been completely revealed and made
[2:04:55] plain to us that we are them we are
[2:04:58] those that God has chose before the
[2:05:00] foundation of the world because no one
[2:05:03] could see this and know this unless you
[2:05:05] were
[2:05:08] saved and why did God send a prophet and
[2:05:11] he preached and he preached and he
[2:05:12] preached and he preached and he preached
[2:05:14] and he'd say
[2:05:16] listen then he saying now get you some
[2:05:18] thinking caps on this ain't what Luther
[2:05:22] preached we're not in an airplane
[2:05:30] anymore well we at astronaut
[2:05:37] age where he said that that man is
[2:05:39] controlled by an unseen
[2:05:43] power it's called radar unseen power and
[2:05:46] they know where he is yeah all the time
[2:05:51] and they can put him out there and bring
[2:05:52] him back a that
[2:05:57] wonderful bringing back so that
[2:06:01] age he was typing and bringing and at
[2:06:05] the end of this Jewish age brother
[2:06:07] Brenham said you won't hear theologians
[2:06:10] say this and you won't hear us in a
[2:06:12] Baptist Church or Theological Seminary
[2:06:15] and you won't hear it in the common vks
[2:06:19] but he said when he stepped out there it
[2:06:21] was the end of the Jewish
[2:06:24] age and I'm thinking I never know there
[2:06:27] was a Jewish
[2:06:29] age and he said they had seven Church
[2:06:32] ages in the old
[2:06:38] test never heard that in Bible
[2:06:43] College and at the end of the Jewish age
[2:06:47] listen he come to
[2:06:50] visit and he took the
[2:06:53] scriptures and these men that he was
[2:06:55] walking with there he took the
[2:06:58] seals off of the word in the Old
[2:07:03] Testament he done the very
[2:07:08] thing that he's always
[2:07:11] done at the end of an age he comes and I
[2:07:16] love this himself brother
[2:07:20] and said there was seven Church ages
[2:07:22] there now brother Brenham didn't go into
[2:07:24] full de but you can look at it and in
[2:07:26] the church ages you know we went back
[2:07:28] talk about Jezebel religion and Elijah
[2:07:31] and all the d uh David's Reign Solomon's
[2:07:34] Reign all of those those types and
[2:07:37] shadows he says was God letting out this
[2:07:41] secret little by little that's right and
[2:07:43] types and shadows coming down through
[2:07:46] there for the benefit of you
[2:07:49] oh my and that in the end time at the
[2:07:52] very end of it they didn't know what was
[2:07:54] going on the modern events and the
[2:07:55] things that kindly throwed them back he
[2:07:58] began to go through all the scriptures
[2:08:00] of Moses verse 44 Moses and the Psalms
[2:08:05] and the other and the prophets and he
[2:08:07] begin to take the lock off of them amen
[2:08:12] and he said in verse 27 here in
[2:08:14] beginning at Moses and all the prophets
[2:08:17] he expounded it now took expound means
[2:08:19] to
[2:08:20] explain and to bring in clear
[2:08:23] understanding ain't that beautiful
[2:08:26] what's going
[2:08:31] on brother will you find out you wasn't
[2:08:34] such a misfed after all me and
[2:08:39] you found out that everything was going
[2:08:43] on just on time was
[2:08:47] it
[2:08:51] one more
[2:08:55] quote in
[2:08:58] Christ is the mystery and we're going to
[2:09:01] close on this
[2:09:10] one I want to read you
[2:09:17] something
[2:09:21] in paragraph
[2:09:24] 102 he said now God's secret he had
[2:09:28] before the world began now back in the
[2:09:30] back part of God's
[2:09:33] mind there was something that he was
[2:09:36] trying and was going to
[2:09:38] achieve and he had a motive in doing it
[2:09:41] in order to let himself be
[2:09:46] expressed what a state statement am so
[2:09:50] in the back part of God's
[2:09:54] mind not in the front part not all of
[2:09:57] these types and things is that's why it
[2:09:59] was all a big
[2:10:02] mystery but in the back
[2:10:07] part where nobody in the back
[2:10:10] part where nobody can get
[2:10:14] to that nobody
[2:10:16] knowed but him
[2:10:19] himself and as I've often told people
[2:10:22] you say why do you believe this Prophet
[2:10:25] so much because he come and told us what
[2:10:28] was on the back part of God's mind and
[2:10:30] what he'd been thinking about all the
[2:10:33] time and all of these other things are
[2:10:37] Church entity and and what we do and
[2:10:40] what was this minor
[2:10:44] things but this was a major thing amen
[2:10:49] and so in the back of his mind he said
[2:10:52] he was wanting
[2:10:53] to express
[2:10:57] himself because there wasn't even a Moon
[2:10:59] Star Adam molecule anything he W he was
[2:11:03] God but exactly wasn't God at that time
[2:11:06] I remember the first time I heard
[2:11:08] brother brandom say I had to stop back
[2:11:10] then we had tapes we had to stop
[2:11:14] it I tell my son blessed the words
[2:11:17] everywhere now
[2:11:19] it's supposed to be that way you got it
[2:11:20] on your phone you got it on the computer
[2:11:23] you got it on YouTube you got it
[2:11:25] everywhere you got it in pamphlets you
[2:11:27] got it in books the the preacher reads
[2:11:30] it to you the words are all over you it
[2:11:33] should be a rapturing face somewh it
[2:11:35] should be a rapturing Grace is that
[2:11:37] right but we have it everywhere but back
[2:11:40] then you had a few books of this you had
[2:11:42] to stop what did he say
[2:11:44] there anybody ever done
[2:11:47] that
[2:11:49] and that Dad burn it devil I run it back
[2:11:51] and next thing I know it run into the
[2:11:54] tape recorder here I was with the tape
[2:11:59] out yeah no a little
[2:12:05] pencil T me an
[2:12:09] IR I we can just tap it
[2:12:14] and search and put it in how blessed you
[2:12:17] are young people how blessed you are
[2:12:19] today how you have access right at your
[2:12:21] fingertips you're an astronaut age you
[2:12:24] think that astronaut don't have what he
[2:12:26] needs all he knows what he's doing he
[2:12:31] understands he knows about it all he can
[2:12:33] fly on airplane he knows about the
[2:12:35] instruments he knows where he's at he
[2:12:37] knows where he's going he knows why He's
[2:12:39] there
[2:12:47] for
[2:12:48] so he wasn't exactly God at that time
[2:12:52] because God is an object of
[2:12:56] worship and so when he brought Angels
[2:12:59] around him he was worshiped right so in
[2:13:01] his great mind say great mind with me he
[2:13:05] wanted these attributes to be
[2:13:08] expressed and in him was love in him was
[2:13:10] to be a father in him was to be a son in
[2:13:13] him was to be a savior in him was to be
[2:13:15] a Healer and all these great attributes
[2:13:17] that we you see already expressed they
[2:13:19] were in God so my
[2:13:21] opinion uh the first thing he made was
[2:13:23] angels and they worshiped him and he
[2:13:25] made him God and he started from
[2:13:33] there what a
[2:13:35] secret what a message amen did you ever
[2:13:39] know that God started right
[2:13:42] there what doing and planning what he's
[2:13:46] done for this day
[2:13:49] now would you stand with
[2:13:53] me and we sure do appreciate
[2:13:59] you if the musicians would
[2:14:02] [Music]
[2:14:10] come and as they're coming as Abraham
[2:14:16] received
[2:14:18] and he had a visitation from
[2:14:22] mizing and
[2:14:26] Paul and revealing it and saying
[2:14:30] that mzed met
[2:14:33] Abraham fed him
[2:14:36] communion done all those things he could
[2:14:39] only take us so
[2:14:43] far and brother Brenham brings it down
[2:14:45] to our
[2:14:46] day
[2:14:48] and he tells us everything and you see
[2:14:50] the evidences of what God is doing and
[2:14:53] then he brings before he goes off the
[2:14:58] sing and if you listen one of my
[2:15:00] favorite
[2:15:02] series February of 1965 in which he
[2:15:06] preaches a man running from the presence
[2:15:08] of the Lord and He preached the seed
[2:15:11] shall not be our with the
[2:15:13] Shook and he preaches marriage and
[2:15:16] divorce and he preaches who is this
[2:15:19] mckisic what he talking about brother
[2:15:22] Tim he's
[2:15:25] now what God's mind he's now talking to
[2:15:30] the
[2:15:31] bride church as usual is over
[2:15:35] [Music]
[2:15:37] now our worship would be different
[2:15:41] now matter of fact when he look back on
[2:15:44] you seen that
[2:15:46] clock now only Prophet don't never try
[2:15:48] this cuz you ain't a
