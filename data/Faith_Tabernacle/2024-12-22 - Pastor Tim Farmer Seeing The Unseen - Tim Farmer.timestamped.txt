[48:09] and uh good SP ter of course when
[48:12] brother Bram was here he was upset
[48:14] because they had tubless tires coming
[48:16] out then now we got donut tires and
[48:18] spare
[48:19] tires so remember the first time ever
[48:23] seen one of
[48:24] them I said you going to put that on now
[48:26] we're going to go down the
[48:29] road little
[48:32] donut I said oh boy I don't know but it
[48:39] worked said oh I I said that what that

[48:45] you know it's something so we just a
[48:47] spare tire and uh you need one of those
[48:50] every once in a while so uh and so uh so
[48:56] this past the old country and that's all
[49:00] those things like that and a little
[49:02] heart I thought on my heart this morning
[49:05] to preach to you and uh if uh as brother
[49:11] Brown said if we could give it the way
[49:13] God give it to us as it see as he said
[49:15] in the woods it'd be it'd be something
[49:17] else but but may it be a blessing to you
[49:21] and to us as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[49:23] Exodus chapter 33 we want to read with
[49:27] uh verse uh nine and then we won't skip
[49:30] down we won't read this whole portion
[49:33] but just get a little thought here and
[49:36] it came to pass as Moses entered into
[49:39] the Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar
[49:42] descended and stood at the door of the
[49:44] Tabernacle and the Lord talked with
[49:47] Moses and all the people saw the Cloudy
[49:50] pillar stand at the Tabernacle door and
[49:53] all the people rose up and worshiped
[49:55] every man in his tent door and the Lord
[49:58] spake unto Moses face to face as a man
[50:02] speaketh unto his friend and he turned
[50:06] again into the camp but his servant
[50:09] Joshua the son of nun a young man
[50:11] departed not out of the
[50:15] Tabernacle and Moes Moses said unto the
[50:18] Lord see thou saith unto me bring up
[50:21] this people and thou has not let me know
[50:24] whom thou will send with me yet thou has
[50:29] said I Know Thee by name and thou has
[50:32] also found Grace in my sight now
[50:35] therefore I pray thee if I found Grace
[50:38] in thy sight show me now thy way that I
[50:42] may Know Thee that I may find Grace in
[50:45] thy sight and consider that this nation
[50:49] is thy people and he said my presence
[50:54] shall go with thee
[50:57] and I will give thee
[51:00] rest ain't that wonderful and he said
[51:03] unto him If thy presence go not with me
[51:07] Carri us not up
[51:10] hence what a
[51:13] humility for whn shall it be known that
[51:16] I and thy people have found Grace in thy
[51:19] sight is it not in that thou goest with
[51:22] us so shall we be separated and I love
[51:26] this I am thy people from all the people
[51:29] that upon the face of the
[51:33] earth and the Lord said unto Moses I
[51:35] will do this thing also that thou H has
[51:39] spoken for thou has found Grace in my
[51:42] sight and I
[51:44] Know Thee by
[51:46] name and then I like the words of
[51:49] Moses and he said I beseech
[51:52] you show me thy Glory
[51:57] let me read that
[51:58] again and he said I beseech
[52:01] you Show Me Your
[52:04] Glory yes and brother brandham said what
[52:07] was he
[52:08] asking God I want to see
[52:12] you yes sir H
[52:17] hell I want to see you I hear you
[52:20] speaking to me I saw
[52:23] Visions I've seen manifestations
[52:28] but his horse desire every Christian
[52:30] every
[52:34] believer Let Your Presence go with me
[52:36] but don't just let it be a presence I
[52:38] want
[52:40] to see who's talking to
[52:44] me and God granted it to him and I skip
[52:48] down verse uh 21 and the Lord said
[52:53] behold there is a place by me how many
[52:55] believes this too is a place by that's
[52:58] this lovely there is a place by me and
[53:02] thou shall stand upon a rock and it
[53:05] shall come to pass that while my glory
[53:06] passes by that I will put thee in the
[53:09] Cliff of The Rock and I will cover thee
[53:11] with my hand while I pass by and I will
[53:15] take away mine hand and thou shall see
[53:18] my back Parts but my face I shall not
[53:23] see so he looked
[53:27] and brother Brenham said when he
[53:29] looked and he
[53:31] saw he said it looked like a
[53:34] man and it was a
[53:36] man as he went
[53:39] by and he said when he looked at the
[53:42] back now Moses doesn't tell it here but
[53:44] we had a Vindicated Prophet that said
[53:46] when he saw his back it was a stripe
[53:49] back it was a bloody B
[53:56] now Moses doesn't share it and I don't
[53:58] know if brother brandham shares it if
[54:00] Moses understood that at that time I
[54:03] don't know he's a prophet but he saw
[54:07] him and God let him see
[54:11] him and may we pray this
[54:13] morning God I want to see and I want to
[54:16] bring something to you this morning and
[54:19] I've asked our brothers I don't know if
[54:21] they got the picture up
[54:23] here and uh
[54:26] you may be
[54:29] seated and while you're being seated
[54:31] let's go to the 11th chapter of the book
[54:33] of
[54:36] Hebrews and I want to
[54:39] read what the book of Hebrews says about
[54:42] this experience that Moses
[54:48] had if they can put that up there how
[54:50] many how many's familiar with this
[54:52] picture this is the love ofely the
[54:54] picture amen
[54:59] verse
[55:00] 27 in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 it
[55:04] says by faith he forsook Egypt Moses not
[55:07] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[55:10] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[55:16] am and I want to take for a little
[55:18] subject this morning
[55:20] sin the
[55:24] Unseen and you know people people think
[55:27] you know the world you know when it
[55:28] messes believers they think we're
[55:32] crazy I mean even a little title like
[55:34] that seeing the Unseen brother Tim you
[55:37] just said it couldn't be
[55:40] seen and you telling me you you going to
[55:43] look at the
[55:46] Unseen Lally to be able to see the
[55:49] Unseen what is invisible brother
[55:52] brandham said we worship the invisible
[55:55] God Amen
[55:59] I can't see him in this
[56:02] building but I can look at you and I see
[56:05] the purchase of his
[56:08] blood I've heard the songs this
[56:13] morning and the hymn sung and I heard
[56:16] him in those
[56:19] songs
[56:21] M I've heard the prayer request we've
[56:24] heard the prayer and if you'll listen to
[56:27] uh always love to listen to especially
[56:29] message believer when they
[56:32] pray I like to listen to brother
[56:35] branham's
[56:36] prayers you ever noticed that he'll
[56:38] he'll give you Revelation in the prayers
[56:40] he's
[56:42] prayed and you'll see what he's talking
[56:44] He he'll just begin to talk and and
[56:46] you'll hear him say certain things that
[56:48] really stands out to you really helps
[56:51] you and encourages you what is that
[56:54] that's him
[56:57] that's the
[56:59] Unseen that's something that is unseen
[57:02] to the naked eye or the five
[57:08] senses and it can't literally be picked
[57:11] up by these eyes or naturally unless God
[57:15] makes a visible show and he can do
[57:20] that but there's
[57:23] something that a Christian as brother
[57:26] Bram said when mchis DEC came in to
[57:29] Abraham and he seen them
[57:33] coming he said you can't hide nothing
[57:35] from a Christian a Believer they know
[57:38] something's going on he might not could
[57:40] have put his finger on it at that time
[57:42] or explained it but you know something's
[57:46] going on
[57:48] here and when we come
[57:51] together and gather together in the
[57:54] lord's name and we come to this house of
[57:58] worship that we've D dedicated and
[58:01] committed to the place where we gathered
[58:04] together to hear the word of the Lord is
[58:06] something special about that's why we
[58:08] should go to
[58:09] church and that's why and I I always say
[58:12] this and I tell my church God has
[58:14] designed so you can go to church every
[58:17] day so what are you talking about you
[58:20] can put a CD in you can have church you
[58:24] can go down the road you can have church
[58:26] church you can gather in Fellowship
[58:29] around the word I like
[58:32] that God has done so much for me and you
[58:36] that this bride why just so she assured
[58:39] to get
[58:41] home it's a sure thing it ain't a maybe
[58:44] so we might get there this is a sure
[58:48] thing and what God done in this
[58:52] hour he has you know done different
[58:55] things in times past but what he done in
[58:58] this
[58:59] hour is not something that's goes on all
[59:03] the
[59:04] time it ain't something that is done you
[59:08] know it's actually according to the
[59:11] message of the hour this is the third
[59:14] time say third time huh this is the
[59:18] third time third time of what first time
[59:22] was with Moses second time was with Paul
[59:26] and the third time is this
[59:30] day you say what you talking about
[59:32] brother Tim something given to the
[59:35] people of God not a
[59:38] theologian not just a teacher not just
[59:42] coming in and gathering together but
[59:45] under the literal Pillar of Fire himself
[59:49] bringing forth uh message of redemption
[59:53] and what the need of the hour is verse
[59:56] special
[59:57] need
[59:59] amen and actually brother brandham
[1:00:01] refers to it as Jesus Christ the
[1:00:05] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:00:10] then he explains it gives us a little
[1:00:12] bit more illumination yesterday
[1:00:18] Moses today
[1:00:20] Paul amen forever today Glory here here
[1:00:26] present
[1:00:28] now doing this under a pillar of fire
[1:00:32] that the same Pillar of Fire and I quote
[1:00:35] this quote the same Pillar of Fire that
[1:00:38] gave uh that was with Moses and with
[1:00:41] Paul is the same Pillar of Fire here
[1:00:44] interpreting the word in this day
[1:00:48] Hallelujah not a different one the same
[1:00:51] one everybody say same one
[1:00:56] the same
[1:00:58] manifestation I just read to you they
[1:01:01] saw it the sin yeah they saw the pillar
[1:01:04] of fire descend come to the Tabernacle
[1:01:07] and saw it descend and talk to
[1:01:11] Moses yes sir amen mm as a friend talks
[1:01:17] to a friend that's pretty good
[1:01:20] relationship
[1:01:22] H and he comes down and he talks fath
[1:01:25] face to face with him so someone said
[1:01:30] well brother Tim you literally believe
[1:01:32] that that God will come down a certain
[1:01:34] type of caliber of a
[1:01:38] man
[1:01:40] yes that had to qualify with
[1:01:45] God see we can never be the prophet and
[1:01:49] I love what he said here I can never
[1:01:51] take Billy Graham's place
[1:01:56] people were down Billy Graham I could do
[1:01:57] what Billy Graham brother Bram said you
[1:01:59] couldn't I could never take Billy
[1:02:01] Graham's Place neither can Billy Graham
[1:02:03] take my place and neither can anybody
[1:02:07] take your place true a that
[1:02:11] wonderful so whatever God has
[1:02:15] ordained to walk with him be happy in
[1:02:19] how God has designed you and built you
[1:02:23] and made you because you are unique
[1:02:26] yes sir and he made you a part of this
[1:02:29] I'm just happy to be a part of
[1:02:32] this
[1:02:34] Hallelujah glory to God they saw the
[1:02:37] pillar of
[1:02:39] fir they saw the Cloudy pillar the sin
[1:02:42] talk to
[1:02:45] Moses Moses saw all of that
[1:02:48] manifestation it was there a cloud by
[1:02:54] day and it showed them from the sun and
[1:02:57] it kept them protected and no Army could
[1:03:00] approach
[1:03:01] them ain't that wonderful praise God and
[1:03:05] it it moved and when it moved they
[1:03:08] moved true and then it was a fire by
[1:03:12] night don't you think it gets cold on
[1:03:13] the desert oh yeah but there was a great
[1:03:17] big Pillar of Fire hanging there that
[1:03:20] was shining in the darkness and it was
[1:03:23] hanging wouldn't you just love to look
[1:03:25] up our looked at it Hallelujah they
[1:03:28] going to make pictures of it and all
[1:03:30] those things but it it doesn't it
[1:03:33] doesn't take give it the full F of what
[1:03:37] it
[1:03:38] is but God was there he was in
[1:03:42] there he was in that Pillar of Fire he
[1:03:45] was in that manifestation and he was
[1:03:48] talking
[1:03:49] to
[1:03:51] Moses as a friend personally coming down
[1:03:55] telling him and getting him and then
[1:03:57] brother Brenham says this is how it was
[1:04:01] actually only two people wrote the
[1:04:03] entire
[1:04:04] Bible said brother Bram said that
[1:04:08] yes he said actually only two people
[1:04:12] really wrote the scriptures the other
[1:04:14] ones wrote off of what they
[1:04:17] said Okay okay so that kind of checks
[1:04:21] people back but brother brandham said
[1:04:24] that he said that it was only two and
[1:04:26] that was Moses and
[1:04:30] Paul and they probably say disagree with
[1:04:33] me well let me explain it this way here
[1:04:35] it is Moses was given the five first
[1:04:39] five books of the Bible and he wrote
[1:04:41] some of the Psalms is that right Moses
[1:04:43] was a song writer and he wrote those
[1:04:46] things under the inspiration of God he
[1:04:49] even sung after they got across the Red
[1:04:51] Sea and let them in
[1:04:54] sng song of Moes and one day when they
[1:04:57] get over to Israel they'll sing the song
[1:04:59] of Moses again that's what the scripture
[1:05:03] says Moses was the greatest
[1:05:07] Prophet to Israel because he was the
[1:05:11] lawgiver and God talked to him face to
[1:05:14] face yes sir and God talk so you can't
[1:05:17] be wrong when the one that's given the
[1:05:19] word comes down literally and uh face to
[1:05:23] face and tell
[1:05:27] how you going to be
[1:05:29] off so that man don't know what he's
[1:05:31] talking about this one
[1:05:35] did I'm just laying a
[1:05:37] groundwork cuz I want to get to
[1:05:39] something here cuz I want to tell you
[1:05:42] hit greater today than it was then glory
[1:05:48] amen because he does something in this
[1:05:51] day Moses sewing him his back Parts yes
[1:05:55] yes it
[1:05:57] is oh I love it that's right Paul saw a
[1:06:03] pillar of fire hanging there literally
[1:06:06] burn his eyes
[1:06:07] out
[1:06:09] wow brighter and greater than the
[1:06:12] Noonday
[1:06:13] sun
[1:06:15] say that's what he say
[1:06:19] yeah he said I saw
[1:06:21] him it put my eyes out
[1:06:26] L but from that day he never changed his
[1:06:28] story even before the king and Festus
[1:06:31] and Agrippa at the end he said I was not
[1:06:35] disobedient to the heavenly
[1:06:38] vision and he said I've been through
[1:06:41] this I've been in the sea I've been
[1:06:43] rejected and everything but I was told
[1:06:46] by
[1:06:47] him
[1:06:49] yes to go to the Gentiles and to preach
[1:06:53] and to Clare and what things I was
[1:06:55] suffer for his name's
[1:06:58] sake is that
[1:07:01] right he would suffer for his name sight
[1:07:04] so Pillar of Fire Pillar of
[1:07:07] Fire special Moses wrote the books he
[1:07:11] goes back and gives us what Adam and Eve
[1:07:13] were doing the the
[1:07:16] beginning the first five books under a
[1:07:19] pillar of fire brother bham said writing
[1:07:22] was allowed to write scripture
[1:07:25] amen uhhuh and what is this oh they
[1:07:29] neglect oh they sell it every year it's
[1:07:31] Christmas time I'm sure it's they've
[1:07:33] been sold out and this is the best
[1:07:35] seller every
[1:07:37] year all the great best sellers all the
[1:07:39] books all the authors they can never out
[1:07:43] sell this why because brother Brenham
[1:07:47] said it's God in letter
[1:07:49] form praise God good believe that that's
[1:07:52] a form of him right there say Where's
[1:07:55] God that you know when you really looked
[1:07:56] at this message you know God is
[1:08:00] everywhere he's more places than you
[1:08:02] think he is I can look down this morning
[1:08:05] read that there he is I can hear the
[1:08:07] songs this morning there he is I can
[1:08:10] look at you there's the purchase of rill
[1:08:12] there he is I see people worshiping in
[1:08:15] here and saying hey man this morning
[1:08:16] what is that that's him in the Pew
[1:08:18] saying hey man back to his
[1:08:20] word mhm it's a
[1:08:24] truth what he is
[1:08:26] it seeing the Unseen they saw the one
[1:08:31] that was unseeable that's right they
[1:08:35] heard the one that was
[1:08:39] unhearable and Moses literally looked up
[1:08:43] on his
[1:08:45] form wow that's good think about
[1:08:50] it this wasn't some kind of play by
[1:08:53] night
[1:08:55] it wasn't something that somebody made
[1:08:58] up of some kind of
[1:09:00] superstition brother this was God
[1:09:03] literally coming down and doing a
[1:09:06] special work of redemption in that time
[1:09:10] what was it brother Brenham said it was
[1:09:12] God coming to fulfill his word and the
[1:09:15] promise that he had made to Abraham
[1:09:18] you're going down there but one day I'm
[1:09:20] coming to get you ain't that
[1:09:23] wonderful and I love when he appears to
[1:09:26] Moses on the back side of the desert I
[1:09:29] love this I'm sending you down Moses but
[1:09:32] I'm going
[1:09:35] down yes sir I'm going
[1:09:39] down I've heard the cries that's right
[1:09:43] they're
[1:09:44] crying and brother Bram said how does a
[1:09:47] a child get something that he needs from
[1:09:49] his parent or whatever God has provided
[1:09:52] a way might not like it when it's scream
[1:09:55] their thing their breath out and you go
[1:09:58] and you pick them up and they s them
[1:09:59] back down they scream again that's the
[1:10:01] provided way for them to communicate I
[1:10:05] need something and brother bham said
[1:10:08] God's way for his children always has
[1:10:11] been and always will be as you get
[1:10:14] between you and God and begin to cry to
[1:10:16] him begin to cry out to him and ask him
[1:10:21] you know what he'll come on the scene
[1:10:23] cuz if my children come to to me with
[1:10:25] tears in their eyes and pleaded I want
[1:10:28] to tell you I bankrupt myself is that
[1:10:31] right if you love them the right way if
[1:10:33] it's your children you'd bankrupt
[1:10:35] everything God would bankrupt heaven for
[1:10:41] you because you're
[1:10:45] his how much he love you how much he
[1:10:47] love them he said I'm going down
[1:10:50] amen and I'm going to take my paper it's
[1:10:52] going to be me mhm they saw a
[1:10:56] man and brother Bram said it was God
[1:10:59] they didn't understand it in a form of a
[1:11:01] man that was
[1:11:03] Moses so God was in a
[1:11:06] form am and he can take on any
[1:11:12] form
[1:11:14] mhm and to reveal himself because it's
[1:11:18] him and so when you look at these
[1:11:22] scriptures Moses endured
[1:11:25] because he saw the invisible God would
[1:11:29] it wouldn't it help you it's wonderful
[1:11:32] ain't it wouldn't it help you
[1:11:34] so he saw it and so they wrote the
[1:11:38] scripture is that right Moses wrote the
[1:11:40] scripture he wrote the law and he go to
[1:11:43] show you how much God loved him and how
[1:11:45] much God thought of him it's called to
[1:11:48] this day in your Bible Moses
[1:11:50] law so I thought that was God God didn't
[1:11:54] even put his name there he put Moses
[1:11:59] name now see we say he's the same
[1:12:02] yesterday today and forever and
[1:12:06] sometimes we don't literally understand
[1:12:08] what what he's really saying but the
[1:12:09] message explains it yesterday today yeah
[1:12:13] we know God still heals we know God
[1:12:15] still does those things but it goes
[1:12:17] beyond that there's no question that
[1:12:20] God's not not a Healer he's a Healer
[1:12:24] he's a he's a redeemer and he does all
[1:12:27] these things but God does it he never
[1:12:30] changes his plan when he does something
[1:12:33] he's going to do he never changes it or
[1:12:36] goes out of it that's how you know it's
[1:12:40] him Hallelujah ain't that wonderful
[1:12:42] prise God so when you look at that Moses
[1:12:47] pinned the word and all the other
[1:12:50] prophets wrote off of what he originally
[1:12:53] the inspiration the other the prophets
[1:12:56] cuz they always refer back to Moses and
[1:12:59] then they want to get on to us cuz we
[1:13:00] say we brother brandham said brother
[1:13:02] brandham said brother BR what you say
[1:13:04] brother brandham said well didn't they
[1:13:06] say brother Moses
[1:13:09] said
[1:13:11] sir and that seemed to be all right with
[1:13:13] God because he put it in the literal
[1:13:15] scripture Moses law not God's
[1:13:18] law God didn't even put his name in
[1:13:22] there now think about this yeah they say
[1:13:26] I've had people say bro Tim F this mess
[1:13:28] has messed you up you you you you
[1:13:31] crazy it's run you
[1:13:34] crazy well as brother bham said leave me
[1:13:37] alone I'm better off this way than I was
[1:13:39] the other
[1:13:40] way amen they going to call us this and
[1:13:43] that and anyway no matter what you
[1:13:45] anyway so he might as well just DP up
[1:13:48] her and everything yeah that's right
[1:13:51] looking at me amen I'm not ashamed of
[1:13:54] what I believe I'm not ashamed of this
[1:13:56] message I'm not ashamed that God came
[1:13:59] the same way and done more in this hour
[1:14:01] than he ever
[1:14:03] done cuz this
[1:14:06] time all the saints are going to
[1:14:09] rise this time the graveyard is going to
[1:14:12] be empty this time we're going to gather
[1:14:16] together here and I want to tell you

[1:16:25] that cuz you got to
[1:16:28] understand Pharaoh is a
[1:16:32] god he's their son God
[1:16:36] but so actually that's two Gods there
[1:16:40] which when a one of my two Gods
[1:16:44] organ Moses god that's what brother
[1:16:46] Brenham said said come here Aaron I'm
[1:16:49] going to make Moses God he can't talk
[1:16:52] that good so I'm going to help him how
[1:16:54] I'm going to bring you I'm going to make
[1:16:56] Moses god to you and you're going to be
[1:16:59] his
[1:17:02] Prophet
[1:17:04] what people look at say well Tim F you
[1:17:07] are off your roer now you mean to tell
[1:17:10] me God makes a man God now listen to me
[1:17:15] don't you do what other people's run off

[1:17:21] wasn't said but Tim or you de no
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:26] I ain't
[1:17:27] this that and everything I'm just
[1:17:30] telling
[1:17:31] you that's how special it was yeah that
[1:17:35] God could put Moses's name in there
[1:17:39] because Moses represented God to the
[1:17:44] people and what he said was not Moses
[1:17:48] words it was the literal words of God
[1:17:52] being spoke through human lips you say
[1:17:55] that's
[1:17:55] farfetched then what do you celebrate
[1:17:58] this time of year the world are they
[1:18:00] worshiping a
[1:18:03] baby come on they're worshiping a baby
[1:18:07] they're worshiping this and all these
[1:18:10] things of this festive season and I know
[1:18:13] what brother Brenham said about it and
[1:18:15] you stay right down the middle of the
[1:18:16] road with
[1:18:18] it mm you know people want to argue over
[1:18:21] little fine points of Doctrine and
[1:18:23] brother B say if there any questions or
[1:18:25] something they want to keep a question
[1:18:26] going all the time he said don't you get
[1:18:28] involved with
[1:18:30] that because I'm going to tell you
[1:18:32] something here this morning before my
[1:18:34] time's away that we don't have to doubt
[1:18:37] anything this is the most important
[1:18:40] thing what this message was about was
[1:18:42] not final points of Doctrine and what
[1:18:45] this message was about was not to argue
[1:18:49] over this and over that what this
[1:18:52] message was about was somebody come down
[1:18:55] in this hour and he said he's
[1:18:59] here it's always been this coming
[1:19:03] together this morning that it's in vain
[1:19:05] if we're not here because of a
[1:19:11] person Hallelujah this message is not a
[1:19:14] Doctrine this message is not some kind
[1:19:17] of theological seminar that we're going
[1:19:20] to go to this message is God coming down
[1:19:24] in
[1:19:30] person you believe

[1:21:47] helpless as you

[1:21:53] right I'm just inadequate and this as
[1:21:56] helpless as you are and I'm waiting for
[1:21:59] someone to come and then he'd say he's
[1:22:05] here and when he said he's
[1:22:08] here he'd say

[1:32:19] said I'm just trying to be a good
[1:32:22] repeater yeah amen

[1:32:31] message and to repeat it and say what
[1:32:33] was
[1:32:34] said is that's what we need to
[1:32:37] do and stay with that but ain't nobody
[1:32:41] can say it like he can say

[1:32:51] picture and he talks about this the only
[1:32:54] one in color all the one's black and
[1:32:58] white and I thought and and I went back
[1:33:01] yesterday and I'll tell you after you
[1:33:02] get through talking here cuz I looked up
[1:33:05] what he said there what it was how they
[1:33:07] developed that picture and why because
[1:33:09] how many ever seen the old black and
[1:33:10] white photographs that's all people had
[1:33:12] then wasn't
[1:33:13] it it's all black and
[1:33:16] white but I was thinking about this and
[1:33:19] what what I was going to preach to you
[1:33:22] this morning
[1:33:25] and God come and full color to
[1:33:31] us and at that time up to that time
[1:33:34] probably 20 years before this they had
[1:33:36] developed color film and there's just a
[1:33:37] few films and few things that was in
[1:33:41] color and then later on how many members
[1:33:44] Kodak and the instant they got an
[1:33:47] instant well remember remember when you
[1:33:50] had to take it and you had to send it
[1:33:51] off remember and come back and you know
[1:33:54] and it was it was it was a a a
[1:33:59] really technolog that they' never had
[1:34:05] before and I thought ain't that
[1:34:08] wonderful God wanted me to see what
[1:34:11] Ezekiel Saw what John saw oh yes and
[1:34:14] what brother BR was talking
[1:34:18] about that he wasn't far far away this
[1:34:22] God that we

[1:38:19] to close no other people right
[1:38:24] Moses saw his back
[1:38:28] Parts brother Brown said that Moses put
[1:38:30] a veil over
[1:38:32] his his face because the word was in his
[1:38:35] head and his
[1:38:38] mouth but on in Matthew 17 when
[1:38:41] Jesus God performed the great adoption
[1:38:44] with his
[1:38:45] son his whole being
[1:38:49] glistened because he was all of it
[1:38:55] amen and when brother brandham talked
[1:38:57] about this and and if you listen to him
[1:38:59] go back and listen to him he said this
[1:39:02] is the most outstanding of all of them

[1:49:07] words and he says it's too different the
[1:49:10] appearing and the coming will will
[1:49:16] be and he says
