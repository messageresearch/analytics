be fulfilled in US amen well good evening it's good to be here and the musicians can be dismissed and just good to hear the songs of worship and the praise going up to our Lord amen I certainly believe he's worthy of our praise amen we ain't going to want no rocks to cry out in our place we don't want nothing to take our place I want to give it all that I got to the Lord amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and um good to have I believe Joy is it amen well good to have you tonight amen and they have brother Matthew back with us been a while amen and Dad and Mom with us amen and glad Dad was able to make it this evening praise the Lord The Book of Psalms we've been in this for for quite a while um the 23rd chapter and says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. I maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Steel Waters he restoreth my soul eliteth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me I want to stop right there and may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord father we're so glad then you have the final say over our lives over this world our future whatever you have created you Reign you rule over it all father we find that even Satan is limited to what he can do and it's only because you allow him to do it and father we give you all praise we give you glory tonight for you're still on the throne and oh God we're just asking that you would be with us now that you would speak Lord through your word and that every heart would be edified may we be drawn closer to you father oh God we just declare our love to you we thank you for all that you've done for us we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated tonight and trust you had a good day today this is a beautiful one that's for sure and um it's always a good day when you're serving the lord some days can be a little gloomy and all depending on the weather I guess but uh other than that it's always bright if if we've got the light within us amen but thinking of this he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness and of course we know uh there is a a certain requirement that Jesus had and still has for those who are going to follow of course he's he's not going to be the follower he's going to be the leader and he requires those to follow him and if we're going to follow him there's that requirement you know uh he said in one place let him deny himself and follow me let him take up his cross and follow me to the rich man he said sell all that thou Hast and give it to the poor and follow me that there's always the requirements and of course many people can't follow it's just um because it's it's self-sacrifice it's it's a requirement that um uh uh well the only ones that can follow is the Sheep for for that's what Jesus said you know he said my sheep hear my voice and they follow me ain't that right so he leads by his voice and his sheep uh they they follow and so David is saying here he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness and we we know that it's not a carnal leading it's it's a supernatural leading it's it's the supernatural that is leading us and God is Supernatural so for us to follow the lord we have to believe in the Supernatural how many believes in the Supernatural you believe in the Supernatural I do and and you have to believe in the Supernatural uh because uh uh he has a way of leading and and we we can't tell him how to lead God must be the one to do the leading ain't that rhyme now brother Branham said if we follow man then we're we're miserable but if we'll just follow the Holy Spirit he'll lead us to every promise of the Bible do you believe that he'll lead us to every promise of the Bible then he says may everything be fulfilled in the people's lives here today well I believe that this is the time this is the age this is the season for all the word of God to be fulfilled do you believe that not a part of the word but all of the word it it must be God's word must be fulfilled a man and for he said and we said it read it many times there in the in Isaiah where he said my word will not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sin it ain't that right now we know what the prophet said there in this day uh where it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness uh brother Branham said that that word righteousness is God's word so it must it becometh us to fulfill all God's word amen that's what the righteousness is is God's word and so therefore walking the paths of righteousness and fulfilling the all-righteousness is the same thing amen and that is fulfilling God's word for this day ain't that right he leads us in the paths of righteousness and and it's not book learning it's it's not a really a code of conduct uh uh or or or a form of legalism or a form of worship but it's it's actually just uh uh fulfilling the word of God ain't that right see that's a path that every believer of God a man has to walk and that is the path of righteousness uh fulfilling God's word and so we we we find that when Jesus came he came to fulfill the word of God uh which spoke of him to do a man that was his whole goal that was his whole purpose that was his motive that was his Drive was to fulfill the word of God for he said that that I do nothing but what the father first show me and he says my meat is to do the will of him that that sent me ain't that right well that's not only in Jesus but that's every believer that is here today their meat is to do the will of the father amen and and and and and we pray just as Jesus taught us to pray and and and that is not my will but thine be done it's it's thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven ain't that right and so all of his life Jesus was led by the spirit of God we've read this before but brother Branham said no matter if he was in a storm and The gales knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in the face of mess of demons he if he was if if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him see he walked right on along just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around around him that's right whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because God said so do you believe that he he laid his his comfort was in the word of God and our comfort is in the word God said so that's it ain't that right amen he said he didn't say oh I wonder if I pray through wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscience that's right he believed what God Said was truth see the words must be fulfilled everybody say the word must be fulfilled amen wake up every morning and say the word must be fulfilled amen when you go to bed at night the word must be fulfilled the trial that you face the word must be fulfilled amen anything that you go through the word must be fulfilled and he knew his his life was to fulfill them Jesus walked on the earth with the purpose knowing that his life was to fulfill the word of God then brother Branham says and you're here to fulfill it too amen say I am here to fulfill it I am here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of fear walk in conscience of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right hand or to the left just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep walking with God he said Enoch one day walk like that amen so now your brother Braham showing us how Enoch walked amen he just walked along with God Amen not caring about nothing else not fearing nothing else not worrying about nothing else he just walked with God ain't that rap amen and you have to walk like that if you're going to walk in the paths of righteousness ain't that right amen yes sir amen he says see you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore amen and I believe that's where a lot of us are tonight amen we just don't want to go back to where we came from ain't that right no trial big enough no sickness be strong enough no devil amen uh uh uh uh bad enough a man to make us want to go back so the word of God must be fulfilled in your life and there's nothing more amen for you to do than to fulfill the word of God nothing more better for you to do than to fulfill the word of God and I'm so glad that we could all be part of it amen whether you're rich whether you're poor whether you're smart whether you're dumb whether you're a beautiful whether you're ugly whether you're fat you're skinny tall short whatever amen your purpose is is to fulfill the word of God Amen seek now if we're the bride if we are the Bride of Jesus Christ Christ then we have to fulfill all the word that speaks of the Bride for this age amen not one word can be left out do you believe that amen seed this bride she is to unite with him as husband and wife for that's the word for this age ain't that right she is to take on his name for that is the word for this age amen this is the age that she the bride of Christ becomes Miss Jesus Christ that that that isn't just a fantasy that is a reality there is a mortal people on this Earth that have taken on the name of Jesus Christ how did she get there he led her there amen that's exactly right amen see you can't walk the paths of righteousness and not take on his name so whatever she does she does in the name of Jesus Christ amen whatever she says as she does it in the name of Jesus Christ she prays in his name she sings in his name she preaches in his name she worships in his name she gathers in his name ain't that right I thought of listening to a message the other day and brother Branham talks of the time that there is a meeting I think in 60. I I think it was on the news the Jesus movement or something like that but they gathered Protestants and Catholics all gathered 150 000 brother Branham thought a man was there to say prayers and so forth but notice what he says he said they might as well not even gathered because it had no value to God you understand what I'm saying amen you see there's a bride though that when she gathers it has everything to do with God it has value to do with God and Jesus said it didn't matter if there was only two or three that were gathered in his name he would show up the God of heaven will never be too busy Amen to come in the presence of two or three a man that have gathered in his name it isn't a bunch that that makes the difference it is in the thousands of gathering a man that moves God is a people that is called and bearing the name of Jesus Christ Well church we are to fulfill amen that tonight amen yes sir she is the only one that has his name she is identified with him in the fact that she is one with him do you believe that I'm talking about the paths of righteousness for our day amen we've come God's been leading the church all the way up into this age and here we are everything that he has thought about the mystery and the heart desire that he has longed for is now being fulfilled in a people in this age and you ain't going to miss it can you say amen for he's leading you in the paths of righteousness that's right see she is one with him she is loyal to him and him alone she is faithful to him and to him alone she serves him and to him alone okay ain't that right she cares for him and him alone and what is he he is the word ain't that right he is the word and you know what she is the protector of him you believe that she is the protector of him you say well God's my protective but what about you protecting him he's the word ain't that right you remember what what Abraham God told Abraham he had to sway that sacrifice amen and and and so it it seemed to be just he had to wait all day and there's that sacrifice and there was the buzzards a man that was trying to land on that sacrifice and the Bible says that Abraham shoot all the birds off and brother Brown said that is the type of the believer today that is shoeing off every unbelieving devil off of this word of God Amen there is a people on the Earth it's already written that you're going to defend the word it's already written that you will be a protector of him can you say Amen yes sir amen we're not going to let unbelief come into the church we're not going to let unbelief come in our home we're not going to let unbelief come into our heart we're not going to let unbelief can you say amen amen come in and have its way amen we are the protector of him that's right see and also if we are the church Church of the Living God then we have to fulfill all the word that speaks of the church and we know what church means it means called out ones ain't that right amen says so in this age God has a people he's called his people to come out of her ain't that right see that that's walking the paths of righteousness amen you're coming out of her why why did you leave your denominations why have you forsaken amen the traditions and the doctrines and the ideas of of men that have been Pastor the generation say Amen because you have come to walk in the paths of righteousness to fulfill the word of God Amen a man cannot walk in the paths of righteousness as long as he refuses to come out of her many people come into this message still holding the Baptist ways Pentecostal ways Methodist ways can you say amen amen it's sad to believe that here is a a supernatural message that God has Vindicated over and over and over supernaturally and you got people that don't even believe in the Supernatural and they say it among the Church of the Living God they don't believe in miracles they don't believe in healing they don't believe in a new birth they don't believe in a messy birth hey man they don't believe in the gifts anymore they don't believe in nothing amen they just want the church to become dead and formal but if you're walking in the paths of righteousness you've got to believe the word of God and if he is the same yesterday today and forever then you can't put limits on God Amen you can't believe God in a certain way and deny him the rest of the way know this bride this church is going to believe in it all can you say amen that's right see amen see it's in this time see you're not walking in the paths of righteousness if the token isn't on display for we're living in the time of the Third Exodus amen not just playing church amen it's that's over with amen coming to church and doing our little thing amen that's over with amen just come in and being insincere that's over with amen the church has moved up God is now requiring a token in the evening time ain't that right yes sir and that token has to be over the door ain't that right and we've heard what the prophet said the door is your heart where's the token going to be not on your emotions but in your heart amen not on Sensations but in your heart ain't that right and we know that it's not the chemistry of the blood that is required it's the life that is in the blood that is required ain't that right well Church you know we know what kind of a blood that you were saved by you wasn't saved by the blood of a goat the blood of a of a sheep you were saved by the blood of God Amen therefore God requires his own life to be at the door of your heart on display amen and what is at your heart it's your soul ain't that right and in that Soul the prophet said he's a predestinated seed of God that God laid in there before the foundation of the world do you believe that yes sir see so that's the real you ain't that right that's the real you what God thought you to be what God ordained you to be amen is at the door of your heart ain't that right and it all becomes quickened amen when that token comes in that token life comes into your heart and is on display amen everything that God called you to be and ordained you to be amen that now becomes Quicken you're no more a sinner you are a son of God you can never be a sinner again amen for the eternal life of God is at the door of your heart and every word that God has promised you is now quickened inside of you brother Adam said he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy Spirit and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word may manifest or quickened Hallelujah Made Alive so when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it why there's no question amen or do you love him yes sir so I thank God for token life a man see and you cannot be part of the church a man walking these Paths of righteousness and not fulfill the last commission that God that Christ gave the church ain't that right Mark 16 15 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe aren't you glad for that the sign shall follow them believe that believe now brother Brown said these are some of the signs that'll follow the believer Amen in my name they shall cast out devils not give ear to them Devils but cast them Devils out every unbelieving devil cast it out every devil of fear casteth out every devil of anxiety casted out this world is so possessed with demons it ain't funny amen hell has come to the surface the lid has been lifted off and every demon of hell is manifesting itself in the people of the Earth today can you say Amen but now there is a people that's on this Earth amen that he's leading in the paths of righteousness and he gives you the authority cast that devil out that Spirit of depression casted out that Spirit of trouble casted out can you say Amen you're not a weaker beggarly people you are a strong people amen that are walking in the paths of righteousness you have the authority to cast it out you have the authority to cast that devil of depression out you have that Authority in the name of Jesus Christ they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall not might they shall recover ain't that right so so these are walking in the paths of righteousness if you're a Son of God then you've got to walk the paths of righteousness amen we're scriptures that speak of the sons of God must be fulfilled in this age do you believe that amen yes sir so we're living in the time of adoption ain't that right this is adoption age so you can't be part of Bride and let that adoption slip You by don't you worry God's Gonna lead you there God will bring you to it amen you see we're not trying to make these things happen he's leading we're not worried about missing the Rapture there is a God that'll make sure we're going to get there he's hard to provide of the way it's not a straight it's like being trying to abduct trying to teach a duck how to swim you don't have to learn how to swim it's in him to swim he's already got it made to swim it's he's got the material it god-given material Amen to float on that water it's a law that's given to him well it's a law that's been given to you we're not living life threatening and worrying and wondering and hoping and groping oh no we're living in a life amen just following Our Shepherd he's the one that's leading us you see the manifestations of sun is happening now brother Brown said the same power that rested in Jesus Christ rest in the placed sons in the body of Christ ain't that right same power I'll say it the same deity same God same Authority same life same Dynamics it rested upon him now at rest upon you as sons of God ain't that right see it's a placing of a son take him out in a certain place and have a ceremony before Angels Place him positionally what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority ain't that right he said let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that I'm speaking of will everybody say will be done there will be a power put into the church and is now coming in that the Holy Spirit Will sowing on to people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen Powers like coming into the church now now that was that was 60 60 years ago or so amen when he spoke that uh uh these words or maybe even more amen but here we are standing I believe with all my heart that them powers are now resting upon the church amen the world is in her position politics is in her position Russia is in her position Israel is in her position and I believe with all my heart this church is in her position amen amen amen she is stemmed the test she has stood the trial she has stood believing with all of her heart protecting that word and now it's time for her to fulfill what God has spoken of her I just believe it can you say Amen yes sir he said I know it for a fact we haven't seen power like's coming into the church now he said there will be a power put in the church and now is coming in and that the Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen Powers likes coming into the church he said I know it for a fact say unto this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said shall come to pass and you can have what you said ain't that amazing how that scripture is now applicable Amen to you and I it's at your disposal at the time that hell has been Unleashed we in a people God didn't call us in this age just sit there and say woe is me oh poor poor pity me I just don't know what I'm gonna do I I just I don't even know if I'm going to make it if you're the sons of God he is going to lead you he is leading you into these scriptures the church is moving into these scriptures can you say man why it must be fulfilled of you don't you look at how powerful the devil is don't you look at the Giants standing before you look at the promise David looked at the promise Samson looked at the promise Gideon looked at the promise if he can do it as mortal men as a natural seed what can you do as a supernatural seed it's time for the church to rise up and I say she's here she's here why he's leading Us in these Paths of righteousness amen he said see the placing the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then critic Smiles will be shut it'll be a short time Jesus come right off the mountain stray went straight to Calvary notice it won't long last long but it'll be here ain't that right why he's leading a people there's a people following him amen they denied themselves they denied their reasonings they've denied their senses they've denied it all they they they're looking to him and him alone and they're protector of the promise can you say Amen amen yes sir yet in in all of this walking in the the paths of righteousness David lets us know that we're walking in the Valley of the shadow of death see God doesn't lead us then in the paths of righteousness when we get into the Millennium a man see but he leads us now amen while we're walking in the Valley of the shadow of death it's not a dark Valley brother Brown said most people a man have have mistaken that and they've misquoted it by saying he leadeth me or though I walk in the dark Valley of the shadow of death but he said see if there's a shadow then it's not a dark Valley amen because there's a shadow ain't that right it's not a dark Valley so there has to be a certain amount of light to make a Shadow if it's all light there cannot be a shadow if it's all dark there cannot be a shadow ain't that right amen so we we we live in a world of Darkness but we can save praise God it's not all dark ain't that right it's not all dark now gross Darkness upon the people but there's a scripture that same scripture that will tell us it's not all dark amen that's right it's see we live in a world that's full of trouble and trials but it's not all troubles and trials amen we live in a world of unbelief but it's not all unbelief belief amen it's not all negative it's positive can you say man why the light is shining ain't that right the light is shining look at us amen we are both natural and Supernatural amen so we are dealing with both sides of the Corn so to speak Amen in our natural birth we were born defeated but yet there's another birth a man that does not leave us in darkness ain't that right it's in our Supernatural birth that we were born to overcome in our natural birth we didn't stand a chance but in our spiritual birth we got every reason Amen to make it and you're going to make it there is no if ands or buts you're going to make it can you say Amen you're in a shadow that's right as Believers we've had our share of Trials but also we've had our share of Triumph ain't that Ron we've had our share of tears and sorrow and Agony but we have shed our tears of joy we've had times in our life where we've tasted a man defeat and yet at the same time we've in in our lives in this whole body and this whole world we've tasted Sweet Victory amen we've known what it is like not to feel the presence of the Lord we've gone maybe months years of not feeling his presence and it would seem like it would be that way forever amen but then we've known a man that that that were times where the presence of God is so strong Upon Our Lives amen that when we pray he's right there before we pray amen we're just thinking about it our prayer is answered can you say Amen we've had our share of rejoicing in his presence and feel him near we've had our times of discouragement and yet we've had our times of encouragement ain't that right amen I look at Paul's life and and he he kind of expresses this Valley of shadowness amen for he says there in second Corinthians 4 6 for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ to give the light ain't that right amen but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels not Angelic bodies but in the vessel that you have now a vessel that was born in sin a vessel that that is subject to corruption uh that is subject to vanity that is subject to sickness that's subject to these things and yet we have a treasure that is eternal in the same vessel can you say man oh my so we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us listen to what he said we are troubled on every side but not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair aren't you glad that we're walking in the Valley of the shadow where there's a shadow there yes sir persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed amen always bearing about in the body of the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body so we're bearing in our lives in our body a a death amen of suffering amen but at the same time there's a life that has been made manifest through the same body it's a paradox I know that he's leading us for we for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life everybody saved the life also if Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh my my my how can a man speak of death and life at the same time amen but see we're a reflection of something aren't we that's right see so no matter how dark it gets for the believer there will always be light aren't you glad for the Hat you know Paul explains what makes a Believer rise a man when it seemed like he's down for the count Romans 8 and 16 the the spirit everybody say the spirit say the spirit that is one that's leading this a man beareth witness with our spirit that we are children of God now listen you're in a world a valley of shadow of death you're hearing that that negative and yet you're hearing the positive you're hearing that you ain't going to make it but yet there's the spirit of God that tells you you're going to make it amen you're hearing of you know how many people that I've talked to that sits in church that is afraid that they've already crossed the line and there's no way of Mercy getting back and yet there's the spirit of God that tells us a man that you are sons of God you're the children of God ain't that right but notice and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature Wade is for the manifestation of the sons of God notice for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who the same has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered can you say that with me I shall be delivered that's a promise you didn't say the creature might be he said they shall be shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groanth and travaileth and pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body now notice what Paul is saying here and I hope this is all right I hope I'm making a little sense to you anyway we were made subject to vanity what was it trials tribulations testings Temptations sickness and pain and heartaches diseases discouragements challenges I mean every faces them letting him beat now now listen it'd be something if we could just avoid all of this and say he leadeth me in the paths of event of of of of of of righteousness and all we can talk about is Victory and all we can talk about is glorious times and all we can talk about is just abiding in his presence and all we can talk about amen is and know nothing else amen but that's not the case amen he subjected these people us and that is leading to the the the the paths of righteousness he subjected us into this Valley amen of shadow of death amen he subjected us to vanity can you say Amen now of suffering and loneliness and and feeling Forsaken and feeling amen rejected and feeling unworthy and feeling amen like I I just can't go on anymore and and he allows us in in a place to where we can hear the voices of the devil amen that would tell us how unworthy we are and how hopeless we are and how wretched we are can you say man he has subjected us into these things we didn't subject ourselves to this God by reason of his own reason his own purpose have subjected us amen for his purpose he had a reason for allowing this to happen amen the Bible says the steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord do you believe that amen all the and I'm so glad that the Lord is the all-wise god he's the only wise God he does things in wisdom he knows how to ordain he knows the path that you're going to take amen but just be remembered it's not a dark Valley it's a valley that has a shadow brother Brown says Jonah we know him we know he was a prophet many of them referred to him as some kind of a Runabout he wasn't the footsteps of righteousness ordered of the Lord he said I was reading the book not long ago he did go to Tarsus or start a to it instead of Nineveh but that was all everybody say that was all in God's plans that was all in God's plans see the footsteps of the righteous because sometimes the evil befalls you or something see it was so with job amen see job was the best man in the land in his days best man God could find and yet look what happened to him see God wasn't chastening him amen God was trying him God was proven to Satan he had somebody that would believe him in the face of difficulty God loves to prove to the devil that there's going to be somebody to believe him amen no matter how dark it gets and no matter how rugged it gets or no matter how alone they have to stand amen it does not matter it'll prove to the devil amen that there will be somebody amen there's somebody on this Earth that will not forsake the path of righteousness can you say Amen that's right hang on do it he led the children to the Red Sea they were trapped and it looked like God had led them into a trap ain't that right amen he led them through the Wilderness amen and he led them straight to Bitter Waters that's right brother Brown said let him write into temptation right into where the waters was bitter and they couldn't drink they had nothing to eat listen now these are God's people that was on the path to duty these God's people that was walking fulfilling the word of God for their day and God would not lead them to an oasis he led them to Bitter Waters where they had nothing to eat they had nothing to drink it was a Temptation ain't that right he said see look that stream of Myra bitter Waters laid right in God's path he was leading his children isn't it strange look like God would have bypassed that but he led them right straight up to that water see some to the waters some through the floods some through deep trials but all through the blood that's God's way of leading his people you ain't going to be able to create your own Oasis if God has led you out in the desert hey man but I promise you he'll not leave you you'll not forsake you he's already ordained your end can you shame man amen the best thing that we can do is relax the best thing we can do is put our lives in God's hands and let him have control it doesn't matter don't question God don't question his leadership amen you just follow the shepherd and you say man see you're here to fulfill the word but you are doing it in the valley where there's a shadow in it amen now brother Brown said yesterday people don't know you know we look at brother branham's life and water Revelation that we've caught that he was Malachi for that his ministry was Luke 17 30. Revelation 10 amen first Thessalonians 4. and it was Matthew 25 the voice of the bridegroom amen it was come out of her The Voice the Fulfillment of come out of her my people amen all these scriptures and and we can we we have the Revelation that has struck our hearts that this applies to brother Branham and his message he was the seventh age messenger ain't that right amen and it would look if we all stood back and we could look and say oh man that must have been an easy life for him God ordained it to be so godful and here he was fulfilling it must have been easy for him to fulfill it amen but notice what brother Brown said people don't know what depressing times comes with this type of ministry he said yesterday I got real depressed and I said to my wife I wish I could just go on and she said why do you say that bill now and I want you to know that he knew that he was to fulfill Elijah he knew he was Malachi 4 he knew as the Revelation began to grow it with him he began to understand and see his place in scriptures do you believe that and yet this is a man that got discouraged this is the man that wanted to go home brother Brown says and why do you say that he says oh here I have Troublesome things and then it seemed like the holy spirit said are you trying to bypass them what a rebuke the Holy Spirit didn't just sit there and baby and says oh bless your heart I wished I made you a little different I wish I would have made you like a real angel you know that had no troubles and trials and all that so you could fulfill my word accurately or correctly or without any troubles and problemses and hindrances and all of that amen but that wasn't a that wasn't what God said to him he said are you trying to bypass these things are you trying to dodge them no I said just let me stand right up in the face of it all and face it out it's so much better and he says honestly truly I say this by eyewitness that just after this life is over we enter a land that's beyond anything that anyone could ever think amen see so your Valley is not all dark there's a light in the valley amen that gives us a hope to keep looking on to keep pressing on Amen we're leading being led Amen in the paths of righteousness in this Valley a man of shadow of death yeah see the valley that you're walking through is not a dark Valley there's light and that is our hope is this okay there's a light light is our hope now notice psalms 27 1 the Lord is my light and my salvation then there's the question Whom Shall I Fear the valley isn't so dark after all huh the Lord my shepherd amen he's the one that's leading me in these Paths of righteousness as I'm walking through this Valley of the dark shadow of the shadow of death amen and and Dave is now writing of him and saying that he's my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life I thought of that you know here you know uh and I'm going to use my dad for for a moment but that person amen has got him so weak many times and you know tonight he was telling me so my legs would just feel like here you know uh uh just trembling you know it's I've I've been doing good all day today and and and he says it just hit me and I I'm just so weak you know and and yet here he is tonight man I have to say that that scripture has been fulfilled amen the Lord is his strength amen the Lord is his strength when you feel like you can't go on I don't care if it's spiritually physically mentally the Lord is your strength how many can say the Lord is my strength amen when you thought you couldn't make it but the Lord is my strength I could testify that to you tonight hey man what I want to give up when I wanted to walk away when I say there ain't no way God get me out of this thing and I have to say the Lord is my strength [Music] of whom shall I be afraid of what shall I be afraid what devil shall I be afraid for the Lord is my strength he is my light can you say Amen you say but I'm going through a dark Valley but I say to you it's not all dark amen there's a shadow it's just a shadow look to a light there's a light somewhere amen that's guiding you Psalms 11905. Thy word everybody say Thy Word now he's saying the Lord is my light now he's saying Thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light unto my path so is it two no it's one and the same it's the Living Word that is a light to my path ain't that right Amen in Jesus said my word is spirit and life so it's not just this on written form amen pages but now it's spirit and it's life brother Brown said the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form ain't that right and then you see when it is quickened or brought to life now when is that word quicken in you ain't that right the seed is laying in you ain't that right what is written in here now becomes in you quickened amen and brought to life see it's the spirit of the word that goes to work and acts is that all right as a preacher I can't lead you in the paths of righteousness amen all we can do is preach the promises all we do is preach amen what the what is in this word that it takes the spirit of the word to come inside of you and to Quicken that word and then watch that word go to work you're lacked ain't that right then it becomes your light it becomes your salvation ain't that right then the Lord your shepherd's leading you in the paths of righteousness you can't be led by through Seminary you can't be led by sitting on a Pew in the front Pew for a hundred years it takes the Lord to lead you and his leading will Quicken you John 14 16 Jesus says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive the world will not receive it because it seeth him not neither knoweth him so they have no relationship there's no leadership they're following their own devices cunning fables and and cunning devices amen they're being led by the very own lust within them and all these things but now he's talking to you but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you who who's going to come to you the spirit of the word can you say Amen the spirit of the word amen just to think that you were in a dark uh dark denominationalism and dark all of these things but then the light came to you and quickened the word to you ain't that right he says now Jesus goes on says at that day at that day the day of his coming Revelation 6 10 1 and first Thessalonians 4 16 describes it as the dissension of Our Lord ain't that right at that day I will come to you and you will know that I'm in the father and me and him and I in you you and me and I and you ain't that right oh my see now notice see so the spirit of the word how many believes the spirit of the word is here it's here Revelations 10 1's been fulfilled amen uh first Thessalonians 4 16 is is being fulfilled right now yes sir and more scripture we could go on and on and on but he's here the spirit of the word is here how else can you make it in this Darkly odyssea you couldn't do it but your light is here amen notice as 60 uh Isaiah 61 tells us what we are to do when this happens what does it say arise everybody say arise shine hahaha for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee amen what's happened the spirit of the word has come to lead you into the word lead you into the promises that have been laying dormant for years and years and years do you realize Paul said they without us cannot be made perfect brother Branham applies that to this day they without us I know Paul was talking about the amen the the the the Old Testament Saints but look at all the saints that have gone before you you are the finale of it all you are the completion of the picture you are the completion of God's drama you are the completion of what God had in his mind you are it and all the saints went that have gone before us they without us cannot be made perfect do you believe that so God didn't make you an angel God didn't make you in in some Invincible Superman amen as as or Spider-Man or this or that or that as the movies want a bad display amen he took a common born human being brother shamaya and he sent the spirit of his word to you to Quicken that see Gene word that is in you and you now become a living manifestation of the word of God he's leading you in the paths of righteousness something that Seminary could have never done something that theologians have tried to do for years and have never been able to do it something that uh denominations have tried to do and they've only quenched the spirit and they've died out but now in this age every promise in this book is now being made manifest in a people the time for you to fulfill the word has come the word had already been laying here written for this age but had been waiting for you the actor you say well God God's the actor and that's rightly so God had a certain mask [Music] God wanted to look a certain ways sister Rhonda so he waited for you is in this age Billy wanted to wait for a certain time so I could pick you before the foundation of the world he would say in this day I'm going to use this mask I'm going to use this form and I'm going to live in him and brother Brown said in one place that God chose to defeat his enemy through you sister Brenda amen God chose to defeat his enemy through a people he said I'm going to live in them people I'm going to have preeminence in them people and I'll defeat my enemy you understand why he's not going to take you from the enemy he's not going to take you from your challenges he's not going to take you away from problems he's going to defeat them problems through you he's going to defeat the enemy through you he's going to defeat and remember this is the worst age ever this is the most evil age ever but there's still a path that he is leading a people too and it's a path of Victory it's a path that is ordained for a people from this age for this time for this moment and you're that people that he's leading time amen amen praise Lord yes the word concerning you has come thy word thy light has come and as David said Thy word O Lord is what has caused me to Hope go to The Valleys with Thy word O Lord has caused me to Hope we have to cry and shed our tears of sovereign loneliness but when it's done it's not all dark for Thy Word has caused me to Hope and you say man he may have subjected me to defeat but defeat's not my end he may have subjected me to a life of testing and trials but according to his word there's an end to that all right he may have subjected me to a life of sickness and suffering but that's not my end and Thy Word has caused me to Hope can you say man see Psalms 30 and 5 weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning it just shows you you're walking through the valley of shadow of death amen Psalms 119 50. this is my comfort in my Affliction this is my comfort in my Affliction for Thy Word quickened me first or Psalms 119 47 and I will Delight myself in thy Commandments which I have loved my hands also will I lift up unto thy Commandments which I have loved and I will meditate in thy statues can you say Amen Amen brother Branham said this this body is subject to death and was brought forth by a woman not by nothing but through not by God you're a reproduction from Adam and Eve be black white or whatever you are you are a production and Offspring from Adam and Eve that makes your body born in sin shaping in iniquity come to the world speaking lies you're damned and condemned at the beginning of your life not even even with a Chance uh you see without a chance see he says now because the spirit that you have come to you by nature and by Nature coming from sexual intercourse desired by man and woman produces an Earthly child let that child alone and don't teach him nothing right he'll go wrong don't teach him neither right nor wrong he'll take wrong because it's his nature to do such watch a little baby not over higher than that he gets so mad and he'll just you know he ring his hands and and turn red in the face and hold his breath what is it it's his nature he got it from his Pappy or his Mammy see one she had enough temper to fight a buzzsaw or his daddy they didn't see his grandfather grandmother did see if they didn't see it's Offspring so see that makes your born in the world you come by nature and your whole being is black and smutty and Damned and cursed and going to hell see that's right see but when you're born again then the light of God shines down into that soul and then it's no more a dark Valley it's a valley with a shadow in it you may be veiled here with the Flesh and things known by faith but there's enough light in there and someday that light and darkness has to separate and when the light shines Darkness flees and when we go to be with Christ in that body darkness and death vanishes and we burst out into Perfect Light glory to God there we are no more sickness no more dark mixed with it no more pain no more Agony no more heartbreak no more loneliness no more confusion no more trials no more Darkness with it it's now in the perfect light you will not be walking in a valley with a shadow in it that you'll be walking with a perfect light and the Darkness will be gone it'll be destroyed it'll be utterly gone aren't you looking forward to that time to think that the Glorious time of gathering in this building amen that we can lift up holy hands and worship our lamb and our creator and our King and yet we do it with mind battles we do it with the pressure we do it of of with life hanging all over his head and the things that we're going through but there will be a day that you'll do the very same thing and there will be no trouble there will be no trial there'll be no headaches there will be no heartaches there will be no pain to hold you back yeah you'll be rejoicing around the throne Darkness will be gone how do I know it's there because he's leading us in the paths of righteousness and it's already been written that there is a day that is coming will be known that can you say Amen oh do you love him isn't he wonderful yes sir I'm closing now brother Brown said Shake Yourself right quick and look out here where we're at where are we he said like those wise men were right in line with his word and the light of the Lord is shining upon our path Lord be to God in the highest and glory be to God who give us Jesus Christ who we love and has brought us to this place we are his people bought with the price of his blood oh my when the uniting time comes we're looking like we United with another one another in the bonds of his Spirit can it be a spirit sure it's his Spirit why is it it's his word and he is the spirit of the word and when that Spirit of Promise comes upon you and vindicates and shows itself right here is it the same Spirit it was the one that was with Moses in the wilderness it was the one that was Upon Jesus Christ he's the one meant Paul Saul on his road to Damascus and he's the same yesterday today and forever and he does the same thing he said see we see the Nations together we see the church heads together we see communism together we see the isms uniting we see all of these things and now we see the bride uniting with the word we're not going in our own different directions we're now being led we've got a leader we've got a headship and he's now able to have preeminence over a body on this Earth and he's now united we are now as the bride of Christ United with the word of God that is true amen he said it's time that the Saints shall rise to unite with those that are that are living and go and Unite with Jesus Christ for eternity may God help us everyone to unite with Christ tonight surrender our everything that we are everything that we have our whole soul body and mind to Jesus Christ and look for the time of that uniting when the trumpet of God shall sound and time shall be no more and the morning breaks Eternal bright and fair when the dead in Christ shall rise and gather over on the other Shore Yonder with the bride that's alive seed to be caught up together see see look at the uniting god uniting the church with his word and the word of the word with the church that they both become the same see say this and it'll happen do this and it'll happen this is it see this is me before you this is me he says proving God is telling us this is me before you this is me proving it this is me with you how many believes that God Vindicated the message of this age to let us know it's him that's with us the time has come the handwriting is on the wall for the world been a great time for the church and he's leading us don't fear don't worry as the prophet said in in Shalom put your future in his hands trust him trust him because he's what's leading you got you stay humble stay willing stay flexible and let him be the one to guide you can you say man and if you'll look at the light the word your Valley is not so dark after all for thou art with me I shall fear no evil for thou art with me you love him if the musicians will come brother Branham says [Applause] brother Branham says right now we have both sickness and joy and have health and strength and we have ins and outs and ups and downs and joy and sorrow and so forth well it's just a shadow we got enough light to know that there's light there and we're still in the body and flesh but someday the day is going to break that's when the death angel sits at the foot of the bed and that's when the doctor says it's all finished and this natural comes away from the supernatural and the light Springs back to light and darkness goes back to Darkness then this Mortal puts on immortality that's when this corruption puts on incorruption that's when this Mortal puts on immortality and we become a creature from we become from a creature of time to a creature of Eternity you cannot go out there with total darkness you've got to have light in the Darkness there you are and that's the body you receive can you say Amen Hallelujah church we know we know the day that we're living in just any moment we're going to be changed all the signs and the time are pointing to it [Music] and this Earthly hole has no limits it it it has no bounds to us it has no hope to us it hosts no grasp to us for he Our Shepherd is leading us it's the supernatural that is with us we don't know how it's going to happen but one of these days [Music] the hair that we've lost is going to return the old black hair that has turned gray it's gonna go back black again [Music] the back that has been over it's going to straighten up again all the wrinkles will be gone cold will be turned Young [Music] why he's leading us
