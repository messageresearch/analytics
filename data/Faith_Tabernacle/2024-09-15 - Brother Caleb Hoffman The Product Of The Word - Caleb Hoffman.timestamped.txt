[34:10] but there's more for us than there are
[34:13] against us and the servant couldn't
[34:15] understand and he said Lord opened his
[34:17] eyes that he might see that and he
[34:20] looked up and there was just we were
[34:22] they were
[34:24] surrounded and I just started to see
[34:28] just think about who has gone on and and
[34:31] you know at that night sister Martha was

[34:35] what if what if brother and sister
[34:39] Meredith are just sitting there beside
[34:41] of her what if what if Faith was sitting
[34:45] by herself and I thought what if Sister

[34:52] worshiping we're going to get through
[34:53] this and I just I just thought you know

[42:20] pastor brother Jonathan Martin I know
[42:21] he's no he's no stranger to you guys but
[42:24] we bring greetings from them uh if we
[42:27] and let's just go ahead and go right
[42:28] into the scripture turn to the Book of
[42:30] John in the first chapter in the first
[42:43] verse John 1 and one it would say in the
[42:46] beginning was the word and the Word was
[42:49] with God and the Word was God and the
[42:52] same was in the beginning with God and
[42:54] skipping on down to verse 14 and the
[42:57] word was made flesh and it dwelt among
[42:59] us and we beheld his glory the glory as
[43:01] of the only begotten of the father full
[43:04] of grace and truth amen I love that and
[43:08] from there going to Matthew the 15th
[43:09] chapter and the 30th
[43:13] verse he would say here and great
[43:15] multitudes came unto him having with
[43:18] them those that were lame blind dumb
[43:21] maimed and many others and they cast
[43:23] them down at Jesus's feet or I believe
[43:26] we could say they cast them down at the
[43:27] word's feet and he healed them in so
[43:30] much that the multitude wondered when
[43:32] they saw the dumb to speak the maimed to
[43:34] be made whole the lame to walk the blind
[43:37] to see and they glorified the god of
[43:39] Israel amen what a day of testimonies
[43:42] that must have been the prophet of God
[43:44] would say take him at his word then it's
[43:46] all over on God and not on you as long
[43:48] as you take God at his word then the
[43:50] word will produce what it promised to do
[43:53] and this morning we'd like to take for a
[43:54] title the product of the word
[43:57] let's bow our heads dear father Lord we
[43:59] come before you this morning Lord we
[44:01] want to thank you for giving us this
[44:02] opportunity Lord to Lord to be here Lord
[44:05] to stand before Lord these Saints of
[44:06] like Precious Faith father Lord before
[44:08] the Bride of Jesus Christ and deliver
[44:10] your word Lord as we enter into the
[44:12] service I ask Lord that we've Lord we've
[44:14] already felt your spirit we've already
[44:15] felt your anointing and I ask that Lord
[44:17] I know there's nothing that I could say
[44:18] there's nothing I could preach that
[44:19] would Lord that would be any sort of a
[44:21] help to these people but if you would
[44:22] just move me aside Lord and you would
[44:24] just Lord you would just speak through
[44:26] me and you use this broken vessel Lord
[44:28] to speak your word Lord and I know that
[44:29] you can meet every need in the building
[44:31] Lord you can heal every broken body you
[44:33] can touch every broken soul you can meet
[44:35] every need so Lord we put this service
[44:37] into our hands we ask you would just
[44:38] come through this morning Father Lord
[44:39] that you would move in a mighty way and
[44:41] you would touch hearts Lord you would
[44:42] change lives you would touch Souls Lord
[44:44] put this all into your hands in the name
[44:46] of Jesus Christ we pray amen and y'all
[44:48] can be
[44:51] seated this last part part of this quote
[44:53] that we just read it would say as long
[44:55] as you take God at his word then the
[44:57] word will produce what it promised to do
[45:00] so speaking this morning on the product
[45:01] of the word or what the word produces
[45:04] the dictionary would Define the word
[45:06] produce as to give birth or rise to to
[45:09] yield to give being or form something
[45:11] that is composed created or brought
[45:13] about by a specific cause now something
[45:16] that I believe we all know and
[45:17] understand is you can always determine
[45:19] where something came from or whether
[45:21] what something is by what it produces I
[45:23] mean can we all agree on that it's not a
[45:25] complicated philosophy it's not
[45:26] something you have to learn about in
[45:27] school but the the human mind and the
[45:29] human heart has been designed and
[45:31] created to determine what something is
[45:33] based on what it produces and this will
[45:35] apply to every Walk of Life it applies
[45:37] to Nature you can tell a species of
[45:38] something you can tell a species of of a
[45:40] plant a a a tree or a bush based on what
[45:43] it produces if it's a strawberry plant
[45:44] it's going to bring forth strawberries
[45:46] if it's a fig tree it's going to bring
[45:47] it's going to bring forth figs if it's a
[45:49] cornstock it's going to bring uh bring
[45:51] forth corn and we could go on and on it
[45:53] applies to our economy you know if you
[45:55] look if you a car factor is going to
[45:57] produce cars very simply a computer
[45:59] factor is going to produce computers a
[46:00] gun factor is going to produce guns you
[46:02] can tell me all day long that it's a
[46:03] chair Factory you can tell me all day
[46:05] long it's a candy cane Factor you can
[46:06] tell me all day long this this or this
[46:08] that but regardless of what your word
[46:10] says I can determine based on what I see
[46:12] that it produces I can determine what it
[46:14] is and the prophet of God would say the
[46:16] word only has life and any other word is
[46:19] a hybrid okay any other word is a hybrid
[46:22] he said no matter how much it looks like
[46:24] it it isn't the word the word produces
[46:26] its own own life now we know that when
[46:28] God made that word it was made perfect
[46:30] when he spoke that word at the beginning
[46:32] of time it was made perfect God looked
[46:34] what the spoken word had created and he
[46:36] said it is good that word it was made
[46:38] perfect it was made perfect long before
[46:40] you ever had an idea long before you
[46:42] ever had an opinion long before you ever
[46:43] had the the ability to make an
[46:45] interpretation of it this word was made
[46:47] perfect long before you Satan never
[46:49] perverted it in the garden and the
[46:51] prophet of God would say in Christ's
[46:52] mystery God revealed that the first Eve
[46:53] would turn down that word she rejected
[46:55] that word she would not accept that word
[46:57] oh but there would be another Eve today
[46:59] that would not turn down that word she
[47:00] must not turn down that word she could
[47:02] not turn down that word because she was
[47:04] because she was that word and she was
[47:06] anointed and she was predestinated to
[47:08] produce that word and brother Brenham
[47:10] would say that the word must produce the
[47:12] bride and the bride in turn will produce
[47:14] the word and so the prophet is telling
[47:15] us here in this quote that when that
[47:17] believer that bride takes God at his
[47:19] word it will produce everything that it
[47:20] promised it would produce if the word
[47:22] said it produce Divine Healing it would
[47:24] produce Divine Healing if the word said
[47:25] it'll produce Miracles it'll produce
[47:27] Miracles if the word said that it's
[47:28] going to produce a spotless bride then
[47:30] this word will produce a spotless bride
[47:32] if this word said that it's going to
[47:33] produce a supernatural it will produce
[47:35] is Supernatural and this word doesn't
[47:36] need somebody standing behind it this
[47:38] word doesn't need us adding to it this
[47:40] word doesn't need us taking anything
[47:41] away from it this word doesn't need any
[47:43] psychology added to it this word doesn't
[47:45] need any intelligence added to it this
[47:47] word doesn't need nothing added to it or
[47:48] nothing taken away because the second
[47:50] you begin to add something to or take
[47:51] something away from this word it is no
[47:54] longer God's perfect word hey it can't
[47:56] be reproduced it can't be replicated it
[47:58] can be imitated man has tried to
[48:00] reproduce this word but no matter how
[48:01] hard theyve tried they cannot reproduce
[48:03] it denominations have tried to reproduce
[48:05] this word no matter no matter how hard
[48:07] they try they cannot reproduce all the
[48:08] organizations of the world have tried to
[48:11] reproduce this word no matter how hard
[48:12] they try they cannot reproduce it but
[48:14] I'm standing before a group of people
[48:15] this morning we ain't got to imitate it
[48:17] we ain't got to replicate it we ain't
[48:19] got to come up with something that's
[48:20] like it because we have the original
[48:22] word we have the ulcerated word we have
[48:24] the all authoritative word we have the
[48:26] original word oh my brother bam would
[48:29] talk to us and he would explain to us
[48:31] how that you know all throughout the
[48:32] ages every single age in you know during
[48:34] Luther's age that that that that age
[48:36] could be denominated that word could be
[48:37] denominated because that word was not
[48:39] yet fully expressed in Wesley's age it
[48:42] could be attitud it could be denominated
[48:43] because the word was not yet fully
[48:45] expressed on down through every age but
[48:46] we're living in an age today where that
[48:48] word has now been fully expressed that
[48:50] word has now been fully brought forth it
[48:52] has been fully revealed and the prophet
[48:53] of God said when this word has been
[48:55] fully revealed he said it cannot be
[48:56] manhandled it cannot be nomin
[48:59] denominated it cannot be replicated it
[49:01] cannot be reproduced he said this bride
[49:03] cannot be deceived because she has been
[49:06] exposed to the full
[49:08] word amen this word the prophet said
[49:10] this word will produce everything
[49:12] everything that it said it was going to
[49:14] produce he will take God as his word it
[49:15] will produce every promise it'll produce
[49:17] Every Blessing it'll produce healing
[49:19] it'll produce anointing it'll produce a
[49:20] church with a group of young people that
[49:22] are on fire for God it'll produce a
[49:24] church that is full of the Holy Ghost
[49:25] it'll produce a bride there is under the
[49:27] anointing of the pillar of fire oh why
[49:29] would we counterfeit something if we've
[49:31] got the original oh we just take God at
[49:33] his word this morning Watch what it
[49:35] produces accept your healing and watch
[49:37] what it produces we ain't got to wait
[49:38] for healing you ain't even got to pray
[49:40] for healing but the prophet of God said
[49:41] this bride now has the same power that
[49:43] Jesus had where you ain't got to sit
[49:44] around and you ain't got to pray that
[49:46] God's going to do something you ain't
[49:47] got to wonder whether God wants to heal
[49:49] you you ain't got to wonder whether God
[49:50] wants to save you you ain't got to
[49:52] wonder whether God wants to do these
[49:53] things for you oh but he said all you've
[49:55] got to do he says just take this word
[49:57] and speak that word speak your healing
[49:59] speak your Victory speak your Liberty
[50:01] just speak it oh and it'll come to pass
[50:03] and just watch what it produces the
[50:05] prophet would say God's word will
[50:07] produce the same thing every time if you
[50:09] will just simply take God's formula and
[50:10] carry it out to the letter I'll say that
[50:12] again just take God's form me and carry
[50:14] it out to the letter no matter what the
[50:16] church it says just follow it just the
[50:18] way and it will produce the same thing
[50:20] God's word will produce the same thing
[50:22] every single time no matter what the
[50:24] church says no matter what the world
[50:26] says no matter what the denomination
[50:27] says no matter what men says no matter
[50:29] what your mom and daddy have to say
[50:30] about it no matter what brother and
[50:31] sister have to say about it no matter
[50:33] what your teacher has to say about it no
[50:34] matter what they have to say about it if
[50:36] you will just stay with this word this
[50:38] word will produce the same thing every
[50:40] single time if the word open the blinded
[50:42] eyes one time it will do it again if the
[50:44] word conquer death one time it can
[50:45] conquer death again oh if the word
[50:47] conquer depression one time it can
[50:49] conquer depression again this morning oh
[50:51] if the word Conquer Cancer one time it
[50:53] can Conquer Cancer again if the word
[50:55] rais the dead up one time then they can
[50:57] do it again if the word ever did it one
[50:59] time that they can do it again oh if I
[51:01] have a need that I has if I have
[51:02] something I have need of all I need is
[51:04] for the word to have done it one time
[51:06] all throughout history and I know if it
[51:08] did it one time it can do it again oh
[51:10] whatever I have need of whatever you
[51:12] have need of this morning I'm here to
[51:13] tell you if the word did it once the
[51:15] word can do it again because I serve a
[51:17] god that is Jesus Christ the same
[51:19] yesterday today and forever if he did it
[51:21] for the apostles he's going to do it for
[51:23] you if he did it for shamgar he can do
[51:25] it for you if he did it for David he can
[51:27] do it for you if he did it for Daniel if
[51:29] he did it for Joshua if he did it for
[51:30] Elijah he can do it for you if he did it
[51:32] for brother baham he can do it for you
[51:35] amen he would say if you want to know
[51:37] what kind of a crop you're going to have
[51:38] or what it is that's growing up in the
[51:40] field he said go back and find out what
[51:42] the seed is the seed will produce just
[51:45] exactly what it is it'll produce its
[51:47] kind a corn will bring a corn a clear a
[51:49] cur a wheat a wheat whatever it is it
[51:51] will produce just what the seed was he
[51:54] says so you can tell the crop that
[51:55] you're going to have by the seed by what
[51:58] what the seed by the seed that was
[51:59] planted you can tell what seed was
[52:01] planted by what that crop produces so
[52:03] you know if I plant corn I'm expecting
[52:05] corn if I plant strawberries I'm
[52:06] expecting the strawberries are going to
[52:08] go up if I plant wheat I'm expecting to
[52:10] see wheat but you know I don't go out to
[52:12] the corn field and expect that I'm going
[52:13] to see strawberries I don't go out to
[52:15] the wheat field and expect that I'm
[52:16] going to be seeing corn go up why
[52:18] because I know what it is that I've
[52:19] planted and me as the planter I know if
[52:22] I planted corn in the corn field then
[52:24] nothing but corn is going to grow up
[52:25] there because whatever ever that seed
[52:27] was must be what it produces and I say
[52:29] God doesn't worry about you this morning
[52:31] he doesn't worry about what you're going
[52:32] to produce he doesn't worry about where
[52:34] you're going he doesn't worry about
[52:35] where you came from he doesn't worry
[52:36] about who you are because he knows the
[52:38] word seed that he pled down on the
[52:40] inside of you from before the foundation
[52:42] of the world he knows if I plant word
[52:44] seed it must produce word he knows if I
[52:46] plant bride seed it must produce bride
[52:48] he knows whatever seed I plant down on
[52:50] the inside of that so must be what it
[52:52] produces oh maybe I'm here to tell
[52:54] somebody this morning you might worry
[52:55] about you Mama might worry about you
[52:58] Daddy might worry about you Pastor might
[53:00] even worry about you oh but this God
[53:02] does not worry about you because he
[53:04] knows what he planted on the inside of
[53:06] you he knows the word he planted he
[53:08] knows the message of the hour that he
[53:09] planted down on the inside of your heart
[53:11] and he doesn't worry about you oh
[53:14] hallelujah it's just like that sheep a
[53:16] sheep will produce wool because it is
[53:18] inside of that sheep to produce that
[53:20] wool that sheep can't produce anything
[53:21] else except wool because that is what
[53:23] it's meant to produce it's just like
[53:25] that Dove but B will talk about that
[53:27] Dove that will produce that oil that oil
[53:29] on the inside of them that oil that
[53:30] cleanses them that oil that washes them
[53:32] that oil that purges them brother Bram
[53:33] said that it is in the inside of that
[53:35] Dove to produce that oil he ain't got a
[53:37] choice but to produce it he ain't got to
[53:38] try to produce it he ain't got to work
[53:40] to produce it he ain't got to go to a
[53:41] certain school to a certain Seminary to
[53:44] learn how to produce it but he just
[53:46] produces it because it is inside of that
[53:48] Dove to produce that o and I say this
[53:50] morning it is inside of this bride to
[53:52] produce this word it is inside this
[53:54] bride to produce healing it is inside
[53:56] this bride to produce anointing it is
[53:58] inside this bride to produce Victory it
[54:01] is inside of you to produce Liberty it
[54:03] is inside of you oh to kill every devil
[54:05] in hell that comes between you and God
[54:07] it is inside of you oh to stomp on every
[54:10] devil that says that we can't praise it
[54:12] is inside of you to stomp on every devil
[54:14] that says we ain't got a right to
[54:15] worship I say this bride has a reason to
[54:17] Rejoice this morning because we have
[54:19] seen our name being written on the
[54:20] Lamb's Book of Life and we have seen
[54:22] this word and the Divine hand of God
[54:25] write our name and of it we know if the
[54:27] word wrote my name I'm going to produce
[54:29] the word if the word word if the word
[54:32] said that I was born of word seed then I
[54:34] must produce that word oh
[54:38] hallelujah oh my that he would say if a
[54:40] man is born of the word he will produce
[54:43] the word the fruit or the works of his
[54:45] life will be a product of the kind of
[54:47] seed or life that is in him I mean
[54:49] that's pretty simple ain't it oh I love
[54:51] that God sent a Kentucky hillbo to be my
[54:53] Prophet because he didn't say nothing
[54:54] complicated but he dumbed it down where
[54:56] I could understand it if you're not born
[54:58] of the word you're not going to produce
[55:00] this word oh but if I am born of that
[55:02] word I will produce that word I say if I
[55:05] am born of this word I'm going to
[55:07] produce this word oh Church you weren't
[55:09] you weren't trained to overcome you were
[55:11] born to overcome you w you didn't learn
[55:13] how to how to accept healing you were
[55:15] born to accept healing oh you weren't
[55:17] trained to overcome you were born to
[55:19] overcome when Satan comes and he says
[55:21] you're nobody you young people I know
[55:23] the the complexes he brings when he
[55:25] comes and he says you're this he says
[55:26] you're that he says you've gone too far
[55:28] he says you're never going to make it oh
[55:30] he says look at your past he says look
[55:32] at where you've been look at what you've
[55:33] done look at all your decisions you made
[55:35] since you were born oh but Satan before
[55:37] I was born oh before I made a mistake
[55:40] before I made a decision before I went
[55:42] down the wrong path or before I had a
[55:44] past I had a word and that word claimed
[55:47] me before that the towns of the devil
[55:49] ever got its hands on me this word
[55:51] already cleaned me this word already
[55:53] said you're mine this word already says

[56:04] this way for a while you might run that
[56:06] way for a while oh but if I have called

[56:13] produce the word oh it's a promise not
[56:15] just a promise it's an obligation oh you
[56:18] ain't got a choice whether you produce
[56:20] it if you're born of it you're going to
[56:21] produce it one way or the other oh my I
[56:25] ran for a long time time oh as a
[56:27] teenager I ran as far as I could oh but
[56:29] one of these days God got a hold of me
[56:31] and he said kale he said you can run as
[56:33] long as you want to oh but today is the
[56:35] day you've run long enough oh cuz

[56:46] down on the inside of you oh I can grab
[56:49] a hold of you wherever you were no
[56:50] matter how no matter how far down you
[56:53] went my arm was long enough to reach
[56:54] down and to pick you back back up and
[56:57] expose you to that Sun so that that word
[56:59] seed can begin to grow that word seed
[57:02] can begin to break through the shell
[57:04] that word seek could begin to come
[57:05] manifest oh inside of that bride body oh
[57:10] Hallelujah prise God Amen oh the prophet
[57:13] God would say in the voice of the sign
[57:15] he will say that you will stand by the
[57:17] word because you were born to stand by
[57:19] that word that's simply that that's
[57:21] simple church he would say the word does
[57:23] not produce defeat the word produces
[57:25] victory oh the word doesn't produce
[57:27] sickness this word produces healing this
[57:29] word don't produce this that word only
[57:32] produces the word oh I remember one time
[57:34] oh I had gotten so sick with something I
[57:36] had learned to live with it and I had
[57:38] told myself in my mind that God was giv
[57:40] me that sickness as a punishment God was
[57:42] giving me this just as a reminder as a
[57:45] as a way to just just remind me of where
[57:47] I've been oh but one day somebody told
[57:49] me this a Cale oh they said God does not
[57:52] produce sickness this word don't produce
[57:54] sickness this word don't produce disease
[57:56] God didn't give you that sickness God
[57:58] didn't give you that disease but if you

[58:01] accept your hearing and just accept your
[58:03] Liberty oh brother bham said there's no
[58:06] devil in hell that can hold down this

[58:14] devil in hell that can stop her oh when

[59:17] way not not not 90% of the way not 99%
[59:21] of the way but this word will take you
[59:23] all the way oh I don't a god yesterday I
[59:27] don't serve a dead God oh but I serve a
[59:29] God that if he did it for them he can do
[59:31] it now for me oh the prophet of God
[59:33] would say he would say I believe we got
[59:35] some Shamu guards in the church today
[59:37] and you know I was thinking about that I
[59:38] was reading that quote the other day and
[59:39] I thought you know I don't believe that
[59:41] the prophet of God would say that if the
[59:43] same God that stood for shamgar was not
[59:45] standing here in this building this
[59:47] morning standing for me oh we another
[59:49] place he would say I believe got some
[59:51] Davids in the church today and I don't
[59:53] believe that the prophet of God would
[59:54] say that and the same God that stood for
[59:56] David and that carried that Stone from
[59:58] that sling to the head of Goliath was
[1:00:00] not standing in this church this morning
[1:00:03] or ready to stand for a bride ready to
[1:00:05] fight for a bride oh ready to take a
[1:00:07] bride oh hallelujah oh I believe I'm
[1:00:11] standing before some sham Gods I believe
[1:00:13] I'm standing before some Davids because
[1:00:14] the same God that stood for them is now
[1:00:17] standing with you oh I don't believe
[1:00:20] that Elisha oh stood there beside the
[1:00:22] banks of Jordan oh as he after watched
[1:00:24] Elijah go up and he say well he said the
[1:00:26] prophet's off the scene the prophet's
[1:00:28] gone well God s a prophet but I guess
[1:00:30] we'll swim across the river and go back
[1:00:32] home no I don't believe he did that
[1:00:34] Elisha was not content with God sent a
[1:00:36] prophet that's Elisha was not content
[1:00:38] with a god of 1963 Elijah was not
[1:00:41] content with a God in 1965 but what did
[1:00:43] he do he took a hold of that rment that
[1:00:45] Elijah had carried he began to wave that
[1:00:48] rment he began to swing it around just
[1:00:50] like Elijah did he begin to STP that
[1:00:52] water just like Elijah did and when he
[1:00:54] did what to do that water did the same
[1:00:57] thing for elishah that it had done for
[1:00:59] Elijah oh he said maybe Elijah's gone
[1:01:01] off the scene but where is the god of
[1:01:03] Elijah the same God that stood for
[1:01:05] Elijah is standing for me the same God
[1:01:08] that stood for him is now standing for
[1:01:10] me and he took it a step farther oh he
[1:01:13] said if Elijah did it once I'm going to
[1:01:15] do it twice if Elijah heal cancer 10
[1:01:17] times I'm going to heal cancer 20 times
[1:01:20] if Elijah killed a th000 Devils I'm
[1:01:21] going to kill 2,000 Devils because the
[1:01:24] same word the same power the same
[1:01:26] Authority that rested inside of Elijah
[1:01:29] is now resting inside of me and I say
[1:01:31] the same power the same Authority that
[1:01:33] rested inside of William brandham has
[1:01:35] now been placed inside of this bride oh
[1:01:39] hallelujah amen take God at his word if
[1:01:42] somebody give me a handkerchief I'll
[1:01:43] lift M on the back I'm sorry do y'all
[1:01:45] have would youall happen to have one
[1:01:47] take God at his word and watch it
[1:01:49] destroy every devil take God at his word
[1:01:51] oh watch it break down every stronghold
[1:01:53] watch it kill every Goliath watch it
[1:01:55] destroy every Army that stands in your
[1:01:57] way the private would say now remember
[1:01:59] this Christ in the true church is a
[1:02:01] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:02:04] Book of Revelation would show us thank
[1:02:05] you sir would show
[1:02:08] us he said how that thy Antichrist
[1:02:10] spirit will come into the church and
[1:02:12] will defile it making it lukewarm formal
[1:02:14] and Powerless so I want you to watch now
[1:02:17] he's going to go in to how it is that he
[1:02:19] defiles this church he said this word it
[1:02:21] exposes Satan revealing his works the
[1:02:24] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:02:25] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:02:27] word so how does he defile God's Church
[1:02:30] how does he make it lukewarm how does it
[1:02:32] make it formal how does it make it
[1:02:34] powerless he said he does it by
[1:02:36] discrediting God's word he does it by
[1:02:38] changing God's word he does it by by
[1:02:40] adding a little bit here by taking away
[1:02:42] just a little bit here not a lot not
[1:02:44] very much but just just by just one word
[1:02:47] just one one sentence Oh if he can get a
[1:02:49] a member of this church to just
[1:02:51] disbelieve one word just discredit one
[1:02:53] word just discredit one part of oh then
[1:02:56] he is defile that member oh but I love
[1:02:58] the way he said it he said it's the
[1:03:00] attempted destruction of God's people oh
[1:03:02] because he said that this bride oh this
[1:03:05] bride is impossible for her to be
[1:03:07] deceived it is impossible for her to
[1:03:09] follow after somebody else it is
[1:03:11] impossible for her to leave this word oh
[1:03:13] because he can discredit God's word all
[1:03:15] he wants to oh but I begin to think if
[1:03:17] the only way that Satan could even
[1:03:19] attempt to just to stop God's bride if
[1:03:23] the only way he could even attempt oh to
[1:03:25] stop me was by discrediting God's word I
[1:03:28] think I'm just going to stand with the
[1:03:29] word I think I'm just going to stay with
[1:03:30] this original word I'm just going to
[1:03:32] stay with what works I'm just going to
[1:03:34] stay with what's alive I'm just going to
[1:03:36] stay with what's real I'm just going to
[1:03:37] stay with the original word Oh my he
[1:03:41] said he discredited God's word and it
[1:03:43] was the attempted destruction of God's
[1:03:46] people oh hallelujah oh right down to
[1:03:49] the time he is cast in the Lake of Fire
[1:03:51] oh he FS that the word he cannot stand
[1:03:54] it the word he knows that the people get
[1:03:57] the true revelation of the true church
[1:03:59] and what she is and the prophet say she
[1:04:01] is the word and what she stands for and
[1:04:04] that she can do the Greater Works she
[1:04:06] will be an invincible Army oh she will
[1:04:08] be an invincible Army she will be
[1:04:10] unstoppable she will be undefeatable she
[1:04:13] will be unconquerable oh what does she
[1:04:15] have to do she has to get a revelation
[1:04:17] of the word that is on the inside of her
[1:04:19] and he said once she gets that
[1:04:20] Revelation she will be an invincible
[1:04:23] Army hallelujah oh Church this morning
[1:04:26] Satan knows what happens when you take
[1:04:27] God at his word he knows what happens
[1:04:30] when this bride gets revelation of what
[1:04:32] this word says she is and who this word
[1:04:34] says she is and the power that this word
[1:04:35] says she has he knows that if he get
[1:04:38] this bride gets that Revelation oh that
[1:04:39] she will be unstoppable there will be no
[1:04:41] defeating her he knows if Jesus used the
[1:04:44] word to defeat him then he knows that
[1:04:46] there will be a bride that will use that
[1:04:48] same word to defeat him now oh the
[1:04:51] prophet of God will go on in this same
[1:04:52] sermon or they in the church edes right
[1:04:54] after this and he would tell tell us he
[1:04:56] would say that just the way that Jesus
[1:04:57] defeated him in the desert when Satan
[1:04:59] tempted him he would say it would be the
[1:05:01] exact same way oh that the Bride of
[1:05:03] Jesus Christ today would defeat Satan he
[1:05:06] said because he used a word to defeat
[1:05:07] the devil and he said this bride will
[1:05:09] use that word to defeat the Devil I say
[1:05:12] this morning you can fight the devil
[1:05:13] with anything you want to but there's
[1:05:15] only one thing that'll kill every devil
[1:05:17] in hell there's only one thing that'll
[1:05:19] break every Shackle in the world and
[1:05:21] that is this word oh if you need
[1:05:23] something to fight with if you need a
[1:05:24] sword to fight with I'll show you a
[1:05:26] store that you can fight with it'll kill
[1:05:28] every devil it'll break every chain
[1:05:30] it'll destroy every stronghold oh the
[1:05:33] wasn't prob God say he said you pick up
[1:05:35] the sword of the word and he said you
[1:05:36] whack that devil he said you whack it
[1:05:38] again and you whack it again and he said
[1:05:41] if it don't die he said you whack it
[1:05:43] again and you keep whacking and you keep
[1:05:45] whacking until that devil is dead I say
[1:05:48] we got a sword this morning we've got a
[1:05:50] word this morning we've got a message of
[1:05:52] the hour that we can use to kill the
[1:05:54] devil oh oh this word will prevail this
[1:05:57] word will defeat Satan any time anywhere
[1:06:00] any place any form under any
[1:06:03] condition oh hallelujah oh I am so I'm
[1:06:08] so thankful oh to be identified oh with
[1:06:11] such an absolute I'm oh I'm so grateful
[1:06:14] that I that I have been chosen
[1:06:17] identified oh to be a part of this word
[1:06:20] to be a part of this message oh
[1:06:23] hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:06:26] another definition for the word product
[1:06:28] is interpretation so the product of the
[1:06:31] word is the interpretation of the word
[1:06:32] now brother Brandon would talk about
[1:06:34] this many times about the interpretation
[1:06:35] of the word he would say he would say we
[1:06:39] do have today by God's help the perfect
[1:06:41] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:06:44] Vindication what does that mean that
[1:06:46] means there's no question about it it's
[1:06:48] been divinely Vindicated there's no
[1:06:50] question about this word there's no
[1:06:51] question about this message there's no
[1:06:53] question about where it's came from
[1:06:54] there's no question about where it's
[1:06:56] taking you it's been divinely Vindicated
[1:06:58] he would say the perfect interpretation
[1:06:59] of the word with Divine Vindication now
[1:07:02] we know that brother Brandon would
[1:07:04] identify to us how it is that God
[1:07:05] interprets his word he would say that
[1:07:07] God interprets his word by bringing it
[1:07:09] to pass or by bringing it to
[1:07:11] manifestation it's simple he was say he
[1:07:13] he he brings it he interprets his word
[1:07:15] by bringing it to pass now we know that
[1:07:17] everything we see around us is the
[1:07:19] interpretation of God's word the the the
[1:07:21] very grass that you see grow outside the
[1:07:23] dirt that we walk on the trees that grow
[1:07:25] everything we see is the interpretation
[1:07:27] of God's word he would the prophet would
[1:07:29] say the world that we are sitting upon
[1:07:30] today the chairs we're sitting in the
[1:07:32] floor that's beneath us the dirt the
[1:07:33] trees everything is nothing but the
[1:07:36] interpretation of the word of God so
[1:07:38] when God spoke that word in creating the
[1:07:41] world he brought that word to pass and
[1:07:43] the result that we see today is the
[1:07:45] interpretation of that word that he
[1:07:47] spoke in the beginning and we know that
[1:07:49] before the foundation of the world there
[1:07:50] was a perfect word in the mind of God
[1:07:53] and inside that perfect word in the mind
[1:07:54] of God that is where you were that is
[1:07:56] where you abide that was where you
[1:07:58] rested was inside that perfect word and
[1:08:01] now the prophet would come along and he
[1:08:02] would say that God interprets his word
[1:08:04] by bringing it to pass but that the
[1:08:06] interpretation must come through a
[1:08:08] prophit so now that perfect word that
[1:08:10] was in the mind of God through the
[1:08:12] message of a prophet has now been made
[1:08:14] manifest in a bride body and that bride
[1:08:17] body is the interpretation or the
[1:08:19] product of that perfect word he would
[1:08:21] say the true bride of Christ was in the
[1:08:23] mind of God eternally though not
[1:08:25] expressed
[1:08:26] until each came forth in his designated
[1:08:28] decreed season now I want you to watch
[1:08:29] what he says not every member comes
[1:08:31] forth at the same time not every seed
[1:08:33] will grow up at the same time but he
[1:08:35] said each member came forth in the
[1:08:37] designated decreed season and as each
[1:08:39] member came forth it became expressed
[1:08:41] and it took its place in the body thus
[1:08:44] this bride is the literal spoken word
[1:08:47] seed bride so this bride is the perfect
[1:08:49] manifestation or the perfect
[1:08:51] interpretation of God's word not man's
[1:08:53] interpretation of it the Baptist are
[1:08:55] man's inter interpretation of the word
[1:08:56] the Pentecostals remains interpretation
[1:08:58] of the word the Methodist remains
[1:09:00] interpretation of the word the prophet
[1:09:01] of God would actually identify to us
[1:09:03] what a denomination was he would say a
[1:09:05] denomination is man's interpretation of
[1:09:08] God's word oh but you are not a man's
[1:09:09] interpretation you are not a
[1:09:11] denomination interpretation you are not
[1:09:13] some Spirits interpretation but you are
[1:09:15] God's perfect interpretation of his own
[1:09:17] word oh think about that this morning
[1:09:19] you are God's interpretation of his own
[1:09:22] word he interpreted his own word and it
[1:09:24] produced you it brought forth you It
[1:09:27] produced this bride and you are the
[1:09:29] perfect word seed bride oh now he would
[1:09:32] say Satan was The Interpreter of that
[1:09:34] word to Eve she wouldn't listen to her
[1:09:36] husband or to God but she took the
[1:09:38] prosecutor's interpretation of the word
[1:09:40] so Satan was The Interpreter of that
[1:09:42] word to Eve and therefore by
[1:09:43] discrediting God's word he defiled Eve
[1:09:46] by misinterpreting God's word he would
[1:09:47] deceive Eve oh but there was been
[1:09:49] another E day that's been given another
[1:09:51] promise oh that we could not be deceived
[1:09:53] it was impossible for us to follow after
[1:09:55] her misinterpretation of God's word oh
[1:09:58] because she was a perfect interpretation
[1:10:00] of that word from the very beginning oh
[1:10:02] when I was born I was the interpretation
[1:10:05] of my mother I was the interpretation of
[1:10:07] my father I was the interpretation of my
[1:10:09] parents when I was born not just on the
[1:10:11] outside not not just my skin color not
[1:10:13] just my facial features not just my eye
[1:10:15] color and my hair color oh but my DNA
[1:10:18] was the interpretation of my appearance
[1:10:20] oh all these things you know everything
[1:10:22] about me inside my flesh everything my
[1:10:24] blood everything was the interpretation
[1:10:26] of my parents even down to the bone
[1:10:28] structure oh my bone marrow was the
[1:10:29] interpretation of my parents down to the
[1:10:31] very core the foundation of my body is
[1:10:33] the foundation of the interpretation of
[1:10:35] my parents now Hebrews 4:12 it would say
[1:10:38] for the word of God is quick and
[1:10:40] powerful and is sharper than any
[1:10:41] two-edged
[1:10:44] sword piercing even to the dividing
[1:10:46] theunder of the Soul and Spirit and of
[1:10:48] the joints in the marrow and is a
[1:10:50] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:10:52] the heart so when that word pierces the
[1:10:54] believer it goes as deep as it could
[1:10:55] possibly go when that word quickens
[1:10:57] inside of you it goes all the way down
[1:10:59] to the foundation of the body it goes
[1:11:00] beyond the flesh it goes beyond the mind
[1:11:02] and he said that word pierces down to
[1:11:04] the foundation the word of God brother
[1:11:06] Brandon would say the word of God it say
[1:11:08] sharp two-edged sword what was it doing
[1:11:10] Discerning the thoughts of the heart the
[1:11:12] intents going even deeper than the meat
[1:11:14] deeper than the flesh deeper than the
[1:11:15] blood cells on into the bone down into
[1:11:18] the marrow of the bone P Beyond even to
[1:11:20] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[1:11:22] of the heart so that when that word
[1:11:24] quickens on the inside of the believer
[1:11:26] on the inside of this bra it goes deeper
[1:11:28] than the flesh it goes deeper than the
[1:11:29] meat and it pierces down to the marrow
[1:11:31] of the bone now the bone or the bone
[1:11:33] marrow is the foundation of the human
[1:11:35] body the bone marrow is where blood
[1:11:37] cells are generated a lot of people will
[1:11:39] say well the heart is the foundation of
[1:11:41] the human body no all the heart does is
[1:11:43] just pump that blood all that all it
[1:11:45] does just send it to the body but you're
[1:11:46] inside your bone marrow is where that
[1:11:48] blood is generated where that blood is
[1:11:50] produced the bone marrow is where their
[1:11:51] body's nutrients are stored the bone is
[1:11:54] the foundation of the the human body and
[1:11:56] when that word is the prophet of God
[1:11:58] would say that the word is the
[1:11:59] foundation of the church so when that
[1:12:01] word is born inside of a body it don't
[1:12:03] just pierce the skin it don't just
[1:12:04] Pierce uh to the flesh it don't just
[1:12:06] Pierce to the heart but he would say it
[1:12:08] goes as deep as that Foundation goes
[1:12:10] that word sinks down until the very core
[1:12:12] of the body is overcome by word it sinks
[1:12:15] in until every root of that body is word
[1:12:18] oh looking back at Elisha 2 Kings 13:20
[1:12:21] it will say and Elisha died and they
[1:12:23] buried him and the bands of the mobites
[1:12:25] and Ved the land at the coming end of
[1:12:27] the year so two things have taken place
[1:12:30] here the prophet has died the prophet of
[1:12:32] God has gone off the scene number one
[1:12:34] Elijah has gone off the scene and number
[1:12:35] two we see the moabites have come in and
[1:12:38] have invaded Israel now we know the
[1:12:40] prophet of God will show us that the
[1:12:41] moabites represented the lukew believer
[1:12:43] but the prophet God would say Moab they
[1:12:45] represented the lukew Believers he would
[1:12:47] say they had the same fundamentals of
[1:12:49] Christianity that that Israel had but he
[1:12:51] said what they lack was the same Pillar
[1:12:53] of Fire that followed Israel so now we
[1:12:55] see what has happened is the Elijah
[1:12:57] messenger has left the scene and the
[1:12:59] nation has moved into a lorm age I
[1:13:01] believe that's a perfect parallel of
[1:13:02] what we're living in today but now
[1:13:04] something begins to happen in verse 21
[1:13:06] it would say and they came to pass as
[1:13:08] they were burying a man that behold they
[1:13:10] spied a band of men and they cast the
[1:13:12] man into the seple of Elisha and when
[1:13:14] the man was let down and he touched the
[1:13:16] bones of Elisha he revived and he stood
[1:13:19] up on his feet oh so they begin to dig
[1:13:21] up the grave of the man of God and there
[1:13:23] laid his bones and they laid this body
[1:13:25] onto the bones of the prophet and he
[1:13:26] raised up oh maybe Elijah was dead maybe
[1:13:29] the prophet had gone off the scene but
[1:13:31] you know there was a group of people
[1:13:32] that knew that the foundation of Elijah
[1:13:34] was still there that word was still
[1:13:36] there the same word that was inside of
[1:13:38] Elijah those bones were still laying
[1:13:40] there oh when I say to you this morning
[1:13:43] oh maybe the prophet's going off the
[1:13:44] scene maybe brother Brenham has died
[1:13:46] maybe he's going off the scene for the
[1:13:48] foundation of Elijah is still here the
[1:13:51] foundation of Malachi 4 is still here
[1:13:53] maybe the prophet's not alive but this
[1:13:55] word is still alive the message that he
[1:13:57] brought is still alive the word that he
[1:13:59] brought forth is still alive the word
[1:14:01] that he expressed that he produced is
[1:14:03] still alive oh they laid him down on the
[1:14:06] body on the bones of that Prophet on the
[1:14:08] foundation of that prophet and that body
[1:14:11] begin to rise oh now I don't believe we
[1:14:13] need to be packing shovels to a grave in
[1:14:15] Jeffersonville and we need dig up the
[1:14:16] prophet and go jump on his bones that's
[1:14:18] not what I believe but if y begin to
[1:14:20] look at this word bones of Elisha here
[1:14:23] in the Hebrew when it's talking about
[1:14:24] these bones would mean the essence of
[1:14:26] the body the substance the life and the
[1:14:28] strength that is contained in that body
[1:14:31] so that word substance there it means
[1:14:33] manifestation so we can say they laid
[1:14:35] that body on the life the substance or
[1:14:37] the manifestation of the Prophet
[1:14:40] messenger so once that word comes and
[1:14:42] this bride is exposed to that word that
[1:14:45] word will become manifest inside of her
[1:14:47] oh and I'm standing before a group of
[1:14:49] people this morning oh we are not
[1:14:51] manifesting the world we are not
[1:14:53] manifesting some men some men's ideas we
[1:14:55] are not manifesting a denomination oh
[1:14:57] but we have been manifesting this
[1:14:59] perfect word because this B body was
[1:15:02] laid down oh upon the the the foundation
[1:15:05] of Malachi 4 we were laid down upon this
[1:15:08] word and that word was transferred from
[1:15:10] the prophet into a new bride body oh
[1:15:13] there was a transfer of power that word
[1:15:15] went from William Brandon and has now
[1:15:17] been placed inside of her bride until
[1:15:19] the prophet of God would say this bride
[1:15:21] has this sayith the Lord he say you have
[1:15:24] this sayith the Lord L you have perfect
[1:15:26] access to this word you have perfect
[1:15:28] authority to speak this word you have
[1:15:30] perfect power to speak this word because
[1:15:33] there's been a transfer oh it didn't
[1:15:35] just stay with a Prophet this word
[1:15:37] didn't go on the ground with a prophet
[1:15:38] oh but that word was transferred from
[1:15:41] the prophet into a bride body oh
[1:15:44] Hallelujah and that word is now being
[1:15:46] manifested inside of this bride oh there
[1:15:49] lay a lifeless bride body brother
[1:15:51] Brandon would say she was dead she was
[1:15:53] overcome by Le Osa she was overcome by
[1:15:55] the world oh and once he was laid down
[1:15:57] upon that Foundation oh watch what
[1:16:00] happened he said once they laid that
[1:16:01] dead body on that word the Bible would
[1:16:03] say when they laid that dead body on
[1:16:05] those bones not only did he come to life
[1:16:08] but that body then began to stand on the
[1:16:10] word that body begin to stand to his
[1:16:12] feet on the foundation of Elijah oh I'm
[1:16:15] here to tell you this morning this word
[1:16:16] won't only give you life but you can
[1:16:18] stand on this word you been stand on
[1:16:20] this message you stand on the prophet of
[1:16:22] Malachi 4 You Been stand on his message
[1:16:25] oh he he gave us a promise Earth may
[1:16:28] pass away Heavens may pass away oh but
[1:16:30] this word will never pass away oh so if
[1:16:34] this bde will stand on a word that will
[1:16:36] never pass away then this bde will never
[1:16:39] pass this bde will never be defeated
[1:16:41] this B will never be conquered because
[1:16:43] we are standing on a word that can't be
[1:16:45] defeated we are standing on a word that
[1:16:48] can't be conquered oh
[1:16:51] hallelujah oh he would say when that
[1:16:54] word go for the word will produce what
[1:16:56] it said now I want you to watch this
[1:16:58] word said that it's going to give unto
[1:16:59] Elijah a double portion of what it gave
[1:17:02] unto
[1:17:03] Elijah and if you read in this word
[1:17:06] Elijah performed eight Miracles and if
[1:17:08] you look the prophet of God would say he
[1:17:10] would say Elijah performed eight
[1:17:11] Miracles and Elisha performed 16 so I
[1:17:13] just one time it been several years ago
[1:17:15] I just did the study and know I began to
[1:17:17] look and I begin to count and Elijah
[1:17:19] performed eight Miracles and throughout
[1:17:21] all of Elisha's life Elisha performed 15
[1:17:24] miracles and I was something there for a
[1:17:26] minute and I thought well it ain't that
[1:17:27] big of a deal oh come on Caleb what's
[1:17:30] one extra Miracle what's that one extra
[1:17:32] Miracle going to do oh it's it's it's
[1:17:34] pretty much a double portion it's pretty
[1:17:36] much double oh why would we care about
[1:17:38] that last miracle oh but I say God rich
[1:17:41] in Mercy oh he just wanted to show
[1:17:43] somebody oh that even if the prophet was
[1:17:45] off the scene that word that prophecy
[1:17:48] that message that had come forth still
[1:17:50] had to be fulfilled even if the prophet
[1:17:52] was dead oh there was still a word that
[1:17:55] had not yet been fulfilled oh even if
[1:17:57] the prophet was gone there was still a
[1:17:59] body that needed raisin oh and I say
[1:18:02] this morning all the prophets been out
[1:18:04] the sea for 60 years but there was still
[1:18:06] a bride body that needed to be raised
[1:18:08] there was still a bride body that needed
[1:18:10] to stand to his feet that was still abro
[1:18:13] and this bad body is the Fulfillment of
[1:18:16] the word you are the Fulfillment of the
[1:18:18] word you are the Fulfillment of Malachi
[1:18:21] 4 oh brother Brandon was only the
[1:18:23] beginning of Malachi 4 you are the
[1:18:25] Fulfillment of Malachi 4 because not
[1:18:28] only has God turned his eyes towards you
[1:18:30] oh but now this bride has turned her
[1:18:32] eyes and look back into the eyes of God
[1:18:35] she has looked back into the eyes of
[1:18:37] this word oh we are not looking through
[1:18:39] a glass Darkly we are not looking
[1:18:41] through a hazy mirror oh we are now
[1:18:43] looking into the perfect reflection we
[1:18:45] are now looking at the perfect word oh
[1:18:49] Hallelujah Church oh this bride body is
[1:18:52] a fulfillment of that word this Bride is
[1:18:56] a 16th Miracle this bride is the
[1:18:58] Fulfillment of that word oh Hallelujah
[1:19:02] brother bam will say that's why you see
[1:19:04] people some of them are on the housetop
[1:19:06] all the time others will say well I was
[1:19:09] healed yesterday but bless God I lost my
[1:19:11] healing oh I think there so many of us
[1:19:14] today get that mindset oh I was healed
[1:19:17] yesterday oh but I still feel the
[1:19:19] effects of it today so that means God
[1:19:21] never did nothing for me that means God
[1:19:23] never moved that means that's word ain't
[1:19:25] real that means this word is dead oh but
[1:19:27] he would say you never had it to begin
[1:19:29] with because once that word is once
[1:19:32] anchored he said all the devils in Hell
[1:19:34] couldn't shake it away from you once
[1:19:36] that word is anchored every devil in
[1:19:39] hell can shake it away from you
[1:19:41] depression can't shake it complexes
[1:19:43] can't shake it suicide can't shake it
[1:19:45] cancer can't shake it oh diseases can't
[1:19:47] shake it sickness can't shake it there
[1:19:50] is nothing there ain't a devil there
[1:19:52] ain't a man oh there ain't a spirit
[1:19:54] there a demon that can shake this bride
[1:19:57] once she was anchored in the word of God
[1:19:59] I say this morning let's get anchored in
[1:20:01] this word let's stand on this word let's
[1:20:04] stand on the word of God oh till no
[1:20:06] devil in hell can shake us oh
[1:20:10] hallelujah oh my no devil can shake you
[1:20:13] you know you say Caleb I'm waiting on
[1:20:15] the leading of the Lord Caleb I'm just
[1:20:17] praying I'm just waiting that's the
[1:20:19] biggest cop out in the message you ain't
[1:20:21] got to wait on the leading of the Lord
[1:20:22] to accept your healing you ain't got to
[1:20:24] wait on the leading of the Lord oh to
[1:20:26] accept this what this word has already
[1:20:28] given to you the word LED you to do that
[1:20:30] from before the foundation of the world
[1:20:32] you don't need to wait on it you ain't
[1:20:33] got to wait you ain't Church there are
[1:20:35] some things we ain't got to pray about
[1:20:37] there are some things we ain't got to
[1:20:38] lay on our faith before God about and
[1:20:41] accepting your healing is one of them
[1:20:42] standing on this word is one of them you
[1:20:45] may got to pray about Victory God's
[1:20:47] already given you Victory you ain't got
[1:20:49] to wait to see if God wants to liberate
[1:20:51] you he already liberated this bride he
[1:20:54] was already already giv us his word he's
[1:20:56] already giv us healing he's already
[1:20:58] given us power he's already giv us
[1:21:01] Authority oh
[1:21:03] Hallelujah this word produces Liberty
[1:21:07] the prophet would say the spirit of the
[1:21:09] Lord goes is in this building tonight to
[1:21:12] set free and to give Liberty for the
[1:21:14] mighty conqueror has paid the price and
[1:21:16] men are at Liberty to be healed and to
[1:21:19] be set free oh how precious his word is
[1:21:21] to us Devils is conquered sickness is
[1:21:24] conquered oh so to think this morning
[1:21:27] this word is not only here but this word
[1:21:29] has been here for a purpose and the
[1:21:31] prophet of God would say that purpose is
[1:21:33] to set free and to give
[1:21:35] Liberty now I know that you are familiar
[1:21:37] with the Year of Jubilee we're not going
[1:21:39] to go all the way through this morning
[1:21:40] but but brother bandam when he would
[1:21:42] speak when he would preach on Liberty he
[1:21:44] would almost always go back to the year
[1:21:45] Jubilee because it it is it is is the
[1:21:48] most perfect type oh of the Liberty that
[1:21:51] the believer this bride has but he will
[1:21:53] go through it he will preach many times
[1:21:55] and just going through real quickly
[1:21:57] those slaves will be working in the
[1:21:58] field and every Jubilee year every 50th
[1:22:00] year was a Year of Jubilee oh and on
[1:22:03] that 50th year oh those priests will
[1:22:05] ride throughout the land blowing those
[1:22:07] trumpets of Jubilee and when those
[1:22:09] trumpets were sounded whenever that
[1:22:11] slave that servant heard that sound they
[1:22:13] could drop the hoe they could drop the
[1:22:15] rake they could drop their TOS oh they
[1:22:18] could drop their chains they could drop
[1:22:19] their shackles and they could go free
[1:22:22] why because they had heard the sound of
[1:22:24] the Jubilee trumpet oh and brother
[1:22:26] Brandon would say he would say at one
[1:22:29] time that was actually talking about a
[1:22:30] physical trumpet he would say but today
[1:22:32] referring to this brow he said thou
[1:22:34] trumpet represents the word of God
[1:22:36] coming forth through the preaching of
[1:22:37] the message of the hour he will say when
[1:22:39] that word Goes Forth oh you ain't got to
[1:22:41] work one more day for the enemy church
[1:22:43] when that word Goes Forth you ain't got
[1:22:45] to work one more day for the
[1:22:47] Taskmaster excuse me you ain't got to
[1:22:49] work one more day for that enemy
[1:22:51] whenever that word Goes Forth oh but
[1:22:54] when you hear that word that word sets
[1:22:56] you at Liberty to step from your
[1:22:58] servitude into sunship oh this word sets
[1:23:01] you at Liberty Church to step from
[1:23:03] servitude into sunship now this the the
[1:23:05] the sound of the Jubilee trumpet did not
[1:23:07] make you a son you were always a son oh
[1:23:10] you were already a son but what it did
[1:23:12] was it bring was it brought forth a word
[1:23:14] that gave you the Liberty to step out of
[1:23:15] your chains to step out of Slavery to
[1:23:18] step out of servitude to step out of the
[1:23:20] condition you were living in to step out
[1:23:22] of your bondage and to step into your
[1:23:24] adopted position as a Son of God oh I
[1:23:27] say this morning this bride is not bound
[1:23:29] down this bride is not living in bondage
[1:23:31] this bride is not living in slavery this
[1:23:34] bride is not living under the whis under
[1:23:36] the whip of the Taskmaster oh but this
[1:23:38] word has set this bride a liberty this
[1:23:41] word has set this bride oh a complete
[1:23:44] Liberty oh he would say now in these
[1:23:47] days when these priests when they would
[1:23:48] take the man out there maybe hoing in
[1:23:50] the cornfield he said the master would
[1:23:53] be walking up and down with him with the
[1:23:55] whip hurry up got to hurry up with this
[1:23:57] hurry up with that and just as soon as
[1:24:00] that trumpet sounded that man could
[1:24:01] throw that hold down and say I won't
[1:24:04] hold with it no more and that Taskmaster
[1:24:07] that slave driver was forbidden to touch
[1:24:09] him anymore oh I say I this morning this
[1:24:12] brother this devil is forbidden to touch
[1:24:15] you anymore oh Satan is forbidden to
[1:24:17] touch you anymore when you stand on this
[1:24:19] word it is impossible for Satan to get
[1:24:21] to you it is impossible for him to
[1:24:23] destroy you oh he might talk the talk oh
[1:24:27] he might he might fake it he might say
[1:24:29] but the prophet of God said all he is is
[1:24:31] a bluff oh but he would say they can't
[1:24:33] touch him anymore why because he was
[1:24:37] free oh when he had heard the good news
[1:24:39] the jubile was on the atonement was made
[1:24:42] and all the slaves could go free now he
[1:24:45] would talk about himself he would say I
[1:24:46] remember myself when I heard that good
[1:24:49] news come to my heart as a little old
[1:24:51] sinner boy laying here on the hospital
[1:24:52] bed the doctor said got three more
[1:24:54] minutes to live oh but I heard a sound
[1:24:57] from Heaven that told me the Jubilee
[1:24:59] year was on I accepted the Lord Jesus I
[1:25:02] turned loose of all the shackles of sin
[1:25:04] and I said to that devil you can't do me
[1:25:06] any more harm because I give my life to
[1:25:09] Christ Jesus you can't whip me anymore
[1:25:11] and I want you to notice since then he's
[1:25:13] bluffed me lots of times but he's not
[1:25:16] been able to touch me since because he's
[1:25:19] just a bluff he said I can hear the whip
[1:25:21] cracking and popping and so forth but it
[1:25:23] don't do no good because he can't get me
[1:25:26] because I belong to the Lord now oh
[1:25:29] Hallelujah he said I belong to the Lord
[1:25:31] now he said this word has Set Me Free
[1:25:34] the name of Jesus has Set Me Free oh
[1:25:37] this word has set him at Liberty devil
[1:25:39] you can't touch me I can hear the whip
[1:25:42] cracking but it can't touch me I can
[1:25:44] hear the chain smacking but that can't
[1:25:46] touch me oh I can hear the Taskmaster
[1:25:48] screaming oh but he can't touch me why
[1:25:51] because I have heard this Jubilee I have
[1:25:54] heard the word and this word has Set Me

[1:26:16] question about if you're free there
[1:26:18] ain't no question about if you can be
[1:26:19] delivered because when the word does
[1:26:21] something the word is an absolute and if
[1:26:24] the word does something he does it
[1:26:26] absolutely so if the word set you free
[1:26:28] you are free indeed if the word
[1:26:30] delivered you you are delivered indeed

[1:26:35] free indeed oh Hallelujah church we are
[1:26:39] free oh this message has set us at
[1:26:41] Liberty by restoring us back to who we
[1:26:43] were in the mind of God from before the
[1:26:45] foundation of the world oh I'm going to
[1:26:48] say that again this message has set us a
[1:26:50] liberty by restoring us back to who we
[1:26:52] were in the mind of God from before the

[1:28:10] when as they started reading that book
[1:28:11] of Esther as that word begin to come
