[23:52] least some understanding now Under the
[23:54] Umbrella of this message and what the
[23:57] true name of the god is the Lord Jesus
[23:59] Christ not titles but name and so many
[24:02] wonderful Revelations father we we
[24:04] understand that we didn't know back in
[24:06] the Pentecostal days in the year even
[24:08] the early days of the message how that
[24:10] the message has certainly been unfolded
[24:12] to us and Revelation is is getting
[24:15] greater and greater and as the prophet
[24:17] said we don't put a period there but we
[24:19] put a comma in whatever God will unfold
[24:21] to us and reveal to us according to your
[24:24] word and we're we're happy to be part of
[24:26] that end time word we thank you Lord
[24:28] that we could come to church again we
[24:29] still have the the freedom and the
[24:31] privilege to come and worship you we
[24:33] thank the Lord that you have again sent
[24:35] us a prophet that we have understanding
[24:37] of how to worship and and God's chosen
[24:40] place of worship and so many so many
[24:42] wonderful things we just give you praise
[24:44] now we look to you on behalf of these
[24:46] requests Lord I got a text from one of
[24:50] the brothers and happy valleys my sister
[24:52] Erica she had to go to the ER and she's
[24:54] it really recent really needs a touch
[24:57] from you she's fought that condition and
[25:00] having what they found in her brain now
[25:02] probably perhaps came from her lungs but
[25:05] God you're still an ever-present help in
[25:07] a time of need Lord you just said Ask
[25:09] believe and don't doubt you can have
[25:11] whatever things you desire God give us
[25:14] that Faith to believe for our sister
[25:15] Lord drop your faith down with our faith
[25:18] that'll make you a perfect faith that we
[25:19] can believe perhaps in behalf that you
[25:22] would touch her in Ron Peterson's
[25:24] daughter she was requested several
[25:26] months ago and she has cancer in
[25:28] fighting that and Lord God we know that
[25:30] as a prophet taught us not even to fear
[25:33] cancer but Lord faith can overcome so we
[25:36] just give us Faith the prayer to help to
[25:38] believe for her Lord in her condition
[25:40] and brother Ron Spencer and the
[25:42] different ones and the other requests

[46:05] believer says
[46:06] a man and amen The Book of Matthew the
[46:09] 11th chapter we want to look in the
[46:11] first verse
[46:13] of Matthew 11.
[46:15] Jesus here is speaking he says and it
[46:18] came to pass when Jesus had made an end
[46:20] of commanding his twelve disciples he
[46:23] departed fence to teach and to preach in
[46:25] their cities now when John had heard in
[46:28] the prison The Works of Christ he sent
[46:30] two of his disciples and said unto him
[46:33] art thou he that should come or do we
[46:36] look for another so he's asking
[46:38] questions concerning the Vindication of
[46:40] the Messiah he said are we are you he
[46:43] that should come or do we look for
[46:44] another but Jesus answered and said to
[46:47] them go and show John again those things
[46:50] which you do hear and see the blind
[46:53] receive their sight how many believes
[46:55] that's happened in this hour the lame
[46:57] walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf
[47:00] hear the dead are raised up and the poor
[47:02] have the gospel preached to them now
[47:05] notice the next words of Jesus and
[47:07] blessed somebody say blessed
[47:10] is he
[47:12] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[47:16] amen blessed is he whosoever shall not
[47:19] be offended in me now I also want to
[47:22] look in the Book of Luke the 17th
[47:24] chapter
[47:25] and read two verses there and we'll give
[47:28] you our subject tonight and let you be
[47:30] seated uh Luke the 17th chapter in the
[47:33] first verse I have been speaking to you
[47:35] a little bit here on the heavenlies and
[47:38] the Lord just totally changed my
[47:40] direction uh last night so we're gonna
[47:42] just follow him if that's okay amen here
[47:45] in Luke 17 Christ is teaching uh the
[47:48] church to avoid occasions of offense and
[47:51] in the first verse it said then said he
[47:53] unto his disciples it is impossible but
[47:57] that offenses will come
[47:59] but woe unto them through whom they come
[48:02] for it was better for him that a
[48:05] millstone were hanged about his neck and
[48:07] he cast into the sea then he should
[48:10] offend one of these little ones amen we
[48:13] asked the Lord this evening to add the
[48:15] blessing unto the reading of his word is
[48:17] you can have your seats here this
[48:18] afternoon amen how many uh thanks God
[48:21] for the reading of the word of God
[48:24] amen we are thankful tonight to be in
[48:26] the service of the Lord I I want to
[48:28] tonight if I can for just a few moments
[48:30] speak to you here and if I title this
[48:32] sermon I want to speak to you on he is
[48:34] right on schedule he is right on
[48:38] schedule when I speak of this he I want
[48:40] to go ahead and identify I'm speaking of
[48:42] God that God is right on schedule how
[48:45] many will agree with me tonight that God
[48:47] is an end time on time every time God
[48:50] Amen he's always on time he's always in
[48:54] time and every time he's right on time
[48:56] so amen I want to say this maybe just to
[48:58] lay a foundation read a few statements
[49:00] to you amen I'll say it like this God is
[49:03] always on time and the message at Thy
[49:06] word 51 but remember said on the
[49:07] scripture tonight Jesus was trying to
[49:09] teach the Apostle Peter how to take his
[49:12] word now he sometimes when you're
[49:14] absolutely at the end of the Rope that's
[49:16] when he speaks to you see as I was
[49:18] speaking this afternoon to the Hebrew
[49:20] children they were right in the fiery
[49:22] furnace before the Lord ever moved a
[49:24] hand but he's always on time now to the
[49:27] human mind he should have moved before
[49:29] they went in the fire to the human mind
[49:31] amen he should have moved before they
[49:33] ever went in there at bound hand and
[49:35] foot amen but to God Amen his thoughts
[49:38] are not our thoughts and our thoughts
[49:39] are not his thoughts amen he did he
[49:42] declares the mysterious works of his
[49:44] word by his own power amen God is always
[49:47] on time in the message the junction of
[49:50] time 56 he said God always is on time
[49:53] sometimes amen we are a little bit late
[49:55] or a little fake and a little different
[49:57] that does that's always done for a
[49:59] purpose amen but God is always on time
[50:02] with his message amen and so today I
[50:05] believe that we're facing a great
[50:07] something that the church should know
[50:08] and understand we ought to know what all
[50:10] this is about and find it in God's word
[50:12] for I believe that if it isn't in the
[50:15] word then I'm just a little doubtful of
[50:17] it but if God's word speaks of him amen
[50:19] then God no matter how indifferent it
[50:21] might seem to our custom of teaching and
[50:23] meant it's God working out his word many
[50:27] times it's contrary to our way of
[50:28] thinking or maybe the way we have been
[50:30] taught to think but we have to recognize
[50:32] the omnipotence of God when it's
[50:35] performed before us amen we have to
[50:38] recognize the omnipotence of God when it
[50:41] is performed before us meanest man I
[50:43] know he said well I'm so glad that there
[50:45] is one on time amen and that's God and
[50:49] his message it's always on time he said
[50:51] notice we find out they had to be ready
[50:53] and prepared to go in how did it happen
[50:55] he said we see him now sitting in the
[50:58] room unwashed unanointed not kissed
[51:00] welcome
[51:01] sitting in the Cardinal's house but I
[51:04] want to ask you something he said what
[51:06] happened to that foot wash funky where
[51:08] was he at how did he bypass that what an
[51:11] opportunity and he missed it oh I
[51:13] believe if I had been there and nobody
[51:15] was a coming I would have been on a
[51:16] stepladder somewhere watching for him to
[51:19] come amen see the honor of washing his
[51:22] feet but somehow he just bypassed him
[51:24] and let him go he said where was the man
[51:27] with the anoint you know but somehow he
[51:29] was there and was dirty he said it kills
[51:31] me to say it but Jesus with dirty feet
[51:34] you know the Frenchman calls him Jesus
[51:36] he said amen with dirty feet nobody
[51:38] cared enough to wash his feet he said
[51:40] what's that got to do with us brother
[51:42] Branham he's come and he was on time
[51:44] amen amen he didn't get his feet washed
[51:47] because he was late amen he didn't get
[51:49] his feet washed because they didn't
[51:51] recognize who he was when he come in the
[51:53] building he said and he's always on time
[51:55] he's never late he said and we'll call
[51:58] for a Revival and comes and somebody
[52:00] starts to praise the Lord or we hey man
[52:02] he's put out the church see he's never
[52:04] welcome amen it's Jesus with dirty feet
[52:07] amen I I want to read you one more in
[52:09] Super Signs 63 he said God know the end
[52:12] from the beginning how many agrees that
[52:14] God knows the end from the beginning
[52:16] therefore he could plan everything that
[52:19] it would work out just to his glory and
[52:22] that gives us courage to know that no
[52:24] matter what comes your goals amen God is
[52:26] making everything the clock is ticking
[52:29] exactly on time amen I know it's a bit
[52:32] it's a it's a difficult time I know
[52:33] there's more pressure than you've ever
[52:35] faced in your life amen but let me
[52:37] remind you tonight that our God is not a
[52:40] slack God Amen Our God does not show up
[52:42] sometimes and shot show up other times
[52:44] amen but whenever he makes a promise to
[52:47] be with us he said I will be with you
[52:49] even in You Until the End of the Age
[52:51] amen and listen we're closer Home than
[52:53] we've ever been before amen this is not
[52:56] the time to let depression this is not
[52:58] the time to let nervousness and anxiety
[53:00] Amen in the time 1000 tribulations and
[53:03] disappointments of our life amen back us
[53:05] off of the position that God has given
[53:07] us amen our God is still with us amen if
[53:11] we're in the valley he's with us if
[53:13] we're on the mountain he's with us if
[53:15] we're sick he is with us if for well he
[53:17] is with us amen if we are broke or we
[53:19] are rich it makes no difference amen our
[53:22] God is with us he's with us on Wednesday
[53:24] he's with us on Sunday amen he's with us
[53:27] on Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday and
[53:29] Saturday amen because he's God and he
[53:32] will not fail his believing children God
[53:35] is exactly on time God is with us God is
[53:38] making everything work out amen that his
[53:40] glory will be seen among his people he
[53:43] said sometimes we get weary and we get
[53:45] upset have you ever been there
[53:47] amen we get weary and we get upset and
[53:51] we get hastily and we think oh we must
[53:53] do this or we must do that amen but you
[53:55] just remember God's will be just
[53:58] exactly on time all these things has to
[54:01] be this way it has to all be done
[54:03] according to his great knowledge his
[54:05] foreknowledge he could predestinate not
[54:08] by his desire amen but by his
[54:10] foreknowledge see amen he knew who would
[54:13] accept it and who would not therefore he
[54:15] can make everything somebody say
[54:17] everything he can make everything work
[54:19] according to his big time clock that's
[54:22] it taken away amen he can foretell the
[54:24] end from the beginning and therefore he
[54:27] knew that we would live in this day he
[54:29] knew we would
[54:30] and he had plans for this day he had
[54:33] plans for every day and never has one of
[54:36] his plans ever failed he is always on
[54:39] time amen well in the mouth of two or
[54:42] three Witnesses let every word amen be
[54:44] established can I get a witness here
[54:46] tonight they can witness that God is on
[54:49] time he is in time every time it doesn't
[54:52] matter if it's the Red Sea he's on time
[54:54] it doesn't matter if it's the Lion's Den
[54:57] he's on time it doesn't matter if it's
[54:59] the whale's belly and Jonah's day he is
[55:01] on time because he's God and he refuses
[55:04] to be reduced from being God by the
[55:06] situations and the trials of your life
[55:08] he will be there always because he's God
[55:12] and he's always on time now amen when
[55:14] you read that Matthew 11 chapter what I
[55:17] have just read to you is what a prophet
[55:19] called amen the Forgotten beatitude but
[55:22] can I see it you like this thank God for
[55:24] a prophet who rediscovered what had been
[55:27] forgotten
[55:28] thank God for a prophet that
[55:31] rediscovered what had been forgotten he
[55:33] says here in paragraph six of the
[55:35] Forgotten beatitude he said we want to
[55:37] read Matthew 11 6 he said now I'm going
[55:39] to call this subject amen the forgotten
[55:41] the attitude amen now we are all
[55:43] acquainted with the Beatitudes how many
[55:45] is acquainted with the Beatitudes
[55:47] they're in the Book of Matthew in the
[55:49] fifth chapter amen Jesus taught the
[55:51] Beatitudes when he'd taken the people
[55:53] and he went upon the mountain just
[55:55] before the beginning amen or just as his
[55:58] ministry will start him see when he went
[56:00] up there and began to teach he said see
[56:02] he became their leader and he went up
[56:05] there and taught them to the Beatitudes
[56:06] and said now you've heard them say of
[56:08] old time amen but I say unto you now
[56:11] when he said you've heard them say of
[56:13] old time he was actually referring back
[56:16] to Moses in the book of Deuteronomy the
[56:18] 18th chapter when he said the Lord your
[56:20] God will raise up a prophet unto thee
[56:22] Amen in the midst of thee of thy
[56:24] Brethren liken unto me and unto him
[56:27] shall ye herk amen so Moses were
[56:30] speaking of the coming of Jesus and when
[56:33] Jesus come on the scene he was speaking
[56:35] back of what Moses prophesied in other
[56:37] words Moses was saying he's coming and
[56:40] when Jesus come on the scene he could
[56:42] say I am what Moses said was coming
[56:46] brother man like this he said Moses
[56:49] was a type of Jesus he said Jesus was an
[56:52] antidype of Moses he said Moses was a
[56:54] prophet he was a lawgiver he was a kind
[56:57] of like a king over the people in the
[56:58] wilderness with Israel he was born to
[57:01] prophet he was hid from Pharaoh just as
[57:03] Jesus was he and amen from the Roman
[57:06] Empire see his ministry and life amen
[57:08] just typed right along and Moses when he
[57:11] got the children of Israel in the
[57:13] wilderness amen he went up in the
[57:15] mountain and got the Commandments amen
[57:17] and then came down and began to teach
[57:19] the commandments so in other words Moses
[57:22] was not teaching them things that he was
[57:24] hatching out of the back part of his
[57:25] mind he was not teaching him things that
[57:27] he thought well maybe if I say this
[57:29] it'll help him amen but before Moses
[57:32] opened his mouth he went up on the
[57:34] mountain and received a message amen and
[57:37] come down and established in stone what
[57:39] God spoke to him lip to ear and Jesus
[57:42] before he moved into the position of a
[57:44] leadership amen he went up on the
[57:46] mountain and begin to teach the
[57:48] Beatitudes now amen don't make me preach
[57:51] by myself tonight amen but Moses amen
[57:53] went to the mountain and God for
[57:55] Revelation amen Paul went to the desert
[57:57] and got for Revelation and in the end
[57:59] time there was a man named William
[58:01] Marion Branham amen who found his way to
[58:04] the mountains of Arizona Amen in the
[58:06] desert and received the revelation of
[58:09] the word of God and the AIDS were living
[58:10] listen friends we ought to have a smile
[58:13] on our face tonight we ought to have an
[58:15] amen in our mouth we we ought to have a
[58:17] Hallelujah ringing in our soul amen our
[58:19] leader has come into position but he's
[58:21] not brought us into position amen by
[58:24] some legalistic beating and banging you
[58:26] around but he has brought you into
[58:27] leadership by the blessings of the
[58:30] revelation of the word and the age
[58:31] you're living
[58:32] amen
[58:34] he's on time amen I know there's a lot
[58:37] of pressure but he's on time amen when
[58:39] Jesus come in power what did he do he
[58:42] taught them the blessings of the word he
[58:44] went he went up on the mountain sat down
[58:46] and began to teach the people here's
[58:48] what he taught him brother Timmy taught
[58:49] him blessed are the parent heart amen
[58:51] for they shall see God he said blessed
[58:54] are the poor in spirit amen for theirs
[58:56] is the kingdom of God he said blessed
[58:58] are you when you are reviled and
[59:00] persecuted and made fun of and so forth
[59:02] amen for they persecuted the prophets
[59:04] which was before you amen so rejoice and
[59:07] be exceedingly glad amen because great
[59:10] is your reward in heaven amen Jesus was
[59:13] teaching the blessings amen upon the
[59:16] church and he called them the Beatitudes
[59:18] he said now Moses tap was a type of him
[59:21] and we're all acquainted with those
[59:22] types of what Moses and what Jesus was
[59:24] amen but this be attitude amen is on
[59:27] over in the 11th chapter and the sixth
[59:30] verse if you don't watch you'll read
[59:32] right over the top of it see and you
[59:34] won't get it it's wedged Amen in between
[59:36] other words but it's still of the
[59:39] attitude I say thank God for a
[59:41] dispensational prophet who could go
[59:43] through the Bible amen and find the
[59:46] things that the world had missed amen
[59:48] and rediscovered them come on what did
[59:50] he say he said I'm not out here amen
[59:52] just as a suspect her I am here as a
[59:55] prospector amen I am finding the golden
[59:57] nuggets and the word and I'm digging
[1:00:00] them out and I'm polishing them up and
[1:00:02] I'm presenting them to you amen as
[1:00:05] truths as blessings and you know when I
[1:00:07] say I say thank God forever Tafe we got
[1:00:09] thank God for every book we got thank
[1:00:12] God for every man of God preaching this
[1:00:14] message because they're not preaching
[1:00:16] legalism they're not preaching their
[1:00:18] ideas they are preaching the revelation
[1:00:20] of the Beatitudes listen and if they're
[1:00:23] preaching the message they're not
[1:00:24] telling you you're condemned they're
[1:00:26] telling you you're blessed if they're
[1:00:28] preaching the message amen they're
[1:00:30] saying blessed are the pure and hearts
[1:00:31] for they shall see God they're saying
[1:00:33] blessed are you that are reviled and
[1:00:35] revile not back against the revilers
[1:00:37] amen because your reward is in the
[1:00:40] heavens of Heavens listen friends we are
[1:00:42] not a bunch of church members women we
[1:00:45] are the pride of Jesus Christ who is
[1:00:47] following General Jesus and he's not
[1:00:49] leading Us by a rope and he's not moving
[1:00:51] Us by a whip amen but he's leading us
[1:00:54] and moving Us by the sovereignty of his
[1:00:56] own will and the age we're living in
[1:00:57] listen we're not about to help us people
[1:00:59] we are the Blessed people of the most
[1:01:02] high God if anybody got a righteous
[1:01:04] shout we gotta write a shout if anybody
[1:01:07] got a right to dance this ride's gonna
[1:01:09] write to dance she's been blessed beyond
[1:01:11] measure brother
[1:01:14] but I'll shout by myself we've been
[1:01:17] blessed beyond measure come on come on
[1:01:19] Mary hey man you didn't work yourself
[1:01:21] into this position amen God gave it to
[1:01:24] you amen you didn't earn your way into
[1:01:25] this position God gave it to you and you
[1:01:28] know what you got to do you got to
[1:01:30] accept what God gave you in the age that
[1:01:32] he sent it to you well glory to God
[1:01:35] somebody shout hallelujah you're not
[1:01:37] making yourself bride your bride by
[1:01:40] accepting what he sent in the age that
[1:01:42] you're living in
[1:01:43] it's a blessing upon you it's not a
[1:01:46] curse it's not a condemnation it's a
[1:01:48] blessing but it took a prophet to
[1:01:50] ReDiscover the blessing he said blessed
[1:01:53] is he whosoever shall not be offended in
[1:01:56] me he said blessed are the pure in
[1:01:58] Hearts blessed are the peacemakers amen
[1:02:01] blessed are blessed are and way over
[1:02:03] here amen he slips this be attitude in
[1:02:06] again
[1:02:08] amen nearly six chapters later brother
[1:02:11] Branson he slips another beatitude in
[1:02:14] that would have been ignored had a
[1:02:16] prophet not come listen if a prophet had
[1:02:18] not come we would have every right to be
[1:02:21] living like a bunch of offended people
[1:02:23] without any reason to praise God but
[1:02:25] because God sent a prophet the coming of
[1:02:28] a prophet was the removing of the
[1:02:31] ability to live underneath the offenses
[1:02:33] of your family and the offenses of your
[1:02:35] first birth and the offenses of what
[1:02:37] somebody said or what somebody done God
[1:02:40] who is rich in Mercy amen a lot of
[1:02:42] profit to ReDiscover what I believe is
[1:02:45] the most powerful beatitude of the
[1:02:47] entire Beatitudes is blessed is he that
[1:02:50] can live in a world of offense but he
[1:02:52] does not become a product of the
[1:02:54] offensive world that he's living in but
[1:02:56] the spirit of God can raise him above
[1:02:58] the hurts it can raise him above the
[1:03:00] disappointments it can raise him above
[1:03:02] the trials and the situations that the
[1:03:04] devil tries to bury a Believer under oh
[1:03:07] yeah blessed is amen blessed is he
[1:03:10] blessed are you how don't you feel like
[1:03:12] preaching with me tonight amen you're a
[1:03:14] blessed man brother Amos Amen brother
[1:03:16] Joel you're a blessed man brother Jr
[1:03:18] you're a blessed man amen God allowed a
[1:03:21] prophet brother Daniel to find a
[1:03:23] blessing and pronounce it upon the
[1:03:25] church and say blessed is he whosoever
[1:03:28] shall not be offended in me now this
[1:03:32] word offended it's a it's a very
[1:03:33] powerful word it means to put a
[1:03:35] stumbling block amen or an impediment in
[1:03:38] the way upon which another May trip and
[1:03:41] fall it means to offend listen this
[1:03:43] definition it means to entice to sin now
[1:03:47] what is sin sin is unbelief and the
[1:03:50] prophet Brethren preaches an entire
[1:03:52] sermon called the enticing spirits
[1:03:56] then can I tell you what enticing
[1:03:58] Spirits are they are spirits of offense
[1:04:01] enticing Spirits amen trying to lead the
[1:04:05] church amen to disbelieve the word of
[1:04:07] God that word offended means to cause a
[1:04:10] person to begin to distrust and to
[1:04:13] Desert one whom he ought to trusts and
[1:04:15] Obey it means to call to fall away it
[1:04:18] means to be offended in one it means to
[1:04:21] see in another what I disapprove of and
[1:04:24] what hinders me from acknowledging his
[1:04:26] authority Amen to cause one I just
[1:04:29] picked it up so I'm gonna preach it amen
[1:04:30] I know there's a lot of people right now
[1:04:32] amen they're giving all their time to
[1:04:34] studying the message and trying to prove
[1:04:36] her brother Brandon made this mistake
[1:04:38] and he misquoted this and amen but I
[1:04:40] just want to put them I might as well
[1:04:42] preach I'm here and amen I just want to
[1:04:44] put them reprobates on notice and let
[1:04:46] them know there's not one thing you can
[1:04:48] come up with in this message that is
[1:04:50] going to cause me Amen to distrust the
[1:04:52] seventh angel amen listen you didn't
[1:04:54] vindicate him so you came and
[1:04:56] vindicating to me amen by The God Who is
[1:04:59] rich in Mercy amen that sent William ran
[1:05:01] him into this generation is the same God
[1:05:04] that met me and called me to preach the
[1:05:06] message and if he Vindicated him to me
[1:05:08] there ain't enough questions and essays
[1:05:10] and scientific researches that you can
[1:05:12] produce to change my teeth my faith is
[1:05:15] this this day this scripture is
[1:05:18] fulfilled Malachi 4 is fulfilled
[1:05:20] Revelation 10 is fulfilled Luke 17 30 is
[1:05:23] fulfilled and there ain't enough
[1:05:25] offenses from a bunch of unbelievers to
[1:05:27] back the bride off of the blessing that
[1:05:30] she has received in the age of she's
[1:05:32] living in amen I trust this message I
[1:05:35] trust the authority of this message I
[1:05:37] trust the authority of just saying what
[1:05:40] a prophet said
[1:05:42] and it means to see another when I
[1:05:44] disapprove of and what hinders me from
[1:05:46] acknowledging his authority it means to
[1:05:48] cause one to judge unfavorly amen or or
[1:05:51] misjudged now watch this Earth unjustly
[1:05:54] of another that word offended means
[1:05:57] since one who stumbles or whose foot
[1:05:59] gets entangled feels annoyed it means to
[1:06:02] cause one that is pleasure of a thing it
[1:06:05] means to make indignant it means to be
[1:06:08] displeased Amen to watch it means to be
[1:06:11] in now I say this indignation now when
[1:06:16] you look at this you realize that what
[1:06:18] we're seeing here is John's Ministry
[1:06:21] right and in charge Ministry can I say
[1:06:24] it to you like this John had a
[1:06:27] scriptural Ministry now he was one of
[1:06:29] the five comings of Elijah right we all
[1:06:31] know there's five comings Right There
[1:06:33] Was Elijah then there was Elisha then
[1:06:35] there was John the Baptist amen then
[1:06:37] there was Malachi 4 which we believe is
[1:06:39] William Branham according to
[1:06:41] malachiosaur amen then there was
[1:06:43] Revelation 11 which will be ma which
[1:06:45] will be John and Moses amen and they
[1:06:48] will take the message back to the 144
[1:06:51] 000. amen so when John come upon the
[1:06:53] Earth John come upon the earth born
[1:06:55] underneath a commission and that
[1:06:58] commission was amen introduce the
[1:07:00] Messiah listen John it don't matter what
[1:07:03] you got it don't matter what you do have
[1:07:04] amen it just matters that you fulfill
[1:07:07] the commission that I brought you up on
[1:07:09] the earth and Thaddeus introduced the
[1:07:11] Messiah so what did the Bible say in
[1:07:13] John 1 6 it says there was a man sent
[1:07:16] from God whose name was John this man
[1:07:20] come from God and his name was John now
[1:07:23] the Bible tells us that John amen bear
[1:07:26] record of Jesus as the light the truth
[1:07:28] see then the light Has Come Into
[1:07:31] Darkness amen and darkness comprehended
[1:07:34] it not amen so John with his commission
[1:07:36] all of a sudden he's got the greatest
[1:07:38] commission and brother Jordan that is
[1:07:40] you introduce the Messiah
[1:07:43] when he comes on the scene amen you will
[1:07:46] recognize him and you will begin to
[1:07:49] declare Messiah is here now but this man
[1:07:52] with his commission all of a sudden amen
[1:07:54] we find him in prison now think about
[1:07:57] this amen we find John in prison and the
[1:08:00] prophet said John had been placed in
[1:08:02] prison amen because of his ministry amen
[1:08:06] John was not in prison because he robbed
[1:08:08] the bank he was not in prison because he
[1:08:10] was selling dope amen he was in prison
[1:08:12] because of his ministry which was his
[1:08:16] commission and oh what a rugged fellow
[1:08:18] John was he really truly was the
[1:08:21] messenger because Jesus said amen he
[1:08:23] shall go before me and how when they
[1:08:25] called him he was perfectly like Elijah
[1:08:28] who his Spirit was anointed see John was
[1:08:31] the anointed Elijah of the New Testament
[1:08:34] let me just go and say this when they
[1:08:36] put John in prison it did not lessen his
[1:08:39] anointing amen of being the third coming
[1:08:42] of Elijah or the Fulfillment of the
[1:08:45] messiah's introduce her amen if John
[1:08:47] come on church and then the prison did
[1:08:49] not devalue the Commission in other
[1:08:52] words wherever you put John he would
[1:08:54] steal the prophet of God if you put him
[1:08:57] in the prison he was the prophet if you
[1:08:59] put him on the banks of the Jordan he
[1:09:01] was the prophet if you put him in the
[1:09:02] pulpit and there was Herod with his wife
[1:09:05] it was unlawful he was still the prophet
[1:09:07] because he was born with that commission
[1:09:09] and I might as well go ahead and say it
[1:09:11] amen sister Kim wherever you put this
[1:09:13] Pride amen she will be the bride if you
[1:09:16] put her in the hospital she's still the
[1:09:18] bride if you put her in the grave she'll
[1:09:20] still be the bride if you put her in
[1:09:22] prison she'll still be the bride there
[1:09:24] is no place you can put this bride that
[1:09:26] will reduce her from being what God
[1:09:29] called her and ordained her to be God
[1:09:31] called you to be victorious so you can
[1:09:33] be victorious in the school God called
[1:09:35] you to be victorious so you can be
[1:09:37] Victorious on your child because your
[1:09:40] commission cannot be listened by the
[1:09:42] condition of your life
[1:09:45] oh yeah and then what you're going
[1:09:47] through brother during it does not
[1:09:49] change what God commissioned you to be
[1:09:51] from before the foundation of the world
[1:09:54] then John was a rugged Man he was a
[1:09:57] Wilderness man he had and all of a
[1:09:59] sudden he goes from the freedom of the
[1:10:02] Wilderness Amen to the musty jail cell
[1:10:04] of a prison
[1:10:06] he goes from the freeness brother Terry
[1:10:09] of the Locust and the honey and then in
[1:10:12] doing this he pleased Amen to sitting in
[1:10:14] an old musty wet damp jail but you know
[1:10:17] what it did not change who he was it
[1:10:20] must have been a horrible experience for
[1:10:22] John man it been free all of a sudden
[1:10:24] amen he finds himself down in a little
[1:10:27] old musty dirty town perhaps dark in a
[1:10:30] dungeon somewhere because that life
[1:10:32] chest Bell was herodias had him thrown
[1:10:34] in there because he told him it wasn't
[1:10:36] right for Herod to take his brother
[1:10:38] Philip's wife and live with her he said
[1:10:40] see John was not a compromiser amen John
[1:10:43] was a man of God he said in John was one
[1:10:46] of those men that did not hold back any
[1:10:48] punches amen listen friends John amen
[1:10:51] knew if he said that it could put him in
[1:10:54] jail but it would still be bride he come
[1:10:57] on sir he would still be a prophet so
[1:10:59] what John could have done was John could
[1:11:01] have said in his office and said now let
[1:11:03] me let me let me find the politically
[1:11:04] correct way to go up there and say it
[1:11:07] ain't right for you to have that woman
[1:11:08] because if I say it the way God's given
[1:11:11] it to me to say they could put me in
[1:11:12] jail but John was not looking at his
[1:11:15] Earthly status amen and forfeiting his
[1:11:19] Heavenly status for his Earthly status
[1:11:21] but John knew amen if I say it and they
[1:11:24] cut my head off I'll still be a Son of
[1:11:27] God if I don't say it and they'd come on
[1:11:29] come on church if I don't say it amen
[1:11:32] I'll get corrected by God so either I
[1:11:34] get corrected by God or I just say it
[1:11:36] and take the Earthly lash of Correction
[1:11:38] and John was a man who was sent from God
[1:11:41] not to be a compromiser amen but to be a
[1:11:44] prophet of God let me just go and say
[1:11:46] this church and living God don't you
[1:11:48] back off of your position as the Bride
[1:11:50] of Jesus Christ for the fear of some
[1:11:52] pressure for the fear of somebody that
[1:11:54] won't lock you or somebody will say
[1:11:56] something about you listen brother Tim
[1:11:58] if they scandalize your name and they
[1:12:00] drag it through the mud when they get
[1:12:02] done you'll still have your name on the
[1:12:05] Lamb's Book of Life because you're
[1:12:06] position is not coming from their
[1:12:09] ordination of some man your position is
[1:12:11] coming from the foreknowledge of God
[1:12:14] well I feel good
[1:12:16] what was right to John was right what
[1:12:18] was wrong was wrong I hear the prophet
[1:12:20] say oh God we need more men like that
[1:12:23] today how many agrees
[1:12:25] man who will stand on real genuine
[1:12:29] convictions of the word of God speak it
[1:12:32] and don't hold your don't hold your
[1:12:34] peace speak it out now what was John he
[1:12:37] was a prophet and what did God like in
[1:12:40] His prophets to he likened His prophets
[1:12:42] unto Eagles and the prophet said there
[1:12:44] was John now in that little musty dirty
[1:12:46] tail with some dirty bread they probably
[1:12:48] follow him in once in a while he
[1:12:50] probably gotten thin and no way to read
[1:12:53] his Bible said like this and forgotten
[1:12:55] the attitude you can look the word up he
[1:12:57] calls it mustering amen John is
[1:13:00] mustering away his physical body is
[1:13:03] mustering away from what it used to be
[1:13:05] but his physical body it's not changing
[1:13:08] his Heavenly position
[1:13:10] I wish I was a preacher right now
[1:13:11] brother Tim his physical condition was
[1:13:14] not changing what was his position in
[1:13:17] the mind of God among church he was
[1:13:19] bound to where he couldn't read his
[1:13:20] Bible he was so low he couldn't even
[1:13:22] hardly lift his head but in the eyes of
[1:13:25] God brother Josiah he was still a
[1:13:27] prophet in the eyes of God he would
[1:13:30] still be announcer of the forerunning of
[1:13:32] the first coming of Christ listen people
[1:13:34] I know that sometimes our physical
[1:13:36] bodies will fill us and ailments will
[1:13:39] stack Upon Us amen but your gray hair
[1:13:41] amen does not reduce your position as a
[1:13:44] son or daughter of God Amen the sickness
[1:13:47] that is attach your body does not reduce
[1:13:49] the condition of you as a Son of God
[1:13:52] well I might as well preach amen I'm
[1:13:55] just going to use her brother during for
[1:13:57] a second amen Parkinson's does not
[1:13:59] diminish I'm in a position of a Son of
[1:14:01] God Parkinson's is not his identity it's
[1:14:04] not his position and I'm just going to
[1:14:06] go and say it brother during we thank
[1:14:08] you buddy amen we salute two I mean you
[1:14:11] didn't have to get in your car and drive
[1:14:13] 18 hours and sit in a tent and come to
[1:14:15] the meetings amen but you come because
[1:14:18] you're a gin Rock you're a lawyer of the
[1:14:20] Cross and he drove out here listen he'll
[1:14:22] go wherever he can to be in a meeting
[1:14:24] with his own body against him you know
[1:14:26] why because his Earthly condition is not
[1:14:29] devalue in his Heavenly position in the
[1:14:32] eyes of God he don't see Parkinson's he
[1:14:34] sees a Victorious Son of God and
[1:14:37] whatever you're going to tonight Church
[1:14:39] in the eyes of God he does not see your
[1:14:42] complex he sees you as a Victorious son
[1:14:45] and daughter of God he does not see you
[1:14:47] as a confused help us hopeless
[1:14:49] individual he sees you as a messiah
[1:14:51] Anointed with a purifier
[1:14:54] come on put us in the jail but we'll
[1:14:57] still be a believer put us in the
[1:14:59] hospital we'll still be a believer come
[1:15:01] on you can put brother walk in a nursing
[1:15:03] home and he'll still speak in tongues
[1:15:05] and he'll still shout and sing because
[1:15:08] the Earthly condition is not this value
[1:15:10] in his Heavenly position
[1:15:13] Hallelujah when I feel like you're out
[1:15:15] in church we're going through a lot but
[1:15:18] we're still Sons and Daughters of God
[1:15:22] we're still gonna make it I know you may
[1:15:25] think I ate 16 sticks a night a night
[1:15:28] and I might have but I think it's time
[1:15:30] to lift up her head I think it's time to
[1:15:33] remember that our Earthly condition is
[1:15:35] not changing Who We Are
[1:15:37] being in jail we might not be able to
[1:15:40] read our Bibles we might not be able to
[1:15:42] run the fields and Wilderness like we
[1:15:43] used to
[1:15:45] our eagle eyes might even get filmed
[1:15:47] over but the prophet of God said an
[1:15:50] eagle can go higher than any other bird
[1:15:52] the higher you get the further away you
[1:15:55] can see
[1:15:57] I'm on Church the higher you get the
[1:16:01] further away you can see remember so the
[1:16:04] higher you get more you can see
[1:16:05] therefore prophets in the bible were
[1:16:07] those Eagles who could soar way up above
[1:16:09] the congregation and find out what thus
[1:16:12] saith the Lord was then come back down
[1:16:14] and bring the news so in other words no
[1:16:17] wonder the devil Brother Sam I wanted
[1:16:19] John to muster away no wonder the devil
[1:16:22] wanted John take a lie to get filmed
[1:16:24] over no wonder the devil wanted John to
[1:16:27] get weak and get discouraged and get
[1:16:30] helpless and hopeless and lose the
[1:16:31] strength of his confession because if he
[1:16:34] got so low he couldn't go so high then
[1:16:36] the people would no longer be receiving
[1:16:38] the saithful Lord but God who is rich in
[1:16:41] Mercy provided a rock that John could
[1:16:44] put his quest to your eyes on and could
[1:16:46] beat the sleep out of his eyes and he
[1:16:48] could climb back up in the heavily oh
[1:16:51] God
[1:16:52] I feel like preaching he could climb
[1:16:54] back up in the heavilies and he could
[1:16:56] see what he was supposed to see John was
[1:16:58] not ordained to see the prison he was
[1:17:01] not ordained amen now come on church
[1:17:03] amen we're Eagles we're not ordained to
[1:17:06] look at our problems all the time we're
[1:17:08] not ordained to focus on this situation
[1:17:10] and focus on that situation come on I'm
[1:17:13] just going to preach amen I know there's
[1:17:15] a lot of different directions right now
[1:17:16] amen but whatever you do you focus on
[1:17:20] this message and you pursue it with
[1:17:22] every answer strengthen your body I
[1:17:24] don't care what a preacher says I don't
[1:17:26] care what a church does you remember
[1:17:28] that God sent a message and we're not to
[1:17:31] follow a man or to follow the voice of
[1:17:33] the seventh angel
[1:17:35] y'all know I'm telling you the truth and
[1:17:37] let me just go and say this there's a
[1:17:39] pressure Amen to accept and just accept
[1:17:41] and just accept but I'm just gonna go
[1:17:43] and take some Liberty and preach to you
[1:17:45] you are not under obligation to accept
[1:17:47] anything that is contrary to what a
[1:17:49] prophet tone in the age you're living in
[1:17:51] I don't care what the guy's name is I
[1:17:54] don't care what status he curse I don't
[1:17:56] care what his family name is if it's
[1:17:58] contrary to what William Marion Branham
[1:18:00] said you can cut my head off but I'll go
[1:18:03] down to bleed and say you stay with what
[1:18:05] a prophet said it'll lead you to the
[1:18:07] sicknesses it leads you through the
[1:18:09] disappointments it'll lead you to the
[1:18:11] Dark Nights come on church can I get a
[1:18:13] witness that this message is an on-time
[1:18:15] message it'll show up in the darkest of
[1:18:17] hours when you say preacher when does
[1:18:19] Jesus come along it's always the darkest
[1:18:22] of hours and then Jesus comes walking on
[1:18:25] the water and he changes the situation
[1:18:27] because he's an on-time God
[1:18:32] with this message
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:37] I feel that devil pushing back and I
[1:18:39] will push back you stay with this
[1:18:41] message you stay with what a prophet
[1:18:44] said
[1:18:46] you say well brother Andrew I've got
[1:18:47] accepted no you don't
[1:18:49] come on Church okay you don't believe me
[1:18:52] go to Matthew 4. in the Bible the devil
[1:18:56] quoted Jesus the word and Jesus rejected
[1:18:59] it
[1:19:01] well he didn't reject the word he was
[1:19:04] the word he was rejecting the direction
[1:19:06] of the one who was presenting it
[1:19:09] come on church he would come it was the
[1:19:11] word but the way it was being presented
[1:19:14] was not in a pure unadulterated
[1:19:17] Direction so because Jesus was the word
[1:19:20] who could not mix the word with a with a
[1:19:22] perverted Direction he rejected Satan's
[1:19:25] proposition and stayed with the word
[1:19:28] come on Church of the Living God I think
[1:19:31] it's time we get some Backbone in us I
[1:19:33] think we forget about who's who and what
[1:19:35] position who holds and remember that a
[1:19:37] prophet went around the world seven
[1:19:39] times to bring us a message without
[1:19:42] confusion without babbling without
[1:19:44] babbling influence to bring us to a
[1:19:47] place of stability come on Church we're
[1:19:49] Eagles and we got to get our eyes off
[1:19:51] all the directions and we've got to get
[1:19:52] our eyes on what will lift us up in the
[1:19:54] heavens I'll tell you what a prophet
[1:19:56] said he said if we're Eagles and it's
[1:19:57] time for the Eagles to get to Flying
[1:19:59] higher
[1:20:00] if we're Eagles it's time for the Eagles
[1:20:03] to get to Flying higher what are you
[1:20:05] saying preacher I'm saying Revelation 4
[1:20:06] 1 after this I looked you need to take
[1:20:09] another look after this I looked and
[1:20:11] behold a door was opened in heaven and
[1:20:14] the first voice which I heard was it
[1:20:15] wherever Trump had talked with me which
[1:20:17] said come up hither military I've never
[1:20:19] called it like this today he said come
[1:20:22] up hither and I will show thee things
[1:20:24] I'm on church amen he said come up
[1:20:27] hither watch those words I brother Sean
[1:20:29] will show thee things amen which he must
[1:20:32] be here after look at this word show it
[1:20:34] means to expose to the eyes
[1:20:37] it means to give evidence or proof of a
[1:20:40] thing it means to show by words or teach
[1:20:43] so here the spirit is telling John
[1:20:45] notice the order I which is God will
[1:20:48] show thee which is the believer
[1:20:50] my goodness it's not you showing God
[1:20:53] your problems it's God showing you the
[1:20:56] promise concerning your problems now the
[1:20:58] Book of Revelation is a prophetic book
[1:21:00] right and the prophet shows us that that
[1:21:02] book was reserved amen for the sons of
[1:21:05] the last day which would be the sons
[1:21:07] that would come to adoption amen which
[1:21:09] would make those Sons a prophetic class
[1:21:11] of people then the proud of God said
[1:21:13] it's not the life story of John it's the
[1:21:16] revelation of Jesus Christ in the future
[1:21:18] Church ages to come he said the Greek
[1:21:20] word revelation is apocalypse say which
[1:21:23] means unveiling so this unveiling is
[1:21:25] perfectly described in the example of a
[1:21:28] sculptor unveiling his work of stature
[1:21:31] exposing it to the onlooker it's an
[1:21:34] uncovering it's a revealing that was
[1:21:36] previously hid now the uncovering is not
[1:21:39] only the revelation of the person of
[1:21:41] Christ but it is the revelation of his
[1:21:44] future works and the oncoming sevens
[1:21:46] Church ages so therefore the importance
[1:21:48] of Revelation by his Spirit to a True
[1:21:51] Believer can never be overemphasized
[1:21:54] that's why the prophet said pray for
[1:21:56] Revelation more than anything because if
[1:21:59] you ever get a revelation of your
[1:22:01] position that you hold in the mind of
[1:22:03] God in the situations of your Earthly
[1:22:06] condition will never back you all for
[1:22:08] the revelation of who you are in the
[1:22:11] mind of God what are you saying preacher
[1:22:13] I'm saying that God Amen is known by
[1:22:15] spiritual somebody say spiritual divine
[1:22:18] revelation I say this we should expect
[1:22:21] Revelation listen I know it's just
[1:22:23] Wednesday night amen but have I got any
[1:22:25] inspectors have I got any expectors here
[1:22:27] tonight have I got anybody that says it
[1:22:30] may be Wednesday amen but I'm still
[1:22:32] expecting a revelation listen friends we
[1:22:35] can tell God God I come for revelation
[1:22:37] God I don't want to leave here with just
[1:22:39] a sermon I don't want to leave here with
[1:22:41] just a few songs I want to leave you
[1:22:43] with a revelation you know what we can
[1:22:45] pray when we come to those doors we can
[1:22:47] pray God show yourself to me all right
[1:22:50] come on no other age could pray that but
[1:22:53] this age can every other Age come to
[1:22:55] church and they looked at the word amen
[1:22:58] with a veil over the word but in this
[1:23:00] age the Mighty God has been unveiled
[1:23:03] before us then we can look at the word
[1:23:05] and not look at it as just somebody that
[1:23:08] sees a veil over something desirable to
[1:23:10] see but we can look at it and we can see
[1:23:13] amen what is behind the veil and there's
[1:23:16] joy behind the veil there's healing
[1:23:18] behind the veil there's Victory and
[1:23:20] power there's power and deliverance and
[1:23:23] a miracle and an answer and it's behind
[1:23:25] the veil if you come to not expecting to
[1:23:27] see the Lord in his work God will show
[1:23:29] you himself and will give you such a
[1:23:31] peace listen I propose to you you don't
[1:23:34] have to leave here nervous you don't
[1:23:36] have to leave her confused you don't
[1:23:37] have to leave here under the bondage
[1:23:39] amen of anxiety or nervousness or
[1:23:41] depression or complexes listen I'm going
[1:23:44] to take a sword out right now Satan I a
[1:23:46] jury thee in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:23:49] thou demon of service problems without
[1:23:51] demon of depression I rebuke you and
[1:23:53] command you to take your hands off of
[1:23:55] the church of living God unless we
[1:23:57] entail into the Revelation or rise in
[1:24:00] this hour let God arise and his enemies
[1:24:02] be scattered
[1:24:04] we ain't got to live tore up we ain't
[1:24:07] got to live all confused biting our
[1:24:08] fingernails popping pills if you will
[1:24:11] believe then just be faithful with the
[1:24:13] little things and God will show you the
[1:24:15] great things what do you saying preacher
[1:24:17] I'm saying it's time to get up higher
[1:24:23] we'll say Well when God comes he will
[1:24:24] show us things what about John 16 13.
[1:24:28] how many when he the spirit of Truth is
[1:24:30] come he will guide you into all truth he
[1:24:33] will not speak of himself but whatsoever
[1:24:36] he shall hear that shall he speak and he
[1:24:39] will show you things to come look at
[1:24:41] this word show it means to report it
[1:24:44] means to bring back Tidings it means to
[1:24:46] rehearse
[1:24:48] I ain't got time to preach there amen
[1:24:50] when when when John said it in
[1:24:52] Revelation 4 he said I would expose to
[1:24:55] the onlooker by words and I will teach
[1:24:57] them and by teaching them I will show
[1:25:00] them things which must be Hereafter when
[1:25:02] Jesus spoke in the Book of John and said
[1:25:04] he will show you thanks to come he said
[1:25:06] in other words brother Brown said to God
[1:25:08] 62 he said other words he'll be the one
[1:25:11] somebody say the one oh say it like
[1:25:14] you're preacher with me he'll be the one
[1:25:16] he'll be the one that will reveal the
[1:25:18] thing you see so there'll be one
[1:25:21] revealer come on church and there'll be
[1:25:23] one bride receiving brother Sean what
[1:25:26] the revealer is exposing to the owner
[1:25:28] listen church amen there's been churches
[1:25:31] churches and there's been Brides brides
[1:25:33] but there's got to come one who will be
[1:25:36] bone of his bone Brother Sam shall be
[1:25:38] power of his power shall be the life of
[1:25:40] his life and a prophet walked off the
[1:25:41] scene brother Judah and said she is him
[1:25:45] among church it was not just the
[1:25:47] unveiling of the bridegroom it was the
[1:25:49] revealing of the Bride who would look at
[1:25:52] the bridegroom and would not just see
[1:25:54] him through a glass darken she would not
[1:25:56] just see him through the eyes of some
[1:25:58] denomination but she would see him as
[1:26:00] the Mighty God she would see him as the
[1:26:02] Everlasting father she would see him as
[1:26:05] the spirit of truth that has come
[1:26:09] I wish I had a whole service on that the
[1:26:11] spirit of Truth has come somebody tell
[1:26:13] you it's coming you can look at him and
[1:26:14] say you're a liar he's come
[1:26:17] the spirit of Truth is come things once
[1:26:21] hard to understand is now made plain
[1:26:24] through the astronaut do you now believe
[1:26:26] 52 Battle Creek Michigan now the world
[1:26:28] take the word and scrum it all up and I
[1:26:31] like that word scrum they'll scrum it
[1:26:33] all up thank God for a prophet right
[1:26:35] these theological seminaries and teach
[1:26:37] this philosophy and so forth in
[1:26:39] Psychology and theory and so forth and
[1:26:42] they might do that but yet one thing
[1:26:44] sure we have the Holy Spirit as a Divine
[1:26:48] witness and if that is truly the Holy
[1:26:51] Spirit then it Bears record of Christ
[1:26:53] and Christ in the spirit form come on

[1:27:05] follow some direction about forgives or
[1:27:07] some direction about this or some
[1:27:09] direction about the seventh seal the
[1:27:11] spirit of Truth has come into the church
[1:27:14] to Open the Eyes of the Eagles brother
[1:27:16] Terry there's a stepladder in the house
[1:27:19] of God it's time to climb up and look at
[1:27:21] things the way the spirit of Truth has

[1:27:28] helpless hopeless defeated and praying
[1:27:30] you go home and just die in your sleep
[1:27:32] but if you'll climb up and look to the
[1:27:34] eyes of the spirit of truth that has
[1:27:36] come into this generation it will break
[1:27:38] the crust off of your eyes yes sir and

[1:28:08] entire sermon called be on the curtain
[1:28:10] of time he will get called up in the
[1:28:12] consolation of seven angels in another
[1:28:15] dimension and he will see the revelation
[1:28:18] of the Seven Seals and he will be
[1:28:21] commissioned in the desert to return

[1:28:25] Revelation and when he comes back he
[1:28:27] will rehearse to you what the angel of
[1:28:30] God stepped into his room seven days in
[1:28:33] a row and revealed to him concerning the
[1:28:36] word in the age you're living I say oh
[1:28:38] God bring these things to our
[1:28:40] remembrance come on let's forget the
[1:28:42] prison let's forget the offenses let's
[1:28:45] forget the situations and remember the
[1:28:47] things of God he said Jesus Christ the
[1:28:49] son of God God's provided sacrifice he's
[1:28:52] God's Everlasting
[1:28:54] Eternal provided sacrifice it's provided
[1:28:57] for your sin it's provided for your

[1:29:07] Jesus died for he come to rid sin amen
[1:29:10] so you could receive it
[1:29:14] what are you saying preacher can I have
[1:29:16] a few more minutes I'm saying the Holy
[1:29:18] Spirit does not change the trend come on
[1:29:21] Jesus said when the Holy Ghost has come
[1:29:23] upon you he will show you things I've
[1:29:25] taught you I've said to you and he will
[1:29:26] show you things that is to come see our
[1:29:29] human part gets ourselves all wound up
[1:29:31] in different things and groups of men
[1:29:33] get together and votes on this and that
[1:29:35] and this is what throws us off the line
[1:29:37] he said see well this was for another
[1:29:38] day no he is the same yesterday today
[1:29:41] and forever and all somebody say all all
[1:29:45] the word is inspired all of it see then
[1:29:48] the Holy Ghost is the prophet when the
[1:29:50] Holy Ghost has come he will make those
[1:29:53] things live out right to the promise
[1:29:55] when he the spirit of Truth has come I I
[1:29:58] know I've taken a detour but I'm going
[1:30:00] back to the Forgotten be attitude okay
[1:30:01] when he the spirit of Truth has come he
[1:30:05] will live out his nature through you to
[1:30:08] the promise
[1:30:10] that's a mouthful church he will live
[1:30:12] out through you his nature to the
[1:30:15] promise in other words you'll walk like
[1:30:17] Jesus you'll talk like Jesus brother
[1:30:19] Kevin you'll love like Jesus will
[1:30:22] forgive like Jesus will be just like
[1:30:24] Jesus because the spirit of Truth which
[1:30:27] comes from Jesus has come into the
[1:30:30] church to live itself out to the promise
[1:30:32] he said the continuity of God's word
[1:30:34] God's promise God's spirit we're living
[1:30:37] in the hour We're watching the unfolding
[1:30:40] amen of the Prophecies of the age coming
[1:30:42] to pass it's a great time we're living
[1:30:44] the Holy Spirit was to show us things
[1:30:47] that is to come as the devil ever beat
[1:30:49] you up over the evidence of the Holy
[1:30:51] Ghost
[1:30:51] is anybody it's not a trick question
[1:30:54] he's beat us all up over the evidence
[1:30:56] Holy Ghost but a Prophet come in this
[1:30:58] age and he rehearsed to us what he heard
[1:31:00] from the other side and said the
[1:31:03] evidence of the Holy Ghost is he who can
[1:31:05] believe the word he who can believe that
[1:31:09] the spirit of Truth is coming to this
[1:31:12] age the people of today is choosing a
[1:31:14] modern denomination what does it do it
[1:31:16] only reflects their poor understanding
[1:31:18] of the word
[1:31:22] now come on don't get mad at me but
[1:31:24] people that choose little side side
[1:31:26] messages around this message only proves
[1:31:28] their poor understanding of Malachi 4
[1:31:31] and Revelation 10. come on don't get mad
[1:31:34] at me let's preach amen amen people get
[1:31:37] up and say well you know I think we got
[1:31:39] some answers but I think we need to
[1:31:40] preach Christ it only reflects their
[1:31:42] poor understanding of the message of the
[1:31:44] hour well they say you know what amen I
[1:31:46] don't think we need to quote brother
[1:31:47] random well we see that you're
[1:31:49] understanding is poorly given
[1:31:53] well glory to God I might need
[1:31:55] bodyguards time I get done
[1:31:57] I'm saying well you know everybody got
[1:31:59] to go this direction cause this is the
[1:32:00] brown
[1:32:02] s he had contrary to what a prophet talk
[1:32:04] I have obligation to God to say I do not
[1:32:07] have to follow your poor understanding
[1:32:09] of what the bride's Revival is I do not
[1:32:12] have to follow some man's poor
[1:32:14] understanding of preaching when the
[1:32:16] prophet's saying I have been liberated
[1:32:18] by the receiving of the spirit of truth
[1:32:21] I have been given eyes to see what has
[1:32:23] been veiled behind the cover has been
[1:32:25] ripped off in this age and I'm feeding
[1:32:28] upon the true of Thoroughly of
[1:32:30] Vindicated word in the time and season
[1:32:32] I'm living now amen I know I'm way off
[1:32:34] my subject but let me get back to it
[1:32:36] real quick he's right on schedule he's
[1:32:38] right on schedule amen God works by time
[1:32:41] in a season can you agree
[1:32:43] in Ecclesiastes 3 1 through everything
[1:32:46] somebody say everything there is a
[1:32:48] season there is a time to every purpose
[1:32:50] under the heaven remember said Jesus
[1:32:52] told his disciples I knew you before the
[1:32:55] foundation of the world before the world
[1:32:57] ever began all things was made and
[1:33:00] ordained there
[1:33:03] we are just working according to the
[1:33:06] schedule
[1:33:08] that's a powerful quote brother during
[1:33:10] all things were ordained and made there
[1:33:13] we are just working according to the
[1:33:16] schedule a schedule is a very important
[1:33:18] thing right amen all of our lives right
[1:33:21] here tonight are operated off of a
[1:33:23] schedule see if the plans or scheduled
[1:33:25] changes then so many things can be
[1:33:28] disturbed amen not now don't believe me
[1:33:30] just go to the airport and let one
[1:33:32] schedule change and tickets you've had I
[1:33:35] remember I mean one time Dave salad and
[1:33:37] I was going to Poland and on the way
[1:33:38] over there we mystify it and when we got
[1:33:40] to the airport to fly back home we
[1:33:43] didn't have no flights so because we
[1:33:45] missed one flight they took the liberty
[1:33:46] to cancel all of our flights and we had
[1:33:48] to rebook all of our flights back home
[1:33:50] see because the schedule is very
[1:33:52] important I think it's a powerful thing
[1:33:54] that when Jesus came on the earth amen
[1:33:57] he was subject to a schedule but it was
[1:34:00] not the schedule of the Pharisees it was
[1:34:02] not the schedule of this agencies he was
[1:34:05] subject to the schedule which is the
[1:34:07] will of the father he said I can say
[1:34:09] unto you the son of man can do nothing
[1:34:11] of himself but what he seeth the father
[1:34:13] do for whatsoever things he do with
[1:34:16] these also doeth the son likewise in
[1:34:18] John 5 30 he said I could have my own
[1:34:20] self do nothing as I hear I judge and my
[1:34:23] judgment is just because I seek not my
[1:34:26] own will but the will of the Father
[1:34:29] which has sent me then this harmony is
[1:34:31] to exist between the groom and the bride
[1:34:33] he shows her his Word of Life she
[1:34:36] receives it she never announced it
[1:34:38] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:34:41] death see now watch this humans then
[1:34:43] we're all humans right humans have a
[1:34:46] tendency Amen to rush God and get ahead
[1:34:49] of God's schedule
[1:34:50] out
[1:34:51] are you with me now amen amen humans
[1:34:54] have a tendency Amen to rush God and get
[1:34:58] ahead of God's schedule I love what
[1:35:00] Romans 8 28 says we know that all things
[1:35:02] work together for the good to them that
[1:35:05] love God to them who are called
[1:35:07] according to our purpose according to
[1:35:10] the church's purpose according to a
[1:35:12] group of man's purpose according to his
[1:35:15] purpose so brother Terry God's schedule
[1:35:17] is his word and his word is perfect
[1:35:21] therefore his timing is perfect now you
[1:35:24] know what a schedule is amen it means to
[1:35:27] arrange or to plan an event to take
[1:35:29] place at a particular time if you look
[1:35:32] at John's life amen God had a schedule
[1:35:34] for John's life before John's mother
[1:35:37] even consumed him or conceived her
[1:35:39] conceived him in her womb amen John was
[1:35:42] dead in the womb of Elizabeth but when
[1:35:44] he heard the name Jesus amen he leaped
[1:35:47] in his mother's womb therefore brother
[1:35:48] Graham said John was born full of the
[1:35:51] Holy Ghost at nine years old no
[1:35:53] education he went into the Wilderness as
[1:35:55] a man called of God and was a Woodsman
[1:35:58] amen now watch this he was greater than
[1:36:00] all the prophets you say why was he the
[1:36:02] greatest because the prophets and other
[1:36:04] prophets spoke of the Messiah but John
[1:36:06] introduced him all other prophets amen I
[1:36:10] hate dashes but it's getting cold up
[1:36:11] here and amen all other prophets said
[1:36:14] this is Messiah coming this is Messiah
[1:36:16] coming but when John come on the scene
[1:36:18] he said this is Messiah here in other
[1:36:21] words brother Terry he said my Ministry
[1:36:24] is to declare him he is here Amen in
[1:36:27] Matthew the third chapter you'll see
[1:36:29] that John at 30 years old begins to
[1:36:31] preach the coming of the Messiah very
[1:36:33] strong he said he was going to he was
[1:36:35] going to have a fan in his hand he said
[1:36:37] I'll know the Messiah when I see him but
[1:36:40] when trouble set in I'm preaching to you
[1:36:42] now when troubles when trouble set in
[1:36:44] amen Jesus come and sold the Messiah
[1:36:47] that he was the Messiah amen when then
[1:36:50] something went wrong and God had
[1:36:52] introduced the Messiah with the Messiah
[1:36:54] having a fan in his hand he was going to
[1:36:56] burn up a chance but he found out the
[1:36:58] works of Jesus he was meek and lowly so
[1:37:01] it worried him when did John get worried
[1:37:04] when trouble began to set in when do we
[1:37:07] get worried when trouble begins to set
[1:37:09] in he said but watch amen he didn't know
[1:37:12] what to say he thought somebody said he
[1:37:14] thought
[1:37:16] he thought amen now oh my there's
[1:37:19] something wrong here somewhere it seemed
[1:37:22] he had believed the wrong thing do you
[1:37:24] realize you never questioned this
[1:37:25] message till you get in trouble you
[1:37:28] never questioned God positionally
[1:37:30] placing you in a church or in the body
[1:37:32] of Christ until little trouble sets in
[1:37:34] upon you amen and then all of a sudden
[1:37:36] amen am I supposed to be here have I
[1:37:39] believed the right thing it seemed like
[1:37:41] it wasn't working right and there's many
[1:37:43] times we think too that it isn't working
[1:37:45] right but it's working right as long as
[1:37:48] we know he is here come on church I need
[1:37:51] some help here for a second as long as
[1:37:54] we know he is here everything is working
[1:37:58] out brother son if he's not here we
[1:38:00] might as well close the doors turn off
[1:38:02] the lights and board up for Windows but
[1:38:04] if he is here it doesn't matter who else
[1:38:07] who says who likes who don't if he is
[1:38:11] here he will walk on the face of the
[1:38:13] conditions and he will push back the
[1:38:15] devil and his children receive a
[1:38:17] blessing in the face of the devil
[1:38:20] it don't matter listen you say preacher
[1:38:22] I'm going through a lot can you say
[1:38:24] these words with me he's here
[1:38:27] brother Andrew it's getting pretty hard
[1:38:29] can you say these words with me he's
[1:38:31] here
[1:38:33] to Kim and her powerful words he's here
[1:38:35] I know them are simple words but it's a
[1:38:38] reality he's here and if he is here
[1:38:41] maybe it ain't working according to the
[1:38:43] way we thought think it ought to work
[1:38:45] out amen but it's working according to
[1:38:48] the way the word of God wants you to
[1:38:50] work now I just gotta I gotta I gotta
[1:38:53] barrel down here and preach to you for a
[1:38:54] second in John in Matthew 11 John asked
[1:38:57] two questions you know what those
[1:38:59] questions were or thou he that should
[1:39:01] come
[1:39:02] or do we look for another do you realize
[1:39:05] Satan by questioning is trying to move
[1:39:07] people from belief to disbelief so we
[1:39:10] find out there that the devil tries to
[1:39:12] make the people disbelieved so the devil
[1:39:14] was trying to get John to disbelieve he
[1:39:17] was the Messiah brother brother during
[1:39:19] when John was running through the fields
[1:39:21] eating the locusts eating the honey or
[1:39:23] they must default never crossed his mind
[1:39:25] is this he or do we look for another
[1:39:28] when he was climbing the trees Jordan
[1:39:30] and brother brother Shawn he was doing
[1:39:32] whatever he wanted to do wild and free
[1:39:34] he never had a question is he the
[1:39:37] Messiah but for very minute he got put
[1:39:39] in the prison for the ministry God
[1:39:41] called him to was the very minute that
[1:39:43] old filthy trespassing devil climbed
[1:39:46] into John's mind and began to plant
[1:39:48] questions of is this the Messiah or do
[1:39:50] we look for another one to come could I
[1:39:52] have been wrong is he really the right
[1:39:54] one I know the sign was right I see the
[1:39:56] mess sign but this meek and lowly all
[1:39:59] this I don't get it I can't figure it up
[1:40:00] I can't make ends can you hear a
[1:40:04] preacher's Heart Tonight brother bam
[1:40:06] says you're not supposed to make ends
[1:40:08] meet
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:14] and shout hallelujah oh yeah
[1:40:16] you're not supposed to make ends meet
[1:40:19] what did the Bible say trust in the Lord
[1:40:21] with all thine heart and lean not to
[1:40:25] thine own understanding what did Paul
[1:40:27] say he said we walk by faith and not by
[1:40:29] sight remember I said if I could tell
[1:40:31] you the whole thing and you know it and
[1:40:33] all then it would no longer be Faith
[1:40:35] anything I can explain to you is not
[1:40:38] Faith by faith are you saved by faith
[1:40:40] are you healed you just believe it even
[1:40:43] though you can't explain it come on
[1:40:45] church I know I don't need to preach
[1:40:47] salvation here tonight because y'all are
[1:40:49] saved I know some of y'all need healing
[1:40:51] so I'm preaching healing but I'm going
[1:40:52] to take a I'm going to take a sword to a
[1:40:54] devil and you can sit there and watch me
[1:40:56] if you want to it's a devil that says
[1:40:58] we're not going to make it with the same
[1:41:00] Faith you believe that you're saved by
[1:41:01] the same face you believe you're healed
[1:41:03] by the same Faith you believe that your
[1:41:05] children are going to be saved by it's
[1:41:08] the same Faith you need to reach over
[1:41:09] and pick up and put aside in that
[1:41:11] Devil's face and say by faith I've
[1:41:14] already made it therefore I'm not going
[1:41:16] to make it I've already made it the same
[1:41:19] Faith you believed when you were sick in
[1:41:21] the hospital it's the same Faith you
[1:41:23] need to use right now and say I still
[1:41:25] believe God is with us I still believe
[1:41:27] God is for us
[1:41:31] somebody shout hallelujah let's served
[1:41:34] the same Faith now watch this the part
[1:41:36] of God said when John was in prison he

[1:41:44] can I preach to you he never said

[1:41:50] to be happy in jail
[1:41:52] brother Amos he never sent him a book on
[1:41:55] how to behave himself in jail you know
[1:41:57] what within disciples come and they said
[1:41:59] John wants to know Roshan can have a few
[1:42:02] minutes he said John wants to know are
[1:42:04] you the one who does he look for another
[1:42:05] one remember said Jesus just looked at
[1:42:07] him for the nerd and said just go and
[1:42:10] stay till after the meeting he said
[1:42:12] after the meeting he said when the
[1:42:13] service was over he said those two
[1:42:15] disciples went back to meet John and
[1:42:18] said this amen go tell John the lame
[1:42:21] walk the blind sea the death here that
[1:42:23] all comes to the meeting is poor but the
[1:42:25] Poor People's gospel gospel preaching

[1:43:48] John

[1:43:52] but as I said before the president never
[1:43:54] lessened John can I say it to you like
[1:43:56] this John was in it was in a physical
[1:43:59] Dungey dirty damp dark jail
[1:44:04] but brother Amos greater than that he
[1:44:06] was in a prison of offense
[1:44:11] you say preacher what is that prison of
[1:44:13] the fence things did not turn out
[1:44:16] the way John
[1:44:18] thought things would turn out
[1:44:22] I'm prepared to plow here for a second
[1:44:24] closing
[1:44:25] our thoughts are not God's thoughts
[1:44:29] John thought well I've introduced a
[1:44:31] messiah that had had a fan in his hand
[1:44:33] and he's over kissing babies and over
[1:44:35] there setting them on their knees and
[1:44:36] over here
[1:44:37] meek and lowly
[1:44:39] there's something's wrong somewhere John
[1:44:41] become dismayed like many of us do he
[1:44:44] said we see things going on that isn't
[1:44:45] what we think is just right we become
[1:44:47] dismayed now listen church I'm preaching
[1:44:49] to you as a human two humans take your
[1:44:51] Halos off
[1:44:54] get mad at me if you want to but take
[1:44:56] your Halos off

[1:45:01] be all right the devil got a hold of him
[1:45:03] in there and the devil fault now I've
[1:45:06] got him in jail I've thrown him in jail
[1:45:08] I'll rough him up right good while he's
[1:45:10] in here God isn't using him right now
[1:45:12] I've got him where I want him all cased
[1:45:14] up is equal I can't see I'll just make
[1:45:17] him wish he had never preached the
[1:45:18] gospel
[1:45:20] come on Church how quick in the prison
[1:45:23] of a fence did John trade off the fault
[1:45:25] of this is the Messiah this is the one
[1:45:28] to come and brother Terry he received
[1:45:30] the thoughts of the devil that I wish I
[1:45:32] had never even preached the gospel he
[1:45:34] said that's the way he does many and
[1:45:35] there's many a good man in the same
[1:45:37] shape today that's exactly right we
[1:45:39] think it ain't working right but it is
[1:45:40] working right everything's all right
[1:45:42] come on church amen everything is all
[1:45:46] right
[1:45:49] I said everything is all right I said
[1:45:53] everything is all right I said I know

[1:45:58] everything gonna be all right the spirit
[1:46:00] of Truth has come he's come across he's
[1:46:04] already been on the other side of your
[1:46:06] child he's already been on the other
[1:46:08] side of the prison's hell he knows it's
[1:46:11] gonna be okay you got to receive the
[1:46:14] spirit of Truth and look at it the way
[1:46:16] he's revealed it to look at
[1:46:20] John
[1:46:21] oh my John was offended
[1:46:25] it now
[1:46:29] I'm going to deliver this and I'm done
[1:46:32] foreign
[1:46:33] said there's more people offended in
[1:46:35] Jesus
[1:46:37] than any other person that lived on the
[1:46:41] Earth
[1:46:44] they get offended too quick
[1:46:47] but Jesus in this misplaced beatitude
[1:46:51] slipped over there so we could get it
[1:46:54] tonight and he said these words
[1:46:58] blessed is he who has not offended to me
[1:47:01] don't be offended in me no matter what
[1:47:04] takes place
[1:47:07] everything's working right on schedule

[1:47:16] everything's all right just go ahead and
[1:47:19] believe it can I preach something to you
[1:47:20] God show you something Jesus never
[1:47:23] rebuked John
[1:47:25] Quinn come on church when John said the
[1:47:28] worst thing he could say to Jesus
[1:47:31] Jesus brother Duren turned around and
[1:47:34] said the greatest thing he could have
[1:47:36] said about John come on Jesus comes in
[1:47:38] town for a meeting and those two
[1:47:40] disciples run over there with John's
[1:47:42] questions pregnated by the devil's
[1:47:44] thoughts and says are you the Messiah or
[1:47:46] do we look for another one to come and
[1:47:48] Jesus never lost his temper well I might
[1:47:51] as well preach that Jesus never got all
[1:47:53] wadded up and said listen here you two
[1:47:55] wanna bees if you want about oh no Jesus
[1:47:58] said now listen y'all just have your
[1:47:59] seat right there and you enjoy the
[1:48:01] meeting and when the meeting's over you
[1:48:03] go tell John what you see and when Jesus
[1:48:06] manifested The Works of the father those
[1:48:09] two disciples took off from him come on
[1:48:11] Church Jesus had just received the worst
[1:48:14] things
[1:48:17] Jesus just received the worst words he
[1:48:20] could have received from his own
[1:48:22] Forerunner and his name was John and
[1:48:25] Jesus never turned around and said now
[1:48:27] you go tell John that oh sorry that oh
[1:48:30] sorry church member I wish I'd have
[1:48:32] never chose him I wish I'd never invest
[1:48:34] nothing in him Jesus said you go tell
[1:48:36] John and while the disciples was running
[1:48:38] to bring word to John Jesus turned
[1:48:41] around and took up for John and John was
[1:48:44] offended at Jesus but Jesus never let
[1:48:47] John's offenses change the way he
[1:48:49] thought about John
[1:48:51] come on church I close by saying this
[1:48:53] Jesus had ever right to say John I don't
[1:48:56] know this but Jesus turned around and he
[1:48:58] said some of y'all come out here and
[1:49:00] you're looking for this and you're
[1:49:01] looking for that amen but John there's
[1:49:04] never been a greater one than John the
[1:49:06] Baptist while John was still in prison
[1:49:10] for the whole church we ought to put our
[1:49:12] shop and shoes on right now because
[1:49:14] every single one of us oldest to

[1:49:48] right around and blessed me he turned
[1:49:50] right around and healed me he turned
[1:49:52] right around and renewed my vision and
[1:49:55] put me back up in the heavenlies where I
[1:49:57] could see things the way all the sin I

[2:05:25] it's already done
[2:05:29] you know isn't it astounding as they
[2:05:31] play that Softly hitting it astounding
[2:05:34] that the prophet of God said
[2:05:35] the most offended person that people are
[2:05:38] offended at is Jesus
[2:05:41] well Ashanti didn't say the most
[2:05:42] defended people his wives or husbands or
[2:05:46] kids or grandchildren or
[2:05:48] her cousins or bosses or School teachers
[2:05:52] he said the most defended person is
[2:05:55] Jesus he said he's more offended that
[2:05:57] than anybody
[2:05:58] think about that the person you would
[2:06:02] think you would never be offended at is
[2:06:05] the one that a prophet identified
[2:06:07] is the one that receives the most
[2:06:10] negative treatment over situations
[2:06:15] but I got to thinking today bro Tim
[2:06:16] brother but I'm told about that woman
[2:06:18] overthink it was in Germany or Finland
[2:06:20] somewhere he said her baby died
[2:06:23] and he said she said now if you'll get
[2:06:25] brother Branham to come over here and
[2:06:27] pray for my baby said the Lord will heal
[2:06:29] that baby and he'll he'll live he said I
[2:06:31] believe it
[2:06:32] said they had the helicopters ready they
[2:06:35] had the military ready they had
[2:06:36] everything ready to fly me over there
[2:06:38] and he said all of a sudden I was
[2:06:40] praying and he said the Lord spoke to me
[2:06:42] and said call the woman tell her to bury
[2:06:45] the child it's of me and go on
[2:06:49] said to our old baby and I picked up the
[2:06:52] phone I called her the lady I said sis
[2:06:54] God spoke to me said have you buried the
[2:06:56] child it's of him we just got to go on
[2:06:58] and trust him about two years later
[2:07:00] brother they ran into that woman or
[2:07:02] received a letter from her
[2:07:04] but Tim that woman asked for the ram she
[2:07:06] said brother Brandon she said I believed
[2:07:08] if you would come and pray for that baby
[2:07:09] it'd raise up and live
[2:07:11] it was everything was and brother
[2:07:13] Brandon will you just tell me that I not
[2:07:15] have faith
[2:07:17] that I'm not have faith
[2:07:20] oh no sis
[2:07:22] he said you had great faith
[2:07:25] he said great faith he said yeah he said
[2:07:28] because God said no and you still
[2:07:30] trusted him
[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:37] God said no and you still
[2:07:40] God said no and for two years you've
[2:07:43] continued to serve him and praise him
[2:07:45] and bless his name and be good to his
[2:07:47] children and go to church
[2:07:49] you still testified God's A Healer
[2:07:53] friends I don't know about you but
[2:07:54] that's the kind of faith I want
[2:07:57] that much she had every reason to get
[2:07:59] all watered up at God
[2:08:01] unless God I'll tell you one thing see
[2:08:02] if I ever go back to see if I ever read
[2:08:04] my Bible again see if I ever say brother
[2:08:06] [Music]
[2:08:08] but great faith
[2:08:10] great faith knows that no matter what
[2:08:12] the conditions are God is right on time

[2:08:19] pray something was said to bless you

[2:08:23] it was a help I pray you can see that
[2:08:26] God sent a prophet in this age

[2:09:42] bless his name I think we ought to thank
[2:09:44] him for giving us a smile when we have
[2:09:46] every reason to frown I think we ought
[2:09:48] to thank him for giving us peace in the
[2:09:51] midst of the storm I think we ought to
[2:09:52] bless the god who is the god that's been
[2:09:55] more offended after anybody but he never
[2:09:57] let the offenses change the way he
[2:09:59] thought about it she never let the

[2:18:33] and good to have uh brother Josiah back
[2:18:37] brother Amos and trust their services
[2:18:40] went well
[2:18:42] but I had forgot to put this request in
[2:18:45] and brother Amos may have done it
[2:18:47] already but a brother
[2:18:48] uh Pastor that he had met a Ukrainian
[2:18:52] brother
[2:18:53] uh there his wife
[2:18:55] [Music]
[2:18:57] um has been diagnosed with cancer I
[2:19:00] believe and in pretty bad shape and so
[2:19:04] he is having to take care of her Plus
[2:19:07] work plus pastor and and just a lot of
[2:19:10] things there but we certainly know that
[2:19:13] God Is A Healer and this this brother as
[2:19:17] far as I know is a not in the message
[2:19:19] he's a Pentecostal brother but brother
[2:19:21] Amos has been speaking to him working
[2:19:24] with him there and I believe he's in
[2:19:26] Pennsylvania and so we want to just keep
[2:19:29] this brother and and and and his wife in
[2:19:33] our prayer at the Lord will just touch
[2:19:36] her heal her raise her up as a testimony
[2:19:39] of his healing power amen so God bless
[2:19:43] you is our prayer and let's just buy our
[2:19:47] heads
