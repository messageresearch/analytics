[38:45] So we want to look at uh Mark the uh 7th
[38:51] chapter and um we'd read this I believe
[38:55] last Wednesday but I want to read it
[38:58] again the 25th verse. For a certain
[39:01] woman whose young daughter had an
[39:03] unclean spirit heard of him and came and
[39:08] fell at his feet.
[39:11] The woman was a Greek, a sir sir
[39:15] Phoenician by nation, and she besought
[39:19] him that he would cast forth the devil
[39:22] out of her daughter. Now we know he had
[39:24] the power to do that, right?
[39:27] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said unto her, "Let the
[39:29] children first be filled, for it is not
[39:32] meat to take the children's bread and
[39:35] cast it unto the dogs."
[39:38] And she said, she answered and said unto
[39:41] him, "Yes, Lord, or truth, Lord."
[39:45] Yet the dogs under the table eat of the
[39:48] children's crumbs.
[39:50] And he said unto her, "For this thing,
[39:54] go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy
[39:57] daughter."
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when she was come to her
[40:01] house, she found the devil gone out, and
[40:04] her daughter laid upon the bed.
[40:07] You can have your seats this evening.
[40:11] And
[40:12] I guess if I were to title
[40:15] uh this would be cherishing the word
[40:19] that you have received.
[40:22] And um this came to me the other day. Um
[40:28] uh this quote was posted on the
[40:30] minister's chat and um it's uh brother
[40:35] Brandham says now we are supposed to be
[40:38] Abraham's seed. How many believes that?
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not just a Christian but
[40:44] you're identified in the Bible. Amen.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Every true elect of God is identified in
[40:52] the Bible as Abraham's seed. So
[40:55] Abraham's seed still lives today.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Now we're supposed to be
[41:01] Abraham's seed spiritually speaking,
[41:03] being in Christ." Notice, we should take
[41:07] a hold of every promise of God
[41:10] &gt;&gt; and cherish it
[41:12] &gt;&gt; as though it was already done.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; For when God has spoken, he can never,
[41:19] everybody say, he can never
[41:21] &gt;&gt; take it back. Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; So, as the seed of Abraham,
[41:26] we are to take a hold of every promise
[41:29] of God and cherish it.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; As though it is already done.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Now, I looked up this word cherish. It
[41:39] means to hold dear,
[41:42] feel, or show affection for.
[41:45] So, uh uh this is what brother Bram is
[41:48] saying about cherishing the promises of
[41:51] God to hold them dear
[41:55] &gt;&gt; to have a feeling for and affection for
[42:01] &gt;&gt; to entertain
[42:03] &gt;&gt; to harbor in the mind deeply and
[42:06] resolutely. Ain't that right?
[42:09] &gt;&gt; So now we are to cherish it. You cherish
[42:12] something because you value it.
[42:15] Uh uh the word of God is a treasure to
[42:18] the believer. Uh God gave us his word
[42:23] because he treasures it
[42:25] &gt;&gt; and he expects us to treasure it just as
[42:28] well.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; And and so it's it's invaluable. The
[42:33] word of God. I can't I can't explain
[42:35] that enough. We can't tell it enough.
[42:38] This word of God is invaluable.
[42:42] And to the to the unbeliever, it has no
[42:45] value at all. To the unconverted man, he
[42:49] sees no value to it. It's just a book of
[42:53] rules, dos and don'ts. It's just a code
[42:57] of ethics. Um a book of morals. Um uh
[43:02] some have uh you know I I believe I've
[43:05] uh stated you know that men have studied
[43:09] this Bible and actually have become
[43:11] wealthy by the principles of it.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Um doctors have have uh learned many
[43:21] things in the medical field just simply
[43:24] uh studying this Bible.
[43:27] Dieticians
[43:29] &gt;&gt; uh have become effective by just
[43:32] studying the principles of the Bible.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Military men have have studied the Bible
[43:39] of of wars and things like that and have
[43:42] by their study uh and applying the
[43:45] principles have actually won wars simply
[43:49] of of their study of the Bible. Th this
[43:52] Bible is is is is one of the greatest um
[43:57] uh is the greatest uh holds the greatest
[44:01] information that a man could have is the
[44:05] Bible. Ain't that right? But but we also
[44:08] find that because men have not
[44:11] considered the Bible to be much uh they
[44:15] have misjudged
[44:17] uh things by not looking at what God uh
[44:22] God's word said about it. U nations have
[44:26] done the same thing. uh you know uh uh
[44:30] the brother Bram would talk about it how
[44:32] about you know there were valuable
[44:34] things and places that were at one time
[44:38] considered to be insignificant
[44:41] are now seen as something valuable like
[44:44] the Dead Sea. It was at one time
[44:46] considered to be waste and no value in
[44:49] it at all. But they have now figured and
[44:53] and discovered that the Dead Sea holds
[44:57] more wealth than anything in the world.
[45:00] It's it's the Dead Sea. And so uh
[45:03] England uh once was in possession of of
[45:08] some land in the Middle East. Uh that
[45:12] land was barren. It was dry, rocky,
[45:15] desert. uh just to them it was just
[45:20] wasteland but they owned it and because
[45:23] they saw no value in it they they gave
[45:27] it away to the Arabs and and so brother
[45:31] Brandham said see they didn't see what
[45:34] the Bible had to say about it
[45:36] &gt;&gt; see if they would have studied the Bible
[45:38] if they would have seen what the Bible
[45:40] said about it they would have held it as
[45:43] valuable
[45:44] &gt;&gt; uh and so the Bible Ible says that that
[45:47] land would would blossom like a rose and
[45:49] would bring forth her abundance. Brother
[45:52] Bradom said England even made a vital
[45:54] mistake by giving back India her rights.
[45:58] See, so they don't realize um uh these
[46:02] things because they don't re read the
[46:04] Bible. They don't they don't study the
[46:06] Bible. The they they only study maybe
[46:09] what they want and what they're after.
[46:11] And but but the whole Bible is full of
[46:14] information and and it's it's uh brother
[46:17] Bram says now if if that be true amongst
[46:20] nations where they they they
[46:24] uh see no value in things because they
[46:27] don't study the Bible uh and see what
[46:30] the Bible has to say about things. Uh
[46:33] how much more is it amongst mankind
[46:36] tonight who do not value value their
[46:40] life day by day to read the Bible and
[46:44] see what God has laid in his word for
[46:47] every man. Ain't that right? See your
[46:51] your life is written in the Bible. Amen.
[46:54] And what God says about you and what God
[46:57] intends and and all of this thing. See,
[47:00] the only way you you'll misvalue about
[47:03] yourself as as nations misval uh uh uh
[47:08] well, like like I say, they they they
[47:10] didn't see the value of the Dead Sea for
[47:12] a long time. They didn't see the value
[47:14] in in the Holy Land and and all around
[47:17] them places. Well, you'll never see the
[47:19] value in yourself until you read the
[47:22] Bible to see what God says uh about you.
[47:25] Ain't that right? That's the only way to
[47:27] see value in yourself. and and uh is is
[47:30] to study God's word. Amen. See, well,
[47:34] you know what what what does the the
[47:37] Bible why is the Bible so valuable? What
[47:40] what does it have? Well, first of all,
[47:43] Jesus says, "Heaven and earth shall not
[47:46] pass away." Everybody say, "Heaven and
[47:48] earth shall not pass away, but my word
[47:53] will never pass away." Ain't that right?
[47:56] So, you know, uh, uh, Brother Bran was,
[47:59] uh, uh, quoting that, uh, the the the
[48:01] preacher, the the gentleman, uh, that
[48:03] said, "I would rather I would rather be
[48:06] standing on God's word than standing in
[48:08] heaven." And someone asked him, "Well,
[48:10] why is that? Why why wouldn't you want
[48:12] to stand in heaven?" He said, "Well,
[48:13] because heaven and earth going to pass
[48:14] away, but God's word will never pass
[48:17] away." So, he says, "I'm better off to
[48:19] stand on the word of God, knowing that
[48:21] it'll never fail." Ain't that right? And
[48:24] so every word in this Bible is going to
[48:28] come to pass. How many believes that?
[48:30] And now church, it's going to come to
[48:32] pass. It is coming to pass. It has come
[48:35] to pass. You you can study world
[48:38] history. You can study and and and and
[48:41] compare it with Bible prophecy and you
[48:44] can tell that this Bible is or has had
[48:47] everything has been conducted by the
[48:50] Bible. Can you say amen? Amen. So, uh uh
[48:55] then if if every word in the Bible is
[48:58] going to come to pass, then this makes
[49:01] every word of God a promise. It isn't
[49:04] God wishing it to happen. Uh God uh
[49:08] thinking about it and don't know or or
[49:11] God just saying a by word and let a word
[49:13] slip here and there and uh going to
[49:16] retract that. Every word is a promise.
[49:19] It will happen. It shall be. Amen. As he
[49:23] has said it. Do you believe that? Amen.
[49:26] Well, then if there is something hanging
[49:28] on to you and that this Bible has not
[49:33] ascribed to you, then that thing is
[49:36] temporal. Ain't that right? Amen.
[49:39] Anything that is is is hanging on to us
[49:43] that this Bible has not obscribed to us
[49:47] and has not imputed to us, then it's
[49:50] it's it's temporal. It's not here to
[49:53] stay. Ain't that right? For only God's
[49:57] promises are yay and amen.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; God's word is eternal. Do you believe
[50:04] that? So, there are things about us that
[50:07] are subject to change. And we all know
[50:09] this. Amen. Subject to change. Uh uh
[50:12] because um uh because there's things
[50:15] about the word of God that is not uh uh
[50:21] uh uh there's things about us that the
[50:23] word of God does not abscribe. I was
[50:26] bound for hell at one time, but that was
[50:29] subject to change because the word of
[50:32] God never ascribed that to me. That
[50:35] wasn't my destination. Ain't that right?
[50:38] See, I was a sinner, but that was
[50:41] subject to change because the word of
[50:43] God never imputed that to me. It never
[50:47] subscribed to me. So that that to me. So
[50:51] sickness is subject to change.
[50:53] Depression is subject to change. Anxiety
[50:57] is subject to change. You understand
[50:59] what I'm saying? Amen. uh um uh um um
[51:03] you know uh uh uh temper is subject to
[51:06] change. Drug addiction is subject to
[51:09] change because there's nothing in the
[51:12] word of God that imputes that to me.
[51:16] Amen. See, I have been predestinated to
[51:19] be conformed into the image of God's
[51:22] son. I have been predestinated unto the
[51:26] adoption of sons. I have been
[51:29] predestinated. Amen. To go in a rapture,
[51:32] to be Can you say amen? To partake of
[51:35] the marriage supper of the lamb and and
[51:37] to be in the millennium. And so what
[51:40] things that I started out with did not
[51:44] uh uh uh fit with the pattern of God's
[51:46] word. So them weren't God's promises to
[51:49] me. So they had to change in order to
[51:52] make God's word fit.
[51:56] That's right. to give way to God's word,
[51:58] to give room to God's word. Ain't that
[52:01] right? So then you find out, amen, uh uh
[52:05] uh what what the word says about you
[52:08] because it's the word of God that's
[52:10] going to prosper. It's the word of God
[52:13] that's going to accomplish that which
[52:15] God sent it to do. Ain't that right? So
[52:19] So we find that the word started out in
[52:22] the beginning as a thought of God. Amen.
[52:26] And and then God expressed his thought
[52:29] by speaking it. And the thought became a
[52:32] word. See, and and and so you cannot say
[52:36] a word uh uh without it being in the
[52:39] your mind. Amen. And and it becomes a
[52:42] thought. Amen. And and then it becomes a
[52:45] word. But God's word is premeditated
[52:48] thoughts. There's words that you might
[52:50] just say off the cuff and and it just
[52:52] enters and and you say it unconsciously,
[52:55] but yet it had to be a thought first.
[52:57] But then there are are thoughts that you
[52:59] premeditate. You you think about and you
[53:02] you fred over or or uh uh you're happy
[53:06] about and but you're meditating on these
[53:09] thoughts and before long they develop in
[53:12] words. Ain't that right? Amen. See, and
[53:15] so God thought it. Amen. And then he
[53:18] expressed his word by speaking it. And
[53:21] that thought became a a word. Ain't that
[53:25] right? So the word that that God spoke
[53:28] in the beginning, Amen. is no different
[53:31] than uh what true prophets speak.
[53:34] Prophets do not speak anything than what
[53:37] God has already spoken. Amen. for the
[53:40] prophet said God has let them prophets
[53:43] see foresee what God spoke in the
[53:46] beginning. Amen. See, they they uh uh
[53:49] they're only catching the the thoughts
[53:51] of God, the word of God, uh uh that he
[53:54] had spoke in the beginning. For in the
[53:57] beginning, God knew everything that
[53:59] would ever be from the very first
[54:02] beginning. Ain't that right? So then it
[54:05] shows that God is of one mind. Amen.
[54:08] Whether he it was him alone with his
[54:11] thoughts and then he expressed the word
[54:14] or whether it's him coming down in in
[54:16] the prophets and anointing them to speak
[54:19] the word. Amen. He's still speaking the
[54:22] same thing. What he spoke in the
[54:24] beginning, he's still speaking today.
[54:26] Can you say amen? He's always spoke. So
[54:29] he has never changed his mind. He's
[54:31] never changing and progressing and and
[54:34] all of these things and and and and
[54:36] changing his plan. He's of one mind. And
[54:40] so it proves that the word of God is
[54:43] eternal.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? God's word will never
[54:46] change because God cannot change. Ain't
[54:49] that right? So then we find Brother
[54:52] Brandon would say this. Amen. You are
[54:54] the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the
[54:58] son of the living God. Every man and
[55:01] woman that's born of the spirit and
[55:03] washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and
[55:05] believes every word of God stands as
[55:07] though you never sinned at the first
[55:09] place. You are perfect. Well, how did he
[55:12] get that? He picked it up. God had
[55:15] already spoke you and and spoke your and
[55:17] said you're perfect before the
[55:19] foundation of the world. And a prophet
[55:21] wasn't just some saying something new
[55:23] about you. He was just picking up what
[55:26] God said about you. Amen. and declaring
[55:29] it to you again and showing that no
[55:32] matter how steeped in sin you were and
[55:34] how scarred you are, it never changed
[55:37] God's thoughts about you, it never
[55:39] changed God's word about you. Can you
[55:42] say amen? Amen. God ain't just seeing
[55:44] you as a sinner. And then for the first
[55:46] time, Amen. since you come to him and
[55:49] and you gave your heart to him, now he's
[55:51] seeing you as virtuous, sinless bride.
[55:53] No, he's always saw you as the sinless,
[55:56] virtuous bride. Amen. It's an eternal
[55:59] word. Can you say amen? So this today is
[56:02] not a progression of word for you. It's
[56:06] just it's on forever. Oh Lord, the
[56:08] psalmist said, "Thy word is settled in
[56:12] heaven."
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, and so he the
[56:16] prophet was only saying what God had
[56:18] already said at the beginning. Notice
[56:21] another place he says, "You're standing
[56:23] completely. You never sinned at the
[56:25] first place." God don't even know. God
[56:29] don't even know. It's in the sea of
[56:32] forgetfulness. You never did it. You
[56:34] were accused of it.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Your your accuser,
[56:39] Satan, was trying to uh uh put your sins
[56:42] and get God to dwell on your sins and
[56:45] get God to look at you as a sinner, as a
[56:48] hopeless case, as a as a a a basket
[56:51] case. But he could never do it. Amen.
[56:54] And God would send a prophet in this
[56:56] age. Amen. And catch him up in the rim
[56:59] of the spiritual realm to catch what he
[57:02] has already spoke about you. You are
[57:05] standing completely. You never sinned in
[57:07] the first place. God don't even know.
[57:10] It's in the sea of forgetfulness. You
[57:12] never did it.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; You were accused of it by the accuser.
[57:17] But really from the beginning, you were
[57:19] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[57:22] of God. understanding their wars and
[57:25] your old book of divorcement is put
[57:27] away. It's dead. Absolutely out of
[57:30] existence. Even in the mind of God,
[57:34] you're the virtuous bride of Christ,
[57:36] washed in the blood of Christ, precious,
[57:39] virtuous, sinless son of uh son of God,
[57:42] standing with the pure, unadulterated
[57:45] word, bride, that he washed by the water
[57:48] of his own blood and became flesh and
[57:51] manifested, that he might take you which
[57:54] were predestinated in the bosom of the
[57:56] father before the beginning the same as
[57:59] he was. Can you say amen? The word of
[58:03] God is eternal.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "And anything that
[58:11] God says is a signed document."
[58:16] &gt;&gt; I think that's pretty good.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Anything that God says, it's a signed
[58:21] document.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; There's no arguing about it.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; There's no debate about it.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; It's done.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:31] Now if you notice what he says
[58:33] everything that God is worth
[58:39] &gt;&gt; how many sees value in him
[58:42] &gt;&gt; huh
[58:44] &gt;&gt; human dialect can't even even can't even
[58:48] begin
[58:50] &gt;&gt; to comprehend the value of God
[58:53] &gt;&gt; and here's the prophet saying everything
[58:55] that God is worth and everything that
[58:58] God is is behind Find that word.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; The value
[59:07] he says the words in this Bible will
[59:09] expel either life or death to us
[59:13] &gt;&gt; in this is a pardon
[59:15] &gt;&gt; for our sins.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; To those who believe that they are
[59:19] forgiven of sin.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; How many believes you're forgiven of
[59:22] sin?
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Now, now church, if you're forgiven,
[59:25] don't wrestle with it no more.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Don't wrestle with your past. Don't
[59:29] wrestle with your mistakes. Don't
[59:30] wrestle with what I should have done,
[59:32] could have done, ought to have done. All
[59:34] of these things. If you believe, amen,
[59:37] that your sins are forgiven, the
[59:39] wrestling is over.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[59:44] &gt;&gt; It's healing to those who can receive it
[59:46] as healing.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; It's salvation to those who who can
[59:51] receive it as salvation. It's
[59:53] deliverance to those who will receive it
[59:55] in that way. Brother Bram says, "The
[59:57] promise of the Holy Ghost is an
[59:59] assurance to you that you'll get it if
[1:00:02] you receive it that way."
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? It's a promise.
[1:00:07] Healing is a promise. Salvation is a
[1:00:09] promise. Deliverance is a promise. The
[1:00:12] Holy Ghost is a promise. It's a promise.
[1:00:15] Amen. He promised it to guarantee you
[1:00:18] that you will get it if you'll receive
[1:00:20] it at that way. I'm not receiving as an
[1:00:23] opinion of God's. I'm not receiving
[1:00:26] healing as just some wish of God's. It's
[1:00:28] a promise and I receive it that way.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that any man has to be
[1:00:35] tormented and bound by the devil.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; I I get it. We go through trials, but
[1:00:40] you don't have to be tormented and bound
[1:00:42] by the devil.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; We go through things, but you don't have
[1:00:45] to be tormented. Amen. And bound. See, a
[1:00:48] person can have peace if they will just
[1:00:51] accept it as their peace. A person can
[1:00:54] have joy if they would just accept it as
[1:00:57] their joy.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; See now, but the word of God will only
[1:01:05] be good to you if you'll just receive it
[1:01:08] in that way.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Every promise of God
[1:01:13] is at your uh disposal. I think that's
[1:01:16] right. It's at your fingertips. It's
[1:01:18] it's yours. It's in your grasp if you'll
[1:01:21] receive it that way. every promise. Can
[1:01:24] you say amen? Amen. That's right. See,
[1:01:26] so therefore, it depends on a person's
[1:01:29] attitude toward the word of God. Now,
[1:01:32] Jesus tells us that his word is spirit
[1:01:35] and life. So, so it's not a dead letter.
[1:01:39] It's it's not as as though you would you
[1:01:42] would read uh some western book and and
[1:01:45] and and you know uh uh I like reading
[1:01:48] western and and and if he's a good
[1:01:50] writer you know he can he can take you
[1:01:52] in the back uh back in history and and
[1:01:55] before you know it your mind is drifting
[1:01:57] in the back you know back in the days
[1:01:59] gone by and and the roads are dusty and
[1:02:02] and the tumble weeds are rolling down
[1:02:04] the roads and and uh you know the old
[1:02:07] horse Betsy you know is getting along
[1:02:09] and there's cattle, thousands of cattle.
[1:02:11] I mean, if he paints the picture just
[1:02:13] right, amen, you find yourself in in
[1:02:16] there in the book and and you're seeing
[1:02:18] yourself in there. But it's only a book.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to bring that to you.
[1:02:23] Soon as you get out of that book and it
[1:02:25] says the end, you're back in electric
[1:02:27] cars and you're back into this and
[1:02:29] you're back into that. You're back with
[1:02:30] troubles and you're back with this and
[1:02:32] there ain't no guns right on your hip.
[1:02:35] Ain't no tumble weeds and and all of
[1:02:37] these things. See, but but see, it's
[1:02:39] it's a dead letter. It's just something
[1:02:41] that that it it begins and and just a
[1:02:44] few pages, then it ends. And then you
[1:02:46] got to go find you another book, maybe a
[1:02:48] a book about a lawyer, uh uh uh trying
[1:02:51] to win a case and and and you get
[1:02:53] wrapped up in that book if he's a good
[1:02:55] writer, you know, but but then we find
[1:02:57] out, but this book, amen, has no end
[1:03:00] because his word is spirit and they are
[1:03:04] life.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? This book fits with
[1:03:08] all generations. It fits for the for the
[1:03:10] eldest in this building and it fits for
[1:03:12] the youngest in this building. It fits
[1:03:14] for every trial that you're going
[1:03:16] through. It fits for you because his
[1:03:19] word is spirit and they are life. Ain't
[1:03:23] that right? So the prophet said, see the
[1:03:26] spirit lays in the word and life lays in
[1:03:29] the word. The spirit lays in the word
[1:03:32] and life lays in the word. So, Brother
[1:03:34] Brham says, "If you want a church, now
[1:03:36] listen. If you want a church, start with
[1:03:39] the word of God. If you want a life of
[1:03:42] God, start with the word of God. Accept
[1:03:45] the word in its fullness, every measure
[1:03:48] of it. And if that is the fullness of
[1:03:51] God in you, then the rain that's afallen
[1:03:54] will produce exactly what's in your
[1:03:57] garden." In other words, if the word of
[1:03:59] God is in you, you have received the
[1:04:02] word of God as a promise, then the rain
[1:04:04] that is fallen upon you is going to
[1:04:07] produce every promise that you have
[1:04:09] placed in your garden.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; We know that the word is a seed. Ain't
[1:04:16] that right?
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; As we've talked about it, you know it.
[1:04:20] The word is a seed. Therefore, it has to
[1:04:23] fall in the ground. That's been prepared
[1:04:27] beforehand.
[1:04:29] And uh sometimes uh Sister Kim during
[1:04:32] the Sunday school lessons will give uh
[1:04:35] the children a a seed, a mustard seed or
[1:04:38] a certain seed, you know, and they're
[1:04:41] excited. It's all in a bag, little bitty
[1:04:44] seeds, and they want to plant it. And
[1:04:46] then you start you plant it, you know,
[1:04:47] and then you you you bur it in that in
[1:04:50] the ground in that dirt and then you
[1:04:52] water it and then you start seeing
[1:04:56] product. You you start seeing some life
[1:04:59] come out of that dirt because the life
[1:05:01] was in the seed all along.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; There was something there. Quickening
[1:05:05] power was in that seed. Amen. It just
[1:05:09] needed to be buried in some dirt ground.
[1:05:12] Amen. for it to be transformed from seed
[1:05:15] to reality of what it truly is.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Well, the word of God
[1:05:21] is a seed that if it can be received,
[1:05:25] Amen. in the human heart, ain't that
[1:05:27] right? The seed has to fall into ground
[1:05:31] that's been prepared beforehand. The
[1:05:33] prophet said, Amen. in order for the
[1:05:36] seed to bring forth what it is. He said
[1:05:39] if you sowed seed, just throwed it out
[1:05:41] there on the ground, it would do no
[1:05:43] good. The birds would pick it up. You
[1:05:45] throw it among the thistles and thorns,
[1:05:47] it'll choke it out pretty soon. See? But
[1:05:49] now notice what Paul would say to the
[1:05:51] church. First Thessalonians 2 and 13.
[1:05:55] For this cause also uh uh thank we God
[1:06:00] without ceasing. Because when you
[1:06:02] received the word of God, which you
[1:06:05] heard of us, you received it not as the
[1:06:09] word of men, but as it is in truth, the
[1:06:13] word of God, which now now which
[1:06:17] effectively workketh in you also that
[1:06:21] believe. Can you say amen? It was
[1:06:23] working in Paul. And now Paul had a a a
[1:06:27] a bookload of seeds, amen, that he was
[1:06:31] distributing out by preaching the
[1:06:32] gospel. Amen. And there was some people
[1:06:35] there, amen, that was catching that
[1:06:37] seed. Amen. And they received it not as
[1:06:40] a Paul, but they received it as the word
[1:06:43] of God. Amen. And he says, "Now I see
[1:06:46] that you have received it. I see that
[1:06:49] you've accepted it because I see it
[1:06:51] working effectively in you. Now it's
[1:06:53] it's it's no longer just seeds of words,
[1:06:56] but it's becoming a reality. Can you say
[1:06:59] amen? Amen. That's what the word of God
[1:07:01] does to us. If you can receive it, Amen.
[1:07:04] and and receive it for what it is, the
[1:07:07] word of God, it'll effectively work in
[1:07:10] you.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brown says, "When really in
[1:07:16] your heart you accept the word of God,
[1:07:17] it becomes positive."
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; When you accept the word of God in your
[1:07:25] heart, it becomes positive. No matter no
[1:07:28] matter what the rest of them is seeing,
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; you're seeing it anyhow.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Except the word of God and it becomes
[1:07:38] positive.
[1:07:40] Everybody else may be wrestling with it.
[1:07:42] Everybody else may not be seeing what
[1:07:44] the word is really saying, but you'll
[1:07:46] see it.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. because you've accepted it in your
[1:07:50] heart.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Now he says, "Now, and Abraham believed
[1:07:54] God and it was imputed unto him for
[1:07:57] righteousness."
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Another place. Now Abraham wasn't afraid
[1:08:02] to put his to work. Are you?
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; He wasn't afraid to put his faith to
[1:08:09] work.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Are you
[1:08:13] on? The same faith that he gave Abraham,
[1:08:16] he gives it to you freely.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say this. You can't have
[1:08:21] faith without God giving it to you.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; But listen, it all depends on our
[1:08:28] approach of the word.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; It all depends how valuable we see the
[1:08:32] word.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Because it's the word that gives the
[1:08:36] faith. Faith cometh by what?
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Hearing and hearing by the word.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; So we can say, "Oh God, give me faith.
[1:08:42] faith, faith, faith, faith. Oh, just
[1:08:44] give me faith, faith, faith. And then
[1:08:45] the promises are being uh preached and
[1:08:47] we're just, oh, well, I just don't know.
[1:08:49] I just ain't Oh, I just I just I I just
[1:08:51] don't see myself there. Well, you cannot
[1:08:54] accept the faith that is trying to give
[1:08:56] you.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; God gives us the faith through the the
[1:08:58] the the hearing of the word.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Now, now, so uh uh so he freely gives to
[1:09:04] you if you use it.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. Abraham
[1:09:09] wasn't afraid to put his to work. Are
[1:09:11] you the same faith that he gave to
[1:09:13] Abraham, he freely gives it to you if
[1:09:16] you'll use it. Say, I have a gun. It'll
[1:09:19] shoot. It's a good shooting, you know,
[1:09:21] good, true shooting gun. I hang it up on
[1:09:24] the wall and I say, "Oh, yeah, sure. I
[1:09:26] got a gun." Well, what you going to do
[1:09:27] with it? Well, it hangs on the wall.
[1:09:30] Well, that's faith. People say, "Oh, I'm
[1:09:32] a Christian. I believe God can." But
[1:09:35] what do you do about it? Put it to work.
[1:09:39] Turn it loose. do something with it. Get
[1:09:42] out. Hunt and hunt up the devil where he
[1:09:45] says you still hurting. Say you're a
[1:09:48] liar.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Put your faith to work.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Don't let him just constantly tell you
[1:09:54] that you're defeated. Say something
[1:09:57] back.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Don't let him tell you that it's all
[1:10:02] over. Say something back.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[1:10:09] So, put it to work.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; So, he says, you know, the devil tells
[1:10:12] you you're still hurting, say you're a
[1:10:14] liar. Pull a bead on him. Get him in the
[1:10:17] scope. Don't be afraid to pull the
[1:10:19] trigger.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz it'll go off as sure as anything.
[1:10:24] Yes, sir. It'll boomerang on him.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; So, hold on.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Abraham, like God, called those things
[1:10:33] which were not as though they were.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham done with his faith.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do with our faith?
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; He let the devil talk negative into us.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Well, your your marriage is going to
[1:10:49] fall apart. Oh, really? Oh, man. What do
[1:10:52] I need to do? I just don't know. Oh,
[1:10:54] your children are they'll never get
[1:10:56] saved. Oh, no. Really? I I'm I'm trying
[1:11:00] to do better and I'm just this I just
[1:11:02] don't know. You know, and before you
[1:11:03] know, we get so depressed and we're just
[1:11:05] moaning and a groaning. Oh, you're going
[1:11:07] to die, you know. Oh, really? Oh, yeah.
[1:11:10] Look, I mean, your toes hurting. Oh,
[1:11:12] that'll get worse. You know that, don't
[1:11:14] you? Amen. Oh, gang green's going to set
[1:11:16] in. Before you know it, you're going to
[1:11:18] be turning green and then you're going
[1:11:20] to die. You know, you know, and and we
[1:11:23] allow him to just to talk. Well,
[1:11:26] sometimes we've got to use our faith and
[1:11:29] speak back.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Now, you know it's true. That's right.
[1:11:35] That's right.
[1:11:37] Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; So we find
[1:11:42] Abraham like God called those things
[1:11:45] which were not as though they were.
[1:11:47] Anything everybody say anything
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; contrary to God's promise was a lie to
[1:11:53] Abraham.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Feelings that he felt that were contrary
[1:11:58] to God's promise was a lie to him. Yeah.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Emotions that he felt that was a
[1:12:04] contrary to God's promise to him was a
[1:12:07] lie to him.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; You understand? See, anything contrary
[1:12:11] was a lie. See, and so now as as we
[1:12:15] know, brother Brandon preached the
[1:12:16] sermon, the greatest battle ever fought.
[1:12:19] And and he talks about it, you know, how
[1:12:21] that in the beginning, man has been the
[1:12:23] the the since the beginning, man has
[1:12:25] been the battleground. Amen.
[1:12:28] Battleground.
[1:12:30] It never changes and through all the
[1:12:32] ages, man is still the battleground. And
[1:12:35] and so uh uh where two opposing forces,
[1:12:39] they're great forces uh meet uh in the
[1:12:43] man in the human being and and they
[1:12:45] fight their battles. The one trying to
[1:12:48] conquer the other, one trying to
[1:12:49] overcome the other. Ain't that right? So
[1:12:52] in the in the in the garden, Brother
[1:12:54] Brown said that Satan chose man's mind,
[1:12:57] his intellects, his reasonings, his
[1:12:59] imaginations, and and and God chose
[1:13:03] man's heart. Amen. Now that the battle
[1:13:06] has been set. Amen. God says, "I'm going
[1:13:08] to win this. I'm I'm going to my word is
[1:13:12] going to conquer in this individual."
[1:13:14] And and Satan says, "Oh, no, it's not.
[1:13:17] No, sir. I'll defeat you." Amen. Bring
[1:13:20] it on and I'll defeat your word. Amen.
[1:13:23] And so they meet in in the human being.
[1:13:26] See? And so every battle that you're
[1:13:28] going through, it's not it's not you.
[1:13:31] It's God and Satan that is at war
[1:13:35] together. Can you say amen? They're
[1:13:37] opposing one another. Satan is putting
[1:13:40] thoughts in your mind and God is trying
[1:13:42] to put the word into your heart. A ain't
[1:13:45] that right? Now you become the
[1:13:47] battleground because you are a uh uh um
[1:13:51] uh free moral agent. You you you can
[1:13:54] choose. Amen. Just like the Bible says,
[1:13:56] God says, "Behold, I set before you
[1:13:58] Amen. uh uh uh uh life and death." Amen.
[1:14:02] And blessings and cursings and and so
[1:14:04] you you you you've got your choices now.
[1:14:08] Amen. See, and so we we find they war.
[1:14:11] Now, Brother Brandham says the church
[1:14:13] today and and the carnal church depends
[1:14:18] everything upon the intellect, never
[1:14:21] thinking of the heart. And the only
[1:14:23] thing that they can see, well, I just
[1:14:26] can't see it that way. And well, you
[1:14:28] don't see with your eyes anyhow. You
[1:14:31] look with your eyes, you see with your
[1:14:33] heart. You look at anything and say,
[1:14:35] "Well, I just don't see it." Well,
[1:14:37] you're looking at it, but you don't see
[1:14:39] it. It means you don't understand it.
[1:14:41] Your understanding comes from your
[1:14:43] heart. See, now here he is now. He
[1:14:46] doesn't understand it with his mind. He
[1:14:49] doesn't understand the word. He doesn't
[1:14:51] understand the promises of God with his
[1:14:53] mind. How is he going to do it? See, his
[1:14:56] intellect would tell him that that
[1:14:59] that's his reasonings. But the Bible
[1:15:01] says we cast down reasonings.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Cast them away from
[1:15:05] us. You see? And and so so so you say,
[1:15:08] "Well, how am I going to get well when
[1:15:11] the doctor says I'm I'm I I'm I'm going
[1:15:14] to die.
[1:15:16] H how am I going to get well when the
[1:15:18] doctor says they ain't got no cure for
[1:15:19] this and and and I'm just one out of a
[1:15:22] billion that's actually got it, you
[1:15:24] know, and I just don't know what to do
[1:15:25] or or how am I going to get well? I I've
[1:15:28] got the common disease and and and
[1:15:30] there's nobody in science of of that
[1:15:33] that uh uh uh that's ever uh recorded to
[1:15:37] overcome this sickness. They die with it
[1:15:39] and and it just always be there, you
[1:15:41] know. Well, the intellect begins to say,
[1:15:44] "Well, how am I going to do this? I I
[1:15:46] just don't know." And and and it can get
[1:15:48] so uh uh our reasonings can get so
[1:15:52] prominent that when we come to the
[1:15:54] church and the promises are being
[1:15:55] preached, we can't get past it. be we
[1:15:58] can't hear the promises. We can't accept
[1:16:00] the promises because we're going by
[1:16:02] reasoning. Oh, it becomes a mountain to
[1:16:05] us. And it and what started out to be
[1:16:07] just a little antill now becomes
[1:16:10] something so huge that we can't even see
[1:16:13] God as who he is. And and we lose value
[1:16:17] in the word.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; So he says, "How am I going to get well
[1:16:23] when the doctor says this and when I've
[1:16:24] done this?" that don't have one thing to
[1:16:27] do with it.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Well, see, that's letting the devil put
[1:16:34] them thoughts there.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; As as as we said before, the devil's
[1:16:41] good at putting thoughts in your mind
[1:16:42] and then making you feel like
[1:16:46] you're the one that thought them. Sure.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Putting thoughts in your mind and then
[1:16:51] attaching it to you and you're like, "Oh
[1:16:54] my, if I was a Christian, how could I
[1:16:55] have ever thought that?"
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; If if I was really strong in faith, how
[1:17:00] could I have ever even imagined that?
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Well, Satan's putting that into your
[1:17:06] intellect.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; He does.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; So
[1:17:13] that's the devil putting them thoughts
[1:17:15] in there to get you to receive them and
[1:17:17] believe them.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Now when you do that, it makes the word
[1:17:22] of God of no effect.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Non-effective. Ain't that right?
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; It's true. So this is why we cannot
[1:17:32] dwell on both.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; The negative and the positive. Negative
[1:17:36] and the positive. Negative and the
[1:17:38] positive. choose what to dwell on.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; So this is why the Bible says 2
[1:17:43] Corinthians 10:5, casting down
[1:17:46] imaginations,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; reasonings.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Every You say, "Well, what's reasoning?
[1:17:52] What's that? What what's he talking
[1:17:53] about?" Every thought that is contrary
[1:17:55] to this word, put it down. Cast it down.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Don't dwell on it.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Now, Paul is telling us one thing. You
[1:18:05] have the power to do that.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every person that's got the Holy
[1:18:09] Ghost has the power to do it. You don't
[1:18:12] have to have a positive um what what do
[1:18:15] they call that? There's some people that
[1:18:16] are just all positive, man. You know,
[1:18:18] and then there's other people that just
[1:18:20] really go through things, you know, and
[1:18:22] and uh uh well, you don't have to have
[1:18:24] any of that. You don't have to have a
[1:18:26] positive nature it humanly to overcome.
[1:18:30] You just need God in your life.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And then you've got to
[1:18:35] believe God's word about what God's word
[1:18:37] says about the matter.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand. So casting down
[1:18:43] imaginations, reasoning, and every high
[1:18:46] thing that exaltth itself against the
[1:18:49] knowledge of God or the word of God.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; What God says, what God's promise is,
[1:18:55] cast it down.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; That's trying to exalt it itself above
[1:19:00] that promise.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. and bring every into captivity
[1:19:05] every thought to the obedience of
[1:19:07] Christ. So, Brother Bram says, "God
[1:19:09] don't want you to have reason." Reason
[1:19:12] always tries to find a way out.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; God gives you the promise. Well, you
[1:19:21] know, uh uh on whatever, then you say,
[1:19:24] "Oh, I I got I got to do something about
[1:19:26] this. This is getting bad. This is
[1:19:28] getting worse. This is getting Oh, this
[1:19:29] is horrible." Well, you know what? We're
[1:19:31] stressed out. We're worried about it.
[1:19:33] We're trying to fix it. You ain't fixing
[1:19:34] nothing. You're making bigger mess.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Trying to fight your battles.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Because you're not coming to a belief in
[1:19:43] God's word.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; So reasoning is just trying to work it
[1:19:46] out. Trying to fix it up. Fix it up.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Trying to find a way
[1:19:52] out. But faith doesn't reason. Faith
[1:19:54] just believes.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? And he says, "And a
[1:20:00] man in another place, and a man never
[1:20:02] knows what it is to live a victorious
[1:20:04] life until he's completely overcome."
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Now, automatically we say, "Oh, overcome
[1:20:12] then, man. I got a bunch of dos and
[1:20:14] don'ts that I got to figure it out and I
[1:20:16] got to live a perfect life and all
[1:20:18] that." That's that's that's that's
[1:20:20] wrong. Yeah.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; See, a man will never knows what it is
[1:20:25] to live a victorious life until he's
[1:20:27] completely overcome. Overcome who?
[1:20:30] Himself.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Everybody say myself.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Got to overcome myself.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; I ain't overcoming the banker. I ain't
[1:20:38] overcoming I ain't overcoming the the
[1:20:41] spouse. I'm not overcoming the, you
[1:20:43] know, the preacher and the deacons and
[1:20:45] and the sound guys. I'm not overcoming,
[1:20:48] you know, mom and dad. I'm not
[1:20:49] overcoming, you know, the boss or
[1:20:51] whatever. The biggest person that you've
[1:20:54] got to overcome is you.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; That's the person you've got to
[1:20:58] overcome.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, that's the biggest
[1:21:02] enemy you got is yourself. Yeah.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; You know, as uh there there's a cartoon
[1:21:07] clip and uh in the paper years ago and
[1:21:10] and is this guy uh he's saying, "Lord,
[1:21:14] just send lightning on my greatest
[1:21:17] enemy."
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; And then the next clip, he's he's he's
[1:21:22] gone, you know, and smoke is coming out
[1:21:23] of the ground.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; He was his biggest enemy, and God
[1:21:29] answered his prayer.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; So, don't pray for your enemies. I mean
[1:21:33] uh that God will curse them
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; because uh it might be you.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; So we we find that that brother Brown
[1:21:43] said that's the biggest enemy you got is
[1:21:44] yourself. That's the reason you can't
[1:21:47] rise up in faith is because you got
[1:21:50] intellectuals there. Your intellectual
[1:21:52] part says well this or that or whatever.
[1:21:55] Well that's reasoning. Just take God at
[1:21:59] his word and rest.
[1:22:02] Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Now, you have to cherish God's word
[1:22:09] enough to do that.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; We have to find value enough in God's
[1:22:14] word to actually do that. Yeah.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; That if God says it, I've got to value
[1:22:19] it enough to hold it in my heart to
[1:22:21] where I can cast down reasonings because
[1:22:24] I believe God's word is greater than
[1:22:26] what I think and what the the mayor
[1:22:28] thinks and what the pope thinks and and
[1:22:31] what everybody else thinks. God's word
[1:22:33] is right.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, so then in order
[1:22:39] to to receive the seed and to cherish
[1:22:42] it, the ground's got to be ready for it.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; See, the ground, the prophet said, is
[1:22:47] the heart. God prepares the heart first.
[1:22:50] See, so now there are people who hear
[1:22:52] the word, they laugh at it. There are
[1:22:54] other people who hear the word and try
[1:22:56] to grasp it only to end up disappointed.
[1:22:59] See, brother says, if you went and was
[1:23:01] prayed for one night and the next
[1:23:03] morning you say, "Well, I ain't no
[1:23:04] better." Well, I guess there ain't
[1:23:06] nothing to it. Oh, what a poor son of
[1:23:08] Abraham you are. That's right. Yes. See,
[1:23:11] not much of a son or daughter of
[1:23:13] Abraham. Well, I was prayed for and and
[1:23:15] and didn't get me healed. So, I get
[1:23:18] there's nothing to it. Oh, what a poor
[1:23:20] crowbait you make for God, right? See,
[1:23:23] and and and and I'll be be honest,
[1:23:25] sometimes we find our I find I think
[1:23:27] we're all guilty of this, you know.
[1:23:29] Well, I've waited. I've testified. I've
[1:23:31] claimed it. I've you know, what else is
[1:23:33] there to do? You know, it just seems to
[1:23:36] be getting worse. Rest.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Rest.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Cultivate the seed. Keep watering the
[1:23:42] seed with your praise. Brother Brand
[1:23:43] said that's how we water things. Amen.
[1:23:45] Is with our praises.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? If you want to come to
[1:23:50] church, just water it. Water the water
[1:23:52] with your praises. The songs that are
[1:23:54] sung is giving you the opportunity to
[1:23:57] water to cultivate the seed and and to
[1:23:59] worship God.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that right? So now notice
[1:24:06] another place. When you've done all that
[1:24:08] you can do, when you come through the
[1:24:10] prayer line and been prayed for, your
[1:24:12] heart doesn't condemn you and you're
[1:24:14] living right with God. Just hold on to
[1:24:18] it.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; God has to answer.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say that with me? God has to
[1:24:25] answer. He's testing you. If you turn
[1:24:29] loose the next morning, say, "Well, I
[1:24:31] ain't no better. I guess there was
[1:24:32] nothing to it. Well, then you didn't
[1:24:33] have faith to begin with. If you've got
[1:24:36] real faith, you'll hold till the last
[1:24:38] breast gone from your body. You're just
[1:24:42] certain that God is God.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Now, the believer is
[1:24:50] the believer is the one that's been
[1:24:52] prepared to receive the word.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Look, God would have
[1:24:58] never sent the word and and vindicated
[1:25:01] the word and gave us the interpret the
[1:25:03] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:25:05] by vindication if there was not a se a
[1:25:08] ground prepared.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Every person that's
[1:25:14] going to be in a rapture is the ground
[1:25:16] that God prepared before the foundation
[1:25:18] of the world. This word will have
[1:25:20] effect. This message is the shout. How
[1:25:23] many believes that? It's the shout.
[1:25:26] Right.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Sure it is.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; And it's gathering us together. Why?
[1:25:33] Because the seed, the ground has been
[1:25:35] prepared to receive it
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; and it's working effectively.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; So we find brother Brandham says he
[1:25:45] prepared you before the foundation of
[1:25:48] the world to receive him in this age.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Think of that.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; No way that you could receive him. And
[1:25:54] he's the word. We know that
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; the fullness of the word in this age.
[1:25:59] And the only way we could receive him in
[1:26:01] this age is he had to repair us.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; That's why we don't argue with the word.
[1:26:07] That's why we don't dissect the word and
[1:26:09] say, "Well, that's part brother Bram's
[1:26:10] opinion and part this and part that and
[1:26:13] I don't know about that and and and that
[1:26:15] was for, you know, in his day, you know,
[1:26:18] and and and things have changed so much
[1:26:20] and all." No, we're just good ground.
[1:26:23] We've been prepared to receive
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; the word for this age. He forneew you by
[1:26:29] his fornowledge and ordained you to
[1:26:31] eternal life. He knew you. Therefore, he
[1:26:34] prepared you. That's the reason you
[1:26:36] staggered out of these things and
[1:26:38] staggered into what you have now. See,
[1:26:41] it's God leading you to the place where
[1:26:44] he had ordained for you to be. Aren't
[1:26:47] you glad you're good ground?
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; You've been prepared for this.
[1:26:52] Well, I don't know if I'm going to make
[1:26:53] it in the rapture. How could you miss it
[1:26:55] if God prepared you for it?
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; So then the devil, he just goes, "Well,
[1:27:02] see, you just you you just a flop." Oh,
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; and then we began to believe it.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram says, "See, I believe
[1:27:17] that Christ has a church, and the church
[1:27:20] is the field."
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; And you've got to get the word in the
[1:27:24] field before the spirit can ever do
[1:27:26] anything.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Why would we need anything more than
[1:27:34] what God has already given us?
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:27:45] everything that God has given us in this
[1:27:47] age. Listen, church, the book's been
[1:27:49] open.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; It's been open.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; So, it's not like God's lacking in in
[1:27:59] certain things that he needs to still
[1:28:01] sow.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He swed it.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So either God has prepared a man
[1:28:10] to receive the word or he hasn't.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Either I'm prepared to receive the word
[1:28:16] or I'm not.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And that goes with all of us.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; See, and and he never God never promised
[1:28:25] to send anything else
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; outside this message.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah, I
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know how if you could see the
[1:28:37] value in that.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; You you could be sitting in any wares
[1:28:42] listening to creeds of men, educated
[1:28:45] men, and all of these things and and and
[1:28:49] receiving all of that into you and get
[1:28:52] nowhere's except ready for a
[1:28:54] tribulation.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; But God placed you in the greatest
[1:28:58] message ever.
[1:29:00] [Applause]
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:03] that this word could become effective to
[1:29:06] you to make sure you wouldn't miss the
[1:29:09] rapture to make sure that you would be
[1:29:11] at the marriage supper of the lamb to
[1:29:13] make sure that you would be there when
[1:29:15] the body changes you would be part of
[1:29:17] that resurrection
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; that you would be part of the adoption
[1:29:23] of sons
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; I believe
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; can you say amen
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; it's here
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; oh
[1:29:32] Amen.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; See, so
[1:29:37] we we find that as it's already been
[1:29:40] stated, the only ones
[1:29:45] that uh are receiving the word of God
[1:29:48] for this day is the elect. Others will
[1:29:51] criticize it, degrade it, treat it as
[1:29:53] though it is nothing. They will refuse
[1:29:55] to believe it. Right? They're
[1:29:59] intellectual. They become so
[1:30:00] intellectual and so carnal that they
[1:30:02] want to take their carnal minds and tell
[1:30:05] us how the prophet missed it and where
[1:30:06] he was wrong and he was overbearing and
[1:30:09] he was this and he was that and he
[1:30:11] couldn't just, you know, do everything
[1:30:13] that he preached and live what he
[1:30:15] preached and all these things. See, and
[1:30:17] so they claim now they claim to believe
[1:30:19] the word for another age.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Then then rather than than the word that
[1:30:25] was given for their age. Amen. The
[1:30:28] Pharisees and the Sadducees, remember,
[1:30:30] they claimed to believe the word that
[1:30:32] Moses had. But they, how dare they
[1:30:35] refuse, you know, or believe what the
[1:30:37] word that was right there standing
[1:30:38] before them, right? They couldn't accept
[1:30:41] the word then. Amen. Standing there in
[1:30:44] flesh. Amen. But oh, we believe what
[1:30:46] Moses said. And Jesus would tell them
[1:30:48] that Moses preached of me. Moses told of
[1:30:50] me. Moses prophesied of me.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's right.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; See, so so they thought that Jesus was
[1:30:59] diminishing Moses's ministry by what he
[1:31:02] was preaching and claiming to be. Hey,
[1:31:04] don't forget Moses. Don't forget Moses.
[1:31:06] Don't forget all the other prophets. And
[1:31:08] Jesus said, "But I'm manifesting
[1:31:10] everything that they preached about.
[1:31:12] They long to see my day." And I say
[1:31:14] that's happens again today. Oh, don't
[1:31:16] forget the reformers. Don't forget this.
[1:31:18] Don't forget that. Amen. We're not
[1:31:20] belittling all of them. They had their
[1:31:21] place. But I promise you, they would
[1:31:24] rather be in our place.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; They live.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. So then, Brother Bram
[1:31:34] says, we just accept the ba word upon
[1:31:36] the basis God said so.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Say that again. We just accept the word
[1:31:41] on the basis God said so and sets a
[1:31:44] stream between you and God. Every
[1:31:47] channel comes open between you and God.
[1:31:50] them just accept the word on the basis
[1:31:54] God said so
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; don't have to understand it all but God
[1:31:59] said so
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; I just accept it because I find value in
[1:32:03] what he said
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; can you say amenise
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; the Lord
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; so the word works effectively in us
[1:32:11] because it's we're the ground that's
[1:32:13] been prepared and Romans 10:8 we've read
[1:32:17] this of course uh But it says, "But what
[1:32:21] sayith that the word is nigh thee, even
[1:32:24] in thy mouth and in thine heart?"
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; That is the word of faith which we
[1:32:28] preach.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; So it's in thine heart, right?
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; That's that God was able to get the word
[1:32:33] into your heart.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Now it's in your mouth.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That shows that the word is
[1:32:41] having preeminence. Yes,
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; it shows now that Satan's thoughts that
[1:32:45] he's been putting in your mind, you've
[1:32:47] been able to cast that down and not
[1:32:50] speak negative.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; But let the word now come into your
[1:32:54] mouth and you're speaking what the word
[1:32:56] says.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; I'm healed.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Every thought that says, "No, you're
[1:33:01] not." Oh, yes, I am.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; The battle's on.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm feeling miserable."
[1:33:10] Well, it ought to be good because the
[1:33:12] battle's on. But make sure you yield to
[1:33:14] the word of God. Make sure you receive
[1:33:16] the promises of God. Don't you let the
[1:33:19] devil take that that word and make it of
[1:33:21] no effect in you.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that gentile woman that we
[1:33:27] read about was prepared ground,
[1:33:31] did you know that she had no promise to
[1:33:34] claim?
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. For as Jesus said, she was a dog.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; She was a gentile
[1:33:43] and healing was bread the children, the
[1:33:46] Jews.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; She came to Jesus off of no promise
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; for her.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; But she had heard what Jesus had been
[1:33:55] doing. She had heard of the things that
[1:33:58] were happening and faith struck her
[1:34:02] heart.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; G. And by her faith, she was inspired to
[1:34:08] go see.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Now listen. She heard what Jesus is
[1:34:14] doing and it struck faith. We're hearing
[1:34:18] something better than that. We're
[1:34:20] hearing that the promises actually
[1:34:22] belong to us.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Is it striking faith in your heart?
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Is it is faith coming alive in
[1:34:31] your heart
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; to where it's causing you to go to that
[1:34:35] word and lay claim to this word?
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Oh man.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Well, it's going to strike faith in that
[1:34:44] prepared ground. She was prepared
[1:34:47] ground. Jesus knew what kind of faith
[1:34:49] she had.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; She heard the word.
[1:34:58] Can you say amen?
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; And so we find that
[1:35:06] when we hear the word of God, it should
[1:35:08] do something to us.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; And when we hear the testimonies, I you
[1:35:14] know, I think this is why we should give
[1:35:16] testimony. If God has done something for
[1:35:18] you, don't hide that.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Talk about it.
[1:35:24] There's nothing I I think we should be
[1:35:26] happy
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; to testify to the church to people
[1:35:30] around what God has done.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Because just by hearing will strike
[1:35:35] faith in somebody's heart.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:35:39] you see
[1:35:42] what God did for someone else,
[1:35:45] we have every right to claim it for
[1:35:47] ourselves
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; because we've been invited not to eat
[1:35:52] crumbs. You don't have to eat crumbs
[1:35:54] that fall from the master's table.
[1:35:56] You've been invited to sit at the
[1:35:58] master's table.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? In the Old Testament,
[1:36:02] there was a woman by the name of Hannah.
[1:36:03] And I'll get ready to close, but you're
[1:36:05] going to have to hang in there cuz I'll
[1:36:06] quit when I'm done.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:36:11] But but when there was a woman by the
[1:36:14] name of Hannah who couldn't have
[1:36:15] children, how many remembers that
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; she couldn't have children? But the
[1:36:20] prophet said that she heard
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; that there was another woman that lived
[1:36:25] before her time whose name was Sarah.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; She was barren, too.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; She couldn't have children. but heard
[1:36:35] that God
[1:36:37] had blessed her and she received a
[1:36:40] child.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; And based upon that testimony, faith
[1:36:45] struck her heart.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; And that day she went to the temple.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; She had been made fun of as a barren
[1:36:55] woman and all these things, but that day
[1:36:58] she went to the temple. And everybody
[1:37:00] else, maybe brother Brand depicts the
[1:37:03] plaint the picture. Maybe they were
[1:37:05] talking about groceries and they were
[1:37:06] talking about their cows and they were
[1:37:08] talking about this. But she came for a
[1:37:10] purpose.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; She had a desire. She had something
[1:37:13] faith had struck into her heart. If God
[1:37:16] can do it for Sarah, God can do it to
[1:37:18] me. No matter how bad I am, no matter
[1:37:21] how impossible it seems, God done it
[1:37:24] then. God can do it today. And she got
[1:37:27] at that altar and she wept and she
[1:37:29] prayed until the priest thought she was
[1:37:32] drunk.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; But she valued what she heard.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; She changed what she heard.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; She received it for her.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Prophet rebuked her. How dare you be a
[1:37:49] drunk woman in the temple of God. She
[1:37:50] says, "I'm not a drunk."
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Preach. is I'm a woman in travail.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; You know me, Eli.
[1:38:05] I've been laughed at and I've been
[1:38:07] scorned at and I've been made fun of and
[1:38:09] it's been in a mockery and embarrassment
[1:38:11] cuz I can't have children.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; But I heard a testimony one time.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to approach that same God.
[1:38:23] And I ain't stopping until he gives it
[1:38:25] to me. And Eli says, "You'll have what
[1:38:27] you you asked for. Go in peace."
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; and she had exactly what she asked for.
[1:38:35] Right.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, because she heard. See, she
[1:38:38] heard. Now, Brother Bram says, "Now, if
[1:38:40] Mr. John Doe out here had cancer and was
[1:38:42] healed, so can you that have it and be
[1:38:46] healed."
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; If John Doe got healed of cancer, you
[1:38:50] can be healed of cancer. Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? If one
[1:38:54] blind man can receive his sight, then so
[1:38:56] can you. If you're blind, if a crippled
[1:38:59] person can rise up out of a wheelchair
[1:39:01] and walk, so can you. If you're crippled
[1:39:03] and can't walk, don't diminish God.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And upon hearing and seeing what
[1:39:10] God is doing, lay claim to it. If God
[1:39:13] healed a a person of a toothache, what
[1:39:16] makes him stop to where he can't do you?
[1:39:20] Amen.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Did you know that's how Congressman
[1:39:26] Upshaw got healed?
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; He was in a wheelchair, he was immut
[1:39:36] Congressman Upshaw, who preached, he
[1:39:38] says, uh, when he read of Florence
[1:39:40] Nightingale and her trouble. Now, you
[1:39:42] all know, how many knows the story of
[1:39:44] Florence Nightingale? You've heard that
[1:39:46] story? She she only weighed 40 lbs. They
[1:39:48] got that picture of her where she is
[1:39:50] just just skin and bone, just limbs and
[1:39:53] skin just around the limbs. Right. Amen.
[1:39:55] And here's a man in a wheelchair, can't
[1:39:59] walk, been 66 years that way. And he
[1:40:03] begins to hear the story.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; He said he had heard of this shoemaker
[1:40:09] down here who had been paralyzed, a
[1:40:11] Baptist deacon lying in his chair for
[1:40:13] about 10 years, willing him up down the
[1:40:15] floor uh to do his work. his office at
[1:40:18] the Baptist church when a vision
[1:40:19] appeared over him and saying he was
[1:40:21] bound in that wheelchair for those years
[1:40:24] with his back broken up and down in this
[1:40:26] place had sprints in his back until he
[1:40:28] couldn't even move and the man was
[1:40:30] perfectly whole. Amen. See? Amen. And
[1:40:33] and he heard of the story of Florence
[1:40:36] Nightingale. Amen. And how God had
[1:40:38] healed her and and and Congressman
[1:40:41] Upshaw said this. Now, this is where it
[1:40:43] happened. Now, he didn't just say, "Oh,
[1:40:45] that's a good story. That's really nice.
[1:40:47] I need to tell the my children this. No,
[1:40:49] he was in need. He had a need. He needed
[1:40:53] something, too. And he said, "If God can
[1:40:55] do that, God can do me." Amen. 66 years.
[1:41:00] He would never let that 66 years, Amen.
[1:41:03] Hold him back because he believed.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram says if Florence
[1:41:12] Nightingale could be made whole as she
[1:41:13] was dying with cancer and only weighed
[1:41:15] 40 lbs, so can every person be healed
[1:41:18] that has cancer.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Good preaching.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; He says if little Georgie Carter at
[1:41:29] Miltown laying there 9 years and 8
[1:41:32] months,
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Couldn't even move her hands.
[1:41:38] Couldn't raise her
[1:41:43] butt cup.
[1:41:46] TB run all the way through her. Give her
[1:41:50] up five years before left by doctors.
[1:41:53] Never had seen the trees or nothing for
[1:41:56] nine years and six months. and in one
[1:41:59] moment's time was made perfectly well 8
[1:42:03] years ago is play a piano player in the
[1:42:05] Miltown Baptist church tonight. If she
[1:42:08] can be healed of that of TB, so can you
[1:42:12] in every case.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Every case.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Every case. Your case is not isolated to
[1:42:22] God. God has given you testimony after
[1:42:25] testimony after testimony. And yet
[1:42:27] you're not like that gentile woman who
[1:42:30] had no promise to claim. You've got
[1:42:32] every promise. Every promise. If God
[1:42:35] rode the Red back the Red Sea, you've
[1:42:36] got a promise for that. If God delivered
[1:42:39] the four the three Hebrew children out
[1:42:41] of the fiery furnace, you got a promise
[1:42:43] of that. God will deliver you. God will
[1:42:46] roll back the Red Sea just for you.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:42:57] Glory.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; God gave these stories to build our
[1:43:00] faith.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Get our minds out of the garbage cans.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Quit feeding off the negative.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Negative is a bad thing that has gripped
[1:43:18] the world.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Most everyone speaks negative, thinks
[1:43:21] negative, talks negative. God can do
[1:43:24] something for them and they're still
[1:43:25] talking negative.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; They can see God doing things all around
[1:43:29] them and they're still talking negative.
[1:43:30] God be merciful to us if we talk
[1:43:33] negative.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Change our language. Let the word be in
[1:43:39] our heart and in our mouth. And when you
[1:43:42] receive the word, hold on to that word.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, God doesn't need to come
[1:43:51] to us in the form of a bolt, lightning
[1:43:53] bolt. He doesn't need to come to us in
[1:43:56] some spectacular way. He sent his word.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; And all we need to do is believe it the
[1:44:03] same way Abraham believed it.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; You see, receive the word the same way
[1:44:08] Abraham received it. How did he receive
[1:44:09] it? As a promise
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; and believe it the same way he believed
[1:44:14] it.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Now, listen to what brother Brandham
[1:44:16] says. after 25 years of ministry
[1:44:22] for the Lord in his work and in his word
[1:44:26] and after this being coming in my 12th
[1:44:29] year of international evangelism and by
[1:44:32] the grace of God to meeting tens of
[1:44:35] thousands of people and seeing our Lord
[1:44:37] move in our campaigns
[1:44:40] now as I have seen him seen to him right
[1:44:45] in towards 2 million or a million and
[1:44:48] 500,000 somewhere along there in the
[1:44:51] meeting. So he's given us his if we
[1:44:54] could say his credential, right?
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; That he ain't just a fly by night. He
[1:44:59] ain't just one that just got up and
[1:45:01] don't know nothing.
[1:45:03] But notice, I've come to this conclusion
[1:45:06] and all of all of our efforts and so
[1:45:09] forth, it's impossible for God to do
[1:45:12] anything for the people until the people
[1:45:16] first get settled on whether it's truth
[1:45:19] or not.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Of all the things that he had seen, he's
[1:45:27] finally he came to that conclusion. God
[1:45:30] can't do nothing for the people until
[1:45:33] the people get settled in their heart
[1:45:35] whether it's truth or not.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Is God's word true?
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Is God's word a promise?
[1:45:45] [Music]
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; We must be settled.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; That it's the truth.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Another place, God wants somebody who
[1:45:55] will not give up.
[1:45:57] A winner never quits and a quitter never
[1:45:59] wins.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Listen, you got to stay and call it.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Call things right before Satan. Tell him
[1:46:09] it's this way.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the Lord. The Lord has said
[1:46:14] so and that it is written.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; It's written. No matter what he says,
[1:46:20] it's written.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's why we need to
[1:46:27] get in our Bibles. That's why we need to
[1:46:28] hear a prophet speak and give us the
[1:46:31] right interpretation.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Because the devil has had enough of his
[1:46:35] talking to us.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Convincing us that this word is not
[1:46:40] right. You say, "Oh, I'll always believe
[1:46:42] the word." Then we must believe for what
[1:46:44] belongs to us.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; We can believe it in for a general, but
[1:46:48] now we've got to take that word for
[1:46:50] ourselves.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Well, brother Bram never got
[1:46:56] to touch me. But it is written.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram never done no healing. God
[1:47:01] done your healing. It's already did.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; It's written.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Whatever I ask and believe God, I shall
[1:47:09] receive it. It's mine. My personal
[1:47:12] property.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; That's the way you receive the word.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; That's how you cherish the word.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. another place. We just
[1:47:22] receive his word just like it was he
[1:47:24] himself.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; When I see his promise to me, that's
[1:47:29] Christ and I embrace it cuz he can't
[1:47:32] lie.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; To me, that's exactly the truth. I might
[1:47:35] not know how to take a hold of it, but
[1:47:37] it's the truth. And I hold right with it
[1:47:40] because it's Christ to me.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Every word of this
[1:47:45] Bible, every promise of God is Christ to
[1:47:48] me.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You embrace the promise, you're
[1:47:51] embracing Christ.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, Satan set out to exalt
[1:48:01] himself above the most high as we know,
[1:48:03] to sit in the temple of God, to be
[1:48:05] worshiped as God, and to be God. Brother
[1:48:08] Brandham says he has succeeded in
[1:48:10] carrying out his threats.
[1:48:13] He has certainly had a marvelous success
[1:48:15] in carrying out his threats by the
[1:48:18] people letting him explain away in every
[1:48:22] age the value of God's promised word to
[1:48:26] that age.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; That's exactly how he's done it. In
[1:48:31] every age, he's explained it away.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil explain the value of
[1:48:39] God's word away.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:48:42] Do you love him?
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the musicians will come
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; preaching the
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; God sent us a prophet to give us the
[1:48:52] perfect interpretation of the word by
[1:48:54] divine vindication.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; And Satan's still anointing his
[1:48:59] ministers to explain the value of that
[1:49:01] word away.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; The value of the promise. But brother
[1:49:06] Bram says, "I do not care how much the
[1:49:08] devils beat you down with sickness."
[1:49:11] Whoa. He sounds heartless. No, he's so
[1:49:14] true on the word.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; He so believes that word. I don't care
[1:49:19] how much the devil's beat you down with
[1:49:20] sickness, with leukemia, with cancer,
[1:49:23] with tuberculosis, or crippled, or
[1:49:25] whatever he's done. You just take that
[1:49:28] promise of God, the word of God, and
[1:49:31] say, "I believe it."
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; What a word to speak.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Good. Very good.
[1:49:52] I've um watched, you know, the antique
[1:49:55] show, the road show
[1:50:01] where people bring in things that they
[1:50:04] have no idea the value of
[1:50:08] they take it there to be appraised.
[1:50:14] I like watching their faces,
[1:50:16] you know, and
[1:50:18] I like learning the value of of of
[1:50:20] things. And sometimes
[1:50:25] you'll see the disappointment
[1:50:28] and the countenance drop in people
[1:50:33] because the appraiser
[1:50:36] didn't give them the value that they
[1:50:38] thought it was worth.
[1:50:41] come to find out it would be a
[1:50:42] counterfeit. It would be something that
[1:50:45] was
[1:50:47] it just didn't hold worth and and the
[1:50:49] person thought that here they were
[1:50:51] holding this as something valuable and
[1:50:54] then
[1:50:56] I've seen where people have cried.
[1:50:59] They just get beside themselves. They
[1:51:00] don't they just become speechless
[1:51:02] because they'll have a little painting
[1:51:04] or they'll have a little object and
[1:51:07] something or even just a piece of paper
[1:51:09] or it could be even a ticket from some
[1:51:11] well-known
[1:51:13] uh a person back in in 19 or 1800s and
[1:51:16] they've got it there and the appraiser
[1:51:19] will tell them 10,000 a million and
[1:51:23] you'll start to see them crying cuz they
[1:51:25] didn't know the value. Yeah.
[1:51:28] And now they're cherishing it with
[1:51:30] everything they got.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Because somebody told them it's valuable
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; and and that's nice. That's nice.
[1:51:40] But I thought, you know, what about when
[1:51:42] people don't see value
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; in the word of God?
[1:51:47] Do we go by what they value the word to
[1:51:50] be?
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:51:52] I thought brother Brandham he said one
[1:51:55] time that a man had given him a just a
[1:51:58] 22 gun barrel
[1:52:02] just a 20 just a gun barrel of a 22.
[1:52:06] He said he took it home and he carved
[1:52:10] out a stock
[1:52:12] put that barrel and made him made him a
[1:52:14] 22.
[1:52:16] He said, "Now the gun's probably worth
[1:52:19] 50 cents, a dollar."
[1:52:25] But he says, "I wouldn't care if they
[1:52:28] gave me a million.
[1:52:31] I would never sell it
[1:52:34] because I see value. It's valuable to
[1:52:37] me."
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "Every time I see it, it
[1:52:40] reminds me of that brother."
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; And so he says, "I wouldn't sell it."
[1:52:44] See, so so what somebody else would look
[1:52:46] and say, "Oh, that's a piece of junk."
[1:52:48] To him, it became valuable.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, there's people that look
[1:52:53] at this and they appraise it for
[1:52:55] whatever and they say, "Well, it's just
[1:52:56] not much. It's counterfeit. It has so
[1:52:59] much contradictions and and all these
[1:53:01] things and and of course, I view the
[1:53:03] message to be the word of God just as
[1:53:05] well." And they pick that apart and they
[1:53:06] see no value in it. They they see
[1:53:08] nothing. But see, every time I see the
[1:53:11] word and every time I listen to it and
[1:53:12] and I read it, I see Christ.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; It reminds me of my promises. It reminds
[1:53:17] me of what I've been delivered from. It
[1:53:19] reminds me of where I'm going. It
[1:53:21] reminds me that it ain't about me. It's
[1:53:23] all about him.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; It reminds me that there has been a
[1:53:27] finished work in my life.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Nah,
[1:53:32] it's invaluable to me. Let the world do
[1:53:35] what they want to do. But this ain't for
[1:53:37] sale.
[1:53:38] My belief ain't for sale. My convictions
[1:53:41] ain't for sale.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; It's more than a book.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; It's something. It's my life.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him? Isn't he wonderful?
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. What's
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord? The battle is over.
[1:54:04] Victory is won.
[1:54:07] It's already done. Oh, sing it now.
[1:54:13] Oh, it's already done.
[1:54:18] Hallelujah.
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:21] It's already
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yes,
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; the battle is over.
[1:54:32] Victory is won.
[1:54:35] It's already done.
[1:54:38] I have overcome.
[1:54:41] Oh, I have overcome.
[1:54:46] Hallelu.
[1:54:49] I have overcome.
[1:54:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:56] The battle is over.
[1:55:01] Oh, glory to God.
[1:55:06] Oh, I am healed.
[1:55:10] I'm already healed.
[1:55:14] Hallelujah.
[1:55:17] [Applause]
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:55:24] The battle is over.
[1:55:27] The victory is won.
[1:55:31] I'm already healed.
[1:55:34] Now, here's what Brother Brandham says
[1:55:36] in his prayer.
[1:55:39] He said, "God,
[1:55:41] help us to get our faith in the right
[1:55:43] place tonight
[1:55:45] and move out on the battleground there
[1:55:48] and say, Satan, you're a liar."
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ died to make me free and
[1:55:53] it's mine. Get out of here.
[1:55:57] Yes,
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; God. Place our faith there.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; That we can step out on that
[1:56:03] battleground and look at the devil and
[1:56:05] say, "Get out of here. You're a liar.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; You're defeated. You have no place." Can
[1:56:13] you say amen? Can we do that? Oh yes, we
[1:56:16] can. Because the word of God is in our
[1:56:19] heart and we give over to the word. We
[1:56:22] let the word have the preeminence in us.
[1:56:25] Can you say amen? Hallelujah. Let's
[1:56:27] stand to our feet and sing it now. Oh,
[1:56:33] it's already done.
[1:56:35] [Music]
[1:56:36] Hallelujah.
[1:56:39] [Music]
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:56:46] The battle is over.
[1:56:50] Victory is won.
[1:56:54] It's already done.
[1:56:57] Oh, sing it again. Oh, it's already
[1:57:02] done.
[1:57:04] Hallelujah.
[1:57:07] It's already done.
[1:57:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:14] The battle is over.
[1:57:18] The victory is won.
[1:57:21] It's already done.
[1:57:26] [Music]
[1:57:28] Oh, there ain't nothing
[1:57:31] nothing too hard for you.
[1:57:35] I may stumble
[1:57:38] everything
[1:57:40] do.
[1:57:41] I may worry,
[1:57:44] hold my breath till my face turns blue.
[1:57:48] But it ain't nothing.
[1:57:50] It ain't nothing for you.
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:55] Words.
[1:57:57] All the children had their backs to that
[1:58:01] Red Sea.
[1:58:03] And oh Pharaoh looked like he had the
[1:58:07] victory.
[1:58:09] But the waters rolled on back with the
[1:58:13] breath you blew. And it ain't nothing.
[1:58:18] It ain't nothing for you.
[1:58:21] Oh, Joshua
[1:58:24] took a wall around Jero.
[1:58:27] And you told him, Lord, you told him
[1:58:30] that the wall would go
[1:58:33] and it crumbled at that shout when the
[1:58:37] trumpets blew.
[1:58:39] And it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing
[1:58:43] for you. Sing it down. Oh, it ain't
[1:58:46] nothing.
[1:58:48] It ain't nothing for you.
[1:58:51] I may falter, stumble in everything I
[1:58:56] do. Oh, and I may worry,
[1:59:00] hold my breath till my face turns blue.
[1:59:03] But it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing
[1:59:07] for you.
[1:59:09] Now, Elijah,
[1:59:12] all them prophets said that he was
[1:59:14] wrong.
[1:59:15] Send the fire down to their gods. They
[1:59:19] prayed all day long. Then Elijah prayed
[1:59:23] down all the
[1:59:26] [Music]
[1:59:28] nothing. It ain't nothing for you.
[1:59:32] Now church, I was lonely. Sin had broken
[1:59:36] my heart into
[1:59:39] all the pieces. I couldn't win with the
[1:59:43] strongest glue.
[1:59:45] But the Lord Jesus, you took the pieces
[1:59:49] and made me new. And it ain't nothing.
[1:59:52] Now, if he can put you back together and
[1:59:54] make you like new, can he heal your
[1:59:56] body? Can he bring you through the
[1:59:59] trial? Can he bring a restoration? Can
[2:00:02] he save your children?
[2:00:04] Hallelujah.
[2:00:07] Oh, I may worry, hold my breath till my
[2:00:12] face turns blue. But it ain't nothing.
[2:00:17] It ain't nothing for you.
[2:00:20] Now this body is slowly dying without
[2:00:25] within.
[2:00:26] But I ain't worried though the skin
[2:00:30] worms eat my skin. Cuz you'll open
[2:00:34] heaven's door and I'll walk right in.
[2:00:38] Cuz it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing
[2:00:41] for you.
[2:00:44] Oh, it ain't nothing.
[2:00:46] It ain't nothing for you.
[2:00:50] I may falter, stumble into everything I
[2:00:54] do.
[2:00:56] I may worry, hold my breath till my face
[2:01:00] turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It
[2:01:04] ain't nothing for you.
[2:01:06] Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't. Can you
[2:01:10] just turn around, shake somebody's hand,
[2:01:12] just say, "It ain't nothing for God.
[2:01:16] It ain't nothing for him. Oh, I may
[2:01:19] falter. Hold my breath till my face
[2:01:22] turns blue. But it ain't nothing. It
[2:01:27] ain't nothing for you."
[2:01:30] Now I hate this body. It's slowly dying
[2:01:33] without within.
[2:01:36] But I ain't worried though. The skin
[2:01:38] worms ate my skin. Cuz Lord, you'll open
[2:01:43] heaven's door. I'll walk right in. Cuz
[2:01:47] it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing. Oh,
[2:01:51] let the bride see it now. It ain't
[2:01:54] nothing.
[2:01:57] Do you believe that? I may falter,
[2:02:01] stumble in everything I do.
[2:02:06] [Music]
[2:02:21] I may falter, stumble at everything I
[2:02:25] do. Oh, I may worry, hold my breath till
[2:02:30] my face turns blue. But it ain't
[2:02:33] nothing. It ain't nothing for you.
[2:02:41] He'll do it again
[2:02:46] for
[2:02:47] you. He'll do it again.
[2:02:54] [Music]
[2:02:56] Oh, just take a look
[2:03:00] at where you are now
[2:03:03] and where you've been.
[2:03:07] [Music]
[2:03:10] Hasn't he always come through
[2:03:14] for
[2:03:16] you? He's the same now as there.
[2:03:24] You may not know how.
[2:03:28] You may not know when. But you'll do it
[2:03:33] again.
[2:03:36] Oh, he'll do it again
[2:03:41] for
[2:03:43] you. He'll do it again.
[2:03:50] Oh, just take a look
[2:03:54] at where you are now.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he'll do it again.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Where you been?
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; As he always come through for
[2:04:09] you. He's the same now as
[2:04:13] [Music]
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; you may not know how.
[2:04:20] You may not know when, but you'll do it
[2:04:25] again.
[2:04:27] If I could remember the story right, a
[2:04:30] minister that knew Brother Brennan
[2:04:33] pretty well, he brought a friend that
[2:04:36] was really really sick and and they both
[2:04:39] lived out of out of the uh state. Uh
[2:04:43] lived in Arkansas, but he had brought
[2:04:45] that friend all the way to Indiana for
[2:04:48] brother Brandham to pray for him.
[2:04:52] And brother Brown prayed for him and
[2:04:54] told him says, 'You now you're healed.
[2:04:57] Everything's over. And sure enough,
[2:05:02] the day went by, great. A week went by,
[2:05:07] doing pretty good.
[2:05:10] But then the brother got a received a
[2:05:12] call from this man and says, "Oh, it's
[2:05:14] back again. I I I just all the symptoms
[2:05:18] and I'm just so sick and I just don't
[2:05:20] know." He said, "I thought I was
[2:05:22] healed." He goes, "Well, I I thought you
[2:05:24] were too."
[2:05:26] Hang on just a moment. I'll try to get a
[2:05:28] hold of brother Brandham. And so, he was
[2:05:31] able to reach Brother Brandham. And he
[2:05:34] told Brother Brand, "Oh, brother
[2:05:35] Brandham, I that remember that man you
[2:05:37] prayed for? He's it's all back again."
[2:05:40] And he he just don't know what to do.
[2:05:41] And he's sick and and the symptoms. And
[2:05:44] he says, "What what? I thought he was
[2:05:46] healed." And Ram says, "Oh, brother." He
[2:05:49] said, "You tell him, don't you worry
[2:05:51] about all that." He says, "It's just a
[2:05:52] cat scratching at the door." He said,
[2:05:55] "He's fine."
[2:05:57] He told brother, he called that that man
[2:05:59] up and says, "Ah, don't you worry about
[2:06:01] it, Vet." He said, "You ain't sick." He
[2:06:05] said, "It's just the scratch scratching
[2:06:07] at the door trying to get back in." He
[2:06:09] said, "Just ignore it." He said, "Right
[2:06:11] then." And just left him. Never got sick
[2:06:14] again off of that situation. Amen. You
[2:06:17] say, "Well, I've been prayed for. I
[2:06:18] really thought I was feeling better. Ah,
[2:06:20] just a scat cat scratching at the door.
[2:06:23] Just ignore it. Just say just believe
[2:06:25] God. I'm healed. Can you say amen? God
[2:06:28] bless you. Love you. Thank you for your
[2:06:31] patience. And uh good to again have uh
[2:06:35] the granddaughters here. Amen. And uh
[2:06:39] God bless you. We really appreciate your
[2:06:41] mom and dad and your brothers too. And
[2:06:45] um and so uh um God bless you all. May
[2:06:50] you all have a wonderful week. Keep sis
[2:06:52] uh keep sister Lisa's daughter Rebecca
[2:06:56] in prayer.
[2:06:58] Um
[2:07:00] I just a lot of things going on and you
[2:07:04] know it uh I I don't know. I know the
[2:07:06] doctor um I was told the doctor made her
[2:07:09] sign a thing last night that if she was
[2:07:12] to die, you know, did she want to be
[2:07:15] revived? She said no. And all these
[2:07:17] things. Uh it's it's a serious situation
[2:07:20] from what I'm hearing. And so we we just
[2:07:24] want to keep her in prayer. I got to
[2:07:25] talk to her a little bit about the Lord
[2:07:27] today and she just cried and cried and
[2:07:29] cried, you know, and um I'm going to try
[2:07:32] to go back tomorrow and talk with her,
[2:07:34] but u just never know just believing God
[2:07:37] will arrest her heart. Amen. So just
[2:07:41] keep her in prayer, keep brother Josiah
[2:07:43] and brother Judah in prayer as they're
[2:07:45] traveling. Amen. And um God bless you,
[2:07:50] brother Amos, do you want to dismiss us
[2:07:52] in prayer?
[2:07:54] Heavenly Father God, we want to thank
[2:07:56] you for this.
