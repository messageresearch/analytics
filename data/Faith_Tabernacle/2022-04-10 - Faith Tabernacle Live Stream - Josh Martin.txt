of our desires every time we come to church as lord fill my cup and i came across a quote where brother branham says coming to church don't make you a christian it helps you be a christian so when we come to church saying lord here's my cup that's when god can come so here's here's another blessing for you here's another refilling for you amen if you have your bibles let's turn to isaiah 53 and 1. glad to have my wife with me this weekend i'm going to be leaving to england with brother andrew on tuesday so we're going to be away from each other for about a week week and a half so keep me in your prayers this is going that's a long time isaiah 53-1 a familiar scripture but who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed coming by our heads this morning dear gracious heavenly father we want to thank you for your grace and your mercy lord as we felt your presence this morning god this is a new service father another time lord i ask that you would help us tonight father lord as i lay myself aside anoint this vessel lord jesus lord anoint the congregation father be in everything that's said and done take this little thought that you've placed upon my heart lord we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated my my title this evening would be a challenge to the believer i know there's many ways that you can take this scripture and it's a popular scripture it's preached on a lot but i'm going to take this tonight as a challenge and a challenge is to see what you're made of to see how if you're stronger than your opponent faster than your opponent smarter than your opponent but there's one thing though we've got to realize we're never stronger than the devil in our own ability we're never smarter than the devil we see eve in the middle of perfection got outwitted by the devil you're never smarter than the devil you're never stronger you're never faster but we still have to fight for every inch of ground but god has given us the ability through the strength of the lord to stand in this last day more than overcomers we've got a fight you see brother branham says now you see after you become a christian many people think well after i become a christian that settles it all i have to do is just say well glory to god everything's mine he says no sir you're mistaken you have to fight for every inch of ground that you take god told ease israel down in egypt i give you the promised land but he told joshua when he went in everywhere the sows of your feet shred i give you it was already given to them but you had a fight for every inch of ground in other words footprints mean possession just keep walking now they had to fight for it but god had given it to them and i believe god has given us every promise when he died at calvary gave you your healing your deliverance the the the holy ghost for your loved ones but you still gotta fight you still gotta get up put your boots on and say devil we're going another round we're going another time but in your own ability we can't do it but god has equipped this with everything that we have need of to overcome every spirit to overcome every devil and that is the holy ghost you see we have to fight brother branham says he didn't get we didn't get saved to be on a picnic he says we got saved and now we're put in a battleground we're on a battlefield the fact whenever god gives you something the devil's going to come right back and try to take it away from you what a brother branham says he says when you're healed from cancer that devil is going to try to come back but we got to fill up that void with the word of god with the holy ghost when you're delivered for something from something the devil's gonna come right back and try to give it to you but we gotta fight the battle ain't over at a meeting the battle land over whenever you get your deliverance but you gotta fight to maintain your liberty it's a fight to come the church the preacher fights mind battles the song leader fights mind battles the deacons fight mind battles the the sound guys everybody that comes to church is fighting mind battles why the devil knows if you can ever get in an atmosphere where all things are possible he loses your hold if you can get in an atmosphere where the mind battles fall you can get your deliverance and that's why he fights you from coming to church that's why he fights you from breaking through to the presence of the lord but i say this this evening if you can break through pass those mind battles into this presence this evening all things are possible if you need healing god can give it to you if you need the holy ghost god can give it to you if you need to refill it god can give it to you but we gotta fight it's for our grounds god has already given us a refilling or promised us to refill it but we got to fight for it but you see you're not alone in this battle the devil will like you to think that you're the only one that goes through mind battles you're the only one that goes through complexes you're the only one that fights temptations the fights discouragement and fights this and fights that you're not alone every one of us fight complexes but god as it gave you has equipped a body a unit that can stand shoulder to shoulder and fight for the promises of god oh but there's got to be somebody accept the challenge it's hard for me to keep my coat on amen but we got to fight for everything that we're going to preserve or possess you see the devil wants to bring a division where we're off to ourselves doing our own thing but that right there is a target for the devil to come and lure your way to complexes when you're by yourself what does complexes do that's not the way i'm intending it to go but what does complexes do complexes draw you up to yourself oh it draws you up where now now you don't feel like you can fit in with everybody because the devil has placed a complex in your mind that you're fat that you're too skinny you're too short you're too tall you're too die in a complex that was too dark whenever i was younger so i didn't feel like i could fit in with some people that was a complex that the devil put on me and wanted me to draw up to myself but if i drew up to myself the devil was going to plague my mind day after day after day and by myself i was going to fall apart so the devil places complexes so that you draw up by yourself god didn't mean this to draw up it didn't mean for us to draw up by yourself he placed a body in the middle of laodicea where we can feed off the word of god we can feed off each other's testimonies we can feed off the spirit of god that he's placed upon our in our lives you know the story in the old testament uh i believe that the syrians had seized samaria and what they did was they surrounded the city and cut off their water supply cut off their food resources and now they're trapped inside of a city that they built with their own hands what does a complex do a complex is a wall that you build up yourself trying to protect yourself you got hurt or or you think this one don't like you those mind battles are building up a wall between you and your brother between you and your sister between you and the pastor between you and this one it's the devil placing a complex and instead of fighting against that complex you build up a walled city the syrians had built up a city to protect themselves and now they're surrounded and they're trapped inside of their own city what happened the bible says that it got so bad that the famine got so bad that the the the mothers and fathers were eating their own children the their family was the one struggling and being hurt inside of that city what happens you're not the only one that gets hurt in your complex your loved ones get hurt your family members get hurt what i'm trying to say is this is a battle we're going to have complexes but don't draw up to yourself fight against that complex we've been equipped in this last day not the false subject to complexes and anxiety and this and that but we've got the power through the name of jesus christ with the baptism of the holy ghost to stand up against the challenges the devil sends our way and so there were some lepers they didn't fit in with the society but they were sitting at the gate and said shall we sit here till we die on the outside of the wall everybody worked up in their mind that there was a great big army worked up in their mind that they couldn't get water worked up in their mind that they couldn't get enough food oh what's the complex do it cut you off where you're the water supply of the holy ghost is covered off away from you the food supply of the word is cut off away from you you don't want to come to church no more you don't want to go to the fellowships no more i'm preaching this evening you don't want to go to the youth meetings no more it's a complex that you built up a wall with that's cutting you off from the resources that god has given for you oh but there were some lepers some nobody that wasn't even allowed to go in the city but they said shall we sit here till we die what happened i know the story these lepers defied the odds says you know what we may be in a hard time but we're not just going to sit here and die we're going to fight to survive oh we need some sons and daughters of god that say i'm not going to lay down i'm going to fight to survive in this last day the last plague is spiritual death but i'm not going to give in to spiritual death i'm going to fight and claim every promise every inheritance that god has given me oh so these these lepers went outside of the city and there wasn't even no army there there wasn't even an army there but they were trapped inside of a city they built thinking there was something on the inside that's what a complex does in reality the pastor likes you your mama likes you your sister likes you your brother likes you but you worked up a walled city because of a complex and nothing's even there i got some news for you walk out of that city you don't gotta stay in that complex you don't gotta stay in that anxiety walk out of the city the devil's nothing but a bluff he defeated every strong code every power every capability at calvary but god needs somebody to get some grit about them and stand up and say devil i'm accepting the challenge i'm not laying down i'm not giving up i'm gonna fight for my mind i'm gonna fight for my deliverance i'm not giving up oh come on somebody somebody needs to fight there's nothing on the outside of that complex everybody likes you god made you to be that way to be short to be tall to be chubby to be skinny god created you that way but the devil wants to take what god meant for good and turn it into evil oh that's where the complex is god made you with a certain personality that can fit a certain gift that god gave you oh god places gifts in each and every one of our lives well this is going south but here we are god places gifts in each and every one of our lives but he places certain personalities to fit those gifts so you can't just lay down and see my wish i was like so and so i wish i could sing like that one wish i could preach like that one god didn't make you to preach like that one the shame like that one god made you to whip upon the devil with that character and personality that god gave you but the devil would like to take that personality and turn it into a complex take that personality instead of being a leader you're a bully this is the way it's going instead of being a follower to follow a husband or to follow your pastor now you're following the things of the world we've got to fight to keep our liberty we've got to fight and say no devil you're not taking what god gave me my personality god had picked for me my stature god handpicked for me brother branham says he knew your eye color before the foundation of the world he knew your stature he knew your hair color he knew this and he knew that he also said he has a picture of you god placed you on earth for a special purpose don't give up that purpose for the lives of the devil don't give you that purpose for a complex don't give up that purpose for anxiety but fight to keep that purpose that god has given you you may say i'm a nobody god's equipped you remember the story of the little wash woman that saved up all of her money and she rented a little building a little stable i believe and she was going to have a revival as she did all she could she got some flyers printed up and she was handing out the flyers and the people were mounting up those flowers and throwing it down she was getting discouraged the devil was trying to plague her mind saying you're out of the will of the lord you're not doing nothing for god but she didn't give up she stayed there and fight george we're in a fight we're on a battleground you don't have to give up any inch of ground the devil's trying to take from you the devil was trying to take away her joy but she gave out another flower and there was a young boy with hair down to him down past his eyes brother branham says and he said i can't read ma'am what's that say and she said there's a church there's some services going on at that stable you're welcome to come it's happening these certain nights at this certain time you need to come down to this meeting and that night at that church service nobody came but that god called minister got up oh i'm still thankful there's god called ministers in this last day that's willing to stand against the odds and preach the truth as that man started to preach started the preacher nobody was even there but that young boy walked into that to that stable sat down and something struck his heart something struck him he came to the altar and gave his life to christ you may say brother josh what's up with this story that young boy was dwight l moody brother branham says he won a million souls to christ and that little wash woman was responsible for all of those souls it was somebody that didn't look special didn't look important but she had a purpose come on somebody she had a purpose that god gave her and she was responsible for 1 million souls oh my you may just win one soul the best soul may go across the ocean to africa and wind souls to christ you're responsible for it the testimony that god gave you can win somebody to christ you may have a testimony that i don't got so you can reach people i can't reach we go through things that are in our life for a purpose all things work together according to his purpose oh hallelujah you see me as an evangelist can reach people on the sean can reach but he is a pastor can reach people i can't reach as an evangelist we're all working together for one purpose that's jesus christ for one purpose that's to destroy strongholds in people's lives you may say i'm not a preacher god hasn't called you to be a preacher well i can't think god maybe didn't call you to sing but he's called you for his purpose he's called you for a special purpose you may say you don't know what i've been through you don't know what i've done that don't matter all things work together god's going to use your past maybe to win somebody the christ you all know the story of jonah remember we say john is a is a runaway prophet he went to he was supposed to go to nineveh went to tarshish what happened he got thrown out of the boats and then and a well came in and ate him and he came and spit the well spit jonah out at nineveh but you know what happened the people looked at that well and say wow that's our god right there god used his mistake or used what we think his backsliding for god's good and because of that the people didn't get saved by the well god but got saved because of the god of jehovah that jonah was bringing to them his past brought an entire city to christ your past mistakes your testimonies can bring somebody to christ can't bring a deliverance oh they can look at jonah and see what happened there says my backslid i didn't obey the commission of the lord but the same god that had mercy on me is the same god that can have mercy on your souls and you can you maybe be able to say i once was bound to pornography i once was bound to this i once was bound to that but the same god that set me free can set you free but we need somebody to be satisfied in the calling that god has given you well i may be just a young person god's given you a calling oh hope this is okay tonight but god needs somebody to be satisfied what happens if i got out of my calling and tried to be a pastor now there's a calling that ain't being fulfilled come on somebody or somehow a pastor tried getting out of his calling and to get into my calling there's a calling the name fulfilled god's called us for special callings oh my but anyways we go through trials in our lives to see what we're made of to see where our faith is anchored at if our faith is anchored in our good looks that's going to fade one day if our faith is anchored in the pastor the pastor may backslide one day we've seen many pastors in this last day that fell away and people's faith was anchored in the pastor instead of the word of god and they fell away with him where's our faith anchored at but we go through trials and they'll see where our faith is but i believe there's some people in this building that can stand up and say i may be in a challenge right now but i've been through some past challenges and that's created the faith that i can say this little thing i'm going through it's nothing for my god i've been through some hard times i've been through some testing times but i can stand in here and say my god is able oh my god is able remember the story of the shoot of my woman the shoot of my woman wasn't able to have a son and god came and miraculously gave her a son she wished she was going through a challenge she wanted the baby she wanted to have their so bad the the women are created to be mothers but she felt like she couldn't fulfill her purpose oh let me say this the devil can never destroy the purpose in your life before the foundation of the world god knew she was going to have a baby and here she is in her challenge thinking she can't fulfill her purpose but nothing the devil can put in her mind put in her body do whatever he wanted to do could destroy the purpose that was on her life and nothing the devil can throw on your mind and try to say you're a son of his nothing can destroy the purpose that god has placed in your life he may come and say you're one of my daughters your serpent's hate but if god's called you there's nothing the devil can do to destroy that seed oh nothing he can do to destroy that seed i'm sure the devil thought he was going to destroy jonah but god had a purpose for jonah and nothing could destroy that seed oh hallelujah so the shooter my woman wanted the baby then god came and the prophet came and spoke the the words of life over her and she got a baby and now because of that challenge she's coming up to another challenge her baby's now taken away it died but since she had been through a challenge before she knew the same god that brought her out of this challenge can bring her through this challenge you don't go through trials in vain you don't go through hard times in vain god's equipping you with the faith to go through another trial so go what does the bible say he won't put nothing or more on us than we can bear god knows what he's doing your confidence hating your ability your confidence hate to be in your mind your confidence is in the word of god i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you yeah i'll be with you until the end of the world you're engraved in the palm of my hand i've seen the righteous forsaken but i've never seen his seed begging for bread it's the word of god we'll put our confidence in it's not my ability david could stand up and say you're a giant you've got a sword and a shield and a spear and i've got nothing but a slingshot but the battle's not mine it's the lord i've been through a challenge a bear trying to take me one time but god brought me through a lion trying to take me one time but god brought me through and the same god you know somebody that brought me through those challenges is the same god that's gonna bring me through this challenge the battle's not mine but it's the lord's he couldn't say that if he didn't have faith in jehovah he couldn't have faith in jehovah unless he seen god personally oh what does a trial do a trial puts you in a situation where you see god personally when we was first married there was times we didn't have no money we didn't have money for our bills we knew we knew that our loan was due well we hadn't paid it that month so i called the bank and says can i put i was going to ask if we could push it up a couple of weeks and we was going to try to get some money it was a challenge that we were going through but we wasn't word we was praying and seeking god we called the bank and the bank says it's already paid for the month that's the challenge that we went through that god showed me personally and loretta that god has a purpose for the things we go through another time we knew we had a certain amount of the bank we called to see how much was in there to make sure and it was doubled well i don't know how to explain it but all i know is jesus christ is never going to leave me never going to forsake me but he's going to be with me to the end of the world i may not understand why i'm going through this hard time but god's given me a testimony oh we like the testimony but we don't like going through the tests but you have to have the testimony or the test to have the testimony we have to have that oh hallelujah but they're shooting my woman she was going up to the prophet and the prophet was going to send his servant and then the woman says no i don't want the servant i want to talk to elijah but she had faith she went up to elijah and elijah says all is well with your husband all as well all is well with you all as well then god says okay i want to challenge your faith here all is well with your son all is well she knew if she could just get in the presence of the one that gave her a promise come on somebody if you can just get in the presence of the god that saved your life you can see your healing you could see your deliverance the same god that saved your soul is the same god that can come down and fill you or and heal your body fill your loved ones with the holy ghost it's the same gods hallelujah all is well with my boy all is well i'm in the same presence and we know what happened the prophet went and god raised the boy from the dead it was because of a challenge that created the faith in her life that she knew if she could just get in that presence that all things are possible you're seeing it's not our ability the world of fire it's not our strength that this bride is in a in a bride's revival it's god it's not our ability and god has sent us through some trials to make sure we're not going to get tired out in the middle of the battle to make sure we're not going to get worn out in the middle of the battle you go when you join the military you go to boot camp what are they doing they're equipping your body with them strength so that you're not going to get tired out on the battlefield they go through challenges they got to run a little bit they got to run with their pack on they gotta run with the rifle they're equipping them with some challenges that's gonna prepare them for the upcoming battle oh and the guy and god sends us through some hard times to equip us with some battles ahead for some battles ahead brother branham tells us the story how when he used to box his trainer was called six seconds myth he said he was the roughest man he had ever met he'd be hitting on him hitting on him hitting on him and he said but abraham would stop and see my you're about to kill me while you're being so rough on me his trainer stop and he says no matter how athletic you are how strong you are for your size how trained you are those those licks stop the blood and you're going to get in the ring and take a lick and you're going to be knocked out for the count but i'm equipping your body with some blows so that whenever you get in the ring your body is equipped to take some blows and when the other ones take a blow and it's out for the count you can get back up come on somebody we've been equipped when others go through some trials and they're down for the counts you can get back up why you've been through some hard times you've been through some trials but you're standing on this side of the trial saying my god is able my god has been good to me hallelujah his his his purple his trainer had a purpose for those challenges had a purpose hallelujah and if you're still on this earth you've got a purpose there's nothing the devil can do to ever destroy that purpose if you look at the three hebrew boys i know this is simple tonight so hope it's okay the three hebrew boys were left alone and felt like in the fiery furnace for standing up for what they believe god is going to make sure that you've got faith in the word of god he's going to make sure that you know what you're talking about and so these three human boys young people they weren't adults they were young people but they had witnessed something on the inside of their life that they wasn't going to bow down to the image of that day they wasn't going to bow down to the spirits of that day and uh and the king had told him we're going to play the music and you're to bow down to this image but these three ruby boys says no king no king our god is able to deliver us and even if he don't we're not going to bow that's some faith right there knowing that god had everything under control and as they were going into the fiery furnace you remember the branham dramatizes it one looks back and says that you prayed up oh i'm prayed up the other one looks back or you prayed up oh yes i'm prayed up the circumstance didn't take away their joy the trial didn't take away their praise the hard times didn't take away their faith but that hard time was giving them another testimony and now their testimony we can point back to in that faith just like your trials can give faith for somebody else going through a hard time come out somebody my grandma her platelets were low and she went through hard times her body she struggled and struggled when god healed her that gave a testimony so that somebody else can look back and say if god did it for julian martin god can do it for me come on somebody if god healed you of cancer god can do it for the next person don't be ashamed of your testimony don't be ashamed for what god has done for you hallelujah they felt like they're alone in that fiery furnace but as they got in the heat of the battle that's when god showed up he wanted to make sure they were going to stand and if they stood for him he was going to stand for them and if you stand for god god will stand for you in every trial in every circumstance whatever you go through god knows what he's doing and you see the king this trial was the witness to the king that god was alive the very one that was sending them through trials let me say this the co-workers you work with may be may be terrible to you but the ways you live can be a witness that there is a god what did the king say did y'all throw three men in the fire how come i see four and the fourth one looks like the son of the living gods the trial produced a testimony and a witness to the very one that was putting them in that trial oh you look at daniel 3 and 25 and he answered and said lo i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of god you notice they were still in the trial you notice that jesus our god didn't come and take them out of the trial he didn't come and take them out of the furnace he came on was with him in the furnace god may not come and take you how did that furnace take you out of that trial but he what he will do is he's never going to leave you he's going to come and be right there in every circumstance oh we know how brother branham tells us how that the angels were up looking and says have you seen what's going on down there god there's some three believers that they're about to throw in the fiery furnace and what did god say oh i know i've been watching them if he knows every hair that's on your head knows when a sparrow falls knows when this happens you think he's going to take his eye off of you come on somebody i'm trying to uplift your faith you may go through some challenges but god's never going to leave you god's never going to forsake you he's going to be with you right there here yeah i've been watching them and i'm about to go down there and as we stand in there wormwood came up it says god you want me to go down there i can do this and i can do that no wormwood you stay there another angel came up i said god do you want me to go down there i'll do this and i'll do that he says no this is a man-sized job oh he's i'm gonna go down myself what happened in this last day we didn't just get an angel but we got christ himself christ is in the midst of the furnace with you christ is in the midst of the lions then with you oh come on somebody we didn't just get an angel we got god himself in the fiery furnace with us don't be afraid to stand up for what you believe in don't be afraid to stand on the promises of god the promises of god are yea in amen that means so be it it may not look like i'm healed but the promises are so be it by your stripes i'm healed i may not look any better but this is a challenge that god has given me oh hallelujah to work on my testimony hallelujah hope this is okay tonight so who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed yeah that's past tense in other words you've seen my arm before you can see it again just believe the reports who have believed our report past tense and whom has the arm of the lord been revealed past tense i brought you through some trials i brought you through some hard times and i can do it again it's a challenge to see what you've been to see what you're made of you see the arm of the lord is the strength of the lord it's the power of god you look at luke 1 49 for he that is mighty have done to me great things in his holy name his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation he has showed strength with his arm you look at isaiah 62 and 8 the lord has sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength psalm 71 17 and 7 show thy marvelous loving kindness hold thou not save us by thy right hand psalms 89 and 13 that was the mighty arm and strong is thy hand oh you look at psalms 98 and 1 a psalm o sing unto the lord a new song for have done marvelous things his right hand and his holy arm has gotten the victory what am i trying to say that's the strength of the lord if the arm of the lord has been revealed to you that's the power of the almighty god that can heal you that can that can bring you through these trials and he's asking a question here you know brother branham says says this here and god hiding himself in simplicity who have believed the report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed he says let me read it again now closely who hath believed or report questioned and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed in other words if you believed a report then the arm of the lord is revealed but first you got to put your faith into action oh hallelujah god ain't just going to come and bring you out of that trial you've got something to do you've got to take the faith and put it into action and say devil i may be in a hard time but i'm not giving up you got to put your faith into action and this here i believe is talking to born again believers you look at ephesians 2 and 8 for by grace are you saved through faith so the very first step of being a christian is believing them the arm of the lord is being revealed but it's only through the holy ghost can you see the arm of the lord revealed personally not just see the arm of the lord he didn't say i'm going to show the arm of the lord but he says the arm of the lord is going to be revealed in a personal way and what happens whenever you get the holy ghost the arm of the lord is personally revealed you look at you look at the children of israel they have seen the manna come from heaven you see they've seen the water come out of a rock the the red sea was split open they had seen the arm of the lord but it personally revealed in their lives they had never seen it so when they came to the promised land what does the bible say they brought an evil report when they went into the promised land they came back with an evil report but there was joshua and caleb that came back with another report so now there's two reports they had to choose which part they was going to believe they got to put their faith into a report and let me say this you're going to put your faith in the doctor's report or in god's report you're going to put your faith in the devil's report that says you're not good enough that says you're not worthy or you're going to put your report in god's report or put your faith in god's report that he says he loves you but he's here for you you've got to put your faith into something but how come joshua and caleb going to come back with the report and says the land's ours the arm of the lord was revealed to him oh hallelujah what happened they came back with the fruits they came back with the grapes the young ones didn't have the fruits of the spirit oh follow me follow me this evening joshua and caleb came back with the evidence of the new land which is a type of the holy ghost they came back with the fruits of the spirit the arm of the lord was revealed to them and they knew that the same god that gave them a promise is the same god that can give them their lands the other ones didn't have the fruits of the spirit oh so they couldn't believe the report they couldn't see the arm of the lord revealed to them but joshua and caleb says the arm of the lord's been revealed and i know that i can have my mountain i can have my inheritance i can have whatever god has given to me brother branham says is there a person here that has never been saved and say brother branham remember me i've never been born again he says i'm not listen you're not saved until you're born again my it puts it out there pretty plain another place you're not a christian until you've accepted christ and been born by the holy ghost a new creature anything less you're lost it questions and answers he says now the next question is it true you're not saved unless you receive the holy ghost he says there could take about a good five hour discussion on that when you accept christ as your savior and are then ready for baptism in water you have not yet been converted you're only believing unto repentance conversions means to be changed so without the holy ghost you never sing the arm of the lord revealed hope this is okay this evening you've never seen the strength of god personally you may say brother josh i've got the holy ghost when have i seen the arm of the lord revealed he took those habits away he changed her nature he broke the chains of those addictions that's the arm of the lord being revealed hope this is all coming together tonight acts one and eight but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you what is the arm of the lord the power of god so the holy ghost comes and reveals the power of god personally that's why i say it's a challenge who has believed the report i've done works in your life time after time after time you're going through another challenge but just believe the report hallelujah just believe the report brother branham says now you who once walked along with a great big cigar in your mouth everything or a bunch of cigarettes and you woman who once had short hair painted on a curve and wore shorts like that something screamed and you looked down there it was the word see it quickened you and you said no more shorts for me no more liquor for me no more lying for me no more stealing for me no more this no more that the spirit that raised him from the dead to welling in you will also bring your mortal bodies the dust of the earth into subjection it's the power of god that you can say no more drinking for me no more smoking no more lusting no more going to pornography what is it you've seen me mighty in battle i've done this for you and i can do it again if i saved you i can keep you if i filled you with the holy ghost i can heal your body how come daniel could say your king i may be going to the lion's den but god is with me he has seen god personally before so we can stand in that trial that's why men like ron spencer can stand up and say god's my healer he has seen the arm of the lord revealed durham martin within the midst of parkinson's he can stand up and say i believe the report of the lord god's my healer why he has been through some hard times and he's standing up and saying god's my healer oh how come job could say i know my redeemer liveth that's a boat statement he had seen the arm of the lord revealed how could moses could say i'll go to egypt and say i'm coming to take over he had seen the arm of the lord revealed oh it landed at times it looks hopeless but begum of the lord is there just believe the report brother branham says if god delivered you from sin how much more can he deliver you from your sickness he's able to change your if he's able to change your nature and make you a new person why would you fear about any sickness if he can save your soul change your nature change your motives change your ideas how much more can he change your sickness into health and put it right back to its place again where it belongs don't fear that cancer don't fear that sugar diabetes just have faith in the word of god if god saved your soul he can heal your body and take that take that sickness right back to where it belongs the sickness don't belong on your body the conflicts don't belong in your mind that anxiety don't belong in your mind it belongs where it came from that's the pits of hell let me tell you what does belong in your body that's the joy of god the peace of god the peace the passive all understanding that's your health come on somebody god needs somebody to accept the challenge oh he needs somebody to say i'm going to believe the report hallelujah i'm going to believe the report times may be rocky my loved ones may be lost but i believe in the report my sons and my daughters may be out paying the town red but i'm believing the reports we know the story of kimberly ware she has seen the arm of the lord personally revealed to her and now she knew that if god did it for her she can he can do it for her brother kimberly where was i as a young lady from louisiana her brother justin was in a rock band in the drugs into this and into that but she kept believing that her brother was going to be saved and brother wayne lawson was down preaching on a wednesday night a wednesday night where most people come to church out of duty oh my but this young lady came to church with an expectation just see what god would do when you come with an expectation we come out of duty too many times if we come out of expectation we can see god come in a mighty way service after service after service oh hallelujah god will do it to you do it for you if you come believing and expecting so this young lady on a wednesday night there was a prayer line this young lady went up to the prayer line it says i want to see my brother saved justin is that home and then the service i believe was going to about midnight a lot of us would have a cow on a wednesday night if the church was going till midnight but anyways it was about midnight justin where was in bed something woke him up i can tell you what woke him up the arm of the lord the arm of the lord woke him up he got up and says i'm lost i'm going to hell i'm not ready i'm not ready to see god so he ran to his sister's bedroom she was gone because she was at church oh my he runs to his parents bedroom they're at church too he says i miss the rapture he runs to the neighbor's house which is also about church and we go i miss the rapture he runs to another one they're at church so he's so panicked he says i need to get right with god he goes flying to the church he runs over a fence and his truck pulls into the parking lot and dies and the deacons come out running grabs him takes him into the church then the arm of the lord was revealed to him personally not just for his sister not just for his mama not just for his daddy but because of a young lady that wasn't going to take no for an answer you your prayers can bring salvation for your loved ones just believe the report of the lord she didn't give up for her brother and now he's married has a kid i believe he's standing on the promises of god the arm of the lord was revealed to him because there was a young lady that was in a challenge that says no i'm not giving up we can go through testimony after testimony my brother caleb my brother caleb went through some hard times but god came and saved his soul we was having a meeting at our church and he was in a gang and he was he was supposed to be somewhere and doing something pretty bad but he didn't want to do it and he said i ain't doing that and he was scared because the gang was going to come after him so he believed the only safe place was that church and let me say the only safe place is in church hallelujah so we're having a meeting he comes in the church he's sitting there the preachers preaching preaching i believe it was a friday night you see all things work together for the good what if we wouldn't have had meetings on that friday night where would caleb would have win all things work together the pastors are more spiritual than some people think but anyways there were some meetings that weekend caleb comes and is at the altar weeping his way to calvary till after midnight it was the arm of the lord my mama never gave up on him my daddy never gave up on him they kept saying that he's gonna be saved and then the arm of the lord was revealed to caleb now he has the holy ghost he's married and has four kids i think a bunch of them but god did a work for his life grandma d grandma dolores and rebecca's mom god did a work for her life and rebecca wasn't going to give up on her mama she knew that the same god that saved her soul can save her mama oh when everybody else gave up on her there was somebody that says i'm believing the report of the lord oh don't give up on your loved ones don't give up on your children don't give up on your parents don't give up on your brothers and your sisters believe the report of the lord and watch the arm or the strength of the lord mighty in action mighty in battle the third polling just for the prophet the third poll is operating inside of the brides oh hallelujah well you remember brother and i must tell them the story of the three squirrels hope this is okay tell them the story of the squirrels at hattie wright's house i believe and hallie wright was hearing the report and she stood up and says that's nothing but the truth she had experienced the power of god before and since she had believed the report before she's saying this is of god i'm going to believe it again that's nothing but the truth and see that's what happens when there's somebody saying amen in church they're hearing the report of the lord and saying amen so be it that's the truth what that preacher is talking about is for me what the pastor is talking about is for me amen so be it that's nothing but the truth hallelujah so she said that's nothing but the triple branham stop and he says you speak the word so no longer is this creative power inside of the prophet but because it was taken by faith this power us now with howdy right he says you speak the word whatever you have need of you're poor you ask for a million dollars it'll be right here you're your sister i believe was a i believe and she said you speak the word for her and she'll get well whatever you have need of you know my she wasn't selfish she wasn't selfish she says i want my boys to be saved those boys were over there laughing at him that's saying that they're making fun of it but she says i want my boys to be saved and she says hey brother brandon says i give them to you those boys fell over gave their hearts to christ that's not an emotion that's not a sensation that's the strength of the lord being revealed that's an impossible situation those boys didn't want nothing to do with god but it was a prayer of a mama it was a prayer of obama that says these boys are mine you gave me a promise god and i'm not going to let the devil take him away from me and that's just not for hatty right that's for the bride you've got the power to say satan get out of my body you've got the power to say satan you're not plaguing my mind any longer you've got the power to say satan i'm accepting the challenge he's the same yesterday today and forever this ain't my this ain't my my my words it's the word of the lord brother branham says i'm thankful tonight for supernatural the holy ghost god's flame a fire who could come down in the human heart and burn out sin unbelief don't harm the person but to purchase him there it is daniel the holy ghost purges you as he was talking about earlier it purges you it makes it makes you grow stronger more faith here comes tonight he came down into a human body to drive out the power of cancer of that tumor of that tuberculosis with fire the heavenly holy spirit a fire falling from god out of heaven he says my that's no mystery if he can burn out sin how much more can he burn out cancer by the same holy ghost what's the holy ghost the arm of the lord so the same arm that saved you from sin is the same arm that can heal you of cancer heal you of sugar diabetes heal you of whatever it is it's the same power the same authority oh how much more can i burn out cancer by the same holy ghost but we get it in our mind that we have to have a certain preacher here to be healed we have to have a certain preacher here heal for our prayers to be answered you don't have to have a certain preacher here it's the it's god that heals the body it's god that saves the soul it's god that fills with the holy ghost it's god that saves your children we don't need a powerhouse evangelist we need god and i believe where two or three are gathered in his name he'll be in our midst of the hour that's why we preach the message in its fullness because we're not backing up our the message god himself is backing up the message you're not backing up your faith god's backing up your faith if you can just have faith in the word of god it's god backing it up brother branham says in the end we want to then we want to let you know too we're don't try to say this now the evangelist is here he's the one that's going to do the healing well we let you know that your pastor we let you know that your pastor is a man of god just as a much authority to pray for the sick as me anybody else or roberts tommy osborne any of them than them men that's on the field today praying for the sick your pastor has the same authority come on somebody we don't need brother branham here to have a prayer line and for you to be healed we need the same god that was in brother branham's meeting to be here hallelujah but you've got to believe the report of the lord remember the woman had the issue of blood she had tried doctor after doctor after doctor her faith was starting to get weary but christ not a preacher come on somebody not a preacher not a prophet not this one not that one but christ walk by her way service after service christ walks by your way but since we're not aware who's in our presence come on somebody we come to church and we're not aware that the same god that spoke flies into existence in moses moses day is the same god here the same god that healed and raised up a dead man for jesus is the same god that's here the same god that was in brother branham's meetings is the same god here but we're not aware of her too many times because we're not willing to fight past the mind battles oh hallelujah fight pass the mind battles but this woman says i'm going to get my healing i'm not passing up my opportunity this is my time my service my moment and she was willing to get on her hands and knees and crawl till she got to the master and she touched the hymn of his garments jesus stopped and he said who touched me something touched me virtue went out of my body now the the disciples rebuked him jesus there's people everywhere see he preached up and says oh no there's a certain one somebody touched me there was somebody the bible says it was a certain woman there's a certain woman she wasn't just a special woman but it was somebody that had faith she was certain that if she could get to jesus her condition could be made well and i believe there's a certain woman in this last day inside of faith tabernacle on a sunday afternoon that's certain that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever it was a certain woman she wasn't her faith wasn't looking up the doctor's report her faith was in god's hallelujah and we know what happened she got her healing she tried physician after physician but one moment a moment with dr jesus made her well in one moment with dr jesus you may say what was the secret she had to recognize who was in her midst oh everybody else didn't recognize it but she recognized it you remember i believe it was simon that had jesus over to make fun of him brother branham says and i believe it was it was a prostitute that recognized that was jesus the preachers didn't recognize it the priest didn't recognize it this this one about she wasn't even invited to church invited to that moment but she recognized that the power the presence that was inside of that man can change her life and she was willing to sacrifice all she was saying i believe the reports of the lord and she was willing to crawl her way to jesus feet and what happened is she started to wash his feet with her tears and dry it with her hair what was that it was reverence she was willing to submit herself to christ are you willing to submit that sickness to christ submit that complex to christ submit that anxiety to christ it ain't yours in the first place you don't gotta hang on to it it's the box of rattlesnakes you don't gotta accept it you don't get to accept that diabetes or whatever it is jesus christ has made you well just be aware who's in your presence who's in your midst someone rebuked him and says you know who this is oh yeah i know who this is a predestinated woman oh hallelujah and i'm sure the devil will love to plague your mind and says you're not good enough christ knows what you've done he don't know it once you repent it's in the sea of his forgetfulness but what he does know is what he'd done for you come on somebody quit looking at your past the blood has made you worthy the blood has made you worthy for every inheritance that god has given you in this last day the rapture is for you a body changes for you your past has nothing to do with you anymore all things have become new but you got to give up your past that's a hard thing to do is to give up your past the devil would like to come and torment your mind with condemnation with this and with that god don't even remember it but you got to submit it to him say god i'm giving you my past as the musicians come sorry for going so long tonight but there's a report that we got to believe isaiah 53 and 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes were healed mark 16-18 they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover james 5 14 is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church let them pray for him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord whose report are you going to believe the report of the lord has been put in front of you this evening you've got a choice you're

happening on the outside she was crying and crying and she heard her knock on the door saying honey honey she said go away you forgot to get me ice cream they opened the door and said honey we may have forgot your ice cream but god caused it to hell outside so that we can have ice for your ice cream you may be going through a hard time your parents may look like they forsaken you your loved

quote that i thought would be helpful maybe to you tonight so i wanted to read it brother branham says any men or women that ever make real warriors in the kingdom of god is perfectly unconscious to their faith he said you keep trying to test your faith well i wonder if i've got enough to do this see have i got faith he said don't test your faith everybody say don't test your faith god said so do it anyhow god said so have you ever tasted tested your faith whether you had enough faith to come to the meeting or not tonight did you test your faith to see if you had enough faith to eat your supper tonight have you tested do you think you'll have to fast a while and test your faith to see if you've got enough faith to drive your car home certainly not it's just automatically you believe it and that's the way you believe healing believe anything that god said don't just don't fight at it and shake at it and rebuke the devil every minute just accept it and go on that's it there's nothing to be alarmed about you listening nothing be alarmed about god said so and that settles it so we just go ahead just go live life go through life go ahead knowing it's going to happen just forget about it hello forget about the trouble forget whatever you forget about symptoms forget about what doctor says forget about whatever just forget about it see god said it that proves it i believe it that settles it that's all you have to do aren't you glad for that that's all you have to do just rest in god just rest in his promise if you're needing healing just rest if you're needing uh deliverance just rest what whatever you're needing just rest in god can you say amen god's gonna bring it through that's what makes real warriors the prophet said can you say man are you resting
