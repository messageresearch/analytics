[36:32] No,
[36:33] you see
[36:35] a limo
[36:38] damn guard. It could be easier for this.
[36:53] Yeah,
[36:56] James is going to be my interpreter here
[36:59] because I don't speak fluent Navajo.
[37:04] Okay, we'll see if I can get through
[37:06] this.
[37:09] Today we gather in honor and remember my
[37:11] mom, Vivian G. Woody. So coincidentally,
[37:14] today is also the 30th anniversary of my
[37:16] Chase passing, her dad.
[37:19] Uh my mom was born on December 16th,
[37:22] 1956 in Winsow, Arizona to Lawrence and
[37:24] Louise Gordy.
[37:26] She was Kia Ani, the towering house
[37:29] clan, born for Twidditchen, the
[37:30] Bitterwater clan. Her maternal
[37:33] grandfathers were the milling goats clan
[37:36] and her paternal grandfathers were
[37:38] Hushkan the Yakafu or banana clan.
[37:55] Gordy,
[38:07] many ghost family.
[38:17] She was the fourth oldest of seven
[38:19] children. and anyone who knew her and
[38:21] knew she carried that role well. Strong,
[38:24] dependable, dependable and always
[38:26] looking out for others.
[38:43] She began high school in Tuba City at
[38:46] Tuba City High School and later
[38:47] transferred to Cookanino High School
[38:49] where she began or she played basketball
[38:51] and graduated in 1975.
[38:54] Even after high school, her love of
[38:56] basketball never faded. Some of my
[38:59] earliest memories are of traveling to
[39:01] basketball tournaments all over the
[39:03] reservation. While she played, I usually
[39:05] ended up watching the other players
[39:07] children.
[39:22] 1975.
[39:44] She had big hopes that I would love
[39:46] basketball as much as she did. So, in
[39:49] third grade, she signed me up for
[39:50] pee-wee basketball. It I spent the
[39:53] entire season running up and down the
[39:55] court with my hands in my pockets.
[39:58] [laughter]
[39:59] One day, I finally got the ball. I I
[40:02] remember all the kids running towards me
[40:04] and my mom yelling at me to pass it. I
[40:08] panicked and threw the ball, not really
[40:10] at anyone, just away from me.
[40:14] [laughter]
[40:15] Somehow it went in. I made a basket.
[40:19] It was the only basket I ever made in my
[40:22] basketball career. [laughter]
[40:24] And my mom was so excited. It also was
[40:28] the last time I ever played basketball.
[40:30] It just wasn't my thing. But I love that
[40:33] she never forced me to keep playing. She
[40:35] always knew when to encourage her
[40:37] children and when to let us be
[40:39] ourselves.
[41:21] In the 1980s, my mom worked as a
[41:23] prosecutor for the Western Navo Agency
[41:25] and later went into private practice.
[41:28] After that, she became the security
[41:30] supervisor at the Black Mesa coal mine.
[41:32] And she eventually moved our family to
[41:34] Phoenix for a few years before returning
[41:36] home to Cameron, Arizona.
[41:53] Thank you.
[42:01] Once back in Cameron, she was voted in
[42:03] as a Cameron chapter president, a role
[42:05] she took seriously, always working to
[42:07] serve her community. She had several
[42:10] jobs before being hired as a medical
[42:12] dispatcher for Sacred Mountain Medical
[42:14] Service. She dedicated 10 years there
[42:16] before retiring. Even in retirement, she
[42:19] continued to give up herself, traveling
[42:22] to Washington and California to help
[42:24] care for her grandchildren.
[42:38] for
[42:56] my mom also had a beautiful gift. She
[42:58] loved to sing. She sang often at
[43:01] funerals because people would request
[43:02] her. She travels so much for singing
[43:05] that my little sister Rebecca used to
[43:06] tease her and say she was on tour.
[43:10] But she didn't do it for recognition.
[43:13] She did it because she loved to sing and
[43:15] because she knew her voice brought
[43:16] comfort to people when they needed it
[43:18] most.
[43:50] above all else. She loved her family.
[43:57] She loved her grandchildren deeply and
[43:59] later her great-grandchildren bought her
[44:01] even more joy.
[44:02] She is survived by her four children,
[44:05] eight grandchildren, five great
[44:07] grandchildren, her two sisters, two
[44:09] brothers, and countless nieces and
[44:11] nephews who were all touched by her
[44:13] love.
[44:34] My mom will be missed every single day,
[44:36] but she will be remembered for her
[44:38] encouragement, her kindness, and her
[44:40] welcoming spirit. She made people feel
[44:43] seen, valued, and loved. Her legacy
[44:46] lives on in all of us. We miss her
[44:48] deeply, and we will love her forever.
[45:12] Uh we change kind of
[45:33] Robson
[45:38] church
[45:40] pastors.
[45:45] James.
[45:56] Thank you.
[46:01] God bless you this morning.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; I need to learn how to say that in
[46:08] Navajo.
[46:15] Praise the Lord. Um,
[46:18] I'm humbled uh to be here before you
[46:21] this morning
[46:27] &gt;&gt; and I I count it a great privilege. It's
[46:30] a great honor and soul for the family.
[46:33] Just thank you very much for this
[46:35] privilege.
[46:45] And so for the family and friends and
[46:47] the visitors, um we welcome you to our
[46:51] church. It's just a place where we
[46:54] worship the Lord and we want you to be
[46:56] uh to feel welcome here.
[47:12] We in our church here, we call everybody
[47:14] brother and sister. And we believe that
[47:17] if you claim the Lord Jesus as your
[47:21] savior, that you're our brother and
[47:24] you're our sister. And so this morning I
[47:26] might refer to
[47:28] sister Vivian. Um, Ananas when he met
[47:34] Paul, he complained to the Lord,
[47:36] "Forgive me. I'll give you plenty of
[47:38] time to translate it."
[47:40] He complained to the Lord. He said,
[47:42] "Lord, I this guy is a persecutor of the
[47:44] church." And the Lord told him, "I'm
[47:47] going to use him. He's been converted."
[47:49] And then when Ananas met Saul for the
[47:53] first time, he called him brother. Saul
[47:57] and so we call each other brother and
[47:59] sister. here. So, welcome brothers and
[48:01] sisters.
[48:34] We met by the way Lima said I get 30
[48:37] minutes so that you get 30 minutes too.
[48:40] Okay. Okay.
[48:43] Um we met Sister Vivian July or August
[48:47] of last year or this year and um she she
[48:52] would sit right about there seventh row
[48:55] or so back there and she would worship
[48:58] the Lord and I didn't know who she was a
[49:01] lady who came in started coming to
[49:02] church and then I got a text it was
[49:05] September 5th you texted me at le said
[49:07] hey my mom's going to your church
[49:10] and I said well we only two Native
[49:12] Americans going to the church. So, it
[49:14] was obvious which one it was. I said,
[49:17] "Vivian?" She said, "Yeah, that's that's
[49:19] my mom." And it was a I've known Lima
[49:22] for probably 20 years. And so, it was a
[49:24] great privilege to fellowship or to
[49:27] worship with her mother here in our
[49:29] church.
[50:04] And you can tell a lot about a person uh
[50:07] by the way they worship in church. Some
[50:10] people come to church for the food. Some
[50:14] people come to church to see their
[50:15] friends or because they feel guilty if
[50:19] they don't go to church. Uh but Vivian,
[50:22] you could tell, was a what we would call
[50:25] a true worshipper. Uh when the songs
[50:29] were being sung, she raised her hand,
[50:31] she sang, she liked our old songs that
[50:34] we sing. When the word was going forth,
[50:37] she participated and enter in. And so
[50:40] she didn't come to church uh just to be
[50:43] seen or to have food or for a guilt
[50:47] reason. She came because she loved the
[50:48] Lord Jesus and she came to worship and
[50:51] and you could tell that
[51:30] And so I'd like to read out of the book
[51:32] of Job this morning, the 14th chapter.
[51:41] U we'll just read a few verses. I put
[51:43] the Navajo version up here. I don't know
[51:45] if it's a good version, but if you read
[51:48] Navajo,
[51:50] um there it is. And
[51:52] uh it might seem odd to read the
[51:55] scriptures at a funeral, but bear with
[51:57] me. I think we'll understand by the end.
[52:00] [snorts]
[52:20] The Bible says in Job 14, the first
[52:22] verse, we'll read the first and second
[52:24] verses. It says, "Man that is born of a
[52:27] woman is of few days and full of
[52:31] trouble. He cometh forth like a flower
[52:34] and is cut down. He fleth also as a
[52:38] shadow and continuth not seeing his days
[52:42] are determined. This is the fifth verse.
[52:44] The number of his months are with thee.
[52:47] Thou hast appointed his bounds that he
[52:50] cannot pass. That's verse one, two, and
[52:52] five.
[53:49] If you know the story of Job, he in this
[53:54] time in his life is in the midst of a
[53:57] major trial.
[54:08] He's lost all of his children. He's lost
[54:12] all of his economy, all his money. He's
[54:16] lost his wife. She says, "Why don't you
[54:19] curse God and die?" And then he lost his
[54:23] own health. He became sick and he was he
[54:26] was scraping boils. I don't know how you
[54:28] would say it in a different language,
[54:29] but he was just his body was uh sick.
[54:56] So he looks around and he says, "Man
[54:58] that's born a woman, few days and full
[55:02] of trouble." And then go ahead.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; And you could see why he would say that
[55:14] he's in the midst of trouble.
[55:17] And he then goes and he says a flower,
[55:22] a flower would come up and would flee
[55:25] and would can continue not and there'd
[55:29] be no hope for it. It's a flower. it it
[55:31] raised up and then it died.
[55:36] And then he makes an interesting
[55:38] statement. He doesn't stop there. I'm
[55:39] going to start preaching if I'm not
[55:40] careful.
[55:42] He makes
[55:58] Try to bear with me. Okay. Yeah.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; All right. So, he sees the flower and
[56:03] then in verse seven, he says there's
[56:06] hope of a tree if it be cut down that
[56:09] it'll rise again and the tender branch
[56:12] thereof will not cease. He says the root
[56:16] would die. The root would wax old in
[56:18] that tree and it but it but there's
[56:21] hope. There would be hope for a tree.
[56:40] In verse nine, he says, "Yet through the
[56:42] scent of water, it will bud." And and
[56:46] and basically that saying if it just
[56:48] could get a smell of water even though
[56:51] the tree had died, it was dead in the
[56:53] earth. The roots were, you know, leaves
[56:55] were gone. We look outside, all the
[56:56] leaves are gone. The tree is dead. He
[56:59] said, "But with a scent of water, it
[57:02] would bud again just by smelling water.
[57:23] And then in verse 10, he says this
[57:25] because Job looks around and he sees the
[57:27] flower dies. And it's kind of it's kind
[57:30] of interesting that as the flower dies
[57:32] in the fall, rain would come and that
[57:35] would be like the earth having a funeral
[57:37] for that flower that would die in the
[57:39] fall. And then he looks around and he
[57:42] sees the tree that would apparently die
[57:44] in the winter and the fall and and it's
[57:47] it's no leaves on it. It looks
[57:49] completely dead. If you looked at our
[57:50] trees out here on the property, they
[57:52] look dead.
[57:54] And but but Job says, "But there's
[57:56] hope." Like if they would just get a
[57:58] smell of water, they would rise again.
[58:00] And then he says, "Forgive me." And then
[58:02] he says this, "But man dies. He wastes
[58:06] away. He gives up the goat. And where is
[58:08] he? Where's he at? Verse 14, he says,
[58:12] "If a man die,
[58:14] shall he live again?" And he's crying
[58:16] out for like hope in his soul. He's
[58:18] like, "The tree dies and it comes back
[58:20] in the spring. The flower dies and it
[58:22] comes back in the spring. It would just
[58:24] smell water and it would come back." And
[58:26] verse 14, he says, "But a man dies,
[58:29] will he live again?"
[58:31] Go ahead.
[59:22] Praise the Lord.
[59:24] So, Job looks at the flower and the tree
[59:27] and he knows they didn't do anything to
[59:30] sin. They weren't born in sin like he
[59:33] was.
[59:35] they
[59:36] they were just natural in in their their
[59:40] growing and in their dying. But he
[59:43] looked at himself
[59:46] and the Bible says, David says this, "In
[59:49] sin did my mother conceive me." And then
[59:54] Paul would say, "We are born in sin and
[59:56] we're shaped in iniquity."
[59:59] So now, now Job looks at the flower.
[1:00:02] It's done nothing wrong. It dies, it
[1:00:04] comes back. He looks at the tree, it's
[1:00:06] done nothing wrong. It dies, it comes
[1:00:08] back. But he looks at himself
[1:00:11] and he sees a sinner because that's what
[1:00:13] he is.
[1:00:15] We all We all are, by the way. Did I
[1:00:18] just lose my mind?
[1:01:01] Your 30 minutes is up. Okay, I'm just
[1:01:03] kidding. I'm just kidding.
[1:01:07] But I'm trying to make a point here as
[1:01:10] concise as we can make it that
[1:01:13] Job had no hope, but he saw the flower
[1:01:16] with hope. But the flower had done
[1:01:17] nothing wrong. The tree had done nothing
[1:01:19] wrong. But Job was just born a sinner.
[1:01:21] He had lived a righteous life. There was
[1:01:23] nobody like him on the earth. But he
[1:01:25] still required a redeemer.
[1:01:29] He required an advocate. He required
[1:01:31] someone to to to
[1:01:34] intercede for him so that he could be
[1:01:38] raised up, so that he could resurrect.
[1:01:41] He's asking this question. Is there hope
[1:01:43] of a man? If a man dies, is there hope?
[1:01:46] If I die, do I have hope? Where's my
[1:01:48] hope at? If I die, I look at the flower.
[1:01:50] I look at the tree. I look at the
[1:01:51] bushes. They all have hope. I need
[1:01:55] somebody to be my advocate for me for
[1:01:58] that when I die, I can come back.
[1:02:02] Go ahead.
[1:02:38] So he
[1:02:40] this is chapter 14 and it takes him a
[1:02:43] while. He goes all the way to chapter 19
[1:02:47] and he's you know when you're in a trial
[1:02:49] some of you have lost children. I know I
[1:02:52] was talking to I think one of sister
[1:02:54] Vivian's sisters. I don't know where
[1:02:56] she's at this morning.
[1:02:58] But she had lost children also.
[1:03:02] And it's a painful thing. And you want
[1:03:04] to know like is there a hope?
[1:03:07] Is there hope? Like is there hope? Will
[1:03:09] you see your children? Will you see
[1:03:10] Vivian again? And the only way you have
[1:03:13] hope and the only way you have hope this
[1:03:16] morning to be like that flower, that
[1:03:18] tree that would die, that would go into
[1:03:19] the earth and and and resurrect and live
[1:03:22] again. The only way is if you accept
[1:03:25] that there has been a redeemer
[1:03:28] that came for you that resurrected first
[1:03:30] and in him you can live again. That's
[1:03:32] it. So Job is five chapters goes by and
[1:03:36] he gets to chapter 19 and he makes this
[1:03:38] this powerful statement. We'll read it
[1:03:40] here. Forgive me before I read it. You
[1:03:42] can go ahead. He says this.
[1:03:47] He says this. For I know that my
[1:03:48] redeemer lives,
[1:03:52] that he shall stand at the latter day
[1:03:54] upon the earth. And though after my skin
[1:03:59] worms destroy this body,
[1:04:02] he knows this body is going to get it's
[1:04:05] just going to get eaten up by skin
[1:04:06] worms. whatever it would be. He says,
[1:04:08] "Nevertheless,
[1:04:10] though that would happen, though my body
[1:04:13] would be destroyed, yet in my flesh I
[1:04:17] will see God.
[1:04:39] Chapter 19.
[1:05:21] And Job knows that through the scent of
[1:05:23] water, those natural things could live
[1:05:25] again. And he knows that through the sun
[1:05:30] s u n
[1:05:32] that life would come to botany that life
[1:05:35] would come to plants and those things.
[1:05:37] He knew that through the sun he could
[1:05:39] see that.
[1:05:41] And so he captures a revelation that God
[1:05:45] has sent an s o n over eternal life.
[1:05:50] And so he finally receives that as as
[1:05:55] the ultimatum presented to him that if
[1:05:58] you accept the son you will live again.
[1:06:35] And so life be life belongs to God and
[1:06:38] life belongs to God alone.
[1:06:41] And if you as as as a human being, as
[1:06:44] yourself,
[1:06:46] if you've allowed God's life
[1:06:49] to come into your life,
[1:07:08] If the Holy Spirit is in your soul
[1:07:12] and you die and you go down into the
[1:07:14] ground,
[1:07:16] how could you not rise again? It would
[1:07:19] be impossible that God could die. And if
[1:07:23] God is inside of you, how could you die?
[1:07:27] not die, you know, as as far as we're
[1:07:29] talking today, but how could you not
[1:07:32] resurrect again? How would it be
[1:07:34] possible that God could die? You could
[1:07:36] no more die than God could die if you've
[1:07:39] accepted his Holy Ghost into your heart.
[1:08:01] and no matter what I would say about
[1:08:03] Sister Vivian,
[1:08:05] uh, how it looked like she worshiped in
[1:08:07] church and how it looked like she was a
[1:08:10] Christian, her own testimony speaks for
[1:08:13] itself. her own testimony of how what
[1:08:16] we've heard already today, her own
[1:08:18] testimony of how he how she lived her
[1:08:20] life, how she was saved, how she
[1:08:25] accepted God's life. She accepted that
[1:08:28] no matter what I would say, her life
[1:08:30] speaks for itself.
[1:08:38] for
[1:08:55] I know it's a moment of sadness for us
[1:08:57] because we're going to miss her. We're
[1:09:00] certainly going to miss her here at
[1:09:01] Flagstaff Tabernacle.
[1:09:03] But the joy
[1:09:06] you see there's an uninvited guest here
[1:09:08] and that is death you know that's coming
[1:09:10] to this event and he's you know taken a
[1:09:14] fleshly life from us but there's a joy
[1:09:17] behind that knowing that we'll see her
[1:09:19] Yeah.
[1:09:49] She will rise as s as sure as the moon
[1:09:52] rises, as sure as the sun rises,
[1:09:56] she will rise again. There's the joy
[1:09:58] that we can take from this event that
[1:10:01] we're dealing with today.
[1:10:18] She lived this testimony. And I I want
[1:10:21] to speak to her children, her
[1:10:23] grandchildren, her nephews and nieces
[1:10:25] and family. The testimony she lived
[1:10:28] wasn't for us. It was for you.
[1:10:32] She lived that for you. She dragged you
[1:10:34] to church here. Well, I mean, she didn't
[1:10:36] drag you, but it looked like she dragged
[1:10:38] you sometimes. M she she she wanted her
[1:10:43] children and her nephews and her nieces
[1:10:45] and her family to have the life that she
[1:10:47] have because she knew she was going to
[1:10:49] be in this position one day. But she
[1:10:52] wanted to see when she rose to see you
[1:10:54] all again.
[1:11:21] You, we could say it like this. You were
[1:11:23] her purpose, her children and her
[1:11:25] family. She She wanted nothing more than
[1:11:28] for you to be Christians, to know the
[1:11:31] Lord Jesus as your personal savior.
[1:11:35] Eternal life. We have a saying here at
[1:11:37] the church is living for others. Eternal
[1:11:42] life isn't getting everything from
[1:11:43] others. Eternal life is serving living
[1:11:46] for others. And that's how Sister Vivian
[1:11:49] lived.
[1:12:07] and I hope this will you'll understand
[1:12:09] this in the way that I mean it. She
[1:12:11] lived her life for the clan that she
[1:12:14] had. She lived her life for the
[1:12:18] spiritual group that is stronger than
[1:12:22] any family blood that we would have is
[1:12:25] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:12:27] she lived her life
[1:12:30] for you all, for that family.
[1:12:47] In closing, I would read one more
[1:12:49] scripture in first Thessalonians. 1
[1:12:51] Thessalonians chapter 4. And I would
[1:12:54] just
[1:12:55] ask you, you know, grieving, you must go
[1:12:58] through that process. No, no problem. We
[1:13:00] we it's part of if you don't go through
[1:13:02] it, you'll actually become sick in your
[1:13:03] spirit. You must go through a grieving
[1:13:06] process. But know that at the end of
[1:13:08] that process, there's a light of eternal
[1:13:11] life that Vivian wanted each and every
[1:13:14] one of us to have in our souls.
[1:13:18] First Thessalonians
[1:13:29] and I'll close with this 1 Thessalonians
[1:13:32] 4:14. And it says, "For we which
[1:13:34] believe, for if we believe, excuse me,
[1:13:36] that Jesus died and rose again, even so
[1:13:39] them also which sleep in Jesus will God
[1:13:42] bring forth with him. For this we say
[1:13:45] unto you by the word of the Lord, that
[1:13:47] we which are alive and remain unto the
[1:13:50] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:13:51] them which are asleep. For the Lord
[1:13:55] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:13:57] shout, with the voice of the archangel,
[1:14:01] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[1:14:04] in Christ shall rise first. Then we
[1:14:08] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:14:09] caught up together with them in the
[1:14:11] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
[1:14:14] so shall we ever be with the Lord. Paul
[1:14:18] says this, "Wherefore comfort,
[1:14:22] comfort one another with these words." I
[1:14:26] want to bring comfort to you this
[1:14:27] morning. Those are the true words of the
[1:14:31] Lord.
[1:14:32] Take comfort in that. Yes, we must go
[1:14:34] through grieving those things, but take
[1:14:36] comfort. If you die in him, you'll rise
[1:14:39] again in him.
[1:15:04] to
[1:15:05] praise the Lord. I'm going to do
[1:15:07] something a little bit out of the
[1:15:09] program. Young lady at the piano, would
[1:15:12] you mind if we sing I'll fly away again?
[1:15:14] Would you mind standing with me and
[1:15:16] let's sing it? I'll tell you what, we'll
[1:15:17] sing it in English on the verses and the
[1:15:20] chorus in Navajo. Would that be all
[1:15:21] right? I'll do my best with Dad Dasham.
[1:15:24] I don't know how I'm going to do my
[1:15:26] best. Okay. So, stand with me and let's
[1:15:28] sing the verses in English. Brother
[1:15:30] Chase, if you'd put those up in English
[1:15:32] and then uh I'll fly away. [music] I
[1:15:35] think it starts with some glad morning.
[1:15:40] Hold on. [music] Wait till he gets it up
[1:15:42] there. Some glad morning. There we go.
[1:15:48] You sing [music] the chorus for me.
[1:15:50] Okay. when we get to the chorus.

[1:34:58] Lord
[1:35:03] [music]
[1:35:10] [music and singing]
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; The beginning is on all
[1:35:24] God is [singing and music] our
[1:35:31] God
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; You might
[1:35:41] [music and singing]
[1:35:49] [music and singing]
[1:35:49] be the Lord.
[1:35:57] [music]
[1:35:59] Oh, [singing]
[1:36:03] you [music]
[1:36:05] I
[1:36:08] [singing]
[1:36:11] [music]
[1:36:12] I
[1:36:17] might
[1:36:21] [music]
[1:36:26] [singing]
[1:36:29] [music]
[1:36:36] be in [music and singing] the heart.
[1:36:41] I [music and singing]
[1:36:47] [music]
[1:37:08] may be seated of me.
[1:37:13] At this time we have the closing prayer
[1:37:17] that is uh Larry Gordy.
[1:37:53] I would like to say thank you for my
[1:37:55] kids from wonder.
[1:38:06] would like to thank Paul for being
[1:38:09] behind my niece Al Lima
[1:38:14] through all of this
[1:38:26] Junior.
[1:38:33] Just wanted to add one more thing to
[1:38:36] [clears throat]
[1:38:38] Vivian. A
[1:38:42] my sister Vivian
[1:38:48] she was crying
[1:38:52] testimony.
[1:38:54] She made her testimony.
[1:39:00] She loved her kids, her grandkids very
[1:39:05] much.
[1:39:17] and she said, "Pray for me, my kids, my
[1:39:20] grandkids. I don't know if I'll ever see
[1:39:23] them in heaven."
[1:39:28] So, you know, that just kind of made me
[1:39:29] think, you know, why was she crying? I
[1:39:31] mean, if you can just be nice to people
[1:39:33] or give money to the church, maybe
[1:39:36] that'll get you into heaven.
[1:39:40] It will not.
[1:39:43] I see.
[1:39:47] You have to
[1:39:49] put your faith in Jesus Christ. That's
[1:39:53] the only way.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; So, you know, this can only be told so
[1:40:03] many times because some of the people
[1:40:05] that were passionate about it
[1:40:09] will eventually leave this earth.
[1:40:13] I always tell people we were all raised
[1:40:17] by my mother and my father.
[1:40:21] We all heard the same message.
[1:40:24] How you twist it and believe in it in a
[1:40:27] different ways. I don't know how you
[1:40:28] could do that, but it was very clear.
[1:40:32] So, I want to thank everybody. I don't
[1:40:34] know if the kitchen people can hear us.
[1:40:37] I want to thank whoever's down there
[1:40:40] preparing and making the food or
[1:40:42] whatever is going on down there
[1:40:46] people that monetarily helped us. Thank
[1:40:49] you. I want to thank everybody that
[1:40:52] really put this all together
[1:40:55] for my sister Vivian.
[1:40:58] So keep that in mind
[1:41:04] because this is not about Vivian
[1:41:06] anymore. It's about us.
[1:41:08] We're still living and breathing here.
[1:41:13] So you can only make things worse for
[1:41:15] yourself if you don't go in the positive
[1:41:17] direction.
[1:41:43] So,
[1:41:57] I don't
[1:42:01] Sha.
[1:42:19] Sorry.
[1:42:29] for
[1:42:46] his nails.
[1:43:03] should
[1:43:07] be there.
[1:43:10] Amen.
[1:43:25] Paul Bears.
[1:44:42] Now see what [music] is going on.
[1:45:22] I don't
[1:45:27] know.
[1:45:44] Get me
[1:45:52] running.
[1:45:56] [singing]
[1:46:08] You're going to [singing] see it.
[1:46:09] [music]
[1:46:15] [music]
[1:46:23] How shall you
[1:46:29] see
[1:46:33] it?
[1:46:54] indeed.
[1:47:18] So the services conclude here. There
[1:47:22] will be no burial.
[1:47:34] Uh you can starting with the uh back row
[1:47:38] or way in the back room
[1:47:40] uh you can get in line and uh
[1:47:44] go along the south south wall. You can
