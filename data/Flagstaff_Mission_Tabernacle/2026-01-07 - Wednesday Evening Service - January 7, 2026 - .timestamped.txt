[6:12] wife was telling me, she said made a
[6:14] comment about one of our grandchildren.
[6:17] And uh I told her, I said, "I pray God
[6:21] doesn't tarry that long.
[6:23] It's a long ways down the road, but he's
[6:25] terried so long for me, and his time is
[6:28] perfect,

[12:35] When the roll
[12:39] there when the
[12:42] sky
[12:51] there I'll be there
[12:53] When the roll is call.
[12:58] When the roll is call.
[13:02] When the roll is cal
[13:07] when the rollers call. I'll be there.
[13:11] Hallelujah.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; I love it. Rolando and I were talking
[13:24] about what he said a week or two ago
[13:26] about how, you know, the Pentecostals
[13:28] make us look bad. We have way more
[13:31] revelation and it seems like they got
[13:34] and I said, "Well, where did you come to
[13:36] the message?" And he said, "In chapas."
[13:38] And I said, "Well, how are they in
[13:39] Chapas?" And he says, "I guess which."
[13:43] Which is like same as you guys.
[13:45] But I didn't take it personally,
[13:47] Rolando. I did not take it personally.
[13:50] It was the word. And so I said, "Amen.
[13:52] We need to do better.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; We need to do better." That's wonderful.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Uh, a couple things. Um,
[14:03] I do have the container back there with
[14:07] for questions. I say container because
[14:09] if I say box, we all have post-traumatic
[14:11] stress, you know. So, um,
[14:15] sorry.
[14:17] Um, so anyways, for questions for the
[14:19] 25th, the service on the 25th, the Lord
[14:22] is in it. I really feel because I
[14:24] already got a question asked and the
[14:26] Lord was already working before the
[14:28] question was even asked and the answer
[14:30] is already there. So, I know the Lord is
[14:32] in it January 25th. So, you got a few
[14:35] weeks there if you want to put a
[14:37] question. Do we have an update on
[14:38] Brother Dawn? Did he go home yesterday?
[14:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. No. Okay. He got home
[14:45] though. Perfect.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we'll add him to our prayer
[14:50] list there.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um we had brother Ryan, I
[14:55] wanted him to do like a three-part on uh
[14:57] the word of the church. And yesterday I
[15:00] was talking to Aaron McGary. I didn't
[15:01] tell brother Ryan this, but I was
[15:03] talking to Aaron McGary in the
[15:04] afternoon.
[15:06] We spent like an hour and a half
[15:07] chatting. And and one of our topics was
[15:11] earlier in our ministries, we'd go to a
[15:13] place and we had a message that we knew
[15:16] was inspired and we just take it and
[15:18] just preach it even though it wasn't the
[15:21] inspired for the time, you know, we just
[15:24] knew it was a good message, you know,
[15:25] and we're at a new church and they're
[15:26] going to like it, you know, that preach.
[15:29] We're just preachers and we're just
[15:30] people. And then we talked about how as
[15:32] we've gotten older, we realize I only
[15:35] want to preach what the Lord wants me to
[15:37] preach today and that's it. So we
[15:40] started talking about that and we see we
[15:42] see other ministers making the same
[15:44] mistake where it just seems like they
[15:46] just, you know, and so it's not a
[15:48] criticism. We're all learning. And
[15:49] &gt;&gt; so we just talked about that. We and we
[15:51] spent a little while on that topic. Then
[15:52] Ryan sent me a message last night. Hey,
[15:55] I know we had kind of planned to talk
[15:56] about this, but what do you think if I
[15:58] just feel to go this direction? It's
[16:00] right in line with what you were talking
[16:01] about on Sunday. And I said, "Perfect,
[16:03] man. I'm not even I've already had that
[16:05] conversation today." So, do it. So,
[16:08] that's the direction we'll go and then
[16:09] we'll take prayer, Lord willing,
[16:11] afterwards. So, I like that song. When
[16:14] the roll is called up yonder. Praise the
[16:16] Lord. Thank you, brother. Let's start
[16:19] with the first verse there. Um
[16:22] on that, doesn't it say something on
[16:24] that? When the trumpet of the Lord shall
[16:28] sound
[16:31] and the morning breaks eternal right
[16:35] there.
[16:36] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[16:47] Yeah. Heat.
[16:59] Oh,
[17:03] heat, heat.
[17:13] Yeah. Heat.
[17:23] Yeah. Heat.
[17:41] When the road
[17:43] is called up yonder.
[17:47] When the roll
[17:49] is called up yonder
[17:52] when the all is called up yonder. I'll
[17:56] be there.
[17:58] Amen. It's not just a song. It's a plan.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; It's a plan. Not just words, right? It's
[18:05] a uh should be a mindset. Amen. Lord,
[18:08] help us. Amen. Good to be in the house
[18:10] of the Lord. Appreciate the uh
[18:12] opportunity from the our pastor. Um
[18:16] thank you the musicians. Thank you,
[18:17] brother Orlando, for that special. Um I
[18:20] pray that this is uh this is in line
[18:23] with what he was talking about. It just
[18:25] really felt maybe you won't see the tie,
[18:27] but it certainly tied in for me. just
[18:29] something that I had been studying
[18:32] uh been studying for the last few months
[18:34] and um when he was speaking on Sunday,
[18:36] how many appreciated the message on
[18:38] Sunday? Just real real good. Um spoke to
[18:41] me anyways. I definitely was was uh was
[18:45] fed spiritually. So, um, and I just had
[18:47] this on my heart and and not to to get
[18:51] away from the subject that we were on,
[18:52] but, uh, sometimes it's good just a
[18:55] little get a little in between snack in
[18:58] between meals. Amen. So, uh, I pray that
[19:01] this is a blessing for you and I pray
[19:03] that the Lord speaks to us tonight out
[19:05] of his word. Amen. Let's just read a
[19:06] scripture and then we'll have you be
[19:08] seated. uh Revelations
[19:11] chapter 5
[19:13] and um and then we'll read another
[19:16] scripture right afterwards. I I enjoy
[19:18] Wednesday nights. I really just have
[19:20] grown to love Wednesday nights uh I want
[19:23] to say more than Sunday, but I really
[19:24] feel like we can get into like the meat
[19:26] of the word. And uh I don't know about
[19:28] you, but I really love just getting a
[19:30] recharge in the middle of the week. Um
[19:33] maybe I was the only one that gets a
[19:34] recharge in the middle of the week, but
[19:35] uh I pray that you do, too. and and and
[19:38] let's just uh let's just have church
[19:40] tonight, right? We made the effort to
[19:41] come here and drive in the cold and
[19:44] what's going to be icy when we leave.
[19:46] Let's just have church while we're here.
[19:47] Amen. And then so uh Revelations 5, um
[19:50] we'll read a few verses ch starting at
[19:52] one. And I saw on the right hand of him
[19:54] that sat on the throne a book written
[19:56] within and on the backside sealed with
[19:59] seven seals. And I saw a strong angel
[20:01] proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is
[20:03] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[20:06] seals thereof?" Um, very important
[20:09] scripture here. Uh, no man in heaven,
[20:13] nor in earth, nor under the earth, was
[20:15] able to open the book. No man
[20:20] &gt;&gt; was able to do it, neither to look
[20:21] thereon. And I wept much, because no man
[20:23] was found worthy to open and read the
[20:26] book, neither to look thereon. One of
[20:27] the angels saith unto me, weep not.
[20:29] Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[20:31] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[20:33] the book, and to loose the seals
[20:34] thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the
[20:37] midst of the throne, and of the four
[20:38] beasts, in the midst of the elders,
[20:39] stood a lamb, as it had been slain,
[20:42] having seven horns and seven eyes, which
[20:44] are the seven spirits of God, sent forth
[20:46] unto all the earth. And he came and took
[20:49] the book out of the right hand of him
[20:51] that sat upon the throne. Let's just
[20:53] read one more scripture. Um, I was a
[20:56] little bit inspired a few months ago.
[20:58] Um, I was just happened to read this
[20:59] scripture about a week before we had I
[21:02] think his name is Brother Aaron, the
[21:03] brother visiting from uh, Brother Nathan
[21:06] Bryan's church. He spoke a couple
[21:08] services for us. I really enjoyed what
[21:09] he said and he he had made a comment and
[21:12] not that I disagreed with it, but I just
[21:13] tell you where my mind was at at the
[21:15] time. I had the scripture on my heart
[21:17] and I'd written it down and then two
[21:19] days later he speaks and he said he made
[21:21] a comment which uh, I just thought, man,
[21:23] I'm going to dig into that. and he said,
[21:25] you know, it's not like um you know,
[21:27] it's not like I'm we're Paul or anything
[21:29] with this great revelation
[21:31] um to be able to warrant the thorn in
[21:34] our sight. And I started to think about
[21:35] that. I just written down that scripture
[21:36] and so if it'd be all right um maybe
[21:39] just to touch on that subject in 2
[21:40] Corinthians,
[21:42] maybe that doesn't make sense to you,
[21:43] but it really was just got my got my
[21:46] mind going. 2 Corinthians chapter 12. I
[21:49] know we're standing for a little bit,
[21:50] but um
[21:52] we'll let you sit down right now. 2
[21:54] Corinthians 12:7,
[21:57] "Unless I should be exalted above
[22:00] measure through the abundance of the
[22:02] revelations, there was given to me a
[22:05] thorn in the flesh, the messenger of
[22:08] Satan to buffet me, lest I should be
[22:10] exalted above measure." That's true.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; For this thing I besought the Lord
[22:14] thrice, that it might depart from me.
[22:17] and he said unto me, "My grace is
[22:20] sufficient for thee, for my strength is
[22:23] made perfect in weakness.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Most gladly, therefore, will I rather
[22:30] glory in my infirmities, that the power
[22:33] of Christ may rest upon me,
[22:38] &gt;&gt; not taking it personally,
[22:41] &gt;&gt; as we heard on Sunday,
[22:43] &gt;&gt; not taking it personally. Therefore, I
[22:46] take pleasure
[22:48] &gt;&gt; in infirmities,
[22:50] &gt;&gt; in reproaches, in necessities, in
[22:54] persecutions, in distresses for Christ's
[22:57] sake. For when I am weak, then am I
[23:00] strong. Let's just bow our heads. And
[23:03] Lord, we would just ask you would just
[23:05] bless, Lord, your word that we have
[23:07] read, Father. And would you just for the
[23:10] next however long you would like it to
[23:12] be Lord will we just forget about Lord
[23:15] what we have going on in time and our
[23:17] thoughts Lord and all these things and
[23:18] would we just surrender our minds and
[23:19] our hearts to you Lord. Would you just
[23:21] come and speak to us Lord in Jesus name
[23:23] we pray. Amen. You may be seated. And so
[23:26] if I um
[23:29] um if I had maybe a title it would it
[23:31] would just be this that there was given
[23:33] to me a thorn.
[23:35] And uh you know we don't know we don't
[23:38] know from the scripture um what Paul's
[23:41] thorn was.
[23:43] Um it doesn't say whether it was
[23:45] physical, whether it was spiritual.
[23:46] Brother Brandham um goes into it a
[23:49] little bit. Said perhaps it was his
[23:50] eyesight, perhaps it was all these
[23:52] things, but we don't know what it is for
[23:53] sure. But we do know that he had
[23:55] something that was so um I don't know
[23:58] what the word is, maybe stressful or so
[24:00] um such a persecution in his life that
[24:03] he that he sought the Lord out three
[24:04] times. So it wasn't just a Lord, could
[24:07] you deliver this from me? It was
[24:08] something that just perplexed him over
[24:11] and over and over again that he sought
[24:12] the Lord out multiple times for a
[24:14] healing. And this is this is Paul that
[24:16] we're talking about. This is Paul that
[24:18] that you know people raised from the
[24:20] dead under his ministry and and and
[24:22] blinded eyes he killed and walls of a
[24:24] jail literally falling down just at the
[24:26] praises of Of course we know that's not
[24:28] Paul but you think that if the ministry
[24:30] of Paul carried that type of weight that
[24:33] if he went to the Lord and sought him to
[24:35] have something removed from his life
[24:37] that his prayer would be answered. And
[24:40] yet the Lord said the Lord did not
[24:43] deliver him from it as we know in the
[24:45] scripture and he says my grace is
[24:46] sufficient for thee. Um you know this it
[24:49] made me think of the scripture in in
[24:51] Peter. It said beloved think it not
[24:54] strange concerning the fiery trial which
[24:56] is to try you as though some strange
[24:59] thing happened to you.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; We're not to look at the trials and I I
[25:03] just talk to myself that a lot of times
[25:05] I look at trials and I this is just
[25:07] going to be a real basic simple message
[25:08] if that's okay. I just look at my trials
[25:11] and I wonder uh why is this happening to
[25:13] me?
[25:15] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've ever asked that
[25:16] question or or even, you know, did I do
[25:18] something
[25:20] to bring this trial on to me? And um
[25:23] I'll just read a quote here out of
[25:24] Hebrews chapter 3. Brother Ram says, "He
[25:26] was in jail and he asked the Lord to
[25:28] heal him of it and he consulted him
[25:30] three times. But what did the Lord say?
[25:33] My grace is sufficient." Paul
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Then I will glory in my
[25:38] infirmities." when he got an answer from
[25:40] the Lord, he took the answer from the
[25:43] Lord. He didn't go back and ask, okay,
[25:46] the Lord gave him that answer and then
[25:48] he took it because he said, "Except I
[25:50] would be exalted above the abundance of
[25:51] revelation, there was given to me a
[25:53] messenger of the devil, a thorn in the
[25:55] flesh that buffet me, he'd get better
[25:57] for a while and then away they'd go
[25:59] again." Brother Steve preached on us
[26:01] about two years ago about blow after
[26:03] blow. If you remember, buff it means
[26:04] blow after blow. Like the ship on the
[26:06] seas, you know, the waves buffet at sea
[26:08] blow after blow. He would get better.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever experienced this in your in
[26:14] your walk, in your life, physically,
[26:16] spiritually, mentally, whatever it might
[26:17] be, he'd get better and then he'd have
[26:19] it again. And then he'd get better and
[26:21] have it again. He said, "Lord, what's
[26:22] the matter? You don't take this away
[26:24] from me." And he said, "My grace is
[26:26] sufficient." Paul, just keep on. Amen.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now, if if I was just
[26:32] perfect and everything was perfect and I
[26:34] would go along saying, "Oh, I'd get
[26:35] puffed up and say, you see, there's
[26:37] nothing wrong with me. Lord takes care
[26:39] of me, brother." Hallelujah. Then you're
[26:42] getting self-righteous.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Man, it's like if you're if you're if
[26:47] you're over here on this side, it's not
[26:48] a good thing. But if then you're over
[26:50] here on this side, it's also not a good
[26:51] thing. The Lord knows exactly where to
[26:53] keep us. God has to give you a little
[26:56] something. Where is it coming from? It's
[26:58] coming from God. As we heard Sunday,
[27:00] don't take it personally. Seek out if
[27:02] it's coming from God. Give you something
[27:03] a little once in a while to kind of
[27:05] meaken you up a little bit. You know,
[27:07] that's right. Kind of make you realize
[27:09] that he's the boss.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; You say, you know, I would say this,
[27:15] well, Lord, I realize you're the boss
[27:17] without you giving me this, but not
[27:19] according to the word. I wouldn't do it.
[27:21] I may be in a little situation, but
[27:23] really to know that he's the boss, which
[27:25] mean he has preeminence over my life. If
[27:27] I forgot to set a timer here, I'm going
[27:29] to set one just so I know we have a uh
[27:33] prayer afterwards.
[27:36] Amen. I'll read you another one. It
[27:38] says, "We notice Paul." Now, I I I just
[27:40] want I didn't disagree with brother
[27:42] Aaron when he was here, but I I started
[27:43] to think about that statement. I said,
[27:45] you know, I've kind of thought that I
[27:46] thought that same thing. You know, I
[27:48] don't have that great revelation. I
[27:50] don't I don't equal myself to Paul or
[27:52] and I don't think we compare ourselves
[27:53] to people in the Bible. You know, we we
[27:56] read the stories, but it's really hard
[27:57] to put yourself in Moses's shoes or
[27:59] Paul's shoes or somebody's shoes. But
[28:01] yet,
[28:03] &gt;&gt; that's not really the right mentality to
[28:05] have because the right mentality is
[28:07] listen, if I'm God and I've been part of
[28:09] this revelation to this person that
[28:11] you're reading about. I am God and I
[28:14] change not. And if you fall under the
[28:17] same exact anointing and bride that
[28:19] these people fell under, you actually
[28:21] have not only that revelation, but in
[28:24] our time, we have a greater
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, we do.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; You say a greater revelation. Yes, a
[28:30] greater revelation because right now as
[28:33] we know there, this is the full
[28:36] manifestation of the word today.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; There is nothing hid. There is nothing
[28:40] that yet has yet to be revealed. we have
[28:43] the full manifestation of the word. So I
[28:46] don't want to have the attitude or the
[28:47] mindset of well I just have this little
[28:49] simple revelation. No, that's the devil
[28:52] trying to get you off of the thing that
[28:54] God has given you.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Many times I thought that, oh well, I'm
[28:57] just a little simple this and that.
[28:59] Well, where is that coming from?
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Now I'm simple. My mind is simple. The
[29:04] way I think is simple. But the God that
[29:07] lives inside my heart is not simple.
[29:09] Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; And so if if I I I I just I don't want
[29:13] to be guilty of having a uh what is it?
[29:16] A scarcity mindset
[29:18] &gt;&gt; where I'm going to live under my
[29:20] privilege, not because I am anything
[29:22] good, but because he gave to me
[29:24] something that makes me privileged.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; It I it it lifts me to a spot that I
[29:30] could never lift myself. But with it
[29:33] comes something else.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. So he says this. Now, what is this
[29:38] great revelation that Paul had? If if if
[29:40] you were to say, I I sit down and write
[29:42] down the great revelation that Paul had,
[29:45] we might come up with maybe 40 or 50
[29:48] different things that was Paul's great
[29:49] revelation, right? Maybe it would fill
[29:51] books. But let's just let's just I love
[29:53] that the Lord is is he's the most
[29:57] complex, complicated being ever, and yet
[30:01] hides himself and reveals himself in
[30:04] simplicity. There there's a saying and I
[30:06] it's it's not from the message. It's
[30:08] from a man who says the modern man does
[30:11] not find God because he doesn't look low
[30:13] enough.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; True.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; We make him into something so great and
[30:19] complicate which he is great. But yet
[30:21] that's not how he chose to reveal
[30:22] himself. And so he says this, brother
[30:25] Ram says, "And when their eyes were
[30:26] open, they knew him in 64." He says, "We
[30:28] notice then Paul the great revelation
[30:30] that he had of Jesus Christ who he was.
[30:36] Praise the Lord.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; You're like, "Wait a minute. That's the
[30:37] great revelation."
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; But but he says here, "It was so great
[30:43] to know."
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; And if you think, "Well, wait a minute.
[30:49] I know who he is."
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Then you have the revelation that Paul
[30:55] had.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; But do you really know who he is? See,
[30:59] it's not just, well, I know what his
[31:01] name is. I know what he came and did. I
[31:04] know about him. I think we were talking
[31:06] about this. I could read uh I I could
[31:08] read uh uh brother John I could read an
[31:10] autobiography about you. Maybe you would
[31:13] write it even yourself and you would say
[31:14] here's my and I could read that book and
[31:17] I would know about you.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; But I wouldn't know you until I met you,
[31:23] until I talked with you. I see how you
[31:26] speak, how you smile, how your eyes
[31:29] change even when you're saying something
[31:30] I would just know about you. And many
[31:32] people know about God,
[31:35] &gt;&gt; but they don't know him.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; And so, it's a great revelation, he
[31:38] says, to know. I got to keep moving here
[31:40] because I got um I hope it's okay, but I
[31:42] got maybe a a lot of hay on the cart.
[31:44] Well, God put it in the Bible. That's
[31:46] how great it was. That's the reason he
[31:49] was given a thorn in the flesh. That's
[31:52] the That's the reason he says to keep
[31:53] him down so he wouldn't get big and
[31:56] exalted. God kept him down and small so
[31:59] he could use him in different parts of
[32:01] the country to do for him what he wanted
[32:04] to do because he had the revelation of
[32:06] Jesus Christ who he was.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; I say okay that that that makes sense.
[32:12] Uh I I know sometimes it gets a little
[32:14] bit scary. Now wait a minute. If I h if
[32:16] I say I have that same revelation
[32:20] I just we read the scripture. Now what
[32:22] is going to come with it? And that's
[32:23] what I want to talk about is because of
[32:26] the great revelation given to you. Even
[32:29] if you didn't realize what great
[32:30] revelation that you have, you definitely
[32:33] recognize the trials.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; You definitely recognize persecution. I
[32:39] I would hope that everybody here is has
[32:41] gone through or is going through
[32:44] something
[32:45] &gt;&gt; and you and you have total reliance on
[32:47] the Lord to bring it through. You say,
[32:49] "Now, why did that happen?" And and a
[32:51] lot of times I just want to I just want
[32:52] to kind of knock this out of the way
[32:54] right now. A lot of times I get under uh
[32:56] trial or persecution or you do or we see
[32:59] somebody else going under persecution.
[33:01] We see somebody else sick or we see
[33:03] somebody else going through a trial and
[33:05] a lot of times in our mind I I
[33:07] immediately think something has gone
[33:09] wrong.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; There must be something wrong somewhere.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; We see somebody maybe in financial
[33:17] trouble. I don't I'll just I'll just
[33:19] confess. Have you ever thought, "Oh, I
[33:21] wonder if they made bad financial
[33:22] decision. Maybe maybe I know you've
[33:24] never thought this. Maybe they didn't
[33:26] pay offering and tithe correctly and now
[33:29] this is this is reaping." Now I I I just
[33:32] I'll confess maybe maybe my own uh
[33:36] incorrect thinking has led me to those
[33:38] thoughts.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; But what you know a lot of times when we
[33:41] see that there there's a there's in the
[33:42] Bible Jesus and disciples came across a
[33:45] man who was blind. And the first thing
[33:47] the disciples asked Jesus was who
[33:49] sinned?
[33:51] &gt;&gt; The father or the mother? And Jesus says
[33:53] this, I'll just read this out of this
[33:55] quote. He says, "It's up to him that
[33:56] believed." Do you remember the blind man
[33:58] that Jesus found? They said, "Who
[34:00] sinned? His father or his mother?" And
[34:02] he said, "In this case, neither
[34:05] &gt;&gt; but that the works of God might be made
[34:08] known." See, it happened to the boy so
[34:11] that Jesus could be glorified. Lord,
[34:14] &gt;&gt; sometimes sickness is not a curse.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; That's not my word. That's right out of
[34:23] the message. Sometimes sickness is not a
[34:26] curse.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; A blessing to be sick.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; True.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Now, wait a minute. A blessing to be
[34:38] sick. Let's just read what he says. so
[34:40] that we can stick out our our faith out
[34:42] there and call those things which are
[34:44] not as though they were. God said so and
[34:48] he'll prove it so if you'll just not
[34:51] weaken under the test.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Instead of looking at the situation with
[34:56] our human reasoning, which is really
[34:59] hard not to look at a situation our own
[35:01] or somebody else's, whatever it might
[35:03] be, and apply the human reasoning to it.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[35:07] And maybe our intention is good. Brother
[35:09] Brandon, Brother Brandham even said this
[35:11] early on in his ministry. He said when
[35:12] he would go into a city, he would issue
[35:14] a challenge. He said, and he said,
[35:17] "Bring your sick. Bring your crippled.
[35:20] Bring them here." And before the end of
[35:22] this meeting, they will be healed.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; And he said he he did that for a long
[35:26] time until the Lord dealt with them.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; And the Lord says this, quote, "You're
[35:31] confining too much of that gift of
[35:34] healing to performing miracles. And he
[35:37] goes on, the Lord goes on to tell him,
[35:39] "Have you ever consulted me first?"
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Did you ever consult me before you
[35:45] prayed for those people?
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Oh boy.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Oh boy.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; What a question.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes God allows something
[35:53] to happen just so he can get the glory
[35:56] out of it when he straightens the thing
[35:58] out the way he wants to straighten the
[36:00] thing out.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we see somebody in church
[36:03] who's maybe going through some bad
[36:04] times. Maybe it's ourselves. Maybe uh
[36:07] you see they kind of take miss a few
[36:09] church services here and there or you
[36:11] see maybe personal life falling apart or
[36:13] maybe their children stop serving the
[36:14] Lord or maybe their business starts
[36:16] going downhill. I'm just going to name a
[36:18] bunch of symptoms because uh you know
[36:20] maybe their you know they used to praise
[36:22] the Lord real loudly and worship and now
[36:24] they're real quiet. Maybe their amen is
[36:26] real quiet. It's not as loud as it used
[36:27] to be. Do you ever see somebody going
[36:29] through that even if it's yourself and
[36:31] think something has gone wrong here?
[36:33] Sure.
[36:35] There must be some they must have some
[36:38] kind of thing going on. I don't mean in
[36:39] a bad way, but sometimes we go, man, I'm
[36:41] just going to pray for them. Something
[36:43] they must have some sin. Now, listen.
[36:45] Sin can be the reason for this
[36:47] sometimes. Can we can we just approach?
[36:49] Sin can be the reason I'm going through
[36:52] something personally, a trial or
[36:54] persecutions, right? It can be that. But
[36:56] all the time sin is not the reason.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; All the time sin is not the reason. And
[37:01] it just said in that quote, "Sickness
[37:04] &gt;&gt; is not always a curse."
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; See, because if we if we start to think
[37:10] like that, if I start to think like
[37:11] that, then I'm exactly like the friends
[37:13] of Job. Because Job had every single one
[37:16] of those symptoms I just told you about.
[37:18] His finances fell apart. His children
[37:20] died. He lost his house. He lost his
[37:22] spouse. He didn't know what to do. He
[37:24] lost his personal health. And his
[37:26] friends came around to say, "There must
[37:28] be something going on in Job's life.
[37:32] Tell us, Job, what is it? What is that
[37:34] secret sin that's going on?" And Job
[37:35] said, "I've examined my life.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; I've examined it according to the word,
[37:40] and I don't have anything that I'm
[37:41] hiding. So, you can accuse me all you
[37:44] want to, but I've put I I've I've sought
[37:47] the Lord because I know him. I've sought
[37:49] the Lord and you can you can accuse me
[37:51] this all you want, but there's nothing
[37:53] in my life that I haven't told him
[37:56] about.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we confuse sometimes I
[37:58] confuse my trials for sin.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; And listen, here's here's the other
[38:05] side. Sometimes I can I I I I confuse my
[38:08] sin with trials. Oh, I'm going through
[38:10] this thing because the Lord's testing
[38:11] me. No, I'm going through that because I
[38:13] made a wrong decision. Because I have
[38:15] the wrong spirit, because I have the
[38:17] wrong mentality. Because I've allowed
[38:18] something to come in and make me think a
[38:20] certain way. I might be going through a
[38:22] trial for those reasons. Let's not
[38:24] confuse sin with God saying, "I'm going
[38:27] to put you through something to mold
[38:29] your character to make you who I want
[38:31] you to be." I've heard I I I've I've
[38:34] probably have said this, but like, "Oh,
[38:35] well, I have a bad temper or I'm I'm
[38:37] stubborn. That's just my thorn in the
[38:39] flesh." No,
[38:40] &gt;&gt; no, it's not a thorn in the flesh.
[38:42] That's just characteristics that are not
[38:44] godly that God's going to do everything
[38:46] in his power to get rid of.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; So Job Job said, "Accuse all you want
[38:51] to. I know where I stand." See, but that
[38:53] the sin was not the cause in Job's life.
[38:56] It was not the cause for the thorns. He
[38:58] was given a thorn. The prophet of God
[39:00] said that what was perfect about Job, he
[39:03] says that he had a perfect revelation of
[39:07] who God was. Doesn't that sound
[39:08] familiar? That sounds exactly like the
[39:11] revelation that we're talking about Paul
[39:13] has.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; He knew who God was. He knew that he
[39:16] could He knew that his life was not
[39:18] perfect. No, because he had to go make
[39:20] sacrifices in the temple. But he knew
[39:22] that there was only one way to commune
[39:24] with God and that was through blood.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Before Jesus ever came and was died, he
[39:29] knew that it had to be a blood sacrifice
[39:31] in order to have And so, but what he
[39:34] struggled with, you know, Job had a
[39:35] struggle. And what he had a struggle
[39:37] with, brother Bram says this was the
[39:39] mark on his life.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; He said what he struggled with and and
[39:43] mostly what I struggled with is he
[39:45] wanted to know why.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; He even said Lord I demand
[39:53] &gt;&gt; you answer me.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Why is this happening to me? And right
[39:58] there is the mistake.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; It's a mistake. to seek out why you're
[40:09] going through what you're going through
[40:10] it. No, it's a mistake to ask the Lord,
[40:13] why are you doing this? Because that
[40:15] goes back to Sunday. Now, you've made a
[40:18] conflict. I've made a conflict with God
[40:22] when I demand an answer out of him. And
[40:24] the way he answered Job is perfect. Oh,
[40:25] you want an answer?
[40:27] Buckle up
[40:29] &gt;&gt; because I'm going to ask you some
[40:31] questions and see if you I'm going to
[40:32] demand of you an answer and see if you
[40:34] can answer. How do you and where you
[40:36] could go through that whole book of Job?
[40:38] You know what he was asking him? H if
[40:40] you how do you you're going to ask me my
[40:42] reasons? You don't even see all these
[40:45] things I have going on.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Why did I do this? Why did I do this?
[40:49] Why did I make this? Why did I create
[40:51] this? If you don't know those, why are
[40:52] you asking me why I'm doing what I'm
[40:53] doing in your life?
[40:56] &gt;&gt; And maybe maybe just maybe Job Job
[40:59] caught a revelation
[41:01] which he did and he said, "You know
[41:03] what?
[41:04] I know my redeemer liveth if he destroys
[41:08] me.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; See what happened? It wasn't just words.
[41:11] He got to a revelation where he said,
[41:13] "Oh, oh, this thing that I'm going
[41:15] through. Oh, if it kills me, I'll still
[41:17] trust in him."
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, this thing that I'm going through,
[41:20] even though I've lost everything, oh,
[41:22] maybe it's not a curse.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a blessing.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; A blessing. Amen.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; His wife told him to curse God. And he's
[41:30] over here blessing God by the end of the
[41:32] book for put I I I just And here I go
[41:35] through my little things.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; And I and I demand an answer from God.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; That's the mistake.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; I say, "Why am I going through these
[41:43] things?" And I look at Job's life. I'm
[41:45] not going through what Job went through.
[41:46] And yet, I'm not trying to trivialize
[41:48] our our tests and trials. All right. But
[41:50] how many times have you ever demanded an
[41:52] answer from the Lord? How many times has
[41:55] your prayer my prayer been Lord take
[41:58] this thing away from me rather
[42:02] &gt;&gt; than say Lord is this from you
[42:08] &gt;&gt; you saying do I need to put up with
[42:09] sicknesses do I need to put up with
[42:10] these things let me just read you
[42:12] something brother Bram says but first
[42:14] your motives and object objectives has
[42:18] to be right
[42:19] &gt;&gt; you have to re you have to have reasons
[42:22] for this God don't give you those things
[42:24] just because you ask.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; And you cannot ask in faith unless
[42:29] there's a real objective to that to be
[42:32] in the will of God. See, if you want to
[42:35] be well, what do you want to be well
[42:37] for?
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; It's not just about going to God like
[42:41] he's a butler and saying, "Lord, here's
[42:43] what I want today." He wants you to seek
[42:45] out, "Well, wait a minute. Why do you
[42:47] want me to?" And this right in the
[42:49] message. See, if you want to be healed,
[42:52] what's the reason you want to be healed?
[42:54] &gt;&gt; What are you telling God? What do you
[42:56] want to do with your life when you get
[42:59] healed? Or is the prayer and and the and
[43:02] and the sincere request of the heart
[43:04] just to be healed? And God's God can do
[43:06] it
[43:07] &gt;&gt; and sometimes he will do it. But then
[43:09] sometimes you get buffeted and then it
[43:11] comes back again and then the thing goes
[43:12] away and then it comes back again.
[43:15] See, there's you've got to have a motive
[43:16] and an objective, and they have to be
[43:18] right according to the will of God.
[43:19] That's when the faith is revealed to
[43:22] you. And God by his sovereign grace
[43:24] places that faith in there, then it's
[43:26] over.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you that sickness is
[43:31] something that you need to put up with.
[43:33] I'm telling you, seek out what the Lord
[43:37] thinks about it, what God thinks about
[43:39] it.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to make that. I think
[43:42] that's just I'll just leave that right
[43:44] there because the word of God, what it
[43:45] is, we were discussing this the other
[43:46] night. Uh my wife and I were discussing
[43:49] this. The word of God calls us to have a
[43:51] higher a higher view of the situation.
[43:55] Okay? So, revelation and you know this,
[43:57] but I just want to go through this
[43:59] revelation when you receive revelation
[44:02] from God, it is not a download of
[44:04] information.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. So it's not this I didn't know
[44:09] this and then he he just like and now I
[44:12] have all this knowledge right because
[44:13] now it becomes about knowledge. It
[44:16] becomes about how much you know how much
[44:18] you can retain how much you can
[44:19] remember. No no that's not revelation
[44:21] from God. What a revealing is is God
[44:25] giving you a little glimpse
[44:28] &gt;&gt; of how he sees the situation.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said that when he saw that
[44:34] vision he goes I didn't do anything. It
[44:36] was like he picked me up.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; I was looking through the little hole in
[44:40] the fence. He goes, "But it it was like
[44:42] he picked me up so that I could see the
[44:45] whole picture
[44:47] &gt;&gt; from his point of view."
[44:49] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; And then he would come off of it.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's brother
[44:53] Brandham." I'm sorry, but it's
[44:55] unfettered
[44:57] revelation that is given to the bride.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If that was just for brother
[45:03] Brandham, then then we should just go
[45:05] and and and be merry and live every way
[45:07] we want because brother Brandham is the
[45:08] only one. No, that's an example. But
[45:11] greater work shall you do.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; I know this is just kind of basic, but
[45:17] it's God's point of view. And then if
[45:19] you look at yourself from God's point of
[45:22] view, you don't look at your trials and
[45:24] your persecutions the same way,
[45:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:26] &gt;&gt; You don't look at them the same way.
[45:27] See, Paul got to that point after
[45:29] seeking and seeking and seeking and
[45:31] finally the Lord said, "Let me show you
[45:32] from my point of view." And then Paul
[45:34] said, "Oh,
[45:35] &gt;&gt; okay. Instead of asking to be relieved
[45:37] of it, I'm going to glory
[45:40] &gt;&gt; in my infirmities."
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; If I get sick, if I get persecuted, I'm
[45:45] going to praise you even more
[45:48] &gt;&gt; because he got a he was just allowed a
[45:51] little view from God's perspective on
[45:54] the situation.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and you have to have that. How
[45:58] could Job look at losing his children,
[46:00] looking at all this stuff and still
[46:01] serve God? How could he do that unless
[46:04] he got a revelation of God about what
[46:05] that you know James I think the first
[46:07] chapter or second verse of James says
[46:09] this brethren count it all joy.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Now I just want to stop there. All joy
[46:17] not you know a good feeling that lasts
[46:20] from church service to church service or
[46:22] meeting to meeting. all joy, which means
[46:24] anything that you have joy about from
[46:27] God in your life, count it. The word
[46:29] count says judge it. What he's saying is
[46:31] you're going to go through a situation,
[46:33] you need to judge that situation
[46:35] properly, and you need to have all joy.
[46:38] Now, read the rest of the verse. And it
[46:40] doesn't say have all joy when the Lord
[46:43] delivers you,
[46:45] &gt;&gt; when the Lord heals you, when the Lord
[46:47] saves you, when the No, no, no, no. It
[46:49] says, "Count it all joy when you fall
[46:53] into persecutions, into diverse
[46:55] temptations."
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Joy.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Joy for temptations. Oh,
[47:01] yeah. That's how a child of God looks at
[47:04] it. When they're when they're when
[47:06] they're allowing God to give them his
[47:09] view of the scenario. If I look at it
[47:11] through my scenario, though I believe
[47:13] I'm a child of God, I will complain. I
[47:16] will murmur. or or maybe out of
[47:18] sincerity, I will ask the Lord to
[47:20] relieve me of it without seeking out his
[47:22] will.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Everyone, and we all have to come to
[47:28] that realization. We have to come to
[47:30] that realization because what Job did is
[47:32] he just said, "Look, I I I I know I'm
[47:34] going through this, but there must be
[47:37] something so great in store for me
[47:40] that this is going to provide a balance
[47:42] for it."
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; And and that that leads me to something.
[47:46] I'm if I'm okay on I've been about 20
[47:48] minutes about 22 minutes. Uh balance.
[47:52] Can I just talk to you about balance for
[47:53] a moment because I think it's crucial in
[47:55] this balance. Now uh I don't mean
[47:58] balance. You know when I hear balance,
[48:00] what do you think of?
[48:02] &gt;&gt; The middle
[48:04] evenness. I think of a little bit too
[48:06] much to the left or a little bit too
[48:07] much to the right. And when you get the
[48:08] right amount, the scale, it's balance.
[48:11] You're right down the middle of the
[48:12] road. Let's talk about a different type
[48:13] of balance. And and the only way I
[48:15] express this is I I've told this only
[48:17] one time and it was a it's a uh well
[48:19] it's a testimony of kinds, but it's more
[48:20] of an experience. And so uh I know
[48:23] there's some of you that have um
[48:25] operated heavy equipment. I wish brother
[48:27] Jerry was here because he'd really
[48:28] probably appreciate this.
[48:31] So when I was young, I was like uh I was
[48:33] 16 years old. I worked for a heavy
[48:35] equipment um uh dealer. So, I just drove
[48:40] the equipment around on the in the yard
[48:42] and I parked it and I washed it and all
[48:44] these things. I didn't really operate
[48:46] it, but I was learning. And so, there
[48:48] was a day that came where a a a semitr
[48:51] showed up and it had a huge load on it
[48:54] and
[49:06] are we good? Should I switch to this?
[49:08] Not that you need to hear me anymore,
[49:09] but it
[49:17] all right. I'm gonna tell this anyway.
[49:18] So, okay. The man that that that
[49:20] normally unloaded this trailer, he was
[49:22] uh he was at a doctor's appointment and
[49:24] the backup guy was uh I think he was at
[49:26] lunch. And so, I'm like 16 years old and
[49:28] this trailer pulls up and it has this
[49:29] huge load. It's 15,000 pounds. So, it
[49:32] wasn't a small thing. And um you know,
[49:35] the semi-truck driver's like, I I need
[49:36] this unloaded. I don't know when this
[49:38] guy's coming back. So, me as this young
[49:40] kid, I was like, I'm gonna here's my
[49:42] chance. Like, this is my time to shine.
[49:45] And I really did. I was just like, "Oh,
[49:46] yeah. I know. I know what I'm doing.
[49:47] I've operated the equipment. I've driven
[49:49] it around. I've operated the crane." So,
[49:50] I go set up my crane. I got my I'm
[49:52] trying to make this fast, but I really
[49:54] want to drive home this point. I set up
[49:56] my outriggers. I looked at my thing. Oh,
[49:58] it's rated for uh it was like rated for
[50:00] 16,000 lbs. I'm picking up like 15,00
[50:02] I'm good. You probably know where this
[50:05] is going. Brother Bob is probably know
[50:06] where this is going as well. Okay. So, I
[50:08] I get my load down. I get everything. I
[50:10] get it all hooked up and the and the
[50:12] driver goes off and he's chatting with
[50:13] some guy. So, he's not watching me. So,
[50:15] I'm really really alone on this. And I
[50:17] pick up the the the load and sure enough
[50:20] comes right off and I'm checking
[50:22] everything. Okay, I'm good. And then
[50:24] this is where it goes wrong.
[50:27] Where am I going to put this?
[50:30] And because I didn't have experience and
[50:32] because I didn't have knowledge, because
[50:33] I didn't know things, I thought, "Oh,
[50:34] well, there's a there's a spot right on
[50:36] the other side of the trailer."
[50:39] And so, I'll just swing this out and
[50:43] I'll put it there. Yeah. You know where
[50:44] it's going because that weight right
[50:47] here, it can pick it up.
[50:50] But as soon as it moves away,
[50:54] &gt;&gt; it gets exponentially heavier. And this
[50:57] machine could not hold it the more I
[51:00] swung out. And then I got to a point
[51:02] where it was too late. It was too late.
[51:04] I couldn't I couldn't go forward. I
[51:07] couldn't come back. Nobody's out there.
[51:10] I I go to step off the truck and just my
[51:12] weight leaving the truck and it wants to
[51:14] like tilt. So I'm like in a I'm in a
[51:15] bind. And I did probably the worst thing
[51:18] you could do was like, "Well, I'm just
[51:20] going to commit to this, Brother Donald,
[51:21] and I'm just going to like I'm going to
[51:23] go."
[51:26] And it was only the grace of God. I mean
[51:28] that the the crane started to tilt and I
[51:30] went forward but I was low enough to the
[51:32] ground where the the the load hit the
[51:34] ground.
[51:35] The crane didn't flip. I say all that.
[51:38] That's the type of balance that I'm
[51:39] talking about in this particular
[51:41] scenario. That's the type of balance. I
[51:43] didn't have enough counterweight
[51:47] in order to do the task that I needed to
[51:50] do.
[51:52] And
[51:55] if you're going to do anything of
[51:56] consequence for the Lord,
[52:00] &gt;&gt; if you're going to do anything for the
[52:01] Lord, even if you're I'm not saying you
[52:03] have to go and have a ministry or you
[52:05] have to go and do this. If you're going
[52:06] to do anything for the Lord, even live
[52:10] for the Lord,
[52:11] &gt;&gt; okay? It's going to require that you
[52:14] reach out farther than you've ever
[52:16] reached before.
[52:18] I you I don't know if that if that if
[52:20] that sinks in, but I cannot just be a
[52:23] casual believer of the gospel. I can't
[52:26] just go, well, I was I was one way this
[52:29] day and then the Lord changed me, but
[52:30] but I'm still kind of this way.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; No, it's going to require that I do
[52:35] things that I've never done before
[52:37] because the Lord's the one doing them.
[52:38] So, it's going to require that I reach
[52:40] out farther. And if you don't have a
[52:44] counterwe,
[52:45] it's going to be like I don't know if
[52:47] any other kids ever sat on a seessaw
[52:49] when you're by yourself. How much fun is
[52:51] that? This is Liberty. You ever sat on a
[52:54] seesaw without somebody on the other
[52:55] side? It's just called sitting.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; You have to have something on the other
[53:01] end,
[53:03] right? You have to have something on the
[53:04] other end because and you have to have a
[53:06] counterbalance. And let me tell you
[53:07] this, this is hard to hear, but the
[53:09] counterbalance has to be as heavy at
[53:12] least as what you're trying to do for
[53:15] the Lord.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, there's going to be problems.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; You're going to try to do something for
[53:21] the Lord, and then you're going to all
[53:22] of a sudden find yourself lost, out of
[53:25] church, uh depressed, whatever it might
[53:27] be, because there has to be a
[53:30] counterbalance. Because even the because
[53:32] listen, the weakness of my flesh, all
[53:35] this revelation that's given to us,
[53:37] right? We're talking about this. But the
[53:39] weakness of your flesh and my flesh and
[53:42] the the way that this works sometimes
[53:44] demands that there must be a
[53:47] counterbalance to that revelation.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; It demands that there must be a
[53:51] counterbalance to it. We know the word
[53:53] has come full. We we we we know these
[53:55] things. But because of that, there has
[53:58] to be a thorn.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; there was given to you and to me thorns
[54:05] to provide a counterbalance for the
[54:08] revelation that God has either given you
[54:10] and sometimes we don't realize yet or is
[54:13] going to give you and we don't realize
[54:15] that sometimes or sometimes you realize
[54:17] exactly what he's given you. You know
[54:19] who God is. And then sometimes I know
[54:21] exactly who Jesus is, who God is and I
[54:24] still ask why. And when I come back to
[54:26] the Bible, he says, "Because you would
[54:29] be exalted
[54:31] above measure because of this great
[54:33] revelation." And if it weren't for
[54:35] thorns, we would get puffed up,
[54:38] egotistical, prideful, self-righteous,
[54:41] and we would be no good to God even with
[54:44] an abundance of revelation.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; So what he has to do, he has to do it
[54:50] &gt;&gt; is give you a thorn in the side.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; It's true. Amen. He has to do it.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; And we can say amen to this. But what
[55:00] about when the thorn comes?
[55:04] &gt;&gt; What about when it comes? What about
[55:05] when the sickness strikes?
[55:10] I tell you every I I could read this and
[55:12] I know this and then it comes and I and
[55:14] the first thing that comes out of my
[55:15] mouth is why. You can wrestle with it.
[55:18] You can fight at it. You can pick at it
[55:20] and get it all festered up or you can
[55:22] just, you know, we get sometimes we even
[55:24] get depressed or anxious trying to
[55:26] figure out why I have a thorn in my life
[55:30] &gt;&gt; because the thought goes back there must
[55:32] be something wrong.
[55:36] something must have gone. And and
[55:40] I think sometimes we have problems in
[55:42] our walk with the Lord, our
[55:43] relationship, because we spend so much
[55:44] time and effort and worry and stress
[55:46] trying to figure out what the thorn is
[55:48] and why we have it.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; I know I I know I do. I know who God is.
[55:57] But if there's a stress in my
[55:58] relationship with him, it's because I
[55:59] put it there trying to figure out why
[56:01] I'm going through what I'm going
[56:03] through. How many times have I prayed to
[56:05] the Lord to remove something that he put
[56:08] there to begin with?
[56:14] And maybe God is telling us that we need
[56:16] to understand
[56:18] that there are things that we will not
[56:20] understand.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; There are things you're not going to
[56:25] understand why you're going through what
[56:28] you're going through. simply this that
[56:31] he gets the glory whether it be on this
[56:35] side or the other side. Brother Ram
[56:38] says, you know, he may even commit you
[56:40] to death like he did Paul, but he still
[56:43] gets the glory. He may commit you,
[56:46] brother Ram says, to suffer like Job,
[56:48] but it's for his purpose, his reasoning,
[56:52] not mine.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Not it's not my reasoning. Oh Lord, you
[56:55] know, give me a trial until the trial
[56:57] comes.
[56:59] I don't know. I just I telling myself a
[57:02] little bit, but I want to have and the
[57:04] bride will have. I want to have it. That
[57:06] correct spirit says, "Lord, I see the
[57:08] thorn. I don't know why it's there. But
[57:10] I know you must have allowed it." And
[57:13] there if you've allowed it, then it must
[57:15] be a reason. Why don't we go take that
[57:18] thorn, use it as a counterbalance, and
[57:21] go get the work of the Lord done that we
[57:23] couldn't have done without that
[57:25] counterbalance.
[57:27] That's true.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Just go get the work of I don't know
[57:29] what that is. If maybe you have family
[57:31] members, maybe you have a loved one that
[57:33] just is so far from the Lord and you
[57:35] say, "Well, I'm going to go and I'm
[57:36] going to I'm going to talk with them.
[57:38] I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to
[57:39] minister to them." Maybe not in a
[57:41] minister, but in order to reach out and
[57:43] grab somebody, you have to have some
[57:46] suffering back here, some pain back
[57:49] here. In order for you to reach out,
[57:52] there has to be an equal, heavy, hard,
[57:56] dark sometimes counterbalance in order
[57:58] for you to go get the work of the Lord
[58:00] done. This is not just for ministers.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. This is just not for
[58:05] ministers. Well, that's for the
[58:06] minister's job. And if he wants to go
[58:08] preach, you know, the minister. No, I'm
[58:10] sorry. How many times have you been in a
[58:11] service? How many times have you sought
[58:13] the Lord and you want a closer walk with
[58:15] him or something's come along? Usually
[58:17] around the new time, you know, new year.
[58:18] I'm going to pray more this year. I'm
[58:21] going to read my Bible more this year.
[58:22] I'm going to do this more this year.
[58:24] Where did that come from?
[58:26] It's a revelation from God. And yet to
[58:30] accomplish it, there must be a
[58:33] counterbalance.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[58:40] Anybody that's done something for the
[58:42] Lord has had a thorn in their side.
[58:45] Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Just look through the the Bible is
[58:48] literally just It's not a book of of
[58:51] what has happened. It's a book of what
[58:53] always happens.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; What always happens? Everybody that's
[58:58] done something for the Lord, Moses,
[59:01] David, Elijah, we could go through every
[59:03] single one of those. Elijah had a thorn
[59:04] in his side. You know what the thorn in
[59:06] his side was? It was Jezebel.
[59:08] We're talking about the most mighty man
[59:10] on the face of the earth. And when
[59:12] Jezebel threatened him, he ran.
[59:16] This is somebody who who could call fire
[59:18] from heaven. Stay with me now on this on
[59:21] the spiritual thing because because he
[59:23] did not get to see Jezebel defeated and
[59:27] killed.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; He prophesied it. He knew it would
[59:30] happen. But in his lifetime, he had to
[59:33] deal with that thorn. And he was never
[59:35] relieved of it.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; It came a decade later in the life of
[59:38] Elisha. If we keep our spiritual caps
[59:40] now, Brother Brandham, Brother Brandham
[59:43] fought against Jezebel religion,
[59:47] let's just get down to the nitty-gritty.
[59:49] He fought against a a Jezebel religion,
[59:51] a religion being taken over by the cold
[59:54] formal church
[59:55] &gt;&gt; where you just come to the priests and
[59:57] confess your sins, go through your
[59:59] little routine, come to your church
[1:00:00] service every now and then. He fought
[1:00:02] against that
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; and never got to see the victory against
[1:00:06] it. But it comes in my day. It comes in
[1:00:10] my day.
[1:00:12] The manifestation of his ministry
[1:00:14] through Elisha. It comes in my day that
[1:00:16] I get to see that the defeat of a
[1:00:19] Jezebel spirit. The same exact spirit
[1:00:21] that was on a woman is just on the
[1:00:23] religious. I I know we know this,
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; but a thorn in his side that he was
[1:00:27] never relieved of. I I have a few
[1:00:28] examples if that's okay. I didn't really
[1:00:30] know where to go, but I just want to
[1:00:32] talk. Can I talk about Joseph? I got I
[1:00:34] got uh it says 12 minutes if I'm doing
[1:00:36] okay.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Joseph uh Joseph had so many things of
[1:00:41] God in his life going for him.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; He was shown dreams as a young man. As a
[1:00:45] young man, he saw his brothers bowing
[1:00:47] before him.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And he told them that maybe out of
[1:00:51] immaturity. Maybe he shouldn't have
[1:00:53] shared it with them, but he told them.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And what did they do? They got they got
[1:00:59] jealous. They got angry with him. And
[1:01:02] they started persecuting him.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; They they they they beat him up. They
[1:01:07] throw him into a a pit or a ditch on the
[1:01:09] side of the road down in the hole,
[1:01:10] right? You know what that was? That was
[1:01:12] a thorn.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; And then it didn't stop there. They pull
[1:01:16] him out. When they when when the slave
[1:01:18] carts of Egypt start rolling by, they
[1:01:21] pull him out and they go, "Well, I guess
[1:01:22] we won't kill him. We'll sell him." You
[1:01:23] know what that was? That was another
[1:01:24] thorn. But God with him the whole time.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; The whole time God's with him. And then
[1:01:29] he goes to Egypt and it looks like maybe
[1:01:31] he's through the persecution, right? But
[1:01:33] here's the buffeting, a messenger of
[1:01:35] Satan again. And all of a sudden he's
[1:01:37] falsely accused in the house of
[1:01:38] potterer. How many times have you been
[1:01:40] falsely accused and you want to know
[1:01:42] why?
[1:01:45] I just that that was maybe a little bit
[1:01:47] for me. Maybe somebody said something
[1:01:49] about me and the first thing I want to
[1:01:50] go do is confront them about it.
[1:01:54] Why are you saying this about me? Why
[1:01:55] are you spreading this about me? Why you
[1:01:56] doing that? And yet Joseph didn't say
[1:01:59] nothing. Went to jail because he knew
[1:02:01] that God was with him.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; You see a heart, his heart was kept
[1:02:06] right. His spirit was kept right. And
[1:02:09] guess what? In in the dungeon, have you
[1:02:12] ever been in the dungeon? Maybe you're
[1:02:14] in the dungeon right now in your mind,
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; in your heart,
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; in your prayer life, whatever it might
[1:02:21] be. Maybe you're in the dungeon. But
[1:02:23] guess what? His heart stayed true to
[1:02:25] God. And even in the dungeon, his gift
[1:02:27] was still operating. Even in your
[1:02:30] dungeon, guess what? Uh you say, "Well,
[1:02:32] what gift do I have?" We're all given
[1:02:35] gifts.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Why don't you look and see if your gift
[1:02:40] is operating when you're down in that
[1:02:42] trial? Oh, maybe the trial is not from
[1:02:44] Satan. Maybe it's a blessing. Maybe it's
[1:02:47] a it's not a curse. and he he talks to
[1:02:50] somebody and he interprets his dreams
[1:02:51] and he tells them, "Look, I'm kind of in
[1:02:54] I'm going through it right now."
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Like, I'm going through it right now. I
[1:02:58] I got a thorn right now, but when you
[1:03:00] get to the the the Pharaoh's would you
[1:03:03] remember me? Would you tell him about
[1:03:05] me? I'm going through it right now. I
[1:03:07] don't know why I'm going through it, but
[1:03:09] I know it must be from the Lord. And why
[1:03:12] did he go? But see what happened was all
[1:03:15] that time and we know this. This is just
[1:03:16] basic Bible stuff. But it's just good to
[1:03:18] review this. It's good to think about
[1:03:20] this. It was just the Lord molding his
[1:03:23] character all the way through. Oh,
[1:03:25] there's a little part. You know, Brother
[1:03:27] Ram says that Joseph was perfect
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; except he had something on his life.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; He was ashamed
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; of who he was.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Don't tell them
[1:03:39] Don't tell them that we uh heard sheep.
[1:03:41] Don't tell them that we're ministers of
[1:03:43] the gospel.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Don't tell them that we're message
[1:03:46] believers. Tell them we're some Tell
[1:03:47] them we're just good church people.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; How many times have I been ashamed of
[1:03:51] what I believe and yet he said that was
[1:03:52] a mark on his life. But his attitude
[1:03:54] stayed right. His mind stayed right and
[1:03:58] he was being reproached.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; But he didn't curse God.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; And then he was delivered out of it into
[1:04:06] second to the Pharaoh.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; And and then we say, "Oh, you know, the
[1:04:10] Lord, it's delivering." No, no, no. It's
[1:04:12] not just a deliverance. I want to tell
[1:04:13] you something that there is, and I hope
[1:04:15] that you could catch this statement for
[1:04:17] what I mean it for. There is a victory
[1:04:20] that is greater than deliverance.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; There is a victory greater than, you
[1:04:26] know, if you if you pray to God, Lord,
[1:04:27] I'm sick. I want you to heal me. It's
[1:04:30] right in the Bible. You can and probably
[1:04:32] will be healed if your faith can touch
[1:04:34] God. Yes. Right. Have you been healed
[1:04:36] before? But if you live long enough,
[1:04:38] you're going to get sick again.
[1:04:42] You know, he could even raise you from
[1:04:44] the dead, physically raise you from the
[1:04:46] dead, and if you live long enough, and
[1:04:49] he doesn't come, you're going to die.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; There is a victory that is greater than
[1:04:55] just him delivering you out of your
[1:04:57] trials and out of your circumstances.
[1:05:00] There's a greater greater victory, and
[1:05:02] that is to see his character taking
[1:05:05] place in your life, coming to fruition
[1:05:07] in your life. Because when his brothers
[1:05:10] came, see if he would approached his
[1:05:11] brothers back there after they thrown
[1:05:13] him in the pit,
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; he might not have had the right
[1:05:15] reaction. I believe I believe that he
[1:05:18] would have reached for the sword.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Instead, he reaches for grain.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Grain.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; When he had the chance to get revenge,
[1:05:28] he didn't take and instead he saved a
[1:05:31] nation.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; You want to talk about a counterweight?
[1:05:35] You want to talk about all the things
[1:05:37] that Joseph went through? Why was it so
[1:05:39] heavy? Why the ditches? Why the slave
[1:05:41] carts? Why Potterer's wife? Why the
[1:05:44] dungeon? Because those things do not
[1:05:46] stop the plan of God.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; In fact, by those things, the plan of
[1:05:50] God is carried out.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Because that gave him the
[1:05:53] characteristics to say, "When I have the
[1:05:56] chance to get back at you justly,
[1:06:01] justly." He could have justly
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; thrown them in jail, killed them by the
[1:06:06] sword, and he would have been justified.
[1:06:07] He instead saved a nation.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Because he, now listen, he could not
[1:06:13] have done that without a counterweight.
[1:06:16] He could he he was reach listen Joseph
[1:06:18] was reaching out to something he never
[1:06:22] could have reached before unless he had
[1:06:24] a lot of heartaches, a lot of
[1:06:26] persecutions. Listen, I read Revelations
[1:06:28] 5. There was a book in the hand that
[1:06:33] listen no man was worthy to take.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you this by
[1:06:38] revelation Jesus was not worthy to take
[1:06:42] that book.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; No man in heaven no man in earth or
[1:06:46] under the earth. But see what happened
[1:06:48] was is Jesus had thorns come into his
[1:06:51] life so that he could have the proper
[1:06:54] counterweight so he could walk forward
[1:06:56] and reach something that he could not
[1:06:58] have reached before.
[1:07:01] The thorns, the the the cross, the
[1:07:03] nails, all those things made him worthy.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; It made him worthy.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; That's why it had to be a lamb. It had
[1:07:12] to be somebody who went through
[1:07:14] something.
[1:07:16] You say through something through the
[1:07:18] greatest trials and tribulations that a
[1:07:21] human being can face. That's what he
[1:07:23] went through. For what? That there was a
[1:07:26] thorn called Calvary.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; So that he could do Oh man. So he could
[1:07:32] do something that he could not have done
[1:07:34] without it.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; He could not have done it without that.
[1:07:38] That's what I read in the word to to
[1:07:41] grab somebody. I hope that you could see
[1:07:44] this. to save you and me who were
[1:07:47] unsavable.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm not that bad. I
[1:07:52] wasn't I'm not like so and so."
[1:07:54] Unsavable.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; You are not savable.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; And he had to do something to reach out
[1:08:02] that nobody could save you
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; unless they were made worthy to save
[1:08:07] you.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; There had to be a thorn.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; There had to be it.
[1:08:12] Jesus even goes to the garden and prays,
[1:08:14] you know, let the I I don't know if I
[1:08:16] want this and I wonder if God gave him a
[1:08:18] little viewpoint. Wait a minute. I have
[1:08:21] a bigger picture in mind. Oh, you know
[1:08:23] what, Lord? Not my will.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Not my will. You say, "Not Jesus." If
[1:08:27] you face it, Jesus faced it.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; If you face a temptation, if you face a
[1:08:33] thought, an improper thought about what
[1:08:36] the then Jesus faced it.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want I'm not going through
[1:08:40] anything that God hasn't gone through
[1:08:42] himself and knows exactly what I'm
[1:08:43] dealing with, exactly how I think and
[1:08:45] says, "Now wait a minute. There's a new
[1:08:48] way to think about this."
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; There was a counterbalance called
[1:08:53] Calvary.
[1:08:56] And you want to do something for God.
[1:08:57] You want to walk closer to God. You want
[1:08:59] to live a life for God. You want to
[1:09:00] reach a place. Listen, if you want to
[1:09:02] reach a place in God that you've never
[1:09:04] reached before, you're going to have a
[1:09:06] thorn.
[1:09:09] Now, now an illegitimate child, this is
[1:09:12] what they'll do.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know if I can handle
[1:09:15] anymore. Maybe I'm just fine right where
[1:09:18] I'm at with God.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; You know what my I think I talked about
[1:09:23] this a couple times ago. My ratio
[1:09:26] of sacrifice to reward is just where I
[1:09:30] like it. I don't have to give up too
[1:09:33] much and I'm happy with what I'm
[1:09:35] getting.
[1:09:39] The ratio of my service to the Lord is
[1:09:42] it's just where I like it.
[1:09:45] It's just where I like it. But a child
[1:09:48] of God is not satisfied with that. And
[1:09:50] let me tell you this, God is not
[1:09:52] satisfied with that either.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; And if he's got to say, "Oh, well, you
[1:09:55] know, um, you know, there's another
[1:09:57] example of thorns, like brother Brandham
[1:09:59] preaches about the nest." Well, if I got
[1:10:01] to take a few feathers out and you're
[1:10:03] saying, "Lord, I can't I cannot I cannot
[1:10:06] handle what you're going through." And
[1:10:07] he says, "You can't handle it.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; You can handle it because you're my
[1:10:11] child and I will get you through."
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, well, that's just so
[1:10:16] simple." But see, what's going to happen
[1:10:17] is you think Satan's not going to attack
[1:10:19] you. You know, here's what Satan's going
[1:10:20] to do. He's going to come around and say
[1:10:21] this. And he's and he's and he's done
[1:10:23] this to every person that's tried to do
[1:10:25] something for the Lord and is going
[1:10:27] through a trial. You know, if you were
[1:10:29] if you were doing things right, this
[1:10:31] wouldn't be happening to you.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; You know, if if the Lord was really on
[1:10:35] your side,
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; things wouldn't be going bad like this.
[1:10:42] Why? Because he knows. He knows
[1:10:47] what that counterbalance is going to
[1:10:49] give you.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Because he's the tool that God uses a
[1:10:54] lot of times to give you that
[1:10:55] counterbalance. Do you know how many
[1:10:56] victories Satan has seen happen in
[1:10:59] people's life? I I you know I just You
[1:11:01] know why I love testimonies? Because we
[1:11:03] get to rub it in the face
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; of the one being put on this earth to
[1:11:09] stop us from doing the thing that God
[1:11:11] allowed us to do. We get to say, "You
[1:11:13] know what, Satan? Despite all the things
[1:11:15] you put me through and all the thoughts
[1:11:17] you put in my head and all those things,
[1:11:19] I still was brought through by the
[1:11:22] Lord." That's what testimonies are.
[1:11:24] Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; The Lord still did this to me.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; And and Satan will say, "Oh, yeah, but
[1:11:32] look at what you're going through. Oh,
[1:11:33] you you're serving the Lord and yet your
[1:11:35] family's falling apart. You're serving
[1:11:37] the Lord and yet you've lost this.
[1:11:38] You've lost businesses. You've lost
[1:11:40] money. You've lost houses. You've lo
[1:11:41] whatever it might be. You lost
[1:11:42] reputation.
[1:11:44] You've lost all those things.
[1:11:47] But I've gained a revelation like no
[1:11:51] other has had until this time.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; I've gained more than I've lost. If if
[1:11:58] you want to destroy this flesh, listen.
[1:12:01] Now you can see Job's mentality. Oh, no.
[1:12:03] No. Satan, though you destroy this body,
[1:12:06] the skin worms can eat this. I'm still
[1:12:08] going to praise the Lord. I'm still
[1:12:10] going to thank him. If you kill me, I'm
[1:12:14] still going to trust in the Lord. If God
[1:12:17] himself comes down and kills me, I'm
[1:12:19] still going to trust in the Lord. Why?
[1:12:21] Because I've caught a view from his
[1:12:24] eyes.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; I've caught a a little perspective of
[1:12:28] what my life looks like through the eyes
[1:12:30] of God, a real revelation. See, that is
[1:12:34] a perfect revelation. And if you have
[1:12:37] that perfect revelation, don't think
[1:12:39] that you're not going to get a trial.
[1:12:42] But you know what? I love my alarm's
[1:12:44] going off here. I've been 45 minutes.
[1:12:45] Can I have like can I have five minutes?
[1:12:51] When I when I when I hear testimony,
[1:12:53] when I when I see Sister Kathleen raise
[1:12:55] her hand and give a testimony, I think,
[1:12:57] man, that's exactly what God was looking
[1:13:01] for.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; When I see Sister Liz raise her hand and
[1:13:05] give a testimony about her health,
[1:13:07] that's exactly what God was looking for.
[1:13:10] And you say, "Why did he put me through
[1:13:11] this? Why did he put me through this?"
[1:13:13] because then he brought you out of it.
[1:13:15] And if we have the the the the the
[1:13:18] mindset that's correct, we'll say,
[1:13:19] "Lord, oh, now now I see the purpose of
[1:13:23] it." And you know what? Maybe maybe some
[1:13:25] of us don't get that victory. Maybe some
[1:13:27] of us go to the grave. But you know
[1:13:28] what? I believe with all my heart, I'll
[1:13:31] still raise up on that day and say,
[1:13:32] "Lord, thank you for sending me to the
[1:13:35] grave. Thank you for sending me to the
[1:13:36] grave because I never would have had I
[1:13:38] would never would have made it in you
[1:13:40] unless you did that for me." There has
[1:13:42] got to be a counterbalance behind you.
[1:13:45] Listen, trials and persecutions are not
[1:13:49] failures.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Sickness is not always a curse.
[1:13:53] Sometimes it's a blessing.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I failed again. How do you know it's
[1:13:57] not the Lord just putting another small
[1:13:59] stone in the counterwe?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, wait a minute. But I made a
[1:14:03] mistake. But yet, your footsteps are
[1:14:06] ordered by the Lord. If I made a
[1:14:09] mistake, if he's really in charge of my
[1:14:11] life, doesn't he know the mistakes I'm
[1:14:13] going to make?
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Oh man, my son, he's going to do this
[1:14:18] again and he's going to go off. He
[1:14:19] doesn't even know it. I'm going to use
[1:14:20] that for his own good. You know what?
[1:14:22] He's going to have a reach with somebody
[1:14:24] in his family. He's going to have a
[1:14:26] reach over here that he never would have
[1:14:28] had unless he makes mist. Oh. Oh, just
[1:14:30] wait till he sees my point of view of
[1:14:33] his life and how I took that wrong thing
[1:14:36] that was wrong and I turned it around
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; for his own benefit. And if listen, if
[1:14:41] he did it with Jesus, his son, is he
[1:14:43] going to do it with you? Is he going to
[1:14:45] do it with me?
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, he's going to do it.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; I I got I better stop.
[1:14:54] I'm going to read this. He says in three
[1:14:55] kinds of believers, you've got something
[1:14:57] to do. I cannot sit on the sidelines and
[1:14:59] say, "Well, you know, I'm just happy
[1:15:00] where I'm at. I'm just h" And I'm not
[1:15:02] saying that we say those words, but I'm
[1:15:04] sorry. I'm not happy with the ratio of
[1:15:08] sacrifice to reward. I I'm not happy
[1:15:11] with it. If it costs me everything, and
[1:15:13] and here's a news flash. It's going to
[1:15:16] cost you everything.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Right? So, there's no surprises down the
[1:15:19] road. It's going to cost you everything,
[1:15:22] but you gain everything. Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Now, who would want to take that?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Who would want to take that deal?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. We We got a
[1:15:32] couple. That's a hard That's a hard
[1:15:34] thing, right? Because, Brother Donald,
[1:15:36] that's as equal as saying the song,
[1:15:38] "Whatever it takes."
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; I know we've talked about this. That's a
[1:15:42] hard song. Oh, whatever it takes, Lord,
[1:15:44] to be more like you. That's what I'm
[1:15:46] willing to do. How many can sing that
[1:15:49] song
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; and mean every word?
[1:15:54] Because what you're doing, you're
[1:15:55] saying, "Lord, I accept like Jesus, I
[1:16:00] accept the thorn. I accept the trials."
[1:16:03] Not only do I accept them, I glory in
[1:16:08] them.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; In fact, when you bring them, it's my
[1:16:12] joy.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; It's my joy
[1:16:18] to go through persecution.
[1:16:21] You've got something to do. God's got
[1:16:23] something for you to do. You may have
[1:16:25] some heartaches and some troubles. Some
[1:16:27] people's look and are a little bit worse
[1:16:29] than some others, but we're all going
[1:16:32] through it. I may not go what you go
[1:16:34] through, and you may not go what I go
[1:16:35] through.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; But listen, when you hurt,
[1:16:40] I hurt.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; If we're in the same body, if we have
[1:16:43] that spirit of Christ, and when I hurt,
[1:16:45] I hope you hurt.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen.
[1:16:50] You may have some disappointments, but
[1:16:52] do we pray to shun them?
[1:16:58] A coward does.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; I've been a coward.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; I've been a coward.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; I've prayed, "Lord, I I don't want this.
[1:17:10] Lord, I can't handle this."
[1:17:14] No. Lord, take me through them. Whatever
[1:17:18] they is, whatever it is, don't let me
[1:17:20] escape them if they're set for me. Just
[1:17:23] give me the grace
[1:17:26] to go through that.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; You know what? I said I'd take five
[1:17:34] minutes and that was five minutes. I I I
[1:17:37] just forget these notes. I had like four
[1:17:38] more pages. I think that that is
[1:17:40] sufficient. I
[1:17:43] maybe you don't see the tie in with
[1:17:45] Sunday, but for me it was it was so
[1:17:48] stark just when he was brother Steve was
[1:17:50] preaching about I believe I I believe it
[1:17:52] was the Lord about when I'm going
[1:17:54] through something.
[1:17:56] Why do I take it personal?
[1:17:58] Why do I feel immediately that either
[1:18:00] someone's attacking me or that the
[1:18:01] Lord's attacking? That's exactly what
[1:18:03] the devil wants me to think
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; because now there's a conflict between
[1:18:07] me and the one who's trying to get me to
[1:18:10] a place that I never could reach unless
[1:18:14] he puts me through that. And so I I just
[1:18:16] think um
[1:18:19] I think that's sufficient. I think
[1:18:21] there's one scripture 1 Peter 5:10.
[1:18:24] But the grace, but the God of all grace,
[1:18:27] who hath called us unto his eternal
[1:18:29] glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye
[1:18:32] have suffered a while.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Not it's after you have suffered a
[1:18:38] while. Make you perfect, establish,
[1:18:42] strengthen, settle you. Amen. God bless
[1:18:45] you. Let's stand.
[1:18:51] I pray I didn't I didn't mean to shout
[1:18:53] out you. I just get I didn't used to get
[1:18:56] this excited about the word, but I get
[1:18:58] so excited about the word of God.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; I know that sounds bad, but in my mind,
[1:19:02] I I it was an intellectual conception,
[1:19:04] but when I see words coming to life off
[1:19:06] the pages, I just get excited about it.
[1:19:09] And I I hope that it's never taken
[1:19:11] personally. I'm I'm more yelling at
[1:19:13] myself because, man, I need a pep talk
[1:19:15] every once in a while. I need to
[1:19:16] remember this. Uh, you know, Wednesday,
[1:19:18] we just heard about it, but what about
[1:19:20] Thursday? What about Friday? What about
[1:19:21] Saturday? When the when the when the
[1:19:23] buffeting comes, when the blow comes,
[1:19:25] blow after blow. This has to be a
[1:19:29] revelation. It has to drop down. It's
[1:19:31] good words. We can say, "Amen." But when
[1:19:33] it drops down, you are invincible.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; You are invincible. It doesn't even mean
[1:19:40] that something can't happen to you.
[1:19:42] Right?
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; There's something on the inside that
[1:19:44] cannot be killed. It cannot be touched.
[1:19:47] Destroy this body. I don't care what's I
[1:19:49] don't care what God wants to destroy.
[1:19:51] It's going to be burned up anyways.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; But he has a new one waiting for me.
[1:19:54] Amen. Brother Steve, if you want to
[1:19:55] come, I'll just keep going if you don't
[1:19:57] come up here soon.
[1:20:00] Amen. God bless you.
[1:20:07] I think we should sing whatever it
[1:20:08] takes.
[1:20:11] And we should Because after that it's
[1:20:13] like now you can sing it with a little
[1:20:14] more faith to accept it.
[1:20:18] And
[1:20:20] see that's why you just preach whatever
[1:20:22] put the Lord puts on your heart and
[1:20:24] that's why you just preach under
[1:20:26] inspiration.
[1:20:28] And it's okay. Brother Bam said, "Hey,
[1:20:30] you know, next Sunday I'm going to be
[1:20:31] preaching on whatever he did that." And
[1:20:35] then a lot of Sundays he would do it.
[1:20:37] And some Sundays you'll notice he
[1:20:38] didn't.
[1:20:40] Some Sundays he went a different route.
[1:20:42] So that's why you follow the leading of
[1:20:44] the Lord, the inspiration because it's
[1:20:46] timely. It's very timely. We'll take
[1:20:49] requests after we sing this baby. Oh,
[1:20:52] whatever
[1:20:55] it takes
[1:20:57] to draw closer
[1:21:00] to you, Lord.
[1:21:03] That's what I'll be
[1:21:12] forever
[1:21:17] for my will to pray.
[1:21:22] That's what I'm
[1:21:27] doing.
[1:21:28] those lacking little faith. I got my
[1:21:31] will to break. I'm going to break
[1:21:33] through this time. It takes
[1:21:36] to draw closer
[1:21:40] to you, Lord.
[1:21:42] That's what I'll be willing
[1:21:47] to do
[1:21:52] for whatever
[1:21:55] it takes
[1:21:57] for my will to pray.
[1:22:03] That's what I'm willing
[1:22:07] to do.
[1:22:11] Praise the Lord. Sister Paul, you have a
[1:22:13] list up there. Maybe we could look at
[1:22:17] Cororum. We see Sister Cory
[1:22:21] Zachair
[1:22:24] Ruth Kurt
[1:22:33] ment.
[1:22:42] Oh, that was the other one.
[1:22:47] She
[1:22:49] rose
[1:22:51] some dental work. I believe
[1:22:54] there
[1:22:56] could
[1:22:59] tomorrow we have Bible study. Brother
[1:23:00] Ray and Sister Kathy is at 8 o'clock. I
[1:23:03] know it's supposed to snow.
[1:23:07] We'll announce it. I'm sorry. Did I say
[1:23:08] 8? Tomorrow's the 8th. We'll do it at 7
[1:23:13] o'clock. On the 8th. At 7 o'clock. Okay.
[1:23:18] All right. Any other prayer requests?
[1:23:23] Okay. We'll have Sister Pauline put
[1:23:25] these up there so we can refer to them.
[1:23:28] Brother, I was going to say, Brother
[1:23:30] Tim, sister Mary's back there helping us
[1:23:32] with the sound today. Sister Mary, if
[1:23:34] you could put a song on there. We'll go
[1:23:37] to pray at this time. Lord bless you.
