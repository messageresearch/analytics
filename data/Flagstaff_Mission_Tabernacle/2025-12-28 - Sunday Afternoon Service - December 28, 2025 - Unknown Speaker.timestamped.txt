[7:48] Heat. Heat.
[8:20] I love
[8:23] you.
[9:24] And we'll sing this little song.
[9:34] If it wasn't
[9:36] for the light
[9:40] where
[9:42] this should be once again I beg God
[9:49] for
[9:53] I
[10:00] for Jes. Jesus
[10:02] is the lighthouse
[10:06] and from the rock of sin.
[10:11] He has shown a light around me
[10:18] that I might clearly see.
[10:24] If it wasn't
[10:27] for the lighthouse,
[10:31] where
[10:33] would this
[10:35] be?
[10:37] Amen. Good to see each one this evening.
[10:40] A little chorus that we haven't sang in
[10:42] a while. He carth for you. He carth for
[10:45] you. And I thought that's exactly what
[10:48] he showed again himself. He cared for
[10:51] me. He spoke to me this morning. He
[10:54] carth for you. Amen. Through sunshine or
[10:57] shadow. Amen.
[11:00] He
[11:02] can. That's probably too low,
[11:04] sweetheart. He
[11:08] He car for you.
[11:15] Oh, he
[11:17] car
[11:18] for you
[11:21] through
[11:23] sunshine
[11:25] or shadow.
[11:30] He
[11:32] car
[11:34] for you once again.
[11:37] Oh, he
[11:39] carth for you.
[11:45] And he
[11:48] car
[11:50] for you.
[11:54] And through
[11:57] sunshine
[12:03] he
[12:05] car.
[12:10] Let's bow our heads together and
[12:11] remember Tom and Sister Cindy again. And
[12:14] then any unspoken prayer requests, we
[12:16] just lift up your hand and make it known
[12:18] to the Lord. We're sure he'll meet those
[12:21] needs. Heavenly Father, Lord, we bow
[12:23] before you once again. And we're
[12:25] reminded, Lord, of your greatness and
[12:27] your power. And Lord, we think upon that
[12:30] as we come before you this evening. And
[12:32] Lord, we'd asked, Father, you'd be with
[12:34] us, Lord. Would you be with Brother Tom
[12:36] and sister Cindy, Lord, and help our
[12:39] brother and sister recover, Lord? We
[12:42] know you're the great almighty healer
[12:44] and you're more than able, Lord. We're
[12:46] not afraid to face whatever that thing
[12:48] is that is besetting us, Lord. And we
[12:51] bind Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus
[12:53] Christ, Lord, that your believers may be
[12:55] loosed and may be free from all
[12:58] sickness, Father, that ails them. We ask
[13:00] you to come and be with us this evening,
[13:02] Lord. And would you just minister to our
[13:04] hearts? Would you show us, Father, what
[13:07] you're doing and your power and how
[13:09] great you are, Lord, through this little
[13:12] report that's going to be given, Father?
[13:13] We just ask that you'd be with our
[13:15] service. May we see you once again in
[13:18] our midst. And we ask in Jesus Christ's
[13:20] name we pray. Amen.
[13:24] May be seated. Amen.
[13:28] Little course, Jesus on the inside.
[13:30] Amen. Brother Andrew, don't get to see
[13:33] you too much afterwards, but I'm going
[13:34] to give you a rose over the pulpit here.
[13:37] Your family is wonderful. I've seen your
[13:40] boys and I uh I have a lot of respect
[13:43] for him. So, I want you to know that
[13:46] Sister Tracy, you guys have raised a
[13:48] good family. Amen. Jesus. Jesus on the
[13:51] inside. Oh, Jesus on the inside working
[13:56] on the outside. Heat. Heat.
[14:08] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[14:18] Heat. Heat.
[14:35] The world on the inside
[14:45] is the world on the inside.
[14:51] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[15:01] Oh
[15:03] my GO
[15:26] the Holy Ghost on the inside
[15:31] Making
[15:33] my life
[15:41] making the difference in my life.
[15:46] Oh
[15:52] my.
[15:56] Oh Jesus on the inside working on the
[16:00] outside. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[16:11] Heat. Heat.
[16:22] Oh, what a change in my life.
[16:27] Oh, what a change
[16:32] in my life.
[16:38] Amen.
[16:40] It's not by might. It's not by power,
[16:42] but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. Amen.
[16:45] Amen. Good to see each other one other
[16:48] one of you. gonna give a quick report if
[16:51] it's okay for dad. So, dad uh has moved
[16:53] from the hospital. He was in the
[16:55] hospital for about a week. He's now in
[16:58] uh um a building something. Thank you.
[17:02] Northern Arizona rehab on Gemini. And
[17:05] so, he's he's got a little bit of time
[17:07] there he's going to have to do, but uh
[17:09] give him a little bit of time and he
[17:11] just wants to he saw the service this
[17:13] morning, enjoyed each one. So you don't,
[17:17] you know, sometimes you don't think
[17:18] somebody's watching you. Well, that
[17:20] little allseeing eye, you know, pointing
[17:23] and, you know, it registers where you're
[17:25] smiling or happy or not happy. And so he
[17:29] was happy to be here. Amen. It's not by
[17:32] might, it's not by might,
[17:35] it's not by power,
[17:38] but by my spirit, say the Lord.
[17:43] is not
[17:49] by my spirit.
[18:10] Heat.
[18:14] Heat.
[18:24] is my
[18:35] mountain
[18:37] shall be
[18:40] this mountain
[18:42] shall be
[18:45] this mountain
[18:47] shall be
[18:50] my
[18:56] Amen. Are we taking an offering this
[18:58] evening? All right. If you have an
[18:59] offering, give it to one of the deacons
[19:01] and they'll put on the back desk. Make
[19:03] sure that it goes where it is. We have a
[19:05] couple of uh specials and brother
[19:07] Rolando. Is Brother Rolando here? I
[19:10] don't see him. So, um,
[19:15] you have a song, the Bohannan Sisters.
[19:17] Did I get that right? It said girls. And
[19:20] so I figured sisters if I got that
[19:22] right. So if you'd make ready at this
[19:24] time also want to remember the
[19:26] announcements that were made coming up
[19:28] on this coming June January 5th in the
[19:31] afternoons they will be holding a
[19:34] Spanish service. So I want to make
[19:36] mention of that and so you
[20:22] Every battle that I've had to face,
[20:27] led me right back to your amazing grace.
[20:32] Even in trles, I knew that I would be
[20:37] safe.
[20:42] You were my shelter in the weight of the
[20:45] storm. The once shook my heart till you
[20:49] brought me to shore. Now I'm in all the
[20:54] way that your love takes.
[21:01] I've seen lights shining in the darkest
[21:05] of places. I've seen your heart loving,
[21:09] embracing and chasing the lost and the
[21:12] lonely, the hopeless, the broken, and
[21:16] me.
[21:18] And that's why I
[21:21] believe.
[21:39] I thought I was falling, that it was the
[21:43] end. But you were beneath me with your
[21:47] steady hand. And you keep showing up
[21:51] again and again and again.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; With wings like eagles. You've helped me
[22:01] to soar. You've brought me to heights
[22:05] like never before. And you never grow
[22:09] weary of showing me so much more.
[22:16] I've seen lights shining in the darkest
[22:20] of places. I've seen your heart loving,
[22:24] embracing and chasing the lost and the
[22:27] lonely, the hopeless, the broken and
[22:33] that's why I
[22:36] believe.
[22:43] That's why I
[22:45] believe you'll never stop loving
[22:50] me.
[22:52] That's why I
[22:55] believe.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well done, sisters. That was
[23:08] absolutely beautiful.
[23:10] And we've asked brother Isaac to come
[23:13] and in November uh spent a couple weeks
[23:17] in Peru. Brother Isaac, my son, and then
[23:21] brother Isaac Hatfield who will be with
[23:23] us uh three four weeks I guess from
[23:27] today. No, three weeks. Three weeks from
[23:28] today, he'll be with us. And we'll be
[23:31] doing also two services on that day. And
[23:34] I thought we'd have both of them uh
[23:37] different perspectives of course and uh
[23:40] just talk about how what they saw in
[23:43] Peru and and just give a little report
[23:46] on the work there. On Sunday after
[23:49] Thanksgiving, we did a little bit. Uh
[23:51] but these brothers went places that uh
[23:53] that I didn't go. They spent a four or
[23:55] five days in the jungle and where the
[23:57] mosquitoes are and and uh the what were
[24:00] they called? The sand fleas. and and so
[24:03] they they did the real missionary work
[24:04] and I was doing a little bit of
[24:06] evangelism work. So anyways, we thought
[24:08] we'd have brother Isaac give a report
[24:10] and um so yeah, Sister Cammy, let's sing
[24:14] while he comes up. I like that Jesus on
[24:17] the inside. One of my favorite songs
[24:19] there. Jesus on the inside working on
[24:22] the outside
[24:24] as brother Isaac would come.
[24:29] Oh Jesus on the inside. You can stand
[24:33] with us outside. Oh, what a change in my
[24:38] life.
[24:40] It's Jesus on the inside.
[24:57] Heat. Heat.
[25:14] Amen.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; 23. There we go. That'll be all the
[25:23] singing. If you wouldn't mind, just
[25:25] before we get into this, um, turn to
[25:28] John 13.
[25:32] um a little bit weird of a reading for
[25:34] missionary report, but
[25:37] I kind of just was, you know, looking
[25:39] through preparing the PowerPoint and
[25:41] stuff and I was I just asked the Lord, I
[25:44] want to give the people something more
[25:47] than just, you know, we went it was
[25:49] great and you know, my life has changed.
[25:51] Although that's important, but I just I
[25:54] you know, so I felt the Lord impressed
[25:56] like, well, what did you walk away with?
[25:58] Maybe I can give that to you. Um, and so
[26:03] what I left Peru with was,
[26:06] um, how can I take my belief to the next
[26:10] level or my servitude to the next level?
[26:12] And I don't want that to sound, um, new
[26:15] age or whatever, but it's really what's
[26:17] in my heart. And it's kind of humorous
[26:20] that this this scripture came to mind,
[26:21] but I think it's important. Um, of
[26:24] course we read it every time we do
[26:26] communion, but um, growing up I kind of
[26:29] always laughed at Peter like, you know,
[26:31] he it just kind of seemed like he was
[26:33] doing a flip-flop, so to speak. But this
[26:36] scripture is what I want to do, you
[26:39] know, and we'll read it. So John 13:6,
[26:43] then cometh he to Simon Peter, and Peter
[26:45] saith unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my
[26:48] feet? Jesus answered and said unto him,
[26:51] "What I do, thou knowest not now, but
[26:54] thou shalt know hereafter." Peter said
[26:57] unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my
[26:59] feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash
[27:02] thee not, thou has no part with me."
[27:04] Just real simple. And Simon Peter Peter
[27:09] said unto him, "Lord, not my feet only,
[27:11] but also my hands and my head." Down to
[27:15] verse 13. You call me master and lord
[27:17] and you say well for so I am. If I then
[27:20] your lord and master have washed your
[27:22] feet, you also ought to wash one
[27:24] another's feet. For I give have given
[27:27] you an example that you should do as I
[27:29] have done unto you. Verily verily I say
[27:32] unto you, the servant is not greater
[27:35] than his lord, nor is he that is sent
[27:38] greater than he that sent him. If you
[27:41] know these things, happy are you if you
[27:43] do them. It's just our hearts.
[27:46] Dear heavenly father, we come before you
[27:48] tonight, Lord, just trusting that in
[27:51] this uh telling Lord of our journey,
[27:55] Lord, that you could be magnified in
[27:57] some way. And maybe just light a fire in
[28:00] somebody's heart, Lord, to just go the
[28:03] extra step, Lord. Maybe
[28:06] like Jesus said, if if a mile is asked
[28:08] of you, go too, maybe we just take our
[28:11] walk, Lord. just a just that extra mile,
[28:14] Lord. And uh we ask these things in
[28:17] Jesus name. Amen. You can be seated.
[28:21] I'll move down to the lower platform
[28:23] here, but um yeah, so this was my I
[28:28] think this was my fourth time going to
[28:30] Peru. And every time um I don't want to
[28:34] say you if we could take the stage
[28:36] lighting down to zero, that'd be great.
[28:39] Um, but every time you go, you kind of
[28:41] walk away with, you know, a nugget, so
[28:43] to speak, and you feel, at least I do,
[28:46] you feel um kind of ashamed at where
[28:49] your spiritual walk is at the time, you
[28:52] know, cuz you you can come here and you
[28:53] can sit on a computer that you can go to
[28:55] work and you're just here two days a
[28:56] week and, you know, it's not
[29:00] I'm just going to speak freely and if I
[29:02] say I or we, just, you know, hear me
[29:04] correctly. But um sometimes we can get
[29:07] complacent or not appreciate what we
[29:10] have.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; And so when you go down there and you
[29:15] know we went to this one church and
[29:16] every time they prayed and maybe there
[29:19] was some Catholicism still left over,
[29:22] but they would kneel down every time
[29:23] they prayed. And you know my first
[29:25] thought is like you know I have to kneel
[29:27] down on this muddy floor. You know my
[29:28] pants are going to get ruined. You know
[29:30] I'm just telling you the thoughts that
[29:32] go through my mind. And so we're just if
[29:34] you kneel down here, you're not having
[29:35] that thought like, "Oh, my knees are
[29:37] going to get dirty." But then again,
[29:38] they don't have that thought, you know,
[29:40] they just kneel down and in their
[29:42] sincerity, they're just doing it for the
[29:44] Lord. And so it just, like I said, it
[29:47] kind of, you know, my prayer was, "Lord,
[29:50] what should I walk away from this?"
[29:52] Because you have that every time you go
[29:53] like, "I'm a terrible Christian." You
[29:56] know, you kind of have that thought. But
[29:58] my take I wanted my takeaway to be
[30:00] positive. And so hopefully I can pass
[30:02] that on to you that um maybe that
[30:05] conviction could be a good thing, but
[30:07] you know I had said here before don't
[30:09] let that conviction turn into
[30:11] condemnation. You know, turn it into
[30:13] something good.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Um so we can go
[30:18] this uh the background to this I just it
[30:20] didn't fit. You know, I had to admit a
[30:22] lot of pictures, but I we went to a
[30:24] really beautiful place. So we'll just
[30:25] start with a a high note. And I omitted
[30:27] all the food pictures, so you don't have
[30:30] to worry about that. Um, but I'll go to
[30:33] the next slide here.
[30:36] I'm supposed to do that. Sorry.
[30:39] Um, yeah. So, this is um I kind of wrote
[30:43] down put some red pins of where we were.
[30:45] So, obviously Lima is still yellow, but
[30:48] we flew um the second day I was there.
[30:51] her dad and I and Marcelo and our
[30:54] interpreter. We flew to Hyen, which is
[30:56] the on the left side, the third red
[30:58] bubble down. Um, and we drove from H
[31:01] Highen to San Agnosio. And I just had
[31:04] some cuz I know Dad talked about how fun
[31:07] the truck ride was, you know, around
[31:09] different places, but Hyen to Sanosio,
[31:12] just cuz I'm visual, is 42 miles as the
[31:15] crow flies, and that took 2 and 1 half
[31:17] hours. So, not not a terrible drive um
[31:20] by a truck, but when we went from San
[31:22] Ignasio
[31:24] um to that my wording got deleted up
[31:28] there, but that's we went to Lagona de
[31:30] San Pablo, that's 38 miles as the crow
[31:33] flies and it took us 11 hours in a drop.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; So, for perspective, um I have that
[31:40] here. Yeah, 38 miles as the crow flies
[31:42] is from here to Cottonwood. So that's,
[31:45] you know, taking 11 hours in the back of
[31:47] a truck to get to Cottonwood. It just,
[31:49] you know, for me felt like, man, this is
[31:51] is crazy, but it's sad. I think did the
[31:54] brothers say they haven't had a visitor
[31:55] in it was like 8 years or something. And
[31:59] so you understand why people don't go
[32:00] there, but then it makes you sad. Like
[32:02] again we're you know how many times we
[32:05] could ask anybody here we've had a
[32:06] visitor once a month or you know so it
[32:08] makes you feel um humbled um maybe could
[32:12] vict
[32:14] and and makes you um sad like one of the
[32:17] places we went like you know they don't
[32:19] have the the brother didn't have Wi-Fi
[32:22] and we'll get into that a little bit
[32:23] later just because it was dad brought
[32:25] his Starlink and we were able to help
[32:27] people because Voice of God they sent
[32:29] down was it 5,000 tablets
[32:32] Um, so they set down 5,000 tablets,
[32:34] which is awesome, but the part that's
[32:36] not awesome is a lot of these places
[32:38] don't have Wi-Fi. And one of the
[32:40] brothers who owned one of the tablets
[32:41] couldn't read or write. And so we had a
[32:44] questions and answer service and he was
[32:45] kind of odd about, you know, writing in
[32:47] his question, of course. Um, and so dad
[32:51] brought the Starlink and we were able
[32:52] to, um, he had never seen the cloud
[32:54] picture before cuz he had an old older
[32:57] version of the tablet that didn't have
[32:59] that updated. Um, and so we were able to
[33:02] help him get I think the rest of the
[33:04] sermons downloaded and he can kind of
[33:07] the audio so he can kind of figure out
[33:09] navigate even without being able to read
[33:11] on his tablet and listen to the words.
[33:13] So that was that was cool because he has
[33:16] no Wi-Fi to update it. So now he has,
[33:18] you know, the the cloud picture and the
[33:21] color fire picture. He has that all that
[33:22] on there now. So that was really cool to
[33:25] me. Maybe that was just a little thing
[33:26] because again like you know how many of
[33:28] us have 10 of those in our home you know
[33:30] or we have the cell phone and we can
[33:32] read and write like that's just um you
[33:35] know on the very simplest level that's
[33:36] something we take for granted just the
[33:38] opportunity to learn in school those
[33:41] things that you know this brother didn't
[33:42] have. Um
[33:45] so this one um yeah this is um this was
[33:50] the first uh day that we were there. We
[33:53] went from Hyen which is um that bottom
[33:57] red dot and we drove to Sanosio. Um we
[33:59] actually drove to Selendina which is um
[34:02] to the east of Sanasio I believe. And
[34:05] this is the place just so you kind of
[34:06] have a visual. This is um this is the
[34:09] church that dad when he tells his
[34:11] testimony where him and brother Jerry
[34:13] had that supernatural experience um with
[34:16] the scriptures where they both read the
[34:18] same scripture and preached on the same
[34:20] scripture I believe. So this was this is
[34:22] that church so it was kind of cool for
[34:24] you know me. I just thought I'd pass
[34:25] that along. I'm going to try to it's a
[34:28] video I'm going to try to play.
[34:35] You are
[34:47] children.
[35:02] Um, yeah. So, my video skills weren't
[35:04] great. I started in the middle of the
[35:06] chorus and ended in the middle of the
[35:07] verse. But that's something keeps
[35:09] holding me. So, just if you didn't
[35:11] recognize it there. So, that was the
[35:12] first service. Um, in the evening, dad
[35:15] spoke and then the next day we had
[35:17] questions and answers, which you know, I
[35:19] asked dad like it seems that when you
[35:22] have these services, they're
[35:24] super important like they always seem
[35:25] like they have an impact. you know, just
[35:28] being able to interact with the people
[35:29] and services are great, but getting on a
[35:32] personal level and letting them um maybe
[35:36] put forward what their need is because
[35:37] sometimes it's not always I need
[35:39] healing. Sometimes they're being
[35:41] tortured by a question and you can't
[35:43] there's not really an avenue for that in
[35:45] a service. So, um I always thought that
[35:47] they were good and this is the questions
[35:50] and answer service. It was kind of in a
[35:51] a home. Um and I think there's a
[35:55] recording here as well.
[35:58] Gloria.
[36:21] So, they um sang a little bit before the
[36:23] questions and answer service. And uh we
[36:26] can omit this on the stream if we need
[36:28] to, but I was I wasn't going to say
[36:31] this, but I will. Um so, one of the
[36:34] brothers that was traveling with us, he
[36:36] had had some
[36:38] um difficulties with a brother. There
[36:41] was some problems in their church. this
[36:43] brother that traveled with us, he hadn't
[36:45] seen um another person from the church
[36:48] he used to go to for several years. They
[36:50] hadn't spoken to each other and you know
[36:52] kind of when they would see each other
[36:53] on the street, it was you know walk to
[36:55] the other side of the street type thing.
[36:58] Um, and so we both, you know, both of
[37:00] those brothers are in Lima. You know, we
[37:02] both flew two hours and then drove two
[37:04] hours. And we get to this remote town in
[37:08] the middle of nowhere and this other
[37:10] brother from Lima is there. And it was
[37:13] in my eyes, it brought some
[37:14] reconciliation between the two brothers,
[37:16] you know, like we're that wasn't by
[37:18] chance. We're in the middle of nowhere
[37:20] and there's these two brothers who live
[37:22] five miles from each other who won't
[37:23] talk, you know? So to me it did
[37:25] something because by the end they at
[37:27] least said God bless you to each other.
[37:29] So some progress was made. Um and then I
[37:33] thought this was interesting. Um I just
[37:35] wrote down the questions that were asked
[37:37] just because I thought um we might like
[37:40] to see those. What is the difference
[37:41] between the spirit and soul?
[37:44] How can I receive the Holy Spirit?
[37:49] Um what things do I have to do to become
[37:51] a minister?
[37:54] Is it okay to joke and use nicknames?
[37:58] Kind of a cultural question, I guess. Is
[38:01] it okay to play soccer and have a soccer
[38:03] field? Are there quotes against it? Um,
[38:05] and maybe some of the confusion or um,
[38:10] you know, maybe related to that
[38:11] question, of course, there's always the
[38:13] the game questions, but um, in uh,
[38:17] Spanish, the word for soccer is
[38:18] football. And you know, it's kind of a
[38:21] So maybe when they hear football on
[38:22] tape, they get kind of a maybe not the
[38:25] wrong idea. Of course, I'll let the
[38:27] pastor handle that, but maybe that plays
[38:29] into the confusion. Um, is it okay for a
[38:32] Christian to use high heels outside of
[38:35] the church?
[38:37] Um, did Mary have any other kids after
[38:39] Jesus? And dad let me answer the last
[38:41] one, so that was really nice. So,
[38:45] &gt;&gt; I do not. Um anyway, so then uh yeah, we
[38:50] went from Salventina to San Agnosio. We
[38:53] had um a ministers meeting there. Um uh
[38:58] I don't think they've ever done that,
[38:59] right? There's nine or 10 ministers
[39:02] within a two-hour radius. And of course,
[39:04] you know how dad is. He has a gift of
[39:06] bringing people together. So, um
[39:08] everybody but one brother came. And I'm
[39:11] I'm just going to be raw, so if you want
[39:13] to delete the stream, you can. But one
[39:14] brother didn't come. And um you know,
[39:17] dad went over to his house afterwards
[39:19] and
[39:23] gave his wife some dresses and
[39:27] again I saw some, you know,
[39:28] reconciliation cuz I haven't seen this
[39:31] brother for five years. I don't know if
[39:33] dad has seen him recently, but you know,
[39:36] he got wounded and kind of pulled away.
[39:38] and um just to see the spirit of Christ
[39:41] in dad to bring that unity and
[39:44] fellowship and that brother that brother
[39:46] apologized and so you just you know
[39:49] those are the things that are impactful
[39:51] to me.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Um so and maybe just being raw because
[39:58] you know we know what that feels like
[39:59] some of the the division or some of
[40:02] those things when you see some
[40:04] reconciliation
[40:06] um it brings hope.
[40:10] So, and I'm sorry, it's just it's me.
[40:11] So, if it's if it's too raw, it's I
[40:14] don't know what to do. Um, we went to um
[40:17] from San Agnosio, we went to Aranche and
[40:19] had a service there. And then then I
[40:22] didn't have a video of that um because
[40:24] he made me speak, so I didn't get the
[40:27] privilege to take any photos there. But
[40:29] um then we got up the next morning and
[40:31] we left um at 5:00 and we drove. This is
[40:35] where we drove from Flagstaff to
[40:37] Cottonwood so to speak and it took um 11
[40:40] hours. So I have a video here and if you
[40:42] look I have a still shot after so if you
[40:44] miss it in the in the panning of the
[40:46] video you can see it but just to show
[40:48] how
[40:50] crazy the road was. Um it was hard to
[40:53] get videos of course but um it's super
[40:57] steep. It's carved out of a mountain.
[40:59] Um, you know, there's one place that,
[41:01] you know, a mudslide had just come
[41:03] through and, you know, one m wrong move
[41:05] and you're 2,000 ft down. You know, it'd
[41:08] be like, um, so the the as you're
[41:11] driving on the road, if you can kind of
[41:13] envision this, you have the cliff on
[41:15] your left side, let's say, and the wall
[41:18] on your right side is like two or three
[41:19] times as high as the truck. So, just to
[41:21] see how steep that terrain is. Um, but
[41:25] we'll play this here.
[41:27] So, if you look across the canyon, you
[41:29] can kind of see a faint line. And that's
[41:31] what we were driving through. And you
[41:32] can see you're just cutting in and out
[41:34] of those little um you know, of the
[41:38] valley or of the creek when it comes
[41:39] through. You got all these little things
[41:41] you're just cutting in and out of. And
[41:42] again, it's 38 miles as the crow flies.
[41:45] So, you can see that faint line just,
[41:47] you know, right up top. So, um pretty
[41:51] pretty wild terrain. Well, we got there.
[41:53] Um, and we got to Laguna de San Pablo,
[41:57] which is where um the uh where we had a
[42:01] a church dedication. This is where they
[42:03] hadn't had a visitor in about eight
[42:05] years. And I don't know if dad said this
[42:07] or not, but dad was supposed to go to
[42:09] this church um 18 years ago. Um and then
[42:13] he got called home because William was
[42:16] coming into this world. So um yeah, they
[42:19] had to wait um 18 years and dad finally
[42:22] made it there. But they had built a
[42:23] building finally and we were kind of
[42:26] there for um some church dedication is
[42:29] what it was. And we drove, you know, 11
[42:32] hours, 12 hours in the back of the
[42:34] truck. Um got there at about 5, had
[42:36] dinner and um just to give you
[42:40] perspective, if if your song leader's 5
[42:42] minutes late, it's not the end of the
[42:44] world because we got there at 5:00 and
[42:47] church was supposed to be at 7. And um
[42:49] at 7:00 the pastor's like, "Okay, I'll
[42:51] come pick you up." and we're at the the
[42:53] hotel and um it's 7 7:30 all four of us
[42:58] fell asleep. The pastor knocks on the
[43:00] door at 9:00 like hey let's walk to
[43:02] church. So well the reason was and you
[43:04] can understand there was a lot of um
[43:06] believers from the surrounding mountain
[43:08] like that brother who couldn't read. Um
[43:10] some of them walked six hours to get to
[43:12] church and you know it's not it's not
[43:15] nice terrain like imagine navigating
[43:17] part of the Grand Canyon just to get to
[43:19] church you know. Um, so they all got in
[43:22] and then we had church and it was it was
[43:24] really good. Um, there was it's a small
[43:26] town so you know you have a loudspeaker
[43:28] and you know most of the town could
[43:30] probably hear. So there was a lot of um
[43:33] children maybe some adults from the town
[43:35] that had come in and so that was really
[43:38] cool um to see um it was kind of like an
[43:41] outreach as well of a dedic as well as a
[43:43] dedication.
[43:45] Um and this is this is the church there.
[43:49] Um, so they have a on the right side,
[43:51] the doors to the left. I'm sitting on
[43:53] the right side of the of the church. Um,
[43:55] dirt floors and that was the dedication
[43:59] service there. Um, it was really cold,
[44:02] so you know, everybody's in blankets and
[44:04] and stuff, but really really nice
[44:07] brother there. He was kind of battling
[44:10] with his position as pastor and um, so
[44:13] he was able to ask dad some questions,
[44:15] too. and and it you could tell it really
[44:17] encouraged him because you know from my
[44:20] point of view it looked like he wanted
[44:21] to give up or you know if anybody came
[44:23] along he would be ready to give it up
[44:25] which is not a bad place to be but it
[44:28] was just again nice to see the
[44:29] encouragement that maybe you don't get
[44:31] in a normal service um from dad and then
[44:35] there's a video of the church here as
[44:37] well
[44:41] Oh,
[44:44] may
[44:52] you.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Um, so that's I love him. Um and three u
[45:07] there was lots of um people that came up
[45:10] for prayer at the end of that service um
[45:12] and a lot of lot of rededication
[45:15] um of people's lives. So it was cool. We
[45:17] dedicated the temple and then also um
[45:19] the next day uh had the privilege to
[45:22] baptize three people um and that's a
[45:25] husband and wife on the left side. Um
[45:27] both got baptized or rebaptized, I'm not
[45:30] sure. Um, so that was really neat and
[45:33] it's really low quality because it was
[45:35] taken with dad's Samsung, but I'm just
[45:38] kidding. Um, so this was it. This was
[45:40] actually it was a waterfall that had
[45:42] come down kind of into a little pool
[45:44] there. Um, and we had to uh dam up the
[45:48] little creek and we got it um as deep as
[45:51] we could. It's probably 12 in there. So
[45:53] we were to baptize three people there
[45:55] which was really neat. Um, and then this
[45:59] that's the Agapo tablet on the right.
[46:01] 219
[46:03] um audios. We were able to do that,
[46:04] brother. And the the cool thing about
[46:06] the tablets, if you have them down
[46:08] there, you can um you can I don't know
[46:11] how to word this. You can share your
[46:12] update with people and you don't need
[46:14] Wi-Fi. So maybe this brother could go
[46:16] back to his town and if there's one or
[46:18] two there, you know, we just were able
[46:20] to help out more people. So that that
[46:22] was a cool part and um thank you Elon
[46:25] Musk for that.
[46:26] Um so then we went to from um so that
[46:31] was Laguno de S Pablo. This is brother
[46:34] Marco. This is the one brother Jim would
[46:36] call number eight. Um he's on the left
[46:38] with his son Stephen Matthew.
[46:42] And uh and that's his church on the
[46:44] right. That's brother Isaac Hatfield. He
[46:46] joined um there at the end. And then
[46:48] that's the interpreter, brother Carlos.
[46:51] Um had a service. So in this is in
[46:52] Aikitos now. and brother um there's two
[46:55] churches in Aikitos where there was just
[46:57] one forever um I believe right just one
[47:01] yeah and so this is brother David he was
[47:03] an hour up the Amazon um but he moved
[47:07] because of work and part of his
[47:08] congregation moved is that correct not
[47:11] not this is here um and I'll hit I'll
[47:13] hit play so this is brother David's
[47:15] church and we went there um to brother
[47:17] Marco Sunday morning and then to brother
[47:19] David's in the evening
[47:35] are.
[47:52] And then um brother Isaac um preached
[47:55] there in the evening and that was in
[47:58] Aikitos. That's the town you can fly
[47:59] into. And then from there um we took um
[48:04] the boat on the right, the white one. We
[48:06] took that uh hour maybe hour and a half
[48:09] up the Amazon. And then uh we hopped in
[48:12] that canoe that you see on the right and
[48:14] the left um with you know 12 of us in a
[48:18] five-seater. So that was that was fun.
[48:21] Um, and then this is where we were
[48:23] going. It's Timikuru. Um, and this is
[48:27] where brother Muerto is. And there's
[48:30] maybe about eight believers. Um, but
[48:33] lots of people from the surrounding
[48:34] areas um came in. And we um so on the
[48:39] right there in the center by the dead
[48:40] tree, that's the church. And then the
[48:42] houses on the left and on the right um
[48:44] for people that live there. This is the
[48:47] church. Um, and we put like 45 people in
[48:50] that church. As you can see, it's on
[48:53] stilts, so I was worried about the the
[48:55] load, but we made it through. Um, and
[48:59] then this is brother Isaac spoke there.
[49:06] Just some of the brothers in Timuru. On
[49:08] the third one from the left, that's
[49:11] brother Victor. He used to be with
[49:12] brother number eight in um Iikitos, but
[49:16] he moved there um to do some farming
[49:18] work and stuff and we'll get into that
[49:20] in a little bit. That's the pastor there
[49:23] standing up, Brother Moto.
[49:25] Um and then brother Marco right beside
[49:27] him.
[49:29] Um and then this uh so that's brother
[49:32] Victor um in the white shirt. And then
[49:36] um
[49:38] so he he used to be in Aikitos but he
[49:41] moved up to you know where we took boats
[49:43] a couple hours up the river and he moved
[49:45] and his um his uh how you call it vision
[49:51] right now he that's a cacao plant um and
[49:54] you have to work on them you grow a stem
[49:56] and then you have to graft in the
[49:58] branches and it takes three years for
[50:00] that to produce fruit um and so he and
[50:03] you get I think he said for a cacao,
[50:07] you know, whatever it is, fruit, you get
[50:10] about 30 soles, which is about $9. Um,
[50:13] and they'll produce fruit every 3 months
[50:15] after the three-year period is done. Um
[50:17] and what he wants to do is um he wants
[50:20] to take you know whatever proceeds from
[50:22] that that he doesn't live on and he
[50:25] wants to take it and invest in sound
[50:26] equipment uh radio equipment and he
[50:29] wants to broadcast the message in that
[50:30] area. Um, which is is really cool
[50:33] because, you know, it takes us two,
[50:34] three hours by canoe to get to this
[50:36] place when you could just, you know, put
[50:38] a message on or put a visiting minister
[50:40] on or, you know, whatever the the thing
[50:42] would be and just keep it running 24/7
[50:44] and you can reach, you know, a lot of
[50:46] people in a radius there. So, um,
[50:48] that'll that'll be really good if when
[50:50] that works out. I think he's nine months
[50:53] into the three-year process, so it'll
[50:54] it'll be a little bit. Um, and then
[50:58] this, uh, I thought was pretty crazy. So
[51:01] you can see it's a storm in the
[51:03] background there. And we were that's
[51:05] coming into right about where the town
[51:07] is. Um and I'll show you this picture in
[51:09] a second. Um a lot of the brothers that
[51:12] I said, you know, coming into this place
[51:13] where we were because, you know, we
[51:15] couldn't go to every town. We didn't
[51:16] have time. So a lot of those brothers
[51:18] from the surrounding town came in. There
[51:20] was about 40 30 or 40 from MSAN um which
[51:25] is a straight across the Amazon. and
[51:27] they came and you know for days I'm
[51:29] looking at the weather where we're going
[51:31] to be and it every weather app I saw of
[51:33] course weather apps aren't perfect but
[51:36] it's normally in that area it's pretty
[51:38] much like clockwork 2 3:00 in the
[51:40] afternoon it'll rain hard for an hour
[51:41] you know and then maybe chill out kind
[51:43] of like a monsoon and so I was looking
[51:46] and that's the storm that radar was
[51:48] picking up and it was supposed to go
[51:49] straight through man through this place
[51:51] called Indiana and then to Tim Timmy
[51:53] Cudter where we were well these brothers
[51:56] Um
[51:59] that's how the brothers from MSAN came
[52:02] and they have to cross the Amazon. So
[52:04] think like Lake Pal in the channel. They
[52:07] have to cross not this isn't where we
[52:08] were. This is a side channel of the
[52:10] Amazon but they have to cross the Amazon
[52:12] which is like Lake Pal and the channel
[52:14] and there's 30 of them in there with
[52:16] sound equipment and you can see that's
[52:18] six inches between them and the water.
[52:20] And so the storm started coming in um
[52:23] and all those brothers got to praying
[52:24] and we witnessed it because we were 30
[52:26] miles or no maybe three miles north,
[52:28] sorry, in that canoe um at a uh kind of
[52:32] a traveling hospital they have. Um there
[52:34] was a lot of British people on board. So
[52:36] we took the pastor's wife there. She was
[52:38] having some head problems. So we took
[52:40] her up to that and um those brothers
[52:42] from Massan who were coming over started
[52:45] praying you know against the storm and
[52:48] and and praying and it it stayed
[52:49] completely south of them like we barely
[52:52] got rained on at all. And so it was just
[52:55] to me that's a huge miracle because you
[52:58] know you could have had all that sound
[52:59] equipment all those brothers in the
[53:00] middle of the Amazon and it just you
[53:02] know it wouldn't have been great. So, um
[53:05] I thought that was really cool. And this
[53:07] is um you know, just loading up the
[53:10] sound equipment they brought because
[53:12] where we were they did they don't have
[53:13] it. You don't need it. There's only
[53:14] eight of them in the church. Um and so
[53:16] you don't need it, but they brought it
[53:18] from a son speaker and piano and and 30
[53:21] people. Um
[53:24] those were um most of the believers that
[53:27] came. Some of them were already in the
[53:28] boat um from Msan area and different
[53:32] places.
[53:33] Um, and then again, here's that boat.
[53:35] And you can watch just, you know, in
[53:38] their normal movie, you can see how that
[53:40] sways and gets super I mean, within
[53:42] inches of the water.
[53:45] So, you can imagine how a storm like
[53:46] that already battling the Amazon would
[53:49] just not would not be great. Um,
[53:53] so then here, this was um as we were
[53:57] leaving, you'll recognize it. It's till
[53:59] we meet.
[54:29] already
[54:44] Amen. So that's um that's all I had
[54:47] there. Um, again, just want to thank the
[54:50] church for the opportunity to go and um,
[54:54] I don't even want to say be a blessing
[54:56] because you leave and um, yeah, you get
[55:00] a lot more blessing than you think you
[55:02] bring. Um, but just if we went there
[55:04] just to encourage that pastor or help
[55:07] that brother get more messages on his
[55:09] iPad or um, oh, I did want to mention
[55:12] um, here in Whoops.
[55:16] Can we pull up the slideshow again?
[55:18] Slide number eight. Um yeah. So the um
[55:21] the church here um that you know they
[55:24] had built built the church and we were
[55:26] um there for the dedication and one of
[55:29] the days we were there I didn't put the
[55:30] video in here but it was raining so hard
[55:33] um and the church was just full of
[55:35] water. you know, their karaoke machine,
[55:37] which they use for their sound system,
[55:39] was, you know, just inches away from the
[55:41] water and they have to raise it up and
[55:43] um it was just it was really sad. So,
[55:45] the church here, it was about $300.
[55:47] Hopefully, this is okay. Um the church
[55:50] paid for them to get a concrete floor.
[55:52] So, um and this is the church that
[55:54] kneels when they pray and so it'll just
[55:56] help. It won't um you know, there won't
[55:58] be mud in there and it'll just be a lot
[56:00] better for them. So, you know, if it was
[56:03] just if we went just to get them a
[56:04] concrete floor or any one of these
[56:07] things that I mentioned, just just
[56:09] visiting them after eight years of not
[56:10] having a visitor, um it was all worth it
[56:13] in my opinion. So, Grandma, you have a
[56:16] question.
[56:21] There are piranha in the Amazon. Yeah.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Piranha, she asked, "If they
[56:27] fall, could it be deadly if they fell
[56:29] into the Amazon?" referencing the the
[56:31] boat, you know, in the storm. Yeah, it
[56:33] it Yeah, there's piranha, there's
[56:35] alligators, there's Yeah. Not there's a
[56:39] lot of things in there that you don't
[56:40] want to be in there with. So, does
[56:42] anybody else have a question?
[56:47] Well,
[56:50] &gt;&gt; yeah. Um, she asked where we did the
[56:52] baptism. I'm going to click on pictures
[56:54] if they're relevant. So, slide 11. Um,
[56:58] so yeah, were we baptized? Um, she asked
[57:01] if we had to say that again.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we had to dam up the water. Yeah.
[57:06] So it was maybe six 4 in maybe in some
[57:11] spots um where we came. We were able to
[57:12] get it 12 to 18 in deep. Um
[57:16] yeah, log, sticks, mud, you know,
[57:19] whatever you can find just to try to get
[57:21] the water to raise a little bit. So
[57:25] here
[57:30] Yeah. 9 o'clock at night.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, she asked um you know
[57:38] the service, did it start at 9:00 p.m.?
[57:41] Yeah, it did. Um in this church here, um
[57:44] and yeah, so a lot of the people uh one
[57:46] sister, she rode a horse. I think it was
[57:49] 5 hours. Um and she was probably in her
[57:51] 70s, 80s. Um rode a horse and then a lot
[57:54] of people walked and that's why the
[57:55] service was so delayed. Um and so you
[57:59] asked secondly, sorry.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Um yeah, no, the service ended Yeah,
[58:06] maybe at 11 or something. Um brother
[58:08] Steve didn't preach too long, so
[58:11] um but yeah, service ended at 11 and
[58:13] then I think those brothers who some of
[58:14] them stayed, some of them were the
[58:16] people who got baptized. Um but um a lot
[58:20] of them just I think they slept in the
[58:22] church and then left early mornings. You
[58:24] know, some of them had seven, eight hour
[58:26] walk back home.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So a watch night at 10:30 is not a
[58:31] big deal.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Hey Lizzie.
[58:37] Um no, I don't think any church I've
[58:40] been to in Peru has he or AC. I don't
[58:43] think maybe some of the churches in
[58:44] Lima. Um but yeah, so you're pretty and
[58:48] a lot of these like maybe the Lima or
[58:50] Arakipa, some of the more developed
[58:53] areas um might have some of those
[58:56] conditions, but um like this place
[58:58] probably and they were saying how it's
[59:00] been one of the rainiest like it
[59:02] shouldn't be this rainy that time of
[59:03] year. Um but climate change or whatever
[59:07] you want to call it or not so climate
[59:09] change what um the they've had a lot of
[59:13] weather changes and so um but back to
[59:15] that so these places the temperature
[59:17] doesn't fluctuate too much through the
[59:18] year like you might get super humid but
[59:21] you might get down to maybe 40 at night
[59:24] and then you know 80 or 90 in the
[59:26] summer. So, it's not a huge drastic
[59:27] change and it's usually manageable with
[59:30] clothing, but yeah, you're kind of at
[59:31] the mercy of the
[59:34] your surround your climate there.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Kurt
[1:00:06] Yeah.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Probably not as bad. Our mud
[1:00:11] brother Kurt asked for those online. Uh
[1:00:13] he was just referencing an earlier trip
[1:00:15] where um Uncle Joe and Brother Jerry and
[1:00:18] people had to w run across a mudslide.
[1:00:21] Um, so it wasn't that severe this time
[1:00:23] or it wasn't as fresh maybe. Um, you
[1:00:25] know, you could still see it trickling
[1:00:27] and it was still moving. Um, I didn't
[1:00:29] put this picture in there, but one of
[1:00:30] them there was a a recent mudslide and
[1:00:33] paths had already been kind of forged,
[1:00:35] but you know, there was a sinkhole that
[1:00:37] was, you know, or a hole that had been
[1:00:39] formed and so you're just, you know, you
[1:00:41] never know. Any of those could just give
[1:00:42] at any second. So, but it wasn't wasn't
[1:00:45] that bad.
[1:00:57] Um, she asked the people that walk six
[1:00:59] hours essentially, what's their
[1:01:01] situation? Um, a lot of them, I would
[1:01:03] say, Dad can correct me if I'm wrong.
[1:01:05] Um, some of them do maybe have little
[1:01:07] groups like 10 people maybe in
[1:01:10] surrounding areas. Um, some people might
[1:01:12] just be isolated believers that have
[1:01:14] heard, you know, that we were coming and
[1:01:16] decided to make the journey. Is that
[1:01:17] accurate?
[1:01:23] Define town. So yeah.
[1:01:27] So
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Kurt,
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; um, dad was supposed to go there 18
[1:01:43] years ago. Um, but I think if I'm
[1:01:45] correct, they hadn't had just a visitor
[1:01:47] in general for eight. Is that Yeah.
[1:01:53] Uncle Joe asked when we're going back.
[1:01:55] Yeah, that's uh up to the Lord's will,
[1:01:58] of course.
[1:02:01] Anyone else? Maybe some of the younger
[1:02:03] ones who would like to go.
[1:02:09] Haley has a question. John's messing.
[1:02:11] Okay.
[1:02:14] All right. Well, I'll turn it over to to
[1:02:15] dad and that's all I had. And just once
[1:02:17] again, thank you for the opportunity.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; I wanted him to pull up the slide with
[1:02:27] questions.
[1:02:29] We'll just ask brother Isaac to answer
[1:02:31] these one by one real quick.
[1:02:34] Not really. Um, we are going to do a
[1:02:36] questions and answer service. Did I
[1:02:38] mention that this morning? 25th
[1:02:41] of January. A brother reminded me last
[1:02:44] week that I had said we'll try to do it
[1:02:45] every six months. It'll be about exactly
[1:02:49] six months on the 25th of January. So,
[1:02:52] I'll put the container back there and if
[1:02:55] you want to write in a question or email
[1:02:57] it or however, we'll do that January
[1:02:59] 25th. I thought these were pretty good.
[1:03:01] And you have a mixture of like kind of
[1:03:04] easier questions you would say. I mean,
[1:03:06] none of them are super easy, but ones
[1:03:08] that like, okay, explain difference
[1:03:09] between spirit and soul. And that's a
[1:03:12] very that's a question that takes
[1:03:14] development. You just can't answer it
[1:03:16] right away.
[1:03:17] Um, the one about a joke or nicknames in
[1:03:21] Spanish
[1:03:25] in Spanish it's in and this just to give
[1:03:28] you a cultural understanding if somebody
[1:03:30] is fat and he's a guy they just nickname
[1:03:33] him Elgoro or El Gordito and that's like
[1:03:36] saying the fat guy and it's not as
[1:03:38] offensive as it would be in English.
[1:03:40] they they just do it. Heyo, you know,
[1:03:42] but you could understand or if you're
[1:03:45] skinny, they'll just call you flaco and
[1:03:48] that's the skinny guy. And so,
[1:03:52] um, but it's it might be offensive to
[1:03:54] us, you know, if I just start started
[1:03:56] call calling somebody who was
[1:03:58] overweight, if I just the fat guy, but
[1:04:01] it's not as offensive. And but the
[1:04:03] question was, well, what about nicknames
[1:04:04] and jokes? And I told him, I think how
[1:04:08] we answered this was, you know, a
[1:04:10] nickname's not bad necessarily, but if
[1:04:12] it offends the brother,
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; you better not do that. And you better
[1:04:17] be careful if you think it could offend
[1:04:19] him. So, we kind of went down that
[1:04:21] avenue with it and jokes. I got to tell
[1:04:23] the story about Brother Jim traveling
[1:04:25] with Brother Brandon for three hours and
[1:04:26] then how at the end of that he told him
[1:04:28] that the Lord, you know, has a sense of
[1:04:30] humor, but he hates smut. So we got to
[1:04:33] kind of explain some of those things. So
[1:04:35] some of the questions are cultural
[1:04:37] soccer is huge. Every town you go in,
[1:04:41] every small community is 10 houses, if
[1:04:44] it's, you know, 10 houses and in the
[1:04:46] middle a big soccer field. And so those
[1:04:49] are questions you got to really manage
[1:04:51] and maneuver and see what kind of
[1:04:52] discern what why why is the person
[1:04:54] asking? Do they just want to go out on
[1:04:55] Sunday and play soccer or or do they
[1:04:58] have a child who has some energy and
[1:05:01] they, you know, want them to play soccer
[1:05:03] to get it out? So, you have to it's it's
[1:05:05] a really some of those are tougher and
[1:05:06] you have to know the culture. Um, high
[1:05:10] heels outside of the church like does it
[1:05:12] make it okay in the church? You know, it
[1:05:13] was an interesting question. Didn't
[1:05:15] Isaac got the one. Um, of course, James
[1:05:18] was Jesus's brother, half brother.
[1:05:23] Um,
[1:05:24] yeah, I think that was Oh, the the the
[1:05:27] minister question. I think I know who
[1:05:28] wrote it and it was a young man and he's
[1:05:30] probably 10 or 12 years old and it was a
[1:05:32] good it was a good question, you know,
[1:05:34] from coming from a young man. Well, and
[1:05:37] I kind of answered it like, well, you
[1:05:39] can't do anything to become a minister.
[1:05:40] Like, God gives those gifts. However,
[1:05:43] you don't know if you might have a gift,
[1:05:45] so keep your life pure. And we talked to
[1:05:46] him about some of those things. But it
[1:05:48] was a good it was a good question, a
[1:05:49] fair question. So, um, all right.
[1:05:52] Anything else on that? Then we'll have
[1:05:54] Brother Rolando. I thought it'd be
[1:05:55] appropriate, Brother Rolando come and
[1:05:58] have Brother Rolando sing a Spanish song
[1:05:59] to us and then we'll close. Sister
[1:06:02] Danette.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I always translate that
[1:06:09] like bad jokes or um, perverse jokes I
[1:06:12] think is the word. Yeah, smut's not a
[1:06:14] easy Yeah, perverse jokes I think is the
[1:06:18] word.
[1:06:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:02] You want to give thanks to the Lord
[1:07:03] tonight.
[1:07:09] He
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; he had left here Flagstaff,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; but the Lord brought him back.
[1:07:15] He doesn't like the climate here.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; He's from like a more temperate climate
[1:07:24] in Humb
[1:07:29] and he gave thanks to the Lord this
[1:07:31] morning. The service
[1:07:34] the presence of the Lord was different
[1:07:35] this morning.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "I come from a Pentecostal."
[1:07:41] and looking at the bride of Christ,
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; he say I feel bad sometimes
[1:07:47] sometimes a little baptist,
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; but each church has
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; but I I saw this morning the church in
[1:07:59] I saw that young people very happy.
[1:08:02] God was here with us this morning in
[1:08:05] everything
[1:08:08] for the glory of the Lord.
[1:08:18] Some kind
[1:08:24] of
[1:08:33] glora.
[1:08:49] No,
[1:09:05] Messiah.
[1:09:08] for
[1:09:35] Fore!
[1:09:44] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:10:06] You're
[1:10:20] Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother.
[1:10:24] He's been talking to me about that a
[1:10:26] little bit. But Steve,
[1:10:28] he comes from a Pentecostal church. He
[1:10:30] says that we those Pentecostals outshine
[1:10:33] us in their worship, you know. So, he
[1:10:36] must have appreciated this morning. I
[1:10:37] kind of wished I was out here this
[1:10:39] morning. I was in the back, but Lord
[1:10:41] knows. Let's all stand and we'll
[1:10:44] sing a song and pray. Thank the Lord for
[1:10:46] a wonderful day he's given us. Amen.
[1:10:49] Whatever you have, sister.
[1:10:52] I'd like to sing La Fiesta deores, but I
[1:10:55] don't think you know it. It's the feast
[1:10:56] of the overcomers, by the way. So, it's
[1:10:59] a good song.
[1:11:01] Sure. Yeah.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:23] Amen.
[1:11:35] Heat. Heat.
[1:12:05] See the little baby.
[1:12:08] Oh, he's lying in the manger
[1:12:12] on Christmas morning.
[1:12:18] Amen.
[1:12:19] I see him at the seaside.
[1:12:23] He's reaching the
[1:12:40] will serve him.
[1:12:43] Yes, we believe in your name.
[1:12:48] Amen.
[1:12:50] Amen.
[1:12:53] Amen. God bless. You sure been good to
[1:12:56] be in church with each one of you
[1:12:57] tonight. There are more verses to that.
[1:13:00] I'm just too old to remember them all.
[1:13:01] I'd love to sing them with you, but love
[1:13:04] seeing it. Takes me back those
[1:13:06] missionary trips. love to go there again
[1:13:08] sometime or maybe send some of the
[1:13:10] kiddos. So, let's pray. Dear God, we're
[1:13:13] so thankful to be in church tonight with
[1:13:15] each one. Just a little humble sacrifice
[1:13:18] of praise. God, you're so worthy. We
[1:13:20] don't have the words and all the words
[1:13:22] that you'd give us. Lord, if we could
[1:13:25] take a little pen and you'd fill the
[1:13:27] ocean with ink and write on the
[1:13:30] parchment of heaven, Lord, it couldn't
[1:13:32] contain the hole. the the songwriter
[1:13:35] wrote and and we're just
[1:13:39] think those things tonight, Lord, with
[1:13:41] these testimonies and we feel for these
[1:13:43] people. They love you, Lord, just like
[1:13:45] we do. And it it takes us up a little
[1:13:47] higher to see the sacrifice. And Lord,
[1:13:50] we want to put our shoulder to the well
[1:13:51] any way we can to help one another, of
[1:13:54] course, and all also these however we
[1:13:57] can and and just love and serve you. We
[1:14:01] thank you for this Christmas time. We
[1:14:02] know you weren't born this time of year,
[1:14:05] but how we celebrate and just Brother
[1:14:07] Random called it a worship. Make sure
[1:14:09] we're worshiping, Lord. Not we would
[1:14:11] celebrate like a birthday, but a worship
[1:14:14] because of the great thing that you've
[1:14:16] done, Lord, and coming down and a humble
[1:14:19] way, Lord, that an example that we need
[1:14:21] to be humble and then to go, Lord, the
[1:14:24] great things you accomplished yet to die
[1:14:26] on a cross, Lord, to cover our sins.
[1:14:28] We're so thankful for that tonight.
[1:14:31] And we just claim every promise, Lord.
[1:14:34] We want to apply that token for our
[1:14:36] children, for our loved ones, for those
[1:14:38] uh missing among us, Lord. Those that
[1:14:40] are sick, uh these great gallant
[1:14:43] soldiers, Lord, we love so much. The
[1:14:45] Weather's family,
[1:14:47] brother, the Wilson family, Lord, and
[1:14:50] and the different ones, the Ignises, and
[1:14:54] just love and appreciate each one and
[1:14:56] pray that you'd take us home, Lord, to
[1:14:59] bring us back at the right time. All
[1:15:02] things that we say and do, we all for
[1:15:03] the glory of God. In the precious and
[1:15:05] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:15:07] all God's people say, "Amen."
[1:15:15] Turn on the blue one here.
[1:15:18] Um, how about you ask Well, as you're
[1:15:20] dismiss,
[1:15:22] my sins are gone.
[1:15:25] Lord bless you. Lord willing, we'll see
[1:15:27] you Wednesday, 10:30 p.m. Get rest
[1:15:30] beforehand. We'll take communion right
[1:15:32] at midnight. Lord willing.
[1:15:38] You ask me why I'm happy, so I'll just
[1:15:42] tell you why. Because
[1:15:46] my sins are gone.
[1:15:50] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[1:15:54] where they are, I say,
[1:15:58] "My sins are gone."
[1:16:01] Well, they're underneath the blood. On
[1:16:05] the cross of Calvary,
[1:16:07] as far removed as darkness is from dawn,
[1:16:12] there in the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[1:16:16] that's good enough for me. Praise God,
[1:16:21] my sins are gone.
[1:16:25] That's at the old time altar where God
[1:16:28] came in my heart. And now,
[1:16:33] oh, my sins are gone.
[1:16:36] The Lord took full possession. The devil
[1:16:40] did depart. I'm glad
[1:16:44] my sins are gone.
[1:16:47] There underneath the blood on the cross
[1:16:52] of Calvary
[1:16:54] has far removed as darkness is from dawn
[1:16:59] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[1:17:02] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[1:17:07] My sins are gone.
[1:17:11] Satan comes to tempt me. He tries to
[1:17:15] make me down. I say
[1:17:19] my sins are gone.
[1:17:22] You brought me into trouble, but Jesus
[1:17:26] got me out. I'm glad
[1:17:30] my sins are gone.
[1:17:33] They're underneath the blood on the
[1:17:37] cross of Calvary.
