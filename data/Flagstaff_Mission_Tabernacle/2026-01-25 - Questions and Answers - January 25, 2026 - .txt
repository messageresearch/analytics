[music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Good morning. Let's stand. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; I am [music] for you and [singing] some [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] You're a kind of sing. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; No s [music] [music] for Heat. [music] [singing] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. [music] [music] Oh sh [singing] [music] [music] [music] and Lord bless you this morning. uh welcome you to the house of the Lord this Sunday morning. Pleasure to be here with you all. I see a young lady in the back there. Good to have you with us. They wrote your name down, but I I didn't want to venture. Do you want to tell us? I didn't want to venture at pronouncing it. Okay. Praise the Lord. Nice to have you with us. Um, we announced a week or so ago that we were going to have a a vote on whether to [music] send the funds that we currently have to Zimbabwe for this use of a vehicle that sister Louisa and her brother Jonathan would be using to conduct a medical missionary work that they do there. So, we're going to do that at this time. Um, we had also put the Zoom recording of the trip report we did with them in December and they talked about uh what they what the need was. And so hopefully you're educated to to we're going to do the vote at this time. I'll have brother Tom and brother Chase help us out. If it's okay and not to be different or anything, we might just have us bow our heads and I'll have brother Chase and brother Tom. We'll just do a hand vote at this time. I have brother Chase and brother Tom count the votes on either side of the congregation. So if you would bow your heads at this time and if you're if you would be in favor of the sending these funds and for the use might be for a vehicle that's what we intend but there might be another use that would come up. So, if you would be in favor of sending those funds, would you raise your hand? Just one hand. Raise your hand at this time. And I'll have just hold them up there just for about 10 or 15 seconds while the brothers would count them. Okay, you may put those down. And if you would not be in favor, if you don't think it's a appropriate use of our missions funds, would you raise your hand at this [music] time with your heads being bowed? Okay, that's you may raise your put your hands down and [music] raise your heads and your hearts, brothers. Um I think we can say conclusively that um the body has determined that that would be a good use of the funds and so we'll be sending those to Zimbabwe and Lord willing they'll purchase a vehicle but you know if they want to we we'll just guide with the trustees along that and I think it's from my perspective I'm glad the congregation would vote the way they did from my perspective it's one of the greatest mission works that I've seen done in this foot doctor goes and you know treats the children's feet and they buy him shoes and so it's an amazing work. Um maybe we'll just sing that song again. Brother Ryan, let's start with verse two there and Sister Pauline, we'll sing that as we enter back into the spirit. I felt the Lord was pleased with that song. Start with verse two. I'm looking now across the river. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] [music] Heat. Heat. [music and singing] [music] Hey, [music] [music] [music] [music] I [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; for you. And someday [singing] [music] [singing] I'll [music] say there [singing and music] I'll [music and singing] meet her [music] [music] sweet. &gt;&gt; Amen. For prayer requests this morning, Sister Rose wrote in [music] for Mark Baila, her brother. He's going to get a surgery redone on Thursday. It's complex [music] and it needs to be redone. And we pray that all would go well with Sister Rose's [music] brother Mark and also her 9-year-old niece Giovana in Mexico is getting a major mouth repair surgery. She was born with a deformity in her mouth. It's also complicated and very painful. We pray that she gets through with this [music] min with min minimal pain. She asked that we [music] would pray for her. How about that? a little nine-year-old girl would have enough faith to ask that we would pray for her. So, let's go before the Lord in prayer this morning as we bow our heads. And with your head bowed, you may also lift a hand if you have a need. I'm not even looking, but we know the Lord looks and knows who has [music] needs and what that need is this morning. Heavenly Father, we approach you this morning, Lord. And in our hearts there's needs with the lifted hand we confess and make known those needs, Lord. And we come before you this morning. We approach you this morning, not even knowing the correct way to approach you or how to do it exactly. So we just come humbly asking for your help, Lord. And we read these requests for Sister Rose, her brother, and her niece, Lord. And it thrilled my heart to read that the niece would ask for prayer. And that's a measure of faith right there, Lord. And it's a something we all should have with a childlike faith, Lord. She must have asked because she thought and believed that it works, Lord, that you answer prayer. And we believe that this morning, Lord, that you're a God who answers prayer. And we know there's [music] many needs in our body. No doubt many hands were lifted up. We present these needs before you, Lord. And I ask for myself for this morning, Lord, as we have a service of questions and answers, Lord. There is no question that we can answer appropriately and sufficiently, Lord. And so, we're relying on you this morning to completely just reveal yourself more to us this morning, Lord. not just answer our questions, but would you just unfold yourself, Father, just once more and reveal yourself to us and explain who you are to us once again, Lord. And let us feel your presence as the word and the songs, Lord. We go forth. May we feel that you're with us and present among us once again, Lord. For every request that's made known, we'd ask that you'd meet the need, Father, according to the faith, Lord. And may our faith raise high [music] this morning and be elevated to a level, Lord. That as the song would say, one day our faith is going to end. It's going to be fulfilled. It's going to be finished in sight and in not just a sight, Lord, but we're going to experience an experience like we've never felt before. We believe that, Lord. And that's our faith. We're holding on to that this morning. Would you bring us once again into heavenly places this morning in Christ Jesus? we pray be [music] with us for we ask all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Lord bless you. Brother Donald, greet [music] the one next to you. You may be seated. Brother Ryan, I love the way that the Holy Spirit led you. Every need supplied. Amen. Will is this a request? [music] Okay. [music] Every [singing] [music] knee Heat. [music] Heat. [singing] [music] [music] Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] Heat. Heat. [music and singing] [singing and music] Oh, so [music] [music] there [singing] We need inside. [music] Amen. Amen. Lord bless y'all. Brother Ryan, um the song Lord, you know I need a brand new touch. Lord, you know I need a brand new touch. All right, then that's all right. Doesn't stop the fact. &gt;&gt; Lord, you know &gt;&gt; I need a brand new touch. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Jehovah Gyra, my provider. Amen. Amen. You know, I was telling brother Steve there's how the Lord works on me may be different than you and I know that it is, but he's he just brings me very close and brings me little reminders. I sat and listened to um Sister Marcy and Sister Kathy singing and that song [music] was special to them. It may not be to other people, but because they could, it was it was who they were. It was how God spoke to them at a moment in time. And and and it means something special to them. And Jehovah, my provider. I heard the prophet say, and and [music] so I'm using his words because I want them to be my words also. He said, "I would give my very life for anyone that loved my Lord Jesus." So this entering in of one another, if you see the person next to you, you said know without a shout of doubt that they love the same Lord Jesus you do, then you're willing to give your life for him. Jehovah Gyra. And most of the time I can't. I may not physically but but I want you to know it. So I enter into songs and I want you to know that I would do anything I can. Sister Rose, this little girl. She her Lord is my Lord. I would give my life for her. I can't give my life, but I will enter into prayer. I will bring it before brother Gerald, sister Alberta, just because we haven't heard about it in a while. She loves the Lord Jesus. So I want to give my life to her. I want to just bring my spirit. So per chance the Lord would be pleased. Per chance you would bring about a healing. And that's very true. So amen. I want to be mindful of his presence. Jehovah Mjara my provider. Amen. Jehovah. [music] My pro. [singing] You are [music] enough for [music] me. [music] You're the [singing] rock. [music] You're mighty. By your stripes we have been save. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat.

And that's the beautiful thing that you know I you look out and I sitting at dinner. Brother John and sister Liz so graciously invited us to dinner and the other night and I sitting out and talking to him and we were talking. I said, "You don't know how a a privilege it is and to [music] be able to stand out here and see each one of your faces. All you get to do is see my face." Sometimes I'm sad for that, Suzanne, because there's more. Because if as I look out here, it just turns my heart. I don't know any way to else express it. And I wish I could tell you back because [music] I see Christ alive in each one. Big, little, all different ages. And it's all because of this. Born again, filled with the Holy Ghost. [music] There's really been a change in me. Amen. Born again just like I'm Jesus. I'm sorry, brother Ryan. I did it wrong. Oh, born again. There's really [music and singing] been a change in me. Oh, born [music] again just like Jesus. Heat. [music and singing] Heat. [music] [bell] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] Morning heat. [music and singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; again. [singing] I'm glad so [music] glad that I've been [singing] born again. I know that there's verses to that song and we don't have them. We don't have them on our little thing, but Sister Pauline, in your spare time, and I say that with great respect because you put so much time into it. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. Amen. And our brothers will come. We'll sing this little chorus. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord. How many received his mercy this week? Amen. What a beautiful thing. So, we should be able to just let him know and he should be so pleased. And he says, "That's my children. That's that's the ones that I love doing things for. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever." Amen. Oh, I will sing [music] of the mercies of the Lord [singing] forever. Oh, I will sing. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music and singing] [music] Oh, [music and singing] heat, [music] heat. [music] [singing] Heat. [music] Heat. [music and singing] Heat. [music] Heat. [singing] Yeah. [music] Heat.

Brother Glenn, would you offer prayer? Dear Lord, we come before you, Lord, thanking you for all your mercies, &gt;&gt; all your grace you show us, Lord. &gt;&gt; How you've blessed us in so many ways. Pray now that you'd receive these tithes, these offerings. May they be just a small representation in some way of the uh abundance you've given us and our gratitude. use these things for your benefit, your glory &gt;&gt; as we pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was uh brother Ryan, whatever is on your heart. There are 17 Christian or I'm sorry, there were seven Christians, seven Christians, six Bibles, and an offering of $2 in our Sunday school class this morning. Also want to make mention I forgot my little pamphlet in the back there but um Thursday evening is uh Lord willing Bible study and deter uh place will be determined but [music] it has to do with revelation. So want to make mention of that and uh coming up. Amen. Amen. Amen. And it's keeping me alive. Keeping me alive. [music] Yeah. Heat. [music] Oh, [music] [music] [singing] [music] [music and singing] heat, heat. Yeah. [music and singing] Heat. [music] [music and singing] Oh, [music] [music] [music] heat, heat. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; that was in the bulletin. Who has that bulletin? And what was it? It was a question. Just the very same question. Brother Benham said if we would ask ourselves is why are we here? What is our purpose for it? And what are we doing about it? He's keeping us alive to tell of his righteousness. Oh, it's all over me and it's keeping me alive. [music] It's keeping me [singing] alive. It's keeping me alive. Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] Jesus [singing] is keeping me alive. Oh, some glad morning when [music] I [music] get you. [music] [music] Yeah. Heat.

Yes, Lord. Yes. Amen. Amen. Amen. My heart's just bubbling. You know, the prophet says, and brother Ryan, what else is just the Holy Spirit leading you on the song? He says, you know, sometimes you get just enough religion to get happy with the songs and run around a little bit and then sit down and talk about your neighbor. I've got more than that. I've got a happiness on the inside of you myself that I wish I could express. I'm not going to be able to express in this flesh. But one of these days when we're all in heaven, brother Donald, you and I are going to be dancing around. I believe that. I don't These feet can't move here and I won't care what they move like over there. I'll just be happy that I'm here. What have you got, Brother Ryan? Amen. Just before we have our specials. Amen. [music] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] [music] Yeah. Heat. [music] [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music and singing] Yeah. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] [music] Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. We have a few songs. I just apologize for the weakness. My flesh, it gets in the way so much. And really what I like to be doing is just running up and down here. When I think of my Lord and Savior, I just But I just think, "Oh, &gt;&gt; there's a stupid camera that's watching every move that I make." And I would might get embarrassed on this thing, God. One of these days, I'm going to just I'm going to just I'm just telling you. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh my. Brother Will, would you have your special &gt;&gt; know my savior? If you don't know him, don't take another minute &gt;&gt; without just staying and saying, "Lord, &gt;&gt; would you just make yourself known to me?" That's all you take that first. He He paid for it all. That's not a question. He just wants you to come out and accept it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Love the Lord Jesus. Amen. Glory to his name. You gave me my hands to reach out to man to show him your love and your perfect plan. You gave [singing] me my ears. I can hear your voice so clear. I can hear the cries of sinners. But can I wipe away their tears. You gave me my voice [music] to speak out your word. to sing all your praises to those who never heard. But with my eyes, I see a need for more availability. I see hearts that have been broken, so many people to be free. Lord, I'm available to you. My will I give to you. I'll do what you say to use me, Lord, to show someone the way. Enable [singing and music] me to say my storage is empty and I am available to you. Now I'm giving [music] back to you all the tools you gave to me. my hands, my ears, my voice, my eyes, so you can use them as you please. I have emptied out my cup so that you can fill me up and now I'm free. I just want to be more available to you, Lord. I'm available to you. My will I give to you. I'll do what you [music] say [singing] to use me, Lord, to show someone the way and enable me to say. [singing] My storage is empty and I am available [music and singing] to you, Lord. I'm available to you. My will I give [music and singing] to you. I'll do what you say to use me, Lord, to show someone the way and [music] enable me to say my storage is empty [singing and music] and I am available. Use me Lord [singing] to show someone the way and [music] enable me to say my storage is empty and I am available [singing] to you. My sore edge is empty and I [singing] am available. That's why I surrender all. [singing] Oh, I surrender all. All to thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender. Oh, Amen. Amen. [applause] Wonderful. Truly, I surrender. Oh, brother Tom, if you'd make ready at this time. I apologize. As I was checked, I shouldn't have said stupid. That was the wrong thing to say. I'm sorry. If that isn't Pentecostal cussing, I don't know what it is. Besides that, my grandchildren would tell me, "Peppa, you're not supposed to say that word." So, I'm sorry, but it just these little things just told me down. That's what it I just use different terms. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you. If I may, if you were here Wednesday, you never want to give the enemy a chance to get his foot in the door. Brother William very nicely asked Brother Tom to get ready for a song. Asked if I had a song. Brother Tom did not hear him. I didn't ignore Brother Will. I just didn't hear it. And I felt terrible. I mean, for a singer, you look for those chances, Brother Kurt. You know, you look to get called into the game and then to miss hearing the coach's call is terrible. And I was thinking, Brother William, with your song there, so [music] that was a song from a young man's heart. And we could all sing that. But if I could say this is a not an old man, but a elder man's answer. If you have not [music] great talents or gifts to bring, if you have not been blessed with a voice to sing, still you [music] long to serve Jesus your Lord [singing] and King. Do what you can where you are. Oh, do what you can where you are. There's a job to be done where you are. Do the Savior [singing and music] be true in that place given you. Do what you can where [singing] you are. From an acorn grow trees that are strong and tall. So a work [singing] that is mighty and blesses all [music] of begins with a labor unnoticed [music] and small. Do what you can where you [singing] are. Oh, do what you can where you are. There's a job to be [singing] done [music] where you are. to the Savior be true [music] in that place given you. Do what you can where you are. Oh, our labors are judged not by man's acclaim. Our rewards [music] are not based on success or fame. The criterion is [music and singing] faithfulness to his name. Do what you can where you are. Oh, [singing] do what you can where you are. There's a job to be done where you are. Do the [singing and music] Savior be true in that place given you. Do [music] what you can where you are. So then do what you can for the Lord, [singing] my friend. With the help of his blessings [music] and grace, my friend, you will hear his well done at the journey's [singing] [music] end. Do what you can where you are. Oh, do [music] what you can where you are. There's a job to be done where you are to the [singing and music] Savior be true in that place given you. Do what you can where you are. [music and singing] Oh, do what you can where you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We can stand. We changed the order of the service. Amazing grace. Brother Tom, I know you can't see this. See how the Lord, he does little things, raises my faith. That song was the first one on my list. &gt;&gt; And if you all were a percentage guy, Brother Donald could tell you percentages. the percentages of that happening without some somebody greater &gt;&gt; being in control. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So my [music] faith is right here, &gt;&gt; right about now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anything's possible. Ask &gt;&gt; it. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. How blessed is my Lord and Savior. Praise the name of the Lord Jesus [music] Christ. Amen. Amazing grace. How sweet [music] a save a [singing] [music] like me. I once was [singing] lost but now I found was [music] now I see was Grace that has taught my heart to his grace. [music and singing] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] grace [music] [music and singing] and with me. [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] [singing] [music] We know [music] to see God and we [music] first bless you this morning. [music] If you have your Bibles, we'll turn to John, the first chapter of John. Maybe start with verse 30. Thank you to the musicians. Sounds like brother Tom was supposed to sing this morning. So there's really no mistakes with God. And brother Donald did make a mistake though. He said if I take the cameras out of here, he might loosen up a little bit. That's what I heard anyway. I don't know what you all heard, but I mean, if that's all it takes, Brother Donald, I will brew those things out of here right now and we'll get a little we'll have a little wildfire in here. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then uh we'll go to Revelations 21 after we read these few verses. Verse 30 of St. John chapter 1 says, "This is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me, for he was before me, and I knew him not, but that he should be made manifest to Israel." Therefore, I might come baptizing with water. And John bear records, saying, "I saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it bowed upon him." And then Revelations chapter 21 and the first couple verses. And these I guess would pertain to the first question that we'll approach this morning. Revelations 21 verse one. So saw John saw the spirit descending. And then verse one says, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God." Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we approach you this morning with humility and with thankfulness. We appreciate you already manifesting yourself this morning, Lord, and making yourself known in your presence here with us. And even in the little mention of that song, Lord, and just like our brother said, just gives us a little boost. We know you're with us. We know you're here. And we thank you that just once in a while, Lord, you encourage us in the way. And we appreciate that. And we acknowledge that this morning. We ask you to be with us in these questions and answers that we would have this morning, Lord. And may you be the answer we're all looking for. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. You can be seated. Yeah. There's a quote I read a few weeks ago and I think brother Brandham says something like this. You know, if I just could feel him once in a while, let him know. Let let me know that he's there, that would keep me going. And I really like that quote because if the prophet of God had that thought and that desire, just I want to feel him once in a while. I kind of the same way, you know, man, Lord, thank you. I if I just could feel you once in a while. And we had a lot of questions come in, more than the last time, a lot more. And maybe 12 to 15, somewhere in that range. And some of them were linked and so we kind of combined them. And so it's going to take a few services and even don't feel bad if you don't get the answer because a lot of these well I I've had comfort this morning. They asked Jesus when when when is the Lord coming? What's the day? And he said something like this. I don't know. Only the father in heaven knows. So if Jesus could say I don't know. I have no trouble saying I don't know. You know that was a good example for us. And um and then I like what brother Isaac said last week. He said something like this. If there's an answer or say if I say something that's wrong or you think is wrong and you find it in the message different or you find it in scriptures, I'll say it like this. If you find in the Bible or the message different, I'm wrong and the Bible and the message are right. And that'll just be we could we could just get that out of the way up front. And um I was studying while the questions and answers a few years ago we did a questions and answers where there was no questions but we just went through the questions that were asked of Jesus and the questions he asked which he actually asked a lot more than were asked of him. And that's you that's kind of interesting that God on earth the manifestation of God on earth would ask more questions of us than we would ask of him. So the disciples or the scribes or whoever it was that asked him questions asked him like 180 questions and he asked 300 questions and the and the Bible records that he didn't give you know the the 180 questions that he was asked he didn't give 180 answers. Sometimes he wouldn't answer at all or he would answer with a question. They would say something like what by what authority are you doing these things? Who gives you this authority? and we throw that word around, but it's like, "But how can you do these things? What power do you have? Or what, you know, who do you come? They're they're under Roman rule or whatever." So they look at maybe authority like that and and so they ask him, "By what authority?" And he says, "Well, by what authority did John do these things?" And they go back and see, they're trying to accuse him and get him caught in a trap, but you're not going to catch God in a trap with questions. There's no way. And so sometimes he would he would answer a question with another question. And and other times he would answer it with a parable. They would ask a question like this. Who's my neighbor? &gt;&gt; Who who's my neighbor? And he would say something like, "There was a guy one time and he was going from Jerusalem down to Jericho." And then, you know, he got beat up by some robbers and then a priest came by and a Levite came by and a Samaritan came by. Then he goes through the story and in the parable he answers the question, but he doesn't just say, "Oh, the neighbor's a guy that treats the other guy better." But he's giving an entire picture of everything because he really wants to paint it well for you and put it in a way that you can understand greater. Not just, you know, a yes or no question, but he can he can really get down into your heart to figure out. See, that's the key because he wants to in the questions that were asked. The reason he didn't just just answer the questions, he went back and and asked a question or he told a parable or sometimes he did an action. Hey, we've caught this woman in adultery and you know the law says this and and he wouldn't do any say anything. He just took his finger and and he did an action. Or when the disciples were on the sea, they they asked him a question, do you even care that we perish? &gt;&gt; And so what did he do? He just calmed the storm. Well, in that action, he showed something that was greater than answering the question, yes, I care if you perish. No, he did. He accomplished the answer to the question. And in that qu, see, he wants to expose what's inside of us. So, if you ask God a question, see, brother Bham said, when you when I do the questions and answer services, I I gets to see what's in the hearts of the people. Well, God God also wants to expose. So he knows but maybe he wants you to know like what the motivation of the question is and where's the where's the where's the what's the heart of the issue that's what God and then he can expose what's in your heart and then he can show you you know if there's something missing there that that here's what you need in your heart now he did answer a couple questions very directly I think you know some theologians say three and some say eight it comes like this though that in Matthew 24 they asked him and and only you know the bride would understand this, but but in Matthew 24, they asked him what what what were they what they were basically were saying was what are the seven seals? I'm going to word it like that and if you study the seven seals, you'll you'll understand. But they basically asked him, you know, what's the sign of them? And when will these things happen? And he begins in Matthew 24 in the first few verses, he actually begins to open the seven seals. Now, we know they're sealed and it's a seven sealed book, but we couldn't have them today if Christ didn't begin an opening back then. So he he does answer that question. And then there's another question that he answers and I think it's in Luke. I don't have it here but but it's something like this. Lord, what is the greatest commandment in the law? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, he came right directly with an answer to that question. Here's what the greatest commandment is. You should love your neighbor. You should love the Lord first of all with all your body, your soul, your heart, your mind, your strength. You better love him and love your neighbor as thyself. Now think of all the questions he was asked. 80 and who do who has this authority? Should we kill stone this woman or do you even care about us or whatever it might be? So he's asked all those questions, but the one question he asked directly is the greatest commandment is love your neighbor. Love God with all your heart and love your neighbor. So there's something in that answer &gt;&gt; that's special because it's a direct answer and it's a revealing. It's actually the greatest revealing of the heart of God. &gt;&gt; God is love. I think John would say it like that. And so he he would answer with parables. He would answer with authority. He would answer with an action. And rarely, but with purpose, he would give, you know, a very plain answer. So Lord, help us this morning. There was so many that we're just going to go through. And by the way, I think I took the hardest ones right off the bat. So pray for me special this morning. And don't uh I'm not going to say answer them. We'll just say that we approach them. And the first question here, I uh I've been listening to the future home back in November and December is really going through it like detail. You know, sometimes you'll listen to it and go through in detail. And that's the message where Billy Paul comes out and his dad asks him, "What do you did you understand it? Did you understand what I said tonight?" And I mean, it's a 4-hour message, first of all. And we, you know, we've got about a 45minute attention span. Well, we did back then. I don't know what the young people have nowadays, but it was 45 minutes or so back then. And four hours, you can't even expect that he would grasp it all, but we're all a little prideful and we all want to. And yeah, I got it, Dad. You know, the there was a you know, the earth and then there's a new homecoming. I got it. He said, did you understand? No, I did. And about the third or fourth time, did you understand the the message, the future home? And in a maybe a sad way, he said, no, I didn't really get it. And then brother Brandham says something like this. I can count on my hand the number of people that understood. And so I went back and listened to that message in November trying to understand. I don't think God doesn't want us to understand. And and so God began to deal with me on certain things. And then this brother asked a question and I thought that's kind of already the answer. So we'll pull it up here and and we'll see where the Lord would lead us. The question is God's first Bible was in the heavens as constellation. I some of the questions you might have written it in and you might see it differently worded. It's because maybe there was a couple questions related to the same question and I would summarize them. So the heavens as constellations was God's first Bible. The heavenly constellations were written from Virgo to Leo showing the birth of Christ to his coming. The third Bible his written word which we have to study now and every verse teaches us about Christ. What does the second Bible built by Enoch as pyramids show us? Do we know first of all that God's first Bible, you know, brother Brandham goes back to the beginning on this and he talks about Elohim and he talks about God being there and we're going to read a quote here as we go forward, but but brother Brandham will will kind of put a drama together. You know, you can almost close your eyes and you try we can try to picture it happening. It it happens almost before time and it happens as as something we'll never really until we get there be able to fully understand how it happened. But in our, you know, the brains that we can think with now, he begins to dramatize it for us. And he said in there, now see this is just like a child playing before the door. It was the son of God, the logos. And I can see him out there. And he spake and said, "Let there be light." And there was nothing but there was something happening. And Adam turned there and began to whirl around this way. The sun begin to come into existence because he said, "Let there be." There's the authority. Where did he make it from? I don't know. There was nothing to make it from, but he believed his own word. That's one of my favorite quotes I've ever read. God believed his own word and there was light. And I can see a piece fly off of that. It's a meteor after a few million years or hundred billions of years if you want to call it. And it circled way out and I see him standing there watching it. It falls down in here and he stops it after it falls a few million years and let it hang there in orbit. Here goes another one flying off the sun. It goes over here and hangs down and stops there. What's he doing? He's see he's writing his first Bible. It's he's writing. And what is his first Bible? He's expressing himself. Actually, now we could say a Bible is God. And we do believe this that this is the revelation of Jesus Christ. And we know the quote every verse in here. You know, if you don't see the Lord in it, go back and read it again. But it's just an expression of the L. We call it a love letter. If God is love, it's an expression of who God is. And so when God begins to write in the heavens an expression of himself as as we could look up before we had a written Bible, we could see it from beginning to end the the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. Notice the human being wants to look toward the heavens and he put all the stars in the heavens, the zodiac starting off with the virgin ending up with Leo the lion. First coming of Christ, the second coming came by the virgin, came again as the lion of the tribe of Judah. There he puts the first Bible. Now, if we could put that picture up, and I just uh grabbed this off of some I found on the internet, but it's it it would look something like this, that God would begin maybe at 12:00 there with Virgo, and it shows that Christ is coming. And listen, we're not studyers of the stars. We don't worship the stars, but we certainly can notice that in the heavens, God expressed himself, and he expressed it in the form of a virgin. The virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son. And then he winds it up to nowadays that Christ is coming as a lion of the tribe of Judah. Then he says this, the second Bible was written by Enoch and put in the pyramid. The third Bible was written and the last one is this one. Do something like this. God always does things in threes. God is perfect in threes. He's perfect. Pardon me. He's perfect in father, son, holy spirit. He's perfect in justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Spirit. perfected in his threes. We're in his making. So, we're perfected in three. Soul, body, and spirit. And our bodies controlled of nerves, blood, cells, flesh. Three. All perfected in three. Brother Bam says there. Excuse me. Yes. And that great pyramid that Enoch built, the last chambers gone through, gone through, excuse me, ready for the king's chamber. Now, the coming of the Lord right in the top for the keystone. And then he says, "The great pyramid you study that points to the end time, the one that Enoch made, the zodiac, it started off with the virgin, the first coming of Christ. It's ending up with Leo the lion, the second coming. It's at hand." So he he says something about the great pyramid and Enoch made and and then he said it points to the end time. So if we could study that now, we would look and say that the pyramid even even though we don't have a full understanding, I actually took the three p the three great ones or the the three that are in Egypt nowadays. And there's some people that believe they line up to Orion's belt. But when I took it and tried to line it up, it didn't show anything. And I can't go with authority and say, "Well, the pyramids line up and they look like Orion's belt." I can't say that. But what I can say is the first Bible demonstrates Christ. The third Bible reveals Christ. And so somehow in the in the in the great making of monuments, Enoch probably didn't even know what he was doing, but he's just building something. And it demonstrates the Lord Jesus Christ through and through. And then he says this. Some say, excuse me, let me let me just read this one here before we before we keep going. Some say, "Brother Bam is the son of man. I thought the pillar of fire was the son of man and I'm mistaken." Then later down he says, "I'm not he. I'm his servant. And the pillar of fire is not he. It's in spirit form. which is upon the Son of Man and has come now to anoint sons of men to bring back a ministry just exactly like it said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together just like the pyramid as Enoch built and we find that in that pyramid they never did get the headstone on it why the headstones yet to come seven steps in the pyramid we'll go through that someday I just like to show you how it's perfected with scripture so he tells us now that even as Enoch built that that there is something missing on the top and that thing that would be missing shows that Jesus Christ is coming the capstone of the pyramid. So even there it's it's you know if the first Bible shows Christ and this Bible manifests Christ certainly that Bible must manifest Christ. In Egyptian I don't know how the archaeologists figured this out so this is not a quote but I just found this online in Egyptian theology the capstone represented completion order over chaos the point of contact between heaven and earth. And I thought man they they got a few things right now. They don't have exactly right. But but maybe they're looking back and they think the Egyptians wrote it, but they're thinking, well, what the the Egyptians are actually what Enoch wanted was there's something that's going to be completed. There's a point of contact between heaven and between earth. And he's trying to, you know, in his spirit even he must know that Christ is coming. And and he begins to build a monument. Let's say it like that. And in that thing that he builds, it's a demonstration of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, let me show you what it kind of looks like here. And I found these. I really like the third one here. So, go ahead and put that up. So, you can't see it there. It kind of looks like it has the capstone on, but if you look from the top down in a satellite picture, which is the next one, you can see it's flat on top. There's something missing. And then they think that before, you know, before it had like a limestone outer shell and it looked like this before and they put a capstone on it to to make it represent something. And what is does anyone have an idea of like what that could also represent? Anyone if we read in Revelations the heavenly city. So it's a pyramid shape and it comes down out of heaven. Now we're going to get into something here. You're going to have to bear with me. Like I said, if you find it in the message different, you you feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. It says something like this in Revelations 21:16. And the city lith for square and the length is as large as the breath. And he measured the city with the reed 12,000 furongs. The length and the breath and the height of it are equal. 1 1500 miles. 12,000 furongs equals500 miles. So that city brother Bam said shaped like a pyramid is 1500. It's 1500 miles by 1500 miles and it's shaped. I wonder and this is just now venturing without authority. If Enoch had also something in him that knew there was something coming that a heavenly city that was coming and as he be to build because you know he's walking with God. You know the Bible said he walked with God and then he just disappeared. He he was not and that's going to happen. But I wonder while he was doing that if God began to express through him the heavenly city or or the coming of Christ that would be becoming. Now listen to this. This is this is important. And I and I was listening to future homeman and and before the brother even asked the question I heard brother Bham say this notice but this geographical measure now that we have who dimensions are the same doesn't necessarily mean that has to be a cube. Notice this would answer Egypt or Enoch's sign in Egypt. So when Enoch's doing this it's a sign of something. And brother Bam says that sign answers what we see in Revelation the dimensions. He said in the earth's time of purifying by its baptism of fire. There'll be volcanics such as this earth exploding. It'll push up a pyramid-like mountain. See plenty of room to do it. The whole thing will be changed. The whole surface will be changed. You got it. It'll push up a pyramid-like mountain. This would be exactly with the word if it does it now. No. And he goes into there. And I thought, now wait a minute. Does it push up a mountain or does the holy city descend out of heaven? Isn't that just a beautiful one, brother Kurt? I love it because you know if there's a Bible question, there must be a Bible answer. Listen to the next quote. This is questions and answers. Said, "I'm a pilgrim, a stranger looking for a city whose builder and maker is God. He knowed that city was somewhere. Oh my." And I believe that right on the grounds where he looked for it right there in Palestine. That's where it'll raise up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For it's on Mount Zion. There's where she'll be. And and as I was studying this, I began to get lost in God. Now I'm confused, Lord, because you said it'll come down. John saw it. I mean, he saw it. You read in Revelations, he he says it right here that that he saw it descend out of heaven as a bride prepared for her husband. And he says coming down from even uses coming down from God. And then brother Bam says it pushes up. And and I just begin to like ponder this. How could it be that it pushes up and it comes down? I know you're looking for me for the answer. I don't have it, but I'm going to read some quotes. And I think in there, there's an answer in there. And there's a reason we read first John because on earth was God in flesh, virgin born manifestation. And yet John saw something. It was like, well, we'll read the quote in a second. It was like there's a piece of God on earth and there's a capstone coming down. And I wonder if that's the same with you and me. I wonder if in there's a predestinated seed. I'm just going to skip the quote and go to this. There's a predestinated seed inside of you. &gt;&gt; You might have, you know, even when you're in the world, even when you were you were in sin and you were struggling and you know the seed, not the flesh, the seed was predestinated. And it was predestinated by God's fornowledge before the foundation of the world. So, so that was predestinated &gt;&gt; and it was on earth, &gt;&gt; but it wasn't come capt. The Holy Spirit hadn't come down on it yet, but it was predestinated. Brother told me a story the other day where he said that even while he was in sin, God prevented him from doing certain things in his life and protected him in certain moments that probably would have drawn him away from where he should have been. What was it? a seed predestinated in the person before he was even filled with the Holy Ghost, before he was even justified, quite frankly. So now that seed is on earth, but it's not capped yet. And so I feel this is brother Steve now, but it's something like this that that you're here on earth and it's a type of when you get the Holy Ghost, when you're converted. And so you're here, but you might not be capped yet, but now God comes down out of heaven. And heaven on in heaven means heaven on earth, &gt;&gt; the predestinated sea that's inside you that was placed there before the foundation of the world. And you might look at you and say, "But brother Steve, I couldn't be heaven on earth when I was living in sin." Oh, I tend to disagree. I think that you just didn't know that you were heaven on earth, just like this earth doesn't know that it's Jerusalem on earth yet. But one day when it's purified by fire and heaven will connect with it, earth will have a realization that it's heaven on earth and heaven and heaven will meet heaven on earth just like it did when you got a realization and you got a purifying by fire and heaven and heaven met you heaven on earth. Oh, that's all right. I love preaching questions and answers. It's better than reading questions and answers, you know. Do you get it though? If you're predestinated, not your flesh, &gt;&gt; your seed is predestinated. &gt;&gt; I mean, you could no more be lost &gt;&gt; than God himself could be lost. You know, this very earth that you're on is an expression of God. Man has corrupted it. Man continues to corrupt it. If time goes on, it'll just get worse and worse. Irritates me so bad. We got a snowstorm. We get no snow. It seems to be warming up. The lake I go to like to fish at is drying up. I just It really frustrates me. But that's just the corruption of man. But one day it's going to be back to the expression that God meant for it at the beginning. Just like when you were a, you know, you were a sinner and you were filthy and you were laden with sins, but God had to come and purify before he could come out of heaven and his holy mountain could descend upon you. Heaven on earth. All right. All right. I hope that makes sense. I want to read these quotes, though. When he went, see now, see now, brother Van begins in future home to talk about Jesus on earth. And right in the middle of future home, he's talking about God on earth. Why is he doing that? He's teaching us something about this. When he went up out of the water, he said, "I saw heavens open." The prophet saw it. He saw the heavens open. And here come descending out of heaven a form of a dove and a voice saying, "This is my part of the earth that I've redeemed." &gt;&gt; What? What? Do you understand what he's saying? there my part that I've redeemed and from this part of the earth I'll redeem the rest of it. Who's he talking about? He's talking about the Lord Jesus Christ. And and he says my part of the earth I've redeemed and through him I'll redeem the entirety of the earth for he's my word made manifest in the whole world I spoke it into existence by my word. Hebrews 11. And Satan has held it all this time but I've come to redeemed it. So much of it has made his body of it has made his body and I'm coming to dwell in it. So much of this earth made his body and God came and dwelt and John said, "I saw the holy seed." Notice this is the next I mean this is the next thing here. So he goes from Christ on earth now in in John chapter 1. Now we're in Revelations 21 just from one paragraph to the next. John said, "I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband. And where did it settle on? Just exactly like it did there upon the earth. Where does it settle on on you? Jesus was part of that earth that the Holy Ghost descended upon. Is that right? And it remained on him forever. It can never leave him. It's always there. He and God are one. Always has to remain. And so John saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending like a common or a dove coming out of heaven and settling on a redeemed entire earth to do what? to claim every attribute that he made the earth for. Every man that was represented in the eternity and every woman is redeemed. Then she has been scoured and burned by fire. My isn't it? I'm sorry. It's a beautiful thought. Jesus and his fiery temptations in the wilderness for 40 days. After that, notice it was ready for his ministry. Then think of it, the Holy Ghost descending upon earth. Jesus and that holy blood. Now watch, and I hope to get too deep for you. See the holy blood that was created by God. the blood, the life, the creation of God. Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God. Oh, you see it. God made in creation. He was spirit. The Bible said he's the beginning of the creation of God. How did he begin? In the wombs of a woman. Praise God. Now, now watch. Look them hands. Now, this is a this is we go from paragraph 316 to 357. Same message. Now watch. Look them hands designed this for his beloved bride. designs and tenderly love for his bride. Remember that the Holy Ghost descended on Jesus which Jesus was a part of the earth. Why? The germ of God. The life of God was designed in the womb of a woman. That right? Which was the earth. All right. Then the life of God came in. So he was the beginning of the creation of God. See, and then that blood of God that was there by the germ where when it was shed at Calvary dropped back upon the earth. What for? To redeem the earth. Now it's been justified. It's been sanctified, called, and claimed. And now it's to receive its baptism of fire and be cleansed for Jesus and his bride. And you are these outer parts that's drawn out of this earth. The earth, you're a part of the earth. Your body, your soul is a part of God, an attribute of God displayed here on earth in a body. The body is to be redeemed. Now, the soul is redeemed because it was in sin. So God come down by a process and he does this with the earth of justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul and you being a part of the earth is redeemed by it. You're in the process now. It's growing. Your body was justified under Noah's baptism. Amen. In your flesh when it dropped upon there and the earth is to be cleansed by fire, the place where you live with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, a dwelling place for Christ and his bride, the new Jerusalem. You really can't separate them. that God would come down on the Holy Ghost upon earth. You upon you a redeem and he would he would descend and where would he come out of when he fills you with the Holy Ghost? He would come out of none other than eternity out of heaven and fill you with the Holy Ghost. Earth redeemed and he and he does that and he and he gives a capstone to you. Of course he does it. So if and I hope this you know doesn't answer the question but we begin to think about the pyramid. think something come up from earth and out of heaven and they met and that's the beautiful part of it. I got more on that here but we'll just we'll just skip forward to the next question. Well, let me read this one. Luke 17:20. And when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, he answered him and said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation. Neither shall they say, lo here or lo there, for behold, the kingdom of God is within you." &gt;&gt; Isn't that a good That makes me happy. Praise the Lord. All right. I hope that gave you a little insight into that. I don't know. Oh, you don't just say the pyramids exactly, but that to me it's a sign of something. Enoch sign, a a capstone, a sign of something to come. Praise the Lord. All right. Now, next question. All right. And by by the way, if you're a visitor, these are doctrinal questions, maybe a little bit for our church. And uh yeah, so if you had any more questions after the service, we'd be happy to explain those. Question. Does heaven only last? Do we have that there, Sister Pauline? Farther down there. Yep. Does heaven only last a thousand years? Then do we go to a place like earth? Does hell only last a thousand years? A good question. I think maybe in the messages sometimes I'll talk about the millennium or the thousand years and we'll reign with him a thousand years. And it's true. We will we will reign with him a thousand years. But heaven doesn't only last a thousand years. And reality that thousand years isn't even heaven. That's a a reign here on earth. Now, we'll call, you know, it's it's a it's a type. It's a resting time for the earth. And we could say that Satan is bound a thousand years. And we'll read a scripture maybe to to kind of uh go through that there in Revelations 20. I saw an angel. Revelations 20:1. And I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. and he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit. So now we know it's a thousand years and Satan is bound and ca and he's cast into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled. After that he must be loosed a little season. And I saw thrones and they sat upon him. They sat upon him, and judgment was given unto them. And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. And there's some things important in that verse and I know it's a long one but where he sees the thrones and and and now he's still looking in this millennial time period this thousand years and he says judgment was given to them and I saw that the ones now they they were beheaded and for the word of God and they had not worshiped the beast they didn't worship his image they didn't receive a mark on their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with him a thousand years. So there's a group that didn't receive marks that will live and reign with Christ for a thousand years. So now Satan is bound during that time and they'll live. And then uh the rest of the dead live not again until the thousand words were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed is hol blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection. on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years. So now we have this time. Go to the slide there. I think we have a picture and we kind of drew this maybe to give uh something that would help you to understand. We'll read that there. And then at the return of the church and the bride, the bride and Christ shall walk out upon their ashes in the millennium when the earth is purified by fire. And so now there's a time period at the end of the tribulation where the earth is purified and the bride and Christ shall walk upon their ashes in the millennium. The earth is purified and there they shall reign. And the heathens that's never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time. And the sons of God will be manifested. If he's to reign, he's got to have something to reign over. He's got a domain. And they ruled and reigned with Christ. And Christ ruled with a rod of iron the nations. Then the gospel, then the manifested sons of God with the authority just like he had when he was here. See, there will come the millennium in that rain. See, upon the ashes. If we could go to that next one there, and we'll try to point it out. And again, this is doing the best we can here to kind of explain. And and someone else asked a question about what's next. I think the question was what's next? What's what are we waiting for? What's the next thing? And uh Thessalonians, pull up 1 Thessalonians 4, Sister Pauling, and we'll read that there. um then we were alive and remain. It's toward the end of the chapter. Okay. So, the next thing we're looking for is called the resurrection. That's the next thing that we're looking for. We're not looking for one day to just be raptured. Although we are looking for that, but the next thing in the process, Paul says, then we which are alive, go ahead and pull that up. And remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet them. Um I think go to the verse before that. Sorry about that. For the Lord himself, this is the next thing, shall descend from heaven with a shout. Now the shout is, anyone know what the shout is? &gt;&gt; The message. The shout is the message. So sure it happened. It is happening right now. So the shout is the message. So that's the process with the voice of the archangel. What does the voice of the archangel do? But call and with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first. So there's something that's going to happen first and that is the dead in Christ shall rise first. So the next thing when I say the next thing we're looking for the resurrection the shout is going on right now. There's the voice of the archangel which I believe is calling those those those dead saints up out of the grave. Then there's a trump of God and that's the the the the great we would say trumpet but it's the great sounding forth of God. Okay, go to the next verse. So we know the next thing is the resurrection. Then we which are alive and remain. So now there's going to be some that are alive. So there's a resurrection that happened. Graves are literally, you know, maybe not literally all of a sudden graves are going to open up. But God's going to gather and he knows where the atoms are. You know, he knows where the pieces he needs to gather are because somebody has to knock on your door. So it's got to be like a physical being that's going to come and and and and and you're going to I think he says it like this. you're going to take a step towards them and they'll take a step towards you and and then it'll be on. And so God will gather in a resurrection those bodies of those saints the that that that that were filled that received the message for their day, even the ones, you know, from Paul's day to this day. And then they'll be they'll be resurrected or they'll be brought together and and and their bodies and the cells in their bodies and they'll, you know, your loved ones that you might have might come knocking at your door. I'm looking at some of you that might have lost children or might have lost parents that believe this message. Guess what? There'll be some surprises on that day, I believe. And you might even be surprised at who would knock at your door. But, you know, a knock will come and you'll have so much, you know, it'll it'll quicken you so much to see that thing. It might just be the extra step of faith you need to have that body changed. Okay. So, now you're we're alive. Some of us are going to be alive &gt;&gt; and remain and be caught up together. So now there's a catching up. That word is uh the word we use for rapture is actually Greek and it means catching away. So now those that are resurrected, those saints and then we which are alive. So it's kind of two groups there. There's some that are dead and some that are alive, but they're not dead in, you know, eternal separation. They're just not. They're just sleeping, you know. So there, but then we'll be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Go to back to that slide. So the next thing's the resurrection and then there's a space of time in the first resurrection and I mean first resurrection when Jesus resurrected he didn't just resurrect and go immediately to ascending. &gt;&gt; He resurrected and he did some things. I think did he go fishing? Tell me he went fishing. Somebody tell me that he's going to go to Lake Pal with me, you know. But anyway, so I believe he went fishing or at least went to where Peter was fishing and then he there was some cooking that went on. So he ate and then he showed himself to two that were walking on the road to Emmas and there was I think 143 fish caught in one time and and so he did some things. There was a time period. Brother Brandham calls it a month or so. So we'll just call it a month or so. I put those arrows close together, but it's a month or so. 30 days, 40 days. So then it's resurrection, rapture. Then there's this time period here. And I kind of blurred these lines because I don't like to put anything too definitive, you know. So anyway, there's this this that's the reason there is is is the 30 to 40 days, but there's a three and a half year wedding supper and I put or tribulation. Well, it kind of depends where you're at. &gt;&gt; It kind of depends where you're at. You know, [laughter] I'm praying, brother Brandon. I want to be in those. I want to be eating. you [laughter] know, I I I really want to be, but there's going to be some, Brother Brandon words it like this. They they didn't accept the atonement fully that are going to go through the tribulation for three and a half years. You don't want to be in that groom. So, you know, if you had an option today and you haven't made it sure, make it sure because you don't want to be in the tribulation. It's going to be a time no like it like never before. Never before it or after it. I think the Bible says there's never been a time as bad as that. It's going to be tribulation. It's called great tribulation. So, we want to miss that. But that is going to be a time. So, uh in heaven or in another dimension, I'll say it like that. There's going to be a wedding supper. And brother Benham says the table for that supper, now this isn't like some doctrine, you know, I've got it measured out, but he says it's thousands of miles long. He there's a quote. He says thousands of miles long and I if you wonder is there any room at that table there's room there's room for you this morning if you haven't made that sure it's thousands of I I did one time I did like thousands of miles and then 5,280 ft and each person takes three feet you know I went a little weird with it but and I didn't even know are we on both sides of the table is it a round table anyways point is there's room &gt;&gt; so you don't want to be left here left behind on earth during that time. There will be somewhere who will have to give their life. They'll have to give their life and then they'll sleep [snorts] for a thousand years. But we will reign for a thousand years. You read the scripture. He says they'll reign with him for a thousand years on earth with a rod of iron. And that's an interesting. So there's some people now he says in that quote and I don't don't ask me what that means by the way because he says there'll be heathens raised during that time that never had a chance to hear the gospel. Put that back up sister Pauline if you would. So so there'll be so he says that. So he then he words it like this. If he's going to reign he's got to have somebody to reign over. Uh right there. Yeah. He's got to have something something to reign over. He's got a domain. Okay. So he's we're reigning with him over something and we'll reign. And I think brother Jim used to tell it like this and I like it. You know, if they wouldn't bring their tithes into the city, then we would say it's not going to rain. And I think this is scriptural too in Isaiah if I'm not mistaken. Is Isaiah Isaiah 66 maybe? So So they didn't bring their ties in. And so we would say you're not getting rain for three years. So there's a a way of reigning that it's you know you're going to have to line up. It's with a rod and then go back to the slider. So that's for a thousand years. That's a long time. I think it'll be just the most blessed time. Okay. So it's a millennial reign and then yeah just a blink maybe just like a day. Go to the next slide. So then that thousand years ended in the Bible. We read the scripture a minute ago. Satan is loosed for a season. And I don't know what that time period is, but there's a battle. It's called the battle of Gog and Magog. And I'll give you the the the key here. Don't bet on Satan on that one. He's already lost. Okay. So, the the saints win. And then there's the what we call the white, it's in the Bible, the white gray white throne judgment or the white throne judgment. There's a judgment. every person that's dead. That's not, you know, the saints are going to be there judging, but there's going to be judging everybody that lived during that time. Now, you have the option to escape that. That's a beauty of it by being the ones that do the judging with Christ or the the ruling or the the judging for lack of a better term. So, that's a judgment time. And I kind of blurred that again because it's Satan loosed for a season, a battle. I'm not getting too complicated here. and then a judgment and then John chapter 2 and there's many other scriptures we we have a few of them up here and this is the promise that he have promised us even eternal life so heaven is not a thousand years the millennial reign is a thousand years but then there's more happening after that heaven is heaven is incomprehensible for us because we say the word eternity I love I was listening to message and brother Bham said it like this Christ stepped out is it already 12:10 oh my goodness We want to get to the next question, but we'll finish this one. Christ stepped out of eternity into earth. And then he says there's a scripture that says, "I come from God and I go to God." He says he stepped out of eternity and then he says he stepped back into eternity. So he stepped out of God and into God. And so God, you know, I'll just maybe I'll answer part of a question here, but we'll get to it Wednesday. God uh you know he's talking and he says where were you Job when the sons of God shouted for joy and we don't believe it I'll give a little bit of the answer here we have a lot more for it on Wednesday but we don't believe any the doctrine brother Bam says it like this of pre-existence of souls or even eternal sunship he words it like that so you I hate to break this to anybody but you didn't actually like exist in a physical being at the beginning although we like to say like I was there. No, brother Steve, I was there. And and he looks at Job and he says, "Where were you?" And and and we say, "Brother, but Brother Steve, I was there. I believe I was there." And you know, in physical being, you weren't I hate to break it. You weren't there. But here's the key. When God has a thought, &gt;&gt; God, now I have thoughts. I'll tell you, I have a thought. I love Sister Dette. That's a thought. And then I express it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I become that thought. You know I confess that you know I I become that I be actually become that love for sister Dette. Now I have a thought now I might have a thought that you know I'm going to DeMarcos today brother Ryan that would almost be you know just material but I might not go to DeMarcos. So I might have a thought and it might not happen but I might have a thought and it might become part of me. You're I'm human. I can have thoughts and and some of my thoughts aren't my thoughts quite frankly. Satan drops them in there and I kick them back out, you know. So, I can have thoughts that aren't mine, but I can also have thoughts that that are mine that don't become reality. Well, God can't. He's not that way. [laughter] So, when I when I say, "Where were you, brother Bill?" When the sons of God shouted for joy and brother Bill, I believe I was there. Well, you know what? Because he was in the thought of God, which can't be a thought that comes and goes and fleeting and changes it. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's so material. &gt;&gt; It's actually a material thought. So if God thought about you, then you were there, &gt;&gt; but you weren't there physical, but you were there in the perfection of his almighty thoughts. So when I, you know, you hear a minister and we all kind of like to do it, man, I was there. And you know, we get all riled up. We can misconceive that a little bit and go, "Wait a minute, brother Steve, you know, I wasn't actually." No, you you were but you actually you were more there than if you would think you were there right now because you were there and the thoughts eternal cannot change of God. Now I can have a thought. I could change a thought. So God's thoughts I think he says it something like this. He never had a uh how does he word it? But he never had a thought that he had to change. It's something like that. So now God would have a thought of brother Steve and you know what that thought it just materializes. And so even though it wasn't like materialized back then but but because God lives in eternity but before he steps out of eternity because he lives there he's looking at Job and he's going where [screaming] are you Job? And he's speaking like Job do you even know I'm looking at eternity and you're right there with the sons of God shouting for joy. Where were you? And Job would have been I'm there because why? Because God's not even in this thing that we call time. It's beyond time. And we get caught up in it and it it battle and we battle it and we go back and forth and we wonder about it. Well, where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy? I'm right. I was right there. How do you know you were there, man? I just I just know I was there. But but how do you know, Brother Steve? Well, let me tell you. Let me tell you what happens in brother Steve's life. I go back and I begin to doubting my own experience sometimes. I begin to wonder if I'm going to make it and I begin to think there's no hope for me. And then and then what happens is I like pull on this little anchor, you know, boy and it holds. And I'm like, you know what? That's how I know cuz every time I went down and pulled on that anchor, it held. That's how I know. So I know I was in the eternal thoughts of God. Which of God have a thought? It became material. And that's you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just unbelievable actually. It's believable though. But it's it's believable, but it's incomprehensible for our little canary pea brains, you know. But it's true nonetheless. So if God has a that'll be the third one. I know, [sighs] man. The talk went too fast. We might do questions and answers all year. How's that? We'll just preach. You know what it is, though? It's like revealing. Let me tell you what it did for me. I was wrong on some of these topics. And I began to study in it and the Lord was like, "You were wrong there." And because I really kind of like thought I was there. But that's okay because when I read about it, I was actually more there than I thought I was there. &gt;&gt; I was actually more there than I even preconceived that I was there because God had a thought and he never had a thought he had to take back and go, "No." You'd say, "Well, brother Steve, didn't Moses change his mind?" No, no, no. Christ was in Moses and God had a test. He had to like respond to that Christ in Moses and and and you know Ephesians 1:11 says something like this. God took the counsel of his own will. &gt;&gt; Oh my. It's be pull that up. That'll be our last scripture as your musicians come. Well, go to a verse like let's start maybe around verse 9. I don't have it up there, but I know it's in there. Having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself. Verse 10. that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are which in heaven and which are on earth even in him. So it's he God is saying he's going to gather and he had a he had a purpose to his will. Then go the next one and he's talking about you in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will. Why are you even here this morning? By your will? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Not even like, but there's a will on the inside that brought me here this morning that, you know, I had to do like Jesus said, not my will, but I would be like to be like brother Tom. And sometimes when I go to minister, I'm like, "Brother Tom, let me at him." You know, I can't wait to come out that door. But this morning, I was like, "Lord, have him call Brother Donald up to preach." You know, because I don't have any answers, but I know one thing. if I get closer to because see, brother brother Donnie said this to me the other day. I really appreciated it, brother Donnie. He said, "Brother Steve, sometimes people don't need an answer." He said they need a guide. And I was like, "That's really good. They're going to use that." So, you might not you you might think you need an answer. Maybe you just need someone to come and follow me. But where are we going? Just follow me. No, but uh I want to know when when you know a lot of questions they ask Jesus when is it going to happen? How what what's going to be the time period? They would always ask him what about this time or what what's about the future? Just follow me. I think the day he does that you know what what about what about this this thing coming? What about the tribulation? What about the end time? There's so many questions always on a questions and answer. You have questions like that. Jesus is like you know follow me. And then while you follow him, you know what'll happen? He'll just begin to show you. But really what he wants to do is just follow him. You don't need the answer. But you really don't need the answer. You need him who is the answer on the inside. Praise the Lord. Stand stand with me this morning. And if you get him, if you get that answer on the inside, by the way, you'll still have questions. I'll still do my best to kind of approach them with you. No problem. That's I that's normal. One of the questions from my daughter. No problem at all. Happy to do it. But in the answer, I hope you see Christ and I hope you re I hope you I hope you I hope he just grabs you by the hand and he just begins to lead you and then you but see because we worry about the future so much. That's where anxiety comes from. It's a worry of the future and we all Lord but what about that and when and that you know what if if you do anything this morning don't worry about the resurrection don't worry about the la rapture follow him. Keep your eyes focused on him. You're not going to miss a thing. You're not going in the tribulation. Focus on him every day of your life and you'll make it. Praise God. Amen. Okay, what do we sing?
