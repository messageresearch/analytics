Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Wonder. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Good morning. Let's stand [music] songs please sir if that's okay. like to start with the chorus of the first sister Pauline the fourth verse of have thine own way Lord have thine own way pleased in the Lord but have thine own way Lord yesterday I spent some time with my sister and I say this not for an emotional standpoint Just I want you to all think about it. As you all know, she lost her child. A lot of you have my uncle Bob give us a testimony. [music] So, it's not just her, but it caused you to take each day not only with the ones you have, but we have a privilege to come into the presence of the Holy Spirit, God, today. &gt;&gt; So, have thine own way, Lord. Give them everything. Don't Don't hold anything back. Don't close the doors on anything. Today is the only day, this moment that we have. So have thine own way, [music] Lord. And then the fourth verse, and we'll turn it to brother Steve.

Oh [music] Lord my king [music] [music] [singing] with thy spirit [music and singing] all shall &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Christy [music] all [singing] [music] bless you this morning. I do have an announcement. Won't take very [music] long, so I'll leave you standing. um next Sunday during the [music] morning service which is our questions and answers service. And if you have any questions uh there in the container in the back, feel free to write those questions in. We're going to need two services based on the questions that have been written in so far and we're going to need a lot of the Lord's help to answer those, but that'll be next Sunday. During that service, we're going to have a vote for a specific need that we are desiring or maybe thinking [music] about supporting in Zimbabwe for sister Louisa's well I [music] saw brother Caleb here, sister Leona, it's her aunt, sister Louisa's cousin or she does the work there in Zimbabwe and [music] there's a need for a vehicle and so we're going to be voting uh if the church [music] would desire to support that need. The trustees have already had a conversation about it and the deacons and decided to put it forth to the body. We we do have some information and there's these sheets out there as [music] you walk in. Uh you can read them over and they answer some questions. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out to myself or brother Donnie, one of the deacons. Um this is not a poll in any way for any financial help. The church has the funds. It's just a vote to determine if [music] we want to use the funds in this manner and it's a large amount and so I think 20 to 30 plus thousand. So we just felt the body would uh we would present that to the body. Also we have a recording of Zoom when we did a a trip report a report and I'll send that to the groups the chat groups so you can watch that recording if [music] you want to inform yourself a little more about the work that goes on in in Zimbabwe there. So that'll be next Sunday. Just that quick announcement. I don't think there was any prayer requests written [music] in, but I know we have needs. Is there anything specific that we might have missed or [music] failed to to write in? Sister Kathy, the Watley family. Remember the Watley family in prayer? Of course, we have See, Sister Karen, did Brother Glenn make it today? Praise the Lord. Oh, there you are, brother Glenn. Good to see. Praise the Lord.

Some of these songs you you may say, "Oh, they're a little bit older, but they're still good. &gt;&gt; They're what I know." Amen. Amen. You young people, I'm going to ask some friendship with Jesus. It was number 80 in the in the book as far as that goes there. I'm going to ask you some questions, you young people. Brother Steve, I hope he he can correct me if I'm out of place here. But when you've heard brother Brandham talk about the angel of the Lord, and I guess what I'm trying to remind us that that it's not just these pews, but there's a physical there's something else going on. And I don't want us to forget that. &gt;&gt; But when you hear him talk about the angel of the Lord, what do you have in mind? Now, I'm not going to ask you questions, but I want you to think about it. I maybe didn't understand it. Did you know the prophet tells us that he was as real as brother Donnie was sitting here? &gt;&gt; He says he's standing here and just walking. I guess what I want to make you do is draw you conscious of these songs that we sing. We're not just singing about something way away. &gt;&gt; It's just one step away. And if you have any questions, go to demonology and the spiritual realm and you'll find that answer. And it's good because it makes you conscious. You start thinking, okay, brother Ryan, you can play that song. Do you know the song? It's uh it makes you conscious of whatever you're doing during the day. Oh, somebody's seeing what I'm doing. Somebody's watching me. And it makes you very conscious, makes you friendship with Jesus. And it's not to scare you. Please trust me. I'm not doing that. I'm just saying that it helps you grow. That's all. That's all. Friendship with Jesus. Do you not know the song, Brother Ryan? If you don't, we we'll go to another one. your friendship with [music and singing] Jesus. Oh fellowship divide [music] and oh what blessed union for Jesus is a friend [singing] of Jesus.

[singing] [music] [singing] Praise [music and singing] [music] [singing] [music] [singing] the Lord. We're not [music] done singing yet, so just stand by. I got I got to say something this morning. As your pastor, one of my favorite things to do in my spirit is repent. And that's one of the hardest things to do in my flesh. But I I got to repent because I, Brother Brandham said, and brother Eddie Biscll's vision of the brown bear, you look it up online, he he didn't do what he was supposed to do. And then it was rain for four days and then he come out of praying and he said, "I'm the Jonah in this group." You remember that? I encourage you to watch. It's very, very interesting. And I'll just confess, I got in a mood last night over something and I was cranky and was at the late at night. Devil attacks me sometimes [music] over complexes. I got in a mood and I really didn't get over it. So I'm the Jonah, &gt;&gt; but I confess it. It's over. &gt;&gt; And that's it. &gt;&gt; So I want to sing that song, Rolled Away. Rolled Away. You know that song? I had it up there, I think. So here's the thing. When you come into church, every one of you is bringing something. &gt;&gt; You are. So you bring, you know, you put everything aside before you get here and get it all out of the way and under the blood and then come here under expectation as a brother saying. And then we're going to sing this and then Sister Bethany, we'll have you I know she has a special. We'll have her come after we sing this and and brother Isaac will come out. Roll away. Roll [music] away. [music and singing] Yeah. Heat. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] Yeah. [singing] [music] Heat. [music] [singing] [music] Oh, [music] [singing] heat, [music and singing] [music] heat. [singing] [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music and singing] [singing and music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music and singing] [music and singing] Yeah. Heat. [music] [singing] All the way. Oh, [music] I may be seated. &gt;&gt; I've uh I've sang this song a lot, but I was telling him this morning, I said uh every time I sing it, it it means a little more to me. So if you know it, if you happen to know it, you can sing it with me. Oh, I've lost some good friends. A long life's way, some love ones departed [singing] in heaven to stay. But thank God I didn't lose everything. [singing] I lost faith [singing] in people who said they cared. In the times of my crisis, they were never there. Oh, through all of my struggles. Yeah. through all [screaming] that pain. You see, one thing ever wed and one thing never change. [singing] [music] I never lost my hope. Oh, and I never lost my joy. [music] I never lost my faith, [singing] but most of all, I never lost my praise. [screaming] [music] Well, I've let [singing] some blessings [music] slip away. Oh, I lost my [music] focus. And I went astray. But thank God I didn't [music] lose everything. And I've lost possessions that were so dear. Now I've lost [music and singing] some battles by walking in fear. Oh, but through all of those struggles. Yeah. through all that pain. You see, one thing never wavered and one [singing] thing [music] never change. [screaming] Oh, I never lost my home [music] and I never lost my joy. [screaming] I'd never lost my faith, [singing and music] but most of all, I never lost my [singing] praise. And my praise is still [music] here. And my praise [singing] [music] is still here. My praise [singing] is still here. [music] Yes, my praise is [music] still [singing] here. Let me ask you this morning, where's your [music] praise? [singing] It's still here. Yes, my praise is still [singing] here. Oh, through the good and the bad, my praise is still here. Through every trial I've had, my praise. Oh, it's still here. And I never lost my hope. Oh, and I never lost [singing] my joy. Oh, I have lost my faith. But most of all, I never lost my praise. [screaming] [applause] Sister Bethany, you better help us sing that as we stand. and we'll invite Brother Isaac out. Some of you might &gt;&gt; feel like you've lost your joy. You might feel like you lost your faith, but [music] it's there. &gt;&gt; It could be restored. &gt;&gt; David said, "Restore to me so you can be restored." Help us lead us in that as Brother Isaac would come out. [singing] &gt;&gt; And I never lost my home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, and I never lost my joy. [music] I never lost my faith. But most [singing] of all, I never lost my praise. [music] Oh, I never lost my home. Oh, I never lost my joy. [music] I never lost my faith. But most of all, [music] I never lost my praise. [music] Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap this morning a praise. [applause] Amen. He's worthy of it, isn't he? Amen. There's that song about what am I going to do? I think I'll throw up my hands. Amen. Sometimes you get to that place where you just don't know what to do. You don't know which way to turn. Your back's up against a wall. Say, "What do I do?" He said, "I think I'll just throw up my hands and praise the Lord because when the praises go up, the glory comes down and he'll make a way where there would seem to be no way." Amen. That's the God that I serve this morning. And it's just good to be with you in the house of the Lord. We just want to say thank you to brother Steve for the opportunity to be here with you all. And uh you may have your seats just for a minute. Thank you musicians. So, we'll we won't keep you long, but just want to greet you and just just good to have my wife and little boy with me this morning. Um, little Spencer. And so, I may not know many of you personally, but we just love you with all our hearts, just part of the same body. And, uh, we come from Ohio there, Bluton. Um, many of you, I'm sure, know Brother Wayne Lawson. He's been out this way a few years ago. That's our pastor there at Trer Tabernacle. So, we just want to bring greetings from them especially. And so, we just uh got to know brother Steve better just this year. We've we've known him, but we got to go uh he reached out during the summer sometime, I think, and asked us about going to Peru with him. And so, at first, you know, I was like, well, I've never done anything like that. So, that's a that's a big trip. I I've been overseas, but never to a third world country like that. And so it was a first time first type of that kind of trip for me. And so I just want to say thank you as a church for supporting that work. Um we just just just a little bit we've been involved. We see the fruit coming out of it. Uh I wasn't there for the whole time, but I know several were baptized in some of the places they went to and I just got to meet so many wonderful people myself as we uh landed in Lima there. Um just to see that type of that type of country. I say, "Lord, may may we never take for granted the things that we have, just everything barred up and crime and people being murdered and yet they come and gather and just worship the Lord." I thought, "What an amazing thing." And so, we had a wonderful time there. We had a good meeting there in Lima and then we would fly over to Aquitos there on the river and just just poverty, you know, and just hardly any cars just driving around in the rain on their motorbikes. And I'm sure you all seen many pictures and videos over the years with brother Steve being there. But we just go and there was a lady in her house that couldn't hardly walk. She couldn't get to church. So we just went there to pray for her and just just just the heart. But yet when they would come to church, they wouldn't hardly have any music. They wouldn't hardly have anything. And they were just so happy just to just to worship and just to hear the word preached. It was just a wonderful time. And uh we had two services there. Brother Isaac Robson spoke one and I spoke one and just just wonderful wonderful experience for me just to see that. And uh and then the last place I would get to go would be up the river to that little Timuro village. And that's where I started to question Brother Steve [laughter] said, "Brother, I'm trying to have faith." But that's a little tiny boat going up that river. I said, "Are you sure? I'm trying." And so, but but it wasn't it wasn't so bad once we actually did it. He it was it was all under control and we had the Lord watching over us. But but uh sometimes maybe it takes the greater sacrifice to get into those areas where the people are really really needy and really hungry. And so that was even though that was maybe the most uncomfortable part physically, it was probably the most impactful part for me just to see those people just 30 40 people showed up in another boat and they're just babies and they're bringing music and they're hugging and crying. and they some of them I think hadn't seen each other in maybe 10 years just to gather and have a meeting like that. They were just weeping and rejoicing and just so thankful and I just I was so blessed. And there was a deacon there that was working for for years. He had been clearing a area in the jungle and planting the cacao or caco uh in bananas trying to just make a little bit money of money to start a radio station to spread the message. Just working I think hours a day just to just to get some extra money to spread the message. And I when you see that it's just it's just strikes your heart. You can't you can't not be touched by that. So it was just a wonderful experience for me. We had wonderful meetings and uh it just put a burden in my heart for uh to to see souls saved of course in those type of countries but also to see them established in the word just to go in there and just preach the message and see them grow and be established in the word for our day. And I so I just want to say God bless you as a church. God bless your pastor. Amen. For the work that you're doing there. Amen. So if you could just stand again with me. Amen. speaking about that commission to go in all the world and preach the gospel. And this morning, I'd like to speak a bit on commission. So, we're going to turn to Joshua, the first chapter. Just trying to find the mind of the Lord. So, we just pray the Lord give us grace that he would just lead us. We'll turn to Joshua the first chapter. And just before we read that, if you have a need on your heart, maybe we could just bow our heads for a word of prayer. as we go into the word this morning. Lord Jesus, I just want to say thank you, Father. Lord, I want to say thank you for gathering us into your house this morning, Lord. Father, when you were here on the earth, Lord, you commanded your disciples to go and get a cult for you. You said it would be tied up in this certain place. And many people criticized it, Father, thinking, Lord, that it was pre-arranged by man. But, Father, it wasn't pre-arranged by man. It was pre-arranged by an infinite, all- knowing God. Lord, you pre-arranged a young boy to have five loaves and two fishes to come by that way that day that you could feed your hungry children. Father, I believe you've pre-arranged this meeting. I believe you've pre-arranged our lives. I believe, Lord, that Lord, sometimes, Lord, we think something's going wrong, but Lord, you're you're guiding us. You're leading us. You're making a way that Lord, we might miss an accident on the way to church and that you might keep us and shield us, Father. And I want to say this morning, we trust you, Lord. And I want to invite you into this service, Father, and pray that you have your way. Pray that you settle every nerve. I pray you close our lips from speaking anything contrary to your will and open them to speak your word only. And when it's all said and done, may you receive the glory in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Joshua 1, we'll read the first nine verses. A very familiar passage. Says, "Now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun. Moses minister, saying, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore arise and go over this Jordan, thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. and every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon. That have I given unto you, as I said, unto Moses, from the wilderness in this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, unto the great sea, toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. So be strong and of a good courage, for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them. Only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right hand or the left that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. in this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage. Be not dismayed, be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee, whethersoever thou goest. Amen. You may have your seats this morning. And uh if we could speak on a a title out of that this morning, we'd like to speak on commissioned for the job. Commissioned for the job. You see, Joshua was called to fulfill. Uh he was called to step into the tracks that Moses had stood. And brother Brandon would say it was no easy task. And brother Brandon would also say that I think of a minister today that's called of God to step into the tracks where Jesus stood. What a command. What a what a commission. And then he wouldn't just leave it on the ministers, but he would say, "But each that's called of God is commissioned to stand in that same place. I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the way." And he said, "How it must have felt for Joshua to talk to God that morning and receive this great commission that he would have to step into the tracks where Moses stood and to fulfill the shoes of this prophet." And what a warrior he was. No. Amen. No, no, no man like that man in that time. He was a prophet. Amen. Amen. A a wonderful prophet that was called and commissioned to bring the children out of Israel. And Joshua was commanded to step in the tracks where Moses had stood and fulfill the commission to take the children into the land. Amen. Moses was called to bring them out. Moses was commissioned by God to deliver the people, but he tried to fulfill that commission. [snorts] Amen. In his own humanity. And of course, that's where his great failure would be because he tried to deliver the people before going to that burning bush. Is that right? And he made a great failure in his humanity. Amen. And he had to go back to that burning bush and meet a living God. And then he could go back into Egypt and it would be a one-man invasion. Is that right? Amen. One man. He said it would be like somebody trying to take over Russia today as one man. That's what it was like. Moses going down into Egypt as one man. But he had got the confirmation of the commission. Amen. And that's what we have to do today. Just like Jesus commanded the disciples in Mark 16 that you shall lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover. You shall go into all the world and preach the gospel. But before you go, go up to Pentecost and receive the confirmation of the commission, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You must get the seal of your commission. You must go and stay until you're endued from power with power from on high. And then I will write behind you. It won't be the acts of the apostles, but it will be the acts of the Holy Spirit in the apostles. Is that right? And that's what he's doing today behind a bride. He's saying it, I mean, I'm not going to write it behind just a a letter church. I'm not going to write it behind just a a people and their humanity, but I'll put my Holy Spirit in you and then I'll write another book of Acts behind my people because it won't be them doing it. Amen. But it'll be my spirit in them. Is that right, brother Rolando? Amen. It It's not us. Amen. You are just like a sheep that puts forth wool. You are not called to manufacture. You are only called to bear the Christian walk. Amen. And when the Holy Spirit comes in you, brother, it takes the pressure off because I mean, you are no longer trying to manufacture anything. But when you ever catch the revelation of who you are, you'll know that you are only supposed to manifest what God has called you to do because that's what the world is groaning for. It's not the manufacturing, but it's the manifestation of sons and daughters of God. Amen. You are called to manifest the very life of Jesus Christ. Amen. so much until it will be so close to the ministry that Jesus had on earth until it will call the saints out of the grave. How could we do it, brother or sister? We could not do it. Amen. But when his spirit comes in you and you say, "Lord, Amen. Let me manifest your life and then it pushes out." Amen. Just like the tree pushes out new leaves in the springtime. Amen. You don't have to go out there and pluck the old leaves off. Amen. And say, "Tree, it's time that you bring forth new leaves." But it's a law that's written in nature that causes the tree to bring forth new life. Oh, amen. That's why we have confidence as ministry that if we can just get the people to the baptism of the Holy Ghost, then we won't have to beat them over the head with a stick. Then we won't have to bring out a tape measure every week and say, "Are you living like you should?" Amen. We believe in holiness. We believe in standards. We believe in preaching a closline religion. But what we really believe in is letting the Holy Ghost loose in the church. Amen. And then we won't have to sit and babysit him every day. Amen. But the tree will bring forth new leaves and manifest the life of Jesus Christ the way that it should. Amen. You must go and get the credentials. You've got no right to call yourself a preacher or even a Christian without those credentials. Amen. If you're going to join the army, you need your papers. You can't just go down and buy a 10- cent a uniform from the 10- cent store. As brother Brandon would say, you need your papers. Amen. You must Amen. Just like at our work, we I work at an office where you have to badge in and they give us special safety training. It's called piggybacking where people will try to get in on your badge. Amen. But that won't work in the kingdom of God. You've got to get your own badge. Amen. You've got to get your own credentials. Amen. You've got to get your own Amen. confirmation. You've got to get into that presence that Moses got in. And that presence will change you. Amen. It's that presence that Peter got in that took him from a coward to a preacher to preach the gospel with an authority and with a confidence. Amen. Because the problem is with people wouldn't get that commission. And brother Brandon would say they would try to get by with an ordination paper but not the seal of God. And that's when they would deny the very power of God. They would deny because the Bible says these signs shall follow them that believe. Right? So when he said when you see people denying those signs and denying that power, it shows, Amen, that they're denying the very confirmation of the commission, amen, that they're supposed to have. It shows that they don't have the confirmation, but they have just an ordination paper or a church letter or something on that accord. Amen. Because the Bible said many will come unto me in that day and say, "Have not I done this and have not done that?" And he would say, "Depart from me, ye that work iniquity. I never even knew you." Amen. Because it's like brother Steve was a police officer. It's like somebody trying to impersonate a police officer and say, "Well, I've done this and I've done that." But but they never went and got the training. They never went and got the badge. They never went Amen. Amen. They they never clocked into the job. Amen. And you can do a lot of work for the Lord. Amen. And it'll never it'll never return unto you in the investment because you didn't clock in. Amen. Depart from me ye that work iniquity. You never clocked in. You never went and got the seal of the commission. But if you clocked in, Amen. If you got the Holy Ghost, then brother, you can work for the Lord and he will repay you a hundfold, a thousandfold. Everything that you forsake for this gospel will re it will be repaid unto you. Amen. You can forsake houses and lands. You can leave mother and father. Amen. You can forsake everything. Amen. Sometimes you have to root up and leave everything you know for the sake of the gospel. But God said, "I will not leave you there. I will repay you a thousandfold. I will not say depart from me that work iniquity because you're mine. Because you're my seed. because you came from the back part of my mind and you're willing to follow my commission. Amen. Amen. And and it wasn't for everybody. Not everybody could go up to that upper room. Judas couldn't go up to that upper room because it wasn't in him. Brother Bram said that's where he showed his true colors was at Pentecost. Amen. That's why the scripture would say, "Don't rejoice that demons are subject to you because Judas was casting them out the same as the rest of them." But he said, "Rejoice that your name is written in heaven." That's the reason to rejoice this morning. If you have seen your name on the book in heaven, then brother, it's time to rejoice. It's time for the church to rejoice that has recognized, amen, that my name is written in heaven and there's not enough devils in hell, amen, to take it off. And I like something that Brother Wayne says about that book. He said, "It was your name written in there and it was only your name written in there. Your works are not recorded in that book. Amen. Your bad days are not recorded in that book, brother. Your hard days, mother. Your long nights, amen, where you're struggling, Amen, to to keep it together and you're struggling, amen, to not break down, amen, that is not recorded in that book. But what's recorded in that book is God saw you before the foundation of the world and chose you to be his son or his daughter. Amen. And he commissioned you, Amen, for this job. Amen. And it wasn't for everybody, but it was for the 120 that said, "Amen, come up to this upper room." And after they came up, Peter would preach a message that it's for you. It's for your children, and it's for as many as the Lord our God shall call. That's why I can say it might not be for everybody, but it's for me. Amen. Because I feel the calling on my life calling me. It's called me to a new birth. Amen. Brother Brandon would say about Rahab, you apply the token, it's for you. If you feel in your heart there is something tugging, it's for you and you apply the token. [snorts] Amen. It's a promise, friends. Blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. &gt;&gt; Not they might be filled, they shall be filled. It didn't say when you would be filled, but it said you shall be filled. If you bless, Amen. If you hunger or thirst after righteousness, you're blessed to even have that hunger. Amen. This morning, if you hunger for more God, I say you're blessed. If you're hungering for a deeper walk with God, you say, "Brother Isaac, I don't know how I'm going to get there, but I say you're blessed just to hunger because it's the deep calling to the deep." If there's a deep calling for more of God, there is a deep to respond. And it wouldn't be in your heart unless there was more of God to have. And when some of you may be hungering for revival, some of you are hungering for a fresh baptism in your lives. Some of you are hungering for your family to be set on fire, a new for the gospel. And I say you wouldn't hunger if the skies were not full of the Pentecostal blessing. But I say it's here. It's here this morning. The skies are here. Amen. clouds are full of the abundance of rain ready to be poured out upon those Amen. that are hungering and thirsting for more of God. Amen. If you hunger and thirst, it's for you. The devil will try to tell you it's not for you. He'll try to tell you, "Well, brother, you send away your day of grace." Amen. You've gone [snorts] too far. Amen. There's no way you could ever receive this. But I say it's a lie from the devil. Amen. If you still Amen. He said, "If you had sent away your day of grace, you would hate God." Amen. But you don't hate God. You love him. And that proves, Amen, that it's a lie that you have not sent away your day of grace. But it's a spirit trying to keep you from fulfilling your commission by twisting the word and manipulating the word. And he'll use the word to attack you just like he did Satan. It is written. It is written. You send away your day grace. Well, the Bible does say that some would send away their day grace, so it must be me. But he's twisting that word. But what do you respond, Satan? It is also written. It is also written. And you take that word and you fight that devil until you break out of that prison house and come into the truth over your life. And the truth is that it's for you. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam say you're sitting in a sermon. You're sitting in church and you feel sometimes that weight. You feel that pressure. Amen. And it's not anything wrong with the people, but it's a spirit at work. a spirit of unbelief trying to pull down the minds to try to make them think that they can't receive it. But brother Bham said this. He said if a person is, he said it's pulling right down with disbelief. You see, and I can feel that and tell it. Yes, sir. It makes it hard. But then if a person is really believing, they're pulling in the spirit of God because it's the word of God. We all know that. And if the devil can just put a question mark across there, he's got you. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. He said, "But when you erase that question mark and say that's every bit true and it's for me, then you're pulling from God." Amen. Why don't we exercise it this morning? Why don't you say it's for me? Amen. The Holy Ghost is for me. Amen. Joy is for me. Peace is for me. Amen. A fresh baptism is for me. A refilling of the Holy Ghost is for me. You say, "Brother Isaac, I've tried and I've tried and I just can't seem to break past that barrier. It must not be for me." Brother Bram said that's Satan trying to keep you from the blessing because every time that God is bringing a visitation, Satan will always try to stop the oncoming visitation. Amen. He'll try to bring Amen. A Sunday mornings are a perfect example. Maybe you were fighting on the way to church this morning. Maybe you were in the car and there was a little friction there. Amen. Between husband and wife or between mother and child, amen, but Satan is only trying to do that to block the oncoming visitation. Amen. But Satan cannot stop. Amen. What God has promised in this hour. He doesn't have enough. Amen. To stop it because he is true to his word. Amen. If you are called to receive the new birth, you never sought God. But God sought after you. And brother Brandon would say, "A true hunger will take you to Pentecost because creeds won't satisfy a hungry heart. You were predestinated to search for life." Oh my. I can witness to that. I remember when I was a young younger boy and when I would sit in my bedroom and I would just weep under the Lord. Say, "Lord, I need a reality. I need more than a tradition. I need more than a religion. I need more than a joining a church or sitting in a pew. Lord, I need a reality." Something was in me that wouldn't be satisfied with the creed. Amen. But that something that was there led me into a new birth. And I say, "Lord, I'm satisfied." Amen. That's what I was longing for. That's what I was hungering after. I was predestinated to search for life. Amen. That's what makes us excited this morning. [laughter] Amen. That's what makes us sing and shout and dance and rejoice. Amen. It's not just the music that makes us happy. But we love good music, don't we, brother Rolando? Amen. But it's more than that. It's more than a creed. It's more than a custom. It's something way down in the depths of your soul that is connected to heaven. A deep calling to the deep. Amen. Brother Brandon was out there in the woods that one time dancing around that tree and he said, "You can call it emotions if you want to, but to me it was the deep calling to the deep." Amen. It it it's more than a custom. It's Amen. It is something like that boy that was flying that kite that was connected to that kite way up in the air, but he could feel the tug of it. Oh, and if you're a son or daughter of God, there's a tug in your heart. Amen. And I don't care how lost you go in sin or how deep you go in the muck of this world. That tug will never leave you if you are amen from the mind of God because he's filtered you for the job. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you ever had a job interview? Amen. And they filter through all the candidates and if they choose you mean it wasn't because of some accident. They don't I don't as far as I know they don't take the papers and throw them up in the air and pick a random one, but they choose who's the best fit for the job. And you can try to run from that calling like Moses did and like Jonah did and like like like many men of God have did. But if he's called you, he's called you for a reason and he's filtered you for that position and no one can take your place. Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother Bram said, "He has chosen us or the Bible said he's chosen us in him before the foundation of the world according to his good pleasure." I mean, it pleased him to choose you. Amen. That's why when you go to the store, I mean, if it's your birthday, somebody can buy you a gift. Is that right? And you and you can put on your best smile and say, "Wow, man, I've always wanted that." And you might not you might put it on the shelf and never use it again because uh because you didn't choose it. But if they give you money and you go to the store and you purchase something, you're going to choose something that you need. You're going to choose something that you want. And that's what God did with us. He chose us according to his good pleasure. He didn't have to choose you, but he saw something in you, Amen, that he didn't see in the rest of the world. He knew that you would desire to be saved. He knew that you would desire, amen, that that life, that reality. And so he chose you in him before the foundation of the world. [gasps] Why could Jockabed look upon Moses as a young boy and say he's a goodly child? He just came out of the womb. He was he was fresh to the earth. I mean, he hadn't done anything good. Maybe he was born in sin, but his mother could say he's a goodly child because not because of who he was, but because God had chose him. He was a goodly child because God had predestinated him. And gifts and callings are without repentance. Amen. The prophets are born prophets. Is that right? Jesus, he was the son of God from before the foundation of the world. Amen. Amen. Amen. Jeremiah was ordained to be a prophet before he was ever in his mother's womb. And John the Baptist 712 years before he was born. Amen. Isaiah prophesied that he was a voice in the wilderness crying, "Prepare ye the way for the Lord." Lord, but brother Brandham said if they're ed, he said so was all those offices of God if they're called of God. If they're educated into it, it's only canon fodder. It can't be nothing. It's a meal ticket. You sell your birthrights for a meal ticket. And then he says, "But if it's of God, you'll stand by that word because you were born to stand by it." Amen. And no one else can take your place if you were ordained for that position. Amen. No one else can take your place. If God's called you, he's chosen you. Amen. As the Bible says, Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated. It says, "For he saith unto Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion." So it's not of him that willth or him that runth, but God that showeth mercy. And then he switches to Pharaoh and says, "For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, even for the same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. Therefore, he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will, he hardeneth." Amen. That's why brother Brand would say, "Esau tried to find a place to get right with God." Pharaoh tried to repent and get right with God, but they couldn't do it because that was their allotment. Amen. Because God before the foundation of the world, he predestinates us according to his fornowledge. Amen. His fornowledge. He's not just spinning a wheel and choosing. But by his fornowledge, he could predestinate you and say, "Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated." Amen. That's why there's a story in the Bible about how Ahab wanted to go up to Ramoth Gilead and conquer. Amen. And and everybody was telling him, "Go ahead. Go ahead and do it." Amen. You're going to be successful. You're going to conquer. You're going to be blessed. Amen. Amen. Because I believe it was Elijah had prophesied that the dogs would lick up his blood. And so that prophecy had to be fulfilled. So God said, "Who can we who can we send to get into these prophets to deceive Ahab to go up to Ramoth Gilead?" And a lying spirit came out of hell and got into those 400 preachers and said, "You should go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper." Amen. because it was prophesied that he would be deceived. Amen. But Amen. But I'll say this that Satan cannot get to you like that lying spirit got into those preachers because God got to you before Satan could ever get to you. Oh, brother. Amen. Satan got to first Eve before Adam could get to her. But God got to the second Eve before Satan could ever get to you. And where were you? Amen, Job. Before the foundation of the world, when morning stars sang for glory, I was up there getting my commission. Before the foundation of the world, it said, "You will go down to this earth and you will be an overcoming son in Leodysia." And no matter what Satan tries to do in this dark age, he cannot change what God has done in eternity when he called you before the foundation of the world and predestinated you to be a son or daughter of God. Amen. It looked like he could have sent somebody else, but brother Ryan, he can't send somebody else. Amen. Brother Brandham said it looked like he could have sent another prophet, but he ordained Jonah. And Elijah wouldn't have done. Jeremiah wouldn't have done. Moses wouldn't have done. It was Jonah had to go to Nineveh. That's all there was to it. He commissioned him and told him to go. And when he says, "Go there, Jonah. Go to Nineveh." Nobody else can do that but Jonah. And when God tells you something, you've got to do it. See, we just might we just have to face up to it and go do it. And then he would say, "No one can take your place." And you're peculiarity. You say, "Why am I so weird, Brother Isaac? Join the club." Amen. He said, "You're a chosen generation, a holy priesthood, a priesthood, a peculiar people." [gasps] Amen. And we're a peculiar people, but we're a chosen people. Can you imagine, brother Brandon, when he was here on the earth and he was just wanted to go hunting with his friends and he would try to sight in his rifle and it would try to it had to hit the mark every single time or else he would sit there. And he said while all his other friends were out there happily hunting squirrels, he was leaning against that tree weeping because he couldn't get his gun to shoot in the same place every time. And he would say, "Lord, why am I like this? Why am I so strange? Why am I so peculiar? And a voice would speak out, I made you that way for a reason. Because I needed you to be accurate. Because when you got up behind that pulpit, I needed you to be on the mark every time. And sometimes you say, "Why am I so peculiar, Brother Isaac? Why am I so strange? I wish that God would take this away from me." But he said, "I've chose you in your peculiarities. I made you that way for a purpose. Because I need you. Amen. For a certain reason to be that way. Amen. Because I filtered you from before the foundation of the world. Amen. To be that way. You say, "Amen." Brother Brandon, many there's quotes where he talk about since you were a little kid, there was something always different about you. Amen. You were always different than the other children. There was something in you that always hungered after God. And sometimes, Amen. A son is always a son. Sometimes it might take him a a while to recognize he is a son. Amen. But that seed always laid inside of you and that's what made you different before the foundation of the world because God was filtering you from before the foundation of the world to be an overcomer in this day. Amen. Just like when God was forming Gideon's army to go down and conquer, I believe it was maybe the Midianites. Amen. He said, "We've got too many in this army." Amen. Because if we go down now, they'll say that because your great army you have conquered and it will take away from the glory of God. So we've got to have some tests to narrow down your army. So he said, [snorts] "Those that are afraid, you should just leave." And 10,000 got up and left. And then he said, "Those that drink their water, Amen, bending down will have to go." Because it showed that they were used to prostrating themselves down before idols and they couldn't be fit for Gideon's army. And they were left with a very small number that would be the overcomers in that army. I mean, look at Elijah who said there's [snorts] 700 just like you. And they were the 700 that would not bow their knee to that bell religion in that day because God was filtering out a mean all of the others and saying you will be the ones that will overcome. And didn't he do it in this day? Amen. When God sent a message, it had three pulls. And he sent a first test and he sent a second test. Amen. And there was multitudes that gathered around those healing campaigns and around those supernatural signs. Amen. to discern the hearts. But when brother Brandon began to preach the opening of the word onto the people, the crowds begin to scatter away by multitudes. But you didn't leave. Amen. You remained because it was that third pole that was hooking your heart. That's what attracted that rainbow trout. That's what attracted this pride. Amen. Those first two poles were wonderful. But when that word begin to open, it begin to hook you for rapture saying, I have filtered you to receive this message. I have filtered you, amen, to become a part of the rapture that's taking place in this age. Amen. God called you, informed you, amen, to not bow, amen, to the religions of this world, but to stand for him. You say, "Why am I still here, Brother Isaac?" Amen. I I'm just here because daddy's here. I'm just here because mom is here. Amen. Maybe not. Amen. Maybe it's deeper than that. Maybe there's something inside of you that's holding you. I I I I grew up in a message church. I I even went to a message school. Amen. And I'll say this that growing up in the message ain't enough. Just going to a message school isn't enough. And I I it's sad to say it and I pray God have mercy. But I can look back and a a good percentage of the people that I went to school with are no longer serving the Lord today. Amen. And I say, "God, why am I still here? Why am I still here, Lord?" But there was something inside. Amen. That would go beyond and press through and would take, Amen. take you to a reality, take you to that place where you would meet a living God. I remember there's times, brother Ryan, where I I'd sit there and years ago and I was I was I was struggling through that I was trying to break through that sound barrier and get to that place with God where I was settled. And there was times in my life where I didn't know if I was going in the rapture or not. I didn't know if I was a son or not. But there was something in my heart that said, "Oh God, I don't know if this is for me or not, but to whom would I go? Where else would I go? This message alone is my hope. This message alone has the words of eternal life. And I said, "Oh God, I've got nowhere else to go." Amen. So, I'm going to stay with you like Elisha with Elijah. Amen. I will not leave you. I will not take my eyes off you. Amen. Because I know that the message dwells in you and I have no other hope. Amen. I will not stay back. Amen. I will not take my eyes off this word because it's my only hope. Oh, when God began to restore and bring me into that place of settleness. Amen. Because there was something in me. I said, I've got nowhere else to go. I could go to the world, but it's got nothing for me. I could go to religion, but it's got nothing that can satisfy the gene seed that dwells in the son or daughter of God. Oh, that's why it kept pushing through the muck. And eventually, daybreak begin to shine upon that seed of my life. And the clouds begin to roll away as I begin to see, oh God, that's what was always different about me. Amen. It's not because I wasn't a son. It's because I was a son. That's why I had so many battles. That's why I had to fight through so many things. Because it was God's calling bringing you, saying, "I have called you and filtered you." Amen. For this hour. My my goodness. But to [snorts] think about it, friends, Joshua, he was commissioned for the job. And all of a sudden, he began to hear these great words, "As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee." And brother Brandham said, "What a consolation. What a hope." Because Moses made mistakes. Moses failed many times. And Joshua knew that if God was with Moses and his mistakes, then he's going to be with me and my mistakes. Amen. Because brother Bram tells about that man at that flower company that said, "I don't need an eraser. I don't make any mistakes." They said, "Well, then you're not going to be a good worker here." And he won't be a good worker in the kingdom of God either because brother Brandham said that God don't hold you responsible for your mistakes. He holds you responsible for your willful sin. He that sins willfully after he has received the knowledge of the truth. But a man that's going to do something is going to blunder. He's going to fall. He's going to make mistakes. But if he's really divinely called and God is in his heart, he will rise again. How many times did brother Brandon pray that forgive me, Lord, and try me one more time. I'll be yours if you'll be mine. If I fall or if I fail, let me rise and try again. Because any son or daughter of God that ever tries to do something for God will fall and we'll make mistakes. But he said mistakes are not willful sin. Willful sin belongs to those who haven't been baptized into the body yet, but to those that are in the body. I mean, you're going to make mistakes. You're going to fall down. I mean, you're going to make mistakes, but mistakes does not change who you are. Just like he said, it's like that eagle. He might come down to that to that ground. He might get caught in that cage. Amen. But backsliding does not change his species. He's an eagle when he's in the sky. And he's an eagle when he's in the cage. He's an eagle when he's on the ground. And you might backslide. You might make mistakes. But as long as you're in the path of duty, Brother Brandon said, "God is obligated to you as long as you're in the path of duty." Sometimes you might feel like Peter. He said, "Lord, save me or I'll perish." He was desperate, but he was in the path of duty. And God reached down and picked him up out of the waves. and he walked on the waves again. And he said, "It's the same for you. You might be desperate. You might be crying out, Lord, save me or I'll perish. But if you're in the path of duty, God is obligated to reach down and lift you up out of the muck that you are in." Amen. To lose a battle is not to lose the war. And mistakes do not change the commentary of your life. Moses was elected and he failed in his commission. What was Moses's mistakes? He smoked the rock in the wilderness twice when he shouldn't have. He had a temper and he broke the commandments. But in spite of all of his failure, God still had his hand upon him. David was a man after God's own heart and committed adultery. Paul was guilty of stoning Stephen who was a a a a deacon, a man of God. But yet Paul could sit down there and pen. Maybe while tears were running down his eyes, brother Bram said that experience never left him. But he could sit down there and write forgetting the things which are behind. I'll press towards the mark of the prize. I mean, I will not live in my mistakes. I will not live in my past. I've met a God. I've got my life under a blood. And I'll forget those things which are behind. And I'll press towards the mark of the prize. Amen. Sometimes we need a laying aside service, a laying aside of the weights, a laying aside of the things which are under the blood. [gasps] I mean, you've heard the story maybe, but uh there was a lady in the prayer line in Brother Man's meeting one time and she had been smoking cigarettes and she heard somebody get called out for smoking cigarettes and she didn't want that to be her. So, she quickly stepped out of the line and just quickly bowed her head and repented. And when she got up in that line, brother Brandon couldn't call it out because it was under the blood. And then brother Brandon couldn't even see it because God could no longer see it. And if you put a sin underneath the blood, it's in the sea of forgetfulness. And there is no condemnation to those which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. Oh, under the blood of bulls and goats, you would have to go back every year and make penance again because it's partial remission. Because without the blood, there's no remission of sins. But brother Ryan, you know, when they speak about cancer, there's partial remission and complete total remission. And you can be in partial remission and that cancer can keep coming back. But if you ever get in total remission, I mean, you are healed. The cancer is gone. And under the blood of bulls and goats, we had partial remission. But under the blood that Jesus shed on Calvary, it is total complete remission. The sins are in the blood. You are justified as though you've never done it in the first place. You are the pure spotless. Amen. Amen. Pure and and holy bride of Jesus Christ. Abraham doubted God and lied about his wife. But when his divine commentary was written, it said he staggered not at the promise of God and was strong in faith giving glory to God. He said it shows who wrote the Bible. &gt;&gt; It shows that this Bible was not written by man. Because would Jacob write that he was a deceiver? Would Abraham write that he lied? Would Moses write about his mistakes? Would David write about his mistakes? Would a man write and expose his own self? He said it shows that God wrote the Bible because they could write all of their mistakes, but somewhere there in the middle of the Bible, there would come a split between the Old Testament and the New Testament. And it would turn over to a new covenant. And under that covenant, under that blood, it would come a Hebrews 11 that would say Noah, a hero of the faith. Abraham, a hero of the faith. Sarah who laughed at the promise is a hero of the faith. David, amen, these mighty men are Amen that made these mistakes are heroes of the faith. Oh, and brother Brandham, he lied and he caused his wife to lie. [gasps and sighs] Amen. You say the seventh angel messenger, he lied and caused his he caused his wife to lie. Amen. But he would say, "I hope my commentary is written like that." Amen. that it wouldn't be my mistakes, but God wouldn't understand the intentions of my heart. [laughter] And he would write my commentary like that. And oh, I believe it will be written like that. But what about me and you, friends? What about a scripture that says that you must be perfect? You must be holy and without blemish. How could you do it when you're full of mistakes? But he said, "I'm not depending upon your ability." Amen. But you will accomplish it only through the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. You will accomplish it only through my grace that's made you worthy. Amen. In the church age book, it says in Revelations 3:1, "He that hath the seven spirits of God in the seven stars." Brother Brandham said that he that hath shows that they're the Lord's. &gt;&gt; He said, "These are mine, saith the Lord." He said, "The seven spiritfilled messengers are the Lords. They may be repudiated. They may be questioned. Indeed, to human minds, they may not even seem to qualify. Nevertheless, they are the messengers for their age." And he said, "God used an Abraham. He lied. He used a Moses. He rebelled. He a Jonah, he disobeyed. A Samson, he sinned. A David, he murdered. He used a Joshua and a Joseph. And this, oh my, this is a refrigerator quote right here. He said, "And those with severe blemishes far outnumber those whose history seemed to be perfect. All were and are his." Oh my. Amen. Glory to the living God. Amen. That he said those with severe blemishes outnumber those. Amen. Who would seem perfect in the eyes of man. Amen. Man would choose Matias, but God would choose Paul. Amen. Man would look upon you and man would have never chose you. Amen. But thank God we're not depending upon man, but God could look down and say, "You might have made a lot of mistakes. Your past might be riddled with failures." Amen. But I've looked past that. Amen. Oh my. Brother Brandon would say about Sarah. He says, "She laughed at the promise when Melzdc was discerning and giving his message to Abraham." And brother Brandon would stand in a sermon one day, and I can get you the quote. I'll paraphrase it, but he was saying, "You may you may be questioning what I'm speaking right now, but I can see farther than that you're going to believe it one of these days." Amen. Man could look upon you and say, "You're never going to see it. You're never going to believe it." But a prophet could pick it up and say, "Just like Sarah laughed at the promise. You may not see it yet, but if you are his, you will come to the truth one of these days. Because God will not set you aside just because of your mistakes. But if he called you, he'll see you through to the finish line. If he predestinated you, then brother or sister, I don't care and mean how many devils you have to fight through to get there. You will make it to the finish line because God called you in your blemishes and he said, "I'll make my strength known through your weakness." Paul sought the Lord three times about his blemishes. You see, today we try to cover up our blemishes with makeup and all this and all that. Amen. That's what the world tries to do. But God says, "No, I chose you in your blemishes. I chose you in those failures. I chose you in that." And he said, "Amen. Much rather will I glory in my infirmities that the strength of God may be made perfect in my weakness." And brother Brandham speaks and compares his own life to that. And he says, you know, this tension that you have. He said, there's I I battled this tension. And I begin to think, my what would the Christian life be without tension anyway? I mean, people try to make the Christian walk as if you're never going to be nervous. You're never going to have any tension. You're never going to have a trial. And brother Brandham said, if that was the case, you would just be like a ragd doll. You would just sit there and do nothing. But tension actually keeps you in line. But he said, "I consulted the Lord about it." And he he he cried out to the Lord to take that tension away. He said how it bothered him so much that he would ask the Lord to take it away. And then he begins to par compare it to Paul. [gasps] And he said, "The Lord didn't take it away, but he said, [snorts] "It will never it will never scare you again. It will never bother you again." And brother Brandham said, "All right, Lord." Amen. He could have just as easily taken it away, but he didn't take it away. But he said, "You'll never fear it again." He said, "So it's there. I can feel it. I know it's there, but it doesn't scare me anymore." I mean, because there's sometimes there's things in your life, there's tensions, there's stresses that you go through, and you say, "Lord, take it away." [gasps] And he said, "No, I've put it there for a reason. It's to keep you in check. It's to be sure that you're always, amen, checking your life to make sure you're in line with the word. But you don't need to fear it. There's nothing wrong. Amen. Sometimes blackness comes over your life and you feel the pressure. Amen. But there was a sister that had a dream one time that she was walking in white sands and darkness was over her head. And she said, "Now I'm nervous. My family is nervous. We're all nervous." and brother Brandham discerned it and say there's nothing wrong with you sister. The white sands show that you're walking in purity and righteousness. The blackness just is it's just that you become nervous but there's nothing actually wrong. I mean that's how it is many times. Satan will try to lie on you and make you nervous and scared and he's saying there's nothing wrong. I mean it's just things that have come against you to mold you and shape you. Oh, he'll try to lie to you and and tell you you're never going to make it. He'll try to lie and say your children are never going to make it. But we have a promise. Believe on the Lord and I and thy house shall be saved. That the same faith that saved you can save your children. And brother Bram said, one of the most powerful weapons that the church has is the power of committ. That you can commit it into the hands of God and you can stop worrying about it. Because if it's too big for God to handle, what makes you think that you can handle it? So instead of staying up all night, amen, fearing about what's going to happen, if you're going to stay up, stay up praying to a God that can change the situation. If you're going to stay up, stay up committing things into the hands of a God who's able to take care of your children. And when he gave them to you and you dedicated them back unto him as a baby and don't you think that his hands are strong enough to take them through the other side? And when that's why Jockabed had to put Moses in the basket and put him in the river and put it in the Lord's hands, but she could say that the one who gave it to me can see him through to the other side. And there was angels guiding them through every crocodile, through every whirlpool. And I say to the believing mothers this morning, amen, we serve a God who can dispatch angels. Amen. To guide your children through every trial, through every journey, through every hard time and say because of your faith. Amen. You'll have them on the other side. because of your faith. Not because I mean you're somebody special, but because you're a son of God that believes the word of God, your faith can reach out and send an angel by the way of your child and restore them back to the position that they're supposed to be in. Oh my, I say I'm too weak, brother Isaac. Amen. I I'm unable. Amen. But Satan's lies are not the truth over your life. God's word is the truth over your life. And the truth has come to set you free. And you can walk a long time in darkness thinking that there's something wrong with you. But when the truth comes, it exposes the enemy and sets the children of God free. That's why Brother Brandham can discern. There's nothing wrong with you. You're not nervous. It's just the time of life that you're going through. Amen. Or or it's just the it's just it's just the the the the the levels in your body are all up and down right now because of what you're going through. But there's nothing wrong. Amen. It's just a It's just a season. It's just a season, but it's not your identity. It's not who you are. And as the truth begin to expose, like the woman could say that someone told me I had five devils or someone told me I had seven devils and brother Brandham could simply come and begin to expose those spirits and say, "They lied on you. You're not a witch. You're not a witch. It's just a nervousness. There's nothing wrong." And as that truth begins to expose that spirit, the truth sets you free to re to realize that you are already free. He which the son is made free is free indeed. Amen. And this message has come to blow the gospel trumpet to let us know, amen, that we are free indeed. That the blood has already been shed at the rising of the sun. The emancipation proclamation has been declared. Amen. that he which the son has made free is already free. Amen. You don't have to wait another day. Amen. But the blood is already shed. Amen. Like that old Johnny Crow, he said he thought he was tied up, but he wasn't tied up any longer. And brother Brandon would say, "Jesus Christ untied you at Calvary." Amen. You say, "I'm waiting for my day where I'm going to get untied." I say, "You're already on tied by the blood of Jesus Christ." But sometimes it takes the truth to come over years and declare unto you that you are free. You are free to worship. You are free to praise. You are free to dance. You are free to enjoy. You are free to re be restored in the joy of your salvation. You are free to receive the Holy Ghost. Amen. Don't let the lies of the devil try to tell you, Amen, that you cannot possess this land. Joshua, you have been called to possess this land. Amen. It maybe there's a shamguard this morning that's just got enough righteous indignation in them to say, "I'm tired of the devil robbing my family of their food. I'm tired of the devil robbing my children of their blessings. I'm ready to pull my sword and say, Satan, it's enough." A mean that it stops here. It stops today. I mean, I'm ready to get my joy back. Oh my. You say, "I'm too weak." I've seen a lot of people that are too strong for this message, too strong to lay down their opinions, too strong to humble themselves to this vindicated word. But I haven't met anybody to this day that was too weak for this message. I've never met anybody that was too weak for this message because that's who this message came for. Those that are well have no need of a doctor. But when Jesus came on the earth, he said, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me. I've come to bind up the brokenhearted. I've come to preach good tidings to the meek. I've come to proclaim liberty to the captives and to open the prison to them that are bound." That's what this message came for. It came for the weak. It came for the rejected. It came for those who said, "I'm not good enough." But brother Bram said if you're like an eagle that's in the cage locked up, he said God's calling opens the door to let you out. And so if God is calling at your heart this morning, that is the very act that has opened the door to let you out, he's just saying, "Now you've just got to step out of the cage. Now you've just got to act on the promise. Now you've just got to act on the commission that I've called you to. Because there comes a time in your life where you have to separate your feelings from your faith. Because if you've been commissioned to do something, you may not always feel like you're able to do it. But he said, "Brother Brandon," it's a quote. He said, "There's got to be a time when you've got to separate yourself between your feelings and your faith." And he said, "That's the time it is tonight." And when Noah, when he was commissioned to build an ark, before he ever saw rain, he had to separate from all of that and go to build an ark. &gt;&gt; Moses, even though he had the the the past of of his mistakes haunting over his life, he had to separate himself from that and say, "But no, God's commissioned me. I've met him. That's behind me now. And I've been commissioned to go take these children out of this land." And he had to act on his commission. Hey, we've been commissioned to go on the world and preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. But one of those mornings back in November, we had to act on that and get in that airplane and go over to Peru and get bit up by a bunch of bugs and a bunch of fleas and chiggers and act on the commission. And it it wasn't always easy. There was some obstacles we had to get through. But when you know that God's commissioned you to do something, then you're not looking at the obstacles. You're not looking at the feelings, but you're looking at the commission. Amen. And if God has promised you healing and you've come up and you've been prayed for. Amen. Then that is Amen. That was the commission was already fulfilled. They shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover. Now it's your time to act on the commission. If God has promised you the Holy Ghost and you've repent and been baptized, now you go to acting on the commission and you go to thanking him for the promise. Amen. And saying, "Lord, I've met your requirements. I know it's for me and I'm going to start acting because brother Brandham told us you act first and then you see the miracle. Amen. First you start acting and then you see the miracle. You say I'm waiting for the miracle. Amen. But this is the time where you start acting on the commission and then the miracle will follow. Amen. Peter would say Lord if that's you bid me come out on the water. And then the Lord said it's me come. And then Peter had to act on that and step out by faith onto that water. Amen. And to fulfill, Amen. the call to come out on the water. And brother Brandham said, "Lord, if it's you, bid me come to you on the water." He said, "Come on." He said, "Now that's the same as James 5:14 and the same as Mark 16. The same God that said it said, "Come on." Amen. You know, you know very well the testimonies. There was a man by the name of John Ryan who went through the prayer line and said, "Brother Brandon, I want to be prayed for my eyes that they would be healed." And he said, "Okay, I'll pray for you." And then he came back later and said, "Something's wrong. You said I was healed." And he said, "Well, you told me you believed." And so he needed to give him something to say. So he gave him something to say. And he went out and he began to confessing and acting on his commission. Extra, extra, read all about it. By his stripes, I am healed. Extra, extra, read all about it. By his stripes, I am healed. And it wasn't very many days later, amen, that he was in a barber chair. Amen. Acting on his commission when his eyes became open and the miracle followed the action and he was completely and totally healed. Oh, I mean, because it comes by acting. Amen. Back in Arkansas years ago when brother Wayne was still living there, there was a a a sister by the name of Sister Dena and she was Dena Nelson and she had a stroke and it had paralyzed I think uh maybe the right side of her body and she had come up in a in in a prayer service that morning. I believe it was Sunday morning and she had asked Brother Wayne to pray for her that she would be healed of this this paralysis. And so he prayed the prayer of faith over her and she and she went rejoicing and confessing and they had service again that evening and she came back up and and she was coming back up for prayer dragging that leg and that crippled arm. And brother Wayne said, "Oh, I guess she's coming back up to get prayed for that arm and that leg again." And she began to begin to talk to Brother Wayne. She said, "No, I didn't come up for prayer. I came to testify of my healing." And he said, "Brother Wayne said, I saw it with my own eyes. That crippled arm reached out and took a hold of that microphone and she didn't even have time to testify because she went to dancing around that building because the very action of confessing the promise brought the promise to fulfillment in her life. Amen. If you just kept acting on the commission, I mean, the miracle was coming down the road. Amen. If you walk in the commission, before long you'll be walking in the fulfillment. You know, brother Brandham was promised to Joseph and and when he had his next daughter, everyone was making fun of him. Oh, Josephine, Josephine, is this your I thought it was right every time, Billy. Amen. Is this your This is a girl. Amen. And God promised you a boy, but he just kept acting on the commission. Before he knew it is, Joseph came. Amen. Just like Abraham had to act on the commission for Isaac and Ishmael came first. But once they got past the obstacles and just kept acting on the commission, it wasn't long before Isaac, the promised sane son, came on the scene. Oh, I encourage you as believing sons or daughters of God. If you've got need of a miracle this morning and you've come and acted on the commission and you've put it before the Lord, now is the season of acting on the commission. Now is the season of testifying. Now is a season of confessing. It's not lying. It's acting on the commission because we serve a God who is a high priest of our confession. And he is not here. Amen. To be a high priest of our mumbling and and grumbling and complaining. Amen. That is the devil's language. We should never speak the devil's language. But if you confess these promises, he is a high priest to act upon the confession of those promises and to bring them to pass. That's what he told Joshua. this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth. He said he didn't say his hand. He said his mouth. Because the message of Moses was meant to come in the mouth of Joshua and he was meant to speak the message. Amen. Over the situation despite the obstacles he say, "Oh, I mean, we need the sun to stay up a little longer. So, son, stand still." Amen. It may not look like it's going to work out. The Red Sea may be closing in on the situation, but why cry unto me, Moses? Speak and go forward. Put the book in your mouth and go to confessing over the situation. You say, "So and so tried that and they failed." What's that got to do with you? I don't care if a thousand people tried and fail. If it's in this Bible, it belongs in your mouth as a positive confession. And the God that you serve can bring it to pass and make it, Amen. come to pass in his right time. Amen. We've been commissioned, church. We've been commissioned for this job. We've been commissioned to possess this land. He told Joshua, "You're going to pass by Mount Sier." And he said his army had already tasted of blood. So it would he had to make sure that they didn't go and get caught up in fighting in that land because that wasn't where they were meant to stay. And he said how that Pentecostals have already tasted of organization and Mount Si was Esau's mountain and that was Esau's inheritance. That was where the Moabites dwelt. That was where those dwelt that were not under Joshua's ministry. Amen. And that was their inheritance. But Joshua's inheritance laid beyond the river and Jacob's mountain across the Jordan. That's where his inheritance laid. And brother Brandham talked about how all these churches, he said, "Don't fuss with them. Don't stew with them." Amen. You can't make them all see it. If they were predestinated, if they were commissioned to go over, they would go. Amen. But that's not their inheritance. But he said, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." And brother Brandon would cry out, "If there's a deep calling into the deep in your heart, it shows that there's more for you. Your inheritance lays beyond the river. Just joining a church wasn't enough for you." Amen. Just Amen. Just being religious wasn't enough for you. But there was something in you saying, "As for me and my house, we will not drive down our stakes until we get beyond the Jordan into the promised land." And I say if there's a deep calling to the deep in your heart this morning, don't put down your stakes, friends. Amen. Never settle for less than the deep calling in your heart. But if there's still a hunger in your heart, I say there's more land to possess and it's time to put on your walking shoes and start possessing the land of the promise of this message. Amen. Footprints mean possession. Amen. You've stood still long enough, friends. Amen. It's time to put on your shoes and go to possessing your promise. It's time to put this word in our mouth. Oh my. Amen. Amen. We're not here to stand still. We're not here to look backwards. We're here to look forwards and say, "Lord, I thank you for what you did for me last year." Amen. Maybe you haven't been standing still. Maybe you've been moving forward. But I say, keep walking. Keep moving in the promises. This is a new year. I say, God, may we possess every promise. May this be a year where our children come home. May this be a year where you are, Amen, in the greatest revival you've ever been in. Not a revival that starts one day and ends the next. I'm talking about a revival where the revelation of this word picks you up and takes you into realms that you've never been in before. I mean, it's not a it's a non-ending revival. I mean, I believe God still sends revival to hungry hearts. And I believe if you're hungry for more of God, I believe if you're thirsty, amen, for more of the realities of God, for more of the Holy Ghost, I believe it's here this morning saying, "Just put one foot in front of the other and I'll lead you." [gasps] Oh, I've prayed it to the Lord many times. Lord, take me by the hand and lead me through this message. Lord, I can't understand it, but I know if I'm holding your hand, I mean, you'll lead me into those places. You'll lead me into the revelation. and you'll lead me into the revival. You'll lead me into that which my soul longs uh uh longs for, my soul thirsts after. Oh God, it's for me. I want to possess my land. I want to possess my inheritance, friends. I don't know about you, but I want to act on my commission. I want to possess everything that this message said could be mine. Amen. Because we are under a commission. Don't you add or take away from one thing which Moses said. Don't turn to the right or turn to the left. You're going to come into critics. You're going to come into obstacles. You're going to come into all kinds of things. But we are under a commission. Amen. That everything that is lays in this word. Amen. Is our inheritance. If he said to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I'm under a commission. If he said to preach the message in power and demonstration, I'm under a commission. If he said to lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover, I don't know what the rest of the world's going to do, but I'm under a commission. Amen. But it didn't stop there. But we've been commissioned to worship him. Did not the Bible say, "Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise him in the dance. Praise him in the timber. Praise him on the organ." There you go, brother Will. Praise him on the music. Praise him on the instruments. Praise him on the symbols. But whatever you do, let everything that hath breath praise the Lord because you are under a commission not just to preach in power and demonstration. But we serve a God who's worthy to be worshiped in power and demonstration. Oh, what are you going to do? I think I'll throw up my hands. I've never lost my praise, brother. I've been through some battles and I believe that there is some veterans. I don't care if you're the youngest or the oldest. You're going through some battles. Amen. But what are you going to do? Amen. Just because you're going through an obstacle that has nothing to do with the promise. This land still belongs to you. You might have lost some good friends along the way. You might have had some friends that said this message is nothing. I'm going to walk away from it. But what's that have to do with you? I think it's time to throw up our hands and start praising the Lord. I think it's time to say, "Satan, you don't have enough." But I never lost my praise. I never lost my joy. I never lost my peace. If you could have got me, you would have got me. But I was commissioned, Amen, to finish this thing out. Oh, brother Brandham ran. He fulfilled his commission. But he sent back a mantle. Amen. Almighty God poured out the spirit upon the church of the living God and said, "Amen, it's time to finish this thing. It's time to fulfill this thing." Oh, can you imagine what it would have been like that day that Elisha put on that mantle for the first time? So, oh, it's a perfect fit. He didn't have to alter it to fit him. Neither do we have to alter the message to fit us. But that's why God sends you through tests and trials because he's altering you to fit this message. And Elisha begin to strike that mantle and say, "Where is the God of Elijah? Where is the power of God? I know he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh, and sometimes it's time to put on the mantle. You try on outfits before church and you say, "Oh, this one don't look right. This one don't look right." But then you put on that one, say, "Oh my, that one looks just right. It's becoming of you. It looks good on you. [sighs and gasps] And you may have tried on depression. You may have tried on joy. But you cannot fulfill this commission in the devil's garments. But it's time that you take off that old coat. It's time that you take off that old spirit of heaviness. And God said, "I've got a garment of praise for you. I've got a new garment for you." Because if you're going to walk this walk, you're going to have to wear the garments that I've commissioned you to walk in. And I'll give you the oil of joy for heaviness. I'll give you the garment of praise for heaviness. I'll give you beauty for ashes. And it's time like that old armor boy story. It's time where she had to take off the rags of her old life and put on that wedding garment because she was ready to meet her bridegroom. And our messenger came and his commission is said, "Oh God, would you crown my ministry with this that I'll be able to dress your bride in the garments of this word and I'll be able to introduce the Messiah, behold the lamb of God." And he fulfilled his commission. He gave us a garment of his word. You know, he would stand in prayer lines and he would put their shoes next to them and say, "If I would give my shoes, I would, but it won't fit. If I could give them my coat, I would, but it won't fit." But he gave us the message of the hour. And he gave us something that fits. Oh, and it's time that we put on the word and say, "Oh, God, I've worn that old garment long enough. It's time to put on the garments of your word that said you never did it in the first place. I've called you to be an overcomer by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony. I've called you to wear this message and be the bride that I've called you to be because I have filtered you for the job. Would you stand to your feet this morning? You've been commissioned to finish this thing. Eve was commissioned to multiply and replenish the earth, but she failed in her commission. And sometimes we think that that commission is just to bear natural children. But brother Bam said that's not the commission. He said in order to multiply and replenish they would have to stay alive. That's why this bride is fulfilling the comm commission that Eve failed to do. Because when this bride brings forth word children they can never die. And that is the fulfillment of the commission multiply and replenish the earth. Because it's word children, eternal children, brideborn word children on this word are fulfilling that commission. Amen. We've been called to fulfill it. Friends, Moses didn't believe in a halfway religion, but he believed in going all the way. He said, "We'll not leave a hoof behind. We'll not leave even the cattle behind. We'll not leave our children behind." He did not believe in a sofa so far religion. Oh, and it's time, friends, that we lay aside the weight. It's time that we take off those old garments and say, "Oh, God, let me run this race with patience that's set before me, forgetting those things which are behind because it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness." You know, when brother Brandon preached that message, it becomes us to fulfill our righteousness. His mother was laying in the hospital dying. And he said, "The devil's been trying to get me out of this pulpit all morning because my mother's laying there dying, but I've got something to do. It's becoming to me to fulfill my position." And he stayed there. And he came back that night and preached [music] a message comfort her and said, "She doesn't know it, but God kept her alive while I was preaching." That's powerful, friends. If you just stay in your position, [music] the devil's trying to get you to give up. The devil's trying to get you to throw in the towel. The devil's trying to get you to say, "If you just let down on this [music] word, I'll take it easier on your children. If you just don't if you just don't pray as much, if you don't play those tapes in your house, I won't fight you so much. It's a lie in the pits of hell trying to get you out of your position, but it becometh you to fulfill all righteousness. And if you are obedient to his commission, he will be obedient to his promise to you. Isn't that what he told brother Brandon up though up there in that woods when [music] he didn't shoot those deer? He said, "Because you have kept your promise to me, I will keep my promise to you. I will never leave you nor forsake you. If you stay in your position, he'll take care of your children. He'll take care of your family. He'll take care of your finances. He'll take care of everything you have need of. But it requires us to fulfill our commission. as we bow our heads and close our eyes. I was looking at one time because I I I like to read books and [music] sometimes you're coming down to the end of that book and there's some loose ends and you don't know how that book's going to come out. You say, "How's how's [music] all these strands of this plot going to come together?" But there's a term in literature and it's called day numan. And the de numan of literature is the the final scenes, [music] the closing scenes of a of a of a play or of a book. And it's [music] where the writer has all of the all of the strands, all of the loose ends of the story come together in that final scene sometimes. And sometimes when you're reading that book, [music] you come and you realize that you're coming to the end of something. The words don't go to the end of the page. And you say, "My, is this the end of the book? How's it all going to come together?" And then you turn that page over and you say, "Ah, there's a final chapter." And you begin to read that final chapter and it all begins to come together. And you may feel like you're at the end of your book, but as God begins to turn over that page, said, "There's another chapter in this book. I'm going to tie the loose ends together." Just like this message came to tie the loose [music] ends of our lives together. Sometimes you question say, "Brother Isaac, have I been commissioned? Am I sufficient for the job?" Brother Brandham asked that one time. He said, "The commission [music] is pray for the sick." The question is insufficient for the job. But the answer was, [music] "This is the means of your peculiar birth and life. For this reason, you were born to fulfill his commission." You say, "Brother Isaac, I feel insufficient this morning. I've made so many mistakes. I'm such an odd, [music] peculiar person. But I say maybe this is the means of your peculiar birth in life. Maybe it's that God has called you for such a time as this. Oh, maybe it's time to lay aside the weights. Say, Lord, if you've called me, then I'm going to trust you. [music] If you've called me, Lord, then I believe I may not be sufficient, but in you I'm sufficient. Amen. If you've got to wait this morning, I [music] say, why don't we lay it aside this morning? Why don't we forget the things which are behind us? Sometimes in the path of duty, you pick up things, but you're [music] not meant to carry them. You're not meant to walk this walk with them. You're meant to lay them aside. Brother Brandham picked up things. Brother Brandham, when the people weren't receiving his message, he felt a complex begin [music] to come in his life that the people weren't hearing his message. And he said, "It's just so easy to build up a complex. It's [music] just so easy." And he would ask the people to pray for me. He said, "Pray for me that God would restore what [music] I lost out there in that complex." Sometimes it's easy to pick up things. Sometimes it's easy to pick up weights. But you say, "God, if I'm called to fulfill this commission, I can't do it with these weights. I can't do it with these garments. [music] Lord, would you help me to lay it aside? Would you help me, Lord? I don't want this condemnation, Father. Wash me in your blood this morning. Lord, help me to walk free from it. Father, [music] help me to walk free from that burden. Help me to walk, Lord. Help me to trust you more, Lord. Help me to commit these burdens into your hands. For your yoke [music] is easy and your burden is light, Father. Oh, let's pray. [music] Lord Jesus, we thank you for your mercy this morning. We thank you for your grace this morning, Father. We trust you, Lord. You're always right on time. We don't always understand how you're going to work it out, but you're always right on time. I pray that this would be a year of laying aside of the weights. I pray this would be a year of laying aside of the things of the past, putting them under the blood. I pray this would be a year where we begin to put footprints in the land of your promises, Father, where we would begin to act on your commission, Lord. May this be a year, Father. Maybe there's been some acting for quite some time now. Lord, I believe the miracles are going to follow one of these days. We will see miracles. We are seeing miracles. Lord, would you give us the grace to press this battle? Father, if there's a garment of heaviness, if there's a spirit of heaviness in here this morning, Lord, may they lay it aside. And Lord, may you begin to sweep through their pew this morning. Give them a garment of praise. Give them the beauty for their ashes. Father, we don't go through trials in vain. Lord, [music] we don't go through hard nights in vain. Father, you're able to make beauty out of those ashes. We commit this assembly. I pray you bless them. I pray you bless their pastor. I pray you bless this church, Lord, as we run the last the last leg of this journey. May you [music] help us to fulfill the commission you called us to. We commit it in your hands in [music] Jesus name. Oh, amen. Could we sing that together this morning as we invite your pastor [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Oh my gratitude. Brother Steven, if you could come help [music] us, go. I could sing [singing] these songs as I often do, [music] but every song will stay and you never do. So I [music] throw up my hands and praise you [singing] again and again. Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. [singing] Hallelu. And I know it's not much. I'm nothing else fit for [music] a king [singing] except for a heart singing hallelu. Hallelujah. My words fall [music] short. I got nothing new. [music] How could I express my gratitude?

Lift up your voice cuz you've got [music] a lion inside of those lungs. Come on and praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So come on my soul, don't you get shy on me. Lift up your song cuz you've [music] got a light inside of those lungs. Get up and praise the Lord. [music] Throw up my hands and praise you again and again. That's all I have. Cuz all that I have is a hallelu [singing] [music] hallelujah. And I know it's not much, but I've nothing else [music] before a king [singing] except for a heart singing hallelu. Hallelujah. Let's hear from the musicians. [music] [music] [music] Anybody [music] [music] have a testimony like to praise the Lord or let him know or let us know what he's done for you? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Sister Naomi, praise the Lord. Sorry, brother Chase. [music] Hallelujah. Might be all you have. Might be all you have. That's I pray it's enough. I know it's enough. If that's all you got and you give him all, that's enough. Praise. [music] Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I just wanted to thank the Lord because that sermon was everything I needed. It was everything you've been struggling with. all the questions &gt;&gt; and I don't deserve it, but he's so good to me. I just wanted to give him praise and glory because he's real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows the prayers and the needs of our hearts and I just &gt;&gt; He's so good to me and he's worthy of all praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music] Praise the Lord. You have anything on your heart, Brother Ryan? one accord. Every praise, every praise is to our God. Praise [music] is to our God.

[music and singing] May let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful. Lord, I can say also Lord, as our sister's [music] testimony, I glean so much from the message this morning, which is your word, Lord, and nothing other than that. Sometimes, Lord, we just become forgetful and we need a reminder. And [music] Lord, where we needed reminding this morning, you gave us a reminder, Lord. And [music] we want to give you praise and honor and glory for that. Lord, we'd ask you to continue to strengthen our brother as he ministers this afternoon, Lord. Lord, give him a new [music] fresh anointing, Lord, as it comes upon them. And may you speak to the youth in a mighty way. May souls be touched as I know they were this morning. Lord, we were so blessed in your presence and we thank you for it, Lord, as we would go and travel. We'd ask you to be with us. Protect us, Lord. Place your ministering angels and protection around our vehicles and cars and wherever we would go, Lord. Just be with us and be with our brother and sister, Lord, that sang that beautiful song this morning. May their family, Lord, may you continue to bless them, Lord. May you continue to bless his ministry, Lord. May you just watch over them. Each member of the family, Lord, there. And we'd ask you to just continue to Lord, not only bless, but may it grow, Father, as you would grow in it, Lord. And may it prosper as you would be the one lifted up in this ministry. Bless the saints there at True Word, Lord. And we're so grateful. We just worship you now and we praise you, Father. May we be dismissed not from your presence, Lord, just from this building. And may you abide with us as we go. [music] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Lord bless you. Whatever. Nothing else can take your [music and singing] place. Oh, [singing] to feel the warmth of your embrace. [music] Help me find a way. Bring me back [singing] to you. [music] You're [singing] all I want. You're [singing] all that I've ever need. You're all I want. Help me know you are near. [singing] Lord [music] bless you. [music] Never [singing] let you go. Lay it [singing and music] all down again.

Help me find [singing] a way. Bring me back to you. You're my desire. [music] You're all I want. You're all that I've [music] ever needed. You're all I want. [music] Let me know you are near. [music] You're all [music] I [music] You're all I know. Know you are [music] know you are near. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; I speak Jesus. [music] I just want to speak the name of Jesus. Every dark addiction starts to break. Amen. Declaring [music and singing] there's hope and there's freedom. I speak Jesus. We speak his [music and singing] name. His name is power. Your name is healing [music] your name. Make his life. [music] Make every [singing] stronghold. Shine through the shadows. [music] Burn light of fire. Jesus. for fear [music and singing] and all anxiety. Oh, for every soul captive by depression. I speak [music] Jesus [singing] [music] life. Make every stronghold [music and singing] shine through the shadow. Burn like a fire [singing and music] [music] in the darkness of every [music] Jesus for my family has been [music] name Jesus. to us to man. [music] Jesus from the mountain. Jesus in the street. Jesus [singing] for my family. We know it's the name of Jesus. It's the name of Jesus. Oh, his name is power. His name is healing. [music] His name is my praise. Praise the Lord. [music] Shine through the shadow. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It's all right. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; sister said she didn't [music] mind if I just without giving details, it's very just it's just serious and it involves children and it's very serious. Brother Daryl, go ahead and come on up. And so I think with this brothers and sisters here, we could intercede for children that were that were uh and you just at times you go, I can't do nothing, Lord. I'm I'm at my wit's end. That psalm says, I'm at my wits end. And that scripture, as I mentioned a few a little while back, it means it's at the end of what you can do. It's at the end of all human ability. It's at the end of all human knowledge. And then the Bible says that those sailors, they cried out to God and he was there. [music] So we're at our wits end and we just cry out to God together with you brother and sister. Heavenly Father God, we lay our hands on this couple and Lord, as her own testimony would be, but this is these are saints of God, Lord, as [music] the brother said this morning that committal, Lord. And sometimes you got to get us to the end of the road, the end of our wit, the end of our knowledge, the end of our ability. We can't do anything. And so then we just we're all 100% reliant on you. We ask you to just take over completely. Not that we haven't believed that you've been in control from [music] the beginning. We do believe that. But Lord, we throw up our hands and give you we commit this situation with this family member, Lord, completely into your hands. And we ask for your help. We ask you to be Lord like with the Philippian jailer and Paul led him to you, Lord. And then he said now thy and thy house Lord we believe that promise if they were under the token if they would been to put Lord in the book of Exodus inside there and if the blood would have been sprinkled over the door then everyone in that house Lord was under that blood and under that token. And so brother and sister brother Daryl Lord and sister Jane here as they would stand here not before me. We stand here before you relying on you Lord. We commit it. We intercede with our brother and sister, Lord. We intercede with them. We know the struggles of raising a family, Lord, and the challenges there and the impossibilities seemingly [music] sometimes then how it affects our spirit and it affects Lord just the entire household. But Father, you're more than able. You're actually the head of this home. And as the head of this home, Lord, you take full control of this situation. We once again, Lord, we believe they've committed it to you, but we once again fully commit this situation into your hands. May you take full control, deal with this situation as you would have it, Lord. In the name of the Lord Jesus [music] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music]
