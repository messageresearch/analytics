Yeah, James is going to be my interpreter here because I don't speak fluent Navajo. Okay, we'll see if I can get through this. Today we gather in honor and remember my mom, Vivian G. Woody. So coincidentally, today is also the 30th anniversary of my Chase passing, her dad. Uh my mom was born on December 16th, 1956 in Winsow, Arizona to Lawrence and Louise Gordy. She was Kia Ani, the towering house clan, born for Twidditchen, the Bitterwater clan. Her maternal grandfathers were the milling goats clan and her paternal grandfathers were Hushkan the Yakafu or banana clan. Gordy, many ghost family. She was the fourth oldest of seven children. and anyone who knew her and knew she carried that role well. Strong, dependable, dependable and always looking out for others. She began high school in Tuba City at Tuba City High School and later transferred to Cookanino High School where she began or she played basketball and graduated in 1975. Even after high school, her love of basketball never faded. Some of my earliest memories are of traveling to basketball tournaments all over the reservation. While she played, I usually ended up watching the other players children. 1975. She had big hopes that I would love basketball as much as she did. So, in third grade, she signed me up for pee-wee basketball. It I spent the entire season running up and down the court with my hands in my pockets. [laughter] One day, I finally got the ball. I I remember all the kids running towards me and my mom yelling at me to pass it. I panicked and threw the ball, not really at anyone, just away from me. [laughter] Somehow it went in. I made a basket. It was the only basket I ever made in my basketball career. [laughter] And my mom was so excited. It also was the last time I ever played basketball. It just wasn't my thing. But I love that she never forced me to keep playing. She always knew when to encourage her children and when to let us be ourselves. In the 1980s, my mom worked as a prosecutor for the Western Navo Agency and later went into private practice. After that, she became the security supervisor at the Black Mesa coal mine. And she eventually moved our family to Phoenix for a few years before returning home to Cameron, Arizona. Thank you. Once back in Cameron, she was voted in as a Cameron chapter president, a role she took seriously, always working to serve her community. She had several jobs before being hired as a medical dispatcher for Sacred Mountain Medical Service. She dedicated 10 years there before retiring. Even in retirement, she continued to give up herself, traveling to Washington and California to help care for her grandchildren. for my mom also had a beautiful gift. She loved to sing. She sang often at funerals because people would request her. She travels so much for singing that my little sister Rebecca used to tease her and say she was on tour. But she didn't do it for recognition. She did it because she loved to sing and because she knew her voice brought comfort to people when they needed it most. above all else. She loved her family. She loved her grandchildren deeply and later her great-grandchildren bought her even more joy. She is survived by her four children, eight grandchildren, five great grandchildren, her two sisters, two brothers, and countless nieces and nephews who were all touched by her love. My mom will be missed every single day, but she will be remembered for her encouragement, her kindness, and her welcoming spirit. She made people feel seen, valued, and loved. Her legacy lives on in all of us. We miss her deeply, and we will love her forever. Uh we change kind of Robson church pastors. James. Thank you. God bless you this morning. &gt;&gt; I need to learn how to say that in Navajo. Praise the Lord. Um, I'm humbled uh to be here before you this morning &gt;&gt; and I I count it a great privilege. It's a great honor and soul for the family. Just thank you very much for this privilege. And so for the family and friends and the visitors, um we welcome you to our church. It's just a place where we worship the Lord and we want you to be uh to feel welcome here. We in our church here, we call everybody brother and sister. And we believe that if you claim the Lord Jesus as your savior, that you're our brother and you're our sister. And so this morning I might refer to sister Vivian. Um, Ananas when he met Paul, he complained to the Lord, "Forgive me. I'll give you plenty of time to translate it." He complained to the Lord. He said, "Lord, I this guy is a persecutor of the church." And the Lord told him, "I'm going to use him. He's been converted." And then when Ananas met Saul for the first time, he called him brother. Saul and so we call each other brother and sister. here. So, welcome brothers and sisters. We met by the way Lima said I get 30 minutes so that you get 30 minutes too. Okay. Okay. Um we met Sister Vivian July or August of last year or this year and um she she would sit right about there seventh row or so back there and she would worship the Lord and I didn't know who she was a lady who came in started coming to church and then I got a text it was September 5th you texted me at le said hey my mom's going to your church and I said well we only two Native Americans going to the church. So, it was obvious which one it was. I said, "Vivian?" She said, "Yeah, that's that's my mom." And it was a I've known Lima for probably 20 years. And so, it was a great privilege to fellowship or to worship with her mother here in our church. And you can tell a lot about a person uh by the way they worship in church. Some people come to church for the food. Some people come to church to see their friends or because they feel guilty if they don't go to church. Uh but Vivian, you could tell, was a what we would call a true worshipper. Uh when the songs were being sung, she raised her hand, she sang, she liked our old songs that we sing. When the word was going forth, she participated and enter in. And so she didn't come to church uh just to be seen or to have food or for a guilt reason. She came because she loved the Lord Jesus and she came to worship and and you could tell that And so I'd like to read out of the book of Job this morning, the 14th chapter. U we'll just read a few verses. I put the Navajo version up here. I don't know if it's a good version, but if you read Navajo, um there it is. And uh it might seem odd to read the scriptures at a funeral, but bear with me. I think we'll understand by the end. [snorts] The Bible says in Job 14, the first verse, we'll read the first and second verses. It says, "Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down. He fleth also as a shadow and continuth not seeing his days are determined. This is the fifth verse. The number of his months are with thee. Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass. That's verse one, two, and five. If you know the story of Job, he in this time in his life is in the midst of a major trial. He's lost all of his children. He's lost all of his economy, all his money. He's lost his wife. She says, "Why don't you curse God and die?" And then he lost his own health. He became sick and he was he was scraping boils. I don't know how you would say it in a different language, but he was just his body was uh sick. So he looks around and he says, "Man that's born a woman, few days and full of trouble." And then go ahead. &gt;&gt; And you could see why he would say that he's in the midst of trouble. And he then goes and he says a flower, a flower would come up and would flee and would can continue not and there'd be no hope for it. It's a flower. it it raised up and then it died. And then he makes an interesting statement. He doesn't stop there. I'm going to start preaching if I'm not careful. He makes Try to bear with me. Okay. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. So, he sees the flower and then in verse seven, he says there's hope of a tree if it be cut down that it'll rise again and the tender branch thereof will not cease. He says the root would die. The root would wax old in that tree and it but it but there's hope. There would be hope for a tree. In verse nine, he says, "Yet through the scent of water, it will bud." And and and basically that saying if it just could get a smell of water even though the tree had died, it was dead in the earth. The roots were, you know, leaves were gone. We look outside, all the leaves are gone. The tree is dead. He said, "But with a scent of water, it would bud again just by smelling water. And then in verse 10, he says this because Job looks around and he sees the flower dies. And it's kind of it's kind of interesting that as the flower dies in the fall, rain would come and that would be like the earth having a funeral for that flower that would die in the fall. And then he looks around and he sees the tree that would apparently die in the winter and the fall and and it's it's no leaves on it. It looks completely dead. If you looked at our trees out here on the property, they look dead. And but but Job says, "But there's hope." Like if they would just get a smell of water, they would rise again. And then he says, "Forgive me." And then he says this, "But man dies. He wastes away. He gives up the goat. And where is he? Where's he at? Verse 14, he says, "If a man die, shall he live again?" And he's crying out for like hope in his soul. He's like, "The tree dies and it comes back in the spring. The flower dies and it comes back in the spring. It would just smell water and it would come back." And verse 14, he says, "But a man dies, will he live again?" Go ahead. Praise the Lord. So, Job looks at the flower and the tree and he knows they didn't do anything to sin. They weren't born in sin like he was. they they were just natural in in their their growing and in their dying. But he looked at himself and the Bible says, David says this, "In sin did my mother conceive me." And then Paul would say, "We are born in sin and we're shaped in iniquity." So now, now Job looks at the flower. It's done nothing wrong. It dies, it comes back. He looks at the tree, it's done nothing wrong. It dies, it comes back. But he looks at himself and he sees a sinner because that's what he is. We all We all are, by the way. Did I just lose my mind? Your 30 minutes is up. Okay, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. But I'm trying to make a point here as concise as we can make it that Job had no hope, but he saw the flower with hope. But the flower had done nothing wrong. The tree had done nothing wrong. But Job was just born a sinner. He had lived a righteous life. There was nobody like him on the earth. But he still required a redeemer. He required an advocate. He required someone to to to intercede for him so that he could be raised up, so that he could resurrect. He's asking this question. Is there hope of a man? If a man dies, is there hope? If I die, do I have hope? Where's my hope at? If I die, I look at the flower. I look at the tree. I look at the bushes. They all have hope. I need somebody to be my advocate for me for that when I die, I can come back. Go ahead. So he this is chapter 14 and it takes him a while. He goes all the way to chapter 19 and he's you know when you're in a trial some of you have lost children. I know I was talking to I think one of sister Vivian's sisters. I don't know where she's at this morning. But she had lost children also. And it's a painful thing. And you want to know like is there a hope? Is there hope? Like is there hope? Will you see your children? Will you see Vivian again? And the only way you have hope and the only way you have hope this morning to be like that flower, that tree that would die, that would go into the earth and and and resurrect and live again. The only way is if you accept that there has been a redeemer that came for you that resurrected first and in him you can live again. That's it. So Job is five chapters goes by and he gets to chapter 19 and he makes this this powerful statement. We'll read it here. Forgive me before I read it. You can go ahead. He says this. He says this. For I know that my redeemer lives, that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, he knows this body is going to get it's just going to get eaten up by skin worms. whatever it would be. He says, "Nevertheless, though that would happen, though my body would be destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God. Chapter 19. And Job knows that through the scent of water, those natural things could live again. And he knows that through the sun s u n that life would come to botany that life would come to plants and those things. He knew that through the sun he could see that. And so he captures a revelation that God has sent an s o n over eternal life. And so he finally receives that as as the ultimatum presented to him that if you accept the son you will live again. And so life be life belongs to God and life belongs to God alone. And if you as as as a human being, as yourself, if you've allowed God's life to come into your life, If the Holy Spirit is in your soul and you die and you go down into the ground, how could you not rise again? It would be impossible that God could die. And if God is inside of you, how could you die? not die, you know, as as far as we're talking today, but how could you not resurrect again? How would it be possible that God could die? You could no more die than God could die if you've accepted his Holy Ghost into your heart. and no matter what I would say about Sister Vivian, uh, how it looked like she worshiped in church and how it looked like she was a Christian, her own testimony speaks for itself. her own testimony of how what we've heard already today, her own testimony of how he how she lived her life, how she was saved, how she accepted God's life. She accepted that no matter what I would say, her life speaks for itself. for I know it's a moment of sadness for us because we're going to miss her. We're certainly going to miss her here at Flagstaff Tabernacle. But the joy you see there's an uninvited guest here and that is death you know that's coming to this event and he's you know taken a fleshly life from us but there's a joy behind that knowing that we'll see her Yeah. She will rise as s as sure as the moon rises, as sure as the sun rises, she will rise again. There's the joy that we can take from this event that we're dealing with today. She lived this testimony. And I I want to speak to her children, her grandchildren, her nephews and nieces and family. The testimony she lived wasn't for us. It was for you. She lived that for you. She dragged you to church here. Well, I mean, she didn't drag you, but it looked like she dragged you sometimes. M she she she wanted her children and her nephews and her nieces and her family to have the life that she have because she knew she was going to be in this position one day. But she wanted to see when she rose to see you all again. You, we could say it like this. You were her purpose, her children and her family. She She wanted nothing more than for you to be Christians, to know the Lord Jesus as your personal savior. Eternal life. We have a saying here at the church is living for others. Eternal life isn't getting everything from others. Eternal life is serving living for others. And that's how Sister Vivian lived. and I hope this will you'll understand this in the way that I mean it. She lived her life for the clan that she had. She lived her life for the spiritual group that is stronger than any family blood that we would have is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. And she lived her life for you all, for that family. In closing, I would read one more scripture in first Thessalonians. 1 Thessalonians chapter 4. And I would just ask you, you know, grieving, you must go through that process. No, no problem. We we it's part of if you don't go through it, you'll actually become sick in your spirit. You must go through a grieving process. But know that at the end of that process, there's a light of eternal life that Vivian wanted each and every one of us to have in our souls. First Thessalonians and I'll close with this 1 Thessalonians 4:14. And it says, "For we which believe, for if we believe, excuse me, that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring forth with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Paul says this, "Wherefore comfort, comfort one another with these words." I want to bring comfort to you this morning. Those are the true words of the Lord. Take comfort in that. Yes, we must go through grieving those things, but take comfort. If you die in him, you'll rise again in him. to praise the Lord. I'm going to do something a little bit out of the program. Young lady at the piano, would you mind if we sing I'll fly away again? Would you mind standing with me and let's sing it? I'll tell you what, we'll sing it in English on the verses and the chorus in Navajo. Would that be all right? I'll do my best with Dad Dasham. I don't know how I'm going to do my best. Okay. So, stand with me and let's sing the verses in English. Brother Chase, if you'd put those up in English and then uh I'll fly away. [music] I think it starts with some glad morning. Hold on.

At this time we have the closing prayer that is uh Larry Gordy. I would like to say thank you for my kids from wonder. would like to thank Paul for being behind my niece Al Lima through all of this Junior. Just wanted to add one more thing to [clears throat] Vivian. A my sister Vivian she was crying testimony. She made her testimony. She loved her kids, her grandkids very much. and she said, "Pray for me, my kids, my grandkids. I don't know if I'll ever see them in heaven." So, you know, that just kind of made me think, you know, why was she crying? I mean, if you can just be nice to people or give money to the church, maybe that'll get you into heaven. It will not. I see. You have to put your faith in Jesus Christ. That's the only way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you know, this can only be told so many times because some of the people that were passionate about it will eventually leave this earth. I always tell people we were all raised by my mother and my father. We all heard the same message. How you twist it and believe in it in a different ways. I don't know how you could do that, but it was very clear. So, I want to thank everybody. I don't know if the kitchen people can hear us. I want to thank whoever's down there preparing and making the food or whatever is going on down there people that monetarily helped us. Thank you.
