[7:55] Let's just bow our heads. Lord, thank
[7:58] you for this privilege to be gathered

[8:03] We're [music] so happy, Lord, to
[8:05] celebrate the ending of a year and the
[8:08] beginning of a new year. Lord, [music]
[8:11] we could say this that all this year you
[8:13] have been faithful, Lord. And all this
[8:14] year, you have been so so good. And we
[8:17] know that you'll be in the coming year
[8:20] as well. And so we appreciate your
[8:23] presence, Lord, once again this evening.
[8:24] We ask you to be with us, Lord. We
[8:27] invite you into our midst. Be a welcome
[8:30] guest among us, Lord. Be with us [music]
[8:32] during this time. In Jesus Christ's name
[8:34] we pray. Amen.
[8:38] You may be seated, Brother Ryan. I don't
[8:40] want to go too far from that song. I
[8:42] think it's right. I think it's uh but I
[8:46] sure would like somebody to help me to
[8:48] sing it. Brother Steven, how do you
[8:50] feel?
[8:54] As I sat and listened to the words of
[8:56] this song, I
[8:58] I just took a moment and just thought
[9:01] back.
[9:04] This year's been a good year. Amen.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; And I'm looking forward to the coming of
[9:14] the Lord.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; Didn't happen last year. Maybe it's
[9:18] tomorrow. Maybe it's the next day. But
[9:20] I'm still looking. Brother Steven, help
[9:22] me sing this song. And we'll sing this
[9:24] all together. Amen.

[13:22] sing the chorus, Penful by the Blood of
[13:24] the Lamb. Amen. Amen. Amen. What a

[13:33] I'm clean, Brandon. Yeah, right.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; I I'm clean. I can't tell you any other
[13:37] difference. Way, brother Samuel. I'm
[13:39] clean.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Nothing by myself. That's the beauty of
[13:44] it.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; It's because he chose me. I cannot fall.
[13:50] I will not fall. I'll stumble, but I'll
[13:53] get back up because I'm a child. He has
[13:56] paid in full by the blood of the lamb.
[13:58] Amen. [singing]
[13:59] Amen. [music]
[14:01] Oh,
[14:05] [singing and music]
[14:09] and by the blood of the lamb.
[14:15] Oh, free from [music] sin. Free to
[14:18] [singing] live. Now I am.
[14:23] Oh, it reads on the page
[14:26] [singing and music]
[14:27] where my sins were written. down made it
[14:32] full by the blood of the lamb.
[14:39] When just
[14:41] call meant of sin,
[14:46] no one worthy [music]
[14:48] could be found among him.
[14:54] But the precious son of God with the
[14:58] cross and thorny crown paid my debt with
[15:04] the blood of the lamb. [singing]
[15:08] Oh paid in full by the blood of the
[15:13] lamb.
[15:16] Free from sin. Free [singing] to live.
[15:20] Now I am
[15:26] [singing]
[15:27] [music]
[15:37] [music]
[15:42] [music and singing]
[15:47] [singing]
[15:48] [music]
[15:50] Yeah.
[15:52] Heat.
[16:00] [music]

[17:12] on the face where my
[17:21] blood from the lamb
[17:29] hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, brother
[17:31] Stephen. I guess I'm just as if you can
[17:34] see the smile on my face. I write down
[17:36] songs here, but I have no idea really. I
[17:39] haven't s them through. And then when I
[17:40] sing them, I think, "Oh, Sister Laura,
[17:43] this is exactly what I need." Lord Jesus
[17:47] knew us. Amen. We have a number of
[17:49] requests tonight. So, we're going to
[17:51] just enjoy the times.
[17:55] Sister Evelyn, Sister Liberty, you have
[17:58] a song. So, if you would come. Amen.
[18:02] Amen. Amen. You know, um, little bit of
[18:06] tidbit of nuggets. Have you ever
[18:10] wondered how can I tell somebody
[18:14] that I'm saved?
[18:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham answers this question.
[18:20] So, I'm not saved today because I can
[18:22] shout. I'm not saved because I can feel
[18:24] like I'm saved. I'm saved because I met
[18:28] God's condition of this Bible. Jesus
[18:31] said, "He that heareth my words and
[18:33] believeth on him that sent me has everl
[18:36] everlasting life and shall not come into
[18:38] condemnation, but is passed from death
[18:41] to life." I believe that. That's right.
[18:44] And on then conditions, I'm saved.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; And because God said so, [laughter]
[18:52] &gt;&gt; I believe it. God said it, that's good
[18:55] enough by me. Amen. Amen. [music]
[19:15] Where's [music] the light?
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Sure. [singing and music]
[19:25] She
[19:28] [music]
[19:29] as to me
[19:33] she's
[19:39] [music]
[19:46] in the house.
[19:49] Death [singing] has to flee.
[19:53] Now there is life
[19:56] where darkness used to be.
[20:00] Now there is hope.
[20:04] There's no [singing] more doubt.
[20:08] Praise his name.
[20:12] Praise his name.
[20:15] He's in the house. [singing]
[20:20] &gt;&gt; [music]
[20:21] &gt;&gt; We were [singing] like that little girl
[20:25] dead in all our sins
[20:29] till Jesus touched this heart of mine
[20:32] and gave me life again.
[20:37] I am just a house of clay.
[20:40] But ever since that blessed day,
[20:44] there's a light that shines in me for
[20:48] all the world to see. [singing]
[20:52] He's in our house. [screaming]
[20:55] Death has to flee.
[20:59] Now there is light
[21:02] where darkness used to be. [singing]
[21:07] Now there is hope.
[21:10] There's no more doubt.
[21:14] Praise his name.
[21:18] Praise his name.
[21:22] He's in the house.
[21:27] New flee.
[21:29] Now there is [screaming] life
[21:33] where darkness used to be. [singing]
[21:37] Now there is hope.
[21:41] There's no more doubt.
[21:45] Praise his name.
[21:48] Praise his name.
[21:53] He's in the house.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; [music]
[22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:11] That's a good way to do it. I thought
[22:13] we'll
[22:15] have a song and then we might have one
[22:16] of our brothers come up and say
[22:18] something.
[22:23] Mitchell's trying to act like I don't
[22:25] see him back there.
[22:29] It's like directly in line. Brother
[22:30] Mitchell, you can't even hide. I looked
[22:33] at Brandon and he said, "Have Mitchell
[22:35] go first." So,
[22:39] I just thought we'll give the brothers
[22:40] maybe five or 10 minutes. Share a
[22:42] scripture.
[22:44] Share what's on your heart. As deacon,
[22:46] if you want to correct anything in the
[22:47] church, go for it. You know,
[22:52] &gt;&gt; well, you know, I mean, they are the
[22:54] policemen of the church.
[22:56] So, praise the Lord. And then we'll uh
[22:59] Anyone have a testimony while Mitchell's
[23:02] getting nervous? We got to get him to
[23:04] the Sister Pauline. We got to get him to
[23:06] the just a peak of nervousness. That way
[23:09] he'll get out of the way and the Lord
[23:10] could use him.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; Um just wanted to give a praise report
[23:16] about my uh my stepdad Mike. Um he went
[23:19] to surgery and um he had his follow-up
[23:22] appointment and he is cancer free.
[23:24] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[23:27] the Lord.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; All right, brother Mitchell.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Um, God bless you guys. I just first uh
[23:46] want to tell you it's been a privilege
[23:48] to serve with you guys this past year
[23:52] next to each one of you guys and through
[23:54] the ups and the downs and just is you
[23:57] guys are family to me and it's been a
[23:59] real privilege to serve with you guys
[24:01] and we love you. I love you. My family
[24:03] loves you all and um yeah just wanted to
[24:07] say that uh how much I appreciate each
[24:10] and every one of you. Um so it's
[24:13] communion. And so I'm going to just say
[24:15] a brief part of a scripture of that
[24:17] you're already going to that you're
[24:19] already going to say.
[24:21] Um
[24:23] this is a about footwashing St. John 13
[24:29] uh vers uh 16.
[24:34] Not going to read the whole thing
[24:35] because brother Steve will will get it
[24:38] uh here in a few minutes. Um, I'm just
[24:40] going to read. Uh, verily, verily, I say
[24:42] unto you, the servant is not greater
[24:44] than his lord, neither he that has sent
[24:46] greater than he that has sent him. If
[24:48] you know these things, happy are ye if
[24:51] you do them. Talking about footwashing.
[24:55] Happy are ye if you do them.
[24:58] And uh I always remember brother Jim
[25:01] always saying that
[25:03] &gt;&gt; if you're not happy, take communion. And
[25:06] I'm not here to preach to anybody about
[25:09] taking communion. It's just one of those
[25:11] things by
[25:13] tonight, you know,
[25:16] just ask a few questions here. Does
[25:18] anybody here
[25:20] battle with fear?
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Maybe a temper. I mean, I could raise my
[25:29] hand to all these. Um, I mean, honestly,
[25:33] it's fill in the blank. And mine's not
[25:36] one blank. There's a lot of blanks that
[25:37] you could fill in with things I battle
[25:40] with. Anxiety, depression, and brother
[25:43] Steve talked about on Sunday. It was
[25:45] actually a scripture Brother Brandon
[25:46] talked about about uh how the devil
[25:50] attacks us so much with these things,
[25:52] anxiety, depression, that it steals your
[25:55] joy,
[25:56] &gt;&gt; your happiness.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that hit me really hard on
[25:59] Sunday on uh some of these things. Not
[26:02] not that I would say I have my moments
[26:04] of fighting all these things. I'm not
[26:05] saying I'm in some deep depression or
[26:08] anything like that, but the devil has a
[26:10] way of getting to each of us over those
[26:12] things. And uh
[26:16] you know by faith tonight I'm just going
[26:19] to not that I didn't before but in my
[26:21] communion tonight I'm just going to
[26:23] stand by faith tonight
[26:24] &gt;&gt; that it's happy if you do this. So I'm
[26:28] just going to stand by faith and be
[26:29] happy that I'm taking this taking
[26:32] communion tonight. Not that this one is
[26:34] you know what maybe it is. maybe this
[26:36] one will be different and that not that
[26:38] I'm not happy but you know that it's
[26:41] fresh like when I was a new Christian
[26:44] you know that's what I'm looking forward
[26:45] to for this year the sooncoming of the
[26:48] Lord and I want to be joyful about it
[26:50] I'm tired of the devil beating me down
[26:53] beating us down over these things and we
[26:56] have nothing to
[26:59] just happy are ye in him so um and just
[27:03] like sister Liz said on Sunday too
[27:06] before his song, "I just want to give
[27:08] the devil a kick in his mouth."
[27:11] And um that's all I could say is just by
[27:14] faith tonight and I I want you guys to
[27:17] do it with me by faith tonight
[27:20] to claim that happy are you if you do
[27:23] this. So, and please, I'm not taking it
[27:25] as if you don't feel like you need to
[27:26] take communion, that's not what I mean
[27:28] by it at all, but the scriptures do say
[27:30] that happy are you if you do this. So,
[27:34] That's where I'm at tonight. Just a
[27:36] quick little word about that. And I like
[27:37] I said, I do appreciate appreciate you
[27:40] guys and I'm looking forward to another
[27:42] year serving with you and, you know,
[27:44] another year of, you know, the sooner
[27:47] sooner to coming home. So, Lord bless
[27:50] you guys. Thank you,
[27:54] [applause]
[27:58] &gt;&gt; brother Ryan. Just before we have our
[28:00] next uh special the little chorus um

[28:19] place. [singing]
[28:22] You always

[29:35] Whenever I am afraid, I will trust
[29:40] [singing]
[29:41] in [music] you.
[29:47] Lord, [music] I'll trust in [singing]
[29:49] you.
[29:52] [music]
[29:54] Let the weak say I
[29:59] am and strong
[30:02] in [singing and music] the strength
[30:05] of the Lord. I will trust in you.
[30:11] [music and singing]
[30:15] Yes, we will. Amen. God help us. Brother
[30:18] will, would you make ready at this time
[30:21] as he's making ready to sing a special
[30:27] pleased with the Lord? I trust that he's
[30:30] pleased with me.
[30:33] Not that for any other reason except
[30:35] that I'm like David. I know where my
[30:39] strength's coming from. And when I fall
[30:42] down, Brother Samuel, I'm telling you, I
[30:45] know how to get back up.
[30:48] Yeah, you may see me kick around in the
[30:50] dust a little bit. But because I'm a son
[30:54] of God,
[30:55] &gt;&gt; I get back up.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; And that's what we each want to do. Huh?
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Yeah.
[31:30] Who thought I'd find you at the lowest
[31:35] place?
[31:37] Who thought you'd fill me in the crowd?
[31:44] Who knew you'd make good my mistakes?
[31:51] You're nothing like I thought [singing]
[31:54] you were. You're better.
[31:57] What a god. What a god.
[32:04] What a god. What a god.
[32:14] I [singing] thought [music] you'd show
[32:16] up for perfection.
[32:21] Cuz what [singing] kind of God looks for
[32:24] the lost?
[32:27] [music]
[32:28] They say it's over for a sinner,
[32:34] but you say,
[32:36] "No, it's not. No, it's not." [singing]
[32:40] What a God. What a God.
[32:45] [music]
[32:48] What a God. What a God.
[32:52] [singing]
[32:57] If the highest place I reaches at your
[33:01] feet, then I've done it all. If the best
[33:05] thing that I see is your glory,
[33:09] then I've seen it all.
[33:12] Your love has changed my [singing] life.
[33:16] Forever satisfied.
[33:19] God, you are my everything.
[33:26] [music] If one [singing] word is the
[33:28] only thing you speak, then I've heard it
[33:32] all. If you feel your heart and never
[33:36] [singing and music]
[33:36] see your hand, I still have it all.
[33:41] No treasure of this life could ever
[33:46] satisfy
[33:48] God. You are my everything.
[33:55] If the highest place I
[33:57] [singing and music] reach is at your
[33:59] feet, then I've done it all. If the best
[34:03] thing that I've seen is your [singing]
[34:06] glory,
[34:08] then I've seen it all.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; [music]
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Your love has changed [singing] my life.
[34:14] Forever satisfied.
[34:17] God, you are my [singing] everything.
[34:25] God, you are my everything
[34:32] and I will bless [singing]
[34:35] the Lord.
[34:39] Oh my soul
[34:42] and [music and singing] all
[34:45] that is within [singing and music]
[34:48] me. And I will bless the Lord.
[34:55] Oh my [singing] soul
[34:58] and all
[35:01] that [singing]
[35:01] is within me. Bless his [singing] holy
[35:10] name.
[35:20] [applause]
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[35:24] Brother Brandon,
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Mitchell left a few minutes out
[35:29] there, too. And then Chase said you
[35:30] could have a few of his. So,
[35:34] so take your time.
[35:36] Praise the Lord.
[35:40] Oh, yeah. Did your family have a song,
[35:42] too?
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You could do that after
[35:48] that then. How's that?
[35:52] &gt;&gt; This was kind of a sucker punch.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; No.
[36:01] Oh man,
[36:03] you know, it's uh you know, it's a good
[36:06] sermon on Sunday when you you dwell on
[36:08] it all week.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; It's good eagle meat, Stephen. I
[36:12] appreciate that.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; I just been gnawing on it all day,
[36:18] &gt;&gt; all week.
[36:21] You know that
[36:23] that fear, you know, you you could type
[36:26] it to the
[36:28] natural, especially me when I was
[36:29] younger.
[36:31] I remember I was you can ask my mother I
[36:33] was so fearful right don't she basically
[36:36] had to kick me and force me to do
[36:39] everything
[36:41] and boy when you got over that fear the
[36:44] joy
[36:45] I mean I remember one time we were out
[36:48] it was a water slide or we were at a
[36:50] water park and my mom I she threw me up
[36:52] over her shoulder took me all up then
[36:55] I'm kicking and screaming and throwing
[36:56] fits and she's like you're going to have
[36:58] fun
[37:00] like you know throwing a fish sat me in
[37:02] the tube kicked me down deal and first
[37:04] thing you knew I'm laughing and giggling
[37:06] and having I got there and I end up
[37:08] doing it uh 10 more I thought about that
[37:10] I said that's that's the fear you get
[37:12] over that fear that joy comes over you
[37:15] it's like
[37:16] &gt;&gt; man
[37:17] you know and so I
[37:20] I've had the privilege of you know uh
[37:24] reading in Samuel about David so it made
[37:28] me think and I told Brian just made me
[37:30] think about as there was a scene I've
[37:32] been watching
[37:34] uh
[37:37] made me think of uh Dave going down to
[37:39] the river, you know, when brother
[37:41] Brandham says he's walking down there
[37:43] and he was down, right? He's picking up
[37:45] those
[37:46] &gt;&gt; five stones, Jesus s, right?
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; F ai t h, right?
[37:52] &gt;&gt; And he gets up.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; You know, and he, you know, his brother
[37:56] comes up to you and says, "Aren't you
[37:57] scared?" He's like, "Yeah, I'm scared.
[38:00] I'm scared, but I'm not going to let him
[38:02] defile
[38:04] &gt;&gt; our kingdom." He went out there with one
[38:07] stone and slayed him,
[38:09] &gt;&gt; you know. And I just made me think of
[38:11] that. It's like, you know, David, we all
[38:14] know, was man after God's own heart, but
[38:16] he he had more troubles, more mistakes,
[38:19] more than anybody, you know. So, I just
[38:22] kind of was scrolling through my Bible
[38:23] and I was like, you know, I'm just
[38:26] had my Bible, you know, this one I keep
[38:28] in my truck and I have another one at
[38:31] home and I was flipping through where I
[38:33] was reading and I had this highlighted
[38:36] when I highlighted I don't know. It
[38:39] says, "Only the fear, only fear the Lord
[38:43] and serve him in truth with all your
[38:45] heart, for consider how great things he
[38:50] hath done for you."
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Man, 2025, where' to go
[38:57] &gt;&gt; like that? But, you know, I have so much
[38:59] to be thankful for.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for this church. You know,
[39:03] I'm thankful for y'all family, man. I
[39:07] I'm like Donald. I'm an open book. You
[39:08] know, you see what you get with me. You
[39:10] know, love y'all. And I love my pastor.
[39:13] You know, not afraid. I love it when he
[39:16] preaches grace. And I love it when he
[39:19] gets the whip out. You know, sometimes
[39:21] you got to get the whip out. And I
[39:23] wanted to tell my pastor, I'm in the
[39:25] boat.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; I want to get in the boat.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; And just uh love you all. Appreciate
[39:30] you.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. You want to see? Praise the
[39:39] Lord. While they're making ready, who
[39:41] would have a thought or a
[39:46] testimony, a scripture? I saw Sister
[39:48] Kathleen. Be you, Sister Dette.
[39:51] I'll pay for that one later.
[40:00] Since you said a thought, then I I guess
[40:03] I can share it. But um I know I'm going
[40:06] to share it real quick again because I
[40:07] don't know if everybody heard it, but
[40:09] when I
[40:10] when I got my my port out, it was like
[40:14] the final stage of my cancer. It felt
[40:17] like, you know, like the final surgery.
[40:19] And the lady had told Tim he could put
[40:22] music on and he put um Christian radio
[40:25] and the song Scars came on. I know I
[40:28] shared it with probably most of you have
[40:30] heard it but the song was just beautiful
[40:32] because it was I'm thankful for the
[40:34] scars because they showed me who you
[40:36] are. Um you know and I'm just crying.
[40:41] But then I listen I've listened to the
[40:43] song over and over
[40:45] and there later on in this song it says
[40:49] um through your hands through your feet
[40:53] I found my victory
[40:56] and it touched me so much because of you
[40:59] guys that's where I found my victory.
[41:02] You guys carried me through it
[41:05] unbelievably
[41:08] and I I think my thought when you said
[41:10] that is
[41:12] it so um struck me to bear one another's
[41:15] burdens
[41:17] and I just wanted to encourage everyone
[41:20] to share our burdens with one another
[41:22] and lift each other up.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, sister.
[41:42] May the [singing] Lord
[41:45] grant you peace.
[41:49] May [singing] his love shine down.
[41:53] Love shine down
[41:56] and meet [singing]
[41:58] your every need
[42:03] and keep your feet from stumbling.
[42:10] And fix
[42:13] your eyes
[42:16] on the mark
[42:19] on the prize.
[42:23] As you go,
[42:26] may you rest
[42:30] in Christ.
[42:36] Receive [music] his grace
[42:39] to love all men [singing]
[42:43] in spite of all our differences.
[42:50] May [singing] your words
[42:53] be filled with life
[42:57] that crumble walls of [music] fear and
[43:02] pride.
[43:05] Take [singing]
[43:06] up the cross
[43:10] to serve the least [singing]
[43:11] [music]
[43:13] and the lost.
[43:17] As you go, [singing]
[43:19] [music] be the hands
[43:23] of God.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz he [singing]
[43:33] is your [music] strength
[43:36] and your victory.
[43:40] [music and singing]
[43:44] He [singing]
[43:46] comes [music] behind
[43:48] you. You [singing] and [music]
[43:57] [music]
[43:59] [singing]
[44:02] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[44:02] &gt;&gt; and the portion
[44:05] your banner and shield. [music]
[44:07] [singing]
[44:12] So be [music and singing]
[44:16] released,
[44:19] be [singing] blessed,
[44:22] be free.
[44:26] Live and move
[44:29] as the [music and singing] spirit
[44:33] breathes.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; As you go,
[44:43] go with God.
[44:46] [snorts] Go in peace.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, a little
[45:05] the little song as I sat and
[45:09] Lord be pleased
[45:11] more than ever before. Lord, I love you.
[45:14] Amen.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Sat and looked at
[45:18] young Bailey and I thought, Lord,
[45:26] I wish maybe
[45:31] done a little bit better when I was that
[45:32] age.
[45:36] And I thought,
[45:39] but you made me the way I was, and you
[45:41] let me walk the way I did.
[45:45] Maybe it's for the purpose of looking at
[45:48] that young one and
[45:51] praying for her.
[45:55] Sister Liz, you've got children coming
[45:57] up.
[45:59] And if the Lord carries you young girls,
[46:03] the young [music] women in the back,
[46:04] Samuel,
[46:07] you're going to be walking this way.
[46:11] And this song that more than ever before
[46:13] Lord I love you will become your song
[46:16] also.
[46:18] So we [music] can sing this again as
[46:20] we'll sing this song more than ever
[46:23] before. Amen.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; More [music and singing] than ever
[46:32] before.
[46:34] Lord, I [singing] love you
[46:40] more than ever [music and singing]
[46:43] before.
[46:46] Lord, [singing] I need [music] you
[46:52] more [singing] than ever
[46:55] before.
[46:57] I want you [singing and music] to
[47:03] I [music] love [singing]
[47:10] before.
[47:15] I loved you then. [music] I love
[47:18] [singing] you now.
[47:21] much more now than
[47:26] yet [music] in [singing] the end
[47:29] between I found. You became
[47:32] [singing and music] my dearest
[47:34] friend
[47:37] and you be [singing and music]
[47:40] to me
[47:42] to be
[47:45] [singing and music]
[47:47] and along the way I would have to say I
[47:53] lean [singing and music] upon you more
[47:56] and more
[47:58] and more than ever [music]
[48:01] before.
[48:03] Lord, I love you
[48:09] more than [singing and music] ever
[48:12] before.
[48:14] Lord, [singing] I need [music] you
[48:20] more than ever
[48:23] before.
[48:25] I want you to [music]
[48:28] [singing]
[48:31] I love you
[48:34] more [music] than ever
[48:37] before.
[48:41] [music]
[48:43] You know the truth
[48:45] that [singing]
[48:46] you
[48:48] are [music] worth
[48:54] [music and singing]
[48:56] for all the time
[48:58] that I have [music]
[49:01] s
[49:04] [singing]
[49:08] your presence [music] I
[49:11] adore. Oh,
[49:14] [music] every [singing] sing
[49:22] [music]
[49:23] and more than ever
[49:27] before,
[49:29] Lord, [music and singing] I love you
[49:34] more [singing and music] than ever
[49:37] before.
[49:40] Lord, I need [music] you
[49:45] more than [singing] ever
[49:48] before.
[49:50] I want [singing and music] to tell you
[49:56] I love [music] you now
[49:59] forever
[50:02] before.
[50:09] Brother Chase will have you come up next
[50:11] after brother Olongo
[50:14] sing. I asked him if he wanted to say
[50:17] anything. He says, "Can I play a couple
[50:19] Pentecostal songs?"
[50:22] So,
[50:24] but I've also noticed with Brother
[50:26] Rolando, he [music] plays what's on his
[50:29] heart. So,
[50:31] praise the Lord.
[50:41] another testimony while we're
[50:44] standing by. Sister Dette.
[50:54] So, I have an ear infection or as they
[50:57] say, I have an ear infection. And
[50:59] earlier today, tmi, sorry, my ear was
[51:02] bleeding and I just was really feeling
[51:05] rough and I almost stayed home and my
[51:08] husband even told me to stay home, but I
[51:10] came and
[51:11] &gt;&gt; it's amazing what the Lord, the presence
[51:13] of the Lord can do. I just feel so good.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; [music]
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord I'm here with you on
[52:01] this.
[52:03] Christmas this year my family.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; This year you all are my family
[52:17] &gt;&gt; and thank the Lord this year began very
[52:19] well.
[52:22] We saw the baptism.
[52:25] I'm happy for that.
[52:29] That's called revival.
[52:31] The prophet said, "Souls come to Christ.
[52:36] That's revival."
[52:39] &gt;&gt; And we're inviting the Spanish brothers
[52:42] &gt;&gt; in January.
[52:45] By faith they're going to
[53:04] &gt;&gt; This song is called Oh goodness So
[53:07] infinite.
[53:24] Christo
[53:36] meal.
[53:40] Hello.
[53:45] I
[53:48] love
[54:12] Mother.
[54:44] Messi [music]
[54:56] as a sam.
[55:16] Oh
[55:22] sh
[55:45] again. for
[55:57] well
[56:15] Father
[56:27] again
[56:42] Oh,
[56:52] I s
[57:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; I saw some of you start heading for the
[57:23] door because you thought it was take the
[57:24] name of Jesus with you.
[57:27] It's completely different words in
[57:30] Spanish. Completely different. Ask
[57:33] Sister Naomi if you don't believe me.
[57:36] but it has the same tone and it's
[57:37] beautiful.
[57:39] It's really a salvation song. Um the one
[57:42] verse was like your sins are like
[57:44] scarlet but Christ the saving grace is
[57:47] able to change the soul. So it's really
[57:50] a beautiful u really quite a beautiful
[57:53] song. Brother Chase, praise the Lord.
[57:58] while he's coming. Any other
[58:03] thoughts or brother Brandon and
[58:05] appreciated that what you had to say
[58:06] also, brother Brandon.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:26] Thank the Lord for brother Neil Ignis
[58:29] healing. Had been in a battle there and
[58:31] his body is recovering but Lord's
[58:34] touched him. So thank the Lord.
[58:47] I don't know if uh [sighs]
[58:49] Brandon took any of those minutes.
[58:52] I don't know if uh
[58:55] I feel too good. I was I won't lie to
[58:57] you. I was a little excited when you
[58:58] came up and we're going to move past the
[59:00] service and I wasn't going to have to
[59:02] say anything. But um
[59:05] it's always an honor to be here and
[59:09] it's not that I don't have anything to
[59:11] say, it's that I don't want to say
[59:12] something from me.
[59:14] Um,
[59:16] and I I if I can do nothing else, at
[59:19] least I can praise the Lord and just say
[59:22] thank you for everything that he's done.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Uh, this year's been a hard year. It's
[59:28] been a hard year. It hasn't been a bad
[59:29] year. It's been a hard year.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; That's um [snorts]
[59:36] but in those difficulties,
[59:39] he's proven himself over and over and
[59:42] over again. And that's why I can stand
[59:43] here and be so grateful to just be with
[59:47] you all. Uh, brother Rolando,
[59:51] uh, if you don't know the saying of, uh,
[59:54] blood [snorts] is thicker than water,
[59:55] the actual saying is blood of the battle
[59:57] is thicker than the water of the womb.
[1:00:00] And so, how much closer are we when
[1:00:02] we're both, we're under the same blood,
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; we're family,
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; and we're all in this battle together.
[1:00:10] So, we are family and we're as close as
[1:00:13] we can get either side.
[1:00:15] Um, and that's how I feel honestly. Um,
[1:00:20] you may not know it, but you all get me
[1:00:21] through a lot just in a normal week
[1:00:24] getting to come here and just get a
[1:00:28] handshake from all of you. I get the
[1:00:29] honor to shake hands with almost every
[1:00:31] one of you every Sunday and that's a
[1:00:33] real blessing to me and um, don't
[1:00:37] [snorts] take that lightly.
[1:00:39] uh you know coming up here
[1:00:45] on all days I uh I think I had a little
[1:00:48] bit more warning than Brandon and
[1:00:50] Mitchell. Mitchell found out sitting on
[1:00:52] Sunday. Brother Steve let me know a
[1:00:53] little bit earlier but it didn't really
[1:00:55] help me any and my mind has been kind of
[1:00:58] all over the place and not knowing
[1:01:00] exactly what he wanted me to say and I
[1:01:02] still don't honestly. So when I come up
[1:01:04] here and he says, "Think not what you're
[1:01:06] going to say." And that's what I'm
[1:01:07] leaning on.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:01:11] [snorts]
[1:01:12] you know, I was reading in Exodus and
[1:01:15] strangest things hit you and uh Moses is
[1:01:19] going up and it's the plague of the
[1:01:20] frogs and Pharaoh comes to him and says,
[1:01:23] "Hey, can you just send him away? Can
[1:01:26] you do that?" And he says, "All right,
[1:01:28] we'll do it and we all let you go." And
[1:01:29] Moses goes and does that. And when
[1:01:32] Pharaoh, he says, when Pharaoh sees a
[1:01:35] respit, then his heart hardens,
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; you know, he turns away and you think,
[1:01:39] oh, I look at my own life and
[1:01:43] um these past years, as I said, it's
[1:01:44] been difficult, but but it's kept me
[1:01:46] pressuring forward.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; You know, that's kept me pushing, kept
[1:01:49] me close.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; And I I can look back on my own life
[1:01:52] when I when I get those respits.
[1:01:55] I I can identify a little too much with
[1:01:57] Pharaoh in that when I I think, okay, I
[1:02:00] can I can relax a little bit. I can let
[1:02:03] up a little bit. And I don't want to do
[1:02:05] that. I don't want to do that moving
[1:02:07] into this next year. I believe the Lord
[1:02:09] will give us rest. If you've been having
[1:02:10] a hard time, he'll give you rest, but
[1:02:12] he'll give you what you need. But that's
[1:02:13] not the time to just let go. That's the
[1:02:16] time to recover. It's the time to
[1:02:18] sharpen your sword, boss up your shield,
[1:02:21] make sure everything fits right.
[1:02:23] So if you find that time, whether it's
[1:02:25] now, whether you've been going through
[1:02:27] something like that and maybe you have
[1:02:29] something coming up,
[1:02:32] don't waste that time. That's not a time
[1:02:34] to just let everything go and let dust
[1:02:37] get on your weapons and
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; to just let everything go. It's
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; it's time to be ready for the next
[1:02:44] thing.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Devil's taken some swing with this
[1:02:47] little body this past year, these past
[1:02:48] couple years, and we've had some hard
[1:02:51] corrections.
[1:02:53] But when I see those things, I don't
[1:02:55] take those as bad things. I take those
[1:02:58] as good signs.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; And as an enemy in war, you're not going
[1:03:04] to attack somebody who's not dangerous
[1:03:05] to you. There's no benefit. Only if you
[1:03:08] have something to gain. So if he's
[1:03:10] coming at you, and whether you take that
[1:03:12] personally or this little body,
[1:03:14] he's he's watching out at you. Says if
[1:03:18] he's coming after you, it means he
[1:03:19] hasn't gotten you yet. And if he's
[1:03:22] coming at us this year or last year or
[1:03:25] as it goes, we're dangerous to him.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; And we should be.
[1:03:32] We should be.
[1:03:34] Brother Brandham, he's talking in um the
[1:03:36] countdown and he says that the natural
[1:03:40] always ties the spiritual
[1:03:43] and he was talking about the space age
[1:03:46] that was happening around then. This was
[1:03:47] 1962.
[1:03:50] We landed on the moon. somewhere around
[1:03:51] 1969, something like that. And it kind
[1:03:55] of tapered off a little bit. It wasn't
[1:03:58] the same type of push, the same type of
[1:04:00] investment.
[1:04:01] But he says that's he used it exactly
[1:04:03] that
[1:04:05] you can look at our own times.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; We're ramping up,
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And that's not the natural leading the
[1:04:11] spiritual, that's the natural following
[1:04:13] the spiritual. That means God is on the
[1:04:15] move.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; This is our time. And those are our
[1:04:19] warning signals. Those are our things to
[1:04:21] let us know.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; It's time to get in the boat.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; It's not time to stray away. It's not
[1:04:28] time to look away.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; And [snorts] he's going to offer you,
[1:04:32] the devil's going to offer you
[1:04:33] everything he can. He's going to offer
[1:04:35] every little thing and be a distraction.
[1:04:37] He may take the pressure off of you and
[1:04:39] offer you a little bit of something just
[1:04:41] to pull you away.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; It's not time to get out of the boat at
[1:04:46] all. It's not time to take our eyes off
[1:04:48] of the prize.
[1:04:50] it's time to get in the spaceship. And
[1:04:53] he says, "That's not driven by us.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; We don't need to do anything." He says,
[1:04:56] "That's radar driven." He says, "That's
[1:04:58] remote. There's a tower. There's a
[1:05:00] power.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; It's our job to just get in and be
[1:05:04] ready.
[1:05:07] [snorts]
[1:05:09] I don't want to let up. I want to see
[1:05:13] where we can go.
[1:05:16] I want to see not what we can do. I want
[1:05:19] to see what he could do.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And I'll be the thing that gets in his
[1:05:23] way if I take my eyes off him.
[1:05:27] This little body is wonderful.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; This little body is amazing
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; and I'm so thankful that I get to be a
[1:05:37] part of it.
[1:05:45] I wish I could express the amount of
[1:05:47] blessings that the Lord has. You
[1:05:49] probably all know there's so many gifts
[1:05:53] and blessings that the body has
[1:05:57] in everyone. Some you see, some you
[1:05:59] don't, but they're all there.
[1:06:04] We all get to pull an or a little bit
[1:06:06] differently, sit in a different
[1:06:07] position.
[1:06:11] So if we keep pressing
[1:06:17] and as we end this year and we let it
[1:06:20] die,
[1:06:22] we don't be afraid of that death.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus's whole life was marching to
[1:06:30] death.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; And we are called to be Christlike.
[1:06:35] That was his purpose in life. He did
[1:06:37] wonderful, amazing things, but he came
[1:06:40] here to die.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; We're called to die, too.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Don't try and fight it. Go towards it.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; It's the only way through.
[1:06:56] Hopefully that made some sort of sense
[1:06:58] and brother Steve and everyone here just
[1:07:03] appreciate
[1:07:06] the
[1:07:08] steadiness.
[1:07:11] Something I can keep my eyes on here
[1:07:13] when I get pulled when I fall. I fall a
[1:07:16] lot
[1:07:17] and lets me know it's okay. I see my dad
[1:07:20] fall and he gets up and
[1:07:24] so all we're doing and brother Steve
[1:07:25] thankfully I need it all the time is
[1:07:28] fall down seven times and I get up
[1:07:29] again.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; There's no end there. It's just get up.
[1:07:36] Bless you all as we move into this next
[1:07:37] year.
[1:07:40] And I don't believe it's a waste and it
[1:07:42] doesn't mean anything. I believe there's
[1:07:44] some purpose of a demarcation of a past
[1:07:47] year and a new year. Something some new
[1:07:49] challenge, some new blessing.
[1:07:54] So, I look forward to seeing more
[1:07:57] strength. I look forward to seeing what
[1:07:59] the Lord does through all of you
[1:08:03] because it's it's just a testimony to
[1:08:05] me. It's a testimony to see the growth.
[1:08:08] It's just a blessing.
[1:08:12] God bless you all.
[1:08:19] the girls. Okay, praise the Lord. We do
[1:08:22] have one more special.
[1:08:25] The young sisters be singing
[1:08:29] and we but we also have a few more and
[1:08:30] I'm not leaving out brother Tom and
[1:08:33] brother Ryan. These brothers speak more
[1:08:37] than the other brothers. Brother Ryan
[1:08:38] will be speaking next Wednesday and
[1:08:40] brother Tom not long after that. So,
[1:08:44] I'm looking at brother Donnie.
[1:08:48] You don't even have to come up here.
[1:08:49] Brother Donnie, do you have any
[1:08:52] wisdom?
[1:08:54] You have any scriptures that are on your
[1:08:56] mind or any thoughts?
[1:09:02] I got brother Chase sneaking up behind
[1:09:04] you.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; He's coming with a mic.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:09] Um,
[1:09:17] I'm almost 60.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I heard an amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; And I was remembering when I was little,
[1:09:26] my grandfather before he died, he wrote
[1:09:28] a letter to my sister and I
[1:09:32] and he said to read every day the 119th
[1:09:35] Psalm.
[1:09:37] And I've told a few of you when I first
[1:09:38] looked at it was about a 20 minute read.
[1:09:41] And I thought, man, that's a lot every
[1:09:44] day.
[1:09:46] And as a young kid, I tried. You'd start
[1:09:49] with the first eight stanzas because
[1:09:51] they read them in
[1:09:54] sections of eight. I never got past that
[1:09:56] first. It's called ALF.
[1:10:00] The first couple words is blessed are
[1:10:02] the undefiled in the way.
[1:10:06] And it took me nearly 60 years to figure
[1:10:08] that out.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; And as I listen tonight, you hear
[1:10:14] the foolishness of preaching the
[1:10:18] the living of that life,
[1:10:22] the articulating
[1:10:25] in the best way we can, Brandon.
[1:10:29] Sounds broken, sounds fallible, sounds
[1:10:31] human.
[1:10:34] But we are blessed, happy,
[1:10:38] perfect, undefiled.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; True
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; because we walk in this something called
[1:10:42] the way.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And I never knew what that was.
[1:10:48] And it's taken me nearly 60 years to
[1:10:50] figure out. It's just the step. It's
[1:10:51] just the getting up.
[1:10:54] It's just the trust that being here
[1:10:56] tonight is the answer.
[1:10:59] the that weaving
[1:11:03] of the gospel that we've spread tonight
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; through testimony and word and
[1:11:09] fallibility.
[1:11:10] And the that's so great that in our
[1:11:14] weakness is that strength.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; So we submit to that. I do tonight.
[1:11:20] Forgive me.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; If there's wisdom in that, I don't know,
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; but it's all I know. So, I put my life
[1:11:30] in that. And I too thank you for
[1:11:33] allowing me to be a part of you.
[1:11:36] Family isn't a big enough word. I see
[1:11:40] Chase's
[1:11:42] attempt at trying to save it, but you
[1:11:44] can't.
[1:11:46] But I'll give to you what I can until I
[1:11:48] can no longer do so. That's all I got.
[1:11:52] Amen.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; It's perfect. [applause]
[1:11:57] Brother Kurt,
[1:11:59] Brother Kurt, that um
[1:12:02] the one that Brother Mitchell read,
[1:12:04] "Happy are ye if you do these things."
[1:12:08] My Scoffield Bible references James
[1:12:10] 1:25. It says, "But who so lookketh into
[1:12:13] the perfect law of liberty
[1:12:16] and contin therein, he being not a
[1:12:21] forgetful hearer, but a doer of the
[1:12:24] work, this man shall be blessed in his
[1:12:28] deed." And that's related to John 13
[1:12:33] and what I think you said, brother
[1:12:34] Donnie. Go ahead, brother Kurt.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Just just a couple couple things. Uh
[1:12:48] that me or is that whatever? Um you know
[1:12:51] I was reading recently and I've known
[1:12:55] this for a few years.
[1:12:58] There's certain kind of fruit, certain
[1:13:01] kind of vine plants like grape and
[1:13:04] watermelon, cantaloupe, things like
[1:13:06] that. And before they harvest it, they
[1:13:10] withhold water.
[1:13:13] And by withholding water, it puts it
[1:13:16] under stress. And under stress, it
[1:13:19] becomes sweeter.
[1:13:21] They actually do that on purpose.
[1:13:25] It's pretty smart.
[1:13:28] There's no mistakes in our lives.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; That's how he produces gold.
[1:13:37] I thought that was and I wanted to share
[1:13:41] a little something
[1:13:44] that
[1:13:46] our Eleer said
[1:13:51] just he said this uh from a super sense
[1:13:57] and I keep this in my Bible to remind me
[1:14:01] because I need reminding.
[1:14:04] He said And after making my own
[1:14:08] consecration
[1:14:11] and after making having the church to do
[1:14:15] so. Now
[1:14:18] if God blessed us this way
[1:14:22] he has in the last few meetings with
[1:14:24] that little consecration.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; What will he do if we keep it up?
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; See just keep it up. Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; See, we stop.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; We stop.
[1:14:44] And the power that's supposed to be
[1:14:46] here. I'm talking about the ley.
[1:14:49] We're not talking about the ministry.
[1:14:51] These guys pour out their hearts like
[1:14:53] I've never seen.
[1:14:56] These guys really pour it all out.
[1:15:02] But I think in the ley we stop. It's a
[1:15:05] mistake
[1:15:08] and you just keep doing it. It's not a a
[1:15:11] magic wand.
[1:15:13] It becomes a life.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden the ley is doing
[1:15:18] what they're doing but we're just doing
[1:15:19] it here.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; If there's a shortcoming it's in the
[1:15:22] ley. My my personal opinion because I've
[1:15:26] I live this shortcoming also.
[1:15:31] But I also hear what Eleazar is saying.
[1:15:34] Malachi 4
[1:15:37] and it takes you right to Isaac.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; It takes you right to Isaac. You just
[1:15:42] keep doing it.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to feel it.
[1:15:47] You just keep doing it. And it's true.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; And one more thing just real quick. I
[1:15:55] had a
[1:15:58] brother here years ago.
[1:16:02] This kind of ties in with what Mitchell
[1:16:04] was saying
[1:16:06] and brother Bob Bedair taught me
[1:16:07] something.
[1:16:09] You won't find in the quotes probably
[1:16:11] find in the UPC church but I tell you
[1:16:14] what I found it in my life.
[1:16:17] And he said this.
[1:16:21] He said, "The way you spell joy
[1:16:25] is Jesus, others, and you."
[1:16:28] So you put God first, then you put
[1:16:31] someone else in front of you. Even if
[1:16:33] you're hurting, put someone else when
[1:16:36] you're hurting, put someone else in
[1:16:37] front of you, and then you come last.
[1:16:40] Joy, Jesus, others, and you. And that's
[1:16:43] what Mitchell was saying. See, when
[1:16:45] you're serving, that's when you're
[1:16:46] happiest.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; When you're
[1:16:51] Giving is when you're happiestmen,
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; not when you're receiving.
[1:16:58] And so it becomes who you are if you
[1:17:01] keep doing it.
[1:17:04] It's a discipline. You just keep doing
[1:17:06] it. And it'll be exactly like he said.
[1:17:10] It just takes you higher, higher,
[1:17:11] higher, and you get smaller, smaller,
[1:17:13] smaller. That's not bad. It's probably
[1:17:17] just right. [laughter]
[1:17:18] So, oh, and one more And I'm really
[1:17:20] sorry. I know. But uh I had the
[1:17:22] privilege of sitting in a
[1:17:25] a Sunday school and Don, brother Donnie
[1:17:27] was teaching the uh I call them young
[1:17:30] adults.
[1:17:33] And he was talking about, you know,
[1:17:35] Brother Bram, a real Christian, reads
[1:17:36] his Bible and prays every day. You guys
[1:17:39] don't let that throw you. Just do it.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; It's not a big mystery.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; You just do it.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:46] and he wrote up there reading and he was
[1:17:49] exhorting the the young adults when you
[1:17:53] read just don't read it
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; right
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; just don't read it
[1:18:00] I think I told Donnie I said well you
[1:18:02] know
[1:18:06] his presence comes when before I read I
[1:18:08] rededicate my life to him
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; before I open it up God here am
[1:18:14] It's like inviting him a welcoming
[1:18:17] spirit
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; and it never fails. I give of myself
[1:18:22] before I read.
[1:18:24] Before I pray, I give of myself.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Because that's the prize.
[1:18:31] Then he makes the reading and the prayer
[1:18:33] life move.
[1:18:36] That was really good, Diana. That
[1:18:37] inspired me.
[1:18:40] And that's right. That's what I thought.
[1:18:41] That's it. I'll just keep reconsecrating
[1:18:43] myself to him before I do things.
[1:18:48] It'll live you guys. It'll take us right
[1:18:50] to Isaac.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Kurt. Very
[1:18:57] good. I was thinking of that quote. I
[1:18:59] think it's the Thotyron church age where
[1:19:01] brother Brandham says when when the list
[1:19:05] of martyrs grew longer and longer.
[1:19:09] When the enemy attempts to thwart your
[1:19:11] service, our response is increased
[1:19:15] service.
[1:19:17] So that's good. Um,
[1:19:21] Sister Pauline, I actually had a a
[1:19:24] PowerPoint, believe it or not. I have
[1:19:26] three quotes
[1:19:28] and a question.
[1:19:34] Let's just put the first slide up there.
[1:19:36] Then we're going to let Sister Maddie
[1:19:38] answer the question.
[1:19:43] There's no wrong answer, by the way. No
[1:19:46] wrong. Well, there I mean, you could say
[1:19:48] something really offthe-wall, but
[1:19:51] there's no wrong answer.
[1:20:06] Your dad didn't turn your microphone on.
[1:20:08] So when you get home,
[1:20:10] sit him down in the chair. Look him in
[1:20:13] the eye. No. Go ahead.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Uh to fellowship and
[1:20:18] dedicate the year to the Lord together.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Very good. Sister Mary, do you
[1:20:23] want to
[1:20:25] Try it.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; I'd say it's a good way to start off
[1:20:31] your year. I mean, the Lord is with you
[1:20:33] wherever, but I think being in church
[1:20:34] and taking communion is really good way
[1:20:37] to dedicate the year to the Lord.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Perfect.
[1:20:43] But Hannah and sisters want a shot.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Nice. Nice one, Hannah. Very good.
[1:20:51] I was basically going to say what Maddie
[1:20:53] and Mary already said. Starting it off
[1:20:56] right.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Starting the year off right. Brother
[1:20:59] Aiden,
[1:21:08] I don't want to repeat, but yeah, I
[1:21:09] think there's probably not really
[1:21:12] anything better we can be doing. You
[1:21:14] know, there's a lot of people out there.
[1:21:17] You know, we could be partying or
[1:21:19] drinking somewhere. But I think
[1:21:22] communing with God and giving
[1:21:24] testimonies and praising him is a good
[1:21:27] way to honor the past year and to uh
[1:21:30] look forward to his blessings in the
[1:21:32] coming year.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Perfect. Yeah, William.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; I like what Aiden said about not just
[1:21:41] dedicating the next year, but also
[1:21:43] ending this year off, right? There's a
[1:21:45] lot of things we could be doing,
[1:21:46] drinking and well, we are drinking, but
[1:21:49] not, you know,
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; but I like I like dedicating this year
[1:21:54] to the Lord and also showing him that
[1:21:55] I'm thankful for the last year and has
[1:21:57] kept me safe and kept me in the right
[1:21:59] mind.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. John,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; yeah, I kind of have the same idea
[1:22:07] goes with [snorts] be in the world but
[1:22:10] not part of it. kind of
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; just showing our dedication to the Lord
[1:22:15] being out here at midnight and
[1:22:18] you know kind of helps our spirit start
[1:22:20] off the year right.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Good. Very good.
[1:22:27] Brady
[1:22:37] might give brother Sam about 30 seconds
[1:22:40] warning.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Probably just uh start off the year with
[1:22:45] a good Christf fil year just uh keep it
[1:22:50] a good year.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:59] I just can't reiterate it enough to
[1:23:02] end the year giving thanks for I mean
[1:23:05] what an amazing year that you gave us
[1:23:09] and to start our new year out right.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Don't want to leave any of the other
[1:23:16] brothers or sisters out if they had a
[1:23:18] contribution.
[1:23:21] Was
[1:23:25] there Was there a hand over here?
[1:23:31] Austin,
[1:23:34] blame that on Sister Dette,
[1:23:41] we'll have the sisters make ready. They
[1:23:43] can make ready at this time. I think to
[1:23:45] just start off the year right and end
[1:23:48] the year good and give thanks for the
[1:23:51] good year that God gave us.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Very good. Could you pull up that
[1:23:56] quote, Sister Paul? And I can't
[1:23:59] read it on here. I want to read these
[1:24:00] just before they sing.
[1:24:05] Brother Ram said, "It means that next
[1:24:06] Sunday, God willing, we're going to have
[1:24:08] a service here that's just [music]
[1:24:09] before New Year's Eve. if the Lord be
[1:24:11] pleased with us to have this service and
[1:24:14] we want to have a morning service prayer
[1:24:15] for the sick and perhaps a baptismal
[1:24:17] service then I thought I don't have it
[1:24:20] up here sorry
[1:24:37] it's
[1:24:47] There it is. Okay. Then I thought
[1:24:51] advertise it out to our friends that
[1:24:53] they could come in. Then we'll have a
[1:24:54] Sunday morning and Sunday night and then
[1:24:56] have the people want to stay over for
[1:24:57] New Year's. Then we have going to have a
[1:25:00] watch. This time there will be several
[1:25:02] ministers here. We'll be speaking New
[1:25:04] Year's night plum until midnight.
[1:25:08] We invite such ministers come and speak.
[1:25:10] Lord willing. I want to be one of them
[1:25:12] that has something to say on New Year's
[1:25:13] night.
[1:25:15] He says, "I read a little article in the
[1:25:18] paper the other day where an old man, he
[1:25:19] was both deaf, dumb, and blind. He went
[1:25:21] to Sunday school every Sunday. And they
[1:25:22] asked him by braille. Said, where do you
[1:25:24] go to church? Why do you go to church?
[1:25:26] Can't hear what the preacher said. Can't
[1:25:28] hear none of the songs.
[1:25:31] Why do you go to church?"
[1:25:34] And he said, "I just want to let
[1:25:36] everybody know what side I'm on.
[1:25:39] Just want to let the devil and everybody
[1:25:41] else know that he what side he was on."
[1:25:44] I think that's good. Imagine if you
[1:25:46] couldn't even hear, you're blind. And at
[1:25:49] least just let him know what side you're
[1:25:51] on. I thought that was real good. Praise
[1:25:54] the Lord. Well, I guess you're bringing
[1:25:55] us into the new year, so go ahead. God
[1:25:57] bless you.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Why would I worry
[1:26:14] giants calling my [singing and music]

[1:31:23] [applause]
[1:31:25] It's a new year. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:29] come
[1:31:37] at this time and we'll pray and we'll
[1:31:40] read scripture. While we're standing, I
[1:31:42] guess we'll read the scripture in
[1:31:44] Corinthians
[1:31:54] 1 Corinthians 11. We'll start with verse
[1:31:56] 23.
[1:32:00] Paul says,"For I have received of the
[1:32:02] Lord that which I also delivered unto
[1:32:04] you, that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:32:06] in which he was betrayed, took bread,
[1:32:09] and when he had given thanks, he broke
[1:32:10] it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[1:32:14] which is broken for you. This do in
[1:32:17] remembrance of me." After the same
[1:32:20] manner also, he took the cup when he had
[1:32:22] sucked, saying, "This cup is the new
[1:32:24] testament in my blood. This do ye as oft
[1:32:27] as ye drink it in remembrance of me. For
[1:32:30] as often as ye eat this bread and drink
[1:32:32] this cup, you do show the Lord's death
[1:32:34] till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall
[1:32:37] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:32:39] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:32:42] body and blood of the Lord. But let a
[1:32:44] man examine himself, and so let him eat
[1:32:47] of that bread and drink of that cup. For
[1:32:49] he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily
[1:32:51] eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[1:32:53] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:32:57] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:32:59] among you, and many sleep. For if we
[1:33:02] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:33:04] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:33:06] chasened of the Lord, that we should not
[1:33:09] be condemned with the world. Wherefore,
[1:33:12] my brethren, when you come together to
[1:33:13] eat, tarry one for another, and if any
[1:33:16] man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye
[1:33:19] come not together unto condemnation, and
[1:33:22] the rest will I set in order when I
[1:33:26] come. Praise the Lord. Let's just while
[1:33:28] we're standing,
[1:33:30] we'll have a prayer and break the bread
[1:33:33] in remembrance of our Lord
[1:33:37] showing as he told us in the Gospels
[1:33:40] there.
[1:33:55] Amen. Let's just bow our heads.
[1:33:58] Heavenly Father, Lord, once again, and
[1:34:00] how we have appreciated your presence
[1:34:03] this evening, Lord,
[1:34:07] even from the beginning, as Sister Dette
[1:34:09] testified, Lord, we could feel your
[1:34:11] presence and how you through that
[1:34:14] presence brought healing
[1:34:17] just not only to our bodies, Lord, just
[1:34:19] healing to our minds and you put us in a
[1:34:21] right spirit to receive
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; all the things that you would have for
[1:34:26] us this evening, Lord. We recognized
[1:34:29] your presence from the very beginning.
[1:34:30] We acknowledge you here with us and
[1:34:33] we've been thank you for being here with
[1:34:35] us, Lord. As this bread is broken in my
[1:34:38] hands, Lord, it's a figure and a type,
[1:34:42] Father. We understand in the scriptures
[1:34:46] of your body, Lord, and you taught us to
[1:34:48] do this. And oh, God, we stand before
[1:34:52] you unworthily, Lord. There's a
[1:34:55] worthiness that comes through the blood
[1:34:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ that we accept,
[1:35:00] Father, in this moment for each one. We
[1:35:03] thank you for forgiveness of our sins,
[1:35:06] Lord. We confess them before you once
[1:35:09] again, Lord. And we'd ask you to help
[1:35:11] us, Father, as we come in this new year
[1:35:14] as the very first act that we're doing
[1:35:17] this year, Lord, is to break bread not
[1:35:20] only with each other, but most
[1:35:22] importantly with you and to enter in
[1:35:23] into that sweet communion and that sweet
[1:35:26] fellowship with you as we begin this
[1:35:29] year
[1:35:31] 2026. Lord, it's impossible to even
[1:35:35] comprehend that we got here, [snorts]
[1:35:37] that we're here, but we are here, Lord.
[1:35:39] and we remain until you come. And may we
[1:35:43] as this year goes forward, Lord, may we
[1:35:47] consecrate ourselves more to you and
[1:35:49] dedicate our lives more and realize that
[1:35:51] we each want to have a part and a
[1:35:53] ministry and something to do for you.
[1:35:55] And we're all important, Lord. We ask
[1:35:57] you to be with us and help us.
[1:36:00] Bless this time, Father. Jesus Christ's
[1:36:03] name we pray. Amen.
[1:42:02] Amen.
[1:42:10] I thought it was neat that brother Isaac
[1:42:13] read John 13
[1:42:16] on Sunday evening.
[1:42:19] Of course Mitchell read it just a few
[1:42:20] minutes ago.
[1:42:22] It's the scripture we use for foot
[1:42:26] washing,
[1:42:28] serving others,
[1:42:33] act of humility,
[1:42:36] making yourself the lowest. Many
[1:42:38] different types.
[1:42:42] About a month ago,
[1:42:44] I felt impressed to
[1:42:47] put a jack in the bed of my truck.
[1:42:53] Sometimes I have it in there and I took
[1:42:54] it out a while ago and I thought,
[1:42:56] really, I'm going to put a jack in the
[1:42:58] back of my truck.
[1:43:01] And it was there for about a month.
[1:43:06] Forgotten about it. And then
[1:43:10] yesterday, a brother, one of my
[1:43:12] relatives asked me to follow him to a
[1:43:14] tire shop. And I got to where his car
[1:43:16] was, and his tire was in no shape to
[1:43:19] move an inch more or less to be
[1:43:21] followed. And I began to change it with
[1:43:24] the jack he had in his car, and it
[1:43:26] wasn't enough.
[1:43:29] And then I remembered I had a jack in
[1:43:31] the back of my truck. Been there for a
[1:43:34] month. I didn't know why I put it there.
[1:43:36] So those things
[1:43:41] um
[1:43:43] where you serve [snorts] others.
[1:43:44] Sometimes God gives you a
[1:43:47] premonition,
[1:43:49] a head start, a tool
[1:43:53] to help you serve someone else.
[1:43:57] And you never know why it's there or
[1:43:59] what. You might not know what you're
[1:44:00] doing. You might have an impression.
[1:44:03] You might put it in there. Then you
[1:44:05] might take it out. You might put it in
[1:44:07] again. and you might not know what
[1:44:08] you're doing and God has a purpose
[1:44:11] and um
[1:44:14] I don't know just felt led to tell you
[1:44:15] that
[1:44:17] washing feet
[1:44:19] and supper being ended the devil having
[1:44:21] now put into the heart of Judas's
[1:44:23] scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus
[1:44:26] knowing that the father had given all
[1:44:28] things into his hands and that he was
[1:44:30] come from God and went to God he riseth
[1:44:34] from supper and laid aside his garments
[1:44:36] and took a towel and girded himself.
[1:44:39] After that he pth water into a basin and
[1:44:41] began to wash the disciples feet and to
[1:44:44] wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[1:44:45] was girded. Then cometh he to Simon
[1:44:48] Peter and Peter saith unto him, Lord,
[1:44:50] dust thou wash my feet? Jesus answered
[1:44:53] and said unto him, What I do, thou
[1:44:56] knowest not now, but thou shalt know
[1:44:58] hereafter? Peter saith unto him, Thou
[1:45:00] shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered
[1:45:04] him, "If I wash thee not, thou hast hast
[1:45:07] no part with me." Simon Peter saith unto
[1:45:10] him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my
[1:45:12] hands and my head. Jesus saith to him,
[1:45:16] he that is washed needeth not, save to
[1:45:19] wash his feet, but is clean every wit.
[1:45:22] And ye are clean, but not all. For he
[1:45:25] knew who should betray him. Therefore,
[1:45:27] said he, you are not all clean. So after
[1:45:31] he had washed their feet and had taken
[1:45:33] his garments and was set down again, he
[1:45:34] said unto them, "Know ye what I have
[1:45:37] done to you? You call me Master and
[1:45:40] Lord." And you say, "Well, for so I am.
[1:45:44] If I then your Lord and Master have
[1:45:46] washed your feet, you also ought to wash
[1:45:49] one another's feet. For I've given you
[1:45:51] an example that you should do as I have
[1:45:53] done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:45:56] you, the servant is not greater than his
[1:45:59] Lord, neither is he that is sent greater
[1:46:03] than he that sent him. If you know these
[1:46:06] things,
[1:46:08] happy are ye if you do them. And we
[1:46:13] definitely don't want to get there and
[1:46:14] say, "Man, we missed out on all that
[1:46:17] joy."
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; I don't, brother Brandon, I don't want
[1:46:20] to miss out on any joy. Praise the Lord.
[1:46:23] that the sisters will be dismissed to
[1:46:26] not miss out on any joy first.
[1:46:59] brothers can be dismissed.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:59:16] [music]
[1:59:27] [music]
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:01:11] [music]
[2:01:47] [music]
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Every day
[2:03:50] has been
[2:04:02] filled
[2:04:04] We
[2:04:09] always
[2:04:30] [music]
[2:04:31] lips. Jesus
[2:04:39] again.

[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; to the world with
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Walking
[2:06:06] away
[2:06:13] through his blood.
[2:06:27] Let us [singing and music] hear the
[2:06:30] words of
[2:06:36] shore.
[2:06:47] [music]
[2:06:58] The World
[2:07:25] will be real. Christ.
[2:07:40] [music]
[2:08:02] I don't know I've ever heard a better
[2:08:04] rendition of that song, Brother Stephen.
[2:08:06] So, thank you for that.
[2:08:10] Amen. Well, I'm happy happy are you if
[2:08:13] you do them. I ask brother Ryan to
[2:08:15] dismiss us in a word of prayer and if he
[2:08:17] had a verse on his heart to share with
[2:08:19] us. And before we go, my heart's full
[2:08:24] full of joy. I'm in commune with I'm
[2:08:28] just very happy. And what a beautiful
[2:08:30] way to start the year. And so many of
[2:08:32] you came up and said, "Thank you for
[2:08:33] doing this." Uh it's been 20 years, I
[2:08:37] think, since we've had an actual watch
[2:08:39] night or so. 20 years or so. And uh so
[2:08:42] you always never know how it's going to
[2:08:44] go, but thank you. And I feel blessed.
[2:08:47] So I hope you feel blessed as well.
[2:08:49] Bless you.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:55] What a uh what a special way to
[2:09:00] end the year and bring in a new year.
[2:09:01] Amen.
[2:09:04] I was thinking um as they went through
[2:09:06] each of the young people asking them why
[2:09:08] we came here. I thought um you know if
[2:09:11] the Lord were to come
[2:09:13] I'd like to be found doing the thing
[2:09:15] that I like doing the most and that's
[2:09:18] fellowshipping with believers being with
[2:09:20] believers. It's not being at home. It's
[2:09:22] not being comfortable. Those things are
[2:09:24] nice, but gathering with
[2:09:28] those that you're you have a bond with,
[2:09:30] that's goes beyond blood and it goes
[2:09:32] beyond um proximity and it goes beyond
[2:09:35] family. Um that's what I want to be
[2:09:38] found doing if he were to come. I I
[2:09:40] thought of a
[2:09:42] if it's okay just to share this uh
[2:09:44] scripture um I had on my heart. Um well,
[2:09:47] I didn't have it on my heart, but I
[2:09:48] thought Lord, if he if brother Steve
[2:09:50] asked me, this is the scripture I would
[2:09:52] read if that's okay. I shared this with
[2:09:53] a Sunday school class um about a year
[2:09:55] ago and I was reminded of it the other
[2:09:58] day. Um I also wanted to tell a mini
[2:10:00] testimony
[2:10:02] [clears throat] about the Lord just
[2:10:03] really working on my niece Emma
[2:10:06] and it's kind of a testimony and it's
[2:10:08] also kind of a pre-estimony. I'd like to
[2:10:11] testify ahead of time of what I believe
[2:10:13] he's doing for her and just I really see
[2:10:17] um you know the Lord what what I what I
[2:10:20] trust is the Lord just really calling
[2:10:21] her and and so um just want to thank him
[2:10:24] for that. But we were sitting um Naomi
[2:10:26] and I and the kids with her just kind of
[2:10:28] do a little Bible study and this
[2:10:30] scripture came to mind that I had shared
[2:10:31] with the Sunday school class. Um and so
[2:10:34] if it's okay I'll read it. It's Romans
[2:10:36] well the the scripture we all kind of
[2:10:37] know is Romans 8:28. We know that all
[2:10:39] things work together for good to them
[2:10:42] that love God, to them who are called
[2:10:45] according to his purpose.
[2:10:47] Um, but the two scriptures, the two
[2:10:49] verses right before that is what we were
[2:10:51] talking to her about. And I don't
[2:10:53] normally read a lot of translations. I
[2:10:55] hope it's okay if I just kind of just
[2:10:57] share this translation with you. But,
[2:10:59] um, I'd like to read the two verses
[2:11:00] before. This is how I want to.
[2:11:05] Again, this is just a marking of a new
[2:11:07] year. It's just another day really. But
[2:11:08] it's it does mark sometimes in our life
[2:11:10] change as one of the brothers was saying
[2:11:13] um where we can really have that stake
[2:11:15] that we can drive down and make a
[2:11:17] change. And this is what my my prayer
[2:11:19] is. I really want to be my my prayer to
[2:11:22] the Lord this coming year to just be
[2:11:24] more sincere as we heard brother Steve
[2:11:26] preach on a few weeks ago. It all just
[2:11:29] kind of tying together for this year
[2:11:30] end. So, Romans 8:26, it says,
[2:11:32] "Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our
[2:11:34] infirmities, for we know not what we
[2:11:37] should pray for as we ought, but the
[2:11:40] Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[2:11:43] with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[2:11:50] And he that searches the heart knoweth
[2:11:52] what is in the mind of the spirit,
[2:11:54] because he maketh intercession for the
[2:11:56] saints according to the will of God."
[2:11:59] It's a beautiful scripture. Um, but I
[2:12:01] had stumbled across this translation
[2:12:03] that I shared with a Sunday school class
[2:12:04] that I thought, well, not all
[2:12:06] translations are are uh edifying, but
[2:12:09] this one definitely was. It says this
[2:12:11] way, Romans 8:26, also the spirit helps
[2:12:14] us.
[2:12:16] We are very weak,
[2:12:18] but the spirit helps us with our
[2:12:20] weakness.
[2:12:22] We don't know how to pray as we should,
[2:12:25] but the spirit himself speaks to God for
[2:12:28] us.
[2:12:32] He begs God for us, speaking to him with
[2:12:36] feelings too deep for words.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; God already knows our deepest thoughts
[2:12:45] and he understands what the spirit is
[2:12:47] saying because the spirit speaks for his
[2:12:50] people in the way that agrees with what
[2:12:54] God wants.
[2:12:56] And I just want to
[2:12:58] take that into again just another day
[2:13:02] but into this new year that that the
[2:13:04] Lord would really just not just um make
[2:13:07] it a nice scripture to me but really
[2:13:08] just open up the understanding behind it
[2:13:10] and and not just the understanding but
[2:13:12] give me will in me the will to pray this
[2:13:14] way and to realize that um I don't have
[2:13:18] to have the right words.
[2:13:20] It's just the action of surrendering and
[2:13:23] getting on my knees, which is the part
[2:13:24] where I fail the most. I think I have to
[2:13:26] pray the right way or say the right
[2:13:28] words and he'll take it. He'll make it
[2:13:31] worthy to come before the Lord. And so I
[2:13:33] hope that that scripture was a blessing
[2:13:35] to you as it was to me. And you know, if
[2:13:38] you do have some, we all have family
[2:13:40] members, we all have loved ones, we all
[2:13:42] have friends, maybe even co-workers that
[2:13:44] we want to see come to the Lord. So, I
[2:13:46] don't want to just exclude one out, but
[2:13:48] if you don't have somebody to pray for,
[2:13:50] uh, just remember my niece if you could.
[2:13:51] I know that, um, the devil's really
[2:13:53] battling her. Um, especially if he sees,
[2:13:56] you know, a little bit of a hunger, a
[2:13:58] little bit of a light that the Lord's
[2:13:59] drawing her, he's battling to her that
[2:14:01] much more, just like he does with all of
[2:14:03] our family. So, if you just keep her in
[2:14:04] prayer, let's just dismiss. I I do thank
[2:14:06] you, brother Steve, for having this. Um,
[2:14:09] I've stayed up late for a lot of other
[2:14:11] reasons
[2:14:14] and not any of them were as energizing
[2:14:17] and were as satisfying
[2:14:21] as as as this has been for me. So, we
[2:14:25] just thank the Lord for blessing with
[2:14:28] his presence. Let's let's go before him.
[2:14:30] Heavenly Father, Lord,
[2:14:34] we just
[2:14:36] can't really express to you, Lord, what
[2:14:38] you mean to us. And
[2:14:41] Lord, there has been good times and
[2:14:43] there's been hard times this year.
[2:14:47] We don't know what the next year holds
[2:14:48] for us, except we know it's going to be
[2:14:51] trials. It's going to be tests. It's
[2:14:54] going to be good times. It's going to be
[2:14:55] ups. It's going to be downs. But we know
[2:14:58] as a people of faith that you're going
[2:15:00] to be with us, Lord, in this coming
[2:15:02] year. That you're going to get us
[2:15:04] through, Lord. If that means you get us
[2:15:07] through to go home to be with you, then
[2:15:08] you get us through, Lord. But
[2:15:11] Lord, today is too short to take our
[2:15:14] eyes off of you, Lord. Our eyes off the
[2:15:16] prize. And I pray you would just will in
[2:15:19] us the will, Lord, to keep moving
[2:15:20] forward, to take a step every day, Lord,
[2:15:23] when we fall down, might be daily, Lord,
[2:15:26] to help me get back up. Help me dust
[2:15:29] myself off, Lord, and keep walking
[2:15:30] towards you, Lord, in faith. And Lord, I
[2:15:32] pray that when you come, Lord, when you
[2:15:35] come, you find faith
[2:15:39] in me. and every person in here, Lord.
[2:15:42] Every person who is a a true believer,
[2:15:45] Lord, may you just find faith, Lord. And
[2:15:47] and there's no way we can do it without
[2:15:50] you, Father. I know I can't do it
[2:15:51] without you. I can't I can't even walk,
[2:15:53] Lord, unless you hold my hand, Father.
[2:15:55] [music] Would you just hold my hand
[2:15:57] through this next year, Lord? Let's
[2:15:59] Let's just be, Lord, such a victorious
[2:16:02] people this coming year, Lord. Not that
[2:16:03] we wouldn't have battles and not that we
[2:16:05] wouldn't have failures, but we would be
[2:16:07] victorious in spite of that, Father. And
[2:16:10] I pray that you would get us through
[2:16:12] this next year, Lord. That you would
[2:16:14] really just open yourself up to every
[2:16:16] person, Lord, who wants, who's hungry,
[2:16:18] Lord, who's thirsty for you. You would
[2:16:20] just re show yourself in a way, Lord,
[2:16:22] that's never been shown before. Father,
[2:16:24] we know that you're you're infinite and
[2:16:26] you're capable of doing it, Lord. But we
[2:16:28] really just want to not just lean, Lord.
[2:16:30] We want to just we want to just rest,
[2:16:32] Lord, in your arms as this year
[2:16:34] approaches us, as the world is in chaos,
[2:16:37] Lord. I I just I'm at peace, Lord, in
[2:16:38] your arms. I'm at peace in in your
[2:16:41] presence, Lord. And I pray that it would
[2:16:43] not just be Lord as much as we enjoy
[2:16:46] this outward pouring Lord of your
[2:16:48] presence and the praise Lord and but may
[2:16:50] it be such an inward feeling Lord of
[2:16:53] every believer Lord just by maybe Lord
[2:16:55] just by a lifting of their hands Lord of
[2:16:57] their or just an opening of their heart
[2:16:59] towards you Lord that you would see Lord
[2:17:01] a heart behind that hand Lord and that
[2:17:03] you would want to come and abide like
[2:17:06] you never have before Lord would you
[2:17:07] fill the whole house Father
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; the whole heart our minds. Lord, would
[2:17:12] you give us just a piece, Lord, that
[2:17:14] passes understanding, Lord? We love you.
[2:17:17] We thank you, Lord.
[2:17:20] Words like thank you. Just don't say it,
[2:17:21] Father. But I pray that we could just
[2:17:24] use what you've given us, Lord, to
[2:17:26] express our gratitude towards you. May
[2:17:28] it be worship, Lord. May it be a prayer,
[2:17:31] Lord. May it be just quiet time set
[2:17:33] aside for you, Lord.
[2:17:35] We love you and we thank you in Jesus
[2:17:37] name. Amen.
[2:17:47] Praise the Lord. Well, I kind of want to
[2:17:50] sing Take the name of Jesus with you.
[2:17:52] And don't forget the part it Will joy
[2:17:54] and comfort give you. Take him
[2:17:56] everywhere you go. God bless you, Lord.
