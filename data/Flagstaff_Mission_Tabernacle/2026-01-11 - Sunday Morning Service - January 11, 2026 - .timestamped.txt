[8:28] Thank you.
[9:43] Hallelujah.
[13:04] Heat. Heat.
[16:04] Ooh. Hey. Hey.
[16:08] Heat. Heat.
[16:31] Heat. Heat.
[16:54] Heat. Heat.
[17:16] Heat. Heat.
[17:26] Hey,
[17:53] real.
[17:55] Heat. Heat.
[18:39] Heat. Heat.
[19:27] We can stand together.
[19:32] Oh, let's sing this song. The more that
[19:36] I release my cares, the more you take
[19:43] control.
[19:46] And the more that I can humble myself,
[19:52] the more you lift me up.
[19:56] Every day I live.
[20:01] Lord, I love you more.
[20:07] Amen. Just before we turn the service to
[20:10] brother Steve, I really appreciated
[20:14] sheltered in the arms of God. Amen.
[20:18] Brother Steve and I before we came in
[20:19] out that we were talking about um how
[20:23] our bodies are just falling apart. Mine
[20:25] happens to be my mouth, my teeth, and
[20:27] everything else. and I'm just I'm at
[20:29] that age where I'm just falling apart,
[20:32] you know, and but uh the joy that we
[20:35] had. So, we talked about that's there,
[20:38] but then we talked about this millennial
[20:40] reign. To say we understand it, neither
[20:43] one of us said, "But the fact is that I
[20:46] have expectation. I'm sheltered in the
[20:51] arms of God. So, let the storms rage
[20:53] high, the dark clouds rise. They will
[20:56] worry me. Amen. Let's sing this
[20:59] together. Amen.
[21:03] So let the storm raise high. The dark
[21:10] clouds rise.
[21:13] word me
[21:16] for I've sheltered safe within the arm
[21:23] of God.
[21:27] He walks with me
[21:32] and not a word shall be
[21:39] for I shall
[21:43] turn
[21:45] beyond.
[21:51] Lord bless you. Happy to be in the house
[21:52] of the Lord this morning. Welcome to
[21:55] each one and
[21:57] We're in expectation that the Lord will
[21:59] speak to us this morning.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; We're in expectation of also that when
[22:04] we worship him, he'll come down and
[22:05] inhabit our praises.
[22:08] And so that's our desire. We have a
[22:11] couple prayer requests. Before we get to
[22:12] those, I wanted to mention we had a a
[22:16] youth kind of an afternoon service
[22:18] scheduled for next Sunday.
[22:21] And this week on Tuesday, Brother Aaron
[22:24] McGary and I were talking and he said,
[22:25] "Hey, I'm starting youth services once a
[22:28] month in Phoenix and he sent me the
[22:31] flyer and the first one was next
[22:33] Sunday." And I said, "Man, we have a
[22:36] service scheduled." He said, "Well, what
[22:37] if I had your minister come down to our
[22:41] service?" And so we prayed about it for
[22:43] a couple days and that's what we're
[22:45] going to do. So, Brother Isaac will be
[22:48] here Sunday morning. and brother Isaac
[22:49] Hatfield. And then Sunday afternoon at
[22:51] 5, whoever wants to go, we can carpool,
[22:54] whatever. We'll go down to brother Aaron
[22:56] McGarry's and it'll be youth orientated,
[22:59] but all are welcome uh for youth service
[23:02] next Sunday, but the morning brother
[23:03] Isaac will be here ministering to us.
[23:06] And that's maybe in the spirit of
[23:09] working together as pastors. And you
[23:12] know, he was he said, "Brother Steve, I
[23:13] was worried it was just going to be, you
[23:14] know, the few of my youth and I was just
[23:16] going to have a local minister and um he
[23:19] was very excited that we'll all kind of
[23:21] join together." And so in that spirit of
[23:24] unity, that's the plan for next Sunday
[23:26] afternoon. Also wanted to mention the
[23:29] container in the back. If you have a
[23:31] question,
[23:33] we're doing a questions and answers
[23:35] service on the 25th.
[23:37] So that's two Sundays from today. So,
[23:41] put your question in there and we'll do
[23:43] our best to be led of the Lord in
[23:45] answering those. I think that's it.
[23:48] Brother Don wrote in here, "I would like
[23:50] to thank each one of you for your
[23:52] prayers and the power
[23:55] you shared with me." That's really good.
[23:57] Brother Don, of course, very welcome and
[24:01] we're happy and blessed to do it. From
[24:04] Brother Matt, please remember sister
[24:06] Conniey's dad, Howard. He needs a touch
[24:09] from the Lord. He's been suffering from
[24:10] an infection in his foot. And brother
[24:13] Glenn wrote this in asking for prayer
[24:15] for upcoming chemo treatment this
[24:17] Wednesday. The doctor starting him on a
[24:19] new chemo. He's had a couple allergic
[24:22] reactions to the previous chemo. So, a
[24:25] new one is being tried this week. Is
[24:27] that Wednesday, brother? Again,
[24:28] Thursday. Wednesday. I pray that it
[24:32] would be effective in the treatment of
[24:34] the tumor and I won't have any negative
[24:36] reactions. Thank you for your prayers.
[24:39] And he writes in here, "God is in
[24:40] control." And we certainly believe that.
[24:44] We know that. We're trusting in that.
[24:46] And it's real to us, Brother Glenn. It's
[24:49] not just words on paper. It's life. It's
[24:52] actually life to us. So, let's all bow
[24:55] our heads and we'll join in prayer with
[24:56] our brothers and sisters. And if you
[24:59] have a need, slip your hand up, defy
[25:02] gravity, and pray with us. Heavenly
[25:05] Father, Lord, we come before you once
[25:07] again. And I see the believers that have
[25:10] gathered here this morning, Lord. But
[25:12] what's hard for these physical eyes to
[25:15] see is all the angels and the
[25:16] ministering spirits. And that would be
[25:19] gathered with us. But we believe that
[25:21] they're there, Lord. Your word places
[25:23] them there. It says the angels encamp
[25:25] around those who fear you. And we do.
[25:27] And we love you, Lord. We have a a great
[25:30] reverend respect for what you've
[25:33] provided to us in this hour and we trust
[25:35] that you're here with us and and so we
[25:37] first thank you Lord for being here with
[25:39] us for bringing each one here safely and
[25:43] allowing us to gather and worship you.
[25:46] We don't know how long we'll be able to
[25:47] do it. So we give you thanks once again
[25:49] and we present these petitions to you
[25:53] Lord for our brother Glenn. We continue
[25:56] to strike the ground in faith believing.
[25:59] Lord, your promise has been made. We've
[26:01] accepted it. And now we deal with
[26:04] symptoms and things that Satan would try
[26:06] to discourage us. But we're not
[26:08] discouraged, Lord. We're taking these
[26:10] footsteps day by day and possessing the
[26:13] land that you give us, Lord. And so we
[26:15] claim that for our brother, Lord, for
[26:18] Sister Conniey's dad. He's battling
[26:20] these things at the end of life, Lord,
[26:22] and infection in his foot and different
[26:25] battles, Lord, that they're having to
[26:26] deal with with him. And we'd ask that,
[26:28] Lord, not only would you help our
[26:30] brother, but give Brother Matt, Sister
[26:31] Connie grace and knowing how to handle
[26:34] these situations, Lord. And we thank you
[26:37] for each member that slipped up their
[26:39] hand, Lord. Each person that would come
[26:40] in here with faith and defy gravity,
[26:43] Lord. I heard the other day, it's not a
[26:47] force. gravity isn't, but it's a
[26:50] disruption in space and time. And Lord,
[26:53] think about we think about the eternal
[26:55] God, and he's beyond all space and time.
[26:59] But we do that, we slip up our hands,
[27:01] Lord. There's nothing that could pull us
[27:02] down away from that now. So, we thank
[27:04] you for the ability to do that. We
[27:06] worship you this morning, Lord, in
[27:08] spirit and truth. We ask you and invite
[27:10] you to be with us with these prayer
[27:12] requests, Lord, with these needs. Dwell
[27:15] in our midst this morning. In Jesus
[27:17] Christ's name we pray. Amen. If you have
[27:20] your Bibles, we might turn to Isaiah the
[27:23] 12th chapter. We haven't read a
[27:24] scripture in a while. I've kind of been
[27:26] testing testing it out to go different
[27:29] ways with reading a scripture in the
[27:32] morning. So, we'll do Isaiah 12 this
[27:34] morning. And I haven't heard from you
[27:37] all either way. So, that gives me
[27:39] freedom to kind of go
[27:42] uh Isaiah chapter 12. We just read the
[27:44] whole chapter. It's
[27:48] for our responsive reading.
[27:54] In that and in that day thou shalt say,
[27:57] Oh Lord, I will praise thee. Though thou
[28:01] was angry with me, thine anger turned
[28:03] away, and thou comfortest me.
[28:11] not be afraid.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; Therefore, with joy shall ye draw water
[28:24] out of the wells of salvation.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; His name is exalted.
[28:41] Sing unto the Lord, for he hath done
[28:44] excellent things. This is known in all
[28:47] the earth.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of
[28:52] Zion, for great is the Holy One of
[28:55] Israel in the midst of thee. Amen. Lord
[28:58] bless you.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Great to be seated. Amen. Amen.
[29:11] Blessed be the name of the Lord. What a
[29:13] wonderful sight. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[29:19] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[29:24] Little c the little song come and die.
[29:26] The master calleth. I uh I started out
[29:30] with a smile on my face. I don't I don't
[29:33] say this through a whole lot of I have
[29:35] good days and bad days just like
[29:36] everybody else. today. I don't know
[29:38] exactly what it was except I felt alive
[29:41] in the Lord. And then when I came in
[29:42] here and this second verse and oh my, it
[29:46] just made the smile seem a little bit
[29:48] bigger. Amen. Jesus has a table spread.
[29:52] Amen. Yes, he does.
[29:55] Has a table spread where the saints of
[29:59] God are fed. Heides his people
[30:06] with his man he

[30:29] multitude through the water.

[30:43] Christ
[30:46] to the coming night.
[30:50] And they found their hearts desire
[30:54] on the fire
[30:58] every time.
[31:01] Oh, come and die.
[31:04] Come and die.

[31:40] with Jesus.

[32:20] a glorious
[32:21] all

[32:30] Oh,

[32:58] Lord. Amen.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; I'm happy. I mean, if anybody knows
[33:02] about the love of Jesus, I do. Amen. If
[33:05] anybody knows about the love of Jesus,
[33:08] Amen. You know, uh, I'm telling you how
[33:11] who I am. You see me standing up here. A
[33:14] lot of some of you know me, some of you
[33:15] don't. But every little bit you hear
[33:17] from me takes and makes out this picture
[33:19] of who Donald is. I like seeing people
[33:22] sing. I like watching how they do it. I
[33:25] like hearing them do it. I saw one and
[33:28] forgive me it's not I'm not making gest
[33:30] of it. I just in my mind's eye can see
[33:33] it. This lady, she had a strong voice,
[33:36] but it so happened that she was missing
[33:38] a couple teeth. So when she opened her
[33:40] mouth real wide, you could see that she
[33:43] was missing teeth. And my eyes focused
[33:45] on that, Brother Bill. And I thought,
[33:47] Lord, why is my And I thought, that's
[33:49] because that's me. But it didn't stop
[33:51] the fact of she was giving it everything
[33:54] she had no matter what she looked like.
[33:56] Sometimes that's what I look at myself
[33:59] and I can look out here and I'm seeing
[34:01] what you're seeing and I'm seeing this
[34:03] mouth big missing a couple teeth but
[34:06] hoping that you understand it's from my
[34:09] heart. So sing. I don't care what it
[34:12] looks like. Sing to him because that's
[34:15] all that matter. If anybody knows, if
[34:18] anybody knows about the love of Jesus,
[34:25] I do.
[34:28] Yes, I do.
[34:33] If anybody knows the love of Jesus,
[34:40] I do.
[34:44] Yes, I do.
[34:48] All right. Beautiful song. But maybe
[34:50] that's uh what's deep on my heart.
[34:53] What's the one brother Le Pontain sings?
[34:55] Nope. We know what I'm happy. Uh uh the
[34:58] happy song. The happy song. Somebody
[35:01] help me out.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; That Well, no. Um um no, not the
[35:07] laughing song because I can't do it. Uh
[35:09] the fun. Oh, Lord. It just it was there
[35:12] and it was a moment and it seemed like
[35:14] the right thing to do. Um I was sing we
[35:17] were listening to the tape and it ties
[35:18] into that tape. Talk to me. What is it?
[35:23] The joy. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. The
[35:27] Thank you whoever did that. The joy of
[35:30] the Lord is my strength. Amen. That's
[35:33] the thing I remember. You ever You young
[35:35] people never saw Brother Lantine, did
[35:37] you?
[35:39] My daughter's laughing and smiling. You
[35:41] young ones didn't never see it. He was a
[35:43] big man. So, I'm getting that point. But
[35:45] he was a big man. But when he sang he
[35:48] was, you couldn't help but enter in with
[35:50] it. You couldn't help but just get happy
[35:53] because he was happy. That's what each
[35:56] one of us are to do to the one next to
[35:58] us. Just pass it on. The joy of the Lord
[36:04] is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[36:09] is my

[45:36] can't. I'm going to expect I'm going to
[45:38] do like my little granddaughter just put
[45:39] my arms up. I can't go up and down and
[45:42] everything else, but can you help us
[45:43] sing this? And this is a beautiful love
[45:45] song. Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:49] Amen.
[45:55] Praise the Lord.
[45:59] Amen.
[46:01] Praise the Lord.
[46:04] Glory. Hallelujah.
[46:07] Praise the Lord.
[46:19] Praise the Lord.
[46:25] Praise the Lord.
[46:31] Praise the Lord.
[46:36] Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's
[46:46] &gt;&gt; praise the name.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Amen. Blessed be the
[46:50] name of the Lord.
[46:54] I think that is
[46:57] Amen. I know my dad I'm gonna pick on my
[46:59] dad. I know my dad right now, if he had
[47:03] his brothers, he would be able to do the
[47:04] last part of that song.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Jump down, turn around, touch the
[47:08] ground, and get back up right away.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what sometimes just when
[47:14] you're in your youth and you feel like
[47:16] doing it, nobody's watching, just do it.
[47:19] And then just know that he's seeing you
[47:21] all and he'll he'll just do it. Amen.
[47:23] Amen. Sister Kathy, Sister Marcy, you
[47:28] have a song for us. Amen. are coming. I
[47:31] think from the youth to the
[47:34] had the privilege to
[47:37] be a youth just as these young ones here
[47:39] and sister Mary was my song
[47:43] teacher and she taught us a lot of songs
[47:45] and stuff and as I grew up I saw these
[47:50] women when I met them were not
[47:53] the age that they're at now but they
[47:55] were younger
[47:57] but they always held a light for me
[48:00] always saw them.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Always knew that they just held the
[48:03] gospel high
[48:05] &gt;&gt; no matter what. I saw them ups and downs
[48:08] and but it always comes back.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; So I pray that the the Lord should carry
[48:13] these little ones here if he carries his
[48:15] coming will be just as heals older ones
[48:18] just holding the light of the gospel.
[48:20] Amen. Amen.
[48:44] There
[48:46] is
[48:49] a river
[48:53] and it flows. flows
[48:56] from deep
[48:59] within.
[49:03] There
[49:05] is
[49:08] a fountain
[49:12] that frees
[49:15] the soul
[49:17] from sin.
[49:22] Come
[49:24] to
[49:26] this water.
[49:31] There is
[49:34] a vast
[49:36] supply.
[49:41] There
[49:43] is
[49:46] a river
[49:50] that never
[49:53] shall
[49:55] run dry.
[50:05] And there was
[50:07] this thirsty
[50:11] woman.
[50:15] She was drawing
[50:18] from the well.
[50:23] You see, her life
[50:26] was ruined and wasted
[50:32] and her soul
[50:35] was bound
[50:38] for doom.
[50:42] Oh, but then
[50:45] she met
[50:47] the master
[50:52] and he told her
[50:55] of all
[50:57] her sin.
[51:01] And he said, "Child, if you'll drink
[51:06] this water,
[51:10] you'll never
[51:14] thirst
[51:16] again.
[51:19] Oh,
[51:21] there
[51:24] is
[51:26] a river
[51:30] and it flows
[51:33] from deep
[51:36] within.
[51:41] There
[51:43] is
[51:45] a fountain
[51:49] that frees
[51:52] us soul from sin.
[51:59] Oh, come
[52:02] to
[52:04] this water.
[52:09] There is
[52:11] a vast
[52:14] supply.
[52:19] There
[52:21] is
[52:23] a river
[52:27] that never
[52:31] shall
[52:33] run dry.
[52:38] There came
[52:40] a sound
[52:43] from heaven
[52:47] as of a rushing
[52:51] mighty
[52:52] dear wind.
[52:56] Oh, it filled
[53:00] their hearts
[53:02] with singing
[53:06] and it gave
[53:09] them peace
[53:12] within.
[53:16] The prophet
[53:19] gave
[53:21] the promise.
[53:24] He said the spirit
[53:28] will
[53:30] descend.
[53:34] And from
[53:37] your inner
[53:40] being,
[53:44] a river
[53:47] with
[53:49] no wind.
[53:52] Oh,
[53:54] there
[53:57] is
[53:59] a river
[54:03] and it flows
[54:06] from deep
[54:08] within.
[54:13] Oh, there
[54:16] is
[54:18] a fountain
[54:22] that frees
[54:25] the soul
[54:27] from sin.
[54:32] Oh, come
[54:35] to
[54:37] this water.
[54:41] There is
[54:44] a vast
[54:47] supply.
[54:52] There
[54:54] is
[54:56] a river
[55:01] that never
[55:04] shall
[55:06] run
[55:08] dry.
[55:10] If we could stand. Sister Marcy, Sister
[55:12] Kathy, would you sing this as we invite
[55:14] the pastor around? Truly, there is a
[55:17] river.
[55:23] There
[55:26] is
[55:28] a river
[55:32] and it flows
[55:36] from deep
[55:38] within.
[55:43] There
[55:46] is
[55:48] a fountain
[55:52] that is
[55:55] the soul
[55:57] from sin.
[56:02] Come
[56:04] to
[56:06] this water.
[56:11] There is
[56:14] a vast
[56:16] supply.
[56:21] There
[56:24] is
[56:26] a river
[56:30] that never
[56:33] shall
[56:35] run.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. while his presence is near. Let's
[56:41] just bow to him in prayer. And heavenly
[56:44] father, Lord, we thank you for that
[56:46] song, Lord, and we
[56:49] help us to understand it, Lord, that
[56:51] there's a river that never runs dry. And
[56:54] this morning, Lord, you've chosen that
[56:56] may we we might talk about that river.
[57:01] And so we present the service to you and
[57:04] we dedicate it to you. We dedicate
[57:06] ourselves to you, Lord, and place
[57:10] ourselves in your hands and each person
[57:14] places themselves in your hands this
[57:16] morning, Lord. And may you have
[57:18] preeminence and full authority and over
[57:22] this service. We thank you in the name
[57:24] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[57:27] in the book of Matthew chapter 24
[57:30] and also John chapter 6. Matthew 24,
[57:34] John chapter 6, and Matthew we'll just
[57:37] read um
[57:39] two verses there and
[57:43] verses 27 and 28 kind of became a topic
[57:48] uh for
[57:50] sister Dette and I this week and then
[57:54] just seemed like the Lord would lead us
[57:55] to go this direction this morning. I
[57:59] wrestled with this all night. I told
[58:00] Danette, "Just pray for me." And I know
[58:03] that she did. I know you all were. I can
[58:05] actually feel it. I actually can feel it
[58:08] when you're praying for me. Believe
[58:10] that. So, verse 27 of Matthew 24,
[58:16] it says this, "For as the lightning
[58:17] cometh out of the east, and shineth even
[58:21] into the west, so shall also the coming
[58:25] of the Son of Man be."
[58:28] And then the next verse says this, "For
[58:31] wheresoever the carcasses,
[58:34] &gt;&gt; there will the eagles be gathered
[58:37] together." And someone asked us a
[58:39] question about this we might answer
[58:40] maybe during the Q&A service
[58:43] uh defining maybe what eagles would be.
[58:46] There's different translations of that.
[58:47] If you have a New International Version,
[58:49] it says vultures. Believe it or not, a
[58:52] lot of virgins, about half of them say
[58:54] vultures. The point is that
[58:57] um wherever there's fresh food to be
[59:00] found,
[59:02] &gt;&gt; birds of prey
[59:04] &gt;&gt; seek that fresh meat, that fresh food.
[59:09] And when I was talking to Dette about
[59:10] that, I just had some inspiration and I
[59:12] said, you know, we're birds of prey.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; There's birds of prey, but we're also
[59:20] birds of P R A Y. where the carcass is,
[59:25] where the dead body is is actually what
[59:27] the translation of that is. Where the
[59:29] dead body is,
[59:31] uh there will the eager eagles be
[59:33] gathered. John chapter 6, Jesus is
[59:37] talking along these lines. And in verse
[59:40] 59, he's sort of at the end of his
[59:42] discourse,
[59:44] and this is a very long chapter. It goes
[59:46] to 71 verses.
[59:48] Um in verse 59 he says the Bible says
[59:51] this these things said he in the
[59:53] synagogue as he taught in Capernaum
[59:58] many therefore of his disciples when
[1:00:00] they had heard this they said this is an
[1:00:03] hard saying who can hear it
[1:00:08] it's a hard saying who can hear it a lot
[1:00:10] of the teachings of Jesus were it was
[1:00:13] about love and then it got a little
[1:00:15] tougher you know it's like love your
[1:00:17] enemy
[1:00:18] And then uh you know don't don't even
[1:00:21] look at a woman to lust after her or
[1:00:23] you've committed adultery in your heart.
[1:00:25] Don't say unto your brother, thou fool,
[1:00:28] you've murdered him. So it gets hard. It
[1:00:30] gets a little tougher. But at the end of
[1:00:33] his ministry, he says some things that
[1:00:35] are hard. In another translation of
[1:00:38] this, it says fierce.
[1:00:41] And then at that point, almost everybody
[1:00:44] leaves him.
[1:00:46] Bible says that it's a hard saying. Who
[1:00:47] can hear it? When Jesus knew in himself
[1:00:49] that his disciples murmured at it, not
[1:00:52] just the other people, not just
[1:00:54] everybody who left. His own disciples
[1:00:56] were like, "What?" And he said unto
[1:01:00] them, "Does this offend you?" And this
[1:01:03] is like our theme this week, it seems
[1:01:04] like. How many appreciated brother
[1:01:06] Ryan's message on Wednesday and how it
[1:01:09] kind of tied in with the service on
[1:01:12] Sunday. And I didn't intend this, but
[1:01:14] the Lord will have his way. You can be
[1:01:16] seated. Lord bless you. A hard saying,
[1:01:19] and I put this up there, Sister Pauline,
[1:01:21] as a definition in the Greek. I like
[1:01:23] looking at the Greek in the Hebrew or
[1:01:25] whatever it might be. And it's the word
[1:01:26] scleros. It means hard or harsh or
[1:01:30] rough. Well, we think, well, Jes, it was
[1:01:33] Jesus. He he was certainly soft and
[1:01:35] compassionate and and and you know he
[1:01:38] but a couple times in his ministry, not
[1:01:40] just a couple, but several times he
[1:01:42] would look at the Pharisees and speak
[1:01:44] very harshly and you know tell them you
[1:01:47] hypocrites and you whited walls and he
[1:01:49] would say things like that. In this one
[1:01:51] he's not necessarily going after anybody
[1:01:54] in particular and we'll find out what it
[1:01:57] was but he's saying something that's
[1:01:58] very hard or harsh or fierce. The same
[1:02:02] word hard is used in James chapter 3 and
[1:02:06] verse four. James says, "Behold also the
[1:02:08] ships which though they be so great and
[1:02:12] are driven of fierce winds." And so
[1:02:15] that's the same word. It's something
[1:02:16] very strong, it's harsh, it's hard, yet
[1:02:20] they're turned with a very small helm.
[1:02:22] And then Jesus goes on to say, you know,
[1:02:24] the Bible says it's a hard saying. Who
[1:02:26] can hear it? And he says, does this
[1:02:28] offend you? It certainly did offend uh
[1:02:32] many. It offended them in their in their
[1:02:34] spirit or in their flesh or however it
[1:02:36] just it just offended them. And that
[1:02:38] offend means and I put this definition.
[1:02:40] It's out of the lexicon up here. I
[1:02:42] really liked it. It's to put a stumbling
[1:02:44] block or an impediment in the way and
[1:02:46] all that was fine and make somebody trip
[1:02:49] and fall. But this one here, I think
[1:02:50] it's the second one. It says to cause a
[1:02:52] person to begin to distrust and desert
[1:02:57] one whom he ought to trust and obey to
[1:03:01] cause to fall away. So offend in this
[1:03:04] case and I think that's an accurate
[1:03:06] definition that would fit here. It
[1:03:08] caused people who who begin to distrust
[1:03:12] and to desert one who they ought to
[1:03:15] trust and obey. And what he said
[1:03:18] offended him. had caused many who had
[1:03:20] followed him and who had seen miracles
[1:03:23] and who had witnessed healings and had
[1:03:25] been the very recipient of his love and
[1:03:29] of his great miraculous healings and
[1:03:31] even his touch or even the food that he
[1:03:34] created. They had eaten it and they'd
[1:03:37] watched their loved ones be healed that
[1:03:39] that heard so many beautiful sayings and
[1:03:41] yet at this one it what he says causes
[1:03:44] them to distrust and to desert and to
[1:03:48] turn from one who they ought to trust
[1:03:51] and then it says to cause to fall away
[1:03:53] to be offended to disapprove and and
[1:03:56] Sister Paul if you put the next one up.
[1:03:58] I thought this morning I'll give you a
[1:03:59] little preview of what we're going to
[1:04:01] study and we're not going to answer
[1:04:02] these questions necessarily. I think the
[1:04:05] spirit as brother Steve talks, I
[1:04:06] appreciated Sister Kathleen's testimony
[1:04:09] a couple months ago and she heard
[1:04:11] something from God that the minister
[1:04:13] never said. That that was so beautiful
[1:04:15] to me that that the minister didn't say
[1:04:18] nothing. He didn't he he was talking
[1:04:19] maybe on a different line. Who knows
[1:04:21] what he was talking about. What she
[1:04:22] heard though was something that she
[1:04:25] needed from God. And so I won't, you
[1:04:27] know, pick apart these questions
[1:04:28] necessarily, but but I hope that God,
[1:04:31] the spirit of God will go forward this
[1:04:33] morning and answer you as well. It was a
[1:04:35] hard saying and the disciples murmured
[1:04:37] and and they confess that what was the
[1:04:39] saying? What was the thing? Certainly
[1:04:42] it's in scripture, but it's not just
[1:04:44] there. It's it's actually a discourse
[1:04:45] that he gives over a period of 10 or
[1:04:53] what devil we're prepared. Are we still
[1:04:56] That's okay, brother. Tim.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you just
[1:05:14] praise the Lord. All right, if we cut
[1:05:16] out again, we'll just go to the wired
[1:05:18] mic. Not worried about it this morning.
[1:05:20] So, what was the saying? They said it's
[1:05:22] a hard saying. I didn't read the saying
[1:05:24] because we I want to just maybe work
[1:05:26] through it a little bit. What was so
[1:05:28] difficult? Cuz now in your Christian
[1:05:31] walk, you can come to church and you can
[1:05:33] appreciate the smooth sayings that the
[1:05:35] minister will say and even you know the
[1:05:38] ones that it it's hard but you know it's
[1:05:40] right. You know like love your enemy. We
[1:05:42] could say that and it's hard to do
[1:05:44] sometimes and to put into practice and
[1:05:46] and you know and it says pray for those
[1:05:48] that that despitefully use you and
[1:05:50] persecute you though it's a diffic it's
[1:05:53] something hard to practice. We know it's
[1:05:55] right. We don't we don't even really
[1:05:56] question that and we just know it's hard
[1:05:58] and and and for brothers let's just be
[1:06:00] honest when the Bible says you shouldn't
[1:06:02] look at a woman to lust after her. We we
[1:06:04] practice that. It's something that, hey,
[1:06:06] you know, with the the the sin in the
[1:06:08] world today and with a university of
[1:06:10] naked women walking, yeah, it's it's
[1:06:12] something that tempts us every day, but
[1:06:14] we know it's right. And so, we practice
[1:06:17] not doing that. That's why we have
[1:06:18] things like crosses in our windshield
[1:06:20] and things like that. So, so it's not
[1:06:22] that that's a hard saying. Those are
[1:06:24] just teachings from from God that we
[1:06:26] know we ought to do. But now, it came to
[1:06:28] the point in John where he said
[1:06:30] something hard. It was harsh. It was
[1:06:33] fierce. And then it caused his own
[1:06:35] disciples to murmur. That word means
[1:06:37] like they whispered or they they began
[1:06:39] to I forget the other word for it but
[1:06:41] basically they they almost began to
[1:06:42] speak against the saying they murmured
[1:06:46] just you know you know the the the the
[1:06:48] children of Israel many times they got
[1:06:50] into trouble for murmuring against Moses
[1:06:52] or or they would get into trouble for
[1:06:54] speaking against the the thought that
[1:06:56] Moses has. So it was what was so fierce
[1:07:00] that those who saw miracles became
[1:07:02] deserters and even the ones who would
[1:07:05] crucify him. What was so hard?
[1:07:08] Now we know he looked at the Pharisees
[1:07:10] and he he said some harsh things to him
[1:07:12] and definitely they got offended by it.
[1:07:15] But this what was the crux and that's a
[1:07:17] Latin word for cross. What was the
[1:07:19] junction point? What was the
[1:07:22] intersection that causes people today?
[1:07:25] And more importantly, go to the next one
[1:07:27] there. What's the hard thing today?
[1:07:32] What's the saying today? Well, is it you
[1:07:34] shouldn't cut your hair? I mean, is that
[1:07:35] the real Is that really the hard thing?
[1:07:38] I I don't think it is, saints, and I
[1:07:40] appreciate my mom for agreeing with me
[1:07:42] on that, but I don't think that's what
[1:07:43] it is. Is it the hard thing you
[1:07:45] shouldn't paint your nails or paint your
[1:07:46] face or what? Is that really the hard
[1:07:48] thing? That's just teaching, you know?
[1:07:50] That's just scriptural teaching. And
[1:07:52] Jezebel is the only person who painted
[1:07:55] her face in the Bible, the only woman.
[1:07:56] And she got thrown out of the window by
[1:07:58] the Unix. And then dogs ate her before
[1:08:01] they could even get to her. So, so now
[1:08:03] this is just teaching and we can see it.
[1:08:04] But, but what's today? What's the hard
[1:08:06] thing in the message that causes people
[1:08:09] to look at it and desert it and walk
[1:08:12] away? What is the hard saying? And is it
[1:08:14] really that hard? Or or do we murmur
[1:08:16] against it even as disciples of the
[1:08:19] message?
[1:08:20] What is it? It's such a Well, we'll just
[1:08:23] go to John in the first couple verses
[1:08:25] here of chapter 6. The Bible says after
[1:08:28] these things, now Jesus before this in
[1:08:30] chapter 5, we read it a few weeks ago,
[1:08:32] he heals the man on the Sabbath. And
[1:08:35] there's a little fight with the
[1:08:36] Pharisees and the Jews there and you
[1:08:38] shouldn't be doing this on the Sabbath.
[1:08:39] And he's his disciples, excuse me, are
[1:08:41] picking corn and and you know, there's
[1:08:43] some criticism there. And so now he's
[1:08:44] been dealing with the Jews kind of all
[1:08:46] of chapter five. He goes over across the
[1:08:49] sea, went over the Sea of Galilee, the
[1:08:51] Bible says. And then it says, "A great
[1:08:53] multitude followed him." And they
[1:08:55] followed him for a specific reason. And
[1:08:58] the Bible defines why they followed him.
[1:09:00] Not because they had faith in their soul
[1:09:02] like Peter. You're the son of God. But
[1:09:05] they followed his ministry.
[1:09:08] Because they saw the miracles. Yeah. In
[1:09:10] in chapter five, it was about loaves and
[1:09:12] getting fed and that kind of thing, but
[1:09:14] they saw miracles and that's why they
[1:09:16] followed him. Do you know today that's a
[1:09:18] very similar
[1:09:20] uh pattern that we witnessed in the in
[1:09:24] the ministry of Malachi 4. Many followed
[1:09:26] him. It was great revivals in the 40s
[1:09:28] and 50s. Why? They saw miracles. They
[1:09:30] would tell their neighbor there's a
[1:09:32] great miracle and and and my I was
[1:09:34] healed instantly and I had nervousness
[1:09:36] or I had a goiter or I had something and
[1:09:38] and I stood before this man and he
[1:09:41] defined what was in my life. He exposed
[1:09:43] Satan and then I was healed and they
[1:09:45] would go and tell everybody and there
[1:09:47] would be a great multitude even my
[1:09:49] parents would have had the opportunity
[1:09:50] to be in his meetings certainly my
[1:09:53] grandmother and many of you but now what
[1:09:56] but what's what happened was they
[1:09:57] followed for the purpose but then the
[1:10:00] word went forth and it weeded them out
[1:10:02] it began to kind of trim down who was
[1:10:05] the true believer and then the and then
[1:10:07] the fake believer and and then from
[1:10:09] there a saying went forth that was a
[1:10:12] Lord saying in this message
[1:10:15] and it really got down to where we are
[1:10:18] today just the churches here and there
[1:10:21] on corners and you know in divided areas
[1:10:24] and and so what is it though today?
[1:10:27] What's the heart? Are we are we still
[1:10:29] following? I think there are some that
[1:10:31] are still following today because of the
[1:10:34] miracles today or the miracles that
[1:10:36] happened 50 years ago. They hear a great
[1:10:38] testimony. They say that must be right.
[1:10:39] I'll follow it. you know, it might
[1:10:41] happen in my life and then it happens
[1:10:42] and they follow the message today
[1:10:45] because of the miracle in their life or
[1:10:47] because of the loaves and fishes. But is
[1:10:49] that why you're following today?
[1:10:52] Something to ask ourselves. And so there
[1:10:55] was a we might say it like this. There
[1:10:57] was a pull. There was an attraction.
[1:11:00] There was a draw. Brother Brandon would
[1:11:02] say there was a turn. And so that pull
[1:11:04] would come in his ministry and it would
[1:11:06] it would draw all kinds
[1:11:09] to his to his ministry we could say it
[1:11:11] and and Christ does not change. So if
[1:11:15] that was a ministry back then in Jesus's
[1:11:17] ministry you'll find out in his ministry
[1:11:20] 75% of the healings happen in the early
[1:11:22] part of his ministry he didn't stop
[1:11:24] healing. Malchus had a had a ear that
[1:11:26] was that was cut off and he healed that
[1:11:29] just right before he was crucified. So
[1:11:31] even at the end there were healings that
[1:11:33] were taking place but as a transition in
[1:11:35] his ministry he began with a great
[1:11:37] healing ministry. Then he began to
[1:11:39] preach or prophesy and at the end he
[1:11:42] really get down to the nitty-gritty. And
[1:11:44] he did that for a purpose to find out
[1:11:47] who was a sheep and who was a goat that
[1:11:49] was following him. And today it's the
[1:11:51] same thing. We're getting down to the
[1:11:53] end saints. And there's a hard saying
[1:11:55] that goes forth and that saying is true
[1:11:58] but not everybody can hear it. Even the
[1:12:00] disciples, we might murmur and we might
[1:12:02] not understand. But may God give us
[1:12:04] grace to look down and see the seed on
[1:12:07] the inside and not distract us from
[1:12:10] deserting,
[1:12:11] you know, from staying with our Lord.
[1:12:14] Help me is what I would say. In Moses's
[1:12:18] day, the Bible says this. Well, we'll
[1:12:23] we might say this about today talking
[1:12:25] about the coming of the Lord. Before we
[1:12:26] get to Moses,
[1:12:28] 2 Thessalonians 2 chapter 1. Now we
[1:12:30] beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
[1:12:31] our Lord Jesus, and are gathering
[1:12:33] together unto him, that ye be not soon
[1:12:36] shaken in mind. Might say, don't worry,
[1:12:39] don't be troubled neither by spirit or
[1:12:40] word or letter as from us, as the day of
[1:12:43] Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive
[1:12:46] you by any means, for that day will not
[1:12:49] come
[1:12:52] except
[1:12:54] there come a falling away. And this word
[1:12:56] is apostasy.
[1:12:58] In Greek, it's apostasy. It doesn't say
[1:13:00] falling away. It says apostasy. So
[1:13:02] unless an apostasy come, which is a
[1:13:05] falling away, and the man of sin be
[1:13:08] revealed, the son of predition. I think
[1:13:10] we have the definition up there. It's a
[1:13:12] falling away. And another word is a
[1:13:14] defection. So unless a defection comes,
[1:13:19] that day he's talking about the coming
[1:13:20] of the Lord, that day will not come
[1:13:24] unless the defection or the apostasy or
[1:13:27] the falling away comes and there's a
[1:13:30] great before that or or as as presenting
[1:13:33] that falling away in Christ's ministry.
[1:13:35] There was that apostasy and it was began
[1:13:38] with a great challenge that went forth.
[1:13:41] Do you know who I am? He would say
[1:13:44] something like this maybe to give us a
[1:13:46] little clue as to the answer. My flesh
[1:13:49] is meat and my blood is drink.
[1:13:54] And it was a challenge that went
[1:13:56] forward. Are you willing to eat of my
[1:13:59] flesh and drink of my blood? And the
[1:14:01] challenge went forward. That's a hard
[1:14:04] saying.
[1:14:06] Amen.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; We got murmur against that and we begin
[1:14:10] to speak against it. Well, what happened
[1:14:11] was at the end of these great
[1:14:13] ministries, you find it in Moses, you
[1:14:15] even find it in Gideon, you find it in
[1:14:17] David, these challenges go forward and
[1:14:20] they they whittle down to the very the
[1:14:22] very truest of the remnant of the
[1:14:24] believers.
[1:14:26] And they whittle it down not with not
[1:14:29] with, you know, blessed are the meek and
[1:14:33] blessed are the pure in heart.
[1:14:35] Blessed are those who pursue
[1:14:38] righteousness, you'll be filled. No, not
[1:14:42] even, you know, pray for your enemy.
[1:14:46] Love your enemy. Excuse me. I think it
[1:14:48] says love your enemy.
[1:14:51] It says do good to those who hate you.
[1:14:56] love, you know, love your enemy, do
[1:14:58] good, pray for them who who persecute.
[1:15:00] Not even that. Way beyond that. Way
[1:15:03] beyond that. That not way that that's a
[1:15:05] that's a portion. And that does help a
[1:15:07] whittling down because there are those
[1:15:08] who don't even want to love their enemy.
[1:15:10] And they're not even going to put that
[1:15:11] into practice.
[1:15:13] But then Jesus gets to my flesh is meat
[1:15:16] and my blood is drink.
[1:15:20] What is it today? What's the hard saying
[1:15:23] today? So now in Moses ministry numbers
[1:15:25] 13 here's a here's a hard saying the
[1:15:28] Lord spake unto Moses saying thou men
[1:15:30] that they may search the land of Canaan
[1:15:32] which I give unto you unto the children
[1:15:34] of Israel of every tribe of their
[1:15:36] fathers shall ye send a man everyone a
[1:15:38] ruler among them. Send these men. We're
[1:15:40] at the border of Canaan. Send men into
[1:15:43] the land. Find out if what you know what
[1:15:45] I've been telling you is true. What the
[1:15:46] Lord's been tell is it does it have milk
[1:15:48] and honey?
[1:15:50] That just start there. Does it have milk
[1:15:53] and honey? Focus on is my I'm sending
[1:15:55] you to a land with milk and honey. Focus
[1:15:57] on that. Send these men. The Bible
[1:15:59] actually lists them. I put them up here.
[1:16:00] It lists them over a dozen verses or so,
[1:16:03] but the Bible lists them. And if you'll
[1:16:04] notice on the second line there, Hosa,
[1:16:07] that's Joshua. But Moses after Joshua
[1:16:10] comes back,
[1:16:12] he changes his name from Hosa, which is
[1:16:14] salvation,
[1:16:16] to Jehoshua. I'm not even pronouncing it
[1:16:18] right, but Joshua, which is God is
[1:16:23] salvation.
[1:16:25] And he changes that name because of what
[1:16:27] Joshua says when he comes back from the
[1:16:30] land. He saw everything else everybody
[1:16:34] saw. Caleb and Joshua weren't blinded.
[1:16:37] And then they came back and they saw
[1:16:38] grapes. Caleb and Joshua saw the
[1:16:40] Amalachites, saw the Canaanites, saw the
[1:16:43] sons of Anoch, the giants. They saw all
[1:16:45] of that. And they also saw the milk and
[1:16:48] the honey and the grapes. They saw it
[1:16:50] all. But they came back with a different
[1:16:52] view
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; on what God was able to do in that land
[1:16:57] than what the other than the other 10
[1:16:58] had.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; But they did see it. Bible says, and I'm
[1:17:03] fast forwarding uh numbers here,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; they told him and said, 'We come into
[1:17:07] the land where thou sendest, and surely
[1:17:09] it flowestth with milk and honey, and
[1:17:11] this is the they even brought back the
[1:17:14] fruit of it. This is the fruit of it.
[1:17:16] They Bible say I think they they were
[1:17:17] carrying uh bundles or uh what was the
[1:17:20] word?
[1:17:22] A bundle of grape. What do you call
[1:17:23] that?
[1:17:25] Maybe it's just a bundle. Cluster. I
[1:17:28] think it's cluster in the Bible.
[1:17:29] Anyways, nevertheless, notice they this
[1:17:32] they brought back the fruit.
[1:17:33] Nevertheless, the people be strong that
[1:17:35] dwell in the land and the cities are
[1:17:37] walled and very great. Moreover, we saw
[1:17:40] the children of Adch there. The
[1:17:42] Amalachites dwell in the land of the
[1:17:44] south. The Hittites, the Jebusites, the
[1:17:46] Amorites dwell in the mountains, the
[1:17:47] Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the
[1:17:50] coast of Jordan. And Caleb stilled the
[1:17:52] people before Moses and said, "Let's
[1:17:54] go."
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; You see, you understand what happened
[1:17:56] here? They all saw walled cities and
[1:17:59] giants and Amalachites and Canaanites
[1:18:02] and we're, you know, we're grasshoppers
[1:18:04] and they're a great number. And Caleb's
[1:18:06] perspective was, let's go right now.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; That's how you ought to be, saints. It's
[1:18:12] a hard here's the hard saying. You're
[1:18:15] able to go up into the land and overcome
[1:18:17] it. You're a That's a hard saying. Do
[1:18:20] you believe it? Are you able to go this
[1:18:22] morning and receive the Holy Ghost?
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Or is your flesh too
[1:18:27] great?
[1:18:29] Or is the battle going to be too great?
[1:18:33] I don't think so. Okay. Now, and Caleb
[1:18:35] still he said, "Let's go and possess it.
[1:18:37] We're a well able to overcome it." But
[1:18:40] the men that went up with him said, "We
[1:18:42] be not able
[1:18:45] against the people, for they're stronger
[1:18:46] with we." The Bible says they brought up
[1:18:48] an evil report. That's also worded as a
[1:18:51] murmur, a slander, excuse me, of the
[1:18:53] land which they had searched unto the
[1:18:55] children of Israel, saying, "The land
[1:18:57] though which we have gone to search it
[1:18:58] is is a land that eateth up the
[1:19:00] inhabitants that thereof, and all the
[1:19:02] people that we saw in it are men of
[1:19:04] great stature." And they begin to
[1:19:06] murmur, and they begin to evil report.
[1:19:09] Maybe they would say something like
[1:19:10] this. He said we got to eat his flesh.
[1:19:13] He said we got to drink his blood. and
[1:19:15] I'm just not willing. You know, I'll go
[1:19:16] far, but I'm just not willing to do
[1:19:18] that. But what you lack is a revelation
[1:19:21] of what he meant when he said, "Eat my
[1:19:22] flesh and drink my blood." He said, "The
[1:19:25] flesh profitth nothing, but the spirit,
[1:19:27] it gives life to your soul."
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; But they got they got twisted in their
[1:19:33] mind. They thought it was their fight.
[1:19:39] And if you think today it's your fight,
[1:19:43] you're already starting off, you know,
[1:19:45] lo in a losing. You got no shot. You,
[1:19:48] you know, you've lost the battle
[1:19:49] already. And they they murmur. They
[1:19:51] said, "We can't do it." Numbers, I'm
[1:19:52] fast forwarding. They murmured. And and
[1:19:54] God judges them for that. You know, he
[1:19:56] says, "I can't believe you're you're not
[1:19:58] going to go. None of you this generation
[1:20:00] are going to go because you've brought
[1:20:01] up an evil report of the land." And he
[1:20:04] condemns essentially an entire
[1:20:06] generation. And he says, "Now go back to
[1:20:09] the desert in the wilderness where you
[1:20:11] need to wander." That's what he said is
[1:20:14] this. Listen, this message, you know,
[1:20:16] the Bible is the Bible, okay? We just
[1:20:18] can't quote love, you know, love. We
[1:20:19] love everybody and we just can't quote.
[1:20:21] We got to preach the truth of the Bible,
[1:20:23] which is when they weren't ready to go
[1:20:25] and get the Holy Ghost, he said, "Get
[1:20:27] back to the desert. Get molded again
[1:20:29] until you're ready to come into the land
[1:20:31] with faith and possess it foot by foot,
[1:20:34] step by step, the land which God gave
[1:20:36] you. He sent him right back to the
[1:20:38] desert. Let's read it now. He says, "And
[1:20:40] the Lord sh said, I will do unto, excuse
[1:20:44] me, unto
[1:20:47] all this evil generation that are
[1:20:48] gathered together against me in this
[1:20:50] wilderness. They shall be consumed, and
[1:20:52] there they shall die, and the men which
[1:20:54] Moses sent to search the land, who
[1:20:56] returned," and made all the congregation
[1:20:58] to murmur against him. Notice they
[1:21:00] brought the evil report, and they made
[1:21:03] all the congregation believe that evil
[1:21:05] report. And today it's the same. Today
[1:21:08] people think, "Well, you you know, you
[1:21:09] can get the Holy Ghost, but it's really
[1:21:11] not enough to change you."
[1:21:13] People will say that it is enough to
[1:21:16] change you. How do you know, Brother
[1:21:18] Steve? Well, I I'm a testimony that the
[1:21:20] Holy Ghost is more than enough to take a
[1:21:23] vile sinner and change him into a son of
[1:21:25] God.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Tell me it's not enough. And and
[1:21:29] bringing up a slander upon the land.
[1:21:31] Even those men that did bring up evil
[1:21:32] report upon the land died by the plague
[1:21:35] before the Lord. But Joshua, did I miss
[1:21:38] I missed a little bit here.
[1:21:40] We're just going to keep going. But
[1:21:41] Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb the
[1:21:43] son of Japuna, which were of the men
[1:21:45] that went to search the land, lived
[1:21:48] still.
[1:21:50] There was a plague that fell on them
[1:21:53] that didn't believe the hard saying.
[1:21:57] Well, it's it's the same kind of hard
[1:21:59] saying today.
[1:22:00] There's Amalachites and battles and and
[1:22:03] trouble and trials and and and and you
[1:22:06] know there's there's all that and
[1:22:08] there's Amalachites and there's walled
[1:22:09] cities,
[1:22:11] there's fortresses,
[1:22:14] but God gave it to you. There's also
[1:22:16] this. There's also this.
[1:22:19] Repent and be baptized and you shall
[1:22:22] receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:24] Now, what are you gonna look at? Acts
[1:22:26] 2:38, you shall receive the gift of the
[1:22:28] Holy Ghost. Are you going to look at I
[1:22:30] got problems and I got amalachites in my
[1:22:32] life. I got nervousness. I got I got
[1:22:35] fleshly battles. I have desires. I have
[1:22:37] this and I have that. What are you going
[1:22:39] to look at? He promised you you have the
[1:22:42] land for your possession. And we still
[1:22:44] today look at the Amalachites, the
[1:22:46] walled city, and we think we can't do
[1:22:48] it. No, you can't do it. God already did
[1:22:51] it. Just step forward. Eat of the flesh,
[1:22:54] the body word of the son of man. Is that
[1:22:57] a hard saying?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Okay, brother Bam said this. Now
[1:23:02] listen closely. When the word test came,
[1:23:04] when they went over and seen the
[1:23:06] opposition so great, the greatest
[1:23:08] opposition they ever seen, the
[1:23:09] Amalachites was 10 times their size,
[1:23:10] they said, "We look like grasshoppers.
[1:23:12] Their fences or their cities are so
[1:23:14] walled so they can run a chariot around
[1:23:16] it." Yeah, it's real simple. Wonder if
[1:23:19] they could seen a little preview if it
[1:23:20] might have helped them. Well, here's
[1:23:21] here's the preview. We're going to march
[1:23:23] around it seven times.
[1:23:25] though there's a whole bunch of chariots
[1:23:26] that you could walk, you know, drive
[1:23:28] around the city at the top of the wall.
[1:23:30] We'll just march around it, blow our
[1:23:31] trumpets, and it'll just come down.
[1:23:34] I mean, that's what they should have
[1:23:36] been thinking. As hard as they can go
[1:23:38] around the wall, see, of their cities,
[1:23:39] why their spears are way out, they're
[1:23:41] long, and they're giants. We look like
[1:23:42] grasshoppers. We can't do it.
[1:23:48] A great challenge was presented to these
[1:23:50] spies.
[1:23:51] They're bigger. They're more in number.
[1:23:53] They're incredible. They have incredible
[1:23:54] large see it's a hard saying but it must
[1:23:57] be separated from the truth of God's
[1:24:01] word not mixed with it separated from
[1:24:03] the truth of God's word otherwise doubt
[1:24:05] enters in and and and you know you just
[1:24:07] think you can't do it but God just
[1:24:09] requires one thing of you I gave you
[1:24:12] this land believe that I gave it to you
[1:24:16] that's really all he requires just
[1:24:18] believe I gave it to you these men saw
[1:24:20] the same thing and Caleb was not even
[1:24:22] like hey let's kind Let's get ourselves
[1:24:24] ready and and let's, you know, build our
[1:24:26] army together. Caleb said, "Let's go up
[1:24:29] right now and at once and let's go to
[1:24:32] that city." What is it, saints, that
[1:24:34] today, if you need something, why don't
[1:24:36] you just go up right now and, you know,
[1:24:38] maybe get out of a little order a little
[1:24:40] bit in the service. Go up right now and
[1:24:42] claim the land that God has given you.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; My and Moses, you know, Moses actually
[1:24:49] stood in the gap for the people. This is
[1:24:50] one of the two times he he goes and and
[1:24:52] and and the Lord wants to just
[1:24:54] completely wipe him out. And Moses says,
[1:24:56] "Listen, if we do that, then, you know,
[1:24:58] the Egyptians will say that you weren't
[1:25:00] great enough to take him into the land,
[1:25:03] so don't do that." And he stands, you
[1:25:05] know, it was the spirit of Christ in
[1:25:06] Moses standing in the middle and
[1:25:09] interceding. And really, God knew that
[1:25:11] Moses had and he be to test his own
[1:25:14] spirit in Moses. Will it intercede for
[1:25:17] these people? And it intercedes yet
[1:25:19] today. It certainly does. Bible says
[1:25:23] this in verse 18. The Lord is
[1:25:24] long-suffering. He's of great mercy. He
[1:25:26] forgives iniquity and transgression and
[1:25:29] by no means clears the guilty, visiting
[1:25:32] the iniquity of the fathers upon the
[1:25:33] children unto the third and fourth
[1:25:35] generation. And brother Steve just lost
[1:25:37] his place. Okay.
[1:25:41] Third and fourth generation. Pardon, I
[1:25:42] beseech thee, the iniquity of this
[1:25:44] people according unto the greatness of
[1:25:46] thy mercy. And as thou has forgiven this
[1:25:48] people from Egypt even until now, you
[1:25:51] please Lord, pardon them, the iniquity.
[1:25:54] You have great mercy and pardon, you've
[1:25:56] forgiven him from Egypt until now. And
[1:25:58] the Lord said, I have pardoned
[1:26:01] according to thy word. Then he says
[1:26:04] this, but my servant Caleb, because he
[1:26:06] had another spirit with him, he hath
[1:26:07] followed me fully. Him will I bling into
[1:26:09] the bring into the land where into he
[1:26:11] went, and his seed shall possess it. Now
[1:26:14] the Amalachites and the Canaanites dwelt
[1:26:16] in the valley. So what happened here was
[1:26:17] God heard the evil report and he he
[1:26:20] began to send a plague and actually the
[1:26:22] 10 men died and I can't remember how
[1:26:24] many more but they died because of their
[1:26:26] evil report and the slander they brought
[1:26:28] upon the land and the slander wasn't
[1:26:31] there's giants there the slanders the
[1:26:33] slander was were not able
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; that was a report on the land
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; were not able to overcome it well you're
[1:26:43] not looking correctly
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; it's not you're not able. Our God is
[1:26:47] more than able to overcome it. So now he
[1:26:50] puts a plague and then God tells him
[1:26:53] tomorrow turn and get to the wilderness
[1:26:55] by the way of the Red Sea. This is the
[1:26:57] hard saying,
[1:27:00] go back to the wilderness.
[1:27:02] Maybe he's just he's dealing with Israel
[1:27:04] now as a nation. We understand that. So
[1:27:06] he's dealing with them as a whole. Even
[1:27:09] though Caleb and Joshua and Moses were
[1:27:11] there and part of that group, he's
[1:27:12] dealing with them and he said, now he
[1:27:13] doesn't say go back to Egypt, but he
[1:27:14] says you're going to wander in the
[1:27:16] wilderness. And I had never seen this
[1:27:18] until the other day. He tell Moses tells
[1:27:21] the people what God told him. Listen,
[1:27:23] you got right to the border. You
[1:27:25] rejected that I could do it. I had to
[1:27:28] send a plague. Now go by the you're
[1:27:29] going to do some wandering for a while.
[1:27:31] 40 years until that generation is wiped
[1:27:34] out. And Moses told these things, verse
[1:27:37] 39, unto all the children of Israel, and
[1:27:38] the people mourned greatly, and they
[1:27:40] rose up early in the morning. They
[1:27:41] gathered them to the top of the
[1:27:42] mountain, saying, 'Lo, we be here. We'll
[1:27:44] go up to the place which the Lord hath
[1:27:46] promised, for we had sinned. So they got
[1:27:48] to the top of the mountain overlooking
[1:27:50] Canaan. And they and they s, you know,
[1:27:52] they mourned all night, and they
[1:27:53] grieved, and they were sad, but they
[1:27:55] said, "We'll just go up.
[1:27:59] We'll go up anyway."
[1:28:02] You know, they did this. I I I I
[1:28:04] probably read this before. I didn't even
[1:28:05] know that. I forgot this. They went and
[1:28:08] they went to the top of the mountain.
[1:28:10] It's kind of like they repented a little
[1:28:11] bit and and they said, "You know what?
[1:28:13] We're sad. The Lord told us that we
[1:28:15] could do it and we he sent a plague and
[1:28:18] and and and you know, we we're really
[1:28:20] sad about that. We mourned all night,
[1:28:22] but now we're just going to go up to the
[1:28:24] top and let's go down there. We've
[1:28:25] sinned. We we now repent." And
[1:28:29] this is the saints. This one, if you
[1:28:31] talk about a hard saying, this is a hard
[1:28:33] saying. Listen what happened.
[1:28:36] Moses said, "Wherefore now do you
[1:28:38] transgress the commandment of the Lord,
[1:28:41] but it shall not prosper.
[1:28:44] Don't do it." He's already told you, "Go
[1:28:46] back. You're not even ready to get it.
[1:28:48] Go back. Go back to the wilder. You have
[1:28:51] some wandering to do in the wilderness."
[1:28:53] And sometimes, you know what we do is
[1:28:54] say, and I could make this a type, and
[1:28:56] it's not a perfect type, but just bear
[1:28:59] with me. Sometime God has a little more
[1:29:01] molding into your life that needs to be
[1:29:03] done and you reject that molding that
[1:29:06] he's doing and you say, "I'm just going
[1:29:08] to go anyways." And and God's trying to
[1:29:10] work on your life a little bit. He's
[1:29:12] trying to mold you and you say, "No, I'm
[1:29:14] just going. I don't need this moldy. I
[1:29:16] can bypass this test."
[1:29:19] No, you can't, saints. He's going to
[1:29:21] break you down, like it or not. So, they
[1:29:25] say, "Listen, we're just going to go in
[1:29:26] now." And Moses is like, "What are you
[1:29:29] doing? It's not going to prosper."
[1:29:33] Go not up, for the Lord is not among
[1:29:37] you,
[1:29:38] that you be not smitten before your
[1:29:40] enemies. Now, there's a whole message, a
[1:29:42] group of messages titled presuming.
[1:29:44] Prophet of God takes this exact
[1:29:46] scripture
[1:29:47] and Moses says, "For the Amalachites,
[1:29:49] the Canaanites are not there before you
[1:29:50] are there before you, excuse me, and ye
[1:29:52] shall fall by the sword because you're
[1:29:54] turned away from the Lord. Therefore,
[1:29:56] the Lord will not be with you, but
[1:29:59] we have the scripture. I think it's
[1:30:02] verse 43. So, Moses tell he's not going
[1:30:05] to be be with you. But
[1:30:09] they presumed to go up into the hilltop.
[1:30:12] Nevertheless,
[1:30:14] the word, the ark of the covenant of the
[1:30:16] Lord and Moses departed not out of the
[1:30:19] camp. So, the word did not go with them.
[1:30:23] So they went they went to fight their
[1:30:25] own battle with the maybe they they went
[1:30:27] to try and get the Holy Spirit, you
[1:30:30] know, by just doing good.
[1:30:34] Ain't going to happen. You can't be good
[1:30:36] enough. You can't do good enough.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. So they went
[1:30:39] verse 45 44. They presumed to go, but
[1:30:42] the the the ark did not depart. Do we
[1:30:45] have the next verse there? Verse 45.
[1:30:48] Praise the Lord. Then the Amalachites
[1:30:50] came down and the Canaanites dwelt in
[1:30:52] that hill and smoked them and
[1:30:53] discomforted them even unto Hora.
[1:30:57] They lost this group that decided we're
[1:31:00] just going to go anyway and maybe reject
[1:31:02] a little bit of chastisement of the
[1:31:04] Lord.
[1:31:08] He presented a difficulty to him,
[1:31:12] something hard, a hard saying, something
[1:31:14] difficult to understand. And the Lord
[1:31:16] does the same thing in in the book of
[1:31:19] John. He presents something that's so
[1:31:22] difficult for us to wrap our minds
[1:31:24] around. But it doesn't matter how
[1:31:26] difficult it is for you. You must accept
[1:31:28] the hard saying. But he said, "Eat my
[1:31:31] flesh and drink my blood."
[1:31:34] That's too hard, Brother Steve. I don't
[1:31:35] even understand it. And to this day, the
[1:31:38] Catholics believe, no offense if there'd
[1:31:40] be one here this morning, that their
[1:31:41] priest takes the body of Jesus Christ
[1:31:44] and and he and he transforms it, I
[1:31:46] forget the word, transubstantiation
[1:31:48] maybe. Anyways, so he takes the body of
[1:31:51] Jesus Christ and they they they form it
[1:31:53] into the little wafer that the people
[1:31:55] and they believe that they're literally
[1:31:58] eating the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:01] If you read 50 years in the books of
[1:32:03] Rome, uh 50 years in the church of Rome,
[1:32:06] the book, I encourage you to read it.
[1:32:08] There's an interesting story where a
[1:32:10] priest is talking about that and and he
[1:32:12] does the transsubstantiation or whatever
[1:32:14] it is and he and he puts the body of
[1:32:16] Jesus Christ, he believes into the waper
[1:32:18] and then, you know, some of it falls on
[1:32:19] the ground and a rat rocks through the
[1:32:21] church and eats it and now he's just
[1:32:23] completely disheveled.
[1:32:25] But it just doesn't even make sense.
[1:32:28] It's a type, saints. It's not a literal
[1:32:31] body of Jesus Christ, but you must
[1:32:33] commune with him in a type and and you
[1:32:36] must feed on the body word of the Jes of
[1:32:40] Jesus Christ.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; You see the difference? Okay. So now he
[1:32:45] thins them down here in in John chapter
[1:32:47] 6. I just want to read a little portion
[1:32:49] of that.
[1:32:51] Okay. I verse 48 of John chapter 6. I am
[1:32:54] the bread of life. That bread of life.
[1:32:57] Your fathers did eat mana in the
[1:32:59] wilderness and are dead. They ate bread.
[1:33:02] He was even bread from heaven. They're
[1:33:04] dead.
[1:33:05] This is the bread which cometh down from
[1:33:07] heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[1:33:09] not die. What bread? This bread. He's
[1:33:11] point to himself. You must eat this and
[1:33:14] not Now, now he's so deeper. His saying
[1:33:17] is so deeper than just pointing to his
[1:33:19] actual fleshly body, but he's pointing
[1:33:22] to the body word, the spirit also that's
[1:33:25] in him. And he says, "I'm the living
[1:33:28] bread."
[1:33:29] The next verse, he says, "I am the
[1:33:31] living bread which came down from
[1:33:33] heaven. If any man eat of this bread,
[1:33:35] he'll live forever. And the bread that I
[1:33:37] will give is my flesh which I will give
[1:33:39] for the life of the world."
[1:33:42] The Jews strove, the Bible says
[1:33:46] among themselves, "How can this man give
[1:33:48] us his flesh to eat?"
[1:33:50] What?
[1:33:52] Here's the hard saying.
[1:33:57] Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[1:33:58] verily, I say unto you, except you eat
[1:34:00] the flesh of the son of man and drink
[1:34:02] his blood, you have no life in you."
[1:34:05] This is the words of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:07] Christ.
[1:34:08] Yeah. Blessed are the meek are his
[1:34:10] words. And blessed are the poor in
[1:34:12] spirit. Those are his words. Blessed are
[1:34:15] those who seek righteousness. You
[1:34:17] shouldn't lust. Those are all his words.
[1:34:20] You know, I forgive you. Your sins are
[1:34:22] forgiven. Those are his words. These are
[1:34:24] also his words. You can't discount or
[1:34:27] throw out what you don't like. That's
[1:34:29] what they did. You throw out one word,
[1:34:31] you just throw his entire ministry out.
[1:34:34] So he now he's saying you must eat flesh
[1:34:36] and drink blood. And it's a hard saying.
[1:34:37] If you don't, you don't have life in
[1:34:39] you. Whosoever eateth my flesh and
[1:34:41] drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life,
[1:34:43] and I will raise him up on the last at
[1:34:44] the last day. For my flesh is meat
[1:34:46] indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
[1:34:49] And some of you have like maybe never
[1:34:51] heard this before and you're like,
[1:34:52] "Brother Steve, this is a hard saying."
[1:34:56] You know, Paul goes on and explains it.
[1:34:58] I'm not going to explain it today
[1:35:00] because I'd rather you get in the Bible
[1:35:01] and let the Holy Spirit just lead you.
[1:35:04] Are you saying we have to eat his flesh,
[1:35:07] drink his blood?
[1:35:10] He that eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth
[1:35:11] my dwelleth blood dwelleth in me and I
[1:35:13] in him. As the living Father hath sent
[1:35:16] me, and I live by the Father, so is he
[1:35:18] that eateth me, even he shall live by
[1:35:21] me. This is that bread which came down
[1:35:24] from heaven. Not as your fathers did eat
[1:35:25] mana and are dead. He that eateth of
[1:35:28] this bread shall live forever.
[1:35:32] There's his discourse on the bread of
[1:35:33] life. And there's the hard saying. And
[1:35:37] there's the thing difficult to
[1:35:39] understand about the next verse is what
[1:35:41] we read at the beginning. He he's in the
[1:35:43] synagogue when he says this. And then
[1:35:45] his disciples began to murmur. And when
[1:35:47] Jesus knew that his disciples murmured,
[1:35:49] he said unto them, "Does this offend
[1:35:51] you?
[1:35:53] Are you offended this morning?
[1:35:57] Why do we or do we not understand it
[1:36:00] this morning?
[1:36:02] Why would he do that?
[1:36:04] Why wouldn't he just explain the whole
[1:36:06] thing fully? Listen, I'm talking to
[1:36:08] you."
[1:36:08] But he has to say something harsh
[1:36:11] because he sees goats and Judas's mixed
[1:36:15] in the group. And so the hard sayings go
[1:36:18] forward and and and the group that you
[1:36:21] know that just kind of like what oh it's
[1:36:23] so hard Lord to understand and you know
[1:36:26] so many people are going to leave but
[1:36:29] Jesus know that only the sheep can
[1:36:32] handle the hard sayings in this message.
[1:36:37] Now, brother Bandham says this. What do
[1:36:39] you think a smart intellectual person
[1:36:41] would thought? I imagine the priest that
[1:36:44] had him in the temple was very, very
[1:36:45] ashamed of them having him there. To
[1:36:47] think that a man would stand up and say
[1:36:49] a thing like that, except you people eat
[1:36:52] my flesh and drink my blood said this is
[1:36:54] a human vampire.
[1:36:57] See, eat my flesh and drink while he's a
[1:36:58] cannibal. You good thinking people will
[1:37:01] you get away from such a lunatic as
[1:37:02] that? He never explained it. He just
[1:37:05] said it. He did it to stumble them, to
[1:37:11] separate his sheep from goats. He did it
[1:37:15] to throw them off.
[1:37:18] Nobody wanted to cooperate with they had
[1:37:20] no cooperation from then on. See, you
[1:37:23] know, the same thing has happened today.
[1:37:26] Exactly the same thing. A very type of
[1:37:28] the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:37:30] Hard sayings has gone forth and we have
[1:37:33] to cope with them as believers. We can't
[1:37:36] say they're not hard. I, you know, many
[1:37:38] would just get an arrogant attitude a
[1:37:39] little bit. Oh, I just believe it,
[1:37:40] brother Steve. Man, you know, you're
[1:37:42] you're kind of missing it if that's your
[1:37:43] attitude. These are hard saying saints.
[1:37:45] This is, you know, this isn't just milk
[1:37:48] that we drink. This is tough. The
[1:37:50] message is not for babies. The message
[1:37:52] is not for sissies and wimps. These are
[1:37:55] hard things that go forward.
[1:37:58] And we accept them and we say, "Lord, I
[1:38:01] don't get it all. I can't understand it
[1:38:02] all, but I'm I can't. Where to whom am I
[1:38:05] going to go? Where else would I go? You
[1:38:08] alone have the words of eternal life.
[1:38:11] Don't let the devil trick you into
[1:38:13] thinking you have to explain all the
[1:38:15] message or or be able to understand it
[1:38:17] in your mind. It's not even meant for
[1:38:19] that. God doesn't even want you to fully
[1:38:21] understand it. He wants to present it to
[1:38:23] you and you go, "Lord, I don't know, but
[1:38:25] I believe it. I can't explain it, but
[1:38:28] I'm here and I'll be here till the end.
[1:38:30] I don't care what you tell me. I don't
[1:38:31] care if you tell me to go eat crumbs,
[1:38:33] I'll do it. Whatever you tell me. It's
[1:38:35] hard, but I believe it.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; See, that's true sheep that will stand
[1:38:41] there and take it.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, the mystery works.
[1:38:47] It's working today. And the Bible says
[1:38:49] in second Thessalonians
[1:38:52] says this, "Only he who now letth will."
[1:38:55] He's allowing it until he be taken out
[1:38:57] of the way. It's being allowed. is being
[1:38:59] permitted, the mysteries working. And
[1:39:02] then shall the wicked be revealed, whom
[1:39:03] the Lord shall consume with the spirit
[1:39:05] of his mouth, and shall destroy with the
[1:39:07] brightness of his coming, even him whose
[1:39:09] coming is after the working of Satan
[1:39:10] with all power and signs and lying
[1:39:12] wonders, and with all deceivleness of
[1:39:14] unrighteousness in them that perish,
[1:39:17] because they receive not the love of the
[1:39:18] truth, that they might be saved. Excuse
[1:39:20] me for going so quickly through that.
[1:39:22] And he's just talking about this mystery
[1:39:24] and it's there and it has a purpose and
[1:39:26] and and and it's going to work until the
[1:39:28] Holy Spirit goes and allow you know it's
[1:39:31] permitted to work during that time. And
[1:39:32] then it says this and for this cause God
[1:39:35] shall send them a strong delusion that
[1:39:38] they should believe a lie. Today a
[1:39:40] strong delusion is sent.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; It's being sent saints and it's a it's a
[1:39:46] delusion that that word means it's a
[1:39:48] deceitful strong means power. So, it's a
[1:39:51] deceiving power that is spent and God
[1:39:54] sent that. Why? He sent it in John. He
[1:39:56] said, "Here's a deceiving power. Eat my
[1:39:58] flesh." But the disciples looked at it
[1:40:00] and go, "I don't get it. I don't
[1:40:02] understand it all, but I believe I'll
[1:40:04] eat your flesh and drink your blood if
[1:40:05] you tell me to."
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; But now, a deceiving power goes forward
[1:40:10] in the world and it's trying to infect
[1:40:12] your mind today.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Certainly, it is.
[1:40:18] I don't want to call anyone out to say
[1:40:20] something like, you know, raise your
[1:40:21] hands if you're not being affected by
[1:40:22] the deceiving power. But there is. And
[1:40:25] so it's it's there. It's a strong one.
[1:40:28] It's deceitful. And it says things like,
[1:40:31] "Oh, you know, he was just a good man.
[1:40:34] He he prophesied a little bit, but he
[1:40:36] got off at the end of his message."
[1:40:39] Would you say that about Jesus? Oh, he
[1:40:40] did a lot of miracles and the 5,000. But
[1:40:43] at the end, the whole the whole, you
[1:40:45] know, drink blood and eat flesh. Other
[1:40:48] daddy was good. See, it's a strong
[1:40:50] delusion. It's a deceiving power. It's
[1:40:53] trying to deceive you. Stick with it,
[1:40:55] though. Stay with it. Ask God to help
[1:40:58] you. Stay with it. Don't be drawn away
[1:41:01] to the tightful lust of knowledge of
[1:41:04] this day. See, the same Satan subtle
[1:41:07] spirit that deceived Eve in the
[1:41:09] beginning is coming in and saying,
[1:41:10] "You're not surely die. You can just be
[1:41:12] a good person. No, no, no, saints.
[1:41:15] You've got to follow the prophetic
[1:41:17] ministry of today with all your body,
[1:41:19] soul, and spirit.
[1:41:22] We saw what the saying was. And
[1:41:24] disciples murmured. They grumbled. And
[1:41:27] the Bible says this, they it's like to
[1:41:29] to say something in a low tone,
[1:41:32] to confer secretly together. It's used
[1:41:35] of those who discontentedly complain.
[1:41:38] Does this shock you? Does it offend you?
[1:41:42] See, we know, you know, love your enemy
[1:41:43] doesn't offend you. Do good to them
[1:41:46] doesn't offend you. Pray for them and
[1:41:47] despitefully use you. And that doesn't
[1:41:48] offend you. Dress and hair kind of
[1:41:50] offends a few people, but you know, it's
[1:41:51] just scripture. You can just see it.
[1:41:55] But the things that offend us
[1:41:58] might be this. I put a few hard sayings
[1:42:00] up here. We're going to close. It's 12
[1:42:02] o'clock. We got a few hard sayings in
[1:42:04] the message.
[1:42:07] And I I put them up here. I I felt the
[1:42:09] Lord led me into this. So I I don't even
[1:42:11] know what I'm doing this morning to be
[1:42:13] honest. I when I when I stand up here, I
[1:42:15] don't even understand what I'm
[1:42:17] preaching. To be honest,
[1:42:19] I just ask the Lord would help me take
[1:42:21] these words and put them a certain way
[1:42:23] so that the people can receive them and
[1:42:25] then be encouraged
[1:42:28] to continue on. Keep going, saints.
[1:42:30] Don't give up yet. Don't let the strong
[1:42:32] delusion of this age deceive you. And
[1:42:34] don't think you can conquer the land all
[1:42:36] by yourself. And don't think you can
[1:42:37] just go grab onto the Holy Ghost and
[1:42:39] take it, which you can in a way. But
[1:42:41] what you got to do is allow God to help
[1:42:43] you with that because it's a great land.
[1:42:45] It's full of Amalachites and and
[1:42:47] Canaanites and the sons of Anakin walled
[1:42:49] cities. But you're more than able if
[1:42:52] Jehovah
[1:42:54] becomes part of your salvation.
[1:42:58] See, Joshua went up there salvation.
[1:43:01] But then when he got to the land and he
[1:43:03] came back and said, "Listen, we're more
[1:43:06] than able if we take God with us."
[1:43:10] And Moses said, "That's right. Your name
[1:43:12] is now Jehovah salvation." Let me tell
[1:43:15] you, you're more than able to receive
[1:43:17] the Holy Spirit today. And for him to
[1:43:19] transform your thoughts, your desires,
[1:43:21] your your even ideas, your purpose in
[1:43:23] life to take to the token over your
[1:43:25] family. You're able to do that if
[1:43:28] Jehovah the Savior goes with you.
[1:43:32] Brother Ram says, "This seems like it's
[1:43:34] the hardest thing for people to get into
[1:43:36] their head that the Holy Spirit leads.
[1:43:42] Sons and daughters of God are led by the
[1:43:44] spirit of God. Not bishops and
[1:43:46] cardinals,
[1:43:49] not bishops and cardinals and so forth.
[1:43:53] sons and daughters,
[1:43:56] not pastors and song leaders, not
[1:43:58] deacons and trustees,
[1:44:02] Aidens and Evelyn's,
[1:44:05] Bellas and Lexas,
[1:44:10] Samuels and Chloe's, sons and daughters
[1:44:13] are led. That's the hardest thing you
[1:44:15] get in your head. You're led by the
[1:44:18] spirit. That's a hard saying, Brother
[1:44:19] Steve. I've been walking my life and
[1:44:21] tripped and fell and made wrong
[1:44:23] decisions. How about this, sons? You got
[1:44:25] to get this in your head. You're led.
[1:44:27] Your wrong decisions. Jonah made the
[1:44:29] wrongest just defy God decision you ever
[1:44:32] made. And the people of Nineveh
[1:44:34] worshiped big fishes. And Jonah jumped
[1:44:36] into the the water or thrown actually
[1:44:38] into the water. He gets eaten by a big
[1:44:40] fish and he gets spurted on the beach by
[1:44:43] a god of Nineveh, the big fish. And he
[1:44:45] walks out the prophet out of the mouth
[1:44:47] of the god of the big fish. And it
[1:44:50] started out with I'm not going to
[1:44:51] Nineveh. Those are wicked people.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; But you see, sons of God are led by the
[1:44:57] spirit of God. Oh God, do you believe it
[1:45:00] now? You're led by the spirit. Accept
[1:45:02] that into your mind.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Give me a church that so complete. This
[1:45:06] is a hard saying.
[1:45:08] A It's a tough one. Give me a church
[1:45:10] that's so completely anointed with God
[1:45:13] till their every action and move is thus
[1:45:14] sayith the Lord. Walk in that shakina
[1:45:16] glory. I'll show you a Messiah standing
[1:45:19] upon the earth.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; That's a hard saying, brother Kurt. I
[1:45:23] mean, that's a hard one. Can you say
[1:45:26] amen to that this morning? That that if
[1:45:28] you surrender to God,
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; you're a Messiah walking on. No, brother
[1:45:32] Steve, you're making me a God. But Jesus
[1:45:35] said this, you call them gods who the
[1:45:37] word of the Lord came to.
[1:45:41] That's cuz you are. You're his hands and
[1:45:42] feet today. You're a Messiah on earth
[1:45:45] stand. That's a hard saying. Why? Cuz
[1:45:47] you're looking at you.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; That's your problem. You're looking too
[1:45:50] much at you. That's a hard saying,
[1:45:53] brother Steve. Yeah, it's a hard saying,
[1:45:54] but you got to believe it.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Must believe that you're a son and
[1:45:58] daughter of God. You're a Messiah here
[1:46:02] on earth.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; You got to accept that. It might make
[1:46:05] you happy like Isaiah said. Okay, here's
[1:46:07] another hard one.
[1:46:11] took water out of the river. Moses did.
[1:46:13] Poured it upon the bank and every drop
[1:46:15] of water throughout Egypt turned to
[1:46:16] blood. What could do that but God? What
[1:46:19] was it? He was so completely surrendered
[1:46:22] to God's anointed word till he was the
[1:46:25] Messiah.
[1:46:27] You got to say amen to that. You can't
[1:46:29] but say amen to that. And don't you're
[1:46:31] not saying amen to Moses is God. You're
[1:46:33] not saying that. You're saying amen. He
[1:46:35] was so surrendered to God that God could
[1:46:37] take control of his being and use him as
[1:46:40] as his voice on earth.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; I believe he could use you, Brother
[1:46:45] Steve. Oh, really? He can't use you?
[1:46:48] He can't use you. He can absolutely use
[1:46:51] you. He's used you many times, by the
[1:46:54] way. Some of you don't know it, but you
[1:46:56] you you call me out of the blue or give
[1:46:57] me a scripture and I'm like, "Oh, thank
[1:46:59] the Lord. Needed that right there." I'll
[1:47:01] never forget, brother Glenn a few years
[1:47:02] back sent me a scripture. I mean, I was
[1:47:05] literally thinking along the line. Boom.
[1:47:08] Listen, I told you what happened in
[1:47:10] Peru. I'm 30,000 feet in the air above
[1:47:12] Cusco and I'm I'm studying the
[1:47:14] scripture.
[1:47:16] Isaiah 33 30-33 and I'm showing Matias
[1:47:19] and we're talking about it. Man, all of
[1:47:22] a sudden, the brother in Phoenix an hour
[1:47:24] later sends me the exact scripture.
[1:47:27] Brother Steve, read Isaiah 30-33.
[1:47:30] 33 30 to 33. What was that? Oh, it's
[1:47:33] just a brother sending a scripture to a
[1:47:35] brother. No, no, no. He was so
[1:47:36] surrendered to God in Phoenix.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; That God took control of his being and
[1:47:40] he became a Messiah. That's a hard
[1:47:43] saying. I know. I get it. It's hard.
[1:47:45] It's a truth nonetheless. Okay. Now, the
[1:47:48] prophet of the day is this word.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Can I just say Okay, that's right. The
[1:47:55] prophet today is not all these here
[1:47:56] different. Here's a Methodist prophet, a
[1:47:58] bat prophet, Pentecostal prophet, all
[1:48:00] kinds of prophets around the cross of
[1:48:02] country, but still remains. There's one
[1:48:03] true prophet,
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:48:07] You got in your mind, we're all kind
[1:48:08] like, uhoh, where's my Steve going with
[1:48:09] this? That's right. Jesus Christ, and he
[1:48:13] is the word. That's right. He is the
[1:48:15] word, the anointed word of the hour. It
[1:48:18] wasn't a man. It was a man who just
[1:48:20] happened to be the chosen man of God who
[1:48:22] happened to be standing there on the
[1:48:24] river when God came and confirmed a
[1:48:26] commission.
[1:48:28] It's a hard saying, but it's true.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Now, he says this. See, this is
[1:48:33] humility. Now, I'm just your brother
[1:48:37] by the grace of God. But when the angel
[1:48:39] of the Lord moves down, it then becomes
[1:48:41] a voice of God to you.
[1:48:45] Maybe it if I offend it. Well, see, some
[1:48:48] are offended.
[1:48:50] They're still offended today. They go
[1:48:52] and leave and they don't they're missing
[1:48:53] it. But hey, maybe they're not cho I'm
[1:48:57] not gonna By the way, this is an
[1:48:58] important teaching real quick. I'm way
[1:49:00] beyond. Forgive me. This is an important
[1:49:03] teaching. Don't pluck them up before
[1:49:06] their time. So, you see people leave and
[1:49:10] they get distracted and they kind of
[1:49:12] like, I'm just left. I I'm not part of
[1:49:14] it anymore. That's fine. But don't don't
[1:49:16] pull them up before their time because
[1:49:19] it might just be a moment. It might be a
[1:49:20] time. It might be an and they and God
[1:49:22] might have a way to work that back. So
[1:49:24] you don't know. Don't pluck them up
[1:49:25] before their time. It's a very important
[1:49:28] teaching. It's scriptural. Don't pull
[1:49:29] them up before their time. If they're a
[1:49:31] weed, you just let the let the fruit
[1:49:33] manifest and and God will do the the
[1:49:35] plucking up and the and the separating
[1:49:37] in his time. Okay. Now he says, see, if
[1:49:40] I offended you by saying that, forgive
[1:49:42] me. But I felt that might have been
[1:49:44] resented. But I'm God's voice to you.
[1:49:47] See, I say that again. That time was
[1:49:49] under inspiration. See, and I felt bad
[1:49:51] about the first time. But but it
[1:49:52] repeated it. Now, see, I can say nothing
[1:49:55] in myself. But what he shows me, I say
[1:49:57] it, you believe it. And watch what
[1:49:58] happened. See, he did, you know, and he
[1:50:00] goes on there. But listen, when Sister
[1:50:02] Kathleen was there and the brother was
[1:50:04] speaking, he was God's voice to Sister
[1:50:07] Kathleen.
[1:50:09] He didn't even say what he said that she
[1:50:12] what what she heard. He didn't even say.
[1:50:14] But God used a person and and took the
[1:50:18] voice that the words and and conformed
[1:50:20] them to to be what she needed.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; What was it? It was God speaking.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; It's a hard This is a hard saying right
[1:50:27] here. If you can receive this, praise
[1:50:29] God.
[1:50:31] Last one. Have the musicians come. Now,
[1:50:34] I wasn't the one. This is the last one
[1:50:36] that appeared down on the river. I was
[1:50:38] only standing there when he appeared.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performs these
[1:50:43] things. Pay attention. We give all the
[1:50:45] glory to God. This ain't brother Steve
[1:50:46] preaching this morning. In reality, I'm
[1:50:48] if if there's a mistake made, it's me.
[1:50:50] Aside from that, I'm just trying to
[1:50:52] yield myself to God and say, "God, where
[1:50:54] do you want me to go?" Okay, listen. And
[1:50:58] fortells these things that happens as
[1:50:59] perfect they are. I'm only the one
[1:51:01] that's near when he does it. I was only
[1:51:04] a voice that he used to say it. It
[1:51:06] wasn't what I knew. It's just what I
[1:51:08] surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:51:10] through. Notice a humility just giving
[1:51:13] it to the Lord. Listen, I'm standing
[1:51:15] here, but but it's all on the Lord. He's
[1:51:17] the one who do it. It isn't me. It
[1:51:19] wasn't the seventh angel. No, it was the
[1:51:20] manifestation of the son of man. It
[1:51:23] wasn't the angel, his message. It was
[1:51:25] the m mystery that God unfolded. It's
[1:51:28] not a man. It's God. The angel was not
[1:51:31] the was not the son of man. He was the
[1:51:33] messenger from the son of man. The son
[1:51:35] of man is Christ. He's the one that
[1:51:37] you're feeding on.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; There's the answer this morning. If
[1:51:43] you're listening to me and and you you
[1:51:44] felt something quicken in your spirit
[1:51:46] and you thought, man, that's truth. What
[1:51:48] it is is him. You're feeding on your
[1:51:50] feet. You're actually eating. You're
[1:51:52] eating that he you're not feeding on a
[1:51:54] man a man. His words will fail. But
[1:51:56] you're feeding on the unfailing
[1:51:59] body word of the son of man
[1:52:03] this morning. what you fed on wasn't
[1:52:05] brother Steve's words I pray but you fed
[1:52:08] on the the words of the Lord Jesus
[1:52:11] Christ and it quickened your spirit and
[1:52:12] you go but but it also made you go oh
[1:52:15] it's a hard saying brother Steve it must
[1:52:17] make you do that it's got to be that
[1:52:20] hard because if it's not that hard it
[1:52:22] won't actually separate the goats and
[1:52:25] you want to know by the way you do want
[1:52:28] to know that you're here these are hard
[1:52:30] sayings but they're true
[1:52:35] body, word of the son of man. What
[1:52:36] you're feeding, what you eat, what you
[1:52:39] drink, when you open your Bible, and
[1:52:41] when you come to church, and when you
[1:52:43] fellowship one with another, you begin
[1:52:44] to feed on him in your brother or
[1:52:48] sister, in the Bible, in the message, in
[1:52:51] the tapes, you're actually doing feeding
[1:52:53] there. If you haven't fully fed fed
[1:52:57] fully on every word to give yourself
[1:52:59] strength to fly above all these
[1:53:01] denominations and things of the world.
[1:53:04] If you haven't full fed fully on every
[1:53:07] word. See that word will give you
[1:53:09] strength to fly above everything creeds
[1:53:12] things of the world. He says will you at
[1:53:15] this time do it? Would you if you
[1:53:18] haven't fully
[1:53:20] now would you do it?
[1:53:23] I don't know why the Bible
[1:53:27] words it like this in John chapter 6. Do
[1:53:29] we have that last slide? John, this is
[1:53:32] John 6
[1:53:34] 66.
[1:53:39] At this point, many of his disciples
[1:53:41] turned away and deserted him, no longer
[1:53:44] walked with him. These are hard sayings.
[1:53:46] The message it's it's it's tough,
[1:53:49] saints.
[1:53:51] It's strong and we love it.
[1:53:56] I love it.
[1:53:58] I think we love it. We We It's hard, but
[1:54:01] we Where else are we going to go? To
[1:54:03] whom am I going to go, Brother Donald?
[1:54:05] Tell me who I'm going to.
[1:54:08] Do you believe you're led by the spirit
[1:54:09] of God? Do you believe you can surrender
[1:54:12] fully to him and become a little Messiah
[1:54:13] here on earth? Do you believe when you
[1:54:16] feed you're actually eating the body
[1:54:19] word of the son of man? Praise the Lord.
[1:54:22] Stand with me this morning.
[1:54:33] On my prayer list, I have this thing.
[1:54:38] Give you a little secret.
[1:54:41] In the name of the Lord Jesus, Satan
[1:54:42] will not get a hold of this. I give you
[1:54:45] a little secret. I say, "Lord,
[1:54:48] teach me the message, the word, so that
[1:54:51] I can rightly present it to the world.
[1:54:55] If I don't know it, I can't present it.
[1:54:58] If I don't have virtue, I can't give
[1:54:59] virtue.
[1:55:01] I want him to teach me so purely that I
[1:55:05] walk out of these doors and I run into
[1:55:06] somebody nominal Christian, complete
[1:55:09] unbeliever, that I know exactly how to
[1:55:11] handle and present him.
[1:55:14] That's what I want. Just teach me. Amen.
[1:55:18] Take up your cross.
[1:55:21] Oh, take up your cross
[1:55:26] and follow Jesus.
[1:55:32] Take up your cross.
[1:55:43] Don't be ashamed
[1:55:48] to say that you know
[1:55:55] the cross.
[1:55:57] Take up your cross.
[1:56:05] Take your cross
[1:56:10] and follow Jesus.
[1:56:16] They have
[1:56:22] everything.
[1:56:27] Don't be ashamed
[1:56:32] to say that you know
[1:56:39] the cross.
[1:56:41] of your cross
[1:56:47] Jesus.
[1:57:03] All
[1:57:06] anywhere,
[1:57:11] King of Kings,
[1:57:14] Lord of Lords,
[1:57:17] right?
[1:57:23] And throughout
[1:57:26] eternity
[1:57:30] I'm going to praise
[1:57:33] him
[1:57:36] and forever
[1:57:39] more
[1:57:41] I will praise
[1:57:44] you.
[1:57:48] Oh
[1:57:50] Jesus.
[1:57:55] Oh
[1:57:59] well,
[1:58:09] right.
[1:58:18] eternity.
[1:58:22] I know his praise
[1:58:30] forever
[1:58:39] one more
[1:58:43] as a river.
[1:58:46] Amen.
[1:58:48] Amen.
[1:59:02] I fall
[1:59:07] with you.
[1:59:14] There
[1:59:17] is Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:59:33] Come
[1:59:36] to
[1:59:45] the
[1:59:48] heart.
[2:00:08] our
[2:00:13] holy one.
[2:00:29] Amen.
[2:00:39] And we
[2:00:45] soul
[2:00:49] for
[2:00:57] He had
[2:00:59] the master
[2:01:02] in
[2:01:06] our
[2:01:09] Merc
[2:01:24] Oh,
[2:01:29] so
[2:01:39] the river.
[2:01:53] Hallelujah.
[2:02:01] the mountain
[2:02:09] soul
[2:02:11] of
[2:02:21] his father
[2:02:28] is
[2:02:30] the last
[2:02:49] day
[2:02:53] of God. Let
[2:02:56] us devour our heads for a moment.
[2:02:59] You should do this.
[2:03:02] I feel sweet this morning.
[2:03:06] Some of the sayings that I read talked
[2:03:09] about are hard. They're different.
[2:03:14] They're especially in this day and age,
[2:03:16] they're way a strong departure from the
[2:03:20] norm.
[2:03:22] But with the spirit here, he can talk to
[2:03:26] you if you don't understand something.
[2:03:28] You're having a hard time with
[2:03:29] something.
[2:03:32] He can help you to understand it. I can
[2:03:36] he can
[2:03:38] I can speak or we can talk and only God
[2:03:40] can give revelation that's required.
[2:03:43] But while he's here, if you have a need
[2:03:46] or if you'd like help with
[2:03:48] understanding,
[2:03:50] his heart's saying, just even believing
[2:03:53] that you're able, just slip your hand up
[2:03:55] to him. Nobody's looking around.
[2:03:59] Thank you
[2:04:01] this morning. Let's bow our heads
[2:04:02] together. Heavenly Father, Lord, you saw
[2:04:05] the hands that went up
[2:04:08] that didn't board you could see down
[2:04:09] into the heart of the need.
[2:04:12] And I don't doubt said things that
[2:04:14] weren't correct for sure that worded
[2:04:16] differently. So I repent of that. But
[2:04:19] Lord, while your spirit's here,
[2:04:23] Lord, we don't repent of any word that
[2:04:25] was spoken. I think that's why he's
[2:04:27] pleased this morning.
[2:04:30] It's your word.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; While he's here, Lord, would you go into
[2:04:33] hearts
[2:04:35] maybe that are struggling with
[2:04:36] understanding or need help? Would you
[2:04:39] speak to them, Lord? Would you speak to
[2:04:41] my heart and give me more understanding?
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Help me to be able to be a good
[2:04:46] ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ here
[2:04:49] on earth. So surrendered completely to
[2:04:51] you.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; That there's almost no difference.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, so that's what we desire. When
[2:04:58] people look at us, they don't see us,
[2:05:00] but they see so much of the Lord Jesus
[2:05:02] Christ that they can't help but desire
[2:05:06] to be identified with him. That's being
[2:05:09] a true ambassador of the Lord Jesus.
[2:05:11] Help us, Lord, to teach us and each one
[2:05:13] who's struggling with a question or a
[2:05:15] hard saying, something difficult to
[2:05:18] understand. You Lord, give us grace to
[2:05:21] just believe it. If you never show us
[2:05:23] the understanding, if you desire to
[2:05:26] teach us, we want to be taught.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; We desire this. Ask you to be with us.
[2:05:32] We thank you and we love you. Yes,
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; we so appreciate your word for being
[2:05:38] with us this morning. In Jesus name we
[2:05:39] pray. Amen. And if you desire to come
[2:05:42] forward this morning, the Zachary Madair
[2:05:46] the will be your nephew Donald
[2:05:51] of course grew up in and around this
[2:05:54] church and still battling from the
[2:05:56] shooting that happened last weekend and
[2:05:59] got shot recovering from that. So,
[2:06:02] somebody felt it on their heart to make
[2:06:04] it a blanket. If you'd like to come down
[2:06:05] and lay hands on it, we'd love you all
[2:06:07] come down. We'll come down here and
[2:06:09] spread it out so everybody can lay a
[2:06:11] hand on it and touch and send it back to
[2:06:13] him and allow not allow. Ask God to take
[2:06:16] just to take a situation. In Nehemiah,
[2:06:20] it says something like this. But Satan
[2:06:22] desired for evil, God turned it into
[2:06:25] good. So that's what our prayer will be
[2:06:28] that Satan desiring to take our friends
[2:06:31] life, our family members
[2:06:55] of Lord,
[2:06:58] yes, I do know the circumstances, a
[2:07:00] little bit of this young men, but
[2:07:03] Father, I set that aside now that and I
[2:07:06] come according to your word of God, your
[2:07:09] promises, Lord, that you just made to
[2:07:11] us, made known Aresh to us, Father God.
[2:07:14] Lord, what on this earth, Lord, we're
[2:07:16] called to be who you are, Father God.
[2:07:19] Lord, all we are is your hands and we're
[2:07:21] your feet. We're your mouth. We're your
[2:07:23] eyes. May the Holy Spirit of God go. And
[2:07:25] Lord, I know I'm standing next to a man
[2:07:28] and lady. The Lord has been delivered of
[2:07:31] the same thing as these young men is
[2:07:33] going through. So, Father God, just say
[2:07:36] that I know that you're a prayer answer.
[2:07:38] God, I know it. I've seen and I witness
[2:07:40] that. May the Holy Spirit of God, Lord,
[2:07:43] through the compassion of your brother,
[2:07:45] your children, Lord, go and Lord Jesus,
[2:07:48] when this blanket, when this young man
[2:07:50] wraps himself in this blanket, may the
[2:07:53] Holy Spirit of God not make it seem like
[2:07:56] it's not just the blanket, but may he
[2:07:58] know that it's you, Father God, and may
[2:08:02] look to you, the word of God, Lord
[2:08:04] Jesus, forgetting all that's done in the
[2:08:06] past, Lord, press on to the mark of thy
[2:08:08] calling in Christ Jesus.
[2:08:10] We ask this and we ask your Holy Spirit
[2:08:13] go and bless his family and Lord Zachary
[2:08:17] make him the man that you want to be in
[2:08:19] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Lord bless you.
[2:08:25] Leave us in the song.
[2:08:28] We may be dismissed. We may rest in his
[2:08:30] presence
[2:08:32] here. I encourage you to do that.
[2:08:40] is
[2:08:42] the river
[2:08:47] that flows
[2:08:49] from me.
[2:08:58] There
[2:09:00] is
[2:09:02] love
[2:09:07] that frees
[2:09:10] my soul
[2:09:12] from sin.
[2:09:18] Come
[2:09:20] to
[2:09:22] the water.
[2:09:27] There is
[2:09:30] a
[2:09:32] supply.
[2:09:38] There
[2:09:40] is
[2:09:42] a river
[2:09:47] that
[2:09:50] shall
[2:09:52] run.
[2:09:56] Of course, surely the presence of the
[2:09:59] Lord is in this place.
[2:10:05] encourage you if you are led by the Holy
[2:10:08] Spirit to lay hands on the one SU or
[2:10:10] whoever
[2:10:12] don't ignore it.
[2:10:20] His mercy and his grace
[2:10:24] had the privilege of sitting behind this
[2:10:26] book
[2:10:28] for many years.
[2:10:33] I'm not that lovely son myself, but
[2:10:38] I know when the spirit's moving and
[2:10:42] I couldn't hardly say anything. I just
[2:10:45] had to be quiet and all these years
[2:10:47] going to give him reverence. I do. I do.
[2:10:53] Truly the presence.
[2:10:55] I make a confession to the Holy Spirit.
[2:10:57] Make a confession to you. Brother Steve
[2:11:00] has our resignation letters for not only
[2:11:03] trusting but soul. I ask you to forgive
[2:11:07] me and I ask God to forgive me. I'm not
[2:11:09] a quitter. I'm not going to quit. God
[2:11:13] forgive me for doing that if I have
[2:11:15] hindered the moving of the Holy Spirit.
[2:11:18] But with those few little things, God
[2:11:20] knows my heart. Forgive me. God forgive
[2:11:23] me. I want everything to be right.
[2:11:27] Surely the presence of the Lord is in
[2:11:29] this place.
[2:11:31] Oh, surely
[2:11:34] the presence
[2:11:45] power.
[2:11:52] I can hear the precious angels
[2:12:08] of the Lord
[2:12:10] is in this place
[2:12:13] in the midst
[2:12:15] of his children.
[2:12:18] The Lord
[2:12:20] said he would be.
[2:12:23] It doesn't take
[2:12:26] very many.
[2:12:28] He can be just two or three.
[2:12:33] And I've been that same sweet spirit
[2:12:38] that I felt
[2:12:40] all time before.
[2:12:44] Surely
[2:12:46] I can say
[2:12:48] walking with the Lord.
[2:12:54] Surely
[2:12:56] the presence
[2:12:58] of the Lord's body dismiss quietly
[2:13:04] to seek God
[2:13:07] power
[2:13:08] and his grace.
[2:13:13] I can hear the brush of angel wing. I
[2:13:19] see glory
[2:13:22] on his face.
[2:13:24] Surely
[2:13:27] the presence
[2:13:29] of the Lord
[2:13:31] is in this place.
[2:13:34] There's a holy ar
[2:14:03] Heat. Heat.
[2:14:13] His
[2:14:26] mighty power.
[2:14:36] Your pressure
[2:15:01] situation.

[2:15:13] a few
[2:15:32] intercession.
[2:15:42] Lord
[2:15:46] Jesus.
[2:16:07] Lord,
[2:16:26] glory.
[2:17:01] And I know
[2:17:04] we build the filter.
