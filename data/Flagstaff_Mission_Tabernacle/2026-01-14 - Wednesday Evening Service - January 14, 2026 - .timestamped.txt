[16:54] &gt;&gt; Everybody [singing and music]
[16:56] sh
[16:59] [music]
[17:01] is my
[17:04] desire
[17:07] [music]
[17:08] to live
[17:11] for him.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[17:16] &gt;&gt; If you [music]
[17:19] could see
[17:21] where Jesus
[17:23] brought [singing and music]
[17:24] me from to where I am today. [music]
[17:32] You
[17:34] would know the reason [music]
[17:38] [singing] why
[17:40] I love him so [music]
[17:48] you can [singing and music]
[17:54] [music]
[17:55] change.
[17:58] I don't need [singing and music]
[18:00] her strength.
[18:02] It's my it's [music and singing]
[18:10] true to [singing] live
[18:12] for him. [music]
[18:16] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[18:18] I like that part. If you knew
[18:23] &gt;&gt; if you could see where he brought me
[18:25] from,
[18:26] &gt;&gt; then you would know.
[18:28] Amen. I have a quick um I'll call it
[18:30] announcement maybe just something to
[18:32] mention to the body and I know there's
[18:34] those online.
[18:36] Um I put a piece of paper over there
[18:38] kind of by the entry on the little stand
[18:40] and brother Donniey's not here. I'd
[18:42] rather have him do this. But
[18:45] um we had a deacons and trustees meeting
[18:48] Sunday and they're considering
[18:52] a very large
[18:54] uh missionary I don't even want to call
[18:57] it project
[18:59] project regard relating to a vehicle
[19:01] purchase in Zimbabwe
[19:04] and it was brought up well why don't we
[19:06] mention this to the body and let them
[19:09] participate in the vote.
[19:12] in the vote. We're not, by the way,
[19:13] asking for a penny. It's not about that.
[19:15] We have plenty. Um, [music] it's not
[19:17] about that. We're asking for the church
[19:20] to join in with us because it's very
[19:22] large. And so, we we thought we would do
[19:24] that. Brother Donnie mentioned it and
[19:25] [music] we all agreed that's a good
[19:27] idea. Let's bring it forward to the
[19:28] body. That'll be
[19:30] the 25th Sunday. We'll do that vote. Um,
[19:34] it'll just be a hand vote. We're not
[19:36] going to make it real formal. We'll just
[19:38] do it by hand. On the piece of paper
[19:40] that's out there is just some of the
[19:43] questions we asked
[19:45] of the brother and then I spoke to the
[19:47] voice of God representative the other
[19:49] day, Monday I think, and got some more
[19:52] information. And so all the information
[19:54] that we got, we put on that paper so you
[19:56] can make a decision. And we'll mention
[19:58] this again on Sunday. So that Sunday the
[20:01] 25th, you can [music]
[20:03] uh
[20:04] we're a body. And I love the idea when
[20:07] it was brought. I thought that's a good
[20:08] idea. Um, wrench it to the body and let
[20:11] them participate. Anyway, so that's our
[20:14] plan. We have one prayer request. Sister
[20:15] Angie [music] Brown called in. Sister
[20:17] Connie, we have an update on your dad.
[20:21] Okay, I understand [music] that. Okay.
[20:24] He had an infection on his foot he's
[20:26] dealing with. So, but other things also
[20:27] he's dealing with. So, let's go to
[20:29] prayer for these needs. Heavenly Father,
[20:31] we [music] bow our heads before you and
[20:34] we want to tell you how much we love you
[20:35] this morning. Lord, that song echoes my
[20:37] testimony that Lord, if you could see
[20:40] where we come from, if people would know
[20:43] where we came from, who we were before,
[20:45] and then where we are today, that might
[20:48] help them understand how much we love
[20:50] you, Lord. And so, that's our testimony
[20:52] this morning, this evening. And Lord, we
[20:55] present a prayer request for Sister
[20:56] Angie. And we thank you for brother
[20:58] Glenn, the positive report that he got
[21:01] today. Lord, we'd ask you to continue to
[21:02] help our brothers. He goes through this
[21:05] process, this trial that you've led him
[21:08] and allowed him to go through. Lord, we
[21:09] we just want you by his side and sister
[21:11] Karen there [music] with him, Lord. And
[21:14] may you be manifested your glory and may
[21:16] your presence [music] be there with our
[21:19] brother. And may your just ability,
[21:21] Father, to work in the lives of
[21:23] Christians be shown in this [music]
[21:25] process. For Sister Conniey's dad, Lord,
[21:28] for what he's battling and that they're
[21:31] also dealing with as a family. Lord, we
[21:33] ask you to be with them. Minister
[21:34] [music] to them, Lord, for any requests
[21:37] that are on someone's heart this
[21:39] evening, Lord, that didn't get mentioned
[21:40] or maybe they didn't even raise their
[21:42] hand. But the Bible says, you know, even
[21:44] before we ask what we have need of,
[21:47] Lord. [music] So help us never to ask a
[21:49] miss, but just to always, Father, desire
[21:52] and to ask, Father, hoping to be closer
[21:56] to you. And that's what our desire is
[21:57] even this evening. We bring these before
[22:00] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[22:01] Christ. We pray. Amen. Amen. Remember
[22:12] I in the little chorus um

[43:03] before brother Donald was singing right
[43:05] before
[43:07] uh Brother Rolando.
[43:09] Man, I liked it. Sister, bless the Lord.
[43:12] Can we sing that as brother Tom? Maybe
[43:14] we'll start with [music] the chorus and
[43:16] then go to the first verse.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, [singing]
[43:25] oh my soul.
[43:28] Oh my [music] soul,
[43:31] worship his holy name.
[43:34] [music and singing]
[43:37] Oh, sing
[43:40] before.
[43:41] [music] Oh [singing] my soul,
[43:45] I worship the Lord. [music]
[43:52] The sun [music] comes [singing] up. It's
[43:56] a new day all.
[44:00] It's time to [music] sing your song
[44:04] again. [singing]
[44:07] Whatever may [music]
[44:08] pass and whatever lies [singing] before
[44:13] me,
[44:16] let me be Heat. Heat.
[44:18] [music and singing]
[44:24] [music]
[44:25] [singing]
[44:32] Worship is [music and singing] holy
[44:35] name.
[44:41] [music]
[44:43] Oh [singing]
[44:44] my soul,
[44:47] worship his [music] holy
[44:50] name.
[44:54] Amen. It's good to be [music] in the
[44:56] church house on a Wednesday night.
[45:03] The world offers lots of other places to
[45:05] be, but there is no other place to be
[45:09] for a son or daughter of God. If we
[45:11] could bow our heads,
[45:16] Lord Jesus, as you look down upon your
[45:18] children,
[45:23] Father,
[45:26] we know your mercies are great. Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, and this time's been [music]
[45:34] taken. Your children have come out to
[45:37] your house,
[45:40] Lord. We're sheep.
[45:43] We need to be fed.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't just want to be fed once
[45:49] a [music] month or
[45:51] we need fed daily.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[45:56] would you get your servant out of the
[45:58] way? Might you speak to your children?
[46:01] Give them something that nourishes them,
[46:03] that encourages them.
[46:06] Lord, prepares us for these next days
[46:09] ahead.
[46:11] Bless your children, Lord. We ask in
[46:14] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; While we remain standing, if we'd like
[46:19] to open your Bibles,
[46:23] like to turn to Psalm 139.
[46:32] I won't take the time. We're going to
[46:34] begin with just the 14th and 15th verse,
[46:39] but uh
[46:43] I'm looking here
[46:51] in the verses before 14 and 15. There is
[46:56] something. How many have indulged in the
[46:59] past few years watching the chosen?
[47:03] Okay.
[47:08] So, I'm just going to throw this in as I
[47:11] it blessed me as I was reading the
[47:14] entire psalm as I was looking for these
[47:17] two verses 14 and 15. Uh the eighth
[47:21] verse. This is just kind of an extra for
[47:25] you. And see if you remember where this
[47:28] was mentioned in the chosen. If I ascend
[47:34] up into heaven, thou art there. If I
[47:38] make my bed in hell, behold, thou art
[47:42] there.
[47:44] You kind of got a funny look, Caitlyn.
[47:46] Do you remember when that was?
[47:49] When Thomas was so wanting to learn the
[47:53] scriptures and to learn something to
[47:55] catch up with the others. And that was
[47:59] the scripture that Philillip gave him.
[48:03] And
[48:04] it was one of those little nuggets that
[48:06] got pulled out and it's become part of
[48:09] my vocabulary
[48:11] from that because it was so striking
[48:15] uh that even even just for script
[48:19] writers they chose give him that
[48:21] scripture.
[48:23] But coming down to the 14th verse,
[48:27] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[48:31] and wonderfully made.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Marvelous are thy works.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And that my soul knoweth well.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; My substance was not hid from thee when
[48:43] I was made in secret and curiously
[48:47] wrought in the lowest parts of the
[48:50] earth. You may be seated.
[48:55] Curiously, rot.
[48:58] Uh, I don't know how many rot isn't a
[49:02] term that or a word that we normally
[49:05] use. If you look into the language, rot
[49:08] is the past participle
[49:12] for worked.
[49:14] But it's the thing that was built. It
[49:16] was the thing that was created. We were
[49:20] curiously wrought. And when you look
[49:23] into the combining those two words in
[49:26] Hebrew, it's a single term. It basically
[49:29] refers to needle work,
[49:33] crochet,
[49:35] embroidery,
[49:37] weaving. And if you use that, I I want
[49:40] to kind of move our minds to a way of
[49:43] thinking for the scriptures that are
[49:45] coming up after this to think of how we
[49:49] were made. And one of the things that
[49:52] came to mind first when I was reading
[49:54] this because well my grandma, she used
[49:57] to crochet
[49:59] lovely things. The the borders of all of
[50:02] our pillow cases had embro or had
[50:05] crochet around them. Uh all of the
[50:09] little doilies and and covers and
[50:12] everything around her house and
[50:14] henceforth our house were done in my
[50:17] grandma Weber's crochet
[50:21] and it was just taking all and she would
[50:24] kind of free form if she wanted to do
[50:26] designs she knew which knots and which
[50:29] loops and it would make certain shapes.
[50:31] So in her mind
[50:33] &gt;&gt; she had what she wanted to make. and she
[50:37] would maybe take a pattern and then she
[50:40] would adapt it to something else. So if
[50:42] you take that concept how that he looked
[50:47] down at us
[50:49] &gt;&gt; and he curiously wrought us each one of
[50:53] us special each one of us unique for the
[50:56] purpose that he had for it. The other
[50:59] thing that came to mind, Brother Ray,
[51:01] you'll you'll get this, others would,
[51:03] but I know it's something from way in
[51:05] the back. We talked about Navajo rugs.
[51:09] And if you ever looked at those rugs and
[51:11] ever watched one of those weavers, it
[51:14] seems so tedious. There's a rug on the
[51:18] wall at the Cameron Trading Post. It's
[51:20] 12t by 12t. It's a storm pattern,
[51:25] Brother Ray. And the woman who wo it had
[51:30] to know designwise,
[51:34] mathematically wise, how she was going
[51:37] to make over so many over what did they
[51:41] call it? The weapon, the wararf of the
[51:44] two different directions that the the
[51:46] fabric the the yarns go. how she was
[51:50] going to get from down here at this
[51:52] bottom corner
[51:54] &gt;&gt; up to this corner and make everything
[51:57] coincide to create the pattern that she
[52:00] wanted. That is how we were made.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you think
[52:06] &gt;&gt; hundreds and hundreds of hours for this
[52:12] work of love,
[52:14] &gt;&gt; this work of art, this unique creation.
[52:19] That's what we were. You were curiously
[52:24] wrought.
[52:26] Now, in that term, it's and and I kind
[52:30] of belabor the point because
[52:34] our youngsters maybe don't see those
[52:36] hand type crafts before. I'd watch my
[52:40] grandmother for hours just sitting there
[52:43] in her little balls of of crocheting
[52:46] yarn and just working her needles and
[52:49] and doing things over. And I c I could
[52:52] not see what the end product was. Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; All I saw
[52:57] &gt;&gt; was her laboring on it. When you went up
[53:00] to Cameron and the lady Bessie was in
[53:02] the room and she would be weaving every
[53:05] day so that the tourists could see her.
[53:08] You couldn't see the end of the product.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; But she could.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; She knew what that last row was going to
[53:16] be. Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; When she was in the bottom rows,
[53:21] &gt;&gt; you were curiously
[53:24] wrought.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; The term that's used for that. Also the
[53:33] definition is you were intricately
[53:38] curiously rot now intricately
[53:41] and skillfully fashioned
[53:44] like a complex piece of embroidery or
[53:49] tapestry. And tapestry that's something
[53:51] I know absolutely nothing about. And I
[53:54] have seen pictures of those famous
[53:56] tapestries and they will tell stories
[54:00] and and to imagine they started at one
[54:03] end but the entire history that they
[54:05] were trying to tell in one handwoven
[54:09] piece of goods and it all started down
[54:12] here.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Detailed
[54:15] by and I loved how that you know this
[54:19] wasn't my choice of words. amazingly
[54:22] detailed by divine skillful weaver or
[54:27] artisan.
[54:29] And the other thing so and the other
[54:31] term that was used outside of weaving
[54:33] and tapestry was embroidery. And now
[54:36] this is something that young people
[54:38] think well embroidery that's like where
[54:40] a company puts their name on a jacket
[54:42] and it's all done with the stitching
[54:45] and it's you know you can go in and you
[54:47] order it and sister Kathy they have the
[54:49] sewing machines and you program it in
[54:52] and you put the yarns in and it just
[54:55] feeds it through and weaves all those
[54:58] different yarns and all the different
[54:59] designs and bingo here's your
[55:02] embroidery.
[55:04] But in the days when this was
[55:06] translated, in the days of of King James
[55:09] when he commissioned those men, they
[55:10] chose these words back then, that was
[55:14] done by hand,
[55:16] one stitch at a time. And when you had
[55:19] to change colors, you had to and and and
[55:22] they spoke of in in reading about
[55:25] embroidery, what a
[55:29] enormous part of the whole process was
[55:32] selection of color. what color was going
[55:35] to be the background, how you were going
[55:37] to come, how that you would fade from
[55:39] one color into another. There's this
[55:42] whole process. You are
[55:46] wonderfully
[55:47] &gt;&gt; and curiously made.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; True.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; So now from that, I would like to turn
[55:54] over to first Corinthians.
[56:01] I'm sorry. I'm I'm not as adroid with
[56:04] the whole system as brother Steve and
[56:06] and and brother Ryan. There's only going
[56:09] to be two little images that'll be up
[56:12] here tonight and hopefully they will
[56:15] inform you also.
[56:18] Uh
[56:20] first Corinthians
[56:22] 12
[56:25] and we're going to begin here again at
[56:27] the 14th verse.
[56:32] Now, we're talking about being curiously
[56:37] wrought. Correct.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; The And for those keeping track of this,
[56:42] I'd like to give this a title.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; I am not you.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; It takes us all.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; I am not you.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; It takes us all.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here 1 Corinthians 12:14,
[56:58] for the body
[57:00] is not one member but many.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. The body you I am not you.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; But it takes us all.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[57:14] And I thought if you trying to wrap your
[57:18] head around that whole thought of think
[57:20] of it is
[57:22] there is one team but on that team there
[57:26] are many players.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's football or soccer
[57:30] or basketball or lacrosse. I know
[57:34] nothing of lacrosse.
[57:36] There's different players and they have
[57:38] different parts. That's good.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And the other part on the team cannot
[57:43] function. The other part member of the
[57:46] team cannot excel.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; They cannot do their utmost for the team
[57:52] unless everybody
[57:53] &gt;&gt; is doing their part for the team.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; And there are members of a team I know
[57:59] football or used to. So I can look at
[58:03] this and John, there were guys on the
[58:06] team that they were the little guys,
[58:09] they were the fast guys, they were the
[58:11] agile guys, and they did not want to go
[58:14] near the scrimmage line. Their job was
[58:18] to avoid it, to get through it, to get
[58:20] around it, however, to go long for that
[58:24] pass, all of that. But then there were
[58:26] other guys that were just these beasts
[58:29] of young men that were made to be right
[58:32] down on the line to move things around.
[58:37] So they aren't all the same and
[58:40] everybody didn't have the intellect of a
[58:42] quarterback
[58:43] or maybe a a free safety to be able to
[58:47] read everything that's going on on the
[58:49] defense. You know, for those defensive
[58:51] linemen, it's just right here.
[58:54] We are curiously wrought.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; You can't expect to
[59:00] do someone else's job.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; And other people cannot expect to do
[59:07] your job.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; You have a place. I sit there with my
[59:11] guitar and I'm in awe of Brother Ryan at
[59:14] the piano
[59:17] because of the songs he comes up with. I
[59:20] do my part. He does his part. Brother
[59:25] Donald's up here. Sometimes he'll defer
[59:27] to brother I. I'm wanting you to see
[59:29] this applies to us. This is who we are.
[59:32] This is how this church functions.
[59:35] Uh you can go to a school. There is one
[59:38] school
[59:40] mcclentok mcclentok chargers. Ray hoay.
[59:45] But there's a lot of students,
[59:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:48] &gt;&gt; And there's the students that are the
[59:51] eggheheads. And there are the students
[59:54] that are the athletes. And there are the
[59:56] students. They don't have it now. I
[59:58] don't know, Sister Cavity. If they still
[1:00:00] have it, but there were the girls that
[1:00:01] took home ed, a whole block of home ed.
[1:00:05] And they learned how to make patterns,
[1:00:06] and they learned how to sew, and they
[1:00:08] learned how to design things themselves.
[1:00:11] And there were the girls that were in
[1:00:12] the secretarial block. I'm just talking
[1:00:15] from what I know. I'm I'm hoping or
[1:00:18] imagining there's some equivalent in the
[1:00:20] schools today. Uh and and and to just
[1:00:24] talk about how that they're things that
[1:00:27] are similar, but they're the same. When
[1:00:30] I was in high school, we had the
[1:00:33] egghehead geek guys that liked
[1:00:35] technology.
[1:00:37] And you know what we called them?
[1:00:41] Now, first off, what would they call
[1:00:43] them today in the schools? What would
[1:00:46] they call those guys? The IT guys.
[1:00:50] You know, they had their little room
[1:00:51] with all their equipment and they helped
[1:00:53] with the IT and the different rooms
[1:00:55] because that's what their inclination
[1:00:57] was towards. Well, in the old days,
[1:01:01] back when they invented rocks,
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; us, brother Kurt, they were AV guys.
[1:01:09] The audiovisisual guys, they were the
[1:01:12] ones that did the projectors and knew
[1:01:13] how to thread the film and slide
[1:01:16] projectors and opaque projectors. They
[1:01:20] were the audio visual guys. That was
[1:01:22] high-tech. That was it
[1:01:25] 55 years ago.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now they're it guys, but they were
[1:01:31] all made different.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. you go to hear an orchestra.
[1:01:37] There is one orchestra and it is the
[1:01:39] Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra,
[1:01:44] but you have strings,
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; you have brass,
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; you have percussion,
[1:01:52] and then you break the strings out and
[1:01:54] you have the violins and the violas and
[1:01:57] the bass vials, and you go over to brass
[1:01:59] and and and besides brass, you've got
[1:02:02] woodwinds. Don't want to forget you
[1:02:04] there. Well, you've got the woodwinds,
[1:02:05] but it's not just a saxophone. There's
[1:02:08] maybe a couple saxophones and an obo and
[1:02:11] a bassoon. So, they're all orchestra.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; We are here tonight. We are all body.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; But brother Rolando is a piece.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Donald is a peace. Brother Don,
[1:02:27] Sister Darlene are a piece. Amen.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; But we're all Flagstaff Tabernacle.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Does the title out there matter? No. But
[1:02:36] the God we serve matters.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Uh I'd like to just come down. We're
[1:02:44] going to read here through in uh 1
[1:02:47] Corinthians now
[1:02:50] uh down to the 27th verse and just kind
[1:02:52] of comment as we go down through. Want
[1:02:56] to make sure I don't
[1:02:59] Yeah.
[1:03:01] If the foot shall say because I am not
[1:03:05] the hand, I am not of the body. Is it
[1:03:10] therefore not of the body?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Now we know that's that can't be. Now I
[1:03:16] look at it and I think pictures and
[1:03:18] stuff a hand is a magnificent thing.
[1:03:22] What it can do opposable digits. It's
[1:03:26] something that only the other primates
[1:03:29] have in their anatomy to be able to
[1:03:31] grasp something with their hand. So,
[1:03:34] this hand is so unique and really if you
[1:03:37] look at pictures of them and stuff, it's
[1:03:39] such a beautiful thing.
[1:03:42] And then there's feet.
[1:03:45] Stinky fungusy
[1:03:48] feet, you know, and and
[1:03:52] they're down in, you know, they're
[1:03:54] either buried in a shoe or a boot or
[1:03:57] they're down in the dirt all the time.
[1:04:00] And uh we will talk about how that
[1:04:02] sometimes we try, it's kind of like
[1:04:04] making a a sousier into a silk purse.
[1:04:09] You know, people try to fancy up their
[1:04:11] feet and they go get their pedicures and
[1:04:14] things, but that's a whole another
[1:04:15] topic.
[1:04:17] But
[1:04:19] did you know, and brother Chase would
[1:04:22] know about this, when you go and listen
[1:04:25] in enlist in the military back during
[1:04:28] the days of the war, maybe there's other
[1:04:30] exceptions now, if you had flat feet,
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; correct?
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't take you.
[1:04:37] because your feet would not hold up
[1:04:39] under the strain. You weren't fit to
[1:04:44] enter battle and they couldn't afford to
[1:04:46] have you as a liability when you went
[1:04:50] into battle. Your foot might not be
[1:04:53] anything special. It might have those
[1:04:55] gnarly toenails and and all crunched
[1:04:58] together and all you do is shove it down
[1:05:00] in that boot, but I want a good foot.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, if you're if you're part
[1:05:07] of a body,
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; A good foot is a good thing.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; It gives you stability.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't take much to make that
[1:05:16] foot compromised.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; For those of you who remember brother
[1:05:21] Phil Hornac, he uh he got one toe
[1:05:25] chopped off in an elevator. Long story,
[1:05:28] but he lost that toe. And he said it
[1:05:31] took him years. Just a big toe.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Took him years to get his balance back
[1:05:39] cuz that one big knuckly looking digit
[1:05:42] on the end of his foot
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; was kind of the anchor.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; To him being able to balance on his
[1:05:49] foot. So you say, "Oh, all I feel like
[1:05:52] is a big toe.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; You know, it's nothing good to look at
[1:05:56] and they just hide me away. Nobody ever
[1:05:59] sees me cuz I'm just in a boot under a
[1:06:01] sock and a stinky sock. Nonetheless,
[1:06:05] boy, I want that toe there. I want it
[1:06:08] performing like it's supposed to
[1:06:10] perform.
[1:06:13] And if the ear shall say, because I am
[1:06:18] not the eye, I am not of the body. Is it
[1:06:23] therefore not of the body?
[1:06:27] No, it is. And you can't afford not to
[1:06:31] have that eye. You can't afford to not
[1:06:35] have that ear. If the whole body were an
[1:06:38] eye, Sister Pauline,
[1:06:40] the eye.
[1:06:42] If the whole body were an eye.
[1:06:46] Okay.
[1:06:49] Where were the hearing?
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And if the whole were the hearing,
[1:06:56] okay, the ear. If the whole thing were
[1:06:59] an ear,
[1:07:01] where's the seeing? And those are kind
[1:07:04] of gross. Made me think of some of those
[1:07:07] old horror movies, Brother A. That's
[1:07:10] that would be the movie of the ear. The
[1:07:13] ear from the black lagoon.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:07:20] what can that do? What is the benefit of
[1:07:23] having that hearing? Okay. And if we
[1:07:28] went back to the eye, what is the
[1:07:29] benefit? I you know I think of a fly how
[1:07:32] that they show how a fly's eye is
[1:07:34] composed that it's looking through
[1:07:36] basically
[1:07:38] hundreds of prisms and it looks out but
[1:07:40] its brain is made to be able to proc
[1:07:43] that process that and look
[1:07:47] several hundred degrees
[1:07:49] all the way around as it flies. But
[1:07:54] that's not how we're made. that would
[1:07:56] get in the way of the mouth and that
[1:07:58] would get in the way of the nose and it
[1:07:59] would get in the way of the ear. All of
[1:08:02] the other functions that we rely on.
[1:08:05] Thank you, sister Pauline. We don't need
[1:08:07] to be labor that
[1:08:09] uh
[1:08:13] there is a place for each part
[1:08:17] and there is not a redundancy necessary.
[1:08:21] God made us that way. Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; But now hath God set the members
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; members,
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; okay,
[1:08:32] every one of them in the body. And I
[1:08:36] love this phrase,
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; as it hath pleased him.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; And you go, "Oh,
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; exactly."
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; But I'm just an elbow,
[1:08:48] you know, Aiden.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; But it pleased him.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:53] Have you ever been part of something? Uh
[1:08:56] here again, I'll use a football analogy.
[1:09:00] I wasn't the biggest. I wasn't the
[1:09:02] strongest. I wasn't the fastest. But I
[1:09:07] curried the favor of our head coach. And
[1:09:10] when I was on the sideline, Brother
[1:09:12] Kurt, where was I?
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; I was right near that coach. So if he
[1:09:19] called me
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; and you know if if you're a musician and
[1:09:26] you get called on to do what you do uh
[1:09:30] you know even the AV guys they just sat
[1:09:33] in their room during that hour every day
[1:09:36] when they were on the AV staff and they
[1:09:38] just sat there waiting for some teacher
[1:09:40] to say we're watching a movie today and
[1:09:43] I need you to run the projector.
[1:09:46] You just live for that
[1:09:53] as it hath pleased him.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:57] And if there were all one member,
[1:10:04] where were the body?
[1:10:07] Now we can say
[1:10:11] uh
[1:10:19] what what we say with that is that there
[1:10:21] is no way for the body to function
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; if they were all the same. Now, I'm I'm
[1:10:27] going to throw out a little bit from
[1:10:28] Brother Tom because I remember being in
[1:10:30] school and maybe it was just because it
[1:10:33] was the 60s and 70s, but everybody
[1:10:37] wanted to be unique. Everybody wanted to
[1:10:40] be an individual, you know, we wanted
[1:10:43] our hair. We, you know, we wanted our
[1:10:45] look, we wanted our image. When you went
[1:10:48] down the hall in school, people, you
[1:10:50] wanted people to know, you know, he's
[1:10:52] he's got something going for him.
[1:10:55] And in doing that, we all dressed the
[1:10:57] same. We all wore bell bottoms. We all
[1:11:01] wore the same kind of sandals. Uh, you
[1:11:04] know, now you'd say the kids that are
[1:11:06] REALLY INDIVIDUAL, THEY ALL DYE their
[1:11:08] hair green. They all, you know, there is
[1:11:10] no individually at it. Why not be what
[1:11:13] God made you?
[1:11:17] And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I
[1:11:21] have no need of thee. Nor again the head
[1:11:25] to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay,
[1:11:29] much more those members of the body
[1:11:32] which seem to be more feeble.
[1:11:35] Those little things, those little bits,
[1:11:37] the little things that cause problems
[1:11:41] are necessary. They are
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; okay from our school students. Can you
[1:11:46] name the three smallest bones in the
[1:11:49] human body?
[1:11:54] Do you know where they're at?
[1:11:59] Oh, I'm even Sister Dette
[1:12:02] in the ear. They're in the middle ear.
[1:12:05] Okay. It is the malus,
[1:12:08] the incus,
[1:12:11] and the
[1:12:13] uh
[1:12:15] stapus,
[1:12:17] or as they're commonly known, the
[1:12:19] hammer, the anvil, and the sturrup.
[1:12:22] Three tiny little bones on the inside of
[1:12:26] your middle ear that are connected to
[1:12:28] the cacia. And when those vibrations
[1:12:32] come into your ear, those three bones
[1:12:34] move against each other and that is how
[1:12:37] the vibrations are transferred into the
[1:12:40] coccia and that is where we get sound
[1:12:43] from. Okay? It's like so and they're so
[1:12:48] tiny
[1:12:50] and they're hidden away nobody ever sees
[1:12:52] them.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; But one of them not do their job.
[1:12:56] If you've ever met somebody who was
[1:12:59] severely deaf,
[1:13:02] it's a terrible thing. Those things
[1:13:04] aren't working like they're supposed to.
[1:13:08] And so if somebody in this body were an
[1:13:12] incus,
[1:13:14] I want them to do their job.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; I need them to do their job.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] And those members of the body which we
[1:13:30] think to be less honorable, upon these
[1:13:34] we bestow more abundant honor.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; And our uncumbly parts have more
[1:13:41] abundant comeliness.
[1:13:43] For our comely parts have no need,
[1:13:48] but God hath tempered the body together,
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; having given more abundant honor to that
[1:13:55] part which lackth.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; That there should be no sism. There
[1:14:00] should be no division in the body over
[1:14:04] who's what. The idea is that we all work
[1:14:07] together and we complement each other
[1:14:09] and one part makes the other part
[1:14:11] better. If you're a hunter
[1:14:14] and the ear's not working,
[1:14:17] even on a dry day, you aren't going to
[1:14:19] hear that game coming through the brush.
[1:14:22] If the eye, the light of the soul, if
[1:14:25] that's not working,
[1:14:28] there's nothing to warn you of of
[1:14:30] trouble coming. You've got to have that
[1:14:33] eye.
[1:14:39] There should be no sism in the body,
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; but that the members should have the
[1:14:44] same care
[1:14:47] one for another. And whether one member
[1:14:50] suffer,
[1:14:52] oh, here's where it gets right down
[1:14:54] personal. Where one member suffer with
[1:14:58] it
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; or one member be honored,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; all members rejoice with it. Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Now ye are
[1:15:08] ye are this is his pronouncement on us.
[1:15:12] Ye are the body of Christ
[1:15:16] and members
[1:15:18] in particular.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Now I would like to
[1:15:26] and just here as an aside to if we can
[1:15:29] quickly turn to numbers 16.
[1:15:34] This is when dispute came about
[1:15:41] people not being happy with third part
[1:15:43] and wondering why somebody else had a
[1:15:45] different part. Numbers 16:13. And
[1:15:48] you'll recognize this.
[1:15:53] Oh, do I have it right? Maybe I wrote.
[1:15:55] Oh, 16:3.
[1:15:59] Okay, here's the men that confronted
[1:16:01] Moses.
[1:16:03] And they gathered themselves together
[1:16:05] against Moses and against Aaron, and
[1:16:08] said unto them, "Ye take too much upon
[1:16:12] you, seeing all the congregation are
[1:16:16] holy."
[1:16:18] Oh,
[1:16:19] we're all eyes.
[1:16:21] We can all see, but there are some that
[1:16:25] are set for hearing.
[1:16:28] Every one of them, and the Lord is among
[1:16:31] them.
[1:16:32] You take too much upon you, seeing all
[1:16:35] the congregation are holy. Every one of
[1:16:38] them, and the Lord is among them.
[1:16:40] Wherefore then
[1:16:43] lift ye up yourselves above the
[1:16:47] congregation of the Lord.
[1:16:50] Now, lifting up can be done, but
[1:16:52] sometimes seeing somebody lifted up is
[1:16:55] imagined
[1:16:57] because you don't have the place that
[1:16:59] they've got and you want that place and
[1:17:03] I'm I'm not above that either. And the
[1:17:06] Lord has to deal with me and talk to me.
[1:17:09] But I thought we would finish this
[1:17:11] evening maybe with uh a little game.
[1:17:15] Maybe this is something you could even
[1:17:17] moms and dads you could talk to your
[1:17:19] children about because I've taken some
[1:17:22] body parts and I thought if this is the
[1:17:26] body part who in our body fills it okay
[1:17:33] so the first thing was the face. Now I
[1:17:36] also put with the face here the head.
[1:17:40] Now, we know the Holy Ghost is the head
[1:17:44] of this body, but if we have a face,
[1:17:47] there's got to be a head attached. So,
[1:17:49] they they kind of go together. But let's
[1:17:51] take the face, and I'm going to say the
[1:17:53] face of this body is Brother Steve.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Because he is the one that people see.
[1:18:03] He is the one that people acknowledge
[1:18:06] when somebody contacts the church and
[1:18:08] wants to use it for uh a funeral as we
[1:18:12] just had other things. They don't call
[1:18:14] brother Aiden
[1:18:17] even though brother Aiden may be the
[1:18:19] anvil in the ear and he may be the one
[1:18:21] that's transmitting the message to the
[1:18:23] face because it takes both of them. But
[1:18:26] so let's say brother Steve is the face.
[1:18:30] Now, this I I even put on there, these
[1:18:33] are hypothetical assignments.
[1:18:36] Do with them as you would. Now, here's
[1:18:40] my chance to pass out a rose. But then,
[1:18:43] who's the heart?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Because the heart is always beating
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; and you don't always see the heart. You
[1:18:51] can hear the beat. You can feel the
[1:18:53] beat. You know it's there and it's
[1:18:54] serving its purpose. And I'm going to
[1:18:58] say that's sister Danette
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; because she's that life that pushes. And
[1:19:04] I'm also going to include in that, sorry
[1:19:06] Dette, you have to share this, but it's
[1:19:08] with good company. The heart is also the
[1:19:12] prayer warriors.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; They're the ones that
[1:19:17] come down to the altar when there is a
[1:19:20] need and they are earnest. And I will be
[1:19:23] honest, [cough] in the times in my life
[1:19:26] when I have had
[1:19:29] the greatest immediate need,
[1:19:33] I don't know that I ever first called a
[1:19:35] brother.
[1:19:37] I called the women, the prayer warriors.
[1:19:41] I called, and these are names you
[1:19:44] children, a lot of the adults won't
[1:19:45] know. Sister Mabel and Sister Glattis
[1:19:49] and Sister Betty, Sister Judy,
[1:19:53] they were at home and I knew that as
[1:19:57] soon as I got off the phone, they were
[1:19:58] going to be on their knees.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; So I would put them in there as the
[1:20:04] heart,
[1:20:06] just that thing, that driving that keeps
[1:20:08] bringing life to everything. So then
[1:20:11] let's we're talking about the lesser
[1:20:13] parts, the ones that are hidden, the
[1:20:15] ones what who wants to be a liver or a
[1:20:17] kidney.
[1:20:20] Well, that's good, brother Ryan, because
[1:20:22] in my hypothetical assignments,
[1:20:26] the liver and the kidney are evangelists
[1:20:31] because they come in. Remember how
[1:20:33] brother Brandham talked about revival?
[1:20:35] how it stirs the sea up and there is not
[1:20:37] a drop more water in that sea when it's
[1:20:40] in the middle of a storm as when it's
[1:20:42] over and there is a calm but it has
[1:20:45] washed all of the debris out and all the
[1:20:49] debris is on the shore and you don't
[1:20:51] always see the evangelist and you he's
[1:20:53] not to always present but when he goes
[1:20:56] to work it's like that liver and kidney
[1:20:58] it takes all of the bad stuff out of the
[1:21:00] blood and it helps process things and it
[1:21:03] moves around it does its shop and it's
[1:21:05] gone.
[1:21:07] Uh
[1:21:10] I don't know who would you think would
[1:21:11] be a good uh choice for um I and this
[1:21:17] with this I lumped the lungs and the
[1:21:19] stomach and your digestive system
[1:21:22] together.
[1:21:24] Okay. Who would who would you think?
[1:21:27] Now, that's why I'm saying this is uh
[1:21:31] just hypothetical, but I thought it's
[1:21:34] the ley.
[1:21:36] It's the ones that ingest the strength
[1:21:39] and they digest it and they distribute
[1:21:41] it amongst themselves,
[1:21:44] okay? They take in the oxygen into the
[1:21:47] lungs and they provide the living of
[1:21:50] this body. They're kind of the vitality
[1:21:54] of the church. who would be the arms and
[1:21:57] the hands
[1:22:00] and I thought you know the h they're
[1:22:03] kind of the visible active part of the
[1:22:06] body the you know the part you see the
[1:22:10] legs are there the feet are there but if
[1:22:12] you're noting action I would say your
[1:22:15] eye goes to the the arms and uh and such
[1:22:20] first
[1:22:22] and the hands I think it's our young
[1:22:24] families
[1:22:26] They're the ones that are out in the
[1:22:28] community.
[1:22:30] The kids are out there. They're active.
[1:22:32] They compel you. Having kids compels you
[1:22:36] to being part of the activity. You're
[1:22:39] part of the ball teams and you're part
[1:22:40] of the choirs and the stuff at the
[1:22:42] school and everything. That's the part
[1:22:44] they see. And it's the workings of the
[1:22:47] body that the people in the community
[1:22:49] see. So that's why I chose that. And so
[1:22:51] who would be the legs and the feet?
[1:22:57] And I thought
[1:22:59] it's that part established part where
[1:23:03] the strength is that carries the body
[1:23:07] that that
[1:23:09] uh the word would be paramulates
[1:23:13] moves them around and I would say that
[1:23:15] is the pillars in our church that is our
[1:23:18] seniors
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; sometimes times
[1:23:24] they aren't fast,
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; but they're always there
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; and they bear that weight. And then
[1:23:30] here's one that and and maybe here's
[1:23:32] we'll we'll finish with this one little
[1:23:35] part of a quote to read. Uh
[1:23:39] I didn't have an idea. I didn't have a
[1:23:44] anything to suggest. What part of the
[1:23:47] body did brother Brandham say was the
[1:23:49] strongest part of the body?
[1:23:54] shoulders.
[1:23:56] It's that part of the body and
[1:23:58] everything has to work with it to bear
[1:24:02] up those heavy heavy loads.
[1:24:06] So I you know maybe that's just a a
[1:24:10] junction of all the parts of the body. I
[1:24:13] don't know but that would be a good
[1:24:15] discussion. Who is this body's
[1:24:17] shoulders?
[1:24:20] Okay. So, with that, and this was purely
[1:24:24] unintentional, and brother Ryan has been
[1:24:26] laboring over presenting, and you still
[1:24:30] got a third of it left. Uh, Brother
[1:24:33] Steve had asked him to talk about the
[1:24:36] word to the church.
[1:24:38] And I had finished up my notes. I had
[1:24:41] cleaned them all up. And I thought,
[1:24:42] "Wow, brother Ryan's been talking about
[1:24:45] that.
[1:24:47] I wonder if there's any correlation
[1:24:49] between the two. So, here's just two
[1:24:52] paragraphs from the word to the church.
[1:24:55] You can go out there in the forer, you
[1:24:56] can read it. But here he's talking about
[1:24:59] us. He's talking about who you are, your
[1:25:04] responsibility
[1:25:06] to one another, your value to the whole.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; And stay with your pastor.
[1:25:15] See, he's the shepherd and you give him
[1:25:19] respects. He'll lead you through because
[1:25:22] he's smart.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Because he's the face and he's
[1:25:26] goodlooking.
[1:25:28] Because he's a good fisherman.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:25:36] He'll lead you through and because he's
[1:25:39] ordained of God to do so.
[1:25:44] Don't never clan among one or talk make
[1:25:48] yourself clanish. We are one.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; I couldn't say left hand,
[1:25:55] left hand, I'm mad at you.
[1:25:59] I'm going to take you away cuz you're
[1:26:02] not my right hand.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; I can't say that.
[1:26:07] He's my left hand. I want him to stay
[1:26:10] there.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Even Okay. here. And now we're getting
[1:26:14] down even to the tip,
[1:26:18] the little tip of my finger.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Ray and I roofed. You
[1:26:24] know, when a hammer goes the wrong
[1:26:26] place, how important the end of that one
[1:26:29] finger is. Okay? I want to stay right
[1:26:34] there. Every little part of my body,
[1:26:37] stay right there. And God wants us as a
[1:26:41] body of believers to stay right exactly
[1:26:45] with one another.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Right at with being with one another.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; We're a body.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; We are curiously wrought.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; You are special.
[1:26:59] There are parts of the body that mature
[1:27:01] later. Parts of the brain that mature
[1:27:04] later. The free preffrontal cortex of
[1:27:09] the brain doesn't mature till a a child
[1:27:12] is two or three.
[1:27:14] That's why they don't have spatial
[1:27:16] relationships. They don't understand
[1:27:18] time. And sometimes young Christians
[1:27:22] don't have a spatial relationship. They
[1:27:25] don't understand time,
[1:27:29] you know, because it's always when when
[1:27:32] how soon
[1:27:36] It's when
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; it'll be when
[1:27:40] I hope it gave you something to to think
[1:27:43] about. I hope it I hope it gave you some
[1:27:46] purpose,
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; To where
[1:27:52] I don't have to be important,
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; but it's kind of nice knowing that if I
[1:27:58] hold a place, even if it's that one tiny
[1:28:00] tiny bone in the ear, I'm essential.
[1:28:04] Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; If we could bow our heads. Could we
[1:28:06] stand?
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we're looking out at a
[1:28:15] body.
[1:28:17] Lord, we aren't all here tonight. We
[1:28:20] know that there are those, Lord, that
[1:28:23] we're missing tonight. That they're
[1:28:25] every bit as much a part of this body.
[1:28:29] And when they're hurting, we're hurting.
[1:28:33] Lord, I miss my wife. I'm not complete
[1:28:36] without her. We miss Brother Glenn and
[1:28:38] Sister Karen. We miss Sister Sakoro. We
[1:28:43] miss Brother Steven. Lord, and I know
[1:28:45] I'll miss names, but
[1:28:48] they're all part of what makes this body
[1:28:51] complete. They're all part of what makes
[1:28:54] this body work.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] and let us faithfully
[1:29:00] and willingly do our part and be glad
[1:29:05] that it was by your divine purpose
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; that you put us in a place. [snorts]
[1:29:13] Put us where Lord the body can benefit.
[1:29:19] Not just one person, Lord, but for each
[1:29:22] little job that this [music] body does,
[1:29:24] each member of this body, they provide a
[1:29:29] service that the entire body benefits
[1:29:33] [music]
[1:29:33] from. Bless your children tonight, Lord.
[1:29:37] Keep us. Give us the remainder of this
[1:29:40] week. Might it just be glorious. Might
[1:29:43] we find ourselves find you working in
[1:29:46] our lives. Amen.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Letting us be the best member that we
[1:29:52] can be.
[1:29:55] Bless our pastor, [music] Lord. Bless
[1:29:58] his family.
[1:30:00] It's a thankless job.
[1:30:04] We see the good side. We see the face of
[1:30:08] it all. But it's a
[1:30:11] tedious, worrisome job.
[1:30:14] But it's all done out of love because
[1:30:16] you've made us the way we are. Bless
[1:30:20] your children now, we ask. Go with us.
[1:30:22] Keep us safe on the streets around town.
[1:30:25] We pray in Jesus [music] Christ's name.
[1:30:29] Amen.
[1:30:50] I really appreciated that. I don't like
[1:30:53] the part about the face, but I like the
[1:30:56] rest of it. Brother Tom,
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; that's just Yeah, the good fisherman. I
[1:31:00] like that.
[1:31:02] Of course, I look at all of you as
[1:31:04] pillars
[1:31:05] and [music]
[1:31:06] shoulders and strong parts. Speaking of
[1:31:09] strong shoulders, brother Donald, could
[1:31:11] you dismiss us in a word of prayer?
[1:31:12] While he's coming, I was thinking
[1:31:13] [music] of this song. It's I'm so glad
[1:31:16] I'm a part of the family of God.
[1:31:21] Glad I'm a part
[1:31:25] of the [singing] family [music]
[1:31:27] of God.
[1:31:29] I've been washing [singing]
[1:31:32] [music] the mountain
[1:31:34] and cleansed by [singing] his blood.

[1:33:51] dear. Heavenly Father Lord, we just uh
[1:33:54] thankful for you, heavenly father. Lord,
[1:33:58] Lord, what a nice remembrance that we're
[1:34:00] needed, heavenly father. the word that
[1:34:03] devil tries to tell us that we can make
[1:34:06] it on our own and we're not an integral
[1:34:08] part of
[1:34:10] the body of Christ or that we're not an
[1:34:12] integral part of
[1:34:14] this local assembly heavenly fallen Lord
[1:34:17] but you called each and every one of us
[1:34:19] Lord to have a place and a purpose to
[1:34:21] serve you fallen so as the brother
[1:34:24] mentioned if I just had a little moment
[1:34:26] here Lord help me drum drum drum to the
[1:34:29] best of my ability [music]
[1:34:30] to

[1:34:34] something else, have the following,
[1:34:35] Lord, to just help lead and guide each
[1:34:38] one, Lord, to their position, having the
[1:34:40] follow they can just be in tune with
[1:34:43] you, Lord. Whether you're a multi-member
[1:34:46] body, Lord, there's one orchestra, one
[1:34:48] conductor of the inside orchestra, they
[1:34:51] follow, we all want to be looking at
[1:34:53] you, Lord, and just be [music] in tune
[1:34:55] to your movements, Lord. Lord, we ask
[1:34:58] that you would be with each one
[1:35:00] traveling this weekend. Heavenly Father,
[1:35:01] Lord, may it just be a a time of
[1:35:04] fellowship, Lord, a time of rejoicing,
[1:35:06] Lord, a time to go out and rub shoulders
[1:35:09] with other Holy Spirit gracious Lord.
[1:35:13] We're just so grateful for you. Just ask
[1:35:15] that you go and be with us the rest of
[1:35:16] this week as far until we meet again in
[1:35:20] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:35:26] We can sing [music] that third. Is there
[1:35:28] a third verse?
[1:35:33] [music]
[1:35:36] Maybe God bless you. We're going to see
[1:35:40] you this weekend. And his
[1:35:42] [singing and music] wing
[1:35:47] has [music] a heart. We all [singing]
