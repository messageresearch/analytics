And also for her mom who just had heart surgery and needs a healing touch. Also want to remember brother Steve, brother Isaac, brother Carlos, and brother Marcelo as they travel and minister in Peru. It's a long way away, Sister Danette. It's a long way away. Also, Tom Jr. called the little family across from their culdeac. the daddy died and their oldest son is my uh grandson [music] Noah's little friend across the way. So, please remember that family.

And brother Jerry, he doesn't just see your hand. He goes and he goes, [music] "There's Jerry's hand. I know what he's asking for." And I was hoping he would ask. That's our God. So, if [music] we could bow our heads, heavenly father, as we look out at the Wednesday night body, Lord, it's a cold night, Lord. A stormy night, maybe the first one for the year, but we're so glad to be in the church house tonight. Lord, we're so glad for the atmosphere that the musicians have laid down. Lord, we could even feel it in the back room permeating into the back. And Lord, you've come by. Lord, if the music pleases us, we believe that even more so, you're pleased. And we pray that you would look down on your children tonight and be pleased, Lord. And if you would take these requests, please, Father, Lord, for Brother Steve and the men traveling in Peru. [music] Lord for sister Pauline's family. Lord through suffering a hurt. Lord Noah's little neighbor, his buddies surf suffering through a hurt. And tonight, Lord, we pray for our brother Kathy.

Bless our music. Bless our worship, Lord, and might your angels [music] move up and down the aisles this evening. We'll be careful to give you all the praise and all the glory in Jesus Christ's name.

The master callth. Come and dine. Amen. Amen. I was thinking I uh I like giving you little sermons that I enjoy. The last one was the ladies in church age. [music] This one was in ' 65 1031. It's um [music] a power transformation and he preaches it down in Prescat. And so it's a small little group and uh um it it's it's interesting to hear how he ministers when it's just people that he knows. [music] And there was a little lady. Mom, dad helped me remember Sister Pew. She was the one in the wheelchair, wasn't she? So, she was constantly, ever since I moved down there, she was in this wheelchair. And Brother Brandham makes a comment to about her. And he says, you know, he says, "God knows best." He says, "She he she's been prayed for. She believes in healing, but God has her in that wheelchair for a reason." And you know what? I just uh thought, Lord, I don't understand it. I believe everything you said in your word, but you have me here for a reason, and so I'm going to get happy about it. Now, I may have to just learn the same lesson tomorrow, but tonight I'm happy about it. Jesus has a table spread. Amen. Amen. Oh friend [music and singing] of God. [music] [singing] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] Yeah. [singing] Heat. [music] Yeah. Heat. [music] Yeah. [music] [singing] Heat. [singing] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] [singing] [singing] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music and singing] [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] Heat. Heat. [music and singing] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] [singing] Now again [singing] [music] [music] [singing] [music] [music] [singing] [music] Heat. Heat. [singing] Heat. [music] Heat. [singing] [music and singing] Come and die. Oh, come [music] [singing] [music] [singing] [music] You faithful [singing] multitude turn the water into wine [music and singing] to the hungry now. Come and amen. Are we taking an offering this evening? If our brother little come, we'll take up our evening offering. Want to thank the Lord for that. Amen. I uh misspoke myself again. I poor these poor ministers. God knows my heart. And uh I called brother Kathy. I said, "Brother Ryan was ministering tonight, Brother Ryan." So Lord willing, you're still going to minister on Sunday. So [laughter] &gt;&gt; Mitchell, would you pray? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to be in church tonight. Heavenly Father, just ask now that you just be with this portion of the service, Lord, these tithes and offerings, heavenly father, of where you want them to go, Lord Jesus. Ask this now in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And then uh Lord willing, brother Kathy's with us tonight and so I apologize for misspeaking myself and um but uh uh I do do that and God knows all things. Amen. Brother Ryan, uh the little course if if the Lord's Holy Spirit would be how great is our God, how great is his word? Amen. &gt;&gt; While he's starting that, I forgot the notes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Forgive me. Uh there are some construction note paper hearts out on the [music] table in the back that have been made uh for those of you who were here [music] on Sunday for uh all any or all of you to write down an [music] encouraging message, note, memory, scripture for sister Cindy if you could do that. [music] And I can say too, when the re uh prayer request went out last week that I authored to send out for my wife, when [music] people answered, she hasn't even been able to look at her phone, it disturbed something. So when she would hear things come through, she'd go, "You got something else to read to me?" And we had some lovely times with just the encouragements that came from asking for prayer. So [music] this may be big medicine if you could. The hearts are there in the back. Thank you. How great is our God? [singing] How great is his word? [music] He's the greatest one that ever was. Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] [singing] Yeah. Heat. [music] [singing] [music] Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] [singing] of my [music] and he [singing] said, "I believe you. Put your trust in me." Amen. Amen. There's been a special requested uh William and Liberty have a song tonight. So, as they're making ready, it's good to see each one of you. You love the Lord. Amen. You know, maybe one of you young children, can any of you guys maybe think about it and explain to me how big this Red Sea was? And then besides that, just tell me in your words how great it was that it was dry. Does that make sense? So, it's a little I would love to hear maybe and maybe not right now, but I would love to hear how you guys think it was because it was huge. Huge. He lived without fault. To die [singing and music] for the fallen. Hung on a cross. [music] He died [singing] for us all. Many [music] people denied [singing] him and suffered in pain. You say, "How could [singing] they do that?" But we [music] do it every day. What [singing] would he do that for [music] me? He gave his [singing] only son for me to be free. Cuz [singing and music] he really really loves you. You and me. That's why you and [singing] I get to be free. After those three nails, the sorrow [singing and music] and pain of us forever and forever the same. [music] After [singing] three days, he rose from the grave. The people [singing] that denied him saw him standing there that [singing] day. [music] Why would he do that for me? [singing] [music] He gave his only son so we could [singing] be free. cuz he really really loves you [singing] and me. [music] That's why you and I [singing] get to be free. And now [singing] I know that Jesus loves me so. [music and singing] And I'm standing here today. Because he never let me go. Why would he do [singing] that for me? He gave his only son so we [singing] could be free. Cuz he [singing] really really loves you. and me. [music] That's why you and I get to [singing] be free. [music] That's why you and I [singing] get to be free. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for some sheep food? &gt;&gt; If we could stand as we wait for brother Kathy. Wait for what the Lord has put on his heart. Uh I need to be fed. If we could sing Amazing Grace, Brother Ryan, [music] do you know it's grace? &gt;&gt; Have you experienced [music] I've got to believe we've experienced that grace over and over? Oliver's nodding his head. Yes, we have. Over and over and over again. So, we wait upon the word. [music] Lord bless you tonight, saints. Amazing [singing] grace. Oh, how sweet the sound [music] like me. [music] I was lost. [music] [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [singing] [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] [singing] [singing] [music] Yeah. [singing] [music] Heat. [music] [singing] [music] Yeah. Heat. [music and singing] [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise [music] God. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for [music] another opportunity, Lord. Another chance to come worship the name above all names, Lord. the name that that bought our salvation, that that amazing grace, what it paid [music] for. Lord, we love you and we just ask that you would be our guest of honor tonight, Lord. That you would walk [music] these aisles, Father. That you would touch each one. You would keep your hand upon us. And Lord, [music] I ask that you would get me out of the way, Lord. That you would lead and guide me. Have me say what you would have me to say, Lord. Father, anoint our ears to hear, [music] our eyes to see. We just ask that your presence would be with us tonight in Jesus Christ's holy name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. [music] Thank you musicians. It's good to be here. It's always good to come to Flagstaff, see everybody. It always feels like home up here &gt;&gt; and so homely that brother Steve, he said I could have two hours tonight. He said I could go two to three hours. And I said, "Are you sure?" And he said, "They'd love it." So here we are. stuck with it. Um, but it's good to be here. You know, there's there's nothing new that's going to be preached tonight. There's nothing new that's going to be re revealed tonight. We're just going to going to say what he already said. Uh, it I believe in the church age book, it said that that that revelation came to the messenger and then he gave it out and then we're just supposed to say what he said. &gt;&gt; We're just supposed to repeat what's already been given. We don't have anything new to bring. Nothing special. So, we're not here to look at one another, not to be flashy. We're here to to help one another. &gt;&gt; That's what this said. The gospel is the good news. &gt;&gt; That's all we're here to do is to help one another. &gt;&gt; And the brother, he mentioned the message, the the power of transformation. And I was sitting back there and he told that story and it and it just fit in perfectly to the thought that the Lord laid on my heart tonight. It just I I was back there in the study and he started talking. I just whipped around and looked up at the TV and thought that that has to be the Lord. a confirmation. It makes you feel good. Makes this part a little bit easier. &gt;&gt; Um, tonight in the scripture, we'll turn over to Isaiah 64:8. [clears throat] Isaiah 64:8. We'll go to three different scriptures. We'll just stay standing for Isaiah 64:8, though. Ephesians 2:10 will be next, then 2 Thessalonians 1. But Isaiah 64:8 it reads, "But now, oh Lord, thou art our father. We are the clay and thou are potter, and we all are the work of thy hands." Amen. May the Lord bless the reading of the word. You may be seated. And then Ephesians 2:10. Ephesians 2:10 says, "For we are his workmanship." And now another translation if you look into those another translation of that word workmanship there is masterpieces &gt;&gt; says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus. That's the only way that we could be a masterpiece. That's the only way that we could ever come to a perfection. And I don't mean a perfection in the flesh. &gt;&gt; But I mean the blood washing over us in Christ seeing the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them." &gt;&gt; And then second Thessalonians chapter 1 uh the first five verses there says Paul and Sylvanus and Timothus unto the church of the Thessalonians and God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace unto you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meat, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all towards each other aboundeth. He says, "So that we ourselves glory in you and the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure." Now, why is he saying why why are they gloring in those saints there? They're gloring in them because of their patience and their faith in all the persecutions and all the trials. &gt;&gt; And now look at the fifth verse. It says which is a manifest token. He said that their patience and their faith through all the trials and all the persecutions that it was a manifest token. It was an evidence. Now what was it an evidence of? Of the righteous judgment of God. that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which ye also suffer. So their persecutions and their tribulations, every hard time, every trial that they went through, it was just a good sign that God was actually with them, that he hadn't left them. He had not forsaken them. They were not alone. They were not by their yourself. And you know, as I read Isaiah 64:8, I I wondered to myself, why a potter and why clay? But it's more about the process, the making and the molding of what that potter is making. What purpose he has in in in what he's making there. And you know, the potter, he can form the clay in many different ways. He's got a lot of different ways he can use it. He can push on it. He can pull on it. And a good potter usually knows what he's going to make before he ever starts making it. &gt;&gt; He can see the end of it. He has a vision for what that product is going to be and what purpose it's going to serve. &gt;&gt; Now, that clay, I could say, if that clay had a mind of its own, it might think to itself, why am I being pushed and pulled and tugged? &gt;&gt; Why Why is all this happening to me? Why do I have to go through every bit of this? And it might not agree with what's going on in in the clay. I'll call it the clay's life. He might not agree with everything that's going on. He might not have a perfect understanding of why he's going through what he's going through at that very given time. &gt;&gt; But there is a purpose behind what he's going through. &gt;&gt; And you know that clay, he might even look at himself and and see what he's molding into and he might not like what he's turning into. &gt;&gt; He might not understand it. That's like many of us sometimes. You know, the Lord's working on us, working in our lives. He's transforming us. That power of transformation by the blood of Jesus Christ. And sometimes we look at ourselves and we talk so negatively. &gt;&gt; We look at what the Lord is doing. We're looking at his creation. We're looking at his clay. He's the potter. And we we sometimes, let me use the word, we have the audacity to talk negatively about it. Who are you talking negative about? You're talking negative about a son or a daughter of God. That's God's property you're talking negative about. Don't think that you're your own property cuz you're not. You bel if you've given your heart to the Lord, you belong to him. So whatever he sees fit to do, he will do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it's not always easy. &gt;&gt; That clay they what what they do is they put that clay, they put it on the wheel, and the very first thing they do is they center that clay. Think about when you first got put on the wheel. When you first came when you first met the Lord Jesus Christ and he slapped you on that wheel and he started pushing you around a little bit. It was uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; But he had to get you centered. He had to get you to a place where he could work with you. &gt;&gt; You know, if he don't get that clay centered on that wheel and they start spinning that thing and trying to make it and mold it, it'll fly off. &gt;&gt; It won't stay on very long. &gt;&gt; It can't do it. And it's become such a a a cliche thing to talk about in the message because it seems like it's it's a good thing to preach, but it seems like we preach so much about knowing where you come from and knowing who you are and and there's power and and all of those things. Those are all true things. &gt;&gt; None of that's a lie. But if we ever did actually realize where we have came from, &gt;&gt; this self-doubt and this negative talk about ourselves would stop. If we ever realize, we we think how the prophet talked back, how he talked about his first masterpiece about Adam there in the garden, there in that beauty and how he spoke about him. And he said he got lonesome, that first masterpiece, and he said he he had to he had to strike his side and he had to pull a bride out of him. If we could ever think back and realize, if you believe that you are the bride of Jesus Christ sitting here tonight, realize where you've been pulled from. &gt;&gt; You weren't just pulled from the world. You weren't just pulled out of a church, a denominational system, but you were pulled from the Lord Jesus Christ himself. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's how we're able to be masterpieces. &gt;&gt; And that would be the title tonight. God molding his masterpieces. &gt;&gt; And that clay after after he gets it centered on that wheel and they get to making it and they form it into a shape. The next thing is the dry out process. You could call it the dying out process. It's supposed to sit there and dry itself out. all those all those unneeded chemicals that are in the clay at that point, they all have to get dried out. They all have to die out and fall away. Cuz if they don't, the next portion is going in the fire. After you let it sit there, after you let it dry out, then you stick that clay in the fire. And if you've ever researched, if anybody's ever done any of this, if you've ever formed clay or done a pottery class or anything like that, if you put that clay, if you put whatever you formed into the fire too soon and all of that stuff is not out of it, that has to be skewed out of it, it'll blow up. &gt;&gt; Literally, it will blow up. If those chemicals get heated up that's in clay, once you stick it in there, it'll blow up. It'll revert back. You'll have to start over. It'll get broken. because it's not ready for the heat yet. It's not ready for the fire. The prophet tells us many times that you you better know where you're standing. You better know what you're standing on because the devil is after you every day. He's going to challenge you every single day. This is a Wednesday night service. I'm willing to bet many of us have been challenged today. It was probably challenging to get here today. I drove up an hour and 45 minutes and didn't know I was driving into a blizzard. I had no idea, but I thought th this is this seems right for a child of God. &gt;&gt; If you want to get anywhere with the Lord, you're going to have to go through the hard times. You're going to have to go through the trials and the tribulations and the persecutions. &gt;&gt; This isn't a flower bed of ease as a prophet told us. &gt;&gt; He said, "You ask for comfort and peace, but I give you the best I can give you. Trials and tribulations." He said, "That's the best thing he could give us." Now, a lot of the time it doesn't feel like in the moment that that's the best thing he could give us. Sometimes I, brother Josh, feels like a new car would be the best thing he could give me. Sometimes I feel like a brand new house is the best thing he could give me. [clears throat] But really, at the end of the day, we're to be tried. Those saints, you think about the saints in that first age, what they endured for this word. Why are we any different? Why are we any better? Why should it be any easier for me or for you? Amen. &gt;&gt; It shouldn't be. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because I want the same faith that they had, those apostles. I want the same faith that was in those men. And if it takes a couple hard days, if it takes a couple hard years, we have to be obedient and willing to stay there in faith. &gt;&gt; Hunker down with this word. Unite with this word. That's the only way we can get anywhere if we unite with the word. You know, there's so much in the message. There's so much division now. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But if we've never united with the word in the first place, how can we expect to unite with another brother or sister? &gt;&gt; The world can't get along. Without the spirit of Christ, that invisible union holding us together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll never see anything the same. Well, there there will be division at all times. &gt;&gt; That's right. The prophet said here he said you know a sheep is a very sensitive and odd animal. He said you know a sheep never a never was asked to uh manufacture wool. He was asked to bear wool because he is a sheep. And as long as he is a sheep he will bear wool because that's his nature. &gt;&gt; And so is it with the Christian church. We were never asked to manufacture fruits. We were asked to bear fruits. Excuse me. It must be a nature change in each one of us. &gt;&gt; It it must be those desires must change. What we want to do must change. Brother Brandham said he he was preaching a message and he and he was telling the man and he said, "You get the Holy Spirit, then go drink as much beer as you want. Then go smoke as many cigarettes as want. Then go do all that that you want to." But his point was if you ever get the real thing, if the real thing ever anchors down in your heart, what you want to do will change. You won't want to go do those things. And not saying don't confuse this is something for the young people so much. And when I was brand new in the word, it's something that I struggled with. Don't confuse because the devil will trick you on this. He will use this against you. Don't don't confuse desire and temptation. We will be tempted until the day we leave here. Having the spirit of God in you does not does not expel you from temptation. &gt;&gt; We will be tempted. But don't let the devil tell you that that is your desire when he puts the temptation in your heart. Don't let him trick you into that. Because then the next step, the very next thing he wants to tell you is that you've actually gotten nowhere with God. Is that you do not have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Because look at here. You're This is your desire, &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan. This is your desire right here in your heart. You want this thing so bad, but really it's just a temptation. It's a fleeting temptation. And the and the Bible tells us, "Rebuke the uh resist the devil and he will flee." &gt;&gt; But you got to go you got to go back one verse and you got to submit yourselves unto God first. Submit yourselves unto God. Resist the devil and he will flee. That's God. That's a perfect three-step program right there. We want all these different programs to tell us how to live. We want to read a self-help book to help us along. Well, God gave you a self-help book right right here in this Bible with three little verses back there in the book of James saying, "If you will if you will resist this devil, if you'll submit yourself to me and you'll resist this devil with everything in you, &gt;&gt; then he will flee." Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're not talking about resisting the devil and the power and strength of this flesh right here because you're going to lose that battle 10 times out of 10. &gt;&gt; You're going to fail there every time. &gt;&gt; But when you submit yourself unto God and his headship and let the spirit of God lead your life every step of the way, that's how you resist the devil. That's how battles are won. &gt;&gt; It's not won by our strength, &gt;&gt; right? But it's easy to get caught in a trap sometimes, too. Those things happen. We're each one of us sitting in here until the day that we go home. And this isn't negative preaching, but but I'm being honest. More than likely, you'll get caught in a trap. &gt;&gt; Something will happen. &gt;&gt; And you might go a little too far. You might do something you planned on never doing, but that doesn't mean ju just because you fall down doesn't mean you fall away. &gt;&gt; Just because you fall down, you can get back up. When kids fall down, you reach your hand down and you pick them back up when they're learning to walk. Especially somebody comes in here. I think, you know, we have a responsibility with this message. And that responsibility is to spread the message. It's not just to sit up in a high tower and look at everybody else here in the city of Flagstaff and say what they're doing wrong, but it's to go out and bring somebody in. It's to it's to go and tell. Come and see. &gt;&gt; See what we have here that it's the truth. &gt;&gt; All of it's the truth. &gt;&gt; But you know, we can get caught in a trap. There's an old story about African hunters and they would they would they would hunt these expensive monkeys and they would be in the trees of Africa and they'd be swinging through there and they were very elusive and hard to catch. But these a African hunters figured out there's a a what's the fruit called? I think it's called like a I'm probably gonna say this wrong. a calabash or calabash or something like that. And but it's kind of a gourd type of a fruit. And they figured out if they would just stick some of them up in the trees and they would put peanuts in them that that monkey would be swinging through there and it would get a whiff of those peanuts and it would smell good and and it would hunger after those peanuts and that it would swing over there and they would be sitting there and they'd be watching that tree and watching that gourd. And the monkey they made the hole just right. They knew how big the monkeykey's hands were and they made the hole just right to where when it stuck its hand in to get a handful of peanuts, its hand was in too big to come back out. And so what would happen is because of whatever reason, because of this great smell, because because the grass was greener on that side, because there was a temptation in that monkeyy's life, &gt;&gt; it grabbed a hold of those peanuts &gt;&gt; and it would try and pull its hand down. It couldn't. It was stuck. It couldn't get its hand out. But if it would ever just realize why it was stuck, if it would ever let go of what it thought was a prize in its hand, but really it was its death. &gt;&gt; And they would just sit there. It wasn't anything special. They wouldn't have to they wouldn't have to trap it. They wouldn't have to get in a cage. It was all the monkeykey's fault. &gt;&gt; It was all his own doing. &gt;&gt; He got He put his hand in there and he grabbed it. and in turn he would die &gt;&gt; because he wouldn't let go of what he thought was a prize to him &gt;&gt; of what he thought was so important that he would hold on and get shot for. &gt;&gt; He says in another place it is a new birth and a change of heart that changes a man from a dying being to a resurrected immortal son of God taking his place on the seat of the believer's heart. That I want the Lord on the seat of my heart. &gt;&gt; I want it. And if and maybe he's already there, but I want more of him on the seat of my heart. &gt;&gt; I believe we can't ever get enough of the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives. I don't believe we'll ever come to a service and and we'll hear the word preached and and we'll say, "Man, I got enough of the Lord now. I got enough to sustain me." It's not just that initial birth, but in the stature of a perfect man, the prophet talks about, he says, "Then you're birthed into this, into this, into this, into this." It's not just that initial foundational birth. It's not just having faith, but it's the virtue. It's the temperance. It's all these other things. And the Lord, what he wants to do to make us a masterpiece is he wants to mold each one of those statutes into us. He wants us to be like this clay. He wants to put them in. But so much of the time when we get we get put in these situations, you take patience for instance. If you pray for patience, then put your seat belt on. buckle up &gt;&gt; cuz it's about to get serious real quick. &gt;&gt; You pray for that patience. He doesn't Let me tell you, it doesn't happen. It doesn't just float down from heaven like a beautiful leaf in the wind like this and then just settle on us and all of a sudden we're a patient person. That's not how patience works. But patience comes through trials. &gt;&gt; Patience comes through different things in our life molding that patience into us. There there was a brother Israel's when when we still went down there in Tucson. I remember a service I was walking from the restrooms and the brother up front had just started to pray and I bowed my head and I had been praying to the Lord for patience. There was a few things in my life that I was going through and I had I had prayed explicitly for patience. And so I bowed my head and I was talking to the Lord as a brother was praying. And as I was I'm not saying I heard an audible voice, but it was you know how the Lord speaks to you. It's not necessarily an audible voice, but you can feel him speaking to your heart. You know, he's talking to you. And so, I'm standing there and I'm praying and I'm saying, "Lord, it seems like it seems like I'm not getting any more patient. It seems like I'm not okay with any of this stuff happening in my life. I want thing I want it now. I want everything right now." &gt;&gt; And I felt something speak to my heart. And he said, "Every time I try and work on you, you get mad at me. &gt;&gt; Every time I try and work on you, &gt;&gt; you act out. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to stop working on you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop doing that. I'm trying to put this this temperance, this patience into you, but every time I try and mold it into you, you run from me. &gt;&gt; You run away from whatever it is. &gt;&gt; We have to stand. Sometimes we have to weather the storm. We have to be like that oak tree. When the winds are contrary, we have to stand there. But if we don't have those roots dug in, it's hard to stand there. Those smaller trees, they fall. They get blown away. &gt;&gt; Diamonds, they're formed by pressure. But then after that pressure forms that diamond, it doesn't sparkle until it's cut. &gt;&gt; The prophet talks about that in the masterpiece message. He he came upon some diamonds and he said, "Why aren't they sparkling?" The the man said, "They haven't been cut yet. They don't have those fine edges to where they can show forth light." &gt;&gt; But that's where we have to be at to show forth light. [cough] [clears throat] Excuse me. The prophet says here, he says, he says, "Yes, clean out the cupboard. Clean out this house." He said, "Oh, we have a good old-fashioned house cleaning." He said, "Let the blood be applied and then the token will come in. Clean it out. Sanctify it." He said, "Then apply the token in prayer with confidence." &gt;&gt; Are we confident that the token has been applied? Are we walking around like a people that that is acting as if they have received the spirit of God in their lives? Or are we walking around with our head hung low? Are we walking around like we don't understand where we've come from? But he says, "Do it in prayer with confidence. Know that something's happened. Know that you know that something has happened in your life. Don't go through life questioning. don't go because let me this is I've heard a I've heard a preacher before I've I've seen a a girl come up for prayer and she said I don't know if I have the Holy Ghost and the preacher said you have the Holy Ghost that's just the devil lying to you. Well I I agree that could have been the circumstance but it could also be that the Lord is speaking to your heart that you don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I believe we can confuse the young people. Don't don't just preach don't just pray a prosperity prayer over a young person. Say, "Oh, you got it. You got it." Because then they keep going in their lives and they think that they have something. They think they've gotten somewhere with God. And then they get to 20, they get to 30, they get to 40, and the life still isn't right. &gt;&gt; But we have to be honest about it, about both possibilities. And now we're not to we're not to cause confusion or cause question, but it could be one or the other. Look at the fruits. Look at the life. See what's going on. But we have to get serious with it. We have to get serious about getting this token, especially to the young people. &gt;&gt; And not just always the young people, maybe the old people. I, as I said, even if you've had that initial birth, we can always use more. If your prayer isn't, Lord, fill me this first time, let it be, Lord, fill me again. Give me some more of you so I can keep pushing forward. That's what the prophet told us to do. He said, don't stop. He said, keep pushing forward. As the day approaches, keep going forward. &gt;&gt; Give it everything you've got. Brother Brandham said, ' And sometimes we think that our burdens, he said, I might inject this right here, that we think our burdens are so heavy sometimes that there's nothing like it in the world. He said, ' Do you know all those things are good for you? &gt;&gt; He said, they are all to mold you and to make you. He said, prophets and sages was molded on the backside of the desert in the hot blazing sun through trials and tribulations and persecutions. He said, "In these things that we have today, there's nothing happened to us that hasn't happened to other Christians before." &gt;&gt; So when you go through something that, you know, he he he takes his man as we know, but the spirits stay. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; The the same spirits that were attacking those saints then will be the same spirits that are attacking us. And maybe they'll come in different forms. You know, over the 40 years ago or 50 years ago, the internet wasn't a thing. &gt;&gt; The internet's brought on an onslaught that the devil can use. And he he just keeps he just keeps reinventing different ways to attack the believers and to sneak into homes. Brother Brandham talked about it used to be don't go to the picture show. He said, "But he pulled one over on us. He put it right in the house. He put it right there. And now I've heard people preach, he's pulled another one over on us. He put it right here. It's right in my pocket. I can see anything I want to with this right here. At any time I want if I got service at any time I want to. &gt;&gt; He's so sly in how he does things. We have to keep our eyes open for where he is slipping in. And I didn't I this isn't a youth service. I didn't just come up to preach to the youth. But but we have to watch it for them as well. &gt;&gt; The the one us if we've lived longer be able to exhort. be able to let them know, hey, I think something might be slipping in on your life here. &gt;&gt; I think something might be going on. And this isn't deep preaching. This isn't flashy preaching, but if we want a generation of believers to follow us, we have to care about that generation that's behind us. I was at a ministers meeting recently and uh they were talking, I think the subject was uh for the brothers, how do you know if you're called to preach? How how do you know like what's a definite thing if you're called to preach? And the first brother got up and I agreed with him. He started talking about how we have to pour into that. He he gave his answer which I don't remember what that was exactly but what caught my eye was he started talking about how we have to pour into the next generation. How we have to pour into if there's young preachers coming up like myself and I've been so thankful that there have been men like brother Steve, brother George, brother Paul Dirkson, brother Ben Puit, all these brothers that they've took the time to pour something into me. So, it's my duty that it's my responsibility in the word to pass that back down, to keep pouring on, to keep handing down. If somebody's helped you, it's like when you're at McDonald's, somebody pays it forward. Well, I like to keep going. I don't I don't want to be the guy to stop that. I don't want to want to be the one to hinder this guy behind me's free food. So, keep passing that stuff down. Keep helping somebody. But the brother at the ministers meeting, he said, "We got to pour into this next generation. We have to do all we can for him. We have to push him forward so we do have a next generation. &gt;&gt; And now another brother got up after him. I'm not going to say any names, but I disagreed with this brother. Disagreed in part with him. He got up and he said, "Oh, that's all predestinated. God's got that handled. That's all predestinated." Which I do believe. &gt;&gt; But in the way he was saying it, that is lazy preaching. That that's a that's a lazy mindset. Be willing to help somebody. that that what if that was our mindset out here when we pass somebody? Do we want to be open and able to speak to a sinner on the street? Or is that all predestinated? Or is that all taken care of? We're his hands and his feet. It may be predestinated, but Lord, use me. Use me to do it. Lord, let me talk to somebody. &gt;&gt; Let me shine the light to somebody. Let me be that diamond that's went through the pressure already and that's been cut already that can shine forth light to the unbeliever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it be me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How have we gotten far away from that where the prophet preached so much about going to the center, but we sit comfortable in these message pews sometimes? Okay with people dying in our cities. Why are we okay with it? I'm sorry. I'm not This isn't anywhere in my notes, but why are we okay with that? Would you be would you have talked to you before you believed? If you'd have passed you on the street before Christ came into your life, would you have stopped and talked to you? What if you were a little bit messy? What if your clothes weren't just right? What if your clothes were a little dirty? Would you have still spoke to you? &gt;&gt; Would you have said, "Hey, I have the good news. &gt;&gt; Do you want to come to church on Sunday? Do you want to come to church on a Wednesday night? &gt;&gt; Here, I'll buy you a little cheeseburger. Come to church with me." &gt;&gt; Good. We should be travailing for these lost souls. That should be if if what what did the prophet say? It's it's I'm trying to it's trying to come to mind. He said if we He said we're fighting the air when we lose the travail for lost souls. That's what he said. He said you're fighting the air when you lose it in your heart to travail. When he when he lost his feeling for the people, what did he do? &gt;&gt; What was the example that he set? &gt;&gt; What did the Lord have him do? He came off the field for a minute. How's how are you going to preach to somebody if you don't have a feeling for them? If you don't love them, &gt;&gt; how much of a Christian are we if we don't have a love for the sinner? If we don't have a place in our heart for him. And I'm talking to myself. &gt;&gt; I need to be better sometimes. I've had moments walking in a Walmart, walking in a store, walking in a gas station where I've felt the Lord speak to me &gt;&gt; and tell me to go and talk to that person, invite them to church, say a say a kind word to them. and I walked out the door. &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; Am I too lazy? Am I not worried enough about something that's worth 10,000 words? &gt;&gt; What am I doing? &gt;&gt; But we have a responsibility with this message in our hands, with this gospel in our hands. Pilate, he thought he could wash that blood off of him. That blood wasn't coming off. And today, we have the same responsibility. He's on our hands. What are we going to do with him? Are we going to leave him on the cross? Are we going to leave him a god of history? Or are we going to bring him to this very present hour &gt;&gt; and preach him to the world? Wasn't that the commission? Preach the gospel to every creature, &gt;&gt; to everybody. &gt;&gt; Anybody who will listen, we should be pouring our hearts out to him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I feel like I got I'm I'm way off, isn't it? But the quote I mentioned earlier, he said, "We ask for comfort and peace." You know, those moments aren't always comfortable or peaceful. If you go to talk to somebody that don't care anything about what you think. If you go to talk to somebody, and I I have an example. Maybe it's not a sinner on the streets. Maybe it's somebody in a different denomination. &gt;&gt; What if &gt;&gt; What if the rich young ruler would have accepted the invitation? What would it have been like when he walked through those doors? I'm I'm &gt;&gt; go with me here for a minute. &gt;&gt; What would it have been like when he walked through those doors and sat here with his mind made up probably about already five or four different doctrines? What would that have been like? Could could they have worked with him? Would Peter have been patient with him and and said, "Well, brother, we actually believe in serpent seed. We actually believe in the in the message of grace. We actually believe in this." Would he have been patient? Would he have worked with him? Would he have held his hand? Or if he would he have said, "No, he he's gone. He I he don't believe this. I don't think he's ever going to see it." Is that our place to make that judgment call? &gt;&gt; Is it our place to say who and will believe? &gt;&gt; That's only to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if we let him, if I let him, if we let him guide our lives, I believe he will pull them in. &gt;&gt; But we have to have an obedient and willing heart to do so. When when we're out there, we have to be able to say, "Lord, use me in any manner you wish to." &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Same in the church. Lord, if I got to be the janitor today, I'll be the janitor today. Lord, if I got to get up here and I got to say something today, I'll do that if that if that has fallen my lot. If I got to go to my brother, that's why fellowship matters so much. If I have to go to my brother or my sister when I see them down, when I see their head hanging low when they come into the church, &gt;&gt; Lord, if I have to go and just say something to encourage them, Lord, let me be open to it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And my prayer would be, Lord, if there's anything holding me back from being a a willing and a and a usable vessel, show me what it is in my life. &gt;&gt; Lord, show me what's blocking your presence in my life. So many of the times, I might have spoke on it last time I was here, but it's been a common theme in my heart lately. If we want revival, now I'm not talking about I'm not necessarily just talking about the hooting and hollering, running around. That stuff is great. That's part of revival. But if we want a spark, if we want it to be new to us again, if we want to feel like it felt the very first time he came into our heart all over again, if we want to go back to that point, we have to be willing to to go through some training. And we have to be willing to go through some correction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's things in our life that aren't adding up, if there's things that have made that dove fly away and sit on the branch for a moment in time in our lives, we have to be willing for the Lord to speak to my heart &gt;&gt; and be willing to listen &gt;&gt; and to take his advice, take what he has to say. But a lot of the times, there was a guy I worked with in Tucson before I moved. He was I was the install manager down there and he ran crews and he would come in he would come in almost every morning 8 8:00 a.m. 9:00 a.m. and he would just come in in a tizzy. He'd be had papers in his hands all kind of work orders and they'd be flying everywhere like throwing them on my desk. Just a tizzy just all messed up. It's 8:00 a.m. What could have happened at this point? &gt;&gt; So he's all kind of messed up, freaking out. Can't do nothing. and he comes in there and he he's going through every problem and it it just happened for a long time and it just seemed like it'd be a laundry list and he'd go through it and he'd be talking to him and he wouldn't stop talking. It'd be talking like this and he'd just be going so fast and and it just got to a a point where he just stood there for a second after it and he just walked out the door after he got done and and I would just I'd just sit there. It's like my hair was blowed back like I just been in the wind. And but but what he never did, pardon me for saying it this way, he never shut up and let me tell him what would fix all those problems. And sometimes we can get to that place too. &gt;&gt; We talk and we talk and we talk and prayer is great, but if we don't shut up long enough to let God tell us what will fix the problems in our life, [snorts] &gt;&gt; then what are we doing? Are are we praying just to edify ourselves or feel like we checked a box? or are we praying for a legitimate answer? Lord, I really need help with this. The prophet told us that. He said, "Pray and then wait." He didn't say, "Do one of these these prayers, get get down five minutes and hop up and we're out the door again." &gt;&gt; God won't honor that. That's not the type of That's not the type of character he's looking for. &gt;&gt; You know, the type of character that the Lord loves the most is the is the character that shines forth when nobody else is looking. when you're not sitting on one of these pews, &gt;&gt; when when the when the pastor ain't looking, &gt;&gt; when when the pastor's gone in Peru, &gt;&gt; the kind of character that shines forth is when it's just you and the Lord. &gt;&gt; The kind of man or woman that you are when it's just you and him. That's the kind of character, that's the kind of character that we are responsible for coming into. If you say you've accepted this message, if you say you believe this message, we are responsible to become manifested sons and daughters of God. Now, that's a strong statement sometimes. That's that's a that's a big pill to swallow. And I'm not talking about just preaching, oh, I got all the power, all the power. But I'm talking about living a life. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about having a life worthy of the gospel. If you've accepted this word, that's our responsibility is to live a life worthy of this gospel. &gt;&gt; But that can only happen by accepting that token and not just the initial acceptance, but wanting more and more and more and more and never being satisfied with what you've gotten from the Lord. Now, I'm not talking about not being content in your portion. &gt;&gt; But I'm never going to be satisfied with how much Christ is in my life until the day I leave this earth. I want more of him &gt;&gt; and that's all that I want. &gt;&gt; We'll go ahead as a musicians come just read a few more quotes to you. [clears throat] Brother Steve's going to be disappointed I didn't go two hours. I tried, you know, I tried to go two hours, but sometimes you just ain't got it in you. Um the the prophet said here in God's only provided place of worship [music] he said and come to that perfect image of God Jesus Christ God's masterpiece who was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that's been reflectors that is us &gt;&gt; we are reflectors of this message he said Moses was in him Joshua was in him and if you are in him and you was in him before the foundation of the world I believe that's where we were at &gt;&gt; the family of God. You suffered with him. You died with him. And you went to the cross with him. [music] You raised with him. And now you're still with him sitting in heavenly places reflecting the message of the age to the world, the [music] light of the world. I'm thankful to be the as Thanksgiving approaches, what I'm thankful for is that I'm thankful that I can be one of those lights. I'm thankful that I was in him when he suffered. I'm thankful that he suffered for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that he died for me so that I could have correction so that I could receive his spirit. He said one day down on Jordan after the masterpiece had been formed and made here he come descending down on the wings of a dove. He said this is him. He was so enthused with this masterpiece until he struck him on Calvary that he would die for the rest of us that's imperfect. He said that through the shedding of his blood he might bring many masterpieces being a bride to his son. Masterpiece is scarred. Listen to this. Masterpiece is scarred because the enthusiasm of God to see such a masterpiece. And now if we are to be masterpieces and many of us, we've been broken in life. We've got scars. We've got callous spots in our lives. But you were only struck by God's enthusiasm. And you say, "That doesn't make any sense. Why why would God be enthusiastic about me being struck?" [music] Why would be why would he be enthusiastic about me going through a trial or a tribulation? It's because so that he can fulfill his purpose. So that he can be your savior. He can be your redeemer. He can be your healer. But before the foundation of the world, he purposed to be that to every believer. That's what he wants to be to each and every one of us. And that's why he is enthusiastic when we're stricken, when we're struck. I don't I don't believe he's happy that you're going through a hard time. But I do believe there's purpose behind it. &gt;&gt; I do believe he has a reason for doing what he's done. I do believe he has a reason for allowing the enemy to attack you. &gt;&gt; I know he does. &gt;&gt; Accept that into your heart. Don't hang your head. &gt;&gt; You are a manifested son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; But we're people, too. The prophet said in the masterpiece, he said, "To [music] me the flaw was what made it the master of Moses and the statue of Moses, how he said he got so enthused, he said, "Speak." And he struck it. And he said, "That flaw right there is what made it the masterpiece." So when you think back on all these things in your life or what you're going through now, just think about it being that little spot that he struck, that broken part of you. &gt;&gt; But let me say too that that God, he he loves hearing a broken believer's praise. He loves hearing a broken believer's prayer. [music] But I'll also say this that God God don't just do patchwork. [music] He makes new. That's my testimony. When I came to the Lord, my mind was fractured. My mind was broken. My heart was broken. I had a contrite spirit as Psalm 51 talks about. I was a broken person. But he didn't just do patchwork. And he's still he's still working on me. But I'm so thankful that he was struck and that he was broken so that I could be made whole so that I could be a part of him [music] and be one with him. But he said to me, the flaw was what it made a masterpiece. You know, all the all the all the hell that we've been through in our lives when we think back, all the tough times, it's all had a purpose. He's all had [music] his hand in it. And if you're going through it tonight, if you're going through it today, believe me, by by living witness of that, a testimony of that, just standing here, a testimony of that, that [music] he's in it and that he has a purpose. Romans 8:28. He's got a purpose with your life. True. &gt;&gt; But you've got to believe there's a purpose with your life. &gt;&gt; You've got to accept there's a purpose. And that would be my prayer tonight as [music] we bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, I I tried to speak what you laid on my heart, what you brought to my mind in the moments. And Lord, I just ask that it would be a help to somebody. Lord, we thank you. We're we're always thankful for the blessings you've put in our life. But Lord, as this Thanksgiving approaches, Lord, let us be thankful for the tribulations in our life, for the trials, for the hard times, for the times that we've broken. Lord, I'm thankful for all of it. I'm thankful for the hilltops and the valleys low. And Lord, just help us to recognize where [music] we've come from and where we're going to. Help us to be an appreciative people of what you've done for us. And Lord, if there be any here that need anything from you or Lord, any that that just need more of you as we spoke up tonight, I just ask that it'd be known by an uplifted hand. Lord, Lord, I know I need more of you in my life. I've never had enough. I'll never have enough of you. And Lord, I ask that you would bless each one and that you would continue with us tonight in Jesus Christ's holy name. Amen. Brother Ron, I know that Lord prepare me. [music] [music] [music] [music] Yeah. Heat. [singing] [music] Heat [music] up [singing] [music] [singing] here. [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] [singing] Oh, [music] [singing] [music] [music] heat, heat. [singing] [music] Yeah. Heat. [singing and music] [music] Heat. [singing] Heat. [music] [singing] Yeah. Heat. [music and singing] Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] [music] for you. Amen. Amen. I cannot come up with this song right now, but um [music] it's a I'm a I'm a warrior. I'm a um brother Ryan. Um oh, Brother Brandham sang this song over and over again till he burned up the tape. Um I do remember that's part of the story. Um, oh wow. Him and brother Billy Paul were driving down the road and Oh Lord. Well, maybe that's not what you want, Lord. So we won't uh force it. Amen. Amen. One more time as we ask brother Tom dismisses. Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] living. I'll [music] be a living sanctuary [music] [singing] for you. Amen. If we could bow [music] our heads. Heavenly Father, thank you Lord for this word. Lord, thank you for our brother's heart to encourage [music] the people, Lord. Lord, you always give us a direction, Lord. When things seem hard, when things are a trial, Lord, you always reach down into the hole. There's always a ladder. And we thank you for that. And we [music] pray, Lord Jesus, that you'd go with your children, keep them safe [music] for the week ahead.
