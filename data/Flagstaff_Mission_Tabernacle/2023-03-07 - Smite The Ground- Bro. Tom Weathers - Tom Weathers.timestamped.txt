[0:07] Bible tells us how Elisha
[0:11] told King Joe Ash Smite the ground with
[0:15] arrows of the Lord's Deliverance
[0:19] your deliverance will be found
[0:24] but Joe Ash didn't get the picture he
[0:28] only smoked three times that day with
[0:32] five or six he could have cinched it but
[0:36] his enemy still around today
[0:41] so Smite the ground your faith can do it
[0:45] Smite the ground there's something to it
[0:48] the battle set your life's the stage
[0:52] while trials around you fiercely rage
[0:55] their days
[0:57] bird hears
[0:59] [Music]
[1:02] here don't
[1:03] don't Smite the ground
[1:08] Deliverance takes all shapes and sizes
[1:12] it matters not what men may think an
[1:17] arrow flung a smooth Stone slung or men
[1:22] who know just how to drink
[1:26] the methods and the manners differ as
[1:31] different as the trials they face but
[1:34] acting on the Lord's Direction
[1:37] puts all satan in his place
[1:42] so Smite the ground your faith can do it
[1:47] Smite the ground there's something to it
[1:50] the battle set your life's the stage
[1:54] while trials around you fiercely rage
[1:57] their days are numbered he
[2:02] age
[2:04] don't faint just Smite the ground
[2:09] arrows of the Lord's Deliverance are set
[2:14] in motion still today
[2:16] [Music]
[2:18] the Lord says shoot it so we do it and
[2:24] then fail not to pray pray
[2:30] and pray
[2:33] and pray
[2:36] for prayers the arrows that we Smite
[2:39] with why would we stop with two or three
[2:43] for with prayers unceasing our faiths
[2:47] increasing Satan knows just what his end
[2:51] will be
[2:53] so Smite the ground your faith can do it
[2:57] do it Smite the ground there's something
[3:01] the paddles set your life's the stage
[3:04] while trials around you fiercely rage
[3:07] their days are numbered here's the gauge
[3:13] don't faint just Smite the ground don't
[3:18] faint to Smite the ground
