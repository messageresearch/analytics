TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] Bible tells us how Elisha told King Joe Ash Smite the ground with arrows of the Lord's Deliverance your deliverance will be found but Joe Ash didn't get the picture he only smoked three times that day with five or six he could have cinched it but his enemy still around today so Smite the ground your faith can do it Smite the ground there's something to it the battle set your life's the stage while trials around you fiercely rage their days bird hears [Music] here don't don't Smite the ground Deliverance takes all shapes and sizes it matters not what men may think an arrow flung a smooth Stone slung or men who know just how to drink the methods and the manners differ as different as the trials they face but acting on the Lord's Direction puts all satan in his place so Smite the ground your faith can do it Smite the ground there's something to it the battle set your life's the stage while trials around you fiercely rage their days are numbered he age don't faint just Smite the ground arrows of the Lord's Deliverance are set in motion still today [Music] the Lord says shoot it so we do it and then fail not to pray pray and pray and pray for prayers the arrows that we Smite with why would we stop with two or three for with prayers unceasing our faiths increasing Satan knows just what his end will be so Smite the ground your faith can do it do it Smite the ground there's something the paddles set your life's the stage while trials around you fiercely rage their days are numbered here's the gauge don't faint just Smite the ground don't faint to Smite the ground
