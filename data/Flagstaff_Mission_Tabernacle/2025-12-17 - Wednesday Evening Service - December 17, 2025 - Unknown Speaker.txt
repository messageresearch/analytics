Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Please follow everywhere. All right. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. Heat. Heat. That's all this glorious Your soul shall find the river. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Just want to mention before open us in a word of prayer. Open us up. Brother Dawn is in the hospital. uh pneumonia and then that caused the aphib to kick in again and um so we want to remember brother Dawn and of course the family Viven uh and her fam her family will have the funeral announced when uh when they let us know. They're supposed to let us know very soon and so we'll announce that. It'll probably be uh either going to be Tuesday of next week or Friday, Saturday. So, um, we'll be sure to let the church know about that, but be in prayer for their family. And, um, you know, Brother Dawn, I cry out sometimes for help a little bit cuz I see the Brother Dons and the Brother Rays and the Brother Tom's and Brother Bobs, that generation not getting any younger. And there's very few men like Brother Dawn. So, remember him and the family in prayer. Let's just pray. Lord, thank you for tonight. Just a time set aside to come and learn of you and sit at your table. I was just thinking about these needs and as I was driving up here to Flagstaff listening to a message and brother Random was talking about that that speckled bird, that one bird that was sprinkled with the blood of the other and was allowed to fly away. Lord, you gave your life so that we could fly away. So Lord, I'm just asking that you would move on these needs and that you would just be the peace to these people that have needs, Lord, and just have uncertainty in their life right now. And just as we're here this evening, Lord, and we're just here to learn of you, Lord, we just ask that you'd come and teach us, Lord, and just be the dissolver of doubts. Give us a refueling, Lord. always seems like Wednesdays is just under attack always. I always feel like that deer that just knew if he could get to that stream that he'd be all right. Well, we're here tonight, Lord, and we just ask that you'd come give us a drink. We just ask you in your name. Amen. Praise the Lord. Um it's Wednesday. Brother Donald uh couldn't make it and and let me know and um so you got the a fifth or sixth string song leader. I don't know where I fall in the thing there, brother Tom, but um bear with me. I'm going to leave you standing just for a minute if that's be all right. Brother William, that song keeps me singing. He keeps me singing. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Sweetest name I know. There's within my heart. I remember. How many remember sister Mary? She'd sit back over there wherever she would be singing it and you could just hear her voice belting it out. Something I'll never forget and blesses me. There's within my heart a meloy Jesus whispers sweet and fear not I with thee peace be still in all of my heaven Jesus Jesus Jesus sweetest name I He fills my every longing. Keeps me singing as I go. I want to as William learns the tune and the melody. I read about the song about a half hour ago. Pull up that verse too there. Sister Pauline, the man who wrote the song, his wife and three children were killed. It's uh brother Tom would probably known Brides I think his wife and three children were killed in a fire and then he wrote this song. I imagine like you might write a sad song or you might write a whatever song but he wrote it keeps me singing as I go and especially the second verse he pinned it in the hurt and the frustration of his heart. All my life was wrecked by sin and strifilled my life with me. Jesus swept across the broken strings. Stir the suffering again. Oh Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, sweetest day I fills my every sing of his grace. resting Heat. Heat. Oh Jesus. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. He fills my every and keeps me singing as I &gt;&gt; may be seated. We'll sing a another one here. What about my sins are gone? &gt;&gt; You ask me why I'm happy &gt;&gt; and I will just tell you why. &gt;&gt; Because my sins are gone. Oh, you ask me why I'm happy. So, I'll just tell you why. Because my sins are gone. And when I meet the scoffers, they ask me where they are. I say, "My sins are gone." Where they at, Brother Steve? There underneath the left on the cross of Calvary. And as far removed as darkness is from now, there in the sea of God's forgetfulness, that's good enough for me. Praise God. Oh, my sins are gone. It was at this old time altar where God came in my heart. And now all my sins are gone. The Lord took full possession. The devil did depart. I'm so very glad my sins are gone. And there underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness is from now. There in the sea of God's forgetfulness, that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. When Satan comes to tempt me, oh, he tries to make me die. I say my sins are gone. You got me into trouble, but Jesus got me out. I'm glad my sins are gone where they are there underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness is from now in the sea of God's forgetfulness. That's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. And I'm living now for Jesus. I'm happy and because my sins are gone. My soul is filled with music. With all my heart I say, I know that my sins are gone. They are underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. as far removed as darknesses tonight in the sea of God's forgetfulness. That's good enough for me. Praise God, my sins are gone. William, it goes like this. Praise God, my sins are gone. You can't say it enough. Praise God, my sins are gone. One more time, baby. Well, praise God. My sins are gone. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My sins are gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. How about Brother William? We'll sing another one here. Maybe. Faith is the victory. Faith is the You don't know. How about God is good all the time. God is good. Okay. sermon. Oh, God is good. Oh, heat, heat. Heat up here. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. is good. My God is good all the time. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know. Uh, Brother Tom, were we doing an offering or do we want to &gt;&gt; Were we doing an offering this evening? Put it in the back, Brother Mitchell. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We'll we'll we'll we'll uh if you have a offering or tithe or anything, give it to one of the deacons or uh we'll we'll uh put it in the back in the box there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory of the Lord. for Australia. I will kiss. I cruel. Oh W At the cross. Let's all stand. At the cross where I first saw and my heart was there. Heat. Heat. I see myself and happy playing that brother William. So I asked brother Ryan if we would take up the topic again a word to the church. I think he spoke on the 23rd of November and just kind of keep down that thought again. And then at the end of the service this evening, Lord willing, brother Everett wanted to get baptized and uh did it when he was younger, but sometimes we don't understand and uh so he wanted to do again and really have that uh to do it again. So, praise the Lord for that. And so I knowing that I said, "Brother Ryan, we'll have we'll do this Wednesday and then the 7th of January we'll do it again. I don't know if you can learn this subject enough, but you've probably uh Oh, and Jeremiah, by the way, I got to say this. We're walking into the built to I was just showed brother Everett the baptismal and then walked him back to the sanctuary and he was saying, "Brother Steve, my mind, you know, it just it's hurting me and it's starting, you know, I'm struggling." And and Jeremiah goes, "God can heal that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Wow, out of the mouth of babes." Brother Jeremiah, you nailed it. You absolutely nailed it right on the head, brother. He said, "God can heal that." So that's faith right there, saints. And I believe it and I claim it. Yes. So, praise the Lord. Anyway, so that's on the agenda tonight and looking forward to what the Lord has in store for us as we go forward. We'll sing this as brother Ryan comes at the cross of the cross where I first Heat. Heat. happy all the time. Amen. God bless you this evening. Appreciate that song service and appreciate uh brother Steve wearing multiple hats &gt;&gt; and um and everyone that has come out on a Wednesday night. Really just appreciate that. Um I just uh we always want to give the Lord room to do something in our lives, right? &gt;&gt; And uh so let's just uh as um before we have you seated, before we approach the word, always want to start with a prayer to the Lord. Amen. Let's just bow our heads and heavenly father Jesus, we just love you. We trust in you, Lord. We we we don't know anything else, Lord, but you. &gt;&gt; I don't want to know anything else but you, Lord. I only want to be, Lord, under your leadership, Lord, under your headship, under your word, Father. And Lord, would you just um Lord, in this day that's it's dark, Lord. It's confusing for a lot of people, Lord. Would you just continue to make yourself clear and known to us, Lord? We're looking for you, Lord. We believe in you more than just words, Lord. More than just um something that we repeat, Father. We we really want to to throw ourselves upon your mercy, Lord, and your grace, Lord, and and really dive into your word, Father. We thank you for giving us such a pure word and truth, Lord, to to to live by, to study, and to hear, Lord, and to feed on, Father. And so I pray that you would just bless all those Lord that have come with an expectation on their heart to hear from you. Lord, I have never once seen you disappoint them, Father. I come with an expectation on my heart to hear from you, Lord. And so we just want to make you welcome. &gt;&gt; We've sang we've sang songs to you of praise, Lord. We're I believe that we're feel energized, but Lord, a word from you would mean so much today, Father. So we just want to approach your word now and get out of the way, Lord. Would you just protect your pulpit? Protect your word, Father. protect the hearts of the believers in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you musicians. Uh while you're standing, we'll just take a quick scripture. Um I almost uh I almost forgot to find a scripture before I wrote came out. I was uh I was so busy with notes and all these other things that I was like, "Okay, I'm ready to go." And then I realized I didn't have a scripture to start with. So, uh, just, uh, quickly, um, found one that I think was very appropriate in Mark, um, chapter 7. And, uh, just want to say I really appreciate, um, the the messages that our pastor has been bringing. Um, just been very edifying to me. I've, um, just appreciate the correction that the Lord has brought unto me. Um, I just, um, it makes me love him more. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It makes me love him more and it makes me it makes me know that I'm a I'm a child of God that he's that he's willing to come and just straighten me out and uh I believe that we show him we're a child by receiving it. &gt;&gt; So I just appreciate I know it's not easy to do but uh it's the right thing to do. Amen. So Mark chapter 7 um we just read this real quick a few verses here. Let's start with verse one. They came together unto him, the Pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from Jerusalem. And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashing hands, they found fault. For the Pharisees and all the Jews, except they wash their hands off, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. Verse five. When the Pharisees and scribes asked him, why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashing hands. A little spoiler, but that question is asked of you today. Why do you not walk according to the tradition of the elders? And he answered and said unto them, Well, hath Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, this people honorth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. How be it in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men? For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things, many other such light things you do. And he said unto them, full well you reject the commandment of God that you may keep your own tradition. For Moses said, "Honor thy father and mother, and who so cursseth father and mother, let him die the death. But ye say, if a man shall say to his father and mother, it is corbin," that is to say, a gift by whatsoever thou might be profited by me, he shall be free. And you suffer him no more to do for his father and mother, making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered, and many such like things do ye." And we could continue to read that. and he just really gives us scouring. Um you may be seated to um I'm not really wanted to preach on tradition. It's not really the plan. We wanted to go over this uh word to the church. I think um um look at the time here. I did not bring my watch with me. Praise the Lord. We have a baptism tonight. So we definitely want to make way for that and not take too much time this evening. But could we just set aside a little bit of time to go through this? Um, we wanted to talk about the the brother Steve wanted to stay on this subject and I agreed with him about a word to the church. It's not something you can cover in a service. It's not going to be covered in two services. It's not going to be covered in three or four or five. Um, I think we pretty thoroughly went through the word to the church last time, but I thought, you know, rather than read through it again and and uh take up that time, I just printed out with Steve's permission, I just printed out the word of the church that we have out there if anybody wanted one. And I was pretty optimistic. I printed out like 35 of them. And I was like, well, why don't I just print out like 50 of them and then maybe 50 people will show up. And so, I'm not saying my faith like filled up the church or anything, but I was just like, I'm not going to set the expectation though if anybody would want one. Uh maybe you could just take one and pass it around. I think there's maybe 40 or 50 there. So, and maybe just to I want I have one. I kept one for my notebook just to have have with me. So, we're not going to go through this whole thing again. And um not not to to say it that way that's not important, but really just read this. And I think we covered it last time what he's instructing us to do. Amen. And what he's what he's what he's urging what he's really uh urging the church, the believers, us to do. Amen. We covered it, I think, very thoroughly. But what I wanted to um with the help of the Lord, what I wanted to more cover was just the the the the maybe the core theme behind the word of the church. So, you could have it. You could read through it and and it certainly should be a blessing. It gives us a lot of things, Amen. to do. Would you agree with that? &gt;&gt; Uh, how many feel like when you read that, those are easy things to do? &gt;&gt; Okay. I didn't feel like they were easy things to do. When I read it, I'm going to be honest, I feel a little bit intimidated. I feel a little bit uh um what is the word I'm thinking of? Um I'm just not able to do it without the Lord. That is true. &gt;&gt; And that's the whole point of the word of the church. The whole thing, if we really just take the whole word to the church, the whole thing can be wrapped up in that. It's it's a it's a it's an instruction. It's a it's a map of increasing and decreasing. &gt;&gt; So, if you read through the whole thing, he's going to tell you, you know, this situation uh is going to happen. And when the situation happens, this is what you should do. you should not do this &gt;&gt; or when the situation happens, you should do more of this. It's an increase and it's a decrease. And if you just read through that with maybe that in mind, it it it it really kind of pops out. You look at if somebody's going to if somebody's going to uh come in and they're going to start trouble, they're going and we kind of like I said, we covered this. I want you to cling that much closer together. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's not just about staying where we're at or staying in in in the the status quo, as they would say. It's not just about maintaining the level of where you're at as a believer in the church. It's listen, when these things come in, and you know how the Lord knows that they're going to come in is because he's going to send them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, he says, now Satan's going to shoot some guy full of venom. And but Satan can't do a single thing without going to the Lord and saying, "Hey, do you got these people on a pedestal? Sound familiar? You got these people kind of covered up and I bet you if I just cause a little bit of they're they'll curse you. &gt;&gt; And he says, you know what? Why don't you go ahead? Just don't touch their life. &gt;&gt; And he has to come and ask. So God knows these things are going to come and he's saying just maintaining who you are as a believer is not going to get you through. &gt;&gt; There must be a decrease of you and an increase of me. Because when I read through this just this little couple of paragraphs, I really quickly realize that no matter how good uh I tried to act and no matter the strongest willpower that I could have, I could not 100% perform the things on this piece of paper. &gt;&gt; And listen, can I just I'll just take the pressure right off of of anybody who thinks that they can. If you could, then you get the glory and God doesn't. So if you could do these things, &gt;&gt; then you are God. &gt;&gt; And so wouldn't you think that maybe he puts things in this little paragraph, a couple paragraphs that he knows you can't do without him? &gt;&gt; And that's what the test or that's what the the the test or the trial really is. You know, the test, you know, sometimes um I mean, the way that I've looked at a test, and I'm just going to kind of speak for myself. I can't speak for you. Sometimes the way that I've looked at a test or a trial when it comes from God is that sometimes I think that well God is kind of uh he's kind of beating up on me. &gt;&gt; God's kind of uh putting me really putting me through the ringer. He's really And then we see all these analogies that are in the message and in the Bible, you know, when the when the the master craftsman is beating on the gold, right? And and the these things are true. I'm not saying that they're not true. when he's beating on the gold and when I'm going through this trial with through this test I think okay that's just the Lord beating on me and but I I want to just give you a little bit of a perspective I think change on this um this is a this is a change for me um God is not cruel &gt;&gt; he's not &gt;&gt; and and God does not want you to fail &gt;&gt; God does not want you to be defeated God does not want you to be without victory in your life but if if you do not recognize who God is then We'll start to think of him like I I have thought of him as sometimes as as somebody who is cruel and somebody who's testing me as we heard just in the service ago, testing me beyond that thing that I can handle. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says he doesn't do that. He makes that way of escape, right? But he's going to take you right up to that edge. And the the test is actually not him beating on the gold. &gt;&gt; See what it the test is when he picks up the gold and tries to see his face in the gold. That's the trial. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's the trial. I' I've had it backwards for a really long time. Oh, the beating is the trial. No, no. When he can't see himself through the trial, he goes, "Okay, I'm going to go ahead and I'm just going to keep I'm going to take the clay. It doesn't look like I want it to look like I put it into the I put it in the kiln and it blew apart. &gt;&gt; I'm going to start over again." &gt;&gt; And I got all the time in the world to form you and to make you. And maybe you think, "Oh man, I just can't handle another." But you can handle it because he's the one doing it. And so the test is not the beating. &gt;&gt; It's not these things. The test is when he wants to see himself in you. That's the test. And so the test is not that you can do these things. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Do do I believe that we should be do do I believe that we should do these things? &gt;&gt; Do I believe we should do these things? I do believe it. &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I cannot do them without him. And the test is when if I were to do him, he he would look at that piece of gold and he would go, "No, I see too much of you in that piece of gold. I see you trying to be a Christian. You trying to be a believer. You trying to get yourself healed. You trying to get yourself saved. You trying to get yourself to church." And uh I'm sorry. I'm just gonna have to keep beating on that. So, &gt;&gt; and and see, the test does not make you bad or good. It just reveals who you are, &gt;&gt; right? that the the the test or the trial does not place something inside of you. &gt;&gt; It just reveals what is inside of you already. &gt;&gt; You know, a test in school, I know this is so basic, but let's just stay, can we just say basic? The test in school is not for the learning. &gt;&gt; The test in school is to see if you learned the days before, the hours before, the weeks before. And the test is the is the revealing. Did you pay attention in class? Anybody else not pay attention in class? and then try to study right before the test. Sometimes you luck out and you go through it. But you do that consistently over time, it will show that you're not It will show that I'm a Christian Sunday morning right before I come to church and maybe sometimes on a Wednesday night if I don't have anything else going on, but it will show that I'm not studying in the word the rest of those days. &gt;&gt; Now, I might get lucky, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; and get something right every once in a while. This is not to to admonish you. This is to admonish me for that. So he's what he's doing is he's molding his characteristics &gt;&gt; into the gold. Okay, that's what the that's what the beating is. He inspects it. That's the test. This to me is a map &gt;&gt; of of this is not I just want to say this. This is not a list of rules. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, if you look at this as a list of laws and rules, you will be overwhelmed. &gt;&gt; Correct? &gt;&gt; You will, first of all, you won't be able to follow it. So, then, as Steve preached a few weeks ago, you'll go, "Well, what's the point of even trying? I can't do number three or number five or whatever it is. Uh, why am I even going to church?" &gt;&gt; In fact, I think sometimes that's why I or maybe others, and I won't speak for you, has sometimes have a little bit of trouble even getting into the word of God. Sometimes it's difficult to put on a tape because sometimes when you hear the tape, it sets a standard that you think you now need to meet. And if that pressure is too high, it's just easier sometimes to not listen to the tape. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm preaching anybody else, but I know for myself, I'll go, "Man, I really want to listen to a tape." And then there's something sometimes that fights. Yeah, but you're not really going to you're not you're struggling with what the tape is saying to do. And so then the temptation is, well, I'll just not listen to it. &gt;&gt; I That's just how the devil works on me. But but every time I put on the tape, of course, I find things that I'm not doing. But then he makes the way of escape. If I listen long enough, if I stay in it long enough, he says, I I almost every message will say, "Now listen, you can't do this. You can't do this. I got to be doing this." And so, but you got to hang with the word long enough &gt;&gt; to let the word help you &gt;&gt; fulfill the word. &gt;&gt; So simple, right? And yet, man, I don't know how many times I go I start a tape and I'm just like, I don't know if this is the right one or sometimes I don't even get to start it because it's too easy. It's just easier to be distracted by something else. So, this is this is not a law. This is not a set of instructions. This is a map of how to find God. &gt;&gt; You say a map, what do you say a map? This is like, you know, be be kind to one another. Uh pray for the man, he'll be saved. The brother's a little bit wrong. You know, stay. I'm not trying to mock it, but this is like, no, certainly it's deeper than this. &gt;&gt; Well, go and try this first, and then if you can do this 100%, then we'll move on to the deeper things. But like this is what &gt;&gt; this is what I struggle with. I could understand a lot of things that are preached that are that are what we would call deep, but I don't have to live those things &gt;&gt; when it's real plain and it's real simple right in front of you and you got to go live it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham preached a message several times why we struggle to live a Christian life or why is it so hard to live a Christian life and you you listen to that message. He's not going deep into uh these these mysteries and all these things. He's just laying it out plain how the way we should lead. I I got to keep moving forward. But but the reason why it's a map is um and I just I kind of want to just kind of shift or or focus shift this focus to something. The reason why it's a map to find him is because God as has always hidden himself. &gt;&gt; He's always hidden himself &gt;&gt; since the very beginning. He's hidden himself and is only seen and only viewed and only recognized by the true believer of that time. &gt;&gt; Okay, that should be a real easy statement to grasp. But let's break that down a little bit. He's he he hides himself. You know, there was a time where God hid himself in a cloud &gt;&gt; and a pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He hid himself in there. Now, you had to believe that this cloud that was floating outside of your tent if you were an Israelite was God. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I mean, it's a pillar of fire floating in the air. Like, how would I not believe that?" And yet, only two people out of two million &gt;&gt; crossed over into the promised land. The pillar, God himself, the creator of the universe, led the children of Israel in a pillar of fire &gt;&gt; and they didn't recognize him. &gt;&gt; Correct. I find that like because we would say, "Well, if I was there, I'm sure I'd be going over the I'd be there." But but we have the same God &gt;&gt; hidden in a pillar of fire. And how many are crossing over into the promised land, &gt;&gt; right? Because it takes recognition. It It takes recognition. So he was only visible for those who were looking for him. It's it's really simple. But even with God, there is a pillar of fire and a cloud by day. There were murmurings. There were rebellion. There were people worshiping idols. And God is literally in their midst. &gt;&gt; Like a physically visible being still turning to idols, still doing all these things. Um, many were called out of Egypt. So they listened to the word. They listened to the message of their day. enough to be called out of Egypt, but not enough to go into the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the word of God for their day, they agreed with. They thought it was the word. They said it was the word, but for some reason, there was a disconnect when the word said, "You're going to go do this." They either didn't understand what it said to do or what it said to do was too hard or they thought they had to do it. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; See, because God and God was just hiding himself. He was hiding himself. This is real basic, right? I know this is like not an amen like sermon, but it's just real basic. But God is hiding him. I'm not saying that to get amens, but it's it's like but it worked. But uh he's he's hiding himself, right? Job said, "I want to talk to you, God. I want to talk to you." And you know how he hid himself in a whirlwind. &gt;&gt; See, God, what he did is he's just like, "Okay, I'm going to come, but I'm going to hide myself in a source." And what this what this is going to do, it's really going to reveal to me when I look in the gold if you really want to find me. Do you really want to find me? He puts you and I through the trial to see will you really seek me out or will you try to figure your way out of the trial? And if you try to figure your way out the trial like the test, you might get out of it sometimes, but you're going to get in a deeper trial. You're going to get in a harder test. Not because he's cruel or because he's mean, because the answer is him. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; The answer isn't what I know and and all the things that I know. Uh the the the people the people um you know, he he changed his mask again. He came unto his own. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And they received him not." Now, I just want to start. Now, I I read this about the Pharisees and you know, it's real easy to beat up on the Pharisees, right? &gt;&gt; It's like like they're not here to defend themsel and you know, you read through the Bible and you're like, "These are kind of awful pe you know, they were like Jesus himself didn't like speak real highly of them, but I bet you if you knew them, they were probably good people." &gt;&gt; Is that kind of hard to grasp? I bet you they were good, faithful, churchgoing people. &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who said the word is true, the Bible, what they had for their day is true. And yet they were missing something. &gt;&gt; And he came unto his own. And the Bible says his own received not. They were good people. But they were looking for him to come like he came to Moses. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; See, they had the Bible. They had, can I just want to say this? They had the message of their hour. &gt;&gt; They had the message of their hour, which was all of the recordings up until that time, just like we say that we have now. All the recordings, they had the message of their hour and they read it. If they had tapes, we could have said they would have listened to those tapes, right? But they weren't finding him &gt;&gt; because they were trying to say, "How can I live what this message is saying based upon my own deeds and my own works and my own actions? How can I be holy enough to do this?" &gt;&gt; And um you know, they were looking for him to come like he came to Abraham or came to Samson. They're looking for God because they can look back. Listen, this this is foreshadowing. they can look back and see how he came &gt;&gt; and then they're looking for him to come the same way. &gt;&gt; So, we'll move to modern day because I I know you know where I'm going and I don't know if you think that this has to do with the word to the church, but let me tell you what the Pharisees and the people of Israel were studying. They were studying a word to the church &gt;&gt; for their day. &gt;&gt; Like, we're not the only ones that got a couple of paragraphs. They had a word to the church for their day and they read it up and down and back and forth and to the best of their ability they tried to live it. &gt;&gt; That is true. &gt;&gt; He came um I think that brother Brandham says he came in the name of three sons. &gt;&gt; Correct? &gt;&gt; He came in the name of the son of man, &gt;&gt; the son of God, and the son of David. &gt;&gt; Right? Those are if you're taking notes, you can write that down but pretty easy to remember. He came to them to Israel as son of man. And he said, brother Ram says this was to fill Deuteronomy 18:15 when he says the Lord uh your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me. And he said that prophet is a capital P and he says son of man is that prophet. That's what it means. Brother Bram goes on to say he never called himself son of God. He said, "Son of man on intentionally." &gt;&gt; And and we know that we we also know that the message says he come he came to the church. &gt;&gt; He came Anybody know it? I don't I don't want to I don't want anybody to get it wrong. He came to the church. He came in the church. And he comes with the church. To in with Okay, that's that's right. That's right. in the message, but they didn't recognize him because he was not the way that he came was not in their Bible. &gt;&gt; See, what they had failed to do is they had failed to include the prophetic message back then for their day to know what the Bible was talking about, the Bible for their day. They did not have a prophetic. They had it, but they did not listen to it. They did not eat it. They did not consume it. They did not say, "Listen, we have our scrolls. We have the law of Moses. We have these things. However, we have Isaiah and we have Elijah. We have these that are talking about this. I'm going to go in there and I'm going to read." And and maybe somebody said, "Yes, but those men were flawed men. &gt;&gt; Maybe you should just preach out of the Bible." &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Does that sound familiar? &gt;&gt; May you know what? I I It's good to have a prophet. It's good to have a message of the hour, but why don't you just preach a good Bible message? &gt;&gt; Now, do you think I'm against the Bible? &gt;&gt; You are. We're not going to make it without the Bible. I believe in Bible teaching. I believe in reading your Bible. I believe in taking it right out of the Bible. But there's something with the spirit &gt;&gt; of saying, "Listen, I just want to have a Bible sermon because God, if he does it one way, &gt;&gt; he's going to do it that same way." And God chose for his purposes to say, "Look, I'm going to give you a Bible and then I'm going to speak to a prophet who's going to bring a an interpretation of that Bible &gt;&gt; and he's going to speak it to you. However, the interpretation is going to come real to you when I bring it to pass." But you're not going to know I brought it to pass if you're not reading what the prophet said. In fact, I'll bring it to pass right in front of you and you'll call me Beelzebub. &gt;&gt; That's what happened. They called him Beelzeub although he was doing what the Bible said he was going to do because they failed to look at it through a prophetic message. And I know you know where I'm going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, I just want to keep moving forward. Um, time wise, I think I'm good. All right. I I I I last time and this I I I uh I wish brother Donald was here because he kept my piece of paper from last time but like um I Okay, I have a piece of paper. This is why the message of the hour, this is why the word of God, let me put it that way, is so perfect. &gt;&gt; And this is why you can have confidence and you can really have faith in something. Because last time I was telling you, well, this is a piece of paper and this is your promise. This is your token &gt;&gt; and this promise is enough to defeat the devil. And I still believe that. But I but but I didn't have time. And now I got some time. I want to tell you why. And you as soon as I say it, you're going to be like, I know what you're going to do. But I'll tell you why that promise is so powerful. Because this is what he did. There you go. Now it cannot be replicated. It cannot be duplicated. &gt;&gt; It cannot be imitated. It cannot be faked. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Only this piece of paper fits with that piece of paper. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; And if I have this piece of paper, if I have this half of the promise and God has that half of the promise, I cannot fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; They say, "Okay, that that really that was the big but but see that's what the difference between just reading your Bible, just reading your Bible." That's a big thing. But just there's, you know, there's millions of people that read their Bible. &gt;&gt; There's millions of people are going to be lost and go to hell. &gt;&gt; You know, there's millions of people that listen to the message of the hour, William Brandham, that will be lost and I don't know where they're going to go, but there's they're not going to be bride. There's millions of people. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they have this, but they have the whole thing. They have the whole thing. Their covenant they've made with themsel, what they can do, what they can produce, what they can believe, what they can do. And God doesn't have a place in it. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they he's hidden. He's hidden to them. And they think that they're doing God a great service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's going to be a sad it's going to be a sad day. I do not want to be in that particular situation. &gt;&gt; And and he said that the word for the day would come, but it's not going to come through man's interpretation. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He interpreted the word for the day by bringing it to pass. Amen. Let listen. Only those that do have the Bible and have the message of the hour for their hour and also are putting those two things together under the leadership and the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Because see, it takes another element. You can have those things, but you have to find where God is hidden for that day. &gt;&gt; You have to find where he's hidden. And he's only going to reveal himself to those who are looking for him. &gt;&gt; In the way he wants to be found, not in the way you want to find him. And I want to find him. Lord, I need you to show me where you're at in this because through my understanding, I think it's this, but I know where my understanding leads. I can't rely on that. I have a whole Bible full of examples of people who leaned into their own understanding &gt;&gt; of what the message because that's the other thing too is like the message in the Bible it gets so t it gets it's made complicated. Can I just say I hope this isn't offensive. There are many many people who complicate &gt;&gt; the message. &gt;&gt; They complicate the Bible. Preachers do it. Churches do it. Uh uh whole groups do it. Individuals do it. I I think preachers do it because then you need them to explain it to you. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to be frank. &gt;&gt; They complicate it. It turns into this thing where you're like, "Uh, okay. I'm not sure what you just said." Okay. Well, let me let me explain that to you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's not That's not what the Bible says. The word came unto the common man. He heard it gladly. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. The thing is that we as in humans, as in people, we've complicated the message. And then people hear it and they go, I don't believe that. Well, they shouldn't believe it because I complicated to something that the word never said, &gt;&gt; whether with good intentions or bad intentions or whatever might it it comes back to just what does the word say? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And do I believe it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, so there are many church members, churchgoers, and listen, they were looking for him to come like he came with Moses, but he came as son of man. He came to them. So when the Bible says he came to his own, they received him not because they were expecting a cloud. They're expecting a pillar of fire, they're expecting a whirlwind, they were expecting a general to ride in all the ways that they thought that was going to happen, right? Because and in the day, they had a word to the church. I I know I'm repeating that, but it's but it's important. They they had a word to the church like we have and they still missed him. &gt;&gt; They missed him. So us having this piece of paper is good, but you can still miss him. &gt;&gt; And then after he was crucified and he was buried and he resurrected, he made another covenant with the believer. &gt;&gt; You know that? &gt;&gt; He made another covenant with a believer. William, he made a covenant. And you know what he did? He tore his son in half. He tore his own son and tore him in half and he took his body &gt;&gt; and he gave you his spirit. &gt;&gt; The other piece of paper that you have is the match for Jesus who he took his body. We don't have that. And what did Jesus even say? He goes, "Look, I am going to go unto the father &gt;&gt; and you're not going to see me. The world's not going to see me and yet you will &gt;&gt; because I'll be in you." See, I'm going to tear. He made a new covenant. That's the confidence that I can have is that I have I have a lot of faults. I have a lot of mistakes. I make them every single day. But I have the half of the covenant that he gave me. Not because I deserve it. Not because I'm good. Because he decided, listen, it would be one thing that if he just died for me, it would already be the greatest thing to ever happen on the face of the earth. It would be the greatest event if God said, "Listen, I am going to change my form. I'm going to hide myself throughout the ages and I'm going to come and I'm going to hide in a sinful flesh body &gt;&gt; so that I can understand you better, so that I can know you better, so I can enter in for you." That would be incredible if that's all he did was to say, "William, I'm going to give you that half so that and I'm going to come and I'm going to be one of you so I'll understand you." But that's not all he did. He said, "I am going to become you &gt;&gt; so that you can become me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That to me is like that's what makes him God to me. &gt;&gt; He wasn't just say, "Let me come down and understand." No, no, no. Listen, I'm going to hide myself in you and I'm going to hide you in me. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Wait a minute. So, I'm going to be hidden in the Lord." Like, wait a minute. I still have all these things that I'm dealing with. Yeah, &gt;&gt; let him take care of those things. See, all that becomes is a set of rules, a set of Now, do I believe that we should do I believe in a standard. I believe in a standard, right? &gt;&gt; Because what some people do is they go, "Okay, well, I'm going to break off the traditions. I'm going to break the traditions." So, well, the pastor is saying go to church, so I'm just not going to go to church. &gt;&gt; It's okay. I mean, it's Wednesday. Everybody's here. So, it &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go to church because Well, let me show you these quotes where you can go to church. I absolutely believe you can go to church every single day and you can be lost and go to hell. &gt;&gt; Can we just get that out of the way right now? You can read your Bible every day. You can pray every day. You can come to every church service and never miss it. And that does not make you a Christian. &gt;&gt; But listen, if you are a Christian, &gt;&gt; you'll want to do those things. I'm going to read you a quote if it's okay. I I actually didn't plan on reading it, but I haven't noted. People say um I I'm going to stop real quick. Brother Steve, I love that scripture that you read. He said there's a famine in the land. &gt;&gt; There's a famine in the land for what? &gt;&gt; The hearing of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham goes on to explain, you know, there's the preaching of the word of God's not being preached. And then he'll say, but it's being preached and some people are not listening to it. See, the famine is not always that the word of God is not being preached. It's that we don't want to hear it. &gt;&gt; It's a reverse famine. He says this, "People say I can stay at home and you can not you can not like me for this, but this applies to me. So, I could stay at home and be just as good a Christian as I can at church. You can't." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's his words. And you can say, "Well, &gt;&gt; well, that's 1950s. That's 1960s. What about 2025?" &gt;&gt; The Bible says not forsake assembling ourselves together and that much more as we see the time coming. If you're a Christian, big question there. If you're a Christian, you long to go where other Christians are. Is it an individual walk? Yes. That's why coming into this building does not get you &gt;&gt; into heaven. &gt;&gt; But if I have him and brother Kurt, you have him. I want to be this spirit wants to be with that spirit because guess what, brother Kurt is that piece right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jerry, you're that piece right there. &gt;&gt; Who else? Who wants to be a peace? &gt;&gt; Sister Kathy, you're that piece right there. So, if I come together, if I come together and and we all get together and and Sister Kathy's not there, that's what that that's what that looks like because it doesn't have that. Well, I'm not that important. It's not that it doesn't matter if I don't come. It matters. &gt;&gt; It matters because a covenant was given to believers. &gt;&gt; And and listen, I don't want to be holding you back. Right? &gt;&gt; I don't want you to be an expectation and I'm over here like, "Well, I'll just keep my little piece of paper. It's it's it's this big. I don't really do anything in the church." It's incomplete without that little piece of paper. &gt;&gt; It's incomplete. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "If you're a Christian, you long to go where other Christians are and fellowship with other Christians. So, you cannot stay away from church and live the same life. You can't do it because it's like, "I'm hungry, but I'll never go to a table. &gt;&gt; Talk about a famine for hearing the word of God. I'm hungry, but I'll never go to a table. &gt;&gt; I'll just I'll never eat. I just I ain't going to do it." See, you've got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship with one another. We need one another now more than we ever did need each other is now. when you get yourself singled out from the rest of the group. Now listen, sometime I'm just going to pause this right here. Sometimes people single you out and then sometimes you single yourself out. I've been guilty. I I've had both happen. Sometimes I'm like, "Well, they didn't include me." But then sometimes I'm like, "Well, I didn't feel included." &gt;&gt; And there was invitations. There was, "Why didn't I invite? Why didn't I make those steps? Well, they didn't come." Well, do it again. &gt;&gt; Draw the circle bigger. Right? But you'll single yourself out or sometimes you get singled out. Neither is a good excuse. It's just neither is a good excuse. Singled out from the rest of You know why? Because this is this isn't a this isn't a a bed of roses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a bed of roses. &gt;&gt; Go play a competitive sport or competitive game or a race and what if somebody was like, "I'm going to destroy you out there." Well, I guess I'll just take my bike and go home. &gt;&gt; Right. That What kind of competitive sport would that be? Oh, you're going to try to Okay. Well, no. I'm sorry. I'm going to I'm going to come anyways. &gt;&gt; Amen. and I don't bring my agame. &gt;&gt; And we do that with sports or we do that with whatever it is, work or whatever it is. How much more the house of God? &gt;&gt; Uh you sing single yourself out from the rest of them. Making yourself a little bit different. &gt;&gt; You don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to associate with that. You're getting on dangerous ground right then. Keeping away from church. &gt;&gt; Find the one of your choice. Oh, that's that's pretty nice, &gt;&gt; right? It doesn't force you to go to &gt;&gt; you got to go to Flagstaff Tabernacle. Find the one of your choice &gt;&gt; and remain there and be a Christian brother to all of them. That's the way to be a real &gt;&gt; Christian. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. I'm uh 8:00. I've been 30 minutes. Can I have a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; I know we got a baptism. So, I'm uh I'm gonna hurry and I'm not I hope you don't feel like I'm like raking you over the coals. I feel like as soon as I'm reading this, I'm like, the Lord's just like, Mhm. got that hammer out. You got some rough edges. You got some sharp edges. You got some lumps in there. Um, so he's crucified. He makes a new He makes a new covenant. Jesus giving another word to the church that he would be hiding himself. &gt;&gt; So he's telling you and in order to recognize him, there needs to be an increase of one part and there needs to be de a decrease of another part. Right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He be the second thing he came as a son of God. And he says now he says in the scripture I was going to read it at the beginning. Behold you are sons of God &gt;&gt; now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are sons of God now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So right there you can just take the the battle that the devil says. Oh keep working on getting to that son of God stage. The the the Bible says if we want to take the Bible and have a good Bible teaching. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Now you are the sons of God and it does not even appear what you shall be. So you are that now. But the problem is here's the problem. If you don't recognize who God is, you won't recognize who you are. &gt;&gt; See the the the the problem just compounds. If I'm not recognizing where he's hid, &gt;&gt; I don't even know who I am. And then I can treat myself and act like I want to and live any way I want to. Because really what I would be doing if I recognized who I am, I would never want to dirty what God has cleaned, &gt;&gt; right? I would never want to take Listen, if you recognized who you were, that you are worth more than the blood of the son of God, would you want to go out and tarnish that? Would you want to go out and dirty that? Would you want to go and have your way with what God paid for? And I know we know these things, but do we recognize them? That's different. You could say, here's the thing is, you know, this is a weird example, but like we know who a actor is, a famous actor, actress or politician, but if you pass them, you could pass them on the street and not recognize them, &gt;&gt; but yet you know who they are, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know who they are. It's that same thing. It's like we know what the believer is supposed to be, but do do you recognize a believer when you look at yourself in the mirror? Very good. &gt;&gt; And if you can't recognize a believer, are you really recognizing God in this day and where he's hidden him? &gt;&gt; See, he took I I I went over that. So, and to think of that, he changed his mask again. He He changes his mask down through the ages. And And I love this. He set aside his robe and his crown. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He set aside his robe and his crown and his throne &gt;&gt; to sleep on the side of the road, &gt;&gt; to sleep in the ditch, to stay in the woods, to be poor, to be all these things, and to taste death, and to take the penalty of death upon him. That's that's where he hid himself. They &gt;&gt; to me, that's just the most amazing thing. He hid himself in that. And if that wasn't enough that he would elevate me to his throne and to his crown and to the robe that he left. &gt;&gt; We should just stop there &gt;&gt; and think about that for like a year without saying anything, without speaking, without doing anything and think about &gt;&gt; how much you mean to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If all you have is that and you don't have another word, that should be enough for you to say, "Lord, what do you want me to do?" &gt;&gt; Lord, how do you want me to live? Lord, how can I please you today because of what you've done for me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you have to realize that these that he's hidden in plain sight. See, it's like a This is what happens sometimes. Um I'm trying to I'm trying to rush, brother Steve. So this is what happens sometimes is when we when we sometimes when we hear, well, God is going to hide himself and then he's going to reveal himself and he's going to hide himself. The same thing happens when you read this piece of paper sometimes and you go, I'm lost. Like I this is so complicated that what do you mean? He hid himself again. So like where do I have to go find him? And then it becomes overwhelming. It becomes intimidating. But see, when he hides himself, he gets simpler &gt;&gt; and simpler and simpler each time. Not more complicated. &gt;&gt; But because I'm looking for complicated, I miss them. And this is going to be a weird analogy, but I was thinking of this earlier. You know, you could take flour and you know, you take a handful of flour and it looks pretty it looks pretty uh crushed up, right? But if you've ever baked anything or you ever take and run that flour through a filter, &gt;&gt; right? You sift it, run it through a filter, and all of a sudden at the top of it is going all these clumps of flour that you never thought were in there. Harden pieces. Sometimes a rock, sometimes a bug, you know, depending on where you get your flour from. And what you're left with is this like, oh, this is good flour. And then he hides himself and he sifts it again. &gt;&gt; He does. &gt;&gt; And then it's a finer it's a finer filter that he puts on it. &gt;&gt; And and you know what? Some are left behind because they don't fit through the filter. Because they are too big with their own ideas and their own accomplishments of how they're going to live this and the filter catches them. And you know the remarkable I was thinking about that. You know the the little piece of flower that makes it through is the one that is the smallest. &gt;&gt; Amen. The one who has decreased the most in listen in will &gt;&gt; in what you want to do in what you think is the right thing to do in and listen even in the way you think you should serve God has to be crushed and it has to be filtered out. Otherwise, you're trying to fulfill this. Even if you're just trying to fulfill that little piece and you give the rest to God, it won't work. &gt;&gt; It won't work. I kind of tore my paper up, so it's kind of hard to know what I'm talking about, but you know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; And it's And here's the thing is we can make the same mistake as the Pharisees made if we're looking for a God. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to go through this real quick. If you're looking for a God of 2,000 years ago, he's not that Jesus anymore. &gt;&gt; You say, "Shocking Jesus, wait, he's the same yesterday and today." No, no. His, Brother Brandham says his nature stays the same, &gt;&gt; but his form changes. his mask changes. So, he's not that same God. See, the the the Pharisees were looking for the Messiah, &gt;&gt; and they had their Bible and they had their word to the church, &gt;&gt; but they failed to see him right in front. And many people struggle with living a Christian life today because they're either looking for a God of 2,000 years ago, let's just bring it home, or they're looking for a God of William Brandham. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Watch. Okay. because he's not here's here's you you listen to a tape or you hear a message and you see the miracles and you hear like when I hear them I I I like I can't listen to a tape without tearing up. I can't listen to a tape without getting chills, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But if I say I want the God that's in that tape to come to me, I've missed it. &gt;&gt; Because he's not son of God. He's our son of man. He's now son of God. He's not coming to you. He's coming in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's hidden in you. So if you're looking for this is why people struggle with the message because they're looking for the God of William Brham to come present to to them &gt;&gt; and not realizing that he just showed you a preview of what God wants to do in your life. In you might be the only one. You might be a Joshua and a Caleb and there's two million believers. He wants to show you, listen, that was what it was like, but I but I've hidden myself now inside of flesh. And I know this is again, this is so basic, but yet people struggle with the message because when they start to look at God coming to them and he doesn't come to them in the way they think, they go, "Well, I mean, there's nothing to that. I don't know. He's kind of flawed. Well, I don't know. Maybe he was just maybe he's just like just like the Pharisees." Just like the Pharisees. And we we we throw a lot of shade at the Pharisees. There's a lot of that same that spirit hasn't left. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That Pharisee is long dead and gone. But that spirit that there is still attacking you. It's still attacking me. He's not coming to man in this day. He's coming in man. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's yeah, okay, that makes sense. That's kind of basic." But it's not basic because he's hidden. And that's why uh listen, that's why traditions and routines do not reap the harvest that the word says should be reaped in this day because the tradition keeps him outside of the church. Not those doors, &gt;&gt; this door. &gt;&gt; He's outside this door knocking on this door saying, "Hey, look, I want to show myself to you, but I can only do it in you. I am not going to clown for you. I am not going to say it's a wicked and adulterous generation that seeks out. If only the God of William Brandham would come here and perform that same miracle, I'll believe him. Doesn't that sound familiar? If you would just raised them from the dead, we'll believe you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; No, I'm sorry. You won't. You won't believe. If the God of William Brandham, Here's the thing is he has come and he has done things in our midst and sometimes we still find ourselves murmuring, &gt;&gt; right? worshiping idols. &gt;&gt; We got a pillar of fire sometimes hanging right over us. Visible manifestations of the Holy Ghost. And yet sometimes I still find myself. I still find myself murmuring and complaining. Oh, this light bread. Oh, mana again. Oh, quail again. &gt;&gt; It's a famine of hearing the word of God. Not a supply issue, an intake issue. &gt;&gt; Right. Uh, I got to close. The woman at the well was uh was expecting to see him. That's why she saw him. She said, you know, he started to have this conversation with her and she said, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet." You know, when Messiah comes, &gt;&gt; where did she get that information? &gt;&gt; You know what she was? She was in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She was in the word every single day. She was in the word. And she didn't say, "You got to come this way. You gotta come right how I like it. How I understand it." She goes, "You know," at first she didn't even believe it. She's like, "Well, wait a minute." And then she goes, "However, when Messiah comes and then he showed himself to her, and she recognized it in a in a conversation, what what looks to be like a 10-minute conversation because she was looking for him in the way the word said that he was going to come. That's what recognized. Can I read this quote? And then I'm gonna I'm gonna shut it down. But alas, the traditions of the church fathers in that day had by their tra traditions veiled the true mercy seat from the people. Just like the scripture read, oh well he says by your traditions you've t you made the word of none effect. By your traditions if they had knowed the scripture each piece would have come like the little Chinese tag. He's talking about the paper coming together. If they had known the scriptures, it would have fit together. If they had been taught the scripture, they would have seen the mercy seat. Listen, it's not just about being taught the Bible from Genesis to Revelations. If if I'm just going to I'll just declare what I believe. If you cut out the message of the hour, you will not understand what's in those pages of the Bible. &gt;&gt; I just going to be this is not time to mess around and beat around the bush. And I think most of you probably agree with this, but it's but there's a spirit that is attacking every single one of us that says, "Okay, that's good. He was a good man. He was a prophet, a prophet of God, but go ahead and just stick with that Bible and you'll be good." And then you can go see Brother Brandham say, "Yeah, just stick with that Bible." And you're like, "See, he said it." But he said more than that. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; See, brother Brandham, William Brandon was saying, "Stick with that Bible." But when God came through and spoke, he said, "Now listen, let me show you how I'm hidden today. &gt;&gt; Or do you want to just be a Pharisee believing that Bible?" And that's why it's such a it's such a line where the the deceived and the undeceived. It's a hair's line because they're going to believe the same Bible. And even maybe most of them will say, "The message is is good. It's true. I believe Isaiah the prophet, like the Pharisees, I believe." But they don't take what he says and mix it and then let the Lord have his way with the word. Amen. He was God suffer. I'm going to skip down men and women delegates to this con convention. I want to say this without respect of person in view of the today where we're here today. I'm afraid that traditions of the fathers, the church fathers has hid this from too many people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Since the Holy Ghost has come in these last days as prophesied and the veil has been rent, too many people try to hang their traditions of the fathers. Too many people try to put a veil back, but the veil's been torn. But they try to put a veil back and go, "Okay, this is our ceremony. This is our routine. If you want to receive God, you have to come through here." And that's just churches. I talk about just like Catholic church and thing denomin churches. Hey, if you if you want the truth, you got to be hearing it from this pulpit, from this minister, from this thing. I'm sorry. I thought it was God that we were listening to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I I think some of the best correction and some of the best uh ministering to my heart that I've gotten has been from my kids or somebody else's children or somebody who just says a word to me and I'm like, "Huh?" If I'm looking for it, you see, if I'm looking for it, are you looking for it? Too many people try to hang their traditions of the fathers and that's why they can't see the extreme. I love it. The extreme joy and peace and things that the church has today. There's people that look over at somebody who's joyful and it's like, why is that person joyful? &gt;&gt; Why are they being Wait a minute. Why are they being so joyful? is because they've recognized something and you can recognize it too. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in plain view of those who believe the traditions has made avail. So that's where the people try to blindfold so many people by their traditions and you fail to see why those people are so elated and so enthused and these these conventions are such so odd, such a strange thing because those people have broke through a barrier. And there's people that don't understand when somebody's broke through a barrier because they haven't broken through the barrier. And you can do one of two things. You can say, "I I don't need to break through that barrier. I I I know I have the Bible. I don't I'm not saying anybody I don't need that. I don't need that." Are you hanging up traditions? Is maybe the breakthrough not so that you can jump and scream and shout and those things, right? Because that could be imitated. But maybe the breakthrough is to get you and I out of control of things. Us trying to live this, us trying to live the message, live the Bible. &gt;&gt; Maybe those things just to break us out of when it looks like when you are in control. &gt;&gt; When I'm in control, because I, you know, I don't know about you, but I just I love to be in control. &gt;&gt; Right? If we maybe I'm the only one, but I like being in control. I'm not saying I am in control, but I like to be I like to say that I am. You ask my family, they're like, "No, &gt;&gt; I like to be in control of my emotions, what I say, what I think." But I'm not. But this seems to be the easiest place for me to be in control. And God's like, I I want to have control. Sometimes control looks like wildfire, and sometimes it looks like a hush. But it doesn't matter. It's when he's in control. And I know they're coming out here. So, uh, man, I had more, but I think we're going to have another It's hard to get that momentum back. Um, but I think because of the sake of time, I'm going to stop. It's been 45 minutes. Uh, man, I got like a whole wheelbarrow full. I think we'll close. If I if I read another one, it's it's going to get long and I'm gonna get in trouble. I think they're preparing for the baptism. Brother Tom, um would you mind coming? I don't know if they're It sounds like they may be in need of another minute. Would you mind just coming and and singing a few songs? I'm sorry that was probably so uh mixed up, but um I maybe we'll be able to continue this. I hope I could start off with a little bit of momentum, but maybe you're like, "What does that have to do with the word to the church?" We've been every church age has been given a word to the church just like I handed to you. What are you going to do with it? Those trials and tests are coming. If they're not here, I mean, they're here already for for most of us, right? It's there to see how you're going to react. It's there to see what you're going to do, what I'm going to do. If if I it doesn't mean that they're not going to be hard, but if if they're more than I can handle, it's because I'm trying to handle them. And I know that's like it's so cliche and it's so simple, but but yet when I when I fail and I come back, this is exactly where I failed. And so until I don't fail this, I want to come right back to the same word and go, Lord, what what did I do wrong? And most of the time, if not all the time, it was when I tried to do it. is when I try to uh when I try to live it instead of letting him live it. It's when it's all those things. So again, um thank you for the time. I got paper all over the place. Sorry to the people clean the church. That was that was sister Kathy. I can't leave that one behind. So all right. God bless you. Brother Tom, if you want to leave a few songs. Thank you. You recognize this song title, Victory in Jesus. I heard an old old story. How a savior came from glory. how he gave his life on Calvary to save a rich like me. I heard about his groing of precious blood at my victory. Oh victory in Jesus my love with his redeeing love. He loved me here. I knew him and all is he to victory. Heat. Heat. to walk and he blind to see and then I cry Jesus and somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory. Oh victory in Jesus my savior and he with his redeeing he all to victory. very thankful to be here. We thank the Lord for what he's doing when he continues to do. I don't I don't know what the Lord's doing in our assembly. We have just different people just showing up &gt;&gt; randomly and they want to get baptized and and it's different than I've seen it and &gt;&gt; but I know it's the Lord's doing &gt;&gt; to this church soon as the Lord brought him to this church. I believe that &gt;&gt; because it looked just like my church at home. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Thank you. &gt;&gt; We're going to wash. We're going to baptize you, Brother Everett. And when we do it, we'll do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We don't believe the water washes you. We believe you're washed by the blood. &gt;&gt; But we believe something's happening on the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then it's you're manifesting that on the outside. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We'll have a a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just thank you for these brethren. Thank you for sending them to our assembly. Lord, &gt;&gt; we pray that we've been good witnesses for you, Lord, to these brothers. And &gt;&gt; heavenly father, as he testified, he would like to do this. He's done it before, Father. But there's an experience that he wants renewed. And &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, it's we don't believe it's absolutely necessary. Our brother would have to be, but he desires it in his heart, Lord. And if there'd be a question, we we certainly would want to answer that question with the word, Lord. And so we're &gt;&gt; doing this, heavenly father, and we're going to do it in Jesus name. And &gt;&gt; Lord, we'd ask that as our brother just would even come out of the water. May you renew that experience in his life once again. We claim it for your honor and your glory. &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Father Evan, I'm going to turn you around. This is the direction of the east. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And so this way right here. &gt;&gt; Okay. I might have you bend down just a squat down just a little bit so we can get you all the way under. Would that be okay? &gt;&gt; What's your middle name, brother Everett? &gt;&gt; Ever Douglas. &gt;&gt; Vaughn. &gt;&gt; Vaughn. &gt;&gt; Everett Douglas. Vaughn. I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I heard about a mansion he is built for me in glory. And I heard about the streaks of gold beyond the crystal sea. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. to victory the cleansing blood. Amen. I think maybe William we can stay in F. I'd like to sing I'm bound for the promised land. Now if you're an oldtimer and I had to ask Sister Kathy because I didn't remember for sure. This was the song that Sister Shirley and Sister Nancy and Sister Mary, we always played at baptismals. And um so much so little tell a little story here. So much so that we had the kids. Maddie, when your mama was little, we got a cassette tape recorder out and grandpa got his guitar and we've got tapes of the kids singing these songs. Well, the kids wanted to sing I am bound for the promised land. So, that's what we sang. And uh but it was so ingrained in their head of when we sang this song that when we got to the end uh and we got to the very end, Andy, who was maybe six at the time, he goes splash. because he knew somebody was supposed to be getting baptized. So, we'll go back, take a little something back, and it's just special for me because that's what's uh imprinted. It's imprinted on my brain, Brother Kurt. On Jordan's stormy banks I stand and cast a wishful night to There is where my pro will come and go with me. I am bound for the pro land. All mortal lighting extended rain shines eternal for my for me. I am bound for rising up. Okay, let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just thank you for this opportunity, Lord. This brother that you've sent to us, brother Jeremiah, Lord, we don't baptize him, Lord, but may you baptize him with your spirit, Father. Lord, as I was praying this evening, Lord, what would you have me to do with this situation? And as the words came out of his mouth, God can heal that. &gt;&gt; Then I just thought, Lord, if he's got that kind of faith, Father, then I believe, Lord, that you're doing a work and can complete it. Lord, be with our brother Jeremiah. Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. What's your last name? &gt;&gt; Jeremiah Way. What's his last name? &gt;&gt; What's his last name? &gt;&gt; Jeremiah Washington. &gt;&gt; Washington. &gt;&gt; Like George. &gt;&gt; Washington. Like George. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah. Praise the Lord. Face. This is the east like the direction of the rising of the sun. So face the cross, brother Jeremiah. And I'm going to have you get very, very low. Okay? Or I can put you all the way under the water. Okay? And I'll help you come out. Okay? Put this in. Okay? Scratch it down about to where I am. Face the same direction and just squatch down to where I am. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah Washington, &gt;&gt; you're doing good. &gt;&gt; Baptize you. You're doing very good. We baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got you. Thank you. First baptismal I remember in Flagstaff was Sister Kathy. A stock tank out in the middle of a field in January. Yes. had six inches of ice on the top. The brothers had to go out there and chip the ice off. If anything ever looked like a watery grave, that tank looked like a grave. But Sister Kathy would not be withheld. Lord bless her. Amen. &gt;&gt; 53 years ago, Sister Kathy. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could sing this third verse, third and fourth verse, and then we'll pray and dismiss. No chilling twins, nor poisonous breath can reach that hill. Take this and sorrow and death are no more. Oh, I down for the pro land. I down for the pro land. Oh, who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land. When shall I reach that happy place and be forever blessed? And shall I see my father's face and his I for the prois land. I am down for the prois land. Oh will come and go with me. I am bound for the promised land. If we could bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your mercies you've extended towards brother Everett, brother Jeremiah. Lord, let tonight be a milestone. Lord, let it be something that's been put down that they never have to listen to the enemy's arguments. Lord, they've passed this. Lord, they have demonstrated to the body, Lord, the stand they're making. We pray that you'd go with them. Bless them in the weeks ahead, Lord. might the blessing of this night not fail. Keep them, Lord, we pray. Be with our body as we leave, Lord. Be with our brother Dawn. Grant him your mercies, Lord. Come by. Lay your healing arm on him, Lord, we pray. Bless his body. Carry us safely through the streets, we ask, to our homes. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Good evening. You're dismissed. We have an announcement. So, Sister Vivian's memorial service will be here Saturday, December 27th at 10:00 a.m. in the morning. So, that's the Saturday after Christmas. And I'm sure there'll be more information passed on as the days go by, but you know that so that you can make plans if you wanted to be there. I'm sure it'd be a blessing to the family. Lord bless you. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Okay. Oh, you Heat. Heat. That's all. Hallelujah.
