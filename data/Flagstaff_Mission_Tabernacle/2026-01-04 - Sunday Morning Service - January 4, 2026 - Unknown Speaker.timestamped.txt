[19:15] Thank you
[19:35] Let's
[20:00] stand.
[20:02] Brother Ryan,
[20:04] I uh
[20:07] I say with this with boldness,
[20:10] the Holy Spirit, I know when the Holy
[20:13] Spirit's pleased. And you started
[20:15] playing by yourself and that's how I'd
[20:18] ask that you'd started.
[20:20] No other instruments and just let us
[20:22] consider. But you started playing How
[20:24] Great Thou Art.
[20:27] And I knew the Holy Spirit was pleased.
[20:31] So, let's just take a moment. We're not
[20:34] going to sing along. We're just going to
[20:36] consider the words and how they mean to
[20:39] each of us.
[20:41] How great thou are
[20:52] truth?
[21:02] merciful.
[21:34] We'll sing this chorus just before we
[21:36] turn the service. Brother Steve a great
[21:39] hell
[21:42] and sing
[21:44] my soul
[21:48] my savior
[21:51] God to thee.
[21:58] How great thou are.
[22:05] How great
[22:08] thou are.
[22:13] Then sing my soul,
[22:19] my savior,
[22:22] God
[22:24] to thee.
[22:29] How great th
[22:44] Lord bless you this morning. Welcome you
[22:46] to the house of the Lord. For those who
[22:47] are visiting or guests,
[22:51] everybody's family.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Sure. The blood of Jesus Christ unites
[22:56] us in a special way. It's a deeper
[23:01] connection than a mother and father
[23:06] would be to their son or daughter. So,
[23:08] we welcome you and we're happy to
[23:11] worship with you this morning.
[23:14] Some days there's like no prayer
[23:17] requests that are written in and then
[23:18] some days there's
[23:20] seven.
[23:22] This is one of those days. And so we're
[23:25] going to take these before the Lord and
[23:29] mention them one by one. And as you hear
[23:32] them, would you just place them on your
[23:35] heart as well when we pray, we'll pray
[23:38] together for these that the Lord would
[23:39] meet these needs.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; First one for brother Tom and sister
[23:43] Cindy. They're at home not feeling well,
[23:46] still battling a little illness.
[23:50] Much of my family is down in Tucson for
[23:53] baby dedication. I know that's why many
[23:55] of you are here. So, praise the Lord. My
[23:59] parents are here. I thought you were
[24:01] going to be at the dedication. Okay.
[24:03] Praise the Lord. But the rest of them
[24:05] are traveling. So, remember them.
[24:07] Traveling mercies.
[24:09] Sister Rose is suffering from some
[24:11] dental work and Sister Belle isn't
[24:15] feeling well today. So, please remember
[24:17] Sister Rose and Sister Belle.
[24:20] from Sister Cynthia. Please remember
[24:22] Katherine. She needs a touch from the
[24:24] Lord today. We certainly will.
[24:28] For brother Will Rogers writes in for
[24:31] his brother-in-law, Billy Rose. He's
[24:33] having complications with his heart or
[24:36] possibly a stroke. Sounds like that's
[24:40] just happened or recently written in.
[24:43] And then for Zach Bedair
[24:46] uh situation won't go into too much
[24:48] detail but it's very complicated and we
[24:52] really need to lift him up. So we will
[24:56] remember
[24:57] the Bedair family and especially Zach.
[25:01] Then in the last two days,
[25:06] um, brother Kirk called and said on
[25:08] Friday he took a fall or something
[25:10] happened with his knee and and he asked
[25:13] that,
[25:14] uh, he would find the right doctor to
[25:16] manage the situation with a meniscus
[25:18] tear. And then yesterday, Sister Diana
[25:21] Brissy fell and broke her kneecap. And
[25:25] then my wife's aunt, Sister Ruth, fell
[25:28] and broke her nose.
[25:30] And another brother here fell and was
[25:33] serious. He was prayed for and the Lord
[25:35] touched him and it seemed like the devil
[25:37] was after us trying to get us to fall
[25:41] and it just happened just in a couple
[25:42] days. Four people just boom boom boom.
[25:46] And so be careful.
[25:48] But we have a healer and we believe that
[25:51] he's almighty and he's able to meet all
[25:53] these needs. We'll ask him to
[25:56] be with us this morning and to touch
[25:58] these ones who need prayer. Let's bow
[26:00] our heads together and please take each
[26:02] one of these on your hearts and pray
[26:04] with me. Heavenly Father, Lord, we'd bow
[26:06] before you. And Lord, my eyes fell
[26:09] immediately on this young man, Lord,
[26:11] that is in a dire situation, Lord, with
[26:15] a very serious circumstances, Zach
[26:17] Bedair. Lord, we bring that name before
[26:19] you. We lift it up, Lord. You know all
[26:22] things and you're in control of all
[26:24] things, Lord. And may you use these
[26:26] moments, Father, in lives of the ones
[26:30] who are struggling, Lord, or the ones
[26:31] who are in need. May you use them to
[26:33] draw these ones closer to you, Lord, or
[26:36] to bring them back to you, Father. We
[26:39] call this name out before you, the name
[26:41] of Zach Madair. That you would
[26:44] be there, Father, and go to this need
[26:46] and draw him close to you during this
[26:48] time, Lord. And for sister Katherine,
[26:51] Lord, as her mother wrote in, she needs
[26:53] a touch from the Lord. I can raise my
[26:55] hand in confession of that as well,
[26:57] Lord, this morning. I certainly could
[26:59] use a touch from the Lord. And I claim
[27:01] it. I believe that you're here this
[27:03] morning, Lord, and you're able to
[27:05] provide that touch. I claim it for
[27:06] myself and for this sister, for this
[27:09] entire body, Lord, in the name of the
[27:10] Lord Jesus Christ. Lord for brother
[27:13] Will's brother-in-law Billy Rose and
[27:16] this immediate situation with this hard
[27:18] or poss we don't know what it is Lord
[27:20] but you know and you've known a long
[27:22] time father that this would be an
[27:25] occurrence and then you're able to go to
[27:27] that situation and remedy whatever the
[27:30] situation would be Lord and for sister
[27:32] Rose we know dental work father so close
[27:35] to your mind sometimes it can affect you
[27:38] and make it hard for you to even think
[27:39] and Lord we'd ask that you'd give her a
[27:41] special touch and ease the pain. And
[27:44] Sister Belle, Lord, as well, Sister Rose
[27:46] that they're going through. We'd ask
[27:47] that you'd touch them. Would you go send
[27:49] a ministering angel, Lord, a ministering
[27:52] spirit into their home and comfort them
[27:53] and be there with them? And may the
[27:55] presence of the almighty God be there
[27:57] with them also this morning, Lord. For
[28:00] brother Tom and sister Cindy, no doubt
[28:02] watching online this morning. Lord,
[28:03] would you also be there with them and
[28:06] your presence may it fill their home,
[28:08] Lord? And Lord, for the ones who have
[28:10] fallen that we mentioned, Sister Ruth,
[28:13] Sister Diana, Father, Brother Kurt, the
[28:16] different ones. Lord, you allowed this
[28:18] to happen. And but Lord, at the same
[28:20] time, there's needs here. And we rebuke
[28:23] the devourer in the name of the Lord
[28:25] Jesus Christ this morning. And you said
[28:27] by your stripes we were healed. We claim
[28:29] that this morning not only for our
[28:32] brothers and sisters who have fallen,
[28:33] Lord, but for each one who would have a
[28:35] need on their heart, Lord, or maybe by
[28:37] an uplifted hand would need a touch from
[28:38] you. We'd ask that you'd go to meet each
[28:41] need, Lord. And especially and last, but
[28:43] maybe not least, would you come and
[28:45] dwell in our midst this morning, Lord?
[28:48] We'd you be here with us this morning.
[28:50] You're our invited guest, Lord. We
[28:51] invite you into the building. We invite
[28:54] you into our hearts, Lord. May your
[28:55] presence fill a welcome invitation in
[28:58] this building this morning, Lord. May
[29:00] the music go forth in worship and
[29:02] praise. And may you be praised and
[29:04] lifted up this morning, Lord. May the
[29:06] word go forth. May it be right, Lord.
[29:08] May it be pure. And Father, may your
[29:11] spirit go forth and water us, Lord. May
[29:13] we be washed by the water of the L of
[29:15] the word. Be with us this morning, Lord.
[29:18] We thank you for the privilege of coming
[29:20] here. Bless us with your precious
[29:23] anointing. In Jesus Christ's name we
[29:25] pray. Amen. Amen. Lord bless you. I
[29:28] guess you may be seated all except for
[29:31] sister Gabby and brother Chase.
[29:34] Is she here? Brother Chase. There she
[29:36] is. Okay. Praise the Lord. We have a
[29:39] baby dedication this morning.
[29:42] So, Brother Tim, I have I put my mic on
[29:45] so I don't have to hold. Brother
[29:47] Everett, God bless you. Brother Evers,
[29:50] the Lord has led him to move back to
[29:52] Indiana where his wife is and maybe um
[29:57] see how that goes there. So, we're going
[29:58] to pray with Brother Everett maybe at
[30:00] the end of service, but bring them in,
[30:02] Brother Ryan. You know the song, bring
[30:04] them in.
[30:10] Oh, bring them in.
[30:14] Bring them in.
[30:18] Bring the gent
[30:40] praise the Lord. What a precious gift
[30:42] that the Lord has given to this family.
[30:44] And we're very happy for you. who are
[30:46] happy in the Lord. And oh, you got
[30:48] pretty blue eyes. Well, maybe they'll
[30:50] stay that way. I think they will. Praise
[30:53] the Lord. I know I'm scary to look at.
[30:56] Praise the Lord. Let's just bow our
[30:58] heads together and commemoration of this
[31:01] day, this dedication, this child. And as
[31:05] our prophet taught us, rededicate it
[31:08] back to the Lord.
[31:12] Heavenly Father, Lord, in the the book
[31:14] of Luke, Lord, it talks about how
[31:17] children were brought to the Lord Jesus.
[31:20] And the Bible says that the disciples
[31:21] began to rebuke them and maybe say,
[31:24] "Don't do that." And Jesus stopped him
[31:26] and he said, "No, suffer the little
[31:28] children for such is the kingdom of
[31:30] heaven. Bring them to me." And he would
[31:33] touch them, Lord. And so in
[31:35] commemoration of that Lord, that moment
[31:39] in the scripture as it's recorded and
[31:42] commemoration of what our Lord Jesus did
[31:44] with children and how you taught us that
[31:46] unless we become like children, we will
[31:48] not inherit the kingdom of heaven. And
[31:51] so Lord, this child Emmery Sheay Wilson,
[31:56] Lord, we dedicate for a life of service.
[32:00] Lord, as brother Brandham taught us, may
[32:02] it may there be a blessing come to this
[32:05] home and may it be a a blessed life,
[32:07] Lord. And may you bless this home,
[32:10] Father. May you bless this child. May
[32:12] you go,
[32:14] Lord, wherever that there would be
[32:16] footsteps on this earth, Lord. May you
[32:18] be with those footsteps.
[32:20] May the life of service, Father, may it
[32:23] be completely dedicated to you,
[32:26] Lord Jesus. May you not only bless and
[32:30] dedicate this child but father would the
[32:33] whole home Lord as our brother Chase is
[32:37] father been gifted with a special gift
[32:39] of service and he served this body and
[32:41] sister Gabby Lord would you bless the
[32:43] entire home for a life of service Lord
[32:46] not only this child as we dedicate it to
[32:47] you but their entire home we ask that
[32:50] you'd be there and would you bless them
[32:52] Lord Jesus we thank you for this
[32:54] opportunity to hold a little child And
[32:57] as we feel it moving in our arms, Lord,
[33:00] may may we become simple also like
[33:02] children and just believe, Lord Jesus.
[33:05] Whatever your word says, may we take it
[33:07] to heart and trust in you.
[33:10] We pray this prayer in the name of the
[33:12] Lord Jesus Christ.
[33:14] Amen. Amen. Lord, bless you.
[33:18] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[33:23] Amen. Thank you. Thank you. you. I don't
[33:26] think we'll do a Psalms this morning,
[33:27] but God bless you. Praise the Lord.
[33:33] You're more than welcome to greet the
[33:34] one next to you if you'd like to. If you
[33:36] haven't seen Brother Steve, it's nice
[33:38] seeing you, friend. Brother Jerry,

[33:43] good to have my mama here. My
[33:46] mother-in-law,

[33:51] is to serve the Lord Jesus Christ.
[33:54] Brother Ryan, I'd like to um just sing
[33:58] the little chorus. All hail King Jesus.
[34:02] All hail Emmanuel.
[34:07] I have nobody else to praise this
[34:09] morning.
[34:13] If you'll indulge me, I little child
[34:17] back there that was just dedicated. I
[34:19] held her yesterday and I have a little
[34:21] fireplace that I
[34:24] sit at out back and
[34:27] I held her and she doesn't show much
[34:29] emotion. Brother Steven, you you know
[34:31] that she
[34:34] but I sat and talked to her and I told
[34:37] her how I enjoyed the fireplace
[34:41] and I have somewhere I'm going with
[34:42] this. God help me.
[34:45] I expressed to her what I
[34:48] saw in the flames. I
[34:52] I told her what I felt in the warmth.
[34:54] And we had these conversations.
[35:00] And as he's dedicated, I thought, Lord,
[35:04] that's the way I want to do. I can't do
[35:06] a whole lot to you, but I want to look
[35:08] at you. I want to hear what you have to
[35:11] say this morning.
[35:13] I want to hear how you tell me how great
[35:16] you are. I want to tell you I want to
[35:19] hear you as you express and
[35:22] so my heart soft and all hail King
[35:24] Jesus. So I sing it if you'd sing it
[35:27] with me and help me praise my King, my
[35:30] Lord.

[49:17] you know, we celebrated our little
[49:19] gathering together of our family last
[49:20] night. My wife decided most my
[49:23] grandchildren and uh a lot of my
[49:26] children haven't ever heard her father's
[49:29] voice. Well, it just so happens that
[49:31] it's on tape is a voice. Well, as this
[49:36] voice went out, I thought I remember
[49:38] that voice. I know that voice. I
[49:42] remember when he'd sit there and talk to
[49:44] me and he would get excited. Sister
[49:47] Cynthia, I can almost see him raise up
[49:49] on his toes like he did. And he would
[49:51] get a little bit loud down in Tucson
[49:53] because he told about something good
[49:55] that happened in his life. He told about
[49:57] a healing, but beyond that healing, he
[49:59] told about a salvation that just covered
[50:02] everything. And you know what? That's
[50:04] the way I feel like this morning. Amen.
[50:07] I just feel like something good is about
[50:09] to happen. Brother Jerry, would you
[50:11] pray?
[50:13] Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Do you have any father?
[50:19] Lord, I just want to tell you that I
[50:21] love you. Yes.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; I just want to thank you, Lord, for an
[50:24] opportunity to
[50:25] &gt;&gt; gather together around your name, Lord.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; It's just almost too much to think that
[50:32] the God that created all the heavens and
[50:34] earth, every mountain and valley and
[50:36] lake that we see also wanted to create
[50:39] men that he could live in.
[50:42] I'm so thankful this morning, Lord, as
[50:45] we give these tithes and offerings,
[50:47] Lord, that you might go forth and find
[50:50] that last one, Lord. May we also give of
[50:54] ourselves today, Lord.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Be expecting to receive something. We
[50:58] ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of course, I just feel like
[51:04] something good is about to happen.
[51:09] I just feel like something good on his
[51:13] way.
[51:15] He has promised
[51:26] Yeah. Heat.
[51:37] Hey,
[51:46] brother. This will be that very day.
[51:53] Amen. Why not? Amen. Amen. Sister Lexi,
[51:58] you have a song. So, she's making ready.

[52:03] Christians, eight Bibles in our Sunday
[52:05] school class this morning. want to make
[52:07] mention of that. There's also a few
[52:09] announcements that's uh in our bulletin.

[52:31] service this evening in the fellowship
[52:33] hall um for the Spanish-speaking
[52:37] uh people. Uh there's many around, not
[52:40] only our neighbors in the neighborhood
[52:42] next door, but there's others. So, want
[52:44] to make mention that's at 5:00 in the
[52:47] fellowship hall. Amen. So, amen. Lord
[52:50] bless you.
[53:11] It's okay.
[53:24] Is it assurance
[53:29] Jesus is mine?
[53:34] Oh, what a for taste
[53:38] of glory divine.
[53:43] air of salvation,
[53:48] purchase of God,
[53:53] born of his spirit,
[53:57] washed in his blood.
[54:02] This is my story.
[54:07] This is my song.
[54:12] Praising my savior
[54:16] all the day long.
[54:21] This is my story.
[54:26] This is my song.
[54:30] Praising my savior
[54:35] all the day long.
[54:45] submission.
[54:49] Perfect.
[55:03] Angels descend.
[55:08] from up above.
[55:12] Echoes of mercy,
[55:17] whispers of love.
[55:26] All is
[55:31] my savior
[55:35] and happy and blessed.
[55:44] Looking above,
[55:49] filled with his goodness,
[55:53] lost in his love.
[55:58] This is my story.
[56:02] This is my song.
[56:07] Praise my Savior Lord.
[56:12] all the day long.
[56:16] This is my story.
[56:21] This is my song.
[56:25] Praising my Savior
[56:30] all the day long.
[56:35] my savior
[56:39] all the day long.
[56:51] Amen. Truly praising my savior. Amen.
[56:57] If we can stand, change the order of the
[56:59] service.
[57:07] You wouldn't want me to be anybody else
[57:09] but who God made me.
[57:12] And if I was, then I'd be a fake. And
[57:15] you don't want a fake.
[57:20] I sit up here and I think some of you
[57:23] that don't know me, I'm just an open
[57:25] book. I think, Donald, why did you say
[57:27] that?
[57:29] Just keep your mouth shut.
[57:32] telling you what what I fight. I don't
[57:36] get to hide behind anybody. I'm saying
[57:38] that with all respect, but Satan just
[57:40] works on me
[57:43] with a will.
[57:46] You know, I heard a prophet one time say
[57:49] the same things.
[57:51] He said, "Why did I say that?" He said,
[57:54] "I'm sorry." In the next breath, Brother
[57:56] Steve, he says, "No, I'm not.
[58:00] And neither am I.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; If that's what it takes, Laura, just to
[58:05] show who I am, that God saved a wretched
[58:09] sinner, then I will make a fool for
[58:11] myself and myself each and every time.
[58:15] That's my heart's desire.
[58:18] I know no other way to be.
[58:22] I praise him.
[58:24] I don't hopefully make you feel bad.
[58:28] Look out and I don't want you to feel
[58:29] bad. It's a joyous occasion, Brother
[58:32] Gerald. We have everything to live for
[58:35] Jesus Christ for.
[58:38] If I in any way cause you to stumble,
[58:41] look past me.
[58:43] Look at the one that I speak of,
[58:47] the greatest one that I could show you.
[58:53] Let me present to you my Lord Jesus
[58:55] Christ.
[58:57] my simple way. The God of heaven
[59:02] per chance if you don't know him today
[59:06] may become so real to you
[59:10] in the state that you're in.
[59:15] Praise him
[59:17] for he knows all things.
[59:20] He's bigger than anything we could ever
[59:22] imagine. I don't know why I'm going on,
[59:24] but I'm not going to apologize. God
[59:26] knows. I gave him my lips. I gave him my
[59:29] voice.
[59:31] In moments
[59:33] like these,
[59:36] I sing out
[59:39] a song.
[59:42] I sing out a love song to Jesus.
[59:53] In moments
[59:56] like these
[59:59] I lift up my hands.
[1:00:04] I lift up my hands to the Lord
[1:00:14] singing
[1:00:16] I
[1:00:19] love
[1:00:21] you
[1:00:25] singing
[1:00:27] I
[1:00:30] love
[1:00:32] You
[1:00:36] see
[1:00:38] I
[1:00:41] love
[1:00:44] you.
[1:00:54] Let's just say more time to just lift
[1:00:57] your hands and worship
[1:01:00] This is your moment.
[1:01:06] I see.
[1:01:12] I see.
[1:01:21] Heat. Heat.
[1:01:33] Heat. Heat.
[1:01:47] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:01:57] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:02:28] I'm just going to say a prayer again
[1:02:30] before we go to the word out of Mark
[1:02:34] chapter 7. Sister Diane, I was just
[1:02:37] trying to not give too many details, but
[1:02:39] I understand, you know, I would never do
[1:02:40] anything, but she wanted the details to
[1:02:43] be known so that you can pray uh for
[1:02:46] this situation. So, Zach Bedair has been
[1:02:49] shot four times and is currently looking
[1:02:52] at surgery to remove bullets and
[1:02:54] fragments,
[1:02:56] and they're concerned about potential
[1:02:58] paralysis
[1:03:00] um
[1:03:02] and maybe at least one leg, it looks
[1:03:05] like. So that's the situation
[1:03:07] and now we can go to the Lord once again
[1:03:11] in prayer and and just pray also for the
[1:03:13] remainder of our service. Heavenly
[1:03:15] Father, we bow our heads once again and
[1:03:17] we
[1:03:19] acknowledge you Lord in moments like
[1:03:21] these. We have nowhere to turn.
[1:03:24] So we turn to you and we don't even know
[1:03:26] how to turn to you Lord. what direction
[1:03:28] you are. Many times we just turn to you
[1:03:31] in our hearts and we face you, Lord. We
[1:03:36] look upon you and we ask you to look
[1:03:39] down upon us, Father, and look down upon
[1:03:41] this situation and have mercy,
[1:03:44] oh God, on this young man and his family
[1:03:48] and the situation, Lord, that he's been
[1:03:51] shot, Lord. And there be surgeons that
[1:03:54] will need to go in and remove bullets or
[1:03:57] fragments and figure out how to do it.
[1:03:59] Let them not be
[1:04:02] not do anything Lord unless you lead and
[1:04:04] guide their hands, their scalpels, Lord,
[1:04:08] the whatever tool they would use to cut
[1:04:10] out the bullet or the fragment. May you
[1:04:13] guide every motion of that instrument,
[1:04:16] Lord. And may you, as our prophet taught
[1:04:19] us, the doctors can do what they do, but
[1:04:21] you're the almighty healer and you're
[1:04:23] Jehovah Rafa. And we accept that for
[1:04:26] this situation, Lord. We present it
[1:04:28] before you once again and ask that you
[1:04:30] would go and meet this need. And we pray
[1:04:32] for this service in the name of the Lord
[1:04:34] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Mark chapter
[1:04:38] 7. If you would turn in your Bibles.
[1:04:42] Did Brother Ravi come in? Oh, there you
[1:04:44] are. You're trying to hide back there,
[1:04:46] brother. Praise the Lord. Good to have
[1:04:48] you. And I see a daughter. I see a wife.
[1:04:50] Is that Victoria?
[1:04:54] Okay, there you are. God bless you. Do
[1:04:56] you have a son too? I'm trying to think.
[1:04:59] Okay. Brother from Georgia and came out
[1:05:03] visiting us. So, Lord bless our brother.
[1:05:06] He's a minister and a musician, I
[1:05:07] believe, at the church back there. So,
[1:05:10] good to have you with us. Mark chapter 7
[1:05:13] and verse 25, I believe. We'll start
[1:05:16] with seven, verse 25. And
[1:05:21] I had a title this morning. Maybe it's
[1:05:23] catchy. I don't know. I feel the Lord
[1:05:26] put this on my heart a few weeks ago and
[1:05:27] then I tried to figure out you know I
[1:05:30] try to not but taking it personally is
[1:05:33] the title taking it personally
[1:05:37] in verse 25 it says a certain woman
[1:05:39] whose young daughter had an unclean
[1:05:42] spirit heard of him and came and fell at
[1:05:46] his feet. The woman was a Greek, a
[1:05:49] Sarrophenician by nation, and she
[1:05:51] besought him that he would cast forth
[1:05:54] the devil out of her daughter. But Jesus
[1:05:57] said unto her, "Let the children first
[1:05:59] be filled, for it is not me to take the
[1:06:02] children's bread, and cast it unto the
[1:06:05] dogs." And she answered and said unto
[1:06:08] him, "Yes, Lord, yet the dogs under the
[1:06:12] table eat of the children's crumbs." And
[1:06:16] he said unto her, for this saying, go
[1:06:19] thy way, the devil is gone out of thy
[1:06:23] daughter. May the Lord added blessings
[1:06:25] to his word. You may be seated,
[1:06:28] taking it personally.
[1:06:31] Um,
[1:06:33] I think it's something we all do. Maybe
[1:06:35] we'll just talk honestly for a few
[1:06:37] minutes and I'll just speak to you from
[1:06:39] our heart. Uh, you know, ministers say
[1:06:43] this a lot. Well, I'm just preaching to
[1:06:45] myself. Well,
[1:06:47] there should never be a question up
[1:06:48] here. We're all just preaching to
[1:06:50] ourselves.
[1:06:51] And so, we'll just get that out of the
[1:06:52] way right up front that we're preaching
[1:06:54] to ourself this morning once again. And
[1:06:58] um in this story in the book of Matthew,
[1:07:01] it records the same story in Matthew
[1:07:04] records the woman as a a Canaanite. It
[1:07:06] says a woman of Canaan. And then in
[1:07:09] Matthew 15 verse 28 it says Jesus
[1:07:11] answered and said unto her oh woman
[1:07:13] great is thy faith. And the other
[1:07:17] recording in ma in Mark it says for this
[1:07:19] saying but Jesus says great is thy faith
[1:07:22] be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And
[1:07:26] as I was pondering this thought
[1:07:30] um I'll say it like this. It takes great
[1:07:33] faith when the word goes forth and it's
[1:07:37] true and it's cutting. It takes great
[1:07:41] faith to not take it personally. And by
[1:07:46] taking it personally, we use that phrase
[1:07:48] a lot. You know, it's an English phrase.
[1:07:50] And I I did look it up. 1850s, I think,
[1:07:52] is when it was starting to be used. And
[1:07:55] so as a phrase we use and and it doesn't
[1:07:57] really mean take it personally because
[1:07:59] how could you you know if uh Donald was
[1:08:01] standing up here and I pushed him and
[1:08:03] then I said Donald don't take that
[1:08:04] personally. It doesn't really mean don't
[1:08:06] take it personally. It personally
[1:08:08] happened to you so it did happen to you.
[1:08:10] So, you're going to take it like it did
[1:08:12] happen to you. But what it actually
[1:08:13] means is don't take offense
[1:08:17] when the word goes forward and it's true
[1:08:20] and it might be cutting and it might it
[1:08:23] might shock your system. It might be
[1:08:25] something that strikes you and hits you
[1:08:28] where you've never been hit before.
[1:08:30] Don't let it offend you in a way. And
[1:08:32] the word has a way. Okay. And the Lord
[1:08:34] Jesus in his ministry had a way of
[1:08:36] getting right to the heart of the matter
[1:08:40] and not pulling any punches or not
[1:08:42] trying to sidetrack like we do
[1:08:44] sometimes. We'll try to be nice to
[1:08:46] somebody and and we'll say, you know,
[1:08:48] oh, you know, you that kind of bugged me
[1:08:51] a little bit. Jesus would have just said
[1:08:53] it right out what the problem was or or
[1:08:55] if you make a mistake or somebody makes
[1:08:57] a mistake and you don't want to offend
[1:08:58] them, you'll try to be as sweet as
[1:09:00] possible. You know, you don't want to
[1:09:01] offend them. But the Lord went to the
[1:09:03] woman at the well and he said, "You've
[1:09:04] had five husbands and the one you're
[1:09:06] living with now is not your husband."
[1:09:09] And and that could have been very
[1:09:10] offensive. And if it, you know, it's a
[1:09:12] very it's a very direct statement and
[1:09:14] it's a very true statement and it's also
[1:09:16] a statement that identifies her as an
[1:09:18] adulteress and currently living in
[1:09:20] adultery. And so she's he just calls
[1:09:22] just calls it right out. And that's what
[1:09:24] the word does. But she doesn't take
[1:09:27] offense to it. She says, "Well, I
[1:09:29] perceive that you're a prophet. Are you
[1:09:32] what's going on here?" Now, she could
[1:09:33] have said, "Wait a minute." Like many of
[1:09:35] the Pharisees did. Now, who who made you
[1:09:38] the ruler over us? Or you make yourself
[1:09:40] God or you do. They said, "See, they
[1:09:42] reacted in a way where they took a
[1:09:44] personal offense." They took it
[1:09:46] personally. But it wasn't just they took
[1:09:47] it personally. It was directed at them
[1:09:49] when he said, "You Pharisees, scribes,
[1:09:51] hypocrites." It was directed right at
[1:09:53] them. So, it wasn't, you know, it's not
[1:09:55] you can't not take it personally. it's
[1:09:57] it's at you and but they but they
[1:10:00] reacted with offense. Whereas the woman
[1:10:02] at the rail well reacted with he's
[1:10:05] reading my life like no one else has
[1:10:08] read my life before. He's telling me
[1:10:09] exactly where I'm at, exactly what I
[1:10:12] need. And then and her reaction is you
[1:10:15] must be a prophet. And this this lady's
[1:10:17] reaction I'll call her a lady because
[1:10:20] obviously by faith brother Bham says
[1:10:22] this with or the Bible says this with
[1:10:24] faith without faith it's impossible to
[1:10:27] please God. So now it's not that she's a
[1:10:30] Canaanite, you know, that that that's
[1:10:32] going to be something that pleases him.
[1:10:33] And and if you're an American, that's
[1:10:35] not going to be something that pleases
[1:10:36] him. You might be a Jew, that's not
[1:10:38] going to be something that pleases him.
[1:10:40] But there's an inward Jew that that has
[1:10:42] the faith of the of the father Abraham,
[1:10:45] and that faith will be the thing that
[1:10:48] God looks at and it pleases him. So now
[1:10:51] she is she's see, you know, she's seeing
[1:10:53] the situation and and she goes to God.
[1:10:56] And the reason I say it takes great
[1:10:57] faith when the word comes forward and
[1:11:00] it's offensive to not take it
[1:11:01] personally. It takes great faith because
[1:11:03] what you have to realize is aside from
[1:11:06] whatever happens, whatever is said,
[1:11:08] whatever word, however, my life is
[1:11:10] exposed doesn't matter. I need healing
[1:11:13] for my daughter. And so he could tell me
[1:11:15] to go wash in the Jordan. He could tell
[1:11:17] me to like like Hezekiah, you know, put
[1:11:19] some figs on it and he could tell me
[1:11:21] anything. and and whatever he tells me
[1:11:23] because I have a great need and I know
[1:11:26] I've heard of him. The Bible says she
[1:11:27] heard of him. I've heard that he can
[1:11:29] heal that need. So whatever he tells me,
[1:11:31] I have so much faith in the son of God
[1:11:34] that that he could tell me to go wash in
[1:11:35] the Jordan, wash in the Mediterranean,
[1:11:37] run 10 marathon, doesn't matter. I I'm
[1:11:39] not going to be offended by it. He could
[1:11:41] tell me I'm a dog. I'm not going to be
[1:11:43] offended by it. I know that he can heal
[1:11:46] my daughter. And so you tell me what you
[1:11:48] tell me. this morning the word might go
[1:11:50] forth and and tell you what it tells
[1:11:52] you. Don't be don't take it personally.
[1:11:54] It's the word and not just this morning
[1:11:57] when you put a tape on or you read your
[1:11:59] Bible tomorrow. Whatever the word goes
[1:12:01] forth and it tells you it tells you how
[1:12:03] to dress. It tells you how to love your
[1:12:05] enemy. It tells you to to do good to
[1:12:07] them that that that persecute you and it
[1:12:09] tells you these things and you know that
[1:12:11] person offended me. Well, the word says
[1:12:14] love your enemy. And so, so now, no
[1:12:16] matter what the word says, if you have
[1:12:18] faith that Christ can can heal you and
[1:12:20] can touch your body and and can save you
[1:12:23] and and can give you eternal, if you
[1:12:25] have faith in that, regardless of what
[1:12:26] he tells you, you're going to go right
[1:12:28] to him. Tell me what you tell me. Clean
[1:12:30] up my life. Well, you Well, you're going
[1:12:31] to go, why? Because you think he has the
[1:12:34] answer. So, tell me what he tells you.
[1:12:36] You will go and you will do it. And so,
[1:12:39] so it takes great faith. And that faith
[1:12:41] is in the son of God. Of course, it's
[1:12:43] the faith of the son of God, but but
[1:12:45] really I I I just know he's the son of
[1:12:48] God. And and the Bible says she heard of
[1:12:50] him. And so her daughter's vexed and and
[1:12:52] and so she goes to him and but she
[1:12:55] believes that he has the answer. And now
[1:12:57] he looks at her and well, the children's
[1:13:00] bread is healing and it's not for dogs.
[1:13:04] And he might have said it like this.
[1:13:06] you're a dog and I'm sent to the to
[1:13:09] children the beloved of God and you're a
[1:13:12] dog. Why should I give you healing?
[1:13:16] And she didn't even argue with them.
[1:13:19] She didn't take it personally. She
[1:13:20] didn't take a personal offense like we
[1:13:22] do many times. Again, preaching to just
[1:13:25] we do many time where anything could be
[1:13:27] said and the word goes forth and and
[1:13:29] well and but she has a need and she
[1:13:31] knows the the one who can meet the need
[1:13:34] is standing right there. say whatever he
[1:13:36] says. I'm going to I'm just going to
[1:13:39] just tell me whatever. But she has to
[1:13:41] have faith first that he has the answer.
[1:13:45] And so you can look at, you know, uh uh
[1:13:48] there was a brother, well, I just won't
[1:13:49] get into it too much, but just posted
[1:13:51] something on Facebook and, you know, he
[1:13:52] left the message, per se, and got me
[1:13:54] thinking about this this once again. You
[1:13:57] know, I see it kind of stirring up. And
[1:13:59] and Bible study on Thursday, we're going
[1:14:01] to talk about these current events. You
[1:14:02] know, we see that we went down and we
[1:14:04] just took a president out and we just
[1:14:05] took him to our country and we're going
[1:14:07] to prosecute him. And it's kind of
[1:14:08] shocking that we would do that, but but
[1:14:11] you know, you see the world, Brother Bam
[1:14:12] said it like this, it's going to rapidly
[1:14:14] and more rapidly, he said, it's going to
[1:14:16] get worse and worse. And so now we're
[1:14:18] seeing, well, we well well, we had
[1:14:20] COVID. Okay, fine. Then Russia invaded
[1:14:22] Ukraine and and then now we got a pope
[1:14:24] from the United States and now we've got
[1:14:26] a war in Venezuela and and all these
[1:14:28] things. Well, it's going to get rapidly
[1:14:29] and rapid worse and worse. But if you
[1:14:32] think that the answer lies in the
[1:14:35] prophetic ministry of Malachi 4, you'll
[1:14:37] do whatever he says, whatever that he
[1:14:39] told you to do. Now, if you don't think
[1:14:41] that he has it, fine. I mean, you just
[1:14:42] go your way. God has the answer
[1:14:44] regardless. And and he'll be identified
[1:14:47] eventually. But if you feel Malachi 4
[1:14:49] has the answer, you'll go to the
[1:14:51] message. You'll find it on there. And
[1:14:53] whatever it says, you won't take it
[1:14:55] personally.
[1:14:57] or actually as we get towards the end,
[1:14:59] you better take it personally.
[1:15:01] We'll just but just not to get too far
[1:15:03] ahead. Now, I looked up the definition,
[1:15:05] so it's online, so I'm sure it's
[1:15:07] correct. You know, definition, it says
[1:15:09] it means to to take something personally
[1:15:11] means to accept to interpret, excuse me,
[1:15:14] someone's words or actions or events as
[1:15:16] a direct judgment or attack on you. Do
[1:15:20] we have that up there? I think it's
[1:15:22] there. Yes, it is. Y on you. So now,
[1:15:26] well, how could there if someone says
[1:15:28] something to you? Now you might say
[1:15:30] like, well, brother Steve, that was
[1:15:32] Jesus calling her a dog. But if my
[1:15:34] brother
[1:15:36] calls me a dog, now I but I could take
[1:15:39] it from Jesus. I could take it from the
[1:15:42] message, but you know my this other
[1:15:44] person I don't know if I can take it
[1:15:46] from and and I want to go to something
[1:15:49] Sister Lori Tamson this book she gave me
[1:15:51] and it was a few months before she died.
[1:15:54] It's called Crucified by Christians. And
[1:15:57] as I begin to read it, it just was so
[1:15:59] shocking to me the way that the man
[1:16:01] writing, I think it's from 94 or
[1:16:03] something. So, he wrote this book about
[1:16:05] his experience being crucified by
[1:16:07] Christians and how that that that that
[1:16:09] God had actually been the one that that
[1:16:12] did the crucifying of him. And he types
[1:16:15] it to Joseph where where Joseph was sold
[1:16:18] into slavery by his brothers and and we
[1:16:20] know the story and he's in prison and
[1:16:21] he's out and all these things. So he
[1:16:23] says God did that to Joseph because God
[1:16:25] had a great purpose in bringing Israel
[1:16:27] down to Egypt and he had to accomplish
[1:16:28] all these things and save him and and so
[1:16:30] God and so when when you attribute the
[1:16:33] things that happened to you, not to a
[1:16:36] person individually. It wasn't the
[1:16:38] person did it. God allowed that thing to
[1:16:39] happen to you. And she gave me this.
[1:16:41] Sister Lori gave me this book and I
[1:16:42] began to read it. So shocking, you know,
[1:16:44] I started arguing with it right off the
[1:16:46] bat. It wasn't God that was that person
[1:16:47] that did it. It was my wife that did it
[1:16:49] to me. Danette's never done anything to
[1:16:51] me, by the way. But anyways, it was
[1:16:52] just, you know, somebody bothered me or
[1:16:54] something and and and so it was them and
[1:16:56] and then as the more I got to consider
[1:16:58] the matter, I realized that that
[1:17:00] certainly God certainly, okay, yeah,
[1:17:03] Hitler, you know, he killed a million
[1:17:04] Jews and and the Roman church, you know,
[1:17:06] martyed millions. We understand all
[1:17:08] that. We're not saying that, you know,
[1:17:10] there's not some aspect of truth in
[1:17:12] there, but in reality, God allowed,
[1:17:14] brother Bam said it like this, to get
[1:17:16] the Jews down to the homeland where they
[1:17:19] were all scattered throughout the world.
[1:17:21] He said it was the tender hand of
[1:17:23] Jehovah.
[1:17:26] You're like, you want to argue with that
[1:17:28] just in your mental thought, but in
[1:17:30] reality, God allowed. So now take it to
[1:17:32] your own life. It's not the person God
[1:17:35] allowed that thing. So now here's what
[1:17:37] happens though when you attribute it
[1:17:39] then to God. Well, it's real hard to be
[1:17:41] angry then, isn't it?
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; It's a lot harder to be angry with God
[1:17:45] when that thing is done to you and it's
[1:17:47] personal attack and it's it's, you know,
[1:17:49] it's against you or whatever and you
[1:17:51] take it personally, but now you don't
[1:17:54] it's not your brother. And we'll get
[1:17:56] into the difference between an attack on
[1:17:57] the word, which you better defend, and
[1:18:01] an attack on, you know, what seemingly
[1:18:03] is an attack on you.
[1:18:06] Okay, I got to read this. I don't know
[1:18:08] where it I think you have it up there,
[1:18:09] Sister Paulie. Now, this is not from the
[1:18:11] message, so just would criticize me
[1:18:14] later for that. But anyways, here we go.
[1:18:16] This is from uh the book Crucified by
[1:18:19] Christians. When you were crucified at
[1:18:21] the hands of men, in reality, you
[1:18:24] entered into his crucifixion.
[1:18:26] Consider the circumstance which led to
[1:18:29] his crucifixion. Who caused his cross,
[1:18:32] his crucifixion? Who was it that plotted
[1:18:34] his Golatha? It was exactly who plotted
[1:18:37] yours. He actually desired that you
[1:18:40] enter into his sufferings. After all,
[1:18:42] you the believer are in him. Brother
[1:18:43] Brandham actually says, "We sent them to
[1:18:45] the cross. Our sins that did it also."
[1:18:48] God willed the crucifixion of his only
[1:18:50] begotten son and yours. Refusal to
[1:18:52] accept your crucifixion as holy from the
[1:18:54] hand of God only means you were not
[1:18:56] crucified. You were just mistreated.
[1:18:59] Only when you accept that it came from
[1:19:01] God. Only then is it a true crucifixion.
[1:19:03] The crucifixiction of a Christian comes
[1:19:06] from the hand of God and God alone. I
[1:19:09] know we want to argue. It's fine. We can
[1:19:11] argue about it later. But just look at
[1:19:13] it from the perspective. Now just say
[1:19:15] brother Steve he's approaching it from
[1:19:16] this angle now. So that when things are
[1:19:19] done to you that that that they hurt and
[1:19:22] and maybe you know you know in there
[1:19:24] there's a molding of your character
[1:19:26] that's going to take place and and
[1:19:28] something's done to you rather than
[1:19:29] attribute it to a person and put a face
[1:19:32] on it.
[1:19:34] It's just a spirit behind the face in
[1:19:36] reality and then behind that God allowed
[1:19:39] the thing to happen in the first place.
[1:19:41] We've got a quote on it to back it up.
[1:19:42] But anyways, so now so brother Brandham
[1:19:44] taught us you don't attribute something
[1:19:47] negative happening to you and you don't
[1:19:48] put a face on it because then you know
[1:19:51] that person you'll just never it'll be
[1:19:53] impossible for you to get over. I'm
[1:19:54] pointing to Donald. Never done anything
[1:19:56] to me either, brother Donald. I'm just
[1:19:57] trying to get an example here that that
[1:19:59] that when you put a face on a spirit
[1:20:02] then you get into a problem.
[1:20:05] You get into a big problem. Brother B
[1:20:07] taught this. Now you go listen to the
[1:20:08] don't take my word for it. But now when
[1:20:11] you don't when you realize that that
[1:20:13] it's something behind there that that's
[1:20:15] not the person but but there's an
[1:20:17] influence behind them. Brother Brandham
[1:20:20] said this who did it? God.
[1:20:23] When did he do it? Before the foundation
[1:20:26] of the world that if we come in an
[1:20:28] illegitimate birth through Eve's
[1:20:29] corruption, making us all her children
[1:20:30] and subject to death, then the sovereign
[1:20:33] God has to make a way to redeem his
[1:20:35] children. All the father hath given me
[1:20:37] will come to me. And no man can come
[1:20:38] unless my father draws him. Oh my. Now
[1:20:40] where's your big thing you done? You
[1:20:42] never done nothing. You ought to be
[1:20:44] ashamed. God who done all things. The
[1:20:46] will is working just right. Someone come
[1:20:48] the other day and somebody said
[1:20:50] something bad about me.
[1:20:52] And accusing me of something that was
[1:20:54] wrong. And I said, "Oh, forget it."
[1:20:57] See, we got to saints, we have to live a
[1:20:59] level that's we we got to be that we got
[1:21:02] to live a different level. So someone
[1:21:04] Brother Steve said something bad about
[1:21:06] you. Well, forget it. No, brother. Now,
[1:21:09] they really you better go address and
[1:21:11] blah blah. Forget it. Just here's what
[1:21:13] the brother here's what, brother Bannon.
[1:21:14] How he handled it. Forget it. I said,
[1:21:17] "How can you take it like that? That
[1:21:19] involves your family. Now, you Italians
[1:21:22] know if you attack me, no problem. You
[1:21:24] attack my family, now you're in trouble.
[1:21:27] But it's your family." Here we go. I
[1:21:31] said, "Oh my." I said that was
[1:21:33] predestinated
[1:21:35] before the foundation of the world to
[1:21:37] give me a trial
[1:21:40] that who predestinated it then
[1:21:44] there you go. So it wasn't that you know
[1:21:46] it wasn't just some random person but
[1:21:48] but God predestinated it to test you not
[1:21:53] so that he would even know cuz he knows
[1:21:55] but maybe so that you would know that
[1:21:57] greater is he that is in you so that you
[1:21:59] can overcome the greatest trial that he
[1:22:02] would that he would inflict upon you. So
[1:22:04] he predestinated that it would both
[1:22:06] accomplish the molding of your character
[1:22:09] and the demonstrating to yourself that
[1:22:12] you're able to overcome.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Now he says it like this. See here's the
[1:22:18] reason we don't attribute it to like a
[1:22:19] person, a face or whatever. He says I
[1:22:21] said, "Oh my my shirt, that's all
[1:22:22] right." I said, "How'd you do?" I said,
[1:22:24] "If I looked right down this way, I'd be
[1:22:27] falling all the time."
[1:22:30] See, if you just take it like that, just
[1:22:31] you'd just be falling all the time. My
[1:22:35] aunt, forgive me for using so many books
[1:22:37] this morning. I never do this. But
[1:22:38] anyways, my aunt gave me a book. I think
[1:22:40] I was like 12 or 13 years old. She gave
[1:22:42] me a book and in the book there was this
[1:22:43] phrase. Charles Swindoll says it. He
[1:22:46] said, "Life is 10% what happens to you.
[1:22:51] 90% is your reaction." And I like it. I
[1:22:56] I I like the phrase because things are
[1:22:58] going to happen in life, but but your
[1:23:00] reaction to those things really
[1:23:02] determines. Now, now we're going to get
[1:23:04] forward because I want to really prove
[1:23:05] the point here and use the message to
[1:23:07] prove it and back up what we're saying.
[1:23:09] So, do you remember I think it was in
[1:23:11] Oregon when the maniac came and and he
[1:23:13] was out of his mind and he was he was a
[1:23:15] big man and he came was it Oregon,
[1:23:17] brother Donna, that he came he came, you
[1:23:19] know, down the aisle to approach the
[1:23:21] prophet to beat him up to to to to hit
[1:23:24] him from from one end of the the
[1:23:26] building to the other to destroy him to
[1:23:28] destroy his just he just came to beat
[1:23:30] him up. The maniac did that. He
[1:23:31] approached the prophet and and and he
[1:23:33] had a he had ill intent
[1:23:37] in his mind. Now listen to this. And
[1:23:39] this is why I say don't put a face on
[1:23:41] it. I got message to back it up by the
[1:23:43] way. So now the man got real close to me
[1:23:45] and the people just hushed and and draw
[1:23:47] back his great hulked spit all over my
[1:23:50] face. How many of you have had somebody
[1:23:52] spit on your face?
[1:23:54] I have. That's police officer stuff. So
[1:23:56] you know it's kind of expected. Anyway,
[1:23:58] so now he said and I saw a couple other
[1:24:01] hands and he said, "You snake in the
[1:24:03] grass. I'm going to show you how much
[1:24:04] servant of God you are. I'm going to
[1:24:06] knock you way out in the middle of that
[1:24:07] audience. He was well able to keep his
[1:24:10] threat.
[1:24:12] May you just see this great big guy, you
[1:24:14] know, maybe like Joshua, you know, there
[1:24:17] just just just strong brother Brandon's
[1:24:19] strong guy. And he he said he was able
[1:24:22] to do it and he had the intentions of
[1:24:25] doing it. And I'm telling you, in my
[1:24:28] mind, I would have went, am I right with
[1:24:29] God right now? Did I repent for all my
[1:24:31] sins? Am I okay? is everything, you
[1:24:32] know, that's that we all like when sin
[1:24:35] comes in, we automatically look back,
[1:24:36] Lord, are we okay? Well, just just just
[1:24:39] confess before God your sins and you're
[1:24:42] okay. No, he says, but he didn't know
[1:24:43] God. That was the main thing I kept real
[1:24:45] still. Never said a thing in my heart
[1:24:47] was going out to him. He just spit on
[1:24:49] him.
[1:24:51] My heart's going out to him. Now, you
[1:24:53] can just imagine that it's got to be
[1:24:55] real.
[1:24:57] That's the key, too. You know, you can't
[1:24:59] fake it. They'll know. Okay. He says,
[1:25:01] "The people I've seen so much put on
[1:25:03] love till they're sick and tired of it.
[1:25:05] Be what you are. If you're a Christian,
[1:25:06] be one. God's grace will make you one."
[1:25:09] Praise the Lord. And a man walked closer
[1:25:10] to me and I loved him because that I
[1:25:13] knew he didn't mean that.
[1:25:17] I mean, he spit on him. He told him what
[1:25:19] he was going to do. He was well able to
[1:25:21] do it. And the love of God projected at
[1:25:25] that moment through the prophet of God.
[1:25:27] And he said, "He don't mean that. He
[1:25:30] don't he don't mean it's it's impossible
[1:25:32] to think. But what brother Benham
[1:25:34] doesn't do is he doesn't put a face on a
[1:25:36] demon that's trying to attack him. He
[1:25:38] says behind that man is a man that would
[1:25:40] really want to serve God. You know he
[1:25:42] just I think he says it but he likes
[1:25:44] that spirit but he he said he don't mean
[1:25:46] that. And and he just doesn't attribute
[1:25:48] it to you know a face. He says now
[1:25:50] notice what brother Bam says here. He
[1:25:52] says I thought
[1:25:54] this is the key saints. It's right here.
[1:25:57] He says, "I thought it's the devil that
[1:25:59] makes that man say that he's the man
[1:26:01] that would who would love his family
[1:26:03] like I do mine. He would like to eat and
[1:26:05] drink fellowship, but the thing of it is
[1:26:06] is because the devil has possessed him."
[1:26:08] Do you see that? Says, so now he doesn't
[1:26:11] look at it like I'm putting a face on
[1:26:13] this devil and that man is the devil.
[1:26:15] No, he's not doing that. He's saying
[1:26:17] behind that man, what he would really
[1:26:18] like to do is go home to his family and
[1:26:20] have a family and be nice, but the
[1:26:22] devil's possessed him and and he's made
[1:26:24] him do that thing. So now he's
[1:26:26] attributing it to somebody and now he
[1:26:28] can overcome and the key is that he
[1:26:30] thought correctly.
[1:26:34] That's the absolute key. Okay. Now he
[1:26:36] says he's a human being the same as I
[1:26:38] am. Those kind of thoughts.
[1:26:41] So he changes his thoughts.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Listen tomorrow, next day whenever
[1:26:46] someone comes up to you and offends you
[1:26:47] and it will happen. You'll get tested.
[1:26:50] Change your thoughts as soon as that
[1:26:53] offense comes. That brother or sister
[1:26:55] didn't mean that. Not even a brother or
[1:26:57] sister. That man or or woman didn't mean
[1:26:59] that. They would really want to live
[1:27:02] right. If if they could really just
[1:27:03] surrender to God, they would really want
[1:27:05] to live right. And so so I'm going to
[1:27:07] take it like they don't mean that. See,
[1:27:08] it starts up here. You got to start
[1:27:10] thinking right and and reject the evil
[1:27:12] thoughts that come and and accept the
[1:27:14] truth of God Almighty. Okay? Those kind
[1:27:17] of thoughts. See, he thought I
[1:27:19] highlighted that for a reason. Those
[1:27:20] kind of thoughts. See, he's he's he's
[1:27:22] thinking. And then he says this, "And
[1:27:24] you can't do that
[1:27:26] unless God does it for you."
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, now we're all just weak and we need
[1:27:32] his help and we can't do anything unless
[1:27:34] he helps us. And if he doesn't help us,
[1:27:36] we just If you start there with
[1:27:38] humility, Lord, I'm a dog.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; I'm nothing. Lord, your original people
[1:27:43] were the Jews, but thank God you turn to
[1:27:45] the Gentiles. And but Lord, still we're
[1:27:47] nothing unless you can come in and and
[1:27:50] dwell in our beings. I can't even love
[1:27:52] my brother a lot of love unless you come
[1:27:55] and do it for me. I see it's a totally
[1:27:57] different uh thought process. I think I
[1:28:00] skipped over it, sister Pauly. But let's
[1:28:02] go back to Matthew 5. Listen, you have
[1:28:04] heard Matthew 5:43. I've heard that has
[1:28:06] been said, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:28:09] and hate thine enemy. But I say to you,
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; love your enemies,
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; bless them that curse you, do good to
[1:28:20] them that hate you, and pray for them
[1:28:24] which despitefully use you and persecute
[1:28:27] you. That's the kind of level of
[1:28:31] Christian that we've got to be we've got
[1:28:33] to be demonstrating to the world.
[1:28:35] Brother Bam says this now. Now he's
[1:28:37] talking about people coming in in prayer
[1:28:39] lines. He might even be standing at the
[1:28:41] platform and and how the how just seeing
[1:28:44] everything take place in the in the
[1:28:45] realm and the dimensions that you are
[1:28:47] you and I couldn't see into. But he says
[1:28:49] this, you don't realize every one of you
[1:28:51] is a spirit. There's a body declaring
[1:28:53] you. But everyone's a spirit. And a lot
[1:28:55] of you sitting here looking around.
[1:28:56] You're lovely. I love you and God knows
[1:28:58] that. See, but your faith is in this
[1:29:00] first person here. It's this first
[1:29:01] conscious. And when you look up way down
[1:29:05] in your heart, the least little fear
[1:29:07] will come in there. And now he's saying
[1:29:09] that now that person there, you know,
[1:29:11] maybe at the platform or wherever they
[1:29:12] might be and and you know, they look up
[1:29:14] and and they're standing really in the
[1:29:16] presence of God. And so the presence of
[1:29:18] God can see down into the depths of that
[1:29:20] soul. And then he says a little bit of a
[1:29:23] little bit of doubt will come and say,
[1:29:25] "I wonder."
[1:29:27] And he perceives that in that moment. I
[1:29:31] wonder how that just cuts me down right
[1:29:33] there.
[1:29:35] Why does it cut him down? Because the
[1:29:37] the angel told him, you get the people
[1:29:39] to believe you. So it cuts him down
[1:29:42] right there that you can feel it just
[1:29:43] comes in like so he can almost feel it
[1:29:45] like a wind like that. I can feel it. I
[1:29:48] think, oh, I look over and think, well,
[1:29:50] God bless that man's heart. I know he
[1:29:52] didn't mean that. Think about that now.
[1:29:54] He's looking at a person and that maybe
[1:29:56] there's a prayer about to be said and
[1:29:58] and and the the the spirit is discerning
[1:30:01] down into their soul and he takes a
[1:30:04] personal he really takes it personally
[1:30:06] but he doesn't if you know what I mean.
[1:30:08] So he he knows that he's got to get the
[1:30:10] people to believe him. And so he needs
[1:30:11] to get the people to and there's someone
[1:30:13] there and he's talking to him and and
[1:30:15] then the someone he's talking to starts
[1:30:17] to doubt and say, "I wonder." And the
[1:30:20] prophet standing intercedes for him and
[1:30:23] he says, "Lord, he didn't even mean
[1:30:24] that.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's it's so great, saints. We don't
[1:30:29] even understand how great it is." I look
[1:30:32] over there. Well, God bless that man. I
[1:30:34] know he didn't mean that. Didn't mean
[1:30:35] what? He didn't mean to just have that
[1:30:36] moment of doubt, that moment of
[1:30:38] weakness. And here and something back
[1:30:40] here. I wonder how then to wonder. He
[1:30:43] makes a blowing on this side back here.
[1:30:45] You think, oh, they don't mean it. Bless
[1:30:47] their heart. There's just doubt going on
[1:30:50] all over the place. And to combat that
[1:30:53] doubt, he's using this phrase, they
[1:30:56] don't mean that.
[1:30:58] See, he's not taking it personally
[1:31:01] like I might. you know, someone got up
[1:31:04] and walked out today and, you know,
[1:31:06] walked to the back door and looked
[1:31:07] around and then walked out. I might take
[1:31:10] it a little personally, you know, but
[1:31:11] but really my thought should be they
[1:31:13] don't mean that.
[1:31:18] See, and I think if we do that now, what
[1:31:20] I what I would like is a mature church.
[1:31:25] so mature
[1:31:27] that every time Satan tried to come in
[1:31:30] and plant that seed of bitterness or
[1:31:33] conflict or you know some sort of
[1:31:36] meanness one against the other that that
[1:31:38] that the immediate response would be
[1:31:42] that person doesn't mean that hey
[1:31:44] brother Steve you know so and so said
[1:31:46] that you you missed it on that quote
[1:31:48] there that's not accurate oh brother I I
[1:31:51] don't think they meant that they
[1:31:52] probably just misunderstood Good. You
[1:31:55] see that changes everything right there.
[1:31:57] It just stops it right there. Now, now,
[1:31:59] not just for me, now for you where where
[1:32:01] where that you know, you might even take
[1:32:04] a f Well, let me tell you something that
[1:32:05] happened. Six months ago, I haven't even
[1:32:08] told brother Donald this. Six months
[1:32:10] ago, a brother had told me he had a song
[1:32:12] special.
[1:32:14] And you know, I've got a lot going on
[1:32:15] before service. If you ever need
[1:32:16] anything, by the way, write it down
[1:32:17] because if you tell me, it's I get eight
[1:32:20] seconds, it's there, and then it's gone,
[1:32:21] you know. And so he told me at a song
[1:32:25] special and I I forgot to tell brother
[1:32:27] Donald.
[1:32:28] And then a few weeks ago the brother
[1:32:30] confessed to me that he he thought
[1:32:32] brother Donald didn't like him
[1:32:34] because he didn't have him sing the song
[1:32:36] special.
[1:32:38] And I went to I said, "Brother, that's
[1:32:40] actually my fault. I forgot to tell him.
[1:32:45] I'm sorry. That's my don't hold again.
[1:32:47] It's all on me." But see in the mind he
[1:32:50] said now this brother said look I'm a
[1:32:51] mature Christian I don't need to sing no
[1:32:53] big deal but but see in the mind it
[1:32:56] starts to get in there well that brother
[1:32:58] Donald don't like me and he don't like
[1:33:00] my singing and it really it wasn't none
[1:33:02] of that it was brother what should have
[1:33:04] happened brother Steve probably forgot
[1:33:06] to give it to him more likely by the way
[1:33:08] if that ever happens so that's your
[1:33:11] thoughts see brother Brandon says
[1:33:13] thoughts like that thoughts like he
[1:33:15] don't mean that and he he has a you He
[1:33:18] has a family and he'd really like to go
[1:33:20] home to his family and and and you know
[1:33:22] later on now this is I I think this is
[1:33:24] the man. Correct me if I'm wrong. I
[1:33:26] think this is the man that brother
[1:33:28] Brandham said that he you know he got
[1:33:29] delivered or whatever and then I think
[1:33:32] brother Brandham like like did something
[1:33:35] and he just fell at his feet. Is that
[1:33:36] not correct?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; And then he was drugg out and then
[1:33:39] brother Ram says later he liked that
[1:33:41] spirit. Is that is that correct?
[1:33:45] Now, that's a man who enjoys that
[1:33:47] spirit. Nevertheless,
[1:33:50] he's still saying things like he don't
[1:33:53] mean that.
[1:33:55] He he he would like to have a family and
[1:33:57] love him. You see, I mean, as bad as you
[1:33:59] can make somebody a maniac who wants to
[1:34:02] beat you up and throw you out and then
[1:34:04] is delivered momentarily from the spirit
[1:34:07] and then he likes it and it comes back
[1:34:08] on him. Well, guess what? It doesn't
[1:34:10] matter. He still had those kind of
[1:34:12] thought. He didn't take it personally.
[1:34:16] Oh, making we're making the point here.
[1:34:18] And I I think and that's why I brought
[1:34:20] up the church. I would like a church
[1:34:21] church that that anytime
[1:34:25] it should we don't take it personally.
[1:34:26] We just say things like he didn't mean
[1:34:28] that. They didn't mean that. Probably
[1:34:29] misinterpreted.
[1:34:31] You know, probably brother Steve didn't
[1:34:33] have my song special. By the way, I you
[1:34:35] know, if anyone gets their song specials
[1:34:37] canled more than it's probably my
[1:34:39] daughter. She wants to sing every
[1:34:41] service, you know, bless her heart. So,
[1:34:43] if anybody can complain, where's she at?
[1:34:45] Love you, Sister Liberty. She could, but
[1:34:48] I'm getting a look over here. Oh, boy. I
[1:34:50] didn't mean that.
[1:34:52] Praise the Lord. Brother Bam says this.
[1:34:54] And notice,
[1:34:57] another thing I'd like to say amongst
[1:35:00] the Pentecostal people, there's one
[1:35:01] thing that we're forgetting, friends, is
[1:35:03] our Pentecostal courtesy. See, parking
[1:35:06] in lots. Sometimes I've noticed our
[1:35:08] Pentecostal brethren when you could
[1:35:10] really really real pull in and give
[1:35:12] somebody else a chance to park by the
[1:35:14] side of you, you drive in it anyway
[1:35:16] because somebody really makes what we
[1:35:18] call a boo boo on the road. You fly
[1:35:20] loose and tear down. Listen, that's not
[1:35:25] the way to be a Pentecostal Christian.
[1:35:28] See, let's consider the next man. Oh, I
[1:35:31] can I can confess right here. were
[1:35:33] driving home from Phoenix the other day
[1:35:34] and someone I was in the lane and this
[1:35:37] person just kind of drove by me and they
[1:35:39] made a boo boo Donnie and I started
[1:35:42] catch up to him you know and I think
[1:35:44] sister Dette said something like well
[1:35:45] you go with your Christian self you know
[1:35:48] and I was I was like oh
[1:35:52] wish you weren't in the car you know but
[1:35:54] anyways no not really but but you know
[1:35:56] it just gets
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; it just you just if you're not careful
[1:36:00] and that's me too brother Donnie not
[1:36:01] just you battle those things that
[1:36:03] someone pulled out in front of you and
[1:36:04] immediately and so so now what if you
[1:36:06] took that to even you're just driving
[1:36:08] you just they didn't mean that that
[1:36:10] person just don't know how dangerous it
[1:36:12] is on the roads if they knew and start
[1:36:14] praying for him now how see I think
[1:36:16] that's maturity in the body that that we
[1:36:19] need to to get to if a you know things
[1:36:21] that were said about us and and if you
[1:36:23] just realize it's not person it's Satan
[1:36:26] trying to get you it's not even the
[1:36:27] person it's Satan trying to upset your
[1:36:30] spirit and and to get you all riled held
[1:36:32] up and and just don't pay attention to
[1:36:34] it. Now, I'm going give you an example
[1:36:37] in scripture. Galatians 2:9. We're going
[1:36:39] to fast forward. I know we don't.
[1:36:42] That's all right. Okay. And when James,
[1:36:43] Cphus, and John, now Paul's talking,
[1:36:46] he's talking to Galatians, they're
[1:36:47] dealing with this Jew, Gentile subject,
[1:36:50] you know, who seem to be pillars,
[1:36:52] perceive the grace that was given to me.
[1:36:54] They gave to me and Barnabas the right
[1:36:56] hands of fellowship that we should go
[1:36:57] into the heathen and and they to the
[1:36:59] circumcision. And he's identifying that
[1:37:01] he will go to the Gentiles and them to
[1:37:03] the Jews. Only they would that we should
[1:37:06] remember the poor the same which I was
[1:37:07] also forward to do.
[1:37:10] But when Peter was come to Antioch,
[1:37:14] I withtood him to the face
[1:37:17] because he was to be blamed.
[1:37:22] Now Paul went to Peter stand up brother
[1:37:24] Donald and he did this publicly by the
[1:37:27] way
[1:37:30] and he withtood him to the face and he
[1:37:33] rebuked what he was doing and he said
[1:37:36] something like Peter
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; you're a hypocrite
[1:37:40] you are eating with the Gentiles when
[1:37:42] the Jews come you won't eat with them
[1:37:43] shame on you and it's causing division
[1:37:45] in the body
[1:37:48] that's what he did forgive me brother
[1:37:49] Donald that's what he did He rebuked
[1:37:52] them public and then he announces it in
[1:37:54] a letter 2,000 years later. We're still
[1:37:57] reading that Peter got rebuked.
[1:38:01] I mean, that's a public rebuke. If you
[1:38:03] ever been rebuked publicly, that's about
[1:38:04] as public as you can get. Now, I put a
[1:38:06] New Living Translation up here. It says
[1:38:08] some I don't know if we have that. When
[1:38:10] Peter came to Antioch, I had to oppose
[1:38:11] him to his face for what he did was very
[1:38:14] wrong. And then Paul says this. Do we
[1:38:16] have new limit? Oh, perfect. Okay. Okay,
[1:38:18] the next one he says, "When he first
[1:38:20] arrived, he ate with the Gentile
[1:38:22] believers who were not circumcised. But
[1:38:24] afterward, when some friends of James
[1:38:25] came, Peter wouldn't eat with the
[1:38:27] Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of
[1:38:29] criticism from these people who insisted
[1:38:31] on the necessity of circumcision."
[1:38:35] Peter full of the Holy Ghost,
[1:38:40] but he had this weak spot, and we'll say
[1:38:42] it like that because he he does have
[1:38:43] that thing. You can see it all out the
[1:38:46] scriptures when when you know he would
[1:38:47] even when he would deny the Lord it was
[1:38:49] he didn't want you know he had that as a
[1:38:51] weak spot maybe an inferiority compl
[1:38:53] whatever you call it but now Paul Paul
[1:38:57] is taking personal offense but he's not
[1:39:00] taking it personally in his spirit to
[1:39:01] Paul the person but he's taking
[1:39:04] personally the person of Jesus Christ
[1:39:08] which Peter represents
[1:39:11] Paul is saying you're offending
[1:39:13] offending the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:17] You're offending the ministry of Jesus
[1:39:20] Christ. You're offending Jesus Christ
[1:39:22] himself. And I stand here in defense of
[1:39:24] the gospel. So, it's not Paul attacking
[1:39:28] Peter. It's Christ
[1:39:31] identifying the truth of the word and
[1:39:34] dealing with a situation that needs to
[1:39:36] be dealt with.
[1:39:39] And he does. And now he said Paul,
[1:39:41] Peter, he, you know, he names him. But
[1:39:43] the fact is he just is calling out a
[1:39:45] situation and he's dealing with it. Why?
[1:39:47] And he'll tell us in the next verse
[1:39:48] here. He says it something like this.
[1:39:50] And all the other as a result other
[1:39:52] Jewish believers followed Peter's
[1:39:54] hypocrisy and even Barnabas was led
[1:39:57] astray by their hypocrisy. No. So now
[1:39:59] Peter's saying or Paul saying this,
[1:40:01] listen Peter, you're not just you, you
[1:40:03] know, if you're a hypocrite, whatever.
[1:40:04] You're a hypocrite, but you're leading.
[1:40:07] See, you're taking the gospel which I
[1:40:09] represent personally. But he's not
[1:40:12] personally taking offense, but he's
[1:40:15] realizing that the gospel, which is the
[1:40:18] person of Jesus Christ, is being
[1:40:20] offended,
[1:40:22] misrepresented
[1:40:24] by Peter. And now he's saying, "Listen,
[1:40:27] Peter, you are the hypocrite. You're
[1:40:30] doing something." And it's causing
[1:40:31] division in the church. Even Barnabas is
[1:40:34] being led astray. So now he has to deal
[1:40:38] with it. Why? because it's infecting the
[1:40:40] the the gospel that he believes and he's
[1:40:42] not going to stand for it. And that's
[1:40:44] the difference, saints, where you can
[1:40:45] take the gospel and you can take an
[1:40:48] offense of the gospel personally, but
[1:40:50] it's not you. But you see that Christ is
[1:40:52] being misrepresented and then you go to
[1:40:55] that situation and you say, "You're
[1:40:57] misrepresenting the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:00] and I take offense as a member of that
[1:41:02] body."
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Well, do you see it saying? Do you see
[1:41:05] the the twist now?
[1:41:08] So, it's not, you know, someone
[1:41:10] attacking you personally. Paul Paul
[1:41:12] wasn't being attacked personally at all,
[1:41:15] but Peter was misrepresenting the
[1:41:18] gospel.
[1:41:19] And Paul personally represented the
[1:41:22] gospel. And he didn't want to be
[1:41:24] identified with a gospel that made
[1:41:27] dissimulation or a difference between
[1:41:30] Jews and Gentiles or cause division in
[1:41:33] the church.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be identified with
[1:41:36] that, Peter. So he calls it out.
[1:41:40] Now the Bible doesn't record Peter's
[1:41:42] reaction.
[1:41:44] This records he withtood him to his
[1:41:46] face. You know, I would have liked to
[1:41:48] have been there personally. Maybe. But
[1:41:51] Steve, maybe they got in a fist fight
[1:41:52] and the Bible's just like, "Well, we'll
[1:41:53] just leave that part out." You know, I
[1:41:55] don't know what happened. But I will
[1:41:57] tell you, we'll just read second Peter.
[1:42:00] Is it okay if we read second Peter?
[1:42:04] Now listen,
[1:42:05] this is the scripture saints. Chapter
[1:42:07] three, Peter's talking. He says, "But
[1:42:09] we're looking forward to the new heavens
[1:42:11] and new earth. He has promised a world
[1:42:13] filled." By the way, Galatians was
[1:42:15] written in 4744 to 47 AD.
[1:42:21] Second Peter was written 65-68
[1:42:26] a AD. So 20 years later, Peter's writing
[1:42:28] this. Now you're gonna find out what
[1:42:30] does Peter think of Paul
[1:42:34] 20 years. Sometimes it takes 20 years
[1:42:36] for us to get over stuff, you know.
[1:42:37] That's okay. Okay. And so dear friends,
[1:42:40] verse 14, do we have that?
[1:42:46] Uh yeah, there we go. We're looking for
[1:42:48] a new heavens. He's prom. And so I don't
[1:42:50] know what version I'm reading here. So
[1:42:52] difference verse 14. While you are
[1:42:55] waiting for these things to happen, make
[1:42:56] every effort to be found living peaceful
[1:42:58] lives that are pure and blameless in his
[1:43:02] sight. And remember, our Lord's patience
[1:43:05] gives people time to be saved. This is
[1:43:08] what our beloved brother Paul
[1:43:13] also wrote to you with the wisdom God
[1:43:15] gave him.
[1:43:18] So Peter withstands him or Paul
[1:43:20] withstands Peter rebukes him calls him a
[1:43:23] hypocrite to his face gives the reason
[1:43:28] later on Peter says our beloved listen
[1:43:31] what he says listen what he wrote to you
[1:43:34] he's writing with wisdom
[1:43:37] he didn't take it personally
[1:43:41] he took the correction
[1:43:43] and received it
[1:43:46] and and And and that's you know if
[1:43:48] anything God would would love for
[1:43:51] Christians would be to when he corrects
[1:43:53] you receive that correction and and just
[1:43:56] receive it say Lord thank you and help
[1:43:58] me Lord to do better and that's see
[1:44:00] that's Lord you know yes I am a dog and
[1:44:03] yes I did make that mistake you know the
[1:44:05] Lord looked at Peter one time said get
[1:44:07] behind me Satan
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; and Peter a couple verses later he's
[1:44:13] still there
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; you
[1:44:16] So now he says, "Our beloved brother
[1:44:19] Paul." Then he says this, you know, he
[1:44:21] wrote to you with wisdom. He says,
[1:44:22] "Speaking of these things in all his
[1:44:24] letters."
[1:44:26] Pay attention to what Paul says. Peter
[1:44:28] is saying, "Some of his comments are
[1:44:30] hard to understand, and those who are
[1:44:31] ignorant and unstable have twisted his
[1:44:33] letters to mean something quite
[1:44:34] different, just as they do with other
[1:44:36] parts of scripture. And this will result
[1:44:37] in their destruction." He's identifying
[1:44:40] Paul as this great letter writer,
[1:44:43] messenger to the first church age. and
[1:44:45] pay attention. But he's been rebuked by
[1:44:47] the very Paul.
[1:44:49] See, that's a mature That's a man full
[1:44:53] of the Holy Ghost. I just
[1:44:57] I know we're run out of time.
[1:45:05] We'll just go to the end here. We'll
[1:45:07] just go I I want to get these out if
[1:45:10] maybe it'll help somebody this morning.
[1:45:11] I was reading these quotes and
[1:45:15] And
[1:45:17] maybe you're dealing with something,
[1:45:20] you know, that and and one one lady came
[1:45:22] to brother Brandham and she asked him a
[1:45:24] question about I think it was a lady. I
[1:45:26] don't even know actually it could have
[1:45:26] been it's just a question and they said
[1:45:29] I you know we got stubbornness and how
[1:45:31] do I get rid of a stubborn spirit? God
[1:45:34] this stubbornness on me and how do I do
[1:45:36] it? Does anybody know how he responds?
[1:45:38] How you get rid of that stubbornness?
[1:45:41] Brother Donald,
[1:45:43] no. Anybody? You can guess wrong. That's
[1:45:45] okay. You don't have to guess. He says,
[1:45:47] "Ignore it."
[1:45:51] Listen what he says. Stubbornness is not
[1:45:53] of God. I'm fast forwarding a lot, but I
[1:45:55] want to get this. So, so,
[1:45:57] and now the only way to get away from
[1:45:59] that is you have to have faith to
[1:46:00] overcome that. That's if you're a
[1:46:01] Christian, you're a son or daughter of
[1:46:02] God, whichever you may be. And you will
[1:46:05] never be able to just stand and rebuke
[1:46:07] it and rebuke it and rebuke it.
[1:46:11] got something in your life you're just
[1:46:13] trying to keep rebuking that thing. You
[1:46:14] know, he says you won't be able to do
[1:46:16] with this. Anyways, I can't speak for
[1:46:19] every infirmity or temptation you're
[1:46:21] dealing with, but with this and the
[1:46:23] Bible does say resist Satan and he'll
[1:46:26] flee from you. So now it's just like
[1:46:28] tantalizing a rattlesnake. He's ready
[1:46:30] laying there ready to bite you. If you
[1:46:31] just ignore him and walk away from him,
[1:46:33] he can't hurt you. See? So when you feel
[1:46:35] that you got a stubborn spirit, lay the
[1:46:37] thing on the altar and believe God that
[1:46:39] the thing is dead and you'll never have
[1:46:40] it no more and go on and don't even pay
[1:46:43] attention to it no more and the thing
[1:46:44] will leave you. Resist the devil and
[1:46:47] he'll flee from you. That's get away
[1:46:48] quickly. So that would be in my advice
[1:46:50] of how to overcome it. We overcome the
[1:46:51] devil by faith. That's what we overcome.
[1:46:53] All evil is by faith. And when your
[1:46:56] brother, sister, fans or whatever it
[1:46:58] might be, the best thing, you know, if
[1:47:00] you if you can't if you don't have the
[1:47:01] faith to say they didn't mean that, just
[1:47:03] ignore it. at least just do that. Just
[1:47:05] ignore it
[1:47:07] or have the faith that they didn't mean
[1:47:09] that or they just misunderstood or
[1:47:11] whatever it might be. And that's how as
[1:47:13] a church we can thwart the devil. Now
[1:47:16] listen to this and this was shocking to
[1:47:18] me because I know you know if anything
[1:47:20] people come up for prayer lately is for
[1:47:22] anxiety or nervousness or those things.
[1:47:24] And so when I read this it really helped
[1:47:26] me. It'll be the last quote. So let's as
[1:47:28] the musicians come, we'll just read
[1:47:29] this. All right. Come lady, have faith.
[1:47:31] The very God of heaven is in your
[1:47:33] presence. You're in his presence. The
[1:47:34] very one that said to the woman, "Thy
[1:47:36] sins be forgiven thee." Notice what he
[1:47:39] say. He says, "How do you do? We're
[1:47:40] strangers. When you was five years ago,
[1:47:43] when when we was here, I saw you went
[1:47:44] through the line or something. You was
[1:47:46] healed. Then between you and I comes a
[1:47:49] dark shadow.
[1:47:52] It's shaking and jumping."
[1:47:55] And this hit me very I've never seen
[1:47:57] anything like this before. So, as a dark
[1:47:59] shadow shaking and jumping. Now, Brother
[1:48:02] Bam can see the shadow or the streak or
[1:48:04] whatever it might be, the demon shaking
[1:48:07] and jumping. What kind of demon would
[1:48:08] you think that is?
[1:48:13] There's only one thing that can mean
[1:48:15] that. That's a demon. And that's a demon
[1:48:17] of nervousness.
[1:48:20] Isn't that interesting? That demon that
[1:48:23] gets you all anxious and anxiety, he
[1:48:25] himself is a shaking, jumping demon.
[1:48:33] And it makes sense. You know, brother
[1:48:34] says, "Is that right?" You think
[1:48:35] sometimes that you lost your mind. Isn't
[1:48:37] that right? But he's a liar. You're not.
[1:48:38] You're just saying as anybody else, but
[1:48:40] he's trying to get you down, lady. You
[1:48:43] don't you pay no attention to that.
[1:48:47] Isn't that beautiful? See, that's the
[1:48:48] way is just don't pay no attention to
[1:48:51] that. just that demon is shaking. And
[1:48:53] then what? You can just see it in the
[1:48:54] spiritual realm. The the demon the the
[1:48:56] the streak that just shakes, then your
[1:48:59] spirit's right there. And and if you pay
[1:49:01] attention to that, then your spirit
[1:49:03] starts to shake. Now you're anxious and
[1:49:05] now you're nervous and and that shaking
[1:49:07] jumping demon has caused it. But brother
[1:49:09] Brandham gives us the key. The word
[1:49:12] gives us the key. Resist the devil and
[1:49:14] he'll flee from you. Ignore that thing
[1:49:16] and he'll go.
[1:49:19] He has to in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:49:21] Now he says that that was a beautiful.
[1:49:22] He says, "Do you believe me to be a
[1:49:24] servant? Lookie, let me tell you
[1:49:25] something. You've tried so long to even
[1:49:28] get one place you thought you just like
[1:49:30] you could put your foot, you could start
[1:49:32] from there.
[1:49:34] Isn't that right? I'm not reading your
[1:49:36] mind, but you was praying about that.
[1:49:37] Imagine this lady just if I could get a
[1:49:39] place to start from.
[1:49:42] I just I'm looking for like I just, you
[1:49:44] know, an anchor. We could say like that.
[1:49:46] I need a place I can put my foot and
[1:49:49] that's the place I can start from. Isn't
[1:49:52] that right? That's right. You said many
[1:49:54] times in your thoughts in there, if I
[1:49:56] could just get one place to start from
[1:49:59] is that this is your starting place.
[1:50:04] What a beautiful thing.
[1:50:08] Can you have that this morning? That
[1:50:10] that I think that's the question. This
[1:50:12] is your starting place right here. God's
[1:50:15] servant, thou devil, in the name of
[1:50:16] Jesus Christ, you're exposed. Come out
[1:50:18] of the woman, leave her. Go rejoicing,
[1:50:20] sister. You're free now. See, that's the
[1:50:23] thing. Say you you you need a starting
[1:50:25] place this morning.
[1:50:28] Maybe you need another way mark, another
[1:50:31] starting place, another another monument
[1:50:33] to say, man, just once again, God
[1:50:36] blessed me at that moment. Brother Bam
[1:50:38] says it like this. This is your starting
[1:50:40] place right here. I love it. You know,
[1:50:42] sometime you actually need a physical
[1:50:44] place and a and a and a and an actual
[1:50:47] time.
[1:50:49] May this be your starting place. May
[1:50:52] where you're sitting be the actual
[1:50:54] place. May 1210 be the actual time that
[1:50:59] can be your starting place.
[1:51:01] You ought to take that personally.
[1:51:04] If you don't take this message
[1:51:06] personally,
[1:51:07] you have no hope.
[1:51:09] You must take the message personally
[1:51:12] because it's Christ revealed. Brother M
[1:51:14] says this and Christ is the mystery.
[1:51:16] It's Christ revealed personally
[1:51:19] to you. It's not Christ revealed to the
[1:51:22] pastor or the brother Donald or any of
[1:51:24] these brothers. It is. But that's not
[1:51:27] enough for you. It has to be Christ
[1:51:28] revealed personally to you personally.
[1:51:32] Take that personally. And don't leave
[1:51:34] until you've taken it personally. Christ
[1:51:38] revealed to you. Let's stand to our feet
[1:51:39] this morning. Let's just worship him a
[1:51:41] moment and and and and just, you know,
[1:51:44] you don't have to come forward to the
[1:51:45] altar. Let your place be your place. Let
[1:51:48] this moment be your moment.
[1:51:50] Take God now. Say, if you don't know him
[1:51:53] personally, know him personally right
[1:51:55] now. Take him personally. You know, in
[1:51:58] Noah's day, Brother Bam says, I I have
[1:52:00] the quote, but we didn't have time. He
[1:52:01] says in Noah's day that those eight had
[1:52:03] to take Noah's message personally to to
[1:52:06] do what? To do per to personally take a
[1:52:09] a footstep on that ark.
[1:52:12] They had to actually be personal to him.
[1:52:15] Well, you must do the same thing this
[1:52:17] morning. Take it personally, saints.
[1:52:20] Receive him personally into your heart.
[1:52:24] Believe him personally. You take him
[1:52:26] personally. Then you can overcome.
[1:52:28] Praise the Lord. What are we playing?
[1:52:30] Falling in love
[1:52:33] with Jesus.
[1:52:40] Falling in love
[1:52:42] with Jesus.
[1:52:49] Falling in love
[1:52:51] with Jesus.
[1:52:57] Yeah.
[1:53:03] Heat.
[1:53:13] Yeah.
[1:53:15] Heat.
[1:53:25] Oh,
[1:53:31] heat, heat.
[1:53:41] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:53:51] Yeah.
[1:53:54] Heat.
[1:54:16] Oh Jesus
[1:54:19] be
[1:54:21] the Lord
[1:54:24] to
[1:54:26] Jesus
[1:54:28] be
[1:54:30] the Lord. Oh
[1:54:34] Jesus.
[1:54:42] Oh Jesus.
[1:54:54] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:55:08] Jesus
[1:55:16] the king
[1:55:23] was right for one.
[1:55:26] road you walk
[1:55:29] tired of boring.
[1:55:31] So Lord,
[1:55:33] worship him.
[1:55:36] He's worthy to be worshiped. Your praise
[1:55:38] is why we even came here.
[1:55:47] See, there is a source. There is a soul
[1:55:53] Heat. Heat.
[1:56:03] Yeah.
[1:56:08] Heat.
[1:56:18] Yeah. Heat.
[1:56:29] Oh,
[1:56:43] heat, heat.
[1:56:54] Heat. Heat.
[1:57:04] Yeah. Heat.
[1:57:16] Yeah.
[1:57:18] Heat.
[1:57:28] Heat. Heat.
[1:57:52] Amen. Let's just all bow our heads.
[1:58:00] Father, thank you.
[1:58:05] Thank you for a
[1:58:07] living word.
[1:58:11] that can pull up
[1:58:14] dirty,
[1:58:16] rusty
[1:58:20] nail
[1:58:22] out of a rotten board.
[1:58:26] Just with a little
[1:58:30] soft touch from the word
[1:58:36] can make that
[1:58:38] nail
[1:58:40] usable again.
[1:58:44] Once it's clean, Lord,
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; nobody ever even knows it was dirty,
[1:58:50] rusty,
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; laying out in a
[1:58:56] ugly place.
[1:58:59] And see, that's personal, Lord. Yes,
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; we're all
[1:59:06] just rusty, dirty nails.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Father, the thing about a nail,
[1:59:16] you never want to step on one
[1:59:19] cuz it hurts. Lord,
[1:59:24] makes you bleed.
[1:59:26] Got to run and get a tetanus shot cuz
[1:59:28] it's dirty.
[1:59:32] But yet, Father, once that nail is put
[1:59:34] in its proper place, what does it do?
[1:59:38] It holds.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; That's why you had to be nailed
[1:59:44] to the cross, Lord.
[1:59:47] My I don't even know where that all
[1:59:49] comes from, Father. It comes from you. I
[1:59:53] ask you now to take these words and
[1:59:57] I pray you start with me.
[2:00:01] Let me take it personal. Lord,
[2:00:06] come down and clean this old dirty rusty
[2:00:09] nail.
[2:00:13] May you just pound it into that anchor
[2:00:16] that holds.
[2:00:19] Cuz I do have that anchor.
[2:00:22] Hallelujah.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; And I can't tug on it, Lord.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's not my nail holding.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; It's the nails that held you to the
[2:00:33] cross that's broken. Bless us now, I
[2:00:36] pray. Give us strength.
[2:00:40] I like that word mature. Lord, I think
[2:00:42] we're at a time where we need to be
[2:00:45] matured.
[2:00:47] Thank you for this day. Thank you for my
[2:00:50] little granddaughter,
[2:00:52] Emry.
[2:00:53] Emry Shay is
[2:00:57] They're all special,
[2:00:59] but I see a little glow when she smiles
[2:01:02] at me for she's the baby. Lord, thank
[2:01:06] you now. Bless each and everyone that
[2:01:08] gathered in. We love you and appreciate
[2:01:11] you in Jesus precious name. Amen.
[2:01:23] Amen.
[2:01:26] Brother Ryan, as I listened to the
[2:01:29] anchor holds, I thought that's that's
[2:01:33] exactly where I stand.
[2:01:36] No matter what my life looks like at
[2:01:38] times, the anchor holds.
[2:01:42] If you don't know have the anchor, don't
[2:01:45] leave till you have it anchored. And
[2:01:46] then when it's anchored, as brother
[2:01:48] Steve says,
[2:01:51] come wind, waves, whatever else it may
[2:01:53] be and holds. Amen. We love you. Greet
[2:01:57] the one next to you and you may be se
[2:01:59] you may be uh dismissed as we sing this
[2:02:02] song.
[2:02:04] The anchor
