[20:51] Oh
[20:57] sh [singing]
[20:58] [music]
[21:03] [music]
[21:13] [music]
[21:19] and Lord bless you this morning.
[21:21] uh welcome you to the house of the Lord
[21:24] this Sunday morning. Pleasure to be here
[21:26] with you all. I see a young lady in the
[21:28] back there. Good to have you with us.
[21:30] They wrote your name down, but I I
[21:32] didn't want to venture. Do you want to
[21:34] tell us? I didn't want to venture at
[21:35] pronouncing it.
[21:39] Okay. Praise the Lord. Nice to have you
[21:41] with us. Um, we announced a week or so
[21:44] ago that we were going to have a a vote
[21:47] on whether to [music] send the funds
[21:49] that we currently have to Zimbabwe for
[21:53] this use of a vehicle that sister Louisa
[21:57] and her brother Jonathan would be using
[22:00] to conduct a medical missionary work
[22:03] that they do there. So, we're going to
[22:05] do that at this time. Um, we had also
[22:08] put the Zoom recording of the trip
[22:12] report we did with them in December and
[22:15] they talked about uh what they what the
[22:18] need was. And so hopefully you're
[22:20] educated to to we're going to do the
[22:22] vote at this time. I'll have brother Tom
[22:24] and brother Chase help us out. If it's
[22:26] okay and not to be different or
[22:28] anything, we might just have us bow our
[22:30] heads and I'll have brother Chase and
[22:32] brother Tom. We'll just do a hand vote
[22:34] at this time. I have brother Chase and
[22:36] brother Tom count the votes on either
[22:38] side of the congregation. So if you
[22:41] would bow your heads at this time and if
[22:42] you're if you would be in favor of the
[22:47] sending these funds and for the use
[22:50] might be for a vehicle that's what we
[22:52] intend but there might be another use
[22:54] that would come up. So, if you would be
[22:56] in favor of sending those funds, would
[22:58] you raise your hand? Just one hand.
[23:00] Raise your hand at this time. And I'll
[23:02] have just hold them up there just for
[23:03] about 10 or 15 seconds while the
[23:05] brothers would count them.
[23:17] Okay, you may put those down. And if you
[23:19] would not be in favor, if you don't
[23:20] think it's a appropriate use of our
[23:23] missions funds, would you raise your
[23:25] hand at this [music] time with your
[23:26] heads being bowed?
[23:33] Okay, that's you may raise your put your
[23:35] hands down and [music] raise your heads
[23:37] and your hearts, brothers. Um I think we
[23:41] can say conclusively that um the body
[23:45] has determined that that would be a good
[23:47] use of the funds and so we'll be sending
[23:49] those to Zimbabwe and
[23:52] Lord willing they'll purchase a vehicle
[23:53] but you know if they want to we we'll
[23:55] just guide with the trustees along that
[23:57] and I think it's from my perspective I'm
[24:00] glad the congregation would vote the way
[24:02] they did from my perspective it's one of
[24:05] the greatest mission works that I've
[24:08] seen done in this foot doctor goes and
[24:11] you know treats the children's feet and
[24:13] they buy him shoes and so it's an
[24:14] amazing work. Um maybe we'll just sing
[24:18] that song again. Brother Ryan, let's
[24:20] start with verse two there and Sister
[24:22] Pauline, we'll sing that as we enter
[24:23] back into the spirit. I felt the Lord
[24:25] was pleased with that song. Start with
[24:28] verse two. I'm looking now across the
[24:30] river.
[24:32] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[24:35] [music]
[24:42] [music] Heat.
[24:47] Heat. [singing]
[24:49] [music]
[24:56] [music]
[24:57] Heat. Heat.
[25:02] [music and singing]
[25:08] [music]
[25:10] Hey,
[25:16] [music]
[25:21] [music]
[25:30] [music]
[25:37] [music]
[25:39] I [singing]
[25:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[25:42] &gt;&gt; for
[25:44] you.
[25:48] And someday
[25:50] [singing]
[25:51] [music]
[25:54] [singing]
[25:56] I'll [music] say
[26:02] there [singing and music]
[26:09] I'll [music and singing] meet
[26:12] her
[26:14] [music]
[26:20] [music]
[26:24] sweet.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. For prayer requests this morning,
[26:31] Sister Rose wrote in [music] for Mark
[26:33] Baila, her brother. He's going to get a
[26:36] surgery redone on Thursday. It's complex
[26:38] [music] and it needs to be redone. And
[26:40] we pray that all would go well with
[26:43] Sister Rose's [music] brother Mark and
[26:45] also her 9-year-old niece Giovana in
[26:48] Mexico is getting a major mouth repair
[26:50] surgery. She was born with a deformity
[26:52] in her mouth. It's also complicated and
[26:55] very painful. We pray that she gets
[26:57] through with this [music]
[26:59] min with min minimal pain. She asked
[27:03] that we [music] would pray for her. How
[27:06] about that? a little nine-year-old girl
[27:07] would have enough faith to ask that we
[27:09] would pray for her. So, let's go before
[27:11] the Lord in prayer this morning as we
[27:13] bow our heads. And with your head bowed,
[27:16] you may also lift a hand if you have a
[27:17] need. I'm not even looking, but we know
[27:20] the Lord looks and knows who has [music]
[27:22] needs and what that need is this
[27:25] morning. Heavenly Father, we approach
[27:26] you this morning,
[27:29] Lord. And in our hearts there's needs
[27:33] with the lifted hand we confess and make
[27:35] known those needs, Lord. And we come
[27:38] before you this morning. We approach you
[27:40] this morning, not even knowing the
[27:42] correct way to approach you or how to do
[27:44] it exactly. So we just come humbly
[27:46] asking for your help, Lord. And we read
[27:50] these requests for Sister Rose, her
[27:52] brother, and her niece, Lord. And it
[27:54] thrilled my heart to read that the niece
[27:56] would ask for prayer. And that's a
[27:59] measure of faith right there, Lord. And
[28:00] it's a something we all should have with
[28:03] a childlike faith, Lord. She must have
[28:05] asked because she thought and believed
[28:09] that it works, Lord, that you answer
[28:12] prayer. And we believe that this
[28:14] morning, Lord, that you're a God who
[28:15] answers prayer. And we know there's
[28:17] [music] many needs in our body. No doubt
[28:18] many hands were lifted up. We present
[28:21] these needs before you, Lord. And I ask
[28:23] for myself for this morning, Lord, as we
[28:25] have a service of questions and answers,
[28:28] Lord. There is no question that we can
[28:31] answer
[28:32] appropriately and sufficiently, Lord.
[28:35] And so, we're relying on you this
[28:36] morning to completely just reveal
[28:39] yourself more to us this morning, Lord.
[28:41] not just answer our questions, but would
[28:44] you just unfold yourself, Father, just
[28:46] once more and reveal yourself to us and
[28:50] explain who you are to us once again,
[28:52] Lord. And let us feel your presence as
[28:54] the word and the songs, Lord. We go
[28:57] forth. May we feel that you're with us
[28:59] and present among us once again, Lord.
[29:02] For every request that's made known,
[29:03] we'd ask that you'd meet the need,
[29:05] Father, according to the faith, Lord.
[29:07] And may our faith raise high [music]
[29:08] this morning and be elevated to a level,
[29:11] Lord. That as the song would say, one
[29:13] day our faith is going to end. It's
[29:17] going to be fulfilled. It's going to be
[29:19] finished in sight and in not just a
[29:22] sight, Lord, but we're going to
[29:23] experience an experience like we've
[29:26] never felt before. We believe that,
[29:28] Lord. And that's our faith. We're
[29:30] holding on to that this morning. Would
[29:31] you bring us once again into heavenly
[29:34] places this morning in Christ Jesus? we
[29:36] pray be [music] with us for we ask all
[29:39] these things in the name of the Lord
[29:41] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Lord
[29:44] bless you. Brother Donald,
[29:47] greet [music] the one next to you. You
[29:48] may be seated.
[29:53] Brother Ryan,
[29:56] I love the way that the Holy Spirit led
[29:58] you. Every need supplied. Amen.
[30:05] Will is this a request? [music]
[30:09] Okay.
[30:18] [music]
[30:24] Every
[30:26] [singing]
[30:27] [music] knee
[30:30] Heat.
[30:34] [music]

[30:39] [music]
[30:45] [music]
[30:45] Heat. Heat. [singing]
[30:49] [music]
[30:56] Heat.
[30:58] Heat. [music and singing]
[31:06] [singing and music]
[31:08] Oh,
[31:14] so
[31:16] [music]
[31:31] [music] there [singing]
[31:38] We need
[31:40] inside.
[31:44] [music]
[31:53] Amen. Amen. Lord bless y'all. Brother
[31:56] Ryan, um
[32:00] the song Lord, you know I need a brand
[32:02] new touch.
[32:05] Lord, you know I need a brand new touch.
[32:09] All right, then that's all right.
[32:11] Doesn't stop the fact.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know
[32:16] &gt;&gt; I need a brand new touch.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Jehovah Gyra, my provider.
[32:22] Amen. Amen. You know, I was telling
[32:24] brother Steve there's
[32:29] how the Lord works on me may be
[32:31] different than you and I know that it
[32:33] is, but he's he just brings me very
[32:36] close and brings me little reminders. I
[32:39] sat and listened to um Sister Marcy and
[32:44] Sister Kathy singing and that song
[32:47] [music] was special to them. It may not
[32:49] be to other people, but because they
[32:52] could, it was it was who they were. It
[32:54] was how God spoke to them at a moment in
[32:56] time. And and and it means something
[32:58] special to them. And
[33:07] Jehovah, my provider. I heard the
[33:09] prophet say, and and [music] so I'm
[33:12] using his words because I want them to
[33:14] be my words also. He said, "I would give
[33:18] my very life
[33:20] for anyone that loved my Lord Jesus."
[33:26] So this entering in of one another, if
[33:30] you see the person next to you, you said
[33:33] know without a shout of doubt that they
[33:35] love the same Lord Jesus you do, then
[33:39] you're willing to give your life for
[33:40] him. Jehovah Gyra. And most of the time
[33:44] I can't. I may not physically but but I
[33:47] want you to know it. So I enter into
[33:48] songs and I want you to know that I
[33:52] would do anything I can. Sister Rose,
[33:54] this little girl.
[33:57] She her Lord is my Lord. I would give my
[34:00] life for her. I can't give my life, but
[34:02] I will enter into prayer. I will bring
[34:04] it before brother Gerald, sister
[34:07] Alberta, just because we haven't heard
[34:09] about it in a while. She loves the Lord
[34:11] Jesus. So I want to give my life to her.
[34:13] I want to just bring my spirit. So per
[34:16] chance the Lord would be pleased. Per
[34:19] chance you would bring about a healing.
[34:23] And that's very true. So amen. I want to
[34:26] be mindful of his presence. Jehovah
[34:29] Mjara my provider. Amen.
[34:35] Jehovah.
[34:37] [music]
[34:42] My pro.
[34:46] [singing]
[34:50] You are [music]
[34:55] enough
[34:57] for [music]
[34:58] me.
[35:03] [music] You're the [singing] rock.
[35:09] [music]
[35:11] You're mighty.
[35:19] By your stripes
[35:23] we have been
[35:26] save. [music]
[35:33] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music]
[35:38] [music]
[35:41] [singing]
[35:43] Yeah.
[35:48] Heat.
[35:56] [music]
[36:02] You are [music]
[36:07] enough.
[36:10] [music]
[36:17] [music]
[36:21] enough
[36:24] for me. [music]
[36:30] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[36:35] Born again, there's really been a change
[36:37] in me. Amen. Amen. And that's the
[36:40] beautiful thing that you know I you look
[36:43] out and I sitting at dinner. Brother
[36:46] John and sister Liz so graciously
[36:48] invited us to dinner and the other night
[36:51] and
[36:53] I sitting out and talking to him and we
[36:55] were talking. I said, "You don't know
[36:56] how a a privilege it is and to [music]
[37:00] be able to stand out here and see each
[37:02] one of your faces. All you get to do is
[37:04] see my face." Sometimes I'm sad for
[37:07] that, Suzanne,
[37:09] because there's more. Because if as I
[37:11] look out here, it just turns my heart. I
[37:14] don't know any way to else express it.
[37:17] And I wish I could tell you back because
[37:19] [music] I see Christ alive in each one.
[37:23] Big, little, all different ages.
[37:28] And it's all because of this. Born
[37:31] again,
[37:32] filled with the Holy Ghost. [music]
[37:34] There's really been a change in me.
[37:37] Amen. Born again just like I'm Jesus.
[37:42] I'm sorry, brother Ryan. I did it wrong.
[37:44] Oh, born again. There's really
[37:48] [music and singing] been a change in me.
[37:52] Oh, born [music] again just like Jesus.
[37:59] Heat.

[39:05] I'm glad so [music] glad that I've been
[39:08] [singing] born again.
[39:12] I know that there's verses to that song
[39:15] and we don't have them. We don't have
[39:17] them on our little thing, but Sister
[39:19] Pauline, in your spare time,
[39:22] and I say that with great respect
[39:24] because you put so much time into it. I
[39:27] will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[39:28] forever. Amen. And our brothers will
[39:31] come. We'll sing this little chorus. I
[39:33] will sing of the mercies of the Lord.
[39:35] How many received his mercy this week?
[39:38] Amen. What a beautiful thing. So, we
[39:41] should be able to just let him know and
[39:44] he should be so pleased. And he says,
[39:46] "That's my children. That's that's the
[39:48] ones that I love doing things for. I
[39:50] will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[39:52] forever." Amen. Oh,
[39:59] I will sing [music] of the mercies of
[40:02] the Lord [singing]
[40:04] forever.
[40:08] Oh, I will sing.
[40:12] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music and singing]

[48:53] Amen. My heart's just bubbling. You
[48:56] know, the prophet says, and brother
[48:57] Ryan, what else is just the Holy Spirit
[48:59] leading you on the song? He says, you
[49:01] know, sometimes you get just enough
[49:03] religion to get happy with the songs and
[49:05] run around a little bit and then sit
[49:07] down and talk about your neighbor. I've
[49:09] got more than that. I've got a happiness
[49:12] on the inside of you myself that I wish
[49:14] I could express. I'm not going to be
[49:16] able to express in this flesh. But one
[49:18] of these days when we're all in heaven,
[49:20] brother Donald, you and I are going to
[49:22] be dancing around. I believe that. I
[49:25] don't These feet can't move here and I
[49:28] won't care what they move like over
[49:29] there. I'll just be happy that I'm here.

[52:13] Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. We have a few
[52:17] songs. I just apologize for the
[52:20] weakness. My flesh, it gets in the way
[52:23] so much. And really what I like to be
[52:25] doing is just running up and down here.
[52:27] When I think of my Lord and Savior, I
[52:30] just But I just think, "Oh,
[52:34] &gt;&gt; there's a stupid camera that's watching
[52:36] every move that I make." And I would
[52:38] might get embarrassed on this thing,
[52:40] God. One of these days, I'm going to
[52:42] just I'm going to just I'm just telling
[52:45] you. Amen. Amen.
[52:48] Hallelujah.
[52:51] Oh my. Brother Will,
[52:53] would you have your special
[52:57] &gt;&gt; know my savior? If you don't know him,
[53:01] don't take another minute
[53:04] &gt;&gt; without just staying and saying, "Lord,
[53:08] &gt;&gt; would you just make yourself known to
[53:10] me?" That's all you take that first. He
[53:13] He paid for it all. That's not a
[53:15] question. He just wants you to come out
[53:17] and accept it.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Love the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[53:23] Glory to his name.
[53:46] You gave me my hands
[53:50] to reach out to man
[53:54] to show him your love
[53:59] and your perfect plan.
[54:03] You gave [singing] me my ears.
[54:07] I can hear your voice so clear.
[54:11] I can hear the cries of sinners.
[54:16] But can I wipe away their tears.
[54:23] You gave me my voice
[54:27] [music] to speak out your word.
[54:31] to sing all your praises
[54:35] to those who never heard.
[54:39] But with my eyes, I see a need
[54:43] for more availability.
[54:48] I see hearts that have been broken,
[54:52] so many people to be free.
[54:59] Lord,
[55:01] I'm available
[55:03] to you.
[55:08] My will I give to you. I'll do what you
[55:14] say to use me, Lord,
[55:18] to show someone the way.
[55:23] Enable [singing and music] me to say
[55:28] my storage
[55:31] is empty
[55:33] and I am available
[55:37] to you.
[55:41] Now I'm giving [music]
[55:43] back to you
[55:45] all the tools you gave to me.
[55:50] my hands, my ears, my voice, my eyes, so
[55:54] you can use them as you please.
[55:58] I have emptied out my cup
[56:02] so that you can fill me up
[56:07] and now I'm free. I just want to be more
[56:11] available
[56:13] to you,
[56:18] Lord.
[56:19] I'm available
[56:21] to you.
[56:26] My will I give to you. I'll do what you
[56:32] [music] say [singing] to use me, Lord,
[56:36] to show someone the way
[56:40] and enable me to say.
[56:46] [singing] My storage
[56:49] is empty
[56:51] and I am available
[56:55] [music and singing] to you,
[57:00] Lord.
[57:01] I'm available
[57:03] to you.
[57:08] My will I give [music and singing] to
[57:11] you. I'll do what you say to use me,
[57:16] Lord,
[57:18] to show someone the way
[57:22] and [music] enable me to say
[57:28] my storage is empty [singing and music]
[57:33] and I am available. Use me Lord
[57:37] [singing]
[57:39] to show someone the way
[57:43] and [music] enable me to say
[57:49] my storage
[57:51] is empty
[57:53] and I am available [singing]
[57:57] to you.
[58:02] My sore edge is empty
[58:06] and I [singing] am available.
[58:12] That's why I
[58:15] surrender
[58:17] all. [singing]
[58:21] Oh, I
[58:23] surrender
[58:26] all.
[58:30] All
[58:32] to thee, my blessed
[58:37] Savior,
[58:39] I
[58:41] surrender.
[58:44] Oh,
[58:48] Amen. Amen. [applause]
[58:53] Wonderful. Truly, I surrender. Oh,
[58:55] brother Tom, if you'd make ready at this
[58:58] time. I apologize. As I was checked, I
[59:00] shouldn't have said stupid. That was the
[59:03] wrong thing to say. I'm sorry. If that
[59:05] isn't Pentecostal cussing, I don't know
[59:08] what it is. Besides that, my
[59:10] grandchildren would tell me, "Peppa,
[59:12] you're not supposed to say that word."
[59:14] So, I'm sorry, but it just these little
[59:18] things just told me down.
[59:21] That's what it I just use different
[59:23] terms.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you.
[59:45] If I may, if you were here Wednesday,
[59:47] you never want to give the enemy a
[59:49] chance to get his foot in the door.
[59:53] Brother William very nicely
[59:55] asked Brother Tom to get ready for a
[59:58] song. Asked if I had a song. Brother Tom
[1:00:02] did not hear him. I didn't ignore
[1:00:05] Brother Will. I just didn't hear it. And
[1:00:09] I felt terrible. I mean, for a singer,
[1:00:13] you look for those chances, Brother
[1:00:15] Kurt. You know, you look to get called
[1:00:18] into the game and then to miss hearing
[1:00:21] the coach's call is terrible.
[1:00:26] And I was thinking, Brother William,
[1:00:27] with your song there, so [music] that
[1:00:29] was a song from a young man's heart. And
[1:00:31] we could all sing that.
[1:00:34] But if I could say
[1:00:36] this is a
[1:00:39] not an old man, but a elder man's
[1:00:43] answer.
[1:00:45] If you have not [music] great talents or
[1:00:48] gifts to bring, if you have not been
[1:00:52] blessed with a voice to sing, still you
[1:00:56] [music] long to serve Jesus your Lord
[1:01:00] [singing] and King. Do what you can
[1:01:04] where you are.
[1:01:06] Oh, do what you can where you are.
[1:01:12] There's a job to be done where you are.
[1:01:17] Do the Savior [singing and music]
[1:01:18] be true in that place given you.
[1:01:22] Do what you can where [singing] you are.
[1:01:27] From an acorn grow trees that are strong
[1:01:31] and tall. So a work [singing] that is
[1:01:34] mighty and blesses all [music]
[1:01:38] of begins with a labor unnoticed [music]
[1:01:42] and small. Do what you can where you
[1:01:46] [singing] are.
[1:01:48] Oh, do what you can where you are.
[1:01:54] There's a job to be [singing] done
[1:01:56] [music] where you are.
[1:01:59] to the Savior be true [music] in that
[1:02:02] place given you. Do what you can where
[1:02:07] you are.
[1:02:09] Oh, our labors are judged not by man's
[1:02:13] acclaim.
[1:02:16] Our rewards [music]
[1:02:17] are not based on success or fame. The
[1:02:21] criterion is [music and singing]
[1:02:23] faithfulness to his name.
[1:02:27] Do what you can where you are.
[1:02:32] Oh, [singing] do what you can where you
[1:02:35] are.
[1:02:37] There's a job to be done where you are.
[1:02:42] Do the [singing and music] Savior be
[1:02:44] true in that place given you. Do [music]
[1:02:49] what you can where you are.
[1:02:53] So then do what you can for the Lord,
[1:02:57] [singing] my friend.
[1:03:00] With the help of his blessings [music]
[1:03:02] and grace, my friend, you will hear his
[1:03:07] well done at the journey's [singing]
[1:03:09] [music] end. Do what you can where you
[1:03:14] are.
[1:03:16] Oh, do [music] what you can where you
[1:03:19] are.
[1:03:21] There's a job to be done where you are
[1:03:26] to the [singing and music] Savior be
[1:03:28] true in that place given you. Do what
[1:03:33] you can where you are.
[1:03:36] [music and singing] Oh, do what you can
[1:03:39] where you are.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We can stand.
[1:03:51] We changed the order of the service.
[1:03:53] Amazing grace.
[1:03:55] Brother Tom, I know you can't see this.
[1:03:57] See how the Lord, he does little things,
[1:04:00] raises my faith.
[1:04:03] That song was the first one on my list.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And if you all were a percentage guy,
[1:04:11] Brother Donald could tell you
[1:04:12] percentages. the percentages of that
[1:04:15] happening without some somebody greater
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; being in control. [snorts]
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; So my [music] faith is right here,
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; right about now.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Anything's possible. Ask
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; it.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
[1:04:32] How blessed is my Lord and Savior.
[1:04:34] Praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:36] [music] Christ. Amen.
[1:04:41] Amazing
[1:04:44] grace.
[1:04:46] How sweet [music]
[1:04:49] a
[1:04:53] save
[1:04:55] a [singing]
[1:04:57] [music] like me.
[1:05:04] I once
[1:05:06] was [singing]
[1:05:07] lost
[1:05:10] but now
[1:05:12] I found
[1:05:15] was
[1:05:18] [music] now
[1:05:21] I see
[1:05:26] was Grace
[1:05:29] that has taught
[1:05:32] my heart
[1:05:35] to
[1:05:38] his grace. [music and singing]
[1:05:40] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:05:47] [music]
[1:05:55] grace [music]
[1:06:01] [music and singing]
[1:06:10] and with me. [music]
[1:06:17] Yeah. [music]
[1:06:20] Heat.
[1:06:23] [music]
[1:06:28] [singing]
[1:06:30] [music]
[1:06:33] We know
[1:06:38] [music]
[1:06:39] to see
[1:06:42] God
[1:06:45] and
[1:06:47] we [music] first
[1:06:54] bless you this morning. [music] If you
[1:06:55] have your Bibles, we'll turn to John,
[1:06:56] the first chapter of John.
[1:07:01] Maybe start with verse 30. Thank you to
[1:07:03] the musicians. Sounds like brother Tom
[1:07:05] was supposed to sing this morning. So
[1:07:08] there's really no mistakes
[1:07:11] with God. And brother Donald did make a
[1:07:13] mistake though. He said if I take the
[1:07:17] cameras out of here, he might loosen up
[1:07:20] a little bit. That's what I heard
[1:07:22] anyway. I don't know what you all heard,
[1:07:23] but
[1:07:26] I mean, if that's all it takes, Brother
[1:07:27] Donald, I will brew those things out of
[1:07:29] here right now and we'll get a little
[1:07:33] we'll have a little wildfire in here.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then uh we'll go to
[1:07:41] Revelations 21 after we read these few
[1:07:43] verses. Verse 30 of St. John chapter 1
[1:07:48] says, "This is he of whom I said after
[1:07:51] me cometh a man which is preferred
[1:07:53] before me, for he was before me, and I
[1:07:57] knew him not, but that he should be made
[1:07:59] manifest to Israel." Therefore, I might
[1:08:02] come baptizing with water. And John bear
[1:08:05] records, saying, "I saw the spirit
[1:08:07] descending from heaven like a dove, and
[1:08:11] it bowed upon him." And then Revelations
[1:08:14] chapter 21 and the first couple verses.
[1:08:16] And these I guess would pertain to the
[1:08:19] first question that we'll approach this
[1:08:21] morning. Revelations 21 verse one. So
[1:08:24] saw John saw the spirit descending.
[1:08:29] And then verse one says, "And I saw a
[1:08:32] new heaven and a new earth for the first
[1:08:33] heaven and the first earth were passed
[1:08:35] away and there was no more sea. And I,
[1:08:39] John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem,
[1:08:42] coming down from God out of heaven,
[1:08:44] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:08:47] husband. And I heard a great voice out
[1:08:49] of heaven, saying, "Behold, the
[1:08:50] tabernacle of God is with men, and he
[1:08:53] will dwell with them, and they shall be
[1:08:55] his people, and God himself shall be
[1:08:58] with them, and be their God." Let's bow
[1:09:01] our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:09:02] approach you this morning with humility
[1:09:05] and with thankfulness. We appreciate you
[1:09:09] already manifesting yourself this
[1:09:12] morning, Lord, and making yourself known
[1:09:14] in your presence here with us. And even
[1:09:16] in the little mention of that song,
[1:09:18] Lord, and just like our brother said,
[1:09:20] just gives us a little boost. We know
[1:09:23] you're with us. We know you're here. And
[1:09:26] we thank you that just once in a while,
[1:09:28] Lord, you encourage us in the way. And
[1:09:30] we appreciate that. And we acknowledge
[1:09:33] that this morning. We ask you to be with
[1:09:34] us in these questions and answers that
[1:09:37] we would have this morning, Lord. And
[1:09:39] may you be the answer we're all looking
[1:09:41] for. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. You
[1:09:43] can be seated.
[1:09:46] Yeah. There's a quote I read a few weeks
[1:09:48] ago
[1:09:50] and I think brother Brandham says
[1:09:52] something like this. You know, if I just
[1:09:54] could feel him once in a while, let him
[1:09:57] know. Let let me know that he's there,
[1:10:00] that would keep me going. And I really
[1:10:02] like that quote because if the prophet
[1:10:03] of God had that thought and that desire,
[1:10:06] just I want to feel him once in a while.
[1:10:08] I kind of the same way, you know, man,
[1:10:10] Lord, thank you. I if I just could feel
[1:10:12] you once in a while. And we had a lot of
[1:10:15] questions come in, more than the last
[1:10:16] time, a lot more. And maybe 12 to 15,
[1:10:20] somewhere in that range. And some of
[1:10:22] them were linked and so we kind of
[1:10:24] combined them. And so it's going to take
[1:10:25] a few services and even don't feel bad
[1:10:28] if you don't get the answer because a
[1:10:30] lot of these well I I've had comfort
[1:10:33] this morning. They asked Jesus when when
[1:10:34] when is the Lord coming? What's the day?
[1:10:36] And he said something like this. I don't
[1:10:38] know. Only the father in heaven knows.
[1:10:40] So if Jesus could say I don't know. I
[1:10:43] have no trouble saying I don't know. You
[1:10:45] know that was a good example for us. And
[1:10:48] um and then I like what brother Isaac
[1:10:50] said last week. He said something like
[1:10:51] this. If there's an answer or say if I
[1:10:54] say something that's wrong or you think
[1:10:57] is wrong and you find it in the message
[1:10:58] different or you find it in scriptures,
[1:11:00] I'll say it like this. If you find in
[1:11:01] the Bible or the message different, I'm
[1:11:04] wrong and the Bible and the message are
[1:11:05] right. And that'll just be we could we
[1:11:08] could just get that out of the way up
[1:11:10] front. And um I was studying while the
[1:11:13] questions and answers a few years ago we
[1:11:14] did a questions and answers where there
[1:11:16] was no questions but we just went
[1:11:17] through the questions that were asked of
[1:11:19] Jesus and the questions he asked which
[1:11:21] he actually asked a lot more than were
[1:11:23] asked of him. And that's you that's kind
[1:11:26] of interesting that God on earth the
[1:11:28] manifestation of God on earth would ask
[1:11:30] more questions of us than we would ask
[1:11:33] of him. So the disciples or the scribes
[1:11:35] or whoever it was that asked him
[1:11:37] questions asked him like 180 questions
[1:11:39] and he asked 300 questions and the and
[1:11:43] the Bible records that he didn't give
[1:11:46] you know the the 180 questions that he
[1:11:49] was asked he didn't give 180 answers.
[1:11:51] Sometimes he wouldn't answer at all or
[1:11:53] he would answer with a question. They
[1:11:55] would say something like what by what
[1:11:57] authority are you doing these things?
[1:11:59] Who gives you this authority? and we
[1:12:01] throw that word around, but it's like,
[1:12:03] "But how can you do these things? What
[1:12:04] power do you have? Or what, you know,
[1:12:06] who do you come? They're they're under
[1:12:08] Roman rule or whatever." So they look at
[1:12:09] maybe authority like that and and so
[1:12:11] they ask him, "By what authority?" And
[1:12:13] he says, "Well, by what authority did
[1:12:15] John do these things?" And they go back
[1:12:17] and see, they're trying to accuse him
[1:12:19] and get him caught in a trap, but you're
[1:12:21] not going to catch God in a trap with
[1:12:23] questions. There's no way. And so
[1:12:25] sometimes he would he would answer a
[1:12:27] question with another question. And and
[1:12:30] other times he would answer it with a
[1:12:32] parable. They would ask a question like
[1:12:34] this. Who's my neighbor?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Who who's my neighbor? And he would say
[1:12:38] something like, "There was a guy one
[1:12:41] time and he was going from Jerusalem
[1:12:42] down to Jericho." And then, you know, he
[1:12:45] got beat up by some robbers and then a
[1:12:48] priest came by and a Levite came by and
[1:12:49] a Samaritan came by. Then he goes
[1:12:51] through the story and in the parable he
[1:12:54] answers the question, but he doesn't
[1:12:56] just say, "Oh, the neighbor's a guy that
[1:12:58] treats the other guy better." But he's
[1:13:00] giving an entire picture of everything
[1:13:01] because he really wants to paint it well
[1:13:04] for you and put it in a way that you can
[1:13:06] understand greater. Not just, you know,
[1:13:08] a yes or no question, but he can he can
[1:13:11] really get down into your heart to
[1:13:13] figure out. See, that's the key because
[1:13:15] he wants to in the questions that were
[1:13:17] asked. The reason he didn't just just
[1:13:19] answer the questions, he went back and
[1:13:21] and asked a question or he told a
[1:13:23] parable or sometimes he did an action.
[1:13:25] Hey, we've caught this woman in adultery
[1:13:28] and you know the law says this and and
[1:13:30] he wouldn't do any say anything. He just
[1:13:32] took his finger and and he did an
[1:13:34] action. Or when the disciples were on
[1:13:36] the sea, they they asked him a question,
[1:13:39] do you even care that we perish?
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And so what did he do? He just calmed
[1:13:44] the storm. Well, in that action, he
[1:13:46] showed something that was greater than
[1:13:49] answering the question, yes, I care if
[1:13:50] you perish. No, he did. He accomplished
[1:13:53] the answer to the question. And in that
[1:13:55] qu, see, he wants to expose what's
[1:13:58] inside of us. So, if you ask God a
[1:14:00] question, see, brother Bham said, when
[1:14:01] you when I do the questions and answer
[1:14:03] services, I I gets to see what's in the
[1:14:05] hearts of the people. Well, God God also
[1:14:08] wants to expose. So he knows but maybe
[1:14:10] he wants you to know like what the
[1:14:11] motivation of the question is and
[1:14:14] where's the where's the where's the
[1:14:15] what's the heart of the issue that's
[1:14:17] what God and then he can expose what's
[1:14:19] in your heart and then he can show you
[1:14:22] you know if there's something missing
[1:14:23] there that that here's what you need in
[1:14:25] your heart now he did answer a couple
[1:14:27] questions very directly I think you know
[1:14:30] some theologians say three and some say
[1:14:32] eight it comes like this though that in
[1:14:34] Matthew 24 they asked him and and only
[1:14:37] you know the bride would understand
[1:14:38] this, but but in Matthew 24, they asked
[1:14:40] him what what what were they what they
[1:14:42] were basically were saying was what are
[1:14:44] the seven seals? I'm going to word it
[1:14:46] like that and if you study the seven
[1:14:47] seals, you'll you'll understand. But
[1:14:49] they basically asked him, you know,
[1:14:50] what's the sign of them? And when will
[1:14:52] these things happen? And he begins in
[1:14:54] Matthew 24 in the first few verses, he
[1:14:57] actually begins to open the seven seals.
[1:14:59] Now, we know they're sealed and it's a
[1:15:01] seven sealed book, but we couldn't have
[1:15:03] them today if Christ didn't begin an
[1:15:05] opening back then. So he he does answer
[1:15:08] that question. And then there's another
[1:15:10] question that he answers and I think
[1:15:11] it's in Luke. I don't have it here but
[1:15:13] but it's something like this. Lord, what
[1:15:15] is the greatest commandment in the law?
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; You know, he came right directly with an
[1:15:21] answer to that question. Here's what the
[1:15:23] greatest commandment is. You should love
[1:15:25] your neighbor. You should love the Lord
[1:15:27] first of all with all your body, your
[1:15:29] soul, your heart, your mind, your
[1:15:30] strength. You better love him and love
[1:15:32] your neighbor as thyself. Now think of
[1:15:33] all the questions he was asked. 80 and
[1:15:36] who do who has this authority? Should we
[1:15:38] kill stone this woman or do you even
[1:15:40] care about us or whatever it might be?
[1:15:42] So he's asked all those questions, but
[1:15:44] the one question he asked directly is
[1:15:46] the greatest commandment is love your
[1:15:49] neighbor. Love God with all your heart
[1:15:51] and love your neighbor. So there's
[1:15:52] something in that answer
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; that's special because it's a direct
[1:15:57] answer and it's a revealing. It's
[1:15:59] actually the greatest revealing of the
[1:16:01] heart of God.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; God is love. I think John would say it
[1:16:05] like that. And so he he would answer
[1:16:07] with parables. He would answer with
[1:16:09] authority. He would answer with an
[1:16:10] action. And rarely, but with purpose, he
[1:16:14] would give, you know, a very plain
[1:16:16] answer. So Lord, help us this morning.
[1:16:18] There was so many that we're just going
[1:16:19] to go through. And by the way, I think I
[1:16:21] took the hardest ones right off the bat.
[1:16:23] So pray for me special this morning. And
[1:16:25] don't uh I'm not going to say answer
[1:16:27] them. We'll just say that we approach
[1:16:29] them. And the first question here, I uh
[1:16:31] I've been listening to the future home
[1:16:33] back in November and December is really
[1:16:35] going through it like detail. You know,
[1:16:37] sometimes you'll listen to it and go
[1:16:39] through in detail. And that's the
[1:16:40] message where Billy Paul comes out and
[1:16:44] his dad asks him, "What do you did you
[1:16:46] understand it? Did you understand what I
[1:16:47] said tonight?" And I mean, it's a 4-hour
[1:16:50] message, first of all. And we, you know,
[1:16:52] we've got about a 45minute
[1:16:54] attention span. Well, we did back then.
[1:16:57] I don't know what the young people have
[1:16:58] nowadays, but it was 45 minutes or so
[1:17:00] back then. And four hours, you can't
[1:17:03] even expect that he would grasp it all,
[1:17:04] but we're all a little prideful and we
[1:17:06] all want to. And yeah, I got it, Dad.
[1:17:08] You know, the there was a you know, the
[1:17:10] earth and then there's a new homecoming.
[1:17:11] I got it. He said, did you understand?
[1:17:13] No, I did. And about the third or fourth
[1:17:15] time, did you understand the the
[1:17:17] message, the future home? And in a maybe
[1:17:20] a sad way, he said, no, I didn't really
[1:17:22] get it. And then brother Brandham says
[1:17:24] something like this. I can count on my
[1:17:26] hand the number of people that
[1:17:28] understood.
[1:17:30] And so I went back and listened to that
[1:17:32] message in November trying to
[1:17:34] understand. I don't think God doesn't
[1:17:35] want us to understand. And and so God
[1:17:37] began to deal with me on certain things.
[1:17:39] And then this brother asked a question
[1:17:41] and I thought that's kind of already the
[1:17:44] answer. So we'll pull it up here and and
[1:17:46] we'll see where the Lord would lead us.
[1:17:47] The question is God's first Bible was in
[1:17:50] the heavens as constellation. I some of
[1:17:52] the questions you might have written it
[1:17:53] in and you might see it differently
[1:17:55] worded. It's because maybe there was a
[1:17:57] couple questions related to the same
[1:17:59] question and I would summarize them. So
[1:18:01] the heavens as constellations was God's
[1:18:04] first Bible. The heavenly constellations
[1:18:05] were written from Virgo to Leo showing
[1:18:08] the birth of Christ to his coming. The
[1:18:09] third Bible his written word which we
[1:18:12] have to study now and every verse
[1:18:14] teaches us about Christ. What does the
[1:18:16] second Bible built by Enoch as pyramids
[1:18:19] show us? Do we know first of all that
[1:18:22] God's first Bible, you know, brother
[1:18:24] Brandham goes back to the beginning on
[1:18:26] this and he talks about Elohim and he
[1:18:28] talks about God being there and we're
[1:18:30] going to read a quote here as we go
[1:18:32] forward, but but brother Brandham will
[1:18:33] will kind of put a drama together. You
[1:18:35] know, you can almost close your eyes and
[1:18:37] you try we can try to picture it
[1:18:39] happening. It it happens almost before
[1:18:41] time and it happens as as something
[1:18:44] we'll never really until we get there be
[1:18:46] able to fully understand how it
[1:18:47] happened. But in our, you know, the
[1:18:49] brains that we can think with now, he
[1:18:51] begins to dramatize it for us. And he
[1:18:54] said in there, now see this is just like
[1:18:56] a child playing before the door. It was
[1:18:58] the son of God, the logos. And I can see
[1:19:01] him out there. And he spake and said,
[1:19:02] "Let there be light." And there was
[1:19:04] nothing but there was something
[1:19:05] happening. And Adam turned there and
[1:19:07] began to whirl around this way. The sun
[1:19:09] begin to come into existence because he
[1:19:11] said, "Let there be." There's the
[1:19:13] authority. Where did he make it from? I
[1:19:16] don't know. There was nothing to make it
[1:19:17] from, but he believed his own word.
[1:19:20] That's one of my favorite quotes I've
[1:19:21] ever read. God believed his own word and
[1:19:24] there was light. And I can see a piece
[1:19:26] fly off of that. It's a meteor after a
[1:19:28] few million years or hundred billions of
[1:19:31] years if you want to call it. And it
[1:19:33] circled way out and I see him standing
[1:19:34] there watching it. It falls down in here
[1:19:36] and he stops it after it falls a few
[1:19:39] million years and let it hang there in
[1:19:40] orbit. Here goes another one flying off
[1:19:42] the sun. It goes over here and hangs
[1:19:44] down and stops there. What's he doing?
[1:19:46] He's see he's writing his first Bible.
[1:19:49] It's he's writing. And what is his first
[1:19:51] Bible? He's expressing himself.
[1:19:53] Actually, now we could say a Bible is
[1:19:56] God. And we do believe this that this is
[1:19:57] the revelation of Jesus Christ. And we
[1:19:59] know the quote every verse in here. You
[1:20:01] know, if you don't see the Lord in it,
[1:20:03] go back and read it again. But it's just
[1:20:05] an expression of the L. We call it a
[1:20:07] love letter. If God is love, it's an
[1:20:09] expression of who God is. And so when
[1:20:11] God begins to write in the heavens an
[1:20:14] expression of himself as as we could
[1:20:17] look up before we had a written Bible,
[1:20:19] we could see it from beginning to end
[1:20:21] the the life of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:20:24] Notice the human being wants to look
[1:20:26] toward the heavens and he put all the
[1:20:27] stars in the heavens, the zodiac
[1:20:29] starting off with the virgin ending up
[1:20:30] with Leo the lion. First coming of
[1:20:32] Christ, the second coming came by the
[1:20:34] virgin, came again as the lion of the
[1:20:36] tribe of Judah. There he puts the first
[1:20:39] Bible. Now, if we could put that picture
[1:20:41] up, and I just uh grabbed this off of
[1:20:43] some I found on the internet, but it's
[1:20:45] it it would look something like this,
[1:20:46] that God would begin maybe at 12:00
[1:20:48] there with Virgo, and it shows that
[1:20:51] Christ is coming. And listen, we're not
[1:20:53] studyers of the stars. We don't worship
[1:20:56] the stars, but we certainly can notice
[1:20:58] that in the heavens, God expressed
[1:21:00] himself, and he expressed it in the form
[1:21:02] of a virgin. The virgin shall conceive
[1:21:05] and bring forth a son. And then he winds
[1:21:08] it up to nowadays that Christ is coming
[1:21:10] as a lion of the tribe of Judah. Then he
[1:21:13] says this, the second Bible was written
[1:21:15] by Enoch and put in the pyramid.
[1:21:19] The third Bible was written and the last
[1:21:21] one is this one.
[1:21:24] Do something like this. God always does
[1:21:26] things in threes. God is perfect in
[1:21:27] threes. He's perfect. Pardon me. He's
[1:21:29] perfect in father, son, holy spirit.
[1:21:31] He's perfect in justification,
[1:21:33] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:21:34] Spirit. perfected in his threes. We're
[1:21:37] in his making. So, we're perfected in
[1:21:39] three. Soul, body, and spirit. And our
[1:21:41] bodies controlled of nerves, blood,
[1:21:42] cells, flesh. Three. All perfected in
[1:21:45] three. Brother Bam says there. Excuse
[1:21:47] me. Yes. And that great pyramid that
[1:21:50] Enoch built, the last chambers gone
[1:21:53] through, gone through, excuse me, ready
[1:21:54] for the king's chamber. Now, the coming
[1:21:56] of the Lord right in the top for the
[1:21:59] keystone. And then he says, "The great
[1:22:00] pyramid you study that points to the end
[1:22:03] time, the one that Enoch made, the
[1:22:05] zodiac, it started off with the virgin,
[1:22:06] the first coming of Christ. It's ending
[1:22:08] up with Leo the lion, the second coming.
[1:22:10] It's at hand." So he he says something
[1:22:12] about the great pyramid and Enoch made
[1:22:14] and and then he said it points to the
[1:22:16] end time. So if we could study that now,
[1:22:18] we would look and say that the pyramid
[1:22:20] even even though we don't have a full
[1:22:23] understanding, I actually took the three
[1:22:25] p the three great ones or the the three
[1:22:27] that are in Egypt nowadays. And there's
[1:22:29] some people that believe they line up to
[1:22:31] Orion's belt. But when I took it and
[1:22:33] tried to line it up, it didn't show
[1:22:35] anything. And I can't go with authority
[1:22:37] and say, "Well, the pyramids line up and
[1:22:38] they look like Orion's belt." I can't
[1:22:40] say that. But what I can say is the
[1:22:42] first Bible demonstrates Christ. The
[1:22:45] third Bible reveals Christ. And so
[1:22:48] somehow in the in the in the great
[1:22:50] making of monuments, Enoch probably
[1:22:52] didn't even know what he was doing, but
[1:22:54] he's just building something. And it
[1:22:56] demonstrates the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:58] through and through. And then he says
[1:22:59] this. Some say, excuse me, let me let me
[1:23:02] just read this one here before we before
[1:23:04] we keep going. Some say, "Brother Bam is
[1:23:05] the son of man. I thought the pillar of
[1:23:07] fire was the son of man and I'm
[1:23:09] mistaken." Then later down he says, "I'm
[1:23:11] not he. I'm his servant. And the pillar
[1:23:12] of fire is not he. It's in spirit form.
[1:23:14] which is upon the Son of Man and has
[1:23:16] come now to anoint sons of men to bring
[1:23:19] back a ministry just exactly like it
[1:23:21] said it would be in order for the head
[1:23:23] and the rest of the body to connect
[1:23:26] together just like the pyramid as Enoch
[1:23:28] built and we find that in that pyramid
[1:23:30] they never did get the headstone on it
[1:23:33] why the headstones yet to come seven
[1:23:35] steps in the pyramid we'll go through
[1:23:36] that someday I just like to show you how
[1:23:38] it's perfected with scripture so he
[1:23:41] tells us now that even as Enoch built
[1:23:43] that that there is something missing on
[1:23:45] the top and that thing that would be
[1:23:47] missing shows that Jesus Christ is
[1:23:50] coming the capstone of the pyramid. So
[1:23:53] even there it's it's you know if the
[1:23:55] first Bible shows Christ and this Bible
[1:23:58] manifests Christ certainly that Bible
[1:24:00] must manifest Christ. In Egyptian I
[1:24:03] don't know how the archaeologists
[1:24:04] figured this out so this is not a quote
[1:24:06] but I just found this online in Egyptian
[1:24:09] theology the capstone represented
[1:24:11] completion order over chaos the point of
[1:24:15] contact between heaven and earth. And I
[1:24:17] thought man they they got a few things
[1:24:18] right now. They don't have exactly
[1:24:20] right. But but maybe they're looking
[1:24:22] back and they think the Egyptians wrote
[1:24:23] it, but they're thinking, well, what the
[1:24:25] the Egyptians are actually what Enoch
[1:24:27] wanted was there's something that's
[1:24:28] going to be completed. There's a point
[1:24:30] of contact between heaven and between
[1:24:33] earth. And he's trying to, you know, in
[1:24:35] his spirit even he must know that Christ
[1:24:37] is coming. And and he begins to build a
[1:24:39] monument. Let's say it like that. And in
[1:24:41] that thing that he builds, it's a
[1:24:43] demonstration of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:24:46] Now, let me show you what it kind of
[1:24:48] looks like here. And I found these. I
[1:24:50] really like the third one here. So, go
[1:24:51] ahead and put that up. So, you can't see
[1:24:53] it there. It kind of looks like it has
[1:24:54] the capstone on, but if you look from
[1:24:56] the top down in a satellite picture,
[1:24:58] which is the next one, you can see it's
[1:25:00] flat on top. There's something missing.
[1:25:04] And then they think that before, you
[1:25:07] know, before it had like a limestone
[1:25:09] outer shell and it looked like this
[1:25:11] before and they put a capstone on it to
[1:25:13] to make it represent something. And what
[1:25:16] is does anyone have an idea of like what
[1:25:17] that could also represent?
[1:25:20] Anyone if we read in Revelations
[1:25:25] the heavenly city.
[1:25:27] So it's a pyramid shape
[1:25:32] and it comes down out of heaven. Now
[1:25:34] we're going to get into something here.
[1:25:35] You're going to have to bear with me.
[1:25:36] Like I said, if you find it in the
[1:25:37] message different, you you feel free to
[1:25:40] correct me if I'm wrong. It says
[1:25:41] something like this in Revelations
[1:25:42] 21:16. And the city lith for square and
[1:25:47] the length is as large as the breath.
[1:25:49] And he measured the city with the reed
[1:25:51] 12,000 furongs. The length and the
[1:25:53] breath and the height of it are equal. 1
[1:25:55] 1500 miles. 12,000 furongs equals500
[1:25:58] miles. So that city brother Bam said
[1:26:02] shaped like a pyramid
[1:26:04] is 1500. It's 1500 miles by 1500 miles
[1:26:08] and it's shaped. I wonder and this is
[1:26:10] just now venturing without authority. If
[1:26:13] Enoch had also something in him that
[1:26:16] knew there was something coming that a
[1:26:19] heavenly city that was coming and as he
[1:26:21] be to build because you know he's
[1:26:23] walking with God. You know the Bible
[1:26:25] said he walked with God and then he just
[1:26:27] disappeared. He he was not and that's
[1:26:29] going to happen. But I wonder while he
[1:26:31] was doing that if God began to express
[1:26:33] through him the heavenly city or or the
[1:26:36] coming of Christ that would be becoming.
[1:26:38] Now listen to this. This is this is
[1:26:40] important. And I and I was listening to
[1:26:41] future homeman and and before the
[1:26:43] brother even asked the question I heard
[1:26:45] brother Bham say this notice but this
[1:26:47] geographical measure now that we have
[1:26:48] who dimensions are the same doesn't
[1:26:51] necessarily mean that has to be a cube.
[1:26:52] Notice this would answer Egypt or
[1:26:55] Enoch's sign in Egypt. So when Enoch's
[1:26:58] doing this it's a sign of something. And
[1:27:00] brother Bam says that sign answers what
[1:27:03] we see in Revelation the dimensions. He
[1:27:05] said in the earth's time of purifying by
[1:27:07] its baptism of fire. There'll be
[1:27:09] volcanics such as this earth exploding.
[1:27:11] It'll push up a pyramid-like mountain.
[1:27:13] See plenty of room to do it. The whole
[1:27:15] thing will be changed. The whole surface
[1:27:17] will be changed. You got it. It'll push
[1:27:19] up a pyramid-like mountain. This would
[1:27:21] be exactly with the word if it does it
[1:27:23] now. No. And he goes into there. And I
[1:27:25] thought, now wait a minute.
[1:27:28] Does it push up a mountain
[1:27:31] or does the holy city descend out of
[1:27:33] heaven?
[1:27:34] Isn't that just a beautiful one, brother
[1:27:36] Kurt? I love it because you know if
[1:27:38] there's a Bible question, there must be
[1:27:40] a Bible answer. Listen to the next
[1:27:42] quote. This is questions and answers.
[1:27:44] Said, "I'm a pilgrim, a stranger looking
[1:27:45] for a city whose builder and maker is
[1:27:47] God. He knowed that city was somewhere.
[1:27:49] Oh my." And I believe that right on the
[1:27:51] grounds where he looked for it right
[1:27:52] there in Palestine. That's where it'll
[1:27:54] raise up.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; For it's on Mount Zion. There's where
[1:27:58] she'll be. And and as I was studying
[1:28:00] this, I began to get lost in God. Now
[1:28:02] I'm confused, Lord, because you said
[1:28:05] it'll come down. John saw it. I mean, he
[1:28:07] saw it. You read in Revelations, he he
[1:28:10] says it right here that that he saw it
[1:28:12] descend out of heaven as a bride
[1:28:14] prepared for her husband. And he says
[1:28:17] coming down from even uses coming down
[1:28:20] from God. And then brother Bam says it
[1:28:22] pushes up. And and I just begin to like
[1:28:25] ponder this. How could it be that it
[1:28:27] pushes up and it comes down?
[1:28:31] I know you're looking for me for the
[1:28:32] answer. I don't have it, but I'm going
[1:28:35] to read some quotes. And I think in
[1:28:37] there, there's an answer in there. And
[1:28:40] there's a reason we read first John
[1:28:42] because on earth
[1:28:44] was God
[1:28:47] in flesh, virgin born manifestation.
[1:28:51] And yet John saw something. It was like,
[1:28:54] well, we'll read the quote in a second.
[1:28:56] It was like there's a piece of God on
[1:28:58] earth and there's a capstone coming
[1:29:01] down. And I wonder if that's the same
[1:29:04] with you and me. I wonder if in there's
[1:29:07] a predestinated seed. I'm just going to
[1:29:09] skip the quote and go to this. There's a
[1:29:11] predestinated seed inside of you.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; You might have, you know, even when
[1:29:15] you're in the world, even when you were
[1:29:17] you were in sin and you were struggling
[1:29:19] and you know the seed, not the flesh,
[1:29:21] the seed was predestinated. And it was
[1:29:24] predestinated by God's fornowledge
[1:29:26] before the foundation of the world. So,
[1:29:28] so that was predestinated
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; and it was on earth,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; but it wasn't come capt. The Holy Spirit
[1:29:36] hadn't come down on it yet, but it was
[1:29:38] predestinated. Brother told me a story
[1:29:40] the other day where he said that even
[1:29:42] while he was in sin, God prevented him
[1:29:45] from doing certain things in his life
[1:29:47] and protected him in certain moments
[1:29:49] that probably would have drawn him away
[1:29:51] from where he should have been. What was
[1:29:52] it? a seed predestinated in the person
[1:29:56] before he was even filled with the Holy
[1:29:57] Ghost, before he was even justified,
[1:29:59] quite frankly. So now that seed is on
[1:30:02] earth, but it's not capped yet. And so I
[1:30:05] feel this is brother Steve now, but it's
[1:30:07] something like this that that you're
[1:30:09] here on earth and it's a type of when
[1:30:11] you get the Holy Ghost, when you're
[1:30:12] converted. And so you're here, but you
[1:30:14] might not be capped yet, but now God
[1:30:17] comes down out of heaven. And heaven on
[1:30:19] in heaven means heaven on earth,
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; the predestinated sea that's inside you
[1:30:26] that was placed there before the
[1:30:28] foundation of the world. And you might
[1:30:30] look at you and say, "But brother Steve,
[1:30:32] I couldn't be heaven on earth when I was
[1:30:34] living in sin." Oh, I tend to disagree.
[1:30:38] I think that you just didn't know that
[1:30:40] you were heaven on earth, just like this
[1:30:42] earth doesn't know that it's Jerusalem
[1:30:44] on earth yet. But one day when it's
[1:30:46] purified by fire and heaven will connect
[1:30:48] with it, earth will have a realization
[1:30:51] that it's heaven on earth and heaven and
[1:30:53] heaven will meet heaven on earth just
[1:30:55] like it did when you got a realization
[1:30:58] and you got a purifying by fire and
[1:31:00] heaven and heaven met you heaven on
[1:31:03] earth. Oh, that's all right. I love
[1:31:07] preaching questions and answers. It's
[1:31:09] better than reading questions and
[1:31:10] answers, you know. Do you get it though?
[1:31:12] If you're predestinated,
[1:31:15] not your flesh,
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; your seed is predestinated.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; I mean, you could no more be lost
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; than God himself could be lost.
[1:31:26] You know, this very earth that you're on
[1:31:29] is an expression of God. Man has
[1:31:32] corrupted it. Man continues to corrupt
[1:31:35] it. If time goes on, it'll just get
[1:31:37] worse and worse. Irritates me so bad. We
[1:31:39] got a snowstorm. We get no snow. It
[1:31:41] seems to be warming up. The lake I go to
[1:31:43] like to fish at is drying up. I just It
[1:31:46] really frustrates me. But that's just
[1:31:48] the corruption of man. But one day it's
[1:31:51] going to be back to the expression that
[1:31:53] God meant for it at the beginning. Just
[1:31:56] like when you were a, you know, you were
[1:31:58] a sinner and you were filthy and you
[1:32:00] were laden with sins, but God had to
[1:32:03] come and purify before he could come out
[1:32:05] of heaven and his holy mountain could
[1:32:07] descend upon you. Heaven on earth. All
[1:32:10] right. All right. I hope that makes
[1:32:11] sense. I want to read these quotes,
[1:32:12] though. When he went, see now, see now,
[1:32:14] brother Van begins in future home to
[1:32:16] talk about Jesus on earth. And right in
[1:32:19] the middle of future home, he's talking
[1:32:21] about God on earth. Why is he doing
[1:32:23] that? He's teaching us something about
[1:32:25] this. When he went up out of the water,
[1:32:26] he said, "I saw heavens open." The
[1:32:28] prophet saw it. He saw the heavens open.
[1:32:31] And here come descending out of heaven a
[1:32:32] form of a dove and a voice saying, "This
[1:32:34] is my part of the earth that I've
[1:32:36] redeemed."
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; What? What? Do you understand what he's
[1:32:39] saying? there my part that I've redeemed
[1:32:41] and from this part of the earth I'll
[1:32:43] redeem the rest of it. Who's he talking
[1:32:46] about? He's talking about the Lord Jesus
[1:32:47] Christ. And and he says my part of the
[1:32:49] earth I've redeemed and through him I'll
[1:32:52] redeem the entirety of the earth for
[1:32:54] he's my word made manifest in the whole
[1:32:56] world I spoke it into existence by my
[1:32:58] word. Hebrews 11. And Satan has held it
[1:33:01] all this time but I've come to redeemed
[1:33:03] it. So much of it has made his body
[1:33:06] of it has made his body and I'm coming
[1:33:08] to dwell in it. So much of this earth
[1:33:11] made his body and God came and dwelt and
[1:33:13] John said, "I saw the holy seed." Notice
[1:33:15] this is the next I mean this is the next
[1:33:17] thing here. So he goes from Christ on
[1:33:19] earth now in in John chapter 1. Now
[1:33:22] we're in Revelations 21 just from one
[1:33:25] paragraph to the next. John said, "I saw
[1:33:27] the holy city, the new Jerusalem,
[1:33:29] descending out of heaven as a bride
[1:33:30] adorned for her husband. And where did
[1:33:33] it settle on? Just exactly like it did
[1:33:36] there upon the earth.
[1:33:38] Where does it settle on on you? Jesus
[1:33:42] was part of that earth that the Holy
[1:33:43] Ghost descended upon. Is that right? And
[1:33:45] it remained on him forever. It can never
[1:33:47] leave him. It's always there. He and God
[1:33:48] are one. Always has to remain. And so
[1:33:51] John saw the holy city, the new
[1:33:52] Jerusalem, descending like a common or a
[1:33:54] dove coming out of heaven and settling
[1:33:56] on a redeemed entire earth to do what?
[1:33:58] to claim every attribute that he made
[1:34:01] the earth for. Every man that was
[1:34:03] represented in the eternity and every
[1:34:05] woman is redeemed. Then she has been
[1:34:07] scoured and burned by fire. My isn't it?
[1:34:10] I'm sorry. It's a beautiful thought.
[1:34:12] Jesus and his fiery temptations in the
[1:34:13] wilderness for 40 days. After that,
[1:34:15] notice it was ready for his ministry.
[1:34:17] Then think of it, the Holy Ghost
[1:34:19] descending upon earth. Jesus and that
[1:34:22] holy blood. Now watch, and I hope to get
[1:34:24] too deep for you. See the holy blood
[1:34:26] that was created by God. the blood, the
[1:34:28] life, the creation of God. Jesus was the
[1:34:31] beginning of the creation of God. Oh,
[1:34:34] you see it. God made in creation. He was
[1:34:36] spirit. The Bible said he's the
[1:34:37] beginning of the creation of God. How
[1:34:39] did he begin? In the wombs of a woman.
[1:34:41] Praise God. Now, now watch.
[1:34:45] Look them hands. Now, this is a this is
[1:34:47] we go from paragraph 316 to 357. Same
[1:34:50] message. Now watch. Look them hands
[1:34:52] designed this for his beloved bride.
[1:34:55] designs and tenderly love for his bride.
[1:34:58] Remember that the Holy Ghost descended
[1:34:59] on Jesus which Jesus was a part of the
[1:35:01] earth. Why? The germ of God. The life of
[1:35:04] God was designed in the womb of a woman.
[1:35:07] That right? Which was the earth. All
[1:35:09] right. Then the life of God came in. So
[1:35:11] he was the beginning of the creation of
[1:35:13] God. See, and then that blood of God
[1:35:16] that was there by the germ where when it
[1:35:18] was shed at Calvary dropped back upon
[1:35:20] the earth. What for? To redeem the
[1:35:22] earth. Now it's been justified. It's
[1:35:24] been sanctified, called, and claimed.
[1:35:26] And now it's to receive its baptism of
[1:35:29] fire and be cleansed for Jesus and his
[1:35:31] bride. And you are these outer parts
[1:35:33] that's drawn out of this earth. The
[1:35:35] earth, you're a part of the earth. Your
[1:35:37] body, your soul is a part of God, an
[1:35:39] attribute of God displayed here on earth
[1:35:41] in a body. The body is to be redeemed.
[1:35:43] Now, the soul is redeemed because it was
[1:35:45] in sin. So God come down by a process
[1:35:48] and he does this with the earth of
[1:35:50] justification, sanctification, baptism
[1:35:53] of the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul
[1:35:55] and you being a part of the earth is
[1:35:57] redeemed by it. You're in the process
[1:35:59] now. It's growing. Your body was
[1:36:01] justified under Noah's baptism. Amen. In
[1:36:03] your flesh when it dropped upon there
[1:36:05] and the earth is to be cleansed by fire,
[1:36:07] the place where you live with the
[1:36:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost, a dwelling
[1:36:10] place for Christ and his bride, the new
[1:36:13] Jerusalem. You really can't separate
[1:36:15] them. that God would come down on the
[1:36:17] Holy Ghost upon earth. You upon you a
[1:36:19] redeem and he would he would descend and
[1:36:21] where would he come out of when he fills
[1:36:23] you with the Holy Ghost? He would come
[1:36:24] out of none other than eternity out of
[1:36:26] heaven and fill you with the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:28] Earth redeemed and he and he does that
[1:36:30] and he and he gives a capstone to you.
[1:36:34] Of course he does it. So if and I hope
[1:36:36] this you know doesn't answer the
[1:36:37] question but we begin to think about the
[1:36:39] pyramid. think something come up from
[1:36:42] earth and out of heaven and they met and
[1:36:47] that's the beautiful part of it. I got
[1:36:51] more on that here but we'll just we'll
[1:36:53] just skip forward to the next question.
[1:36:56] Well, let me read this one. Luke 17:20.
[1:36:58] And when he was demanded of the
[1:37:00] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[1:37:01] come, he answered him and said, "The
[1:37:05] kingdom of God cometh not with
[1:37:07] observation.
[1:37:10] Neither shall they say, lo here or lo
[1:37:12] there, for behold,
[1:37:14] the kingdom of God is within you."
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a good That makes me happy.
[1:37:21] Praise the Lord. All right. I hope that
[1:37:22] gave you a little insight into that. I
[1:37:25] don't know. Oh, you don't just say the
[1:37:26] pyramids exactly, but that to me it's a
[1:37:29] sign of something. Enoch sign, a a
[1:37:32] capstone, a sign of something to come.
[1:37:35] Praise the Lord. All right. Now, next
[1:37:37] question. All right. And by by the way,
[1:37:39] if you're a visitor, these are doctrinal
[1:37:41] questions, maybe a little bit for our
[1:37:43] church. And uh yeah, so if you had any
[1:37:46] more questions after the service, we'd
[1:37:48] be happy to explain those. Question.
[1:37:50] Does heaven only last? Do we have that
[1:37:52] there, Sister Pauline? Farther down
[1:37:54] there.
[1:37:55] Yep. Does heaven only last a thousand
[1:37:58] years?
[1:38:00] Then do we go to a place like earth?
[1:38:03] Does hell only last a thousand years? A
[1:38:06] good question. I think maybe in the
[1:38:07] messages sometimes I'll talk about the
[1:38:09] millennium or the thousand years and
[1:38:11] we'll reign with him a thousand years.
[1:38:13] And it's true. We will we will reign
[1:38:16] with him a thousand years. But heaven
[1:38:18] doesn't only last a thousand years. And
[1:38:20] reality that thousand years isn't even
[1:38:22] heaven. That's a a reign here on earth.
[1:38:25] Now, we'll call, you know, it's it's a
[1:38:28] it's a type. It's a resting time for the
[1:38:30] earth. And we could say that Satan is
[1:38:32] bound a thousand years. And we'll read a
[1:38:34] scripture maybe to to kind of uh go
[1:38:36] through that there in Revelations 20. I
[1:38:39] saw an angel. Revelations 20:1. And I
[1:38:42] saw an angel come down from heaven
[1:38:43] having the key of the bottomless pit and
[1:38:46] a great chain in his hand. and he laid
[1:38:48] hold on the dragon, that old serpent,
[1:38:50] which is the devil and Satan, and bound
[1:38:53] him a thousand years and cast him into
[1:38:57] the bottomless pit. So now we know it's
[1:38:59] a thousand years and Satan is bound and
[1:39:02] ca and he's cast into the bottomless pit
[1:39:04] and shut him up and set a seal upon him
[1:39:06] that he should deceive the nations no
[1:39:08] more till the thousand years should be
[1:39:10] fulfilled. After that he must be loosed
[1:39:13] a little season. And I saw thrones and
[1:39:16] they sat upon him. They sat upon him,
[1:39:18] and judgment was given unto them. And I
[1:39:20] saw the souls of them that were beheaded
[1:39:22] for the witness of Jesus, and for the
[1:39:24] word of God, and which had not worshiped
[1:39:26] the beast, neither his image, neither
[1:39:28] had received his mark upon their
[1:39:29] foreheads or in their hands. And they
[1:39:31] lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
[1:39:35] years. And there's some things important
[1:39:36] in that verse and I know it's a long one
[1:39:38] but where he sees the thrones and and
[1:39:41] and now he's still looking in this
[1:39:43] millennial time period this thousand
[1:39:44] years and he says judgment was given to
[1:39:47] them and I saw that the ones now they
[1:39:49] they were beheaded and for the word of
[1:39:52] God and they had not worshiped the beast
[1:39:55] they didn't worship his image they
[1:39:57] didn't receive a mark on their foreheads
[1:39:59] or in their hands and they lived and
[1:40:02] reigned with him a thousand years. So
[1:40:04] there's a group that didn't receive
[1:40:07] marks that will live and reign with
[1:40:10] Christ for a thousand years. So now
[1:40:13] Satan is bound during that time and
[1:40:15] they'll live. And then uh the rest of
[1:40:17] the dead live not again until the
[1:40:19] thousand words were finished. This is
[1:40:21] the first resurrection. Blessed is hol
[1:40:23] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[1:40:25] the first resurrection. on such the
[1:40:27] second death hath no power, but they
[1:40:29] shall be priests of God and of Christ
[1:40:31] and shall reign with him a thousand
[1:40:33] years. So now we have this time. Go to
[1:40:36] the slide there. I think we have a
[1:40:37] picture and we kind of drew this maybe
[1:40:39] to give uh something that would help you
[1:40:42] to understand. We'll read that there.
[1:40:43] And then at the return of the church and
[1:40:45] the bride, the bride and Christ shall
[1:40:47] walk out upon their ashes in the
[1:40:49] millennium when the earth is purified by
[1:40:51] fire. And so now there's a time period
[1:40:54] at the end of the tribulation where the
[1:40:55] earth is purified and the bride and
[1:40:57] Christ shall walk upon their ashes in
[1:40:59] the millennium. The earth is purified
[1:41:01] and there they shall reign. And the
[1:41:03] heathens that's never heard the gospel
[1:41:05] shall be raised in that time. And the
[1:41:07] sons of God will be manifested. If he's
[1:41:10] to reign, he's got to have something to
[1:41:12] reign over. He's got a domain. And they
[1:41:14] ruled and reigned with Christ. And
[1:41:15] Christ ruled with a rod of iron the
[1:41:17] nations. Then the gospel, then the
[1:41:20] manifested sons of God with the
[1:41:21] authority just like he had when he was
[1:41:23] here. See, there will come the
[1:41:25] millennium in that rain. See, upon the
[1:41:27] ashes. If we could go to that next one
[1:41:29] there, and we'll try to point it out.
[1:41:31] And again, this is doing the best we can
[1:41:33] here to kind of explain. And and someone
[1:41:35] else asked a question about what's next.
[1:41:38] I think the question was what's next?
[1:41:40] What's what are we waiting for? What's
[1:41:41] the next thing? And uh Thessalonians,
[1:41:43] pull up 1 Thessalonians 4, Sister
[1:41:45] Pauling, and we'll read that there. um
[1:41:47] then we were alive and remain. It's
[1:41:49] toward the end of the chapter. Okay. So,
[1:41:51] the next thing we're looking for is
[1:41:53] called the resurrection.
[1:41:56] That's the next thing that we're looking
[1:41:58] for. We're not looking for one day to
[1:42:00] just be raptured. Although we are
[1:42:01] looking for that, but the next thing in
[1:42:03] the process, Paul says, then we which
[1:42:05] are alive, go ahead and pull that up.
[1:42:07] And remain shall be caught up together
[1:42:10] with them in the clouds to meet them. Um
[1:42:12] I think go to the verse before that.
[1:42:16] Sorry about that. For the Lord himself,
[1:42:19] this is the next thing, shall descend
[1:42:21] from heaven with a shout. Now the shout
[1:42:24] is, anyone know what the shout is?
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; The message. The shout is the message.
[1:42:30] So sure it happened. It is happening
[1:42:32] right now. So the shout is the message.
[1:42:35] So that's the process with the voice of
[1:42:37] the archangel.
[1:42:39] What does the voice of the archangel do?
[1:42:41] But call and with the trump of God and
[1:42:43] the dead in Christ shall rise first. So
[1:42:45] there's something that's going to happen
[1:42:48] first and that is the dead in Christ
[1:42:50] shall rise first. So the next thing when
[1:42:52] I say the next thing we're looking for
[1:42:54] the resurrection the shout is going on
[1:42:57] right now. There's the voice of the
[1:42:59] archangel which I believe is calling
[1:43:02] those those those dead saints up out of
[1:43:04] the grave. Then there's a trump of God
[1:43:07] and that's the the the the great we
[1:43:09] would say trumpet but it's the great
[1:43:11] sounding forth of God. Okay, go to the
[1:43:13] next verse. So we know the next thing is
[1:43:15] the resurrection. Then we which are
[1:43:17] alive and remain. So now there's going
[1:43:20] to be some that are alive. So there's a
[1:43:22] resurrection that happened. Graves are
[1:43:24] literally, you know, maybe not literally
[1:43:26] all of a sudden graves are going to open
[1:43:27] up. But God's going to gather and he
[1:43:29] knows where the atoms are. You know, he
[1:43:31] knows where the pieces he needs to
[1:43:33] gather are because somebody has to knock
[1:43:35] on your door. So it's got to be like a
[1:43:37] physical being that's going to come and
[1:43:39] and and and and you're going to I think
[1:43:41] he says it like this. you're going to
[1:43:43] take a step towards them and they'll
[1:43:44] take a step towards you and and then
[1:43:45] it'll be on. And so God will gather in a
[1:43:49] resurrection those bodies of those
[1:43:51] saints the that that that that were
[1:43:54] filled that received the message for
[1:43:55] their day, even the ones, you know, from
[1:43:58] Paul's day to this day. And then they'll
[1:44:00] be they'll be resurrected or they'll be
[1:44:02] brought together and and and their
[1:44:04] bodies and the cells in their bodies and
[1:44:06] they'll, you know, your loved ones that
[1:44:08] you might have might come knocking at
[1:44:10] your door. I'm looking at some of you
[1:44:11] that might have lost children or might
[1:44:13] have lost parents that believe this
[1:44:15] message. Guess what? There'll be some
[1:44:17] surprises on that day, I believe. And
[1:44:19] you might even be surprised at who would
[1:44:20] knock at your door. But, you know, a
[1:44:22] knock will come and you'll have so much,
[1:44:25] you know, it'll it'll quicken you so
[1:44:26] much to see that thing. It might just be
[1:44:29] the extra step of faith you need to have
[1:44:31] that body changed. Okay. So, now you're
[1:44:33] we're alive. Some of us are going to be
[1:44:35] alive
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; and remain and be caught up together. So
[1:44:39] now there's a catching up. That word is
[1:44:42] uh the word we use for rapture is
[1:44:44] actually Greek and it means catching
[1:44:45] away. So now those that are resurrected,
[1:44:49] those saints and then we which are
[1:44:51] alive. So it's kind of two groups there.
[1:44:54] There's some that are dead and some that
[1:44:56] are alive, but they're not dead in, you
[1:44:58] know, eternal separation. They're just
[1:44:59] not. They're just sleeping, you know. So
[1:45:01] there, but then we'll be caught up
[1:45:02] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:45:06] the Lord in the air. And so shall we
[1:45:08] ever be with the Lord. Go to back to
[1:45:09] that slide. So the next thing's the
[1:45:11] resurrection and then there's a space of
[1:45:14] time in the first resurrection and I
[1:45:17] mean first resurrection when Jesus
[1:45:19] resurrected he didn't just resurrect and
[1:45:22] go immediately to ascending.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; He resurrected and he did some things. I
[1:45:27] think did he go fishing? Tell me he went
[1:45:29] fishing. Somebody tell me that he's
[1:45:31] going to go to Lake Pal with me, you
[1:45:32] know. But anyway, so I believe he went
[1:45:34] fishing or at least went to where Peter
[1:45:36] was fishing and then he there was some
[1:45:38] cooking that went on. So he ate and then
[1:45:41] he showed himself to two that were
[1:45:43] walking on the road to Emmas and there
[1:45:45] was I think 143 fish caught in one time
[1:45:48] and and so he did some things. There was
[1:45:50] a time period. Brother Brandham calls it
[1:45:52] a month or so.
[1:45:54] So we'll just call it a month or so. I
[1:45:56] put those arrows close together, but
[1:45:57] it's a month or so. 30 days, 40 days. So
[1:46:00] then it's resurrection, rapture. Then
[1:46:03] there's this time period here. And I
[1:46:05] kind of blurred these lines because I
[1:46:08] don't like to put anything too
[1:46:09] definitive, you know. So anyway, there's
[1:46:11] this this that's the reason there is is
[1:46:12] is the 30 to 40 days, but there's a
[1:46:15] three and a half year wedding supper and
[1:46:17] I put or tribulation. Well, it kind of
[1:46:19] depends where you're at.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; It kind of depends where you're at. You
[1:46:23] know, [laughter]
[1:46:24] I'm praying, brother Brandon. I want to
[1:46:26] be in those. I want to be eating. you
[1:46:28] [laughter] know, I I I really want to
[1:46:29] be, but there's going to be some,
[1:46:32] Brother Brandon words it like this. They
[1:46:34] they didn't accept the atonement fully
[1:46:38] that are going to go through the
[1:46:39] tribulation for three and a half years.
[1:46:43] You don't want to be in that groom. So,
[1:46:45] you know, if you had an option today and
[1:46:47] you haven't made it sure, make it sure
[1:46:51] because you don't want to be in the
[1:46:52] tribulation. It's going to be a time no
[1:46:54] like it like never before. Never before
[1:46:56] it or after it. I think the Bible says
[1:46:58] there's never been a time as bad as
[1:47:00] that. It's going to be tribulation. It's
[1:47:02] called great tribulation. So, we want to
[1:47:05] miss that. But that is going to be a
[1:47:07] time. So, uh
[1:47:10] in heaven or in another dimension, I'll
[1:47:13] say it like that. There's going to be a
[1:47:15] wedding supper. And brother Benham says
[1:47:16] the table for that supper, now this
[1:47:19] isn't like some doctrine, you know, I've
[1:47:20] got it measured out, but he says it's
[1:47:22] thousands of miles long. He there's a
[1:47:25] quote. He says thousands of miles long
[1:47:28] and I if you wonder is there any room at
[1:47:30] that table there's room there's room for
[1:47:33] you this morning if you haven't made
[1:47:34] that sure it's thousands of I I did one
[1:47:37] time I did like thousands of miles and
[1:47:39] then 5,280 ft and each person takes
[1:47:41] three feet you know I went a little
[1:47:42] weird with it but and I didn't even know
[1:47:44] are we on both sides of the table is it
[1:47:46] a round table anyways point is there's
[1:47:49] room
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; so you don't want to be left here left
[1:47:53] behind on earth during that time. There
[1:47:56] will be somewhere who will have to give
[1:47:57] their life.
[1:48:00] They'll have to give their life and then
[1:48:01] they'll sleep [snorts] for a thousand
[1:48:03] years. But we will reign for a thousand
[1:48:07] years. You read the scripture. He says
[1:48:09] they'll reign with him for a thousand
[1:48:11] years on earth with a rod of iron. And
[1:48:15] that's an interesting. So there's some
[1:48:17] people now he says in that quote and I
[1:48:19] don't don't ask me what that means by
[1:48:21] the way because he says there'll be
[1:48:22] heathens raised during that time that
[1:48:24] never had a chance to hear the gospel.
[1:48:25] Put that back up sister Pauline if you
[1:48:27] would. So so there'll be so he says
[1:48:29] that. So he then he words it like this.
[1:48:31] If he's going to reign he's got to have
[1:48:32] somebody to reign over.
[1:48:36] Uh right there. Yeah. He's got to have
[1:48:38] something something to reign over. He's
[1:48:40] got a domain. Okay. So he's we're
[1:48:42] reigning with him over something and
[1:48:46] we'll reign. And I think brother Jim
[1:48:47] used to tell it like this and I like it.
[1:48:49] You know, if they wouldn't bring their
[1:48:51] tithes into the city, then we would say
[1:48:54] it's not going to rain. And I think this
[1:48:56] is scriptural too in Isaiah if I'm not
[1:48:58] mistaken. Is Isaiah Isaiah 66 maybe? So
[1:49:01] So they didn't bring their ties in. And
[1:49:04] so we would say you're not getting rain
[1:49:05] for three years. So there's a a way of
[1:49:08] reigning that it's you know you're going
[1:49:10] to have to line up. It's with a rod and
[1:49:13] then go back to the slider. So that's
[1:49:15] for a thousand years.
[1:49:18] That's a long time. I think it'll be
[1:49:20] just the most blessed time. Okay. So
[1:49:22] it's a millennial reign and then yeah
[1:49:25] just a blink maybe just like a day. Go
[1:49:28] to the next slide. So then that thousand
[1:49:30] years ended in the Bible. We read the
[1:49:32] scripture a minute ago. Satan is loosed
[1:49:34] for a season.
[1:49:36] And I don't know what that time period
[1:49:38] is, but there's a battle. It's called
[1:49:40] the battle of Gog and Magog. And I'll
[1:49:43] give you the the the key here. Don't bet
[1:49:46] on Satan on that one. He's already lost.
[1:49:48] Okay. So, the the saints win. And then
[1:49:51] there's the what we call the white, it's
[1:49:53] in the Bible, the white gray white
[1:49:55] throne judgment or the white throne
[1:49:56] judgment. There's a judgment. every
[1:49:59] person that's dead. That's not, you
[1:50:02] know, the saints are going to be there
[1:50:04] judging, but there's going to be judging
[1:50:07] everybody that lived during that time.
[1:50:09] Now, you have the option to escape that.
[1:50:11] That's a beauty of it by being the ones
[1:50:14] that do the judging with Christ or the
[1:50:16] the ruling or the the judging for lack
[1:50:19] of a better term. So, that's a judgment
[1:50:21] time. And I kind of blurred that again
[1:50:22] because it's Satan loosed for a season,
[1:50:25] a battle. I'm not getting too
[1:50:26] complicated here. and then a judgment
[1:50:29] and then John chapter 2 and there's many
[1:50:32] other scriptures we we have a few of
[1:50:34] them up here and this is the promise
[1:50:35] that he have promised us even eternal
[1:50:38] life so heaven is not a thousand years
[1:50:41] the millennial reign is a thousand years
[1:50:43] but then there's more happening after
[1:50:45] that heaven is heaven is
[1:50:46] incomprehensible for us because we say
[1:50:49] the word eternity I love I was listening
[1:50:50] to message and brother Bham said it like
[1:50:52] this Christ stepped out is it already
[1:50:56] 12:10 oh my goodness
[1:50:59] We want to get to the next question, but
[1:51:00] we'll finish this one. Christ stepped
[1:51:03] out of eternity
[1:51:06] into earth. And then he says there's a
[1:51:09] scripture that says, "I come from God
[1:51:12] and I go to God." He says he stepped out
[1:51:15] of eternity and then he says he stepped
[1:51:18] back into eternity. So he stepped out of
[1:51:20] God and into God. And so God, you know,
[1:51:23] I'll just maybe I'll answer part of a
[1:51:24] question here, but we'll get to it
[1:51:25] Wednesday. God uh you know he's talking
[1:51:28] and he says where were you Job when the
[1:51:31] sons of God shouted for joy
[1:51:34] and we don't believe it I'll give a
[1:51:36] little bit of the answer here we have a
[1:51:38] lot more for it on Wednesday but we
[1:51:40] don't believe any the doctrine brother
[1:51:42] Bam says it like this of pre-existence
[1:51:43] of souls or even eternal sunship he
[1:51:47] words it like that so you I hate to
[1:51:49] break this to anybody but you didn't
[1:51:51] actually like exist in a physical being
[1:51:54] at the beginning although we like to say
[1:51:55] like I was there. No, brother Steve, I
[1:51:58] was there. And and he looks at Job and
[1:52:00] he says, "Where were you?" And and and
[1:52:02] we say, "Brother, but Brother Steve, I
[1:52:04] was there. I believe I was there." And
[1:52:06] you know, in physical being, you weren't
[1:52:09] I hate to break it. You weren't there.
[1:52:11] But here's the key.
[1:52:13] When God has a thought,
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; God, now I have thoughts. I'll tell you,
[1:52:19] I have a thought. I love Sister Dette.
[1:52:20] That's a thought. And then I express it.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I become that thought. You
[1:52:27] know I confess that you know I I become
[1:52:29] that I be actually become that love for
[1:52:32] sister Dette. Now I have a thought now I
[1:52:34] might have a thought that you know I'm
[1:52:36] going to DeMarcos today brother Ryan
[1:52:38] that would almost be you know just
[1:52:40] material but I might not go to DeMarcos.
[1:52:43] So I might have a thought and it might
[1:52:45] not happen
[1:52:47] but I might have a thought and it might
[1:52:49] become part of me. You're I'm human. I
[1:52:51] can have thoughts and and some of my
[1:52:52] thoughts aren't my thoughts quite
[1:52:53] frankly. Satan drops them in there and I
[1:52:55] kick them back out, you know. So, I can
[1:52:56] have thoughts that aren't mine, but I
[1:52:58] can also have thoughts that that are
[1:53:00] mine that don't become reality.
[1:53:04] Well, God can't. He's not that way.
[1:53:06] [laughter]
[1:53:07] So, when I when I say, "Where were you,
[1:53:09] brother Bill?" When the sons of God
[1:53:11] shouted for joy and brother Bill, I
[1:53:13] believe I was there. Well, you know
[1:53:14] what? Because he was in the thought of
[1:53:16] God, which can't be a thought that comes
[1:53:18] and goes and fleeting and changes it.
[1:53:20] No, no, no, no, no, no. It's so
[1:53:22] material.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; It's actually a material thought. So if
[1:53:26] God thought about you, then you were
[1:53:29] there,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; but you weren't there physical, but you
[1:53:32] were there in the perfection of his
[1:53:34] almighty thoughts. So when I, you know,
[1:53:36] you hear a minister and we all kind of
[1:53:37] like to do it, man, I was there. And you
[1:53:39] know, we get all riled up. We can
[1:53:40] misconceive that a little bit and go,
[1:53:42] "Wait a minute, brother Steve, you know,
[1:53:44] I wasn't actually." No, you you were but
[1:53:46] you actually you were more there than if
[1:53:49] you would think you were there right now
[1:53:51] because you were there and the thoughts
[1:53:53] eternal cannot change of God. Now I can
[1:53:58] have a thought. I could change a
[1:54:00] thought. So God's thoughts I think he
[1:54:03] says it something like this. He never
[1:54:04] had a uh how does he word it? But he
[1:54:08] never had a thought that he had to
[1:54:10] change. It's something like that. So now
[1:54:12] God would have a thought of brother
[1:54:15] Steve
[1:54:16] and you know what that thought it just
[1:54:18] materializes.
[1:54:20] And so even though it wasn't like
[1:54:22] materialized back then but but because
[1:54:24] God lives in eternity but before he
[1:54:27] steps out of eternity because he lives
[1:54:29] there he's looking at Job and he's going
[1:54:32] where [screaming] are you Job? And he's
[1:54:34] speaking like Job do you even know I'm
[1:54:36] looking at eternity and you're right
[1:54:38] there with the sons of God shouting for
[1:54:40] joy. Where were you? And Job would have
[1:54:42] been I'm there
[1:54:46] because why? Because God's not even in
[1:54:48] this thing that we call time. It's
[1:54:50] beyond time. And we get caught up in it
[1:54:52] and it it battle and we battle it and we
[1:54:55] go back and forth and we wonder about
[1:54:57] it.
[1:54:58] Well, where were you when the sons of
[1:55:00] God shouted for joy? I'm right. I was
[1:55:02] right there. How do you know you were
[1:55:03] there, man? I just I just know I was
[1:55:05] there. But but how do you know, Brother
[1:55:07] Steve? Well, let me tell you. Let me
[1:55:09] tell you what happens in brother Steve's
[1:55:10] life. I go back and I begin to doubting
[1:55:12] my own experience sometimes. I begin to
[1:55:15] wonder if I'm going to make it and I
[1:55:16] begin to think there's no hope for me.
[1:55:18] And then and then what happens is I like
[1:55:20] pull on this little anchor, you know,
[1:55:21] boy and it holds. And I'm like, you know
[1:55:23] what? That's how I know cuz every time I
[1:55:26] went down and pulled on that anchor, it
[1:55:28] held. That's how I know. So I know I was
[1:55:30] in the eternal thoughts of God. Which of
[1:55:32] God have a thought? It became material.
[1:55:34] And that's you.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just unbelievable actually.
[1:55:39] It's believable though. But it's it's
[1:55:41] believable, but it's incomprehensible
[1:55:43] for our little canary pea brains, you
[1:55:45] know. But it's true nonetheless.
[1:55:48] So if God has a that'll be the third
[1:55:51] one. I know, [sighs]
[1:55:53] man. The talk went too fast. We might do
[1:55:55] questions and answers all year. How's
[1:55:57] that? We'll just preach. You know what
[1:55:59] it is, though? It's like revealing.
[1:56:02] Let me tell you what it did for me. I
[1:56:03] was wrong on some of these topics. And I
[1:56:05] began to study in it and the Lord was
[1:56:07] like, "You were wrong there." And
[1:56:08] because I really kind of like thought I
[1:56:10] was there. But that's okay because when
[1:56:13] I read about it, I was actually more
[1:56:15] there than I thought I was there.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; I was actually more there than I even
[1:56:19] preconceived that I was there because
[1:56:21] God had a thought and he never had a
[1:56:23] thought he had to take back and go,
[1:56:25] "No." You'd say, "Well, brother Steve,
[1:56:26] didn't Moses change his mind?" No, no,
[1:56:28] no. Christ was in Moses and God had a
[1:56:30] test. He had to like respond to that
[1:56:33] Christ in Moses and and and you know
[1:56:35] Ephesians 1:11 says something like this.
[1:56:37] God took the counsel of his own will.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It's be pull that up. That'll be
[1:56:42] our last scripture as your musicians
[1:56:44] come. Well, go to a verse like let's
[1:56:46] start maybe around verse 9. I don't have
[1:56:48] it up there, but I know it's in there.
[1:56:50] Having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:56:52] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:56:54] which he had purposed in himself. Verse
[1:56:57] 10. that in the dispensation of the
[1:57:00] fullness of times he might gather
[1:57:01] together in one all things in Christ
[1:57:04] both which are which in heaven and which
[1:57:05] are on earth even in him. So it's he God
[1:57:08] is saying he's going to gather and he
[1:57:10] had a he had a purpose to his will. Then
[1:57:12] go the next one and he's talking about
[1:57:14] you in whom also we have obtained an
[1:57:16] inheritance being predestinated
[1:57:19] according to the purpose of him who
[1:57:21] works all things
[1:57:23] after the counsel of his own will. Why
[1:57:26] are you even here this morning? By your
[1:57:28] will?
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:57:31] Not even like, but there's a will on the
[1:57:33] inside that brought me here this morning
[1:57:35] that, you know, I had to do like Jesus
[1:57:37] said, not my will, but I would be like
[1:57:40] to be like brother Tom. And sometimes
[1:57:41] when I go to minister, I'm like,
[1:57:43] "Brother Tom, let me at him." You know,
[1:57:44] I can't wait to come out that door. But
[1:57:45] this morning, I was like, "Lord, have
[1:57:48] him call Brother Donald up to preach."
[1:57:50] You know,
[1:57:52] because I don't have any answers, but I
[1:57:53] know one thing.
[1:57:56] if I get closer to because see, brother
[1:57:58] brother Donnie said this to me the other
[1:57:59] day. I really appreciated it, brother
[1:58:01] Donnie. He said, "Brother Steve,
[1:58:03] sometimes people don't need an answer."
[1:58:06] He said they need a guide.
[1:58:09] And I was like, "That's really good.
[1:58:11] They're going to use that." So, you
[1:58:13] might not you you might think you need
[1:58:15] an answer. Maybe you just need someone
[1:58:17] to come and follow me.
[1:58:21] But where are we going? Just follow me.
[1:58:24] No, but uh I want to know when when you
[1:58:27] know a lot of questions they ask Jesus
[1:58:29] when is it going to happen? How what
[1:58:31] what's going to be the time period? They
[1:58:33] would always ask him what about this
[1:58:34] time or what what's about the future?
[1:58:36] Just follow me. I think the day he does
[1:58:38] that you know what what about what about
[1:58:40] this this thing coming? What about the
[1:58:42] tribulation? What about the end time?
[1:58:43] There's so many questions always on a
[1:58:45] questions and answer. You have questions
[1:58:46] like that. Jesus is like you know follow
[1:58:48] me. And then while you follow him, you
[1:58:50] know what'll happen? He'll just begin to
[1:58:51] show you. But really what he wants to do
[1:58:54] is just follow him. You don't need the
[1:58:56] answer. But you really don't need the
[1:58:58] answer. You need him who is the answer
[1:59:01] on the inside. Praise the Lord. Stand
[1:59:04] stand with me this morning. And if you
[1:59:05] get him, if you get that answer on the
[1:59:07] inside, by the way, you'll still have
[1:59:09] questions. I'll still do my best to kind
[1:59:10] of approach them with you. No problem.
[1:59:13] That's I that's normal. One of the
[1:59:15] questions from my daughter. No problem
[1:59:16] at all. Happy to do it. But in the
[1:59:20] answer, I hope you see Christ and I hope
[1:59:23] you re I hope you I hope you I hope he
[1:59:25] just grabs you by the hand and he just
[1:59:27] begins to lead you and then you but see
[1:59:29] because we worry about the future so
[1:59:31] much. That's where anxiety comes from.
[1:59:33] It's a worry of the future and we all
[1:59:36] Lord but what about that and when and
[1:59:38] that you know what if if you do anything
[1:59:39] this morning don't worry about the
[1:59:41] resurrection don't worry about the la
[1:59:42] rapture follow him. Keep your eyes
[1:59:44] focused on him. You're not going to miss
[1:59:45] a thing. You're not going in the
[1:59:47] tribulation. Focus on him every day of
[1:59:50] your life and you'll make it. Praise
[1:59:52] God. Amen. Okay, what do we sing?
