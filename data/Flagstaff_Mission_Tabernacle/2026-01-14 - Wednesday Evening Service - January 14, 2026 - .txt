TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Yeah. Heat. Hallelujah. Never. And it's my desire. heart. It's my desire to live for Jesus. Is my desire to me. Everybody sh is my desire to live for him. If you could see where Jesus brought me from to where I am today. You would know the reason why I love him so you can change. I don't need her strength. It's my it's true to live for him. &gt;&gt; Lord, I like that part. If you knew &gt;&gt; if you could see where he brought me from, &gt;&gt; then you would know. Amen. I have a quick um I'll call it announcement maybe just something to mention to the body and I know there's those online. Um I put a piece of paper over there kind of by the entry on the little stand and brother Donniey's not here. I'd rather have him do this. But um we had a deacons and trustees meeting Sunday and they're considering a very large uh missionary I don't even want to call it project project regard relating to a vehicle purchase in Zimbabwe and it was brought up well why don't we mention this to the body and let them participate in the vote. in the vote. We're not, by the way, asking for a penny. It's not about that. We have plenty. Um, it's not about that. We're asking for the church to join in with us because it's very large. And so, we we thought we would do that. Brother Donnie mentioned it and we all agreed that's a good idea. Let's bring it forward to the body. That'll be the 25th Sunday. We'll do that vote. Um, it'll just be a hand vote. We're not going to make it real formal. We'll just do it by hand. On the piece of paper that's out there is just some of the questions we asked of the brother and then I spoke to the voice of God representative the other day, Monday I think, and got some more information. And so all the information that we got, we put on that paper so you can make a decision. And we'll mention this again on Sunday. So that Sunday the 25th, you can uh we're a body. And I love the idea when it was brought. I thought that's a good idea. Um, wrench it to the body and let them participate. Anyway, so that's our plan. We have one prayer request. Sister Angie Brown called in. Sister Connie, we have an update on your dad. Okay, I understand that. Okay. He had an infection on his foot he's dealing with. So, but other things also he's dealing with. So, let's go to prayer for these needs. Heavenly Father, we bow our heads before you and we want to tell you how much we love you this morning. Lord, that song echoes my testimony that Lord, if you could see where we come from, if people would know where we came from, who we were before, and then where we are today, that might help them understand how much we love you, Lord. And so, that's our testimony this morning, this evening. And Lord, we present a prayer request for Sister Angie. And we thank you for brother Glenn, the positive report that he got today. Lord, we'd ask you to continue to help our brothers. He goes through this process, this trial that you've led him and allowed him to go through. Lord, we we just want you by his side and sister Karen there with him, Lord. And may you be manifested your glory and may your presence be there with our brother. And may your just ability, Father, to work in the lives of Christians be shown in this process. For Sister Conniey's dad, Lord, for what he's battling and that they're also dealing with as a family. Lord, we ask you to be with them. Minister to them, Lord, for any requests that are on someone's heart this evening, Lord, that didn't get mentioned or maybe they didn't even raise their hand. But the Bible says, you know, even before we ask what we have need of, Lord. So help us never to ask a miss, but just to always, Father, desire and to ask, Father, hoping to be closer to you. And that's what our desire is even this evening. We bring these before you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. Amen.

Seven angels having the seven last plagues. For in them is filled up the wrath of God. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire. &gt;&gt; And then they had gotten the victory of &gt;&gt; and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name. stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of &gt;&gt; that's the song and this word this song is talks about redeemed in the heavens Hallelujah.

Thank you, brother. Lord, &gt;&gt; I remember singing that on the in Israel with brother George and he sings the last song was Hebrew there. I don't even know what it means, but it's pretty cool. Brother George Smith and we got the dancing around the boat, you know, on the Sea of Galilee. It was awesome. So, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. But one other thing uh I wanted to mention before we have brother Tom come. Um now I forgot it. Oh, this weekend I'm not 50 yet. So &gt;&gt; I know I know uh this weekend um there's a couple things. So there's a ministers meeting Saturday morning at 9:30 at Phoenix Tabernacle. I've sent it I think to the ministers and the deacons in the church. You're welcome to come. you you know, brother Aiden, Brother William, Brother John, you brothers who feel you might have gifts in your life, you're welcome. 9:30 at Phoenix Tabernacle. Then at 6 PM at Phoenix Tabernacle is they're doing a one just one night of singing uh Harmony in the Desert. They got it planned late, so it's just going to be one night, 6 p.m. And I know it'd be hard to, you know, go down and come back. We'd like you here for Sunday morning because Brother Isaac Hatfield is going to be here. He's a brother we went to Peru with and so he'll be talking about that and then he'll be ministering for us on Sunday morning. Uh but yeah, However the Lord leads you at 6 PM Saturday night, probably a couple hours there at Phoenix Tabernacle for the singspiration and then then um it's a lot. It's a lot. I know. So, Sunday afternoon at 5 for the you especially for the youth, brother Aaron McGary is having a youth orientated service. He's going to be doing these once a month and told him we would support him so much that we're cancelling our youth service Sunday afternoon. I'm going to support that work there Sunday afternoon at 5 at brother Aaron McGarry and we'll carpool if you guys want um youth to go. We'll we'll make sure you have a ride. So, Brother Hatfield will be speaking. Yeah. So, he's going to have a busy weekend. So, pray for him. He's speaking at the ministers meeting here on Sunday morning and then the youth service. So, it's going to be a lot of back and forth, but Lord knows and he's equipped for it. He's young. He's not 50 yet. So, praise the Lord. Let's all stand. Brother Ryan, that song Brother Tom was singing right before brother Donald was singing right before uh Brother Rolando. Man, I liked it. Sister, bless the Lord. Can we sing that as brother Tom? Maybe we'll start with the chorus and then go to the first verse. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Oh my soul, worship his holy name. Oh, sing before. Oh my soul, I worship the Lord. The sun comes up. It's a new day all. It's time to sing your song again. Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me, let me be Heat. Heat. Worship is holy name. Oh my soul, worship his holy name. Amen. It's good to be in the church house on a Wednesday night. The world offers lots of other places to be, but there is no other place to be for a son or daughter of God. If we could bow our heads, Lord Jesus, as you look down upon your children, Father, we know your mercies are great. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, and this time's been taken. Your children have come out to your house, Lord. We're sheep. We need to be fed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't just want to be fed once a month or we need fed daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, would you get your servant out of the way? Might you speak to your children? Give them something that nourishes them, that encourages them. Lord, prepares us for these next days ahead. Bless your children, Lord. We ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; While we remain standing, if we'd like to open your Bibles, like to turn to Psalm 139. I won't take the time. We're going to begin with just the 14th and 15th verse, but uh I'm looking here in the verses before 14 and 15. There is something. How many have indulged in the past few years watching the chosen? Okay. So, I'm just going to throw this in as I it blessed me as I was reading the entire psalm as I was looking for these two verses 14 and 15. Uh the eighth verse. This is just kind of an extra for you. And see if you remember where this was mentioned in the chosen. If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there. If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. You kind of got a funny look, Caitlyn. Do you remember when that was? When Thomas was so wanting to learn the scriptures and to learn something to catch up with the others. And that was the scripture that Philillip gave him. And it was one of those little nuggets that got pulled out and it's become part of my vocabulary from that because it was so striking uh that even even just for script writers they chose give him that scripture. But coming down to the 14th verse, I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; Marvelous are thy works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that my soul knoweth well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. You may be seated. Curiously, rot. Uh, I don't know how many rot isn't a term that or a word that we normally use. If you look into the language, rot is the past participle for worked. But it's the thing that was built. It was the thing that was created. We were curiously wrought. And when you look into the combining those two words in Hebrew, it's a single term. It basically refers to needle work, crochet, embroidery, weaving. And if you use that, I I want to kind of move our minds to a way of thinking for the scriptures that are coming up after this to think of how we were made. And one of the things that came to mind first when I was reading this because well my grandma, she used to crochet lovely things. The the borders of all of our pillow cases had embro or had crochet around them. Uh all of the little doilies and and covers and everything around her house and henceforth our house were done in my grandma Weber's crochet and it was just taking all and she would kind of free form if she wanted to do designs she knew which knots and which loops and it would make certain shapes. So in her mind &gt;&gt; she had what she wanted to make. and she would maybe take a pattern and then she would adapt it to something else. So if you take that concept how that he looked down at us &gt;&gt; and he curiously wrought us each one of us special each one of us unique for the purpose that he had for it. The other thing that came to mind, Brother Ray, you'll you'll get this, others would, but I know it's something from way in the back. We talked about Navajo rugs. And if you ever looked at those rugs and ever watched one of those weavers, it seems so tedious. There's a rug on the wall at the Cameron Trading Post. It's 12t by 12t. It's a storm pattern, Brother Ray. And the woman who wo it had to know designwise, mathematically wise, how she was going to make over so many over what did they call it? The weapon, the wararf of the two different directions that the the fabric the the yarns go. how she was going to get from down here at this bottom corner &gt;&gt; up to this corner and make everything coincide to create the pattern that she wanted. That is how we were made. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you think &gt;&gt; hundreds and hundreds of hours for this work of love, &gt;&gt; this work of art, this unique creation. That's what we were. You were curiously wrought. Now, in that term, it's and and I kind of belabor the point because our youngsters maybe don't see those hand type crafts before. I'd watch my grandmother for hours just sitting there in her little balls of of crocheting yarn and just working her needles and and doing things over. And I c I could not see what the end product was. Amen. &gt;&gt; All I saw &gt;&gt; was her laboring on it. When you went up to Cameron and the lady Bessie was in the room and she would be weaving every day so that the tourists could see her. You couldn't see the end of the product. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But she could. &gt;&gt; She knew what that last row was going to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; When she was in the bottom rows, &gt;&gt; you were curiously wrought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The term that's used for that. Also the definition is you were intricately curiously rot now intricately and skillfully fashioned like a complex piece of embroidery or tapestry. And tapestry that's something I know absolutely nothing about. And I have seen pictures of those famous tapestries and they will tell stories and and to imagine they started at one end but the entire history that they were trying to tell in one handwoven piece of goods and it all started down here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Detailed by and I loved how that you know this wasn't my choice of words. amazingly detailed by divine skillful weaver or artisan. And the other thing so and the other term that was used outside of weaving and tapestry was embroidery. And now this is something that young people think well embroidery that's like where a company puts their name on a jacket and it's all done with the stitching and it's you know you can go in and you order it and sister Kathy they have the sewing machines and you program it in and you put the yarns in and it just feeds it through and weaves all those different yarns and all the different designs and bingo here's your embroidery. But in the days when this was translated, in the days of of King James when he commissioned those men, they chose these words back then, that was done by hand, one stitch at a time. And when you had to change colors, you had to and and and they spoke of in in reading about embroidery, what a enormous part of the whole process was selection of color. what color was going to be the background, how you were going to come, how that you would fade from one color into another. There's this whole process. You are wonderfully &gt;&gt; and curiously made. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So now from that, I would like to turn over to first Corinthians. I'm sorry. I'm I'm not as adroid with the whole system as brother Steve and and and brother Ryan. There's only going to be two little images that'll be up here tonight and hopefully they will inform you also. Uh first Corinthians 12 and we're going to begin here again at the 14th verse. Now, we're talking about being curiously wrought. Correct. &gt;&gt; The And for those keeping track of this, I'd like to give this a title. &gt;&gt; I am not you. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; It takes us all. &gt;&gt; I am not you. &gt;&gt; It takes us all. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here 1 Corinthians 12:14, for the body is not one member but many. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. The body you I am not you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it takes us all. &gt;&gt; Correct. And I thought if you trying to wrap your head around that whole thought of think of it is there is one team but on that team there are many players. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's football or soccer or basketball or lacrosse. I know nothing of lacrosse. There's different players and they have different parts. That's good. &gt;&gt; And the other part on the team cannot function. The other part member of the team cannot excel. &gt;&gt; They cannot do their utmost for the team unless everybody &gt;&gt; is doing their part for the team. &gt;&gt; And there are members of a team I know football or used to. So I can look at this and John, there were guys on the team that they were the little guys, they were the fast guys, they were the agile guys, and they did not want to go near the scrimmage line. Their job was to avoid it, to get through it, to get around it, however, to go long for that pass, all of that. But then there were other guys that were just these beasts of young men that were made to be right down on the line to move things around. So they aren't all the same and everybody didn't have the intellect of a quarterback or maybe a a free safety to be able to read everything that's going on on the defense. You know, for those defensive linemen, it's just right here. We are curiously wrought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't expect to do someone else's job. &gt;&gt; And other people cannot expect to do your job. &gt;&gt; You have a place. I sit there with my guitar and I'm in awe of Brother Ryan at the piano because of the songs he comes up with. I do my part. He does his part. Brother Donald's up here. Sometimes he'll defer to brother I. I'm wanting you to see this applies to us. This is who we are. This is how this church functions. Uh you can go to a school. There is one school mcclentok mcclentok chargers. Ray hoay. But there's a lot of students, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And there's the students that are the eggheheads. And there are the students that are the athletes. And there are the students. They don't have it now. I don't know, Sister Cavity. If they still have it, but there were the girls that took home ed, a whole block of home ed. And they learned how to make patterns, and they learned how to sew, and they learned how to design things themselves. And there were the girls that were in the secretarial block. I'm just talking from what I know. I'm I'm hoping or imagining there's some equivalent in the schools today. Uh and and and to just talk about how that they're things that are similar, but they're the same. When I was in high school, we had the egghehead geek guys that liked technology. And you know what we called them? Now, first off, what would they call them today in the schools? What would they call those guys? The IT guys. You know, they had their little room with all their equipment and they helped with the IT and the different rooms because that's what their inclination was towards. Well, in the old days, back when they invented rocks, &gt;&gt; us, brother Kurt, they were AV guys. The audiovisisual guys, they were the ones that did the projectors and knew how to thread the film and slide projectors and opaque projectors. They were the audio visual guys. That was high-tech. That was it 55 years ago. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now they're it guys, but they were all made different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; Amen. you go to hear an orchestra. There is one orchestra and it is the Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra, but you have strings, &gt;&gt; you have brass, &gt;&gt; you have percussion, and then you break the strings out and you have the violins and the violas and the bass vials, and you go over to brass and and and besides brass, you've got woodwinds. Don't want to forget you there. Well, you've got the woodwinds, but it's not just a saxophone. There's maybe a couple saxophones and an obo and a bassoon. So, they're all orchestra. &gt;&gt; We are here tonight. We are all body. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; But brother Rolando is a piece. &gt;&gt; Brother Donald is a peace. Brother Don, Sister Darlene are a piece. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we're all Flagstaff Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does the title out there matter? No. But the God we serve matters. &gt;&gt; Uh I'd like to just come down. We're going to read here through in uh 1 Corinthians now uh down to the 27th verse and just kind of comment as we go down through. Want to make sure I don't Yeah. If the foot shall say because I am not the hand, I am not of the body. Is it therefore not of the body? &gt;&gt; Now we know that's that can't be. Now I look at it and I think pictures and stuff a hand is a magnificent thing. What it can do opposable digits. It's something that only the other primates have in their anatomy to be able to grasp something with their hand. So, this hand is so unique and really if you look at pictures of them and stuff, it's such a beautiful thing. And then there's feet. Stinky fungusy feet, you know, and and they're down in, you know, they're either buried in a shoe or a boot or they're down in the dirt all the time. And uh we will talk about how that sometimes we try, it's kind of like making a a sousier into a silk purse. You know, people try to fancy up their feet and they go get their pedicures and things, but that's a whole another topic. But did you know, and brother Chase would know about this, when you go and listen in enlist in the military back during the days of the war, maybe there's other exceptions now, if you had flat feet, &gt;&gt; correct? &gt;&gt; They wouldn't take you. because your feet would not hold up under the strain. You weren't fit to enter battle and they couldn't afford to have you as a liability when you went into battle. Your foot might not be anything special. It might have those gnarly toenails and and all crunched together and all you do is shove it down in that boot, but I want a good foot. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, if you're if you're part of a body, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A good foot is a good thing. &gt;&gt; It gives you stability. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't take much to make that foot compromised. &gt;&gt; For those of you who remember brother Phil Hornac, he uh he got one toe chopped off in an elevator. Long story, but he lost that toe. And he said it took him years. Just a big toe. &gt;&gt; Took him years to get his balance back cuz that one big knuckly looking digit on the end of his foot &gt;&gt; was kind of the anchor. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; To him being able to balance on his foot. So you say, "Oh, all I feel like is a big toe. &gt;&gt; You know, it's nothing good to look at and they just hide me away. Nobody ever sees me cuz I'm just in a boot under a sock and a stinky sock. Nonetheless, boy, I want that toe there. I want it performing like it's supposed to perform. And if the ear shall say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body. Is it therefore not of the body? No, it is. And you can't afford not to have that eye. You can't afford to not have that ear. If the whole body were an eye, Sister Pauline, the eye. If the whole body were an eye. Okay. Where were the hearing? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And if the whole were the hearing, okay, the ear. If the whole thing were an ear, where's the seeing? And those are kind of gross. Made me think of some of those old horror movies, Brother A. That's that would be the movie of the ear. The ear from the black lagoon. &gt;&gt; So, what can that do? What is the benefit of having that hearing? Okay. And if we went back to the eye, what is the benefit? I you know I think of a fly how that they show how a fly's eye is composed that it's looking through basically hundreds of prisms and it looks out but its brain is made to be able to proc that process that and look several hundred degrees all the way around as it flies. But that's not how we're made. that would get in the way of the mouth and that would get in the way of the nose and it would get in the way of the ear. All of the other functions that we rely on. Thank you, sister Pauline. We don't need to be labor that uh there is a place for each part and there is not a redundancy necessary. God made us that way. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now hath God set the members &gt;&gt; members, &gt;&gt; okay, every one of them in the body. And I love this phrase, &gt;&gt; as it hath pleased him. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And you go, "Oh, &gt;&gt; exactly." &gt;&gt; But I'm just an elbow, you know, Aiden. &gt;&gt; But it pleased him. &gt;&gt; That's right. Have you ever been part of something? Uh here again, I'll use a football analogy. I wasn't the biggest. I wasn't the strongest. I wasn't the fastest. But I curried the favor of our head coach. And when I was on the sideline, Brother Kurt, where was I? &gt;&gt; I was right near that coach. So if he called me &gt;&gt; and you know if if you're a musician and you get called on to do what you do uh you know even the AV guys they just sat in their room during that hour every day when they were on the AV staff and they just sat there waiting for some teacher to say we're watching a movie today and I need you to run the projector. You just live for that as it hath pleased him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if there were all one member, where were the body? Now we can say uh what what we say with that is that there is no way for the body to function &gt;&gt; if they were all the same. Now, I'm I'm going to throw out a little bit from Brother Tom because I remember being in school and maybe it was just because it was the 60s and 70s, but everybody wanted to be unique. Everybody wanted to be an individual, you know, we wanted our hair. We, you know, we wanted our look, we wanted our image. When you went down the hall in school, people, you wanted people to know, you know, he's he's got something going for him. And in doing that, we all dressed the same. We all wore bell bottoms. We all wore the same kind of sandals. Uh, you know, now you'd say the kids that are REALLY INDIVIDUAL, THEY ALL DYE their hair green. They all, you know, there is no individually at it. Why not be what God made you? And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee. Nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble. Those little things, those little bits, the little things that cause problems are necessary. They are &gt;&gt; okay from our school students. Can you name the three smallest bones in the human body? Do you know where they're at? Oh, I'm even Sister Dette in the ear. They're in the middle ear. Okay. It is the malus, the incus, and the uh stapus, or as they're commonly known, the hammer, the anvil, and the sturrup. Three tiny little bones on the inside of your middle ear that are connected to the cacia. And when those vibrations come into your ear, those three bones move against each other and that is how the vibrations are transferred into the coccia and that is where we get sound from. Okay? It's like so and they're so tiny and they're hidden away nobody ever sees them. &gt;&gt; But one of them not do their job. If you've ever met somebody who was severely deaf, it's a terrible thing. Those things aren't working like they're supposed to. And so if somebody in this body were an incus, I want them to do their job. &gt;&gt; I need them to do their job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor. &gt;&gt; And our uncumbly parts have more abundant comeliness. For our comely parts have no need, but God hath tempered the body together, &gt;&gt; having given more abundant honor to that part which lackth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That there should be no sism. There should be no division in the body over who's what. The idea is that we all work together and we complement each other and one part makes the other part better. If you're a hunter and the ear's not working, even on a dry day, you aren't going to hear that game coming through the brush. If the eye, the light of the soul, if that's not working, there's nothing to warn you of of trouble coming. You've got to have that eye. There should be no sism in the body, &gt;&gt; but that the members should have the same care one for another. And whether one member suffer, oh, here's where it gets right down personal. Where one member suffer with it &gt;&gt; or one member be honored, &gt;&gt; all members rejoice with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now ye are ye are this is his pronouncement on us. Ye are the body of Christ and members in particular. &gt;&gt; Now I would like to and just here as an aside to if we can quickly turn to numbers 16. This is when dispute came about people not being happy with third part and wondering why somebody else had a different part. Numbers 16:13. And you'll recognize this. Oh, do I have it right? Maybe I wrote. Oh, 16:3. Okay, here's the men that confronted Moses. And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, "Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy." Oh, we're all eyes. We can all see, but there are some that are set for hearing. Every one of them, and the Lord is among them. You take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy. Every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord. Now, lifting up can be done, but sometimes seeing somebody lifted up is imagined because you don't have the place that they've got and you want that place and I'm I'm not above that either. And the Lord has to deal with me and talk to me. But I thought we would finish this evening maybe with uh a little game. Maybe this is something you could even moms and dads you could talk to your children about because I've taken some body parts and I thought if this is the body part who in our body fills it okay so the first thing was the face. Now I also put with the face here the head. Now, we know the Holy Ghost is the head of this body, but if we have a face, there's got to be a head attached. So, they they kind of go together. But let's take the face, and I'm going to say the face of this body is Brother Steve. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Because he is the one that people see. He is the one that people acknowledge when somebody contacts the church and wants to use it for uh a funeral as we just had other things. They don't call brother Aiden even though brother Aiden may be the anvil in the ear and he may be the one that's transmitting the message to the face because it takes both of them. But so let's say brother Steve is the face. Now, this I I even put on there, these are hypothetical assignments. Do with them as you would. Now, here's my chance to pass out a rose. But then, who's the heart? &gt;&gt; Because the heart is always beating &gt;&gt; and you don't always see the heart. You can hear the beat. You can feel the beat. You know it's there and it's serving its purpose. And I'm going to say that's sister Danette &gt;&gt; because she's that life that pushes. And I'm also going to include in that, sorry Dette, you have to share this, but it's with good company. The heart is also the prayer warriors. &gt;&gt; They're the ones that come down to the altar when there is a need and they are earnest. And I will be honest, in the times in my life when I have had the greatest immediate need, I don't know that I ever first called a brother. I called the women, the prayer warriors. I called, and these are names you children, a lot of the adults won't know. Sister Mabel and Sister Glattis and Sister Betty, Sister Judy, they were at home and I knew that as soon as I got off the phone, they were going to be on their knees. &gt;&gt; So I would put them in there as the heart, just that thing, that driving that keeps bringing life to everything. So then let's we're talking about the lesser parts, the ones that are hidden, the ones what who wants to be a liver or a kidney. Well, that's good, brother Ryan, because in my hypothetical assignments, the liver and the kidney are evangelists because they come in. Remember how brother Brandham talked about revival? how it stirs the sea up and there is not a drop more water in that sea when it's in the middle of a storm as when it's over and there is a calm but it has washed all of the debris out and all the debris is on the shore and you don't always see the evangelist and you he's not to always present but when he goes to work it's like that liver and kidney it takes all of the bad stuff out of the blood and it helps process things and it moves around it does its shop and it's gone. Uh I don't know who would you think would be a good uh choice for um I and this with this I lumped the lungs and the stomach and your digestive system together. Okay. Who would who would you think? Now, that's why I'm saying this is uh just hypothetical, but I thought it's the ley. It's the ones that ingest the strength and they digest it and they distribute it amongst themselves, okay? They take in the oxygen into the lungs and they provide the living of this body. They're kind of the vitality of the church. who would be the arms and the hands and I thought you know the h they're kind of the visible active part of the body the you know the part you see the legs are there the feet are there but if you're noting action I would say your eye goes to the the arms and uh and such first and the hands I think it's our young families They're the ones that are out in the community. The kids are out there. They're active. They compel you. Having kids compels you to being part of the activity. You're part of the ball teams and you're part of the choirs and the stuff at the school and everything. That's the part they see. And it's the workings of the body that the people in the community see. So that's why I chose that. And so who would be the legs and the feet? And I thought it's that part established part where the strength is that carries the body that that uh the word would be paramulates moves them around and I would say that is the pillars in our church that is our seniors &gt;&gt; sometimes times they aren't fast, &gt;&gt; but they're always there &gt;&gt; and they bear that weight. And then here's one that and and maybe here's we'll we'll finish with this one little part of a quote to read. Uh I didn't have an idea. I didn't have a anything to suggest. What part of the body did brother Brandham say was the strongest part of the body? shoulders. It's that part of the body and everything has to work with it to bear up those heavy heavy loads. So I you know maybe that's just a a junction of all the parts of the body. I don't know but that would be a good discussion. Who is this body's shoulders? Okay. So, with that, and this was purely unintentional, and brother Ryan has been laboring over presenting, and you still got a third of it left. Uh, Brother Steve had asked him to talk about the word to the church. And I had finished up my notes. I had cleaned them all up. And I thought, "Wow, brother Ryan's been talking about that. I wonder if there's any correlation between the two. So, here's just two paragraphs from the word to the church. You can go out there in the forer, you can read it. But here he's talking about us. He's talking about who you are, your responsibility to one another, your value to the whole. &gt;&gt; And stay with your pastor. See, he's the shepherd and you give him respects. He'll lead you through because he's smart. &gt;&gt; Because he's the face and he's goodlooking. Because he's a good fisherman. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. He'll lead you through and because he's ordained of God to do so. Don't never clan among one or talk make yourself clanish. We are one. &gt;&gt; I couldn't say left hand, left hand, I'm mad at you. I'm going to take you away cuz you're not my right hand. &gt;&gt; I can't say that. He's my left hand. I want him to stay there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even Okay. here. And now we're getting down even to the tip, the little tip of my finger. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Ray and I roofed. You know, when a hammer goes the wrong place, how important the end of that one finger is. Okay? I want to stay right there. Every little part of my body, stay right there. And God wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another. &gt;&gt; Right at with being with one another. &gt;&gt; We're a body. &gt;&gt; We are curiously wrought. &gt;&gt; You are special. There are parts of the body that mature later. Parts of the brain that mature later. The free preffrontal cortex of the brain doesn't mature till a a child is two or three. That's why they don't have spatial relationships. They don't understand time. And sometimes young Christians don't have a spatial relationship. They don't understand time, you know, because it's always when when how soon It's when &gt;&gt; it'll be when I hope it gave you something to to think about. I hope it I hope it gave you some purpose, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To where I don't have to be important, &gt;&gt; but it's kind of nice knowing that if I hold a place, even if it's that one tiny tiny bone in the ear, I'm essential. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could bow our heads. Could we stand? &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we're looking out at a body. Lord, we aren't all here tonight. We know that there are those, Lord, that we're missing tonight. That they're every bit as much a part of this body. And when they're hurting, we're hurting. Lord, I miss my wife. I'm not complete without her. We miss Brother Glenn and Sister Karen. We miss Sister Sakoro. We miss Brother Steven. Lord, and I know I'll miss names, but they're all part of what makes this body complete. They're all part of what makes this body work. &gt;&gt; Amen. and let us faithfully and willingly do our part and be glad that it was by your divine purpose &gt;&gt; that you put us in a place. Put us where Lord the body can benefit. Not just one person, Lord, but for each little job that this body does, each member of this body, they provide a service that the entire body benefits from. Bless your children tonight, Lord. Keep us. Give us the remainder of this week. Might it just be glorious. Might we find ourselves find you working in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Letting us be the best member that we can be. Bless our pastor, Lord. Bless his family. It's a thankless job. We see the good side. We see the face of it all. But it's a tedious, worrisome job. But it's all done out of love because you've made us the way we are. Bless your children now, we ask. Go with us. Keep us safe on the streets around town. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. I really appreciated that. I don't like the part about the face, but I like the rest of it. Brother Tom, &gt;&gt; that's just Yeah, the good fisherman. I like that. Of course, I look at all of you as pillars and shoulders and strong parts. Speaking of strong shoulders, brother Donald, could you dismiss us in a word of prayer? While he's coming, I was thinking of this song. It's I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. Glad I'm a part of the family of God. I've been washing the mountain and cleansed by his blood. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. again. We all share and rejoice in the Yeah. Heat. From the door of the Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. I praise God. Bow our heads dear. Heavenly Father Lord, we just uh thankful for you, heavenly father. Lord, Lord, what a nice remembrance that we're needed, heavenly father. the word that devil tries to tell us that we can make it on our own and we're not an integral part of the body of Christ or that we're not an integral part of this local assembly heavenly fallen Lord but you called each and every one of us Lord to have a place and a purpose to serve you fallen so as the brother mentioned if I just had a little moment here Lord help me drum drum drum to the best of my ability to And Lord, if we're supposed to be doing something else, have the following, Lord, to just help lead and guide each one, Lord, to their position, having the follow they can just be in tune with you, Lord. Whether you're a multi-member body, Lord, there's one orchestra, one conductor of the inside orchestra, they follow, we all want to be looking at you, Lord, and just be in tune to your movements, Lord. Lord, we ask that you would be with each one traveling this weekend. Heavenly Father, Lord, may it just be a a time of fellowship, Lord, a time of rejoicing, Lord, a time to go out and rub shoulders with other Holy Spirit gracious Lord. We're just so grateful for you. Just ask that you go and be with us the rest of this week as far until we meet again in Jesus name. Amen. We can sing that third. Is there a third verse? Maybe God bless you. We're going to see you this weekend. And his wing has a heart. We all share the wej. Heat. Heat. Heat. I know your name. Hallelujah.
