We invite you into our midst. Be a welcome guest among us, Lord. Be with us [music] during this time. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You may be seated, Brother Ryan. I don't want to go too far from that song. I think it's right. I think it's uh but I sure would like somebody to help me to sing it. Brother Steven, how do you feel? As I sat and listened to the words of this song, I I just took a moment and just thought back. This year's been a good year. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm looking forward to the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Didn't happen last year. Maybe it's tomorrow. Maybe it's the next day. But I'm still looking.

What a wonderful, wonderful story I have. I'm clean, Brandon. Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; I I'm clean. I can't tell you any other difference. Way, brother Samuel. I'm clean. &gt;&gt; Nothing by myself. That's the beauty of it. &gt;&gt; It's because he chose me. I cannot fall. I will not fall. I'll stumble, but I'll get back up because I'm a child. He has paid in full by the blood of the lamb. Amen. [singing] Amen. [music] Oh, [singing and music] and by the blood of the lamb. Oh, free from [music] sin. Free to [singing] live. Now I am. Oh, it reads on the page [singing and music] where my sins were written. down made it full by the blood of the lamb. When just call meant of sin, no one worthy [music] could be found among him. But the precious son of God with the cross and thorny crown paid my debt with the blood of the lamb. [singing] Oh paid in full by the blood of the lamb. Free from sin. Free [singing] to live. Now I am [singing] [music] [music] [music and singing] [singing] [music] Yeah. Heat. [music] [singing] Oh, [music] [music] [singing] heat, heat. [music] [singing] Yeah. [music] Heat. [singing] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] I am [music] on the face where my blood from the lamb hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, brother Stephen. I guess I'm just as if you can see the smile on my face. I write down songs here, but I have no idea really. I haven't s them through. And then when I sing them, I think, "Oh, Sister Laura, this is exactly what I need." Lord Jesus knew us. Amen. We have a number of requests tonight. So, we're going to just enjoy the times. Sister Evelyn, Sister Liberty, you have a song. So, if you would come. Amen. Amen. Amen. You know, um, little bit of tidbit of nuggets. Have you ever wondered how can I tell somebody that I'm saved? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham answers this question. So, I'm not saved today because I can shout. I'm not saved because I can feel like I'm saved. I'm saved because I met God's condition of this Bible. Jesus said, "He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everl everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death to life." I believe that. That's right. And on then conditions, I'm saved. &gt;&gt; And because God said so, [laughter] &gt;&gt; I believe it. God said it, that's good enough by me. Amen. Amen. [music] Where's [music] the light? &gt;&gt; Sure. [singing and music] She [music] as to me she's [music] in the house. Death [singing] has to flee. Now there is life where darkness used to be. Now there is hope. There's no [singing] more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his name. He's in the house. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We were [singing] like that little girl dead in all our sins till Jesus touched this heart of mine and gave me life again. I am just a house of clay. But ever since that blessed day, there's a light that shines in me for all the world to see. [singing] He's in our house. [screaming] Death has to flee. Now there is light where darkness used to be. [singing] Now there is hope. There's no more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his name. He's in the house. New flee. Now there is [screaming] life where darkness used to be. [singing] Now there is hope. There's no more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his name. He's in the house. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a good way to do it. I thought we'll have a song and then we might have one of our brothers come up and say something. Mitchell's trying to act like I don't see him back there. It's like directly in line. Brother Mitchell, you can't even hide. I looked at Brandon and he said, "Have Mitchell go first." So, I just thought we'll give the brothers maybe five or 10 minutes. Share a scripture. Share what's on your heart. As deacon, if you want to correct anything in the church, go for it. You know, &gt;&gt; well, you know, I mean, they are the policemen of the church. So, praise the Lord. And then we'll uh Anyone have a testimony while Mitchell's getting nervous? We got to get him to the Sister Pauline. We got to get him to the just a peak of nervousness. That way he'll get out of the way and the Lord could use him. &gt;&gt; Um just wanted to give a praise report about my uh my stepdad Mike. Um he went to surgery and um he had his follow-up appointment and he is cancer free. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right, brother Mitchell. &gt;&gt; Um, God bless you guys. I just first uh want to tell you it's been a privilege to serve with you guys this past year next to each one of you guys and through the ups and the downs and just is you guys are family to me and it's been a real privilege to serve with you guys and we love you. I love you. My family loves you all and um yeah just wanted to say that uh how much I appreciate each and every one of you. Um so it's communion. And so I'm going to just say a brief part of a scripture of that you're already going to that you're already going to say. Um this is a about footwashing St. John 13 uh vers uh 16. Not going to read the whole thing because brother Steve will will get it uh here in a few minutes. Um, I'm just going to read. Uh, verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his lord, neither he that has sent greater than he that has sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. Talking about footwashing. Happy are ye if you do them. And uh I always remember brother Jim always saying that &gt;&gt; if you're not happy, take communion. And I'm not here to preach to anybody about taking communion. It's just one of those things by tonight, you know, just ask a few questions here. Does anybody here battle with fear? &gt;&gt; Maybe a temper. I mean, I could raise my hand to all these. Um, I mean, honestly, it's fill in the blank. And mine's not one blank. There's a lot of blanks that you could fill in with things I battle with. Anxiety, depression, and brother Steve talked about on Sunday. It was actually a scripture Brother Brandon talked about about uh how the devil attacks us so much with these things, anxiety, depression, that it steals your joy, &gt;&gt; your happiness. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that hit me really hard on Sunday on uh some of these things. Not not that I would say I have my moments of fighting all these things. I'm not saying I'm in some deep depression or anything like that, but the devil has a way of getting to each of us over those things. And uh you know by faith tonight I'm just going to not that I didn't before but in my communion tonight I'm just going to stand by faith tonight &gt;&gt; that it's happy if you do this. So I'm just going to stand by faith and be happy that I'm taking this taking communion tonight. Not that this one is you know what maybe it is. maybe this one will be different and that not that I'm not happy but you know that it's fresh like when I was a new Christian you know that's what I'm looking forward to for this year the sooncoming of the Lord and I want to be joyful about it I'm tired of the devil beating me down beating us down over these things and we have nothing to just happy are ye in him so um and just like sister Liz said on Sunday too before his song, "I just want to give the devil a kick in his mouth." And um that's all I could say is just by faith tonight and I I want you guys to do it with me by faith tonight to claim that happy are you if you do this. So, and please, I'm not taking it as if you don't feel like you need to take communion, that's not what I mean by it at all, but the scriptures do say that happy are you if you do this. So, That's where I'm at tonight. Just a quick little word about that. And I like I said, I do appreciate appreciate you guys and I'm looking forward to another year serving with you and, you know, another year of, you know, the sooner sooner to coming home. So, Lord bless you guys. Thank you, [applause] &gt;&gt; brother Ryan. Just before we have our next uh special the little chorus um You are my hiding place. You're my hiding place. My hiding place. [singing] You always feel our heart deliverance [music] whenever I am afraid. [music] [singing] I will trust in you. [singing] I will trust in you. [music] Let [singing] the we say I [music] am strong [singing] in the strength [music] of God. [singing] I will trust in you [singing] once again. You are my [singing] name. [music] You are always [singing] fill my [music] heart with song of deliverance. [music] [singing] Whenever I am afraid, I will trust [singing] in [music] you. Lord, [music] I'll trust in [singing] you. [music] Let the weak say I am and strong in [singing and music] the strength of the Lord. I will trust in you. [music and singing] Yes, we will. Amen. God help us. Brother will, would you make ready at this time as he's making ready to sing a special pleased with the Lord? I trust that he's pleased with me. Not that for any other reason except that I'm like David. I know where my strength's coming from. And when I fall down, Brother Samuel, I'm telling you, I know how to get back up. Yeah, you may see me kick around in the dust a little bit. But because I'm a son of God, &gt;&gt; I get back up. &gt;&gt; And that's what we each want to do. Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Yeah. Who thought I'd find you at the lowest place? Who thought you'd fill me in the crowd? Who knew you'd make good my mistakes? You're nothing like I thought [singing] you were. You're better. What a god. What a god. What a god. What a god. I [singing] thought [music] you'd show up for perfection. Cuz what [singing] kind of God looks for the lost? [music] They say it's over for a sinner, but you say, "No, it's not. No, it's not." [singing] What a God. What a God. [music] What a God. What a God. [singing] If the highest place I reaches at your feet, then I've done it all. If the best thing that I see is your glory, then I've seen it all. Your love has changed my [singing] life. Forever satisfied. God, you are my everything. [music] If one [singing] word is the only thing you speak, then I've heard it all. If you feel your heart and never [singing and music] see your hand, I still have it all. No treasure of this life could ever satisfy God. You are my everything. If the highest place I [singing and music] reach is at your feet, then I've done it all. If the best thing that I've seen is your [singing] glory, then I've seen it all. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Your love has changed [singing] my life. Forever satisfied. God, you are my [singing] everything. God, you are my everything and I will bless [singing] the Lord. Oh my soul and [music and singing] all that is within [singing and music] me. And I will bless the Lord. Oh my [singing] soul and all that [singing] is within me. Bless his [singing] holy name. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Brandon, &gt;&gt; Brother Mitchell left a few minutes out there, too. And then Chase said you could have a few of his. So, so take your time. Praise the Lord. Oh, yeah. Did your family have a song, too? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You could do that after that then. How's that? &gt;&gt; This was kind of a sucker punch. &gt;&gt; No. Oh man, you know, it's uh you know, it's a good sermon on Sunday when you you dwell on it all week. &gt;&gt; It's good eagle meat, Stephen. I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; I just been gnawing on it all day, &gt;&gt; all week. You know that that fear, you know, you you could type it to the natural, especially me when I was younger. I remember I was you can ask my mother I was so fearful right don't she basically had to kick me and force me to do everything and boy when you got over that fear the joy I mean I remember one time we were out it was a water slide or we were at a water park and my mom I she threw me up over her shoulder took me all up then I'm kicking and screaming and throwing fits and she's like you're going to have fun like you know throwing a fish sat me in the tube kicked me down deal and first thing you knew I'm laughing and giggling and having I got there and I end up doing it uh 10 more I thought about that I said that's that's the fear you get over that fear that joy comes over you it's like &gt;&gt; man you know and so I I've had the privilege of you know uh reading in Samuel about David so it made me think and I told Brian just made me think about as there was a scene I've been watching uh made me think of uh Dave going down to the river, you know, when brother Brandham says he's walking down there and he was down, right? He's picking up those &gt;&gt; five stones, Jesus s, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; F ai t h, right? &gt;&gt; And he gets up. &gt;&gt; You know, and he, you know, his brother comes up to you and says, "Aren't you scared?" He's like, "Yeah, I'm scared. I'm scared, but I'm not going to let him defile &gt;&gt; our kingdom." He went out there with one stone and slayed him, &gt;&gt; you know. And I just made me think of that. It's like, you know, David, we all know, was man after God's own heart, but he he had more troubles, more mistakes, more than anybody, you know. So, I just kind of was scrolling through my Bible and I was like, you know, I'm just had my Bible, you know, this one I keep in my truck and I have another one at home and I was flipping through where I was reading and I had this highlighted when I highlighted I don't know. It says, "Only the fear, only fear the Lord and serve him in truth with all your heart, for consider how great things he hath done for you." &gt;&gt; Man, 2025, where' to go &gt;&gt; like that? But, you know, I have so much to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for this church. You know, I'm thankful for y'all family, man. I I'm like Donald. I'm an open book. You know, you see what you get with me. You know, love y'all. And I love my pastor. You know, not afraid. I love it when he preaches grace. And I love it when he gets the whip out. You know, sometimes you got to get the whip out. And I wanted to tell my pastor, I'm in the boat. &gt;&gt; I want to get in the boat. &gt;&gt; And just uh love you all. Appreciate you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. You want to see? Praise the Lord. While they're making ready, who would have a thought or a testimony, a scripture? I saw Sister Kathleen. Be you, Sister Dette. I'll pay for that one later. Since you said a thought, then I I guess I can share it. But um I know I'm going to share it real quick again because I don't know if everybody heard it, but when I when I got my my port out, it was like the final stage of my cancer. It felt like, you know, like the final surgery. And the lady had told Tim he could put music on and he put um Christian radio and the song Scars came on. I know I shared it with probably most of you have heard it but the song was just beautiful because it was I'm thankful for the scars because they showed me who you are. Um you know and I'm just crying. But then I listen I've listened to the song over and over and there later on in this song it says um through your hands through your feet I found my victory and it touched me so much because of you guys that's where I found my victory. You guys carried me through it unbelievably and I I think my thought when you said that is it so um struck me to bear one another's burdens and I just wanted to encourage everyone to share our burdens with one another and lift each other up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, sister. May the [singing] Lord grant you peace. May [singing] his love shine down. Love shine down and meet [singing] your every need and keep your feet from stumbling. And fix your eyes on the mark on the prize. As you go, may you rest in Christ. Receive [music] his grace to love all men [singing] in spite of all our differences. May [singing] your words be filled with life that crumble walls of [music] fear and pride. Take [singing] up the cross to serve the least [singing] [music] and the lost. As you go, [singing] [music] be the hands of God. &gt;&gt; Cuz he [singing] is your [music] strength and your victory. [music and singing] He [singing] comes [music] behind you. You [singing] and [music] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; and the portion your banner and shield. [music] [singing] So be [music and singing] released, be [singing] blessed, be free. Live and move as the [music and singing] spirit breathes. &gt;&gt; As you go, go with God. [snorts] Go in peace. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, a little the little song as I sat and Lord be pleased more than ever before. Lord, I love you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sat and looked at young Bailey and I thought, Lord, I wish maybe done a little bit better when I was that age. And I thought, but you made me the way I was, and you let me walk the way I did. Maybe it's for the purpose of looking at that young one and praying for her. Sister Liz, you've got children coming up. And if the Lord carries you young girls, the young [music] women in the back, Samuel, you're going to be walking this way. And this song that more than ever before Lord I love you will become your song also. So we [music] can sing this again as we'll sing this song more than ever before. Amen. &gt;&gt; More [music and singing] than ever before. Lord, I [singing] love you more than ever [music and singing] before. Lord, [singing] I need [music] you more [singing] than ever before. I want you [singing and music] to I [music] love [singing] before. I loved you then. [music] I love [singing] you now. much more now than yet [music] in [singing] the end between I found. You became [singing and music] my dearest friend and you be [singing and music] to me to be [singing and music] and along the way I would have to say I lean [singing and music] upon you more and more and more than ever [music] before. Lord, I love you more than [singing and music] ever before. Lord, [singing] I need [music] you more than ever before. I want you to [music] [singing] I love you more [music] than ever before. [music] You know the truth that [singing] you are [music] worth [music and singing] for all the time that I have [music] s [singing] your presence [music] I adore. Oh, [music] every [singing] sing [music] and more than ever before, Lord, [music and singing] I love you more [singing and music] than ever before. Lord, I need [music] you more than [singing] ever before. I want [singing and music] to tell you I love [music] you now forever before. Brother Chase will have you come up next after brother Olongo sing. I asked him if he wanted to say anything. He says, "Can I play a couple Pentecostal songs?" So, but I've also noticed with Brother Rolando, he [music] plays what's on his heart. So, praise the Lord. another testimony while we're standing by. Sister Dette. So, I have an ear infection or as they say, I have an ear infection. And earlier today, tmi, sorry, my ear was bleeding and I just was really feeling rough and I almost stayed home and my husband even told me to stay home, but I came and &gt;&gt; it's amazing what the Lord, the presence of the Lord can do. I just feel so good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord I'm here with you on this. Christmas this year my family. &gt;&gt; This year you all are my family &gt;&gt; and thank the Lord this year began very well. We saw the baptism. I'm happy for that. That's called revival. The prophet said, "Souls come to Christ. That's revival." &gt;&gt; And we're inviting the Spanish brothers &gt;&gt; in January. By faith they're going to &gt;&gt; This song is called Oh goodness So infinite. Christo meal. Hello. I love Mother. Messi [music] as a sam. Oh sh again. for well Father again Oh, I s &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I saw some of you start heading for the door because you thought it was take the name of Jesus with you. It's completely different words in Spanish. Completely different. Ask Sister Naomi if you don't believe me. but it has the same tone and it's beautiful. It's really a salvation song. Um the one verse was like your sins are like scarlet but Christ the saving grace is able to change the soul. So it's really a beautiful u really quite a beautiful song. Brother Chase, praise the Lord. while he's coming. Any other thoughts or brother Brandon and appreciated that what you had to say also, brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank the Lord for brother Neil Ignis healing. Had been in a battle there and his body is recovering but Lord's touched him. So thank the Lord. I don't know if uh [sighs] Brandon took any of those minutes. I don't know if uh I feel too good. I was I won't lie to you. I was a little excited when you came up and we're going to move past the service and I wasn't going to have to say anything. But um it's always an honor to be here and it's not that I don't have anything to say, it's that I don't want to say something from me. Um, and I I if I can do nothing else, at least I can praise the Lord and just say thank you for everything that he's done. &gt;&gt; Uh, this year's been a hard year. It's been a hard year. It hasn't been a bad year. It's been a hard year. &gt;&gt; That's um [snorts] but in those difficulties, he's proven himself over and over and over again. And that's why I can stand here and be so grateful to just be with you all. Uh, brother Rolando, uh, if you don't know the saying of, uh, blood [snorts] is thicker than water, the actual saying is blood of the battle is thicker than the water of the womb. And so, how much closer are we when we're both, we're under the same blood, &gt;&gt; we're family, &gt;&gt; and we're all in this battle together. So, we are family and we're as close as we can get either side. Um, and that's how I feel honestly. Um, you may not know it, but you all get me through a lot just in a normal week getting to come here and just get a handshake from all of you. I get the honor to shake hands with almost every one of you every Sunday and that's a real blessing to me and um, don't [snorts] take that lightly. uh you know coming up here on all days I uh I think I had a little bit more warning than Brandon and Mitchell. Mitchell found out sitting on Sunday. Brother Steve let me know a little bit earlier but it didn't really help me any and my mind has been kind of all over the place and not knowing exactly what he wanted me to say and I still don't honestly. So when I come up here and he says, "Think not what you're going to say." And that's what I'm leaning on. &gt;&gt; Um, [snorts] you know, I was reading in Exodus and strangest things hit you and uh Moses is going up and it's the plague of the frogs and Pharaoh comes to him and says, "Hey, can you just send him away? Can you do that?" And he says, "All right, we'll do it and we all let you go." And Moses goes and does that. And when Pharaoh, he says, when Pharaoh sees a respit, then his heart hardens, &gt;&gt; you know, he turns away and you think, oh, I look at my own life and um these past years, as I said, it's been difficult, but but it's kept me pressuring forward. &gt;&gt; You know, that's kept me pushing, kept me close. &gt;&gt; And I I can look back on my own life when I when I get those respits. I I can identify a little too much with Pharaoh in that when I I think, okay, I can I can relax a little bit. I can let up a little bit. And I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that moving into this next year. I believe the Lord will give us rest. If you've been having a hard time, he'll give you rest, but he'll give you what you need. But that's not the time to just let go. That's the time to recover. It's the time to sharpen your sword, boss up your shield, make sure everything fits right. So if you find that time, whether it's now, whether you've been going through something like that and maybe you have something coming up, don't waste that time. That's not a time to just let everything go and let dust get on your weapons and &gt;&gt; to just let everything go. It's &gt;&gt; it's time to be ready for the next thing. &gt;&gt; Devil's taken some swing with this little body this past year, these past couple years, and we've had some hard corrections. But when I see those things, I don't take those as bad things. I take those as good signs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as an enemy in war, you're not going to attack somebody who's not dangerous to you. There's no benefit. Only if you have something to gain. So if he's coming at you, and whether you take that personally or this little body, he's he's watching out at you. Says if he's coming after you, it means he hasn't gotten you yet. And if he's coming at us this year or last year or as it goes, we're dangerous to him. &gt;&gt; And we should be. We should be. Brother Brandham, he's talking in um the countdown and he says that the natural always ties the spiritual and he was talking about the space age that was happening around then. This was 1962. We landed on the moon. somewhere around 1969, something like that. And it kind of tapered off a little bit. It wasn't the same type of push, the same type of investment. But he says that's he used it exactly that you can look at our own times. &gt;&gt; We're ramping up, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that's not the natural leading the spiritual, that's the natural following the spiritual. That means God is on the move. &gt;&gt; This is our time. And those are our warning signals. Those are our things to let us know. &gt;&gt; It's time to get in the boat. &gt;&gt; It's not time to stray away. It's not time to look away. &gt;&gt; And [snorts] he's going to offer you, the devil's going to offer you everything he can. He's going to offer every little thing and be a distraction. He may take the pressure off of you and offer you a little bit of something just to pull you away. &gt;&gt; It's not time to get out of the boat at all. It's not time to take our eyes off of the prize. it's time to get in the spaceship. And he says, "That's not driven by us. &gt;&gt; We don't need to do anything." He says, "That's radar driven." He says, "That's remote. There's a tower. There's a power. &gt;&gt; It's our job to just get in and be ready. [snorts] I don't want to let up. I want to see where we can go. I want to see not what we can do. I want to see what he could do. &gt;&gt; And I'll be the thing that gets in his way if I take my eyes off him. This little body is wonderful. &gt;&gt; This little body is amazing &gt;&gt; and I'm so thankful that I get to be a part of it. I wish I could express the amount of blessings that the Lord has. You probably all know there's so many gifts and blessings that the body has in everyone. Some you see, some you don't, but they're all there. We all get to pull an or a little bit differently, sit in a different position. So if we keep pressing and as we end this year and we let it die, we don't be afraid of that death. &gt;&gt; Jesus's whole life was marching to death. &gt;&gt; And we are called to be Christlike. That was his purpose in life. He did wonderful, amazing things, but he came here to die. &gt;&gt; We're called to die, too. &gt;&gt; Don't try and fight it. Go towards it. &gt;&gt; It's the only way through. Hopefully that made some sort of sense and brother Steve and everyone here just appreciate the steadiness. Something I can keep my eyes on here when I get pulled when I fall. I fall a lot and lets me know it's okay. I see my dad fall and he gets up and so all we're doing and brother Steve thankfully I need it all the time is fall down seven times and I get up again. &gt;&gt; There's no end there. It's just get up. Bless you all as we move into this next year. And I don't believe it's a waste and it doesn't mean anything. I believe there's some purpose of a demarcation of a past year and a new year. Something some new challenge, some new blessing. So, I look forward to seeing more strength. I look forward to seeing what the Lord does through all of you because it's it's just a testimony to me. It's a testimony to see the growth. It's just a blessing. God bless you all. the girls. Okay, praise the Lord. We do have one more special. The young sisters be singing and we but we also have a few more and I'm not leaving out brother Tom and brother Ryan. These brothers speak more than the other brothers. Brother Ryan will be speaking next Wednesday and brother Tom not long after that. So, I'm looking at brother Donnie. You don't even have to come up here. Brother Donnie, do you have any wisdom? You have any scriptures that are on your mind or any thoughts? I got brother Chase sneaking up behind you. &gt;&gt; He's coming with a mic. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, I'm almost 60. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I heard an amen. &gt;&gt; And I was remembering when I was little, my grandfather before he died, he wrote a letter to my sister and I and he said to read every day the 119th Psalm. And I've told a few of you when I first looked at it was about a 20 minute read. And I thought, man, that's a lot every day. And as a young kid, I tried. You'd start with the first eight stanzas because they read them in sections of eight. I never got past that first. It's called ALF. The first couple words is blessed are the undefiled in the way. And it took me nearly 60 years to figure that out. &gt;&gt; And as I listen tonight, you hear the foolishness of preaching the the living of that life, the articulating in the best way we can, Brandon. Sounds broken, sounds fallible, sounds human. But we are blessed, happy, perfect, undefiled. &gt;&gt; True &gt;&gt; because we walk in this something called the way. &gt;&gt; And I never knew what that was. And it's taken me nearly 60 years to figure out. It's just the step. It's just the getting up. It's just the trust that being here tonight is the answer. the that weaving of the gospel that we've spread tonight &gt;&gt; through testimony and word and fallibility. And the that's so great that in our weakness is that strength. &gt;&gt; So we submit to that. I do tonight. Forgive me. &gt;&gt; If there's wisdom in that, I don't know, &gt;&gt; but it's all I know. So, I put my life in that. And I too thank you for allowing me to be a part of you. Family isn't a big enough word. I see Chase's attempt at trying to save it, but you can't. But I'll give to you what I can until I can no longer do so. That's all I got. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's perfect. [applause] Brother Kurt, Brother Kurt, that um the one that Brother Mitchell read, "Happy are ye if you do these things." My Scoffield Bible references James 1:25. It says, "But who so lookketh into the perfect law of liberty and contin therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed." And that's related to John 13 and what I think you said, brother Donnie. Go ahead, brother Kurt. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Just just a couple couple things. Uh that me or is that whatever? Um you know I was reading recently and I've known this for a few years. There's certain kind of fruit, certain kind of vine plants like grape and watermelon, cantaloupe, things like that. And before they harvest it, they withhold water. And by withholding water, it puts it under stress. And under stress, it becomes sweeter. They actually do that on purpose. It's pretty smart. There's no mistakes in our lives. &gt;&gt; That's how he produces gold. I thought that was and I wanted to share a little something that our Eleer said just he said this uh from a super sense and I keep this in my Bible to remind me because I need reminding. He said And after making my own consecration and after making having the church to do so. Now if God blessed us this way he has in the last few meetings with that little consecration. &gt;&gt; What will he do if we keep it up? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; See just keep it up. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we stop. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We stop. And the power that's supposed to be here. I'm talking about the ley. We're not talking about the ministry. These guys pour out their hearts like I've never seen. These guys really pour it all out. But I think in the ley we stop. It's a mistake and you just keep doing it. It's not a a magic wand. It becomes a life. &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden the ley is doing what they're doing but we're just doing it here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If there's a shortcoming it's in the ley. My my personal opinion because I've I live this shortcoming also. But I also hear what Eleazar is saying. Malachi 4 and it takes you right to Isaac. &gt;&gt; It takes you right to Isaac. You just keep doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to feel it. You just keep doing it. And it's true. &gt;&gt; And one more thing just real quick. I had a brother here years ago. This kind of ties in with what Mitchell was saying and brother Bob Bedair taught me something. You won't find in the quotes probably find in the UPC church but I tell you what I found it in my life. And he said this. He said, "The way you spell joy is Jesus, others, and you." So you put God first, then you put someone else in front of you. Even if you're hurting, put someone else when you're hurting, put someone else in front of you, and then you come last. Joy, Jesus, others, and you. And that's what Mitchell was saying. See, when you're serving, that's when you're happiest. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; When you're Giving is when you're happiestmen, &gt;&gt; not when you're receiving. And so it becomes who you are if you keep doing it. It's a discipline. You just keep doing it. And it'll be exactly like he said. It just takes you higher, higher, higher, and you get smaller, smaller, smaller. That's not bad. It's probably just right. [laughter] So, oh, and one more And I'm really sorry. I know. But uh I had the privilege of sitting in a a Sunday school and Don, brother Donnie was teaching the uh I call them young adults. And he was talking about, you know, Brother Bram, a real Christian, reads his Bible and prays every day. You guys don't let that throw you. Just do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a big mystery. &gt;&gt; You just do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he wrote up there reading and he was exhorting the the young adults when you read just don't read it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; just don't read it I think I told Donnie I said well you know his presence comes when before I read I rededicate my life to him &gt;&gt; before I open it up God here am It's like inviting him a welcoming spirit &gt;&gt; and it never fails. I give of myself before I read. Before I pray, I give of myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's the prize. Then he makes the reading and the prayer life move. That was really good, Diana. That inspired me. And that's right. That's what I thought. That's it. I'll just keep reconsecrating myself to him before I do things. It'll live you guys. It'll take us right to Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Kurt. Very good. I was thinking of that quote. I think it's the Thotyron church age where brother Brandham says when when the list of martyrs grew longer and longer. When the enemy attempts to thwart your service, our response is increased service. So that's good. Um, Sister Pauline, I actually had a a PowerPoint, believe it or not. I have three quotes and a question. Let's just put the first slide up there. Then we're going to let Sister Maddie answer the question. There's no wrong answer, by the way. No wrong. Well, there I mean, you could say something really offthe-wall, but there's no wrong answer. Your dad didn't turn your microphone on. So when you get home, sit him down in the chair. Look him in the eye. No. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Uh to fellowship and dedicate the year to the Lord together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Very good. Sister Mary, do you want to Try it. &gt;&gt; I'd say it's a good way to start off your year. I mean, the Lord is with you wherever, but I think being in church and taking communion is really good way to dedicate the year to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Perfect. But Hannah and sisters want a shot. &gt;&gt; Nice. Nice one, Hannah. Very good. I was basically going to say what Maddie and Mary already said. Starting it off right. &gt;&gt; Starting the year off right. Brother Aiden, I don't want to repeat, but yeah, I think there's probably not really anything better we can be doing. You know, there's a lot of people out there. You know, we could be partying or drinking somewhere. But I think communing with God and giving testimonies and praising him is a good way to honor the past year and to uh look forward to his blessings in the coming year. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Yeah, William. &gt;&gt; I like what Aiden said about not just dedicating the next year, but also ending this year off, right? There's a lot of things we could be doing, drinking and well, we are drinking, but not, you know, &gt;&gt; but I like I like dedicating this year to the Lord and also showing him that I'm thankful for the last year and has kept me safe and kept me in the right mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. John, &gt;&gt; yeah, I kind of have the same idea goes with [snorts] be in the world but not part of it. kind of &gt;&gt; just showing our dedication to the Lord being out here at midnight and you know kind of helps our spirit start off the year right. &gt;&gt; Good. Very good. Brady might give brother Sam about 30 seconds warning. &gt;&gt; Probably just uh start off the year with a good Christf fil year just uh keep it a good year. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just can't reiterate it enough to end the year giving thanks for I mean what an amazing year that you gave us and to start our new year out right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't want to leave any of the other brothers or sisters out if they had a contribution. Was there Was there a hand over here? Austin, blame that on Sister Dette, we'll have the sisters make ready. They can make ready at this time. I think to just start off the year right and end the year good and give thanks for the good year that God gave us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Very good. Could you pull up that quote, Sister Paul? And I can't read it on here. I want to read these just before they sing. Brother Ram said, "It means that next Sunday, God willing, we're going to have a service here that's just [music] before New Year's Eve. if the Lord be pleased with us to have this service and we want to have a morning service prayer for the sick and perhaps a baptismal service then I thought I don't have it up here sorry it's There it is. Okay. Then I thought advertise it out to our friends that they could come in. Then we'll have a Sunday morning and Sunday night and then have the people want to stay over for New Year's. Then we have going to have a watch. This time there will be several ministers here. We'll be speaking New Year's night plum until midnight. We invite such ministers come and speak. Lord willing. I want to be one of them that has something to say on New Year's night. He says, "I read a little article in the paper the other day where an old man, he was both deaf, dumb, and blind. He went to Sunday school every Sunday. And they asked him by braille. Said, where do you go to church? Why do you go to church? Can't hear what the preacher said. Can't hear none of the songs. Why do you go to church?" And he said, "I just want to let everybody know what side I'm on. Just want to let the devil and everybody else know that he what side he was on." I think that's good. Imagine if you couldn't even hear, you're blind. And at least just let him know what side you're on. I thought that was real good. Praise the Lord. Well, I guess you're bringing us into the new year, so go ahead. God bless you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Why would I worry giants calling my [singing and music] name? &gt;&gt; Amen. My God, [singing] so [music] much anger troubles. &gt;&gt; [singing and music] &gt;&gt; I hunger power which is more [singing] so much [singing and music] better than all of these things. I won't [singing] be shen. I won't be moved. My God is faithful. His [singing] promise is true. So I'll speak to the mountains. Oh, it's time to move. [music] Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. [singing] [music] My enies scatter. They know that [music] [singing] [music] I [singing] got stronger the way you are. My reason [music] [singing] my God [singing] [screaming] [music and singing] so I won't be I won't be. [singing] [music] My God is faithful. [singing] His promise is true. [music] I'll sing [singing] to the mountain. Oh, it's [singing] time to move. [music] Cuz my [singing] God is bigger, better, stronger, [music] greater than you. [singing] [music] There's no mountain [singing] to [music] high, no valley to. There's no fear that I [singing] have. He doesn't already know. [music] There's no problem to [singing] be. There's no weapon too strong. There is nothing [music] for that's impossible. [singing] There's no mountain to [music] no value to there's no [singing] fear that I have.

[music] I to [music] my [singing] God is bigger better stronger [music] bigger better stronger bigger better stronger [singing and music] bigger I will be let's all stand shy [music] [music] [singing] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [bell] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; My God is bigger and stronger. [music] Amen. Praise the Lord. [applause] It's a new year. Amen. Praise the Lord. come at this time and we'll pray and we'll read scripture. While we're standing, I guess we'll read the scripture in Corinthians 1 Corinthians 11. We'll start with verse 23. Paul says,"For I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." After the same manner also, he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tarry one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together unto condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. Praise the Lord. Let's just while we're standing, we'll have a prayer and break the bread in remembrance of our Lord showing as he told us in the Gospels there. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, once again, and how we have appreciated your presence this evening, Lord, even from the beginning, as Sister Dette testified, Lord, we could feel your presence and how you through that presence brought healing just not only to our bodies, Lord, just healing to our minds and you put us in a right spirit to receive &gt;&gt; all the things that you would have for us this evening, Lord. We recognized your presence from the very beginning. We acknowledge you here with us and we've been thank you for being here with us, Lord. As this bread is broken in my hands, Lord, it's a figure and a type, Father. We understand in the scriptures of your body, Lord, and you taught us to do this. And oh, God, we stand before you unworthily, Lord. There's a worthiness that comes through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that we accept, Father, in this moment for each one. We thank you for forgiveness of our sins, Lord. We confess them before you once again, Lord. And we'd ask you to help us, Father, as we come in this new year as the very first act that we're doing this year, Lord, is to break bread not only with each other, but most importantly with you and to enter in into that sweet communion and that sweet fellowship with you as we begin this year 2026. Lord, it's impossible to even comprehend that we got here, [snorts] that we're here, but we are here, Lord. and we remain until you come. And may we as this year goes forward, Lord, may we consecrate ourselves more to you and dedicate our lives more and realize that we each want to have a part and a ministry and something to do for you. And we're all important, Lord. We ask you to be with us and help us. Bless this time, Father. Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. I thought it was neat that brother Isaac read John 13 on Sunday evening. Of course Mitchell read it just a few minutes ago. It's the scripture we use for foot washing, serving others, act of humility, making yourself the lowest. Many different types. About a month ago, I felt impressed to put a jack in the bed of my truck. Sometimes I have it in there and I took it out a while ago and I thought, really, I'm going to put a jack in the back of my truck. And it was there for about a month. Forgotten about it. And then yesterday, a brother, one of my relatives asked me to follow him to a tire shop. And I got to where his car was, and his tire was in no shape to move an inch more or less to be followed. And I began to change it with the jack he had in his car, and it wasn't enough. And then I remembered I had a jack in the back of my truck. Been there for a month. I didn't know why I put it there. So those things um where you serve [snorts] others. Sometimes God gives you a premonition, a head start, a tool to help you serve someone else. And you never know why it's there or what. You might not know what you're doing. You might have an impression. You might put it in there. Then you might take it out. You might put it in again. and you might not know what you're doing and God has a purpose and um I don't know just felt led to tell you that washing feet and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself. After that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter? Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou hast hast no part with me." Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, he that is washed needeth not, save to wash his feet, but is clean every wit. And ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him. Therefore, said he, you are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I have done to you? You call me Master and Lord." And you say, "Well, for so I am. If I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither is he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. And we definitely don't want to get there and say, "Man, we missed out on all that joy." &gt;&gt; I don't, brother Brandon, I don't want to miss out on any joy. Praise the Lord. that the sisters will be dismissed to not miss out on any joy first. brothers can be dismissed. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Every day has been filled We always [music] lips. Jesus again. And the good [music] You [music] will be free. [music] &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; to the world with &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Walking away through his blood. Let us [singing and music] hear the words of shore. [music] The World will be real. Christ. [music] I don't know I've ever heard a better rendition of that song, Brother Stephen. So, thank you for that. Amen. Well, I'm happy happy are you if you do them. I ask brother Ryan to dismiss us in a word of prayer and if he had a verse on his heart to share with us. And before we go, my heart's full full of joy. I'm in commune with I'm just very happy. And what a beautiful way to start the year. And so many of you came up and said, "Thank you for doing this." Uh it's been 20 years, I think, since we've had an actual watch night or so. 20 years or so. And uh so you always never know how it's going to go, but thank you. And I feel blessed. So I hope you feel blessed as well. Bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a uh what a special way to end the year and bring in a new year. Amen. I was thinking um as they went through each of the young people asking them why we came here. I thought um you know if the Lord were to come I'd like to be found doing the thing that I like doing the most and that's fellowshipping with believers being with believers. It's not being at home. It's not being comfortable. Those things are nice, but gathering with those that you're you have a bond with, that's goes beyond blood and it goes beyond um proximity and it goes beyond family. Um that's what I want to be found doing if he were to come. I I thought of a if it's okay just to share this uh scripture um I had on my heart. Um well, I didn't have it on my heart, but I thought Lord, if he if brother Steve asked me, this is the scripture I would read if that's okay. I shared this with a Sunday school class um about a year ago and I was reminded of it the other day. Um I also wanted to tell a mini testimony [clears throat] about the Lord just really working on my niece Emma and it's kind of a testimony and it's also kind of a pre-estimony. I'd like to testify ahead of time of what I believe he's doing for her and just I really see um you know the Lord what what I what I trust is the Lord just really calling her and and so um just want to thank him for that. But we were sitting um Naomi and I and the kids with her just kind of do a little Bible study and this scripture came to mind that I had shared with the Sunday school class. Um and so if it's okay I'll read it. It's Romans well the the scripture we all kind of know is Romans 8:28. We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose. Um, but the two scriptures, the two verses right before that is what we were talking to her about. And I don't normally read a lot of translations. I hope it's okay if I just kind of just share this translation with you. But, um, I'd like to read the two verses before. This is how I want to. Again, this is just a marking of a new year. It's just another day really. But it's it does mark sometimes in our life change as one of the brothers was saying um where we can really have that stake that we can drive down and make a change. And this is what my my prayer is. I really want to be my my prayer to the Lord this coming year to just be more sincere as we heard brother Steve preach on a few weeks ago. It all just kind of tying together for this year end. So, Romans 8:26, it says, "Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searches the heart knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God." It's a beautiful scripture. Um, but I had stumbled across this translation that I shared with a Sunday school class that I thought, well, not all translations are are uh edifying, but this one definitely was. It says this way, Romans 8:26, also the spirit helps us. We are very weak, but the spirit helps us with our weakness. We don't know how to pray as we should, but the spirit himself speaks to God for us. He begs God for us, speaking to him with feelings too deep for words. &gt;&gt; God already knows our deepest thoughts and he understands what the spirit is saying because the spirit speaks for his people in the way that agrees with what God wants. And I just want to take that into again just another day but into this new year that that the Lord would really just not just um make it a nice scripture to me but really just open up the understanding behind it and and not just the understanding but give me will in me the will to pray this way and to realize that um I don't have to have the right words. It's just the action of surrendering and getting on my knees, which is the part where I fail the most. I think I have to pray the right way or say the right words and he'll take it. He'll make it worthy to come before the Lord. And so I hope that that scripture was a blessing to you as it was to me. And you know, if you do have some, we all have family members, we all have loved ones, we all have friends, maybe even co-workers that we want to see come to the Lord. So, I don't want to just exclude one out, but if you don't have somebody to pray for, uh, just remember my niece if you could. I know that, um, the devil's really battling her. Um, especially if he sees, you know, a little bit of a hunger, a little bit of a light that the Lord's drawing her, he's battling to her that much more, just like he does with all of our family. So, if you just keep her in prayer, let's just dismiss. I I do thank you, brother Steve, for having this. Um, I've stayed up late for a lot of other reasons and not any of them were as energizing and were as satisfying as as as this has been for me. So, we just thank the Lord for blessing with his presence. Let's let's go before him. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just can't really express to you, Lord, what you mean to us. And Lord, there has been good times and there's been hard times this year. We don't know what the next year holds for us, except we know it's going to be trials. It's going to be tests. It's going to be good times. It's going to be ups. It's going to be downs. But we know as a people of faith that you're going to be with us, Lord, in this coming year. That you're going to get us through, Lord. If that means you get us through to go home to be with you, then you get us through, Lord. But Lord, today is too short to take our eyes off of you, Lord. Our eyes off the prize. And I pray you would just will in us the will, Lord, to keep moving forward, to take a step every day, Lord, when we fall down, might be daily, Lord, to help me get back up. Help me dust myself off, Lord, and keep walking towards you, Lord, in faith. And Lord, I pray that when you come, Lord, when you come, you find faith in me. and every person in here, Lord. Every person who is a a true believer, Lord, may you just find faith, Lord. And and there's no way we can do it without you, Father. I know I can't do it without you. I can't I can't even walk, Lord, unless you hold my hand, Father. [music] Would you just hold my hand through this next year, Lord? Let's Let's just be, Lord, such a victorious people this coming year, Lord. Not that we wouldn't have battles and not that we wouldn't have failures, but we would be victorious in spite of that, Father. And I pray that you would get us through this next year, Lord. That you would really just open yourself up to every person, Lord, who wants, who's hungry, Lord, who's thirsty for you. You would just re show yourself in a way, Lord, that's never been shown before. Father, we know that you're you're infinite and you're capable of doing it, Lord. But we really just want to not just lean, Lord. We want to just we want to just rest, Lord, in your arms as this year approaches us, as the world is in chaos, Lord. I I just I'm at peace, Lord, in your arms. I'm at peace in in your presence, Lord. And I pray that it would not just be Lord as much as we enjoy this outward pouring Lord of your presence and the praise Lord and but may it be such an inward feeling Lord of every believer Lord just by maybe Lord just by a lifting of their hands Lord of their or just an opening of their heart towards you Lord that you would see Lord a heart behind that hand Lord and that you would want to come and abide like you never have before Lord would you fill the whole house Father &gt;&gt; the whole heart our minds. Lord, would you give us just a piece, Lord, that passes understanding, Lord? We love you. We thank you, Lord. Words like thank you. Just don't say it, Father. But I pray that we could just use what you've given us, Lord, to express our gratitude towards you. May it be worship, Lord. May it be a prayer, Lord. May it be just quiet time set aside for you, Lord. We love you and we thank you in Jesus name. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, I kind of want to sing Take the name of Jesus with you.
