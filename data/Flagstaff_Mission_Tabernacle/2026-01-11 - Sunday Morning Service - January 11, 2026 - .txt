========================================
[music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] Thank you. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Ooh. Hey. Hey. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] Hey, [music] real. Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; We can stand together. Oh, let's sing this song. The more that I release my cares, the [music] more you take control. And the more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. [singing] Amen. Just before we turn the service to brother Steve, I really appreciated [music] sheltered in the arms of God. Amen. Brother Steve and I before we came in out that we were talking [music] about um how our bodies are just falling apart. Mine happens to be my [music] mouth, my teeth, and everything else. and I'm just I'm at that age where I'm just falling apart, you know, and but uh the joy that we had. So, we talked about that's there, but then we talked about this millennial reign. To say we understand it, neither one of us said, "But the fact is that I have expectation. I'm sheltered in the arms of God. So, let the storms rage high, the dark clouds rise. They will worry me. Amen. Let's [music] sing this together. Amen. So let the storm raise high. The dark clouds rise. word me [music] for I've sheltered safe within the arm [singing and music] of God. [music] He [singing] walks with me [music] and not [singing] a word shall be for I shall [singing] [music] turn beyond. [singing] Lord bless you. Happy [music] to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Welcome to each one and We're in expectation that the Lord will speak to [music] us this morning. &gt;&gt; We're in expectation of also that when we worship him, he'll come down and inhabit our praises. And so that's our desire. We have a couple prayer requests. Before we get to those, I wanted to mention we had a a youth kind of an afternoon service scheduled for next Sunday. And this week on [music] Tuesday, Brother Aaron McGary and I were talking and he said, "Hey, I'm starting youth services once a month in Phoenix and he sent me the [music] flyer and the first one was next Sunday." And I said, "Man, we have a service scheduled." He said, "Well, what if I had your minister come down [music] to our service?" And so we prayed about it for a couple days and that's what we're going to do. So, Brother Isaac will be here Sunday morning. and brother [music] Isaac Hatfield. And then Sunday afternoon at 5, whoever wants to go, we can carpool, whatever. We'll go down to [music] brother Aaron McGarry's and it'll be youth orientated, but all are welcome uh for youth service next Sunday, but the morning [music] brother Isaac will be here ministering to us. And that's maybe in the spirit of working together as pastors. And you know, he was he said, "Brother Steve, I was worried it [music] was just going to be, you know, the few of my youth and I was just going to have a local minister and um he was very excited that we'll all kind of join together." And so in that spirit of unity, that's the plan for next Sunday afternoon. Also wanted to mention the [music] container in the back. If you have a question, we're doing a questions and answers [music] service on the 25th. So that's two Sundays from today. So, put your question in there [music] and we'll do our best to be led of the Lord in answering those. I think that's it. Brother Don wrote in here, "I would like to thank each one of you for your prayers and the [music] power you shared with me." That's really good. Brother Don, of course, very welcome and we're happy and blessed to do it. From Brother Matt, please remember sister Conniey's [music] dad, Howard. He needs a touch from the Lord. He's been suffering from an infection in his foot. And brother Glenn wrote this in [music] asking for prayer for upcoming chemo treatment this Wednesday. The doctor starting him on a new chemo. He's had a couple allergic reactions to the previous chemo. So, a new one is being tried this week. Is that Wednesday, brother? Again, Thursday. Wednesday. I pray that it would be effective in the treatment of the tumor and I won't have any negative reactions. Thank you for your prayers. [music] And he writes in here, "God is in control." And we certainly believe that. We know that. We're trusting [music] in that. And it's real to us, Brother Glenn. It's not just words on paper. It's life. It's [music] actually life to us. So, let's all bow our heads and we'll join in prayer [music] with our brothers and sisters. And if you have a need, slip your hand up, defy gravity, and pray with us. Heavenly Father, Lord, we come before you once again. And I see the believers that have gathered here this morning, Lord. But [music] what's hard for these physical eyes to see is all the angels and the ministering spirits. And that would [music] be gathered with us. But we believe that they're there, Lord. Your word places them there. It says the angels encamp [music] around those who fear you. And we do. And we love you, Lord. We have a a great reverend respect for [music] what you've provided to us in this hour and we trust that you're here with us and and so we first thank you Lord for being here with us for bringing each one here safely and allowing [music] us to gather and worship you. We don't know how long we'll be able to do it. So we give you thanks [music] once again and we present these petitions to you Lord for our brother Glenn. We continue to strike the ground in faith believing. Lord, your promise has been [music] made. We've accepted it. And now we deal with symptoms and things that Satan [music] would try to discourage us. But we're not discouraged, Lord. We're taking these footsteps day by day and possessing the land that you give us, [music] Lord. And so we claim that for our brother, Lord, for Sister Conniey's dad. [music] He's battling these things at the end of life, Lord, and infection in his foot and different battles, Lord, that they're having to deal with with him. And we'd ask that, Lord, not only would you help our brother, but give Brother Matt, Sister Connie grace and knowing how to handle these situations, Lord. And we thank [music] you for each member that slipped up their hand, Lord. Each person that would come in here with [music] faith and defy gravity, Lord. I heard the other day, it's not a force. gravity isn't, but it's a disruption in space and time. [music] And Lord, think about we think about the eternal God, and he's beyond all space and time. [music] But we do that, we slip up our hands, Lord. There's nothing that could pull us down away from that now. So, we thank you for the ability to do that. We worship you this morning, [music] Lord, in spirit and truth. We ask you and invite you to be with us with these prayer requests, Lord, with these needs. [music] Dwell in our midst this morning. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. If you have your Bibles, we might turn to Isaiah [music] the 12th chapter. We haven't read a scripture in a while. I've kind of been testing testing it out to go different ways with reading a scripture in the morning. So, we'll do Isaiah 12 this morning. And I haven't heard from you all either way. So, that gives me freedom to kind of go uh Isaiah chapter 12. We just read the whole chapter. It's for our responsive reading. In that and in that day thou shalt say, Oh Lord, I will praise thee. Though thou was angry with me, thine anger turned away, and thou comfortest me. not be afraid. &gt;&gt; Therefore, with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord, for he hath done excellent things. This is known in all the earth. &gt;&gt; Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee. Amen. Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Great to be seated. Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. What a wonderful sight. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Little c the little song come and die. The master calleth. I uh I started out with a smile on my face. I don't I don't say this through a whole lot of I have good days and bad days just like everybody else. today. I don't know exactly what it was except I felt alive in the Lord. And then when I came in here and this second verse and oh my, it just made the smile seem a little bit bigger. Amen. Jesus has a table spread. Amen. Yes, he does. Has a table spread where the saints of God are fed. Heides [music and singing] his people with his man he [music] all come and die come and die [music] all the multitude [music] through the water. [singing] Now come the disciples [music] Christ [music] to the coming night. And they found their hearts desire on the fire [music] every time. Oh, come and die. Come and die.

A lot of some of you know me, some of you don't. But every little bit you hear from me takes and makes out this picture of who Donald is. I like seeing people sing. I like watching how they do it. I like hearing them do it. I saw one and forgive me it's not I'm not making gest of it. I just in my mind's eye can see it. This lady, she had a strong voice, but it so happened that she was missing a couple teeth. So when she opened her mouth real wide, you could see that she was missing teeth. And my eyes focused on that, Brother Bill. And I thought, Lord, why is my And I thought, that's because that's me. But it didn't stop the fact of she was giving it everything she had no matter what she looked like. [music] Sometimes that's what I look at myself and I can look out here and I'm seeing what you're seeing and I'm seeing this mouth big missing a couple teeth but hoping that you understand it's from my heart. So sing. I don't care what it looks like. Sing to him because that's all that matter. If anybody knows, if anybody knows about the love [singing] of Jesus, [music] I do. Yes, I do. [music] If anybody knows the love of Jesus, [music] I do. [singing] Yes, I do. [music] All right. Beautiful song. But maybe that's uh what's deep on my heart. What's the one brother Le Pontain sings? Nope. We know what I'm happy. Uh uh the happy song. The happy song. Somebody help me out. &gt;&gt; That Well, no. Um um no, not the laughing song because I can't do it. Uh the fun. Oh, Lord.

Sister Kathy, Sister Marcy, you have a song for us. Amen. are coming. I think from the youth to the had the privilege to be a youth just as these young ones here and sister Mary was my song teacher and she taught us a lot of songs and stuff and as I grew up I saw these women when I met them were not the age that they're at now but they were younger but they always held a light for me always saw them. &gt;&gt; Always knew that they just held the gospel high &gt;&gt; no matter what. I saw them ups and downs and but it always comes back. &gt;&gt; So I pray that the the Lord should carry these little ones here if he carries his coming will be just as heals older ones just holding the light of the gospel. Amen. Amen. There is a [singing and music] river and it flows. flows from [singing and music] deep within. There [singing] is [music] a fountain that [music and singing] frees the soul from sin. Come [singing] to this water. There [singing] is a vast [music] supply. There [singing] is a river that never [music] shall run [singing] dry. And there was this [singing] thirsty woman. She was drawing from [singing] the well. You see, her life was ruined and [singing and music] wasted and her soul was bound for doom. Oh, but then she met the [music] master [singing] and he told her of all her sin. [music] [singing] And he said, "Child, if [singing] you'll drink this water, you'll never thirst again. [singing] [music] Oh, there is a river [singing] [snorts] and [music] it flows from deep within. [singing and music] There is a [singing] fountain that frees us soul from sin. Oh, come [singing] to this water. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; There is a vast supply. There is a river that never [singing] shall run dry. There came a sound from heaven [singing] as of a rushing mighty dear wind. [singing] Oh, it filled their hearts with [singing] singing and it gave them [music] peace [singing] within. The prophet [singing] [music] gave the promise. He [music and singing] said the spirit will descend. And [singing] from your inner being, [singing] a [music] river with [singing] no wind. [music] Oh, there is a [singing] river [music] and it flows [music and singing] from deep within. Oh, [singing] there is a [singing] fountain that frees [singing] the soul from sin. [music] Oh, come [singing] to this water. [singing] [music] There is a vast [music] supply. There [singing] is a river that [singing] never shall run [singing] dry. If we could stand. Sister Marcy, Sister Kathy, would you sing this as we invite the pastor around? Truly, there is a river. There [singing] is a river and it flows [singing] from deep within. [singing and music] There [singing] is [music] a fountain that is [music] [singing] the soul from sin. Come [singing] to this water. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; There is a vast supply. There [singing] is a river that [singing] never [music] shall run. [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. while his presence is near. Let's just bow to him in prayer. And heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for that song, Lord, and we help us to understand it, Lord, that there's a river that never runs dry. And this morning, Lord, you've chosen that may we we might talk about that river. And so we present the service to you and we dedicate it to you. We dedicate ourselves to you, Lord, and place ourselves in your hands and each person places themselves in your hands this morning, Lord. And may you have preeminence and full authority and over this service. We thank you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. in the book of Matthew chapter 24 and also John chapter 6. Matthew 24, John chapter 6, and Matthew we'll just read um two verses there and verses 27 and 28 kind of became a topic uh for sister Dette and I this week and then just seemed like the Lord would lead us to go this direction this morning. I wrestled with this all night. I told Danette, "Just pray for me." And I know that she did. I know you all were. I can actually feel it. I actually can feel it when you're praying for me. Believe that. So, verse 27 of Matthew 24, it says this, "For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even into the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be." And then the next verse says this, "For wheresoever the carcasses, &gt;&gt; there will the eagles be gathered together." And someone asked us a question about this we might answer maybe during the Q&A service uh defining maybe what eagles would be. There's different translations of that. If you have a New International Version, it says vultures. Believe it or not, a lot of virgins, about half of them say vultures. The point is that um wherever there's fresh food to be found, &gt;&gt; birds of prey &gt;&gt; seek that fresh meat, that fresh food. And when I was talking to Dette about that, I just had some inspiration and I said, you know, we're birds of prey. &gt;&gt; There's birds of prey, but we're also birds of P R A Y. where the carcass is, where the dead body is is actually what the translation of that is. Where the dead body is, uh there will the eager eagles be gathered. John chapter 6, Jesus is talking along these lines. And in verse 59, he's sort of at the end of his discourse, and this is a very long chapter. It goes to 71 verses. Um in verse 59 he says the Bible says this these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this they said this is an hard saying who can hear it it's a hard saying who can hear it a lot of the teachings of Jesus were it was about love and then it got a little tougher you know it's like love your enemy And then uh you know don't don't even look at a woman to lust after her or you've committed adultery in your heart. Don't say unto your brother, thou fool, you've murdered him. So it gets hard. It gets a little tougher. But at the end of his ministry, he says some things that are hard. In another translation of this, it says fierce. And then at that point, almost everybody leaves him. Bible says that it's a hard saying. Who can hear it? When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, not just the other people, not just everybody who left. His own disciples were like, "What?" And he said unto them, "Does this offend you?" And this is like our theme this week, it seems like. How many appreciated brother Ryan's message on Wednesday and how it kind of tied in with the service on Sunday. And I didn't intend this, but the Lord will have his way. You can be seated. Lord bless you. A hard saying, and I put this up there, Sister Pauline, as a definition in the Greek. I like looking at the Greek in the Hebrew or whatever it might be. And it's the word scleros. It means hard or harsh or rough. Well, we think, well, Jes, it was Jesus. He he was certainly soft and compassionate and and and you know he but a couple times in his ministry, not just a couple, but several times he would look at the Pharisees and speak very harshly and you know tell them you hypocrites and you whited walls and he would say things like that. In this one he's not necessarily going after anybody in particular and we'll find out what it was but he's saying something that's very hard or harsh or fierce. The same word hard is used in James chapter 3 and verse four. James says, "Behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds." And so that's the same word. It's something very strong, it's harsh, it's hard, yet they're turned with a very small helm. And then Jesus goes on to say, you know, the Bible says it's a hard saying. Who can hear it? And he says, does this offend you? It certainly did offend uh many. It offended them in their in their spirit or in their flesh or however it just it just offended them. And that offend means and I put this definition. It's out of the lexicon up here. I really liked it. It's to put a stumbling block or an impediment in the way and all that was fine and make somebody trip and fall. But this one here, I think it's the second one. It says to cause a person to begin to distrust and desert one whom he ought to trust and obey to cause to fall away. So offend in this case and I think that's an accurate definition that would fit here. It caused people who who begin to distrust and to desert one who they ought to trust and obey. And what he said offended him. had caused many who had followed him and who had seen miracles and who had witnessed healings and had been the very recipient of his love and of his great miraculous healings and even his touch or even the food that he created. They had eaten it and they'd watched their loved ones be healed that that heard so many beautiful sayings and yet at this one it what he says causes them to distrust and to desert and to turn from one who they ought to trust and then it says to cause to fall away to be offended to disapprove and and Sister Paul if you put the next one up. I thought this morning I'll give you a little preview of what we're going to study and we're not going to answer these questions necessarily. I think the spirit as brother Steve talks, I appreciated Sister Kathleen's testimony a couple months ago and she heard something from God that the minister never said. That that was so beautiful to me that that the minister didn't say nothing. He didn't he he was talking maybe on a different line. Who knows what he was talking about. What she heard though was something that she needed from God. And so I won't, you know, pick apart these questions necessarily, but but I hope that God, the spirit of God will go forward this morning and answer you as well. It was a hard saying and the disciples murmured and and they confess that what was the saying? What was the thing? Certainly it's in scripture, but it's not just there. It's it's actually a discourse that he gives over a period of 10 or what devil we're prepared. Are we still That's okay, brother. Tim. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you just praise the Lord. All right, if we cut out again, we'll just go to the wired mic. Not worried about it this morning. So, what was the saying? They said it's a hard saying. I didn't read the saying because we I want to just maybe work through it a little bit. What was so difficult? Cuz now in your Christian walk, you can come to church and you can appreciate the smooth sayings that the minister will say and even you know the ones that it it's hard but you know it's right. You know like love your enemy. We could say that and it's hard to do sometimes and to put into practice and and you know and it says pray for those that that despitefully use you and persecute you though it's a diffic it's something hard to practice. We know it's right. We don't we don't even really question that and we just know it's hard and and and for brothers let's just be honest when the Bible says you shouldn't look at a woman to lust after her. We we practice that. It's something that, hey, you know, with the the the sin in the world today and with a university of naked women walking, yeah, it's it's something that tempts us every day, but we know it's right. And so, we practice not doing that. That's why we have things like crosses in our windshield and things like that. So, so it's not that that's a hard saying. Those are just teachings from from God that we know we ought to do. But now, it came to the point in John where he said something hard. It was harsh. It was fierce. And then it caused his own disciples to murmur. That word means like they whispered or they they began to I forget the other word for it but basically they they almost began to speak against the saying they murmured just you know you know the the the the children of Israel many times they got into trouble for murmuring against Moses or or they would get into trouble for speaking against the the thought that Moses has. So it was what was so fierce that those who saw miracles became deserters and even the ones who would crucify him. What was so hard? Now we know he looked at the Pharisees and he he said some harsh things to him and definitely they got offended by it. But this what was the crux and that's a Latin word for cross. What was the junction point? What was the intersection that causes people today? And more importantly, go to the next one there. What's the hard thing today? What's the saying today? Well, is it you shouldn't cut your hair? I mean, is that the real Is that really the hard thing? I I don't think it is, saints, and I appreciate my mom for agreeing with me on that, but I don't think that's what it is. Is it the hard thing you shouldn't paint your nails or paint your face or what? Is that really the hard thing? That's just teaching, you know? That's just scriptural teaching. And Jezebel is the only person who painted her face in the Bible, the only woman. And she got thrown out of the window by the Unix. And then dogs ate her before they could even get to her. So, so now this is just teaching and we can see it. But, but what's today? What's the hard thing in the message that causes people to look at it and desert it and walk away? What is the hard saying? And is it really that hard? Or or do we murmur against it even as disciples of the message? What is it? It's such a Well, we'll just go to John in the first couple verses here of chapter 6. The Bible says after these things, now Jesus before this in chapter 5, we read it a few weeks ago, he heals the man on the Sabbath. And there's a little fight with the Pharisees and the Jews there and you shouldn't be doing this on the Sabbath. And he's his disciples, excuse me, are picking corn and and you know, there's some criticism there. And so now he's been dealing with the Jews kind of all of chapter five. He goes over across the sea, went over the Sea of Galilee, the Bible says. And then it says, "A great multitude followed him." And they followed him for a specific reason. And the Bible defines why they followed him. Not because they had faith in their soul like Peter. You're the son of God. But they followed his ministry. Because they saw the miracles. Yeah. In in chapter five, it was about loaves and getting fed and that kind of thing, but they saw miracles and that's why they followed him. Do you know today that's a very similar uh pattern that we witnessed in the in the ministry of Malachi 4. Many followed him. It was great revivals in the 40s and 50s. Why? They saw miracles. They would tell their neighbor there's a great miracle and and and my I was healed instantly and I had nervousness or I had a goiter or I had something and and I stood before this man and he defined what was in my life. He exposed Satan and then I was healed and they would go and tell everybody and there would be a great multitude even my parents would have had the opportunity to be in his meetings certainly my grandmother and many of you but now what but what's what happened was they followed for the purpose but then the word went forth and it weeded them out it began to kind of trim down who was the true believer and then the and then the fake believer and and then from there a saying went forth that was a Lord saying in this message and it really got down to where we are today just the churches here and there on corners and you know in divided areas and and so what is it though today? What's the heart? Are we are we still following? I think there are some that are still following today because of the miracles today or the miracles that happened 50 years ago. They hear a great testimony. They say that must be right. I'll follow it. you know, it might happen in my life and then it happens and they follow the message today because of the miracle in their life or because of the loaves and fishes. But is that why you're following today? Something to ask ourselves. And so there was a we might say it like this. There was a pull. There was an attraction. There was a draw. Brother Brandon would say there was a turn. And so that pull would come in his ministry and it would it would draw [screaming] all kinds to his to his ministry we could say it and and Christ does not change. So if that was a ministry back then in Jesus's ministry you'll find out in his ministry 75% of the healings happen in the early part of his ministry he didn't stop healing. Malchus had a had a ear that was that was cut off and he healed that just right before he was crucified. So even at the end there were healings that were taking place but as a transition in his ministry he began with a great healing ministry. Then he began to preach or prophesy and at the end he really get down to the nitty-gritty. And he did that for a purpose to find out who was a sheep and who was a goat that was following him. And today it's the same thing. We're getting down to the end saints. And there's a hard saying that goes forth and that saying is true but not everybody can hear it. Even the disciples, we might murmur and we might not understand. But may God give us grace to look down and see the seed on the inside and not distract us from deserting, you know, from staying with our Lord. Help me is what I would say. In Moses's day, the Bible says this. Well, we'll we might say this about today talking about the coming of the Lord. Before we get to Moses, 2 Thessalonians 2 chapter 1. Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus, and are gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind. Might say, don't worry, don't be troubled neither by spirit or word or letter as from us, as the day of Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means, for that day will not come [clears throat] except there come a falling away. And this word is apostasy. In Greek, it's apostasy. It doesn't say falling away. It says apostasy. So unless an apostasy come, which is a falling away, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of predition. I think we have the definition up there. It's a falling away. And another word is a defection. So unless a defection comes, that day he's talking about the coming of the Lord, that day will not come unless the defection or the apostasy or the falling away comes and there's a great before that or or as as presenting that falling away in Christ's ministry. There was that apostasy and it was began with a great challenge that went forth. Do you know who I am? He would say something like this maybe to give us a little clue as to the answer. My flesh is meat and my blood is drink. And it was a challenge that went forward. Are you willing to eat of my flesh and drink of my blood? And the challenge went forward. That's a hard saying. Amen. &gt;&gt; We got murmur against that and we begin to speak against it. Well, what happened was at the end of these great ministries, you find it in Moses, you even find it in Gideon, you find it in David, these challenges go forward and they they whittle down to the very the very truest of the remnant of the believers. And they whittle it down not with not with, you know, blessed are the meek and blessed are the pure in heart. Blessed are those who pursue righteousness, you'll be filled. No, not even, you know, pray for your enemy. Love your enemy. Excuse me. I think it says love your enemy. It says do good to those who hate you. love, you know, love your enemy, do good, pray for them who who persecute. Not even that. Way beyond that. Way beyond that. That not way that that's a that's a portion. And that does help a whittling down because there are those who don't even want to love their enemy. And they're not even going to put that into practice. But then Jesus gets to my flesh is meat and my blood is drink. What is it today? What's the hard saying today? So now in Moses ministry numbers 13 here's a here's a hard saying the Lord spake unto Moses saying thou men that they may search the land of Canaan which I give unto you unto the children of Israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man everyone a ruler among them. Send these men. We're at the border of Canaan. Send men into the land. Find out if what you know what I've been telling you is true. What the Lord's been tell is it does it have milk and honey? That just start there. Does it have milk and honey? Focus on is my I'm sending you to a land with milk and honey. Focus on that. Send these men. The Bible actually lists them. I put them up here. It lists them over a dozen verses or so, but the Bible lists them. And if you'll notice on the second line there, Hosa, that's Joshua. But Moses after Joshua comes back, he changes his name from Hosa, which is salvation, to Jehoshua. I'm not even pronouncing it right, but Joshua, which is God is salvation. And he changes that name because of what Joshua says when he comes back from the land. He saw everything else everybody saw. Caleb and Joshua weren't blinded. And then they came back and they saw grapes. Caleb and Joshua saw the Amalachites, saw the Canaanites, saw the sons of Anoch, the giants. They saw all of that. And they also saw the milk and the honey and the grapes. They saw it all. But they came back with a different view &gt;&gt; on what God was able to do in that land than what the other than the other 10 had. &gt;&gt; But they did see it. Bible says, and I'm fast forwarding uh numbers here, &gt;&gt; they told him and said, 'We come into the land where thou sendest, and surely it flowestth with milk and honey, and this is the they even brought back the fruit of it. This is the fruit of it. They Bible say I think they they were carrying uh bundles or uh what was the word? A bundle of grape. What do you call that? Maybe it's just a bundle. Cluster. I think it's cluster in the Bible. Anyways, nevertheless, notice they this they brought back the fruit. Nevertheless, the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great. Moreover, we saw the children of Adch there. The Amalachites dwell in the land of the south. The Hittites, the Jebusites, the Amorites dwell in the mountains, the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan. And Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said, "Let's go." &gt;&gt; You see, you understand what happened here? They all saw walled cities and giants and Amalachites and Canaanites and we're, you know, we're grasshoppers and they're a great number. And Caleb's perspective was, let's go right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's how you ought to be, saints. It's a hard here's the hard saying. You're able to go up into the land and overcome it. You're a That's a hard saying. Do you believe it? Are you able to go this morning and receive the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Or is your flesh too great? Or is the battle going to be too great? I don't think so. Okay. Now, and Caleb still he said, "Let's go and possess it. We're a well able to overcome it." But the men that went up with him said, "We be not able against the people, for they're stronger with we." The Bible says they brought up an evil report. That's also worded as a murmur, a slander, excuse me, of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, "The land though which we have gone to search it is is a land that eateth up the inhabitants that thereof, and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature." And they begin to murmur, and they begin to evil report. Maybe they would say something like this. He said we got to eat his flesh. He said we got to drink his blood. and I'm just not willing. You know, I'll go far, but I'm just not willing to do that. But what you lack is a revelation of what he meant when he said, "Eat my flesh and drink my blood." He said, "The flesh profitth nothing, but the spirit, it gives life to your soul." &gt;&gt; But they got they got twisted in their mind. They thought it was their fight. And if you think today it's your fight, you're already starting off, you know, lo in a losing. You got no shot. You, you know, you've lost the battle already. And they they murmur. They said, "We can't do it." Numbers, I'm fast forwarding. They murmured. And and God judges them for that. You know, he says, "I can't believe you're you're not going to go. None of you this generation are going to go because you've brought up an evil report of the land." And he condemns essentially an entire generation. And he says, "Now go back to the desert in the wilderness where you need to wander." That's what he said is this. Listen, this message, you know, the Bible is the Bible, okay? We just can't quote love, you know, love. We love everybody and we just can't quote. We got to preach the truth of the Bible, which is when they weren't ready to go and get the Holy Ghost, he said, "Get back to the desert. Get molded again until you're ready to come into the land with faith and possess it foot by foot, step by step, the land which God gave you. He sent him right back to the desert. Let's read it now. He says, "And the Lord sh said, I will do unto, excuse me, unto all this evil generation that are gathered together against me in this wilderness. They shall be consumed, and there they shall die, and the men which Moses sent to search the land, who returned," and made all the congregation to murmur against him. Notice they brought the evil report, and they made all the congregation believe that evil report. And today it's the same. Today people think, "Well, you you know, you can get the Holy Ghost, but it's really not enough to change you." People will say that it is enough to change you. How do you know, Brother Steve? Well, I I'm a testimony that the Holy Ghost is more than enough to take a vile sinner and change him into a son of God. &gt;&gt; Tell me it's not enough. And and bringing up a slander upon the land. Even those men that did bring up evil report upon the land died by the plague before the Lord. But Joshua, did I miss I missed a little bit here. We're just going to keep going. But Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Japuna, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still. There was a plague that fell on them that didn't believe the hard saying. Well, it's it's the same kind of hard saying today. There's Amalachites and battles and and trouble and trials and and and and you know there's there's all that and there's Amalachites and there's walled cities, there's fortresses, but God gave it to you. There's also this. There's also this. Repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Now, what are you gonna look at? Acts 2:38, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Are you going to look at I got problems and I got amalachites in my life. I got nervousness. I got I got fleshly battles. I have desires. I have this and I have that. What are you going to look at? He promised you you have the land for your possession. And we still today look at the Amalachites, the walled city, and we think we can't do it. No, you can't do it. God already did it. Just step forward. Eat of the flesh, the body word of the son of man. Is that a hard saying? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Okay, brother Bam said this. Now listen closely. When the word test came, when they went over and seen the opposition so great, the greatest opposition they ever seen, the Amalachites was 10 times their size, they said, "We look like grasshoppers. Their fences or their cities are so walled so they can run a chariot around it." Yeah, it's real simple. Wonder if they could seen a little preview if it might have helped them. Well, here's here's the preview. We're going to march around it seven times. though there's a whole bunch of chariots that you could walk, you know, drive around the city at the top of the wall. We'll just march around it, blow our trumpets, and it'll just come down. I mean, that's what they should have been thinking. As hard as they can go around the wall, see, of their cities, why their spears are way out, they're long, and they're giants. We look like grasshoppers. We can't do it. A great challenge was presented to these spies. They're bigger. They're more in number. They're incredible. They have incredible large see it's a hard saying but it must be separated from the truth of God's word not mixed with it separated from the truth of God's word otherwise doubt enters in and and and you know you just think you can't do it but God just requires one thing of you I gave you this land believe that I gave it to you that's really all he requires just believe I gave it to you these men saw the same thing and Caleb was not even like hey let's kind Let's get ourselves ready and and let's, you know, build our army together. Caleb said, "Let's go up right now and at once and let's go to that city." What is it, saints, that today, if you need something, why don't you just go up right now and, you know, maybe get out of a little order a little bit in the service. Go up [screaming] right now and claim the land that God has given you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; My and Moses, you know, Moses actually stood in the gap for the people. This is one of the two times he he goes and and and and the Lord wants to just completely wipe him out. And Moses says, "Listen, if we do that, then, you know, the Egyptians will say that you weren't great enough to take him into the land, so don't do that." And he stands, you know, it was the spirit of Christ in Moses standing in the middle and interceding. And really, God knew that Moses had and he be to test his own spirit in Moses. Will it intercede for these people? And it intercedes yet today. It certainly does. Bible says this in verse 18. The Lord is long-suffering. He's of great mercy. He forgives iniquity and transgression and by no means clears the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. And brother Steve just lost his place. Okay. Third and fourth generation. Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy. And as thou has forgiven this people from Egypt even until now, you please Lord, pardon them, the iniquity. You have great mercy and pardon, you've forgiven him from Egypt until now. And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy word. Then he says this, but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, he hath followed me fully. Him will I bling into the bring into the land where into he went, and his seed shall possess it. Now the Amalachites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley. So what happened here was God heard the evil report and he he began to send a plague and actually the 10 men died and I can't remember how many more but they died because of their evil report and the slander they brought upon the land and the slander wasn't there's giants there the slanders the slander was were not able &gt;&gt; that was a report on the land &gt;&gt; were not able to overcome it well you're not looking correctly &gt;&gt; it's not you're not able. Our God is more than able to overcome it. So now he puts a plague and then God tells him tomorrow turn and get to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea. This is the hard saying, go back to the wilderness. Maybe he's just he's dealing with Israel now as a nation. We understand that. So he's dealing with them as a whole. Even though Caleb and Joshua and Moses were there and part of that group, he's dealing with them and he said, now he doesn't say go back to Egypt, but he says you're going to wander in the wilderness. And I had never seen this until the other day. He tell Moses tells the people what God told him. Listen, you got right to the border. You rejected that I could do it. I had to send a plague. Now go by the you're going to do some wandering for a while. 40 years until that generation is wiped out. And Moses told these things, verse 39, unto all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly, and they rose up early in the morning. They gathered them to the top of the mountain, saying, 'Lo, we be here. We'll go up to the place which the Lord hath promised, for we had sinned. So they got to the top of the mountain overlooking Canaan. And they and they s, you know, they mourned all night, and they grieved, and they were sad, but they said, "We'll just go up. We'll go up anyway." You know, they did this. I I I I probably read this before. I didn't even know that. I forgot this. They went and they went to the top of the mountain. It's kind of like they repented a little bit and and they said, "You know what? We're sad. The Lord told us that we could do it and we he sent a plague and and and and you know, we we're really sad about that. We mourned all night, but now we're just going to go up to the top and let's go down there. We've sinned. We we now repent." And this is the saints. This one, if you talk about a hard saying, this is a hard saying. Listen what happened. Moses said, "Wherefore now do you transgress the commandment of the Lord, but it shall not prosper. Don't do it." He's already told you, "Go back. You're not even ready to get it. Go back. Go back to the wilder. You have some wandering to do in the wilderness." And sometimes, you know what we do is say, and I could make this a type, and it's not a perfect type, but just bear with me. Sometime God has a little more molding into your life that needs to be done and you reject that molding that he's doing and you say, "I'm just going to go anyways." And and God's trying to work on your life a little bit. He's trying to mold you and you say, "No, I'm just going. I don't need this moldy. I can bypass this test." No, you can't, saints. He's going to break you down, like it or not. So, they say, "Listen, we're just going to go in now." And Moses is like, "What are you doing? It's not going to prosper." Go not up, for the Lord is not among you, that you be not smitten before your enemies. Now, there's a whole message, a group of messages titled presuming. Prophet of God takes this exact scripture and Moses says, "For the Amalachites, the Canaanites are not there before you are there before you, excuse me, and ye shall fall by the sword because you're turned away from the Lord. Therefore, the Lord will not be with you, but we have the scripture. I think it's verse 43. So, Moses tell he's not going to be be with you. But they presumed to go up into the hilltop. Nevertheless, the word, the ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp. So, the word did not go with them. So they went they went to fight their own battle with the maybe they they went to try and get the Holy Spirit, you know, by just doing good. Ain't going to happen. You can't be good enough. You can't do good enough. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. So they went verse 45 44. They presumed to go, but the the the ark did not depart. Do we have the next verse there? Verse 45. Praise the Lord. Then the Amalachites came down and the Canaanites dwelt in that hill and smoked them and discomforted them even unto Hora. They lost this group that decided we're just going to go anyway and maybe reject a little bit of chastisement of the Lord. He presented a difficulty to him, something hard, a hard saying, something difficult to understand. And the Lord does the same thing in in the book of John. He presents something that's so difficult for us to wrap our minds around. But it doesn't matter how difficult it is for you. You must accept the hard saying. But he said, "Eat my flesh and drink my blood." That's too hard, Brother Steve. I don't even understand it. And to this day, the Catholics believe, no offense if there'd be one here this morning, that their priest takes the body of Jesus Christ and and he and he transforms it, I forget the word, transubstantiation maybe. Anyways, so he takes the body of Jesus Christ and they they they form it into the little wafer that the people and they believe that they're literally eating the body of Jesus Christ. If you read 50 years in the books of Rome, uh 50 years in the church of Rome, the book, I encourage you to read it. There's an interesting story where a priest is talking about that and and he does the transsubstantiation or whatever it is and he and he puts the body of Jesus Christ, he believes into the waper and then, you know, some of it falls on the ground and a rat rocks through the church and eats it and now he's just completely disheveled. But it just doesn't even make sense. It's a type, saints. It's not a literal body of Jesus Christ, but you must commune with him in a type and and you must feed on the body word of the Jes of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You see the difference? Okay. So now he thins them down here in in John chapter 6. I just want to read a little portion of that. Okay. I verse 48 of John chapter 6. I am the bread of life. That bread of life. Your fathers did eat mana in the wilderness and are dead. They ate bread. He was even bread from heaven. They're dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die. What bread? This bread. He's point to himself. You must eat this and not Now, now he's so deeper. His saying is so deeper than just pointing to his actual fleshly body, but he's pointing to the body word, the spirit also that's in him. And he says, "I'm the living bread." The next verse, he says, "I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he'll live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world." The Jews strove, the Bible says among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" What? Here's the hard saying. Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." This is the words of the Lord Jesus Christ. Yeah. Blessed are the meek are his words. And blessed are the poor in spirit. Those are his words. Blessed are those who seek righteousness. You shouldn't lust. Those are all his words. You know, I forgive you. Your sins are forgiven. Those are his words. These are also his words. You can't discount or throw out what you don't like. That's what they did. You throw out one word, you just throw his entire ministry out. So he now he's saying you must eat flesh and drink blood. And it's a hard saying. If you don't, you don't have life in you. Whosoever eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. And some of you have like maybe never heard this before and you're like, "Brother Steve, this is a hard saying." You know, Paul goes on and explains it. I'm not going to explain it today because I'd rather you get in the Bible and let the Holy Spirit just lead you. Are you saying we have to eat his flesh, drink his blood? He that eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my dwelleth blood dwelleth in me and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father, so is he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. This is that bread which came down from heaven. Not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead. He that eateth of this bread shall live forever. There's his discourse on the bread of life. And there's the hard saying. And there's the thing difficult to understand about the next verse is what we read at the beginning. He he's in the synagogue when he says this. And then his disciples began to murmur. And when Jesus knew that his disciples murmured, he said unto them, "Does this offend you? Are you offended this morning? Why do we or do we not understand it this morning? Why would he do that? Why wouldn't he just explain the whole thing fully? Listen, I'm talking to you." But he has to say something harsh because he sees goats and Judas's mixed in the group. And so the hard sayings go forward and and and the group that you know that just kind of like what oh it's so hard Lord to understand and you know so many people are going to leave but Jesus know that only the sheep can handle the hard sayings in this message. Now, brother Bandham says this. What do you think a smart intellectual person would thought? I imagine the priest that had him in the temple was very, very ashamed of them having him there. To think that a man would stand up and say a thing like that, except you people eat my flesh and drink my blood said this is a human vampire. See, eat my flesh and drink while he's a cannibal. You good thinking people will you get away from such a lunatic as that? He never explained it. He just said it. He did it to stumble them, to separate his sheep from goats. He did it to throw them off. Nobody wanted to cooperate with they had no cooperation from then on. See, you know, the same thing has happened today. Exactly the same thing. A very type of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hard sayings has gone forth and we have to cope with them as believers. We can't say they're not hard. I, you know, many would just get an arrogant attitude a little bit. Oh, I just believe it, brother Steve. Man, you know, you're you're kind of missing it if that's your attitude. These are hard saying saints. This is, you know, this isn't just milk that we drink. This is tough. The message is not for babies. The message is not for sissies and wimps. These are hard things that go forward. And we accept them and we say, "Lord, I don't get it all. I can't understand it all, but I'm I can't. Where to whom am I going to go? Where else would I go? You alone have the words of eternal life. Don't let the devil trick you into thinking you have to explain all the message or or be able to understand it in your mind. It's not even meant for that. God doesn't even want you to fully understand it. He wants to present it to you and you go, "Lord, I don't know, but I believe it. I can't explain it, but I'm here and I'll be here till the end. I don't care what you tell me. I don't care if you tell me to go eat crumbs, I'll do it. Whatever you tell me. It's hard, but I believe it. &gt;&gt; See, that's true sheep that will stand there and take it. &gt;&gt; Oh, the mystery works. It's working today. And the Bible says in second Thessalonians says this, "Only he who now letth will." He's allowing it until he be taken out of the way. It's being allowed. is being permitted, the mysteries working. And then shall the wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming, even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivleness of unrighteousness in them that perish, because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Excuse me for going so quickly through that. And he's just talking about this mystery and it's there and it has a purpose and and and and it's going to work until the Holy Spirit goes and allow you know it's permitted to work during that time. And then it says this and for this cause God shall send them a strong delusion that they should believe a lie. Today a strong delusion is sent. &gt;&gt; It's being sent saints and it's a it's a delusion that that word means it's a deceitful strong means power. So, it's a deceiving power that is spent and God sent that. Why? He sent it in John. He said, "Here's a deceiving power. Eat my flesh." But the disciples looked at it and go, "I don't get it. I don't understand it all, but I believe I'll eat your flesh and drink your blood if you tell me to." &gt;&gt; But now, a deceiving power goes forward in the world and it's trying to infect your mind today. &gt;&gt; Certainly, it is. I don't want to call anyone out to say something like, you know, raise your hands if you're not being affected by the deceiving power. But there is. And so it's it's there. It's a strong one. It's deceitful. And it says things like, "Oh, you know, he was just a good man. He he prophesied a little bit, but he got off at the end of his message." Would you say that about Jesus? Oh, he did a lot of miracles and the 5,000. But at the end, the whole the whole, you know, drink blood and eat flesh. Other daddy was good. See, it's a strong delusion. It's a deceiving power. It's trying to deceive you. Stick with it, though. Stay with it. Ask God to help you. Stay with it. Don't be drawn away to the tightful lust of knowledge of this day. See, the same Satan subtle spirit that deceived Eve in the beginning is coming in and saying, "You're not surely die. You can just be a good person. No, no, no, saints. You've got to follow the prophetic ministry of today with all your body, soul, and spirit. We saw what the saying was. And disciples murmured. They grumbled. And the Bible says this, they it's like to to say something in a low tone, to confer secretly together. It's used of those who discontentedly complain. Does this shock you? Does it offend you? See, we know, you know, love your enemy doesn't offend you. Do good to them doesn't offend you. Pray for them and despitefully use you. And that doesn't offend you. Dress and hair kind of offends a few people, but you know, it's just scripture. You can just see it. But the things that offend us might be this. I put a few hard sayings up here. We're going to close. It's 12 o'clock. We got a few hard sayings in the message. And I I put them up here. I I felt the Lord led me into this. So I I don't even know what I'm doing this morning to be honest. I when I when I stand up here, I don't even understand what I'm preaching. To be honest, I just ask the Lord would help me take these words and put them a certain way so that the people can receive them and then be encouraged to continue on. Keep going, saints. Don't give up yet. Don't let the strong delusion of this age deceive you. And don't think you can conquer the land all by yourself. And don't think you can just go grab onto the Holy Ghost and take it, which you can in a way. But what you got to do is allow God to help you with that because it's a great land. It's full of Amalachites and and Canaanites and the sons of Anakin walled cities. But you're more than able if Jehovah becomes part of your salvation. See, Joshua went up there salvation. But then when he got to the land and he came back and said, "Listen, we're more than able if we take God with us." And Moses said, "That's right. Your name is now Jehovah salvation." Let me tell you, you're more than able to receive the Holy Spirit today. And for him to transform your thoughts, your desires, your your even ideas, your purpose in life to take to the token over your family. You're able to do that if Jehovah the Savior goes with you. Brother Ram says, "This seems like it's the hardest thing for people to get into their head that the Holy Spirit leads. Sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit of God. Not bishops and cardinals, not bishops and cardinals and so forth. sons and daughters, not pastors and song leaders, not deacons and trustees, Aidens and Evelyn's, Bellas and Lexas, Samuels and Chloe's, sons and daughters are led. That's the hardest thing you get in your head. You're led by the spirit. That's a hard saying, Brother Steve. I've been walking my life and tripped and fell and made wrong decisions. How about this, sons? You got to get this in your head. You're led. Your wrong decisions. Jonah made the wrongest just defy God decision you ever made. And the people of Nineveh worshiped big fishes. And Jonah jumped into the the water or thrown actually into the water. He gets eaten by a big fish and he gets spurted on the beach by a god of Nineveh, the big fish. And he walks out the prophet out of the mouth of the god of the big fish. And it started out with I'm not going to Nineveh. Those are wicked people. &gt;&gt; But you see, sons of God are led by the spirit of God. Oh God, do you believe it now? You're led by the spirit. Accept that into your mind. &gt;&gt; Give me a church that so complete. This is a hard saying. A It's a tough one. Give me a church that's so completely anointed with God till their every action and move is thus sayith the Lord. Walk in that shakina glory. I'll show you a Messiah standing upon the earth. &gt;&gt; That's a hard saying, brother Kurt. I mean, that's a hard one. Can you say amen to that this morning? That that if you surrender to God, &gt;&gt; you're a Messiah walking on. No, brother Steve, you're making me a God. But Jesus said this, you call them gods who the word of the Lord came to. That's cuz you are. You're his hands and feet today. You're a Messiah on earth stand. That's a hard saying. Why? Cuz you're looking at you. &gt;&gt; That's your problem. You're looking too much at you. That's a hard saying, brother Steve. Yeah, it's a hard saying, but you got to believe it. &gt;&gt; Must believe that you're a son and daughter of God. You're a Messiah here on earth. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You got to accept that. It might make you happy like Isaiah said. Okay, here's another hard one. took water out of the river. Moses did. Poured it upon the bank and every drop of water throughout Egypt turned to blood. What could do that but God? What was it? He was so completely surrendered to God's anointed word till he was the Messiah. You got to say amen to that. You can't but say amen to that. And don't you're not saying amen to Moses is God. You're not saying that. You're saying amen. He was so surrendered to God that God could take control of his being and use him as as his voice on earth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; I believe he could use you, Brother Steve. Oh, really? He can't use you? He can't use you. He can absolutely use you. He's used you many times, by the way. Some of you don't know it, but you you you call me out of the blue or give me a scripture and I'm like, "Oh, thank the Lord. Needed that right there." I'll never forget, brother Glenn a few years back sent me a scripture. I mean, I was literally thinking along the line. Boom. Listen, I told you what happened in Peru. I'm 30,000 feet in the air above Cusco and I'm I'm studying the scripture. Isaiah 33 30-33 and I'm showing Matias and we're talking about it. Man, all of a sudden, the brother in Phoenix an hour later sends me the exact scripture. Brother Steve, read Isaiah 30-33. 33 30 to 33. What was that? Oh, it's just a brother sending a scripture to a brother. No, no, no. He was so surrendered to God in Phoenix. &gt;&gt; That God took control of his being and he became a Messiah. That's a hard saying. I know. I get it. It's hard. It's a truth nonetheless. Okay. Now, the prophet of the day is this word. &gt;&gt; Can I just say Okay, that's right. The prophet today is not all these here different. Here's a Methodist prophet, a bat prophet, Pentecostal prophet, all kinds of prophets around the cross of country, but still remains. There's one true prophet, &gt;&gt; the same yesterday, today, and forever. You got in your mind, we're all kind like, uhoh, where's my Steve going with this? That's right. Jesus Christ, and he is the word. That's right. He is the word, the anointed word of the hour. It wasn't a man. It was a man who just happened to be the chosen man of God who happened to be standing there on the river when God came and confirmed a commission. It's a hard saying, but it's true. &gt;&gt; Now, he says this. See, this is humility. Now, I'm just your brother by the grace of God. But when the angel of the Lord moves down, it then becomes a voice of God to you. Maybe it if I offend it. Well, see, some are offended. They're still offended today. They go and leave and they don't they're missing it. But hey, maybe they're not cho I'm not gonna By the way, this is an important teaching real quick. I'm way beyond. Forgive me. This is an important teaching. Don't pluck them up before their time. So, you see people leave and they get distracted and they kind of like, I'm just left. I I'm not part of it anymore. That's fine. But don't don't pull them up before their time because it might just be a moment. It might be a time. It might be an and they and God might have a way to work that back. So you don't know. Don't pluck them up before their time. It's a very important teaching. It's scriptural. Don't pull them up before their time. If they're a weed, you just let the let the fruit manifest and and God will do the the plucking up and the and the separating in his time. Okay. Now he says, see, if I offended you by saying that, forgive me. But I felt that might have been resented. But I'm God's voice to you. See, I say that again. That time was under inspiration. See, and I felt bad about the first time. But but it repeated it. Now, see, I can say nothing in myself. But what he shows me, I say it, you believe it. And watch what happened. See, he did, you know, and he goes on there. But listen, when Sister Kathleen was there and the brother was speaking, he was God's voice to Sister Kathleen. He didn't even say what he said that she what what she heard. He didn't even say. But God used a person and and took the voice that the words and and conformed them to to be what she needed. &gt;&gt; What was it? It was God speaking. &gt;&gt; It's a hard This is a hard saying right here. If you can receive this, praise God. Last one. Have the musicians come. Now, I wasn't the one. This is the last one that appeared down on the river. I was only standing there when he appeared. &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performs these things. Pay attention. We give all the glory to God. This ain't brother Steve preaching this morning. In reality, I'm if if there's a mistake made, it's me. Aside from that, I'm just trying to yield myself to God and say, "God, where do you want me to go?" Okay, listen. And fortells these things that happens as perfect they are. I'm only the one that's near when he does it. I was only a voice that he used to say it. It wasn't what I knew. It's just what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through. Notice a humility just giving it to the Lord. Listen, I'm standing here, but but it's all on the Lord. He's the one who do it. It isn't me. It wasn't the seventh angel. No, it was the manifestation of the son of man. It wasn't the angel, his message. It was the m mystery that God unfolded. It's not a man. It's God. The angel was not the was not the son of man. He was the messenger from the son of man. The son of man is Christ. He's the one that you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; There's the answer this morning. If you're listening to me and and you you felt something quicken in your spirit and you thought, man, that's truth. What it is is him. You're feeding on your feet. You're actually eating. You're eating that he you're not feeding on a man a man. His words will fail. But you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man this morning. what you fed on wasn't brother Steve's words I pray but you fed on the the words of the Lord Jesus Christ and it quickened your spirit and you go but but it also made you go oh it's a hard saying brother Steve it must make you do that it's got to be that hard because if it's not that hard it won't actually separate the goats and you want to know by the way you do want to know that you're here these are hard sayings but they're true body, word of the son of man. What you're feeding, what you eat, what you drink, when you open your Bible, and when you come to church, and when you fellowship one with another, you begin to feed on him in your brother or sister, in the Bible, in the message, in the tapes, you're actually doing feeding there. If you haven't fully fed fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to fly above all these denominations and things of the world. If you haven't full fed fully on every word. See that word will give you strength to fly above everything creeds things of the [music] world. He says will you at this time do it? Would you if you haven't fully now would you do it? I don't know why the Bible words it like this in John chapter 6. Do we have that last slide? John, this is John [music] 6 66. At this point, many of his disciples turned away and deserted him, no longer walked with him. These are hard sayings. The message it's it's it's tough, saints. It's strong [snorts] and we love it. I love it. I think we love it. We We It's hard, but we Where else are we going to go? To whom am I going to go, Brother Donald? Tell me who I'm going to. Do you believe you're led by the spirit of God? Do you believe you can surrender fully to him and become a little Messiah here on earth? Do you believe when you feed you're actually eating the body word of the son of man? Praise the Lord. Stand with me this morning. [music] On my prayer list, I have this thing. Give you a little secret. In the name of the Lord Jesus, Satan will not get a hold of this. I give you a little secret. I say, "Lord, teach me the message, the word, so that I can rightly present it to the world. If I don't know it, I can't present it. If I don't have virtue, I can't give virtue. I want him to teach me so [music] purely that I walk out of these doors and I run into somebody nominal Christian, complete unbeliever, that I know [music] exactly how to handle and present him. That's what I want. Just teach me. Amen. Take up your cross. Oh, take up your cross [music] and follow Jesus. [music] Take up your cross. [music] Don't be ashamed [music] to say that you know the cross. Take up your cross. [music and singing] Take [music] your cross and follow [music] Jesus. They [music] have everything. [music] Don't be ashamed to [music] say that you know the cross. of [music] your cross [singing] Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; All [singing and music] anywhere, King [music and singing] of Kings, Lord of Lords, right? [music and singing] And [music] throughout eternity I'm [singing] going to praise [music] him and forever [singing] more I will praise [music] you. Oh Jesus. [music and singing] Oh [music] well, [music and singing] right. [music] &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; eternity. I [singing] know his praise [music] forever [music] one more as a river. Amen. Amen. [music] I fall [singing] [music] with you. [music] [singing] There is Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Come [singing] to [music] [singing] the [music] heart. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; our holy [music and singing] one. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] [singing] And we [music] soul [music] for [music] [singing] He had the [music] master in our Merc [music and singing] [music] Oh, [music] so [music] the [singing and music] river. [music] Hallelujah. [music] the [music] mountain soul [music] of [music] his father is [music] the last [singing] [music] day [music] of God. Let us devour our heads for a moment. You should do this. I feel sweet this morning. Some of the sayings that [music] I read talked about are hard. They're different. They're especially in this day and age, they're way a strong departure from the norm. But with the spirit [music] here, he can talk to you if you don't understand something. You're having a hard time with something. He can help you to understand it. I can he can I can speak or [music] we can talk and only God can give revelation that's required. But while he's [music] here, if you have a need or if you'd like help with understanding, [snorts] [music] his heart's saying, just even believing that you're able, just slip your hand up to him. Nobody's looking around. Thank you this morning. Let's bow our heads [music] together. Heavenly Father, Lord, you saw the hands that went up [music] that didn't board you could see down into the heart of the need. And I don't doubt said [music] things that weren't correct for sure that worded differently. So I repent of that. But Lord, while your spirit's here, Lord, we don't repent of any word that was spoken. I think that's why he's pleased this [music] morning. It's your word. &gt;&gt; While he's here, Lord, would you go into hearts maybe that are struggling with understanding or need help? Would you speak to them, Lord? Would you speak to my heart [music] and give me more understanding? &gt;&gt; Help me to be able to be a good ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ here on earth. So surrendered completely to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That there's almost no difference. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lord, so that's what we desire. When people look at us, they don't see us, but [music] they see so much of the Lord Jesus Christ that they can't help but desire to be identified with him. That's being a true [music] ambassador of the Lord Jesus. Help us, Lord, to teach us and each one who's struggling with a question or a [music] hard saying, something difficult to understand. You Lord, give us grace to just believe it. If you never show us the understanding, if you desire to teach us, we want to be taught. &gt;&gt; Help us. [snorts] &gt;&gt; We desire this. Ask you to be with us. We thank you and we [music] love you. Yes, &gt;&gt; we so appreciate your word for being with us this morning. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. And if you desire to come forward this morning, the Zachary Madair the will be your nephew Donald of course grew up in and around this church and still battling from the shooting that happened last weekend and got shot recovering from that. So, somebody felt it on their heart to make [music] it a blanket. If you'd like to come down and lay hands on it, we'd love you all come down. We'll come down here and spread it out so everybody can lay a hand on it and touch [music] and send it back to him and allow not allow. Ask God to take just to take a situation. In Nehemiah, it says something like this. But Satan desired for evil, God turned it into good. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So that's what our prayer will be that Satan desiring to take our friends life, our family members [music] [music] [music] [music] of Lord, [music] yes, I do know the circumstances, a little bit of this young men, but Father, I set that aside [music] now that and I come according to your word of God, your promises, Lord, that you just [music] made to us, made known Aresh to us, Father God. Lord, what on this earth, Lord, we're called to be who you are, Father God. Lord, all we are is your hands and we're your feet. We're your mouth. We're your eyes. May the Holy Spirit of God go. And Lord, I know I'm standing next to a man and lady. The Lord has been delivered of the same thing as these young men is going through. So, Father God, just say that I know that you're [music] a prayer answer. God, I know it. I've seen and I witness that. May the Holy Spirit of God, Lord, through the compassion of your brother, your children, Lord, go and Lord Jesus, when [music] this blanket, when this young man wraps himself in this blanket, may the Holy Spirit of God not make it seem like it's not just the blanket, but may he know that [music] it's you, Father God, and may look to you, the word of God, Lord Jesus, forgetting all that's done in the past, Lord, press on to the mark of thy calling in Christ Jesus. We ask this and we ask your Holy Spirit go and bless [singing] his family and Lord Zachary make him the man that you want to be in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Lord bless you. Leave us in the song. We may be dismissed. We may rest in his presence here. I encourage you to do that. is the river that flows from [music] me. There [music and singing] is love [music] that frees my soul from sin. [music] Come [singing] to the water. [music] There is a [singing] [music] supply.

[music] His mercy and his grace had the privilege of sitting behind this [music] book for many years.

I just had to be quiet and all these years going to give him reverence. I do. I do. Truly the presence. I make a confession to the Holy Spirit. Make a [music] confession to you. Brother Steve has our resignation letters for not only trusting but soul. I ask you to forgive me and I ask God to forgive me. I'm not a quitter. I'm not going to quit. [music] God forgive me for doing that if I have hindered the moving of the Holy Spirit. But with those few little things, God knows my heart. [music] Forgive me. God forgive me. I want everything to be right. Surely the [music] presence of the Lord is in this place. Oh, surely [singing] [music] the presence [music] power.
