[7:04] Good morning. Let's stand
[7:13] songs please sir if that's okay.
[7:18] like to start with the chorus
[7:21] of the first sister Pauline
[7:25] the fourth verse of have thine own way
[7:27] Lord
[7:28] have thine own way
[7:31] pleased in the Lord
[7:34] but have thine own way Lord
[7:39] yesterday I
[7:41] spent some time with my sister
[7:44] and I say this not for an emotional
[7:46] standpoint Just I want you to all think
[7:48] about it. As you all know, she lost her
[7:52] child. A lot of you have my uncle Bob
[7:54] give us a testimony. So, it's not just
[7:57] her, but it caused you to take each day
[8:02] not only with the ones you have, but we
[8:05] have a privilege
[8:07] to come into the presence of the Holy
[8:10] Spirit, God,
[8:12] today.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; So, have thine own way, Lord. Give them
[8:17] everything. Don't Don't hold anything
[8:19] back. Don't close the doors on anything.
[8:22] Today is the only day, this moment that
[8:26] we have. So have thine own way, Lord.
[8:29] And then the fourth verse, and we'll
[8:31] turn it to brother Steve. Amen.
[8:45] Oh, have I
[8:48] always
[8:54] have I
[9:02] th
[9:10] I am the same
[9:18] in me and
[9:23] me
[9:26] after
[9:28] I
[9:34] Why
[9:36] am
[9:42] he
[9:44] sing?
[9:50] Oh, have thy own way.
[9:56] Lord
[9:58] have thy
[10:01] way.
[10:06] Oh Lord my king
[10:24] with thy spirit
[10:32] all shall
[10:39] Christy
[10:42] all
[10:53] bless you this morning. I do have an
[10:54] announcement. Won't take very long, so
[10:57] I'll leave you standing. um next Sunday
[11:02] during the morning service which is our
[11:05] questions and answers service. And if
[11:07] you have any questions
[11:09] uh there in the container in the back,
[11:12] feel free to write those questions in.
[11:14] We're going to need two services based
[11:15] on the questions that have been written
[11:16] in so far and we're going to need a lot
[11:19] of the Lord's help to answer those, but
[11:20] that'll be next Sunday. During that
[11:22] service, we're going to have a vote for
[11:25] a specific need that we are desiring or
[11:29] maybe thinking about supporting in
[11:32] Zimbabwe for sister Louisa's
[11:36] well I saw brother Caleb here, sister
[11:38] Leona, it's her aunt, sister Louisa's
[11:41] cousin or she does the work there in
[11:44] Zimbabwe and there's a need for a
[11:45] vehicle and so we're going to be voting
[11:49] uh if the church would desire to support
[11:51] that need. The trustees have already had
[11:53] a conversation about it and the deacons
[11:55] and decided to put it forth to the body.
[11:58] We we do have some information and
[12:00] there's these sheets out there as you
[12:02] walk in. Uh you can read them over and
[12:05] they answer some questions. If you have
[12:07] any more questions, feel free to reach
[12:09] out to myself or brother Donnie, one of
[12:11] the deacons.
[12:12] Um this is not a poll in any way for any
[12:16] financial help. The church has the
[12:18] funds. It's just a vote to determine if
[12:21] we want to use the funds in this manner
[12:23] and it's a large amount and so I think
[12:26] 20 to 30 plus thousand. So we just felt
[12:30] the body would uh we would present that
[12:32] to the body. Also we have a recording of
[12:36] Zoom when we did a a trip report a
[12:38] report and I'll send that to the groups
[12:41] the chat groups so you can watch that
[12:42] recording if you want to inform yourself
[12:45] a little more about the work that goes
[12:46] on in in Zimbabwe there. So that'll be
[12:48] next Sunday. Just that quick
[12:49] announcement. I don't think there was
[12:52] any prayer requests written in, but I
[12:55] know we have needs. Is there anything
[12:57] specific that we might have missed or
[12:58] failed to to write in? Sister Kathy,
[13:02] the Watley family. Remember the Watley
[13:05] family in prayer? Of course, we have
[13:08] See, Sister Karen, did Brother Glenn
[13:09] make it today? Praise the Lord. Oh,
[13:11] there you are, brother Glenn. Good to
[13:12] see. Praise the Lord. So yeah, she's w
[13:16] she's coming up, brother Glenn. So
[13:18] remember, Brother Glenn, continue to
[13:20] remember Sister Cindy and the different
[13:22] needs we have in our body. And brother
[13:24] Daryl, would you mind opening our
[13:25] service with a word of prayer? We'll
[13:27] sing this as our brother comes. Have thy
[13:31] own way.

[17:52] of deliverance.
[17:57] Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in
[18:03] you.
[18:08] I will trust in you.
[18:15] Let the weak say I
[18:21] am strong
[18:23] in the strength
[18:27] of the Lord. I will trust in you
[18:34] once again.
[18:36] You are my
[18:40] king blame.

[19:08] I will trust in you.
[19:14] Let the weak say I
[19:20] and strong
[19:23] in the strength
[19:26] of the Lord I will trust in you.
[19:36] Amen. Amen. Number 80, friendship with
[19:40] Jesus. Amen. Some of these songs you you
[19:44] may say, "Oh, they're a little bit
[19:46] older, but they're still good.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; They're what I know." Amen. Amen. You
[19:53] young people, I'm going to ask some
[19:54] friendship with Jesus. It was number 80
[19:56] in the in the book as far as that goes
[19:59] there. I'm going to ask you some
[20:00] questions, you young people. Brother
[20:02] Steve, I hope he he can correct me if
[20:04] I'm out of place here. But when you've
[20:07] heard brother Brandham talk about the
[20:09] angel of the Lord, and I guess what I'm
[20:10] trying to remind us that that it's not
[20:13] just these pews, but there's a physical
[20:15] there's something else going on. And I
[20:17] don't want us to forget that.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; But when you hear him talk about the
[20:21] angel of the Lord, what do you have in
[20:23] mind? Now, I'm not going to ask you
[20:25] questions, but I want you to think about
[20:26] it. I maybe didn't understand it. Did
[20:30] you know the prophet tells us that he
[20:34] was as real as brother Donnie was
[20:37] sitting here?
[20:40] &gt;&gt; He says he's standing here and just
[20:41] walking. I guess what I want to make you
[20:43] do is draw you conscious of these songs
[20:45] that we sing. We're not just singing
[20:47] about something way away.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; It's just one step away. And if you have
[20:52] any questions, go to demonology
[20:56] and the spiritual realm and you'll find
[20:59] that answer.
[21:01] And it's good because it makes you
[21:04] conscious. You start thinking, okay,
[21:06] brother Ryan, you can play that song. Do
[21:08] you know the song? It's uh it makes you
[21:11] conscious of whatever you're doing
[21:12] during the day. Oh,
[21:17] somebody's seeing what I'm doing.
[21:19] Somebody's watching me.
[21:21] And it makes you very conscious,
[21:24] makes you
[21:26] friendship with Jesus. And it's not to
[21:28] scare you. Please trust me. I'm not
[21:31] doing that. I'm just saying that it
[21:33] helps you grow. That's all. That's all.
[21:36] Friendship with Jesus.
[21:39] Do you not know the song, Brother Ryan?
[21:41] If you don't, we we'll go to another
[21:43] one. your
[21:46] friendship
[21:48] with Jesus.
[21:51] Oh fellowship
[21:54] divide
[21:57] and oh what blessed union

[34:30] Heat
[34:43] up
[34:47] here.
[34:56] Praise
[35:17] the Lord.
[35:19] We're not done singing yet, so just
[35:21] stand by.
[35:23] I got I got to say something this
[35:25] morning.
[35:26] As your pastor, one of my favorite
[35:28] things to do in my spirit is repent.
[35:33] And that's one of the hardest things to
[35:35] do in my flesh.
[35:37] But I I got to repent because I, Brother
[35:40] Brandham said, and brother Eddie
[35:43] Biscll's vision of the brown bear, you
[35:46] look it up online,
[35:48] he he didn't do what he was supposed to
[35:50] do.
[35:52] And then it was rain for four days and
[35:53] then he come out of praying and he said,
[35:55] "I'm the Jonah in this group." You
[35:57] remember that? I encourage you to watch.
[36:00] It's very, very interesting. And I'll
[36:02] just confess, I got in a mood last night
[36:04] over something
[36:07] and I was cranky and
[36:10] was at the late at night. Devil attacks
[36:12] me sometimes over complexes.
[36:15] I got in a mood and I really didn't get
[36:17] over it.
[36:20] So I'm the Jonah,
[36:23] &gt;&gt; but I confess it. It's over.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; And that's it.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; So I want to sing that song, Rolled
[36:32] Away.
[36:34] Rolled Away. You know that song? I had
[36:36] it up there, I think. So here's the
[36:38] thing. When you come into church, every
[36:41] one of you is bringing something.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; You are. So you bring, you know, you put
[36:46] everything aside before you get here and
[36:48] get it all out of the way and under the
[36:50] blood and then come here under
[36:52] expectation as a brother saying. And
[36:54] then we're going to sing this and then
[36:56] Sister Bethany, we'll have you I know
[36:57] she has a special. We'll have her come
[36:59] after we sing this and and brother Isaac
[37:01] will come out.
[37:03] Roll away.
[37:07] Roll away.
[37:20] Yeah.
[37:24] Heat.
[37:37] Heat. Heat.
[37:47] Yeah.
[37:50] Heat.
[38:01] Oh,
[38:10] heat,
[38:20] heat.
[38:29] Heat.
[38:32] Heat.
[38:42] Yeah.
[38:46] Heat.
[39:02] Yeah.
[39:08] Heat.
[39:18] Yeah. Heat.
[39:29] All the way.
[39:32] Oh,
[39:36] I
[39:42] may be seated.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; I've uh I've sang this song a lot, but I
[39:52] was telling him this morning, I said uh
[39:54] every time I sing it, it it means a
[39:56] little more to me. So if you know it, if
[39:58] you happen to know it, you can sing it
[39:59] with me.
[40:08] Oh, I've lost some good friends. A long
[40:13] life's way,
[40:16] some love ones departed
[40:20] in heaven to stay.
[40:23] But thank God I didn't lose everything.
[40:31] I lost faith in people
[40:35] who said they cared.
[40:39] In the times of my crisis,
[40:42] they were never there.
[40:46] Oh, through all of my struggles.
[40:50] Yeah. through all that pain.
[40:53] You see, one thing ever wed and one
[40:58] thing never change.
[41:05] I never lost my hope.
[41:12] Oh, and I never lost my joy.
[41:20] I never lost my faith,
[41:23] but most of all,
[41:27] I never lost my praise.
[41:36] Well, I've let some blessings
[41:40] slip away.
[41:43] Oh, I lost my focus.
[41:47] And I went astray.
[41:49] But thank God I didn't lose everything.
[41:57] And I've lost possessions
[42:01] that were so dear.
[42:04] Now I've lost some battles
[42:08] by walking in fear.
[42:11] Oh, but through all of those struggles.
[42:15] Yeah. through all that pain.
[42:18] You see, one thing never wavered and one
[42:23] thing never change.
[42:29] Oh, I never lost my home
[42:36] and I never lost my joy.
[42:44] I'd never lost my faith,
[42:47] but most of all,
[42:51] I never lost my praise.
[42:59] And my praise
[43:02] is still here.
[43:06] And my praise
[43:10] is still here.
[43:14] My praise
[43:17] is still here.
[43:21] Yes, my praise
[43:24] is still here. Let me ask you this
[43:28] morning, where's your praise?
[43:32] It's still here.
[43:35] Yes, my praise
[43:39] is still here. Oh, through the good and
[43:42] the bad, my praise
[43:46] is still here. Through every trial I've
[43:50] had, my praise.
[43:53] Oh, it's still here.
[43:55] And I never lost my hope.
[44:02] Oh, and I never lost my joy.
[44:09] Oh, I have lost my faith.
[44:13] But most of all,
[44:20] I never lost my praise.
[44:33] Sister Bethany, you better help us sing
[44:34] that as we stand. and we'll invite
[44:36] Brother Isaac out. Some of you might
[44:39] &gt;&gt; feel like you've lost your joy.
[44:42] You might feel like you lost your faith,
[44:44] but
[44:46] it's there.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; It could be restored.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; David said, "Restore to me so you can be
[44:52] restored." Help us lead us in that as
[44:54] Brother Isaac would come out.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; And I never lost my home.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:03] Oh, and I never lost my joy.
[45:10] I never lost my faith.
[45:14] But most of all,
[45:17] I never lost my praise.
[45:23] Oh, I never lost my home.
[45:30] Oh, I never lost my joy.
[45:38] I never lost my faith.
[45:41] But most of all,
[45:48] I never lost my praise.
[45:54] Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[45:57] clap this morning a praise.
[46:00] Amen. He's worthy of it, isn't he? Amen.
[46:03] There's that song about what am I going
[46:06] to do? I think I'll throw up my hands.
[46:08] Amen. Sometimes you get to that place
[46:09] where you just don't know what to do.
[46:12] You don't know which way to turn. Your
[46:14] back's up against a wall. Say, "What do
[46:16] I do?" He said, "I think I'll just throw
[46:18] up my hands and praise the Lord because
[46:20] when the praises go up, the glory comes
[46:22] down and he'll make a way where there
[46:24] would seem to be no way." Amen. That's
[46:27] the God that I serve this morning. And
[46:29] it's just good to be with you in the
[46:31] house of the Lord. We just want to say
[46:33] thank you to brother Steve for the
[46:34] opportunity to be here with you all. And
[46:37] uh you may have your seats just for a
[46:39] minute. Thank you musicians. So, we'll
[46:40] we won't keep you long, but just want to
[46:42] greet you and just just good to have my
[46:45] wife and little boy with me this
[46:48] morning. Um, little Spencer. And so, I
[46:52] may not know many of you personally, but
[46:54] we just love you with all our hearts,
[46:57] just part of the same body. And, uh, we
[46:59] come from Ohio there, Bluton. Um, many
[47:02] of you, I'm sure, know Brother Wayne
[47:04] Lawson. He's been out this way a few
[47:06] years ago. That's our pastor there at
[47:08] Trer Tabernacle. So, we just want to
[47:10] bring greetings from them especially.
[47:12] And so, we just uh got to know brother
[47:16] Steve better just this year. We've we've
[47:19] known him, but we got to go uh he
[47:21] reached out during the summer sometime,
[47:24] I think, and asked us about going to
[47:25] Peru with him. And so, at first, you
[47:28] know, I was like, well, I've never done
[47:30] anything like that. So, that's a that's
[47:33] a big trip. I I've been overseas, but
[47:35] never to a third world country like
[47:37] that. And so it was a first time first
[47:40] type of that kind of trip for me. And so
[47:42] I just want to say thank you as a church
[47:44] for supporting that work. Um we just
[47:47] just just a little bit we've been
[47:48] involved. We see the fruit coming out of
[47:51] it. Uh I wasn't there for the whole
[47:52] time, but I know several were baptized
[47:54] in some of the places they went to and I
[47:57] just got to meet so many wonderful
[47:58] people myself as we uh landed in Lima
[48:02] there. Um just to see that type of that
[48:06] type of country. I say, "Lord, may may
[48:08] we never take for granted the things
[48:10] that we have, just everything barred up
[48:13] and crime and people being murdered and
[48:16] yet they come and gather and just
[48:18] worship the Lord." I thought, "What an
[48:20] amazing thing." And so, we had a
[48:22] wonderful time there. We had a good
[48:23] meeting there in Lima and then we would
[48:26] fly over to Aquitos there on the river
[48:29] and just just poverty, you know, and
[48:32] just hardly any cars just driving around
[48:35] in the rain on their motorbikes. And I'm
[48:37] sure you all seen many pictures and
[48:40] videos over the years with brother Steve
[48:42] being there. But we just go and there
[48:44] was a lady in her house that couldn't
[48:46] hardly walk. She couldn't get to church.
[48:48] So we just went there to pray for her
[48:50] and just just just the heart. But yet
[48:53] when they would come to church, they
[48:54] wouldn't hardly have any music. They
[48:56] wouldn't hardly have anything. And they
[48:57] were just so happy just to just to
[48:59] worship and just to hear the word
[49:01] preached. It was just a wonderful time.
[49:04] And uh we had two services there.
[49:06] Brother Isaac Robson spoke one and I
[49:09] spoke one and just just wonderful
[49:12] wonderful experience for me just to see
[49:14] that. And uh and then the last place I
[49:17] would get to go would be up the river to
[49:20] that little Timuro village. And that's
[49:22] where I started to question Brother
[49:24] Steve
[49:26] said, "Brother, I'm trying to have
[49:27] faith." But that's a little tiny boat
[49:30] going up that river. I said, "Are you
[49:32] sure? I'm trying." And so, but but it
[49:35] wasn't it wasn't so bad once we actually
[49:37] did it. He it was it was all under
[49:39] control and we had the Lord watching
[49:40] over us. But but uh sometimes maybe it
[49:44] takes the greater sacrifice to get into
[49:46] those areas where the people are really
[49:49] really needy and really hungry. And so
[49:51] that was even though that was maybe the
[49:54] most uncomfortable part physically, it
[49:56] was probably the most impactful part for
[49:58] me just to see those people just 30 40
[50:01] people showed up in another boat and
[50:03] they're just babies and they're bringing
[50:05] music and they're hugging and crying.
[50:08] and they some of them I think hadn't
[50:09] seen each other in maybe 10 years just
[50:12] to gather and have a meeting like that.
[50:14] They were just weeping and rejoicing and
[50:16] just so thankful and I just I was so
[50:20] blessed. And there was a deacon there
[50:22] that was working for for years. He had
[50:26] been clearing a area in the jungle and
[50:29] planting the cacao or caco uh in bananas
[50:32] trying to just make a little bit money
[50:35] of money to start a radio station to
[50:37] spread the message. Just working I think
[50:40] hours a day just to just to get some
[50:42] extra money to spread the message. And I
[50:44] when you see that it's just it's just
[50:46] strikes your heart. You can't you can't
[50:48] not be touched by that. So it was just a
[50:51] wonderful experience for me. We had
[50:53] wonderful meetings and uh it just put a
[50:56] burden in my heart for uh to to see
[50:58] souls saved of course in those type of
[51:00] countries but also to see them
[51:02] established in the word just to go in
[51:04] there and just preach the message and
[51:06] see them grow and be established in the
[51:09] word for our day. And I so I just want
[51:11] to say God bless you as a church. God
[51:13] bless your pastor. Amen. For the work
[51:15] that you're doing there. Amen. So if you
[51:17] could just stand again with me. Amen.
[51:20] speaking about that
[51:22] commission to go in all the world and
[51:24] preach the gospel. And this morning, I'd
[51:27] like to speak a bit on commission. So,
[51:29] we're going to turn to Joshua, the first
[51:31] chapter. Just trying to find the mind of
[51:34] the Lord. So, we just pray the Lord give
[51:36] us grace that he would just lead us.
[51:40] We'll turn to Joshua the first chapter.
[51:43] And just before we read that, if you
[51:45] have a need on your heart, maybe we
[51:47] could just bow our heads for a word of
[51:48] prayer.
[51:49] as we go into the word this morning.
[51:52] Lord Jesus, I just want to say thank
[51:54] you, Father.
[51:56] Lord, I want to say thank you for
[51:57] gathering us into your house this
[51:59] morning, Lord.
[52:01] Father, when you were here on the earth,
[52:04] Lord, you commanded your disciples to go
[52:07] and get a cult for you. You said it
[52:09] would be tied up in this certain place.
[52:12] And many people criticized it, Father,
[52:14] thinking, Lord, that it was pre-arranged
[52:17] by man. But, Father, it wasn't
[52:18] pre-arranged by man. It was pre-arranged
[52:21] by an infinite, all- knowing God. Lord,
[52:24] you pre-arranged a young boy to have
[52:27] five loaves and two fishes to come by
[52:29] that way that day that you could feed
[52:31] your hungry children. Father, I believe
[52:34] you've pre-arranged this meeting. I
[52:36] believe you've pre-arranged our lives. I
[52:38] believe, Lord, that Lord, sometimes,
[52:41] Lord, we think something's going wrong,
[52:43] but Lord, you're you're guiding us.
[52:46] You're leading us. You're making a way
[52:48] that Lord, we might miss an accident on
[52:50] the way to church and that you might
[52:52] keep us and shield us, Father. And I
[52:54] want to say this morning, we trust you,
[52:56] Lord. And I want to invite you into this
[52:58] service, Father, and pray that you have
[53:00] your way. Pray that you settle every
[53:02] nerve. I pray you close our lips from
[53:05] speaking anything contrary to your will
[53:07] and open them to speak your word only.
[53:09] And when it's all said and done, may you
[53:11] receive the glory in Jesus name. Amen.
[53:14] Amen.
[53:16] Joshua 1, we'll read the first nine
[53:17] verses. A very familiar passage. Says,
[53:20] "Now after the death of Moses, the
[53:22] servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[53:25] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[53:27] of Nun. Moses minister, saying, Moses,
[53:30] my servant, is dead. Now therefore arise
[53:32] and go over this Jordan, thou and all
[53:34] this people unto the land which I do
[53:36] give to them, even to the children of
[53:39] Israel. and every place that the sole of
[53:41] your foot shall tread upon. That have I
[53:44] given unto you, as I said, unto Moses,
[53:47] from the wilderness in this Lebanon,
[53:49] even unto the great river, the river
[53:50] Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
[53:54] unto the great sea, toward the going
[53:55] down of the sun, shall be your coast.
[53:58] There shall not any man be able to stand
[54:00] before thee all the days of thy life. As
[54:02] I was with Moses, so I will be with
[54:04] thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake
[54:06] thee. So be strong and of a good
[54:08] courage, for unto this people shalt thou
[54:10] divide for an inheritance the land which
[54:12] I swear unto their fathers to give them.
[54:15] Only be thou strong and very courageous
[54:17] that thou mayest observe to do according
[54:19] to all the law which Moses my servant
[54:21] commanded thee. Turn not from it to the
[54:23] right hand or the left that thou mayest
[54:25] prosper whethersoever thou goest. in
[54:28] this book of the law shall not depart
[54:30] out of thy mouth, but thou shalt
[54:32] meditate therein day and night, that
[54:34] thou mayest observe to do according to
[54:37] all that is written therein. For then
[54:39] thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and
[54:40] then thou shalt have good success. Have
[54:42] not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a
[54:45] good courage. Be not dismayed, be not
[54:47] afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for
[54:49] the Lord thy God is with thee,
[54:50] whethersoever thou goest. Amen. You may
[54:53] have your seats this morning. And uh if
[54:57] we could speak on a a title out of that
[55:00] this morning, we'd like to speak on
[55:01] commissioned for the job. Commissioned
[55:03] for the job. You see, Joshua was called
[55:07] to fulfill. Uh he was called to step
[55:09] into the tracks that Moses had stood.
[55:12] And brother Brandon would say it was no
[55:13] easy task. And brother Brandon would
[55:16] also say that I think of a minister
[55:18] today that's called of God to step into
[55:20] the tracks where Jesus stood. What a
[55:22] command. What a what a commission. And
[55:24] then he wouldn't just leave it on the
[55:26] ministers, but he would say, "But each
[55:27] that's called of God is commissioned to
[55:29] stand in that same place. I'll be with
[55:32] you, even in you to the end of the way."
[55:34] And he said, "How it must have felt for
[55:36] Joshua to talk to God that morning and
[55:39] receive this great commission that he
[55:41] would have to step into the tracks where
[55:43] Moses stood and to fulfill the shoes of
[55:46] this prophet." And what a warrior he
[55:49] was. No. Amen. No, no, no man like that
[55:52] man in that time. He was a prophet.
[55:54] Amen. Amen. A a wonderful prophet that
[55:57] was called and commissioned to bring the
[55:59] children out of Israel. And Joshua was
[56:01] commanded to step in the tracks where
[56:03] Moses had stood and fulfill the
[56:06] commission to take the children into the
[56:08] land. Amen. Moses was called to bring
[56:10] them out. Moses was commissioned by God
[56:13] to deliver the people, but he tried to
[56:15] fulfill that commission. Amen. In his
[56:18] own humanity. And of course, that's
[56:19] where his great failure would be because
[56:22] he tried to deliver the people before
[56:24] going to that burning bush. Is that
[56:26] right? And he made a great failure in
[56:28] his humanity. Amen. And he had to go
[56:31] back to that burning bush and meet a
[56:33] living God. And then he could go back
[56:35] into Egypt and it would be a one-man
[56:37] invasion. Is that right? Amen. One man.
[56:40] He said it would be like somebody trying
[56:42] to take over Russia today as one man.
[56:45] That's what it was like. Moses going
[56:46] down into Egypt as one man. But he had
[56:50] got the confirmation of the commission.
[56:53] Amen. And that's what we have to do
[56:55] today. Just like Jesus commanded the
[56:57] disciples in Mark 16 that you shall lay
[57:00] your hands on the sick and they shall
[57:01] recover. You shall go into all the world
[57:03] and preach the gospel. But before you
[57:05] go, go up to Pentecost and receive the
[57:08] confirmation of the commission, the
[57:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost. You must get
[57:13] the seal of your commission. You must go
[57:15] and stay until you're endued from power
[57:18] with power from on high. And then I will
[57:21] write behind you. It won't be the acts
[57:24] of the apostles, but it will be the acts
[57:26] of the Holy Spirit in the apostles. Is
[57:29] that right? And that's what he's doing
[57:30] today behind a bride. He's saying it, I
[57:33] mean, I'm not going to write it behind
[57:34] just a a letter church. I'm not going to
[57:37] write it behind just a a people and
[57:38] their humanity, but I'll put my Holy
[57:41] Spirit in you and then I'll write
[57:42] another book of Acts behind my people
[57:44] because it won't be them doing it. Amen.
[57:46] But it'll be my spirit in them. Is that
[57:48] right, brother Rolando? Amen. It It's
[57:50] not us. Amen. You are just like a sheep
[57:53] that puts forth wool. You are not called
[57:55] to manufacture. You are only called to
[57:57] bear the Christian walk. Amen. And when
[58:00] the Holy Spirit comes in you, brother,
[58:01] it takes the pressure off because I
[58:03] mean, you are no longer trying to
[58:05] manufacture anything. But when you ever
[58:07] catch the revelation of who you are,
[58:09] you'll know that you are only supposed
[58:11] to manifest what God has called you to
[58:13] do because that's what the world is
[58:15] groaning for. It's not the
[58:17] manufacturing, but it's the
[58:18] manifestation of sons and daughters of
[58:21] God. Amen. You are called to manifest
[58:23] the very life of Jesus Christ. Amen. so
[58:26] much until it will be so close to the
[58:28] ministry that Jesus had on earth until
[58:31] it will call the saints out of the
[58:33] grave. How could we do it, brother or
[58:35] sister? We could not do it. Amen. But
[58:37] when his spirit comes in you and you
[58:39] say, "Lord, Amen. Let me manifest your
[58:41] life and then it pushes out." Amen. Just
[58:44] like the tree pushes out new leaves in
[58:47] the springtime. Amen. You don't have to
[58:49] go out there and pluck the old leaves
[58:51] off. Amen. And say, "Tree, it's time
[58:53] that you bring forth new leaves." But
[58:55] it's a law that's written in nature that
[58:58] causes the tree to bring forth new life.
[59:01] Oh, amen. That's why we have confidence
[59:03] as ministry that if we can just get the
[59:05] people to the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[59:08] then we won't have to beat them over the
[59:09] head with a stick. Then we won't have to
[59:11] bring out a tape measure every week and
[59:13] say, "Are you living like you should?"
[59:15] Amen. We believe in holiness. We believe
[59:17] in standards. We believe in preaching a
[59:19] closline religion. But what we really
[59:21] believe in is letting the Holy Ghost
[59:23] loose in the church. Amen. And then we
[59:25] won't have to sit and babysit him every
[59:27] day. Amen. But the tree will bring forth
[59:30] new leaves and manifest the life of
[59:32] Jesus Christ the way that it should.
[59:35] Amen. You must go and get the
[59:37] credentials. You've got no right to call
[59:39] yourself a preacher or even a Christian
[59:42] without those credentials. Amen. If
[59:44] you're going to join the army, you need
[59:46] your papers. You can't just go down and
[59:48] buy a 10- cent a uniform from the 10-
[59:51] cent store. As brother Brandon would
[59:52] say, you need your papers. Amen. You
[59:55] must Amen. Just like at our work, we I
[59:57] work at an office where you have to
[59:58] badge in and they give us special safety
[1:00:01] training. It's called piggybacking where
[1:00:04] people will try to get in on your badge.
[1:00:07] Amen. But that won't work in the kingdom
[1:00:09] of God. You've got to get your own
[1:00:10] badge. Amen. You've got to get your own
[1:00:12] credentials. Amen. You've got to get
[1:00:14] your own Amen. confirmation. You've got
[1:00:16] to get into that presence that Moses got
[1:00:19] in. And that presence will change you.
[1:00:22] Amen. It's that presence that Peter got
[1:00:24] in that took him from a coward to a
[1:00:26] preacher to preach the gospel with an
[1:00:28] authority and with a confidence. Amen.
[1:00:31] Because the problem is with people
[1:00:33] wouldn't get that commission. And
[1:00:35] brother Brandon would say they would try
[1:00:36] to get by with an ordination paper but
[1:00:38] not the seal of God. And that's when
[1:00:40] they would deny the very power of God.
[1:00:43] They would deny because the Bible says
[1:00:45] these signs shall follow them that
[1:00:46] believe. Right? So when he said when you
[1:00:48] see people denying those signs and
[1:00:51] denying that power, it shows, Amen, that
[1:00:53] they're denying the very confirmation of
[1:00:55] the commission, amen, that they're
[1:00:57] supposed to have. It shows that they
[1:00:59] don't have the confirmation, but they
[1:01:01] have just an ordination paper or a
[1:01:05] church letter or something on that
[1:01:06] accord. Amen. Because the Bible said
[1:01:08] many will come unto me in that day and
[1:01:10] say, "Have not I done this and have not
[1:01:12] done that?" And he would say, "Depart
[1:01:14] from me, ye that work iniquity. I never
[1:01:16] even knew you." Amen. Because it's like
[1:01:19] brother Steve was a police officer. It's
[1:01:22] like somebody trying to impersonate a
[1:01:24] police officer and say, "Well, I've done
[1:01:26] this and I've done that." But but they
[1:01:27] never went and got the training. They
[1:01:29] never went and got the badge. They never
[1:01:31] went Amen. Amen. They they never clocked
[1:01:34] into the job. Amen. And you can do a lot
[1:01:37] of work for the Lord. Amen. And it'll
[1:01:40] never it'll never return unto you in the
[1:01:43] investment because you didn't clock in.
[1:01:45] Amen. Depart from me ye that work
[1:01:47] iniquity. You never clocked in. You
[1:01:49] never went and got the seal of the
[1:01:51] commission. But if you clocked in, Amen.
[1:01:53] If you got the Holy Ghost, then brother,
[1:01:55] you can work for the Lord and he will
[1:01:57] repay you a hundfold, a thousandfold.
[1:02:01] Everything that you forsake for this
[1:02:03] gospel will re it will be repaid unto
[1:02:06] you. Amen. You can forsake houses and
[1:02:08] lands. You can leave mother and father.
[1:02:11] Amen. You can forsake everything. Amen.
[1:02:13] Sometimes you have to root up and leave
[1:02:15] everything you know for the sake of the
[1:02:17] gospel. But God said, "I will not leave
[1:02:19] you there. I will repay you a
[1:02:21] thousandfold. I will not say depart from
[1:02:24] me that work iniquity because you're
[1:02:25] mine. Because you're my seed. because
[1:02:27] you came from the back part of my mind
[1:02:30] and you're willing to follow my
[1:02:32] commission. Amen. Amen. And and it
[1:02:35] wasn't for everybody. Not everybody
[1:02:37] could go up to that upper room. Judas
[1:02:40] couldn't go up to that upper room
[1:02:41] because it wasn't in him. Brother Bram
[1:02:43] said that's where he showed his true
[1:02:44] colors was at Pentecost. Amen. That's
[1:02:47] why the scripture would say, "Don't
[1:02:49] rejoice that demons are subject to you
[1:02:51] because Judas was casting them out the
[1:02:53] same as the rest of them." But he said,
[1:02:54] "Rejoice that your name is written in
[1:02:57] heaven." That's the reason to rejoice
[1:02:59] this morning. If you have seen your name
[1:03:01] on the book in heaven, then brother,
[1:03:03] it's time to rejoice. It's time for the
[1:03:06] church to rejoice that has recognized,
[1:03:08] amen, that my name is written in heaven
[1:03:11] and there's not enough devils in hell,
[1:03:13] amen, to take it off. And I like
[1:03:15] something that Brother Wayne says about
[1:03:16] that book. He said, "It was your name
[1:03:18] written in there and it was only your
[1:03:21] name written in there. Your works are
[1:03:23] not recorded in that book. Amen. Your
[1:03:25] bad days are not recorded in that book,
[1:03:27] brother. Your hard days, mother. Your
[1:03:30] long nights, amen, where you're
[1:03:31] struggling, Amen, to to keep it together
[1:03:34] and you're struggling, amen, to not
[1:03:36] break down, amen, that is not recorded
[1:03:38] in that book. But what's recorded in
[1:03:40] that book is God saw you before the
[1:03:43] foundation of the world and chose you to
[1:03:45] be his son or his daughter. Amen. And he
[1:03:48] commissioned you, Amen, for this job.
[1:03:51] Amen. And it wasn't for everybody, but
[1:03:53] it was for the 120 that said, "Amen,
[1:03:56] come up to this upper room." And after
[1:03:59] they came up, Peter would preach a
[1:04:01] message that it's for you. It's for your
[1:04:03] children, and it's for as many as the
[1:04:06] Lord our God shall call. That's why I
[1:04:09] can say it might not be for everybody,
[1:04:11] but it's for me. Amen. Because I feel
[1:04:13] the calling on my life calling me. It's
[1:04:16] called me to a new birth. Amen. Brother
[1:04:19] Brandon would say about Rahab, you apply
[1:04:21] the token, it's for you. If you feel in
[1:04:24] your heart there is something tugging,
[1:04:26] it's for you and you apply the token.
[1:04:29] Amen. It's a promise, friends. Blessed
[1:04:31] are they which hunger and thirst after
[1:04:33] righteousness, for they shall be filled.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Not they might be filled, they shall be
[1:04:39] filled. It didn't say when you would be
[1:04:41] filled, but it said you shall be filled.
[1:04:43] If you bless, Amen. If you hunger or
[1:04:46] thirst after righteousness, you're
[1:04:47] blessed to even have that hunger. Amen.
[1:04:50] This morning, if you hunger for more
[1:04:52] God, I say you're blessed. If you're
[1:04:54] hungering for a deeper walk with God,
[1:04:57] you say, "Brother Isaac, I don't know
[1:04:58] how I'm going to get there, but I say
[1:05:00] you're blessed just to hunger because
[1:05:02] it's the deep calling to the deep." If
[1:05:04] there's a deep calling for more of God,
[1:05:07] there is a deep to respond. And it
[1:05:09] wouldn't be in your heart unless there
[1:05:11] was more of God to have. And when some
[1:05:13] of you may be hungering for revival,
[1:05:15] some of you are hungering for a fresh
[1:05:17] baptism in your lives. Some of you are
[1:05:19] hungering for your family to be set on
[1:05:22] fire, a new for the gospel. And I say
[1:05:25] you wouldn't hunger if the skies were
[1:05:27] not full of the Pentecostal blessing.
[1:05:30] But I say it's here. It's here this
[1:05:32] morning. The skies are here. Amen.
[1:05:34] clouds are full of the abundance of rain
[1:05:37] ready to be poured out upon those Amen.
[1:05:39] that are hungering and thirsting for
[1:05:42] more of God. Amen. If you hunger and
[1:05:44] thirst, it's for you. The devil will try
[1:05:46] to tell you it's not for you. He'll try
[1:05:49] to tell you, "Well, brother, you send
[1:05:50] away your day of grace." Amen. You've
[1:05:52] gone too far. Amen. There's no way you
[1:05:55] could ever receive this. But I say it's
[1:05:57] a lie from the devil. Amen. If you still
[1:06:00] Amen. He said, "If you had sent away
[1:06:02] your day of grace, you would hate God."
[1:06:04] Amen. But you don't hate God. You love
[1:06:06] him. And that proves, Amen, that it's a
[1:06:08] lie that you have not sent away your day
[1:06:10] of grace. But it's a spirit trying to
[1:06:12] keep you from fulfilling your commission
[1:06:15] by twisting the word and manipulating
[1:06:17] the word. And he'll use the word to
[1:06:19] attack you just like he did Satan. It is
[1:06:22] written. It is written. You send away
[1:06:24] your day grace. Well, the Bible does say
[1:06:26] that some would send away their day
[1:06:28] grace, so it must be me. But he's
[1:06:29] twisting that word. But what do you
[1:06:32] respond, Satan? It is also written. It
[1:06:35] is also written. And you take that word
[1:06:37] and you fight that devil until you break
[1:06:40] out of that prison house and come into
[1:06:42] the truth over your life. And the truth
[1:06:45] is that it's for you.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam say you're sitting in a
[1:06:49] sermon. You're sitting in church and you
[1:06:51] feel sometimes that weight. You feel
[1:06:53] that pressure. Amen. And it's not
[1:06:55] anything wrong with the people, but it's
[1:06:57] a spirit at work. a spirit of unbelief
[1:06:59] trying to pull down the minds to try to
[1:07:02] make them think that they can't receive
[1:07:03] it. But brother Bham said this. He said
[1:07:05] if a person is, he said it's pulling
[1:07:08] right down with disbelief. You see, and
[1:07:09] I can feel that and tell it. Yes, sir.
[1:07:12] It makes it hard. But then if a person
[1:07:14] is really believing, they're pulling in
[1:07:16] the spirit of God because it's the word
[1:07:17] of God. We all know that. And if the
[1:07:20] devil can just put a question mark
[1:07:21] across there, he's got you.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. He said, "But when
[1:07:26] you erase that question mark and say
[1:07:28] that's every bit true and it's for me,
[1:07:30] then you're pulling from God." Amen. Why
[1:07:33] don't we exercise it this morning? Why
[1:07:35] don't you say it's for me? Amen. The
[1:07:37] Holy Ghost is for me. Amen. Joy is for
[1:07:40] me. Peace is for me. Amen. A fresh
[1:07:43] baptism is for me. A refilling of the
[1:07:45] Holy Ghost is for me. You say, "Brother
[1:07:47] Isaac, I've tried and I've tried and I
[1:07:49] just can't seem to break past that
[1:07:51] barrier. It must not be for me." Brother
[1:07:53] Bram said that's Satan trying to keep
[1:07:55] you from the blessing because every time
[1:07:57] that God is bringing a visitation, Satan
[1:08:00] will always try to stop the oncoming
[1:08:03] visitation. Amen. He'll try to bring
[1:08:05] Amen. A Sunday mornings are a perfect
[1:08:07] example. Maybe you were fighting on the
[1:08:09] way to church this morning. Maybe you
[1:08:10] were in the car and there was a little
[1:08:12] friction there. Amen. Between husband
[1:08:14] and wife or between mother and child,
[1:08:17] amen, but Satan is only trying to do
[1:08:19] that to block the oncoming visitation.
[1:08:21] Amen. But Satan cannot stop. Amen. What
[1:08:24] God has promised in this hour. He
[1:08:26] doesn't have enough. Amen. To stop it
[1:08:29] because he is true to his word. Amen. If
[1:08:32] you are called to receive the new birth,
[1:08:35] you never sought God. But God sought
[1:08:37] after you.
[1:08:39] And brother Brandon would say, "A true
[1:08:40] hunger will take you to Pentecost
[1:08:43] because creeds won't satisfy a hungry
[1:08:45] heart. You were predestinated to search
[1:08:48] for life." Oh my. I can witness to that.
[1:08:52] I remember when I was a young younger
[1:08:54] boy and when I would sit in my bedroom
[1:08:57] and I would just weep under the Lord.
[1:08:59] Say, "Lord, I need a reality. I need
[1:09:01] more than a tradition. I need more than
[1:09:04] a religion. I need more than a joining a
[1:09:07] church or sitting in a pew. Lord, I need
[1:09:08] a reality." Something was in me that
[1:09:11] wouldn't be satisfied with the creed.
[1:09:13] Amen. But that something that was there
[1:09:15] led me into a new birth. And I say,
[1:09:18] "Lord, I'm satisfied." Amen. That's what
[1:09:21] I was longing for. That's what I was
[1:09:23] hungering after. I was predestinated to
[1:09:26] search for life. Amen. That's what makes
[1:09:29] us excited this morning. Amen. That's
[1:09:31] what makes us sing and shout and dance
[1:09:33] and rejoice. Amen. It's not just the
[1:09:36] music that makes us happy. But we love
[1:09:38] good music, don't we, brother Rolando?
[1:09:40] Amen. But it's more than that. It's more
[1:09:42] than a creed. It's more than a custom.
[1:09:44] It's something way down in the depths of
[1:09:46] your soul that is connected to heaven. A
[1:09:49] deep calling to the deep. Amen. Brother
[1:09:52] Brandon was out there in the woods that
[1:09:53] one time dancing around that tree and he
[1:09:55] said, "You can call it emotions if you
[1:09:57] want to, but to me it was the deep
[1:09:59] calling to the deep." Amen. It it it's
[1:10:03] more than a custom. It's Amen. It is
[1:10:06] something like that boy that was flying
[1:10:08] that kite that was connected to that
[1:10:11] kite way up in the air, but he could
[1:10:12] feel the tug of it. Oh, and if you're a
[1:10:15] son or daughter of God, there's a tug in
[1:10:17] your heart. Amen. And I don't care how
[1:10:20] lost you go in sin or how deep you go in
[1:10:23] the muck of this world. That tug will
[1:10:25] never leave you if you are amen from the
[1:10:28] mind of God because he's filtered you
[1:10:31] for the job.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you ever had a job interview?
[1:10:37] Amen. And they filter through all the
[1:10:39] candidates and if they choose you mean
[1:10:43] it wasn't because of some accident. They
[1:10:45] don't I don't as far as I know they
[1:10:46] don't take the papers and throw them up
[1:10:48] in the air and pick a random one, but
[1:10:50] they choose who's the best fit for the
[1:10:52] job. And you can try to run from that
[1:10:55] calling like Moses did and like Jonah
[1:10:58] did and like like like many men of God
[1:11:01] have did. But if he's called you, he's
[1:11:04] called you for a reason and he's
[1:11:05] filtered you for that position and no
[1:11:07] one can take your place. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:10] Amen. Brother Bram said, "He has chosen
[1:11:12] us or the Bible said he's chosen us in
[1:11:14] him before the foundation of the world
[1:11:16] according to his good pleasure." I mean,
[1:11:19] it pleased him to choose you. Amen.
[1:11:22] That's why when you go to the store, I
[1:11:24] mean, if it's your birthday, somebody
[1:11:25] can buy you a gift. Is that right? And
[1:11:28] you and you can put on your best smile
[1:11:30] and say, "Wow, man, I've always wanted
[1:11:31] that." And you might not you might put
[1:11:33] it on the shelf and never use it again
[1:11:36] because uh because you didn't choose it.
[1:11:38] But if they give you money and you go to
[1:11:40] the store and you purchase something,
[1:11:41] you're going to choose something that
[1:11:43] you need. You're going to choose
[1:11:44] something that you want. And that's what
[1:11:46] God did with us. He chose us according
[1:11:49] to his good pleasure. He didn't have to
[1:11:52] choose you, but he saw something in you,
[1:11:54] Amen, that he didn't see in the rest of
[1:11:56] the world. He knew that you would desire
[1:11:59] to be saved. He knew that you would
[1:12:01] desire, amen, that that life, that
[1:12:04] reality. And so he chose you in him
[1:12:06] before the foundation of the world. Why
[1:12:09] could Jockabed look upon Moses as a
[1:12:11] young boy and say he's a goodly child?
[1:12:14] He just came out of the womb. He was he
[1:12:17] was fresh to the earth. I mean, he
[1:12:18] hadn't done anything good. Maybe he was
[1:12:20] born in sin, but his mother could say
[1:12:22] he's a goodly child because not because
[1:12:25] of who he was, but because God had chose
[1:12:27] him. He was a goodly child because God
[1:12:30] had predestinated him. And gifts and
[1:12:33] callings are without repentance. Amen.
[1:12:36] The prophets are born prophets. Is that
[1:12:38] right? Jesus, he was the son of God from
[1:12:41] before the foundation of the world.
[1:12:44] Amen. Amen. Amen. Jeremiah was ordained
[1:12:46] to be a prophet before he was ever in
[1:12:48] his mother's womb. And John the Baptist
[1:12:51] 712 years before he was born. Amen.
[1:12:54] Isaiah prophesied that he was a voice in
[1:12:57] the wilderness crying, "Prepare ye the
[1:12:59] way for the Lord." Lord, but brother
[1:13:01] Brandham said if they're ed, he said so
[1:13:03] was all those offices of God if they're
[1:13:06] called of God. If they're educated into
[1:13:08] it, it's only canon fodder. It can't be
[1:13:11] nothing. It's a meal ticket. You sell
[1:13:13] your birthrights for a meal ticket. And
[1:13:15] then he says, "But if it's of God,
[1:13:17] you'll stand by that word because you
[1:13:18] were born to stand by it." Amen. And no
[1:13:21] one else can take your place if you were
[1:13:24] ordained for that position.
[1:13:26] Amen. No one else can take your place.
[1:13:28] If God's called you, he's chosen you.
[1:13:31] Amen. As the Bible says, Jacob have I
[1:13:33] loved and Esau have I hated. It says,
[1:13:36] "For he saith unto Moses, I will have
[1:13:38] mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I
[1:13:40] will have compassion on whom I will have
[1:13:43] compassion." So it's not of him that
[1:13:45] willth or him that runth, but God that
[1:13:47] showeth mercy. And then he switches to
[1:13:50] Pharaoh and says, "For the scripture
[1:13:52] saith unto Pharaoh, even for the same
[1:13:54] purpose have I raised thee up, that I
[1:13:56] might show my power in thee, and that my
[1:13:58] name might be declared throughout all
[1:14:00] the earth. Therefore, he hath mercy on
[1:14:02] whom he will have mercy, and whom he
[1:14:04] will, he hardeneth." Amen. That's why
[1:14:07] brother Brand would say, "Esau tried to
[1:14:09] find a place to get right with God."
[1:14:11] Pharaoh tried to repent and get right
[1:14:13] with God, but they couldn't do it
[1:14:15] because that was their allotment. Amen.
[1:14:17] Because God before the foundation of the
[1:14:20] world, he predestinates us according to
[1:14:22] his fornowledge.
[1:14:24] Amen. His fornowledge. He's not just
[1:14:26] spinning a wheel and choosing. But by
[1:14:28] his fornowledge, he could predestinate
[1:14:30] you and say, "Jacob have I loved and
[1:14:33] Esau have I hated." Amen. That's why
[1:14:35] there's a story in the Bible about how
[1:14:37] Ahab wanted to go up to Ramoth Gilead
[1:14:40] and conquer. Amen. And and everybody was
[1:14:43] telling him, "Go ahead. Go ahead and do
[1:14:45] it." Amen. You're going to be
[1:14:46] successful. You're going to conquer.
[1:14:48] You're going to be blessed. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:50] Because I believe it was Elijah had
[1:14:52] prophesied that the dogs would lick up
[1:14:54] his blood. And so that prophecy had to
[1:14:57] be fulfilled. So God said, "Who can we
[1:15:00] who can we send to get into these
[1:15:02] prophets to deceive Ahab to go up to
[1:15:04] Ramoth Gilead?" And a lying spirit came
[1:15:07] out of hell and got into those 400
[1:15:09] preachers and said, "You should go up to
[1:15:12] Ramoth Gilead and prosper." Amen.
[1:15:14] because it was prophesied that he would
[1:15:16] be deceived. Amen. But Amen. But I'll
[1:15:18] say this that Satan cannot get to you
[1:15:21] like that lying spirit got into those
[1:15:23] preachers because God got to you before
[1:15:25] Satan could ever get to you. Oh,
[1:15:28] brother. Amen. Satan got to first Eve
[1:15:30] before Adam could get to her. But God
[1:15:33] got to the second Eve before Satan could
[1:15:36] ever get to you. And where were you?
[1:15:38] Amen, Job. Before the foundation of the
[1:15:41] world, when morning stars sang for
[1:15:43] glory, I was up there getting my
[1:15:45] commission. Before the foundation of the
[1:15:47] world, it said, "You will go down to
[1:15:49] this earth and you will be an overcoming
[1:15:51] son in Leodysia." And no matter what
[1:15:54] Satan tries to do in this dark age, he
[1:15:56] cannot change what God has done in
[1:15:59] eternity when he called you before the
[1:16:02] foundation of the world and
[1:16:03] predestinated you to be a son or
[1:16:05] daughter of God. Amen. It looked like he
[1:16:08] could have sent somebody else, but
[1:16:09] brother Ryan, he can't send somebody
[1:16:11] else. Amen. Brother Brandham said it
[1:16:13] looked like he could have sent another
[1:16:14] prophet, but he ordained Jonah.
[1:16:17] And Elijah wouldn't have done. Jeremiah
[1:16:20] wouldn't have done. Moses wouldn't have
[1:16:22] done. It was Jonah had to go to Nineveh.
[1:16:25] That's all there was to it. He
[1:16:26] commissioned him and told him to go. And
[1:16:29] when he says, "Go there, Jonah. Go to
[1:16:30] Nineveh." Nobody else can do that but
[1:16:32] Jonah. And when God tells you something,
[1:16:35] you've got to do it. See, we just might
[1:16:38] we just have to face up to it and go do
[1:16:40] it. And then he would say, "No one can
[1:16:43] take your place." And you're
[1:16:45] peculiarity.
[1:16:46] You say, "Why am I so weird, Brother
[1:16:48] Isaac? Join the club." Amen. He said,
[1:16:52] "You're a chosen generation,
[1:16:55] a holy priesthood, a priesthood, a
[1:16:57] peculiar people." Amen. And we're a
[1:17:00] peculiar people, but we're a chosen
[1:17:02] people. Can you imagine, brother
[1:17:04] Brandon, when he was here on the earth
[1:17:07] and he was just wanted to go hunting
[1:17:08] with his friends and he would try to
[1:17:11] sight in his rifle and it would try to
[1:17:13] it had to hit the mark every single time
[1:17:16] or else he would sit there. And he said
[1:17:18] while all his other friends were out
[1:17:20] there happily hunting squirrels, he was
[1:17:22] leaning against that tree weeping
[1:17:24] because he couldn't get his gun to shoot
[1:17:27] in the same place every time. And he
[1:17:29] would say, "Lord, why am I like this?
[1:17:31] Why am I so strange? Why am I so
[1:17:33] peculiar? And a voice would speak out, I
[1:17:35] made you that way for a reason. Because
[1:17:38] I needed you to be accurate. Because
[1:17:40] when you got up behind that pulpit, I
[1:17:42] needed you to be on the mark every time.
[1:17:44] And sometimes you say, "Why am I so
[1:17:46] peculiar, Brother Isaac? Why am I so
[1:17:49] strange? I wish that God would take this
[1:17:50] away from me." But he said, "I've chose
[1:17:52] you in your peculiarities. I made you
[1:17:55] that way for a purpose. Because I need
[1:17:57] you. Amen. For a certain reason to be
[1:18:00] that way. Amen. Because I filtered you
[1:18:03] from before the foundation of the world.
[1:18:06] Amen. To be that way. You say, "Amen."
[1:18:10] Brother Brandon, many there's quotes
[1:18:11] where he talk about since you were a
[1:18:13] little kid, there was something always
[1:18:14] different about you. Amen. You were
[1:18:16] always different than the other
[1:18:17] children. There was something in you
[1:18:18] that always hungered after God. And
[1:18:21] sometimes, Amen. A son is always a son.
[1:18:24] Sometimes it might take him a a while to
[1:18:26] recognize he is a son. Amen. But that
[1:18:28] seed always laid inside of you and
[1:18:31] that's what made you different before
[1:18:33] the foundation of the world because God
[1:18:34] was filtering you from before the
[1:18:37] foundation of the world to be an
[1:18:39] overcomer in this day. Amen. Just like
[1:18:42] when God was forming Gideon's army to go
[1:18:45] down and conquer, I believe it was maybe
[1:18:46] the Midianites. Amen. He said, "We've
[1:18:49] got too many in this army." Amen.
[1:18:52] Because if we go down now, they'll say
[1:18:54] that because your great army you have
[1:18:56] conquered and it will take away from the
[1:18:58] glory of God. So we've got to have some
[1:19:01] tests to narrow down your army. So he
[1:19:04] said, "Those that are afraid, you should
[1:19:05] just leave." And 10,000 got up and left.
[1:19:09] And then he said, "Those that drink
[1:19:11] their water, Amen, bending down will
[1:19:15] have to go." Because it showed that they
[1:19:16] were used to prostrating themselves down
[1:19:19] before idols and they couldn't be fit
[1:19:21] for Gideon's army. And they were left
[1:19:24] with a very small number that would be
[1:19:26] the overcomers in that army. I mean,
[1:19:29] look at Elijah who said there's 700 just
[1:19:32] like you. And they were the 700 that
[1:19:35] would not bow their knee to that bell
[1:19:38] religion in that day because God was
[1:19:40] filtering out a mean all of the others
[1:19:43] and saying you will be the ones that
[1:19:45] will overcome. And didn't he do it in
[1:19:48] this day? Amen. When God sent a message,
[1:19:50] it had three pulls. And he sent a first
[1:19:53] test and he sent a second test. Amen.
[1:19:56] And there was multitudes that gathered
[1:19:58] around those healing campaigns and
[1:20:00] around those supernatural signs. Amen.
[1:20:03] to discern the hearts. But when brother
[1:20:05] Brandon began to preach the opening of
[1:20:07] the word onto the people, the crowds
[1:20:10] begin to scatter away by multitudes. But
[1:20:13] you didn't leave. Amen. You remained
[1:20:15] because it was that third pole that was
[1:20:17] hooking your heart. That's what
[1:20:19] attracted that rainbow trout. That's
[1:20:21] what attracted this pride. Amen. Those
[1:20:23] first two poles were wonderful. But when
[1:20:26] that word begin to open, it begin to
[1:20:28] hook you for rapture saying, I have
[1:20:30] filtered you to receive this message. I
[1:20:33] have filtered you, amen, to become a
[1:20:35] part of the rapture that's taking place
[1:20:38] in this age. Amen. God called you,
[1:20:41] informed you, amen, to not bow, amen, to
[1:20:45] the religions of this world, but to
[1:20:47] stand for him. You say, "Why am I still
[1:20:50] here, Brother Isaac?" Amen. I I'm just
[1:20:52] here because daddy's here. I'm just here
[1:20:54] because mom is here. Amen. Maybe not.
[1:20:57] Amen. Maybe it's deeper than that. Maybe
[1:20:59] there's something inside of you that's
[1:21:02] holding you. I I I I grew up in a
[1:21:04] message church. I I even went to a
[1:21:07] message school. Amen. And I'll say this
[1:21:09] that growing up in the message ain't
[1:21:11] enough. Just going to a message school
[1:21:13] isn't enough. And I I it's sad to say it
[1:21:17] and I pray God have mercy. But I can
[1:21:19] look back and a a good percentage of the
[1:21:22] people that I went to school with are no
[1:21:24] longer serving the Lord today. Amen. And
[1:21:27] I say, "God, why am I still here? Why am
[1:21:30] I still here, Lord?" But there was
[1:21:31] something inside. Amen. That would go
[1:21:33] beyond and press through and would take,
[1:21:37] Amen. take you to a reality, take you to
[1:21:39] that place where you would meet a living
[1:21:42] God.
[1:21:43] I remember there's times, brother Ryan,
[1:21:45] where I I'd sit there and years ago and
[1:21:48] I was I was I was struggling through
[1:21:50] that I was trying to break through that
[1:21:52] sound barrier and get to that place with
[1:21:54] God where I was settled. And there was
[1:21:56] times in my life where I didn't know if
[1:21:58] I was going in the rapture or not. I
[1:22:00] didn't know if I was a son or not. But
[1:22:02] there was something in my heart that
[1:22:03] said, "Oh God, I don't know if this is
[1:22:05] for me or not, but to whom would I go?
[1:22:08] Where else would I go? This message
[1:22:11] alone is my hope. This message alone has
[1:22:14] the words of eternal life. And I said,
[1:22:15] "Oh God, I've got nowhere else to go."
[1:22:18] Amen. So, I'm going to stay with you
[1:22:20] like Elisha with Elijah. Amen. I will
[1:22:22] not leave you. I will not take my eyes
[1:22:25] off you. Amen. Because I know that the
[1:22:27] message dwells in you and I have no
[1:22:30] other hope. Amen. I will not stay back.
[1:22:33] Amen. I will not take my eyes off this
[1:22:35] word because it's my only hope. Oh, when
[1:22:38] God began to restore and bring me into
[1:22:41] that place of settleness. Amen. Because
[1:22:44] there was something in me. I said, I've
[1:22:46] got nowhere else to go. I could go to
[1:22:48] the world, but it's got nothing for me.
[1:22:50] I could go to religion, but it's got
[1:22:52] nothing that can satisfy the gene seed
[1:22:55] that dwells in the son or daughter of
[1:22:57] God. Oh, that's why it kept pushing
[1:23:00] through the muck. And eventually,
[1:23:01] daybreak begin to shine upon that seed
[1:23:04] of my life. And the clouds begin to roll
[1:23:07] away as I begin to see, oh God, that's
[1:23:10] what was always different about me.
[1:23:12] Amen. It's not because I wasn't a son.
[1:23:15] It's because I was a son. That's why I
[1:23:17] had so many battles. That's why I had to
[1:23:20] fight through so many things. Because it
[1:23:22] was God's calling bringing you, saying,
[1:23:25] "I have called you and filtered you."
[1:23:27] Amen. For this hour.
[1:23:30] My my goodness. But to think about it,
[1:23:33] friends, Joshua,
[1:23:36] he was commissioned for the job. And all
[1:23:38] of a sudden, he began to hear these
[1:23:40] great words, "As I was with Moses,
[1:23:43] so I will be with thee." And brother
[1:23:45] Brandham said, "What a consolation.
[1:23:48] What a hope." Because Moses made
[1:23:50] mistakes. Moses failed many times. And
[1:23:54] Joshua knew that if God was with Moses
[1:23:56] and his mistakes, then he's going to be
[1:23:59] with me and my mistakes. Amen. Because
[1:24:02] brother Bram tells about that man at
[1:24:03] that flower company that said, "I don't
[1:24:06] need an eraser. I don't make any
[1:24:08] mistakes." They said, "Well, then you're
[1:24:10] not going to be a good worker here." And
[1:24:13] he won't be a good worker in the kingdom
[1:24:14] of God either because brother Brandham
[1:24:16] said that God don't hold you responsible
[1:24:19] for your mistakes. He holds you
[1:24:21] responsible for your willful sin. He
[1:24:23] that sins willfully after he has
[1:24:25] received the knowledge of the truth. But
[1:24:27] a man that's going to do something is
[1:24:29] going to blunder. He's going to fall.
[1:24:32] He's going to make mistakes. But if he's
[1:24:35] really divinely called and God is in his
[1:24:37] heart, he will rise again. How many
[1:24:41] times did brother Brandon pray that
[1:24:42] forgive me, Lord, and try me one more
[1:24:45] time. I'll be yours if you'll be mine.
[1:24:47] If I fall or if I fail, let me rise and
[1:24:50] try again. Because any son or daughter
[1:24:52] of God that ever tries to do something
[1:24:54] for God will fall and we'll make
[1:24:56] mistakes. But he said mistakes are not
[1:24:59] willful sin.
[1:25:00] Willful sin belongs to those who haven't
[1:25:04] been baptized into the body yet, but to
[1:25:07] those that are in the body. I mean,
[1:25:09] you're going to make mistakes. You're
[1:25:11] going to fall down. I mean, you're going
[1:25:13] to make mistakes, but mistakes does not
[1:25:15] change who you are. Just like he said,
[1:25:18] it's like that eagle. He might come down
[1:25:21] to that to that ground. He might get
[1:25:23] caught in that cage. Amen. But
[1:25:26] backsliding does not change his species.
[1:25:29] He's an eagle when he's in the sky. And
[1:25:31] he's an eagle when he's in the cage.
[1:25:33] He's an eagle when he's on the ground.
[1:25:35] And you might backslide. You might make
[1:25:38] mistakes. But as long as you're in the
[1:25:39] path of duty, Brother Brandon said, "God
[1:25:41] is obligated to you as long as you're in
[1:25:44] the path of duty." Sometimes you might
[1:25:47] feel like Peter. He said, "Lord, save me
[1:25:50] or I'll perish." He was desperate, but
[1:25:52] he was in the path of duty. And God
[1:25:54] reached down and picked him up out of
[1:25:56] the waves. and he walked on the waves
[1:25:58] again. And he said, "It's the same for
[1:26:01] you. You might be desperate. You might
[1:26:03] be crying out, Lord, save me or I'll
[1:26:05] perish. But if you're in the path of
[1:26:07] duty, God is obligated to reach down and
[1:26:10] lift you up out of the muck that you are
[1:26:12] in." Amen. To lose a battle is not to
[1:26:16] lose the war.
[1:26:18] And mistakes do not change the
[1:26:20] commentary of your life. Moses was
[1:26:23] elected and he failed in his commission.
[1:26:26] What was Moses's mistakes? He smoked the
[1:26:28] rock in the wilderness twice when he
[1:26:30] shouldn't have. He had a temper and he
[1:26:33] broke the commandments. But in spite of
[1:26:36] all of his failure, God still had his
[1:26:38] hand upon him. David was a man after
[1:26:41] God's own heart and committed adultery.
[1:26:44] Paul was guilty of stoning Stephen who
[1:26:47] was a a a a deacon, a man of God. But
[1:26:50] yet Paul could sit down there and pen.
[1:26:53] Maybe while tears were running down his
[1:26:55] eyes, brother Bram said that experience
[1:26:57] never left him. But he could sit down
[1:26:59] there and write forgetting the things
[1:27:01] which are behind. I'll press towards the
[1:27:03] mark of the prize. I mean, I will not
[1:27:06] live in my mistakes. I will not live in
[1:27:08] my past. I've met a God. I've got my
[1:27:11] life under a blood. And I'll forget
[1:27:13] those things which are behind. And I'll
[1:27:15] press towards the mark of the prize.
[1:27:17] Amen. Sometimes we need a laying aside
[1:27:20] service, a laying aside of the weights,
[1:27:23] a laying aside of the things which are
[1:27:25] under the blood. I mean, you've heard
[1:27:27] the story maybe, but uh there was a lady
[1:27:30] in the prayer line in Brother Man's
[1:27:32] meeting one time and she had been
[1:27:33] smoking cigarettes and she heard
[1:27:36] somebody get called out for smoking
[1:27:37] cigarettes and she didn't want that to
[1:27:39] be her. So, she quickly stepped out of
[1:27:42] the line and just quickly bowed her head
[1:27:44] and repented. And when she got up in
[1:27:46] that line, brother Brandon couldn't call
[1:27:48] it out because it was under the blood.
[1:27:51] And then brother Brandon couldn't even
[1:27:53] see it because God could no longer see
[1:27:55] it. And if you put a sin underneath the
[1:27:57] blood, it's in the sea of forgetfulness.
[1:28:00] And there is no condemnation to those
[1:28:03] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:28:05] after the flesh, but after the spirit.
[1:28:08] Oh, under the blood of bulls and goats,
[1:28:10] you would have to go back every year and
[1:28:13] make penance again because it's partial
[1:28:16] remission. Because without the blood,
[1:28:18] there's no remission of sins. But
[1:28:20] brother Ryan, you know, when they speak
[1:28:22] about cancer, there's partial remission
[1:28:24] and complete total remission. And you
[1:28:26] can be in partial remission and that
[1:28:29] cancer can keep coming back. But if you
[1:28:31] ever get in total remission, I mean, you
[1:28:34] are healed. The cancer is gone. And
[1:28:36] under the blood of bulls and goats, we
[1:28:38] had partial remission. But under the
[1:28:40] blood that Jesus shed on Calvary, it is
[1:28:43] total complete remission. The sins are
[1:28:46] in the blood. You are justified as
[1:28:49] though you've never done it in the first
[1:28:51] place. You are the pure spotless. Amen.
[1:28:54] Amen. Pure and and holy bride of Jesus
[1:28:58] Christ.
[1:29:00] Abraham doubted God and lied about his
[1:29:02] wife. But when his divine commentary was
[1:29:05] written, it said he staggered not at the
[1:29:08] promise of God and was strong in faith
[1:29:11] giving glory to God. He said it shows
[1:29:13] who wrote the Bible.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; It shows that this Bible was not written
[1:29:18] by man. Because would Jacob write that
[1:29:21] he was a deceiver? Would Abraham write
[1:29:23] that he lied? Would Moses write about
[1:29:25] his mistakes? Would David write about
[1:29:27] his mistakes? Would a man write and
[1:29:30] expose his own self? He said it shows
[1:29:33] that God wrote the Bible because they
[1:29:35] could write all of their mistakes, but
[1:29:38] somewhere there in the middle of the
[1:29:40] Bible, there would come a split between
[1:29:43] the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[1:29:45] And it would turn over to a new
[1:29:47] covenant. And under that covenant, under
[1:29:49] that blood, it would come a Hebrews 11
[1:29:52] that would say Noah, a hero of the
[1:29:55] faith. Abraham, a hero of the faith.
[1:29:58] Sarah who laughed at the promise is a
[1:30:00] hero of the faith. David, amen, these
[1:30:03] mighty men are Amen that made these
[1:30:05] mistakes are heroes of the faith. Oh,
[1:30:09] and brother Brandham, he lied and he
[1:30:12] caused his wife to lie. Amen. You say
[1:30:14] the seventh angel messenger, he lied and
[1:30:17] caused his he caused his wife to lie.
[1:30:20] Amen. But he would say, "I hope my
[1:30:21] commentary is written like that." Amen.
[1:30:24] that it wouldn't be my mistakes, but God
[1:30:27] wouldn't understand the intentions of my
[1:30:29] heart. And he would write my commentary
[1:30:31] like that. And oh, I believe it will be
[1:30:34] written like that. But what about me and
[1:30:36] you, friends? What about a scripture
[1:30:38] that says that you must be perfect? You
[1:30:41] must be holy and without blemish. How
[1:30:43] could you do it when you're full of
[1:30:44] mistakes? But he said, "I'm not
[1:30:46] depending upon your ability." Amen. But
[1:30:49] you will accomplish it only through the
[1:30:52] blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. You will
[1:30:55] accomplish it only through my grace
[1:30:57] that's made you worthy.
[1:31:00] Amen. In the church age book, it says in
[1:31:02] Revelations 3:1, "He that hath the seven
[1:31:04] spirits of God in the seven stars."
[1:31:07] Brother Brandham said that he that hath
[1:31:10] shows that they're the Lord's.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "These are mine, saith the
[1:31:14] Lord." He said, "The seven spiritfilled
[1:31:17] messengers are the Lords. They may be
[1:31:20] repudiated. They may be questioned.
[1:31:23] Indeed, to human minds, they may not
[1:31:25] even seem to qualify. Nevertheless, they
[1:31:28] are the messengers for their age." And
[1:31:30] he said, "God used an Abraham. He lied.
[1:31:33] He used a Moses. He rebelled. He a
[1:31:36] Jonah, he disobeyed. A Samson, he
[1:31:38] sinned. A David, he murdered. He used a
[1:31:41] Joshua and a Joseph. And this, oh my,
[1:31:44] this is a refrigerator quote right here.
[1:31:46] He said, "And those with severe
[1:31:48] blemishes far outnumber those whose
[1:31:51] history seemed to be perfect. All were
[1:31:54] and are his." Oh my. Amen. Glory to the
[1:31:59] living God. Amen. That he said those
[1:32:01] with severe blemishes outnumber those.
[1:32:04] Amen. Who would seem perfect in the eyes
[1:32:06] of man. Amen. Man would choose Matias,
[1:32:10] but God would choose Paul. Amen. Man
[1:32:12] would look upon you and man would have
[1:32:14] never chose you. Amen. But thank God
[1:32:16] we're not depending upon man, but God
[1:32:18] could look down and say, "You might have
[1:32:20] made a lot of mistakes. Your past might
[1:32:22] be riddled with failures." Amen. But
[1:32:24] I've looked past that. Amen. Oh my.
[1:32:27] Brother Brandon would say about Sarah.
[1:32:29] He says, "She laughed at the promise
[1:32:31] when Melzdc was discerning and giving
[1:32:34] his message to Abraham." And brother
[1:32:36] Brandon would stand in a sermon one day,
[1:32:39] and I can get you the quote. I'll
[1:32:40] paraphrase it, but he was saying, "You
[1:32:42] may you may be questioning what I'm
[1:32:45] speaking right now, but I can see
[1:32:47] farther than that you're going to
[1:32:49] believe it one of these days." Amen. Man
[1:32:52] could look upon you and say, "You're
[1:32:53] never going to see it. You're never
[1:32:55] going to believe it." But a prophet
[1:32:57] could pick it up and say, "Just like
[1:32:58] Sarah laughed at the promise. You may
[1:33:01] not see it yet, but if you are his, you
[1:33:04] will come to the truth one of these
[1:33:06] days. Because God will not set you aside
[1:33:09] just because of your mistakes. But if he
[1:33:11] called you, he'll see you through to the
[1:33:13] finish line. If he predestinated you,
[1:33:15] then brother or sister, I don't care and
[1:33:18] mean how many devils you have to fight
[1:33:19] through to get there. You will make it
[1:33:21] to the finish line because God called
[1:33:24] you in your blemishes and he said, "I'll
[1:33:26] make my strength known through your
[1:33:28] weakness."
[1:33:29] Paul sought the Lord three times about
[1:33:32] his blemishes. You see, today we try to
[1:33:35] cover up our blemishes with makeup and
[1:33:38] all this and all that. Amen. That's what
[1:33:40] the world tries to do. But God says,
[1:33:42] "No, I chose you in your blemishes. I
[1:33:44] chose you in those failures. I chose you
[1:33:47] in that." And he said, "Amen. Much
[1:33:50] rather will I glory in my infirmities
[1:33:52] that the strength of God may be made
[1:33:54] perfect in my weakness."
[1:33:57] And brother Brandham speaks and compares
[1:33:59] his own life to that. And he says, you
[1:34:02] know, this tension that you have. He
[1:34:04] said, there's I I battled this tension.
[1:34:07] And I begin to think, my what would the
[1:34:09] Christian life be without tension
[1:34:11] anyway? I mean, people try to make the
[1:34:13] Christian walk as if you're never going
[1:34:15] to be nervous. You're never going to
[1:34:17] have any tension. You're never going to
[1:34:18] have a trial. And brother Brandham said,
[1:34:20] if that was the case, you would just be
[1:34:22] like a ragd doll. You would just sit
[1:34:23] there and do nothing. But tension
[1:34:25] actually keeps you in line. But he said,
[1:34:27] "I consulted the Lord about it." And he
[1:34:30] he he cried out to the Lord to take that
[1:34:32] tension away. He said how it bothered
[1:34:34] him so much that he would ask the Lord
[1:34:36] to take it away. And then he begins to
[1:34:38] par compare it to Paul. And he said,
[1:34:41] "The Lord didn't take it away, but he
[1:34:44] said, "It will never it will never scare
[1:34:46] you again. It will never bother you
[1:34:48] again." And brother Brandham said, "All
[1:34:50] right, Lord." Amen. He could have just
[1:34:52] as easily taken it away, but he didn't
[1:34:54] take it away. But he said, "You'll never
[1:34:56] fear it again." He said, "So it's there.
[1:34:58] I can feel it. I know it's there, but it
[1:35:00] doesn't scare me anymore." I mean,
[1:35:03] because there's sometimes there's things
[1:35:04] in your life, there's tensions, there's
[1:35:06] stresses that you go through, and you
[1:35:08] say, "Lord, take it away." And he said,
[1:35:10] "No, I've put it there for a reason.
[1:35:13] It's to keep you in check. It's to be
[1:35:16] sure that you're always, amen, checking
[1:35:18] your life to make sure you're in line
[1:35:19] with the word. But you don't need to
[1:35:21] fear it. There's nothing wrong. Amen.
[1:35:25] Sometimes blackness comes over your life
[1:35:27] and you feel the pressure. Amen. But
[1:35:29] there was a sister that had a dream one
[1:35:31] time that she was walking in white sands
[1:35:34] and darkness was over her head. And she
[1:35:37] said, "Now I'm nervous. My family is
[1:35:39] nervous. We're all nervous." and brother
[1:35:41] Brandham discerned it and say there's
[1:35:43] nothing wrong with you sister. The white
[1:35:46] sands show that you're walking in purity
[1:35:48] and righteousness. The blackness just is
[1:35:51] it's just that you become nervous but
[1:35:53] there's nothing actually wrong. I mean
[1:35:56] that's how it is many times. Satan will
[1:35:58] try to lie on you and make you nervous
[1:36:00] and scared and he's saying there's
[1:36:01] nothing wrong. I mean it's just things
[1:36:04] that have come against you to mold you
[1:36:06] and shape you. Oh, he'll try to lie to
[1:36:09] you and and tell you you're never going
[1:36:11] to make it. He'll try to lie and say
[1:36:14] your children are never going to make
[1:36:15] it. But we have a promise. Believe on
[1:36:18] the Lord and I and thy house shall be
[1:36:20] saved. That the same faith that saved
[1:36:23] you can save your children. And brother
[1:36:25] Bram said, one of the most powerful
[1:36:27] weapons that the church has is the power
[1:36:29] of committ. That you can commit it into
[1:36:32] the hands of God and you can stop
[1:36:34] worrying about it. Because if it's too
[1:36:37] big for God to handle, what makes you
[1:36:39] think that you can handle it? So instead
[1:36:41] of staying up all night, amen, fearing
[1:36:44] about what's going to happen, if you're
[1:36:46] going to stay up, stay up praying to a
[1:36:48] God that can change the situation. If
[1:36:51] you're going to stay up, stay up
[1:36:53] committing things into the hands of a
[1:36:55] God who's able to take care of your
[1:36:57] children. And when he gave them to you
[1:36:59] and you dedicated them back unto him as
[1:37:02] a baby and don't you think that his
[1:37:04] hands are strong enough to take them
[1:37:06] through the other side? And when that's
[1:37:08] why Jockabed had to put Moses in the
[1:37:10] basket and put him in the river and put
[1:37:13] it in the Lord's hands, but she could
[1:37:14] say that the one who gave it to me can
[1:37:17] see him through to the other side. And
[1:37:19] there was angels guiding them through
[1:37:21] every crocodile, through every
[1:37:23] whirlpool. And I say to the believing
[1:37:25] mothers this morning, amen, we serve a
[1:37:27] God who can dispatch angels. Amen. To
[1:37:30] guide your children through every trial,
[1:37:33] through every journey, through every
[1:37:34] hard time and say because of your faith.
[1:37:37] Amen. You'll have them on the other
[1:37:39] side. because of your faith. Not because
[1:37:42] I mean you're somebody special, but
[1:37:44] because you're a son of God that
[1:37:46] believes the word of God, your faith can
[1:37:48] reach out and send an angel by the way
[1:37:51] of your child and restore them back to
[1:37:53] the position that they're supposed to be
[1:37:55] in. Oh my, I say I'm too weak, brother
[1:37:59] Isaac. Amen. I I'm unable. Amen. But
[1:38:03] Satan's lies are not the truth over your
[1:38:05] life. God's word is the truth over your
[1:38:07] life. And the truth has come to set you
[1:38:10] free. And you can walk a long time in
[1:38:13] darkness thinking that there's something
[1:38:14] wrong with you. But when the truth
[1:38:16] comes, it exposes the enemy and sets the
[1:38:19] children of God free. That's why Brother
[1:38:21] Brandham can discern. There's nothing
[1:38:23] wrong with you. You're not nervous. It's
[1:38:25] just the time of life that you're going
[1:38:27] through. Amen. Or or it's just the it's
[1:38:30] just it's just the the the the the
[1:38:32] levels in your body are all up and down
[1:38:34] right now because of what you're going
[1:38:35] through. But there's nothing wrong.
[1:38:37] Amen. It's just a It's just a season.
[1:38:40] It's just a season, but it's not your
[1:38:42] identity. It's not who you are. And as
[1:38:45] the truth begin to expose,
[1:38:48] like the woman could say that someone
[1:38:50] told me I had five devils or someone
[1:38:52] told me I had seven devils and brother
[1:38:53] Brandham could simply come and begin to
[1:38:56] expose those spirits and say, "They lied
[1:38:58] on you. You're not a witch. You're not a
[1:39:01] witch. It's just a nervousness. There's
[1:39:03] nothing wrong." And as that truth begins
[1:39:05] to expose that spirit, the truth sets
[1:39:07] you free to re to realize that you are
[1:39:10] already free. He which the son is made
[1:39:13] free is free indeed. Amen. And this
[1:39:16] message has come to blow the gospel
[1:39:18] trumpet to let us know, amen, that we
[1:39:20] are free indeed. That the blood has
[1:39:23] already been shed at the rising of the
[1:39:26] sun. The emancipation proclamation has
[1:39:29] been declared. Amen. that he which the
[1:39:31] son has made free is already free. Amen.
[1:39:35] You don't have to wait another day.
[1:39:37] Amen. But the blood is already shed.
[1:39:39] Amen. Like that old Johnny Crow, he said
[1:39:41] he thought he was tied up, but he wasn't
[1:39:43] tied up any longer. And brother Brandon
[1:39:45] would say, "Jesus Christ untied you at
[1:39:48] Calvary." Amen. You say, "I'm waiting
[1:39:50] for my day where I'm going to get
[1:39:51] untied." I say, "You're already on tied
[1:39:54] by the blood of Jesus Christ." But
[1:39:56] sometimes it takes the truth to come
[1:39:58] over years and declare unto you that you
[1:40:01] are free. You are free to worship. You
[1:40:04] are free to praise. You are free to
[1:40:06] dance. You are free to enjoy. You are
[1:40:09] free to re be restored in the joy of
[1:40:12] your salvation. You are free to receive
[1:40:14] the Holy Ghost. Amen. Don't let the lies
[1:40:17] of the devil try to tell you, Amen, that
[1:40:20] you cannot possess this land. Joshua,
[1:40:23] you have been called to possess this
[1:40:25] land. Amen. It maybe there's a shamguard
[1:40:28] this morning that's just got enough
[1:40:30] righteous indignation in them to say,
[1:40:32] "I'm tired of the devil robbing my
[1:40:35] family of their food. I'm tired of the
[1:40:37] devil robbing my children of their
[1:40:39] blessings. I'm ready to pull my sword
[1:40:42] and say, Satan, it's enough." A mean
[1:40:44] that it stops here. It stops today. I
[1:40:48] mean, I'm ready to get my joy back. Oh
[1:40:51] my. You say, "I'm too weak."
[1:40:54] I've seen a lot of people that are too
[1:40:55] strong for this message, too strong to
[1:40:58] lay down their opinions, too strong to
[1:41:00] humble themselves to this vindicated
[1:41:02] word. But I haven't met anybody to this
[1:41:04] day that was too weak for this message.
[1:41:07] I've never met anybody that was too weak
[1:41:09] for this message because that's who this
[1:41:11] message came for. Those that are well
[1:41:15] have no need of a doctor. But when Jesus
[1:41:18] came on the earth, he said, "The spirit
[1:41:20] of the Lord is upon me. I've come to
[1:41:22] bind up the brokenhearted. I've come to
[1:41:25] preach good tidings to the meek. I've
[1:41:27] come to proclaim liberty to the captives
[1:41:30] and to open the prison to them that are
[1:41:33] bound." That's what this message came
[1:41:35] for. It came for the weak. It came for
[1:41:38] the rejected. It came for those who
[1:41:40] said, "I'm not good enough." But brother
[1:41:43] Bram said if you're like an eagle that's
[1:41:46] in the cage locked up, he said God's
[1:41:49] calling opens the door to let you out.
[1:41:53] And so if God is calling at your heart
[1:41:55] this morning, that is the very act that
[1:41:58] has opened the door to let you out, he's
[1:42:00] just saying, "Now you've just got to
[1:42:02] step out of the cage. Now you've just
[1:42:04] got to act on the promise. Now you've
[1:42:07] just got to act on the commission that
[1:42:09] I've called you to. Because there comes
[1:42:11] a time in your life where you have to
[1:42:12] separate your feelings from your faith.
[1:42:16] Because if you've been commissioned to
[1:42:18] do something, you may not always feel
[1:42:20] like you're able to do it. But he said,
[1:42:22] "Brother Brandon," it's a quote. He
[1:42:24] said, "There's got to be a time when
[1:42:25] you've got to separate yourself between
[1:42:27] your feelings and your faith." And he
[1:42:29] said, "That's the time it is tonight."
[1:42:32] And when Noah, when he was commissioned
[1:42:34] to build an ark, before he ever saw
[1:42:36] rain, he had to separate from all of
[1:42:38] that and go to build an ark.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Moses, even though he had the the the
[1:42:43] past of of his mistakes haunting over
[1:42:46] his life, he had to separate himself
[1:42:48] from that and say, "But no, God's
[1:42:50] commissioned me. I've met him. That's
[1:42:52] behind me now. And I've been
[1:42:54] commissioned to go take these children
[1:42:56] out of this land." And he had to act on
[1:42:58] his commission.
[1:43:00] Hey, we've been commissioned to go on
[1:43:02] the world and preach the gospel.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But one of those mornings back in
[1:43:06] November, we had to act on that and get
[1:43:08] in that airplane and go over to Peru and
[1:43:10] get bit up by a bunch of bugs and a
[1:43:13] bunch of fleas and chiggers and act on
[1:43:15] the commission. And it it wasn't always
[1:43:18] easy. There was some obstacles we had to
[1:43:20] get through. But when you know that
[1:43:21] God's commissioned you to do something,
[1:43:23] then you're not looking at the
[1:43:25] obstacles. You're not looking at the
[1:43:27] feelings, but you're looking at the
[1:43:28] commission. Amen. And if God has
[1:43:31] promised you healing and you've come up
[1:43:33] and you've been prayed for. Amen. Then
[1:43:35] that is Amen. That was the commission
[1:43:37] was already fulfilled. They shall lay
[1:43:40] their hands on the sick and they shall
[1:43:41] recover. Now it's your time to act on
[1:43:43] the commission. If God has promised you
[1:43:46] the Holy Ghost and you've repent and
[1:43:48] been baptized, now you go to acting on
[1:43:51] the commission and you go to thanking
[1:43:53] him for the promise. Amen. And saying,
[1:43:56] "Lord, I've met your requirements. I
[1:43:58] know it's for me and I'm going to start
[1:44:00] acting because brother Brandham told us
[1:44:02] you act first and then you see the
[1:44:05] miracle. Amen. First you start acting
[1:44:08] and then you see the miracle. You say
[1:44:10] I'm waiting for the miracle. Amen. But
[1:44:12] this is the time where you start acting
[1:44:14] on the commission and then the miracle
[1:44:16] will follow. Amen. Peter would say Lord
[1:44:20] if that's you bid me come out on the
[1:44:22] water. And then the Lord said it's me
[1:44:24] come. And then Peter had to act on that
[1:44:27] and step out by faith onto that water.
[1:44:31] Amen. And to fulfill, Amen. the call to
[1:44:34] come out on the water. And brother
[1:44:36] Brandham said, "Lord, if it's you, bid
[1:44:37] me come to you on the water." He said,
[1:44:39] "Come on." He said, "Now that's the same
[1:44:41] as James 5:14 and the same as Mark 16.
[1:44:45] The same God that said it said, "Come
[1:44:47] on." Amen. You know, you know very well
[1:44:50] the testimonies. There was a man by the
[1:44:52] name of John Ryan
[1:44:54] who went through the prayer line and
[1:44:55] said, "Brother Brandon, I want to be
[1:44:57] prayed for my eyes that they would be
[1:44:58] healed." And he said, "Okay, I'll pray
[1:45:00] for you." And then he came back later
[1:45:01] and said, "Something's wrong. You said I
[1:45:03] was healed." And he said, "Well, you
[1:45:05] told me you believed." And so he needed
[1:45:07] to give him something to say. So he gave
[1:45:10] him something to say. And he went out
[1:45:12] and he began to confessing and acting on
[1:45:14] his commission. Extra, extra, read all
[1:45:17] about it. By his stripes, I am healed.
[1:45:19] Extra, extra, read all about it. By his
[1:45:22] stripes, I am healed. And it wasn't very
[1:45:24] many days later, amen, that he was in a
[1:45:27] barber chair. Amen. Acting on his
[1:45:29] commission when his eyes became open and
[1:45:32] the miracle followed the action and he
[1:45:35] was completely and totally healed. Oh, I
[1:45:38] mean, because it comes by acting. Amen.
[1:45:41] Back in Arkansas years ago when brother
[1:45:43] Wayne was still living there, there was
[1:45:44] a a a sister by the name of Sister Dena
[1:45:48] and she was Dena Nelson and she had a
[1:45:50] stroke and it had paralyzed I think uh
[1:45:53] maybe the right side of her body and she
[1:45:56] had come up in a in in a prayer service
[1:45:58] that morning. I believe it was Sunday
[1:46:00] morning and she had asked Brother Wayne
[1:46:02] to pray for her that she would be healed
[1:46:04] of this this paralysis. And so he prayed
[1:46:07] the prayer of faith over her and she and
[1:46:10] she went rejoicing and confessing and
[1:46:12] they had service again that evening and
[1:46:14] she came back up and and she was coming
[1:46:17] back up for prayer dragging that leg and
[1:46:19] that crippled arm. And brother Wayne
[1:46:21] said, "Oh, I guess she's coming back up
[1:46:24] to get prayed for that arm and that leg
[1:46:26] again." And she began to begin to talk
[1:46:28] to Brother Wayne. She said, "No, I
[1:46:30] didn't come up for prayer. I came to
[1:46:32] testify of my healing." And he said,
[1:46:35] "Brother Wayne said, I saw it with my
[1:46:36] own eyes. That crippled arm reached out
[1:46:39] and took a hold of that microphone and
[1:46:41] she didn't even have time to testify
[1:46:43] because she went to dancing around that
[1:46:45] building because the very action of
[1:46:48] confessing the promise brought the
[1:46:50] promise to fulfillment in her life.
[1:46:52] Amen. If you just kept acting on the
[1:46:54] commission, I mean, the miracle was
[1:46:56] coming down the road. Amen. If you walk
[1:46:59] in the commission, before long you'll be
[1:47:01] walking in the fulfillment.
[1:47:04] You know, brother Brandham was promised
[1:47:06] to Joseph and and when he had his next
[1:47:09] daughter, everyone was making fun of
[1:47:11] him. Oh, Josephine, Josephine, is this
[1:47:14] your I thought it was right every time,
[1:47:15] Billy. Amen. Is this your This is a
[1:47:18] girl. Amen. And God promised you a boy,
[1:47:20] but he just kept acting on the
[1:47:22] commission. Before he knew it is, Joseph
[1:47:25] came. Amen. Just like Abraham had to act
[1:47:28] on the commission for Isaac and Ishmael
[1:47:31] came first. But once they got past the
[1:47:34] obstacles and just kept acting on the
[1:47:36] commission, it wasn't long before Isaac,
[1:47:38] the promised sane son, came on the
[1:47:41] scene. Oh, I encourage you as believing
[1:47:44] sons or daughters of God. If you've got
[1:47:47] need of a miracle this morning and
[1:47:49] you've come and acted on the commission
[1:47:51] and you've put it before the Lord, now
[1:47:53] is the season of acting on the
[1:47:56] commission. Now is the season of
[1:47:58] testifying. Now is a season of
[1:48:00] confessing. It's not lying. It's acting
[1:48:03] on the commission because we serve a God
[1:48:05] who is a high priest of our confession.
[1:48:08] And he is not here. Amen. To be a high
[1:48:11] priest of our mumbling and and grumbling
[1:48:13] and complaining. Amen. That is the
[1:48:15] devil's language. We should never speak
[1:48:17] the devil's language. But if you confess
[1:48:19] these promises, he is a high priest to
[1:48:22] act upon the confession of those
[1:48:24] promises and to bring them to pass.
[1:48:27] That's what he told Joshua. this book of
[1:48:29] the law shall not depart out of thy
[1:48:31] mouth. He said he didn't say his hand.
[1:48:34] He said his mouth. Because the message
[1:48:36] of Moses was meant to come in the mouth
[1:48:39] of Joshua and he was meant to speak the
[1:48:41] message. Amen. Over the situation
[1:48:44] despite the obstacles he say, "Oh, I
[1:48:47] mean, we need the sun to stay up a
[1:48:49] little longer. So, son, stand still."
[1:48:51] Amen. It may not look like it's going to
[1:48:53] work out. The Red Sea may be closing in
[1:48:56] on the situation, but why cry unto me,
[1:48:58] Moses? Speak and go forward. Put the
[1:49:02] book in your mouth and go to confessing
[1:49:04] over the situation.
[1:49:06] You say, "So and so tried that and they
[1:49:08] failed." What's that got to do with you?
[1:49:11] I don't care if a thousand people tried
[1:49:13] and fail. If it's in this Bible, it
[1:49:16] belongs in your mouth as a positive
[1:49:18] confession. And the God that you serve
[1:49:21] can bring it to pass and make it, Amen.
[1:49:24] come to pass in his right time.
[1:49:27] Amen. We've been commissioned, church.
[1:49:29] We've been commissioned for this job.
[1:49:31] We've been commissioned to possess this
[1:49:32] land. He told Joshua, "You're going to
[1:49:36] pass by Mount Sier."
[1:49:39] And he said his army had already tasted
[1:49:42] of blood. So it would he had to make
[1:49:45] sure that they didn't go and get caught
[1:49:48] up in fighting in that land because that
[1:49:50] wasn't where they were meant to stay.
[1:49:52] And he said how that Pentecostals have
[1:49:54] already tasted of organization and Mount
[1:49:57] Si was Esau's mountain and that was
[1:50:00] Esau's inheritance. That was where the
[1:50:03] Moabites dwelt. That was where those
[1:50:05] dwelt that were not under Joshua's
[1:50:07] ministry. Amen. And that was their
[1:50:10] inheritance. But Joshua's inheritance
[1:50:12] laid beyond the river and Jacob's
[1:50:14] mountain across the Jordan. That's where
[1:50:17] his inheritance laid. And brother
[1:50:19] Brandham talked about how all these
[1:50:21] churches, he said, "Don't fuss with
[1:50:23] them. Don't stew with them." Amen. You
[1:50:25] can't make them all see it. If they were
[1:50:28] predestinated, if they were commissioned
[1:50:30] to go over, they would go. Amen. But
[1:50:32] that's not their inheritance. But he
[1:50:34] said, "As for me and my house, we will
[1:50:36] serve the Lord." And brother Brandon
[1:50:38] would cry out, "If there's a deep
[1:50:40] calling into the deep in your heart, it
[1:50:42] shows that there's more for you. Your
[1:50:45] inheritance lays beyond the river. Just
[1:50:47] joining a church wasn't enough for you."
[1:50:50] Amen. Just Amen. Just being religious
[1:50:52] wasn't enough for you. But there was
[1:50:54] something in you saying, "As for me and
[1:50:56] my house, we will not drive down our
[1:50:58] stakes until we get beyond the Jordan
[1:51:01] into the promised land." And I say if
[1:51:03] there's a deep calling to the deep in
[1:51:05] your heart this morning, don't put down
[1:51:07] your stakes, friends. Amen. Never settle
[1:51:10] for less than the deep calling in your
[1:51:12] heart. But if there's still a hunger in
[1:51:14] your heart, I say there's more land to
[1:51:16] possess and it's time to put on your
[1:51:19] walking shoes and start possessing the
[1:51:21] land of the promise of this message.
[1:51:23] Amen. Footprints mean possession. Amen.
[1:51:26] You've stood still long enough, friends.
[1:51:28] Amen. It's time to put on your shoes and
[1:51:31] go to possessing your promise. It's time
[1:51:33] to put this word in our mouth. Oh my.
[1:51:36] Amen. Amen. We're not here to stand
[1:51:39] still. We're not here to look backwards.
[1:51:41] We're here to look forwards and say,
[1:51:43] "Lord, I thank you for what you did for
[1:51:45] me last year." Amen. Maybe you haven't
[1:51:48] been standing still. Maybe you've been
[1:51:49] moving forward. But I say, keep walking.
[1:51:52] Keep moving in the promises. This is a
[1:51:54] new year. I say, God, may we possess
[1:51:56] every promise. May this be a year where
[1:51:58] our children come home. May this be a
[1:52:01] year where you are, Amen, in the
[1:52:03] greatest revival you've ever been in.
[1:52:05] Not a revival that starts one day and
[1:52:07] ends the next. I'm talking about a
[1:52:09] revival where the revelation of this
[1:52:11] word picks you up and takes you into
[1:52:14] realms that you've never been in before.
[1:52:16] I mean, it's not a it's a non-ending
[1:52:19] revival. I mean, I believe God still
[1:52:22] sends revival to hungry hearts. And I
[1:52:25] believe if you're hungry for more of
[1:52:26] God, I believe if you're thirsty, amen,
[1:52:28] for more of the realities of God, for
[1:52:31] more of the Holy Ghost, I believe it's
[1:52:33] here this morning saying, "Just put one
[1:52:35] foot in front of the other and I'll lead
[1:52:37] you." Oh, I've prayed it to the Lord
[1:52:40] many times. Lord, take me by the hand
[1:52:43] and lead me through this message. Lord,
[1:52:45] I can't understand it, but I know if I'm
[1:52:47] holding your hand, I mean, you'll lead
[1:52:49] me into those places. You'll lead me
[1:52:51] into the revelation. and you'll lead me
[1:52:53] into the revival. You'll lead me into
[1:52:55] that which my soul longs uh uh longs
[1:52:59] for, my soul thirsts after. Oh God, it's
[1:53:02] for me. I want to possess my land. I
[1:53:05] want to possess my inheritance, friends.
[1:53:07] I don't know about you, but I want to
[1:53:09] act on my commission. I want to possess
[1:53:12] everything that this message said could
[1:53:14] be mine. Amen. Because we are under a
[1:53:17] commission.
[1:53:19] Don't you add or take away from one
[1:53:21] thing which Moses said. Don't turn to
[1:53:23] the right or turn to the left. You're
[1:53:26] going to come into critics. You're going
[1:53:27] to come into obstacles. You're going to
[1:53:29] come into all kinds of things. But we
[1:53:31] are under a commission. Amen. That
[1:53:33] everything that is lays in this word.
[1:53:36] Amen. Is our inheritance. If he said to
[1:53:40] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:53:42] Christ, I'm under a commission. If he
[1:53:44] said to preach the message in power and
[1:53:46] demonstration, I'm under a commission.
[1:53:48] If he said to lay your hands on the sick
[1:53:50] and they shall recover, I don't know
[1:53:52] what the rest of the world's going to
[1:53:53] do, but I'm under a commission. Amen.
[1:53:56] But it didn't stop there. But we've been
[1:53:57] commissioned to worship him. Did not the
[1:54:00] Bible say, "Let everything that hath
[1:54:02] breath praise the Lord. Praise him in
[1:54:04] the dance. Praise him in the timber.
[1:54:06] Praise him on the organ." There you go,
[1:54:08] brother Will. Praise him on the music.
[1:54:10] Praise him on the instruments. Praise
[1:54:12] him on the symbols. But whatever you do,
[1:54:15] let everything that hath breath praise
[1:54:17] the Lord because you are under a
[1:54:19] commission not just to preach in power
[1:54:21] and demonstration. But we serve a God
[1:54:23] who's worthy to be worshiped in power
[1:54:26] and demonstration.
[1:54:29] Oh, what are you going to do? I think
[1:54:31] I'll throw up my hands. I've never lost
[1:54:34] my praise, brother. I've been through
[1:54:36] some battles and I believe that there is
[1:54:38] some veterans. I don't care if you're
[1:54:41] the youngest or the oldest. You're going
[1:54:42] through some battles. Amen. But what are
[1:54:45] you going to do? Amen. Just because
[1:54:47] you're going through an obstacle that
[1:54:48] has nothing to do with the promise. This
[1:54:51] land still belongs to you. You might
[1:54:53] have lost some good friends along the
[1:54:55] way. You might have had some friends
[1:54:57] that said this message is nothing. I'm
[1:54:59] going to walk away from it. But what's
[1:55:01] that have to do with you? I think it's
[1:55:03] time to throw up our hands and start
[1:55:05] praising the Lord. I think it's time to
[1:55:07] say, "Satan, you don't have enough." But
[1:55:10] I never lost my praise. I never lost my
[1:55:13] joy. I never lost my peace. If you could
[1:55:15] have got me, you would have got me. But
[1:55:17] I was commissioned, Amen, to finish this
[1:55:20] thing out. Oh, brother Brandham ran. He
[1:55:23] fulfilled his commission. But he sent
[1:55:25] back a mantle. Amen. Almighty God poured
[1:55:28] out the spirit upon the church of the
[1:55:30] living God and said, "Amen, it's time to
[1:55:33] finish this thing. It's time to fulfill
[1:55:36] this thing."
[1:55:37] Oh, can you imagine what it would have
[1:55:40] been like that day that Elisha put on
[1:55:42] that mantle for the first time? So, oh,
[1:55:45] it's a perfect fit.
[1:55:48] He didn't have to alter it to fit him.
[1:55:50] Neither do we have to alter the message
[1:55:52] to fit us. But that's why God sends you
[1:55:55] through tests and trials because he's
[1:55:56] altering you to fit this message. And
[1:55:58] Elisha begin to strike that mantle and
[1:56:00] say, "Where is the God of Elijah? Where
[1:56:03] is the power of God? I know he's the
[1:56:06] same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh,
[1:56:08] and sometimes it's time to put on the
[1:56:10] mantle. You try on outfits before church
[1:56:13] and you say, "Oh, this one don't look
[1:56:15] right. This one don't look right." But
[1:56:17] then you put on that one, say, "Oh my,
[1:56:19] that one looks just right. It's becoming
[1:56:22] of you. It looks good on you. And you
[1:56:25] may have tried on depression. You may
[1:56:28] have tried on joy. But you cannot
[1:56:30] fulfill this commission in the devil's
[1:56:32] garments. But it's time that you take
[1:56:34] off that old coat. It's time that you
[1:56:37] take off that old spirit of heaviness.
[1:56:40] And God said, "I've got a garment of
[1:56:42] praise for you. I've got a new garment
[1:56:44] for you." Because if you're going to
[1:56:46] walk this walk, you're going to have to
[1:56:48] wear the garments that I've commissioned
[1:56:50] you to walk in. And I'll give you the
[1:56:52] oil of joy for heaviness. I'll give you
[1:56:54] the garment of praise for heaviness.
[1:56:57] I'll give you beauty for ashes. And it's
[1:57:00] time like that old armor boy story. It's
[1:57:03] time where she had to take off the rags
[1:57:05] of her old life and put on that wedding
[1:57:07] garment because she was ready to meet
[1:57:09] her bridegroom. And our messenger came
[1:57:12] and his commission is said, "Oh God,
[1:57:14] would you crown my ministry with this
[1:57:17] that I'll be able to dress your bride in
[1:57:19] the garments of this word and I'll be
[1:57:21] able to introduce the Messiah, behold
[1:57:23] the lamb of God." And he fulfilled his
[1:57:26] commission. He gave us a garment of his
[1:57:28] word. You know, he would stand in prayer
[1:57:30] lines and he would put their shoes next
[1:57:32] to them and say, "If I would give my
[1:57:34] shoes, I would, but it won't fit. If I
[1:57:36] could give them my coat, I would, but it
[1:57:38] won't fit." But he gave us the message
[1:57:40] of the hour. And he gave us something
[1:57:43] that fits. Oh, and it's time that we put
[1:57:46] on the word and say, "Oh, God, I've worn
[1:57:48] that old garment long enough. It's time
[1:57:51] to put on the garments of your word that
[1:57:53] said you never did it in the first
[1:57:55] place. I've called you to be an
[1:57:57] overcomer by the blood of the lamb and
[1:57:59] the word of your testimony. I've called
[1:58:01] you to wear this message and be the
[1:58:04] bride that I've called you to be because
[1:58:05] I have filtered you for the job.
[1:58:08] Would you stand to your feet this
[1:58:10] morning? You've been commissioned to
[1:58:12] finish this thing.
[1:58:16] Eve was commissioned to multiply and
[1:58:18] replenish the earth, but she failed in
[1:58:21] her commission.
[1:58:23] And sometimes we think that that
[1:58:25] commission is just to bear natural
[1:58:26] children. But brother Bam said that's
[1:58:28] not the commission. He said in order to
[1:58:30] multiply and replenish they would have
[1:58:31] to stay alive.
[1:58:33] That's why this bride is fulfilling the
[1:58:35] comm commission that Eve failed to do.
[1:58:37] Because when this bride brings forth
[1:58:39] word children they can never die. And
[1:58:43] that is the fulfillment of the
[1:58:44] commission multiply and replenish the
[1:58:46] earth. Because it's word children,
[1:58:49] eternal children, brideborn word
[1:58:51] children on this word are fulfilling
[1:58:54] that commission.
[1:58:57] Amen. We've been called to fulfill it.
[1:58:58] Friends,
[1:59:00] Moses didn't believe in a halfway
[1:59:02] religion, but he believed in going all
[1:59:04] the way. He said, "We'll not leave a
[1:59:06] hoof behind.
[1:59:08] We'll not leave even the cattle behind.
[1:59:11] We'll not leave our children behind."
[1:59:14] He did not believe in a sofa so far
[1:59:15] religion.
[1:59:18] Oh, and it's time, friends, that we lay
[1:59:19] aside the weight. It's time that we take
[1:59:22] off those old garments and say, "Oh,
[1:59:24] God, let me run this race with patience
[1:59:26] that's set before me, forgetting those
[1:59:28] things which are behind because it
[1:59:30] becometh us to fulfill all
[1:59:32] righteousness."
[1:59:33] You know, when brother Brandon preached
[1:59:34] that message, it becomes us to fulfill
[1:59:36] our righteousness. His mother was laying
[1:59:38] in the hospital dying.
[1:59:41] And he said, "The devil's been trying to
[1:59:42] get me out of this pulpit all morning
[1:59:45] because my mother's laying there dying,
[1:59:47] but I've got something to do. It's
[1:59:49] becoming to me to fulfill my position."
[1:59:52] And he stayed there. And he came back
[1:59:54] that night and preached a message
[1:59:56] comfort her and said, "She doesn't know
[1:59:57] it, but God kept her alive while I was
[2:00:00] preaching." That's powerful, friends. If
[2:00:03] you just stay in your position, the
[2:00:04] devil's trying to get you to give up.
[2:00:06] The devil's trying to get you to throw
[2:00:07] in the towel. The devil's trying to get
[2:00:09] you to say, "If you just let down on
[2:00:11] this word, I'll take it easier on your
[2:00:13] children. If you just don't if you just
[2:00:15] don't pray as much, if you don't play
[2:00:17] those tapes in your house, I won't fight
[2:00:19] you so much. It's a lie in the pits of
[2:00:22] hell trying to get you out of your
[2:00:23] position, but it becometh you to fulfill
[2:00:26] all righteousness. And if you are
[2:00:28] obedient to his commission, he will be
[2:00:30] obedient to his promise to you. Isn't
[2:00:33] that what he told brother Brandon up
[2:00:34] though up there in that woods when he
[2:00:36] didn't shoot those deer? He said,
[2:00:37] "Because you have kept your promise to
[2:00:39] me, I will keep my promise to you. I
[2:00:41] will never leave you nor forsake you. If
[2:00:43] you stay in your position, he'll take
[2:00:45] care of your children. He'll take care
[2:00:47] of your family. He'll take care of your
[2:00:49] finances. He'll take care of everything
[2:00:51] you have need of. But it requires us to
[2:00:55] fulfill our commission.
[2:00:58] as we bow our heads and close our eyes.
[2:01:02] I was looking at one time because I I I
[2:01:05] like to read books and sometimes you're
[2:01:06] coming down to the end of that book and
[2:01:08] there's some loose ends and you don't
[2:01:09] know how that book's going to come out.
[2:01:12] You say, "How's how's all these strands
[2:01:14] of this plot going to come together?"
[2:01:17] But there's a term in literature and
[2:01:18] it's called day numan.
[2:01:21] And the de numan of literature is the
[2:01:23] the final scenes, the closing scenes of
[2:01:26] a of a of a play or of a book. And it's
[2:01:29] where the writer has all of the all of
[2:01:32] the strands, all of the loose ends of
[2:01:34] the story come together in that final
[2:01:36] scene sometimes. And sometimes when
[2:01:38] you're reading that book, you come and
[2:01:40] you realize that you're coming to the
[2:01:41] end of something. The words don't go to
[2:01:44] the end of the page. And you say, "My,
[2:01:46] is this the end of the book? How's it
[2:01:48] all going to come together?" And then
[2:01:50] you turn that page over and you say,
[2:01:51] "Ah, there's a final chapter."
[2:01:55] And you begin to read that final chapter
[2:01:57] and it all begins to come together. And
[2:02:00] you may feel like you're at the end of
[2:02:01] your book, but as God begins to turn
[2:02:04] over that page, said, "There's another
[2:02:06] chapter in this book. I'm going to tie
[2:02:09] the loose ends together." Just like this
[2:02:12] message came to tie the loose ends of
[2:02:13] our lives together.
[2:02:16] Sometimes you question say, "Brother
[2:02:18] Isaac, have I been commissioned? Am I
[2:02:20] sufficient for the job?"
[2:02:23] Brother Brandham asked that one time. He
[2:02:24] said, "The commission is pray for the
[2:02:26] sick." The question is insufficient for
[2:02:28] the job. But the answer was, "This is
[2:02:32] the means of your peculiar birth and
[2:02:34] life. For this reason, you were born to
[2:02:37] fulfill his commission." You say,
[2:02:39] "Brother Isaac, I feel insufficient this
[2:02:41] morning. I've made so many mistakes. I'm
[2:02:43] such an odd, peculiar person. But I say
[2:02:46] maybe this is the means of your peculiar
[2:02:48] birth in life.
[2:02:50] Maybe it's that God has called you for
[2:02:52] such a time as this.
[2:02:55] Oh, maybe it's time to lay aside the
[2:02:57] weights. Say, Lord, if you've called me,
[2:03:00] then I'm going to trust you. If you've
[2:03:02] called me, Lord, then I believe I may
[2:03:04] not be sufficient, but in you I'm
[2:03:06] sufficient.
[2:03:08] Amen. If you've got to wait this
[2:03:09] morning, I say, why don't we lay it
[2:03:11] aside this morning?
[2:03:13] Why don't we forget the things which are
[2:03:15] behind us? Sometimes in the path of
[2:03:18] duty, you pick up things, but you're not
[2:03:21] meant to carry them. You're not meant to
[2:03:22] walk this walk with them. You're meant
[2:03:24] to lay them aside.
[2:03:26] Brother Brandham picked up things.
[2:03:27] Brother Brandham, when the people
[2:03:29] weren't receiving his message, he felt a
[2:03:32] complex begin to come in his life that
[2:03:34] the people weren't hearing his message.
[2:03:35] And he said, "It's just so easy to build
[2:03:37] up a complex.
[2:03:39] It's just so easy." And he would ask the
[2:03:40] people to pray for me. He said, "Pray
[2:03:42] for me that God would restore what I
[2:03:44] lost out there in that complex."
[2:03:46] Sometimes it's easy to pick up things.
[2:03:48] Sometimes it's easy to pick up weights.
[2:03:50] But you say, "God, if I'm called to
[2:03:52] fulfill this commission, I can't do it
[2:03:55] with these weights. I can't do it with
[2:03:56] these garments. Lord, would you help me
[2:03:58] to lay it aside? Would you help me,
[2:04:01] Lord? I don't want this condemnation,
[2:04:02] Father. Wash me in your blood this
[2:04:05] morning. Lord, help me to walk free from
[2:04:07] it. Father, help me to walk free from
[2:04:10] that burden. Help me to walk, Lord. Help
[2:04:12] me to trust you more, Lord. Help me to
[2:04:14] commit these burdens into your hands.
[2:04:16] For your yoke is easy and your burden is
[2:04:18] light, Father.
[2:04:21] Oh, let's pray.
[2:04:23] Lord Jesus, we thank you for your mercy
[2:04:25] this morning.
[2:04:27] We thank you for your grace this
[2:04:28] morning, Father. We trust you, Lord.
[2:04:31] You're always right on time. We don't
[2:04:33] always understand how you're going to
[2:04:34] work it out, but you're always right on
[2:04:36] time. I pray that this would be a year
[2:04:39] of laying aside of the weights. I pray
[2:04:42] this would be a year of laying aside of
[2:04:44] the things of the past, putting them
[2:04:47] under the blood. I pray this would be a
[2:04:48] year where we begin to put footprints in
[2:04:51] the land of your promises, Father, where
[2:04:54] we would begin to act on your
[2:04:56] commission, Lord.
[2:04:58] May this be a year, Father. Maybe
[2:05:00] there's been some acting for quite some
[2:05:01] time now. Lord, I believe the miracles
[2:05:04] are going to follow one of these days.
[2:05:06] We will see miracles. We are seeing
[2:05:09] miracles. Lord,
[2:05:11] would you give us the grace to press
[2:05:13] this battle? Father, if there's a
[2:05:15] garment of heaviness, if there's a
[2:05:17] spirit of heaviness in here this
[2:05:19] morning, Lord,
[2:05:21] may they lay it aside. And Lord, may you
[2:05:23] begin to sweep through their pew this
[2:05:25] morning. Give them a garment of praise.
[2:05:29] Give them the beauty for their ashes.
[2:05:31] Father,
[2:05:32] we don't go through trials in vain.
[2:05:34] Lord, we don't go through hard nights in
[2:05:37] vain. Father,
[2:05:40] you're able to make beauty out of those
[2:05:41] ashes. We commit this assembly. I pray
[2:05:44] you bless them. I pray you bless their
[2:05:46] pastor. I pray you bless this church,
[2:05:49] Lord, as we run the last the last leg of
[2:05:52] this journey. May you help us to fulfill
[2:05:54] the commission you called us to. We
[2:05:56] commit it in your hands in Jesus name.
[2:06:00] Oh, amen. Could we sing that together
[2:06:02] this morning as we invite your pastor
[2:06:25] Oh my gratitude. Brother Steven, if you
[2:06:27] could come help us, go. I could sing
[2:06:31] these songs
[2:06:34] as I often do,
[2:06:38] but every song will stay
[2:06:43] and you never do.
[2:06:48] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[2:06:52] again and again.
[2:06:55] Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah.
[2:07:03] Hallelu.
[2:07:07] And I know it's not much. I'm nothing
[2:07:10] else fit for a king
[2:07:14] except for a heart singing hallelu.
[2:07:22] Hallelujah.
[2:07:31] My words fall short.
[2:07:35] I got nothing new.
[2:07:40] How could I express
[2:07:45] my gratitude?
[2:07:49] I could sing these songs
[2:07:53] as I often do,
[2:07:58] but every song must stand
[2:08:02] and you never do.
[2:08:07] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[2:08:11] again and again.
[2:08:15] Cuz all that I have is a hallelu
[2:08:22] hallelujah.
[2:08:26] And I know it's not much, but I'm
[2:08:29] nothing else before a king
[2:08:34] except for a heart singing hallelu.
[2:08:41] Hallelujah.
[2:08:50] I've got one response.
[2:08:54] I've got just one move.
[2:08:59] With my arms stretched wide,
[2:09:03] I will worship you.
[2:09:09] Up my hands and praise you again and
[2:09:13] again. Cuz
[2:09:16] all that I have is a hallelujah.
[2:09:23] Hallelu.
[2:09:26] And I know it's not much, but I've
[2:09:30] nothing else before a king
[2:09:34] except for a heart singing hallelu.
[2:09:41] Hallelujah.
[2:09:50] So come on my soul. Don't you get shy on
[2:09:55] me. Lift up your voice cuz you've got a
[2:09:59] lion inside of those lungs. Come on and
[2:10:03] praise the Lord.
[2:10:09] So come on my soul, don't you get shy on
[2:10:13] me. Lift up your song cuz you've got a
[2:10:17] light inside of those lungs. Get up and
[2:10:22] praise the Lord.
[2:10:28] Throw up my hands and praise you again
[2:10:32] and again.
[2:10:34] That's all I have. Cuz all that I have
[2:10:36] is a hallelu
[2:10:42] hallelujah.
[2:10:46] And I know it's not much, but I've
[2:10:49] nothing else before a king
[2:10:53] except for a heart singing hallelu.
[2:11:01] Hallelujah.
[2:11:04] Let's
[2:11:05] hear from the musicians.
[2:11:29] Anybody
[2:11:52] have a testimony like to praise the Lord
[2:11:54] or let him know or let us know what he's
[2:11:57] done for you?
[2:12:00] Sister Naomi, praise the Lord. Sorry,
[2:12:03] brother Chase.
[2:12:06] Hallelujah. Might be all you have.
[2:12:10] Might be all you have. That's I pray
[2:12:12] it's enough. I know it's enough. If
[2:12:14] that's all you got and you give him all,
[2:12:16] that's enough. Praise. Praise the Lord.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; I just wanted to thank the Lord because
[2:12:21] that sermon was everything I needed. It
[2:12:25] was everything you've been struggling
[2:12:27] with. all the questions
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; and I don't deserve it, but he's so good
[2:12:33] to me. I just wanted to give him praise
[2:12:36] and glory because he's real.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; He knows the prayers and the needs of
[2:12:40] our hearts and I just
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; He's so good to me and he's worthy of
[2:12:45] all praise.

[2:17:25] I surrender it all.
[2:17:27] Surrendering my
[2:17:32] to
[2:17:35] the king.
[2:17:40] Father, I see that you are drawing
[2:17:44] the light in the sand. I'll be standing
[2:17:48] by your side,
[2:17:50] holding your hand to let your kingom

[2:19:20] Heat. Heat.
[2:19:31] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:19:52] I'm surrendering my
[2:19:58] surrender to the king.
[2:20:02] May let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[2:20:03] Father, Lord, we're grateful. Lord, I
[2:20:07] can say also Lord, as our sister's
[2:20:10] testimony, I glean so much from the
[2:20:12] message this morning, which is your
[2:20:14] word, Lord, and nothing other than that.
[2:20:17] Sometimes, Lord, we just become
[2:20:19] forgetful and we need a reminder. And
[2:20:22] Lord, where we needed reminding this
[2:20:23] morning, you gave us a reminder, Lord.
[2:20:26] And we want to give you praise and honor
[2:20:28] and glory for that. Lord, we'd ask you
[2:20:30] to continue to strengthen our brother as
[2:20:33] he ministers this afternoon, Lord. Lord,
[2:20:35] give him a new fresh anointing, Lord, as
[2:20:37] it comes upon them. And may you speak to
[2:20:39] the youth in a mighty way. May souls be
[2:20:42] touched as I know they were this
[2:20:43] morning. Lord, we were so blessed in
[2:20:45] your presence and we thank you for it,
[2:20:48] Lord, as we would go and travel. We'd
[2:20:49] ask you to be with us. Protect us, Lord.
[2:20:52] Place your ministering angels and
[2:20:54] protection around our vehicles and cars
[2:20:57] and wherever we would go, Lord. Just be
[2:20:59] with us and be with our brother and
[2:21:01] sister, Lord, that sang that beautiful
[2:21:03] song this morning. May their family,
[2:21:05] Lord, may you continue to bless them,
[2:21:08] Lord. May you continue to bless his
[2:21:09] ministry, Lord. May you just watch over
[2:21:12] them. Each member of the family, Lord,
[2:21:14] there. And we'd ask you to just continue
[2:21:16] to Lord, not only bless, but may it
[2:21:19] grow, Father, as you would grow in it,
[2:21:22] Lord. And may it prosper as you would be
[2:21:24] the one lifted up in this ministry.
[2:21:27] Bless the saints there at True Word,
[2:21:28] Lord. And we're so grateful. We just
[2:21:31] worship you now and we praise you,
[2:21:33] Father. May we be dismissed not from
[2:21:36] your presence, Lord, just from this
[2:21:37] building. And may you abide with us as
[2:21:39] we go. Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:21:42] Amen. Amen. Lord bless you.
[2:21:58] Whatever.
[2:22:06] Nothing else can take your place.
[2:22:12] Oh, to feel the warmth of your embrace.
[2:22:21] Help me find a way.
[2:22:25] Bring me back to you.
[2:22:32] You're all I want.
[2:22:40] You're all that I've ever
[2:22:44] need.
[2:22:47] You're all I want.
[2:22:55] Help me know you are near. Lord bless
[2:22:59] you.
[2:23:12] Never let you go.
[2:23:20] Lay it all down again.
[2:23:28] Hear you say that I'm
[2:23:37] desire.
[2:23:43] No one else will do.
[2:23:51] There's nothing else can take your name.
[2:23:58] And I feel the warmth in your embrace.
[2:24:07] Help me find a way.
[2:24:11] Bring me back to you.
[2:24:14] You're my desire.
[2:24:18] You're all I want.
[2:24:26] You're all that I've ever
[2:24:30] needed.
[2:24:34] You're all I want.
[2:24:41] Let me know you are near.
[2:24:58] You're all
[2:25:00] I
[2:25:06] You're all I
[2:25:10] know.
[2:25:14] Know you are
[2:25:22] know you are near.
[2:25:34] Amen.
[2:25:50] I speak Jesus.
[2:25:59] I just want to speak the name of Jesus.
[2:26:06] Every dark addiction starts to break.
[2:26:12] Amen.
[2:26:13] Declaring there's hope and there's
[2:26:17] freedom.
[2:26:20] I speak Jesus.
[2:26:24] We speak his name.
[2:26:27] His name is power.
[2:26:31] Your name is healing your name.
[2:26:35] Make his life.
[2:26:41] Make every stronghold.
[2:26:46] Shine through the shadows.
[2:26:50] Burn light of fire.
[2:27:02] Jesus.
[2:27:06] for fear and all anxiety.
[2:27:13] Oh, for every soul captive by
[2:27:17] depression.
[2:27:19] I speak Jesus
[2:27:36] life.
[2:27:42] Make every stronghold
[2:27:46] shine through the shadow.
[2:27:50] Burn like a fire
[2:28:07] in the darkness of every
[2:28:13] Jesus for my family has been name Jesus.
[2:28:20] to us
[2:28:24] to man.
[2:28:28] Jesus from the mountain.
[2:28:32] Jesus in the street.
[2:28:43] Jesus for my family.
[2:28:47] We know
[2:28:49] it's the name of Jesus.
[2:28:53] It's the name of Jesus.
[2:28:55] Oh, his name is power.
[2:29:00] His name is healing.
[2:29:04] His name is my
[2:29:09] praise.
[2:29:12] Praise the Lord.
[2:29:15] Shine through the shadow.
[2:29:45] It's all right.
[2:31:44] sister said she didn't mind if I just
[2:31:48] without giving details, it's very just
[2:31:51] it's just serious and it involves
[2:31:54] children and it's very serious. Brother
[2:31:58] Daryl, go ahead and come on up. And so I
[2:32:00] think with this brothers and sisters
[2:32:02] here, we could intercede for children
[2:32:05] that were that were
[2:32:07] uh
[2:32:09] and you just at times you go, I can't do
[2:32:11] nothing, Lord. I'm
[2:32:14] I'm at my wit's end. That psalm says,
[2:32:17] I'm at my wits end.
[2:32:19] And that scripture, as I mentioned a few
[2:32:21] a little while back, it means
[2:32:24] it's at the end of what you can do. It's
[2:32:26] at the end of all human ability. It's at
[2:32:29] the end of all human knowledge. And then
[2:32:31] the Bible says that those sailors, they
[2:32:33] cried out to God and he was there. So
[2:32:37] we're at our wits end and we just cry
[2:32:39] out to God together with you brother and
[2:32:42] sister. Heavenly Father God, we lay our
[2:32:44] hands on this couple and
[2:32:47] Lord, as her own testimony would be, but
[2:32:49] this is these are saints of God, Lord,
[2:32:51] as the brother said this morning
[2:32:54] that committal,
[2:32:56] Lord. And sometimes you got to get us to
[2:32:58] the end of the road, the end of our wit,
[2:33:00] the end of our knowledge, the end of our
[2:33:02] ability. We can't do anything. And so
[2:33:06] then we just we're all 100% reliant on
[2:33:09] you.
[2:33:11] We ask you to just take over completely.
[2:33:13] Not that we haven't believed that you've
[2:33:15] been in control from the beginning. We
[2:33:17] do believe that. But Lord, we throw up
[2:33:19] our hands and give you we commit this
[2:33:22] situation
[2:33:23] with this family member, Lord,
[2:33:25] completely into your hands. And we ask
[2:33:28] for your help. We ask you to be Lord
[2:33:32] like with the Philippian jailer and Paul
[2:33:35] led him to you, Lord. And then he said
[2:33:37] now thy and thy house
[2:33:40] Lord we believe that promise if they
[2:33:42] were under the token if they would been
[2:33:44] to put Lord in the book of Exodus inside
[2:33:47] there and if the blood would have been
[2:33:48] sprinkled over the door then everyone in
[2:33:51] that house Lord was under that blood and
[2:33:54] under that token. And so brother and
[2:33:57] sister brother Daryl Lord and sister
[2:33:59] Jane here as they would stand here not
[2:34:01] before me. We stand here before you
[2:34:03] relying on you Lord. We commit it. We
[2:34:06] intercede with our brother and sister,
[2:34:09] Lord. We intercede with them. We know
[2:34:11] the struggles of raising a family, Lord,
[2:34:13] and the challenges there and the
[2:34:15] impossibilities seemingly sometimes then
[2:34:18] how it affects our spirit and it affects
[2:34:21] Lord just the entire household. But
[2:34:23] Father, you're more than able. You're
[2:34:26] actually the head of this home. And as
[2:34:29] the head of this home, Lord, you take
[2:34:32] full control of this situation. We once
[2:34:35] again, Lord, we believe they've
[2:34:36] committed it to you, but we once again
[2:34:39] fully commit this situation into your
[2:34:42] hands. May you take full control, deal
[2:34:45] with this situation as you would have
[2:34:46] it, Lord. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:34:49] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless
[2:34:52] you.
