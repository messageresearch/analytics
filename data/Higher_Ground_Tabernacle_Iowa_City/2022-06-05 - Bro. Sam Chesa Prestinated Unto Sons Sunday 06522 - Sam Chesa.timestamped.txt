[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:38] version f
[1:00:41] the bible reads
[1:00:43] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[1:00:46] priesthood
[1:00:47] and holy nation
[1:00:49] a peculiar people that you should show
[1:00:52] for the praises of whom who have called
[1:00:54] you out of darkness
[1:00:56] into his marvelous light
[1:01:03] after that we will we are going to go to
[1:01:06] the book of jeremiah chapter 1 and verse
[1:01:08] 4.
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:50] let's go to the book of jeremiah chapter
[1:01:52] 1 and verse 4.
[1:01:59] verse 4 is then the word of the lord
[1:02:01] came unto me saying
[1:02:03] before i formed thee in the belly i knew
[1:02:05] thee and before thou comest fought out
[1:02:08] of the womb i sanctified thee and i
[1:02:10] ordained thee a prophet unto the nations
[1:02:17] jeremiah 1 and verse 4 and 5
[1:02:22] your god is telling jeremiah that before
[1:02:24] you were born
[1:02:25] before you were formed in your mother's
[1:02:27] womb
[1:02:28] i had already known you
[1:02:30] i had already predestinated you amen
[1:03:01] amen may the lord add blessings to the
[1:03:02] reading of his word
[1:03:06] whilst we're getting siri we just want
[1:03:07] to open uh another scripture in
[1:03:09] ephesians chapter 1 and verse 4.
[1:03:23] the bible says according as he has
[1:03:25] chosen us in his in him
[1:03:31] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:03:33] before the foundation of the world that
[1:03:36] we should be holy and without blame
[1:03:38] before him in love
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:41] having predestinated us unto the
[1:03:44] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[1:03:47] himself amen according to the good
[1:03:50] pleasure of his will
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:10] volunteer
[1:04:24] amen having predestinated us unto the
[1:04:26] adoption of sons
[1:04:28] and to the adoption of children by jesus
[1:04:30] christ amen amen as we are reading
[1:04:33] through the bible we see all these
[1:04:34] different scriptures
[1:04:39] letting
[1:05:05] and we know nowadays we are living in a
[1:05:07] time where everyone wants to know their
[1:05:09] origin
[1:05:14] people are longing to trace their rules
[1:05:16] they want to check their dna
[1:05:35] amen but we know we don't have to worry
[1:05:37] about that
[1:05:41] because the word tells us where we came
[1:05:42] from
[1:05:45] before the world was created
[1:05:48] you
[1:06:05] is taking advantage of that people
[1:06:07] trying to find out what their identity
[1:06:09] is
[1:06:14] or where they come from
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:18] we know nowadays people are being told
[1:06:19] you can be what you be you can be what
[1:06:21] you want to become
[1:06:27] if you are born
[1:06:28] a woman and you think that i'm a man you
[1:06:30] can just say i'm a man
[1:06:56] if god said before the foundation of the
[1:06:58] world you are my daughter
[1:07:03] nothing can change that yeah
[1:07:06] so all we have to do is look back into
[1:07:07] the word of god and see who we are and
[1:07:09] where we came from two seconds
[1:07:27] so when god says to jeremiah before you
[1:07:29] were formed in your mother's belly i
[1:07:31] knew you allah can't you ideas
[1:07:37] and i come and i read the scriptures
[1:08:07] predestinated means chosen before the
[1:08:11] predestination
[1:08:14] so before anything happened
[1:08:17] before god said let there be light
[1:08:22] you were
[1:08:36] that's why the bible says nature is
[1:08:38] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:08:40] sons of god
[1:08:46] because the predestinated sons of god
[1:08:48] were given authority
[1:09:18] and he had a beginning
[1:09:21] satan had a beginning and he's going to
[1:09:23] have an end alec
[1:09:25] but you and me we are eternal but bruce
[1:09:29] we don't have a beginning like our
[1:09:31] father and we don't have an ending
[1:09:35] that's why we came from god and we are
[1:09:37] going back to this
[1:09:41] you are a son you are a daughter of god
[1:09:42] you are the same as your father was that
[1:09:45] the feast was it laffy did you visit
[1:10:12] [Music]
[1:10:17] amen we thank god for his predestination
[1:10:22] amen he predestinated us by elections
[1:10:27] and he predestinated us by his
[1:10:53] and he put every name on the lam's book
[1:10:55] of life
[1:11:26] so when jesus came on the cross of
[1:11:28] calvary our conscience you have an issue
[1:11:30] with what happened to take us back to
[1:11:31] where we were
[1:11:35] because we know because of the fall past
[1:11:47] [Music]
[1:11:55] but the prophet tells us that you only
[1:11:57] came to the realization that i was a son
[1:12:04] we all know the story of the prodigal
[1:12:05] son
[1:12:08] when he was out there eating with the
[1:12:10] pigs cantilever
[1:12:12] that did not change who he was
[1:12:17] he was still the son of his father
[1:12:21] but because of sin of course there's
[1:12:23] some patience he forgot
[1:12:26] and he was living under his privilege
[1:12:30] because he forgot that he was a son
[1:12:34] he
[1:13:03] it doesn't matter what scenes you were
[1:13:04] doing
[1:13:07] that did not change who you were
[1:13:11] you were already at predestination
[1:13:14] and fish predestinated you and we thank
[1:13:16] god for the message
[1:13:20] that came to open our eyes
[1:13:24] so we could remember
[1:13:27] we were saying
[1:13:29] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:32] before you were saved
[1:13:35] you were already a son
[1:13:38] hey man amen so it is really important
[1:13:41] say foreign
[1:13:57] wherever you come from
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:26] that
[1:14:40] nothing
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:15:22] so whatever anything that comes in in
[1:15:25] your lineage of your family

[1:17:40] god will forget it jeff
[1:17:43] if you repent of all the sins you did

[1:17:53] brother branham and he said um
[1:18:08] and every time i kneel down to pray to
[1:18:10] god asking for forgiveness
[1:18:15] the prophet said you know what
[1:18:18] every time you are telling god
[1:18:20] do you that's the first time he's
[1:18:22] hearing it
[1:18:25] because the moment you confessed it to
[1:18:27] god the first time
[1:18:31] he erased it
[1:18:34] he forgot it
[1:18:36] he cannot even remember in a penalty
[1:18:38] please
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:19:01] whatever you did in your past does not
[1:19:02] matter

[1:19:13] amen we all know the story of um the
[1:19:16] woman at the well no consumption of
[1:19:19] she was known of having an
[1:19:26] but when jesus was right there my
[1:19:28] conscience you tell her and he was
[1:19:30] talking to her
[1:19:32] the disciples saw jesus talking to a
[1:19:34] prostitute
[1:19:35] jesus in prostitutes but jesus did not
[1:19:38] see that
[1:19:40] he was seeing her how she was before the
[1:19:42] foundation
[1:19:47] and he had come to restore her being a
[1:19:49] daughter of god
[1:19:53] and then she was changed
[1:19:56] she was a daughter of god
[1:19:59] although people were singing differently
[1:20:02] allah
[1:20:14] the kind of woman whom jesus is
[1:20:16] entertaining
[1:20:44] he
[1:21:11] stop living under your privilege
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:41] was at the thrashing floor
[1:21:46] and gideon when he he was hiding harvest
[1:21:49] from the media knights
[1:21:50] he is a cashier definitely made janito
[1:21:53] because the media would come in and take
[1:21:56] all the harvest that the children of
[1:21:57] israel would have had pascale
[1:22:03] and gideon was in an act of being a
[1:22:05] coward hello
[1:22:09] he was in the midst of hiding louis
[1:22:11] cashier the vance emiliani he was in the
[1:22:13] midst of running away
[1:22:15] from him
[1:22:17] but then the angel of god came down to
[1:22:18] him
[1:22:21] an angel is a messenger
[1:22:42] [Music]
[1:22:49] but once he was in the middle of running
[1:22:51] away
[1:22:53] the angel said thou mighty man of valor
[1:22:56] did you have any questions
[1:22:58] it was not
[1:22:59] it was not looking at him with what
[1:23:02] gideon was seeing himself in london
[1:23:04] foreign
[1:23:31] it doesn't matter how many battles you
[1:23:33] have lost
[1:23:36] god sees you at him as a mighty
[1:23:38] conqueror continue
[1:23:43] and say thank you lord
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:24:04] amen and the prophet of god dramatize it
[1:24:06] and say his his uh his daughter was
[1:24:08] getting thin
[1:24:09] the prophet
[1:24:12] uh
[1:24:14] and he was a little farmer and uh
[1:24:16] the philistines were coming to steal
[1:24:18] their harvest away from them
[1:24:23] and then there was a crisis at hand
[1:24:28] increase of a
[1:24:29] he started thinking my family is uh is
[1:24:32] not even enjoying the harvest that we're
[1:24:34] making
[1:24:39] he saw he was a farmer
[1:24:42] he says
[1:24:46] but then he remembered something
[1:24:48] he said i played the character he looked
[1:24:50] into the word of god
[1:24:53] and he saw a promise that was made to
[1:24:55] abraham his father
[1:25:00] that promise says thy seed shall possess
[1:25:02] the gate of the enemy
[1:25:08] so that word
[1:25:10] was responsible
[1:25:13] give him victory
[1:25:16] amen amen the prophet of god
[1:25:20] he says
[1:25:23] you know i'm not a fighter
[1:25:26] but i am a son of abraham
[1:25:29] i'm of the tribe and the lineage
[1:25:33] i know my god still lives
[1:25:37] there was a crisis at hand here
[1:25:51] and he killed 600 philistines yeah
[1:25:53] election
[1:25:54] season see some philistines and that was
[1:25:57] a paradox
[1:25:59] because he was standing on the word
[1:26:03] he saw the word says
[1:26:05] we are going to overcome all the gates
[1:26:07] of the enemy
[1:26:10] enemy so he knew he was not a fighter he
[1:26:13] was not a trained fighter
[1:26:19] that word was responsible to give him
[1:26:21] victory
[1:26:24] so wherever you are you might say i
[1:26:25] don't have the courage to do it
[1:26:31] just stand on the word of god
[1:26:34] that
[1:27:02] victory
[1:27:04] the bible promised that you and me
[1:27:08] will possess all the gates
[1:27:12] just stand on that word
[1:27:16] the prophet god says he says that's the
[1:27:19] death struck to satan say suffer
[1:27:22] when a man takes god at his word
[1:27:27] that'll kill satan each and every time
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:45] they won't suffer we are predestinated
[1:27:48] we gotta know
[1:27:50] that once a while whom we were called
[1:27:51] out to be king
[1:27:54] and nothing will ever stand in your way
[1:27:58] the prophet god also says
[1:28:01] he says now remember
[1:28:03] christ in the true church is a
[1:28:05] continuation of the book of acts
[1:28:10] uh
[1:28:12] they live for this actor you see satan
[1:28:14] he fights that revelation
[1:28:17] revelation he cannot stand it in a paper
[1:28:20] accepted
[1:28:21] he knows that if the people get to the
[1:28:24] true revelation of what the true church
[1:28:26] is
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:40] that's why satan is always trying to
[1:28:41] decide
[1:28:44] because he knows that the moment you
[1:28:46] know who you are
[1:28:49] the moment you know that you are a son
[1:28:51] of god
[1:28:55] it will be trouble for him
[1:28:59] in the day to the prophet of god says
[1:29:02] no
[1:29:05] brother sister deity is in you
[1:29:08] like
[1:29:23] say
[1:29:24] he is hidden in me
[1:29:27] so it becomes christ himself doing the
[1:29:29] work and not yourself
[1:29:32] you say christian remember this effort
[1:29:34] because he said i will be in you even up
[1:29:37] to the end of the world basically
[1:29:41] so we know that everything that was in
[1:29:43] god
[1:29:44] two seconds according to christ
[1:29:47] everything that was in christ
[1:30:04] maturity
[1:30:32] adam was given authority over creation
[1:30:38] when he told a lion to say move over
[1:30:40] there
[1:30:42] or the kitty that lion had to move
[1:30:46] when he told a river to switch
[1:30:47] directions
[1:30:54] because he was speaking with authorities
[1:31:01] [Music]
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:43] speak to hornets
[1:31:45] and hornets would hear that voice
[1:31:49] we proved
[1:31:50] hornets would hear that voice because
[1:31:53] the sons of god realized that true
[1:31:56] identity
[1:32:36] may the name of god be praised
[1:32:47] get the song leader to sing as one song
[1:32:49] amen
[1:33:07] hey man
