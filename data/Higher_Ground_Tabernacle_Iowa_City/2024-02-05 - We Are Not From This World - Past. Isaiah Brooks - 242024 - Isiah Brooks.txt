we just thank God for his grace and his Mercy we we want to give honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I thought brother is Pastor is would be here today uh but uh tired so he stayed in De Mo but nevertheless I'm here by the grace of God and we're trusting that the Lord will bless you I heard of a of the wonderful service you had last week and happy about that and let's just go to the scripture got I've got a testimony and I want to give that we're going to go to Hebrews the 11th chapter 11 chapter we're going to read uh the 13th to the 12th uh 16th verse 1 16 we preached this message in De last week and I felt led to preach it here added a few things by the grace of God by way of study and I pray that the message would be a blessing to you we are we are definitely living in the last days need to make sure our ankle holds and grips that Solid Rock Amen uh Hebrews 11 13- 16 these all died in faith not having received the promises but have seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of the that country from which they came out they may have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is in Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he had prepared for them a [Music] city first Peter second chapter we'll read the 11th and 12th first Peter second 11 and 12th verse dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul having your conscience honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your own good works excuse me they may by your good works which they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation [Music] let us pray Heavenly Father God we thank you for your gracek for your mercy thank you for being so good to us Lord we pray by the reading of your word that you would bless your people Lord in the Old Testament when the word was read it was signifying that you were blessing the people so we read and have read your word this morning God we pray that the blessings of the word will fall upon the people bless us now Lord godive us of all sin anything we may have said or done that is against your word come humbly before you this morning God to speak your word move us completely out of the way sanify our hearts and our lips sanify the ears of the people that they may hear from from their hearts and not from their head Lord we ask these things in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated I just want to thank God for my wife Ruby Ruby I don't see her oh yeah there she is okay but anyway we we just want to praise God um for the last few months my wife and I have been uh experiencing extreme tiredness being tired extreme being tired and we had no idea that we had a problem at home our furnace uh our furnace uh heater how not uh um chage yeah was uh given giving off carbon monoxide and it is uh for those of you who may not be familiar with that we call a silent killer we were experiencing being tired we experienced being nauseated personally memory lapse uh just just all of the symptom that comes with that but we had idea where it was coming from many times I would go to church and I would be so tired I didn't even feel like [Music] preaching amen so for the month of January I had the young Brothers preaching for me on Wednesday because physically I just wasn't able to do it but to make a long story short God in his rich and mercy just a few months months ago prior to this incident we had a new system install a system that would alert you to carbon monoxide poison and had not we gotten that system my wife and I would probably be in glory right now that a system alerted my wife she called the fire department and basically they shut our house down and and and we had to get out so we stayed in the hotel for a couple of days get that that out of our system and now that everything has been repaired now that everything has been repaired my wife and I are are now um moving forward in our health I don't know whether you heard a few years ago of a young couple in Li Ohio who who house exploded exploded they were young couple just recently married they were just recently married and because the carbon monoxide was exploding in the air they must to LIT something and the house exploded and and both of them were killed so those of you who have heaters water heaters things of that nature that could get fil block blocked uh where the gas would leak it might be good if you go get you a portable carbon monoxide uh unit it doesn't cost much but it will be good to have something like that in your house should anything go bad especially if you're living in an apartment or something like that they don't always keep up with the modern stuff so it be good if you get that kind of system just just just to be safe because you could die in your sleep you won't even know it literally takes all the oxygen out of the air amen you understand me the same kind of thing happened to a couple a family a family from an Iowa a few years ago that went to Jamaica and they were in a hotel in Jamaica they fell asleep and never awake because of the carbon monoxide so I just thought I'd throw that in as a testimony and as a warning because my wife and I had no idea we would be deal with that amen you love the Lord amen I'm I'm I'm happy to be still I'm happy still to to be on this side I look for my day to go to Glory but I'm okay right now am amen so we're going to preach this morning something that's been really heavy on my heart I I listen to brother Brandon's message you must be born again that's in 196 I believe uh anyway it's yeah Janu it's December 31st 1961 or 62 uh yeah 61 but it was a message that really uh uh uh gripped my heart because I believe the message of the hour and I believe it with all my heart but I also believe that it's supposed to be living uh we supposed to see a greater Supernatural among ourselves than we're seeing and uh you know I know God is good and I know he's been good good to us and the thought is not in the word within us we know the promises I didn't listen to the message that brother Isaiah preached last week but I heard it was so and I heard a little bit of through our brother's prayer and and that's wonderful all of the blessings are ours but but I want you to understand you had Jacob and you had Esau and Jacob was the Shyer Jac received the blessings Jacob and Jacob received the promises of the blessing Hallelujah but he had to make a [Music] transition in order to receive the blessing understand me in order for the the the blessings to be made manifest to wrestle with with the angel hallelujah amen we're living in a time which is a dangerous time we have been so distracted we we we can I can I just be playing this morning we've spent so much time fussing and fighting and and we we've allowed the devil to distract us this is the hour of maturity you understand me we supposed to be maturing and not acting like Galatians arguing doctrinal things we supposed to be more mature more up the road Hallelujah and the question that comes to mind what kind of birth have you see we are not of this world and that's my subject we are not of this world and we must bear that in mind because as long as we realize we're not of this world we will not allow ourselves to be consumed by it Hallelujah the Bible says that we are new creatures in Christ we are a new creation all things have pass away and behold all things have become new now the word just doesn't state that just for the intellectual understanding but that word must be made manifest there's a manifestation of that word and and brother Bram talks about it Hallelujah he called it a special class of people hallelujah there are people on this earth right now that know that they are bride hallelujah amen and they are pressing into Hallelujah maturity understand because a baby is not born a man he must mature into a man he's got all the potentials of being a man but he must go grow he must go through trials he must experience life hallelujah amen in order to become a man so is with the bride of Christ if you're born again you don't stay a baby you don't act like children you must learn to mature hallelujah amen and I'm not chastising you I'm not chastising you I might it may sound like I'm fussing I'm not fussing I'm trying to get your attention Hallelujah you know I love the people of God but the worst thing we could come up with at the end of our journey and find out we didn't have what it takes now is your time hallelujah amen now the the this was the first doctrine of Jesus you you must be born again and I thought about the many stories brother Bram talked about and he talked about a little catholic man who had pork a pig and it was on a Friday and Friday every Catholic know is fish day but he didn't have any fish so he thought he would sprinkle it with holy water and with this holy water it would turn the pig or the pork into [Music] fish and brother said it doesn't matter how much he sprinkles the pork with holy water it never change the pork into fish y hear me amen so let me say it like this it doesn't matter how much you sprinkle yourself with religion your religion will never change you Hallelujah the change in which we must have is a born again [Music] change come from the soul hallelujah amen and see this is where we have fallen short and when I say fallen short I'm trying to tell you I've had a lot of experiences and and they were Supernatural ones but I knew that Within Myself there still needed to be a change everybody knows I don't have to tell you everybody knows when they need a change Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying all of us can hide behind the word Grace Grace but Grace only gives you the time to make it right hallelujah amen and the grace if you don't make that that which is wrong right it become disgrace hallelujah amen that's the difference law would kill you Grace gives you time to fix it hallelujah hallelujah amen you see we are living in a time we must be born again here once death strikes you there's no change however you die that's the way you would come y'all remember that brother brandham said that the reason why God protects all of us now because there's a blood Veil around the earth if you're not right death will take you beyond the blood Veil and he said when you go beyond the blood Veil there is nothing but judgment hallelujah amen we are not of this world I want to I want I have you see we've been born here in the physical yes and I in in your DNA in this world is cursed amen amen this is why Jesus had to come by and give us a blood transfusion the blood transfusion comes by way of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen if you don't have the Holy Ghost you you're just a a pork or p trying to live like a dove it impossible I'm not trying to make you feel bad it'll get better as it go but I want you to understand it's not just religion we've got the Baptist religion we have the Baptist religion we have the Presbyterian religion we have the Catholic religion we have the Pentecostal religion and we have the message religion but God ain't interested in the message religion no more than he was interested when Nicodemus came to him by Night a Pharisee of Pharisees he was more like the message people of that day and and Jesus said you must be born you say brother Brooks this is Elementary principle and this is the foundation we we supposed to be in the top of the tree right now y'all hear what I'm saying but how can you be up in the top of the tree if your birth is not a correct one do you understand that the devil has been giving out false births Hallelujah the true birth of Jesus Christ says Amen to every word oh I got a quote so you understand I'm not just saying anything you say I'm going describe a false birth a false birth is a man or woman who thinks that they've been born again who thinks that they have been born again because they spoke in tongues but there was no change a false birth is a person who has shouted and danced in the spirit think that they have the Holy Ghost because they shouted and they dance but there is no change you understand what I'm saying and there are many people who believe they got it because God gave them a new spirit Hallelujah and they were able to do these things but until that Holy Ghost get into the soul of a man man woman he cannot change she cannot change because she Still Remains the Same person y'all hear what I'm saying she is not enough to say I know William Bram is the messenger of the hour milons of people knew that Moses was the messenger of the hour Hallelujah but Joshua and Caleb had different Spirits because they caught the Revelation that it wasn't just a man but there was a god behind the [Music] man hallelujah amen and so we must understand Hallelujah that even just obeying the word is good but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe amen y'all better hear what I'm saying listen what brother says in the message you must be born again paragraph 106 he's a preacher many will come to me that day say Lord have have not I cast out devils in your name preachers have not I done Mighty works evangelists on the field depart from me you workers of iniquity illegitimate children that's right you mean preachers you mean evangelists hallelujah amen hasn't that's why you see so much trouble you understand me a true man of God will never see glory for himself I don't care how great the gift of preaching I don't care how great the singing is when a true man or woman of God is truly born again all glory be to God if you're born again you're washed in the water of the word separated from the things of the world and believe God here it is separated from the things of the world and believe God he said you're dead you're dead to your own thinking dead to your own ideas dead to everything else but God's word and it lives in you it lives in you working back through you proving that it's God's word hallelujah you say I'm dead to to I'm dead to the world brother Bram and deny God's word so you can't be dead to the world and deny God's word hallelujah amen listen what he says in paragraph 108 Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe now if we getting down to what Born Again means see still with tempers still mean arrogant somebody say something about you you right up ready to fight and then you're born of the spirit of God he said no no God's spirit don't do like that God's spirit is humble longsuffering that's God's loving kind of forgiv [Music] that's God's hallelujah amen some Christians you can't hardly say nothing and they're ready to fight but they got the Holy Ghost no no no that must die whether you be male or female it Hallelujah God don't care about the way you feel because if you're dead you don't feel nothing hallelujah amen I can kick a gr I can kick a dead man and he'll never grunt right I can slap a dead man and he'll never move he's dead and when you're dead to yourself tribulation can come upon you persecution can come upon you and it won't move you Hallelujah am H we're not of this world think about your actions anything that's contrary to the word doesn't belong in heaven and when your action is betraying hell that's where the inspiration is coming from Hallelujah you said that can't be yes it is let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven [Music] Hallelujah when you get out of control I'm out hey that ain't Holy Ghost F that ain't Holy Ghost F that means you got to die some more I'm not saying you don't have it you may have it but you got to mature that's got to die oh it's the truth you see people say well they should have picked me to sing today and they picked someone else what do you care it ain't about you let God be glorify you understand me when we as a body come together we work together there are there is no individuality here there's only one person that is to be glorified and that's Jesus Christ himself and we should work together to make sure he's [Applause] glorified no no big eyes and little yous here from the P pit to the back of the door we're here for one purpose and that is God that be glorified and you got to fight for the unity hallelujah amen I was telling somebody I said it would be really wonderful if we had Elders that we could talk to and they can talk back and not tell no one else but it's it's so bad now you can't even trust anybody people are not even mature enough to keep secrets Hallelujah and then when you tell them something they become a truth breaker or I'll not tell nobody and then you go tell somebody that's a liar that's a truth breaker that's a immature Christian but if we're going to make a rapture we must be mature we must allow the Holy Spirit to work on us we must allow ourselves to be [Music] humbled hallelujah amen is that right coming from the same message you must be born again and I want everyone that can go and listen to that go listen for yourself he said you come the way of the brass altar the brass altar you come the way of the Brazen serpent you die you actually die oh oh God why can't I say it right this brother he said you die somebody how many of us have actually died you know you died hallelujah amen literally died to yourself you died to the things of the world and are born a new a new creation now remember who what happened to you yesterday who offended you a few weeks ago all of that is dead hallelujah amen amen amen no world the things of the world is dead there's no shortcut see they want to come right quick right that's the way we want to quick we quick quick quick he said no no no it doesn't it's not quick they don't want to grow is that right people get saved and they think now that they're saved they got to touch from the lord they're grown you're not an adult yet you're just a spiritual baby you've only just begun and a lot of times often times those who supposed to be mature don't have patience for the babies well you got to do it this way you got to do it that way you need to know it this way you need they must grow just like you grew oh y'all getting quiet now after a while you'll make somebody a two-fold child or hell if you're not watchful you'll make a person a two-fold child or hell because they will obey you instead of obeying the word because they're afraid to be re you know you going to reject them hello somebody and we don't have enough love to love people that's learning I know what I'm talking about I often wondered why God brought me through the apostolic church or the Pentecost church because you didn't learn nothing but laws you got to do this way you got to do it that way you got to do it this way I had a lot of clothes but my clothes was colorful and the Pentecostal Church you only you had to wear blue black brown you know those colors anything outside of those kind of colors they weren't allowed they weren't allowed those colors for an example for example I'm I'm off a message but I'm going to give a testimony I'm off so when I first got saved I had a big afro I wore my black bow tie my white silk shirt a big old red rose on the on on the [Music] side my red pants and what y'all call platform shoes shoes for men my high heel shoes for that's what they were and they were black and white I was a Target you know what I'm saying I thought I was looking good but they the first thing they told me you got to get some new clothes wouldn't even allow me to wear my clothes I had to go find me some new clothes listen I was so willing to do it because I wanted to be saved they weren't [Music] wrong in what I should wear they were wrong in the way they approached and I we're we're not of this world this is what we must bear in our hearts and our minds if you're not of this world you are citizens of Heaven dress like heaven dresses you dress like they would dress in heaven Hall I'm going to say it like this in heaven they don't wear shoes so we wear shoes but we wear the shoes that will match more to Heaven than the shoes that will match more to hell I'm just I'm just saying brother said when he saw all of them they were dressed and they were all bare feet hallelujah amen y'all Y that's okay I know this almost like a teaching but this is okay as long you're all right with it my my point is this we must understand who we are we can't mingle with the world and expect God to bless us Abraham couldn't even be blessed by God I mean until lot separated himself can't fully bless you you're blessed you got the blessings can't fully bless you until you separate from the world hallelujah amen these all died in faith those who were before us died in faith they didn't have what we got now now we got the real deal how many y that Hallelujah amen let's go to St John I'm keep it long but got a few quotes I really want to read because I know so many people who have had experiences with God but you can you can tell that the soul hasn't been changed just by their apparel you you you don't wear apparel that will cause lust if your soul has been changed hallelujah amen you know it's rarely a rare thing I know in America it's a rare thing to find a virgin wearing clothes that's not becoming to a virgin most most of the time you can tell what a girl is by the way she dress and that's the truth you can tell she she she she she's very conscious of her body Hallelujah and she she want to keep that concealed see a virgin can't stand the idea of a man lusting after her but when a girl is not a virgin I'm not saying on every case I'm just saying from my observance hallelujah amen you know she she does different things to get attention you know what I'm saying she does now y'all women know better than I do but I'm just saying if you are the virgin of Christ you're going to present your body in a different way because your body is belongs to your husband you don't want nobody looking at this only his understand Hallelujah that's the way it's supposed to go hallelujah amen hallelujah amen St John 3n 1 through I'm not trying to make you shout or anything I don't do that anyway but my desire is that the word will shake you even can get you mad at me today that would be so wonderful because if you get upset at me you're not going to forget what I'm telling you he come up in here with that oh my God but listen my problem I won't call it a problem say I love the people of God I really do what I call the good and the bad I'm not going to be partial with any of you I love people I love and my enemy is the devil it's not any individuals I don't care how you act towards me at of day I'm going to love you see starting at the first verse there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou are teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doeth except God be with [Music] I Marvel that brother brandom comes along with a message called you must be born again like like we we are like Nicodemus and no matter how religious we've been he said you must be born again Hallelujah and see because he was embarrassed and that's what's wrong with a lot of people in the message you know you're not where you're supposed to be so you get embarassed when the word of God comes like it is because you don't want nobody else to know your situation with God just just like nicod but let me say it like this if you want to hide your situation still meet him at night meet him at night meet him in a secret place where you can truly get born again contact Jesus Jesus answered and said to him verily verily I say unto you to thee except a man be born again again he cannot see the kingdom of God and Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God which is born of flesh is flesh which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee you must be born again that word must mean means you have no option this is his criteria this is his mandate you must born again you can't even get there no Flesh and Blood shall enter Heaven inherit it's only the spirit man that man or woman that's truly been born again Hallelujah you talking about Revival let this church have a Revival if everybody leave here today say God I'm not going to stop till I know that I'm dead Hallelujah and I know when I'm dead because when I'm dead it makes you alive you be what I think about during the day Hallelujah I think about you in the morning I think about you in the noon day I think about you in the evening I think about you in the at night Jesus you will be my mind that's the kind of death he wants us to have that that early church that's all they knew they knew Jesus they could care less about what's happening in Rome Hallelujah they didn't care about Rome activities they care about the Gladiators and all of the circuses all they had on their minds was to tell the story huah that Jesus died that Jesus rose and that Jesus was living and he was living in them Hallelujah is that right take it oh take for an example one man brother Bram spent his entire life his entire life telling the world about Jesus Hallelujah that was it I believe it was Billy Paul that told brother Brandon daddyy that's all you talk about is Jesus Hallelujah is that right what else I'm supposed to talk about Hallelujah I'm not into politics I'm not into the social clicks it's all about Jesus hallelujah amen but when you talk about Jesus all the time even in the message they don't want to be around you you too ftic you talk about Jesus too much what else I'm supposed Hallelujah because if I'm dead and he's alive I must talk about him not not about me who is dead talk about him who is alive hallelujah amen he said the wind blows where it list and th Hearth the sound thereof cannot cannot cannot tell when it cometh and where it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit huah and none of us have seen the we've never seen it we've seen the effects of it Hallelujah and if the wind has blown in your life we are going to see the effects of it Hallelujah you love the Lord my God see it's a must and this is where the devil is getting us because we don't know how to die Jesus didn't know how to die Jesus didn't know how to die but God led him to calary Hallelujah you understand me God will take you there you got to be sincere about Hallelujah don't think you coming to God and you got everything else on your mind hallelu no you got to come to God with him only on your mind you stay there on your knees Jesus is everything hallelujah amen one thing I know about the Holy Ghost one thing I know about the Holy Ghost he knows all your secrets amen and guess what when you get on your knees he going to tell you about all those secret things that you got to give up and die to every one of them and I I know I've been on my knees at times thinking I'm done then all of a sudden here it comes again another wave Hallelujah and you got to get it right but when you get it right oh there's no feeling like that hallelujah amen St John 17 help me now let me hurry Hallelujah St John 17 13-8 and then I'm going to read a few quotes here and I mean the Lord amen people I'm just trying to help because I believe the time is short whether you realize it or not we're already in World many know that we are in World War and you know I heard brother bam say before one Bomb Dr there's bombs dropping now but then I found a quote I got it he said before one bomb strikes this nation amen am before one bom drop drop on This Nation the Bride of Jesus Christ will be I couldn't figure it out because I mean the bride is everywhere even in Ukraine we've got Believers but bombs are going off everywhere but this quote identifyed before one bomb drop he talking about this nation don't you understand the only reason why he's holding it up because we're not ready like we should be we're the ones that's holding it up if we make ourselves ready he could then let everything happen it's just his mercy and Grace with us and now the 13th verse and now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves so see so the Holy Ghost didn't come just to save you he came to fill you with his Joy and we don't we don't have joy we we get happy but we need Joy hallelujah amen I have given them Thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world that's where my came I am not of this world you are not of this world so I can't allow them to influence me Hallelujah May the word of God be my influence I pray not that thou should take them out of the world 15th verse but that thou should keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am not of the world can we identify with him can we identify with Jesus I am not of the world and if he's not of this world neither am I I may not be able to understand it all but I do know that I am a pilgrim and a stranger Hallelujah there's one thing I'm not confused with and I'm I'm not confused with where where I came from I came from God and I'm going back God hallelujah I'm not one from Hell Hallelujah I didn't come from Hell therefore I don't go back to Hell y understand me there's something in me which must be ticking in you as well otherwise you wouldn't be here all of us we are here to get closer to God so don't get mad or frustrated with the word the word is a it com to correct you and that correction is to help you make us all better Christians hallelujah amen listen what about your best friend if your best friend is not uh H can't tell you your fault or talk to you and tell you he not your best friend amen amen cuz your best friend going to tell you the truth whether you like it or not hallelujah amen and let me tell you who my best friend is my best friend is Jesus Christ Hallelujah I can count on him to tell me the truth whether this flesh like it or not Hallelujah and the flesh don't like to be corrected y'all know it's the truth hallelujah amen you love the Lord sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth so when you believe the word that sanctifies you when you see it as truth you will cleanse yourself will cleanse you it will change you it matures you that's how you Sanctified by the word and when you're caught wrong and the word say this is the way it is you change to the word now you're Sanctified that's a process too hallelujah amen now I'm going read a quote here you must be born again paragraph 129 and I'm not going to be too much longer he says now false teachers will bring false vers will bring the word the birth of the word Christ false prophets will bring false birth the the birth of churches the birth of Creeds the birth of denomination let me ask you a question what's your birth I'm in the message that's the birth of hallelujah amen you need a birth of God you need Christ birth the birth of the word Hallelujah yall understand what I'm saying there's differences so many people have been in the message and they still don't know God I can talk with brother Frank I see brother Frank Fellowship brother Frank is not my imagination I'm not seeing some kind of vision he's real I can touch him he can touch that's the kind of relationship you supposed to have with God deeper than that you understand me you can't get on your knees and try to feel for God suppos to be real you understand how can you have how can you have an intimate relationship with your imagination no so not so not so he must be real let's put it this way so you better brother Bram said when the seals were open it put us back in the Garden of Eden before the fall and God would come down every evening and talk and fellowship with it was a real relationship Hallelujah am that's the kind of relationship the message has brought back to us but we must press into it by faith All Things become possible Hallelujah brother Brandon wasn't imagining things when the angel talked to him he told what Ang said and he had so much confidence in him he didn't whatever he said it'll never fail because whatever the angel said to him he took it back to the [Music] word is that right and then it was a thus said the Lord hallelujah amen he didn't have a fake experience he said whatever your experience does not match with the word get rid of hallelujah amen hallelujah amen I'm I'm this is my last quote okay this is the only way to escape and if you really believe and maybe you know I I say it like this I was telling a friend the other day God has been good to me my life has not been so easy but it hasn't been the worst other people have suffered more other people have suffered worse than I have hallelujah amen I didn't ride around in [Music] Cadillacs I never own a Mercedes Hallelujah but God has been good to [Music] me he has kept me fed he has kept me closed Hallelujah having eight children my children never went hungry they never went hungry children never went hungry they always had a place to stay he's been good to me he gave me a good wife you understand me he gave me salvation God's been good to me amen and all I can say if he choose to send me to hell he would be just in doing it what yes because without the blood of Jesus without his Amazing Grace hallelujah amen I'm no different than anyone else hallelujah amen it is only the blood of Jesus and the unconditional Covenant hey you hear what I'm saying the unconditional Covenant that he has given me that's the only reason why I can stand here today amen amen and like brother brand said I don't say this just just a quote him my understanding confir I go to hell with if I go to hell with the spirit that's in me all I would be able to do is worship God in hell y'all hear me cuz all I know he was good to me good to me yeah folks there we my mom died when I went was going to my senior year in high school daddy never had nothing to do with me I had to learn live I to learn how to survive Hallelujah he brought me from a mighty long how can I be ashamed of him Hallelujah am how can I be ashamed of him hallelujah amen no no no no no if it means my life my life so be it paragraph 72 must born again our souls are placed by faith on his brass altar I read that one I'm jump that one I'm sorry brother where the church be go before the tribulation this is where I'm at and before the Adam Bomb can strike this nation what he strike this nation the church will go in the Rapture to meet the Lord Jesus now the Bible says if that same spirit in Christ Jesus if it dwells in your it will Quicken you that's the only way you'll see a Rapture see and if the and the missiles are set and and the Hammers are pulled back fles the angels are standing in water the great corridors of Heaven is is crowded full there's a homing homecoming time pretty soon for the Church of the Living God who has been waiting for his coming everything is in order I'm so glad I'm getting so tired oh for that great hour Hallelujah is that all right correct now I said that was the last but I had a different way but but but my point is this if we want to get out of here people we must realize that this world is being is going to be destroyed let me ask you a question how would you feel about God if you lived in Ukraine where the bombs are dropping babies are dying folks your mama your grandma everybody would you still have faith in God we're coming to a place you're going to be tried and you can't make it without the soul being changed and God gave us a true example Peter was a true follower of Jesus Christ but when the pressure came he couldn't take it he wanted to but he didn't have the god power on the inside what you talking about yes God breathed on them the Holy Spirit and it was promise and they had that Spirit on their on their Spirit but the not yet Chang that Soul was changed on the day of Pentecost the holy GH came Soul now you saw a man who was a c now standing up preaching the word of God Hallelujah and you still afraid to testify of Christ there's something wrong with your experience okay I'm G let this be the last quote for real Hallelujah people science have broken have broke into God's laboratory until they could come until they're going to destroy themselves God let always let wisdom destroy himself God doesn't destroy anything man destroy himself by he did at the beginning taking Satan wisdom instead of God's word hallelujah amen now she knows she must give way she cannot stand it Russia I believe would destroy this nation if she thought that she could destroy it preserve herself and any of those little Nations can do it but they afraid because they know that the world cannot stand in its orbit under such conditions so the world knows that her birth pains is so great there's going to be a new birth born at hand I'm thankful for that I'm tired of this one anyone knows that that here is the place of death death and sorrow and all kinds of discrepancies and so forth I'm glad that she has to give way I'm glad that time is at hand John said of old even so come Lord Jesus now she must rot of course as I said in order to bring new birth look what she has R roted into notice myen she's totally rotten her politics and system just as as they can be there isn't a sound bone in her in her World Systems her Poli her politics her religious politics and whatever it is one says one says I'm a Democrat I'm a republican I'm a Methodist I'm Baptist why the whole thing is rotten to the PO there's got to be something give way can't stand if you put a George Washington abam Lincoln in every country in this United States still couldn't come back Redemption hallelujah amen y understand ameny I I I there ain't no such thing as making America great again it's against the word she got a r look how rotten she's become and the worst hadn't come yet they F to turn against y Christians did you know our America turning against Christians in their politics they are implementing La the Christian oh y'all think it's just America no no no it's world this is a worldly event this is this is Satan moving remember the stage has been set for the bride the stage has been set for the it must become its darkest in order for the bride to reflect her light y'all hear what I'm saying it just there is no safe place the only safe place is in Jesus that's it it ain't going to get no better overnight the start can crash the stock market can crash overnight and what is it going to leave you with if you ain't got Jesus you got nothing y'all hear what I'm saying now I'm going to say this and I'm closing we're not of this world so you need to refocus on your soul and maturity God you must come to God says Lord make me that perfect man bring me up into that perfect man status where I should be I'm worth nothing you understand me you can un father you can un father without the Holy Ghost you're what the bomb's going to bust up but just like he said before one bomb strike this nation and and look what America is doing she's poking the bear she's doing everything to make sure this happens they can't help it they under
