[0:00] and who stood alone with God
[0:04] why
[0:06] this is a great witness testimony had
[0:09] come near
[0:11] let me just read it
[0:14] let me read it
[0:21] I used a really bad French
[0:24] says
[0:28] God God called man
[0:33] uh look at what it has done here now
[0:38] let's make this one please he pulls down
[0:41] his Spirit the spirit of his son
[0:45] he accomplished this signs and wonders
[0:47] and miracles
[0:51] what the world had never seen in those
[0:54] are past two thousand years
[0:58] the scientific word
[1:00] took a picture of it
[1:03] the spill of Fire
[1:06] the angel of God the Lord
[1:08] [Music]
[1:10] was hanging in Washington DC this
[1:13] afternoon
[1:15] in The Gallery of Art and villages
[1:19] the only
[1:22] supernatural being
[1:23] [Music]
[1:25] who had never ever been uh pictured with
[1:30] scientific proof
[1:31] [Music]
[1:34] he produces the same science uh wonders
[1:39] and science yes they said what it is
[1:43] what is it
[1:45] it's about cruising Jordan
[1:50] to fund yourself with God
[1:53] to stay there
[1:56] in that furnace with him
[2:00] that's what made the the this picture of
[2:04] the Holy Spirit a human
[2:07] a human with flesh a believer
[2:11] who crossed the Jordan
[2:13] and stood alone with God
[2:16] that's why the pillow fight was pictured
[2:23] I'll never go with this pillow fire in
[2:26] the tone on the grave
[2:28] it would stay with the church
[2:31] but the preachers
[2:33] the preacher says
[2:35] [Music]
[2:37] can you stay with the pillow fight
[2:41] that's the preachers today those schools
[2:44] are prophets
[2:46] knowledge
[2:49] they said
[2:52] the pillow fight cannot never be with
[2:55] you what is he gonna do with you
[2:57] are you a eight uh message that's the
[3:00] school of medicine Prophets
[3:02] but the pillow fire
[3:05] gotta be with each believer
[3:09] what it fell down on the Pentecost
[3:13] I was a pillow fire
[3:15] it was divided with a lot of ton of
[3:18] fires and I believe Believers and I
[3:21] think believers
[3:24] has to have the pillow fire
[3:27] working with the pillow fire
[3:30] if you really you are a reader of the
[3:32] Bible the Bible said
[3:34] the angel of the Lord
[3:38] Camp among those that are feeling and
[3:42] take them away from danger
[3:44] D'Angelo the Lord is the Lord himself
[3:53] Branham says bill of fire is not God
[3:57] but the pillow fire is the attribute of
[4:00] God the attribute of his presence
[4:04] so when you whenever you set a pillow
[4:06] fire that means God is with you
[4:10] in a different form
[4:14] the pillow fire literally
[4:19] [Music]
[4:23] that means god is there
[4:27] because God has a human form
[4:30] but whenever you see the pedophile is
[4:33] the attribute of this presence
[4:42] had to do that steps head to cross
[4:47] and I believe I took a long time
[4:52] I'm gonna hurry up a little bit foreign
[4:55] and then we can stop from today
[5:00] and next Sunday the pastor is going to
[5:03] be here with us
[5:06] he told me that he's going to preach
[5:08] here on Sunday
[5:11] and after that I will come back
[5:16] the following Sunday is going to be the
[5:18] ninth it's going to be uh the Passover
[5:23] and he asked me to bring a message of uh
[5:26] Easter
[5:30] so next Sunday please comment so you can
[5:33] listen to our pastor
[5:36] now listen
[5:40] I want to go
[5:44] I want to hurry so we can finish for
[5:46] today
[5:49] I'm in a hurry to finish all the message
[5:51] the entire message
[5:54] that's what I do I know that people
[5:56] already have the message
[6:01] you gonna struggle in the puppet as as
[6:04] if you're gonna finish all the entire
[6:05] message you're gonna kill yourself for
[6:08] nothing the message is gonna stay there
[6:10] but you're gonna go away
[6:17] he's struggling you're struggling we all
[6:20] know the message
[6:22] most people here know the message
[6:28] so the problem is not about quoting
[6:30] quoting quoting
[6:33] and people go out and they know they
[6:36] don't even understand what you talked
[6:38] about
[6:39] but the message is large
[6:41] it's huge he's not going to finish in
[6:43] one day
[6:46] you can even go and leave the message
[6:49] that's why I want to give little and I
[6:52] go rest
[6:54] I come back a little bit and I'll go
[6:56] back to race
[6:58] that's what I do
[7:01] I'm not here to show somebody or to
[7:05] prove or to finish them you go you're
[7:08] never gonna end the message
[7:10] but you can end up yourself
[7:12] a message will never end
[7:14] but you can end up yourself
[7:19] now listen
[7:21] the prophet did you did the prophet God
[7:22] says
[7:26] what can make the day out the devil fear
[7:31] s
[7:36] that doesn't
[7:37] [Music]
[7:37] um
[7:40] oh that doesn't matter how
[7:43] that doesn't matter how much you can cry
[7:45] to the devil to the devil
[7:50] oh the fact of crying and shouting in
[7:52] church
[7:55] that doesn't matter to the devil
[7:59] how much you can Shout
[8:05] that doesn't matter how much you can
[8:08] jump
[8:10] how much you can do this in there
[8:13] but What Hurts the Most to the day
[8:18] is to see that sanctify life
[8:23] holy and consecrated to God
[8:27] that's why it hurts the most to the
[8:30] devil
[8:32] say no matter what to that person
[8:35] you can treat him with any name
[8:42] we always stay sweet go forward
[8:55] maybe you didn't get this
[8:57] yes
[8:58] what can make the devil fear
[9:03] devil doesn't care how much we shout in
[9:05] church
[9:08] the devil is not scared of how much we
[9:10] say Amen in church
[9:12] because the devil also know the same
[9:14] word the Bible says
[9:18] they will believe and also trouble
[9:23] sometimes
[9:25] you believe that you don't even tremble
[9:28] but the devil believes in trouble
[9:33] the fact of crying or shouting
[9:37] just saying amen
[9:40] that's not what uh skills the devil
[9:43] but what scale the devil is the it's the
[9:47] Holy Spirit sanctified
[9:51] that's what is a thunder
[9:54] in Davis years
[9:57] that's why the prophet God said
[10:01] so no matter how would you say Amen
[10:04] devil is not scared of it
[10:07] because the Devil is a Believer as well
[10:09] he also goes to church and this morning
[10:12] the devil is here in this church
[10:17] he is a Believer he carries his Bible he
[10:20] goes to church
[10:24] to see believers
[10:28] you don't see believer as a church it's
[10:31] not a church
[10:33] where you seek the Christians Christian
[10:36] you see Christians outside
[10:39] that's why we see True Believers or
[10:42] Christians
[10:44] so what I'm asking the church this
[10:47] morning
[10:49] so we can do that jump
[10:53] so we can cross the Jordan
[10:56] the children of the pride of life
[11:01] the Jordan Jordan of president
[11:09] God wants us to cross that
[11:13] so we can stand alone with him
[11:17] and have a better vision
[11:20] because when Elisha crossed it Jordan he
[11:24] had a vision
[11:25] and I watched I won each one of us this
[11:28] morning
[11:30] God gives you a vision on your life
[11:34] crossing the Jordan
[11:37] that God gives you a new project
[11:40] God gives you a new purpose to pursue a
[11:44] new vision
[11:46] that's better than what you had this
[11:48] morning that's why brothers and sisters
[11:52] that wants us to cross the Jordan
[11:54] so we can go down to the Jordan
[11:58] the knowledge
[11:59] and desire
[12:02] a new knowledge
[12:04] comes from God himself
[12:06] and that knowledge will come
[12:10] only when we cross the journey
[12:13] only when we receive the holy spirit
[12:14] because Barbara says when God gives you
[12:19] the Holy Spirit
[12:21] continue
[12:24] everything that you need
[12:27] all over your journey
[12:29] on this Earth
[12:32] through the glory
[12:34] so this morning
[12:36] I want us to cruise to go beyond
[12:41] where God is going to sinner with the
[12:43] spirit what is going to give us when
[12:46] he's going to give us
[12:48] everything that's uh enough for for our
[12:52] uh Earth Journey
[12:56] everything that we need for our journey
[12:59] on Earth
[13:00] is money on it houses on it
[13:04] the power of God on it
[13:07] children's kids on there
[13:09] everything that we need
[13:11] and to have that
[13:14] is when you cross the Jordan
[13:16] you have the Holy Spirit
[13:18] God puts in US everything we need
[13:22] that's why Jordan is really important
[13:25] you know uh believer's life in a
[13:27] Christian's life
[13:30] the Jordan is really really important
[13:34] aside artists
[13:37] fraternities
[13:41] let's pursue one purpose
[13:44] only purpose that's Jesus Christ may the
[13:47] Lord bless you
[13:48] let's say
[13:56] if
[13:58] they can lead us a song
[14:14] thank you
[14:28] it's me standing
[14:31] Champion we're going to sing with
[14:34] meditation
[14:36] then we can get and get in prayer
[14:41] and asking God to separate us from the
[14:44] things of the world
[14:46] so we can stay alone with him that's
[14:49] what God wants
[14:53] um
