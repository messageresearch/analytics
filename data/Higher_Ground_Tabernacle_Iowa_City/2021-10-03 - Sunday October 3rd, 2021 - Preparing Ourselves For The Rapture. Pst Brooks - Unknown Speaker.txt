trying to get here on time [Music] amen [Music] i guess i feel like brother branham [Music] [Music] some of your minds we had been discussing at times about trying to move the church and do something of that nature and of course that's out of the picture now we're just going to stay here till jesus come uh jesus [Music] yeah we're not trying to put a stress [Music] god is good amen [Music] hallelujah we're just going to go right into the word of god it's all one prayer upon the jew there's a lot of things that are on my heart yeah she won't care and i kind of started this little message there in des moines but i want to add i've added more to it yeah i believe that we're in a time a time where we we must uh we must redeem the time amen turn with us amen to second timothy the fourth chapter bladder second timothy the fourth chapter and we're going to read the eighth verse henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love is appearing here amen let us pray our heavenly father personalist once again we thank you for your grace for the peace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you have done for us lord and we're so grateful to you lord recon father we pray that you bless each and every house well we are certain that this message is a hundred percent right some [Music] and i don't know about you but i'm willing to do both of them we know the scripture according to matthew 25. where there were five wives and five foolish virgins we have they sang from sahaja yog from fall the five that was wise had all an extra oil in the lamps and the other five a lesotho is our word considered foolish considering the fall because she did not discern the time and so therefore she was very slawful and she is a tale about making sure she had all in her lamp so i want to encourage everybody today because often times when we we we think to ourselves because we are the message in the song because because you feel quiet you have already been deceived because the spirit of laodicea fascinates me it's not a time nor is it a place but it is a spirit message dentistry amen amen and so we know by god's grace did you brother branham has been gone for about 56 years i thank god for the prophet of god for the prophet the truth i thank the lord for all that he did to you but i know that when the prophet left the scene but that anointed elijah will also anoint elijah is that right many people believe in different ways and they have a right to do so he's only out of the currency but our right ears that we must love one another knew their phone is amazing regardless it's not your faith in what you think you believe but divine love a vindication from god himself did you remember because it's not something that you can make up okay yeah understand me we have been fighting in this message he speaks of the systems that the laodiceans are governed by [Music] adam had to make a choice seems what the church says secondly versus what the word says sometimes it's what the brother says the force is over what the word says but brother tells us all the things even our way of thinking must change hallelujah amen because we are free basking we are not people that are in bondage to no man in order to remain free you must be able to hear the voice of god amen amen because those who are led by the spirit our bodies must be surrendered to god surrender to god so much closer okay sometimes [Music] don't know [Music] you know brother adam said it like this improving his word from he said uh the true believers he said he proves his word not by those who say they believe paparazzi because you understand basketball it is the make-believer the song with the word hallelujah but when you truly believe the word the [Music] we've been encouraged by paul right now y'all agree with that this is his in because this is the time the preparation so hallelujah lay of the seer has been spewing out of his mouth we've entered into an eternal age and brother branham said this bride is the next always god is always there je to jolla for our defense to another defense amen hallelujah amen now it's difficult hallelujah amen let me explain something to you listen more of the speaking this perfection set perfection cannot be processed in your mind because we do not know so when god drops perfection in you allah amen because it is with the heart i think look here we have vision vision a man sees love of war his heart doesn't care not these parts she's why don't you wipe these kind of people off the face of the because you and i could never reach perfect love looking through the natural senses and judging our brothers we must learn hallelujah hallelujah and what god is saying to the prophet of god come behind the door let me show you hey listen what the that you'll know better than this woman over here it's the same [Applause] jesus christ the that's why he let her do what she was doing because [Music] let's use the woman when she wear makeup elevate the makeup she's a cover-up there's something there's something she's hiding not just because she want to be beautiful but there is something she's hiding and she wants to give you a different impression what's inside them hallelujah is that right gee that's the way church is due circumcision we will put a make-up on them we will carry on in services everything is fine just to give the visitors the love of god feel the love of god control amen hallelujah giving your whole body to god we don't have respect to a person none of a person respected a person but i'm just going to turn to matthew 9 16. you can just write it down if you like you need well you know i i i do believe this and maybe i'm wrong but this is what i believe and and and i believe in having assurance it's more than a belief call me to the ministry and my my whole desire a monday is to preach as far as the mysteries [Music] because he knows now what they are right now not revelation now so you understand what i'm saying the devil saw legion i mean legion saw christ coming elon viveni it wasn't the natural man he was afraid of in a temper was not afraid of what he saw legends when he saw the body of christ but he knew that he said in that tabernacle fullness y'all hear what i'm saying [Applause] but when you begin this when you don't [Music] you're getting quiet on me see because you better hear what i'm saying because if you let the devil take your children guaranteed you're going to get them won't be nobody's fault and let me tell you something even if you're not going to teach them at home civilization you ought to at least have a sunday school here to be honest we have allowed ourselves to be selfish is don't do this it'll be a two second you should do it first don't do that never see don't do this and don't do that and you're not teaching them you are correct if you don't teach them the word they will come to love the world why because that world nature is in them it's already in them hallelujah [Music] amen hallelujah you know there's a time you have anton brother branham he looked at his natural parents as being his parents but one day he said i'm no longer the the children of ella and i can't remember the daddy's name a change had taken place and that's where god is trying to take us it's like a juvenile back to the original father original hallelujah amen is that the truth back to the original fight religion is not going now let me finish let me read this scripture matthew 9 16 no man putteth a piece of new cloth onto an old garment for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and rent is made worse you don't know what i'm saying says and my mama would would put a patch on it back in that day patches were not in style um oftentimes the patch that she would put on that on the pad would never be the same color of the pants a piece of garment a new piece of garment hallelujah you understand me so that's how it is with the message change from the inside out the lantern here alex you're trying to put that new something hello and it makes it worse that's you've got [Music] into all bottles you met down there is that right in other words a lot of them put new wine in old bottles the bottles got a lot of quiet work folks this morning but i'd rather for you to be quiet and thinking about what's being said i wouldn't take it i'm trusting that somehow how could i say it like i'm gonna say it like brother brown said it basically he said christ should be so much in you when people see you jesus [Music] you be wouldn't you rather would wouldn't you rather lose your mind to god you then to lose it to satan samia the pair devoted show say dhoni and sometimes love is correcting therefore but one thing i know about correction don't know that you love them god love foreign right now when god corrects us we don't run this way hallelujah because the same god that corrects you will also comfort you hallelujah amen preparing ourselves preparing ourselves romans 13 10 i know i'm going through a lot of scripture but i want to just make sure you see where i'm going with this i i see so many people say i love god oh i just love him oh yeah and they can out quote me when it comes to brother brown oh yeah and i don't have no [Music] you know in the course of my living i've had two strokes romans 13 gomez starting at the 10th praise this tenth verse roman plays mercedes we really do appreciate our brother john los appreciation i wish i was on that side of the table then this side love worketh no ill to his neighbor neither love therefore love is the fulfillment of the law la multa and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than we believed uh our prophet died at the age of fifty six lot of prophet more a large descendant of my math is correct hey my calculator this year would make uh 56 years since 63 i believe however uh 65 or 60. but anyway i i calculated 56 years and so we're getting ready to embrace another year or so we don't know how short it is [Applause] and this god sent and if we don't see through the eyes of the prophets our times it's like you got the message the message was sent for us benefit from it beneficial [Music] this is what paul says he said the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light you see a lot of time we think that does it a lot of times we think that the uh works of darkness the person can deserve [Music] hello and one of the excuses was uh they had this that's evil and you because [Music] that's not what he's talking about what's in it come back together of gossip did i knock on the door because that's what happens you'd rather go because somebody got a few chickens and beefs and oh yeah [Music] supernatural food i wish i could find out how many people drop dead in a restaurant every year y'all understand what i'm saying because that natural food will not keep i boosted you hallelujah amen is that all right let me move on let us walk earnestly as in the day that's the 13th verse of the thirteenth chapter of romans martial at ma come and bless you as in today not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wanting this not in strife and indian but put ye on the lord jesus christ put him on and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof y'all know what i'm saying let's go people can do that and how many times you and i have done this competition hungry see i took it that way because i know a lot of y'all thinking i'm going to go the other way but no is that right the bible said it is the little foxes the little foxes the spores the vine hallelujah because we've been bought with a price basket i live no longer that lives but christ that lives in me that means our body our minds our soul our being is supposed to the bible said if you would acknowledge the lord see you freaking out or shall direct your past hallelujah amen you love the lord [Music] we know that if you miss the rapture that's horrific it's no secret and because we all have come out because we've all come out of denominations it's not good enough it's a system coming out is not good enough the most important part is going into say going into andre millions came out of egypt the we can't take it for granted because jesus christ is the same person yesterday today and forever he can't change for you you must change for him you name me one church from that's adam leaving the word for the church we've had the seven church ages is [Music] even tell them who to marry i tell poe don't tell me that's not true that's true they did that in the apostolic church the church they wanted to marry somebody else i did not marry who they wanted me to manage that personality [Music] the and you have a section for the preachers who are all kinds of women now when i was in there because i knew i was cooking something better i'll take your passage more than hamburgers [Laughter] but it's not right it's not right people see a pacquiao that's a spirit sustainable and it puts preachers in positions if they would fall it would be like a bowling ball the rolling ball hitting the pins [Music] and striking you understand killing a lot of people in their spirits that's the setup of the devil that high art the heart is not of god respect the preacher respected [Music] what would be the punishment of the harlot and her children what would be the punishment of the harlot and her children the prostitute well it is going to be twofold first he said i will cast her into a bed la premiere according to the last part of verse 22. it will be a bed of tribulations that's exactly what jesus said in matthew 25 say exactly one through thirteen oh and just they there were ten virgins you have a dvms five were wise and five were foolish they sank at the phone the five wives had oil the holy ghost you said this all the holy spirit but the other five men did not none of it and when the cry went up they got yeah behold the bridegroom cometh the foolish had to run while the wise virgins went into the marriage [Music] amen oh glory to god right uh uh when the uh the the foolish had to run seeking all while the wise virgins [Music] don't live more that is that is what will come upon the holocaust secondly secondly it says that he will kill them with death or as literally translated says let them be put to death with death or by in you resist in 1964 he says in the face of all this doubt god does go right on may continue proving his words to be right i don't care how much the world unbelieves still going to happen unbelief doesn't do nothing but condemn the unbelievers uh amen but in the bible in in the new testament the bible said god strengthened her hallelujah in other words he took away the umbilicus to change the more you hear to the world [Music] amen amen those that are asleep right either way god going to bring it to pass which i don't have the faith yet books we ask what god the key to her response is the things that produce jesus is you hallelujah be it unto me to your word unto me can y'all say that and god is working on our behalf right now i don't believe you to glory [Music] [Applause] i believe this is the translation there is no way you can miss it huh one thing i love about that ranch's story uh uh the ranch is the story of the rancher's [Music] [Music] he said once there anybody that does our prayer we're willing to pray for you like i said i know we have baptisms it was really raining down coming down it was raining [Music] and uh i thought well this will be the first time i baptized in the rain we don't want to let rain stop us [Music] [Music] those who have been fallen come back to the lord [Music] you know when the prophet god says when the evening shadows fall they they will return i'm not here to judge who is and who is not yourself [Music] she desired a closer walk with you and she also desired that you would fill her with your holy ghost lord you said if we ask for bread you would not give us a serpent so father i just pray for my daughter that you would give a grace to receive your holy spirit father we know lord god that when the holy spirit comes it brings a change it's not something that we must do but it's something that he does thank you lord jesus and right
