Victory to glory to God Amen Hallelujah Glory am amen glory to amen glory [Music] so happy I'm so happy to be here this morning you may be seated just for a [Music] moment yesterday we had a meeting with the church for those of you who could not make it uh we we left out in peace we left out in peace and uh understanding always remember that the enemy is not flesh and blood but his spiritual wickedness in high places amen amen and we're so grateful Amen to to understand that God always gives his people the victory the last hour was here we spoke pretty rough and some of the things that I said was not really um expedient it should have been done or said at a different time was aware that we had I wasn't aware that we had visitors if there be any visitors here to today I want to apologize one of the statements I do want to apologize for the statement that I made that the church here has a bad reputation that should have been explained but I did not explain it uh so I want to apologize for [Music] that and for anybody that I um caused to stumble my apology to you as well I was going under the inspiration of what I was told and I did blame the church what the transaction that had had taken place and then now I realize it wasn't the church it was other things that caused a problem I'm not going to go into detail y'all know what I mean but I want to say by the grace of God without battles there is no Victory there is not one church that I know of that that doesn't undergo battles and I I want to say this to clarify something else we wanted to have another meeting here a meeting that Saturday but that was my choice and even though the deacons said that they couldn't make it I I could have pushed that on but to be honest with you I didn't want to have a meeting without them being here and that was the reason why we did not have an that meeting immediately I praise the Lord for that because it gave me time to think it gave me time to to to think about all of the things that have been taking place things that I had said and the things that I meant to say those things that I did not mean to say but I want to say to the church as your Pastor I pray that you forgive me for anything that I may have said or done that threw you off my intention is to see this church grow but I need to see you grow spiritually more than naturally and in order for us to grow we have to be faithful in the things in which God has called called us to be faithful in none of us can pay for the goodness of God and all of us can agree God is good all of us can agree that God is good and as I said before I really believe that you are the gold that God sent to this country but even so gold must be purged it has to be cleansed and you're going to you must have the will for God to clean you he's not going to force anything on you but in this journey as a preacher whether it's me or someone else the house of God is the house of correction and we must understand that though you may have a pastor or preacher up here we are human make mistakes sometime we get in our human element is that right well let me ask you do you all get in your human element sometimes aren't we glad that it's all about Grace I want to say one more thing and I'm going go get into the message I'm not weak yet I'm weak I'm weak in myself but I'm strong in him you understand me our our desire is to make a Rapture and this is not a time to play with that it is so simple that most people bypass the reality on how close and how simple it is to make a rapture I thank God it is not based upon my works or your works it is the grace of God now let us stand one thing I said in the meeting yesterday that is we must learn how to love one another and and the Lord it showed me about true love I'm not talking about the affili love I'm talking about the real love that's will will will will lay down their lives or its life real love will lay its life down for those who even hate you is that the truth Jesus did it he said father forgive them for they know not what they do Steven did it while being stoned he said Lord hold not these things to their charge not only did he love those people but he he he forgave them as they stoned him to death now this seems this kind of love seems so far away but it's not the scripture says it's not the even in your mouth as we stand I'm glad to have my wife with me and she's looking really lovely today amen that's one of the gifts that were given to her for her birthday ion call amen she's really proud of the that dress and the other one as well so we we thank God for his grace Proverbs 3 another thing I'll say yes they did a transformation yeah in my heart and my wife's heart sorry I just get emotional I left out the meeting last night feeling like family y'all understand me the discussions that we had the openness that we had made me come to know you better and I really felt connected and we thank you we thank you Proverbs 3 5-6 and then we'll go to Deuteronomy 2327 and it reads Proverbs 3 begin beginning at the fifth verse it said trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path Deuteronomy 33 27 Vin it reads the Eternal God Is Thy refuge and underneath are the Everlasting Arms and he shall Thrust out the enemy from before thee and shall say destroy them let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your goodness we thank you for being so good to us Lord Lord in all of our airing ways you love us still What a Mighty God you are no words can express our gratitude and father we love you because of who you are bless this service bless those who uh have been confused and troubled we pray Lord God you being the Prince of Peace may bring peace to their hearts this morning Father we thank you for your goodness in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you may be seated I am going to try to go as slowly as I possibly can this morning because I want you to see something and Revelation is not something that you as a individual you can re many many of times we as preachers we we try to reveal something to you but only Jesus Christ can reveal to you where we are in this day at this time my subject this morning is the eternal weapon tree the Eternal weapon tree if I had a subject or subtopic it would be the steadfast love of God steadfast love of God unchanging love of God when we talk talk about Weaponry there's a difference between weaponry and weapons because a weapon can be one thing like a gun or knife but Weaponry is a group of weapons like America we have different types of bombs we have bombs that could be launched from a ship we have those that can be launched from a plane we have guns that we call automatics all kinds of things but collectively we have all of these things for our defense very seldom to my knowledge America goes in to conquer a country I'm not saying they don't do it but they don't tell me but as an American we we feel safe because of our weaponry y'all can agree with that and we know that there are enemies out there but because of the Weaponry the enemy will always fear that if they start a war uh they think within themselves will I be able to win the war so many times Wars are having Weaponry a great Weaponry also bring peace because that devil knows that he starts something he won't be the one that finishes it you know you you you see seen that you know in in movies when somebody wants to fight the guy who knows he's he's a weapon he might say are you sure you want to start this because he's confident that what he knows he understands how bad he how badly he can beat his opponent so he he literally give that challenge a moment of Grace and sometimes foolish men go on and take the challenge and once they get into it no doubt they wish they had not I'm dealing with something and I'm trying to build a platform because I want you to understand my weapon Tre your weapon Tre is God y'all understand what I mean with that because we use use the scripture often greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world but my question this morning is what is your greater than what is your greater than or who is your greater than here the scripture according to Deuteronomy said the Eternal God is my refuge and when you think about the Eternal you must understand there's nothing that can defeat him wait a minute y'all see you're not you're not let me go back to Greater is he in you that's the god of your Weaponry that's why the Bible says no weapon formed against you shall prosper come on people I I need you to enter into the thought that I'm trying to bring to you because sometime we forget that we're just a portion of the Mighty God and this God is not selfish he uses us sometimes in war to declare his preeminence over Satan can I say it like this I used this example yesterday God is the creator of Good and Evil and God said be thankful it says in all things give thanks the thing is because when Satan comes we only see the evil and we rarely ever see the good but in every situation there is a positive and a negative God is doing something oh my we we we we we look for an example at at Daniel Daniel living holy Daniel living righteously Daniel praying three times a day and the devil hates it because Daniel is a reflection of the God he served that's why the devil hates you cuz you're living right when you walking right when you talking right here comes [Music] trouble yall understand me but you see we don't see the flip side we go through the suffering for the glory and honor of God right am because God wanted to prove to the king of Babylon that there was somebody greater than the king and the only way he could show that he had to use Daniel as a weapon right and that's what we fail to see light always conquered darkness and and in in in this king's Kingdom there was light and they didn't like it the devil didn't so what he what did he do he FAL accuse Daniel and God says yes you're falling right into my trap Hallelujah now think about it Daniel didn't know what God was doing all Daniel knows that he was being accused and he knew he was right he knew that the enemy was coming against him one thing Daniel knew that the king and all his accusers did not know knew that God the true God was his God see no matter what comes your way recognize the darkness are just demons coming against the light but ye are the lights of the world come on and that devil cannot defeat you look to see what God is doing throw Daniel in the Lion's Den Lions had to obey the Lions had to Bow is that all right when the king came back the next morning he said oh Daniel did your God deliver thee it is the king of Babylon praising God and he didn't even know it hallelujah amen and Daniel replied live long oh King my God is God hallelujah am my God has even made the Lion's mou shut the king pulled Daniel out in in Joy Daniel was a friend but he made a decree that he couldn't turn back look what this man did he said I'm going to put out a law that Daniel God is God Hallelujah see all the Demons of Hell know that your God is God all the demons Hallelujah when Jesus rose from the dead all hell knew from that point on that Jesus Christ is Lord but the believer you must come to a place to recognize the god you serve is God hallelujah and God will put you in situations to awaken you to the revelation of who he is is that right so here now every knee must bow every tongue must confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the father Hallelujah see we look for it to happen here in the future but God is bending needs even today Hallelujah he's humbling the the the enemy even today hallelujah amen don't you ever think that uh Satan can build a wall that you can't penetrate Hallelujah he will make you think that you're trapped and you can't get out Hallelujah but the devil is a liar y'all hear what I'm saying God always have been able to defe Satan because he's the creator of Satan I want to come into this we say in Christ I'm in Christ what does that mean I'm in Christ people say I'm in the anointing what does that mean I'm in the anointing there's a lot of kinds of anointings I need to know which one you're in you understand me so when we say we're in Christ we're saying that we're are we are in love y'all didn't get it but to be in Christ is to be in love so you understand there is no space outside of God God created space god created time he feels everything and there is nothing outside of him everything is within y'all hear what I'm saying I don't care how great the galaxies are God is still the boundaries I guess I say like that because if there's something outside of God when was that created when did that come into existence but God clears it up for us he said if there is another God I know him not now Elohim is except existing one hear what I'm saying and how however God does it we do know one thing that when God created he did a a dimensional thing you understand me we would not have known that had it not been for a prophet to know that the heavens it's not just a a bunch of stars but Heaven is a place it it's another dimension where people live Angels Live God resides but in all of that God can never be bottled up bottled like in a bottle you understand what I'm saying even though Jesus was the fullness of the godhead there still was God because God is a spirit and he put all of his attributes his person into Jesus it wasn't two Gods it was one God clothing himself but he cannot stop being who he is you understand me he still was the self-existing one but now he's Jesus Christ Paul described it like this I believe it was Paul he said he's above all in all he's through all you understand so you understand not even a spider could can exist without God even the life of a spider is controlled by [Music] God y'all hear what I'm saying I want to see his greatness is farther or greater than we can comprehend Hallelujah if we can see how great he is we can then see how small our problems [Music] are come on somebody it doesn't even take a man a grown man to kill a spider you can be a child and all you got to do is do a stump yall understand see a lot of time we think that we've got to mature up to this great [Music] place but even a young child knows he had the authority the ability and the faith to kill a spider you get what I'm saying now we are maturing we're moving in to the the perfect statue of Christ all of his attributes is now being poured into man and the same God that dwell in Jesus dwells in US you understand me so let me let me say this quickly the problem with Christians is that they don't know that they're free yeah we're so busy trying to perfect ourselves when God has already done it we're so busy trying to help him when he doesn't even need your help he made a promise he that begun the good work in you it's faithful to complete it we hear the message of the hour that we were with him before the foundation of the world then Jesus as a man comes to say I never lost one so we don't worry about the journey we don't worry about the journey the journey must go through but Jesus didn't say I'm the journey he said I'm alpha and omega beginning and the ending hallelujah hallelujah and what we must realize or accept is the end of our faith and the end of our faith declare us as being perfect you understand where I'm going with now a quote coming from demonology paragraph 15 see I'm riding high right I make my mistakes but I get right back up you understand I'm an eagle you are Eagle ah come on somebody you you you know sometime that the storm that wind may bring you down a little bit but all you got to do is check your wings check your wings check your wings Hallelujah amen as they say you've been born to [Music] fly hallelujah hallelujah see and I'm going to say this before I read this quote what you see before you is not real in the eyes of Faith y'all hear what I'm saying because your your natural eyes has the ability to lie Hallelujah but your spiritual eyes look beyond what your natural eyes are declaring is that right even Abraham called those things that be not they were we have the ability look into the Future come on somebody it's the truth Hallelujah am brother Bram even said it he said if you're sick and if you can see yourself perfect he said you confess it keep confessing it keep confessing keep confessing it and that Vision will become reality Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying this is our weapon tree Hallelujah Heaven came down and Glory fill my soul understand me and who is this Glory Jesus Christ himself hallelujah amen he says in this quote now it's just like I think the gifts of the Spirit The Gift of the spirit is not the Holy Ghost it's the attributes of the Holy Ghost Gifts of healing speaking in tongues and all those other things are attributes it's a fruit that the trees bear see the tree the main thing the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is God and God is love and that that's another little area I can go in well John says it we have no need to teach you how to love because God is love now I'm going to say that too because a lot of us still don't know what love is and love is the mystery of this message it is the mystery of this age because in this age only a few people have met love I'm not talking about your affili your love you love somebody today and then you you don't have an attitude with them tomorrow I'm talking about a love that's unfailing it's something that God gives you and once he gives it you know you got it hallelujah amen how can I say it you can't even help yourself because love controls you love doesn't mean being mushy love is corrected love doesn't fear anything cuz this love is God I'm excited this morning because I know my Weaponry I realized that every situation God has something to defeat the Devil with Hallelujah absolutely can I say it like this all I got to do is get down on my knees and call 911 Hallelujah maybe I can't get on my knees but the Bible said if I Call On Jesus is that right he will answer prayer prayer is a weapon the word is a weapon Hallelujah and praise is a weapon y'all believe Acts 17:28 we're more than just men we're we're more than just being human we're more than just being an animal somebody help me here we we We Came From Another Dimension Hallelujah and we're kind of Trapped in this one but understand there are doors that can be open doors that faith can unlock Hallelujah and make the thing that we cannot see in this world come to pass Hallelujah when the Bible tells us that in the last days that men were not only control the elements of the Earth but he will also control the Demons of hell is that right that's why Jesus conquered he conquered politics he conquered religion he conquered death hell in the grave and when he con all of this he came back on the day of Pentecost and gave us the authority that he had received so that you can conquer death is upset with you because he realized he's a slave to the believer that's what he is brother bam said he's just a a a horse with a carriage when we die death can only just pull us into the presence of God yall y'all hear what I'm saying so when you die all you got to say get up y'all didn't get it some of y'all still afraid of death death can't hurt you brother Bram got up in that other Dimension and he said is this what I've been afraid of Mercy Lord acts 17 I better go keep on cuz I get carried away this morning act 1728 the Bible says for in him we live and move and have our being brother B said it he said God see every move you make the clothes you wear the thoughts that you having right now is being played before God what we fail to see is that Jesus is here now that's been a revelation to me recently God has revealed to me that Jesus is always with me [Music] and in knowing that I'm learning how to behave myself in the presence of Jesus you see it's only when you forget he's with you is when you allow your mind to think things that it shouldn't think it's only when you forget he's with you you behave yourselves unseemingly but when know he's there it puts you in a different frame of mind Hallelujah when your lord is in in your presence oh you just want to Bow you want to worship you want to make sure that everything that you're doing he's being pleased with it Hallelujah remember in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own prophets have said we are also his do y'all understand that now we are his offspring how does his offspring act Jesus The Offspring of God what did he do what made him different one thing about Jesus he only cared about the father's will Hallelujah he never complained God I don't even have a house to live I don't even have a donkey of my own he was the poorest King that ever lived Hallelujah he loved the ungodly Hallelujah he loved the sinner everything he did was trying to convert those that would hear his voice Hallelujah his whole being every day was father what would you have me to do that was his thinking and it comes down to say I can do nothing except the father show me we look at Jesus as being that way but if you're the God wants the same control is that all right see Abraham's faith is Supernatural and I told you I was going to go slow so I hope this is not getting to you I hope I'm not going too slow Romans 4 16-1 17 you love the Lord I want you to understand that you you're [Music] Invincible you you you know like myself I'm growing old in the natural but inside I could never grow old yall understand me I may feel a a a little bit of pain here and a little bit of pain there but the real me the real you is eternal Hallelujah you understand what I'm saying the word of God can never be defeated and you are the word so you understand you did not do this you don't even deserve you don't even deserve he did this many of us would have given up a long time ago like brother said many people say oh I'm just holding on we we're not holding on he's holding on to us yall know it's the truth many of us Feel So Unworthy Lord I don't even I don't even deserve this God has a string attached to your heart and he said maybe you feel like that but in my grace I made you and he's constantly pulling us come on now come on y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but I'm going to tell you something I'm preaching from experience right now I know what God has done for me hallelujah amen yes sir Romans 4:16 therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed you have faith in God's grace you've made it already the older you get the longer you walk as a Christian you going to find out that all I thought I was doing to help has amounted to nothing it's all by the grace of God y hear what I'm saying it's all by the grace of God Paul said it's got to be that way it must be that way because otherwise some of us would have a reason to boast I did this I did that you didn't do nothing everything every good thing you've ever done has been caused by God's grace Hallelujah am glory to God not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of faith of the faith of Abraham that's still in the 16 who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he he believed even God who Quicken the dead and call it those things which be not they were so you understand you can't even have the proper Faith until God quickens it y'all know what I'm talking about there have been times you may have been sick I'm heal and you heal and you know the word you know the word and there have been other times he didn't Quicken it Hallelujah am and you had to take some a leave some medication y he still did the healing Hallelujah but one was by faith and then the other one God use science but it's still God that healed you Hallelujah is that right there were times God spoke to someone and they received their healing and then there were others he said go wash in the foolish salom Hallelujah see so he uses both methods but we must always remember is still God hallelujah amen I'm going jump a little bit to a quote here just a moment here see in the message you don't heard this quot quote before faith is the substance 1947 uh 412 brother B says here in my pocket I think there's an old B knife I've carried for years now I do not see that knife I do not feel that knife I do not taste that knife I do not smell that knife but I know that that knife is there how do you know because I believe it's in there now if it is not in there faith will put it in there if it's not there he said now that chokes you I know but that's true if you believe all things are possible you afraid to take God friends you're scared now I I might have left that knife laying on the dresser where I changed clothes a while ago but just as sure if that knife is on the dresser right now if I believe it will all with all my heart it'll be in my pocket see I just I just lost some of y'all you're trying to comprehend it by Faith by your by your your brain I'm telling you What Faith Can Do you understand because faith is God by faith God so you got to understand faith and God you can't separate it's like faith and love they're related they're related they they're together oh somebody help me here you said what do you mean brother Brook I was just looking for my debit card uh last week I looked everywhere even in my car turned the P papers over looked and looked and looked it wasn't there then that morning I woke up and and something said look on look look I pull the arm up and there was setting on the top some of y'all know what I'm talking about my wallet my wallet I didn't know where I had placed it and I'm asking everybody did and I just come I just come into the house and I said I don't know where my wallet is and all of a sudden it appears on the table I know y'all think I'm crazy you probably say you put it there and you forgot but I know better I know better I'm just telling you it works even at time when you don't ask God to do it he'll do it you got to realize we're not of this Kingdom we are not of this world we are supernatural beings come on somebody we live by the supernatural Hallelujah I believe that I believe that Hallelujah huj is that right we are engaged engaged by his love see God protects us folks even when we didn't know him he protected us anybody know what I'm talking about when I was a sinner I can look back and say that was nothing but God that's the only way I could have escaped even when I didn't know him he knew me hallelujah amen yes sir am am St John 3 and John say oh I didn't know it so late St John 3 just give me a little bit more and I I'll let you go for God so loved the world that gave His only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life do you know a Christian can believe in God and still struggle with living right Hallelujah but he didn't say if you live right he said believeth in him you should not perish but have everlasting life see because you understand God paid your debt he paid it all I'm trying to liberate you this morning if you can see how free you are devil will be afraid to attack you because he knows your Weaponry for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved God didn't come to condemn you he came to save you he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already already Hallelujah because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God hallelujah and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil Hallelujah listen one more quote maybe two I'm I'mma end on a quote so you you it's okay yeah you know it's better than last week isn't it Hallelujah this is the confession of brother Bram he said don't look to see a minister a pastor he said look to see Jesus if a person was looking to me as an example he said don't you never do that I got too many wrong things in my life you look to the real example Jesus Christ if I could help you I would do it I'm just your brother but he is your lord Look to Him and believe Hallelujah you only see him him as you look at him through the word because he is the word Look to Him with simple humble loving faith and say God cleanse me all my selfishness and take all impurities from me and let me from this day be holy thine he says see what God will do for you hallelujah amen listen in Jehovah JRA 17 he said no matter if a person was looking to me as an example don't you never do that I got too many wrong things in my life you look to the Eternal to the real example Jesus Christ Hallelujah he was the example don't look to one another look to him see he is the one to look to Hallelujah you you love the Lord leaving with this one I should have been read the law having a shadow the law having a shadow is the message 1956 621 here he says and I'm closing on this one he said no man come to me except my father draws him and God seeks man and not man seeking God so you don't have one thing to say but God God it was your grace that did it and then as long as you accept it in the belov how can God bring you into judgment when he's already judged Christ in your stad how could you have to suffer for your sins when Christ is already done it God will be a two Tim and an awful person he said that's right you re why I'm saying that because a lot of Christians people in this church here you done a lot of wrong things and you can't get over it and you suffer at times and the devil tell you a lie that you suffering for what you did the devil is he whom the son is set free is free indeed the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Hallelujah you must break through all of that nonsense that the devil is telling you to keep you down in your spirit hujjah Hallelujah let me read on I'm almost done when it was thoroughly paid by Jesus Christ and you accepted it and as long as God accepted Christ he accepted you with Christ and when he did do it before the foundation of the world and when he spoke him into existence he spoke you redeemed with him Hallelujah and your names was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and then you're scared oh if I could just keep holding on I quit that long time ago I never even tried it in the first place I just turn loose and let him do the whole thing someone said when I was sick that time when I got over it said brother BR did you keep your religion doing your sick spell he said I said no sir it kept me see that's the difference and that's what happened Hallelujah I'm not holding on Hallelujah he's holding on to me Hallelujah perfect faith and this is it for real paragraph 1323 notice now another perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it hallelujah hallelujah you know it's not oh Lord I'm hoping it's going to happen I believe I may not know where but I know it will and as far as I am concerned it's already done hallelujah right it Masters it now just watch when you believe in anything do anything and You' got to have you you and you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances is that have that have one thing thing to do with it excuse me that don't have one thing to do with it it Masters that circumstance Hallelujah a room of sickness and the Lord revealed that this certain thing going to happen what he said you must speak to it oh does oh just don't ask any questions it's already over just keep going it Masters all circumstances if you do this so and so going to do that you see it's already got its Master Faith believe that God will work it out I don't know what I don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyway it Masters all circumstances and faith and love is relative relation because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith is in a God who is very essence Who is the very essence of love Faith and love works together I'm closing right there hallelujah amen and that's what you used to you need to say I don't know how you're going to do it Lord but I love you and because I love you I trust you I don't know how long it's going to take but you said if I ask in your name anything and believe that I would receive it it's mine Hallelujah and I'm waiting on you Lord I'm
