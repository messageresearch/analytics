[3:18] no default:return a Dalai Lama who is
[3:21] colossal Kumasi and we go we found that
[3:25] God one day though making make our head
[3:28] like a covenant with Abraham not revoke

[4:01] Mary Coughlin of grace with Abraham at
[4:03] that time see geography Allianz de la
[4:06] casa mocoso Hebron that if you people if
[4:10] you see do the same thing or we respect
[4:13] this covenant in Leviticus it on purpose
[4:16] respect Allah shows whichever you know I
[4:19] will keep my word
[4:20] Jamie parole so what happened years went
[4:24] by he let a vehicle is an a a pass a you
[4:28] know it happened you know generations
[4:29] after generations hello you know either
[4:33] came is a Coveney
[4:35] Jacob came jacoba Vinny and Jacob heads
[4:38] owns a jicama Veda fish you know and
[4:40] then you know the story out the tune of
[4:42] Israel went to Egypt who can sell Kemal
[4:45] is to accommodate a fidelity battleships
[4:47] so we see that you know all from Abraham
[4:50] or I mean form even Adam to Moses grace
[4:54] both there is the Bahamas Eskimo is like
[4:58] Gracia to Zola you know everything that
[5:00] God was doing was under grace so second
[5:02] Rufus's it
[5:03] - like us you know and then it happened
[5:05] when Moses came a little Viacom owns
[5:08] Avenue the guy was going to set the chin
[5:10] of Israel 3G a lady behind his on phone
[5:13] Israel he God show them grace in a
[5:17] alarum mantra like respondent his
[5:19] attorney ship you know with everything
[5:21] that he did you know miracle I'll make
[5:23] more secular fake on me huh Kadima to
[5:24] and judgment madhavan foul you know
[5:28] everything was on the gray two seconds
[5:30] you have a faceted slide when the chin
[5:32] of Israel went out of each call is
[5:33] inferred isolated sorted a zero in the
[5:36] in the desert and our leaders L so now
[5:38] they began to complain against Hamas in
[5:41] some commas as a plan you know now they
[5:43] began to complain why are we in this
[5:45] situation upon quiet we need to be in
[5:49] the situation where everything was
[5:51] freely given unto the inflated engine
[5:53] condition and situation who to chose
[5:55] Lahontan e you know they wanted to be in
[5:58] the situation where as you know other
[6:00] people was if you lay a total of
[6:02] condition all and so treaty OC but they
[6:05] forgot that they were the children of
[6:07] the promise
[6:08] listen fun lapa so if you do that if you
[6:11] study the Bible you will know these
[6:13] people in Exodus 19 that's worth Loki
[6:17] was a Larry Mark a kid I exert this
[6:19] never say like Illinois V you know cause
[6:21] we cannot talk about Greece without
[6:22] talking about the loan properly the like
[6:25] water pollution there are those two
[6:27] things that goes together shows much on
[6:30] something the Bible says that the law
[6:31] was a foreshadow of Christ or a
[6:34] scalability Killaloe I tell no more than
[6:37] a glass dishes you right and then we see
[6:39] that the you know they did now the God
[6:42] or the chin of Israel refused rejected
[6:45] grace no vehicle is often Israel average
[6:47] it Allah grass they wanted the law
[6:49] evenly avoir la loire you know they tell
[6:51] Moses you know why are we suffering like
[6:54] this is only a more useful cuando su
[6:56] function so we have to be as the Audrey
[6:58] as the other nation knew they were at
[6:59] accomplice automation and thank God it
[7:01] happened that God God called Moses to go
[7:04] to mount a little vacay geobella more
[7:06] years old element so now here we are and
[7:09] are now in Exodus 24 a nova CB nada
[7:13] Oh God and if you notice that you okay
[7:15] we can compare exodus 20:4 to Acts
[7:18] chapter 2 navazio compare excellent God
[7:21] acted accessibility so here we see the
[7:25] parallelism of grace and no et voila
[7:28] parallelism a delicacy in a way in the
[7:32] Old Testament in Exodus was low
[7:34] demacia testimo settle Allah and add to
[7:39] in the New Testament was great he acted

[8:12] pillow fire came and gained covered
[8:14] Moses and brought him up la Villa
[8:16] tequila colada fitness and you have a
[8:18] quiver more easy so now if you know this
[8:21] the Bible says that Moses spent 40 days
[8:23] in the Mount Ephraim about Caleb it
[8:26] became ERISA Paseka hodges's about that
[8:29] starting of him you know how he will

[8:55] inoculate about a second stream so and
[8:57] then God also give him the great Ten
[9:00] Commandment ocj a vacant ad common
[9:03] master later you know he wrote it on the
[9:05] other on the on the on the stone in a
[9:07] vaguely celestial a tab will appear and
[9:09] then it is at the last day at the 40th
[9:11] day or Daniel or kihachi I'm sure when
[9:14] God ended up talking with Moses
[9:16] Santorini because I mean you know it
[9:19] happened that way down in the desert

[9:35] Institute and then they began to worship
[9:37] Him

[9:45] know I stopped the conversation well
[9:48] that guy was having with Moses a second
[9:51] salary offical our conversation
[9:53] anti-jewish personality you know got on
[9:56] Moses now look at what your people are

[10:24] left more deliver so now we happen if we
[10:27] go back at chapter to a stimulus on the
[10:31] except it reduce will see that the the
[10:33] at chapter 2 we see that Jesus after
[10:36] after after the resurrection work and
[10:39] Jessica suppressor resurrection you know
[10:41] was with the disciple for 40 days in
[10:43] italics ABC plop on danke Hans you back
