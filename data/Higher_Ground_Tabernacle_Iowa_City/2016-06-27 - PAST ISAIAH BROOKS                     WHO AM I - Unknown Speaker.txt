this morning that God was able to look beyond all of our faults we appreciate the Lord Jesus Hallelujah everything he is doing for us just now not prolonging the time let us stand we'll go right into the word of godate the musicians we're going to read from Exodus the 3r chapter and we'll read the 11th verse then we'll read a quote coming from the breach of the seven Church ages everybody has it and Moses said unto God who am I 3 chapter 11th verse who am I that I should go unto pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt I'll read that again Exodus 311 and Moses and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go unto pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of of Egypt amen let us pray father God we come before you and we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we thank you for being so good to us Lord there are many of us who are tired but I trust that somehow you would touch their bodies restore them refresh them this morning I pray that you would Kindle Fire in their soul they would press toward the mark of a high calling in Christ and Lord we thank you for giving us this day clothed in and in our right mind we are clothed and in our right mind and we thank you this morning have th own way Lord we pray in Jesus Christ name amen amen you may be seated just going to read this quote coming from uh the bridge paragraph 156 and he saw one sitting upon the throne with this book in his right hand in his right hand think of it now and then in the book was a title deed to Redemption and it was sealed with Seven Seals and then the angel came forth a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book to take the book who was able to open the seat who was able to open this book see the angel asked John saw it and he said now who is worthy let him oh my maybe I just feeling this dis away but let him say but let him said the angel see here is the book of redemption here's the Plan of Redemption here's the only way you'll ever be redeemed for there is the title deed to Redemption of the whole Heaven and Earth let him come forth if he will oh my now speak forever holy spe let him come forth and claim the book who is worthy to do it Hallelujah well you and I really know what's going on by the grace of God this message did not come just to educate us or to make us uh have a greater knowledge but the message came to transform us is that okay it came to uh uh clear our minds of all the worldly things is that okay it came to bring us into into the very image and likeness of God first of all it came to identify us hallelujah amen I I thought and I chose Exodus the 11th chapter to begin the message with to begin my message [Music] with so that you would understand in order to know who you are you must do as Moses did you must confront God himself and when God begin to tell Moses about all the things that he wanted him to do no doubt it was no different from what his mother had told him is that okay but for some reason Moses had to question his [Music] idty because he had tried so many [Music] times to do things right this one time he really tried to make Israel know who he was he killed an Egyptian and he still was rejected Hallelujah but then God drove him to the back side of the desert Hallelujah where he had dwelt for 40 years but one day Moses saw a burning bush and he turned to see why the bush burned Hallelujah and as he approached as he approached the the bush God spoke out of the bush I am the father of Abraham Isaac and Jacob Hallelujah in other words I am the god of the living Hallelujah I am the god of the presence Hallelujah I'm not a yesterday God I am Hallelujah and we find out when God began to address Moses like he is you today Moses asked the question who am I Hallelujah see when you ask God who you are it is being God's responsibility to tell you who you are oh come on somebody because you and I have been called to a mighty work yall hear what I'm say You must understand and the work you must do it's greater than the work of Ephesus it's greater than the work of Smur it's great than the work of pramas Hallelujah they did great works Hallelujah they canot be complete without us you and I must understand you and I must understand we have a responsibility and our responsibility is greater than any huah because if we don't do what we are determined to do there will not be a resurrection amen see that's why we can't be lazy about this thing we must be Z toward God to see what God would have for us to do anybody hear me this morning you and I have a great responsibility that responsibility resp is to come into perfection y hear what I'm saying it's not enough to have it in your mind but it must be something in your who am I and that is that ought to be something that you would ask God we might see who someone else is or who they may are not afraid of death you can defeat cancer you can defeat cancer you can defeat HIV deat that AFF the body and the Soul Hallelujah because it is death the Mind Hallelujah amen if the doctor say you going to die you are to ask him did God tell you that Hallelujah if my God didn't tell me that I'm going to die Hallelujah is that right it is a known fact according to brother Bram that Christians live longer long if they have a terminal [Music] disease if they have a disease that will that will terminate [Music] Hallelujah because they don't worry Hallelujah put before the devil he defeated Hallelujah my God your God say you say to a mountain he th remove that that mountain must obey you Hallelujah I'm crazy enough to believe it that the word hallu let me read Ephesians here just a moment coming from the first chapter getting at the 17th verse is this okay that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him that your eyes of understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saint and that's what this message came to do it came to Enlighten us it came to give us understanding it came to wash away all of the Amnesia Hallelujah and this is what I want the message to do it to bring me into a place that I and my father are one is that is that okay Jesus in the 17th chapter of John prayed he said father I would they be one even as We Are One hallelujah amen do you think Christ prayer could ever [Music] F the word of God is gone out and it can't come back for and now that we are living in that age of Oneness is that right that age of Oneness therefore it doesn't matter where you were born who your natural parents if you are elected of God chosen by God to be the one who is supposed to be one With God all hell cannot prevail because it's not us he that the good work in [Music] us that's the way I pray I say God you promise Hallelujah you promise to complete the work expectation of you the word I wait right here till you complete the word eyes of understanding being enlightened that that he may know what is the hope of his import what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us hallelujah you understand that this is Elohim we [Music] working the very self existing God there is nothing above him there's nothing below him there's nothing on the side of him the Bible say he FS all space he is all and all hallelu amen and to know and to know that we are a part of his being we are a part of his being we are of his I must say it again I'm not working with your mind if I can get it into your heart we are part of his brother talks about Evolution and God evoluted everything EV not like science like we came from some tle but God evoluted us he spoke the word and the serpent was created Hallelujah and the highest things from the man from the serpent excuse me from the serpent came the man Hallelujah he spoke the man and the man was in the very image and Light Of God he was Spirit man Hallelujah brother R said it like this he said while Adam was a spirit man he led the animals he was the inspiration to those animals hallelu then God formed him out of the Dust of the [Music] earth Hallelujah so he can feel his creation so he can touch his creation so he with his creation you and I must understand that God did not roll dice he did not gamble to choose [Music] us like this he had no other choice Hallelujah have a choice with his child God has no choice hall because [Music] we the Bible says as the Earthly brought forth the Earthly so will the spirit bring forth the spirit is that okay you had no choice on your appearance on what you look like whether you like it or not you had no choice that's right it was pre-planned by God is that all right and everything God all about you was good amen hallelujah it was really when God created man he didn't say just good you were above good he said when it came to he said very good he said very good now God is doing a greater thing this what God is bringing us into is higher is a higher [Music] order was second quicking Spirit he this thing is greater you and I can imagine say like this that little cillar in him is to become a butterfly look at the difference in the appearance when that little caterpillar is crawling around on the ground all he knows is there is something in him that driving him to eat to eat all of a sudden he is inspired Amen to go and attach himself to a tree you better attach yourself to the Tree of Life let the spirit of God wrap you up you up into the C of the word hallelujah that all right prop God said we must go behind Hall our in Hallelujah we must go behind the and shut ourselves in you say why because it is behind the veil you can truly see your identity yall hear what I'm saying am before the rod was placed behind the veil before Aaron's Rod was placed behind the ve I uh it was [Music] first Abraham how you want to put it before the rod before the rod was plac behind the veil H H nobody knew what stick that was where the rod came from what tree it was broken from Hallelujah nobody knew but once it was behind the ve bring forth blossoms of peaches it did not bring for blossoms of apples but it blo the blossoms of almond tree [Music] amen hear what I'm saying it was there were able to know the came from an almond tree and as it remain it began to bring for to bring for fruit in other words the thing that was is bringing forth it is bringing forth armor it brought forth the original fruits of the Tre it came when we get behind the ve shows us who we are amen that's what this message does it'll bring a dead tree to life where was the power Hall oh where was the power it wasn't just in the outer Court it wasn't just in the inner court but the supernatural power the supernatural power of the Resurrection behind [Music] behind one time to try to go behind the but now those angels are driving [Applause] us [Music] and he said when you get behind the veil you stay back there you don't come out you stay is that okay who am I and this is what you must ask yourself so that God can respond Hallelujah I'm not saying who I used to be I say who I am now listen wanted us to know what is the exceedingly greatness of his power to us who believe according to the working of his mighty power right according to his mighty power not my power not by your power it's not by power not by but by my now say something to you we're too Earth bound we're too Earth you've heard me say this time before we think too much like men and the
