[53:29] john saint john chapter one
[53:35] saint john chapter one uh
[53:38] we read the verse uh verse one
[53:49] amen we read this verse the last son the
[53:52] one we preached here
[53:55] hey man i just want to go with the same
[53:58] thought
[53:59] that we had last sunday
[54:04] i'm going to continue with what we
[54:06] started
[54:17] was the word and the word was with god
[54:21] and the word was god
[54:28] the word
[54:29] in the beginning was the word and the
[54:31] word was with god and the word was gone
[54:49] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[54:52] among us
[54:57] and we beheld this glory the glory of
[55:00] of
[55:01] and we beheld this glory the glory as of
[55:03] the only begotten of the father full of
[55:05] grace and truth
[55:13] amen that same word that was in the
[55:15] beginning
[55:17] you meant that word was made flesh
[55:20] and that would dwell to mourn us
[55:24] let's turn to first timothy verse uh
[55:27] chapter three you read the verse 16.
[55:32] first timothy chapter three
[55:34] and timothy
[55:36] we read the verse 16. verse he says
[55:39] when the bible says that and without
[55:40] controversy great is the mystery of
[55:43] godliness
[55:44] god was manifest in the flesh justified
[55:47] the spirit seen of angels preached onto
[55:50] the gentiles believed believed on in the
[55:53] world
[55:54] received up into glory
[55:57] [Music]
[56:08] i'll read it again and without
[56:10] controversy great is the mystery of
[56:12] godliness god was manifest in the flesh
[56:19] manifestation
[56:21] here you'll notice that the bible says
[56:22] that god was manifest in the flesh the
[56:24] bible used the word manifest
[56:28] it
[56:30] amen which means that it's the same god
[56:32] who was in the spirit but now he's
[56:34] became a flesh salad remember get on the
[56:36] screen
[56:38] amen justifying the spirit seen of
[56:41] angels preached unto the gentiles
[56:44] believed only in the world received up
[56:46] in the glory
[56:55] father we just read your word
[56:59] we pray father god that you come and you
[57:01] open these books to us lord jesus
[57:06] lord open our understanding
[57:10] and speak to us this morning
[57:13] in jesus christ let me pray amen
[57:17] amen you may be seated
[57:19] amen i have uh we have a little subject
[57:22] this morning that we wanted to share
[57:24] with you
[57:32] [Music]
[57:38] uh preached last sunday
[57:42] we preached about we shall be changed
[57:46] amen talking about the change that was
[57:48] supposed to come the change that is
[57:50] coming
[57:55] [Music]
[58:20] thought that he became son just i'm
[58:22] still talking about the change
[58:29] because we'll know that god as a spirit
[58:31] god couldn't die that's a spirit
[58:34] in the spirit
[58:48] he wanted to die for us
[58:51] so he had to come down to live with us
[58:54] and to be like us
[58:58] he had to come down to become one of us
[59:03] in order for him to die on the cross
[59:06] so he had to become a son
[59:10] he had to become soon
[59:12] so he became the son of his own house we
[59:14] lived in history
[59:16] for the redemption
[59:35] you know redemption
[59:37] the kingsman redeemer has to be the
[59:39] closest one to you
[59:44] so that's why you couldn't send an angel
[59:45] to die for you
[59:48] that's why he couldn't send anybody else
[59:51] to die on the cross for him
[59:55] so he had to become a son he david
[59:57] divinely so he who was the father
[1:00:00] amen in order for him to be a father can
[1:00:03] we say
[1:00:04] he meant he had to be a son
[1:00:07] he still has the same god
[1:00:09] women manifested as a son manifested
[1:00:12] come amen it's not talking about three
[1:00:14] different gods
[1:00:16] we're not talking about the trinity that
[1:00:18] the god the father is different than the
[1:00:20] son
[1:00:23] or the son is different from the spirit
[1:01:06] she saw us the bride
[1:01:18] amen in order for him to save us
[1:01:21] hebrews 4 verse 14 to 16 the bible says
[1:01:26] seeing that
[1:01:27] we sing then uh
[1:01:30] we have a great high priest that is
[1:01:32] passed into the heavens
[1:01:34] jesus the son of god let us hold first
[1:01:47] for we have not an high priest which
[1:01:50] cannot be touched with the feelings of
[1:01:52] our infirmities
[1:01:54] but was in no points tempted like as we
[1:01:57] are yet without sin
[1:02:04] offense
[1:02:09] now let us therefore come both
[1:02:12] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:02:15] obtain mercy and find grace to help in
[1:02:18] time of need
[1:03:53] amen that means that his body was
[1:03:55] different than
[1:03:57] his body wouldn't see uh corruption
[1:04:01] the third day god was supposed to raise
[1:04:03] him out of the dead
[1:04:06] it meant behold the virgin shall shall
[1:04:08] be with child
[1:04:11] and he shall bring forth his son
[1:04:14] and they shall call his name
[1:04:18] which being interpreted is god with us
[1:04:23] as a son do you confess
[1:04:39] to us
[1:04:40] amen he had to become a son he defeated
[1:04:42] the vineyard in order for him to do that
[1:04:45] what could the defend even he had to
[1:04:46] become a son
[1:04:48] in order for us to touch him
[1:04:51] and he had to become a son in order for
[1:04:54] us to to sleep with him
[1:04:58] with him
[1:04:59] amen to see him in the human flesh
[1:05:02] amen because the egg that was from the
[1:05:05] end
[1:05:05] that
[1:05:06] jesus uh jesus
[1:05:08] jesus was the high priest
[1:05:11] amen because mary and her eggs were
[1:05:14] corruptable
[1:05:19] amen but jesus wasn't jesus wasn't
[1:05:21] corrupt
[1:05:22] and corrected
[1:05:23] he wanted to be a father
[1:05:26] so he became a son to be a father to be
[1:05:29] his only to be chemist he became a son
[1:05:31] of his own house
[1:05:34] i'll
[1:05:46] now the prophet says that now in this
[1:05:48] the father son and holy ghost
[1:05:53] now after he dwelt in the pill of fire
[1:05:58] then came down and made himself a body
[1:06:01] venus
[1:06:02] brought itself down to a tent of a human
[1:06:05] flesh and dwelt in it
[1:06:08] and dwelting among us
[1:06:10] god dwelling first timothy chapter 3
[1:06:13] verse 16.
[1:06:16] what says that without controversy some
[1:06:18] controversy that was paul speaking
[1:06:21] great is the mystery of godliness
[1:06:27] amen for god was manifest in the flesh
[1:06:29] you see
[1:06:42] creator became our savior
[1:07:03] way above us
[1:07:05] couldn't even get around where he was it
[1:07:08] passes the place then he became son we
[1:07:11] let the benefits that we could touch him
[1:07:14] feel him listen to you he was a man
[1:07:17] and then he gave his life
[1:07:20] that blood cell was broken by crew
[1:07:25] by crew of sin for roman spirit
[1:07:31] when he pierced his heart
[1:07:34] a broken heart killed him
[1:07:40] his water and blood separate sunshine

[1:07:55] water came out of him
[1:07:58] a man to wash you and to make you clean
[1:08:00] who would have been evil under peace he
[1:08:02] meant that's the reason why he had to
[1:08:04] die
[1:08:06] in order for you to be saved okay
[1:08:22] his own house
[1:08:46] and you know this abraham slept like

[1:09:08] that's a more unity perfectly he had to
[1:09:10] suffer the absence of god in in his
[1:09:13] death
[1:09:18] in his death that's a moral that we
[1:09:20] would have the presence of god in our
[1:09:23] death
[1:09:26] see and there god struck upon him our
[1:09:28] judgment
[1:09:47] cross
[1:09:48] even god wasn't there god god had to get
[1:09:51] away from his body when he when he died

[1:10:45] david
[1:10:46] yesterday
[1:10:47] to confess the long face i said that i
[1:10:49] mean the prophet said that he came under
[1:10:51] three sons name
[1:10:53] the prophetic eleven
[1:10:54] one of the first it doesn't mean that he
[1:10:56] will come three times
[1:10:59] amen he used the three names mainly
[1:11:02] remember he can come as multiple times
[1:11:04] as you want
[1:11:06] to please come everywhere amen we know
[1:11:08] that god first came as the son of man
[1:11:12] then he came as the son of god believing
[1:11:14] he commanded you then he will come as
[1:11:16] the son of man again will if you're not
[1:11:18] going to come and feast the lord then it
[1:11:20] will come

[1:11:28] the feast the lord jesus christ
[1:11:30] anointing i said jesus the son of man
[1:11:32] was jesus christ himself
[1:11:35] the lord jesus christ he came as a
[1:11:37] prophet kevin prophet because in ezekiel
[1:11:40] chapter 12 verse 1-6
[1:11:46] amen the bible says that the world of
[1:11:48] the lord also came unto me saying
[1:11:50] ezekiel

[1:12:34] the lord made them perfect
[1:12:42] amen he came as a prophet living in the
[1:12:44] common prophet amen you will see that
[1:12:46] the bible said that when jesus come into

[1:12:52] the philippines philippi asked his
[1:12:54] disciples saying
[1:12:56] that discipline do men say that i the
[1:12:59] son of man amen escalation this is the
[1:13:01] one who defeats the lord amen because
[1:13:03] his first coming was as as the son of
[1:13:05] man
[1:13:08] and jesus didn't call himself a son of
[1:13:11] god
[1:13:13] but he was always referring to himself
[1:13:15] as the son of man remember
[1:13:19] the prophet that moses that moses
[1:13:21] prophesied come the prophet
[1:13:23] that he will raise up it will raise up
[1:13:25] his prophetic unto me

[1:13:34] jesse the son of man ministry that was
[1:13:37] in the dead in jesus name the minister
[1:13:38] of the feast
[1:13:40] revealed thought
[1:13:43] revealed secrets
[1:13:51] amen so now we'll go into it and see how
[1:13:54] you know when jesus was manifesting that
[1:13:56] ministry
[1:14:01] amen amen amen let's go first in luke
[1:14:04] chapter 21 verse 24. i don't think that
[1:14:06] luke uh
[1:14:07] then chapter 21 verse 20. look this
[1:14:09] state of venture
[1:14:19] the bible says that and there shall be
[1:14:22] i'm sorry and there shall fall by the
[1:14:24] edge of the sword
[1:14:26] and shall be led away captive into all
[1:14:28] nations
[1:14:33] yeah 21 24.

[1:14:43] fall by the edge of the sword
[1:14:47] and shall be led away captive into all
[1:14:49] nations
[1:14:52] and jerusalem shall be trotted down
[1:14:55] of the gentiles until the times of the
[1:14:58] gentiles be fulfilled in jerusalem

[1:15:21] i mean jesus looked and looked to her
[1:15:22] and say that i cannot give the bread of
[1:15:25] the children to the dogs

[1:15:40] or the authority to call jesus son of
[1:15:43] david and i passed it copper still has
[1:15:44] that pleasure

[1:17:42] amen you see that jesus the first time
[1:17:44] he saw peter
[1:17:47] he knew peter's name
[1:17:50] and he knew who was the father
[1:17:54] because he was god the prophet
[1:18:08] amen that same sound of man ministry
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:18] amen in luke chapter 20 chapter 17 verse
[1:18:21] 26 to 37.
[1:18:24] verses and as it was in the days of no
[1:18:28] one coming
[1:18:29] away so shall it be also in the days of
[1:18:31] the son of man and see him

[1:19:36] amen to do that to the gentiles the fair
[1:19:39] evacuation team amen he did do that in
[1:19:41] the gentiles first of all so he was a

[1:34:56] so that god can keep us warm as he is
[1:34:58] one with god with the father
[1:35:04] and because he cares for you
[1:35:06] he points to women he cares for you
[1:35:09] amen he does man when you men he's
[1:35:11] that's why he's praying for you
[1:35:14] amen that's why he prayed for us
[1:35:18] in the bible he says

[1:35:22] read it
[1:35:26] amen to show that god cares for us
[1:35:32] pretty sure luke chapter one from that
[1:35:33] misunderstood question
[1:35:39] okay luke chapter one verse
[1:35:43] verse 12 and verse 13.
[1:35:50] and when zechariah saw him he was
[1:35:52] troubled and feared and fear fell upon
[1:35:55] him
[1:36:00] but the angel said unto him fear not me
[1:36:06] for the prayer is
[1:36:09] and that heard
[1:36:10] elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou
[1:36:13] shall call his name
[1:36:18] even fear not for their prayers
[1:36:51] woman because your prayer has been hurt
[1:36:55] amen he became a son
[1:36:58] amen to give you whatever you ask for
[1:37:02] became a son
[1:37:04] woman to be touched by the feeling of
[1:37:06] our infirmities
[1:37:12] on the cross
[1:37:14] amen to save you
[1:37:16] amen and the lord said simon simon
[1:37:19] behold satan has desired to have you
[1:37:22] ellis
[1:37:28] that he may sift you as a wheat a
[1:37:31] vatican
[1:37:34] come to play but i have prayed for it
[1:37:38] that thy faith fail not get up
[1:37:41] and when they were converted
[1:37:44] to strengthen thy brethren i
[1:37:57] he cares about us he pounced on the noon
[1:37:59] amen that's why he died on the cross for
[1:38:01] us
[1:38:03] that's why he became a son
[1:38:06] amen that's why he became a son
[1:38:08] absolutely living a man to die for us
[1:38:12] amen to take our sins with him
[1:38:17] so that we can become holy african
[1:38:20] so that we can become saints i think in
[1:38:23] different onsen amen he was fatherless
[1:38:26] so that we can have a father
[1:38:28] of our emperor
[1:38:36] [Music]
[1:38:43] to who can possibly imagine a man
[1:38:45] showing his love and his grace
[1:38:47] demonstration
[1:38:48] showing his love and his grace
[1:38:51] when he shared his blood practices so
[1:38:54] that you can be saved
[1:38:56] to wash
[1:38:59] amen so it doesn't matter what you did
[1:39:01] before
[1:39:03] you man it doesn't matter how great your
[1:39:05] sins are
[1:39:07] when his blood came to wash you
[1:39:10] from evil
[1:39:11] came to make you to make you free
[1:39:13] society
[1:39:15] amen and then he said will i do that i
[1:39:17] will not rest
[1:39:19] until you are by my side
[1:39:23] i will now rest
[1:39:53] [Music]
[1:40:20] don't complain don't cry
[1:40:22] complaining
[1:40:24] amen but all in all the time
[1:40:26] i don't
[1:40:27] know every circumstances
[1:40:29] you may just praise him just listen in
[1:40:32] every circumstance
[1:40:34] circumstances
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:41:01] he knows exactly what you're going
[1:41:02] through he said exactly
[1:41:04] so just talk to him
[1:41:07] and just talk to him hallelujah
[1:41:09] that's the reason why he became son
[1:41:13] he meant the son of his own house
[1:41:15] there's a problem we meant to give you
[1:41:17] what you want
[1:41:18] to skip this message will give you what
[1:41:20] you need
[1:41:22] then he died we lay more it meant to
[1:41:24] become a son of god
[1:41:26] amen that spirit set the spree that holy
[1:41:29] spirit says
[1:41:43] [Music]
[1:41:56] the son of man could only be with us
[1:42:13] teacher
[1:42:18] that's why sometimes when you do
[1:42:19] something wrong
[1:42:21] they follow
[1:42:22] you there is a spirit that tells you
[1:42:24] that what you did was wrong you have to
[1:42:25] go repent yeah
[1:42:50] amen but one day when you keep on
[1:42:52] shutting that voice off
[1:43:22] to forgive she said
[1:43:25] amen which would always tell you to
[1:43:26] forgive asking
[1:43:28] that's the thing that you're supposed to
[1:43:30] do
[1:43:31] if it tells you to say amen to the world
[1:43:33] that's what you're supposed to do
[1:43:49] amen to save me

[1:44:22] he meant that he left his glory
[1:44:25] he meant to come here on earth
[1:44:29] i meant to die for you
[1:44:31] it meant to be marketed
[1:44:35] beautiful it meant to be laughed the
[1:44:37] people laughed at him
