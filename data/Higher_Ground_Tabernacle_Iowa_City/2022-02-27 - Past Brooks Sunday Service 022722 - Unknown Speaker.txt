[Music] that's the kind of atmosphere i like to hear amen when jesus is in the place i'm okay there's a lot of things i'd like to say this morning but we're going to preach a word first as allah did you and i just want to encourage everybody this morning and don't ever forget that you're in a battle yeah there many uh trees have cast their fruits and we realized by god's grace did you as the day approaches we might see a lot of things happening amen um kind of speaking of something i just learned on last thursday and i'm sure many of you are aware of that and we'll speak about that but i don't want nothing to destroy this anointing that i'm feeling here hallelujah and first of all uh we're going to be coming from uh philippians philippians the first chapter and then we'll take a script a couple of scriptures from second corinthians 1 i know the lord is in this place jessica and i'm i'm looking for that that time when it's all over so we'll turn to philippians the first chapter philippians and we're going to read this verse of that chapter being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ jesus that is one of those scriptures that we must all bear within our hearts secretary second corinthians the eighth chapter the same corinthians i'm glad to have my wife with me she contends my family and a couple of my grandchildren second corinthians the eighth chapter deceived i'm beginning at the eighth verse i'm sorry beginning at the eleventh verse of that chapter this is now therefore perform the doing of it that as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have for if there be a first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not verstappen accomplishment same chapter we'll now read the sixth verse chapter 8 verses in so much that we desire titus that as he have begun so he would also finish in you the same grace our gracious father we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your presence and we give you praise we give you glory we give you honor because you're worthy of all praise hallelujah amen it is you who have kept us safe and not we ourselves and we give you praise this morning for your beautiful holiness and your way of life in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated in the message uh the restoration of the bride tree restoration i kept hearing brother branham use the word dismay and to be dismayed is to uh to lose courage uh to lose your courage or resolution in other words a man you it sets off an alarm and often time we find out uh apparently that when [Music] or in portion of the confusion where there was a time they believed god we even thought we'll quite you they have allowed fear and unbelief to come in a and the work that god started within you and live like he will complete it hallelujah amen no matter what goes on keep your eyes on jesus hallelujah you remember the little story where jesus was walking on the water [Music] and peter said lord if it be you. and the [Music] he allowed fear to overcome the word spoken hallelujah and when fear gripped him hallelujah he began to sing oh my but the portion i love about this is that he was so close to his goal hallelujah before he began to sing the song let's say your journey is almost over keep your eyes on jesus christ hallelujah amen this thing says shows that we are partaker of okay the psalmist hallelujah hallelujah because this grace is so amazing as if we've never [Music] god's when it comes to being dismayed we're not the first ones who come against obstacles we're not the first ones who come against obstacles you know that will make us stand still it puts us into a shark may see love on the [Music] jesus is declared in us hallelujah it may seem like it's taking a long time for change to happen within you but remember i believe god is a perfectionist hallelujah he knows how to mold you he says [Music] but let me say it like this you must in order to be strong in god you must become nothing hello amen because pride comes before a fall basketball game somebody help me here if you are being motivated by pride see who's there to motivate people as if you are something you are nothing hallelujah these are not my words brother says in the message presuming 1962 he said you're nothing as long as you think that you're nothing the bible says when a man thinks himself something he shows nothing he is nothing that he ought to be that's exactly right say exactly you think yourself nothing come down hello so god can empty yourselves out you for feed therefore man you're trying to fill yourself up he said you empty that's the biggest job for the church and the individual see if we're not careful we will allow the same worm the palmer worm the cankerworm and the locust remember hallelujah the caterpillar will eat [Music] and that worm is a destroyer it says insect the soil it comes to eat you away it comes to take your joy it comes to take your fellowship it comes to take your love [Music] hallelujah we're on the battlefield and we see by god's grace the jew we don't have much time i just heard the other he believes in the war of the armageddon inquires and he said that is the only true reset somebody helped me here they felt the show it's later than what most [Music] he said don't you worry [Music] of the catholic church they just met the other day what does the catholic church guess have to do with russia catholic [Music] you know i can't say he's the man but i believe he's the man hallelujah when you can go into ukraine now i'm not going to stop there i'm just going on but i want you to realize it's not going to get easier hallelujah real this life get set together can bring the united states as well as the world to its knees i say hallelujah so that you [Music] [Music] and to understand has got us protected don't you understand what i'm saying it has protected us [Music] there's so many things in me that are not right yet correct hallelujah y'all hear me there are things in me that i need to be delivered from [Music] the only way he is when he's tried to get you to repent if you don't repent being that god will love you god loves you david wasn't going to repent but god had to raise up a prophet to expose him differently exposed hallelujah it was the grace of god somebody help me here hallelujah amen you must realize would ever really take you god is for us and not against us and when god can't get us to walk right now it's a great spanking on us but the bible tells us that god loves those whom he chases you hallelujah hallelujah amen but in all of that no matter how bad things get chicken swab and how many times you make your mistakes and how many times you fall remember you never throw away repentance hallelujah because repentance is always your way out of what is hallelujah you know you can repent one way or the other you're going to repent now are you going to repent later all of us got to meet god to sell now i'm speaking in a way i'm kind of being pulled in two ways but i'm trying to bring this message so you can understand that god is not asleep sometimes god allowed things to happen just to wake you up that's old testament and i'll say it like this no matter what he has to do for me please do it for me for more hallelujah give me correction now and we're going to read the 27th verse verse 7 down to the 33rd verse is that okay everybody with me this morning number 13 beginning at the 27th first and they told him and said we came unto the land where the thou sent us and surely excuse me it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless you hear that that's that's like but nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anac there and the amnecites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountain and in canaanite uh dwelleth by the sea and by the coast of jordan i'll let you eat that much [Music] and caleb steal the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the man that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great statues [Music] and there we saw the giants and the son of anak which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers [Music] [Music] hallelujah but because of all the obstacles because of all the the the giants of course the the young and the different tribes of course [Music] god had delivered them out of egypt out is that right man god caused him the cross to see he had the red sheep back up he had the red sea department it was supernatural after supernatural at the supernatural hallelujah they saw god working through a man hallelujah but they missed it man it's so monkey they were not they missed it he's a monkey seller hallelujah moses was a great man [Music] but if they had only had vision mercedes are they individuals like joshua and caleb jose caleb hallelujah joshua and caleb said jose caleb we are more than able to take the land and god did not like it y'all better hear what i'm saying because when you think in your mind and in your heart god [Music] [Music] how dare who wakes [Music] he gives us strength in our body he hallelujah but i know that he that begun the good numbers the 14th chapter the next chapter please see we we may not understand what i'm trying to preach right now god has spared many of us on how many of you have ever had god to run a roadblock you know what i mean by that can you say that again in your mind [Music] there have been times [Music] jeff was i uh somebody help me here i'm not the only one if you sit there and say you've never had temptations like that was at the same time because he knows your heart you're going to be able to care he knows in your heart you really do want to be stopped wait a minute y'all help me here because let me tell you something about the flesh what would the intros are but the flesh will blind you if david only understood see david the consequences of his lust the the the son and he never would have done it in aleppo he was blind so blind that he was not going to even make right with god let me empower you god's mercy and grace y'all better hear me today since the prophet a word to open david's eyes david even knew david's seven members that the man who did this thing was worthy of death [Music] somebody help me here man yeah are we and when nathan said to david he kind of thought yeah you are the man we can't imagine what david felt like did he get punished escalated oh you're going to be punished hello but david said ability i rather fall into the hands of god than in the hands of a man but let me say it like this david lost his baby and he lost his children and because of what he did of course the secular all kinds of evil plagued his family see you don't get away with stuff you don't get away with things god loves you see you with them he's going to chase on you and he's going to whip you if i would wait until you never ever do such a thing like that please because israel is literally israel in the face of god literally we can't do it and sometimes we say that don't you hey lord i just feel until you empty your pride out just gotta take your food to you when you empty out uh god will fill you up jeff foreign so all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried and the people wept that night you understand me in their minds the they were thinking god was sending them to their deaths don't understand me that's the way it always will it will look like that syllabus when the world council of churches began to squeeze god is sending you to yourself [Music] what about the three hebrew boys godliness [Music] [Music] you must know [Music] and the children of israel complain against moses because god said unto moses just let me go and i kill them all and moses cried out say lord don't kill them all like that in other words in an untimely season it wasn't god will move away from this church do you have vaseline and you're going to find people falling to the devil hallelujah amen you love the lord the man they said yeah he even said what happened to that all night prayer see people don't even know they don't believe in those things it shows hallelujah all the things that god has given this bride to make it in this message let me tell you it doesn't matter if the whole of the church memphis don't believe every word that when brother branham went off the scene okay the mighty angel came down launch presented this under and that same angel that was with brother branham he's with the bride of jesus christ and he comes in the form of the holy ghost the mighty [Music] but if you don't move into that atmosphere and let me tell you something too what we didn't chosen it doesn't matter who falls and drops you must have in your heart in your mind let's move on continue why was the lord brought us why has the lord brought us to this land to fall by the sword that our wives and children should become victims would it not be better for us to return to each other [Music] people leaving the message going back to their own church what is it it is anointing it is an anointing i will say it again it is an anointing [Music] god let that group rot in the wilderness jealous i'll escape that's what i've been crying that's what i've been crying out about out the holy ghost there is no way you can defeat the spirit they see you can you push the vein hallelujah without the holy ghost jezebel is going to get you y'all to presume it's just supposed to be something that's supposed to be true that this message is right [Music] [Music] [Music] we have to prove the rules of all our prayers so we're not presuming amen we have the right of only we have the right to right to distract us they will destroy now to you people this is a quote that was can praised all of you last night was here somebody laid hands on you we prayed the president of the lord came down revealed we cast them [Music] [Music] it's a battle the promise is yours that was a promised land they had to fight to get every step of it and the promise is yours [Music] hallelujah let me say it like this remember when the prophet had a a disease in his stomach the doctor said if he would eat heavy food hallelujah but he took the promise of the word and he ate those beans he said his body wants to throw them up they get some coffee and every time his body would throw [Music] [Music] [Music] oh my god it wasn't an illusion hallelujah amen but we sing that song through heart trials tribulation the tribulation persecution perception i'll be faithful to your fidel so you got to understand i love the compound what's coming our way is not going to be simply that jesus christ will be with us now we belong to the baptist group well you can't believe that that wasn't for us what do you what what do you you do let's go for faith take the sword and cut free of it and keep marching on premier leap let me bring it to you might say divine healing like there is one division it's not for us oh they don't say it they're taking it but everybody run to the doctor man nobody asked god about it personally and sometimes we suffer because we don't we don't want to feel the pain and the difference oh you might die well if i die if you don't believe in the spoken word [Music] somebody [Music] [Music] your substance will never run out somebody help me here oh it's the truth every day some of us have witnessed riding in the car with no gas so when the gas gets so expensive don't be dismayed by the commercial [Music] oh my you might not believe it but my wife is a witness here my family i was coming from atlanta georgia from preaching i was so tired i did not even feel like driving and i said oh lord help us you may not believe it anyway as far as my wife and i are concerned oh my god off of the pavement took us home de [Music] it happened more than once you don't have to believe me i'm not i'm not a prophet as such but one thing i know that i am the bride of christ oh that would i ask anything he amen i told you and there was no way we could have gotten out of that accident calm why am i family three coming at us at one time or maybe all i could do was call on the [Music] we would have died [Music] and if it was my imagination may god forgive me now you might think that's difficult because it's in our time of mary and martha felt come up with something when jesus says come on resurrection and if you roll away the stone he's been in the grave [Music] think god weighed that over us just to see what god said god will receive that now in his people you can't say your bride if you don't have the life of the spirit to people they get true they pull the sons of [Music] and foreign told elijah if you see me going america in other words if you see the rapture if the rapture has been made clear to you i'm going to drop the man tower [Music] [Music] [Music] they still i got something but i want the camera off in a bit take your shoes back and pick out this one god is not slack not now god is not slack concerning his promises god is not slack concerning his promises not willing that any should perish but then all should come to repentance but that all should come to repentance hallelujah amen but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night command in which the heavens will pass away again and the elements will melt with fervent heat is but the earth and the works there are in it will be burned up here if anyone in the pride of life and right it's not of the father but uh is of the world the world is passing away from the lust of [Music] if you don't stay connected with the word with supplication with prayer fasting if you can whatever the case may be what key the thing that keeps you in that ram to hear from god now let me uh you know we know the parable of the seed there was nothing wrong with the seed if the [Music] the water marshes and grows it causes you know what i want to die the rain the water the moisture causes you to die and rot [Music] did you what make you thirst in order to thirst you have to have something that's living who are well are soft they've ever given you understand me that's the christ in you living god feeds off of your worship and your praise faith off of your praise i'm gonna just quote this quote and i'm gonna let you go well not let you go but uh just uh get into what i really want to get in shortly because i believe it this way that's because your quality i me to restore now to bring anything back to its rightful owner therefore some way therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner to like if someone stole some property come for example and they're holding the property captive uh oh what a text oh what a subject how i'd like to have two days on that in force foreign [Music] i see we have a right to force these claims upon satan and say give it back diablo and he has to do it because the holy spirit is there to make him do it the law of the land is to enforce it and for the land it's by the land but the law of the spirit man of god is true that's what it is before satan and the father give up that which he has unrightfully peace sickness of the body the zombies are placed upon people made them in his image and the church is given the rightful legal rights to take the holy spirit upon the sentence this upon him this last quote you know we scream we survey nuclear we hollow which is nothing wrong with that yeah and we don't know what to do and the only way to overcome that confusion is it get down on your knees acknowledge the lord and he will direct your past body it's here just like a husband called used to come and white is one person something you and i are going to be one more yeah satan just gets so angry hallelujah take it not robbery to be equal with god the bride are one the bride are one tree of life in other words like husband and wife is the same size two seconds ah man you know what i mean can you pause it okay i just it's not gonna be so bad but then
