owns owns Premier versus we have been ministering uh in Des Moines by way of a series of the city let me uh because I believe that is the greatest revelation of all time that's because Calver tisement is began read the first verse verse and indeed bear with me dinner without in your mind should be corrupted from the from this is if he that cometh preaches another Jesus whom you have not preached or if ye receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him yes phobia you know thank you to the please for he have made him to be seen for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God of God second Corinthians it seems like it's not the same the difference yeah in English and French song a little bit different is huh okay okay statue is being with us secretary [Music] [Music] amen [Music] we thank God we like to entire the message The Church Without spot wrinkle or blemish when we think about it calvary but Jesus defeated Satan thank you he defeated death hell and the grace and there's a reason why but when Adam and Eve failed God needed a man to complete the mission we find out by God's grace that Adam after he was to produce sons and daughters in the image and likeness of God but when Adam and Eve [Music] in other words Adam was the god God the Earth he was able to command the animals he was able to command the wind top of it had to be obeyed hallelujah amen and we find out by the grace of God that afterwards after sin nature in itself went uncontrolled because Adam was placed on the earth to control nature hallelujah amen but after the fall there was no one there to control the nature the weather did what it wanted it to do animals did what they wanted to do Hallelujah it came to the point that man had to eat meat men had to eat meat a long difference in order to live full of evil men had to eat natural things but in the beginning man lived by the voice of God hallelujah amen we are now in a state of being men the very civilization that we're living in is totally insane if a man or or totally crazy from our in fully and we realize by God's grace if there is a people that is insane there must be a people that is saying hallelujah and therefore people in this in this totally contrary to this civilization Hallelujah and though we are in the way though we are in the way they call heresy they call crazy crazy ones Hallelujah Calvary in itself means a lot even when John look to see the lion foreign hallelujah amen as if it had been slain from the foundation of the world what we must realize today is that things must change actually they cannot remain the same and as I say and when we come to church we come to be changed hallelujah amen is that right that's the correct let's turn turn I'm sorry just reading from the message works is Faith Express ion 1965. we're gonna we're gonna read uh paragraph 330 323. here brother random says we realize father that we're headed face with eternity the world has gone insane murders Mountain little girls being cut up to pieces and ravish the people Deshawn men wearing their hair like women and women the race is dying the world is dying everything's dying the church is dying let me interject this listen if the church everything is dying there must be something that's living hallelujah amen he goes to say oh God bring life bring life oh God revealed to these people I can only pray and lay my hands upon them but you're the one that can heal them granted granted with my hands upon them yes and as with all my heart in the name of Jesus Christ heal these people now want to take this quote and I want to say when it comes to Healing absolutely needs healing hallelujah amen and Ovation the word shame means heal video and we need healing we need healing of the body and we need healing of the Soul hallelujah amen Hallelujah amen amen let me read another thing coming from the identification of Christ in all ages and it reads paragraph 36 paragraph consists we're in a changing disposition [Music] as in 1964. so you understand I love a company when brother Brenner with the scriptures uh or how can I say when the word was opened in 1963 the message changed the message he could no longer preach just the things that he preached Hallelujah he began to preach to the bride alone for this message he was going to pass away hello amen he knew it one of the sisters Linda said I had a dream I can't remember her name but he said to that sister yes sir sister the dream that you have yeah he said it's true the steering wheel has been taken out of my hands hallelujah amen he knew his ministry was coming to an end come on he knew ing on the scene it is [Music] [Music] [Music] no mercy [Music] the pride of Jesus Christ is feeding upon foreign by the inspiration Hallelujah let me move on we're changing now every change just like a building a building just like Building Company you come to the corner you have to make that beat everybody want to run right Hallelujah you have to just one big wall but we're building a building and we come to a corner and you got to change those Corners as Brother Don cries so well he says so stated in it not long ago at those changes where the Trouble Comes is that right amen see it's hard on that corner so from my channel that corner and make it just right the first sequence Hallelujah and that's where a lot of people have stopped say like your book like you heard me say I saw a little uh saying I saw a little writing and in this writing it don't say exactly there's nothing there's nothing wrong y'all understand me there's nothing wrong with a bend in the road except I'm working you make the turn I wanted you through hallelujah amen now let me ask you a question how many times you have been running down the road and you didn't know a curve was coming and all of a sudden quickly yeah do you just continue to go straight and so you must understand we must understand and the time is focused on the pride of Jesus Christ you become the statue of a perfect man you're going to miss it you don't have to take my word for it amen amen God is good so why am I saying this because the statue of the perfect man makes one see makes a person understand second person there got to be changes hallelujah amen now if God can't change you see he can't save you in the people y'all hear what I'm saying it is so simple it's a simple the same blood of Jesus Christ it's the same blood of Jesus Christ that sanctifies you it's the same blood that seals there's only one blood and that's the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen you know this thing is for a long time I I struggled personally I was like a man uh you know trying to put these virtues on myself yes oh I gotta put on pressure he is the master builder [Music] about you see what brother banham left on record for the bride it takes a strong hand of faith [Music] hallelujah amen you know I saw something in the message uh uh Faith uh Faith work is uh yeah works it's Faith expressed something that I'd never seen and he said the ground for this message was prepared you were prepared and if the ground had not been bad you would not have been able to receive this message hallelujah amen and the grounds were good somebody help me here no matter what you you've gone through okay he prepared for this age you didn't prepare it he prepared you didn't come to God God came to you hallelujah what what is he not only forgives the pride of Jesus Christ here in the message invisible Union of the bride of Christ paragraph 228 paragraph this this is to really believe it is y'all hear what I'm saying like we declare we do commonly declarations you will not even have the ability to doubt one word hallelujah amen I'm not talking about Justified those who are Justified there are a lot of Christians who are Justified I'm not talking about just being Sanctified is that right because even when you sacrifice you can deny the word you say what do you mean brother bro [Applause] because Jesus said and he prayed for them Jesus prayed for them blew his breath on them [Music] God on the inside the pride of Jesus Christ that's all we know we know [Music] [Applause] whether or not I see it whether or not I feel it yeah Etc Hallelujah let me move on the word justify though you've never done it is and what does the blood of Jesus Christ what does it do for the True Believers it takes away the guilt consciousness things Hallelujah if he doesn't remember it if you don't remember your sins why should you why should you I'll say it again if he if Jesus Christ doesn't remember your sins seizures [Music] you cannot read but when you allow your past take your presence Hallelujah hallelujah amen one of the things I do not like insurance is when somebody who is a Christian stands in a church and somebody tells me well you should have known her before yeah no no I don't care what she was good I don't care he was a drug addict if he was a pimp [Music] Jesus Christ washes away all your sins so much so as you stand virtuously in the presence of the Lord hallelujah amen actually when somebody doesn't confess their sins before God and then you got the audacity and pull it from under the blood Hallelujah let me finish this in God's book let me read this all over but the word justify just though you've never done it it's not even regarded at all that's the word I was trying to get to you sister Ruby when we was talking about the word that word regarded God don't even regard it he pays no attention how is it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness and marriage is divorced and dead your own your old book what am I saying the Bible said we are excited be loved somebody as a Christian you do not walk away walk around with guilt because God has made you free passage and the Bible says he whom the son is set free indeed you got to walk around here like you got Liberties you're not changed Hallelujah with the old things of the past God has Set Me Free set you free yeah that old lying Devil he's a liar amen that Devil comes around here when he can remind you of your past brings your joy down to alone yeah don't let the devil steal your joy foreign [Music] you are Justified therefore being justified it was accused it was accused you was accused you've never done it in the first place you know in the first okay the first place was when I was in him the first place was in and when I was in here [Music] you say what do you mean brother because Before Time began hallelujah amen brother Brandon said brother not only were you Justified you were Sanctified you will feel with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you never said in the first place amen the old Union the old Union using the Sea of God forgetfulness you wasn't married to it he is shame himself in your place amen you see because when crucified him Calvary he was naked do you understand me he didn't have one piece of clothing on here but when he found me when he found you you were naked then what did he do he became your nakedness the second or something hallelujah amen hallelujah amen I know sometime we get we get tired yeah Hallelujah yes right so correct oh my God he took your place for you you were predest foreign some of us never been in an organization nominations [Music] [Music] doing all kinds of things Hallelujah somebody help me the message yeah when I get there a lot of people don't like it but it's true anyhow that's a part of this system but let me ask yeah have you received [Music] we have a real Pentecost yourself thank God for God for church it is not because you've been so righteous it's not because you've been so good Hallelujah the only reason why he sees us without spot wrinkle of blemish because of the Holy Ghost Christ in you foreign coming from the message this is the thing often time we fail to see the presence of the Lord when we come to church that's where he where he shows up he's everywhere he's with us every day all day [Music] he knows your thoughts so far off the Bible says there is no hiding place in Jesus Christ you are safe y'all better hear what I'm saying if you outside of the blood you song he he doesn't see you he hear the voice somebody help me here hallelujah that's why Paul said my life is Jesus y'all hear what I'm saying this is what we must understand without the Holy Ghost I would declare my own life what without the Holy Ghost I understand this I would declare that my own life has been one of the hypocrisy y'all know what I'm talking about how many of y'all go a day without making a mistake then tell me how you do it yeah how many times you have willfully seen voluntary the Bible calls it iniquity you know to do good but you do it now somebody help me promoting Victory because of his blood because of Calvary we have Victory is that right oh my God see we battle things we don't have to battle with things we don't have to fight with the shorts because Jesus Christ did it all he won every battle you say well where don't come in the picture because when he was on Earth I was in him you was in him and brother when he said every battle he fought and big every Victory he won you won the victory with him [Music] in the presence the presence of God unrecognized and how you recognize his presence is when the promised word uh foreign Hallelujah not word only possible but by manifestation manifestation coming from another quote y'all don't mind me do you that's the feeling of God the prophet says into him to be partaker who is all that foreign when you and I see what God is doing it later did you say everything is made Provisions for you and I called before him and be in his presence hallelujah we're invited into him which is here to unbelieve us by the veil of human flesh is they know that Glory get rid of it it's not it's it's it's no more a word reality Massachusetts [Music] but now let me know there is light it ain't the word [Music] hallelujah see what I mean there shall be light yeah those of you those of you who recognize the voice oh come on somebody that is the LIE the lights walk in the light Hallelujah as he is in the light and the blood of Jesus Hallelujah we're not only cleanse you but you have Fellowship God said one with another hallelujah we're not walking just by word we see where we're headed man we came from God and we go back to God remember stranger traveling through this land Hallelujah I'm being led by the pillars amen [Music] because we got back we got baptism oh God it's so good I would tell her I was telling my wife just the other day I said God has been so good to me I don't know about you but I go through uh times when I can look back depositives [Music] even when I was stumbling fall America when nobody else couldn't reach my heart he would come in as a friend hallelujah amen and lift me up and I was not worthy oh like that song saying do you like Jesus Hallelujah yeah his name is exalted above all names and to approach God you must approach him who in the name Jesus Christ he is the door is that right amen hallelujah amen Paul was a wonderful man Paul was a uh the angel to the Ephesus age but Paul had problems the problem and if you think in this message you're not going to have any problems the devil has already deceived you hello you come here to be tested somebody help me here you come to me tried you got the proofs um even brother random said it like this he said you can know the word is right in your head correct but that you can know the word in that this is in word Works uh is ex faith I get that cool that's good to mix up that yes he said you can know it in your spirit because your parents but it won't move until you got God in your soul when you got God in your soul when the word is going to work right for you Allah so don't blame God when things fail the word never fails foreign hallelujah amen Oh Glory to God wow yeah we started a little late and then the song service went a little late so I'm gonna um do we have a certain time we've got to be to the place anytime okay okay listen let me move on it's a manifestation he said God said let there be light that was the word there is light ain't the word now it isn't just a written word to us it's a reality we are in him now we're enjoying so sometimes now we Behold Him now we see him the word manifesting himself hallelujah amen he said it's here out there be it's here out there why is veiled in human flesh you know what I'm saying Paul says for I know this in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me for to will is present with me but how to perform that way for the good that I would I do not for the evil which I would not that I do can I get a test of testimony all of us we go through these battles that our flesh causes us to do Paramore hallelujah amen I find in a law that when I would do good yeah evil is Pleasant with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man aren't you but I Delight in the law of God after the Inner Man Japan but I see another law in my members against the law of my mind bringing me into captivity to the law of sin Allah that's why brother you see sin turn your head hallelujah amen now I don't know about you but sometimes the devil sets of stations just to trap you if it is you know for example you you you may have decided I'm going fast today I think and then all of a sudden you know your wife cooks your favorite meal yes or somebody said you know I was thinking about you when I was over at B-Bop's Japanese so I brought you a big burger and gone bigger y'all know it's true and what you gonna tell a person right you don't want to hurt their feelings that's what the devil says he set it up and normally we fall to it normally we fall to normal Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death it is on us to kill Hallelujah Hallelujah that's why you need the holy ghosts when I see the blood hallelujah amen he said I thank God see this flesh shall never believe not only do you kill him hallelujah hallelujah now I'm almost done let's go because I want you to really realize something here this is a real good this is a favorite quote of mine but these are my words sees sees it all to choose there is no hiding place every sin will be brought to light only the blood of Jesus can free us from science prove that your actions never die it was actually and brother Brandon backs it up God who is rich in Mercy he said you know like in television television has picked up the every every that every time we even move our fingers it's on record every word we say is now see television has proven that television doesn't manufacture picture his only channels waves that in into the uh television see it doesn't make it see it doesn't make it there was television when Adam walked on the earth hello foreign [Music] so let me say it like this the only way you can escape this is that you be found under the blood hallelujah amen and the only way you found under the blood you have the Holy Ghost in your soul I'm gonna say that again the only thing the only way you'll be found under the blood yes he's at the foolish versions they were under the blood Hallelujah the foolish virgins can sing they can run up and down they can lay hands and people be here and you still could be foolish because you would you failed to go all the way with God this is your day you can go all the way with God don't let the devil fool yeah religion won't work I don't care how you get it at home and Amazon in your bedroom in your kitchen wherever but you need to be sure y'all hear what I'm saying you got to make sure in this last day that you're covered by the blood that's the only thing that's your free that's your ticket out of here into his glorious Kingdom Hallelujah don't let nobody stop y'all better hear what I'm saying you got people that's going to do wrong in churches God's coming for individuals yes yes well sister so and so did this or that uh you don't gossip about that you've been ordained to go fix it but I'm not going to go there but my point is you've got to know where you stand with God that old Temple you got that'll temper that you have it's got to be dealt with yeah the spirit of jealousy has to be dealt with yeah the spirit of immorality has to be dealt with you weren't saved I said you won't make a rapture so I got you quiet and now I got you thinking I really really you know I'm I that that um that quote I just read about television I'm gonna be using that a lot of people to forget that when you think God don't see you come from he sees you and you've got to be careful in this message because people in this message asking their visions people in this message still have visions and some people have word of knowledge God will come like a natural man and talk to you say you know that sister there I mean she just committed adultery oh you don't say that yeah yeah that could be God talking to you for power see y'all getting scared now because knock knock so you you you we gotta understand God talks about it you know how people say oh I love you brother Brooks well they told Brother Branham that and brothers any holy ghost film when somebody lie to you gotta say they lying he's real cereal and I'm closing on this hey put them in there I was in a man's Church in in Ohio that was one of the missions he wants you to talk amen now now think about it it's done for us we have to always give for praise I got to put my wife in on this because you remember now uh remember from my sister she's looking at me now but the truth of the matter is the football I rarely hear praises I rarely hear testimonies where are the Praises and the testimonies you know you got them I'm sure you have Praises Are you ashamed to testify Hallelujah you know I remember I didn't even have a dime to my name and I need it I needed a dime to make a telephone call now you know that's long ago Hallelujah and I asked somebody do you have a yeah all of a sudden the light came from out of the corner young lady who stood by me Saw The Light The Light Came In Front of Me began to circle like this and when that light stopped it was more than enough but they are simple more it wasn't a dime it was a quarter it's just but it was enough to make the phone the success you don't have to believe that testimonies amen let me tell you when it comes to money you should never worry about it he's got all of that you're fairly asking for it that's why you don't get it often times cause you didn't ask foreign I didn't even ask for money I I needed it because I was still a single man and the Lord said I'm going to bless you with some money today yeah listen nobody gets ready but on my way to church I had to stop because it started raining on my way up to the church because it was on top of a hill and and yes I don't know who dropped it if someone did drop it all I know it was mine two seconds you see you see but the power power the supplement hallelujah amen it's real people God is real and and you have said you have to y'all need to testify y'all need to say I heard somebody say we don't do it because we don't want people to think we're trying to draw attention to ourselves don't do it but if you want to give God the glory you need to give God the glory they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony you love the Lord I'm quitting there's something else I wanted to say but it slipped my mind but people of God we are such a blessed people a blessed people and don't ever don't ever let the devil think you're not blessed let us ever make you think walk like royalty by shares glory to God and when you're in need don't give the devil the praise ah I feel like dancing in the spirit soccer is freeze I didn't even hear that one amen amen God is good to us [Applause] amen we we uh we have a uh baptisms and I was so happy when I heard uh who uh want to be baptized is he and I are going to work together to baptize you hello in the name oh Lord Jesus Christ for y'all if you don't understand even when brother Merle was here it was he and I who helped baptize so both of us are going to get in there and baptize you yeah Hallelujah is that all right I shouldn't say that but it is what we're going to do by the grace of God because of the time I didn't know whether brother uh want to go over some scripture but for those who are going to be baptized we want to go over the scriptures with you uh after the service so when we get to the place of baptism we won't have to go through the ceremonial part of it the word part but we'll we'll baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because time is an essence you love the Lord amen you know you you finally made me feel good um I'm like okay I know I'm tired but these guys are tired but I'm glad that somehow the Lord moved because people we gotta love one another foreign already [Music] but it's always good to be here by the grace of God Amen for those of you who've been praying for me I haven't gotten results back yet [Music] in the MRI but I can reassure you that all things are well amen amen so we appreciate the Lord they did a little test on my heart and said my heartbeat is irregular I'm like I don't believe that he's on Fair bear ancestors I appreciate your information
