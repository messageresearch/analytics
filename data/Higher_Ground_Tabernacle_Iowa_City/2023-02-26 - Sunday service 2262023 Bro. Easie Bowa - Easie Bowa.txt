[Music] from verse 1 to 6 second king chapter 2 from verse 26. [Music] I've always before we read the scriptures with a prayer our heavenly father the moment has come time has come where you want to speak to us Lord we want Jesus Christ you come and see all the leaps lips the human lips so that you speak because the person that's here people that are here did not come to listen to me they came here to listen to you speak they don't have amen for this morning I love to bring something with that uh maybe it's God's grace you can go with this on four or three Sundays and we'll see how the spirit leaves us [Music] the theme of this is going to be Elisha and his calling foreign we want you to be ready for this so we read the word it came to pass when the Lord will take up Elijah into heaven what the Lord has sent me to Bethel and he said as the Lord liveth as thou so liveth I will will not leave thee so they came to Jericho the sister prophets and the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha and said unto him notice now that the Lord will take away thy master from thy hat today and he answered yeah I know it holding your peace Terry I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth as I so liveth I will not leave thee and they went they and they went on the Lord blesses the reading of his word so as I said this morning we'll talk about Elisha and his hauling yes I think the microphone is working okay [Music] he said that Elijah and Elisha are the type of the Church of the Church of the church and God is Christ and Elisha typifies the church now God calls the young Prophet Elijah [Music] to be the successor of the great Prophet Elijah it was not as simple a simple Affair the responsibility now it was a great responsibility that he had to take and the word is to be a successor means to come out or to take the place had to come after Elijah to take the place he had to come back and take the place so it was a very heavy response [Music] Elijah and Elisha were the type of Christ was here on Earth an accomplished great Miracles and Great Signs Spirits were sent down on Earth to come back to the church that means to the believer so if we go back to the history where we read in the first verse the sixth verse [Applause] I made their journey in three steps [Applause] when Elijah he wasn't where he was a plowing and Elijah Elijah went to Elijah he told them he asked him and they started walking it is Jericho to the Jordan three walks that's how God calls his church God calls his church and everybody in three three steps foreign foreign they could cross the Jordan Matthew now because there were three steps of Grace some water here across the Jordan now what is the problem again [Music] now sometimes we can be in Jericho or better the sons of the prophets they're also uh people that cause confusion the troublemakers sings that the preachers they're the ones that cause a lot of trouble to the children of God of Fire amen the Revival amen methanol now kindly said when Elisha became the Revival now people saw that the same God who was the same God of Elijah my problems we are the bride of Christ but the spirits that was in Christ we don't see that same Spirit today and the three steps struck his Road the sons of the prophets they saw it from the others Elijah and Elijah not coming back when Elijah when Elijah comes back yeah [Music] and they all he also crossed and the sons of the prophets you know he left his Spirit God never kept the spirits and he never went back to him to this day this morning where is that Spirits Among Us where is the spirit says now listen to what he says and a man called by God don't sit down time a man called by God I was crying I was crying every time of what the church says today what about us disciples we're here like orphans we remained and Brenham told us we remain as if brother Brown told us then you're out there saying you know I don't know I don't know about those things that's how we are foreign are in the states where they can handle this revival it did he says we cannot have a Revival as long as we will not happening and call by God there's been trained by God cannot buy it there for me who are not trained and by normal schools made their summer so late but solid people there's some of their salt men of agiles that God instructed by his school leader foreign God needs those people first Ahmed the giant sweet Alec called the solid the people who are trained in his solid school people who are not afraid Fearless people who have entered into the presence they know his power of healing man who have been trained the Living God so if we need a Revival we need to have manners and the states they know his healing power cannot pay attention from it on the televolution they have not been trained by theology those are the people of God there's so much people cannot be shaked they're shocking on Papa people who aren't Fearless for the Revival my brethrens foreign where is the church going yeah the Rapture will not come in this condition look on the shoulders the Rapture does not come like that the Bible says okay Daniel that Daniel is when he interpreted the the the the the the the the dream of the king is now the king understood that he could uh challenge Daniel he couldn't make Daniel and he made a statue of days he told everybody to worship that the statue made in the images it started with the worship of a man who was dangerous people will worship a Holy Verse that's what we see today people are worshiping brother [Music] before the statue of their Prophets worshiped evil remain ing yes it remains good today there's a trend in the message when you see someone use a certain form to get to a certain results it becomes an inspiration for everybody how are you telling me are you telling me not to do this why do you not want me to do it when the other guys evil remains evil and now it was on fireplace the three boys because of their testimony we have a different story It Was Written in the Bible because of their testimony because of their brain because they were Fearless men they were the kind of men that God is looking for he's not looking for it if it is you don't have your place in front of before God foreign in the defeat in defeat foreign just go go ahead and go I can carry this message just staying like this that says the church is the power that shakes it's the day every day right now to shake this hour distracted we have to finance the days prepared herself foreign and then we were gone no no no no you'll never go to heaven as a camera but you have to work God give you the holy spirit for you to work for you to work for the kingdom of God the center is then you just remain God gives you something to do he gives you something to do and brother Brown says you see hey no matter it is to go in the fiery furnace even in defeat they're ready to go because they have been in the presence and they know that he does exist furnace to our God and brother Brennan says when they were taken into the fire department I can't see the Mighty God yeah see what's going on down there do you not seeing himself look at the time of God's time will certainly come seven times even in defeat the devil can do for you the God needs and you see twice foreign all of them go through the blood says on purpose God makes his people passes on purpose God makes us speak about the gun disappears go through great challenges to do what to do what to purify them to cleanse them that's what those those that's what if Trials of of God oh I believe that tonight what I believe tonight is that God is training those type of people to stand in there people that go therefore and they sometimes they're shaking they're shaken to where they even lose uh they can't even walk anymore [Applause] we already receive the Revival Revival if this church wasn't a Revival people from outside just because of what was what was she even talk about talk to our co-workers about dogs we're no different than that we can't tell them about it because it would have taken people together if we were in a Revival Revival is if we're jobless in the Kingdom that's why there is not anything anything for his salvation thank you like I say brothers it's gonna hurt but if we don't do it it's not going to give you good results if you're just content with coming to church and go back to your review yeah and maybe next Sunday you won't come and then when you become the Revival to be in a Revival for you there's man like David there's someone coming Joseph men like Joseph correct brave people when the when his Masters make him do something bad he will go out he'll run away he will escape the people that we need Mariah so that this church goes forward I was reading in the message I think it was uh yes the other day brother Brown there was a woman that came here she was sick he prayed for a lot of times and she was still not healed in a certain times my sister I see you jayate you have been unfaithful to your husband and it's because of that that you're saying cursing you because of that thing that you did fix it with your husband no brother brothers my marriage well we'll finish right there yes because you love your marriage more than you being faithful to God that you know foreign things like that everything says told her secretary that's all I'm seeing right now I know bring him here and as they arrived because you know there's something ready the problem is right here tell me what you did yeah just tell me what you did it's true he didn't go four ways that's where God will condemn you foreign [Music] man but the second is our Revival to be here when in that that day yeah this man you probably know about the history [Music] because of the name of Jesus Christ God needs people little things that happen whatever little things we lack patience patience is what makes us miss a lot of things we want things to go too fast [Applause] [Music] [Music] to be seen by everybody huh yeah [Music] I was talking to Brother John as we were disabled he said he said what year was your car when I told him to hear my car they brought another model for my car you know I said those people yes they're playing with people that's what I said every year they have to bring them up another month and it will be new again his children you're happy of your success somebody else will be happy because he'll be at the top what the successful anymore clap your hands for him I'm a fair that's my brother sister God bless your brother he gives you a problem you thank the Lord I believe the brother Eric is not here so if it happens if God blessed your brother no this this brother could not it's not worthy of His blessings there was something not going well with you something that's missing in you you'll have a high a high blood pressure you're going to have a high blood pressure God will bless them again if it's gonna continue like this better it's better that I just leave after his own will soon God doesn't ask you a concert he pushes us as he wants he takes brother John and he puts in here [Music] because God is the greatest and he knows everything that you need to play [Music] they will always follow me I took a lot of time I try not to preach too long now I'll finish it we'll continue next Sunday I understand that we'll probably come back to you we'll come back to the call of Elijah as I said God has already sent us a Revival in his last name the world has been shaken by great wonders and as Christ did when he is his spirits come down to the disciples and in his last days has to become Our God signs and wonders those wonders have to be found you see my brothers and found the foundation yeah he says why did christ redeem us was that the footage have you ever asked yourself a question why is it let's be a simple one in the past necessary why did he just not do the atonement to say that is it just not enough to give you all those Powers oh sorry [Music] so God did not have to redeem us [Music] that's why God redeemed us every night every night and day is what we see with you mother Brothers we'll come back next Sunday he says this he did he says in the mark of the beast it is see he says this is it today instead of people working for the kingdom of God he says now replace this with us you are sleeping and you're in a deep sleep until they look at my gas in the sentimental reading a magazine [Applause] people instead of reading the Bible instead of being somewhere in a prayer meeting the histories stories that don't have any importance um if you knew what eternity meant today time the show's on three plus a lot of things have taken place in our life people that read magazines [Music] food magazines and all those things instead of reading your Bible they are going to some parties over there instead of spending your time in a prayer in a prayer meeting somewhere my
