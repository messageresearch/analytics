[1:04:24] secretary
[1:04:36] it has been learned that i'm preaching
[1:04:38] on this subject
[1:04:42] i've emphasized a lot about this subject
[1:04:46] because i've seen the consequences of it
[1:04:48] come on the benefit of it
[1:04:50] like they say the benefit of it the
[1:04:52] calculations
[1:04:55] it's an inspiration that came to me it
[1:04:57] is more than 15 years now a more men and
[1:05:00] myself
[1:05:02] because the word of god is a song
[1:05:06] it doesn't come

[1:23:59] tempted to shame one kiss
[1:24:15] then the time is over they take the
[1:24:16] papers and they never found the answer
[1:24:21] but you wasted your time
[1:24:25] hallelujah amen

[1:57:51] found in the world are we yes

[2:00:38] know someone
[2:00:40] we are busy comparing those two things
[2:00:53] there was this man called franklin
[2:00:56] amen
[2:00:57] amen franklin franklin
[2:01:04] he was somewhere with a
[2:01:06] uh with a flying object
[2:01:13] there was a there was a striking
[2:01:14] lightning somewhere
[2:01:18] he heard something invincible in his
[2:01:20] hand
[2:01:22] then he looked and observed
[2:01:28] the rope that was holding the flying
[2:01:31] object here
[2:01:33] it was wet a lot
[2:01:37] he fell electric or he was uh shocked
[2:01:40] somewhere
[2:01:42] electricity
[2:01:44] there wasn't
[2:01:45] electricity
[2:01:48] nobody knew electricity
[2:01:50] and he felt electricity in his hand
[2:01:52] [Music]
[2:01:54] he felt a shock in his head
[2:01:56] and said there's something invisible
[2:01:58] somewhere
[2:01:59] which is in connection of what i've seen
[2:02:02] listen
[2:02:16] yes
[2:02:38] he start searching for those things one
[2:02:40] by one
[2:02:43] he start collecting the wires just to
[2:02:45] feel the same shock
[2:02:47] amen amen
[2:02:48] a friend of mine
[2:02:50] and branham's telling us
[2:02:54] he said god
[2:02:55] don't need an electricity
[2:02:57] wanted to give electricity
[2:03:12] he found somebody who was available for
[2:03:15] that hallelujah amen
[2:03:20] he didn't go to any christian who was
[2:03:22] praying anyhow
[2:03:25] but he found somebody was able to catch
[2:03:27] the thing that's the sacrifice to
[2:03:29] sacrifice himself
[2:03:33] to give a lot of time to the things
[2:03:36] because he knew that he was going to
[2:03:37] take a long time back from claire with
[2:03:39] franklin
[2:03:40] lynn
[2:03:53] god was fixing to give electricity to
[2:03:56] the world
[2:03:59] electricity
[2:04:03] he found
[2:04:05] franklin
[2:04:08] oh
[2:04:22] thomas
[2:04:24] here in america
[2:04:27] then he looked to the invention of
[2:04:29] franklin
[2:04:31] satisfied he wasn't totally satisfied
[2:04:37] he didn't go to destroy franklin
[2:04:41] but he said i have to develop what
[2:04:43] franklin brought oh creation
[2:04:45] oh christian
[2:04:49] your brother did something good patterns
[2:04:51] don't just destroy him negatively never
[2:04:54] destroy your brother
[2:04:55] amen
[2:04:57] develop the thing from destiny
[2:05:00] if you want to make it better
[2:05:01] benefit your god but the body can help
[2:05:41] until he found the light and he gave it
[2:05:43] to the world
[2:05:45] hallelujah amen
[2:05:48] a normal a man
[2:05:50] scientific a scientific man not to that
[2:05:53] natural manner

[2:14:24] the lord jesus christ
[2:14:34] maybe i will do it later on tuesday or
[2:14:37] monday or tuesday hallelujah
[2:14:55] because by speaking on this subject of a
[2:14:57] second coming hallelujah amen
[2:15:02] it was to prove that the scientific
[2:15:04] world questions
[2:15:06] that
[2:15:47] i can take the scriptures and the
[2:15:49] science
[2:15:50] generation and prove that this
[2:15:52] declaration
[2:15:53] [Music]
[2:15:54] the age in which we live
[2:15:57] according to my understanding
[2:16:17] from the science side to prove that
[2:16:18] today
[2:16:19] because
[2:16:20] that's what this sunday
[2:16:22] practice i'm not making
[2:16:24] about the second coming
[2:16:25] year
[2:16:27] but i'm getting all the science evidence
[2:16:40] second coming of the lord jesus christ
[2:16:42] it's for this age
[2:16:45] it a second amen you catch something
[2:16:46] from there
[2:16:48] don't listen to this young
[2:16:50] science people they'll never protect
[2:16:52] from their side
[2:16:55] they've got help they've got elements
[2:16:58] that are proving can i second if i need
[2:17:01] to change
[2:17:01] that the second coming of the lord is
[2:17:04] hallelujah
[2:17:08] he's taking the scriptures
[2:17:11] and the science too
[2:17:13] down put them together
[2:17:15] and to prove to the world
[2:17:17] that the kind of thing
[2:17:18] is for this age
[2:17:22] amen hallelujah amen
[2:17:37] i'm just like uh making a platform for
[2:17:39] this preaching hallelujah
[2:17:43] like i said i'm not in hurry
[2:17:45] [Music]
[2:17:49] pastor brooks said after a year oh come
[2:17:51] and preach i will come back to this
[2:17:57] because today is just a foundation that
[2:17:58] i'm laying
[2:18:00] down
[2:18:02] but it's giving a sense to what i'm
[2:18:03] saying
[2:18:06] amen amen
[2:18:21] approaching the approaching
[2:18:35] [Music]
[2:18:51] out everything
[2:18:59] and they told me that the
[2:19:02] from people from the world that they are
[2:19:03] the prophetic
[2:19:05] the the prophet of weather they are
[2:19:08] controlling all this movement all this
[2:19:10] wind
[2:19:11] the prophet case can prophetically what
[2:19:13] is the prophet
[2:19:15] he's just predicted
[2:19:17] no prophet i will promise
[2:19:35] he is not the prophet the weather you've
[2:19:37] got the prophet amen amen
[2:19:40] but you will see muslims
[2:19:43] you're going to ignore me
[2:19:45] but if the prophet says something if
[2:19:47] you're in a teacher effectively
[2:19:49] in egypt they always come with the women
[2:19:51] with in the world
[2:19:55] they always give them the weather the
[2:19:57] weather the way the
[2:19:58] tomorrow is going to be stolen
[2:20:15] but when your prophet says something
[2:20:17] i just ignore it listen
[2:20:20] read the bible
[2:20:21] read the bible we just ignore it
[2:20:23] hallelujah
[2:20:25] love prophet you say tell me but they
[2:20:27] are prophets
[2:20:38] [Music]
[2:20:42] it means how this uh time is formed
[2:20:48] the one who's reading one of this
[2:20:50] storm
[2:20:54] because they've started upon this all
[2:20:56] their entire life i
[2:21:01] by the help of some instrument or some
[2:21:03] equipment that the signs have given to
[2:21:05] them
[2:21:07] um
[2:21:08] don't kill direction
[2:21:09] here is by proving which direction the
[2:21:12] wind is going to tip
[2:21:16] what kind of wind is coming
[2:21:20] from which direction other other storm
[2:21:22] is coming
[2:21:24] from then they know how they can fight
[2:21:27] it and push it away
[2:21:29] amen amen
[2:21:35] they consecrated by studying the weather
[2:21:37] they come from continued
[2:22:06] anytime they predict the daily predict
[2:22:08] you will see it coming
[2:22:10] did they create something
[2:22:13] they just started they ruined that
[2:22:15] they started the national laws
[2:22:18] how god have placed these laws in the
[2:22:20] world
[2:22:34] spoken
[2:23:05] [Music]
[2:23:15] but that grace
[2:23:19] is to walk together with the word of god
[2:23:22] why is it grace is gracious
[2:23:25] for those who consider it as a grace
[2:23:27] can't do fullness at the grasp here if
[2:23:29] you just walk out
[2:23:44] amen
[2:23:58] and once you find the eternal
[2:24:06] may the lord bless you
[2:24:08] amen
[2:24:44] we shall stand up on our feet
[2:24:47] [Music]
