ourselves or to You Lord each one of us are hungering and thirsting for righteousness according to Ana mine promise in your word you said that we shall be filled toward and we love you Lord because you first loved us we're so thankful to be in your presence once again Lord may each one of us now just surrender all of our cares all of our burdens all of our plans all of our ambitions all of our faults and failures good pride whatever it might be Lord we just lay it all down at your feet and we surrender to you lord now you might have the three minutes now in the service give you all the praise all the adoration and all the glory because you're so deserving or die commit myself to you or may your Holy Spirit provide strength to the body anoint the ears to hear and on the words that come forth they bless and edify your people in Jesus Christ's name hey man praise the Lord Thank You musicians hallelujah well I'm happy to be here praise the Lord let's turn in our Bibles we'll just read the same scriptures I've developed the phrase here lately as a launching pad because sometimes I don't know where I'm going but he knows amen amen they got the sound turned up for me that's good I can not have to make such an effort appreciate that he may we're reading out of 2nd Timothy 1:7 in Luke chapter 8 we can start with Luke chapter 8 verse 49 it says well he had spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house saying to him my daughter is dead trouble not the master but when Jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only she shall be made whole 2nd Timothy 1:7 says for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind you know therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me as prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God Heavenly Father we ask your blessings upon the reading of the word a man you may be seated a man just to continue on we've been speaking on fear not believe only or fear not only believe and as we've just dealt with this thought we've read the quote where brother Branham says that fear makes you weary and fear makes you wonder and certainly as we live this Christian life and we give our hearts to the Lord I mean of us come from different backgrounds different cultures many of us have come from different places in the world and different family structures and certainly the enemy would have a lot to draw from you know he certainly knows how to attack your mind and in such a way make you feel hopeless make you feel condemned he's good at that he's an accuser of the Brethren but what I love about the Word of God when you catch a true revelation of what Jesus Christ has done for you and what true justification means it means you never did it in the first place once you come to Jesus once you ask the Lord to forgive you and you have a repent of heart all the people around you might try to hold you accountable they might want to they might want to judge you other this Saint might want to accuse you but when you try to come back to God again so many times we do that over and over and over we we come to the Lord and say O Lord once again forgive me Lord and I did this this this of this and we know what would the Lord say to you what are you talking about what's in it was gone the very minute you confessed it and that's if you could only realize the victory in that you know it understand how powerful that really is how powerful the grace of God is how powerful is love is is that when you repent your sins and when you have a remorseful heart and you turn from the lifestyle that you're once living right God's power to forgive you and the power of his love and the power of His Holy Spirit oh my you're free from all of that now you can lay it down you know the scripture talks about an eleventh-hour worker right uh-uh uh-uh you know you just if somebody starts serving the Lord today Oh oh my just because you've been out of 20 30 years you ain't no more special no sir there ain't no big eyes our little use in the kingdom of God Oh one comes home our God rejoices you think of the story of the prodigal son oh my the other sons were like what about me I've been here I've never left Oman but we all should rejoice when we see somebody giving their heart to God we should be so happy and so thankful that's the love of God being shed abroad in your height how about when we see God blessing somebody that's new amongst us we see God maybe giving him a position in the church whenever I even started leaving songs I've been here the whole time and he's never asked me oh come on now well we all want position we're all like titles and we all want experience but I just want to know Jesus let me know Jesus had been crucified let me know it's no man it's Drazen is forgiveness well that's all I need to know I know the Holy Spirit moving in my life I don't need no position I don't need to be elevating a man's ideas and then starts and what man think is great oh let me just be one of those and his kingdom let's experience the love and grace of God and His forgiveness oh my you can't help it it's like a house on fire you just got to tell everybody that Jesus Christ is alive oh my drives away the fear so when that devil comes around running this mouth again trying to remind you of all your past and all your failures and some of us make hard decisions and hard choices and we can't just run away from it we got to face it the next day but don't let don't let that circumstance or that trial that you have to face robbed you from the joy of your salvation look at what David said David said Lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation he didn't lose his salvation you can't lose your salvation but he said restore unto me the joy of my salvation oh don't you understand you're eternally secure in Jesus Christ now let me ask you something were you more eternally secure when you're in the world are you more eternally secure now than then are you want to secure eternally secured today than you were five years now you ain't a nanny is eternity eternal Z Tournament you were always in the mind of God you are always eternally secure and God before I ever formed this world sit on I know my thoughts that I think toward you force to bring you to it expecting in you don't have to worry about how you're gonna end it all up I'm gonna do it for you and our job is just to trust him and believe him and to know that Romans 8:28 says I will work all things out did somebody say all things he didn't just say well I'll try to alert some of them out well you kind of got out here on a limb and I can't fix that for you no sir he said to them that love God and are called according to his purpose and if you've ever had to see it as God on the inside a that's responded to the Lord I want to say he's talking to you hallelujah oh you've heard it said before others that we got TV waves and radio waves coming through you right now you can't hear it you can't see it but if you get that little special crystal that little special tuner in here oh all of a sudden you can start picking up the radio you can start picking up the TV signals only you understand that's what that predestinated seat of God inside of you is it's a special crystal it's an expression ability that when the word goes forth no matter what condition you're in something of satis says lord I believe it I believe it oh that's that predestinated seat of God inside of you that deep call into a deep and praised God there's a deep to respond oh so don't let that fear attack you because fear makes you weary fear makes you wonder and that word weary when it says fear makes you weary maybe we shouldn't look past that too much because we're still stuck in this bag of bones and I don't know if anybody's ever battled pain where you battered hard circumstances but when you weary in your body starts to affect your mind oh you can become so mentally fatigued you start to even question your own judgment you start to even wonder are you starting to wonder if you can even make it oh you get so tired and and you just don't even know what you're gonna do and you feel like you're gonna slap any moment you just feel like you can't take one more step if you're like oh god what's happened to me oh and fear will make you weary are the trials and tribulations of this world that we go through we'll make you weary oh but thank God our strength comes from Jesus Christ thank God we can call upon him I thank God were eternally secure met people who like that word eternally secure but you know I mean if if you were in the mind of God before the world ever was formed if you came from God and you can't go back to God if your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it's all over it's finished Jesus Christ just come to pay the price to redeem you so that when you came to yourself the debts would all be cleaner they would all be stricken off like the prophecy says go ahead and write out the check what do you need tell god what you need tonight you need salvation you need healing you need a sound mind you need power or whatever it is it's right here available for you tonight the prophet of God says on the church age book fear not don't be afraid I am the first and the last I'm he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore what is there to fear the judgment that fell upon him at the cross take this to heart now the judgment that fell upon him at the cross at the grave and when he descended was for us put your name there Mike we talked about this morning about that young kid in the back the Holy Spirit moved upon him and all he just reached up his arms and and he said oh it's not a story any more hearts it's real it's really real Oh hallelujah he did that for you he know where you would be at he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus you know we're the ones that try to condemn people we try to judge them we see people come amongst our ranks and and and they start to serve the Lord and maybe they've been with us a little bit and you're like man you know I you know I think this is the way ought to be you don't know what they're going through but maybe we can love them maybe we can be Christ to them maybe we can be an example to them maybe we can maybe find out what they're going through and get our knee under knees and pray to them say God is there anything that I can do to help my brother and sister Oh God would you help them Lord Jesus I don't know what they're going through I I don't know where they're at but Lord Jesus I love them and I just asked Oh God would you give them a special portion today Lord would you reveal your word to award God we're a family we can't make it without one another Lord and I love my brother and you get on your knees and you start to plead for him Oh God will put you in a position where you can help him but as long as we're so filled with judgment and pride of our own selves and our own works in our own doings I'm out we can hardly help anybody the only thing we can do is condemn somebody else because we're looking at our own works and we think we're righteous but there's none that trickiness but him there's none that's righteous but Jesus Christ and when you come to the trust and accept the blood of Jesus Christ and you've been baptized you can come into his righteousness our righteousness is as filthy rags but all there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus see for a surety our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge as judged the case is settled it's finished there is now therefore no condemnation I love how the scripture says even when our heart condemns us even when your heart condemns you God took care of that he'll let you know look look even when you condemn yourself because really you're the one that knows everything you've done you realize God don't know if you were sinning yesterday and you repent before God don't even know you did that's the word he don't even know it right so it's finished there is there now for no condemnation even when your own heart condemns me one of the old mind condemns you why should the church fear what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us why should it fear punishment or death oh oh I tell you what sometimes we make ourselves good Catholics owe me a coke buy me a coke buy me a Copa well I'm you know I just need to be beat up for this one you know the scripture does talk about we reap what we sow but that don't mean there ain't no grace that don't mean we have to accept what our mind thinks we need to go through and we don't have to accept the punishment of the devil line because when Jesus paid the price on Calvary he settled it and there is therefore now no condemnation so don't fear he's saying it right here this ain't my words why should it fear punishment or death right so so so get that understanding in your mind and it has all been overcome here is the mighty conquer here he is the one who conquered both worlds of the seen and the unseen he that descended as now ascended above all and unto Him has been given a name that is above every name oh I love that yes he conquered death hell in the grave and has the keys therefore thereof what he has loosed is loosed and what he binds is bound there is no changing of it there was no Conqueror before him and there is none beside him he alone is the Savior Redeemer he is the only God and the Lord Jesus Christ it is Babel every time I read that I just want to rejoice is the Oh God and the Lord Jesus Christ in his name you realize there's a whole world full of Christianity that says they know Jesus they say that they they know the Lord and God our God that you you your heart goes out to them because you realize they're trying to worship under in a bunch of religious creeds and they've accepted a bunch of doctrine and trees that's been injected in by the devil and no very when they claim to know they don't even have a clue of his grace and His mercy and you just mind I like to think that a God's grace and mercy has been expressed to you that you can have a true relationship with the Lord of glory oh my thank you lord don't fear John don't fear a little flunk we know John's a type of the brine all that I am you are heir to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst lu lujah you're not way off out there somewhere that's what we always kind of feel like but he's here he's here now and I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear or failure I haven't come to condemn you haven't come to point out all your faults and failures that's that's not why he's here now if you haven't repented of your sins the grace of God deals with your heart and it reveals to where you're slack he reveals to where you're falling short and and and really many times we interpret that as condemnation but look you understand if you're doing something wrong or you're living in sin or you're not doing something right when the word comes forth and convicts you and calls you out that's not condemnation that's the grace of God that's the grace of God and I realized that years ago and my Christian walk when I would when I would fall to something and and you know that's what God will do as brother clever was sharing earlier you know get you know if you fail a test God allow you come right back to that test and give you another opportunity to pass it and that reminds me of a story at one time when I started to serve the Lord and you know when I was out in the world I always say I was out in the world and try to leave it at that because I was out in the world you name it I had done it I had I had run with it all and I had gotten a little trouble and with drugs and an undercover narcotics agent one of my friends he had gotten into some trouble and so he decided he'd be a rat he wanted to be a snitch and so uh he set me up and so I got myself into some trouble and I didn't realize it was the grace of God getting my attention but you know I started to serve the Lord and I and I didn't like this guy you know I wasn't too happy about it and so one day I was driving down the street and sure enough here comes this guy driving by me and I'm thinking to myself that is that guy who ratted me out and all my heart started beating my adrenaline started pumping and I hit the gas to catch up with him and here I come I pull up to the stop light and his windows down and my windows down and the lights red and we're both side by side hey now's my moment I'm gonna let this guy know what he did to me I looked at him he looked over said my life's changed a lot I wanted to say a lot more but I I couldn't do it I wanted to give him a piece of my mind I wanted to tell him what I thought of him uh uh but but all I could get out and I wasn't happy I didn't have the right spirit and I said my life has changed a lot but you know I hadn't seen this guy in a long time ever since that stuff happened is sure enough about a month goes by I'm walking up to the store this guy comes walking out of the store I like here this guy is again are you me and it wasn't like I'm walking over here and he's over there no I'm walking out and we're stepping up on the same sidewalk together like face to face another opportunity I didn't have time to think about it I just looked at him said I don't know whether it invite you to church would punch you in the face so what I said I've been honest I was being honest you know why because I hadn't I hadn't found forgiveness in my heart God was putting me through a test he was putting me through a process he was allowing me to face that again and sure enough not long and I hadn't seen this guy in a long time and all of a sudden God's allowing me to see him face to face and a span of really quick you know and I'm coming up to her store again and I'm like you got to be kidding me there he is again my my mind I walked up to him I said how you doing JD it's a good man what's up hey I just want to let you know man that what God has done in my life he can do the same thing for you and I started to express to him the love and grace of God and you know I wanted that for him because when you really come to the revelation and understanding of what God has done for you how could you ever hold anybody uh-uh and look down upon them for the way that they've lived how could you ever have condemnation for somebody oh my you can only love them that's what love is all love forgives a love covers a multitude of sin if thank God for his love that's the that's the grace of God that's what he does for us it's a process all power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your mitts I'm not come to bring fear or failure but love courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and I will perform it that is my covenant and it can never fail amen we we talked about how when a spirit born spirit filled men in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips well that is the same as deity speaking alright that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go Satan can't stand before that man Oh hallelujah that's a promise to the believers as we just move on a little bit in 1st John 4:17 or 418 says there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love Him because He first loved us are the cloudy skies and the rainy days a sign of his disapproval - you are the trials and tribulations you're going through a sign that that God's not happy with you no and neither are this year the the the the sun shining in the the bright sun rays shining down upon you that's no sign of God's approval his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us does he love you oh yes but how shall we know how shall we know we shall know because he said so oh that's simple well I love what I love it when God makes it simple how do we know he loved us cuz he said so hey man because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself in Gaza gave of gave us of his spirit placing us a son and how shall I prove my love to him oh my my how shall we prove our love to Jesus Christ I mean maybe we should feed more hungry people than the next church maybe we should have no more works than the next brother is it works is it works based how shall we show our love to the Lord by believing what he said oh think I can do that thank you lord I mean it's it's as it's simple church it's simple believe what he said and that shows your life too and how do you know he loves you because he said so praise the Lord by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass oh if you can let that sink in the trials and the tribulations that you're facing now yes the Lord let it come to pass but he made a way for you he made a way for you before the world was ever formed and he sent his word that it would fight your battles and if you just believe what he said and conduct yourself with joy amongst the trial oh you're proving that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh my you know if we only recognize what God has done for us and what he's really given to us and the power that we have and the power of the spoken word and when we recognize who we really are as when we spoke about this morning that the devil knows that when we realize who we are we'll be an invincible army will we recognize the two spirits within the framework of the church that Satan will be powerless before us man that's what we want we want that we want to have this type of understanding we want to go on with God we want to put one foot in another and start to possess the promised land what was a says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you prophesied and rising to the Sun now look how can you say that the Spirit dwells in you this is a big question right oh how many have ever had this question how many have ever questioned whether you got the Holy Spirit oh my and you know with the trials and tribulations and sometimes we make disappointing choices and it ain't gonna be the first time that question comes into your mind but one thing is important is that you settle it in your heart because I've come to it a many times and I've heard the prophet preach the word and so many ways and I'll send I start to win a minute know I got what I think I got but oh thank God for an anchor that knows that my goodness Lord Jesus even if I didn't have it one thing I know that I know that I know that I know is that you started this work in me Lord Jesus it wasn't me that sought you out Alba you sought me out Lord Jesus and you said Lord if you begin the work of me you're going to finish the work oh that should give you some peace that when all of the doubt and all the fear tries to make you worry that you could know it wasn't me I didn't seek myself I didn't find this message I didn't figure this all out but no what was it it was God seeking you and he started that work in you so just rest believe what he said and you watch you perform what he promised that's the Word of God take that in your heart and give the devil a black eye with it he don't want you to know you got it oh my it's like being in a fight you imagine being in a fight and you're holding a big old bat or you're holding a gun or something and the guys are like you ain't got a gun you ain't got a gun you ain't gonna I don't know I thought I had a gun I thought I had a knife I thought I was prepared to fight you nope you got it sure don't got it buddy why cuz he don't want you to use it that's what the devil's doing here he says you don't got it you ain't who you think you are well when we look into the word and said you can do all things through Jesus Christ that strengthens you all the power that was given to me I pulled out of my church and it's had your disposal you just speak the word don't worry about it honey I'm right behind you no back you up I'll fight your battles I'm just waiting for you to speak the Lord just take down my wall I'm gonna come and I'm gonna fight for you but everyone else you got the Holy Ghost just believe it if you've done all that he said full obedience to the learning titles you to the token he said you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and if you've got everything you know to stand stand right there and say I'm gone thank you for your promise thank you for your lord thank you for your Holy Ghost thank you for your healing thank you for your promises hallelujah and watch victory just start to come watch it just factor your little pep in your step oh when you meet your neighbor you meet your boss you can't happen I'm just gonna tell you I've got the grace of the power God how can you say that the spirit swells in you though you've done everything that you know you thought was right here is the evidence whether you got it or not finally the answer to my question I've been wondering this for so long if the spirit that was in Christ is in you it also quickens you to the word for he is the word and if it's contrary speaking if the spirit you have is contrary it quickens you away from the word oh my that's simple and there's something about you with the word just keeps calling you the lawyer just keeps tugging at your heart you just can't get away from it oh yeah just speaks to you it just comes for you oh my goodness what is it what is it you've been quick into the word then it isn't the if it and if it's contrary and quickens you away from the word then it isn't the Spirit of Christ I don't care what you do until that moves you in the word see my sheep hear my voice and they shall live by every word we must keep it simple Saints if you are believing the Word of God and you're doing all you know to do and you're hearing the voice of God and not just with your ears and trying to perform it by the ladder but all it's pulling at your heartstrings and speaking to your heart and it's drawing on you and you know the fingers right look I know what it's like to sit in church and the Word of God deal with my heart and it's pulling on me and I don't respond but that should encourage you at least there's something in there to respond oh my first son or daughter of God you can't get away from it you'll be driving down the road and you'll see a sign that says you know God is faithful and true to his word like man what am i doing out here I'll never forget one time I was out in a big party they called it a rain back then and although the music was going on and I had all the drugs and everything and I we were just dancing and having a good old time and I'll never forget that they interjected something it was kind of more of that music with no words all of a sudden they must have done it because I heard it they they like mix the name of Jesus into it or something like that and us just shocked and this is going to sound weird but I stopped and I said Lord I know you'll get me out of this mess and then I just carried on with my party I mean I can't explain it but there was something in there that was long oh it was just wrong and for the Lord it was this long to be delivered and you know letter just takes their own atmosphere when you just put yourself in their atmosphere when you start to water and with the water do you start to water with prior use time to water and praise all just watch what happens this shackle start to fall away the bondage traps are for you the condemnation leaves and all of a sudden you start to see their eyes and what is it that seed that always has been there that came from before the foundation elected gone put there it's the Lord coming to that seed and just quaking it till I know how important it is for us to be in the right atmosphere you realize that's what happens in atmospheres you know this flesh you put it in in the wrong out Mystere then what will happen it it'll start catering to this flesh you want to know a good way to resurrect that dead man go get around the finger used to do go get around the things you want to do don't do it all of a sudden that dead man will have that old spirit try to get on you don't fool around with her you hear the story about that one historian brother Branham tells about his friend all of a sudden she came crashing in the door over this household brother brand a brother better brother Brendan I messed up I messed up about what am I gonna do or I'm lost lost I'm never gonna calm down calm down calm down what happened what happened like oh you know I was just walking and and this was a friend Brother Bear talks about and and she was a dancer and a she would get like awards and things like that and she just she just thought she would stop and listen to the music for a minute and what happened it drew on her flesh and before she knew and she found ourselves in the arms of another man dancing and there she realized her mistake is she ran awareness he run to she ran to the Prophet milk if you ever find that you made a mistake just run back to the line this went back to the way this trace for you his love for you as encouragement for you his ability for you Wow because look before you even even sinned in the first place Christ died for you he knew you were gonna make mistakes he knew he heard in the Gulf of things he's not holding you accountable for that he knew you mean in a fallen nature so in his infinite mind in his love one of the newest that I'm gonna go to Calvary before you even get him and I'm gonna pay the price for every sin who ever committed and then what happens he puts a seed in there and you're packing that little seed through the world right and you find yourself into some trouble you find yourself living out in sin but what does God do he sends that word and all of a sudden that seed in there oh my it's kind of like popcorn yeah but you ever see that little popcorn you put a little heat under it yeah it in the right atmosphere hi there you're popping that you know you're carrying that little seed of God around with your whole time little popcorn kernel you just get in the right atmosphere you watch that thing and all of a sudden well you know it's earthbound you can't do nothing a little heat calm little fire come it'll present the Lord a little word a little truth oh so then that thing starts to move in all of us like I said you know Lord I realize I shouldn't be living this way or god I just ask that you forgive me Lord forgive me for my sins all of a sudden you start to realize oh god I'm sorry for what I've done and you realize all of a sudden what is happening that seed I was starting to realize oh Jesus I'm sorry for what I did but all I know that you paid the price of me at Calvary and it starts to quiver a little bit its flash to cry it starts to weep itself back to Christ and I'll spend the Spirit of God comes and also that's Easter please it just flies up a little star why because it's come in contact with its maker its kind of contact with the Holy Spirit Lu look you never did it in the first place hi praise be to God if that spirit that was in Christ is in you quickened you to the word oh praise God I like to tell people like this whole thing's read it is so rigged we're in a battle that's already won and I'm so glad I'm on the right side and that devil thinks he'd done something when he gets you to fall or you know you fall down to a temptation or he gets you out some house away and he just thinks he'd done some dumb devil it's already finished this little high when Adam sinned the Ottoman Eve's saying you know we'd jump down as the Prophet cause a little hickey of time we just bounce down in there for a little bit and where did you ride on the the very end just just about one more step poof we're back into eternity and it's all over with brothers just hold on a little bit longer any moment well I don't worry I encourage all the eleventh hour' workers get him out ain't mad at you you can have everything I got come on I love you brother come on over to my house give me my fridge you can sleep on my bed come on over I love you I don't care and I mean that come on over when you got the love of God in your heart you okay I love the story about the thief on the cross look at the thief on the cross there he is hanging next to Jesus and all he says is remember me or what righteous works did here well brother blood blood boy well now wait a sec if that's not fair I've been serving God this law come on where's the love of God and AHA where's the Spirit of Christ oh my god you feel yourself in that position of the sea the scornful we need to repent we need to repent because you know what a truce on the body of God will be man can you believe that thief on the cross and that's so amazing he gots the same reward as me I'm mad at him I'm happy for him oh if any sinner can come to know the love of my Savior oh I'm so happy and when you come to know it it's a cure it's a cure to this whole world that we're living in and you just you see all these people living in sin and bondage and you just want to give them the cure hey I got something that'll help you Willa praise God but that spirits dwelling in you I think what the problem is is I seed there and you keep trying to dig it up we keep trying to check on it the Lord deals with a heart we believe him and take him at his word and we want to like dig it back out and check on a black ears are doing anything you know when you take a seed and you plant it the ground and you water it and you put it in the right atmosphere don't pick it up don't pick it up just let it lay in the presence of the Sun like that little water lily that's buried down there in the muck and mire of the mud down below the water that Sun will keep working on that seed it's there don't worry in the right atmosphere it's gonna spring forth to life well thank God for that that's the journey of the seed and it needs to be in the right atmosphere and that's a place as believers and as we start our Christian or walk and you young men and you young sisters that I want to encourage you the right atmosphere is very vital to your success as a child of God right we want to be a good stewards of what God's given us we want to be productive in the family of God we want to contribute to those that are in need and so it behooves us that we put ourselves in a position to be successful because we see what happens when we go out in the wrong atmospheres or we feed on the wrong things they were catering to the flesh and we're making the probability of making a wrong decision so much greater but if we stay in the right atmosphere feeding on the right things you know the scripture says that if you sow to unrighteousness you're gonna read cookery corruption there's a lot of reap and so you have you go out and do worldly things where you saw the will you reap you'll reap world of things but look please God he said but if you sow do the righteous know just start doing the right things just put one foot in front of the other I'll start just serving God start praising God start doing the things you know to do a watch o watch hallelujah you start to watch the Spirit of God blossoming in your life why because you're doing the right things and you're living in the right atmosphere look the only thing we consider is the word that's the only thing we consider as believers we consider the Word of God and it's hard for us to take God at His Word for now we're always looking at what God did then and looking at what God's going to do but failing to see what he's doing now the scripture says now we are the sons of God now we're seated in heavenly places with Jesus Christ I love that story about Joshua and Caleb how they were given a promise of the promised land and those one-in-a-million they believed it but everybody else didn't believe it why because they are predestinated seed of God when they heard the promise and that they're at Kadish Barnea the spies went over and they came back and they had the fruits showing that the promised land was good they looked at the circumstance get your eyes off the circumstance and on the promise of God oh my reminds me of that story a wonderful story about a couple that had a sick baby and a sick daughter in the hospital a my she was really sick with some disease and she was just on the brink of death and I asked brother Branham to come pray for her and brother Branham you know I love my brother Brennan didn't hoop and holler you know brother Brett oh and did just come in and and pray the prayer of faith and he come in and and I he saw the mom and dad there and he saw the girl and and his hands on her as the story goes and that and their testimony was that they just knew brother Branham could get up there and pray for their daughter that she'd be healed and and brother Branham comes up and you know the kind of the nurse that seemed a little perturbed you know that kind of the the thought of you know you know she's about to cross over and you know what okay well y'all do what you need to do and brother Randall comes and prays that prayer faith and he just Lord Jesus and he prays Lord may you heal her in the name of Jesus Christ and prays a simple prayer and he says amen and all sin that mom and dad look at each other yeah oh praise the Lord our daughters healed and that nurse couldn't stand it that nurse came over says sir what hold up here I don't think you understand we've never seen a case this bag before and I'm kind of she's upset right because she feels like some preachers giving this a couple false hope and this young nurse goes sir you don't understand we've never had a case this bad your daughter's going to die shortly and that that husband that father-like figure looked down at the young nurse and said sweetie that's all right you know you're you're trained to do what you're doing you're trained to look at the instruments you're trained to look at the circumstance and by your calculations now that's what it looks like to you buts but we're looking at a promise of God see we're not looking at what the world's looking at we're looking at a divine promise of God hallelujah and that's what we're standing upon is the Word of God and so as we start to take the promised land and we start to possess inheritance we want to understand that we're standing the prom the promise word of God we're not looking out of the circumstances the prophesied God when God comes into a person or two persons into a congregation to a man or woman he vindicates his presence God proves he's there for when God comes supernatural signs begin to appear this person becomes change purse they're not no more like they used to be sent as vanished from their life fear and doubt as Venice frustrations they are solid stable live or die its Christ they don't care what comes or what goes nothing shake ins they move forward hallelujah I want to go on with God I want to move forward into all of his promises oh God or whatever would hinder me or keep me back Lord Jesus help me and give me grace to make it one more day and as we'll just kind of try to end going in this direction here for a moment everybody all right let's turn in our Bibles to Ephesians let's all stand up it's been a for service for service weekend change your position for a little bit helps at least they helps me I don't want to weary you no minister battles behind the pulpit you know that and y'all are the ones that operate the gift so if you want me to quit stop saying Amen oh where where we just want you to be comfortable so we'll just read this while you're standing Ephesians one will be reverse three to five this will be our fifth service blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen you may be seated hallelujah the prophet of God says all let's stop just one minute here in heavenly places now just not out anywhere but in heavenly places we are assembled in heavenly it means that the position of the believer that if I'm prayed up you're prayed up the church is prayed up and we're ready for the message and we have assembled ourselves together as Saints call out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessings called elected set together in heavenly places now we are heavenlies in our souls our spirits has brought us into a heavenly atmosphere Oh glory there you are a heavenly atmosphere Oh what could happen tonight it's not too late as a church what could happen tonight what could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in a heavenly atmosphere and the Holy Spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Jesus Christ all sins under the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to God and our hearts lifted sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus worshiping together in heavenly places Wow did you ever sit in one I've sat till I would weep for joy and say God never let me leave here just heavenly places in Christ Oh in heavenly places not just out anywhere but if you've ever come into a heavenly atmosphere you've ever come into the presence of the Shekinah glory oh my where he just comes and he reveals himself to you in such a special way and you feel like you've just stepped into eternity well there's nothing like it you say Oh Lord just let me live here forever because in that presence you have need of nothing all you feel it's so wonderful it's so precious and there's something about a believer that we want along to be in that kind of atmosphere the Prophet said if you've ever been in the heavenly atmosphere one time you will never be happy anywhere else your motive your thoughts will be to stay there and as we read here in Ephesians you know the book of Ephesians typed with a Joshua what it's doing it's moving us forward it's positionally placing us and that's what we want to do as we realize the call of God upon our life and that we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost now we want the Spirit of Christ to positionally place us in the promised land and we know there's a there's three types of that justification sanctification Holy Ghost Israel coming out of Egypt following through the wilderness under the pillar of fire and the atonement of the sacrificial lamb and then entering into the promised land which is the Holy Ghost the Prophet said now what is the land of promise to the New Testament believer the promise is the Holy Ghost for shall come to pass in the last days Joel 2:28 that I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy upon my handmaids in my maid service will I pour out of my spirit and they shall prophesy I'll show wonders in heaven above and in earth and pillars of fire and smoke and vapor and Peter said on the day of Pentecost after taking his text and preaching repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission to remit to forgive to take away all bat trespasses did you notice Joshua before crossing cross Jordan Joshua said go through the midst of the camp and clean your clothes and sanctify every one of you let no man come to his wife or within three days you'll see the glory of God see the problem is that it was a process of getting ready to inherit the promise a process the process is a series of actions or steps that are taken to achieve a particular result so we want to recognize that that's what the Spirit of Christ is doing in your life it's taking you through a process he says before we cross over Joshua said sanctify yourself and brother Brandon said sanctify means to separate for the glory of God oh my that's a responsibility that's the challenge where we have the world so quick at our four tips everything's right in our face everything's so fast an instant gratification and we live in a world of technology and it's so hard with education and cellphones and computers and billboards and TVs and monitors and my it's just so easy for for everything to flash before your face but you know we need to sanctify ourselves for the glory of God and one thing you know sanctify means to consecrate sanctify prepare to separate and I realize you know that the scripture when it talks about this it says you know we're sanctified for a purpose Church and in verse 5 it says that we've been predestinated unto adoption but you know in this process we talk about justification sanctification on to the Holy Ghost sanctification isn't like a checklist that I did that years ago that is something we must do every single day we must sanctify our lives for the glory of God if we want that holy spirit to have preeminence in our lives we have to set time aside for prayer we have to set time aside for His Word and we have to sanctify this vessel for the glory of God and it's for a purpose and we've been called for a purpose we were predestinated unto adoption hallelujah that's what the Holy Spirit the tutor has been given to you for it's the lead you and guide you in all truth and righteousness and bring you on to adoption Amen so we want to go all the way we just don't want to stop at the entrance we don't want to get to the store where we're going to buy groceries and just walk in and stop right there but we want to go in and get what we have need of Amen hallelujah the Prophet said God's Word under the right atmosphere will produce exactly what it says that will do it's got to be the right atmosphere though you can't lay it over in some seminary or some Bible School and that don't believe in signs and wonders it'll never break and bring life there the atmosphere is wrong but you go to put it in the right atmosphere what kind of an atmosphere a surrendered atmosphere stay there until it does go to grow and and take in life that's the idea that's what we want to do church we want to live in a surrendered atmosphere a sanctified life surrendering to the will of God like Paul said I die daily we want to sanctify ourselves and dedicate everything to him dedicate your finance dedicate your relationships dedicate your job I dedicate the church dedicate your car dedicates your clothes dedicate your food dedicate your actions dedicate everything sanctify everything for the glory of God and I want to try to end here just to show each one of us we have a part to play for the scripture says in 1st Corinthians 12:13 that for by one spirit were all baptized into one body we're part of a family we need one another we can't make it without you when one member suffers we all suffer don't you realize that we can't make it without you we need you each one of us doing our part fit together that's a healthy body living in the heavenly atmosphere with the spiritual blessings in our midst and so we know that Canaan represents the age of the overcomer and that's what we've been called to be as overcomers what is an overcomer and what is overcoming it's recognizing the devil in its tactics that's how you overcome a man and just winding things down Paul says all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but not all things edify so as you receive the Holy Spirit in your life and cry starts to move in your life Paul says when I when I was a child I spake like a child but when I became a man I put away childish things so we want to start growing and maturing in our walk with Jesus Christ forsaking the things that we used to do and we want to go all with God that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's for a purpose it's teaching you how to do battle oh my nobody can battle like our Lord Oh who is this Lord of glory it's the Lord God I did battle who is the Lord I'm gonna lift you up all you everlasting hates hallelujah he's 90 in battle and what he's wanting to do with you spirit it was a spirit he's wanting to teach you how to overcome and he showed us in the word how to overcome what did he say when the devil came and tried to tempt to them it is written it is written it is written I'll just put that word on your lips and what did the promise a if you put that one on your lips it's deity speaking hallelujah we spoke about how the children of Israel crossed over and they're that big first tester coming to the promised land was Jericho those big walls but all they had to do is stay with the word that's all you have to do is stay with the word can I have about 10 more minutes hallelujah prophet says by one spirit we're all baptized into one body which is the body of Christ and in that body is nine spiritual gifts operating through the local body local church I believe in the spiritual gifts I believe in the nine spiritual gifts look I want all that he has for me every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line I spiritual gifts what we want to do is we want to sanctify ourselves living in a heavenly and fear in a surrendered atmosphere where these gifts of the Holy Spirit can operate in our life oh my you know here too many people preaching on allowing the fruits of the spirit and the nine spiritual gifts operating in our church oh my are we scared of what somebody's gonna think are we scared of what the other churches are gonna say oh no sir if it's in the Word of God I'm on it nine spiritual gifts what's your gift maybe it's one of them but I don't know anything Lord if you got something in your word for me I want it and if I can say to my find myself in such a way and get away from all the nonsense out there to live in a surrendered heavenly atmosphere oh god if you see fit to break upon me with the Holy Ghost in any way you please lord I will then you become a living sacrifice or however you want to use me Paul said in Romans 12 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service we could read in 1st Corinthians well we just read it 1st Corinthians 12:4 we'll move fast now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are difference of administration's but the same Lord and our diversities of operations but it's the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal to every one of us there's a measure for you 4 to 1 is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one self same spirit dividing to every and severally as he will for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that body being many are one body so also is Christ each one of us are fit enjoying together and this is where I just want to end right here the promise that God never intended the church to be run by man God runs his church and he runs it through gifts of the Spirit the gifts of the Spirit is in the church to correct the spirit he's got five ministerial offices in his church first of them as apostles or missionaries missionary is the highest calling there is apostle the word missionary means one sent apostle means one said why they ever chose to call it missionary I don't know but they are apostles all right apostles prophet teachers evangelists pastors now that's the elected offices of God to his church now listen close then in each local church whoa we pulled it off on some other Church we guest say they got a little a week out a little no sir then in each local church are y'all with me there god this might not be a bunch of screaming to shine but this is necessary if we receive the Holy Ghost in her life the Spirit of God is moving their lives that we want to manifest the fruits of the spirit then in each local church there's nine spiritual gifts that come among the people that is knowledge wisdom gifts of healing working of miracles speaking with tongues interpretations of tongues and all these things go in each local body now listen here take this to heart and every person in the church has an individual ministry I want to leave you with that every person in this church has an individual ministry but there's no big eyes or little use in the kingdom of God now watch this now whether you know it or not you have ministry it's not my words right brother I didn't say it I'll read it again to the prophet and every person in the church has an individual ministry and that individual ministry that means you you your ministry that individual ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Jesus Christ oh my you see how important you are it's your life and your testimony that God uses to edify the body we'll just invite the musicians to come this is the will of God for this church this is the will of God for your life hallelujah Lord amen you can play something softly brothers Ephesians 1 says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints sanctified ones which are at Ephesus into the faithful in Christ Jesus we have been called out church we're separated we've been baptized with the Holy Ghost and were in Christ Jesus grace be to you and peace from God our Father from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ not just some to the Apostles this is out of adoption not just some to the apostles and some to this but he's blessed us with all spiritual blessings the same Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost here tonight the same Holy Ghost that made merry shout and speak with tongues and have a wonderful time rejoicing and things that she did is the same Holy Ghost here tonight the same Holy Ghost know that Paul and that old ship where it looked like it was waterlogged it was gone 14 days and nights no moon and stars he looked out there and every wave had every devil on it dancing and gleaming his Tina said I'll sink you opal I got you now oh that's what you felt like this whole time you felt like The Devil's coming to get you blow after blow after blow up get you I'll sink you while Paul went down to have a little prayer [Music] there's stirred the angel God is speaking to you tonight Esther the angel said I'll just stand

here he come with them chains on his little arms dragging them on his feet and said be of good courage men for the God the angel of God who serve it I am she stood by me and said Paul don't fear that

grace Lord I realize I've looked at my own faults and failures enough I've attributed that to your not being able but I realize now Lord I just surrender it all at your feet Lord and I allow the word
