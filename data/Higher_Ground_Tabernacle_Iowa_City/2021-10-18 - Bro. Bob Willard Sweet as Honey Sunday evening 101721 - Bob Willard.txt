today oh oh right now [Applause] in my heart [Music] oh [Music] i don't see how anybody could walk through those doors [Music] is praise the lord roger oh brother sister this is the greatest favor [Music] that is to make the presence of god welcome brother branham said many of the [Music] [Music] because he packs with him the dirty name of holy roller basker as we spoke on this morning [Music] [Music] baptism of the holy ghost it brings life brothers says why we're here tonight is to draw life from him draw closer to him as we spoke here friday night concerning getting in the spirit certainly you have done that here this evening [Music] oh but what a feeling it is to be in the presence of almighty god it's amazing how satan can bring his symptoms [Music] we were made for the presence of almighty god brother that's what i live for is his presence and that spirit of truth [Music] that god placed in you recognize what christ did for us at california and the reason he did that was so that the very life that lived in him you could come back been hidden through the ages now made known to the gentiles which is christ in you in you the hope of glory desperately brother adam said when that little that soul that gene of god is illuminated by the holy ghost it controls you control [Music] the bible says that he desires those sir that will worship him in both spirits [Music] [Music] and the bible says that he seeketh such kills to realize that you and i here this afternoon that we can actually be somebody [Music] seeks you out sure [Music] it is [Music] with all the efforts that the enemy made [Music] i took that word and punched it into the table in the message to see what brother branham said about assembling brother what stood out to [Music] and addressed the audience the congregation how many times in his prayer he thanked god he said i thank you lord i thank you god [Music] [Music] in israel it wasn't his adoption that made him faithful it was his faithfulness that set him aside for [Music] to our service to god [Music] i want to thank our pastor brother brooks [Music] if you're ever in arizona on arizona we want to invite you to come if you're ever in phoenix area in fact we're going to have your pastor i'm trusting he'll sing and play his tambourine for us too i've i would like to read here out of revelations chapter 10. and i'm going to read starting here well we'll start with verse 8. all of us are very familiar here with revelations 10 1-7 certainly is the keynote chapter in our bible the keynote here of our day and its message days are the voice of the seventh angel brother branham said that john the apostle john in the vision that this book was given to him that in this vision he represented the bride of christ he was given this book by an angel brother said it was as though in the vision that john was transmitted off patmos into our day angel and brother bannon pointed out it was a prophet john was transmitted into our day received this message i believe from the same angel you and i received it from israel brother branham said that john had a revelation but did not understand it it's what he said because the history of it wasn't made yet and brother that lack of understanding was displayed by john is a monk because more than once in your bible john tried to worship the angel that showed him this book john knew better than to be an idolater john jesus rested on his bosom for three and a half years john being transmitted into our day receiving this message he thought the angel that give it to him what did the angel tell him john jean see that you do it not the paper because i'm of thy fellow servants you've been transmitted into my day to get this revelation it wouldn't be till our day that this angel would get it christ gave it to him christ took the book out of the original owner's hands in 1963 chris sent it to the earth angel don't give it to you god man they asked him questions and answers i've still got you all standing you don't cause me to forget my church manners they asked him brother branham some say you're the son of man this is he's son of god son of abraham son of david's son of man he's the jew if he's the lone pista but notice your bible he says the llama he addressed the second portion of the question he said when she said i thought the pillar of fire was the sun the dollar fires jesus christ is you've got the glorified son of god you've got christ himself not a second person of a trinity but you know god himself spirit form on from this he wore a mask in our praise the lord this is your fault you could have just been all starchy and stiff so i wouldn't feel like this and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the scene upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book that's exciting for me and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet and i took the little book out of the angel's hands let's pray father that we could lord in our age recognize its day and its message heavenly father we ask your divine favor just that you would speak to your children this morning this evening in the powers lord and demonstration that the word of god and a humble heart will produce we commit ourselves this lovely group of your redeemers into thine hands to the glories of god in the name of jesus christ god's people said amen now you can be seated now i want to let you know up front that if something stirs your heart see i could go and you shout amen will not bother me i'll just take that as a sign when you all get quiet i'll pull over we'll see how this works out tonight praise the lord brother branham said revelation biblically [Music] that the honey coming into the honeycomb lumiere talking about the church being a buzz it don't sit in sect so i want to speak a little bit tonight about honey dumb some at some point sometimes they have uh sayings about the bee like busy as a bee yeah because bees are not slothful these are not lazy these are bathing sun in fact bees lizabe work themselves to death rather to be a strain on the hive rather there yeah to be a strain on the hive they will just not come back they'll just pass because they want to [Music] live for the other bee vivre it's made inside of the bees honey is made a fabric by the bee ingesting two things and also it drinks the nectar you'll see what the nectar which is the life of the flower the type of the word it must be word and spirit mechanics and dynamics the result of nectar and and pollen b honey is the only food source known to man will not grow bacteria crystallized in the pharaoh tombs of egypt 4 000 years old they heat it up you don't eat it and it's still edible it's a type of revelation it's gold in color see speaking of dears and it's so sweet everything loves honey everything loves honey you'll take a bear out in the woods he comes across fresh honey he doesn't care how many times he gets stung honey is worth it it's worth every trial it's oh it's worth it when we're tired it's worth it when we don't feel good we come to the house of god to receive revelations now the foundation of the hives is the wax comb see wax uh honeycomb uh see jimmy now the wax is actually made by the bee the what if you're a germatized born [Music] the wax comes out of the bee's body the whites saw in small little plates platelets and then the bee shapes it's shaped into a seven part cell or chamber fabric don't form the city has a foundation [Music] she and one of her eggs is enough and puts them together so all the bees that you see working in the flowers buzzing around the hives every one of those bees is female queen this is a bay if it means because the germantized egg produces a female bee lefties the unfertilized is made up of female bees [Music] brother she's a type of the bride now the reason she's female she has received the male germs and they all work for the common health and reproduction of the hives holds brood uh the that's the young the next generation generation and they store honey in it pollen and honey the brother that's what the church of the living god should be doing this where we come to be fed and see the next generation born again that's why they're so protective their [Music] [Music] and brother sister there's three stages the egg goes through this is right out of science egg larva those are there's three stages justification from the sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and there's bees that specifically look after the brood specifically in the hive because the queen and order reproduce has to be kept at a certain temperature no matter how hot it is generate heat [Applause] brother i'm gonna let you in on a little something i haven't got to it yet these are pentecostals i'm going to prove it to you in a minute they're pentecostals so once that egg decreases it develops through those stages brother sister it's still earthbound so what they do when look and what takes place in that little chamber creation takes place and this is what it does just like john did in the book of revelation don't leave the apocalypse in the vision when the little bee is changed and it's grown its wings it hasn't flown yet nabanko couldn't because it had no wings brother under that seal it's given wings it eats the seal just like a little a chick a pep peeps itself out of the egg the little bee eats the seal he's like john ate the bomb bonjour i'm not making this this is god in his creation brother these bees have more revelation than some message folks where they eat this book feast on it this is the bread of life and then it's taught to fly it takes flying lessons it must humble itself and it's the custodian of so with its flying lessons there is a b now this is my favorite b it's called the scout b scout b scout b okay uh you've got one sitting right there you've got a a scout being named brother brooks scout be uplifted what the scout b does this is amazing it's scout b the scout bee leaves the hive and it can fly as far as five miles without a road map and because it's got the common gene within the hive with a gps gps it can find its way back no is looking for good nectar and pollen because when it comes back it's not going to preach a word-only message it's going to let the bees that are listening what it found it wasn't going to leave the nectar in the pollen just for itself it's going to share the pastor said i'm doing okay what draws if you don't know whether it's a vegetable or whether it's a tree or something in order for brother in fact bees are responsible for the pollination of our fruits and vegetables without bees we would be extinct as human beings because bees fertilize our plants and our vegetables our fruits that's why the plant knows that it cannot reproduce itself without the bees that's why it puts its flower out and the flower has color it's not trying to attract you and me no it couldn't care less we're going to eat what it produces but in order for it to produce it needs to be eaten put the flour it was such a wonderful just time i had and and our dear sister cooked us a wonderful meal but i noticed that she had a little candle on the table and had the little candle going it gave off such a nice my wife does that my family has a candles it was and the flower knows oh brother i've known this a long time brother it's so perfect our god is so personal brother don't fear the devil don't fear his circumstances god knows who you are he predestinated you or the foundations of the world and there's nothing the devil can thank the father father thank you for those ones the b is born this way the flying bee if you've ever looked close it causes an electromagnetic transition electricity and when the bee hits the flower he saw the flower he's coated in pollen i've seen him the bee will be yellow this is coated in pollen but he's got to fly back maybe miles you see those two little yellow pods on his legs when they get loaded down they can't fly very fast because they're bearing a burden and god made sure that the baskets were on both sides paul taught timothy to rightly divide he said study the word that you can be a workman not to be ashamed but rightly dividing the word of god brother you can't just take part of the message you've got to take all of the messages from genesis to revelation so once he balances those baskets that congregation gathers around the scouts and what the scout does next it's dangerous see don't see the scout be dancing they call it the honey dance i've watched it it's either in a figure eight [Music] the scout the school only delivers his instructions through the dance the delivery and it's delivered in real time the same instructions given through that dance at noon don't work at four o'clock well no oh is to point the bees [Music] the instructions are triangulated instructions the instructions these instructions are based on where the hive is issue giving the instructions in relation to the position of the sun at that moment and where the flower is that he got the pollen from [Music] tasting brother that's why we've got these quotes so we can tell you where we got our pollen the instructions are for you didn't know but they've been able to finally interpret this realizing that the dance is done in correlation to the sun's position the bees that are really [Laughter] the whole group becomes pentecostals brother they get the same nectar and the same pollen for themselves rather the holy ghost isn't just for the pulpit it's for whosoever will come okay i'm gonna stop on that for a moment in this message he says take a trip with me he says i'm going to take you back before god was god because god isn't the word means object of worship before there was any space any planets there was god dwelling alone with his attributes his thoughts is invisible says in the beginning there could be nothing new for god thought-wise [Music] and the word so right there brother banham says in this message now he says he says take this journey he said it was just god this great supernatural being who covered all space and all places at all times he was from everlasting to everlasting that's all there was he says now what is that sequel it's called by bible readers logos the anointing he says god gave himself birth brother every time i read that every time i say that now you can only think about that for so long as you like it created so existing for eternity at a point in his existence create his own presence there's your beginning now here's what he says next brother this is powerful equity he says now when this little halo comes he said he did it so he could begin to put himself in a position that you and i could begin to understand ultimately he wanted fellowship because we are spirit sons and daughters of god he defeated those of you that are possessed with a portion of this angelic being that resisted the devil's lie in heaven in genesis 2 was formed from the dust of the earth here's what he says now this is even before he created you and i that's the avocado we were just in thought formula but just by the eyes just supernatural we see a halo standing there now i can see him playing steps in and feels his own presence oh manifestation for the first time and the very first thing he does he plays he plays listen to this this brother this is what opened my eyes why god took such a hard stand against those that made fun of that church at pentecost in the spirit don't sit on this plane brother because that wasn't them doing it that was all my brother that was that logos this presence that came into that room they started acting foolish look at this look at this you see he said he gave birth to himself and i can see him playing around like a little child before his father's door call me um god reacted to his own presence as think about it i looked the word up in the webster dictionary the word means to frolic the more significant it means merriment it means joy means dancing don't see to frolic is to dance of that father on the day of pentecost when that holy ghost came into that room broke himself up went on them and in there just like their father [Applause] adultery blasphemy he said how did the jews cut themselves off how did the jews cut themselves remember on the day of pentecost when that 120. acting like a bunch of drunks as you can come staggering out of that upper room that peter got himself out of the gutter because they were mocking and making peter said these are not drunk like you think you didn't deny they weren't drunk they're not drunk like you think they're drunk on the new wine they saw peter took them right back to the word to them that this was prophecy coming to pass this is that which the prophet joel spoke in the last jesus i'll pour out my spirit brother i'm in the last days and i want his spirit and i don't want to be ashamed or afraid how i'm gonna act you said by making how much that means to him oh hallelujah aren't you thankful tonight for the word of god oh brother there's nothing to be afraid of i don't care what the devil tells you brother sure there's all kind of false but that has nothing to do with me okay i know i'm supposed to pull over five o'clock i don't know how long i've been i know i'll pay for it tomorrow glory to god i grew up i'm old i'm 64 years old born in 1957. in the 50s like your dear pastor because he looks younger than i do basketball but i grew up my dad was an old arkansas farm boy we always i can remember had a garden we're okay all right god bless you thank you lord so dad had a garden farm and i was very inexpensive labor um i grew up with a shovel in my hand we would prepare the garden [Music] and then god my dear dad would hand me i never forget as a little guy onion bulbs and i liked onion balls because of their shape you knew where the top was so i was told how far apart so i'd plant that row and put those onion bulbs press them into the dirt that worried me because the corn had no top top i was so concerned because the last thing i wanted was to plant those seeds upside down and all the corn grew down and not up on this you can tell it wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer praise the lord he was teaching me the bible didn't even know it well sure enough he would water the garden my dad was never worried about the weeds the thought of weeds did not keep him from sowing the seed of the vegetables he wanted i'm worried that we won't have enough weeds he knew they would be there because the same water that watered the seeds watered the weeds water the holy ghost waters the just and the unjust but brother i'm amazed people are so worried about somebody shouting and dancing and backsliding [Music] if you've got the down brother the weeds came he wouldn't even let me pull them up right away they were close to the road because you might uproot you shall know there's plenty for everybody but let's make sure that we're not a terror except the word of god and no substitute god bless you thank you [Applause] if we could stand and i promise to get out of the way we'll have your dear pastor to come up as a musician would you play something just softly for us tonight thank you so much god bless you sir but i would like us for just a moment if we could just take this time if we could close our eyes and family bow our heads for just a moment [Music] our dear brother would just play something softly i know i know god has spoken to [Music] and is there any here tonight [Music] [Music] brother sister i i know it's hard to believe but i was a young person when god called me to this message just a center boy [Music] i'm [Music] that as long as god is calling this promises to you your children those that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall come [Music] dear heavenly father these tender-hearted see man young hands raised up into the air on there and lord we know that it's not the uplifted hand it's just the result and lord these that are so desiring this experience of experience we ask your divine favor tonight you would bring it to pass lord in their lives lord whatever it takes lord if there's something laying there that would hinder this maybe there's a need lord for a sanctification maybe there's something [Music] [Music] with your divine [Music] but we ask this divine favor in the name [Music] praise the lord just to get it to prayer [Music] we worship you [Music] we worship you [Music] we oh [Music] i we wish
