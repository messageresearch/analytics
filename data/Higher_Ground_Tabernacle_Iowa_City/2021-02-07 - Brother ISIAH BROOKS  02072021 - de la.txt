his grace and his mercy and we appreciate you being here this morning on such a cold day very cold and we're going to do our best here this morning appreciate our brother merle he was going to he was going to step in for me but i didn't know what was going to happen here this morning with the way the weather was going yesterday and they said it was going to continue the snow was going to continue but uh last night the lord wouldn't let me rest man so i called our precious deacon back there called him lately and i said i i'll be down by god's word but just have brother mural for the one more song ancient ancient greece there is power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb oh yes this power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] of the land would you be free would you be free from your burdens of sin there is [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] is [Music] oh that's one of my favorite songs because i realized because he's good it was now as we stand we'll get right into it ah you love the lord this morning is there anybody who sent you also about them we're going to come from philippians 2. then revelations 10. we started on a message in des moines last week preparing for war so prepared and uh i'm going to uh preach the second portion of this country there's a party and we're going to read the fifth in the sixth verse let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus christ who being in the form of god look how exists don't form the jews thought it not robbery to be equal with god now we'll go to revelations 10. no i already and then we'll read down to the seventh verse the verse and i saw another mighty angel come down from the his face was as it were the sun in his feet as pillar of fire and he had in his hand a little book opened roared and when he had cried seven thunders ordered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voice and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and swear by that excuse me and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are the shows that there should be time no longer as he hath declared of his servants coming out he has himself let us pray father god we come before you this morning and we thank you for your grace do you three leading me and set the captive free a um they leave holy in jesus christ's name we pray that jesus christ amen amen he may be seated i so thank you thank god for this message we know by god's grace salvation had not god sent us a prophecy we would be just as the world is your honest used to come to monday i think sometimes we forget and we must realize this this evening or this morning that is god's grace that's going to carry it out we are in the most difficult times pretty a time when we can now see the manifestations of the fifth and sixth i don't know political wars and cannot declare that it is the truth he is truly blind for right now we see the unfolding that god has given to his bride could you have done something it's unfolding as well amen amen what we need to see this evening [Music] but this is not the mind i believe god is working with me with the mind hallelujah when the messenger came called the message he declared himself to be a man born out of season born out of caesar [Music] and he came amen with a message he lived very newt have that come inside uh most of the pentecostals can i prepare the political team could not see or understand but this message was for a [Music] that god is a god of contrast it's you and you and your divine hallelujah so god just in his mind had to bring his final he development message to the gentiles at a time when the age would be at its best [Music] god he still was going to bring forth life hallelujah he not only played eleazar [Music] to hold the joshua hallelujah and he also played the part of jesus he now sees joey hold there's his new priest now we realized this morning that this man william brown was [Music] he took a nobody and he made him somebody you know hallelujah now the world didn't like him no no no nothing but he came into the world whatever they did in the green tree circuit do you have if you don't they're going to do it in the drive it feels don't hear what i'm saying in other words how they treated jesus how are they going to treat the christians hallelujah people may think we're crazy [Music] to know that i'm not of this [Music] this world is [Music] my second portion of this message would be entitled so i uh the person the person of the logos hallelujah because you must realize that god is a spirit could you eternally spread hallelujah amen and the bible has declared and abide that no man have seen him at any time hallelujah amen but in john 10 30. but don't make the only booty jesus to all the pharisees [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that that was not just for william brown william you understand me he was the first fruit hallelujah that was waved over the bride so that she could see spock in his autopsy her destiny somebody help me here he was the first fruit but we must understand that he was just an example what [Music] [Music] i said i don't know about you this morning [Music] hallelujah i was in the mind of god of god [Music] the prophet god says it like this perfect dude in his thoughts don't sap on him he was a father but you cannot be a father without having children songs that brought his own form hallelujah [Music] there's a light that came out of god the company it was not the light that was gone he was clothed in light it was the spirit of god in there and the logos begin to dance and the logos i don't sing brother madam said father prophet that when jesus as the lord god calls israel create things also danced why he did it every time something would come when you see a man or woman anointed hallelujah hallelujah what we've come to see secret news of you is that when god used the prophet of god i truly said the prophet to you it was absolutely not only the presence of god away from [Music] because remember when yeah he said well what do you mean brother don't you know that adam luke i don't was essential y'all know what he said essential it's not it he was he was he was a part of god that was needed you know how they do it all day is the lord [Music] because the bible tells us that this god that was so far away don't say and now it is [Music] put on the whole arm of god how many of us know what the whole arm of god is i used to think that somehow i'm gonna i to make sure i got a helmet [Music] i've got to make sure i have a uh i mean a shield of faith different japan secrecy indifferent of the armor the difference but i came to know me the armor is one piece it used to work and paul put it in simplicity and paul likes because that's something he said put on christ what god had in store for us he tried to make us see he said that we did not come to be just church members we are a new [Music] all sometimes we think that christ is different from elohim hello hello and you know why we somehow think that hey papa we've seen the pentecostal movement really move on the point and the pentecostal movement because they would not move on with malachi 4. they they have done more harm to the gospel of christ than good he's on joseph he's only tweeted hallelujah if there is such a thing of evolution see the evolution hallelujah then the bride of jesus christ is evolving [Applause] spiritual man hallelujah is that right and this is what corinthians 15 says the secular book yes we bore the image of the earth we shall also build the image of the heavens understand what i'm saying when you see my face that is earthly long but the main inside melon hallelujah is heavily somebody help me here so that you understand what we were yesterday yeah cannot remain hallelujah what's the true baptism of the holy ghost into a man don't you know she's no longer the same son hallelujah she had put on christ and now she's a heavenly being when you come into christ you do not remain in the dimensions [Music] [Music] changes but now amen that you and i have been born again somebody helped me here the bible says that hebrews we are now sitting in heavenly places [Applause] once [Music] and she met the king and i'm gonna tell you what somebody help me she had a personal relationship with him personally she changed position everything about the old esther who's here somebody help me here ain't coming so you must understand this message came to change hallelujah if you can if this message can cannot change you cannot be changed [Music] here i'm going to say it again this message cannot change [Music] hallelujah and there's no way yeah [Music] [Applause] you just to stay in the presence of this woman stay in the presence of the anointing god will change it's yours hallelujah you cannot change yourself god [Music] [Music] [Applause] he shapes [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh we only just begun oh no no [Music] on food how the world disbelieved his word cannot come back voice preparation how many of y'all got the holy ghost how many come here you know brother the devil is nothing here is that right that's good because remember that's the happiness talks about this brother the point of gnome who had a battle with the devil kevin batter and the devil came and said boo hello boo hallelujah hallelujah and the brother realized the more the devil said boo okay the priest yeah the smaller he got it oh [Music] satan don't want you look yeah oh come on come on you can do better than that just sweet ride i'm jesus christ this is your kiss one more time the bride the booze of jesus christ hallelujah amen amen so the devil tries to keep you free the holy ghost he says hallelujah [Music] we don't believe that like the baptists are calmly because you cannot make a rapture without it your pressure sent this [Music] [Music] bolted down right there hallelujah and we're waiting for the great magnet i don't know about you and you should just wait for once i thought [Music] the church world le mans this is gone a revival did y'all know that that's good and they're they're you know i think what was the man is your business he's supposed to be a prophet himself tell us about brother branham and how brother brown said there was going to come a revival [Music] is that right and brother branham did say this those organizations oh jesus christ jesus but the prophet of god to me their revival okay lord they'll lead them to the mark of the beast you see what i'm saying who is the same anointing because you'll the [Music] [Music] you're sweet omnipotent when satan comes at you that's your buddha i am oh nip cause you're sweet that means i've got all power now he's talking about two or three holy ghost field people now he pounded the dude and killed them two or three or four of us in here and because we don't have the holy ghost [Music] he said when two omnipotents meet he said omnipotence and he goes on [Music] [Music] to hallelujah something's got to shake your shoes whatever you say creative power [Music] hallelujah but the holy ghost didn't stop getting pulled out when the prophet left on the scene the holy ghost is still being [Music] okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] it is his word don't stop at all it creates a power sake that goes out yonder keep voting things to pass the shows that is not the show's king song let me say it again this shows that is not so bad it makes them you look fit as though they are either allah may not exist because that's good hallelujah and he goes on this is what caught me hey there he [Music] has come together [Music] and then the bible says according to paul b reginald [Music] so if god will not share his glory see june if i popped up i think your man no evidently you must be a part of god oh come on somebody even in the book of revelations the bible says that the bride comes down yes amen what unbelief can't stop you like could you attend god has promised that's the big key to the whole thing it sounds like going to like going through yeah i don't have that quote but i got it because your goodness it is the mercy and grace of god destination [Music] battle [Music] manifested on the earth manifested [Music] there fainted not no no no no no dude neither is weary ooh no no no not by the the the compliment just the complaint there is no searching of his understanding [Music] if you like sorry about that i'm sorry you love the lord was that me to send you help i'm trying to encourage us this morning we have all these battles every day and the great your greatest enemy is you evolve my my greatest enemy is me montprix i battle with him every day when i wake up oh isaiah is still there and he's always trying to get me not to do hey hallelujah but he fails to understand me you and i have a power that's interesting no the very thing god spoke into existence why is this so important because the devil always fights pascal diablo if thou be the christ see jesus think about it now with all the miraculous things jesus did i do do the miracle because you have the devil still came think about it when [Music] [Music] [Music] but you must realize his righteousness [Music] is all that you try to do chapter yes he giveth power to the faint you don't do that false that's your weak once again and to them that have no might look more slightly girl strength now but no i just gave you a gospel if you're feeling faint hallelujah he gives do power is that all right yes you say yeah and to them that have no might a pulse he said god increases your strength is that okay that's what you see now i'm going to say these things because i want you to understand that because you would not be passionate only because you've asked because when you ask in faith move god hallelujah yes lord we send you out even the youth shall faint and the young men shall utterly fall it is that dude wait a minute go ahead brother i'm sorry okay okay just think about it i'm not going to be happy but the bible tells us that even the youth shall faint and be you said in your house you set in your house almost ready to lose your mind can't go nowhere can't do nothing fair hallelujah and then you're afraid to socialize yeah that is i i'll let you make this cause you don't want to catch the covey hallelujah it's just so many things you go to a department store who's that little store or grocery store who's that it doesn't uh grow so happens you don't have your mask somebody coughs deuce y'all know what i'm talking about i'm saving the question i've had it happen to me and the first thing you say oh lord protect me you don't even think about somebody really having a cold anymore where's the flu what happened to the floor hallelujah then disappeared on us and the devil just got us in such a airport [Music] the bible says many of the afflictions of the righteous [Music] he even said that some of the young men will follow me but they that wait man upon the lord who said and you shall renew their strength where are you going to go who excuse me are you going to go who excuse me this message is the only message hallelujah hallelujah you wait upon [Music] this is not this is our day this is our time that god wants to prove something to us and so he tries and he tests you he will test it he was approved every child of god must be tested [Music] you know i was military when i was younger in the air force and you know when you go through your basic training double double training hallelujah yo sergeant don't care how tired you what is it he looks at you you boy and he pushes you if you push to get the maximum out of you well if they said that remax hallelujah is that right that's because that's what your trials do it's a sick of all voices pushes you to get the maximum out of you maximum is that right now you think about brother branham when he made a mistake and wouldn't go down now to those pentecostal people hallelujah hallelujah god brought a flood on the city where many people died [Music] [Music] i believe david must have felt the same [Music] we just i don't know how god put up with us [Music] everything is working by his power and we get a little bill dude financially the problem financially and we want to faint this new new dumbo y'all hear what i'm saying is who comes with instagram she gets so disturbed compliment we let the least little thing the little things on the pretty shows steal our joy fully only because it's used to echo we forget who he is [Music] [Music] living so oh my god so let me hurry [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah every one of my childhood diseases dude that you can show you don't mind god heal me what i'm saying every one of those germs [Music] but he needs somebody to believe [Music] [Music] because the word of god you see the devil don't want us to be in the spirit of the background in the spirit god in spite it could do and speed hallelujah you love the lord it's immediately coming to this geneva because the scripture says in isaiah 66. god says the lord where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest for all those things shows have my hand made my man these are faiths and all those things have been always with the lord but today this man voice is yours hallelujah even to him yeah everything we give god sometimes we think we're giving god something hallelujah what he made would you donate to the circuit but there's one thing you did not make but yeah and that's you that's it god made you jeff who's that fee hello you can say well me and my wife you know we came together and got no one you can why am i farm on everything there's only one life no yeah and god gave that germ life it's your i don't know that's a joke god formed and fashioned you is [Music] [Music] this morning failing thoughts the zombies man says i can't do this you should put back there you know this is too hard it's impossible because you're fast [Music] hallelujah now most of i don't know how all you got most of you got got here from congo [Music] if i can't finish all this but let me say it [Music] [Music] you tell the devil i don't care nobody's speaking out of this temple but god majority man i think the next time i hope the next time when i come back i want to show by the scripture right now who's that your daily life everyday life is being ordered by god all donate about you and every change in your life god moves you from one place to another [Music] [Music] jesus bringing in the brotherly love and brotherly kindness and then you see the divine love kicking in not only did he forgive his brothers and for 14 years and put him in jacob's tent and i've immediately had those i don't that was his godliness he felt defiled is that right excuse me yeah you did that's why he was mad but he didn't he didn't go at his his father-in-law and beat him up but let me put it this way so you can understand problem says she was ugly and uh you know when the bible said you don't look too good you don't look too good you see that that's my bad that's my bad hallelujah so he's being tested so united prove it his heart was for rachel but god was building characters when you talk about virtue you look throughout the scriptures and then you find out that when jacob why can't jacob come to the place of brotherly kindness he had to forgive uh uh esau esau had to [Music] he had enough godliness in him to know that the righteous cannot dwell in the tent of the unrighteous [Music] and that's something we need to learn can you devote [Music] jesus is that only thing you'll do you can't do it on your own hallelujah every time i think i'm gonna leave earlier you love the lord so was it man who sent you help people we are not then where is it as individuals you got to declare that come individually it has nothing to do with your feelings nothing to do with you nothing to do with your fears he wasn't about the religious people it was a it's a reproach they take on our approach to follow this message in this day people look at you like you're plumb crazy and then they'll say oh you're in a car oh if it is with that don't sound good and
