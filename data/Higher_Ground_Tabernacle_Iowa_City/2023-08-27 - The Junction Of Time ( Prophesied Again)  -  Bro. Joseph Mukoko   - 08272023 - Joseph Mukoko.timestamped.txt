[43:53] I would have heard a lot of clappings
[43:55] right now
[43:56] can we clap our hands for the Lord
[43:59] [Music]
[44:09] for those who don't know me
[45:06] now when we come to church uh
[45:11] we come in the house of our father
[45:14] now you have to relax
[45:19] people come in church with a a brown
[45:22] face
[45:25] [Music]
[45:28] now tell your brother God will do good
[45:30] to you
[45:31] [Music]
[45:42] you never eat with her face
[45:46] every time you eat you're smiling you're
[45:48] happy
[45:49] so when you come to church we want to
[45:53] feed ourselves
[45:55] and so you have to smile and relax I
[45:59] mean can somebody say Amen
[46:03] I
[46:33] also let's open our Bible in the Book of
[46:36] John chapter 11 verse 41.
[46:43] John 11 verse 41.
[46:48] I don't know if uh we got the slides
[46:50] that we can project here
[46:52] okay
[46:57] the Bible says then they took away the
[47:00] stone is
[47:04] and Jesus lifted up his eyes
[47:10] father I thank thee that thou has heard
[47:13] me
[47:15] so when I read my Bible yeah
[47:18] there are a lot of things that uh that
[47:21] that that
[47:23] stand out to me
[47:26] because I'm trying to find out how does
[47:29] God think
[47:31] how was Jesus thinking
[47:34] because when you read this verse
[47:38] he says take away the stone it
[47:42] and then Jesus lifts up his eyes
[47:46] now just try to think Jesus standing
[47:48] there and we saw Jesus lift up his eyes
[47:52] the first reflects is going to be to
[47:55] look up
[47:56] thinking that something's coming up and
[48:00] Jesus said
[48:03] father I thank thee that now has hurt me
[48:06] he has not even started praying yet
[48:10] but he already knew that God has already
[48:13] answered his prayer
[48:15] now that's at that level that's where
[48:17] God is calling him out calling us
[48:20] because there will be situations where
[48:23] you won't have time to pray mention
[48:26] Ed but you have to be certain that God
[48:28] has already entered your prayers
[48:32] if there is a time that you have to be
[48:34] certain what's serious with God it's
[48:36] right now
[48:37] if you know that you don't have God
[48:41] start searching for him now
[48:44] if you know that you're not in line with
[48:47] God
[48:48] start putting start putting your life in
[48:51] order with us
[48:52] because we don't have any time anymore
[48:55] amen can you say Amen
[48:58] now Jesus continues verse 42
[49:01] and he says
[49:05] I know that down here is me always
[49:10] but because of the people which stand by
[49:13] I said it I think
[49:15] foreign
[49:16] that they may believe that thou has sent
[49:19] me
[49:21] so Jesus is trying to make you
[49:23] understand that the problem is not it's
[49:25] not me
[49:26] the problem is the crowd what's only a
[49:28] second uh
[49:30] because I know that you have already
[49:33] heard me
[49:36] but the problem is those people who are
[49:38] not believed
[49:40] so if I spoke it's because of the crown
[49:45] says the crown represents
[49:49] most of the time the problem is us it's
[49:53] never God when you say Amen
[49:58] I'm gonna go to the book of Psalm
[50:01] chapter 82 verses 6 verse 6.
[50:07] the Bible says I sent
[50:15] [Music]
[50:39] is revelation 10 verse 8.
[50:45] and the voice that I heard from Heaven
[50:47] spoke again
[50:53] and take the little book which is open
[50:56] in the end of the Angel
[51:00] which stands upon the sea and upon the
[51:03] Earth let's say a word or God or father
[51:08] thank you amen
[51:27] hello
[51:30] Montana
[51:32] now I would like the title uh the sermon
[51:34] the junction of time no let them the
[51:38] theme
[51:39] the theme of this topic is the function
[51:41] of time the teeth
[51:46] and the title is going to be prophesy
[51:49] again
[51:49] so
[51:50] the junction of time
[51:54] and the title is going to be prophesy
[51:57] again
[52:01] I like to read what the prophet says
[52:05] so just stand with just keep up with me
[52:11] now brother Brian in his sermon a door
[52:14] in the door
[52:19] is very unusual
[52:23] but you know sometimes
[52:26] it's on it's sometimes it's unusual
[52:30] things that God Appears in
[52:35] he says God Appears in the unusual
[52:39] because God is unusual
[52:41] [Music]
[52:43] he does unusual things
[52:47] [Music]
[52:48] he appears at unusual times
[52:52] so I'm going to go down
[52:57] when we get into a usual trend of things
[53:01] we miss God
[53:06] when we try to get into a trend our
[53:09] things we miss God
[53:12] what are the trend of things
[53:15] it's a it's a it's a it's a
[53:28] [Music]
[53:56] [Music]
[54:11] let's expect foreign
[54:34] [Music]
[55:40] so now they were waiting they were
[55:43] asking what was he going to do
[56:18] [Music]
[56:23] in other terms look look at what I'm
[56:26] about to do
[56:27] now this is the part that God loves me
[56:30] Jesus looks at the man and he says
[56:34] he says uh stretch out your hands
[56:37] the question I'm asking myself
[56:42] did Jesus know that that hand was dry or
[56:45] not is
[56:52] now the Bible says uh
[56:56] happy
[57:02] [Music]

[58:13] [Music]

[59:37] that's a quick action
[59:40] we find people
[59:43] he said oh if I was in a meeting
[59:48] but I won't read the search
[59:54] they're healing okay
[59:58] can you say man

[1:05:57] he always manifests his powers that's
[1:06:00] the first thing
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:02] he continues
[1:06:05] in a junction of time
[1:06:09] yes
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:51] [Music]

[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:10:15] he he
[1:10:19] foreign

[1:11:55] [Music]
[1:12:29] if you
[1:12:31] foreign
[1:12:46] to get what you want
[1:12:49] online
[1:12:51] we have we have raised uh Christians
[1:12:56] Christians who are who act like women
[1:12:59] that means you have to give them
[1:13:01] everything
[1:13:02] even Jesus
[1:13:09] who are you for you not to suffer yeah
[1:13:15] I raised my eyes

[1:13:35] you have a bad annoying if you're there
[1:13:39] that means good Devils
[1:13:42] stand up yeah tell the devil
[1:13:46] whether you want it
[1:14:55] he says
[1:15:14] foreign it knew they knews that he's
[1:15:17] going to receive
[1:15:19] and he will go back to his country
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:22] and I'm gonna make him fall by before
[1:15:26] now God is speaking course no matter
[1:15:29] what I see concerning the king he says
[1:15:32] go tell him when he rises she go watch
[1:15:36] she go take a shower I see him
[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:16:22] [Music]
[1:16:33] you have touched me
[1:17:14] they're strong without even fighting
[1:18:19] the same Prophet want to tell him
[1:18:22] fix your house you're gonna die very
[1:18:25] soon
[1:18:27] Isaiah said
[1:18:32] that everyone was aware
[1:18:36] now look at the reaction
[1:18:39] the moment as soon as Isaiah turned his
[1:18:42] back and left brother says
[1:18:47] you're now more than a child of God than
[1:18:49] me the only difference
[1:19:33] go back
[1:20:35] [Music]
[1:20:39] foreign I'm gonna put a challenge so I'm
[1:20:42] not there this morning at the end pray
[1:20:44] let's do my portion next Sunday one year
[1:20:47] you're gonna come here and testify
[1:20:49] Rebecca the problem is
[1:20:51] we don't believe in our prayers
[1:20:55] but prayer change his things
[1:21:01] I love it so now we're talking about the
[1:21:05] junction
[1:21:06] we get to where Jesus himself comes on
[1:21:10] earth
[1:21:12] when we're in a junction of time God
[1:21:16] don't Manifest this episode has to
[1:21:18] manifest his powers the angels have to
[1:21:21] come down
[1:21:22] Prophet has to appear
[1:21:25] now Jesus Grant in the city and he opens
[1:21:29] the scroll
[1:21:55] the Pharisees were shocked
[1:21:58] oh this guy doesn't know how to read
[1:22:01] there's a comma right there
[1:22:03] he was supposed to finish
[1:22:06] now they saw Jesus dude stand up he said
[1:22:09] guys
[1:22:12] can't finish what you started
[1:22:15] now Jesus comes there instead of reading
[1:22:18] he closes and he says today
[1:22:23] this word of the scripture that you have
[1:22:27] heard and are complete it's fulfilled
[1:22:30] that's a complete
[1:22:33] how did that scripture
[1:22:38] because what he was reading
[1:22:41] left the scroll
[1:22:44] and became a man walking
[1:23:06] he says nobody goes that way
[1:23:09] because at the end of that road
[1:23:12] there is a fool
[1:23:51] so now listen to the reaction of the
[1:23:54] Demons
[1:24:32] okay okay
[1:24:34] foreign
[1:25:29] [Music]
[1:25:36] do you think that God will not Grant you
[1:25:39] something
[1:25:40] there's a problem
[1:25:43] if God is able to Grant a wish of a
[1:25:46] demon
[1:25:55] [Music]
[1:26:21] like any other
[1:27:30] that all he has to do something say the
[1:27:33] word
[1:27:34] um
[1:27:36] [Music]
[1:27:40] about yesterday
[1:27:43] oh I'm sorry I love it Brothers
