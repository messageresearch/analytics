TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Applause] hello when god told us after she laughed a son and being in her old age she couldn't see it possible hallelujah even now some of us don't see it we can't comprehend where god met sarah would you ever fake yourself hallelujah amen it was a personal time it was a private time that god met sarah did you affirmatively hallelujah that's why i read that scripture in romans when god said oh jesus cheryl shall have a son promise this was a promise he said this was like unto the rapture [Music] that he had not done before he changed her dna because she could not have children hallelujah so if god had just only brought it back to a young girl it would not have worked hallelujah but god was saying the message that i gave to to understand so how holy it is a word that cannot die in the paper [Music] [Music] how do you how do you surrender i say you surrender by letting go come on let it go hallelujah you say i'm going to i'm not going to eat fried chicken anymore right the chicken fried chicken is not going to disappear fried chicken is not going to disappear because you said you're not going to eat it anymore go into return hallelujah the only way it's going to get you is that you go to the place where they're selling for our chickens what what did the rod do aaron's rod guess your lip balm when it was in the holidays of holies it did nothing it is the message that changes you but if you don't read it if you don't study it if you don't listen to it but if you stay in the presence of this message it will change hallelujah amen now watch this may not regardless because when jesus rose from the dead before he rose from the dead it was a public show hallelujah the pharisees saw it the sadducees hallelujah the horrorians saw it all that believed in jehovah saw it even samaritans saw it but let and they failed may hello after the resurrection of resurrection he only goes to the elected the ministry changes did it not and what did he preach he didn't preach moses inappropriately he didn't preach elijah hallelujah but he took those prophets everything they said jesus amen hallelujah amen that's right in the easter seal a true uh mount transfigure revelations only glorifies jesus christ seth montana glorification does not glorify moses if he doesn't glorify elijah he doesn't glorify himself and glorify the church hallelujah there's only one persuasion and if you can't do that you need to repent that's where your victory is victor hallelujah your victory is not in it it's not in the organization your victory is in christ jesus hallelujah is sure hallelujah because remember happily there was a creation going on underneath the silence [Music] hallelujah y'all know silence don't mean you know i know what's silence in heaven nothing moved but it doesn't say what was going on in heaven come hadassah wasn't even recognized hallelujah she was chosen by god to be the queen right now we're not even as a christian hallelujah but we've got something man who suffered your shoulders they cannot have to earn a paper hallelujah amen yes sir are we oh my and god's only provided place in 1965 brother like this he said i believe the church is beginning to hear the message we've got to lay in the presence of the sun we've got how it's tender up till it's tended up softened up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so that it can be bathed down hallelujah amen he goes on to say he continues sometimes a but let me tell you everybody in the message you're not going to get the rapture hallelujah amen oh yes you've got to be born again hallelujah amen but there are so many people they know the system they know how to walk self-conscious he knows how to talk he self-comfortable they know how to quote yet they have not been born again hallelujah amen let me tell you something if you've got a hot temper you better get rid of it because there'll be no one in heaven i don't care if it's 40 generations old memphis [Music] hallelujah it must be cleansed if you got a love spirit on you see if we have a passion it must be dealt with let's spread the conversation and the only one is going to be dealt with you must lie in the [Music] because we're not dealing with a man's voice dealing with the voice of god what did you remember amen hallelujah you love the lord what is he doing he split onto the affair and i'm not going to be too much longer because you shut up i got it i got a way of preaching too long but we realize that there is a creation going on hallelujah amen listen in the laodicean church age the lord he said but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in of jesus christ hallelujah is there a bride coming yes absolutely there's a nuke oh my we know these things but my point is have you been focusing i've got to focus on these things shows hallelujah amen you must realize that every trial and test come your way amen dare to perfect you love well if god loved me it seems follow the key paul said who paul shall separate me give me from the love of god that i moved with you hallelujah amen amen the reason why we don't love church the way we used to pull up other lovers hallelujah is that right yes oh yeah we love that phone more than we love god jose telephone gotta say get up and pray lord give me 15 minutes [Music] why do you think we need a rapture scientists are going to destroy them hallelujah oh my let me move on [Music] it who he is in the last game he calls himself remember author of the creation of the company y'all known the body of jesus listen this has to do with the church say she constantly it's heavenly places in christ jesus christ hallelujah this is a special suspicion designation of himself until they said this in your remember this is let me say it like this he is designing himself again they say design it women especially in a special way he just said it was like the church even so you got to communicate keep it in the scripture god they say like god [Music] manifested [Music] [Music] therefore we stay with the world amen hallelujah amen glory to god you love the lord the devil hates it because he knows he began to open him open the word to his resurrection to his resurrection remember he told mary and martha uh marie martin amen and no doubt they believed it a son dude because god gave you strength to roll away the stone vasquez that came down worship today [Music] rules from the dead hallelujah let's back it up when jesus christ was crucified crucified and when he died the bible said the earthquake hallelujah he he put what is it we are now living in eternity set hallelujah nothing can stop it hallelujah no one can stop it hallelujah he's already in motion amen another creation they don't understand it hey they complain pastors brother branham tells us that this old bride okay it's going to get another outpouring did he say it just before the rapture [Music] [Music] ass stop man because i'm going to see the king hallelujah oh no turning back no turning back hallelujah god's been good to us hallelujah he gave us an astronaut he gave us somebody that was better than enoch hallelujah amen oh my you said what do you mean than enough brother enoch never came back tell us what he saw but we had a national night that was translated he went over there he came back and he but i that because jesus is raped from the dead the first time and the prison doors were opened out their thunder hallelujah and the lamb took the blood yes sir something else was released because they were in the sixth dimension but they need a body like ourselves oh my god also released [Music] [Music] he's in his very plain language in the very language the true bride of christ amen do not expressed until each came let me let me read it again the bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each one is [Music] it wasn't your designated time [Music] god had a purpose for you and it got a purpose for me hallelujah amen think about it we are the [Music] to live in the worst age hallelujah amen but he's a god of contrast because my jesus defeats satan thank you [Music] don't hold your head down of life doesn't call you by name what kick it it calls you man [Music] it has an effect on you when it has an effect positive effect that means that's why we're still standing he said until our designated time he said or decreed each member came forth uh it because uh to express and expressed and took its place in the body listen what he says this bride it's the literal spoken word seed bribe and though she is feminine in designation hey memphis it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him and is now amen manifesting god you'll manifest in a membered body you manifest the jew down please your mom whereas once god was manifested in one member even [Music] [Music] even [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what a privilege and where is he he's in his world that's what he said for knowledge but his own knowledge look to election right we know that for knowledge because of his foreknowledge he not only elected us but predestinated him [Music] make the right choices make the right choice better bolshoi let's stand on [Applause] ain't god good to us i don't know if there's someone that needs prayer desire prayer yes i'm willing to pray for you [Music] hallelujah some of you don't know how difficult it is [Music] [Music] [Music] and i was preaching on let thy will be done in earth as it all i know is that i saw god in a way i'd never seen him before two seconds [Music] raptured i felt the power of god search through me and it was it was i can't explain it all i know that it increased i'm not saying that that's the kind of thing that's supposed to happen to everybody shows [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and he magnified him god manifested you and we must be that way therefore in order
