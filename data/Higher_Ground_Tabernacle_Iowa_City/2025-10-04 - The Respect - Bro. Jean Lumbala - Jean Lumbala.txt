What we have just done is already a prayer. And that's what we believe. We believe that it's only you who can give us eternal life. It's only you can set us free from sin and only you that can heal us. Thank you for the healing that you've granted to my brother Jonas. We were waiting that you give us more testimony. A living God, it's you Lord Jesus Christ. God who heals, it's you, the Lord Jesus Christ. God who bless and we are so happy to have you as a father. Great to choose you, Lord. Promise you that we're going to follow you until And nothing going to set us apart. Neither the hurts or neither need any demons in the way can never stop us. We've already put our hands on the shoulder and will never look back. We shall follow you until we thank you for the presence in this place. We thank you for your children that came in this place. They came to listen from you, Lord. May you accept oh God to speak to us. &gt;&gt; You don't use object Lord. You don't use animals but you are using human beings may use me by your grace to speak to your people before we get to prayer. You may give us your anointing before we get to prayer. May you raise us in the heavenly places in Jesus Christ and we may be with you face to face Lord the creator of heaven and earth. Be present in our midst Lord to bless all your children especially pay back 100 whoever left everything to come into your presence Lord. May you fulfill your pro your promises but you always remember about your promises that you've given to your children. May you be present among us Lord to bless us and to protect us and let all the glory the honor and majesty be unto you Lord Jesus our Lord and our God. with casting out all the evil spirit that may be among us Lord and let only the Holy Ghost of the Lord may be welcome in this place to lead us in everything that we shall do for the glory of the father and our children in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we have so prayed amen the Lord richly bless you we may stand up on our feet to read in two places in the Bible. It seems like you are so tired and I believe you're coming from your work which is fine. But let us give our time to the Lord. It's not going to be long. We're going to to read in the book of second Philippine or in the book of Philippian chapter 2. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Second chapter of Philippine verse 3. &gt;&gt; We're going to read in the name of the Lord. Let nothing be be done through uh strife or vain glory, but in loneliness of mind, let each uh let each estim other better than themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. &gt;&gt; You can also read in the book of Psalm 115 verse 15. Psalm 105 verse 15. &gt;&gt; Touch not my unwined and do and do my prophet no harm. May the Lord add great blessings to the reading of his word. We may be seated. We're going to spend a wonderful time before the Lord before we pray. So from those two scriptures we just read and our title our subject will be respect. And respect is a preaching from our our prophet William Roden. That's why I love him so much. And I believe you also love him. May God bless you. You that love the prophet. May the Lord bless you. So the respect is a preaching from the prophet. He did better than me because is is the prophet the mouth of God for our generation. And I believe we believe that. May God bless everyone who believes that way. We love the prophet because he's telling us everything. &gt;&gt; He's telling us about even respect. And I will tell you that you will go to many churches. It should be hard for you to find a preacher who's taking a subject as a respect and all of that. But we only found it in the message in the mess of the arrow and the sufficient source. everything that we need, everything that God thought in his mind. All the powers against leadership, everything that God could give us to overcome. He has done it in the midst of the end time by his prophet William Brham. That's why I really don't understand When you see someone who's in the message and is not satisfied, I don't know how it's happening to you. &gt;&gt; If the message doesn't make you happy, &gt;&gt; what's going to make you happy? I never understand that. Everything that men need to leave, &gt;&gt; everything that you need for your rapture, Everything that a men need to overcome in this world. We got all of that in the mess of the end time in the field of BS. Everything that we want to eat, everything that you want to drink, it's all in the message of the end time. And we will never go seek for them outside of the word. giving money, blessings, healings, everything that you can imagine. We do have all of that in a message. And you will find a preacher. You said, "No, I left the message. No, I went to another pastoralist. It means that that preacher never believed &gt;&gt; and he has never been one of ours. Because I believe that the message is the word of God and the word of God it's a net when they they plunge a net and the one who plunge the net in waters is looking for fishes but curiously there's also frogs and other stuff in the net. There are all all other kinds of reptiles. We're not going to eat those reptiles because God doesn't need them. There will be there will be a a a separation. God is going to separate things. He's going to separate things before we get to the end. Let those who are living the message, let them go. &gt;&gt; Let them go if they want to go. and let them leave us with our message because we live this message and we cherish it &gt;&gt; and we want to be the believers of the message until Jesus found us in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; So we talking about respect. So when I was looking at the beginning I didn't understand that it's a great message respect I thought maybe just a little word respect but when I start digging down and examining and I found out respect is a great thing a great thing respect Because somebody who lack of respect &gt;&gt; is not a Christian. &gt;&gt; That one is not a Christian. A Christian is respectful. As Christian, we owe everybody. &gt;&gt; And that debt is respect. We ought to respect everybody. We ought to respect even those who don't don't don't deserve it. And what did the prophet say? Even the priest Catholic people with his garment we ought to respect him. Even pagan people don't those who don't believe the drunkard people we ought to respect them &gt;&gt; because if you respect them that's the way for you to win is all because Jesus loves and children of Jesus loves also sinners. so you love people who don't deserve your love. That's what Jesus have done on the cross. He has loved us when we couldn't be loved. That's what Jesus have done. So I wanted to understand what is respect and I I search on Google what's a respect. So there were many definitions. So I choose one of these definitions because it struck my mind. So listen to what I read as a definition of the respect &gt;&gt; is a moral feeling &gt;&gt; and social which which include recognizing the the value of a man. So the respect to bring you to recognize this person in front of me is more than me &gt;&gt; and you believe that's the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a proof of uh consideration. It's a proof of tolerance and uh politeness. and honesty &gt;&gt; then I look to this uh definition then I said so if somebody doesn't is lack of respect which means is impolite it means it's a a pride a pride person A pride person when a pride comes here &gt;&gt; in our church in his mind in his bolderness. He think is more than everybody. In his mind he think is more intelligent than everybody. He think is so stronger than everybody. Or maybe she's beautiful than anybody. Let the devil make you believe that you are more than anybody because God has created us to complete each other. There's nobody who self-sufficient. What I know, you don't know it. And what you know, I don't know it as well. &gt;&gt; But if you are together, we can do something. We are to believe in the talent of somebody. I was listening to a to a a great man &gt;&gt; uh if you to know how to dress your self is to envy others. You ought to see something better from other people too. &gt;&gt; You got to value your pe your value your brothers. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to value him and and and and believe that he's a son of God, &gt;&gt; you are to believe that he's a son of God. And just because he's a son of God, &gt;&gt; then he deserve respect. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We not an association of impolite people. We don't believe in impoliteness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We not also believing in a pride because we are nothing to stand. It's only the grace of God that sustain us and sustain. It's only the grace of God that gives us food. Only the grace of God that gives us. And it's only the grace of God that gives us marriage. It's a grace of God that gives us children. And it's a grace of God that gives us everything. So the one who overcome the wall, &gt;&gt; it's a humble man. He's a humble man. He's a little man. That's what Jesus said unto us. &gt;&gt; Keep yourself humble. &gt;&gt; Then you will be raised up. So the way to go up &gt;&gt; you got to go you got to humble yourself. &gt;&gt; You will see a victorious person by his way of humbling himself. If you humble yourself before the word of God. If you humble yourself before your your brothers where we just read what did they say? Let each one of us consider other person as more superior than us. That's how we have to walk if you want to please God. You'll never respect somebody that you don't love. And I also discover something that respect is not a failure. It's not a weakness. But respect is a power. Respect is a power. Every son of God has got the gift of respect. &gt;&gt; So he has to respect the children of God. He has to respect the word of God. &gt;&gt; He has to respect the gift that God give us. Do you believe that? Right. &gt;&gt; I'll give you my example. &gt;&gt; God has given me a car. I'm respecting that car, the car that God has given me. No prostitute can enter my car. My car will never take me to steal some money in the bank. If I do that, I'm respecting my car because it's God who have given me that car. When I'm respecting the car, then God will observe. He'll give me a bigger car than what I have. Because when you respect those little thing that God gives you, God going to raise you up and he will give you greater things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got a house, &gt;&gt; you ought to respect that house. You got to make sure that the word of God is in that house and God is honored in that the house because it's not only your own house where you living as a son of great king. You got right go right to a god and angel has to come and guard you while you are sleeping. Why the enemy want to do harm you but his angels around you and those bodyguard around you but now those body gods are observing filthy around you. You got to respect your house. Let Jesus be number one in your house. Let angels be honored in your house. let the children of God be happy in that house. Be welcoming in your house. By doing that, you will welcome even angels. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, when you receive the children of God, they are greater than angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So angels were lost in heaven. And God has never went to seek for them. &gt;&gt; God has never went looking for angels, those who were lost. Even when he came to die upon the cross, he never shed his blood for Lucifer. But Jesus shed his blood for his own children. And the children of God, it's you who believe that is the son of God is the children of God. May God bless you. Because you are a children of a great king above God is not any other power. &gt;&gt; And if you are a child of God, that's the highest position you could have. The highest position you could have is to be a child of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So respect &gt;&gt; is a great thing. We ought to have this kind of respect among us. Many people don't understand what is respect. They don't understand it. A father has to respect his child. That's more important. And we believe only the little one has to be to respect the olders. The great one has to respect the little one. &gt;&gt; How can you respect our children is by leaving the word of God in front of our children? Because everything that we can do to our children, everything that we're going to say unto them, go to church on Sunday, you ought to pay your tithe and you ought to do this and that. Then the child is observing you. is taking what you're doing. &gt;&gt; How is my dad doing things? So the child is observing then the child will do the same. He will never do what you're saying. The child will do what you do because our actions they speak louder than our words. So by leaving the word of God in front of the children, &gt;&gt; we are respecting them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are respecting our children when we leaving the word of God in front of them and the husband has to respect his h his wife because many people are claiming this woman doesn't respect me, this woman doesn't respect me. So, do you respect also your husband? &gt;&gt; Do you respect your wife? &gt;&gt; No, it's me who got married to her. &gt;&gt; But she's a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; She deserve your respect. So, how can you come? You've got things in your phone. Your your wife doesn't know about it. There's other calls that you're making when you go in a bathroom. That's where you make calls. Then you waiting for your for your for your wife to inspect you. You don't deserve it. You are a bad husband. If you got something like that, don't hide it. That's why God has put servant of God. &gt;&gt; Believe in him. &gt;&gt; Talk to him. Then we pray together. Then the Lord has given us that power to pray for each one another. I can tell you that many victory that I overcome is by the prayer of other people. So many prayers that I got, I got them by the prayers of other servant of God. Never hide your weaknesses. The devil is so strong when you hiding your your weaknesses. &gt;&gt; You never will forgive him because you hiding your weaknesses in front of the devil. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; the one who hid his weaknesses will never prosper. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So see the servant of God, pray with them is very important. I've given my testimony here of how I've overcome this, how I overcome cigarettes and all the stuff. It was by a prayer of a servant of God. He prayed for me. I also pray for myself. But he prayed for me. Then I I kept that victory until today. Now that I'm telling you, If you are smoking in front of me, &gt;&gt; I feel like I have to throw out. &gt;&gt; I feel like throwing out. &gt;&gt; So, how did I win that victory? &gt;&gt; A servant of God helped me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe in a respect. &gt;&gt; We don't believe in a hypocrisy. You do like you respect him when you there. &gt;&gt; Oh, hi brother. May God bless you. Thank you for coming at our place. Oh, you can have some some juice. When he left, he's also married. But the way he's drinking juice is like he was hungry. We are in America, but he's suffering. I understand that's not respect. &gt;&gt; That's hypocrisy. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He wasn't get along getting along with hypoc of his time. &gt;&gt; He was in trouble with Pharisees hypocrite. &gt;&gt; He said, "You hypocrite hypocrite. Hypocrite. &gt;&gt; See what you're doing to others. But you want others to take their burden on them while you are not even able to point your burden. &gt;&gt; So Jesus didn't love those Pharisees because Pharisees were hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bernham, listen to his uh declaration. I prefer to meet my God &gt;&gt; as a sinner not like a hypocrite &gt;&gt; because to be hypocrite is from devil. &gt;&gt; To be hypocrite is a devil. We believe in a respect but a respect based on honesty. Integrity, &gt;&gt; honesty, I mean uh respect based on honesty. &gt;&gt; What is integrity &gt;&gt; is to do good. When they see you, you do also good. Even when they don't see you inity, that's integrity. If there's somebody here, we are together, we singing and we know that he's our beloved ones, but he's living with other group in the darknesses. We don't know. Here's another name outside that we don't know. I'll tell you an I went in a in an office of my my cousin. My cousin was was working at a immigration and that day he didn't expect me to be in his office. So our our big brother at work he didn't have another name and I'm ashamed of that name. They were calling him a husband of prostitute. So when you see him at home, he's a good man, kind &gt;&gt; and you think he's more disciplined, it's is full of respect and they say young how is the university at school but in his office he was even dancing women were coming there. Women were taking money from his pocket and our husband And when I get to the office, &gt;&gt; he wasn't looking at me. Uh, at a moment when he turned around, he realized that I was already in the office. Oh, my little ones. Oh, you see this is work. &gt;&gt; Never go tell your big sisters and stuff. &gt;&gt; Don't bring things from the office home. &gt;&gt; So, what's your problem? So he understood that I've re uh recogniz him. &gt;&gt; So when you are a Christian daylight, you are to be a Christian even at night. If your name is brother John, so you ought to be brother John too, not with another name outside that we don't know in other places that we don't know. &gt;&gt; That's hypocrisy. &gt;&gt; And hypocrisy people, they've got no place in our kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't love God by hypocrisy. &gt;&gt; We don't respect children of God by hypocrisy. And we don't do it by hypocrisy. We are showing our face to people. We're not chameleons. Those who are changing their colors every time. That's how they Yeah. So when there were a meeting of B. So the B was going in that meeting. When there was a meeting of B, he was also going in the meeting of B. But when he was in trouble, everybody denied him. Bird sailed. He's flying. Yes. He comes to our meetings. But he doesn't have feathers. &gt;&gt; So they rejected him and the mouse came. They look at him. Yes, you've got like us. You've got feathers, but we don't fly. So he's not our brother. That's how he has been rejected by everybody. He got rotten because he wasn't showing his true colors. We are to show what we are. If you've got some troubles, some difficulties, it's happened to everybody. We can fix it in between. We pray, we cast out a demon. And we believe that by the power that the Lord has given us in, we got the power to cast out demons. What is evil is when you hiding the evil in you. When you hiding your your your evil, you're making him strong. But when you make him out, &gt;&gt; he's weak. &gt;&gt; And we can cast him out and he's going to obey to the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are acting by honestly steelity &gt;&gt; and we are respecting by integrity. &gt;&gt; We are the same person everywhere we go either night or day. &gt;&gt; We are still the same person. That's why we believe in this place. We believe in our respect. &gt;&gt; Respect to the things of God. &gt;&gt; Respect to our children. Respect. &gt;&gt; Respect to the servant of God. &gt;&gt; Respect to the word of God and respect to our Lord. &gt;&gt; If you are here and you believe that you are a son of God, you ought to respect the children of God. &gt;&gt; We don't criticize the children of God. We don't talk bad about those brothers &gt;&gt; for they are children of God. We got to honor them and you think children of God is only those who are in Kinasa because you alone with them. If maybe they are living with you, you only watch them on the TV how they are saying. I love them. those who are in Kas and Chicago but children of God they are even in this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I believe that the one who seated next to you is a child of God and he deserve your respect. &gt;&gt; We ought to respect among ourselves. &gt;&gt; We ought to concede ourselves. We ought to value ourselves. &gt;&gt; If you love somebody if you respect somebody, &gt;&gt; if you value somebody, you will never say all these mistakes. You know me. That's an example that I'm taking. Even if my mother was a witchcraft, I will never say my mom my mom is a witch. That word will never come out of my mouth. It will never come out of my mouth. Even if I knew that she was a witch. I will never say it. Why am I saying? Because I love her. Because I honor her. Because I respect her. The same witch. She took care of me when I was little. I didn't even know what's a witchcraft. She could even kill me when I was still young. She could even uh uh discourage me. But she gave me everything that is good. But today, even if I found out that she's a witch, I will continue to honor her. But if you know also that your brother is has got weaknesses somewhere, you got a you got a right to pray for him first. &gt;&gt; You respect him because &gt;&gt; because you consider him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to read something before we close. &gt;&gt; The advice of a prophet. We're going to read this to close &gt;&gt; in the preaching respect of 196061 from paragraph 47. &gt;&gt; So I'm asking you to pay more attention to this because it's more important. respect. That's why I understand that respect is a great thing. We ought to have that kind of respect. And a respect, &gt;&gt; a true respect based upon honesty integrity, &gt;&gt; based on integrity that we not waiting only for people to respect us, but we also respecting other people. But listen, pay attention to this. Paragraph 47 we're going to read. &gt;&gt; The conclusion of everything that has been said is to fear God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you will never have respect if you don't fear God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You should have fear of God. Solomon in the proverbs he said. &gt;&gt; Fear of God is a is a beginning of wisdom. Fear of God is a beginning of wisdom. It doesn't mean you are you you are afraid of him. No. But it means you giving him respect and reverence. So when you respect God, you are fearing God. You are fearing not to displease him in something. So you are afraid of doing something bad, things that you didn't want to do. 49 &gt;&gt; I fear my mother. &gt;&gt; I fear my wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I fear my wife. We I know where we coming from. We know each other where we coming from and we know how we say things. There's also a big brother who lived in impoliteness. He want to play that with the children. My little boy come here. Never let a woman play with you because a woman is nothing. So our brother doesn't believe that way. He says I fear my wife. It doesn't mean I'm afraid of my wife but I just I respect her. That's what the prophet is saying. &gt;&gt; I fear my church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody who fear the church, &gt;&gt; he's going to respect his church. He's going to talk good about his church. And when we talk about church, we talking about members of a church. &gt;&gt; You respect the church. &gt;&gt; You respect the children of God that are in the church. That is respect that we need. So we're going to pray tonight so that God can give us respect. God can fill us with respect. Respect for children of God. Respect for the things of God. Respect for the program of God. As you came in this place, so you support the program of God of the church. We've got a program of coming pray on Friday as you came. So you are respecting your church. &gt;&gt; May God bless you for respect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I fear my church. Listen. I fear all the servant of God. Afraid of not stumbling them. Listen. I fear people. I fear people of this city. Even people that you meet at work, you ought to respect them because when you respect somebody, you love them and Jesus loves those sinners. Children of Jesus loves also sinners. So to respect people, that's the way to win their souls to the Lord. Something is coming. It's going to be long. Let's continue. So I fear people of this city in order not to stumble them. that they may think that I'm not a Christian. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we are living, &gt;&gt; we want everybody to believe that we are we are Christian. Listen my beloved ones. We should not say to people that we are Christian. People should see Christ in us. How are we going to leave? &gt;&gt; Okay, let me say it because it's just there was a servant of God. &gt;&gt; God told him. You go in that city to preach a word of God. So he went to the city where God have sent him. He found somewhere to leave. He stayed there. He was just praying. He was saying to God, "Which day am I going to preach? When am I going to start preaching?" God said unto him, "Okay, just stay. I I'll give you a sign." He stayed there for one, two, three months. One morning when he woke up to pray, God show him in a in a dream, "Your your mission is done. You ought to go now. That's not impossible. You said that I was coming to preach in this city to preach, but you're telling me that my mission is done. You regret about it. He said, "Lord, you have sent me. I didn't hold. But I will submit myself to your will. May your will be done." Then he left. So God went to speak to another servant of God. You going to go in the same city. It's you that going to preach when he get there. &gt;&gt; Okay. The the the uh uh God loves sinners. God respect people. God doesn't want us to use or to take people's wives. We ought to respect the word of God. So God is love. &gt;&gt; God is full of respect. When he preached that way, people said, "No, that's not possible. So everything that you're saying is Jesus." Yeah, it's that's how Jesus is. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said Jesus was here. &gt;&gt; He just left. We have seen Jesus. If it's that Jesus you're talking about just baptize us because we want to be like that person who was here that guy that person God have used him to preach the word of God by his way of living. That's what each one of us has to do to preach the word of God according to his life and your your life has got more impact than the word that you're saying in our mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen at paragraph 50. You see, &gt;&gt; so before you get the respect, &gt;&gt; you got to have fear of God. And God is requiring the fear of God. God is claiming respect. &gt;&gt; Is claiming it. God is requiring respect &gt;&gt; and the fear of God as well. &gt;&gt; We know that the fear of God brings respect. &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to skip because it's too long. Okay. Paragraph 53. Listen now. Because God is God. &gt;&gt; He deserves the respect. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; We ought to respect God and have fear of him. &gt;&gt; And that's going to produce respect. So God has claimed that for himself and for ill for all his servant when we talking about servant of God. I believe I've already said it so many uh several times. The servant of God is not only the one who who's preaching. It's not only the preacher who is a servant of God because God has made us the kingdom of priest. There's a way of working for the Lord being seated down. If you leave the word of God at work, you are the servant of God even at work. So your life can bring somebody to the Lord. And when God when God is requiring respect for himself, he also claim respect for his servant. All his servant. So how do we know that they are servant of God? Because God is vandicating his servant by his by his word. He's taking those servant and make them the servant of God. is proving that they are the servant of God by fulfilling the word of God through them. &gt;&gt; Now pay attention and when you respect those servant of God, &gt;&gt; you are respecting God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And &gt;&gt; when I respect you &gt;&gt; and you respect me as well that we're respecting each other, &gt;&gt; then we respecting God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] So when you misrespect the children of God, &gt;&gt; you will never say you're respecting God. How can you respect God who's far away but the person in front of you don't the son of God? You don't respect him. You don't like listen what Jesus said to close. He said to Peter, &gt;&gt; Simon, Peter, if you love me, feed my sheep. And if there's a sheep of Jesus in this world, it's us, the believers of the message. We should have respect for one another and we should give respect to our Lord. May God bless us. Amen. Just bear with me. I've got a another prayer request. &gt;&gt; Uh this time is a big brother to sister Julie. He's also sick in Johannesburg. Uh we hear that he has been diagn diagnosed something in his body and we found that is a pandic. He may go through operation tonight. Maybe they are busy uh uh doing the surgery and we're going to pray for him. Let us remember him in the prayer. &gt;&gt; If there's also somebody who has a problem, &gt;&gt; he's going to raise his hand, then we will pray for him. If there's somebody who has got something a fight, something that is fighting something to have victory. If he can come over here, we can call each other. Then we will pray for one another. That's what God requests from us. Pray for each other. Bangladesh song [Music] the patient. Oh swore. [Music] I'm walking [Music] [Music] nation. Oh, we blah [Laughter] [Music] [Music] blah Oh blah.

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] We're going to raise our voices to speak to the Lord to ask for respect from God, &gt;&gt; the true respect from God, &gt;&gt; not hypocrisy, &gt;&gt; not the bypass, the byass respect, &gt;&gt; but the true respect of God, &gt;&gt; the respect of children of God, Let each one of us pray. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Is it [Music] One more. [Music] [Music] [Music] John [Music] Okay. forch. occur. Amen. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Fore medicine. No Let's get Amen. Amen. [Music] May the Lord bless each one of us. We say thank you to the Lord for the respect that he gave us. And we're going to go in our houses believing that God has blessed us by giving us respect. Those who respect the word of God because we're respecting the word of God. And we're going to put something in the basket over there as an offering that we came with. That's what the word of God is telling us. Every time you gather in the house of the Lord, for your meeting to be complete, for your fellowship to be complete, you should do something, you should offer something to God. So let us start from there. Let us respect the word of God by giving the offering that we have. Then I'll be looking to the person who's going to go out or dying without giving his offering. May God bless you. So we're doing it by the love of our God. So let us go in the peace of the Lord.
