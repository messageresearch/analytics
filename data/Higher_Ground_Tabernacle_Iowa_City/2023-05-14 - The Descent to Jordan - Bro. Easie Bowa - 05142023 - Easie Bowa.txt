open the bible to read you about your word have much knowledge than the Holy Spirit we only count on you Lord so the Holy Spirit can come and teach us the words you know that the man the word of a man always bring death and only your word can bring full of life and eternal life now we surrender ourselves unto you the word unto your hands let your children that's gonna listen to this world be blessed and transform them and bring them forth everything they need throughout their Journey on his Earth until the glory so they may find everything they need now we surround everything into your hands in Jesus Christ his name we pray amen may the Lord bless you really happy this morning you may be seated I was saying that I was so happy this morning to be in the house of the Lord with you I know that it's been almost a month imagine yeah and I have been away from you for a month but all places that I wear uh I was my heart was burning to be here Pastor because you are a wonderful people now say this by mouth because we know what we're saying uh I am one of those that are less ons it is real to me to uh following someone so whenever I say something I really mean what I say uh um Lord Jesus Christ very well if you're doing well please lift your hands one sister didn't raise up in hands all I know that she's not doing fine yeah but everything is going to be fine you know when we come in the house with God everything must be all right I always say don't bring the code of Iowa in the church means church is the place where everything must be had because it's not even a cold season anymore now I want to say before we started uh if someone wants to sleep during the preach the service I have one skills that are the Lord helped me to help people doing the questions so whenever somebody sleeps we're just gonna ask a question who's going to yeah and you can find that the person sleeping and everybody gonna know that the person says so pay attention because I'm gonna ask that question in the time and when you don't understand what they say are you going to hell I mean he had a friend named John Jean is John went because he had to go to church yeah very uncertain manifestation and there were a manifestation of power so John Wayne asked his brothers can I borrow your shoes because I want to worry wear it yeah [Music] oh John you went with my shoes it is a disgrace to sleep in church instead of Rejoice with my shoes you have to bring me back my shoes it's not a good thing to sleep during the service okay now we just uh turn on your spirit so we can start up this morning we're going to start uh with the service teaching that we started and I want to finish this at least three Sundays and then we can bring for something but I would like to tell the church I thank the pastor to give me this opportunity to stand here and to bring together and I thank you for coming to listen to us because you know that if you're not here we have one person acupressure we do not have anybody to pray the Lord has put in my mind in my heart a message in uh what's the mission of the church and everything that the church is all about that's why if you pay attention foreign [Music] that God went through uh politics are also churches it's now every girl in that church but church people who are in themselves temple of God says Whenever two or three are guarded in my name is [Music] not supposed to be here if we come in here with different motives the Lord will not be here [Music] that is church now let's read the word of God foreign uh we're going to read the second book of uh King versus second book of Kings uh chapter two where and verse 3. it is written and and Elijah said unto Elijah Terry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to to better it is and Elisha said unto him as the Lord lived it as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to birth and the sons of the prophets that were at better came forth to the Elijah and said unto him notice that that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he said yeah I know it hoji your peace foreign foreign [Music] and Elijah said unto him stay here I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and isolated I will not leave thee and they went to win and 50 million of the sons of the Prophet went and stood to view a fall off and they they too stood by Jordan and Elijah took His Garment and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided here and Tighter so so they too went over on dry ground may God bless the rhythm of the word we may be seated [Music] Christ the type of Christian in his church Elisha Elijah that means it is called to be uh to replace the Prophet Elijah it wasn't an easy tasks it was a really difficult time [Music] at the same way the church is called to replace the ministry of Christ because Elijah has to replace Elijah and to replace means to come to a position or doing the test that the other one was doing that means uh replace Elijah Allah it was not an easy thing not only it was in a Revival but it was the Revival and brothers and sisters we understood that Elisha means a tip typified the type of Christ so the church that was simplified by Elijah is to receive his Revival after the departure of the Christ [Music] [Applause] to turn back to the words Jordan now here we are in the Jordan now listen uh the same Prophet the Jew the holy the the the same Prophet God in order for Elijah to see Elijah being raptured Elizabeth in order for Elijah to see those churches and those horses that came down to take away [Applause] to come down to the Jordan segment will only speak for 450 ones just know that you already use my 20 minutes so be patient with me I'm not gonna abuse your time just be patient with me especially when I've been out away from him so I'm not in a rush of living away from here I'm not in a rush if you see somebody sleeping we already know what's going to happen just say you're a candidate to the one that's sleeping it's you welcome in Hell tell him [Laughter] it's not my problem okay now listen foreign [Music] to take away early to take uh Elijah home that was that was a foreign he had had enough to to to argue to talk with those people arrested and being with hungry and are talking disputes Elijah was ready to go back home and Elisha the Prophet The Prophet God said he wanted to see a vision [Music] and I hope that every believer's needs this morning I want to see a vision and foreign never brought anybody anywhere major but God hallelujah foreign be ready [Music] impact on Elijah I'm the Prophet The Prophet said when God took away Elijah Elizabeth when he was ready for Revival now notice this meant I was a young uh a young farmer yeah God made his name immoral don't let Prophet all those Prophet that was standing there yes they called The Prophet from the schools now we're standing in 50 minutes they were forced to bow down him before him across the day because of what basketball because he had the problem the power of God in on him brothers and sisters nothing can bring this I suppose to bow down before you if you are a like the only thing that we bring the world to bow down you get the power of God the world will bow down that's what they did foreign where God can give us a vision with God Jordan believers off we're a better visions that Vision that comes from God I would like in that Vision that you can figure out yourself why so you can see yourself that in their Vision but you can see yourself a prosper in everything where God gives a vision Palace Affairs just remember God is the author of The Vision foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] the farm [Music] where God can find them it's because we have people who never cross over it I keep in your mind with Christ today today is bringing us so Elijah bro and brought him somewhere else well the power of God came down foreign who wants to be who wants to go to hell yeah who wants to go to hell tell the one that's sleeping next to you okay thanks for going to hell yeah no I don't want to mention him no no listen God is trying to empty us three is foreign we all know with Brothers and to empty us completely Farms to be men and women sample without fear mature who love God and we can stand with God we can reach the line of Separation yes I can cross over Jordans so that he can use us for his glory this is the time [Music] they will all the wisdom and that was a knowledge but you know when Moses wants it to deliver based on that knowledge that never worked thank you is when he found the Egyptian that was beaten yeah according to the words when Moses found those two Israelites you are brothers you want to kill me as you killed that Egyptian you have or is that completely and Moses knew that the thing is foreign and that took 40 years now listen it was the teachings Moses had four years of training of knowledge of Egyptians and God also takes 40 years to take away those knowledge it takes another 40 years to be the leader of Israel now look what we need you but when we come to God we just want things to happen we don't want to take time so that God can empty us from our knowledge of the word this is what we do wrong to his own School of training something happened to Paul now listen thank you now listen hello hey every time we try to help somebody first by our own forests even foreign I will never be satisfied Tavi unless you like this be completely entitled consecrated to God what I'm saying news we have built a lot of schools you can do everything oh places of tourists and temples and be consequent in the works of God when you can only pray for a minute how commitment how can you uh overcome the world when you cannot even do five minutes and pray you all alone how can you separate yourself if the phone takes you all your times last time I've read the OMS the wrote an article says [Music] are you separate from the things of the world because with iPhones it can tell you how much you spend with your phone whose iPhone already and you know what how many times can I be separated from the
