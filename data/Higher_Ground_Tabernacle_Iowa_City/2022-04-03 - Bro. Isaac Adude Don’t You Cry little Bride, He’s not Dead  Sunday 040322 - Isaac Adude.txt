us lord i pray father god that you helped me to be so sensitive to the holy spirit because your soul from my son's siblings that i can say whatever you and open our bibles to the book of luke chapter 24. uh luke chapter 24 it's a lengthy it's a lengthy scripture i apologize for that to be first i can just read the whole thing in english the scripture is found in luke chapter 24 we read from verse 13 to verse 35 um this story happens after the death of jesus praise have been saying these stories after the death of jesus when the two disciples were going to the uh ems road uh say it says jesus some and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emeas which was from jerusalem about three school footlongs and they talked together of all the of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with him but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk in or sad and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him are thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not known the the things which have come to pass they're there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty and mighty indeed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him now verse 21 it says but we trusted that he had been here which should have uh redeemed israel and beside of this to the day uh today is the third day since these things were done yay and a certain woman also of our company made us astonished where uh which were early in the sepulcher and when they found now his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and a certain answer and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them all fools and slaughter of heart believable that believe all that the prophets have spoken uh now christ to have suffered these things and enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh onto the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone farther but they concerned him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in and to terry with him and he came to pass as he said and meet with him he took bread and blessed it and break and give and give to them and their eyes were opened to him and he vanished out of their side and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and why he opened to us the scriptures and it rose up the same hour ruslan and found the eleven gathered together and them that worked with them saying the lord is risen indeed and has appeared to simon and they talked what things were done in the way and how it was none of them in breaking bread amen you may be seated thank you amen uh but we're still sitting up i want to repeat the verse 21. because it's very important for us the bible says in verse 21 but but we trusted that he had been he which shall have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done amen this morning by god's grace i have a little subject that i wanted to bring but we're entitled don't cry little bride he's not dead um don't you cry little brother he's not dead because as we we read in verse 21 of only the disciples expressed to jesus their complain or they their regrets amen for the torah the death of jesus the word and we saw how god was going to do it so we were certain that this is the deliverer we're certain that this is the man who will set us free from amen they were crying because they saw the deliverance was so close and all of a sudden it just went away they were crying but you see that in the lowest time in the lowest moment where all hope was gone that was when jesus appeared to them that was when jesus decided to walk with him you see that jesus came to join them and jesus started to talk with him along the way he asked them why are you sad you asked them why are you crying didn't you know that according to the word that these things were supposed to happen himself told you that that you know he was supposed to be dead for three days jesus jesus gave you the example of jonah donald example jesus gave you the parable of the temple when he said destroy this temple and i will build it in three days amen jesus explained all the words to you but why are you guys still crying amen but the thing is that when jesus was talking to them the word that jesus was telling them was not revealed to them amen because there is a big difference between knowledge and revelation amen by the way this message was preached five times and i'm talking about this specific point amen you can you can go in detail and and quote the prophet or call the bible amen but as long as that word has not been revealed to you oh oh thank you sit back it doesn't help you amen because when when you will be tested you will forget the same word that you were quoting because these disciples image there was they walked with jesus disciples they've that was coming amen wouldn't shake them because that word was now revealed to them amen because revelation is stated a amen abraham didn't care how many people was laughing at him and abraham didn't care how many years that took in apartheid they competed amen the prophet said that he closed himself he closed all the doors of death and focused on that revelation he had the revolution they want a great awakening evil and grand revere evil and grange they're crying believing that there will be an awakening there they're good people they have not recognized the awakening of the bride by being a christian they feel the pull of the hour attraction but they haven't recognized what's been done [Music] [Music] because it was prophesied that they would be blind they were looking for something in the future [Music] [Music] in the future highways being created in the desert amen they were expecting angels coming down and crying that he is here but they forget that god was acting in simplicity as you said simplicity amen that's the same thing that happened to us amen mary was crying clearly mary was crying amen because jesus was gone amen but jesus came to her and said that why are you crying jesus said mary don't you weep mary don't you cry because i'm reason [Music] why are you crying and there was satan when satan thought that he wouldn't do it [Music] he wouldn't go through it he went through get germany hello isaac i've been dealing with this situation here is a good news for you jesus went isaac i have the spirit of homosexuality it's really bothering me so much here's another good news for you you'll see the bonneville jesus went through it and he paid the price brother isaac this is another spirit of pornography pornography adultery and all that he set you free from [Music] mandate of hamas have been filled with the holy spirit conclude the sentence amen now god is walking amen god is walking in me jeremiah and the promises of god are through our truth god time that there is a brother when the prophet was still alive and his name was oscar he was an indian indian brother so now so when the prophet started praying the prophet started his prayer with our father did not prepare so when the prophet said our father all of them join him and you know continue those prayers [Music] amen the prophet prayed for that mother for that for that moment the prophet [Music] amen and he will know yeah now it happened that the the men oscar he lost his ponies his uh uh ponies uh that horses do so now he called brother branham he said brother branham i play forever now i lost my ponies and i want you to pray so that i can find him brother well this is a mountain and we have so many wild animals here i'm pretty sure they've been eating and gone oscar said to brother branham he said that brother branham you prayed for my mom when she was when she had a heart attack amen but she was here i believe that the same god if you pray to that amen and you ask him to give me my opponents and he will give it to me amen why because that faith was revealed to him and he had the revelation who god was he had the revelation who his prophet so therefore by asking allah come to the mandate he knew amen there the bible said that god sent the angel with an answer amen it takes that faith for us to have answers to our prayers he says that you will find you will finally say that thus after the lord you will find your opponents in the snow halloween [Music] amen because they were in the snow that was like 30 foot under 20. amen there were no ways for them to survive and then on top of that they had amen he will make sure that those promises are still true can't you don't say promise it doesn't matter what the situation is take your sword it [Music] yesterday today and foreign to prove that he's the same god he's not dead but he's still alive it's like this little boy he said come to pretty good and his name was junior son and it happened at night it was raining and the thunder was when the sun was rolling and lightning and all of them so his mom went up went upstairs i mean to his bed yeah mounted um [Music] amen i need a god that i can i can go i can go to and pray and that god will hear about everything amen i need a god with a skin on him [Music] junior's mom was the guy that junior was looking for hello [Music] [Music] amen jesus said this jesus verily verily i say unto you i'm very dear to you that belief on me the works that i do shall he do also so now if you read carefully this scripture there are two cents there are two uh uh uh uh uh there this scripture is there are two uh uh uh uh chances in the scripture yeah yeah the first dance amen amen there is the first part is the present tense he said amen there's a greater word coming you are the grandson that the blood of christ will be able to boost the kiss amen but now what is that great word amen what is that greater work that jesus himself can't say because you will understand that every time that jesus was talking about that greater work no comprehensive jesus jesus was using the future amen now what is that greater word i mean i can't say grandson so here's the prophet saying the prophet amen in the message that day on calvary in the message that they are on calvary massage conference paragraph 129 paragraph 129 so now the prophet says that now know this the greater works ever was to have power in the church so now here it says that the power nature is not only to heal the sick by prayers by prayers by the greater works was to impart eternal life to believers the holy ghost was coming and giving into the hands of the church amen to import life capacity [Music] spiritual spiritual and eternal life now listen to this one this is one of the bible this one this one is my favorite sister how much greater is it combined this sick woman laying here set for malady i can pray a prayer of faith and shall be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then the secretary but i said greater than this shall you do it amen i'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while passing ma not only to raise him up for a while not only to raise him up for a while but [Music] amen [Music] amen the greater works ever that jesus was talked about amen was for us bride of christ amen to be able to preach the word after the death of jesus after the resurrection resurrection acts chapter 2 verse 37 to 38 [Music] in the heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do foreign so now here is peter amen put in action that greater works men of war pierre methane secretary amen he said that then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you la basketball and to your children and to all that that are far off now even as many as the lord our god amen you will notice that the bible says after peter had preached this message three thousand people had received the holy spirit amen why that was the greater work that jesus was to be able to transmit amen that experience that is of the holy spirit amen that's why they closed their doors amen because jesus told them to stay in jerusalem but jesus never told them to go to the operation amen because they were afraid they were scared is [Music] have shaped you amen people are looking for the god of the bible you are looking for jesus you are looking for the same jesus amen but jesus himself said jesus remember that you are written epistle of men lead the tournament we are supposed to be the god that this world is looking for second christians people are looking for [Music] that you have the spirit amen [Music] [Music] pokemon amen like adam come adam amen when he was naming the the animals country knows amen when he was naming the animals those names that was everything that god was thinking two seconds adam was able to express it

mandias he's ever merciful [Music] amen he has never seen a righteousness because god says he takes care of the little bird and he will take care of you yes the process is wonderful so don't be afraid [Music] dismayed [Music] a session you shall ask me nothing verily very i say unto you whatsoever you should ask the father in my name he will give it to you until [Music] [Music] it doesn't matter how big the problem is jesus [Music] amen these are the greatest things since all the playground shows amen they meant that you would do carefully to impart eternal life to import the holy spirit say
