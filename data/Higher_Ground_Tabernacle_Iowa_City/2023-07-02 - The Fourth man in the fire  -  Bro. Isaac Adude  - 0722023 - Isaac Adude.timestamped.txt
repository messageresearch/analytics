[55:31] that we'll be sharing with you
[55:35] that we entirely the Fourth Man In The
[55:38] Fire uh
[55:43] amen because Jesus was the fourth man in
[55:46] the fire
[55:52] saying
[55:56] amen Jesus Is My Friend
[55:59] Jesus Is My Rock
[56:01] Jesus Is My All In All
[56:04] amen when you need a friend you can go
[56:07] to jail
[56:10] amen when you need help you can turn to
[56:12] him
[56:15] when you need something he's already

[56:20] provide
[56:23] when you need a counselor he's always
[56:25] there president
[57:00] and because they stood for God they were
[57:03] cast Into the Fire foreign
[57:28] because they say that even if we go
[57:30] there and we die we will still praise
[57:33] the Lord
[57:35] [Music]
[57:36] amen they had no idea of the thing that
[57:39] was supposed to happen
[57:42] they didn't know what God had in store
[57:55] maybe people their family members or
[57:58] maybe some of their friends
[58:03] maybe some of them started to cry
[58:05] because it might be the last year
[58:08] maybe some of them started thinking
[58:11] about the great times that they spent
[58:12] together
[58:16] because everybody thought that this was
[58:19] their end hey
[58:20] if I was there too I would I would have
[58:23] thought that this was this is
[58:26] because the fire was already hot
[58:31] and because they stood for God
[58:34] the king requested to hit the fire seven
[58:38] times harder than it was yeah
[58:43] it killed the two Guardians that were
[58:46] outside of that foreign
[1:00:45] I was thinking coming down here our
[1:00:48] country
[1:00:48] listening to the song The Fourth Man in
[1:00:51] the fire from Brother Orion
[1:00:53] song
[1:00:55] even listen to that song and I started
[1:00:58] to think
[1:01:00] I was like did God really had to go down
[1:01:04] in that fire escape
[1:01:07] look he's God
[1:01:09] he could have said a word and that fire
[1:01:12] will be quenched
[1:01:15] amen he could have said a word and that
[1:01:18] fire will be you know
[1:01:21] saying
[1:01:23] amen he could have spoke the word and
[1:01:26] the king and all those soldiers were
[1:01:28] dying instances
[1:01:31] I started to think I was like did God
[1:01:34] really had to go down in there
[1:01:38] he went in there
[1:01:41] to show you that every time that you go
[1:01:44] through something
[1:01:46] foreign
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:02:46] the
[1:03:29] he says that I was with I I was with the
[1:03:32] Hebrew children in the fiery furnace is
[1:03:40] he couldn't burn to him because of the
[1:03:43] presence of the fourth man says
[1:03:53] he said that I was with Daniel in the
[1:03:56] Lion's
[1:03:58] denial
[1:03:59] I was identified in there
[1:04:04] when the angel of the Lord identified
[1:04:07] him in there God launched the launched
[1:04:11] the letter
[1:04:14] I was with I I was more surely with him
[1:04:18] at Calvary
[1:04:21] I must be identified with him at Calvary
[1:04:24] Universe
[1:04:26] amen I must be there to a place
[1:04:31] uh uh that were now also was not
[1:04:36] identified within a Calvary I died with
[1:04:39] him recovery
[1:04:44] every Christian Must Die within recovery
[1:04:49] if you don't die within a coverage
[1:04:53] you can't be none of this
[1:04:57] I was there when he died
[1:05:00] I died with him
[1:05:03] and then I was with him when he raised
[1:05:06] out from the dead
[1:05:08] I come up on Easter morning with him
[1:05:14] Amen in the resurrection
[1:05:16] whatever he did
[1:05:18] I was there with him
[1:05:22] every believer was the same hey
[1:05:26] man now here's the question
[1:05:29] so if you were there with him
[1:05:32] amen during his lowest time of his life
[1:05:35] you were identified
[1:05:39] amen they're at Calvary when he was
[1:05:41] crying father Juarez Thou forsaken you
[1:05:45] were there with him

[1:05:52] you were there with him can't you later
[1:05:55] amen when he was given the uh vinegar to
[1:06:00] drink you were there
[1:06:03] amen when people made fun of him they
[1:06:06] mocked at him man because he was there
[1:06:08] naked at the cross

[1:06:15] there with him
[1:06:18] Amen in good times and bad times you
[1:06:21] were there with him
[1:06:24] so if I was there with him during those
[1:06:26] times
[1:06:29] would he not be with me when I'm going
[1:06:31] through trials
[1:06:47] if I was with him there at the cross
[1:06:51] if I was with him there on the cross
[1:07:00] will he not be with me when I need him
[1:07:03] the most
[1:07:05] if I was with him during his best moment
[1:07:08] and his worst moment of his life
[1:08:13] amen where would I go where could I go
[1:08:16] when all the friends are forsaken
