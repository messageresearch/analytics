[2:57] the death brings life two seconds
[3:03] everything we are this morning
[3:07] what gives us strength this morning
[3:11] it's because there was something that

[4:10] for us to have a spiritual life today
[4:14] there was somebody who have given up his
[4:17] life
[4:18] and that man was the Lord Jesus Christ
[4:26] so that we can have that life today
[4:29] we've seen with the prophet you know
[4:34] who told us that everyone was in the
[4:36] altar
[4:38] all the type of the Old Testament all
[4:41] the parable that of the Lord Jesus
[4:45] all of them has been my person today
[4:51] if yet if you can take an example like
[4:53] of a 10 version
[4:56] it has been manifested today
[5:00] like the light showing from from East
[5:03] and going to West today
[5:10] so all the types
[5:11] and all the Parables so manifested SP by
[5:16] the first sit in front of us
[5:18] [Music]
[5:22] are we busy talking about the separation
[5:34] [Music]
[5:37] to make separation waters for the
[5:40] children of Israel
[5:42] don't in the recommendation he gave them
[5:45] some instructions
[5:51] to not take any animals but take a red
[5:56] heiferous a young cow
[6:12] there was some animal that God was
[6:15] recommending which were pure animals
[6:19] when you read in Genesis chapter 15.
[6:24] when God was coming to give a covenant
[6:28] he demanded
[6:30] recommended
[6:52] the red the red heifer said an animal
[6:56] the sacrifice it was an animal of
[6:59] sacrifice Allah
[7:04] so these animals were typifying the Lord
[7:07] Jesus Christ
[7:10] that's why God recommended to be taken
[7:15] and God also recommend recommended some
[7:19] of the birds
[7:20] like the dark
[7:23] like the
[7:25] totals
[7:34] like a pigeon say tell us also the
[7:38] sacrifice these were the sacrifice
[7:41] Spirits
[7:43] they were they were they were the Forex
[7:46] of atonement
[7:49] and all of these animals were to Defying
[7:52] the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:55] and here God says
[8:00] you may take the red heifer a
[8:03] um
[8:04] ass and we've seen last Sunday okay
[8:09] the red color was so important for the
[8:12] Redemption plane remember
[8:18] even in the rainbow the first color is
[8:20] the red color
[8:24] and the red
[8:25] consideration
[8:28] which is considered like a danger for
[8:30] the world
[8:33] but right here is considered like a cow
[8:36] of redemption for God
[8:39] that's how God says membership for
[8:42] person
[8:44] even if your sins are read like Pharmacy
[8:50] I gotta make them white like like snow
[8:54] hey come on
[8:59] how God could make the sin that is red
[9:02] and send them to be what no Prophet
[9:05] today
[9:06] the prophet says when God sees the
[9:09] believer
[9:12] are we talking about a believer
[9:25] come
[9:26] on
[9:29] ask human beings
[9:32] but when you come to God
[9:39] he sees you he look at you through the
[9:42] the the beating the bleeding
[9:45] sacrifice he look at you through the
[9:47] building
[9:48] song he sees you under the blood
[9:53] and you know that the blood always is
[9:56] red yellow Sunday
[9:58] and the blood the red blood of the Lord
[10:01] Jesus
[10:03] and God look at you through that word
[10:08] with your sin which is under the blood
[10:14] and Branham says the red and red it
[10:17] gives white amen amen
[10:25] let's read that from the uh the approach
[10:28] that God has provided for Fellowship
[10:32] of
[10:34] June 30 1960.
[10:39] from the computer is paragraph 15 but in
[10:42] the book is paragraph 23.
[10:47] he says red true red it gives white
[10:57] just look at something read through the
[11:01] red color then it's it it becomes white
[11:04] and symbol Montreal that's a symbol
[11:07] sharing that
[11:10] when God sees you through the red blood
[11:13] of his son
[11:14] the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:18] our sins that are red promises
[11:23] they become white like snow
[11:28] so when God sees us through the blood of
[11:31] his son the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:37] they tend to be white like snow
[11:42] is yesterday
[11:44] the blood then I will be white like snow
[11:47] foreign
[12:17] foreign
[12:54] be perfect
[12:57] like your heavenly father is perfect
[13:00] do you believe that
[13:03] yes
[13:35] is busy making them more clear
[13:40] ance thinking that is busy removing them
[13:42] [Music]
[13:44] summer we're not leopard let's spread
[13:46] the little pastry leopard spirit is an
[13:48] hypocrisy
[13:51] somebody want to make yourself white
[13:54] fabricate in a sentence somebody one of
[13:57] uh
[13:59] humility
[14:00] [Music]
[14:02] we're not making up the the the Holiness
[14:06] but we're leaving it
[14:09] how we becoming perfect
[14:13] we're not becoming perfect
[14:16] today so listen to what the prophet says
[14:19] in the separation words 1955.
[14:24] [Music]
[14:30] uh January 21st 1955
[14:37] but there's also another uh preaching of
[14:40] June 1955
[14:43] also talking about the separation Waters
[14:51] 14
[14:52] God sees true the blood
[14:55] please
[14:57] it doesn't see you like a sinner
[15:03] but when God sees you through the blood
[15:07] pressure he doesn't he doesn't see you
[15:10] like
[15:13] he sees you as a redeemed amen amen
[15:17] so you are ready
[15:22] because he always sees you through
[15:25] Christ say foreign
[15:31] [Music]
[16:00] Paul is trying to explain the Lord that
[16:02] has got a shadow of things to come and
[16:05] not like the sector representation and
[16:08] not exact representation of things
[16:13] could never bring the assistant to
[16:16] Perfection
[16:17] because God regardless
[16:22] could see through the blood of animals
[16:29] he sees you through the blood of his son
[16:34] Perfection comes by Jesus Christ
[16:40] in your side I'm not perfect it is
[16:54] that's where the thing is
[16:58] if you are born in the body of Christ
[17:08] if you are born in the body of Christ
[17:13] God sees you in the same manner he says
[17:17] God sees you the same way he says Jesus
[17:21] Christ
[17:32] the difference is to be born in the
[17:35] flesh
[17:38] Supreme by one Spirit
[17:41] we've been we've been baptized to form
[17:44] one body
[18:01] [Music]
[18:38] in the body
[18:39] enough
[19:22] [Music]
[20:12] [Music]
[20:22] in the sight of God
[21:21] by the blood
[21:23] foreign
[21:36] any any
[21:39] Focus any disabilities
[21:42] Jesus never it is
[21:48] because he didn't have anything
[21:52] the sins
[21:54] today the blood of Jesus foreign
[22:07] let us read uh from Romans chapter 8.
[22:10] and listen to what Paul is saying
[22:17] because we got no blemish no wrinkle not
[22:20] in the sight of man may they found you
[22:23] but in the sight of god Apollo this is
[22:26] it the Paul is saying this
[22:32] Roman Roman chapter 8.
[22:38] he said there's no therefore there's no
[22:41] now no condemnation to those who are in
[22:44] Christ Jesus
[22:49] for those who are in Jesus
[22:52] do you believe to the Bible apology
[22:59] is now therefore no condemnation for
[23:02] those who are in Christ Jesus
[23:08] for the law of the spirit of life in
[23:11] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[23:14] law of sin and death God shows them
[23:16] possibly Allah for what the law could
[23:20] not do
[23:23] in that it was weak through the flesh
[23:30] God did by sending his own son Jesus
[23:38] in our card of sin he condemned his own
[23:41] flesh
[23:42] dancing share some problems
[23:47] in that Russia or
[23:50] Iran foreign
[24:13] that the righteous requirement of the
[24:16] law might be fulfilled it has to walk
[24:19] according to the flesh but according to
[24:21] the spirit say an effective
[24:29] for those who live according to the
[24:32] flesh set their minds on the things of
[24:34] the flesh but those who lives according
[24:36] to the spirit they think uh set their
[24:39] their mind upon the things of the spirit
[24:47] for to be carnally minded is death but
[24:50] to to be spiritually murdered is life
[24:53] and peace
[25:02] because the candle mind is is enemy
[25:07] against God for it is not subject to the
[25:10] law of God law indeed can be or second
[25:14] view
[25:17] so then
[25:19] those who are in the flesh cannot please
[25:22] to God
[25:31] but but you but you are not in the flesh
[25:35] but in the spirit if indeed the spirit
[25:38] of God dwells in you
[25:44] now if anyone does not have the spirit
[25:47] of Christ he is not of him
[25:52] [Music]
[25:54] I'm busy talking to those who are in
[25:57] Christ Jesus see
[25:59] in Christ
[26:02] you become a new creation
[26:05] you're becoming a new president you're
[26:08] becoming a new brother
[26:10] sir you're becoming a new sister and in
[26:13] that time
[26:14] when God sees himself
[26:30] and for him
[26:33] is
[26:36] your sins are forgiven yeah
[26:45] she sees Jesus Christ
[27:26] that is to slot before they assembly
[27:31] [Music]
[27:33] they had to wash that red heifer on the
[27:39] air to burn that on the on the
[27:44] breasts
[27:45] which was the altar of sacrifice
[27:51] and we said that the breast means the
[27:54] Judgment
[27:56] that's why God recommend to Moses
[28:01] when the serpent were biting children of
[28:04] Israel
[28:05] for them
[28:23] and also for their hearings
[28:30] that's why they have to raise that
[28:32] breast serpent Between Heaven and Earth
[28:36] and the breath always means judgment
[28:44] sacrifice
[28:47] on the same
[28:50] the priest memories even the higher
[28:54] priest
[28:56] before
[28:59] getting to the services
[29:12] and watch the prince himself
[29:16] that's why separation was
[29:27] Jesus himself here tell no very Tumblr
[29:32] significant who was the true higher
[29:34] priest
[29:36] s he accepted to be washed by John the
[29:39] Baptist
[29:40] why did he accept to be white
[29:43] he said many people say
[29:53] so what's the true truth foreign
[30:00] [Music]
[30:22] from the paragraph 85.
[30:26] let me find it for you
[30:29] you're saying this
[30:31] is
[30:39] why do they have to be baptized or else
[30:42] to be washed
[30:45] many said yes
[30:50] Jesus was washed because he was our
[30:52] example
[30:56] yes that's true up until at a certain
[30:59] point
[31:00] at a certain level it's true
[31:06] but that's not all the truth
[31:10] the truth is was an entity
[31:15] the Young The Young or the the red
[31:18] effort was a tip was a type
[31:23] Aaron was a type two says
[31:26] all the sacrifice was
[31:29] until
[31:35] they were representing
[31:39] the anti-type was the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:42] the type is the Shadows
[31:45] and the shadow is the negative
[31:49] negative is not a positive
[31:52] when we see the negative
[31:54] opposite we've got a way to see them
[31:58] everything they were doing in all
[32:00] systems
[32:04] Jesus is an anti-type is
[32:08] the higher priest
[32:12] and before the higher priest be unwanted
[32:16] he has to be washed first
[32:26] the Jordan

[34:33] foreign
[35:16] before they can be there to be unwinded
[35:24] do you see that our own restaurant
[35:26] sacrification air on the high priest
[35:36] s
[35:44] they have preached before is unwanted
[35:48] he has to be washed with Waters
[35:50] challenges that's why when Jesus
[35:55] before being unwinning like our priest
[35:57] Elijah
[35:59] he was unwinded with water it's a love
[36:03] he was watched with Waters
[36:08] and it was not the unwinning oil that
[36:11] was power on him
[36:13] to be on Wednesday
[36:15] like it was a case
[36:19] he was unwanted by the Holy Spirit
[36:23] because John gave testimony
[36:27] seeing the spirit of God coming down
[36:30] [Music]
[36:33] and the voice was heard
[36:35] this is my beloved Son
[36:39] in whom I found pleasure to dwell
[36:42] when Jesus came to Georgia Jones look at
[36:46] him
[36:47] [Music]
[36:48] he is the Lamb of God that takes the sin
[36:51] away
[36:53] are the Jewish people
[36:58] all these people
[37:01] [Music]
[37:02] they were waiting to see a walking lamb
[37:05] [Music]
[37:06] s but they forgot
[37:08] [Music]
[37:09] when God is changing these concessions
[37:19] they were used to see a walking animal
[37:24] but this time when John look at Jesus
[37:28] he didn't see him with the nature
[37:31] spiritual but he sees him with a
[37:33] spiritual eyes
[37:36] he understood that it was the same lamb
[37:41] foreign
[38:07] Prophet John was the prophet
[38:12] you know the way
[38:26] always comes to a prophet
[38:30] is this why Jesus
[38:32] he went straight to John
[38:36] was the prophet and all of them found
[38:39] themselves the eyes of the prophets and
[38:43] the eyes of the word of God they met and
[38:46] looked at each other John look at Jesus
[38:49] and Jesus
[38:58] but Jesus said John
[39:02] Let's fulfilled you're the word of God
[39:05] yellow Prophet you're the prophet

[40:44] before being unwinded it is
[40:47] they have to fulfill all their rushes
[40:52] he has to be washed with Waters
[40:59] and that was a wonderful time

[53:14] he doesn't make you different from
[53:16] Pentecostal people because they also
[53:19] believe in God
[53:20] people believe in Jesus Christ
[53:24] because the people believes in the Holy
[53:25] Spirit
[53:31] themselves
[53:34] people but today love shows the
[53:38] difficult things
[53:40] that a human can do is to believe in a
[53:44] mortal man
[53:45] that's what people were saying
[53:48] that you are a man
[53:52] why you make yourself
[53:55] that's why the Jewish will tell Jesus
[53:57] they were not believing them
[54:02] left Heaven
[54:05] yet he was in that moment
[54:08] Jesus Christ
[54:13] me and my father
[54:22] Jesus were telling them
[54:27] you pretend to be Abram children
[54:32] he saw my day
[54:35] and he rejoiced
[54:39] but look at this child
[54:45] you are not even 50 years
[54:52] before Abram was
[54:55] foreign
[55:01] [Music]
[55:26] foreign
[56:18] thing
[56:24] [Music]
[56:25] for a mortar man to be living
[56:31] just this Brother John
[56:34] Brother John
[56:36] should I believe in brother John
[56:38] I shouldn't believe me
[56:42] yes
[56:47] no more
[56:50] but you know you'll be living in God
[56:53] that's the thing says
[56:59] he rest with us
[57:03] that's why I can bring God in existence
[57:08] they have to take that eyes up
[57:11] mix it with the cedar wood and grams
[57:15] the cross
[57:18] to mix
[57:20] the Silverwood
[57:23] and the chroma syrup
[57:28] said or they see the wood is white
[57:32] and the white color is justice
[57:35] but right inside of Cedarwood
[57:39] there's a red red line
[57:42] and that's red line
[57:45] that's the Redemption
[57:48] that's varnigating the righteousness
[57:52] we don't have our own righteousness
[57:55] but it's Christ that makes us
[58:00] the the cross was a was a curse
[58:03] yes read the Bible
[58:07] guess whoever will be uh
[58:17] on the cross
[58:20] it was a case
[58:22] but when Christ came in the processary
[58:26] he took that curse
[58:28] for you and me becomes a blessing
[58:32] amen amen
[58:35] he became cursed for us
[58:38] so that we may become blessings
[58:43] he became sin and thank you
[58:47] so that we may become Russia
[58:50] and we are the Righteous of God
[58:57] okay
[59:01] [Music]
[59:09] you know the devil doesn't like this
[59:12] kind of things
[59:13] he always trying to disturb
[59:16] anism he may disturbed by the children
[59:19] or made by the Mike
[59:26] things that we're doing
[59:29] it's like a Doctor Who's Making
[59:32] surgeries
[59:35] and God is busy making surgeries
[59:40] distractors
[59:43] she may leave the knives in the in the
[59:45] in in some yeah
[59:48] and once the person go back with those
[59:51] knives in the body
[59:57] so the doctor was distracted was
[1:00:01] negligent and left something inside the
[1:00:02] man
[1:00:07] just take care of yourself and be
[1:00:09] attentive to that
[1:00:11] so you should avoid all or going around
[1:00:15] because this is the important moment
[1:00:20] I'm listening to the word of God that's
[1:00:22] the most important thing
[1:00:28] is
[1:00:34] mixed up with blood
[1:00:36] the chromosy
[1:00:41] the red is representing our Redemption
[1:00:46] the red is our Redemption
[1:00:52] the cross was a curse but it became our
[1:00:55] blessings
[1:00:59] when every time we sing in the blood of
[1:01:01] Jesus blood of Jesus
[1:01:03] we're not just singing it from our way
[1:01:06] we could understand the the meaning
[1:01:10] the meaning of the cross the meaning of
[1:01:13] the Bible
[1:01:21] we're reading things that we don't even
[1:01:23] see in Africa
[1:01:27] here when we talk about sunset Mountain

[1:06:53] among your friends
[1:06:57] you gotta keep this word
[1:06:59] pure
[1:07:01] lesson
[1:07:03] what what this separation Waters we're
[1:07:06] doing
[1:07:09] ready when they unbelievable
[1:07:12] the one was born in Israel
[1:07:16] and who went astray who played
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:29] the first thing that was happening
[1:07:32] outside
[1:07:34] in the outside
[1:07:37] where they were saving food
[1:07:41] where the word of God was preached
[1:07:51] there were three
[1:07:55] the first part was the outside Court
[1:07:59] the second part was the Holy place
[1:08:03] and the third part was the holy of
[1:08:07] holies
[1:08:15] three three parts we've got a flesh
[1:08:18] before the spirit and we've got a soul
[1:08:23] so brother I'm saying is like all the
[1:08:25] houses
[1:08:28] every every house has got three offices
[1:08:32] there's a kitchen where we're eating
[1:08:35] there's a living room where we finish
[1:08:39] and the bedroom where we rested
[1:08:43] no matter how many rooms you may have
[1:08:46] the house is the three main rooms
[1:09:01] from the outside Court
[1:09:03] foreign
[1:09:35] he has to know how to repent himself
[1:09:39] he has to know how to come in Christ
[1:09:42] he has to get baptized in the name of
[1:09:44] the Lord Jesus
[1:09:46] in order to enter
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:10:00] when the unbeliever the one was born in
[1:10:03] Israel and went astray
[1:10:06] or maybe a stranger that comes to church
[1:10:10] the first thing he has to do outside
[1:10:13] the outside
[1:10:20] it was a man with the people
[1:10:25] there should be out there a man with a
[1:10:27] pure heart

[1:11:12] testimony
[1:11:22] it has to be a man with pure hearts

[1:12:58] blemish
[1:13:00] with Clean Hands
[1:13:03] pure
[1:13:06] Ephesians chapter 6 says
[1:13:11] By the Waters of the word of God the
[1:13:14] separation Waters

[1:31:26] if you take a position of your rights
[1:31:29] it can even change God decisions
[1:31:42] that he has to die

[1:31:48] he went to repent
[1:31:50] he went to pray
