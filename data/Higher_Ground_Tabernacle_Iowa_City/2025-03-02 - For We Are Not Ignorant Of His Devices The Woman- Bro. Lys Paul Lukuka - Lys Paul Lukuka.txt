TRANSCRIPT
========================================
verse 11 lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices so Paul is saying that if in other words he's saying if we if we ignore his devices he's going to take an advantage over us you notice he didn't say device he said devices so the enemy has multiple devices and so this morning we are going to be exposing the devil's devices and you noce Satan does not like to be exposed you know I'll read a quote where the Prophet says he doesn't like this kind of services and we can already see this morning he's already fighting with the mics and all that but one thing we want to let Satan know is that he's going to be exposed anyhow and I want you to pay attention to what I'll be reading a few scripture a lot of scriptures and quotes and and I pray that God gives you the revelation of it let's bow our head one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord in the name of Jesus Christ I commit the service into your hand father every aspect of the service I give it to you Lord starting with me here to The Interpreter to everyone in the congregation all the way in the back lord Jesus father Lord every Spirit of distraction every Spirit that's going to hinder the service I rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ Lord I pray that you have your prominence in the service father you made an appointment with us that you will be with us this morning Lord and Lord we take you at your word and we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats like I said so the title is for we are not ignorant of his devices and I don't know is the projector working I'll continue by if you can please um keep it up so um Paul is telling us that if we are ignorant of how Satan operates Satan has an advantage of us like for instance if we go to war and your enemy has an atomic weapon but you have a knife and if you go to war with a knife versus someone who has an atomic weapon then he's obviously going to win the prophet says that every country has they have spies why because they we even see that even in in the Book of Joshua they send those pies to go uh to go uh uh check spy the land you know and then some came with a good report and other came with a bad report so we need to know how Satan operates in order for us to also have an advantage over and many times Satan hide Satan likes to hide and brother Bram says that when that's that's when that's why when you have certain sins in your life if you hide the devil you don't confess that demon still has power over you the prophet says uh when you confess your sin it's like those grips those nails that you have the that the has they get cut so he can't hurt you anymore that's that's why the prophet says he's just a bluff making all the noise but he cannot do anything but he takes Revelation to know how Satan operates because the prophet says that it took the seals to be broken in order for us to know the true meaning of the serpent seed Satan he tried to he came in at first in if you read the seals in first se he came in as a white horse a man on a white trying to impersonate the uh Jesus Christ and he he had to take the lamb to open the book to reveal revealed to us that that person was the Antichrist and like I said my subtitle will be the woman so this morning I'll will be talking a lot to the sisters why because the prophet says if you want to know how spiritual a church is look at the women in the church you know let's go to the that that quotes real quick it's the SEC the third [Music] slide um yeah so the the prophet says uh it's the no second slide but like number three by second slide if you go be one more the prophet said if you want to know where the church is standing watch the women watch the morals among the women cu she's a representation of the church when you see the pollution among the women you find the pollution in the church so if we want to know where Higher Ground is standing we just have to look at the sisters in the church because the prophet says the church is a woman so this morning we are pretty much also inspecting the level of spirituality of higher ground ground you know because the prophet also say if you want to know a man the true man's character just look at his wife the choice that a man makes for his wife says a lot about that person amen the pro the prophet says that the bride that a man would choose is going to reflect his character he reflect what in him that's why we need we I mean for all especially for all the single brothers that are here we need to be careful on what choice we need to make it's one thing to come up here and say that you are a Christian but then the choice of a wife that you pick will let us know truly what what what your character is amen amen so we'll see how Satan is working through the woman and he's coming in the church he's com in the church and we also see that uh uh uh Paul said that but if we are ignorant you know of his devices then he has an advantage of us ignorance is the absence of knowledge when you are not knowledgeable about something then you are ignorant of it you know the Bible says that my people perish for lack of knowledge so even God said that my people perish for lack of knowledge I think it's in the book of Hosea lack of knowledge and let's go to proverb chapter 7 where the Bible is talking about a young man who who was void of understanding Proverbs Chapter 7 verse 4 says say unto wisdom Thou Art my sister verse four say unto wisdom thou are my sister and call understanding thy King's woman amen so that they may keep thee from the strange woman from The Stranger which flattereth with her words why am I talking about the woman because the prophet says that there are three things that can get a man of God to fall he said it's popularity you know it's women and it's money know and he gave an example Samson it was a woman Del like that got Samson a man of God to fall so the prophet is saying that Satan uses women also as a tool to get men of God to fall the Bible says that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair and took them as wives [Music] so we that's why we need to be careful brothers let's continue so verse proverbs four uh uh seven it says that so that they may keep thee from the strange woman from The Stranger which flattereth with her words so Solomon is saying that wisdom and understanding will preserve you from that from that strange woman for at the window of my house I look through my casement verse 6 verse six is it and verse S and beheld among the simple ones I discern among the youths a young man void of understanding so young Brothers Solomon is talking he saw a young man that was void of understanding you know let's keep reading and passing through the street near her corner and he went the way to her house for the sake of time because it's a lengthy scripture let me skip to verse 24 he says hearken unto me now thereof therefore oh ye children and attend to the words of my mouth verse 24 let not thy heart decline to her ways go not astray in her path for she has cast down many wounds indeed yeah many strong men have been slain by her so you notice it's saying many strong men have been slain by her so it doesn't matter how strong you think you are you need to be careful with a woman especially an ungodly woman verse 27 her house is the way to Hell going down to the chambers of death so if this uh if this woman is such a powerful tool to the hands of Satan then how is he working on her the prophet says the prophet says that an ungodly woman can cast millions of millions of souls to hell that's why in Hollywood in every like all the advertisement the woman is always featured as the main character because that's Satan's greatest weapon especially in this generation it's such a great weapon that the prophet says that the woman is the god of these evil age it's such a grateful weapon that Satan decided to make the woman the God of this age and it takes understanding to escaped that woman in the message marriage and divorce paragraph 121 the prophet says but in the human race it's the woman that's pretty not the man if he is there is something wrong there is crossed up seed somewhere notice the prophet use the word pretty not handsome there's a difference between hands handsome and pretty pretty pretty that's more for women when you see a man that looks so beautiful like a woman the prophet is saying there is something wrong there is crossed up seeds somewhere you know he says originally it's that way why was it done it was it was to deceive by right so the prophet is saying the woman was made a certain way to be a tool of Satan to deceive and he says her designer Satan her designer is Satan and he's still working on her in these last days so Satan is not taking PTO on working on the woman the prophet says that God let Satan design the woman you know and Satan is always featured in beauty and my key word here is that so first you have to understand that your designer is Satan and that he is still working on you when in these last days the prophet didn't say he stopped working and we'll go on and show you how Satan is still operating on the woman and sisters I want you to make the difference between a sister and just a woman so just identify yourself with the word don't say that don't say that I called you something evil or anything like I'm not talking about you I'm talking about the ungodly woman but you are Daughters of God only when you stay with the word but when you want to pattern after God of this evil age then you these quotes apply to you and and and and and and and another thing I want to bring up to you it's not I'm not even addressing you I'm addressing the spirit that's behind you because the prophet says that they have a evil spirit on them but they don't even know it the prophet says when you see women working walking outside with shorts and all that they have a demon that's anointing them but they don't know it the key word says they don't know it's so lack of understanding but now we want the words to expose that that [Music] demon in Psalm chapter 139:14 the Bible says I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made I am fearfully and wonderfully made Psalm 139 verse 14 sorry maybe next time I'll translate all these words probably that'll make it easier verse 14 you know cuz now we have people they are no longer content of how God created us and that's how Satan is creeping in especially to the woman you showing you that you are not made the way you should be made the prophet says he's gotten into Hollywood and that's setting the standard for our women now Hood but in order instead of us going back to the scripture that says I am fearfully and wonderfully made we are no longer content of how God created us you know the the the the the prophet says that the the beauty of the Lord is in Holiness and power sisters I'm not against you look trying to look pretty that's a normal thing for you to [Music] do the prophet says you were made to be beautiful and he saids it's a normal thing for a woman to want to be beautiful but we want to make sure that we are beautiful according to what the word says beautiful is not according to what Satan calls beautiful the beauty beuty of the Lord is in Holiness when you dress you need to dress in Holiness it's the next quotes uh it's in the message they identify Christ of all age he says not in paint not in paint here and powder and short and everything else that they're trying to wear and do it it's in beauty of the Holiness and righteousness why because we are not of this world this world they have their own God this image this woman that Satan has put them and told them this is your example but we are of of the Heavenly Kingdom and God is telling us that we need to look beautiful according to the in Holiness and righteousness we are from we are from a kingdom that's above you know and Paul is saying also in first Timothy I'm just laying the foundation real quick so in first Timothy 2 ver9 in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefastness and sobriety not with broaded hair or gold or pearls or costly array so Timothy is telling us that the woman needs to Adorn himself you need to to look modest and every time you want to buy clothes online just refer back to the scripture does this align with modesty why because you are reflecting the Church of Higher Ground if the world want to see how spiritual Higher Ground is the according to the prophet they should look at the women you know even in the in the vision that the prophet saw of the Bride you know he the prophet almost began crying when he saw he thought thought that the first bride was the bride that he preached about because she was dressed so immodest to the point that the prophet felt like he failed his entire Ministry Brothers our ministry will be a failure if the sisters in this church don't align with the word of God the prophet says that a true uh Revival is getting the trash out of out of your lives in order for the power of God to move in this church we need to get rid of all the trash and when I'm talking don't don't point at a specific sister or brother look at yourself because we all have things that the Lord wants to give R of Our Lives you know if you show the the the stats the next stats to show you that Satan is still working on the woman like the prophet said uh I it's probably not clear enough for you to see but it's showing that um those are what they call um uh bbls like the plastic surgeries like women they are no longer content of how God made them now they want Satan is like I got to make you in a way that's more appealing to to to to get the sons of God so we see that um in 2019 the total procedures for like plastic surgeries were 11 Millions 11 million and then in 20 and then in 20 2022 it went up to 14 Millions what are they doing they're doing Leos suction lios section is when you take a certain F of the body and you put it somewhere else and then what was the number two surgery done in the US breast augmentation you know at first it was 1 million and it went up to 2 million and I can share this with you after service why is that because women they are no longer content of how they were created why because Satan has put an image of what an ungodly woman is like and now all the women instead of looking what the word says they should be like they want a pattern after what Satan is giving them if you go to the next two the one after the one it's another not this one the next one this this is a a research that I made and it says with the rise of social media social media bad augmentation has has been T tedly Ted by influencers and celebrities who often refute any claims of getting work work done there's influencers and celebrities you see how Satan is evolving the prophet says that first he began with television Vision I was reading a quote this morning the prophet says that the devil was like I know how I'll get them I'll set Television right in their house and what is he doing with television he's giving you his program but the prophet said Satan always keeps evolving he's still working now now he created social media now it's no longer just at home on the big screen now it's on your phones and what is he doing he setting what the world we call Stars a star is a reflection of a light you know the star reflects the light of the Sun and we also know that Satan also was was was was a star and there were stars in heaven but those stars were Fallen brother bam says that the spirit in order for a spirit to work they need a human body in order to dwell in and Satan is getting those stars like the Kardashian Clan they said notably notably members of the Kardashian Clan have famously contributed to the procedure's popularity with their hourglass figures what they call is what they call like when a woman has a shape of like a they call it a shape of a Coca-Cola bottle [Music] and so it says that bbls became more popular in the US in the middle of the last [Music] decade the Society of plastic surgeons called 2015 another year of the rear and so in 2015 there were bad o procedures such as such as lift implant performed every 30 minutes coincidently 2015 was the year after Kim Kardashian in famous um internet breaking cover of paper magazines coinci and in the in the cover magazine she was showing her behind and I'll read what this one young woman says her name was Brian she said Brian said that as a young black teen in the late 90s no in the late 90s and early 2000s Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez were the women of the hour their bodies were perceived as the ideal pausing as a star contrast to the mainstream culture of flatb Brian felt like she lacked an hourglass figure and wanted a natural looking BBL to feel more womanly Brian so in order for her to feel more womanly she had to look like beyon or Jennifer Lopez this was just talking about the influence of those celebrities the influence of social media and we have a lot of young daughter young sisters here in the church unfortunately who patterns after after Hollywood too and sometimes it can be an unconscious things you're not trying to purposely pattern after them but it's just the world that we're living in but I'm telling you it's the devil that's working on the woman why the prophet says to deceive by to deceive who to deceives the sons of God when the prophet says in these last days that's one of the signs of the return of the Lord the prophet says women be becoming more prettier because Satan understand that his time is running out and he's working over time to try to deceive as many sons of God as possible you know in the message influence the prophet says it's become a joking and a carry on Hollywood glamour now Hollywood through television has took the pulpit over our women has bowed to the goddess of fashion of Hollywood the Hollywood then the pulpit got into Hollywood through singers and so forth talented men oh how a shrewd man the devil is so you noce the devil he takes those people that have a lot of talent you know the beyon of the world uh Elvis Presley those are people that were given God given talent but unfortunately they sold that talent to the devil why to carry out his agenda to to get the sons of God to fall and the prophecy say our women not their women but our women has bowed to the goddess of fashion back I'm like if you do your research back back in the days women used to not be wearing tight tight fitting [Music] clothes the prophet has talked so many times against Kennedy's wives saying that all the women were looking at her as an example now so the prophet saying Satan always used one person that he puts there as a figure and everybody now is looking that's my example and with the coming of Hollywood women start wearing tight fitting clothes and unfortunately we even see that in the church we should let the world copy the world but we Christians shouldn't copy the world why because the prophet says that our kingdom is from above we have a kingdom that's higher than what this world can offer and remember that the Bible says that you will respond for adultery with the man that uh that lost it after you when you wear those tight fing clothes you yourself you know that those clothes are very tight and especially with the African wom they built a different way when you wear those tight fitting clothes you are committing a you you're going to respond for adultery with the man that's going to all us even in the church there is a quote I don't know if I have it in my notes Here the prophet is saying that how when you see a woman walking in the church twisting with tight Feit and clothes and he says everybody turns to look at her even the preacher it disrupts the service so if the way you dress can disrupt the service this morning I think I might have said that in the morning especially for the brother sitting in the back you the sister sitting in the front with tight Feit and clothes we have so many battles out there in the world why do we have to come fight battles in the church those are the things we need to worry outside but not in the Church of the Living God you know we are supposed to be a family we are supposed to be helping each others sisters you are not helping the brothers because you just make them having tougher battles now instead of PR singing nothing but the blood got to worry I don't want to I don't want to look down what is that it's the devil the the prophet says that the woman is a nice woman I don't say she's demoralized but the thing of it is there is an honary filthy Spirit that's on her it's making her do that but she don't know it he says you are pretty but if you haven't got the Holy Spirit there to protect those morals you you would have been better to be so ugly nobody would have even looked at you and went to [Music] heaven so he saying you are pretty that's a good to be pretty but you need the Holy Spirit in order for you to use that prettiness in a good way because he says that if you don't have the Holy Spirit and you are pretty the prophet said it would even be better for you to be ugly that is a strong statement beauty is deceiving beauty is vain it's it's a good thing for you sisters to be beautiful but what do you call Beautiful do you call beautiful what Hollywood calls beautiful or do you call beautiful what the word calls beautiful the bride of Christ will not pattern after the world the bride of Christ will be the word the bride of Christ will say Amen to the word the Bri brother brother says that she will be just like him you are the reflection of this church and and then God had to give you that responsibility he did not let man be a reflection give you sisters to reflect your husband to reflect this church so if you truly love your husband you don't want to reflect him in a bad way because according to the prophet don't look at the man just look at the wife you know um you know the prophet says the girls and the young ladies they pattern after Hollywood I'm just going to skip this and I'll read this one the prophet says the invasion is on it's sweeping from house to house from place to place from church to church from man to man Brothers The Invasion is on let's not close our eyes and being ignorant of it because it's coming to your house because it's going from house to house and if you are blind then you let that devil creep into your house without even recognizing that it's and I was listening to another message this morning where the Prophet says it's it's actually not the woman's fault it's the man's fault especially for married couples because the prophet says you were to be the ruler of your house you know let me just read that real quick here uh so you know I'm taking it from the prophet I think I heard it if you go to the message it's not on the slides but if you go to the message painted face Jezebel paragraph 27 he says but but you little weekly men I am ashamed of you as Christian brothers that we let your wife do such a thing as that he shows what you are made out of he says now women you ought to say Amen after fasting at you like that cuz he is the ruler he says you ought to say amen after I fasted you like that because the man is the ruler he said he said that's right the way he let you live it's his fault and God is going to hold him responsible for it if you a enough to take up and put your own house in order say God be merciful to you cuz the Bible said in the very beginning that he shall rule over thee and the prophet says now sees not a doormat now she is your sweetheart so there's a certain way you also talk to your wife about how she needs to dress uh there's a certain way you talk to your wife about how she needs to dress the prophet says this is how you do it you should sit down and talk to her and reason it with her what does reason mean that means you also give your partner room to explain herself wife this is what the word says what do you think about let her speak to and tell her and read the Bible don't just tell her it's wrong but show her where it's [Music] wrong and the most important thing that people forget the prophet said and pray together so after today's sermon when you go home you talk to your wife it's just you need to pray together because why do you need to pray because the the war that we fighting is not against flesh and blood but it's against principalities she's anointed by demons without knowing it in order for those demons to go you need to pray amen amen so the prophet is saying the invasion is on is going from house to house he said what is it it's the devil it's the devil The Invasion he swept into this nation like a roaring lion you know he sat down there in the best place they had in Holly and what did he say he said I can't get the movies here until the television comes on so Satan is sitting in Hollywood and how is he doing the prophet saying he's using television nowaday he's even using social media you know I was reading on the Ser I was working on a sermon called the the word diet where the Prophet says you be you what you feed on says a lot about what you are if you he say if you constantly feed on those worldly music those bad movies he says a lot about what you are Satan has placed himself in Hollywood and through those movies you are constantly feeding on him and what and there's a say that says you become what you eat the more you feed on Satan you become like Satan but the more you feed on the word you become the word and and we have to know that it's only one thing that can expose Satan it's the word of God that's why I'm reading all this because I I could just be skipping but I want you to if you can take notes and you go home and you also study that because these things are very important you know we we need to we need to clean the church we need to clean our houses because we want God to be welcome the prophet Compares a life full of sin to like a toilet that's that is so stinking so imagine you inviting Christ into your house but your house is stinking and Christ is just there the whole time like so uncomfortable so he said let's clean let's clean that trash out of our Lives now I'm going to switch to a different aspect of it I will talk about the high heels shoes and I will show in the scripture and what the prophet also says about it and again if you can take notes that will actually be nice no if you can take notes that will be a nice thing let's go to the book of Isaiah chapter 3: 16 chapter three if you go to chapter three is verse so the Bible says moreover the Lord saith because the daughters of Zion are howdy and walk with straight forth necks and want on eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet yeah so you have to understand that the prophet says that prophets back in the days they only had to use the words that were available to them in their dictionaries for instance if you go to the the N chapter 2:4 the Bible says the Chariots shall rage in the streets they shall jle one against another in Broad ways [Music] the Chariots shall rage in the streets they shall just to one against another just means like to bump against each other in the broad ways they shall seem like torches and they shall run like the lightings the prophet says that n was talking about modern day cars but he didn't know how to call them like for instance the prophet Isaiah that say that the Jews will get back on the wings of an [Music] eagle you know so he didn't he didn't know that those things will be called an airplane he just used eagle or bird sorry and naom is also talking about the Chariots but in other way the prophet is telling us this is the description of a car so why did I say all that to show you that Isaiah also he's talking about something else here but he's just using what the words he could use during his time so let's let's actually let's go into details about this verse 16 go back to the previous verse so three yeah so it says moreover the Lord says because the daughters of Zion are howdy says yeah because the daughter because the daughters of Zion says that they are howy 316 so in French he even use the better word he even says or but in English is used the word howy and if you go two slides after that the definition of how it means to bloodly and dis disdainfully [Music] proud having or showing an attitude of superiority and contempt for people or things perceived to be inferior show so whatever these Daughters of Zion there were something that they were wearing that was making them feel Superior Wasing them they were they were and the prophet says and they walk I mean the Bible says they walk with stretch forth necks and want eyes so they had something was changed about them the word the prophet used the word pitched over so their neck was uh stretched forth and then walking and mincing as they go no no uh it's so the French translation is kind of missing a few words to like it's not as detail as the English translation but we stick with the version that the prophet used because the prophet preach on this verse as well he says walking and means sing as as they go exact that's the word so what is what is the word what does mincing mean can you go to the definition of the word [Music] mincing uh go a few slides after it's like the third one after that okay I'll continue so meaning means it occurs the it says it occurs in the prophets description of the behavior of the daughters of [Music] Jerusalem the Hebrew word as well as the AR Arabic uh refers to the taking small steps and quick steps Arabic the affected PA of a coish woman the way a coish woman works that's the meaning makes her way walk the same way and it says it's like the modern practice of swaying the body in walk so these Daughters of Zion were wearing things that were making their body uh uh uh sway in a certain way so it was a normal normal shoes that were making them do that and you see that he says that he was it was making a tinkling with their feet have you ever noticed when a woman wears a high heel suit in a place where it's so quiet in a pavement somewhere tinkling with the feet that's what Isaiah saw and the prophet I I'll read the quotes in in a short here so walking and meaning they go so there's just something I don't know women you you maybe you can attest to this but there's something about when you were high heel shoes you just feel it gives you that certain confidence that certain Pride about yourself it just makes you prideful it's the spirit that on it and the let's let's see where the Prophet refers to the scripture again let's go to the mage is the Kinsman redeem Redeemer it's a quote after this the prophet says a woman that's beautiful that beauty will fade just as sure as you give it a few years maybe today she's twisting down the street some little half-dressed woman sending more souls to Hell than all the B rooms in the country this is what I said earlier like a Godly woman can send he's sending more souls to Hell than all the barrooms in the country one woman she'll twist herself down the street thinking she is something the prophet says as the Bible says they'll have stretch out necks one Mining and the prophet says that means twisting as they go so the prophet agrees with the definition we just read that mining means that they are twisting as they are walking yeah yeah that's the word right so I'm just going to skip a few because I'm running out of time um okay let's go to the message it is the rising of the sun we're still talking about the high heels let's see what the prophet actually says about it uh in the message it is the rising of the sun I think it's uh if you keep going if you yeah there we go it's going to be a lengthy quotes but pay close attention to this is very important you think that those high heels oh it's just something small but they can lead you to hell because disobeying the word of the Prophet The Prophet says uh my own mother she's gone on now she was a very oldd woman you know about half in Indian she was odd she was a person that didn't dream she would only have four or five dreams all over her life but every time she dreamed the dream it was true she had a dream and it was true he says I remember one time when I first started preaching many years ago I was preaching right here at this church and she dreamed a dream that I was standing here by the side of three steps and I was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the [Music] highway so the prophet in that dream is like there is a highway this is the highway but in order to get in the highway there are three [Music] steps and on the highway is a little pearly like white line so there is a highway but in the highway there is a a little white line that narrow way and he says the line runs right into the doors of Heaven and the Pearl had been stretched out to the top of the steps so let's say for instance so Heaven is on the wall there and all this is the highway but in the middle there's a line a small line that's going from Heaven straight to the to those three steps so the prophet was saying in order to even be on your way to heaven you got to go through those three steps first and he says if that am my message exactly today if that that is not my message exactly today justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I was saying that a person has to come by this three steps to be able to walk the highway and he says there was a lady that came by now you know what kind of shoes people were 35 years ago there was a lady come by and had on Great Big pair like they were today Spike heel shoes the that that woman was wearing Spike heeled shoes and she come by and I said wait a minute sister he says you can't walk the highway with that you can't do that the prophet is saying you cannot walk in the highway to Heaven with those high he and what did the lady said and she said ah she said looked around at the right of the women and say don't believe him he is a mad man so this morning I'm telling you you cannot be walking on your way to heaven with those high heel shoes you will fall eventually but it depend you either take the attitude of this woman or you take the attitude of The Godly woman because everything I've told you today I took it from the prophet himself and he says don't believe him he's a mad man I'll show you I can be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and still walk that so in another way say I can show you that I can't go to heaven wearing these shoes I can't get the Holy Ghost I can't get justification sanctification don't believe that man he's [Music] mad and you know this Prophet says I just let her go I couldn't do no more about it sisters they get to a point where if the word has been said so time after time and you don't listen he'll just let you go he says I couldn't stop her that's don't ever get to that place where the word cannot stop you anymore the prophet says that God is not going to keep knocking on your door time there will be a time that will be his last time to knock at your door and she jumped up on the highway she looked back at the sister and said see I told you so she was able to get on the highway but it's not about how you start it's how you finish many people have studied have studied they gotten Justified satified but they didn't go all the way to the baptism of the there will be many people that say have I not preached in your name have I not healed at your name but Jesus will say depart from me because I never knew you who are those people those people that ignored the the the word of the prophet of the age she thought she knew better than the prophet always that prideful spirit that anoints anoints those kindful women see I told you and he says you know as the Bible said in Isaiah 5th chapter that they would have outstretch necks the prophet says they have to why because they are pitched over so if you can go to par uh the slide 42 I will show you what what does the prophet means that they are peached Peach is like they have been changed so you can see there's a difference this is a me on the left it's a woman without high heels right is a woman with heels high heels actually highlight the curves of the woman if you notice it's actually highlighting the breast the hip the the the um uh the the the breast and especially the behind go to the next one again that's another image pitched over she's been changed this is the straight woman but this heels are making her peached she's her form is changed well I go to the next one how is so normally we are this is z degrees I mean uh uh yes 90° I guess so when when you wear high heels you supposed to kind of lean forward as if but according to the laws of gravity gravity you are supposed to fall if you wear the high heels you you you're leaning as if you were about to fall that's why we have to now we have to deform to pit the body and then you are like this and then your breast is coming forth and your behind is going out that's why the prophet says they have been peached this is you are peached over you are the devil Satan is designing the woman amen let's go back to that course I was reading earlier preached over you know so meaning and then he says they have to they have to twist meaning as they go Prophet now interpret says making a tinkling with their heels who are those the daughters of Zion in the last day we are singing We Are Mar into Z but you are not going to reach Zion if you keep wearing those high heels because you will fall let's continue the story The Prophet says again the next quote so and she started up the highway just as hard as she could run and after a while the road got narrower and narrower sister reing meaning like that and off she went and mother said the horriblest screams that I ever heard in my life was that woman falling into those flames and smoke going down like that and said I turned around and said see the prophet she she just obeyed everything but one word everything by one word and she failed it the prophet says and I said she I said see she would have went on in all right but she failed to listen fa to listen to to telling her what was ahead okay and I'll end with this um uh this one quote where the Prophet is talking also about the prophet also saw another woman but this wasn't the vision of the Bride he saw two women two w two Brides the Godly bride and the Bride of Satan now I want you when you read this identify yourself what are you feeding with let's read that let's read that question birth pains paragraph 205 and I was to have a preview of the church and I was taken by someone who I could not see I was set up on like a stand and I heard the sweetest music I ever heard and I looked coming and a bunch of little ladies about looked to be some age around 28 18 20 and they all had they all had long hair and was fixed in different dresses type of dresses thank you they were marching just as perfectly in step with the music as it could be and they went from my left going around this way so this is he's talking about the good bride now in the next paragraph he says then I heard a rock and roll band coming so notice that music is also very important because a sweet he said a sweet music was accompanying the Bride of Jesus Christ the Bride of Satan was forign by rock and roll band coming so even in the church we need to be careful what kind of music we play [Music] we at home what kind of listen we listen to Because those those music also the the King Nebuchadnezzar when he wanted to the people to worship the the the the idol the Bible say the first step was to play music first so I don't know but there is something about music that even when the prophet saw that Vision music was accompanying the the two brides and when I looked over to my right side coming up this way here come churches of World each one carrying their Banner from where they were from so it wasn't about oh this is this is my culture we do things this way no no every culture was represented there some of the dirtiest looking things I've ever seen in my life and then when the American Church come up it was the awfulest I have ever seen the heavenly father is my judge they had on these TL tail gray skirts like one of those barroom girls with no back on it up here and holding like a gray looking piece of paper and like H dancing so the prophet is saying that this dirty bride the Bride of Satan was walking to the beat of rock and roll and she was dancing a dance like hola dancing so when I saw that I was like let me go check what the hoola dancing is like so can you please project show them um if you go to media and then you um select whoa dancing so you see how they dancing the whoa dancing you just keep playing it again oh it's bugging but it's a dance where they are shaking their hips can you try to just yeah you see how they dance sing that's what the prophet saw that that dirty bride was dancing now if you go to the dance that we all know called M can you play that isn't it even worse than the hoola dancing it's actually the same dance but this is just a little bit worse and the prophet is telling you that he saw the Bride of Satan was dancing to this kind of music their hips so he probably saw the even the Bride of Congo maybe dancing M the dirty bride of Satan the Cong bride dancing and we call it culture I am not against culture but culture should not supered the word of God word of God must come first if your culture is making you do what the prophet saw the Bride of Satan do then you need to throw it away what we are doing is we are exposing the work of Satan and many of us have done it by ignorance but now the word has come and the word has told you that brother bam actually saw a d you know he he used the word like hola dancing so he didn't say it was exactly hola he just saw a dance that looked like hula dancing so anything of that manner where they were shaking the heaps that was the Bride of Satan so you need to stop dancing mut you know I'm not I'm not telling you what you what what you need to do but it's up to you to see if you want to identify with the bride of Christ or if you want identify with the bride of Satan but I know that me and my house We Shall Serve the Lord you need to come to that realization yourself that you and your house you will be with the bride of Christ know he said with paint short bobbed hair smoking cigarettes and the last part of is and I stood there looking she passed on by and you can you can imagine the back part of her with nothing on holding this in front of her she went Shing like that the prophet keeps in what is Shing the if you look up the definition of the shimi dance is it's a it's an American dance marked by shaking of the hips and shoulders so the prophet seems like everything you saw about the dirty bride was just involved in a dance where she was moving her hips by like that to this twist throwing her limbs out like that it says he was vulgar how she was caring on her body shaking around like that if the brother called that vulgar what he saw back then I also say it's vulgar today this is cleaning up times we need to clean ups in our Liv those High heill shoes go home and throw them out because you are housing Satan in your house and when you come in the church you wear those things you are also uh bringing Satan in the church and why why is Satan doing that he's doing that to to deceive the sons of God he's using you women as the his tool why are you letting Satan use you as as his tool instead of letting God use you as his tool God is looking for daughters of God daughters who fear God daughters who want to addess modest daughters who who say like Mary Let It Be unto me according to Thy Word so I really pray that you know it wasn't preaching it was just exposing the the the devil in the lives of sisters but the prophet put it back on the brothers he said it's actually not a sister's fault it's the brothers he said because you are letting them go out like that you are supposed to be you are supposed to be the ruler of your house so today when you go home go rule your house the way you were meant to rule your house we all claim to be Believers of the message the messages told us that you cannot make you to heaven wearing high heels are we trying to go to hell I don't think there's anybody here why would you come to church if your goal is to go to hell if your goal is to go to hell then don't come here and and affect someone else then just go go outside there the house of God is a house of cor correction the word has corrected us and the Holy Spirit is saying that we need to clean our lives we need to clean this church because you are reflecting the bride of Christ in this city in every city God has a in every place God has a witness you know God is when other people will be like oh but we never know God will be like I had set a witness there in that town it's not it's not a coincidence that you found yourself here in Iowa City God brought you here because he wanted the world to see that there are still women that will dress according to the word amen amen you may stand I trust this was a blessing to you and and like the prophet said you know you need it takes prayer for you to if the prophet says that one thing is bad I don't know if I have this code he says but if you if you don't pray it will do you nothing you know you need to pray in order for God to reveal to you I can come here and preach I can come here and preach but if that not revealed to you it's not going to do you [Music] anything the light beautiful light shine where the do drops of Mercy [Music] bright oh shine
