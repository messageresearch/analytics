word glad to have everybody here we're going to ask that you turn with us to judges the 16th chapter the loneliness of this user versus we're going to just read one scripture there one passage of scripture the lord but first scripture and samson called unto the lord and said oh lord remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once o god that i might be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes [Music] foreign look for fourth chapter we're going to read the 18 to the 19th verse the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captive and recovering of the sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised 19 verse to preach the acceptable year of the lord [Music] thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord you have been better to us and we thank you for that we pray lord this morning that we may be able to see where we are is amen amen if i was to entitle this message i will entitle it the last mystery of we know by god's grace that we're living in the last days brother preach to the message and his condition is he said we are living off of tax money that will be paid in 40 years from today the nation is broken is and the church will loan is see you bible readers can teach that in your church and here we are a federation of churches the first beast is that great god [Music] there is a possibility that we could do the same thing don't see the vision if we could only see a vision of a possibility and he was paralleling it uh [Music] because you have to the blind the acceptable year of the lord and he says jesus christ when they gave him the scroll he read this scripture and he stopped in that other part of the scripture what hallelujah [Applause] to cover of the lord trees of righteousness the planting of the lord hallelujah jesus christ himself jesus christ in the word of god living in a dangerous time through a prophet [Applause] nobody [Music] his word thessalonians 5 21 where it is written prove all things move how fast that which is good is is which is good now if this message is [Applause] as quick as you can get away from it hallelujah paul hallelujah foreign [Applause] seven mysterious standards i love your family that's not even written at all that's right and i believe that through those what [Music] we can't earth every of is and i'm going to hallelujah presuming what they were in the tribulation is says there is a false church and a [Music] you gotta have a magnifying glass and that is has it's the life that they live it came to pass afterward that he loved the woman in the valley of sorak now that word yellow hallelujah is that all right correct and i want you to understand the word right an enticing spirit we understand by god's grace amen what what god was actually doing every dot came up unto her and said unto her fifth verse entice him and she will in his great strength and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred uh is characters but yet there's an enticing spirit that it is it's a religious spirit that knows the word hallelujah [Music] it's thing now everybody goes to the store by apples that those are not really apples is that right this is [Music] is hallelujah tell me i pray thee where is thy great strength wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee understand and relaxed she has so much confidence give me some money then shall i be weak and be as another man with that spirit hallelujah is which means vines green vines which had not been dried and they bound him with them just a is that he had already been bewitched she was being it could be something that was the words for example paul said unto the galatians who have bewitched you hallelujah and all the galatians were doing they were taking circumcision [Music] what was [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah once more of jesus three months [Music] hidden within the brains the locks hallelujah because listen that was discovered hallelujah hallelujah is and he was a strong [Applause] hallelujah working in the [Music] is the power of god [Applause] is who's walking in the midst of the seven golden candles is the holy ghost is they didn't now we know what happened on the zuzu street menace about 60 percent everybody thought that was the the restoration of the whole thing but that was just the restoration of the gifts somebody help me here mercy but christ himself could not be fully restored hallelujah [Music] is is brought [Music] and i'm going to jump for more time you say you love me your mighty get your memo hallelujah and every time i look around hey trust you is your confidence and you're still lying to you but it was delilah who was lying to him samson and delilah represents the false church representatives hallelujah oh come on somebody amen you said that ain't true when when when the pentecostals fail remember brother said those penecostals were his children hallelujah they were his children he said this is somebody helped me here amen and what happened demonstration hallelujah failed to delilah hallelujah you understand he was called i believe the king or the prince and he fell to delilah amen amen and what happened he swept the whole upc quest you're not in pentecostals and from that point on apart she was still working on samson hallelujah amen because remember every time samson told her so-called a when they were aimed at and relax touch your faces the spirit thought that they had the church in bondage when they thought they had sampson amen when they thought they had the church in a weak place her intent is that right you got to understand him in the early church because you got to realize by god's grace that was a powerful story in this story hallelujah he didn't grab a spear in a puppy in lunch or or some kind of sword in a machete but he grabbed a jawbone he was used to peeling see god can use anything hallelujah [Music] he conquered everything he was a one-man invasion he possess the gates of his enemy when he said i take everything under my contract hallelujah amen but look at us now regardless [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] understand you've heard so much well i heard a snake crawl up on me and you don't even know till you see them stick in there you didn't know i was going there [Music] is [Music] where your strength lies i don't know why people pray with the telephone owner if you're going to pray you have to cut that telephone hallelujah amen now you are in a battle now [Applause] is glory yes you're so innocent innocent but that white white horse rider we know what it ended up being dead hallelujah is that all right and you and i know how this thing becomes political oh but you know what happened hallelujah during that time but not sit down when she bind his head that was a time when you saw luther and wesley and all those great intellectuals is hallelujah amen and i don't know how many soldiers was among the philistines but they told delilah did you bring him down we'll all give [Music] many of them didn't have churches because the spirit of delilah is among us hallelujah like i said i'm just going to preach it now [Music] blind that's why i love judging so much because remember just a few lessons ago uh i told you how judah was part of israel with the philistines why we're in a place right now is so vermont placement according to judges every man was right in his own eyes and those of us who can see know that everybody is not right back here tomorrow hello amen y'all getting quiet on me now even in this message if you can remember that's around this message y'all don't have to say amen i know it's true it's your second i've traveled almost to all over the world you got two souls you got perugia you got thunders hallelujah you got all of these cats should i call names we shall listen we've got all these great preachers everybody is running after them and understand they're complaining i'm not saying they all do [Music] [Applause] somebody hallelujah somebody help me nyc so you can understand what companion i'm not here for no no other reason jesus declared that jesus christ my covenant those seven thunders it's some idea hallelujah see but what people don't understand circulation they compensate right now when you say seven thunders [Music] revelation [Applause] hallelujah amen don't you understand the company regardless of what they've [Music] [Music] i could not interpret it has something to do with the comments see everybody think well i don't wanna pass that when jesus comes there's gonna be a giant jesus coming i am [Applause] [Music] this is not a group revelation [Music] just all of the great companies in america totally grand companies have made an alliance with the pope all [Applause] you can believe this corona virus if you want to you know it's amazing how virus can even change his name hallelujah i got a name change what about you you shouldn't it was it was it was moses said when the moses asked god what's your name he said tell them i am that's why the jewish jewish people could never never pronounce his real name [Music] hallelujah so what happens she finally tells him and he goes into what we call a blindness church leglesses but understand we got twins working here those of all they make their vices one false and one truth so when there was a portion there was a in that scripture it looked like samson had come to his end there was another portion show that samson was just coming to his beginning to kill the philistines so you'll see the mystery of these seven seals but it was growing look so weak never near possibilities this message looks so weak so fable see like it does come right now amen oh you don't have to say amen you don't have to say it it's true anyhow we got people amen who's committing adultery and fornication and stealing and lying and drinking and losing follicles this way is a way of holiness amen this way is a way of holiness hallelujah is no doubt he called back the days when he was first illuminated and then samson said hey lord remember me say yeah [Music] that the world of the philistine was coming to destruction your brother brown said you gotta die and rot from our medical foreign you know we understand that the death is riding okay is that right death is riding right now it's a spiritual death spiritual hallelujah amen is that right brother brown said you can do a thing so much god says that's enough jesus christ you think everybody knows do you think the pentecostal church know they did look on youtube they're shouting dancing he does they're speaking in tongues supposedly interpretations hallelujah amen and they are growing it is what's remarkable did you know that the the the god the philistines actually worshipped with degas they're growing in numbers from my number hallelujah amen that's how they killed us second second hallelujah amen is that right yes in closing listen he said samson did he get some song was the main event i had people doing all kinds of tricks let me see this job visit everything but the main event man living him up was about since i mentioned fornication adultery and things like that sad face you listen if it doesn't affect you say hallelujah but some of y'all looking like y'all [Music] [Music] see you got to realize we're talking about spiritual blindness hallelujah amen amen it's a do of the word not just a hero of the world so you can understand amen by god's grace god means business folks [Music] and you and i know that samson slew more in his death than he did in his lifetime you said brother i don't know about this let me read a quote from brother branham and oh lord just once more in phone calls today he said and my subject like this morning is to what state that i think the pentecostal church is of this day now let us quote that again to say it like this all of us know that we cannot make a rapture in this condition just like samson knew he could not please god shall come somewhere the world to get him into the condition almost all of us if not [Music] unless you cry out [Music] that's but you gotta have a revelation i know that there is a possibility there's a impossibility is that the truth you still have everything see that's the mystery because why samson's hair was growing [Music] got enough strength to at least walk and then push to push the grinder this message got to be more than a church service somebody help me here how are we going to get there humility humility we gotta humble ourselves because you're [Music] let me read this last i think it's this last one i want to do same same same message but i'm going to read this in closing see i'm going to read a little it's going to be this is not quote this is uh something i'm reading now and i wanted to you to understand it's going to be a real personal thing it's got to be a heavy sacrifice but right now we're so busy there's something trying to establish ourselves in this earth and we're so stabilized we're putting more time in something [Music] that we put in for prayer you understand you got to be ready oh but you know what i i have to let people know you know what's everywhere so i'm going to say this it's going to have to be a heavier sacrifice than we make sacrifices a lot of time we feel like we we get the church like god owed us a favor shock for the vanilla please come see now do you mean you should use them for that i can't bring a revival did you [Music] knew that his present backslidden condition could not produce the strength of the challenges and if you don't know that you black samson the church in its present denominational condition cannot produce the strength men and women wants god on his heart you are only putting pulling a paper i don't know what a juvenile kid excuse me i'm sorry and acting like i don't know what if you say come from is that's all god required it's just taking he's looking for the life of christ not because you claim it with your mouth amen hallelujah enclosing than others hallelujah amen come on let me say it like this and i said i'm closing i mean it will tell me i just want to leave leave you with a thought some thoughts because delilah will make you think you're okay that's right and you must understand the hour we're living hallelujah amen is that right this is the hour of the confederation it determines whether you've got the holy ghost whether you're elected of god that's what happens you understand what i'm trying to say it's later than we think got a lot of people blind hey i think no i'm not saying you're not samson i'm not saying you're not the church but i am saying measure the condition that we're in the condition see that persecution because brother brown said we're going to get it he said there's a man that i here that can turn on the lights yeah yeah she ain't nominated don't be afraid you're gonna be in trouble bottom line you better know who you are
