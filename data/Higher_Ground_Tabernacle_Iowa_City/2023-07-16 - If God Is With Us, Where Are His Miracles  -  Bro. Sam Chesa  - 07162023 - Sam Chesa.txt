Hallelujah how many are grateful to be in the house amen open up Bible of judges [Music] Judges chapter 6 and verse 1. when you get there Say Amen the Book of Judges is in the new testament old testament you cannot find it in the New Testament amen verse 1 says and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the median seven years and the Hand of million prevailed against Israel and because of the medianized the children of Israel made them dance which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds please and verse 13. it was and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befall in us and where be all his miracles [Music] amen you may take your seats amen for a short time this morning I want to speak on if God is with us then where are his miracles [Music] and for a subtitle I want to speak on not this time can someone help me and say not this time I didn't hear you loud enough somebody says amen in the Book of Judges where we read already the Bible tells us that the children of Israel had been put in the hands of medianism [Music] and God allowed the medianized to come and attack and take um advantage of the children of Israel Israel this is because the children of Israel had done evil in the sight of the Lord so we find that ourselves in our lives many times when we start doing evil God allows us Satan to come and attack us he allows trials to come your way so you can remember that there is a God exists that there is a God who can deliver me and when you are in trouble you run to him and every time you run to him he always delivers he always hears your prayers let us read verse three he says and so it was when Israel had sown that the midianites came up and their amalekites and the children of the East even they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till Thou come unto Gaza and left no sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor Ox nor ass [Music] [Music] and Israel was get greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord Israel amen so we read God delivered the children of Israel into the hands of the media not for seven years this was because this is because they were doing evil and the prophet of God tells us that Satan cannot touch you unless you step out of the boundaries of the word and you go out to him here in my first quote the devil can't set a foot on you the prophet is until first you get away from God um you must first remember that check when anything happens see if you are in the faith or not see that if you're right up to the place with God then remember the devil can do you no harm you are in Christ when you are in God Satan cannot do anything to him the blood of Christ surrounds you there's a scripture that says the angel of the Lord encampered around those that fear Him yeah Satan went to uh to God and said you know I cannot do anything to to job because you have a fence around him it's not God who said that is Satan who said I cannot touch him because you have a fence around him how did Satan know that there was a fence around him because he had tried to go without God's permission and he could not charge her because of that fence they were surrounding him so I'm here to tell you if you are a son or a daughter of God you have a fence that's around you the blood of Christ surrounds you the Sunday is the Vancouver and no demon can break that barrier to come for you okay okay the sickness can break that barrier to come for you because you are protected by the blood of Jesus amen amen it's just like the City of Refuge I say come in the children of Israel when you run into the city of refugees the walls of the City of Refuge protects you element but as soon as you live out your adversaries can come and attack you both at their self and you cannot blame anyone because that's on you you were not supposed to leave the city so brother sister don't leave the word Allah when you leave the walls the protection of the word protection you're putting yourself in the hands of saying so the children of Israel where we read earlier we read all in the Book of Judges every time they did wrong God delivered them in the hands of their enemy immediately for them to get back on their knees for them to pray back to God and remember that we have a God yeah who can save us who can deliver us and we Are Spiritual Israel Israel scripture and God does the same thing for you and me sometimes when we do wrong that allows something to touch you shows but you gotta remember no matter what you have done cry to God he will hear your prayer because there's a promise that says if my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray he said I will hear from heaven we don't serve a deaf God he will hear and he will answer your prayers amen many times we do that you're going to say Lord please don't say yeah please deliver me out of this problem if you deliver me out of this problem never ever do it again but as soon as he delivers really after a little while Mr Predator you find yourself in that exact same problem don't you have that delivery then you go back to God in prayer and say Lord the thing that I did then yeah that I said I wouldn't do it again and you delivered me out of it I have done it again and I'm asking you to deliver me out of it again I've been there how many have been there but God is faithful he is not a man a Pioneer if you were to do that to your brother they'll tell you not this time you were supposed to learn your lessons but when you go to God it doesn't matter how many times you do wrong he will deliver you with his mighty hands every time foreign [Music] and the prophet of God saying the next quote if that isn't the picture of the church today just as soon as it gets out of one twist shows right into another one it goes but time had come for action time had come for action and he's talking about the children of Israel when they were captive by the midianites you see time had come for action and that's the same right now the time has come for Action [Music] the time had come when playing church had to come to a halt with God there is no more playing church we must get down to business and I trust that the same God who plays this upon the heart of people yeah tonight that is time for a hold of plain Church playing religions playing righteous and now it's time for Action what's the action foreign [Music] the children of Israel when they were marching around Jericho that's how far is Jericho they were taking action of what God had told them to do sure the second so when you do what God tells you to do Allah he's always gonna show up on the scene for a miracle God told him to March around Jericho seven times and because they took action and they took God at his word and pasties have a face attack shows God had to come down they started shouting before their walls had fallen down because they knew if God says it's a done deal if God says it is if he can do that for the children of Israel you can start praising him and shouting for Joy when you are in that sickness why because you know God always keeps his words hey man he said but my stripes you were healed not that you are going to be healed but you are already healed all you gotta do is take action on that word and he says it is finished he was not specifically whatever you you are dealing with or battling with Allah take action so it doesn't matter how much the enemy is Ravishing you and the next verse which is on the slide verse 76 and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the medianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus says the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt brought you forth out of the house of bondage did you see what happened here the children of Israel have been in bondage for seven years and they Cried unto the Lord because they were under oppression and the prophet said unto him that says the Lord God of Israel you are from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage what was God doing he was preparing them for deliverance he was telling them if I did it before I can do it again if I destroyed your enemies the Egyptians uh [Music] he was he was giving them his resume he's saying what you've seen what I've done before this problem that you have the problem this is the media Knights the media need they are nothing in the in the song in the song yeah if you go to the next slide usually uh the prophet God says before God sends Deliverance to his people he always sends a prophet to notify them he always sends his prophets so when you see a prophet coming on the scene no Deliverance is on his way because before God can send the Deliverance he's got to send a prophet and we thank God for deliverance in this last day because God sent us a prophet and we know that the prophet coming on the scene it means you and Miss Deliverance Lord I am a Seed of Abraham anyways and he killed all of the and then when you see that things are not okay [Music] so why do you think you are so special that he's gonna start failing on you hello that ain't gonna happen is he if he has never failed before he's not gonna fail on you if he has never failed or light in his word see why is it going to start lying on his words [Music] an exam example is so that when you are working with a situation an example [Music] and you don't know how to handle it you go back to the example how do they do this here like oh that's what they did something so the scriptures in the Old Testament they're there for you and me for an example that if God gave a solution before he can see he can give you a solution the scripture says there is no temptation that's uncommon to men whatever you are looking for the answer is right in the Bible so go back to the Bible go back to the word next slide the prophet of God says oh we are living in a grand time immediately when the prophet went off the scene what happened the Lord came on the scene yes as soon as John went off the scene the Lord came on the scene they said very strange how God works but he does it works in a mysterious ways so when God took the prophet of the scene he didn't leave us alone hey man he came down himself he'll the son remember because that's what the word of God tells us as soon as the prophet leaves the scene God comes down do you remember this song Amen so you can say and say Lord what you did for William Branham I know you can do it for and the doctors he went to the doctors and they made diagnosis and they said you have cancer he is [Music] he went back home and he prayed again Hallelujah if God be for us where are his miracles when you take him at his words you know he's coming down he is coming to deliver you he is coming to help you today hallelujah amen so all those cancers tumors baroness they cannot stand before you and then your trials cannot stand before you can run and go fight your battle because you know it's already won because it's God so whenever you're in trouble even if it's a self-inflicted trouble run to God anyways run to God anyways he has been proven to come time after time to come and redeem to come and deliver you please in the next slide so so God spoke to his Prophet Allah and they the midianites had taken all they had hey and they were starving to death tell my friends come on and he said don't you remember that I'm the god that brought you out of Egypt don't you know that I performed all my Miracles down in Egypt if you can put the next slide don't you know I opened the Red Sea this is I fed your fathers for 40 years in the wilderness [Music] I broke off the enemies around them amen amen did not I take out the amalikas and everything else from before here this was God speaking back to the children of Israel after they went back to cry to God forever he's telling them have you seen what I've done before in the past and I like this part it says I am the god just turn back to me and this says these two words watch me you are not doing the fighting yeah just turn around turn back to God then just watch him it says and remember always immediately after that prophet's message God goes to work so what's your duty all you have to do is watch him because he's doing the fighting for you foreign [Music] your relationship can be an idea but you put God First Take God at his word take action on the word turn back to him and he says watch me because after the word Goes Forth that's when God starts to work amen amen we have had the message of deliverance we have received the Seven Seals we have received the message of Grace and after that message has gone foreign the Bible says the children of Israel were in bondage of the media nights for seven years and the Bible is not specific for nothing and we know seven represents completion to represent the children of Israel had had seven years of defeat listen for this but because it was the seventh yeah God says your defeat is complete your defeat has ended and they were walking into their eighth year with your money and in their eighth year that's when God came to speak to them to bring Deliverance to them so they had seven years of a cycle of defeat Allah as long as you Satan and sick let the defeat but in the eighth year eight or eight represent a new day to represents New Beginnings hallelujah amen although they had suffered for seven years it was time for the eighth doesn't matter how many cycles of defeat you have been they are the proper the number of the tank is fair you try to get back up Satan takes you down you try this you try that but it ain't working I'm here to tell you we're at the end of the seven churches amen [Music] and we go to uh verse 11 that's the next slide it says and there came an April of the Lord and said Anna in Oak which is an offerer that pertained to Josh the bus ride and his son Gideon threshed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the media Knights verse 11. and there came an angel of the Lord we even launched the tunnel is a [Music] um [Music] [Music] and the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor large [Music] he was hiding there was nothing Courageous about what he was doing he was busy hiding from his enemies but whilst hiding from his enemies God came to him thou Mighty Man of Valor so we are seeing two things here Gideon is being a coward and God is saying you are a mighty man of Valor man and these two cannot be correct at the same time either Gideon is lying God is lying because they both cannot be correct at the same time he's being a coward and God comes and tells him you are victorious [Music] so either one of them is lying to learn more but the word of God tells that God never lies he is not a man that he should lie no a son of man that he should repentance so whatever Gideon thought of himself hello because that was a line vanity take what God was saying about him it does not matter what you think about yourself what matters is what does God think about you and you know what God thinks about you by looking in the word the word is a mirror it tells you that you are a mighty man of Valor Mighty woman so it doesn't matter even if you are hiding and as soon as the prophet leaves the same foreign [Music] you will see his miracles when you take what he says about you amen amen so Gideon trash that whole idea about being a cowboy and he stood up chest um and when he went he came to the Telly God gave him Victory Hallelujah it was not about him he just stood up but he said and you watched God do everything the soldiers only had to wait as the angel of God moved in the camp of the enemy so brother sister what you think about yourself [Music] or what other people think about you does not matter at all what matters is what does God say about foreign for you to Prosperity he doesn't have thoughts for you to to be overcome thought of you to be defeated amen he has thought of you to get out of that bondage and that will only happen if you take God at his word what does God say about me what does God say in his words but the Bible tells us God never lies so I would rather take God any day than what any other man or myself can even say yes because his word has been proven to never failure the same voice that says let there be light it created all the heavens and the Earth is the same voice of God we have in this area the Bible tells us that his word when it goes out it doesn't go back to him but it goes back to him after it is accomplished that which has sent it out any promises of God about you if they have not happened yet you gotta walk out and know that they're coming anyway it has to happen he has never failed hey man amen born Spirit-filled men in faith takes the word into his heart the next one please okay and places it on his lips a place why that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Chuck Montana Satan cannot stand before that man hallelujah amen when you are Spirit-filled when you are born of the spirit you when you take the word of God what it says about you and you put it in your heart remember as a man think it is put it on your lips it is the same as deity speakers it is the same as God speaking Every Mountain has to go shark month Satan cannot stand before that because remember what was in God he poured into Christ what was in Christ he poured into the church so the same Authority that God he placed it in you and me with that Authority in heaven he kicked out Lucifer I've accepted and that same Authority poured into Christ kicked Satan in hell yeah so if he poured that same Authority in you and me today we can also kick Satan on this Earth because that's the that power has the same effect amen amen God never fails take action take God at his words take that word into your heart if you speak it out God will give you delivery amen amen if God be for us then where are his miracles we go to uh verse 14. just keep a lot of slides and go to the one that is verse 14. and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have I not sent thee uh the so your value depends on Whose hands you are in Allah when Gideon was in the hands of of the media and I think the hand of his enemies he was a coward hello but as soon as he got out and stabbed into the hands of God he became a Mighty Man Of Violence so whose hands are you in hello are you with the hands of God or in the hands of your enemies if you are in the hands of your enemy I'm telling you run away right now run into the hands of God because he will transform you basket from a liar to a Son of God from a prostitute to a daughter of God he will change you from good for nothing to good for the kingdom that same basketball is going to be worth thousands it's not about the basketball the program is about whose hands it is so whoever's hands you are in hello that determines your values so brother sister Hello friends to take that leap this morning if you've been in the hands of the enemy for so long seven years my cycle of defeat is up like leap out of the hands of your enemy and get into the hands of God Amen and he will bring Miracles through you hey do you ever appointed a Miracles and he will bring miracles in your life why because you are important to God you are Blackboard who said from how important as you you are saved by his blood you are elected by foreign and you can trap over all of Satan's devices no demon in hell can stand before because you are in the hands of God amen amen as I'm coming to him and let's go to verse 15. and then he said unto him this was a Gideon telling God he says oh my Lord where shall I serve save Israel behold my family is poor in manassar and I am the least in my father's house after he had accepted that he was a man of accepted and after stepping into the hands of God she started looking back at his background he started looking at his ancestors history you have said all this about me but I just come from a poor background you know Manasseh was not given an important role but God predestinated him your past doesn't matter your past does not determine your future what determines your future is what God says even if you come from a poor background foreign can say you come from a from from from a lineage of drunkards people that are good for nothing none of your ancestors were known for anything that's good or can this is you gotta stand and say I'm in the hands of God it does not determine my future after God is done with me I'm gonna be a different case all together hallelujah amen so it doesn't matter what you have even done people can say you are a sinner you have seen so much but when you step into the hands of God he throws all your sins in the sea of forgetfulness you just tell them wait until God is done with me and the next slide in chapter eight the men of Israel said unto Gideon this was after Gideon brought the miracle into Israel and they overcame their enemies and they went to him now that good for nothing that man coming from a poor background said that man saying who am I what am I they went back to him they say you rule over us both you and your son and your son son also because you have delivered us from the hands of the media so you see what Gideon did wait a minute he stood there and he says all the evil that was rolling down from my ancestors generational curse of poor background he says it stops with me when God is done with me I'm more than a conqueror yes but now they wanted him to be his Legends not just him only person but him and his sons and Sons to come together so you might be in your chapter six but step into the hands of God foreign [Music] that's Now history Apache menu starting from me and my kids and kids to come apart I'm stopping that curse they can tell you your ancestors they are full of addictions they might tell you your family has a history of high blood pressure uh [Music] [Music] I'm gonna be changed I'm not going to be a coward no more uh [Music] Emperor amen amen I'm a mighty man of Valor yes I'm more than a conqueror let's stand upon our feet amen amen if God before us Allah then where are his miracles the children of Israel had suffered for seven years cycle of defeat the defense but in the eighth year money Gideon said not this time you have made me sick before and I couldn't get out of it but not this time hallelujah amen I have failed these battles before but not this time because I'm in the hands of the Lord let us sing this song It's Already Done amen the battle is over geek and plain Japanese [Music] it's already done [Music]
