[Music] Glory Hallelujah God is good to us as we stand and I guess we're going to ask that you turn with us to Matthew the 28th chapter I'd like to thank the Lord for the message that were being played this morning it is basically the message one of the messages that I receive my message for today possessing the enemy's gate so we love the Lord I trust that the word of God be a blessing to you this morning Matthew 28 my church Jesus came near and said to them all power all authority has been given to me in heaven and in Earth and see we're going to be coming from one more passage of scripture that'll be Revelations the fifth chapter is 13th verse there versus 5 and 13. apocalypse every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne unto and unto the lamb forever and ever since [Music] amen our Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord yes we thank you God for this day I have shown to your position given to us to worship and to praise and that you are the controller of all things you know the number of breaths that we will take quantity so we humble ourselves and we thank you Jesus in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen amen you may be seated it's been a long while since I've been here it is very important now we begin to really see who we are they call myself I had a lot of things that I would like to speak I thought that I'd give you a Word of Faith this morning we are in a a dilemma but some dancing dilemma we are in a position the sometimes in position where we must be proven we must be tested and we must be tried but uh before we come to be a Victorian we must first understand that the battle has been fought because she is already one party we must understand the God that we worship and the god that we worship is the only true and living God he has been time tested and proven to be the almighty God we must understand that we're not working with something primitive primitive about the God that we serve is Almighty and there is no weapon that can destroy him no man-made a weaponry okay can destroy his people we must understand without even having a battle okay God has made us Victors hallelujah amen listen when and the lamb took the book came forth as the Mighty conqueror at that same lamb is still in power the blood blood power understand can only be asts and experience by those who are truly Believers you can't be a make-believer s of this decision you and I must understand but through this message it has come to declare United declaring that Satan is powerless when the mighty angels and stood there on the land in the sea he said declaring that time would be no more amen it was Christ who was gaining the victory Victoria claiming the victory for you and I hallelujah amen no matter what Satan does we must come to understand amen that we could never lose we always come out as a winner the Bible says no weapon against me [Music] no lying vanities the destiny of God but we have come to be tried and tested and God is tired if I could say it like this let's put it this way God wants to see True Believers and actions it's not enough to quote William Brothers if you're not going to take the quotes amen only those who can believe amen is that the word the Bible said No weapons and every tongue is that shall rise against shall condemn ation hallelujah amen this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord amen do you understand it is something that you have inherited you didn't have to buy it you still have to steal it it was given in other words you were born richness you were born wealthy was that name you you want into a royal family you were born into this inheritance foreign [Music] I want you to remind him not that he forgets but God wants to hear it out of your mouth see it doesn't matter how much people pray for you yeah it doesn't matter how many times people pray for you must come out of your mind is that right that's a correct hallelujah amen evening you think about it even when the window into the lion he said that he said [Music] Hallelujah they were put under pressure is it god Jehovah God answers your prayers [Music] because when you belong to Jesus Jesus he will come to your rescue hallelujah amen amen under that pressure they said [Music] more than [Music] he said if I pray for Japan [Music] don't you understand come of a situation does it determine your faith you can have faith and God will still say no but we don't like no for the answer that's why Jesus says amen God has to prove to me the answer is coming from the message possessing the enemy's Gates brother Brandon said like this and even in a Strange Land remember he had purposed in his heart found myself with them to that promise I'll stay true amen God put him to a test you know when you say oh Lord I'll be faithful out of those words God will put you to the test yes sir amen you either be like one of us worship the way we worship oh I'll throw you into the deadly lions you are becoming make it evil and the only way Born Again Hallelujah [Music] reason that we're going through it says Who You Are the season let's say something that we're now living here we manifest who you are if you see yourself doing more evil than good foreign but if you don't want to be evil is that correct oh my remember the Rich Young Ruler she sought the one [Music] [Music] but he really wasn't ready to surrender all to God hallelujah see in this way Jesus said sell all that your hands follow me you see but people don't know and religion is just a covering Hallelujah but I want salvation at the end of the day if I should die at the end of the day if I should die Hallelujah I don't want to go down I want to go up hallelujah amen no matter what I must go through let me hurry Daniel like Abraham his father said you may throw me into the lion's den hey Daddy people say oh what are you seeing brother as well everybody have their definition of the message everybody has a definition but there is no definitions he is [Music] amen he said as he said in that day you know that I am in the father I am in you because yes [Music] because this is the day that we're living here the discuss this is Vindication let's shoot the confirmation amen Satan is already let's just walk all over us hello somebody amen are we cowards when the battle comes from the battles president said where are those days [Music] tested it is but even when you're sick okay say you can't get well that final chance people walk out of the hospital room their hairs hung down because amen when we going to believe the world ah you came back down [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] materials [Music] [Music] Giants no Giants you know what let me tell you something my body is your body your body is mine and if we could see it like that when we personally get sick then we can professional to make this body well something yeah somebody somebody need to join in with me this morning drop all your your thoughts Hallelujah if we don't fight for each other we've got to fight for each other amen there's a Time Moses did everything was here he did everything yeah we're gonna rock around Jericho that's how the bride must work you heard maybe you win you can't pray but thank you amen come on somebody amen we've got to work together because we have a lack of fight foreign amen Jesus cry are you gonna do you really believe him yes what is the what is the word of God what has it become to come to you because they become powerless to you yeah I don't have to feel it Sensations amen but let me tell you something something you know to speak it is When you pray for someone and you command the devil to leave and you command the devil to leave that person you don't have to feel it you don't have to see it you just gotta have faith to believe faith it's not going to hear what I'm saying because you never know when no in turn you know even the prophet of God wanted to give up one time remember he was rebuked by God or um he won't go and go out in the woods that's not what he was called too late listen people I know the prophet of God would be ashamed of his words we hear all of this word we rejoice but there's a quote brother Brandon said it like this the bride will know what to do with the words amen y'all hear what I'm saying you see people that get in church and the word of God is going on and they are bored come from church [Music] if the word of God has become boring to you you've lost it [Music] I said what the devil ain't halfway conquered the job totally defeated because when demon strikes your body that is a lying than what you give him um you can walk all over here [Music] who said hallelujah amen you foreign God [Music] Affairs yeah people get so sad with the past they ain't here again yes he is yeah I'm not your pastor Pastor Jesus Christ yes yes you need a revelation especially thing that God uses those brothers that come here when they preach that's much just as much God when you have favoritism amen hallelujah amen I'm talking about that unseen realm we we we're just in our mind we get so carnal sometimes we we just shows it makes no sense to me as we approached the the translations of the word of God Amen but it just seemed like people are getting weaker that's not according to the sheets of Jesus what's going to happen to those people who are so carnal in their minds I wonder what he did in Paul's days they didn't have you know telling how many took Paul's letters [Music] the people who couldn't ride the Bible said the holy ghosts [Music] spiritual Those Old Testaments who had never met Jesus says but they believed in the words of the prophets [Music] and they kept that Arizona foreign but even the grave remember that Tom couldn't hold them foreign [Music] he began to preach to say yeah and then he asked him [Music] because I was in nowhere [Music] listen let me tell you like this once you die if there's no place to repentance amen knowing that Satan has been completely defeated if you're not certain of your salvation Satan will come to your deathly did y'all know that foreign [Music] one of the things that I love you love the Lord the properly God said the Lord Of Glory when Jesus began to raise from the dead come on they asked a question who is this king who is he this king is the king of glory captivity when they asked who is this voice who is this voice what is this
