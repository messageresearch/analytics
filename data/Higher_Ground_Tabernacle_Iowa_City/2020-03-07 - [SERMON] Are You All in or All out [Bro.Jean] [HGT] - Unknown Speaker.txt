[Laughter] [Music] we're reasoning in your head or in your mind or your heart if you really have a revelation of God in your heart of who you are and what your purpose is go for all you might one of

you are be the best Christian you know if there be a competition and ought to be one like that I'm gonna be the best Christian in this church amen and and you that comes by yielding and talked about fasting and praying which is one of those things that their flesh hates but you have to humble that man kill him every day you know maybe you're not as big as I am and you can't fast there's no you

Heavenly Father that I as we are here this morning Lord where come expecting and receiving your word Lord Jesus Christ we may be tired we may be weak but Lord you come on the scene and speak words of life words of energy that will transform us to become more like you Heavenly Father God we commit all things into your hand and let your precious Holy Spirit have its way in Jesus name we say amen thank you musicians if you guys have your word which you Scriptures the Bible are we gonna go ahead and go to two different scriptures this morning if you don't even my name is uh brother Paul Jean come all the way down from Boynton Beach Florida and I'm just happy to be up in the cold and are you were but even the area could be cold but the Holy Spirit is hot so we just pray that the Holy Spirit will have his way this morning if we had a the word witchy this morning we got to go to two verses two scriptures the first one is in 1st Samuel 1st Samuel Chapter 7 verse 3 First Samuel chapter seven verse three and when you get to say hey man if to let me know that she got there first time you'll chapter 7 verse 3 you know and the scripture reads like this and it says and Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel saying if you do return unto the Lord with all your hearts then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines that was first time he said in verse 3 the next one is first Kings chapter 18 verse 21 first Kings chapter 18 verse 21 the scripture reads and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God and follow him but if Beldon follow him and the people answered him not a word you may have your seats this morning we just gonna jump straight into the the word anointing and I like to always start off with a the inspiration of what I'm preaching about and the inspiration that I have this morning with this subject that I've been studying on and reading and meditating is either you have the Holy Spirit or you don't have it but if you don't come and get it either you have the Holy Spirit or you don't have it but if you don't have it come and get it so my title is are you all in or are you all out are you all in or you are allowed to begin we got a from the messenger from the Colts the time of decision 1959 it says you know we have been forced to make decisions there is times when we have to come to a place where we got to say yes or no that's just human life there's a time where we cannot stand neutral if God shall permit I don't believe that we are able to lead this church tonight or this morning in the same condition that we did when we come into it if the Holy Spirit shall come and do his work among us then we are forced to say yes or no we cannot remain the same Samuel saw the children of Israel worse were serving in going after strange gods even though they were commissioned to only serve the true and living God the god of Jehovah Elijah also saw that Israel was confused they were not sure on what grant to stand on who to believe they were stuck between bill and God and you know today it seems like people do not know where to stand he also wanted to know where the people stand therefore that there comes upon questions there are moments in your life when you got to make a decision see the children of Israel stayed silent when the time of showdown came see either they were serving God or they were not serving God so this morning actually again are you all in tagada are you not because God needs people to believe in him if you're not gonna believe in him then don't believe in him at all because it is your decision everyone has to make a decision everyone has choices to decide about your future which are you going to what you're gonna eat what you're gonna wear God gave man and angels a choice see the ability to decide or to pick or to truth is in you but you have to make a decision when you make a decision you choose you make a choice about it you got to stick to it because every choice has rewards and consequences the Prophet who said in paragraph 11 the time of decision he said you see God don't make all of our decisions there's many times that God doesn't tell his prophets just what to do because they have to make the decision if there is no decision that we have to make just wait every move on God then there is no overcoming on our part and sometimes they make the wrong decision God's anointed prophets make the wrong decisions and many times they are deceived time decision paragraph 11 1959 if you want to read it so my question is very simple very direct whose team are you on whose side are you on are you going after God are you going after the world because you got to figure out are you a believer of that are you not you got to make a decision you just can't keep coming just because you felt like coming to church it got to be a real decision when you make a choice you got to know that you made the touch with all your heart everybody got to make a choice but it seems like many of people who come to church or who are in God horn or word there are stuck between living for God and living for the world you cannot serve two masters either God is your master or the devil is your master there's no in-between maybe if not no so either you serve God or you're not if you're not serving God you got no choice but to serve the devil when God made man god made man with a choice but it is man choice whether you want to be like God or you don't want to be like God God doesn't force anybody to be like him but you got to have it in your heart it got to be a CD it has to be something in you that wants to be just like God so a decision got to be made so we need we as people got to make a decision it is a time of decision too many people are in and out so I say one more time you got to pick a side you got to figure out are you all left or you all out are you going to stay with the Word of God or are you not going to stay what a guy cuz many people gonna come and then people gonna leave but you got to know if God has put something in your heart to believe in him you gotta stick to it like I said every decision that you make has rewards and it also has some consequences it can be good or it can be bad they can be right or can be wrong but you have to make a decision who are you going to serve and what are you going to do because to serve God you got to have some guts you got to have faith and then you got to stand with the word you got and true when you make a decision you got to be committed so you can't serve God today and serve the devil tomorrow either you're serving God every day you're serving the devil every day but you got to pick one when you make a choice you gotta mean what you say you got to stick to it you got to give it everything that you have because some decisions that you make choices that you make either will set you free or will keep you in slavery for your life the Prophet said here and why is it why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live a Christian life he says here because well now we got all kinds of everything coming and you haven't got it till you get it but brother you haven't got it until it is the Spirit of God that comes from heaven and changes your life that makes the fruits of your life a different person by their fruits you shall know them that's the reason you have so much ups and down - they're gonna come to church and some Christians and then some are not but when you have something when he when he had a power when you have a Holy Spirit in your life you know that you're a believer and that is my mission that is my goal dad we got to have the Holy Spirit without that you can never be a real Christian you could pretend all you want to but you gonna show your colors the Prophet said in total deliverance paragraph 49 he said if you are a Christian see God don't make halfway Christians God makes complete Christians God don't make halfway preachers but the preacher can be halfway and God makes his children Christians remember that God makes his children Christians but sometimes they're halfway Christian but it is not God's intention for them to be that way it's their own ways that God makes with the plan of God for their life that's what makes them what they were the way they are God doesn't don't want them to be halfway Christian or halfway preachers or compromising on either side he wants them to be to completely stand in the breach meaning that you got to make a choice and stick to it if you're going to be a real Christian be the best real Christian that she can be but you got to have the Holy Spirit first the same sermon he says in paragraph 77 he says we want complete deliverance we don't want to be a halfway Church I can't stand out I don't want to be halfway we want to be a real church or no church at all we want to be real Christians or no Christians at all but you got to make a choice you got to stand strong believing that either God called you to be a Christian like he not but if he called you then he'd get you something to equip me to become a real Christian we call it the Holy Spirit it is the holy the owner the Holy Spirit is the only thing I can make you like Christ you can read books or you want to watch movies try to imitate but if you don't got something in your soul a real Spirit of God to change your life you will never become it either you're all in or you're all out you got to make have a commitment you got to have some guts to serve God you got to be firm in your choice because you can't just keep come to church because it's a good thing to do Church I realized I don't see in some people some athletes like LeBron James Kobe Bryant some people doing weed these people give so much effort just to play basketball LeBron James spent a million dollars on himself so he can play basketball people spend so time to look good they look pretty but we don't want to we don't want to take that same kind of effort to be a real Christian but we watch these people on you know dunking the ball playing movies playing different roles and stuff like we wanted coming just like that person but God hasn't called us to be somebody else that he did not create us for to be when God made us he made it to be a Christian but sometimes we we we get relaxed we get lazy we get tired you know but what I like about Kobe Bryant is that he made a choice to pursue excellence even in playing basketball everything he did he said that he wanted to win and be the best everything that he and this is a man of the flesh LeBron James is the same way Dwyane Wade Michael Jordan was the same way he said he he wanna win and everything but everybody wants to be like Jordan but Christ people don't put their effort to be like Christ but let me tell you if you have the Holy Spirit and you stick to it you stay what the word it will make you just like Christ the best version of Christ is the Holy Spirit but you gotta have it in your Sony it ain't no maybe you can't pretend it gotta be a real thing a real experience they gotta be real life listen I grew up in church my dad was a pastor I knew I was supposed to be living right but I didn't have something in me to make me live right brother Brooks I went to the world I went basketball games I went to football games I left Hannah's country I was born and raised here so I know what it is to be in church and be in an out of church I had worldly friends but you know what something always told me I got to live better even when I was out there stealing lying doing all kinds of wrong things I knew this something in me that had to be better and then sometimes we we come to church when we get confused we know that God is speaking to us but sometimes we don't respond to when God is talking to us listen I don't been to some youth services where I see the power of God I fell down and I still left worse but they came a point in my life that either I had to make a choice or I wasn't either I was with God or I was with the devil but had to make a decision and I thank God that I made the right decision but just because I made a decision is just a step I needed I needed I needed a power in me to make me just like Christ and the Holy Spirit that power I don't care if you're seven years old 1735 we need more of the Holy Spirit to become just like Christ because without it you can never be a real Christian you can come play music listen I play music I played the drums and I was still living like the world still lying still cheating still don't whole bunch of foolishness but when I got a real experience in my life that changed me forever I don't got to pretend to be myself I am a real Christian do I make mistakes you better believe it do I do wrong yes sir but I'm telling when you have the Holy Spirit it makes you just like Christ that you will confess every one that you did being afraid to be corrected you ain't afraid to pursue greatness in God when I look at these people on TV I'm like we paying them money to play a game and then God has given us life for free but people rather go to again and rather go to church and see God moving but they try to see a basketball player moving what any man can die but if you have God you will never die even in their grave he was still resident wretched but you got to have a Holy Spirit inside of you they say know me pretend this is my life I know the way I was living I know what I did I was a pastor's child kid my dad was the first one so I got all the rebuke sort of criticism but I know people always wanted me to be something great but the only way that you can be really great is if you had the Holy Spirit and it's not just being great just like the world know is it's allowing the Holy Spirit of God to live himself in you but sometimes you know when God is speaking I don't be in a new services with the anointing came down God has spoken I setting up my arms cause like yeah mm-hmm it's good and I left worse knowing that I should've gave my life to Christ now that I got older I realized I should know what I should have served God earlier but you know what God has a time to catch you but you never don't want to cross that line that you can never come back and but you got to make the right decision now you got to stay strong you got to be committed that if God is calling me if God put me in this church that means there's something more to be waiting to be seen you see I know what my life is I know what I'm called to do and I ain't scared to do it I'll let the devil know that I am called to be a real Christian I don't got to pretend I don't got to put on I don't got to be no fake no I'm a puppy but I make mistakes yeah even with the Holy Spirit you can still do things that are wrong it is on it that the grace of God can't keep you from sinning that's the only thing I'm telling but when you have the Holy Spirit you don't got a world about if you're gonna live right or wrong the Holy Spirit gonna make you live right and even when he's living wrong it's gonna make you live wrong to the right but you gotta have it they say no maybe pretend I think so I might so no no you got to have it it's something that when you play music people don't wanna see me they'll see your life through the music turn I want you to leave out of here this weekend knowing that if you don't have it do everything that she can to get it the Prophet said that he said uh-uh if you want to be somebody got to get into their spirit people want to be like Jordan people listen I don't want to be like Michael Jordan to like Kobe Bryant like Dwayne Wade see but you have to get under their spirit you can see the devil knows that but if you want to be like Christ you got to get into his spirit and once you get into his spirit in his spirit is in you you will be just like Christ people can say all sort of things about you they can kind of mistreat you and you would still love them when nobody want to come to church you would still come to church and still love God and shout sing jump and dance and do whatever but sometime you know we come to church come on come on people let's sing let's jump let's Dan listen when he had the Holy Ghost you don't got to be forced it's natural and you know what if you want to be a natural Christian you gotta have the Holy Spirit first the Holy Spirit is don't they now make you a natural Christian day-in and day-out at home last school I work anywhere any place any time people would know that you're a real Christian because they see the Spirit of Christ in you that is the goal that is the motive of this message ain't ain't about just going to the Russia to go to Russia gotta have the Holy Spirit first if you want to be a real preacher got a preacher with the Holy Spirit first you want to be a real musician gotta have the Holy Ghost first listen I tell you I've done it and I tell you we play music without the Holy Spirit we don't try to you know sound good but you know what at the end of the day our life feel empty there was something that was missing there was a power in our life that wasn't there sometimes just because you know you're under an anointing under your pastors ministry or under your father under your parents it can be covered by certain things but there comes a point that when you see the devil you got to make a choice either you're with me or you're not either you with God or you're not and that's why I aspire to say either are you all into Christ or you not because Christ don't want people who are halfway any real believers got to be a real believer in God but sometimes you know we get confused sometimes we get conflicted sometimes we come to church and we like what the world does we like you know we like how the world looks you know we like making things you know make us laugh and what now you know we left you know you know we love having all these different kind of things the jewelry the fashion we like looking good we like wearing a frightening or latest outfit the new sneakers the Jordans the Nikes the haraki's they're airmax we like looking cool well I can looking nice and at school that whatnot you know we like having all the good stuff you know all the Gucci bags Versace we all like but I'm telling what the best name-brand she can have is Christ in your life he's the greatest thing that there ever is on earth right now and he's not hitting him up but he's living through a bunch of people who are called his bride his Christians his real believers but she got to have the brand mark inside your soul ain't just maybe listen I don't been there I don't see listen I don't been deter I don't play music I don't make people dance and shout and scream but I left worse knowing that God called me to be something more but I left worse because the spirit told me I come and get the spirit but I like nah I'm too young I'm not ready excuse me I'm not ready yet I don't want to give up my friends I don't want to give up my influence I don't want to look like I'm not cool well you know what if you don't have the Holy Spirit you ain't cool I touched my church last week I said if you don't have the Holy Spirit you look ugly I said if you don't have the Holy Spirit look nasty your attitude is dirty but if you have the Holy Spirit LLL make you sweet humble kind patient and you don't gotta force it it just naturally uses out of your life but you got to make a choice now you got to make a stand you got to be committed now either you're gonna get this Holy Spirit or you're not either you're gonna have your only revival or you're not either you're gonna really serve God or you're not but I can't force it to you the pastor came for it but you got to make your own decision and God respects when people make their own decisions even God has to respect the choice that you make ain't that crazy the person that created you has to respect your choice well I think God that I made a choice to serve Him long ago and even when I'm falling he stood there to help me each and every single day even when I'm not kind he makes me kind even when I'm not humble he makes me humble even when I'm not holding he makes me holy ain't no put on put its thought it's a real power of the Holy Spirit what changed you to make you become like a Christian there ain't no real Christian without the Holy Ghost get that in your mind put it in your heart write it down memorize it they ain't never will be a real Christian without the Holy Spirit I'm telling you if you want to be real if you if you if you really know that your card of God go all the way get everything that God has every power every blessing every victory every every every anointing that you have is in the Holy Spirit but you got to go and get it you got to go and get it yourself you got to make a choice you can't be in between maybe I'll come to Iowa City maybe I not know either you're all in or you are not even when you come structure give your best or you don't don't give God no half-crab foolishness sometimes we give God garbage I'll be the first to tell you me me me too sometimes a preacher too sometimes we come to church retired we're lazy we don't want to sing and we promise God God if you change my life I'll sing for you I'll do this I'll do that and you know we lying but you know what the Holy Spirit would still help you the power of God would still help you if you want to be cool at school don't worry get the Holy Spirit you'll be cool because you have something that will make you live forever if you want to be great you gotta have a great God in you but if you want to be average wouldn't be just like everybody else then go ahead and be like everybody else but you got to make a decision you got to know that God has called you to be greater listen everybody has a purpose in life but you got to know your purpose some people could be the carpet the chairs the car you could be anything in life but if you know in your heart that God calls you to be a Christian be the best Christian that you can be a real one but first you got to have the holy spirit you gotta have a fresh baptism if you don't have it pray that you get it fast pray read ask the pastor to help you see I need something that when I can't be a Christian that there's something in me that will make me be a real Christian but you gotta have it but they got to be your own choice your mom can't force you dad I can't force you the pastor can't force even God himself the creator of you came and forcing but you got to know that you got to make a real choice you gotta be all-in to God or not either you're gonna ride with God are you gonna die without them either you're gonna ride with Christ or you're gonna die without them and the only way to ride to a crisis to have the Holy Spirit okay that's the only thing that if you ride into the ground he'll ride you back up if you want to go to a rapture you got a ride with Christ in his heart in your soul but if you don't want to go okay well don't then don't come to church then if you don't want to go then don't serve Him but if you really want to go if you know that you're called to be great and you know well a and I'll be strange to say this but the only great thing that there is is the Holy Spirit that is the greatest thing that can change this whole entire world is the Holy Spirit that's the only thing that will make you become a great Christian not just the way you talk number but if you have a real anointing of the passage of the Holy Spirit in your life a real power a real fruit changing a real character changing of the Holy Spirit that will make you be a real Christian don't settle for being average don't settle for being okay don't settle for being less than B greater be more be stronger be faster be smarter be more holier through the Holy Spirit only got a few more minutes here the Prophet said here 1950 56 the arrows of God deliverance are from a bow he said brother when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it takes that old temper out of you so if you got a temper you need the Holy Ghost it puts on a dress and makes you act like a lady so if you have a dressing you're not a lady get the Holy Ghost it'll make you quit smoking drinking lying stealing and everything brother when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it separates you it delivers you from the things of the world amen it makes you love God you can't really love God until you have a real Holy Ghost in your life it makes you go to church it makes you worship Him it makes you tell your neighbor about it it makes you live above sin hallelujah but you got to have the Holy Spirit but you first you got to make your own choice remember what I said every choice every choice that you make in life has rewards or Consequences has blessings and cursings but you got to make that choice sometimes it's scary but let me tell you if you make the choice for a god you don't got to worry about it for the rest of your life you might have some ups and get downs but one thing's for sure that if you got God that's all you need the only thing that you need in life is a true Holy Spirit of God once you have the Holy Ghost you have everything that you need see the main thing is to have the main thing the main thing is to have the main thing what is the main thing the main thing is the Holy Ghost down into your soul then you can be like the main thing then you will be a main thing but to be the main thing you got to have it the main thing what is the main thing the main thing is the Holy Spirit in your soul not in your mind not on your flesh not on your body but deep down in your soul that that will take out that temper take out all that anger or that depression or that anxiety or that stress or that lust only the Holy Spirit can change your life you can only be a real Christian if you have a real Holy Spirit in your soul I'll say one more time you can only be a real Christian if you have a real Holy Spirit in your soul you got to be either all into it or you're all out there's no mate between God there's no neutral in God there's no neutral in the devil either either you're on God's side or you're on the wrong side see but when you pick God's side you're on the winning side so you're on the winning team but if you're not on God's side and I'm sorry to tell you you ain't gonna be winning anything so you got to make a choice what side of do you want to be on are you gonna be on God's side or not cuz Israel had to make a choice either they were gonna serve the Lord God or serve bill but they had to make a choice all the Prophet did was show them who was the real God and that was it but the people had to make a real choice they had to make a real decision are we serving God for real are we not are we just just having this church that's the half Church all we want to be a real church when a realtor's got to have any real word a real word gonna have a real Holy Ghost just that simple whose team are you on and whose side are you on you got to make a choice if you want to be on the winning team then you got to pick Christ but if you don't pick Christ and you automatically go to the losing team but you got to pick a team you got to pick a side you got to pick a squad you got to pick a game I like to my turn I said the best game that there is is the Bride of Christ I said the best group that there is is the Bride of Christ because that's the people who got the real Holy Spirit of God that's people who look like Christ but if you want to be what the best team if you want to be on a winning team that you got to pick Christ if you want somebody to be with you at all times and you got to pick Christ he's the only person that even when everything is dark he still is the light even when are you drowning in sin he's gone person I can pull you up out of sin even when you're minors confused he's the only one I can give you peace in your mind but you got to make a choice I can't tell you not anymore but you got to make your own choice you got to know what do you really want to serve God are you not as the musicians come I got a few things that I heard that I'm gonna share with you and you can take note of this and you young people remember this for your life okay the first thing is when you make a choice stick to it whatever choice that you make stick to it whatever choice that you make in your life stick to it if you're gonna stay with the word and stay with the word if you're gonna stay with God's name of God if you can stay with the true state you're gonna stay in church stay in church but don't be in between if you find yourself in between make a stand make a choice they committed to it that's the only way that God can truly bless you but you got to stick to it you got to stick to it the next thing is that you got to stand fast stand fast means that you got to hold on to it nobody can't take it from you as I said last night whatever God gives you is non-negotiable if God gives you something if God puts something in your heart do not negotiate it with the devil because whatever God gives you it is for you so if God gives you a love of God for him it is for you to love God but you gotta stand fast you gotta stick to it the next thing is that you got to show your colors you got to let people know what side are you on see every team got a uniform every team got a logo every team also got a coach every team got players every team if you want to win you gotta practice so if you want to be a real Christian where you got a practice prayer want to be a real believer you got our practice fasting want to be a real believer you gotta practice love but first you need a power of the Holy Spirit in your life first and foremost you got to prove yourself believers just believe their actions are seen by their fruits their testimonies and witnesses how do we know that somebody is playing great or how somebody is looks great because of their actions however somebody is a Christian because of their actions how does the body is a real Holy Ghost Christians because of their actions remember you got to stick to it you got to stand fast and you got to show your colors as I said in closing every team got a uniform every team got a logo the logo of Christianity is Christ's the uniform is the Holy Spirit but for you to wear that Holy Spirit it has to be inside of you just don't think that this is just a regular service that I can't hear for nothing I can't because the reason is something I really need the Holy Spirit somebody got my needle of fresh or refilling of you you just can't come to church and play music just because it's a good thing to do listen I tell you when you have the Holy Spirit it would change your church service it will change our neighborhood even attention even though all the people to get closer to God but it starts with you [Music] don't leave here this weekend without having a real experience with that then you know what I'm saying buddy Brooks I don't got to be even in church you can experience God in your bedroom in your car at school in the bathroom you can experience God anywhere sometimes that becomes traditional we got to come to the altar to pray I in traditional early church right now and say you know you go find a hole that goes at your house because sometimes we limit God that way listen God is God is unbelievable he can do anything anywhere anytime that he wants to but you got to be committed you got to make a choice if you got to know that God is calling you to be greater God is calling you to live more when God called Christians he don't caucus it to be average but I don't want to be average Church if LeBron James ain't average Kobe Bryant ain't average Dwyane Wade any Arab I me as I believe I would not be average people out in a music world you got car D but you got jay-z you got a whole bunch of these people and they give their whole entire life to serve the devil but we asked Christians we do what oh no no I am committed this year to be a excellent Christian by all means necessary but you got to know that you got to make the choice you got to make the choice you got to make the choice remember every choice has consequences of rules but you got to make the choice if you want to be great the only great thing there is is the Holy Spirit ain't nothing greater than that but once you have it I'm telling it will change your life you don't gotta come and pretend to be a Christian pretend to be a believer pretend to be real but it's naturally inside of you it oozes out of your life even demons will be scared of you but sometimes us as the church we're more scared of demons and people are scared of us but that will change once you have the Holy Spirit God knows that we need help God knows that some of y'all here need a fresh experience with God some of y'all need a new experience or something I guys need a personal change and experience from them so don't leave this weekend don't leave this morning don't leave tonight without knowing that God I got to get closer to you God what the brother was saying I needed what the man was saying this morning Lord I know I needed I'm telling I'm not I don't want to be an average I don't want to just be a routine I want you to leave here this morning knowing that God spoke to you and you heated his calling that he will change at my church I don't need prayer calls the altar is in your heart you can pray standing up sitting down anywhere in your car going home but just make sure that you speak to God and find out what God wants you to be as brother Brooks come make sure that you got what you came to get for listen whatever that you need God has it but you got to make a choice you got to make a decision don't let your friends and don't even let your parents influence and make your true it is your choice God gave every man a choice [Music] but you gotta choose Christ that's what I was hoping that you would do but I can't force you but if you choose Christ I'm telling you he will pay you in abundance come on but the Brooks God is the only person I will pay for every second of your life every choice that she made for him he will pay for you so that said don't don't leave because it's a regular and a regular service but you got to make your choice for yourself you got to know that if I want to be their Christian that God wants me to be then I need the Holy Spirit they know maybe I know tomorrow next week next year when I get older when I when I'd be 12 21 24 30 you may not have that long so whatever you can't get Christ now in your life because he's the only person he's the either is the best thing that's for you as we all stand [Music] check your life if you don't got it come get it you don't got to pretend you don't got a way for it to be a revival to go to you've can't go to a youth conference to go to a youth service down in a different country or a tent revival have the revival by yourself in your life right now but like I said again you got to make your choice we can't force them The ministers can't force the pastor can't force he would he would love to sometimes we would love to but we can't do it but if you make that real choice I'm telling you I promise you that the Holy Spirit is the best thing that you would ever need may God bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] let's sing again more in the ball [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah Oh

drama we look for the Hollywood scene before we can hit the door but after when I think about the way Jesus must have breached I think about how he spoke in such a sincere way I can see how his words may be in the way it wasn't you know his mission was that he came to save the Lost the gospel is impossible we greeted we throw it out so hope in and pull it back in and movie when we pull it back in we we may be trusting that when it comes back here we'll have fish sometimes when we pull that man in it it has other things but one thing about a fish it become a fish when it was caught in the net it was a fish before the mentee and the gospel of Jesus Christ kiss ha the word from God a word from heaven that actually talks to you cussing with you're not a Christian you know that you're supposed to be one when you have been predestinated one see that something ain't no only inside of you always tell you that you're different in the way of the world [Music] you don't feel satisfying about it and there's always a pool there's always a guilty plea that you go through and what people fantasy is that God put that in you that's God so that when the preacher preached your responses he's calling you he's pulling of you because he's trying to clue you into the place where you belong I was born to be a Christian I enjoy being a Christian hallelujah I know I can't be nothing else I know the one thing I know in this life I could be I could be a successful Christian that's by the power of the Holy Ghost not that power taught by might but by my spirit said you know the young boy I used to be afraid of the Holy Ghost I was afraid I saw people jumping I see him I see him jerking at him I'm thinking mine had the bucket hurts I was afraid of oh but one day one day brother he came to me he came to be I tasted up that Holy Ghost and I metalia the world and the world came taken away hallelujah always tell people us and even the best and all of our trials and all my troubles and I've gone through things in this world there's something in me that the devil cannot touch there's always peace in the heart of this is always a solid solid he can't even love the Lord making a choice because you have to George God is a general you're not gonna force you he's not gonna make you do it by making one decision and that is to make Jesus your choice if you desire in your heart [Music] how to
