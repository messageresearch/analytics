[0:44] we're just going to trust god to speak

[0:49] and then pray for rapture in the morning
[0:53] hallelujah matthew 5 verse 2. what
[0:55] you're saying
[0:58] and he opened his mouth and taught them
[1:00] saying
[1:02] blessed are they
[1:07] elected
[1:20] father thank you for your word this
[1:24] evening
[1:35] that we might receive that which you
[1:36] want to speak to us tonight
[1:42] [Music]

[2:13] be mindful of him
[2:15] i hope he ate his wheaties tonight
[2:19] amen amen hope he's ready to go i
[2:22] usually wear out a few interpreters when
[2:24] i go overseas
[2:29] i try to take it easy on you tonight
[2:33] hey man how many appreciate amen the
[2:36] reading of the bible
[2:40] i believe it's god's word
[2:43] i believe that with all of my heart
[2:47] and for a title for a subject this
[2:49] evening
[2:52] i'd like to call this name
[2:56] yeah i would like to announce tonight
[2:59] what are true blessings
[3:03] now i want you to listen to me real
[3:05] careful tonight
[3:07] as we get started in this song
[3:10] because true blessings of god
[3:13] benediction
[3:14] i want to parallel them or liken them
[3:31] was that a person could start in the
[3:33] very beginning of their journey with the
[3:34] lord
[3:38] and they could repent come up
[3:41] so far and not go any further in advance
[3:46] we know that judas was one such person
[3:50] like that
[3:52] brother said he was justified
[3:55] he was sanctified it repented so far
[4:00] till even jesus said that they were
[4:02] sanctified by the word
[4:07] so repentance can come so far
[4:11] and then have a stopping point if you
[4:14] will
[4:16] where a person can come all the way up
[4:18] to say we'll use
[4:19] one through 10.
[4:23] they can come up to a seven or eight
[4:25] i'll let the angels get
[4:41] just because the rain might fall on a
[4:44] person
[4:46] and they might feel happy in their
[4:48] spirits
[4:51] they might feel like rejoicing
[4:54] they might
[5:08] remember what acts 2 38 teaches us
[5:13] to repent and then be baptized
[5:17] in order to receive the holy ghost
[5:20] those that are a part of that
[5:33] in other words like my pastor used to
[5:36] say years ago
[5:48] their sinning days are over
[6:17] what people say they are blessed as
[6:19] college
[6:21] it is a blessing in some degree
[6:25] but it is only the reign of the holy
[6:26] spirit
[6:32] or can fall
[6:35] but there is a blessing reserved for the
[6:38] people of god
[6:41] that is not a partial blessing not a
[6:44] halfway deal in the party the military
[6:59] let's turn galatians chapter 3
[7:03] now let's just read this before we get
[7:05] too deep into this because i want you to
[7:07] see what the scripture says
[7:11] galatians 3 and 13 the scripture teaches
[7:15] us
[7:15] christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[7:17] of the law
[7:20] you can quote it brother you don't have
[7:22] necessarily
[7:23] it might take too much time to find it
[7:25] okay
[7:27] christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[7:28] of the law
[7:32] being made a curse it is written
[7:37] cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree
[7:42] that the blessing of abraham abraham
[7:45] might come on the gentiles
[7:48] through jesus christ that we
[7:53] might receive the promise of the spirit
[8:10] should be the
[8:24] that blessings are not what we thank
[8:26] blessings
[8:28] come on somebody help me appreciate this
[8:30] all the way amen in other words
[8:32] if we are to receive the blessing
[8:36] then there's gonna have to be a
[8:38] sacrifice
[8:40] there's going to have to be a giving of
[8:42] yourself
[8:46] in order to receive the blessing
[8:50] amen stay with me just a little while
[9:24] but christ was the spiritual son of
[9:27] abraham
[9:30] now remember he had three sons
[9:33] isaac ishmael and jesus
[9:37] by the natural promise god made him
[9:40] sacrifice till he got isaac
[9:46] hallelujah abraham went 25 years before
[9:50] that boy showed up
[9:55] god made him wait from the very moment
[9:59] he
[9:59] spoke to him god
[10:02] parked
[10:16] the holy
[10:29] did you know that it is scriptural
[10:35] standing still is not backslid
[10:41] when you've done everything you can
[10:43] can't you have to signature
[10:44] stand
[10:56] and make you wait
[11:12] many years on the lord to do something
[11:16] whether it's in your health whether it's
[11:19] in your family
[11:22] whether it's in your finances
[11:40] uh
[11:56] this is what we call the silent years of
[11:58] the bible
[12:02] 15 years at least
[12:05] 17 years on we don't see anything from
[12:09] jesus from the time he's 12 to 30.
[12:17] and parked him hey and said this time
[12:21] now you're going to grow
[12:22] up
[12:34] because every one of us should be able
[12:35] to identify with what i'm preaching
[12:49] [Music]
[13:32] he
[14:28] hallelujah i said hallelujah amen
[14:31] amen notice the holy ghost pull the
[14:34] bride over
[14:37] make you wait you say that's
[14:40] crazy but jesus
[15:10] smoke you had this shortcut it's in that
[15:14] hour
[15:15] people got discouraged
[15:24] and that's right he didn't
[15:47] [Applause]
[16:05] that the barns were overflowing
[16:10] there was no way that we could have
[16:13] understood this message
[16:17] in the 90s we were still trying to know
[16:26] [Applause]
[16:34] every assembly we're beginning to
[16:36] understand
[16:38] hallelujah amen that's the holy ghost
[16:41] please show us who he is
[16:51] [Music]
[17:00] father revealed to him who he was
[17:43] jesus and john would have been
[17:44] considered cousins by the way
[17:48] but when john saw that pillar of fire
[17:50] over here
[17:51] he said the people call on the face
[17:54] behold the lamb of god
[17:57] takes away the sins of the world
[18:00] amen and then what did god do with his
[18:02] prophets
[18:08] amen that's what god done in this
[18:10] generation
[18:12] took william branham
[19:09] didn't show his plan if we can learn in
[19:11] those times
[19:14] not work not work
[19:22] on
[19:46] [Applause]
[20:02] if he ain't moved yet then i better hold
[20:04] still
[20:06] [Music]
[20:12] [Music]
[20:32] it couldn't have got up not one second
[20:34] earlier than what it was supposed to do
[20:39] from the outside
[20:43] people would have looked at that cold
[20:44] lifeless frame
[21:28] they look at the frame of the church
[21:31] it's like they looked at the frame of
[21:33] jesus
[21:38] the message is dead
[21:41] churches are better than us
[21:53] [Applause]
[22:38] moving
[22:52] is
[23:05] shortly before gettysburg was fought
[23:09] that's in pennsylvania if you don't know
[23:10] american history
[23:14] it's one of the bloodiest of all the
[23:15] civil wars
[23:18] they would halt the armies around the
[23:20] camp
[23:48] taking place
[24:30] the holy
[24:54] [Music]
[25:08] just like it didn't look like anything
[25:10] was happening when job was sitting on
[25:12] that ash
[26:11] the very day that he was burying his
[26:13] sons and his daughters
[26:17] it was because god had been bragging on
[26:19] him
[26:20] yeah they got this
[26:33] because the holy ghost has been bragging
[26:36] on your characters
[26:41] [Music]
[27:00] [Music]
[27:03] where they will not give in or
[27:16] but i will not take my hand off my
[27:18] children for nothing
[27:26] because you've been holding on because
[27:29] he's been holding on to it
[28:15] man without this cross
[28:19] he would have never saw the resurrection
[28:24] don't forget he was one of the first
[28:26] ones
[28:28] to preach to us body change depression
[28:31] oppression
[28:32] enoch and abraham manifested it
[28:37] but job was one of the first scriptures
[28:39] we go to for resurrection
[28:42] selectively
[28:51] so how can you destroy one body and
[28:53] still have flesh
[29:10] that's the resurrection
[29:52] bank
[29:56] blessing is not how well your business
[29:57] is
[30:00] blessing is not whether you got a new
[30:02] car or not
[30:06] the true blessing of the lord
[30:09] comes just like it did to abraham
[30:13] let's look at him okay when god first
[30:16] speaks to this
[30:19] just pick it up in genesis chapter two
[31:15] oh i know it's hard for some of y'all to
[31:16] believe a prophet could be a heathen but
[31:17] he was
[31:18] just saying that who passed your friend
[31:21] prophet yes
[31:24] he was all sinners are heathens
[31:28] we got to get saved
[31:41] that was his identity from the tower of
[31:44] babylon
[31:52] he would carve out of the trees and
[31:54] woods and things
[31:55] he would carve idols
[32:00] have roots if we fairly dull the
[32:03] the the the sin they were heathens
[32:07] god comes to this heathen hey do you
[32:09] have an inner city
[32:10] walk before me and be perfect
[32:17] by the way i'm going to give you a son
[32:18] old man
[32:21] abraham
[32:25] hillary clinton
[32:44] but this is what prophets this is what
[32:45] it's all about right now
[32:48] god gave them these kind of lives for
[32:50] our example
[33:22] if you can number
[33:37] we do the same thing shows god tells us
[33:40] separate
[33:41] jerusalem and a lot comes with us
[33:50] now
[34:00] [Laughter]
[34:05] but when he departed from the presence
[34:07] of the lord
[34:10] with him
[34:14] just like you and i do god
[34:17] god will call us on this journey
[34:21] and we won't separate ourselves from our
[34:23] baggage
[34:29] with us i love the simplicity of the
[34:33] scripture
[34:35] amen i've been looking at his name all
[34:36] these years i didn't see that till the
[34:38] other day
[34:41] but there he is just the same yeah
[34:45] brother said he always was a problem to
[34:47] abraham
[34:51] and god could never fully bless us
[34:58] from the lord that come with him
[35:33] [Music]
[35:56] talking about all their baggage
[35:59] and i could have saved you 29 minutes
[36:01] and 39 seconds
[36:05] if you just be willing to separate
[36:07] yourself from all of that nonsense
[36:38] psychologically get it
[36:43] or how to emotionally receive it
[36:48] i don't want you to carry your baggage
[36:50] at all
[36:52] i want
[37:06] we have a
[37:20] well i wouldn't move forward but no more
[37:26] issues as long as you hold on to that
[37:28] experience
[37:31] you never will move forward amen
[37:34] no doubt abram probably said
[37:38] hey man that's my nephew whatever i
[37:40] can't walk off and leave my name
[37:43] but he did eventually
[37:45] [Music]
[37:46] eventually because god fixed it
[38:06] [Applause]
[38:30] the best thing you can leave no no no no
[38:33] it's all of your lots of the feet of
[38:35] jesus christ

[58:06] god
[58:31] when what we should be doing is stopping
[58:33] my second development
[58:35] dissection and asking them if their soul
[58:37] is prospering
[58:42] don't run to no prayer line

[58:59] half don't know what to do

[59:27] when you receive them and they should
[59:29] kill your body they get it what they

[1:00:44] nowhere

[1:00:48] to prosper themselves

[1:00:54] souls

[1:00:58] and heal your body
[1:01:02] but if you're not feeding your soul on
[1:01:03] the word of god
