[Music] we may stand up on our feet for the ring of the word [Music] yeah normally it takes two hours for the bridge numbers oh we're gonna read in the book of the of number numbers numbers 19 from verse 1. a prescription now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord is commanded saying speak to the children of Israel that they bring you a red Huffer without blemish in which there is no defect and on which a York has never come on you shall give it to the elieza the priest that he may take it outside of the camp and shall be slaughtered before him the sacrificature Elias is and elieza the priest shall take some of uh some of its blood with his finger and sprangle some of its blood seven times directly in front of the Tabernacle of meeting um then the Harford shall be burned in his in his side its hide its flesh its blood and its awful shall be burned foreign and the priest shall take the cedar see the wood and ice up and Scarlet and cast them into the midst of the fire burning they have Not Alone the reading from home then let's go to New Testament efficient efficient chapter five apartheid Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 discover 7 said up to 27 is wife submit to your own husband as the Lord as to the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife as also Christ is the head of the uh the head of the church and he is the savior of the body is therefore just as the church is subject to Christ so let the wives be to their own husband in everything is husbands love your wives just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for her and then do that he might be Sanctified and cleansed with uh cleans her with the washing Waters by the world and find the fair Pareto de families that he might present her to himself as a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but the uh but that she should be holy and without blemish 32 this is a great mystery but I speak concerning cross in the church let us pray wonderful Lord Jesus Christ bless your word that we just read we can see the levels that speaks and interpret law and also bless the heart are going to listen to him in the name of the Lord Jesus we've separate amen amen may God bless you foreign separating Waters and the subtitle it's death brings life two seconds everything that we read in Old Testament it's just a type of a new testament the Old Testament is a shadow and the New Testament is the reality yes so if we see a shot of something passing by the the if you see a shot of an elephant elephant passing by one of us you're not going to expect to see a man passing by real you'll see really a man passing by reality because the shadow it's reflecting the reality and the prophet said all the types that were in the Old Testament All The Parables all the names all the all the types of Samson that you know really that says uh the one who eats from him came something that can we can eat they pray foreign all of that should really reflect what we're living today in decent time in the message the only place of worship the prophet the lands silence the prophet says if the Old Testament was a shadow of a new testament [Music] then the New Testament is a shadow of the reality to come or unveiling God but ultrasound Transit paragraph 337 he said everything you see all the parable of the Bible all the types of the Bible so manifests they are manifested right here before us Manifesto you see the value maintenance this type is manifested before us right now the parable that the Lord Jesus could use all of that are being manifested before because everything should be manifested at the end time in this age that's why the prophet says if God could ask him in which year in which age William Brothers [Music] when you read in Daniel Excel just seal it passes because it's concerning the end time Abram I will see there is Abraham desire to live in this age but he never lived in this age he just graded from afar level John the reveal uh when he saw all the ages passing back apocalypse said this he get to Revelation 10. he wanted to write everything that concerned in the end time on the Asia they told him don't write what you said just silly because this is concerning the last age [Music] there's no gonna be another end time or another last year decrease is because the Antichrist the Antichrist is deploy all his powers around you have taken all the possible colors it makes all the colors now is presenting himself in a uh purple purple color now we let the fish where it's so hard to discover it because he has to fulfill Matthew 24 24. where Jesus said in the last days they are going to perform miracles there is such a point to say juice if possible they elect foreign your message you'll never be received the business because God is not able to remove your name from The Book of uh of the Lamb yeah he can take it away from the uh the book of life but not in the book of uh of the life of the Lamb there's two things the prophet the Judah Prophet said or Judas is he was taken out of the Book of Life in a temper that delivered David he was not in the book of life of the Lamb s Destiny because the book of the life of the Lamb is for the predestinated people once your name is in the book of life it cannot be removed Ephraim Ephraim a done and then they were taken out of the book of course the Daily Dollar Tree because of idolatry but they were not in the book of the life of the Lamb amen amen so I was saying all the type of the Bible of the Old Testament All The Parables some manifested they found they are manifested before right now and God is busy fulfilling them right now the so in the book of numbers that we just read announced anymore they are giving us or they are giving us a teaching Israel is talking to Moses so they they how they they make the Waters of Separation why separation Waters to what they say to what they are useful what were they doing with the separation Waters and where were they getting them and I know we're gonna go slowly and we have another occasion to speak next Sunday shows the first thing full constituations to make separation Waters they could take a red Huffer or choosing the red heifer why the red color the prophet said naturally in uh generally in literature the red the red color is the danger color can we say Amen and I I believe every one of you drives once you get to Lord where there's a traffic light okay the red light either the camera I'm gonna take a picture you've been recorded and you're gonna pay the penalties it's going to pull you over and give you a chance and just because you may lose a lot of things if you don't pay your ticket they can even take away your driver's license and you have a problem to go to work it shows that there's a danger you gotta stop says that's in nature the red color is the color of danger mercy and also poorly choir for believers the red color the person the the call of danger [Music] but for God the red Allah is the call of redemption when we see a red color we see redemptions when we see red we see the blood cells that's the first line the first skull of the the the uh of a rainbow same food that fellas if you got a stage of a perfect man after the base the first color that starts [Music] and the red color shows the love Redemption God so loves the world says shall never perish but he may have eternal life so the red color is the color of redemption they love Redemption and we every day sing about it he died by Grace the Redemption love of God in Redemption God that's a shield Witnesses that's what Paul says that he laughed he called him he glorified he manifested him Islam before we do anything he said comments are coming inside it's like Jacob yeah God said that God loves Jacob and it hurts before those children were born while he is never done anything and Jacob Never Dies but the Bible says it's not because God just left him God have loved us before we do anything so you gotta understand that Redemption once you understand the redemptions in this ruse go and get a red heifer pandem Porter calculator not any other colors but just found a red effort as we just said all those who were in the Old Testament they were Shadows are in a significance everything has a meaning another one took a separately significance and we'll see all those meanings because it's very important for us so that's important it's so important for us the the red color because they don't understand the meaning of the red color for the world the red is a dangerous the red color is the dangerous or they hit a uh they killed a gun I think it is he was laying down that his blood was or flooring you know when they shot somebody police comes and rape him up man inside down today but the blood was still flowing and when people were coming it is uh to to avoid the blood of the Gang foreign pleasure of birth people were afraid the pietino to step on the blood of a gun to step upon the blood of his son to step upon the blood of God the blood of God is the message that's the blood of God we don't have to step on the blood of God we're going to take care of the blood of God especially if I had two drops of the blood of Jesus or in a place in order not to lose if in one drop today and to get me please his blood is more powerful than any other substances what I'm saying in a message or the approach that God provided pressure in 1960 30 June 1960 meaning 23-24 before reading you know Jesus said what the Bible says even if your your sins are red like khamoshi make them white like snow come on Flavor now enter the practice do you know how Branham is interpreting this especially he's saying when God is looking at us in regard he doesn't look at us with his name he said above us there's a blood office Ezekiel is the blood of the Lord Jesus in our lives with a red Sin [Music] there's so they're so rude even if your sins are right now I've met them white like yes God was going to make it to White through the blood of Jesus which is red it means when God look at look at us through his uh the red blood of his son the Lord Jesus foreign becomes white like snow it is he said cleanse me in the blood and that shall be wider than snow you cannot have another thing will appreciate this all these all songs of uh Salvation

to me if you want to speak to me he entered into a vision before he was convinced how he was living and after that he saw the the the group yeah then he saw the group turning around and the anger of God was coming down to strike the world while God's anger was coming unto foreign [Music] [Music] we're gonna Jessica foreign they're red true and the red it gives white the regardless just look something red through another race it's a symbol that when God looked through our sins through the blood of his son Jesus the Lord Jesus our sins are red like Christmas our sins that are red like red
