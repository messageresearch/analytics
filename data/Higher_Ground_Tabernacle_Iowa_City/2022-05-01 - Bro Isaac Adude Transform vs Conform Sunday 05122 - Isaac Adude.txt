[Music] transforming versus conforming transforming versus conforming okay because i i took my uh inspiration in romans chapter 12 verse two paul was telling the saints not to be conformed to this world but to be transformed foreign so according to google to confirm means to act in accordance with expectations [Music] expectative to behave in a murder of others [Music] dean manier community especially as a result of the social of social oppression especially so in other words is to be influenced by other people a lot of them that's what conforming means means to change greatly the appearance of changing chances to change in nature to changing hearts character changes and every night every night all those you know his friends and his fellow classmates was going out to partying but that young man was different than the others because every night when the sun was going down he was going on the top of the mountain so there were this old man who knows that you know every every time that he was doing the same thing and one day he asked him but why you know why don't you go and party with the others and there there is a country a aeolc and in that country there's a city and in that city there's a house and in that house there's a woman farm that i promised that i will come back so every time that i look over there there is a connection between between us that makes me remember of the promise that i made uh souvenirs that is the reason why it's keeping me to be confirmed to those people that's why i don't [Music] she refused to behave like others the prince who is that's why paul says that we don't have to confirm we don't we you know we not we want uh uh that that's what paul asked her not to be confirmed to this demand to be transformed transforming amen to be transformed and to look like jesus amen the more we hear the word the more we become like the more the time is going with the time is passing the more close to the closer we get to everything in us has to be changed everything in us has to be changed you'll see that transforming means also amen to convert doesn't mean that you leave a catholic church and then you join the message that's not that's not being converted it's an impossible conversation it doesn't mean that you leave this church and you join the other churches it doesn't mean that you renounce this religion and then you you become a part of it [Music] uh uh luke 22 verse 32. you see here jesus is talking to peter you see jesus yeah and this is almost about when when jesus was about to uh to be crucified meaning that at this time peter has done miracles peter prayed for i mean peter prayed for prayed for people and the god that was they were healed he meant peter was was was uh one of the elders of jesus christ's essence but if you hear hear when jesus was talking to peter said that but i have prayed but you asked me but what isaac but peter is done those you know he prayed for the sick and they were healed amen he was in jesus christ church you know jesus christ but how come you know throughout all those years that he spent with jesus jesus tell peter you know go to this you find money in the belly of the fish [Music] miracles he saw all those great things you know peter himself said that lord we left our families we left our wives we left their homes but here at the end of the life of jesus amen jesus is telling peter peter you're not converted but wait until you are converted then go strengthen your brethren so what is converting what means what to convert what it is what is that amen to be converted by converting it means to be filled with the holy spirit incentive amen to be converted after converting amen is when you have the spirit of jesus christ that when jesus was talking to them amen the holy spirit was not sent to the spirit that's why none of them were converted [Music] as paul was saying you means that you have the holy spirit inside of you somebody have all the sentences because that's the only thing that will keep you to be confirmed that's the only thing that will keep you from being from being influenced says i don't know the french you say uzia you z-z-i-a-h i don't i don't i don't i don't remember the french name of the update you know who was i mean he was king since he was 12 amen but but when he got older he felt him you know he was he fell himself with so much confidence uh he last until my confidence and you want to do the the the work of a chief priest foreign and god you know god bless god cursed him with labor amen and then you'll see that the the the that prophet saw him allah said prophet lavi amen because they kind of grew up together and he persecuted his life was influenced by him but when he saw him he was devastated but can't you love me in a day for my device he had to come back to himself he never revealed he meant to go talk to god amen why did what why his life didn't change because he knew what was inside of him that circumstance didn't move him because god would he knew exactly he knew his experience with god circumstances that's the only thing that would keep us from being from being confirmed with the world i lost the experience giving us an example of a church of two churches in the bible allah you see an example amen one church that was transformed in english getting transformed in the other church that was confirmed to that evil age let's turn to uh first corinthians chapter five verse one amen first corinthians chapter five premier convention peter sanchez even here the bible says that here's paul talking to the corinthians church this is it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one shall have his father's wife and you are puffed up and have no rather mourn that he that has done i'm sorry that he that has done this deed might be taken [Music] amen so now this is another uh now let's go to ephesians chapter five you see that paul is talking to those two churches you see paul paul i said this and first corinthians 5 and ephesians chapter 5. now you're letting me constitutionally assign to a efficient the bible says that be therefore followers of god as dear children yeah yeah yeah that's right be therefore followers of god as dear children and walk in love as christ also has loved us and has given himself for us and an offering and sacrifice to god and sweet smelling savor but fornication and all uncleanness or covertness let it be not once named among you as becometh sent neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks amen this is you know in ephesians you know this is how paul wanted the church to be satan seeker paul flake amen but if you read the first corinthians of civilization paul amen but when he comes here to the ephesian church this defense amen he's telling them that those things let it not be named among you amen because you are you are higher than you you know you are in the other level amen and we are the the ephesian church a new new song is the fact that amen we have to behave in a certain way that other will look at us and take us as examples now you know now in the beginning when god created men and women and god put inside of them at thirst amen that thirst that will push them to go look for god he put inside of them a thirst that will push them to go serve god to go do everything but now you see that the devil knowing the power of that thirst he wanted to create a substitute in substitute america he wanted to create created something that would that would resemble to that thirst because he knows that you know a person who is thirsty everything until it is so now you see that the devil in the he said well you know i mean came to eve he said well well god said this but if you do this there is another result you know you know what you pray for to pray god didn't want you to become like him to see everything like he leaf that that was given to them amen it wasn't a permanent you know a permanent clothes it was like a religion religion you can't hide behind religion amen that's why you know what that's what that's what happens to to many of us all of us when we do something wrong find a way out we're always i did this because i couldn't instead of us manufacturing that life only the fabric [Music] [Music] in life welcome you can go to church and look at how christian copy every movement you try to copy how they say you say you try to copy how they walk she said dimitri commander you try to copy how how they talk but there is a time limit there will be a time where you won't be able to come back [Music] it's the had happened to do that you accomplish that same work you had to have the original one amen amen and that that's why the devil you know that's how they were trying to fool people that's the same thing he did with jacob jacob amen if you read the life of jacob you know in genesis chapter 25 at the birth of jacob god told his parents exactly what was supposed to happen god told you you know jacob's mom that you know the the the elder will serve the youngest amen but growing up their father kind of mixed up everything amen but it happens that in genesis chapter 27 may oversee verses because she knew the promise that the v and he come unto his father and said my father and he said his father said uh uh here i hear am i who my son comes from so for the first time jacob was asked this question who are you a poor premier foreign [Music] amen jacob went to his father with a fake identity in force identity a man jacob went to his father with a you know a faith with a faith a fake name [Music] [Music] that blessing didn't really help jacob set benediction apart from my days according to amen he was blessed but trouble was always coming back amen he was blessed but because he went to his father with a fake identity when you come here in in genesis chapter 32 amen now jacob has definitely in front of him he says amen now the situation is becoming not real now everything is now serious he's a matter of definition opportunity to meet the angels and now you'll see that the second time at the end someone asked jacob what what what his name amen and he said verse 26 he said and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except doubt bless me are you ready sir this is genesis 32 tandoori genesis 32 verse 26 genesis [Music] and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except they'll bless me now verse 27 the bible says that and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob jacob and and then the angel said and he said that name shall be called no more jacob by israel for as the prince has dealt power with god and with men and has prevailed [Music] amen you see that the first time when jacob was asked for his name but here the second time the engine asked jacob about what what was that who launched the mansion amen jacob found himself in a position where he couldn't manufacture that life anymore lord you know that i lied to you lord you know that i killed you too lord you know that i do but you shall feed the profession and lord here i am once he said you are telling me and you see that from that time that he gave that he told the angel who he amen we have to go straight to the point because he said that if you to those who search me in sincerity those are the the people who will find me that was the same thing that was required to the prophet salallahu [Music] god told the children of israel to keep the living out of their homes because the leaven is something that is not pure god wanted them to be pure allah foreign amen god wanted them to be to be honest he told them to take their living amen because sincerity is is the most important thing [Music] your identity amen the bible says that and the keeper of the prison awakening this is in the this is another example and i found in acts chapter 16 verse 27 [Music] at 16 27 to 13 to 31 act says so you'll see that this man is different than jacob amen this meant so how paul i mean let's let's read it first at 16 27 to 31 access vance and the keeper of the prison awaking a working out this of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew he drew out the sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners have been fled but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we all hear then he called for a light and springing and came trembling and fell down before paul inside this verse alley and broke them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved in thy house and they speak unto him the word of lord and to all that were in this house amen here you'll see that this man who was keeping paul and silas in prison amen he's so poor and sad is how they were behaving he kept them in prison for i don't know a day or two i don't know how long amen he saw at what time paul was praying for how many times paul was praying every day to go and to go copy whatever paul and silas were doing and manufacture [Music] they told him exactly what he was supposed to do amen amen that believe in the lord jesus notice the response of paul remember amen paul also saw this man's life maybe all the negative things about this session but when this man went to paul and said what my side of the business paul never told that man what that person had to stop doing paul and apartheid paul never told him that you have to pray three times a day you know your party cannot be yet for a pastor paul never told him that you have to stop smoking amen paul told him that to believe in the lord jesus amen because you knew that once he believed in the lord he has the holy spirit amen the change will come amen is that the prophet in south africa the prophet amen when he was praying and preaching amen all those women they didn't have their clothes remember when the holy spirit came because the sentence the prophet never told them amen by the rain and the god the holy spirit is the most important thing [Music] amen many people think that you know many people say but where brother isaac i had an experience with god this cannot face actually but you have to make sure that that experience not once is not one-time experience set the experience in the past your mind explains because you understand that when the king wanted to choose when the king wanted a bride in a time of history esther wasn't the only person to go talk to the king in other words esther wasn't the only woman who had an experience with the king she wasn't the only one who had an experience with the kids very inexperienced all of them were going to the king alexander [Music] that doesn't mean that you know that's it that doesn't mean that it's the final thing you have to make sure that your experience is the same thing with what is inside of you your life is is reflecting how many of them got into the promises because what was inside basketball was different than what from what was on the outside still here amen that's why the inside has to be changed amen he was in the most holiest church list his pastor was jesus christ judas was taking care of all the fighters amen amen it doesn't matter how beautiful is your voice it doesn't matter how good is your sermon it doesn't matter if you serve him but as long as your inside is not i thought that i was one of them and jesus trusted me he gave me to take care of all the money in the end my my the inside wasn't changing you have to search this close now you have to pay attention if you keep saying well i don't condemn me to do this to see and it doesn't condemn me to do that achievement part of our faces see you know doing those things of the world studying i'm going to hurt you just a little bit okay pull the feathers back to the other way but but it's this one sure evidence that you have never been to christ you've never been born again you know in exam for example you say well i don't condemn me you know gossiping i don't i don't feel anything when i gossip amen the prophet says that this is one of this is one thing that says that you have never been to christ you've never been born again amen the prophet continues to say that he that loves the world and the things of the world the prophet continues the love of god is not even in heaven now if you just quit doing it because you know you ought to do it a simple [Music] anywhere yet celestine when that thing becomes dead in focus it shows some mocked while that thing becomes deadly new infection and the nature of it's gone away amen we produce that spirit in you a he chose that before the foundation of the world they say do you think it's wrong to smoke the prophet said that what are you asking about it foreign if it's a question in your mind what happened leave it alone for anything you don't do by faith is sin seen that's right second hectic got to be by faith two seconds so how can you smoke and have faith hello it's right in your conscience it's right in your conscience uh it shows it shows you it shows you that you're wrong so it says here that so if it's uncertain you better leave it alone now listen he said that cause because that might be the one thing that keeps you out of the kingdom of god amen if there's a question to it see here in question leave it alone let's say said question amen you were closed and you're questioning yourself is this right or wrong if you're asking yourself questions since you come after the person they can shut up sir just leave it alone because that might be the one thing that can keep you out of the kingdom amen whatever whatever situation is all a situation amen if you're asking yourself questions you just better leave it alone amen because you have to do everything by faith basket two seconds because things that you don't do by faith is a sin question amen and nobody wants to miss the kingdom of god a new heart also will not give you and a new spirit will not put within you learn the voice and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statue amen here ezekiel is saying that god will give you first a new heart [Music] a little voice amen he will take away that stony heart out of you first and it gives you a new heart and a new spirit that new heart and that new spirit lean voice please it's not the holy spirit amen it's only a heart and a spirit that will make you get along with the words [Music] of what did you remember you understand that about ezekiel continue and say that and i will put my spirit within you a convocation you have to be given a new heart myself you have to receive a new spirit whatever i say foreign we will help you to keep his judgment said speech jesus said that you can't put a new wine in an old bottle a it will explode explosive amen that's why ezekiel said that you have first to receive that spirit first to receive that that that that heart first amen and that spirit is not a spirit that will help you imitate something it's a spirit that will change you tell us it's the main spring says uh if i can have that picture limage it's you know it's the main it's the main spring inside of us it's a spirit this watch has many wheels in the mechanical watch the the most important thing is the main spring this thing that's the most important thing in the mechanism amen because the main spring the main spring is like a horse because the main spring is the thing that will turn all those wheels amen without the main mainspring the watch will not give you the time without the mainstream without the mainspring it doesn't matter how many gold this watch has the the the the the la cantida man it doesn't matter if this watch has been given to you by the king by the queen of england [Music] amen if that watch doesn't have the mainspring it can be called a watch on people that play in the mountain because you won't be able to tell the time basketball uh amen and all the gifts and all the gift that you can receive from god amen you need to have this work this mainstream principle to make your song mean being meaningful and comprehensive amen to make your sermon being being made meaningful amen you have to have the main spring whatever have worked amen the main spring is the holy spirit amen that's what you need say sit down amen you need to have that holy spirit forever about the sentence amen you need that holy spirit the sentence please amen to god you're telling us what [Music] the bible says that though i speak with tongues of men and of angels and if not charity charity i am become a sounding grass and tinkling symbol versus [Music] and though i have the gift of the of prophecy and understand all the mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity nothing and now verse 3 and though i bestow all my goods to be uh to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity he profiteth me nothing versus you know if you pay close attention to the last verse here verse 3. [Music] you know it's you know paul verse 2 first of all paul said that if you have all the understanding of the you have to give to the prophet said you see someone giving oh he's good to people to feed the pool he goes even further than that he gives his own body to be burned he continues amen amen for example your brother is about to be you know they want to kill your brother or your friend someone giving his own life for someone support but if you do this and you don't have charity civil effect that means nothing says amen it's like that watch it's a second set month hey man he has all the gold in the lightning [Music] oh simply feel like if i could only had the knowledge don't leave off the mainspring no matter how pretty it looks [Music] how much of a watch it looks like memphis we can call ourselves foursquare assembly or presbyterian or baptism we can't call ourselves pentecostals no proponents are playing some depending whatever we want to two seconds i play but as long as that means spring the holy ghost isn't there taking off love nepali joy peace and goodness we're just putting a show we're just putting on the show we can call ourselves brandon knight whatever name you know the ones that play the friend like what kill none of them amen but as long as you don't have that mean spring the holy ghost oh shillong thank you very personally a name or a brain doesn't save leno amen the name or the brain or the church that you go to doesn't save you less amen in the message i believe uh uh the only place of worship the last one that he preached he says that if i if i bring you out or i take you out of the denomination and all of this if i want to bring you somewhere the prophet saws but the only place to go is in jesus it's in jesus christ amen and then jesus christ is inviting us he says as you are come to venice when he says that go go in the city and invite all those people men blind men and all those everywhere bring them here bring them in a minute but you'll understand that before they go before they get into the room something has to change first they were given a andre da la salle they had to watch themselves and they had to be given a hob amen but that's why we said that you know you go to church as you are you come to church there is only one uniform in your king cell uniform amen there is only one uniform yeah uniform and that uniform is the holy spirit uniform so the center speech amen that uniform is divine love uniform because when the prophet went over there am i the only thing that he saw was divine amen that was the only thing that mattered was the only thing that was required [Music] to the holy spirit [Music] when [Music] and panda can someday [Music] because if the dare for satan himself amen can go to god see
