in the name of the Lord Jesus and we so happy to be here and seeing some new faces amen and some old faces that are nowen so we GRE you on the name of Lord Jesus amen Mark 11 verse 22-25 on my way down here I was driving with when I was driving down here I had a thought I wanted to preach about something else my subject was going to be manifested in the flesh amen but the convers the that we were having in the car me to change my my sermon this morning so we pray that it's the leading of the Holy Spirit we pray that it is the leading of the holy spirit amen and somebody now needs to let's turn to Mark 11 uh we read the verse 22 to 25 the Bible says and Jesus answering sayith unto them have faith in God you for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he sath shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have [Music] them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses amen I like the verse 24 so I'm going to read it again amen the Bible says that therefore I say unto you that whats you amen notice here the Bible didn't say God didn't say whatsoever I desire amen but the Bible says whatsoever youire amen so he did not name the kind of Desire that you have but it's all included in that verse whatever youire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen if we can have that same faith and thatal attitude amen I will assure you that at the end of the before even this service because the word of God doesn't lie amen let's pray again father God we just read your word Lord Lord as a human we can only read and turn the P Lord but you are the only one who can give us the revelation of the that's why Lord I pray father Lord that you come down and you to us this morning Lord bless the hearts that will receive this word father God let build our faith again one more time thank you Jesus in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you may be seated uh for a few time uh we will wanted to share with you a little subject we entitle who are you amen who are you amen I preached this uh last time in De I feel like preaching it again so who are you amen here it's not asking about you telling us your name or where you from or but the question is what is your relationship with God amen who are you to God Amen because you need to have faith somehow amen and as you go and when you have faith you need to When you pray you need to know who you are amen if somebody comes now and ask me to pray for him amen I will pray for him as being a servant of God Amen I I have faith that it's God who sent me to pre so therefore I have that duty to pray for that person because I know who I am to God Amen and I know who God is to me amen so now who are you amen so we have to know that faith is the key amen I'm sorry the word is the key and faith is the is the hand that opens the key to that door am so you can read entire Bible you can't read entire Bible read that same Bible three times four amen but if you don't have the faith to apply those things in your life that means nothing because notice that when we starting in verse 22 amen Jesus started by saying that have faith in God so every time we go to God In Prayer am we must first have faith in him am amen we must first believe in him know who he is to us so that we know that when we go to him in prayer amen he will give it to us an example I give a little kid you have a little child amen who wants something from his dad or his parent it doesn't matter how many times the dad says no as long as he still needs that thing amen he will come after after and after Amen to ask about that same until the will be fed up of saying no what because you know the child knows that this is my dad this is my mom and I'm a child and I'm in need so technically they are required to give me what I need so when he's asking his parents something amen that kid would not ask ask as if he's asking to his uncle because he said that when when he knows that when if I ask my Uncle my uncle says no and that's it I won ask if I ask my dad my dad says no amen I will try after I will try to behave and do do my house stuff and clean the house and just to make him happy and then go back and ask amen and that's the same mental attitude we have to have towards God Amen when we go to God we have to know who he is to us amen so that we can have the faith to ask amen the prophet here says in the message if God be with us then we're all the Miracles amen he says that faith is not that loose loose that's not it's got to be based upon some noted fact you've got to know something about what you're having faith inen you can't just go to God and stop praying without even know who is God to amen you can't just stop praying without even know who you're asking it to so you've got to know something about what you having faith in before you can even have faith in it so we first must know how and what what the of God is what God's is and how to approach God by that plan and then we can walk up Bly to the throne of grace and plead what Isis amen it's by having faith in what ask amen it's by having faith to who you asking foren you have to know who God is to you amen through service I just want you amen and hopefully by the end of the service you can have an answer amen who are because theet says inag 33 it says that as I said the other day when we born of the spirit of God God is not weak one little sh just the little of then you've got all you got enough power in you to make a world and go out and live in it the prophet did not say that you need to have a bigger he did not say that you have to have I don't know what me but if you have that little that little faith that little faith amen that little of God Amen you've got all power you got the power of God living inside if you have God inside because you can take water from the sea and fill it up in this bottle amen and if you go to the lab and try to see the chemical uh the the chemical stuff in that water compare it to the water it it will have the same compound will have the same structure he will have the same DNA but this is just the smallest portion that big it doesn't make this one different the ofing the water of the ocean that's in the bottle will also be able to heal you same thing amen but in a small amen that's the same thing with the Holy Ghost the prophet says that in the beginning was the thought of God the beginning was the thought that thought was was was made that thought became the spoken word amen and that word amen God cond himself to a form amen amen so notice now in the upper room amen when the 100 I believe 12 were there in theer the Bible says that Tong of fire came amen and it was upon every one of them so technically what the Bible saying that one same big God Amen who was in there before the beginning who created everything amen who condensed himself to a form that we call the divided himself into different amen and went into every one of those people that why when they left their room these people were able to do the exact same thing that Jesus did why because their inside nature was changed they had God inside of them it didn't matter the big how big that portion was or small that portion that was still God inside that's why you can see Peter going out and say that silver and gold I have not but what I have I give it so now stand up and walk that's why you can see Paul walking and seeing people being healed by only tou what was that that was the same power of God that was living that was the same power of God walking inside had all power didn't how small that was God that was living inside and Peter when he went to when he started preaching he say that This Promise is for you is for your children amen and for how many as God will mean that we have that same promise for our meaning that if you have the holy spirit amen you have God inside of you you have all power of God Amen so you can lay your hands on the sick people you can ask God something and that will happen you have inside of you amen the prophet said that God is not weak in one place and strong in the other am just having that little shadow of gives you all the power he gives you that power that created the entire gives you that power that let the light be it gives you that power that LE be and that says that but if you are a son son of God or a daughter of God you've got the power of God in see so then that law holds that Faith to a certain thing amen if you call yourself a son or daughter of God you have the power of God inside of youen you have the god inside of so it doesn't matter what you're going through amen when you go through Tres or trials ask yourself this question who am I amen when you will have that answer amen you will know that you will have strength to over Amen in front of them was the king that was there amen the king said that if you don't worship me you cast into the the only thing that they knew they knew who they were and they knew who God they knew that they were God's servant and God will always come for their rescue so even when they were going to that fire amen they had no doubt amen that God will come for amen they had no doubt even though they get burned amen they had no doubt that they knew that they would never forsake God and God will always take care amen you have Daniel Amen when he was going to the alliance then amen it's something that has never happened before amen a man going to a den of lions that are hungry Haven days ask Daniel what helped you what hold you up he would tell you that I know who I am and I know who God is to me amen I know the God that I serve man I know that he's able to close to to shut the light the mouth of those amen I know who I am amen so we also the prophet here says in perfect Faith amen he says that now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are amen have faith in what you are amen have faith in what the word says that you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God amen he had faith in the word of God that said what he was amen it is written of me didn't David say in the Psalms I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven A amen I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I'm all these things I am that I am and he knew with that perfect Faith amen that he was the anointed Messiah that that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I in myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you amen it's made manifest amen for you are a Believer for you are a Believer see and a Believer amen it's the faith of God that moves in you amen have faith in what the Bible says you are amen have faith in what Amen in in what you are amen Jesus had faith in what he was knew who exactly who he was look at when he went to that that foolish man the the maniac the devil they saw him coming amen and they started saying but why are you coming to terine us ter us amen but you'll see that Jesus during his entire life amen during Jesus life people been calling him names amen people call him amen people call him for Fortune ters people call him all kinds of Nam names the you know the angel of death and you name it amen but the Devil Himself knew who Jesus was the Devil Himself knew who Jesus wasen the prophet says that but the strange thing was that the devil's the devil turned around and said no he's not amen he is the son of God God Amen God will make the devil testify amen God will make the devil testify his enemies that is the Son of God that devil said that I know who you are amen you the only you the Holy One of Israel I know who you are amen are the only one of Israel amen the devil knew who Jesus was amen because Jesus had faith in what the Bible said amen Jesus knew that he was the the one that was sent to set us free and that Faith kept him amen when he was about to give it all up amen he said that Lord if it's your will let this cup pass let this pass amen Jesus was at the point of his life where he wanted to give up amen I can't take this anymore amen just couldn't bear as a amen but he had faith in what he was amen he had faith in what the Bible said he was so he knew that Amen to save us amen he had to save us he had to drink from that cup amen he had faith in what in who he was that kept him going amen the devil knew who Jesus was amen the devil knew who Paul and Sil was amen when those people trying to imitate them he told them he said Jesus said know and Paul I know but you I don't know because they have faith in what the Bible says so now who are you amen let's turn to John 15 14- 16 John 15 amen who are you amen these are some answers that can help you out [Music] amen verse 14 here is Jesus talking amen he says that you are my friends if you do what I command I love verse 15 it says that I no longer call you servant because a servant does not know his master's business instead I have called you friends for everything that I learned from my father I have made known to you amen so who are you who are you I'm a friend of God Amen I am the friend of God Amen he called me his friend amen he says that I'm no longer servant amen I am his friend amen and between friends amen we do have privileges amen there are something that I can only tell my friends something that I can only do to my friends amen a friend can come and ask you for something amen even though you don't have it but you will do your best to give whatever he ask amen so Jesus is Calling you my friend I no longer call you servant but I call you my friend amen as a friend of God am you can go to him as being his friend Lord I need this Lord I'm in need of this thing and because you are his friend amen he will give it to you amen Jesus calls you his friend he says that because now it's time for me to tell you the secret amen it's time for me to give you the revelation of the word because as a friend there are certain secrets that you can only tell some your friends it's the same thing with the Revelation there are some scriptures that can only be revealed to you amen because you are called God's friend amen look at Abraham amen Abraham was called God's friend and when God was about to leave amen he say he tell he turned his back and he said that sh I hi to Abraham what I'm about to do amen there is a secret that I'm about to tell to my friend because Abraham is my friend amen so therefore Abraham my friend I'm going to tell you what I'm about to do in why because Abraham was called the friend of God Amen so now you are called a friend of God Amen I no longer call you servant call you friends amen because I tell you Secrets amen you did not choose me verse 16 you did not choose me you did not choose me but I chose you and I apped you so that you might go and bear fruit fruit that will last and so that whatever you ask in my name the father will give you amen amen you did not choose me but I chose you amen you did not call me your friend but I called you my friend amen I am the one who called you my friend amen I'm the one who chose you so because I chose you amen you can go and ask whatever you want you can go ask the father whatever you want long as you ask it in my name you go to pray and you say God I am asking you as a friend of Jesus Amen and the father will give it to you why because he called you my friend amen so you can go ahead and take my name use it for whatever thing that you want use it for whatever circumstances that you find yourself amen use it for whatever situation you find yourself in amen I'm calling you my friend so go ahead and go use my name go pray to the father in the name of Jesus Christ amen and the father will give it to will give you whatever you want amen I called you my friend you did not choose me but I chose you amen so when you go through trials amen ask yourself who am I your first answer I'm God's friend I am a friend of God so therefore because I'm a friend of God Amen I I can go to him any time at any moment any place amen I can call him because he's my friend amen sometimes with friends we do call each other 3: a.m. and stay along and talk for six hours we can call between friends we come and we Fellowship you know that you have to work at 8 but you still Fellowship until 6 a.m. amen because that's called friendship amen that's that relationship and God is calling you my friends amen so you can go to him at any time you're not disturbing him amen he's expecting you to come amen so anytime you need him amen just go amen prayer is that direct line that has no boundaries it's that line that goes straight to God Amen and he's giving it to you because you are his friend he's calling you my friend so take advantage of that amen use it amen use it as you do with your friend am sometimes between friends I ask you for money and you give me because I know that you my friend I'm might not even give you back it's all included in that friend friendship God is calling you my friend so take advantage of that amen use it go to go to the father in my and you will he will give you whatever you asking amen you are God's friend amen so now let's turn to Romans chapter 8 verse 33 to 39 amen who are you I am God's friend I am the friend of Amen Romans 8 ver 33 the Bible says that who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that who are you I'm God's elect amen he's calling you you are the elect of God so as being the elect of God who can condemn you of anything no amen it's God that justify amen justif justification is bringing the balance back to zero it doesn't matter if you saw me doing that thing amen as long as I go to my friend and ask for forgiveness amen you have no right to accuse me of anything amen because God Amen has Justified me amen I am his elect and who shall lay anything to the charge amen nobody can dare doing that because I'm the elect of God Amen it's God that justifies amen who are you I am God's friend who are you I am God's elect amen verse 34 who is he that that condemn that that it is Christ that died who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yet rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us amen who are you I am God's friend I am God's elect so now who is God to you amen he's my prayer Warrior amen he's always there making intercession for me he's always they are praying for me amen when I feel tired when I feel sick when I'm in need am I know that there is a God praying for me there is a God interceding for me am he's there praying for me because he even say that in John I think John 17 amen he says that father I'm praying for these ones I'm praying for my he was praying for his displ amen but not only for these ones amen but I'm also praying for the ones that you will call after which means that I am included in that group amen so I can go and walk boldly amen say that Jesus prayed for me Jesus is praying for me Jesus is interceding for me amen he's there praying for me when I'm in need when I'm in trouble amen I don't have to worry about anything amen I don't have to fret because I know that Jesus is there pray who is Jesus to you he's my prayer Warrior he intered for me because I am his friend because I am his elect that's why he's praying for me amen verse 37 B says n in all this things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us amen who are you I am God's friend I'm God's elect I'm a conqueror I'm loved by God Amen so I don't care what the devil can say am I don't care what the devil can do to me I know who I am I'm a conquerer a conqueror is somebody who wins battles amen a conqueror is somebody who has victories amen so that is who I am I am a Victorious amen I am a conqueror amen I am loved by God Amen so as long as I'm loved by God I know he will take good care of me so who are you amen I am God's friend amen I am God's elect I am the Conqueror amen I am loved by God Amen here the Bible did not even say that you are a conqueror he said that you are more than a con so the Bible trying to find words to explain who you are it say that being a conqueror is not enough but you are more than a conqueror Amen in all these things we are more than a conqueror through him that loved us he loves Meen who am I I'm more than a conqueror amen so this little troubles that I'm going through these little trials that I'm going through I know that there is coming a day my victory is coming I can't feel my victory coming so therefore I can go and profess that I'm a Victor therefore I can go and say that I'm a conquer I am more than a conqueror amen verse 38 for I am persuaded that neither death that nether death verse 38 for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels no principalities no powers nor things present or things to come no height nor depth nor any other SC creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen I don't care if you call yourself an angel amen I don't care you say that God sent me I know one thing for sure you have no power to separate me from the love of God amen because he said that he loved me so if you are an angel amen take your angel and go back because you cannot separate me from the love of God I don't care even if I'm hungry or broke or whatever I know one thing for sure God loves me doesn't matter you throw me so high amen you throw me is so deep where there is no light or anything one thing will never change the love of God Amen so that's what one those three Hebrew children when they were going to that fire they knew one thing would not change even though they're burned they knew that the love of God will still there the love of God will always be present with him so we can walk and go to that fire still praise God amen amen amen they knew that so they were going to that fire praising God thanking God for his amen thanking God for his Mercy thanking God for calling

God loves me amen I'm more than a conqueror I'm called I'm a love of I'm I'm a friend of God Amen he chose me amen there is something about being chosen by amen sometimes you're trying to think in your entire life you try to do some you know thinking and ask yourself why did he choose me amen I am not the best of Christians am I sin every day amen I don't even know the word as many people do amen sometimes I can barely serve him but why did he choose me amen I have no answer for that amen he chose me I did not ask him to choose so that means that because he chose me he would never leave me he will always be with me amen because he chose me he will always be with he gave his promise amen that I will be in you amen I will be with you even in you amen till the end of the world because he chose me amen I did not choose him amen he's holding my hand I'm not holding his hand but he's holding my hand no matter even if my hand is tired amen I cannot just decide to let go because I'm not the one holding him he's the one holding every time I'm tired know that you can relax know that God is holding you because he chose you you did not choose him amen he's holding you amen you are not holding him amen he's the one who amen so relax amen have faith in God Like Jesus say have faith in God and because you are my friend because I chose you you can go to the father and anything in my name and believe that what you ask will come to pass because I chose because I chose you you've been chosen by God amen you've been chosen by God Amen you can't you know it does sometimes it doesn't make sense sometimes it doesn't make sense amen you can sit here from now to I don't know when trying to figure out why God chose you you will never come amen but one thing that you will have to know that his love will always be there amen because I am persuaded that neither death nor life No Angels no powers no things present no things to come no height nor depth nor any other creatures amen will be able to separate me from the amen which is in Christ Our Lord amen because he loved me amen he chose me so therefore I can go and walk amen with my head held up high amen with my my my my my

that even he was able to send the cross Amen to go feed Elijah amen he's the same God Amen who will take care of amen he said that don't think about tomorrow don't think about what you shall eat tomorrow because me the God who takes care of the little bird amen I know that I will take care of you he takes care of the little bird but you are bought with his blood amen he bought you with his blood so which means that you are even more important than Jesus blood amen so because you are important amen he will always take care of you so just relax just have faith God will take care of you even if it will take him to change the law for your favor he will do it because you are son amen he will do it because you are his elect amen stay back let go and let God Amen let him break call him

God will come amen you thrown in the fiery furnace God will come amen people making fun of you amen people saying things people doing things you just relax amen he fights my battle amen I am not the one who fighting amen he's the one amen he fights on my body amen he takes care of me amen so I am more than a conqueror amen I am loved by God Amen I am his friend amen I am a conqueror I am God's elect so who are you amen you all of that you're God's friend amen sometimes friends are more than Brothers amen sometimes friends are more than Brothers amen so he did not call you his brothers but he called you my friend some secret we don't tell our brothers we go find that one friend and you go and you talk to him amen and God is calling you my friend amen Revelation 1 verse 6 who are you I am God's friend I am the elect of God I am more than a conqueror Revelation 1 verse the Bible says that and he has made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for [Music] and who are you I'm a king amen amen who are you I'm a priest Prince amen you see in the Kingdom the king is number one amen when you go in the temple amen you have the priest there amen he's the one who will go with your prayers amen to pray for you amen the king is there number one telling his servants what to do so who are you I'm a king I'm a priest being a priest means that you have the you know you have the open line to go to God Amen you can go and talk to God because notice that in the temple Amen in the Hol of holies amen even the prophet was not allowed to go beyond the Cur it was only the chief priest was allowed to go there once a year and and prayers of the entire country amen God is calling you a priest which means you have access to the throne room amen you have access to the you can go to that Throne Room any time any moment under any circumstances any situation because you are are a priest you have a green light to go you have the access card when you go the Angels know that you are there still making a way because you you don't even have to have a r with him you just go you don't need to set up an appointment you just [Music] go who are you I'm a king So as a king I tell people what to do amen I can tell the devil what to do amen as a king I can tell to that sickness to get away amen as a king I can speak the word and nothing thing because I am a king there's no one else above amen I am the most powerful amen I am a king so my word every time I pronounce must be taken very seriously and with consideration why because I am a king when I say that this thing is supposed to be done my servant will start running to do it why because I am a king so God is calling you a king so speak the word to your speak the word to your problemen speak the word to your sickness speak the word to your circumstance whatever you need speak the word be done why because you are a king because you are a priest have access to the amen you are a king you are a priest you are God's friend you are the elect of God you are loved by God Amen so all of that just in favor of you amen so you can go to God and say it go to God he will let you go because you are all take advantage of that amen John 15 [Music] verse John 15 verse ver the bible say that if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen look at the confidence coming from Jesus mouth when he's W amen he's telling you without a doubt that if you abide in me and my words abide in you then go ask whatever you want and it will be done why because you abide in me and my word abides in you amen what is the word of God Amen it's God himself amen what is the word of God the word is the very the thought is the very thought of God Amen the word of God that God was giving to Moses amen when people said that Moses don't talk anymore let you let God talk to you and you talk to us amen what was Moses transmitting telling the people the thought of [Music] godes was telling them the word of God so whatever Moses was saying it was the thought of God of their time amen and we say that we do believe in the message amen God sent us a prophet amen the prophet came with the word of God the word of God for our time amen and what is that word that word is the thought of God Amen so the message amen is the thought of God for our time it's the very thought of God what God was thinking amen now we have it in the books so notice that the Bible saying that in the beginning was the word and that word did not stop in word form that word was made flesh amen was made flesh amen and it became a human person what became a human person it was that same word amen so we have the word of God today and that word will not stop in written form that word has to become flesh amen that word has to start walking amen that word has to start speaking amen that word has to start touching people have to start touching that word amen and you are that word amen you are that word made you are the walking a you are the word of God you are the thought of God Amen so start walking amen and people will be weakness that we we' seen the word amen we've heard the word we touched the word Fellowship the word amen because they fellowship with you because you have the word of God Amen the word has no other feet that by your feet amen the word has no other Arms by my arm the word has no other mouth by my mouth God wants to speak to you amen he will have to use me to speak to you if God wants you to pray for your brother God will use you to go pray for your brother hallelujah amen let's go to First John chapter first John chapter [Music] one amen let's see what is that word first John chapter one amen here's John talking because notice that we sang that song the song leader sang that Jehovah of the old test of Amen first John chapter 1 amen the Bible say says that that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life amen look which was from the beginning what was from the what was in the beginning the word was in the beginning John John one it that in the beginning was the word the word was with God and that word was God amen so here they said that that which we that that which was from the beginning what was from the beginning it was that word amen which we have heard what have we heard amen we've heard that word amen which we have seen with our eyes amen what have we seen amen we've seen that word manifest to be manifest amen it means that to become obvious become obvious to the human eye amen you can't see the word amen but here said that that's same thing that was from the beginning it's the same thing that we've heard and it's the same thing that we have seen with our so what have we seen with our amen we've seen the word amen but the word is something spiritual but the Bible says in John 1 verse 14 that word was made man was made flesh was manifested that that word became obvious to the human ey that's why we were able to see it amen we we have looked upon it in our hands our hands have handled of That Word of Life we have heard that word amen we have seen that word amen our hands have touched that word amen because verse two he said that for that life for the life that was manifested and I mean I mean for the life for the life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us amen John is saying that we bearing witness of that we giving you this so that you can fellowship with that was it was that same word that was in the beginning amen that same word that we have seen amen and what was that amen that was that eternal life that was with the father amen was that eternal life that was with the father amen now is manifested unto us amen that same Elohim the self-existing one amen the one that has no Beginning No End Amen now he's manifested amen and then he's giving us his word amen he's giving us his word amen and that word needs to have the flesh that word needs to be made flesh again amen and that word was not only made flesh with brother Brandon that word made flesh did not stop only 196 amen that word has to be made because Paul say I'm calling you walk in epist that you are the walking epist amen what what is an epist it's the word amen you are a walking so you are that word made so if the prophet amen with the word of God inside of him amen was able to create things was able to pray for people he was able to speak the word and God the Bible said the prophet himself says amen that Jesus God is Not Strong in one side and weak in the other if you have the little Shadow Of God inside of you you have all power of God in so meaning that you have that power to speak the word amen for your situation will be change amen you have the power to speak the word but you have to have faith in God Amen in closing I want to read this it's coming from then Jesus came and called amen the prophet says that when a Believer and God gets turning together the prophet say that when when the believer and God gets turning together it generates the power of of his resurrection when believer takes his word in their heart and begin to generate it he brings for faith if you've been asking yourself how can I have faith amen here's an answer for you take the word of God in your heart and begin to gener automatically bring Fai amen because faith comes by the word of God Amen that's how you get Faith by reading and hearing the word ofen he say that because he has promised it so everything is in the line is in line the only thing you have to do to get electricity amen is to push the button amen that's all you have to do amen that's that's all you have to do when this scripture is supposed to be fulfilled now just press the button Don't Be Afraid electricity is already here Amen to get light just press button amen it's that easy just press the Buton amen it says that I have everything is fulfilled amen and whatever you ask God In Prayer you will receive it when you need something just press that button the promises are already here amen you don't have to go look for another new promise amen the Bible has plenty of promises so to see in action just press the button just have faith amen because Paul said Faith mixed with the word of God Amen that's when you have the result amen he says that be when and he preach the word of God the word of God was preached to two different people one group had faith and the other one did not have faith the one that did not have faith they didn't see anything with that same word that was preaching but to the group that had faith that word became manifest so to see the manifestation of the word of God Amen you need to have faith amen you need to mix your faith with the word amen he was wounded for my transg amen it's by his stripes that I am here you need to have faith in that you need to believe in that amen that's when you will have the healing you need to mix your faith with so who when you go through trials amen you going through something when you need God ask yourself this question who are you and the answer that you will give will give you the strength to so who are you I'm God's friend I'm God's elect I'm more than a conqueror I'm God's bride amen he loves me I am a king and I'm aest that's who I am I'm walking in power amen I'm living a miracle I live a life of favor because I know who I am amen I'm not just some young man amen I'm not just some child I'm not just some kid amen I am God's favorite I am God friend I am God's friend amen it doesn't matter how young you are doesn't matter how old you are amen the thing that matters the most is the relationship that you have with you know that at any time I can go to God and ask for something that God will
