[Music] foreign [Music] scriptures we're going to take our foreign [Music] foreign foreign and say to him those thy know that the Lord will take away the master from over their head today and he said I also know it be silent Elizabeth please stay here for the Lord has sent me to Jericho but it says as the Lord leaves and as yourself leave I will not leave you [Music] [Music] Elisha and said to him do you know that today the Lord will take away your master from over you and he answered yes I know keep quiet rest is then Elijah said to him please stay here for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan but he said as the Lord lead us and as yourself leave I will not leave you so the two of them went on sent out the prophet is the sons of the Prophet also went and stood at the sun this at some distance from them as they both were standing at the Jordan hello and wrote it up and struck the water struck the water and the water was supported to the one side and the other the other till the two of them could go over and dry ground every man educator can read your words if your spirit doesn't come to confirm those scriptures [Music] [Music] so that every of us can find a place in this world so the works of the Holy Spirit so we let we let the world trusting our soul unto your hands Christians amen amen you may be seated um [Music] and this morning I'm going trying to talk about the descending of the Jordans as we already started it I don't know if this is the fourth week already and with the help of the Holy Spirit I believe things are gonna go the way it's supposed to go [Music] hello comes available I promised that I was gonna talk about The Descent of Elijah and Elijah in the Jordan Israel you can project uh The Descent of the Jordan and say to him does that know that the Lord will take away that muscle from over their heads in the previous preaching I showed you that brother Brown says better means the house of the Lord House of God means the house of God means Church those who were in church said do you know they knew it is because there were people from church but he was not pleased by the same knowledge that those people had said chicken when they told him do you know that your master would say take away from you and he says I know it keep quiet Elisha needed a higher knowledge amen because they told him do you know people means they knew that Eli Elijah was gonna take it they knew that Elijah was gonna take Rapture and Elisha also knows Elisha was not just pleased to have the same knowledge as there was that's what it says I know it be quiet I will go with you till the end it is in Jericho verse five and the Bible says they were again the sons of the prophets and they say the very same thing do you know the Lord is taking away your master over your head today and the second Church Elisha is missing has no riches Elisha was not pleased with knowledge he needed something that's high he wanted to descend to the Jordan foreign [Music] [Music] in order for him to see they knew the word they stood from distance they came from the school what why it ain't just about to have knowledge no nature of the word yeah it's good we have to have we have to have a higher and that's Supreme shall only come when we cross the Jordans they don't want a cruise yeah in order for you to see Elijah being raptured women yes brothers and sisters and they both crossed the Jordan uh uh those people that knows if he's not he doesn't have knowledge he can leave the properties but I'm not showing this to show you how much I know I'm showing this because they can't help the church that's why I'm bringing it we can we get a lot of things to raise our people but if you have the sense of responsibility in you knowing what God has called you you will have that burden of helping people that's what makes us sustainable that's not what is in my mind and behind my mind I won each one after this service so we can reach that experience personally experience with God so we understand that God is not only the god of History is not just in the Bible and brushes and the same God that said the prophet of God in this day I think God shall can send a profit and just leave us being filled with the knowledge and nothing has power to uh I felt the uh to attack the enemy I don't think it's so now listen a a any any machine Elijah had worked with Elijah foreign [Music] well schools of knowledge but Elijah didn't take uh Elisha there is now every time they reach those places Elijah told him stay here just stay with this knowledge that you have a little help fulness he was not pleased with these two School knowledge foreign foreign with his family whenever he wants to work with that person that's why Elisha was following Elijah Elijah had a permission to separate Elisha from the world to separate him from the school of knowledge that was the mission of that was the mission of Elijah says who do you think there is disease in paragraph 52. God is a separate segregationists so I am so I am it is every question is what do we do together and he said every Christian is a separatist or segregation if you can project it is who do you say it is is a separate our woes and he says oh God separates his people from everything [Music] there always has been a subject of segregation see God chosen Israel he has done all the nations but it shows Israel as a nation for his own people [Music] a genuine Christian has to be a separate he's he's got to separate himself from the world and to accomplish one purpose that is Jesus Christ a genuine Christian is gone [Applause] always we separate he's a separatist he always separates from the word because God has his father always separates his people from the rest of the world so children were gone today is their God that we always separate from the things of the world to accomplish one purpose that is Christ Jesus so Christ Jesus is our purpose if we have a purpose in life It's gotta be Jesus Christ we cannot have another purpose if it's not Jesus Christ so let's ask our self a question everything we do in everything we do what's the goal we are we pursuing downstairs in this journey of life everything you're doing what's the purpose because Jesus Christ says to be our purpose he's got to be what we need what we seek the most there's got to be Jesus Christ so what are the Muslims behind this journey of life that you have foreign Jesus Christ is our only purpose no matter where I am no matter what I'm doing everything that I'm doing all that I wanna do I'm pursuing one purpose that's Jesus Christ so a Christian God separate from the things of the world and from everything to accomplish one purpose that's Jesus Christ why do we have so much problems today be a church or in her homes it's because we have people who do not accomplish the purpose of Christ that's
