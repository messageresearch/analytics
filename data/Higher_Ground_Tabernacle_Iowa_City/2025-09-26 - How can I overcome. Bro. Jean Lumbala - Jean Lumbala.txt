You are always available to receive us, Lord. We are so proud to have a Lord and a father like Jesus Christ. The God who doesn't betray. The God who loved us before the foundation of the world. If the lion can for can't forget about his children, you'll never forget about your children. Lord, you always think about us every time. Lord, you are always busy for our good sake. Lord, you fighting for us even if we don't see. In the darknesses, you fighting for us, Lord. In the light, you always fight for us. [Music] Our life today is a great testimony, Lord. Many people, even the devil himself, he doesn't understand why we still alive. Because the way he fought against us, he thought that he was going to finish us, Lord. Glory be unto you. Cuz when he came to fight against us, you raise your standard, Lord. May you continue and fight for us. &gt;&gt; Not for our our merit because we don't deserve it. Lord, &gt;&gt; that your grace may protect us. We came in this place just to pray. We got an appointment of coming in this place every Friday. We know that you are already in this place because we believe that your angels are your Holy Ghost is here with us Lord. We also believe that your anointing when I'll be speaking let it not be me Lord but it must be speaking to your children. What did what do I have to speak to your children? A little man like me. What can I tell your children? Beloved God, you don't use animals. You don't use things or trees, but you use because a man is a may use me in the name of the Lord Jesus so that I can transmit little things to your children that will help them to get better, Lord. counting on your grace in everything. Bless the time we're going to spend together. Be with us from the beginning to the end for your own glory and for in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; We saying amen. May the Lord richly bless you. I don't understand today. I'm so emotional since morning. I got some emotions. &gt;&gt; Okay, we going to read where we read last. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 26. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 2 verse 26. And he that overcomemeth and keep it keep kept my works unto the and to him I will give power over the nations. and also in in the book of Revelation chapter 3 verse 12. No, him that overcomemeth, I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he sh and he shall go no more out, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and I will write upon him my new name. Add a blessing to the reading of this word. We may be not going to be long tonight, but we talk about the same subject we spoke last Friday about how to overcome Because we see that in the Bible there's many blessings but the blessings of God they are for those who overcome. If we talk about overcomers before talking about overcomers or victories, we are obligated to talk about the fight if you don't talk about the battle. How how we going to have victory? If you are victorious, which means you overcome the fight, you won the fight, you won the battle, you won something, then you are vic victorious. Uh the fight that we're talking about, it's a spiritual battle. It's not a carnal battle. Muslim people don't understand it. Their prophet didn't understand it that they fight that the battle the spiritual battle they never understand. That's why they train militaries people who are bombing others. They thought they're going to kill Satan with bombs. But if he was spiritual enough, he would understand that it's the devil who's using him to bomb out. But he think he's doing the holy fire. That's not a holy battle. That's the curse battle. It's not a good battle. We don't attack people. We don't fight people. We're not fighting against the flesh, but we are fighting against spirits. So to fight against those spirit, you ought to have those spiritual weapons to get where demons are. You should know what kind of weapon to use. Demons are spirit. Even angels, they also spirit. The devil himself is a spirit. God also is a spirit. So if you want to fight demons, &gt;&gt; we should use spiritual weapons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So spiritual weapons, we've seen them last Friday that God gave us two weapons &gt;&gt; that never fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God gave us an example of the weakness because he himself have used one of those weapons and he became victorious at the end. He used the word of God and also the prayer. &gt;&gt; So when the devil came with the It it has been written. The Lord responded to him. It's also written. And the Lord went won the battle with the word of God. So when the devil came to take his life away, the Lord won the battle by praying. He prayed day and night. He fasted. He prayed, &gt;&gt; he fasted and he prayed. &gt;&gt; So at the end he came out victorious. &gt;&gt; So how can I overcome? So you should know how to fight or fight according to the rules. How should how would I overcome? You should overcome. by imitating the person who have overcome so far. We've given an example last time. Like when they are they giving us a test of math, our knows how to get to the right answer, but it doesn't show you that thing. He's hiding it. Why is he hiding the way to get to the answer? Because he want you to fail. He want to be the first, but he want you to be the last. But at the end of every you will see that the person who knows all the formulas of math is the one who's asking you $100. The one who knows all the math, all the formulas, everything. He thought in his mind that he was more than you. But in a practical life is now seeing you above everything. That's the uh that that's the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; It doesn't depend to the person who want or neither to the person who want neither to the person who intelligent but all depends to God who does mercy to whoever he want to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we've got the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He overcome the devil. And he didn't hide from us the formula to get a victory. He show unto us the formula to get to show us that he's a good friend. He never hide it from us. He's like Peter, you know, Peter, he he wanted to fish. He went fishing the whole night and he got nothing. But one day he met the Lord and the Lord asked him. Just put back the net in the water where you were fishing the last night. He said, "No, no, Lord. I know this place. I've been fishing the whole night and you know it's at night that we're getting more fishes. fishes are getting caught at night. He said, "It's not all all about us, but just listen to my voice. Put back your net in the waters." So Peter understood. He said, "For me, I couldn't do it for your for for your word. I'll put my net back in waters." So when he put his net in waters &gt;&gt; and the the net were sinking on the same place just because he trusted the word of God and he found more blessing that he have been seeking there all night. So when he got blessings, the first thing he have done, he knew that other people were in trouble. So he start calling his friends. Oh, Andrew, come over. Then he start calling other people through his blessings. That's that's the personal blessing. That's what the Lord have done. He didn't hide from us the formula to get to victory. show to us. If you want to win, if you want to overcome, this is what you have to do. But there are many people when they are blessed, they're hiding the formula to get they hiding the way to get you see as we got in this place. &gt;&gt; If God just bless one person, He has already blessed all of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has already blessed all of us &gt;&gt; because God, he will ever come down and start giving us connection of work, the business connections and stuff. But God is going to use brother John. He said, "Listen, in what I'm doing, I'm already blessed. See how you're going to get blessed as well. So, he's calling someone else and that person call another one as well until everybody's blessed. That's how God is doing his things. So, a man is an action of God. So, we here to complete each other. We here because we are the family. And because we are a family, we should think about what is happening on the other side. You see, you know how it's happening in the family in a in a good family. So I I'm eating well. I've got no problem. There's food every time on my table. But I want to know my little sister. Did she eat as well? &gt;&gt; So I'm worried about her but the work God is doing with 10 children. Are they going to do it well? So why do I do I want to know about it? My children are for why am I worried about them? my cousins, my my my uncles, children, and a lot of people. &gt;&gt; That's a that's a a blood affair. And the blood that unite us today is the blood of the lamb himself stronger than the blood of our families. I'm assuring you the blood of the lamb. The blood that have saved us is not any other blood. We should be worried about what is happening to other brothers. If the brother is moving forward or not, they inform me about something. I was so happy about it. And I believe it's a testimony I will give. There's a the sisters in Johannesburg. We talk about good things. every time. Oh, sisters are doing this and that. When sisters are doing good things, we should talk about it. Good testimony. Cuz if you talk about the wrong things, you are the mockery. Your place is not here. If there's something good to talk about, we should encourage it. Sisters in Johannesburg is not like here. There's many churches in Johannesburg there and there. &gt;&gt; So once she was inspired, &gt;&gt; she created a group, a WhatsApp group, she connected all the sisters in those who are interested. So we are in this country as foreigners. So we we we we notice that when we got problems And we we are on our own instead of waiting for the the government service doesn't even allow us. We don't haveh insurance. We should do something. We will start putting money. If there's someone who's in trouble, or maybe a sister's in trouble with children. We're going to support her. And I'm assuring you the report about that sister. Uh there's a little young brother of mine who died in Jerusalem. So sisters put their money together about 50,000 ring and it's not easy. is those sisters who are selling their husband are doing security stuff. So I understood that it's just a question of willing. So they gave to that of my young brother around 50,000 rand. Then I said let God bless sisters in China. [Music] sister from Jonasburg. May God bless you one day. If you if you come to this video, we praying for you and we encouraging you. Let other sisters behed by the same spirit. Let it go around. It's a good thing that you've done. May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we also said We should know the techniques of our enemy, the techniques of our enemy. If we don't know them, he's going to overcome on us. So how do we know his techniques is by searching in ourselves is searching in ourselves is by doing the inventory to know from where he's attacking us. is by doing the know where we are strong and where we are weak. You should know it where you are strong or where you are weak. So if you know that you are tempted by the act and you always around the nightclub you you go to nightclubs just take a If you know that you are with someone, you should start by running from nightmares because you know already yourself. Another philosopher. Okay. Okay. You should know yourself. You ought to know yourself. You ought to know how how you working the devil's techniques. Do you know how that is? &gt;&gt; He will just show you the sickness of I mean the the sin of other people. That other person is wrong. The other one is wrong. You see the other one on the other side is wrong. is showing you that other people yourself you are full of all demons but you don't see it you only see the mistakes of Christ but Jesus said unto the person you are hypocrite just remove the piece of wood in your eyes you to remove the the piece of wood in the eye of so if you know that you are not in order You should start by fixing them. That's how we start the victory. So you start your victory by recognizing your own mistakes. That's where you start. You start looking at yourself before looking at others because the word of God is a mirror that God has placed before each one of us. And that mirror has to show you your own mistakes. When you look in the mirror, you see yourself in your comparison to the word of God. Am I agreeing with the word of God before you see other people's mistakes? So you should see your own mistakes. So victory starts from there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we going to add on something else &gt;&gt; about the uh the battlefield. I believe I believe we've already started that just in few minutes we'll be done. the front line or the the the the battle line. &gt;&gt; So the devil is attacking from two uh two two front line. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The first battle line of the devil, &gt;&gt; it's your own, your eye, &gt;&gt; your free moral agency. So your free moral agency is the spirit that you receive from your birth is the world spirit. And I'm telling you that is the best spirit that you getting in this world when we when we born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's your eye, your free agency. &gt;&gt; And that free agency is based upon uh uh uh selfishness. It's it's on your selfishness. Everything which is good, &gt;&gt; you want it to be yours. Everything that is good upon the earth, you want it to be yours. Everyone should do your own. &gt;&gt; Now listen to the prayer. &gt;&gt; Our heaven, our heavenly father. May your name be glorified. May your will be done on the earth as it done in heaven. So the will of God which is done in heaven should be done also on your flesh. Why Jesus has said that to us? &gt;&gt; Because Jesus knew &gt;&gt; the earth and and and heaven They are they in opposition &gt;&gt; but he want this &gt;&gt; but he want the will that is done in heaven should be done upon the earth because on the earth there's opposition Paul said the good that I want to do I don't get to do it &gt;&gt; but the evil that I don't want to is attached to my flesh. So we are living in a permanent fight &gt;&gt; and we should win that battle &gt;&gt; because in this spiritual fight. There's no win-win. You know in soccer or in football they will say no it's a win-win. In this fight there's no win-win. Either you are overcomer or you are a loser cuz your enemy comes to kill and to slay. That's what the devil is coming to do. &gt;&gt; So you should kill your enemy and you should slay your enemy. If you don't kill your enemy, he's the one who's going to kill you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So your free agency is our great enemy. your I or your free moral agency is your first husband is the one we under his power when we are born we are we are under his control everything that we want is for our ego even when I come to preach if I don't preach for Jesus you know am I preaching for who I'm preaching for myself if it's not for Jesus that I'm preaching which means I'll be preaching for myself so that I can show to people that I'm a great I'm a Dr. John the best preacher in that's the ego that has to be tonight because God has to find his portion in everything that we do. God has to be glorified in everything that we do. When you go to work, yes, you're going to work. Has God found his account in your work? &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm bringing up my children. Does God find his portion in everything that you do? &gt;&gt; I bought a new car. Does God? Does God find his glory in everything that you do? Or I bought my clothes. Does God has his portion? or you just want to dress up and show that you are the one who knows how to dress up. So that is based upon your ego that is to die. When we dress up, we dress up for the Lord. When we buy our cars, our cars are for the Lord. When we buy our homes and our home are for the Lord and the purpose why we are in this world is to glorify our Lord. So glorify him in our life to glorify our Lord in our work to glorify him in our home to glorify him everything in our in our marriage in everything that we are. We dare to glorify the Lord. We don't want to we don't want to take the glory of our Lord. &gt;&gt; We want his glory to be unto him. So when you you leave for yourself, for your own eye, for your own ego, for for your own glory that you live, it means you're going to die for your own sake. And when you die for your own sake, who's going to raise you up? Who's going to bring you back to life? Because you live for yourself. Everything that you've done, you've done it for your own sake, for your own glory. So that people may know that it's only you. And at the end when you die, you'll never come back to life. &gt;&gt; You will die forever. &gt;&gt; Uh Job one day. He was in trouble when he noticed something. He said, "Oh, &gt;&gt; the tree when it dies, &gt;&gt; it comes back to life. &gt;&gt; But when a man dies, &gt;&gt; he dies for good. &gt;&gt; Then he saw the resurrection until he said, "My redeemer lives." He saw the resurrection. The person who who's going to resurrect it &gt;&gt; is the person who lives for God. &gt;&gt; So if you live for God, then God will bring you back to life. And whoever live for God is the person who killed his ego. So when we saying that we're victorious, it means we have killed our ego. We have killed our first husband. There's no way we can be married to boss. If our first husband is still alive, our our master knows the word of God. &gt;&gt; He want to check out. Oh Naomi, you came with Ruth, right? So where is her husband? Her husband died. When I found out, want to find out if really the the husband of Ruth is is dead. If we confirm that he's dead, then Boas can get married to us. So Boas can can't get married to a person who's still alive, who still having his own ego. So what is happen when you win the war? &gt;&gt; To win the battle is to kill your own ego. So once you kill your own ego, &gt;&gt; what is coming automatically after is the new birth is a new spirit that comes to you. The trees can be dead and the tree can come back to life because the tree doesn't live for itself. But do you know that right? The Lord God never live for himself. That's why he couldn't die forever. He should raise up. He was using his power for others. He was killing sick people. So when they came to kill him, he had all the powers. He never used that power for himself. Then God saw that from heaven. He said, "I will enter myself. I'll come down myself in the fall." Then he rose my the Lord from death. Trees can die and come back to life because trees don't live for themselves. Uh the mango tree, they don't eat their own mangoes. It's other people that comes and eat the mangoes. So the mango tree lives for others for the entire life. It doesn't need to complain about it its own mangoes. It problem is just produce more mangoes and other people are coming to eat from it. So a person who lived like that and got right to resurrection because the universal uh goodness is to live for others and the only way to live in that way is when you get to the point of killing your own ego. So your ego should die. There's only one way to get to eternal life and that way is the death in yourself. The first husband should die. The first husband that we received when we came in this world, he has to die. So once that husband died, then we can get a new husband. The new husband which is the Lord Jesus Christ, he can come and rule on us. because he's the one who win your soul who's going to rule on you. If it's your ego that win your soul, then you are controlled by your own will. But if it's the Lord Jesus that own your soul, he is the one who's controlling your soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we ought to understand that that's the way to eternal life. So we ought to overcome this fight. And it's possible to win the battle because they've already shows us the process to win the battle. We ought to fight by faith. And Paul taught us. Let us fight a good fight by keeping our faith and good conscience that others have lost. But we didn't lose our faith. And we didn't lose our conscience. We continuing to believe in victory. We also continuing to believe in the victorious God. We continue to believe in a overcome promises and we believe that everything that you say it will come to happen because he said as I overcome you as well you should overcome. It's him who promised to us the victory and he has already given to us because we're not fighting by ourselves. But we fighting with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's also external enemies. So the external enemies that the weakest ones they are weak if you've already warn the enemies the insiders &gt;&gt; oh let's say brother John if I want to come to your place while you're sleeping &gt;&gt; and I want to get something from your home I want to sneak Get your baby card. Thank God. I will never know it because I'm from outside to start. It will be hard for me to get into your house. I will have trouble to get into your house. Just because I'm from an outsider, [Music] but if I've got someone inside your home who lives with you, who knows when you are sleeping, Who knows when you are weak? &gt;&gt; Then tell me to come over because you're sleeping. If that person tell me everything, then I've got a possibility to come and do wrong because I've got someone from inside who's in connection with me. That's the ego, the eye that is which is in connection with us who's inviting them to attack us. So external enemies, they are weak. They are witches. They magicians. You should know something. You know the devil has also his own government. He has his own government. Devil has his government. Brother taught us that everywhere you go in every city, every city has its own demons, has its own spirit. That's what us. So the devil is organized that way. He has also its own meetings. By example, you will find in the spiritual world, you see in this area, they told me about I don't know if I'm I'm I'm saying it according to the to the court from the prophet you found somebody I don't know a magicians or avenue for this for this avenue. No girl. So they do meetings like that and you don't know about it and me also I don't know about while we are sleeping they organizing a meeting and they saying in this avenue church nobody will get married. We only notice that girls don't get married in on our avenue. is only an old woman don't get married on this avenue because we decided they decided in their word but I'm following you those people are so weak if we have already overcome our ego the ego which is always attached knows our weaknesses if we overcome our ego outside the enemies are so weak. We should overcome them every time. They may come at night or daylight because it's not even us that are fighting. It's our Lord who's fighting. outside enemies are weak and the Lord has already overcome them for us because the victory is in the blood. The victory is in the blood and the one who got the victory. He never hide from us the formula. He never hide from us because his life was not in the ego. He lived for others. Even when he got a victory, he went above and he shares his victory with us. But I'm telling you, each one of us is able to get the victory and to keep our victory on because winning is one thing &gt;&gt; and keeping the victory is another part. You know, every time you win a battle, when the devil leaves, that's what the Bible says. He will come back and see what has happened in your home. If the house is clean and protected, he will never come back. But if he found a struggle in your home, he will call other demons to come and fight against you. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says the condition of that person who become more worse than the first condition. But we believe &gt;&gt; that we got bit we got victory because we are the children of victory. We will overcome the devil in we will overcome in overcome. There's no way that the the devil can win upon us because the victorious has shared his victory with us and the victory is our promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The victory is our promise. But there something that I want to add on before I close. Everything that happened to us on our way on It's not always the devil attack. &gt;&gt; That's why we need to do the the inventory. When something happened to you on your way or an opposition or a fight, the good thing, you should check first. &gt;&gt; Whom did you offended? Did you offend somebody? Then you check. I got no problem with with brothers. I got no problem with someone. So you look into the word of God. Where did I step on the word of God? You check that. You found that you never offended the word of God. So once you say, you should understand that that's a test from your God. Because the Lord is training us in a fight. It's in the in the fight that we are we train. The trials are are so precious for us. It's more than gold because after all, for us to become overcomers, we should fight first. Uh it's like the the prophet is explaining it to the eagles of God. When eagles have got his own on little ones, he blesses the soft things in the nest. He plac the soft things in the nest to protect his little ones. As long as those little ones are growing up, he start removing the soft stuff in the nest. He start removing them. At a certain point, the knees to become substantial and they start having some spike. What is that? What's the ego trying to get? He want those little ones to fly. Because the ego is not meant to stay in the midst. He's not meant to live anywhere. The eagle has to fly up. But if he's comfortable where he's sleeping, there's no way that he can fly. That's why. So God is is starting to remove the comfort so that you can be in trouble. But it's not for you to die. But every time that you fly on when you want to fall down, the mother is always around to to protect you so that your feet doesn't hit against you. That's what our master is doing. We got our promise. It's called victory. The promise that God gave unto us, it's called victory. Either the enemy is eternal or is external. Our promise is to overcome on him. Amen. Amen. May the Lord bless his word. Amen. once more. Thank you for coming. [Music] &gt;&gt; We also thank the Lord for the word of God and thank you for your presence. [Music] [Music] only son. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory, glory, glory. [Music] Glory. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us pray each one of us. &gt;&gt; We may ask from God the victory. May each one of us ask victory from God. uh which is ours and our rights because the Lord say that everything that you're going to ask in the prayer just believe that you will receive it may God give victory to each one of us we all going to [Music] We going to pray again. Uh we're going to pray for our brother sister. sister. &gt;&gt; She has been diagnos with the cancer. [Music] And nothing can withstand to a person who've got faith. I believe that if we came in these places because we've got faith since we've got all have faith. Let us make a faith prayer. against this demon is an external demon. &gt;&gt; Let us cast this demon out in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And uh in this time if there's somebody with a request on his heart, &gt;&gt; you may just raise your hand. Amen.
