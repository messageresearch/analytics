[21:02] on Friday meeting.
[21:05] Have you changed your schedule?
[21:13] &gt;&gt; It's good to come to the meeting. It's

[21:19] testimony.

[21:37] &gt;&gt; Do you remember about that?
[21:47] &gt;&gt; He heard uh
[21:50] this was
[21:56] So it was so painful.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; So when he went to hospital,
[22:04] &gt;&gt; so they were suspecting of him having a
[22:06] cancer.
[22:09] So before I come to the church,
[22:12] he himself called me
[22:15] to tell me that he's here
[22:20] and I believe that is our God who have
[22:22] healed him
[22:24] because we prayed with faith.
[22:27] We glorify our Lord for the healing of
[22:29] our young brother. Amen.

[26:48] What we have just done is already a
[26:50] prayer.
[26:52] And that's what we believe.
[26:55] We believe that it's only you who can
[26:57] give us eternal life.
[26:59] It's only you can set us free from sin
[27:03] and only you that can heal us.
[27:08] Thank you for the healing that you've
[27:10] granted to my brother Jonas.
[27:14] We were waiting that you give us more
[27:17] testimony.
[27:20] A living God, it's you Lord Jesus
[27:22] Christ.
[27:24] God who heals, it's you, the Lord Jesus
[27:25] Christ.
[27:27] God who bless and

[27:52] need any demons in the way can never
[27:53] stop us. We've already put our hands on
[27:56] the shoulder and will never look back.
[28:00] We shall follow you until
[28:03] we thank you for the presence in this
[28:04] place. We thank you for your children
[28:07] that came in this place.
[28:09] They came to listen from you, Lord.
[28:12] May you accept oh God to speak to us.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; You don't use object Lord.
[28:20] You don't use animals but you are using
[28:24] human beings may use me by your grace to
[28:26] speak to your people
[28:29] before we get to prayer.
[28:31] You may give us your anointing
[28:34] before we get to prayer.
[28:36] May you raise us in the heavenly places
[28:38] in Jesus Christ and we may be with you
[28:41] face to face Lord the creator of heaven
[28:43] and earth. Be present in our midst Lord
[28:46] to bless all your children
[28:51] especially pay back 100 whoever left
[28:54] everything to come into your presence
[28:56] Lord. May you fulfill your pro your
[28:59] promises
[29:01] but you always remember about your
[29:02] promises that you've given to your
[29:04] children. May you be present among us
[29:06] Lord to bless us and to protect us and
[29:08] let all the glory the honor and majesty
[29:12] be unto you Lord Jesus our Lord and our
[29:16] God. with casting out all the evil
[29:18] spirit that may be among us Lord and let
[29:21] only the Holy Ghost of the Lord may be
[29:24] welcome in this place to lead us in
[29:28] everything that we shall do for the
[29:30] glory of the father and our children
[29:33] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[29:35] have so prayed amen
[29:41] the Lord richly bless you
[29:44] we may stand up on our feet to read in
[29:47] two places in the Bible.
[29:51] It seems like you are so tired
[29:56] and I believe you're coming from your
[29:57] work which is fine. But let us give our
[30:01] time to the Lord.
[30:06] It's not going to be long.
[30:12] We're going to to read in the book of
[30:15] second Philippine or in the book of
[30:17] Philippian chapter 2.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; Second chapter of Philippine verse 3.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; We're going to read in the name of the
[30:32] Lord.
[30:50] Let nothing be be done through uh strife
[30:54] or vain glory, but in loneliness
[30:58] of mind, let each uh let each estim
[31:03] other better than themselves. Look not
[31:06] every man on his own things, but every
[31:09] man also on the things of others.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; You can also read in the book of Psalm
[31:22] 115
[31:32] verse 15.
[31:37] Psalm 105
[31:40] verse 15.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Touch not my unwined and do and do my
[31:55] prophet no harm.
[32:01] May the Lord add great blessings to the
[32:03] reading of his word.
[32:05] We may be seated.
[32:09] We're going to spend a wonderful time
[32:11] before the Lord before we pray.
[32:19] So from those two scriptures we just
[32:21] read
[32:26] and our title our subject will be
[32:29] respect.
[32:34] And respect is a preaching from our our
[32:38] prophet William Roden.
[32:42] That's why I love him so much. And I
[32:45] believe you also love him. May God bless
[32:48] you. You that love the prophet.
[32:54] May the Lord bless you.
[33:01] So the respect is a preaching from the
[33:05] prophet.
[33:06] He did better than me
[33:10] because is is the prophet the mouth of
[33:13] God for our generation. And I believe we
[33:15] believe that.
[33:17] May God bless everyone who believes that
[33:19] way.
[33:24] We love the prophet because he's telling
[33:25] us everything.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; He's telling us about even respect.
[33:36] And I will tell you that you will go to
[33:37] many churches.
[33:42] It should be hard for you to find a
[33:44] preacher
[33:46] who's taking a subject as a respect
[33:51] and all of that. But we only found it in
[33:53] the message
[33:55] in the mess of the arrow
[33:59] and
[34:02] the sufficient source. everything that
[34:04] we need,
[34:07] everything that God thought in his mind.
[34:11] All the powers against leadership,
[34:16] everything that God could give us to
[34:18] overcome.
[34:21] He has done it in the midst of the end
[34:23] time
[34:24] by his prophet William Brham.
[34:30] That's why I really don't understand
[34:34] When you see someone who's in the
[34:36] message
[34:38] and is not satisfied,
[34:41] I don't know how it's happening to you.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; If the message doesn't make you happy,
[34:48] &gt;&gt; what's going to make you happy?
[34:51] I never understand that.
[34:56] Everything that men need to leave,
[35:00] &gt;&gt; everything that you need for your
[35:02] rapture,
[35:04] Everything that a men need to overcome
[35:06] in this world.
[35:09] We got all of that in the mess of the
[35:11] end time
[35:14] in the field of BS.
[35:18] Everything that we want to eat,
[35:22] everything that you want to drink,
[35:24] it's all in the message of the end time.
[35:28] And we will never go seek for them
[35:29] outside of the word. giving money,
[35:31] blessings, healings, everything that you
[35:34] can imagine.
[35:36] We do have all of that in a message.
[35:40] And you will find a preacher.
[35:42] You said, "No, I left the message. No, I
[35:45] went to another pastoralist.
[35:53] It means that that preacher never
[35:55] believed
[35:57] &gt;&gt; and he has never been one of ours.
[36:00] Because I believe that the message is
[36:04] the word of God
[36:06] and the word of God it's a net
[36:11] when they they plunge a net
[36:15] and the one who plunge the net in waters
[36:19] is looking for fishes but curiously
[36:23] there's also frogs and other stuff in
[36:26] the net.
[36:27] There are all all other kinds of
[36:30] reptiles. We're not going to eat those
[36:32] reptiles
[36:34] because God doesn't need them.
[36:37] There will be there will be a
[36:40] a a separation. God is going to separate
[36:43] things.
[36:46] He's going to separate things before we
[36:48] get to the end.
[36:50] Let those who are living the message,
[36:52] let them go.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Let them go if they want to go.
[36:57] and let them leave us with our message
[37:00] because we live this message and we
[37:02] cherish it
[37:04] &gt;&gt; and we want to be the believers of the
[37:06] message until Jesus found us in the
[37:08] message.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; So we talking about respect.
[37:18] So when I was looking at
[37:23] the beginning I didn't understand that
[37:24] it's a great message respect I thought
[37:28] maybe just a little word respect
[37:32] but when I start digging down and
[37:34] examining
[37:38] and I found out respect is a great thing
[37:43] a great thing respect
[37:48] Because somebody who lack of respect
[37:51] &gt;&gt; is not a Christian.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; That one is not a Christian.
[37:59] A Christian is respectful.
[38:06] As Christian, we owe everybody.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; And that debt is respect.
[38:14] We ought to respect everybody.
[38:19] We ought to respect even those who don't
[38:21] don't don't deserve it.
[38:25] And what did the prophet say?
[38:29] Even the priest Catholic people
[38:32] with his garment
[38:35] we ought to respect him.
[38:39] Even pagan people don't those who don't
[38:41] believe the drunkard people
[38:46] we ought to respect them
[38:52] &gt;&gt; because if you respect them
[38:57] that's the way for you to win is all
[39:02] because Jesus loves
[39:06] and children of Jesus loves also
[39:08] sinners.
[39:12] so you love people who don't deserve
[39:13] your love.
[39:15] That's what Jesus have done on the
[39:17] cross.
[39:19] He has loved us when we couldn't be
[39:21] loved. That's what Jesus have done.
[39:25] So I wanted to understand what is
[39:27] respect
[39:30] and I I search on Google what's a
[39:32] respect.
[39:33] So there were many definitions. So I
[39:36] choose one of these definitions because
[39:38] it struck my mind.
[39:40] So listen to what I read as a definition
[39:43] of the respect
[39:46] &gt;&gt; is a moral feeling
[39:49] &gt;&gt; and social
[39:55] which
[39:59] which include
[40:01] recognizing the the value of a man.
[40:08] So the respect to bring you to recognize
[40:11] this person in front of me is more than
[40:13] me
[40:14] &gt;&gt; and you believe that's the son of God.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; That's a proof of uh consideration.
[40:29] It's a proof of tolerance and uh
[40:32] politeness.
[40:35] and honesty
[40:39] &gt;&gt; then I look to this uh definition
[40:42] then I said
[40:45] so if somebody doesn't is lack of
[40:47] respect
[40:49] which means is impolite
[40:54] it means
[40:57] it's a
[41:00] a pride a pride person
[41:04] A pride person
[41:07] when a pride comes here
[41:09] &gt;&gt; in our church
[41:12] in his mind in his bolderness.
[41:17] He think is more than everybody.
[41:21] In his mind he think is more intelligent
[41:23] than everybody.
[41:26] He think is so stronger than everybody.
[41:31] Or maybe she's beautiful than anybody.
[41:35] Let the devil make you believe that you
[41:37] are more than anybody
[41:42] because God has created us to
[41:45] complete each other. There's nobody who
[41:48] self-sufficient.
[41:50] What I know, you don't know it.
[41:54] And what you know, I don't know it as
[41:56] well.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; But if you are together,
[42:00] we can do something.
[42:04] We are to believe in the talent of
[42:06] somebody.
[42:08] I was listening to a to a a great man
[42:12] &gt;&gt; uh
[42:13] if you to know how to dress your self is
[42:17] to envy others.
[42:19] You ought to see something better from
[42:21] other people too.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; You got to value your pe your value your
[42:28] brothers. Amen. Amen.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; You got to value him and and and and
[42:37] believe that he's a son of God,
[42:39] &gt;&gt; you are to believe that he's a son of
[42:41] God.
[42:43] And just because he's a son of God,
[42:46] &gt;&gt; then he deserve respect.
[42:49] Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; We not an association of impolite
[42:56] people.
[42:58] We don't believe in impoliteness.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; We not also believing in a pride
[43:10] because we are nothing to stand.
[43:13] It's only the grace of God that sustain
[43:15] us and sustain.
[43:19] It's only the grace of God that gives us
[43:21] food. Only the grace of God that gives
[43:23] us.
[43:25] And it's only the grace of God that
[43:27] gives us marriage. It's a grace of God
[43:29] that gives us children. And it's a grace
[43:32] of God that gives us everything.
[43:35] So the one who overcome the wall,
[43:39] &gt;&gt; it's a humble man.
[43:43] He's a humble man. He's a little man.
[43:46] That's what Jesus said unto us.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Keep yourself humble.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Then you will be raised up.
[43:55] So the way to go up
[43:58] &gt;&gt; you got to go you got to humble
[44:00] yourself.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; You will see a victorious person
[44:05] by his way of humbling himself.
[44:09] If you humble yourself before the word
[44:10] of God.
[44:12] If you humble yourself before your your
[44:14] brothers
[44:16] where we just read what did they say?
[44:19] Let each one of us consider
[44:23] other person as more superior than us.
[44:27] That's how we have to walk if you want
[44:29] to please God.
[44:45] You'll never respect somebody that you
[44:46] don't love.
[44:48] And I also discover something
[44:51] that respect
[44:55] is not a failure.
[44:57] It's not a weakness.
[45:02] But respect is a power.
[45:06] Respect is a power.
[45:10] Every son of God has got the gift of
[45:13] respect.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; So he has to respect the children of
[45:18] God. He has to respect the word of God.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; He has to respect the gift that God give
[45:26] us.
[45:28] Do you believe that? Right.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; I'll give you my example.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; God has given me a car.
[45:39] I'm respecting that car, the car that
[45:41] God has given me.
[45:46] No prostitute can enter my car.
[45:53] My car
[45:56] will never take me to steal some money
[45:58] in the bank.
[46:01] If I do that, I'm respecting my car
[46:06] because it's God who have given me that
[46:07] car.
[46:09] When I'm respecting the car, then God
[46:11] will observe.
[46:14] He'll give me a bigger car than what I
[46:16] have.
[46:20] Because when you respect those little
[46:22] thing that God gives you, God going to
[46:24] raise you up and he will give you
[46:26] greater things.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:31] You got a house,
[46:34] &gt;&gt; you ought to respect that house.
[46:40] You got to make sure that the word of
[46:42] God is in that house and God is honored
[46:44] in that the house
[46:48] because it's not only your own house
[46:50] where you living
[46:52] as a son of great king. You got right
[46:58] go right to a god and angel has to come
[47:00] and guard you while you are sleeping.
[47:04] Why the enemy want to do harm you
[47:07] but his angels around you and those
[47:10] bodyguard around you but now those body
[47:13] gods
[47:14] are observing filthy around you. You got
[47:16] to respect your house.
[47:19] Let Jesus be number one in your house.
[47:23] Let angels be honored in your house.
[47:27] let the children of God be happy in that
[47:29] house.
[47:31] Be
[47:33] welcoming in your house. By doing that,
[47:36] you will welcome even angels.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, when you receive
[47:41] the children of God,
[47:44] they are greater than angels.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; So angels were lost in heaven.
[47:53] And God
[47:55] has never went to seek for them.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; God has never went looking for angels,
[48:02] those who were lost.
[48:05] Even when he came to die upon the cross,
[48:08] he never shed his blood for Lucifer.
[48:13] But Jesus shed his blood for his own
[48:15] children.
[48:16] And the children of God, it's you who
[48:19] believe that is the son of God is the
[48:21] children of God. May God bless you.
[48:24] Because you are a children of a great
[48:25] king
[48:28] above God is not any other power.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; And if you are a child of God,
[48:35] that's the highest position you could
[48:37] have.
[48:39] The highest position you could have is
[48:41] to be a child of God.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; So respect
[48:51] &gt;&gt; is a great thing.
[48:54] We ought to have this kind of respect
[48:57] among us.
[49:01] Many people don't understand what is
[49:03] respect. They don't understand it.
[49:08] A father
[49:10] has to respect his child.
[49:14] That's more important.
[49:17] And we believe only the little one has
[49:20] to be to respect the olders.
[49:23] The great one has to respect the little
[49:25] one.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; How can you respect our children
[49:32] is by leaving the word of God in front
[49:34] of our children?
[49:37] Because everything that we can do to our
[49:38] children,
[49:41] everything that we're going to say unto
[49:43] them, go to church on Sunday, you ought
[49:45] to pay your tithe and you ought to do
[49:48] this and that. Then the child is
[49:50] observing you.
[49:52] is taking what you're doing.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; How is my dad doing things? So the child
[50:00] is observing
[50:02] then the child will do the same.
[50:05] He will never do what you're saying.
[50:08] The child will do what you do
[50:11] because our actions
[50:13] they speak louder than our words.
[50:20] So by leaving the word of God in front
[50:21] of the children,
[50:23] &gt;&gt; we are respecting them.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; We are respecting our children when we
[50:31] leaving the word of God in front of them
[50:34] and the husband
[50:37] has to respect his h his wife
[50:42] because many people are claiming this
[50:44] woman doesn't respect me, this woman
[50:45] doesn't respect me.
[50:48] So, do you respect also your husband?
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Do you respect your wife?
[50:55] &gt;&gt; No, it's me who got married to her.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; But she's a daughter of God.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; She deserve your respect.
[51:08] So, how can you come?
[51:11] You've got things in your phone.
[51:14] Your your wife doesn't know about it.
[51:17] There's other calls that you're making
[51:19] when you go in a bathroom. That's where
[51:21] you make calls.
[51:24] Then you waiting for your for your for
[51:26] your wife to inspect you. You don't
[51:28] deserve it.
[51:30] You are a bad husband.
[51:35] If you got something like that,
[51:37] don't hide it.
[51:40] That's why God has put servant of God.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Believe in him.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Talk to him.
[51:47] Then we pray together.
[51:49] Then the Lord has given us that power to
[51:52] pray for each one another.
[51:54] I can tell you
[51:58] that many victory that I overcome is by
[52:01] the prayer of other people.
[52:05] So many prayers that I got,
[52:09] I got them by the prayers of other
[52:11] servant of God.
[52:13] Never hide your weaknesses.
[52:18] The devil is so strong when you hiding
[52:20] your your weaknesses.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; You never will forgive him
[52:26] because you hiding your weaknesses in
[52:27] front of the devil. The Bible says,
[52:31] &gt;&gt; the one who hid his weaknesses will
[52:34] never prosper.
[52:36] Amen.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; So see the servant of God,
[52:42] pray with them is very important.
[52:46] I've given my testimony here
[52:49] of how I've overcome this, how I
[52:52] overcome cigarettes and all the stuff.
[52:58] It was by a prayer of a servant of God.
[53:01] He prayed for me.
[53:03] I also pray for myself. But he prayed
[53:06] for me.
[53:09] Then I I kept that victory until today.
[53:12] Now that I'm telling you,
[53:15] If you are smoking in front of me,
[53:18] &gt;&gt; I feel like I have to throw out.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; I feel like throwing out.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; So, how did I win that victory?
[53:27] &gt;&gt; A servant of God helped me.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] We believe in a respect.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; We don't believe in a hypocrisy.
[53:43] You do like you respect him when you
[53:46] there.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, hi brother. May God bless you. Thank
[53:51] you for coming at our place.
[53:56] Oh, you can have some some juice.
[53:59] When he left,
[54:02] he's also married.
[54:04] But the way he's drinking juice is like
[54:06] he was hungry.
[54:09] We are in America, but he's suffering. I
[54:12] understand
[54:14] that's not respect.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; That's hypocrisy.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; He wasn't get along getting along with
[54:28] hypoc of his time.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; He was in trouble with Pharisees
[54:33] hypocrite.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "You hypocrite hypocrite.
[54:36] Hypocrite.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; See what you're doing to others.
[54:41] But you want others to take their burden
[54:43] on them
[54:46] while you are not even able to point
[54:48] your burden.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; So Jesus didn't love those Pharisees
[54:54] because Pharisees were hypocrite.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Bernham,
[55:01] listen to his uh declaration.
[55:06] I prefer to meet my God
[55:10] &gt;&gt; as a sinner
[55:13] not like a hypocrite
[55:17] &gt;&gt; because to be hypocrite is from devil.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; To be hypocrite is a devil.
[55:27] We believe in a respect
[55:31] but a respect based on honesty.
[55:35] Integrity,
[55:37] &gt;&gt; honesty, I mean uh respect based on
[55:39] honesty.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; What is integrity
[55:45] &gt;&gt; is to do good.
[55:47] When they see you,
[55:50] you do also good.
[55:52] Even when they don't see you inity,
[55:56] that's integrity.
[55:59] If there's somebody here, we are
[56:02] together, we singing and we know that
[56:04] he's our beloved ones,
[56:08] but he's living with other group in the
[56:10] darknesses. We don't know.
[56:13] Here's another name outside that we
[56:14] don't know. I'll tell you an
[56:19] I went in a in an office of my my
[56:22] cousin. My cousin was was working at a
[56:26] immigration
[56:28] and that day he didn't expect me to be
[56:30] in his office.
[56:33] So our our big brother
[56:35] at work he didn't have another name and
[56:38] I'm ashamed of that name.
[56:43] They were calling him a husband of
[56:45] prostitute.
[56:47] So when you see him at home,
[56:50] he's a good man, kind
[56:53] &gt;&gt; and you think he's more disciplined,
[56:56] it's is full of respect and they say
[56:59] young how is the university at school
[57:04] but in his office
[57:07] he was even dancing
[57:09] women were coming there.
[57:12] Women were taking money from his pocket
[57:14] and our husband
[57:18] And when I get to the office,
[57:21] &gt;&gt; he wasn't looking at me.
[57:25] Uh, at a moment when he turned around,
[57:28] he realized that I was already in the
[57:30] office.
[57:32] Oh, my little ones. Oh, you see this is
[57:35] work.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Never go tell your big sisters and
[57:39] stuff.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Don't bring things from the office home.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; So, what's your problem?
[57:48] So he understood that I've re uh
[57:51] recogniz him.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; So when you are a Christian daylight,
[57:59] you are to be a Christian even at night.
[58:03] If your name is brother John,
[58:06] so you ought to be brother John too,
[58:09] not with another name outside that we
[58:11] don't know
[58:13] in other places that we don't know.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; That's hypocrisy.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; And hypocrisy people,
[58:20] they've got no place in our kingdom.
[58:22] Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; We don't love God by hypocrisy.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; We don't respect children of God by
[58:32] hypocrisy.
[58:35] And we don't do it by hypocrisy.
[58:38] We are showing our face to people.
[58:42] We're not chameleons.
[58:45] Those who are changing their colors
[58:47] every time.
[58:49] That's how they
[59:00] Yeah.
[59:05] So when there were a meeting of B.
[59:09] So the B was going in that meeting.
[59:13] When there was a meeting of B,
[59:16] he was also going in the meeting of B.
[59:19] But when he was in trouble,
[59:22] everybody denied him.
[59:25] Bird sailed.
[59:27] He's flying. Yes.
[59:29] He comes to our meetings.
[59:34] But he doesn't have feathers.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; So they rejected him
[59:39] and the mouse came. They look at him.
[59:43] Yes, you've got like us. You've got
[59:47] feathers, but we don't fly. So he's not
[59:49] our brother.
[59:51] That's how he has been rejected by
[59:54] everybody. He got rotten
[59:57] because he wasn't showing his true
[59:59] colors.
[1:00:01] We are to show what we are.
[1:00:05] If you've got some troubles, some
[1:00:07] difficulties, it's happened to
[1:00:08] everybody. We can fix it in between. We
[1:00:12] pray, we cast out a demon. And we
[1:00:15] believe that
[1:00:17] by the power that the Lord has given us
[1:00:19] in,
[1:00:22] we got the power to cast out demons.
[1:00:27] What is evil is when you hiding the evil
[1:00:29] in you. When you hiding your your your
[1:00:33] evil, you're making him strong.
[1:00:36] But when you make him out,
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; he's weak.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; And we can cast him out
[1:00:43] and he's going to obey to the word of
[1:00:45] God. Amen.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:50] We are acting by honestly steelity
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; and we are respecting by integrity.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; We are the same person everywhere we go
[1:01:02] either night or day.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; We are still the same person. That's why
[1:01:07] we believe in this place.
[1:01:09] We believe in our respect.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Respect to the things of God.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Respect to our children. Respect.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Respect to the servant of God.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Respect to the word of God
[1:01:25] and respect to our Lord.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; If you are here
[1:01:32] and you believe that you are a son of
[1:01:35] God,
[1:01:38] you ought to respect the children of
[1:01:40] God.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; We don't criticize the children of God.
[1:01:48] We don't talk bad about those brothers
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; for they are children of God. We got to
[1:01:55] honor them
[1:02:01] and you think children of God is only
[1:02:03] those who are in Kinasa
[1:02:05] because you alone with them.
[1:02:08] If maybe they are living with you,
[1:02:11] you only watch them on the TV how they
[1:02:13] are saying. I love them. those who are
[1:02:16] in Kas and Chicago
[1:02:19] but children of God they are even in
[1:02:22] this place.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; But I believe that the one who seated
[1:02:30] next to you is a child of God
[1:02:34] and he deserve your respect.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; We ought to respect among ourselves.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; We ought to concede ourselves.
[1:02:46] We ought to value ourselves.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; If you love somebody
[1:02:52] if you respect somebody,
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; if you value somebody,
[1:02:59] you will never say all these mistakes.
[1:03:02] You know me.
[1:03:05] That's an example that I'm taking.
[1:03:09] Even if my mother was a witchcraft,
[1:03:14] I will never say my mom my mom is a
[1:03:17] witch.
[1:03:18] That word will never come out of my
[1:03:20] mouth.
[1:03:22] It will never come out of my mouth. Even
[1:03:24] if I knew that she was a witch.
[1:03:28] I will never say it. Why am I saying?
[1:03:31] Because I love her.
[1:03:33] Because I honor her.
[1:03:35] Because I respect her.
[1:03:40] The same witch.
[1:03:42] She took care of me
[1:03:45] when I was little. I didn't even know
[1:03:47] what's a witchcraft.
[1:03:50] She could even kill me when I was still
[1:03:51] young.
[1:03:53] She could even uh uh discourage me.
[1:03:57] But she gave me everything that is good.
[1:04:00] But today, even if I found out that
[1:04:02] she's a witch,
[1:04:04] I will continue to honor her.
[1:04:08] But if you know also
[1:04:11] that your brother is has got weaknesses
[1:04:13] somewhere, you got a you got a right to
[1:04:16] pray for him first.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; You respect him
[1:04:21] because
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; because you consider him.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; We're going to read something before we
[1:04:30] close.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; The advice of a prophet.
[1:04:38] We're going to read this to close
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; in the preaching respect of 196061
[1:04:56] from paragraph 47.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; So I'm asking you to pay more attention
[1:05:02] to this because it's more important.
[1:05:05] respect.
[1:05:09] That's why I understand that respect is
[1:05:11] a great thing. We ought to have that
[1:05:14] kind of respect.
[1:05:16] And a respect,
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; a true respect
[1:05:25] based upon honesty
[1:05:28] integrity,
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; based on integrity
[1:05:34] that we not waiting only for people to
[1:05:35] respect us,
[1:05:37] but we also respecting other people. But
[1:05:40] listen, pay attention to this.
[1:05:46] Paragraph 47 we're going to read.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; The conclusion of everything that has
[1:05:54] been said
[1:05:57] is to fear God.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; And you will never have respect if you
[1:06:07] don't fear God.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:13] You should have fear of God.
[1:06:17] Solomon in the proverbs he said.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Fear of God is a is a beginning of
[1:06:27] wisdom.
[1:06:31] Fear of God is a beginning of wisdom.
[1:06:37] It doesn't mean you are you you are
[1:06:39] afraid of him. No.
[1:06:45] But it means you giving him respect and
[1:06:47] reverence.
[1:06:51] So when you respect God,
[1:06:53] you are fearing God.
[1:06:58] You are fearing not to displease him in
[1:07:01] something.
[1:07:04] So you are afraid of doing something
[1:07:06] bad,
[1:07:08] things that you didn't want to do.
[1:07:11] 49
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; I fear my mother.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; I fear my wife.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; I fear my wife.
[1:07:37] We I know where we coming from.
[1:07:46] We know each other where we coming from
[1:07:49] and we know how we say things.
[1:07:52] There's also a big brother
[1:07:55] who lived in impoliteness.
[1:07:58] He want to play that with the children.
[1:08:01] My little boy come here.
[1:08:05] Never let a woman play with you because
[1:08:07] a woman is nothing.
[1:08:12] So our brother doesn't believe that way.
[1:08:16] He says I fear my wife.
[1:08:20] It doesn't mean I'm afraid of my wife
[1:08:22] but I just I respect her. That's what
[1:08:25] the prophet is saying.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; I fear my church.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Somebody who fear the church,
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; he's going to respect his church. He's
[1:08:40] going to talk good about his church.
[1:08:43] And when we talk about church,
[1:08:46] we talking about members of a church.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; You respect the church.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; You respect the children of God that are
[1:08:57] in the church.
[1:09:00] That is respect that we need.
[1:09:02] So we're going to pray tonight
[1:09:05] so that God can give us respect.
[1:09:10] God can fill us with respect.
[1:09:13] Respect for children of God.
[1:09:17] Respect for the things of God.
[1:09:20] Respect for the program of God. As you
[1:09:23] came in this place,
[1:09:26] so you support the program of God of the
[1:09:28] church.
[1:09:31] We've got a program of coming pray on
[1:09:34] Friday as you came.
[1:09:37] So you are respecting your church.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; May God bless you for respect.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; So I fear my church. Listen.
[1:09:53] I fear all the servant of God.
[1:10:00] Afraid of not stumbling them. Listen.
[1:10:07] I fear people.
[1:10:11] I fear people of this city.
[1:10:15] Even people that you meet at work, you
[1:10:18] ought to respect them
[1:10:22] because when you respect somebody,
[1:10:24] you love them
[1:10:27] and Jesus loves those sinners.
[1:10:31] Children of Jesus loves also sinners.
[1:10:35] So to respect people,
[1:10:40] that's the way to win their souls to the
[1:10:42] Lord.
[1:10:44] Something is coming.
[1:10:47] It's going to be long.
[1:10:50] Let's continue.
[1:10:57] So I fear people of this city
[1:11:01] in order not to stumble them.
[1:11:07] that they may think that I'm not a
[1:11:09] Christian. Amen.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; So when we are living,
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; we want everybody to believe that we are
[1:11:18] we are Christian.
[1:11:20] Listen my beloved ones.
[1:11:24] We should not say to people that we are
[1:11:26] Christian.
[1:11:28] People should see Christ in us.
[1:11:32] How are we going to leave?
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me say it because it's just
[1:11:38] there was a servant of God.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; God told him.
[1:11:44] You go in that city to preach a word of
[1:11:46] God.
[1:11:49] So
[1:11:51] he went to the city where God have sent
[1:11:52] him.
[1:11:54] He found somewhere to leave. He stayed
[1:11:57] there.
[1:11:59] He was just praying.
[1:12:01] He was saying to God,
[1:12:03] "Which day am I going to preach?
[1:12:06] When am I going to start preaching?"
[1:12:11] God said unto him, "Okay, just stay. I
[1:12:13] I'll give you a sign." He stayed there
[1:12:16] for one, two, three months.
[1:12:20] One morning when he woke up to pray,
[1:12:23] God show him in a in a dream,
[1:12:26] "Your your mission is done.
[1:12:29] You ought to go now.
[1:12:32] That's not impossible.
[1:12:35] You said that I was coming to preach in
[1:12:37] this city
[1:12:39] to preach, but you're telling me that my
[1:12:40] mission is done.
[1:12:42] You regret about it. He said, "Lord, you
[1:12:45] have sent me.
[1:12:47] I didn't hold.
[1:12:51] But I will submit myself to your will.
[1:12:54] May your will be done." Then he left.
[1:12:59] So God went to speak to another servant
[1:13:01] of God.
[1:13:04] You going to go in the same city.
[1:13:07] It's you that going to preach when he
[1:13:09] get there.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. The the the uh uh
[1:13:19] God loves sinners.
[1:13:21] God respect people.
[1:13:25] God doesn't want us to use or to take
[1:13:28] people's wives. We ought to respect the
[1:13:29] word of God.
[1:13:31] So God is love.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; God is full of respect.
[1:13:38] When he preached that way,
[1:13:40] people said, "No, that's not possible.
[1:13:43] So everything that you're saying is
[1:13:44] Jesus." Yeah, it's that's how Jesus is.
[1:13:48] [Music]
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; He said Jesus was here.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; He just left.
[1:13:54] We have seen Jesus.
[1:13:58] If it's that Jesus you're talking about
[1:14:00] just baptize us
[1:14:04] because we want to be like that person
[1:14:05] who was here
[1:14:09] that guy that person God have used him
[1:14:12] to preach the word of God
[1:14:15] by his way of living.
[1:14:18] That's what each one of us has to do
[1:14:22] to preach the word of God according to
[1:14:24] his life and
[1:14:29] your your life has got more impact than
[1:14:31] the word that you're saying in our
[1:14:33] mouth.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:36] Listen at paragraph 50. You see,
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; so before you get the respect,
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; you got to have fear of God.
[1:14:52] And God is requiring
[1:14:55] the fear of God.
[1:14:59] God is claiming respect.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Is claiming it.
[1:15:07] God is requiring respect
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; and the fear of God as well.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; We know that
[1:15:17] the fear of God brings respect.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:15:23] I'm going to skip because it's too long.
[1:15:28] Okay.
[1:15:31] Paragraph 53.
[1:15:33] Listen now.
[1:15:37] Because God is God.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; He deserves the respect. Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; We ought to respect God and have fear of
[1:15:53] him.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; And that's going to produce respect.
[1:15:59] So God has claimed that for himself
[1:16:03] and for ill for all his servant
[1:16:09] when we talking about servant of God.
[1:16:13] I believe I've already said it so many
[1:16:15] uh several times.
[1:16:18] The servant of God is not only the one
[1:16:20] who who's preaching.
[1:16:23] It's not only the preacher who is a
[1:16:25] servant of God
[1:16:30] because God has made us the kingdom of
[1:16:32] priest.
[1:16:36] There's a way of working for the Lord
[1:16:39] being seated down.
[1:16:42] If you leave the word of God at work,
[1:16:46] you are the servant of God even at work.
[1:16:50] So your life can bring somebody to the
[1:16:52] Lord. And when God
[1:16:55] when God is requiring respect for
[1:16:58] himself,
[1:17:01] he also claim respect for his servant.
[1:17:04] All his servant.
[1:17:08] So how do we know that they are servant
[1:17:10] of God?
[1:17:13] Because God is vandicating his servant
[1:17:16] by his by his word.
[1:17:19] He's taking those servant and make them
[1:17:21] the servant of God.
[1:17:23] is proving that they are the servant of
[1:17:25] God
[1:17:27] by fulfilling the word of God through
[1:17:29] them.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Now pay attention
[1:17:34] and when you respect those servant of
[1:17:35] God,
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; you are respecting God.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] And
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; when I respect you
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; and you respect me as well
[1:17:51] that we're respecting each other,
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; then we respecting God.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:01] So when you misrespect the children of
[1:18:04] God,
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; you will never say you're respecting
[1:18:06] God.
[1:18:09] How can you respect God who's far away
[1:18:11] but the person in front of you don't the
[1:18:14] son of God?
[1:18:16] You don't respect him. You don't like
[1:18:19] listen what Jesus said to close. He said
[1:18:22] to Peter,
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Simon, Peter,
[1:18:27] if you love me,
[1:18:29] feed my sheep.
[1:18:33] And if there's a sheep of Jesus in this
[1:18:36] world, it's us, the believers of the
[1:18:39] message.
[1:18:41] We should have respect for one another
[1:18:45] and we should give respect to our Lord.
[1:18:48] May God bless us.
[1:18:51] Amen.
[1:19:03] Just bear with me. I've got a
[1:19:06] another prayer request.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Uh this time is a big brother to sister
[1:19:19] Julie.
[1:19:23] He's also sick in Johannesburg.
[1:19:33] Uh we hear that he has been diagn
[1:19:35] diagnosed
[1:19:37] something in his body and we found that
[1:19:40] is a pandic.
[1:19:44] He may go through operation
[1:19:47] tonight.
[1:19:49] Maybe they are busy uh uh doing the
[1:19:51] surgery
[1:19:53] and we're going to pray for him.
[1:19:56] Let us remember him in the prayer.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; If there's also somebody
[1:20:03] who has a problem,
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; he's going to raise his hand,
[1:20:09] then we will pray for him.
[1:20:16] If there's somebody who has got
[1:20:17] something a fight,
[1:20:22] something that is fighting
[1:20:25] something to have victory.
[1:20:28] If he can come over here,
[1:20:33] we can call each other.
[1:20:37] Then we will pray for one another.
[1:20:40] That's what God requests from us. Pray
[1:20:43] for each other.

[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:24] May the Lord bless each one of us.
[1:35:30] We say thank you to the Lord for the
[1:35:32] respect that he gave us.
[1:35:36] And we're going to go in our houses
[1:35:38] believing that God has blessed us
[1:35:42] by giving us respect.
[1:35:48] Those who respect the word of God
[1:35:52] because we're respecting the word of
[1:35:53] God.
[1:35:58] And we're going to put something in the
[1:35:59] basket over there as an offering that we
[1:36:01] came with.
[1:36:03] That's what the word of God is telling
[1:36:04] us. Every time you gather in the house
[1:36:07] of the Lord,
[1:36:11] for your meeting to be complete,
[1:36:15] for your fellowship to be complete, you
[1:36:17] should do something, you should offer
[1:36:18] something to God. So let us start from
[1:36:21] there.
[1:36:22] Let us respect the word of God by giving
[1:36:27] the offering that we have.
[1:36:30] Then I'll be looking to the person who's
[1:36:32] going to go out or dying without giving
[1:36:34] his offering. May God bless you.
[1:36:38] So we're doing it by the love of our
[1:36:41] God.
[1:36:43] So let us go in the peace of the Lord.
