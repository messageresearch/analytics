[45:36] with remissions
[45:40] this word of today
[45:43] Lord we see your grace
[45:52] [Music]
[45:56] Lord I pray that you bless the service
[45:59] in a special way
[46:02] in your name Jesus Christ we pray
[46:06] amen amen you may be seated
[46:11] there's a lot of things that are on my
[46:13] heart this morning
[46:18] but I like to entitle this message God
[46:21] God's order of things
[46:25] God's order of things
[46:32] love that it shows that you
[46:35] we realize by the grace of God that uh
[46:39] we often get confused and nobody's life
[46:48] because we we don't know exactly what
[46:51] God is doing
[46:56] I believe this is why the word of God
[46:59] tells us to trust the Lord
[47:01] all of our hearts
[47:05] you don't understand
[47:10] in all
[47:18] foreign did you hear that last part of
[47:21] it
[47:22] acknowledge Him in all our ways
[47:26] to correct our path
[47:32] when we think about order
[47:37] we think about someone or some Authority
[47:44] command us or direct us or instruct us
[47:51] it's also when we think about order
[47:57] we can also think about an arrangement
[48:00] no performance
[48:02] or disposition of people or things in
[48:05] relation to each other who are in this
[48:08] position
[48:10] a lot this is why we have chairs in
[48:13] churches
[48:15] to maintain an order
[48:18] and we put these chairs in a particular
[48:22] position
[48:26] so that the the it won't look like a
[48:30] mass of confusion
[48:33] [Music]
[48:34] it is what we call order yes
[48:38] God is a god of order hello
[48:41] I remember when he created everything
[48:46] and he found that the Earth was void
[48:49] without shape
[48:52] God began to put it in order
[48:57] and everything that God put in order
[49:01] has remained in his order
[49:05] except for mankind
[49:08] except we are the ones that are out of
[49:11] order
[49:13] and everything that we see in a negative
[49:16] foreign
[49:30] but this is not Eternal
[49:33] not even the state is Everlasting it is
[49:39] because we know that God will place man
[49:42] back
[49:44] into his original order
[49:49] original we know by God's grace
[49:53] that we have come through I'm jumping a
[49:56] little bit
[49:57] we have come through what we call Seven
[50:00] Church ages
[50:04] and even at the end of that seven
[50:07] churches
[50:10] we find out that the church has got out
[50:12] of order
[50:15] they left their first love his own list
[50:19] and there's so much out of order
[50:23] God himself calls him Babylon
[50:28] Babylon a ball of confusion
[50:32] when God sent William Branham
[50:36] who is our Elijah
[50:40] Elijah came to put things back in order
[50:45] the first thing he uh one of the things
[50:48] that we know
[50:50] that he put back in place
[50:53] was the altar of God
[50:57] hallelujah amen how many people thought
[51:01] that the church was the thing that saved
[51:04] them
[51:07] but I don't care who whose Church you go
[51:10] to Allah
[51:14] Church represents a woman legally is
[51:17] represents in farm and there is no
[51:19] church that can save you
[51:22] it took a male
[51:26] lambes
[51:28] he was the Lamb of God
[51:33] who was Jesus Christ himself
[51:37] what are we doing
[51:39] why is this time
[51:45] what is
[51:48] the space and time that God has allotted
[51:52] to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[52:01] according to Matthew 25
[52:08] to prepare herself to lead her Lord
[52:13] and believe you are not
[52:16] has been allotted to you
[52:20] prepare yourself to meet the Lord
[52:26] has an end to it
[52:29] one day the door will be shut
[52:33] and the Gentile age will
[52:38] hallelujah amen so this time was given
[52:42] to us
[52:44] you say not now
[52:46] but I asked the question if not now
[52:52] Hallelujah the Bible said that the bride
[52:55] is making herself ready
[52:59] nobody can make
[53:31] this is your time
[54:09] [Music]
[54:18] Queen Esther foreign
[55:03] we think the Judge foreign
[56:03] that's what Paul says he said basically
[56:08] wherever I find myself
[56:12] I am going to be content
[56:16] I am going to be content I'm going to be
[56:19] happy
[56:24] no matter what I go through
[56:28] I know who's leading me
[56:31] hallelujah amen those of us who are
[56:34] parents
[56:35] we
[56:39] we children
[56:40] lives by our judgments
[56:44] we watch over them like Shepherds
[56:49] see them endanger themselves
[56:58] and sometimes our warning
[57:31] only when the child is immature
[57:39] the child being immature
[57:43] sometimes take the chastisement
[57:47] that's a cruel punishment in a position
[57:50] sometimes children think their parents
[57:53] hate their foreign
[57:58] [Music]
[58:12] [Music]
[58:24] coming up

[58:36] come on
[58:42] but she gave me one good one man
[58:48] I'll never forget it
[58:53] and I thought my mom was cruel
[58:57] because I didn't understand
[59:01] the endangerment
[59:04] of my life
[59:06] the thing that I did
[59:09] if I if my mom had not given me the good
[59:13] ones
[59:19] more than likely I would have been dead
[59:23] or in jail
[59:26] hallelujah amen it was only when I
[59:29] matured
[59:30] and look back and what she did there is
[59:36] when I said Thank you
[59:42] and I thank you for doing what you did
[59:48] um
[59:51] hallelujah amen
[59:54] my mom didn't cut off limbs my man
[59:57] doesn't treat me uh uh
[1:00:01] she didn't cut limbs off the tree
[1:00:05] she went down to the root of the tree
[1:00:10] John the Baptist in Italy and she
[1:00:13] uprooted
[1:00:17] she wanted to make sure
[1:00:20] that that would never return again

[1:10:18] hallelujah in the minds of the Pharisees
[1:10:20] and the Sadducees
[1:10:33] so when you magnify the word of the Lord
[1:10:42] of God
[1:10:45] all have sinned to Encounter of the
[1:10:48] glory of God

[1:14:24] Paul said follow me
[1:14:29] hallelujah amen so it's not me you

[1:15:50] hallelujah amen let me show you what
[1:15:53] brother Brandon says
[1:15:55] a true Mount Transfiguration experience
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:06] it only glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:12] he said that
[1:16:15] a true man of God will not even glorify
[1:16:20] himself
[1:16:25] hallelujah amen
[1:16:27] y'all remember when I first came here
[1:16:30] some of y'all wanted to carry my books
[1:16:42] I appreciate
[1:16:45] thank you
[1:16:52] nonsense nonsense Vermont
[1:16:55] it ain't even scripture
[1:17:00] Hallelujah yeah I'm being real it's just
[1:17:03] you God has an order and we see the
[1:17:07] nucleation Spirit message
[1:17:14] tolerate it
[1:17:24] that man is leading to hell
[1:17:30] oh y'all don't think of it like that huh
[1:17:33] like I said if I had been sitting in
[1:17:36] this church
[1:17:39] he would have felt a wind go by him yeah
[1:17:53] mm-hmm
[1:17:57] Hallelujah you love the Lord you're
[1:18:00] different but I'm trying to come to
[1:18:02] something I can't get there something
[1:18:04] keeps taking me somewhere else
[1:18:08] but the Bible says
[1:18:12] when you fall into divers Temptations
[1:18:17] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:18:20] faith
[1:18:24] y'all still need patience
[1:18:26] myself
[1:18:33] but you don't look at the trials
[1:18:36] as being a curse from God
[1:18:40] expects you to wait
[1:18:43] [Music]
[1:18:44] God wants you to be long suffering
[1:18:50] you've got to be long sufferings
[1:19:03] the trial brings a change
[1:19:07] every test brings a change
[1:19:11] without the test you'll never know
[1:19:18] but when you pass the test
[1:19:23] you know something has changed
[1:19:29] people say oh Lord have mercy I'm trying
[1:19:31] if you can get this message that I'm
[1:19:34] trying to give unto you this morning
[1:19:43] that God is allowing to come to you
[1:19:50] Paul said I'm going to rejoice in my
[1:19:53] infirmities
[1:19:58] that's a mature
[1:20:02] a person who can Rejoice
[1:20:08] hallelujah amen
[1:20:11] you know
[1:20:13] and I hope I'm not out of line
[1:20:16] but you know our brother Orville kabamba
[1:20:20] is expectations
[1:20:22] a young man I think he just turned 20.
[1:20:29] how many universities affliction
[1:20:36] this man is suffering with cancer
[1:20:40] out with cancer it is
[1:20:47] every time I go by to see him every time
[1:20:51] I call him I am getting better
[1:20:58] y'all understand what I'm saying
[1:21:02] my next question mark question how many
[1:21:05] of you have been praying for him
[1:21:10] because remember when Peter James and
[1:21:13] John
[1:21:14] in the prison the whole church
[1:21:19] went into prayer
[1:21:21] is that right amen I mean they were so
[1:21:25] consumed by prayer
[1:21:30] Tabitha thought it was a ghost
[1:21:35] but the point is they were so powerful
[1:21:39] in their prayers
[1:21:40] God dispatched foreign
[1:22:05] God would answer first
[1:22:08] he said the Son of God because
[1:22:14] we're closer are related to God
[1:22:20] y'all understand what I'm saying
[1:22:24] our prayer we pray can shake heaven
[1:22:31] Hallelujah
[1:22:34] you understand me we do not have
[1:22:39] to know different parts
[1:22:41] the Situation's linger
[1:22:47] before
[1:22:52] you approach god with hope that's all
[1:22:54] you're going to get is Hope who is this
[1:22:56] but even if you don't have to say
[1:23:00] ask God foreign yes
[1:23:18] you don't have the faith to overcome
[1:23:20] something in your life you should say
[1:23:22] God I don't have it
[1:23:25] is
[1:23:34] my Lord Jesus you just shall live by
[1:23:38] your face
[1:23:40] your face
[1:23:44] hallelujah amen it works
[1:23:51] Psalms 97 I'm trying to show you
[1:23:54] something someone else said you've ever
[1:23:56] taken shows because the Judgment of God
[1:23:58] is all not always it is not cruel like
[1:24:01] you think God
[1:24:06] judgment watches you
[1:24:10] not yourself not just your head
[1:24:13] he watches you in your heart
[1:24:16] he watches your heart July because the
[1:24:21] Bible said as a man thinketh in his
[1:24:22] heart
[1:24:26] you understand me so God watches the
[1:24:30] power
[1:24:32] he protects you for potential
[1:24:38] come on folks how many of you in here
[1:24:41] have ever thought to do wrong
[1:24:43] [Music]
[1:24:48] but God protected you may give that
[1:24:51] position
[1:24:54] I I say like like this he ran a
[1:24:57] roadblock
[1:25:02] you don't have to say I know what I'm
[1:25:04] talking about you have an intention to
[1:25:06] do wrong foreign
[1:25:16] you might as well be truthful but take
[1:25:19] care of yourself because I know how he
[1:25:20] works that's because you're sick on
[1:25:22] myself you say oh God don't work like
[1:25:23] that oh Julius
[1:25:26] David was going to kill neighbor
[1:25:29] is that right but God watching majority
[1:25:34] see what God did was he spoke his
[1:25:37] judgment
[1:25:39] through Abigail yeah
[1:25:43] sometimes God will speak his judgment
[1:25:45] through somebody else
[1:25:48] they don't know what you intend to do
[1:25:54] and that word would be the very thing
[1:25:56] you need to hear okay
[1:26:03] that's God's judgment that is God who's
[1:26:07] watching over yourself
[1:26:11] and Abigail say don't worry about it
[1:26:14] my husband is a fool normally
[1:26:18] a temple
[1:26:19] right
[1:26:21] his name is fool his name is neighbor
[1:26:23] Sonos
[1:26:28] don't let his blood man listen be on
[1:26:31] your hands
[1:26:38] is that right over sometimes
[1:26:42] Revenge
[1:26:44] when somebody do what's wrong we won't
[1:26:48] reveal and when you desire Revenge
[1:26:56] vengeance is mine
[1:27:01] pass all your cares on him for he cares
[1:27:06] for you
[1:27:13] but when you try to fight
[1:27:22] um
[1:27:32] Zion heard and was glad
[1:27:35] Psalm 77
[1:27:37] 8-12 we uh dudes Hallelujah I don't have
[1:27:41] my watch
[1:27:46] oh it's 1208
[1:27:47] I'll be done by three
[1:27:49] yeah
[1:27:52] give me a few more minutes
[1:27:58] I don't know which one of those times
[1:28:00] are right but
[1:28:01] Zion heard and was glad
[1:28:04] and the daughters of Judah Rejoice
[1:28:07] because of the Judgment of God of oh
[1:28:10] Lord because of that judgment oh Lord is
[1:28:21] you you hear that because of his
[1:28:24] judgments
[1:28:27] for thou Lord art high above all the
[1:28:31] Earth
[1:28:31] Thou Art exalted far above all gods
[1:28:36] you
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:45] ye that love the Lord hate evil
[1:28:50] he preserveth the soul of his Saints
[1:28:53] he delivered them out of the hand of the
[1:28:55] wicked yeah y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:28:59] hallelujah
[1:29:01] it's amazing because a lot of time I I
[1:29:04] preached last week
[1:29:09] but we break promises
[1:29:12] and we say God if you do this for me
[1:29:14] I'll do this
[1:29:17] I don't ask for your promises but we'll
[1:29:20] make them
[1:29:21] anyways
[1:29:25] and the Bible says it's better for you
[1:29:28] not to break up now
[1:29:32] hallelujah amen how many of y'all
[1:29:34] remember the story of last uh uh uh
[1:29:39] a blind Bartimaeus versus foreign
[1:30:14] foreign
[1:30:35] God give you the job and you forget
[1:30:37] about it
[1:30:41] but we do that we do that we're human
[1:30:45] but God is a god of the middle of the
[1:30:48] road
[1:30:49] it still gives us Grace
[1:30:53] thank you but he won't kill you anyway
[1:31:00] God heals blind maname his wife

[1:34:25] tempted in that way I have
[1:34:27] um
[1:34:28] there was one time I was a season in my
[1:34:31] life I forgot how much money it was and
[1:34:35] everywhere I would go I would see the
[1:34:37] same number everywhere
[1:34:41] and I told these brothers I said I
[1:34:43] really believe that's that lottery
[1:34:44] number foreign
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:55] has brought us to one thing May
[1:35:58] journalism
[1:35:59] the church ages as I come
[1:36:02] they ended up out of order remember
[1:36:09] what they what they were doing
[1:36:12] they left Grace
[1:36:15] and they began to do a lot of Works they
[1:36:18] don't call myself
[1:36:19] some places it says your Works
[1:36:23] he comes and say Works twice
[1:36:27] Jesus comes and said to certain Church
[1:36:29] ages and your Works has been good and
[1:36:31] did you have any uh
[1:36:38] and what happened it's because they
[1:36:41] developed a system
[1:36:42] and that system it came along and
[1:36:47] leave your personal
[1:36:49] ity
[1:36:50] a place that you'll be governed only by
[1:36:53] the laws
[1:36:56] you won't even feel him sometimes but
[1:37:00] you'll be obedient to the things Crystal
[1:37:15] hallelujah amen and I'm not I'm not uh
[1:37:19] what I'm saying is as long as your your
[1:37:22] life if you allowing your your
[1:37:24] weaknesses
[1:37:27] to constantly condemn you you have not
[1:37:31] received the revelation of Calvary
[1:37:37] is that right I'll just take the message
[1:37:40] for what it is
[1:37:43] when God justifies you you are Justified
[1:37:47] as though you've never sinned in the
[1:37:50] first place
[1:37:51] but we allow our paths
[1:38:01] when something is placed under the blood
[1:38:06] and the devil has no Authority
[1:38:10] that's what the Bible
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:17] dominion over you
[1:38:19] know
[1:38:24] you are on somebody's law or systems
[1:38:41] hello
[1:38:45] and when we harshly judge our brothers
[1:38:47] and sisters for errors
[1:38:53] what law are you running by I don't know
[1:38:58] because if you examine yourself
[1:39:05] Hallelujah
[1:39:07] I ain't never done that before I'm sure
[1:39:10] that's what the Pharisees thoughts
[1:39:12] and then Jesus said let the one who
[1:39:14] without saying
[1:39:19] am I making sense
[1:39:21] the Bible says they will know
[1:39:28] because of the love that you have of
[1:39:31] course
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:36] that's it
[1:39:38] God is trying to bring us into love into
[1:39:42] his Divine Love
[1:39:44] Story
[1:39:46] Grace has played his part
[1:39:49] lagrasse Grace will lead us on
[1:39:53] but when you allow Grace
[1:39:58] you understand what I'm saying
[1:40:01] grace is just
[1:40:04] how can I say it as long as you continue
[1:40:07] to rely on Grace well she don't thank
[1:40:10] you
[1:40:11] I never mature
[1:40:17] you know what I mean by that I'm sorry
[1:40:18] if I do wrong I know he's going to
[1:40:22] forgive me so I'll do wrong
[1:40:26] you understand me
[1:40:29] and that's what people have been doing
[1:40:32] oh great we're on the grace
[1:40:35] and you never overcome Karma conquer the
[1:40:38] sin everyone y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:40:40] grace
[1:40:44] who fixes the problem
[1:40:48] said we continue in sin is that my word
[1:40:50] that Grace may have abound God forbid
[1:40:56] the church Ages was Grace Grace
[1:41:09] she did what she made herself ready
[1:41:14] she checked herself out every hour of
[1:41:18] the day
[1:41:19] control
[1:41:26] and got victory over over herself every
[1:41:29] day somebody help me
[1:41:32] this message comes to give us victory
[1:41:35] over ourselves
[1:41:38] [Applause]
[1:41:39] until we come into the full statue of
[1:41:42] Christ selfishness
[1:41:54] it has to leave your life
[1:41:59] bringing us into a condition
[1:42:05] and that condition must be holy a second
[1:42:08] condition Holiness without
[1:42:11] no man shall see the Lord
[1:42:15] oh I got the Holy Ghost but the Holy
[1:42:18] Ghost like I said God is not going to
[1:42:21] come in here and look into you
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:48] that's right that ribbon there in
[1:42:52] Jericho had to be put out the window it
[1:42:54] was in the house but the Scarlet had to
[1:42:57] be taken outside the house and placed on
[1:43:00] the outside so people could see it yeah
[1:43:06] it's not on the outside
[1:43:08] they can't see it
[1:43:12] foreign
[1:43:23] I'm coming to a close
[1:43:29] it's so you can understand God order
[1:43:31] okay
[1:43:32] separated the darkness from the light
[1:43:34] the Lord
[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:43:37] this is what we're having a hard time
[1:43:41] I told you uh some service some messages
[1:43:43] ago about the message of Satan the flood
[1:43:48] of Satan when Satan comes in like a
[1:43:51] flood
[1:43:54] come
[1:43:57] if you have left everything and we're
[1:43:59] not talking about our natural flood
[1:44:01] we're talking about a spiritual flood
[1:44:03] amen
[1:44:05] Satan has flooded the World
[1:44:09] by these instruments
[1:44:12] and your phone
[1:44:15] and all those apps you've got on there I
[1:44:18] have two seconds that is not a
[1:44:20] representation of the Holy Spirit
[1:44:23] you better delete them
[1:44:31] because you know what's going to happen
[1:44:33] that's because I've been thinking if I
[1:44:34] said think about it every time you feel
[1:44:36] a little bored foreign
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:45:04] for 15
[1:45:07] with it
[1:45:16] this is my brother when I'm saying I'm
[1:45:18] gonna let me end this quote foreign
[1:45:41] Christians
[1:45:44] but they are not Christians of the
[1:45:47] spirit
[1:45:49] they are Christians of the flesh
[1:45:53] they are bearing the name in vain
[1:45:58] Mark 7 7 Matthew said said
[1:46:02] how be it in vain
[1:46:05] do they worship me they sit down thank
[1:46:07] you teaching the doctrines of men
[1:46:10] but indeed they are Christians for what
[1:46:13] else could they be
[1:46:31] that's true
[1:46:32] there are other men
[1:46:34] dominance
[1:46:39] you say that ain't true
[1:46:42] then why are we divided
[1:46:48] only doctrines of
[1:46:50] menopause the Church of God
[1:46:54] I know what I'm talking about
[1:46:58] only doctrines of men
[1:47:02] is that a word let's say like brothers
[1:47:08] that was uh separated by a walk about
[1:47:13] the the Dogma they shook yourself he
[1:47:17] said and then the flood waters came up
[1:47:20] [Music]
[1:47:21] above the wall and then they began to
[1:47:23] Fellowship it says uh
[1:47:34] don't worry
[1:47:36] there's a flood coming
[1:47:38] and these little walls that these people
[1:47:41] got it says send me the hindrance of us
[1:47:43] us fellowshipping
[1:47:46] Hallelujah
[1:47:50] you won't worry about What doctrine
[1:47:54] somebody else has you'll be so glad to
[1:47:57] see a Christian
[1:47:59] somebody's standing for the word
[1:48:03] and if they feel the page we ought to be
[1:48:06] happy
[1:48:07] hallelujah amen you know Paul them
[1:48:11] didn't say What doctrine do you believe
[1:48:16] say have you received the Holy Ghost do
[1:48:20] you have any questions
[1:48:22] by one Spirit we're baptized
[1:48:26] and said let's pray somebody said call
[1:48:30] I'm almost done really yeah this is my
[1:48:32] last quote
[1:48:35] Yeah Do Me In Worship in vain the main
[1:48:38] worship they get says but indeed they
[1:48:40] are Christians for what else could they
[1:48:43] be
[1:48:43] foreign
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:24] born of a virgin
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:02] Christian Scientists have done that
[1:50:06] already as well as multitudes who preach
[1:50:09] a social gospel
[1:50:16] social he is a nominal Christian
[1:50:20] it belongs to the church
[1:50:23] but he is not a true
[1:50:26] or spiritual believer
[1:50:30] spirituality that kind of believer is
[1:50:33] one who has been baptized in the body of
[1:50:36] Christ
[1:50:37] and he is a member of him
[1:50:40] but nonetheless
[1:50:42] it is in God's order
[1:50:46] that the tales grow up with the wheat
[1:50:49] okay
[1:50:51] not to be uprooted
[1:50:54] that is commandment of God
[1:50:57] their day for binding and burning is
[1:51:00] coming
[1:51:04] but not yet pancola
[1:51:08] so the spirit is speaking to this mixed
[1:51:11] group a lot less people I say as a group
[1:51:14] mix on the one hand he is praising
[1:51:18] and on the other hand he is rebuking
[1:51:22] he has told what is right with the True
[1:51:25] Believers
[1:51:27] now he warns what the false Vine must do
[1:51:31] that
[1:51:34] stand Justified before
[1:51:44] but my point is this
[1:51:47] until we break take the right attitude
[1:51:54] toward our trials
[1:51:58] toward uh the testing of the lord
[1:52:04] your attitude toward those things
[1:52:10] is the is the determining Factor so so
[1:52:15] whether you are mature
[1:52:18] you know still being vague
[1:52:21] an immature adolescence
[1:52:28] this is your time
[1:52:31] I wish I could have brought it out in in
[1:52:34] a greater way disrespective but I'm
[1:52:36] telling you now
[1:52:38] if you missed your opportunity
[1:52:41] this space right now I said it's nice to
[1:52:46] have good things
[1:52:47] nice to work hard to have good things
[1:52:52] that's not your priority
[1:52:55] oh it shouldn't be your priority yes
[1:52:58] your priorities should be making the
[1:53:01] Rapture
[1:53:03] your priorities should be off
[1:53:14] y'all understand me amen I can't cry it
[1:53:17] out enough
[1:53:20] I can't cry out enough
[1:53:23] just to give you a thought
[1:53:26] every natural thing has a spiritual
[1:53:28] application
[1:53:31] how many of y'all know that the river
[1:53:33] Euphrates is drying up
[1:53:36] he said again the river Euphrates is
[1:53:39] drying up
[1:53:41] the river you you can't be yourself
[1:53:51] that's a real truth celebrity
[1:53:54] and if you know your Bible you'll
[1:53:56] understand what is symbolism
[1:54:05] we know that the demons
[1:54:08] that came out of Euphrates
[1:54:11] what they did to to the Germans I mean
[1:54:14] to the Jews
[1:54:16] even on the hips
[1:54:25] those same demons
[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:55:10] two seconds
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:28] and things like that took place
[1:55:32] that took place and it shows it was just
[1:55:35] as important as the now River was to
[1:55:37] Egypt
[1:55:41] and what happened with those demons
[1:55:44] left Germany they came here it's a demo
[1:55:47] said what happened
[1:55:49] America boomed
[1:55:52] technology
[1:55:59] technology you know what I'm saying
[1:56:01] everything with Scott with shadows
[1:56:06] of course
[1:56:08] because the antelope
[1:56:12] is now driving the people
[1:56:18] into the Judgment of God
[1:56:21] it won't be water this time
[1:56:24] it will be fire
[1:56:56] they're breaking down the people in
[1:56:59] prison so the people can become slaves
[1:57:04] taking away all your
[1:57:06] s everywhere
[1:57:10] they're doing the same thing what have
[1:57:14] they done they have United
[1:57:16] and even as the darkness is uniting the
[1:57:20] Bride of Jesus Christ supposed to be
[1:57:22] United

[1:59:08] only thing left is for the Bride of

[2:00:22] we reveal more sin
[2:00:26] people who are on the law
[2:00:29] they become weaker
[2:00:32] because they realize what
[2:00:34] they cannot performance
