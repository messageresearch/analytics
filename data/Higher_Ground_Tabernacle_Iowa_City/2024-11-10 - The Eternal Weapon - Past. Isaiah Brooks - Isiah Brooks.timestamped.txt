[46:16] inspiration of what I was
[46:20] told and I did blame the
[46:24] church what the transaction that had had
[46:27] taken
[46:29] place and then now I
[46:33] realize it wasn't the
[46:36] church it was other things that caused a
[46:39] problem I'm not going to go into detail
[46:42] y'all know what I
[46:43] mean but I want to say by the grace of
[46:47] God without
[46:49] battles there is no
[46:52] Victory there is not one church that I
[46:55] know of
[46:58] that that doesn't undergo
[47:02] battles and I I want to say this to
[47:05] clarify something
[47:08] else we wanted to have another meeting
[47:11] here a meeting that
[47:18] Saturday but that was my
[47:21] choice and even though the deacons said
[47:24] that they couldn't make it
[47:27] I I could have pushed that
[47:30] on but to be honest with you I didn't
[47:32] want to have a meeting without them
[47:34] being
[47:35] here and that was the reason
[47:38] why we did not have an that meeting
[47:44] immediately I praise the Lord for that
[47:47] because it gave me time to
[47:50] think it gave me time to to to think
[47:54] about all of the things that have been
[47:56] taking place
[47:57] things that I had
[48:00] said and the things that I meant to
[48:04] say those things that I did not mean to
[48:08] say but I want to say to the church as
[48:11] your Pastor I pray that you forgive me
[48:14] for anything that I may have said or
[48:18] done that threw you
[48:21] off my intention is to see this church
[48:25] grow
[48:29] but I need to see you grow
[48:32] spiritually more than
[48:36] naturally and in order for us to grow we
[48:38] have to be
[48:40] faithful in the things in which God has
[48:44] called called us to be faithful
[48:47] in none of us can pay for the goodness
[48:50] of
[48:51] God and all of us can agree God is good
[48:57] all of us can agree that God is
[49:01] good and as I said
[49:04] before I really believe that you are the
[49:08] gold that God sent to this
[49:11] country but even
[49:14] so gold must be
[49:17] purged it has to be
[49:20] cleansed and you're going to you
[49:24] must have the will
[49:27] for God to clean
[49:29] you he's not going to force anything on
[49:33] you but in this
[49:35] journey as a preacher whether it's me or
[49:39] someone
[49:40] else the house of
[49:43] God is the house of
[49:46] correction and we must
[49:49] understand that though you may have a
[49:51] pastor or preacher up
[49:53] here we are human make
[49:57] mistakes sometime we get in our human
[50:01] element is that right well let me ask
[50:04] you do you all get in your human element
[50:08] sometimes aren't we glad that it's all
[50:10] about
[50:13] Grace I want to say one more thing and
[50:16] I'm going go get into the
[50:18] message I'm not
[50:20] weak yet I'm
[50:23] weak I'm weak in myself
[50:27] but I'm strong in
[50:29] him you understand me our our
[50:34] desire is to make a
[50:38] Rapture and this is not a time to play
[50:40] with
[50:43] that it is so
[50:46] simple that most people
[50:48] bypass the reality on how close and how
[50:51] simple it is to make a
[50:55] rapture I thank God it is
[51:00] not based upon my
[51:03] works or your
[51:05] works it is the grace of
[51:09] God now let us
[51:13] stand one thing I said in the meeting
[51:17] yesterday that is we must learn how to
[51:20] love one
[51:23] another and and the Lord it showed me
[51:28] about true
[51:31] love I'm not talking about the affili
[51:34] love I'm talking about the real
[51:37] love that's will will will will lay down
[51:42] their
[51:44] lives or its life real love will lay its
[51:47] life
[51:51] down for those who even hate you
[51:57] is that the
[51:59] truth Jesus did it he said father
[52:02] forgive them for they know not what they
[52:05] do Steven did
[52:07] it while being
[52:09] stoned he said Lord hold not these
[52:13] things to their
[52:15] charge not only did he love those
[52:18] people but he he he forgave
[52:21] them as they stoned him to death
[52:26] now this seems this kind of
[52:30] love seems so far
[52:34] away but it's
[52:36] not the scripture says it's not the even
[52:40] in your
[52:43] mouth as we stand I'm glad to have my
[52:46] wife with
[52:48] me and she's looking really lovely
[52:53] today amen that's one of the gifts that
[52:56] were given to her for her
[52:58] birthday ion
[53:03] call amen she's really proud of the that
[53:06] dress and the other one as
[53:09] well so we we thank God for his
[53:12] grace Proverbs
[53:16] 3 another thing I'll
[53:19] say yes they did a
[53:22] transformation yeah
[53:26] in my heart and my wife's
[53:33] heart sorry I just get
[53:43] emotional I left
[53:45] out the
[53:49] meeting last night feeling like family
[53:57] y'all understand
[54:00] me the discussions that we had the
[54:04] openness that we
[54:09] had made me come to know you
[54:15] better and I really felt
[54:20] connected and we thank
[54:22] you we thank you
[54:27] Proverbs
[54:29] 3
[54:33] 5-6 and then we'll go to Deuteronomy
[54:41] 2327 and it reads Proverbs
[54:44] 3 begin beginning at the fifth
[54:48] verse it said trust in the Lord with all
[54:52] thine
[54:54] heart and lean not unto thine own
[55:01] understanding in all thy ways
[55:03] acknowledge
[55:07] Him and He Shall
[55:10] direct thy
[55:15] path Deuteronomy
[55:19] 33 27 Vin
[55:36] it
[55:41] reads the Eternal God Is Thy
[55:49] refuge and underneath are the
[55:52] Everlasting Arms
[55:59] and he shall Thrust out the enemy from
[56:02] before
[56:05] thee and shall say destroy
[56:11] them let us
[56:13] pray Heavenly Father we thank you for
[56:17] your
[56:18] grace we thank you for your
[56:21] goodness we thank you for being so good
[56:24] to
[56:24] us Lord Lord in all of our airing
[56:29] ways you love us
[56:31] still What a Mighty God you are no words
[56:37] can express our
[56:40] gratitude and father we love you because
[56:43] of who you
[56:44] are bless this
[56:46] service bless those who uh have been
[56:52] confused and
[56:53] troubled we pray Lord God
[56:56] you being the Prince of Peace may bring
[57:00] peace to their hearts this
[57:02] morning Father we thank you for your
[57:05] goodness in Jesus Christ name we
[57:08] pray amen amen you may be
[57:11] seated I am going to try to go as slowly
[57:14] as I possibly can this
[57:17] morning because I want you to see
[57:20] something and Revelation is not
[57:22] something that you as a individual you
[57:25] can re
[57:29] many many of times we as preachers we we
[57:33] try to reveal something to
[57:38] you but only Jesus
[57:40] Christ can reveal to
[57:43] you where we are in this day at this
[57:50] time my subject this
[57:53] morning is the eternal weapon
[57:59] tree the Eternal weapon
[58:05] tree if I had a subject or
[58:10] subtopic it would be the steadfast love
[58:13] of
[58:16] God steadfast love of God unchanging
[58:19] love of
[58:24] God when we talk talk about
[58:28] Weaponry there's a difference between
[58:31] weaponry and
[58:35] weapons because a weapon can be one
[58:38] thing like a
[58:41] gun or
[58:44] knife but
[58:47] Weaponry is a group of
[58:52] weapons like
[58:54] America we have different types of
[58:59] bombs we have bombs that could be
[59:02] launched from a
[59:04] ship we have those that can be launched
[59:08] from a
[59:10] plane we have guns that we call
[59:15] automatics all kinds of
[59:17] things but
[59:20] collectively we have all of these
[59:24] things for our
[59:28] defense very
[59:31] seldom to my
[59:34] knowledge America goes in to conquer a
[59:39] country I'm not saying they don't do
[59:42] it but they don't tell
[59:45] me but as an
[59:48] American we we feel
[59:51] safe because of our weaponry
[59:56] y'all can agree with
[59:58] that and we know that there are enemies
[1:00:01] out
[1:00:04] there but because of the
[1:00:08] Weaponry the enemy will always
[1:00:12] fear that if they start a
[1:00:16] war uh they think within
[1:00:21] themselves will I be able to win the war
[1:00:27] so many times Wars
[1:00:33] are having
[1:00:36] Weaponry a great
[1:00:38] Weaponry also bring
[1:00:43] peace because that devil
[1:00:46] knows that he starts
[1:00:49] something he won't be the one that
[1:00:51] finishes
[1:00:53] it you know you you you see seen
[1:00:57] that you know
[1:00:59] in in
[1:01:02] movies when somebody wants to
[1:01:07] fight the guy who knows he's he's a
[1:01:11] weapon he might say are you
[1:01:15] sure you want to start
[1:01:18] this because he's
[1:01:21] confident that what he knows
[1:01:26] he
[1:01:28] understands how bad he how badly he can
[1:01:31] beat his
[1:01:35] opponent so he he literally give
[1:01:39] that challenge a moment of
[1:01:45] Grace and sometimes foolish
[1:01:49] men go on and take the
[1:01:53] challenge and once they get into
[1:01:58] it no doubt they wish they had
[1:02:02] not I'm dealing with something and I'm
[1:02:04] trying to build a
[1:02:07] platform because I want you to
[1:02:10] understand my weapon
[1:02:13] Tre your weapon
[1:02:17] Tre is
[1:02:20] God y'all understand what I mean with
[1:02:23] that because we use use the scripture
[1:02:28] often greater is
[1:02:31] he that's in
[1:02:33] you than he that is in the
[1:02:38] world but my question this morning
[1:02:41] is what is your greater
[1:02:46] than what is your greater
[1:02:50] than or who is your greater than
[1:02:56] here the scripture according to
[1:02:59] Deuteronomy said the Eternal
[1:03:03] God is my
[1:03:07] refuge and when you think about the
[1:03:11] Eternal you must understand there's
[1:03:15] nothing that can defeat him wait a
[1:03:19] minute y'all see you're not you're not
[1:03:22] let me go back to Greater is he
[1:03:25] in
[1:03:28] you that's the god of your
[1:03:33] Weaponry that's why the Bible says no
[1:03:36] weapon formed against
[1:03:39] you shall
[1:03:41] prosper come on people I I need you to
[1:03:44] enter into the thought that I'm trying
[1:03:46] to bring to
[1:03:48] you because sometime we
[1:03:51] forget that we're just a
[1:03:54] portion of the Mighty
[1:03:59] God and this God is not
[1:04:04] selfish he uses us
[1:04:08] sometimes in
[1:04:10] war to declare his
[1:04:15] preeminence over
[1:04:20] Satan can I say it like
[1:04:22] this I used this example yesterday
[1:04:26] God is the creator of Good and
[1:04:30] Evil and God said be
[1:04:32] thankful it says in all things give
[1:04:37] thanks the thing is because when Satan
[1:04:41] comes we only see the
[1:04:44] evil and we rarely ever see the
[1:04:47] good but in every
[1:04:51] situation there is a positive and a
[1:04:54] negative
[1:04:56] God is doing
[1:04:59] something oh
[1:05:01] my we we we we we
[1:05:04] look for an example at at
[1:05:08] Daniel Daniel living
[1:05:11] holy Daniel living
[1:05:15] righteously Daniel praying three times a
[1:05:20] day and the devil hates
[1:05:23] it because Daniel is a
[1:05:26] reflection of the God he
[1:05:29] served that's why the devil hates
[1:05:32] you cuz you're living right when you
[1:05:35] walking right when you talking right
[1:05:39] here comes
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:45] trouble yall understand
[1:05:48] me but you see we don't see the flip
[1:05:52] side we go through the suffering
[1:05:56] for the glory and honor of
[1:05:59] God right am because God wanted to
[1:06:04] prove to the king of
[1:06:08] Babylon that there was somebody
[1:06:11] greater than the
[1:06:15] king and the only way he could show
[1:06:18] that he had to use
[1:06:23] Daniel as a weapon
[1:06:27] right and that's what we fail to see
[1:06:30] light always conquered
[1:06:34] darkness and and in in in this king's
[1:06:38] Kingdom there was
[1:06:40] light and they didn't like
[1:06:43] it the devil didn't so what he what did
[1:06:47] he do he FAL
[1:06:50] accuse
[1:06:52] Daniel and God says yes you're falling
[1:06:56] right into my
[1:06:58] trap Hallelujah now think about it
[1:07:02] Daniel didn't know what God was
[1:07:04] doing all Daniel knows that he was being
[1:07:08] accused and he knew he was
[1:07:11] right he knew that the enemy was coming
[1:07:13] against
[1:07:14] him one thing Daniel knew that the king
[1:07:18] and all his accusers did not
[1:07:22] know knew that God
[1:07:26] the true God was his
[1:07:30] God see no matter what comes your
[1:07:34] way recognize the darkness are just
[1:07:38] demons coming against the
[1:07:42] light but ye are the lights of the world
[1:07:44] come
[1:07:45] on and that devil cannot defeat
[1:07:49] you look to see what God is doing
[1:07:55] throw Daniel in the Lion's
[1:08:00] Den Lions had to
[1:08:04] obey the Lions had to
[1:08:08] Bow is that all
[1:08:10] right when the king came back the next
[1:08:15] morning he said oh
[1:08:17] Daniel did your God deliver thee
[1:08:25] it is the king of
[1:08:29] Babylon praising
[1:08:31] God and he didn't even know
[1:08:34] it
[1:08:36] hallelujah amen and Daniel
[1:08:40] replied live long oh
[1:08:43] King my
[1:08:46] God is
[1:08:48] God hallelujah am my God has even made
[1:08:53] the Lion's mou
[1:08:58] shut the king pulled Daniel out in in
[1:09:05] Joy Daniel was a
[1:09:08] friend but he made a decree that he
[1:09:10] couldn't turn
[1:09:13] back look what this man
[1:09:16] did he said I'm going to put out a
[1:09:21] law that Daniel God is God
[1:09:27] Hallelujah see all the Demons of
[1:09:30] Hell know that your God is
[1:09:34] God all the demons Hallelujah when Jesus
[1:09:39] rose from the
[1:09:41] dead all hell
[1:09:44] knew from that point on that Jesus
[1:09:48] Christ is
[1:09:51] Lord but the believer you must come to a
[1:09:54] place to recognize
[1:09:57] the god you serve is
[1:10:01] God hallelujah and God will put you in
[1:10:06] situations to awaken
[1:10:09] you to the
[1:10:11] revelation of who he
[1:10:14] is is that right so here
[1:10:18] now every
[1:10:20] knee must
[1:10:22] bow every tongue must
[1:10:25] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[1:10:29] glory of the father Hallelujah see we
[1:10:33] look for it to happen here in the
[1:10:36] future but God is bending
[1:10:40] needs even
[1:10:42] today Hallelujah he's humbling the the
[1:10:46] the
[1:10:47] enemy even
[1:10:49] today hallelujah amen don't you ever
[1:10:53] think that uh Satan can build a
[1:10:57] wall that you can't
[1:11:00] penetrate
[1:11:02] Hallelujah he will make you think that
[1:11:05] you're trapped and you can't get
[1:11:08] out Hallelujah but the devil is a
[1:11:11] liar y'all hear what I'm
[1:11:14] saying God
[1:11:16] always have been
[1:11:18] able to defe
[1:11:21] Satan because he's the creator of Satan
[1:11:26] I want to come into
[1:11:29] this we say in
[1:11:32] Christ I'm in Christ what does that mean
[1:11:37] I'm in Christ people say I'm in the
[1:11:41] anointing what does that mean I'm in the
[1:11:45] anointing there's a lot of kinds of
[1:11:47] anointings I need to know which one
[1:11:49] you're in you understand me so when we
[1:11:53] say we're in Christ
[1:11:55] we're saying that we're are we are in
[1:12:00] love y'all didn't get
[1:12:02] it but to be in
[1:12:05] Christ is to be in
[1:12:10] love so you
[1:12:13] understand there is no
[1:12:16] space outside of
[1:12:20] God God created
[1:12:23] space god created
[1:12:26] time he feels
[1:12:29] everything and there is nothing outside
[1:12:32] of him everything is
[1:12:34] within y'all hear what I'm saying I
[1:12:36] don't care how great the galaxies
[1:12:40] are God is
[1:12:43] still the
[1:12:46] boundaries I guess I say like
[1:12:48] that because if there's something
[1:12:51] outside of
[1:12:53] God when was that
[1:12:57] created when did that come into
[1:13:01] existence but God clears it up for
[1:13:04] us he said if there is another
[1:13:07] God I know him
[1:13:10] not now
[1:13:11] Elohim is except existing one hear what
[1:13:15] I'm
[1:13:17] saying and how however God does
[1:13:22] it we do know one thing that when God
[1:13:26] created he did a a dimensional
[1:13:31] thing you understand me we would not
[1:13:34] have known that had it not been for a
[1:13:37] prophet to know that the
[1:13:40] heavens it's not just a a bunch of
[1:13:44] stars but Heaven is a
[1:13:47] place it it's another
[1:13:50] dimension where people live
[1:13:55] Angels
[1:13:57] Live God
[1:14:01] resides but in all of
[1:14:04] that God can never be bottled
[1:14:10] up bottled like in a
[1:14:17] bottle you understand what I'm
[1:14:19] saying even though
[1:14:22] Jesus was the fullness of the godhead
[1:14:27] there still was
[1:14:32] God because God is a
[1:14:35] spirit and he put all of his attributes
[1:14:38] his
[1:14:40] person into
[1:14:42] Jesus it wasn't two
[1:14:44] Gods it was one God clothing
[1:14:49] himself but he cannot stop being who he
[1:14:53] is
[1:14:55] you understand me he still was the
[1:14:58] self-existing
[1:15:00] one but now he's Jesus
[1:15:04] Christ Paul described it like this I
[1:15:07] believe it was Paul he said he's above
[1:15:10] all in all he's through
[1:15:14] all you
[1:15:16] understand so you
[1:15:19] understand not
[1:15:21] even a spider could can exist
[1:15:26] without
[1:15:29] God even the life of a
[1:15:33] spider is controlled by
[1:15:36] [Music]
[1:15:38] God y'all hear what I'm
[1:15:40] saying I want to see his
[1:15:44] greatness is farther or
[1:15:47] greater than we can
[1:15:50] comprehend Hallelujah if we can see how
[1:15:54] great he
[1:15:55] is we can then see how
[1:15:59] small our problems
[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:04] are come on
[1:16:07] somebody it doesn't even take a man a
[1:16:10] grown
[1:16:13] man to kill a
[1:16:18] spider you can be a
[1:16:21] child and all you got to do is do a
[1:16:23] stump
[1:16:26] yall understand see a lot of time we
[1:16:29] think that we've got to mature up to
[1:16:31] this great
[1:16:32] [Music]
[1:16:33] place but even a young
[1:16:36] child knows he had the
[1:16:39] authority the ability and the
[1:16:43] faith to kill a
[1:16:48] spider you get what I'm saying now we
[1:16:51] are
[1:16:52] maturing we're moving in to the the
[1:16:56] perfect statue of
[1:17:00] Christ all of his
[1:17:03] attributes is now being poured into
[1:17:08] man and the same God that dwell in
[1:17:14] Jesus dwells in
[1:17:17] US you understand me so let me let me
[1:17:21] say this
[1:17:22] quickly the problem with Christians
[1:17:26] is that they don't
[1:17:28] know that they're
[1:17:32] free yeah we're so
[1:17:35] busy trying to perfect
[1:17:39] ourselves when God has already done
[1:17:44] it we're so busy trying to help
[1:17:49] him when he doesn't even need your help
[1:17:55] he made a
[1:17:58] promise he that begun the good work in
[1:18:03] you it's faithful to complete
[1:18:07] it we hear the message of the
[1:18:10] hour that we were with
[1:18:12] him before the foundation of the
[1:18:16] world then Jesus as a
[1:18:19] man comes to say I never lost one
[1:18:25] so we don't worry about the
[1:18:29] journey we don't worry about the
[1:18:34] journey the journey must go
[1:18:38] through but Jesus didn't say I'm the
[1:18:42] journey he said I'm alpha and
[1:18:45] omega beginning and the ending
[1:18:48] hallelujah hallelujah and what we must
[1:18:51] realize or accept
[1:18:54] is the end of our
[1:18:57] faith and the end of our
[1:19:01] faith declare us as being
[1:19:08] perfect you understand where I'm going
[1:19:13] with now a quote coming from
[1:19:17] demonology paragraph 15
[1:19:26] see I'm riding high right I make my
[1:19:30] mistakes but I get right back
[1:19:33] up you understand I'm an
[1:19:37] eagle you are
[1:19:39] Eagle ah come on somebody you you you
[1:19:43] know sometime that the storm that wind
[1:19:45] may bring you down a little bit but all
[1:19:48] you got to do is check your wings check
[1:19:50] your wings check your
[1:19:52] wings Hallelujah amen as they say you've
[1:19:56] been born to
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:19:59] fly hallelujah
[1:20:02] hallelujah
[1:20:05] see and I'm going to say this before I
[1:20:07] read this
[1:20:08] quote what you see before
[1:20:12] you is not
[1:20:15] real in the eyes of
[1:20:19] Faith y'all hear what I'm
[1:20:22] saying because your your natural eyes
[1:20:25] has the ability to
[1:20:28] lie Hallelujah but your spiritual eyes
[1:20:33] look beyond what your natural eyes are
[1:20:36] declaring is that right even Abraham
[1:20:40] called those things that be
[1:20:42] not they were we have the
[1:20:46] ability look into the Future come on
[1:20:51] somebody it's the truth
[1:20:55] Hallelujah am brother Bram even said it
[1:20:58] he said if you're sick and if you can
[1:21:01] see yourself
[1:21:03] perfect he said you confess it keep
[1:21:05] confessing it keep confessing keep
[1:21:08] confessing it and that Vision will
[1:21:11] become
[1:21:15] reality Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[1:21:18] saying this is our weapon
[1:21:21] tree Hallelujah Heaven came down
[1:21:25] and Glory fill my
[1:21:27] soul understand me and who is this
[1:21:31] Glory Jesus Christ
[1:21:35] himself hallelujah amen he says in this
[1:21:40] quote now it's just like I think the
[1:21:44] gifts of the
[1:21:46] Spirit The Gift of the spirit is not the
[1:21:49] Holy
[1:21:50] Ghost it's the attributes of the Holy
[1:21:53] Ghost
[1:21:55] Gifts of healing speaking in
[1:21:58] tongues and all those other things are
[1:22:03] attributes it's a fruit that the trees
[1:22:07] bear see the tree the main thing the
[1:22:13] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is God
[1:22:19] and God
[1:22:20] is
[1:22:23] love and that that's another little area
[1:22:25] I can go
[1:22:26] in well John says it we have no need to
[1:22:30] teach you how to
[1:22:34] love because God is
[1:22:38] love now I'm going to say that
[1:22:41] too because a lot of us still don't know
[1:22:44] what love
[1:22:46] is and love is the mystery of this
[1:22:49] message
[1:22:55] it is the
[1:22:57] mystery of this
[1:23:01] age because in this age only a few
[1:23:05] people have met
[1:23:08] love I'm not talking about your affili
[1:23:11] your love you love somebody today and
[1:23:13] then you you don't have an attitude with
[1:23:16] them
[1:23:17] tomorrow I'm talking about a love that's
[1:23:22] unfailing it's something that God gives
[1:23:25] you and once he gives
[1:23:27] it you know you got
[1:23:30] it hallelujah amen how can I say it you
[1:23:34] can't even help
[1:23:36] yourself because love controls
[1:23:42] you love doesn't mean being
[1:23:46] mushy love is
[1:23:49] corrected love doesn't fear anything
[1:23:54] cuz this love is
[1:23:58] God I'm excited this
[1:24:01] morning because I know my
[1:24:04] Weaponry I realized that every
[1:24:08] situation God has something to defeat
[1:24:10] the Devil
[1:24:13] with
[1:24:14] Hallelujah absolutely can I say it like
[1:24:17] this all I got to do is get down on my
[1:24:21] knees and call 911
[1:24:26] Hallelujah maybe I can't get on my knees
[1:24:29] but the Bible said if I Call On
[1:24:32] Jesus is that right he will answer
[1:24:37] prayer prayer is a
[1:24:40] weapon the word is a
[1:24:43] weapon Hallelujah and praise is a
[1:24:49] weapon y'all believe Acts 17:28
[1:25:01] we're more than just
[1:25:03] men we're we're more than
[1:25:06] just being
[1:25:09] human we're more than just being an
[1:25:12] animal somebody help me here we we We
[1:25:15] Came From Another
[1:25:18] Dimension Hallelujah and we're kind of
[1:25:21] Trapped in this one
[1:25:26] but understand there are doors that can
[1:25:28] be
[1:25:29] open doors that faith can
[1:25:33] unlock Hallelujah and make the thing
[1:25:37] that we cannot see in this
[1:25:41] world come to
[1:25:44] pass
[1:25:46] Hallelujah when the Bible tells us that
[1:25:49] in the last days that men were not only
[1:25:54] control the elements of the
[1:25:58] Earth but he will also
[1:26:01] control the Demons of
[1:26:03] hell is that right that's why Jesus
[1:26:08] conquered he conquered
[1:26:10] politics he conquered
[1:26:13] religion he conquered death hell in the
[1:26:16] grave and when he con all of
[1:26:19] this he came back on the day of
[1:26:23] Pentecost
[1:26:25] and gave us the
[1:26:27] authority that he had
[1:26:30] received so that you can
[1:26:35] conquer death is upset with
[1:26:39] you because he realized he's a
[1:26:43] slave to the
[1:26:46] believer that's what he is brother bam
[1:26:50] said he's just a
[1:26:51] a a horse with a carriage
[1:26:55] when we
[1:26:57] die death can only just pull us into the
[1:26:59] presence of
[1:27:04] God yall y'all hear what I'm saying so
[1:27:07] when you die all you got to say get
[1:27:12] up y'all didn't get
[1:27:15] it some of y'all still afraid of
[1:27:18] death death can't hurt
[1:27:21] you brother Bram got up in that other
[1:27:25] Dimension and he said is this what I've
[1:27:27] been afraid
[1:27:30] of Mercy Lord acts 17 I better go keep
[1:27:35] on cuz I get carried away this
[1:27:38] morning act
[1:27:41] 1728 the Bible says for in him we
[1:27:47] live and
[1:27:49] move and have our being brother B said
[1:27:53] it
[1:27:54] he said God see every move you
[1:27:58] make the clothes you wear the thoughts
[1:28:02] that you having right
[1:28:04] now is being played before
[1:28:08] God what we fail to
[1:28:10] see is that Jesus is here
[1:28:15] now that's been a revelation to
[1:28:18] me recently God has revealed to me that
[1:28:22] Jesus is always with me
[1:28:25] [Music]
[1:28:26] and in knowing
[1:28:28] that I'm learning how to behave
[1:28:31] myself in the presence of Jesus you see
[1:28:35] it's only when you forget he's with you
[1:28:40] is when you allow your mind to think
[1:28:42] things that it shouldn't
[1:28:44] think it's only when you forget he's
[1:28:47] with you you behave yourselves
[1:28:52] unseemingly but when know he's
[1:28:56] there it puts you in a different frame
[1:28:59] of
[1:29:00] mind
[1:29:02] Hallelujah when your lord is in in your
[1:29:07] presence oh you just want to
[1:29:10] Bow you want to
[1:29:13] worship you want to make sure that
[1:29:15] everything that you're
[1:29:17] doing he's being pleased with
[1:29:22] it Hallelujah
[1:29:24] remember in him we
[1:29:27] live and move and have our
[1:29:30] being as certain also of your own
[1:29:33] prophets have
[1:29:37] said we are
[1:29:39] also
[1:29:42] his do y'all understand
[1:29:44] that now we are his
[1:29:48] offspring how does his offspring
[1:29:52] act Jesus The Offspring of
[1:29:57] God what did he do what made him
[1:30:02] different one thing about Jesus he only
[1:30:06] cared about the father's
[1:30:09] will Hallelujah he never
[1:30:13] complained God I don't even have a house
[1:30:15] to
[1:30:16] live I don't even have a donkey of my
[1:30:20] own he was the poorest
[1:30:24] King that ever
[1:30:26] lived Hallelujah he loved the
[1:30:30] ungodly Hallelujah he loved the
[1:30:34] sinner everything he did was trying to
[1:30:40] convert those that would hear his
[1:30:43] voice Hallelujah his whole
[1:30:47] being every
[1:30:49] day was father what would you have me to
[1:30:52] do
[1:30:56] that was his
[1:30:58] thinking and it comes down to
[1:31:01] say I can do
[1:31:03] nothing except the father show
[1:31:06] me we look at Jesus as being that way
[1:31:09] but if you're
[1:31:10] the God wants the same
[1:31:14] control is that all right see Abraham's
[1:31:18] faith
[1:31:19] is
[1:31:21] Supernatural and I told you I was going
[1:31:22] to go slow so I hope this is not getting
[1:31:24] to you I hope I'm not going too slow

[1:31:53] little bit of pain here and a little bit
[1:31:55] of pain

[1:31:58] me the real you is
[1:32:02] eternal Hallelujah you understand what
[1:32:05] I'm
[1:32:06] saying the word of God can never be
[1:32:12] defeated and you are the
[1:32:17] word so you understand you did not do
[1:32:21] this you don't even deserve
[1:32:27] you don't even
[1:32:29] deserve he did
[1:32:33] this many of us would have given up a
[1:32:35] long time
[1:32:38] ago like brother said many people say oh
[1:32:41] I'm just holding
[1:32:43] on we we're not holding
[1:32:45] on he's holding on to
[1:32:48] us yall know it's the truth
[1:32:54] many of us Feel So
[1:32:56] Unworthy Lord I don't even I don't even
[1:32:58] deserve
[1:32:59] this God has a
[1:33:02] string attached to your
[1:33:04] heart and he said maybe you feel like
[1:33:08] that but in my grace I made
[1:33:12] you and he's constantly pulling us come
[1:33:16] on now come
[1:33:20] on y'all looking at me like I'm crazy
[1:33:23] but I'm going to tell you something I'm
[1:33:25] preaching from experience right
[1:33:28] now I know what God has done for
[1:33:31] me hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:33:35] Romans
[1:33:38] 4:16 therefore it is a faith that it
[1:33:42] might be by grace to the end the promise
[1:33:46] might be
[1:33:47] sure to all the
[1:33:51] seed you have faith in God's
[1:33:55] grace you've made it
[1:34:01] already the older you
[1:34:04] get the longer you walk as a
[1:34:07] Christian you going to find
[1:34:10] out that all I thought I was doing to
[1:34:15] help has amounted to
[1:34:18] nothing it's all by the grace of
[1:34:21] God y hear what I'm saying it's all by
[1:34:24] the grace of
[1:34:25] God Paul said it's got to be that way it
[1:34:29] must be that way because
[1:34:33] otherwise some of us would have a reason
[1:34:35] to
[1:34:37] boast I did this I did that you didn't
[1:34:41] do nothing everything every good thing
[1:34:45] you've ever
[1:34:46] done has been caused by God's grace
[1:34:54] Hallelujah am glory to God not to that
[1:34:58] only which is of the
[1:35:03] law but to that also which is of faith
[1:35:06] of the faith of
[1:35:09] Abraham that's still in the
[1:35:13] 16 who is the father of us
[1:35:17] all as it is written I have made thee a
[1:35:19] father of many nations
[1:35:24] before him whom he he believed even
[1:35:29] God who Quicken the
[1:35:32] dead and call it those things which be
[1:35:35] not they
[1:35:37] were so you understand you can't even
[1:35:40] have the proper
[1:35:42] Faith until God quickens
[1:35:46] it y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:35:49] there have been times you may have been
[1:35:51] sick
[1:35:55] I'm heal and you
[1:35:57] heal and you know the word you know the
[1:36:00] word and there have been other times he
[1:36:03] didn't Quicken
[1:36:05] it Hallelujah am and you had to take
[1:36:08] some a
[1:36:11] leave some medication
[1:36:14] y he still did the
[1:36:17] healing Hallelujah but one was by
[1:36:21] faith and then the other one God use
[1:36:25] science but it's still God that healed
[1:36:29] you Hallelujah is that right there were
[1:36:32] times God spoke to
[1:36:34] someone and they received their healing
[1:36:37] and then there were others he said go
[1:36:40] wash in the foolish
[1:36:42] salom
[1:36:44] Hallelujah see so he uses both
[1:36:47] methods but we must always remember is
[1:36:51] still God
[1:36:55] hallelujah amen I'm going jump a little
[1:36:57] bit to a quote here just a
[1:36:59] moment here see in the message you don't
[1:37:02] heard this quot quote before faith is

[1:42:02] go for God so loved the
[1:42:05] world that gave His only begotten
[1:42:08] son that whosoever believeth in him
[1:42:12] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:42:17] life do you know a Christian can believe
[1:42:19] in
[1:42:21] God and still struggle with living
[1:42:27] right Hallelujah but he didn't say if
[1:42:30] you live
[1:42:31] right he said believeth in
[1:42:34] him you should not
[1:42:36] perish but have everlasting
[1:42:39] life see because you understand God paid
[1:42:42] your debt he paid it
[1:42:45] all I'm trying to liberate you this
[1:42:47] morning if you can see how free you are
[1:42:53] devil will be afraid to attack
[1:42:56] you because he knows your
[1:43:01] Weaponry for God sent not his son into
[1:43:05] the world to condemn the
[1:43:07] world but that the world through him
[1:43:09] might be saved God didn't come to
[1:43:12] condemn you he came to save you he that
[1:43:16] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[1:43:21] that believeth not is condemned already
[1:43:24] already Hallelujah because he has not
[1:43:27] believed in the name of the only
[1:43:30] begotten Son of God hallelujah and this
[1:43:34] is the
[1:43:35] condemnation that light is coming to the
[1:43:38] world and Men love Darkness rather than
[1:43:42] light because their deeds are
[1:43:45] evil Hallelujah listen one more quote
[1:43:50] maybe two I'm I'mma end on a quote so
[1:43:52] you you it's
[1:43:54] okay yeah you know it's better than last
[1:43:58] week isn't
[1:44:04] it
[1:44:06] Hallelujah this is the confession of
[1:44:08] brother
[1:44:10] Bram he said don't look to see a
[1:44:12] minister a
[1:44:16] pastor he said look to see
[1:44:19] Jesus if a person was looking to me as
[1:44:22] an example
[1:44:25] he said don't you never do
[1:44:28] that I got too many wrong things in my
[1:44:32] life you look to the real
[1:44:35] example Jesus
[1:44:37] Christ if I could help you I would do it
[1:44:42] I'm just your
[1:44:43] brother but he is your
[1:44:46] lord Look to Him and believe Hallelujah
[1:44:51] you only see him him as you look at him
[1:44:55] through the
[1:44:57] word because he is the
[1:45:00] word Look to Him with
[1:45:03] simple humble loving
[1:45:07] faith and say God cleanse
[1:45:12] me all my
[1:45:15] selfishness and take all
[1:45:18] impurities from me and let me from this
[1:45:23] day be holy
[1:45:27] thine he says see what God will do for
[1:45:31] you hallelujah amen listen in Jehovah
[1:45:35] JRA 17 he said no
[1:45:39] matter if a person was looking to me as
[1:45:43] an example don't you never do that I got
[1:45:47] too many wrong things in my
[1:45:49] life you look to the Eternal to the real
[1:45:54] example Jesus Christ Hallelujah he was
[1:45:58] the
[1:45:59] example don't look to one another look
[1:46:03] to him see he is the one to look
[1:46:08] to
[1:46:10] Hallelujah you you love the
[1:46:15] Lord leaving with this
[1:46:18] one I should have been read the law
[1:46:20] having a shadow
[1:46:23] the law having a shadow is the
[1:46:26] message
[1:46:29] 1956
[1:46:32] 621 here he says and I'm closing on this
[1:46:36] one he
[1:46:38] said no man come to
[1:46:41] me except my father draws
[1:46:44] him and God seeks
[1:46:48] man and not man seeking
[1:46:50] God so you don't have one thing to
[1:46:55] say but God God it was your
[1:47:00] grace that did
[1:47:02] it and then as long as you accept it in
[1:47:06] the belov how can God bring you into
[1:47:10] judgment when he's already judged
[1:47:14] Christ in your
[1:47:16] stad how could you have to suffer for
[1:47:19] your
[1:47:20] sins when Christ is already done
[1:47:24] it God will be a two Tim and an awful
[1:47:29] person he said that's
[1:47:32] right you re why I'm saying that because
[1:47:34] a lot of Christians people in this
[1:47:37] church here you done a lot of wrong
[1:47:40] things and you can't get over it and you
[1:47:44] suffer at times and the devil tell you a
[1:47:47] lie that you suffering for what you did
[1:47:51] the devil is
[1:47:55] he whom the son is set free is free
[1:47:59] indeed the spirit of the Lord is there
[1:48:02] is Liberty Hallelujah you must break
[1:48:07] through all of that
[1:48:09] nonsense that the devil is telling you
[1:48:13] to keep you down in your
[1:48:15] spirit
[1:48:17] hujjah Hallelujah let me read on I'm
[1:48:19] almost done when it was thoroughly paid
[1:48:23] by Jesus Christ and you accepted it and
[1:48:27] as long as God accepted
[1:48:30] Christ he accepted you with
[1:48:33] Christ and when he did do
[1:48:36] it before the foundation of the
[1:48:39] world and when he spoke him into
[1:48:43] existence he spoke you redeemed with him
[1:48:47] Hallelujah and your names was written in
[1:48:50] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:48:52] before the foundation of the
[1:48:55] world and then you're
[1:48:58] scared oh if I could just keep holding
[1:49:04] on I quit that long time
[1:49:08] ago I never even tried it in the first
[1:49:12] place I just turn
[1:49:15] loose and let him do the whole
[1:49:18] thing someone said when I was sick that
[1:49:22] time
[1:49:23] when I got over it said brother BR did
[1:49:27] you keep your religion doing your sick
[1:49:30] spell he said I said no sir it kept me
[1:49:36] see that's the difference and that's
[1:49:38] what happened Hallelujah I'm not holding
[1:49:42] on Hallelujah he's holding on to me
[1:49:47] Hallelujah perfect faith and this is it
[1:49:49] for real paragraph 1323
[1:49:53] notice now another perfect faith is a
[1:49:57] master of all
