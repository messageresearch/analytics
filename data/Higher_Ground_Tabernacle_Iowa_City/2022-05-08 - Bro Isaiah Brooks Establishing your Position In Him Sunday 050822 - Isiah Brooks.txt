so happy to be a part of the bride of jesus christ i was saying just the other day [Music] [Music] [Music] the script [Music] you know we very seldom give our officers uh you know praise but i at this moment in time i want to thank god for all of the deacons everybody that keeps [Music] we're going to start from saint john the 15th chapter we thank god for our brother isaac a due date [Music] so it really encouraged me and then we'll go to saint john 4. 23 through 24. double jeans sang or an f you know one thing about people when they come to your church they may not know much about what you believe but when they see happy faces when they see people stirred up about the word you the way you are i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing jesus accepts if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gathered them and cast them into the fire and they are burned [Music] if you abide in me and my word abide in you you could ask what you will and it shall be done unto you here is my father glorified that you be excuse me herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples sifu as the father have loved me so have i loved you [Music] but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father hallelujah in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in establishing yourself establishing excuse me establishing your position in him hallelujah amen lord teach us how to pray our gracious father appreciate it for your lord jesus we and who he is today [Music] what god is doing take a jew no doubt he would desire to be able to have it he cannot be but in the people hallelujah amen because what god is doing in this day basketball when the seals [Music] before you'll find that what what sealed the message of each church agenda [Music] remember the word of god even spoke la paul de diade to the samaritan woman and he made a statement that's that the jews knew who they were worshiping but he said to the samaritan woman you know not what you're worshiping that that's pretty scary you think that you're worshiping god do this god tells you that your worship is in vain you he said the end time oh my god he said the anti-spirit anti-christ spirit edica less please addicted that already work just like we had the mystery of godliness and that mystery of iniquity is to know that you're doing wrong can you do it anyway hallelujah amen right it was hidden among the traditions of men family tradition hallelujah amen you don't believe me but i'm by god's grace i hope to prove what i'm talking about you see that statement brother branham made way closer he said it places us this this opening of the seven seals [Music] all men's creeds hallelujah he brought in a consciousness god that we did not even know [Music] in the time of adam and eve ever they didn't have to look up to heaven and pray oh y'all understand me let's go for the company because their consciousness their connection [Music] that we speak out don't look along sharing of blood if you show this of a lamb only kane everything enter the fall but now maybe no that the blood has been applied and everything has been restored you and i must move who's your mother [Music] hallelujah amen this is why brother branham [Music] [Music] until uh [Music] you were deceived [Music] that spirit set the street started even in paul's day i'll come and say that they should definitely say i am of cephas for somebody some say i am appalled that's carnal thinking satisfaction there's only one man who died for you jesus christ said and him alone this is why brother branham [Music] he start rubbing us with words that we never the evidence of the holy ghost was speaking in tongues you only believe that because you were taught that the real holy ghost hallelujah but it was not the evidence [Music] you [Music] you must first find out where he is he said you should be able to see christ and if you read the scriptures gave us a true revelation christ mean anointing he is the only one there's not a second holy ghost [Music] so we find where christ is hallelujah amen the word of god said god wants wink that ignorance god does not weaken ignorance anymore he requires do you demand us god will judge us do you evaluate we're not talking about you've got to know this bible from a to z country is when you don't know god ignorance is in your house when you don't know god says but the hour coming let's put it this way and now he is when the true worshipers yes you're plugged you see what i'm saying even as a man he's saying there's one greater thing hallelujah and this one is the father who is [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] has a [Music] but when luther [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen what wesley priests what's good for the wesleyan pool nation they were slaves hallelujah and so therefore and see even as a lutherans understand the wesleyan's message hallelujah amen but if the wesleyans see what lewis and he did not move into the pentecostal lane they cannot make the the rapture hallelujah so now we've come to a pentecostal age that revealed see the pentecostals in the old testament it's a shadow in time hallelujah [Music] [Music] and you know it [Music] [Music] [Music] somebody who had no name he's a part of an organization he was chosen by god to be the queen of this [Music] you know the pentecostal church they had gifts of desserts even so much when it comes to the gift of the prophet memphis yeah i understand me it was the pentecostals who had the prophet before we did they panted [Music] [Music] amen because god was looking for a woman he was looking for a church he was looking for a bride that would make him their headship the union has already taken place uh the union get limited taking place what it [Music] they that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god his son defeats the jew not the church you go to not the pastor or the preacher you got ooh somebody help me here you see nothing between my soul and my savior the way it must be between me and my savior [Music] no priesthood so when you see the pentecostal set up come forward today oh y'all going to get fired up a little bit we say we're not catholics but we have the same order shows no that will blind you god the word jesus christ [Music] and i hate to say it like this but i'm going to say it came between adam and his wife hallelujah we've got to share ourselves from all that nonsense no therefore they caught two secret nonsense hallelujah amen i'm going to honor my god before i honor enemies i i still think it's wrong i really think it's wrong when people said grab the preacher's bibles what but i thought you got god man why are you passing this with somebody y'all don't get quiet it's so many things i can go down the line as an individual traditions [Music] hallelujah how many people told you guys don't y'all go to america come here but you felt y'all heard i don't know but being led by god is very very very important to the believer [Music] [Applause] jesus himself says jesus christ i have need i have a need to go by samaria he broke church order inaudible hallelujah amen what who who preached that the other sunday can you have a pleasure so many pharisees in the church [Music] they don't even know we're being saved by grace [Music] jesus said you hold the truth in unrighteousness hallelujah he said you won't go in but you're standing at the door and you won't let others come in but they tore the house down [Music] into all truths [Music] jesus but when faith is a revelation [Music] it moves you in a way come on somebody he's when god moves the bride of jesus christ let me tell you something listen for this your carnal friends are not going to understand what refresh is [Music] the great spirit jewellery can't speak in the beginning before there was a beginning in the beginning he was god and did you know hey you were in him i received that i may not understand this i received [Music] you were [Music] the whole godhead bodily shaped up into the person of jesus christ that's why john could not be a part of a system that's why jesus could not be a part of us [Music] with all their complaints all their criticism hallelujah mary walked in marietta understand what i'm saying mary walked in mighty he was a woman one thing about an ill-famed woman comfortable oh man i [Music] why did she run [Music] [Music] the life is now in the seed so when you see i look for you that jesus jesus being a priest a dog being the son of god sacrifice hallelujah it's not what's the outside is not the thing that defiles you yeah not what goes in what you can do y'all understand me oh come on people sometimes we won't let people be free they're foreign we always try to bring them from under the blood he used to be this he used to be that oh yesterday [Music] i'm not waiting i'm part of it you're part of it lord have mercy party now men are coming from it is the writing of the sun oh don't leave it solely 1965. this is left for these little songs if you haven't seen that message [Music] 418. everyone represented there was the living saints that had raptured there was elijah standing there and there stood moses uh [Music] the revealed secret of god was then of life after death we are now alive know some men of evil who were once dead she right at that moment you are resurrected unto life [Music] even that baby knows memphis had a mouth of graves coming back perfect phrase where i need [Music] they tried to seal him in the grave with a roman avec le rome dogma i regularly documented [Music] him just a man uh [Music] can hold your body down because if you have been quicker i'm not talking about this so now they say they say i'm not talking about this nasty [Music] so what are you saying that life in me like now working its way out in a sofa hallelujah you understand me it's working its way out la vie i'm [Music] [Music] [Music] in a little cold shed one morning the seals were broken and i raised with him a new creature he is not even talking about the opening of the seventh seal in the apartment [Music] of hereditary i don't care [Music] you've got the dna of your of your heavenly father that means god when god gives you that the second word it is a conqueror [Music] [Music] our father's from you know where you're going it was so important in uh speaking you know brother bannon's message was so different because he wasn't carrying his own message he had a message from the father and that message came in a way that the language that only the those who are elected will hear everything you look crazy this morning saying things that like you know you are gods you look crazy this morning with some blood pressures like you are gods uh [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] and he goes on to say hey continue everybody that brings an accusation she can care about this accusation luke 11 through one through thirteen okay i'm a junkie when it comes to the anointing so that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his discipleship [Music] and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in earth so in heaven give us this day give us day by day our daily and forgive us of our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. you know it's equivalent to matthew 28 19. the same scripture let me make it to you with no understanding repetition as if god commanded us to do it come see no recommended affair where is it in the scripture did paul ever tell us to quote it you understand me it came by way of tradition just like just like wearing a cross like a tradition where water saves you if i get baptized okay okay in the name of jesus christ not necessarily because your salvation is based upon your heart conditions you can be baptized every day in the name of jesus christ hallelujah and you know brother branham said it like this if people would probably repent see with me god will fill them with the holy ghost it's literally with it let's please you're holy son hallelujah amen but look what he says thy kingdom come in vienna so you'll be in heaven kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven what is jesus praying to pray the prayer that the restoration restoration of god did you in man suffer as it is in heaven [Music] hallelujah amen is that all right that's it correct you know for when i was a boy when i wish to pray give us this day our daily break that's not what he's talking about he's talking about revelation i am the prayer of the life he says hallelujah the church is built upon revelations revelation don't worry about revelation [Music] here hallelujah amen oh lord but here's the clincher forgive us our sins we we won't forgive [Music] if you [Music] everybody want to be forgiven [Music] he said that this is a second come on what difference does it make to you yeah the first love for faith the bible said beware when men speak highly of you you don't need nobody [Music] [Music] god uses that for you for me oh lord let me say it like this and you've heard me say it before not want to get there heaven [Music] [Music] hallelujah let me say just paraphrase what i wanted to say to this prayer separate ourselves from the world with you [Music] through us will your will be carried out in this world scripture all right and grant others who have failed to repent in our trials give us wisdom not to be taken unawares [Music] [Music] remember i think it was in alabama or mississippi wherever it was wherever it was about the time it was a time of segregation and there was a colored girl black girl who who was blind yeah they said uh said petite and they forbid brother to go pray for her yeah brother you can cause a riot here hey y'all remember that he said you could cause a riot in here was that liv girl before you uh you know come to the whites alley pierre said that is that right amen but the statement that really gripped brother branham say because if i can find him perhaps he can pray for me i'll find my daddy myself [Music] [Music] heavenly places and i i gotta move on you should continue to please california almost done give me two more hours tell me about this i know some of y'all just got off from work so i'm trying to take it for somebody one brother told me brother brooks you just stretched it out too long you just stretched an outstanding thing that when the book was open i can't help but think how it must have been in the garden of eden if there was a tree in the wrong place he was the authority of that day he was so con listen what i'm trying to tell you is the holy ghost is in you you need to connect with the god that's in your connectivity in your heart um [Music] [Music] and where was the father the bible said in him the fullness of the godhead divinity [Music] you know sometimes we think before the person that if we kneel before a picture of brother branham no stones i'm sorry no stones but it's the truth it's god in you see jesus you know in that day [Music] [Music] is [Music] i'm [Music] like i talked y'all didn't say nothing bad when i say luther couldn't do nothing the wrestling age can't do nothing [Music] this is the invisible union of the problem hallelujah it was the holy ghost that brought us to him now the sentence we can use it funny oh come on somebody and she becomes one with isaac riding the camel or in the tent with excuse me y'all quiet it was in the tent with isaac okay i i feel y'all putting brakes on me now but i'm gonna tell you something think about what i just said i didn't take away from the holy ghost because i brought you to the man who sent the holy ghost [Music] amen and while she was in the tent with isaac she was no longer saying no and exactly i think eliezer was so great [Music] isaac was whispering secrets this man who was supposed to be a christian said don't be the veteran carried some kind of statue with him and he said well if this don't work i think the fire or something he said what this will but let me tell you like this there's a lot of message people who are idolaters and don't even know they don't even know it you know and as soon as you try to help him [Music] but there are some of us who steal yeah i'm not even catching what brother branham told us to catch he says this man passed against him himself he was introducing jesus christ he did just what john the baptist did they can come here to jesus christ [Music] amen the bible says and i'm closing the people know ye not that you are the temple of god hello come on it ain't the church you go to the public you are the temple let me go on down to this and i'm gonna close [Music] why because they were using his temple for the wrong and they can just drive and they find cars and everything else [Music] y'all hear what i'm saying a preacher should never live higher than his people if his people power he should live paul if he's preaching if his people rich he can live rich that's [Music] even the prophet god said it like this he said how is it in the new testament church now [Music] don't tell mr truth i have to be careful let me probably have to be careful because i can do the hollywood thing basketball should show us the hollywood i can do it i've come through it it's just faith i was an apostolic preacher listen have you ever seen one on tv and if i go somewhere and and you know it calls for an evangelistic type of preaching evangelist uh [Music] they had you are the musicians uh who was it natural that's why i made something i'm telling you some plan of some altos listen equity when they were hiding from the romans the early church do you say do you think that bring all your instruments [Music] they knew how to reverse and sing in a way that the anointing would just move but they were fire i understand fire don't have to make noise fire can be quiet but there's some fire that would it can't make noise too man but you understand me but traditions make us feel the traditions on face and take up see if the people are not just so emotional and all i get is a wall then i know nobody's pulling and and uh to a saints house on they were breaking tradition did you all know that yes they were breaking tradition because under the law they couldn't pray like this priesthood could pray only the priesthood they only they were the ones who handled the lambs without all the ceremonies [Music] [Music] the people gathering their confidence was in the people gathering yeah yeah yeah no yeah first of all she was praying without him remember she didn't go by the way of the priest she had her own prayer meeting you understand me and so god honored her and somehow levi eli caught her attention she caught eli's attention and the guy who was supposed to be the priest more than likely hadn't seen the spirit move in so long he thought she would draw [Music] and i've got something weighing heavy on me i need god to answer this prayer hallelujah yeah you understand me uh why god use a woman she represents the bride fascinating and she she went to god in prayer alone and let her deliver you and prayer god answered her prayers and gave her a prophecy i guess this is what they call drawing it out it's your past secondly but i'll always think about that woman with the issue of blood vegeta what what was it that the priest couldn't help them they had the ability to heal you know through sacrifices or travel sacrifices but she knew the priest in that area couldn't heal her man all those years she was sick she wasn't dead hallelujah but when she heard about jesus let me tell you something everything this message it's a message it's the only thing that can heal [Music] will give you an issue of blood vapor don't need it y'all understand me no power in it but there's only power in the blind [Music] is [Music] my i couldn't find the parents and i couldn't find him in trouble so god's grace was on that little fella's heart man my precious brother went out and bought me a tambourine because i know people don't have to be kind to you have you ever walked by somebody says how are you doing here you are and maybe they didn't hear you they could be thinking about something else but you get your little feelings hurt [Music] or they're not going to speak to me who's what in the past and when they don't speak they see in a pamper then i know it wasn't accidental you understand me because the bible tells us to speak not only to your neighbors my son was with me one day say daddy you speak to everybody i say i'm supposed to you know god bless you however you want to say but anyway let me close listen what the hell is like so when he whipped them all out of the temple countries one thing that's stuck in my heart in my mind my house shall be called nothing but the [Music] i am [Music] if [Music] don't let the devil fight your mind i just want don't forget memos first of all to be honest with you they should never have to say don't forget you understand me let's go complaining oh oh i forgot to go to work no you don't oh joe hello it's the importance of when you put your food [Music] [Music] because it's all about helping others who's listening university in moments like these i'll sing out a song i'll sing out a love song to jesus [Music] in moments like thee i lift up my hand i lift [Music] singing singing [Music] [Music] to jesus [Music] singing [Music] ah [Music] oh [Music] let us pray for your son [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] you [Music] like this [Music] um
