[27:37] apocalypse
[27:47] every creature

[29:07] controller of all things
[29:10] you know the number of breaths that we

[29:42] amen amen amen you may be seated
[29:49] it's been a long while since I've been
[29:51] here
[30:00] it is very important now
[30:03] we begin to really see who we are they
[30:06] call myself
[30:08] I had a lot of things that I would like
[30:11] to speak
[30:14] I thought that I'd give you a Word of
[30:16] Faith this morning
[30:21] we are in a a dilemma but some dancing
[30:26] dilemma we are in a position the
[30:28] sometimes in position where we must be
[30:31] proven
[30:32] we must be tested and we must be tried
[30:38] but uh
[30:40] before we come to be a
[30:46] Victorian we must first understand
[30:50] that the battle has been fought
[30:54] because she is already one
[30:58] party we must understand the God that we
[31:02] worship
[31:05] and the god that we worship is the only
[31:07] true and living God
[31:13] he has been time tested and proven
[31:19] to be the almighty God
[31:24] we must understand
[31:27] that we're not working with something
[31:30] primitive
[31:32] primitive about the God that we serve
[31:36] is Almighty
[31:40] and there is no weapon
[31:44] that can destroy him
[31:48] no man-made a weaponry
[31:52] okay
[31:54] can destroy his people
[31:59] we must understand
[32:01] without even having a battle okay
[32:06] God has made us Victors
[32:10] hallelujah amen listen when and the lamb
[32:15] took the book
[32:17] came forth as the Mighty conqueror
[32:23] at that same lamb is
[32:28] still in power
[32:32] the blood
[32:35] blood power understand
[32:49] can only be
[32:52] asts
[32:53] and experience
[32:55] by those who are truly Believers
[33:00] you can't be a make-believer
[33:07] s of this decision
[33:10] you and I must understand
[33:13] but through this message
[33:16] it has come to declare United declaring
[33:21] that Satan is powerless
[33:24] when the mighty angels
[33:27] and stood there on the land in the sea
[33:30] he said
[33:32] declaring that time would be no more
[33:36] amen it was Christ who was gaining the
[33:41] victory Victoria claiming the victory
[33:45] for you and I
[33:47] hallelujah amen no matter what Satan
[33:51] does
[33:52] we must come to understand
[33:56] amen that we could never lose
[33:59] we always come out as a winner
[34:04] the Bible says no weapon against me
[34:10] [Music]
[34:14] no lying vanities
[34:23] the destiny
[34:27] of God
[34:33] but we have come to be tried and tested
[34:40] and God is tired if I could say it like
[34:43] this let's put it this way God wants to
[34:47] see
[34:48] True Believers and actions
[34:52] it's not enough to quote William
[34:55] Brothers
[34:56] if you're not going to take the quotes
[35:11] amen only those who can believe
[35:20] amen is that the word the Bible said No
[35:24] weapons
[35:29] and every tongue is that shall rise
[35:33] against
[35:38] shall condemn
[35:41] ation hallelujah amen this is the
[35:44] heritage
[35:45] of the Servants of the Lord
[35:49] amen do you understand
[35:52] it is something that you have inherited
[35:58] you didn't have to buy it
[36:03] you still have to steal it
[36:06] it was given
[36:10] in other words you were born richness
[36:16] you were born wealthy was that name you
[36:20] you want into a royal family
[36:24] you were born
[36:35] into this inheritance foreign
[37:18] [Music]
[37:23] I want you to remind him
[37:27] not that he forgets but God wants to
[37:31] hear it out of your mouth
[37:33] see it doesn't matter how much people
[37:35] pray for you yeah
[37:42] it doesn't matter how many times people
[37:46] pray for you
[37:48] must come out of your mind
[37:53] is that right that's a correct
[37:55] hallelujah amen evening you think about
[37:58] it
[38:00] even when the
[38:03] window
[38:05] into the lion
[38:07] he said that
[38:11] he said
[38:12] [Music]
[38:19] Hallelujah they were put under pressure
[38:28] is it god Jehovah
[38:32] God answers your prayers
[38:37] [Music]
[38:40] because when you belong to Jesus
[38:43] Jesus
[38:47] he will come to your rescue
[38:50] hallelujah amen amen under that pressure
[38:54] they said
[38:56] [Music]
[39:08] more than
[39:09] [Music]
[39:17] he said if I pray for
[39:21] Japan
[39:28] [Music]
[39:30] don't you understand
[39:33] come of a situation
[39:35] does it determine your faith
[39:40] you can have faith and God will still
[39:44] say no
[39:46] but we don't like no for the answer
[39:51] that's why Jesus says
[39:56] amen
[40:09] God has to prove to me
[40:11] the answer is
[40:16] coming from the message
[40:19] possessing the enemy's Gates
[40:22] brother Brandon said like this and even
[40:25] in a Strange Land remember he had
[40:28] purposed in his heart

[41:00] you know when you say oh Lord

[42:46] you are
[42:48] if you see yourself doing more evil than
[42:51] good foreign

[43:37] [Music]
[43:44] but he really wasn't ready to surrender
[43:48] all to God
[43:50] hallelujah see in this way
[43:58] Jesus said sell all that your hands
[44:01] follow me

[44:07] know
[44:11] and religion is just a covering
[44:15] Hallelujah but I want salvation
