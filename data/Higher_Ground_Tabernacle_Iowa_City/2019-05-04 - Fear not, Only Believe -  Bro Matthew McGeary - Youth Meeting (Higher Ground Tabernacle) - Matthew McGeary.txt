it's just what God does amen surely God is good to us we have our brother Matthew McGarry who's speaking for us we had a wonderful time last night amen just prior to his coming we're gonna sing in the blood of Christ my lord in the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there's somebody here that can praise the Lord it's good to be in his person his name he's here you realize that right now but we're sitting in the seat where all things are possible let that sink in for a moment right now we're gathered together in a place where all things are possible maybe you read stories in the Bible about blind eyes being open we read stories about the dead being raised back to life I hear stories about withered arms being made straight again I want to declare to you the gospel of Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's here to meet your knee maybe you've been believing for somebody somebody else may maybe you have something that's been on your heart the Masters here he has come and you know that the world looks at grandeur it looks at glitter and fancy programs but it's little humble places like this where Jesus comes [Music] you know before the world ever formed I want you to catch this now before the world was ever formed he knew that we would be in this place tonight and if he knew you would be here then he have something for you you know whenever Jesus came it was never the same Jesus just didn't come with no agenda he didn't come with no purpose but when Jesus came he come to perform something he said I do nothing but look what the father shows me to do he said I must go by Samaria he said I must go this way and tonight the Lord Jesus says I must come here because I have my bride that's gathered together they've been praying and they've been faithful and I've come tonight to prove to them I'm the same yesterday today and forever let's just approach the Lord and pray our Heavenly Father how we love you and we thank you for the victory that you have wrought in our life Lord to know that when you spread your arms there on Calvary and you said it is finished Lord we're still trying to grasp the revelation what truly that means the Lord with the little understanding and the unfolding revelation that you've given us Lord we thank you for it we thank you that you paid the price for our sins and that you've forgiven us Lord and that we could come and be gathered together and just be able to worship the Lord in spirit and in truth we're not because of anything that we've done Lord but by your grace but if every one that's gathered Lord we could say it's by grace how we thank you for your grace Lord let us never lose sight of Calvary Lord not let us never think that were somebody or we deserved it but what may we out there we always know it's by your divine grace that you imparted to us and for that Lord we give you our lives that's why we serve you Lord that's why we've come tonight they haven't come to be seen of man we haven't done with some agenda but we come because we love you Lord Lord as I heard the prophets say one time he said I'm tired week my toes are bunched up in my shoes I can't sleep I can barely talk oh it was love that drove me to do Lord and we're driven by the same love that you've given in our hearts Lord a baby shed abroad one to another oh we commit the service to you we thank you for this and the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ really looks just turn in our Bibles a man it's good to be in the presence of the Lord I mean once again we're just humbled by the invitation of her brother Isaiah Brooks to be here and we we never take it lightly when we step in front of the bright Jesus Christ and I just want to let you know I'm humbled to be in your presence to think that you're the redeemed purchased the reason why Jesus Christ went to Calvary was for you he paid the price for you and so I believe any minister of the gospel never takes it lightly that the words that we speak to the bride of Jesus Christ we we want those words to be his words so we want to yield our vessel to him and we're just thankful for that a man praise the Lord we bring you greetings from our Pastor David McGarry there and the Dallas Fort Worth area and many of the Saints they send their love and greetings to you see you make it down a man we're just good to be here each one of you if we'll turn in our Bibles to Luke chapter eight and maybe just as a place to launch from tonight we spoke a little last night on fear not only believe a man Luke chapter 8 verse 49 says while yet spake spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house saying to him my daughter is dead trouble not the master but when Jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made whole maybe let's just approach the Lord one more time Heavenly Father we've read your word we thank you for it now we surrender ourselves to you that you might have the preeminence Lord and speak words of life to your people we pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen you may be seated man we also read from a second Timothy 1:7 it says for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind and you know as I thought on those things for God hath not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind it struck me as we read these scriptures jesus said fear not only believe and fear is something that has a lot of effect on the believers life whether we like that or not but many times we we fear or were afraid or we draw back when God has given us his word and we start to reason or we start to doubt and I'm reminded of of Peter on the water where when Jesus come and he said it is I be not afraid he said if it's you Lord bidden me to come you know and as long as he kept his eyes on Christ and as long as he was looking at him as long as he was looking at the word he started to walk and he started to walk on the water but as soon as he got his eyes off of Christ and he started to look at the situation's around him and he started to maybe reasoned like you know what man's not supposed to be able to walk on water and maybe we look at the promises of God say well maybe I'm not the one that could lay my hands on the dead and they raised her life well we start to look at the promises of God and then we start to reason within ourselves and look at our inabilities or our weaknesses and we think it's not for us and we shrink back and so what the word is going for tonight is fear not only belief all things are possible the Prophet said there's only two faculties that government governor human and one of them is faith which brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all faith is of God is of the devil fear makes you weary and fear makes you wonder and we we know that the way that the enemy works just like he attacked even the Garden of Eden he always wants to show his little lies of discrepancy he wants to show is little lies of deceit and that's always his way of doing it how he wants it in part fear and tear is it just little white lies he wants to cause doubt he wants you to doubt the Word of God and he wants you not to stand upon the promises and that he's given us but the scripture says he hasn't given you a spirit of fear but he's given you a spirit of power you know we are a people that we have a spirit of power and that is something that is available to you and we don't want to see the church on weak we don't want to see the church's going through day by day under a spirit of fear no power in their life and Oh victory life but God has given you a spirit of power he's giving you his life not just to sit there like a bump on the log but he wants you to manifest the very life that Jesus Christ manifested look this isn't some dead religion this isn't a dead gospel but he's the same yesterday today and forever and he said the works that I do the same works you shall do we want to embrace that we want to have a boldness and say Lord I'll be it unto me according to thy word but you know no text one came to giorious and told him you know don't trouble the master your daughter is already dead and you could imagine how his heart would have been failing him you know many times we get to that place and what we're gonna do it seems like all hope is gone and we just don't know what to do but that's what I love about the Word of God is if you can just stand upon the Word of God if faith can just rest right there there came a voice to giorious and Jesus said fear not oh please and that word is the same word for you tonight fear not only believe I know what you're going through I know that I know the heartache I know the hard decisions I know you got turned down from your job I know you lost your job so you can't pay the bills but okay there these trials and these frictions it's just for them I mean it's just temporary it's not worthy to be compared with the glory that he has in store for you so now with that in mind okay Lord this is your will for my eyes if this is the cross I have to bear the suffering I have to bear oh just stand upon his word cuz you know if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved Oh hallelujah there's already one waiting for you hallelujah one of these days we're gonna step right out of here into eternity oh and all these trials and all the tribulations Oh there'll be a thing of the past for a moment Church fear not only believe hallelujah writing that crucial moment Jesus gave him the words that he needed to hear we know the Word of God is it's quick its oh it's sharper than any two-edged sword you know the words a discerner of the font in 10th of the heart and so if you have a need the word discerns what you're going through it knows where you're at in your life and if you have an open heart and you're willing to receive the word is coming for you it's coming for you it's looking for you looki you can't hide from it if you're a son or daughter of God it's gonna search you out it's gonna find you you can run from it all you want to run but you can't get away Jonah tried that one time he received a word from the Lord and he said you know what I'm not ready for it many times we feel like that we're not ready for it but you know what's gonna happen if you don't surrender your head to God oh you're gonna make a decision you're gonna start going the wrong way you're gonna be going to wet from the divine will that God had wanted you to do and you're gonna get up on there on life's oceans and then also those storms gonna come across and everything's gonna just start breaking up and what a Jonah do jonah knew it and you know so many times we get into places in a we just if we just humble ourselves you know sometimes that's the hardest reliever to do is humble themselves and just say you know what I'm wrong we got so much pride inside of us we think that was somebody you know people will sit in the church about demonic spirit because of their pride when they could just make a few steps up to the altar and be delivered of pornography to be delivered from lust I'll be delivered from alcohol I'll be delivered from all of these spirits that bind you but pride will hold you right there maybe everything in ups in your life will talk buttoned up you're looking pretty good but you know God's interested in all of your heart he wants all of you he didn't come for a part of you he wants all of it and he made a way for you he made a way for yours you have to accept it but so many times we don't want to humble ourselves oh we got too much pride and sadness we can't just walk up and say you know what I'm wrong Lord I need help you realize that's why he came he didn't come for people that didn't need help he came for people that needed help is there somebody here that needs help oh I know Jesus is coming tonight for you I'll praise the Lord hallelujah you know as I was thinking about that the word being sharper than any two-edged sword there's a story in the Bible about the king of Syria and he's making war with Israel and so he he he's making his little plans and preparations and and and you know Israel every time he SATs sets up his trap Israel goes the other way and the king of Syria starts to think you know what there's a rat amongst us somebody is going and sneaking off over to Israel and telling them and tipping them off of our every move you know one of the servants there was like hold wait a second no you got it all wrong King you realize there's a profit over there and he knows the very words that you're spinning your bedroom you know that God knows every thought that you're thinking but see Satan tries to turn that right around and condemn you he puts the thought in your in your mind and then condemns you for it when the word goes forth or says God knows every thought that you're thinking of you're like oh my goodness I'm so ashamed I should have never done that you know he's the kind of guy that will talk to you robbing the bank and call the cops on you you know that's the devil he's the one that done it but see Jesus shed his blood that you could be set free from that you just claim the blood don't listen to his reasoning don't listen to his I also hear this king of Syria he this servant tells him that and look at the ignorance of this guy so he decides to set up a trap and go get him and say were you not hearing what I just told you he's gonna know they coming to get him but nonetheless the story goes and and and I believe it's the the army of Syria comes down Elijah standing there and a servant comes out and there's a host and kept against them and the servants like my goodness a master we're in trouble and the Prophet comes out looks around and this servants he's like what are we gonna I don't know what I'm gonna do I'm fearful it looks like they're gonna take her life Master what should we do and he's like don't fear you got nothing to fear about there's more with us then are against us and in his carnal mind here the servants looking at why I know this is a man of God but I can do math pretty good that's our problem any times we can do math pretty good we looked at the colonel we add it all up and we and we are we think that look if you're depending on your ability to pay your bills you're selling yourself short if you're depending on your abilities to pay your bills you're selling your self short because we have a father owns a cattle on a Thousand Hills and if you're depending on yourself you're gonna be disappointed all but when you start relying on him when you start putting your trust and your hope in him he's gonna take care of every need you had made up I never seen the righteous forsaken never seen them begging bread you just put all your faith and all of your trust in him and he's gonna take care of you it's just how many times we need we need some something supernatural to take place we need the Word of God to strike that predestinated seed on the inside you know that's supernatural that's only an ability that supernatural people possess is an ability for the word of God to strike a predestinated seat on the inside and what does it do it quickens it to life something happens power comes forth and it starts to grow and it starts to grow in the stature of a perfect man and that's that manifests the fruits of Jesus Christ oh my what a beautiful thing God has done for you that he placed that seat of God inside of you and he put everything that you ever had an eater on the inside of it and he sipped his word to reveal to you that you are a son of God that you are a daughter of God don't fear little flock it's my father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom you can't miss it don't want to have already paid the price it was finished on Calvary you won't fall short because I've made sure in myself that you can't lose you can't fall you can't not make it that's the kind of God we serve and hear this this servant standing there like man is not quite adding up to me not quite adding up to me it looks like there's a lot more here and what does the public say Lord open his eyes and I say if God could just open our eyes to the revealed word tonight Oh God give me a revelation this church is founded upon revelation and something we ought to pray for more than we've ever prayed for before is revelry we want prevailing revelation look we're in the end time it's not getting any easier it's only going to get harder and we want to take advantage of these opportunities we have now to be gathered together with our brothers and sisters of precious like faith as the scripture says gather yourselves together more often as you see that day approaching but it seems more than ever before the Satan's getting us all bound up with all of our responsibilities of work and school and family that we find no time for the house of God we find time for the things of God we find ourselves online and on the internet and paying attention to the news maybe not even a quarter of the time we spend in prayer and I can be ashamed myself and I say Oh God let me give you my life Lord let me find myself in the prayer closet let me find you in your presence all hallelujah the scripture says that he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's not just out anywhere come on that's in heavenly places the Prophet said that if I'm prayed up and that's you're prayed up oh we can be caught up in a heavenly atmosphere that's where we want to live as a believer in a heavenly atmosphere and in that place all things are possible to them believe oh praise the Lord hallelujah we just want God to open our eyes and give us more revelation prevailing revelation I love how you look at how God just and his perfection did it when when Jesus asked Peter who do you say that I am he said well some say you're this but he got down the hard no matter who do you say that I am he said how art the Christ the Son of the Living God and he said flesh and blood have not revealed that to you you realize that what he's saying is that all time you've spent with me because others have done it to think of a message or in the prophet in this day many men spent time with the messenger that they went hunting with them they sat in the meetings and they saw Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he stood there night after night and said if Jesus Christ was here he would do the same things that he did and he said he said it over and over and over but just like them Jews there was a veil over the eyes they couldn't see it but all to that predestinated seed oh say old wall open my eyes are also available comes across and you see the Lord Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever revealed in the Ministry of a son of man what was it to do to come and catch your breath say it wasn't it wasn't flesh and blood that revealed it if you try to understand this message intellectually you won't be able to do it and I have found today more than ever men are trying to make sense of all the quotes look if you try to take the paradox out of the message you'll take the bride right out of it too because I want to tell you the brides are paradox you can't understand this miss grace you can't understand this Miss Jesus Christ and you won't understand it because a lot of these days a moment in a twinkling of an eye she'll be gone but when you try to explain it away if it's not my faith if you try to catch it with your mental conception and sometimes you know as believers there's things in the word we hear that are hard and we can't make sense of look but the word doesn't make any mistakes and so many times we hear the prophets say something over here and we hear him saying something over here and we think he made a mistake or he just didn't mean that no no we're just lacking revelation pray that the God would reveal it to you so many times we sell God short and and we and we allow our thinking to get him in the way of of the manifestation of Malachi 4 that it was the voice of God to you some people take that on the other side and they try to make him God it's a personal relationship between you and Jesus Christ don't worry about what everybody else is saying don't worry about what everybody else was doing and he say Lord I hear a lot of stuff being said but just as you revealed to Peter who Jesus Christ is Lord reveal this message to me we get so dependent upon men's explanations and men's ideas that we run here and we run there and we wonder why we're tossed to and fro because we haven't gotten on our knees and we've ignored that the inheritance that has been given to the believer that you can get on your knees and if you have need of something you have not because you ask not and ask the Heavenly Father to reveal it to you and it's the same thing that happened to Peter that revelation will come to you and it won't be my flesh and blood look if it's my flesh and blood flesh and blood can take it away from you flesh and blood can talk you out this way and flesh and blood can talk you out that way but when you catch the revelation I'll bring all the flesh and blood in the world I don't scare me none why because I know who I am I know where it came from I'm all where I'm going and I fix my hope and all my trust in the revealed Word of God glory fear not only belief as I thought on this sphere just to maybe look at this a little bit while longer as I was thinking of that my my cousin she was shot in a school shooting she was was the first reported school shooting that had ever happened in the United States there was two killed a wounded thankful to the Lord my cousin wasn't killed but she was wounded the principal was killed the janitor was killed and eight other students at the Elementary School were were shot and I remember when we would we would go over to their house and years would have passed on from this but we wanted to be sensitive of slamming doors we wanted to be sensitive to loud noises because that is that event had impacted her so much in her life that if she would hear a loud bang or if she would hear a balloon pop or if she would hear a door slam it would actually strike fear into her and that she was no longer in control of the moment anymore she was no longer comfortable no matter where she was the whole atmosphere change and fear had taken over her heart and there's things that happen in our lives when were children and things that we go through when were growing up that that hang in there and we never even realized that the reason that we have about maybe mistrust or distrust or we're having a hard time receiving something from the word or we're having a hard time in our relationships it's because of things that you've gone through in the past and you know I've heard it may be said like this before some people feel like well you know just get over that you know gods already taking care of that just get over that but we never want to belittle the trials and all hardships that people go through in their life because these are deep wounds and deep scars and and by God's grace and the Holy Spirit he can deal with you and reveal to you in your heart if you've been going through something in your life and you've never been able to figure out why you just can't make it past this Lord why can I never seem to go all the way with you Lorna how come whenever I take you at your promised word I always seem to come up short Wow how come Lord I know I've never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know what we want God to do is reveal to you the profits that you can have something in your life and unconfessed sin and a spirit will stay right there and it won't go anywhere you can bathe them in oil and pray over them and that devil will sit right there because he has a right to but it's the grace of God that will come to you and reveal to where you're lacking review - in your life where you're coming up short reveal to you where you've been hurt and the things that you have gone through in your past and you'll start to do something in you that's supernatural and that word will come forth to you and start to deliver you and start to heal you and start to take care of you why because that's the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ why so many people go through hardships they go through turmoil they lose loved ones and they die from cancer and sickness and news children in the war and car wrecks and they're shot on the street and babies die and all this pain and suffering that is in the world one would come to say like my grandma used to say all the time she says life is hard hard hard hard hard and I would say life is hard and and if we didn't have the hope of Jesus Christ oh my how miserable would we be and I've talked to people who have gone through some extremely hard trials and and I always ask them are you a Christian because I couldn't imagine going through that type of heartache going through those type of trials and not having Jesus Christ Oh am I not having Jesus Christ to be able to be your comfort I love the scripture it says if I go away I will send you the comforter well thank God for the comforter I've been in too many trials and I've been in a minute of hard places and I still thank God for the comforter that he would come to you and he can even be I easy sits closer than a brother when it seems like everybody's forsaken you and everybody that's close to you and everybody has turned their back on you all the Lord Jesus Christ he'll never turn his back on you the prophet of God said it's when you get discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you you watch that when you start getting discouraged and you feel like you're getting depressed that's when the devil are really poured on you and the Prophet knows what he's talking about the Prophet went through very very hard hard trials and one of them that sticks out most - especially all of us is where he had been working Arden and the floods had come in and he'd been out on the water and and his wife had gotten sick and and a hope she passed away and and and here she is in the morgue and he gets a call brother Brandon gets a call says now it's your baby baby girl and so brother Branham comes to the hospital and now he's holding his little Sharon Rose and he's looking at her and he describes and have a little fat on her leg is quivering back and forth and she's shaking from muscle spasms her and her eyes are crossed in her head and her life is going from her in the profits looking at this he said by my wife's laying over there and the mother and now my baby girl has been taken from me and it was in that moment that the devil started to pour it on and the Prophet said the devil couldn't come to him and tell him that God was a real come way too late for that he knew he was real but we said what the devil was able to tell him was that God didn't love him and he say you you standing here and preaching the gospel all these years and you're giving your life for this gospel and this is how God's gonna treat you and he started saying your brother died and your daddy died and and this has happened and that's happened and now your wife and now your baby girl and he makes a profound statement he says everything the devil was showed it was true and then he added that little seed of discrepancy there it said God really doesn't love you serious it was in that time of discouragement that the devil really starts to pour it on and you want to make sure you know where you're standing you want to make sure you know him who you have believed like Joe when he had lost everything and his whole family had been taken away from him and there his wife came into him said why don't you just curse God and die oh my job was going through the hardest trial in his life and they're in that trial and it seemed like all hope was gone and he seemed like maybe he would give up all the lightning was flashing and all sudden of a revelation shrunk oh my if I die although the skin worms eat my flesh yet in my flesh shall see God and we want to have that kind of revelation that we know that we know that we know that we've met Jesus Christ and we pass from death to eternal life then no matter what storms no matter what trials come our way we know we're safe and secure in the bosom of Jesus Christ praise the Lord it has to be a revelation your mind won't keep you your mind don't fail you I tell you what it's the grace of God I don't know about any of you but I've gotten to a place where my mind I feel like I'm going insane but all thank God there's an anchor thank god there's a deep inside they're calling to her deep thank god there's a sixth sense that when when the five senses of this flesh couldn't keep me there was something greater there was faith in God's Word there was grace - it made me make it through the trial oh the name of the Lord is a strong tower that the righteous run into it we're thankful for the blood if somebody here hasn't come to know the grace of Jesus Christ if you haven't applied the blood to your heart you know that little story there and in the Old Testament and the Exodus you're one of the plagues was that death angel coming and that death angel was going to pass you imagine being the firstborn in that home so Daddy is the blood applied daddy are you sure because if it's not I'm gonna die you know that's a real that should be a sobering message to each one of us that our days are numbered on this earth and if you haven't applied the blood that the death angels can't and we want to make sure that we've bled the blood of Jesus Christ and asked him to forgive us of our sins because if we don't do that and you haven't claimed that atoning power of the blood that day is coming and you don't want to be found that day without the blood the Prophet says why and why are people so tossed about the Christian faith is based solidly upon rest that's right a Christian is not tossed about a Christian doesn't run from place to place a Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a Christian rest it's all over it was all finished for the believer at Calvary oh thank God for Calvary my I just feel like I ain't here in Calvary preached too much in the churches but there at Calvary I'm thankful for Calvary well it was there that my sins were forgiven it was there that he took all of my sin and shame upon his back was that Calvary well thank God for Calvary just as John said and of Moses as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life all sickness may come to you my disappointments may come to you hard trials might come to you all but faith keeps you faith and what God has done in faith in the spoken word and faith in Calvary oh my it'll take care of you just stay right there and stand upon the word and fear not only believe all just let us hold fast to the profession of our faith without wavering for he that promised is faithful one thing I like about faith is it puts you into action faith puts you into action Abraham the father of our faith I believe it's in Genesis chapter 12 he finds them in and God just speaks to Abraham it says Abraham depart from here you don't see them fussing and fighting and trying to to figure it all out but know that of God came to that predestinated see him and put him in action I say Oh God put me in action but let us hold fast to the profession of our faith without wavering well what do we have to fear search what shall separate us from the love of God can't can't can't can your job can your friends can your sickness nothing can separate you from the love of God Roma says for I am persuaded are you persuaded tonight and there's somebody that's persuaded in the grace of God hallelujah I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Jesus Christ our Lord were at rest Church the anchor holds that's faith final resting places the Word of God hallelujah well the Prophet said he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this last age we talked last night about Jesus Christ coming to the grave of Lazarus and say Lazarus come forth you realize when this message came when Malachi 4:5 came and Luke 17:30 come in this last day and as that word went forth God had already prepared you just as that word came forth from jesus to lazarus to come forth he didn't ask him he didn't say oh when would you like to well know that word of God went forth and call for that son of God to come forth and just like you God had prepared your heart before the foundation of the world that when that message came and he said come out of her my people something as sorry you just was drawn to it and all of a sudden you were quickened alive life started putting one foot in front of the other and he started to come out of all the denominational systems he started to come out of all that darkness and all that gloom and into the marvelous light of the gospel why because God had prepared you before the foundation of the world with that ability to respond to the Word of God Amen let's turn in our Bibles to 2nd Kings chapter 5 2nd Kings chapter 5 verse 9 says so naman came with his horses and with his chariots and stood at the door of the house of Elijah Elisha sent messengers unto him saying go and wash in the Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean but naman was wroth and went away and said behold I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call in the name of the Lord his God and strike his hands over the place and recover the leper or not Gabanna and and far part rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel may I not washing them and be clean so he turned away and went in a rage and his servant came near unto NIR and spake on him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it how much rather then when he saith unto the wash and be clean then went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again like under the flesh of a little child and was clean and I just want to say that God has a provided way for the believer and his way is his word and the Prophet said the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass and as believers we must have the right approach to the Word of God and if you look at the word here what stuck out to me here is naimans response in verse 11 it says but name and was laughs I went away and said said behold I thought that's where we get ourselves in all the trouble right there is I thought there is the trouble neighbor was mad because it didn't happen the way he wanted to you know it's sad as mature Christians that we can find ourselves in the same place as naman oh we pray and we ask God to do certain things and when it doesn't happen the way we thought it should we pout about it but uh God's God's not sitting up there and it's just wondering oh my goodness I wonder how I'm gonna make everything work out today we're the ones that get fearful were the ones that are troubled were the ones that are worrying he has it all under control i if you have done your part and you've prayed and you've laid it before the Lord and you've done all you I know to do rest that's thank God that's in a bad that's a promise to the believer just rest look I'll tell you an amazing thing in the adoption series when brother Branham preaches he preaches adoption and and in the very beginning of the message he tells the story before he even starts he tells the story about going beyond the curtain of time I thought how wonderful here he's gonna he's taking us into adoption but before he even ever gets into it he starts to describe out that place that we're going is real and how he went over there and and he saw the loved ones in me and what what comfort that gave to that brokenhearted prophet to be able to go across the curtain of time over there and then what's amazing is at the very end of the first sermon there there's a sister that comes up for prayer and actually I believe she's the last one of brother Brent says well it looks like you're the last one and it's really neat there at the very back he goes now just for a little teaching the crowds maybe have dwindled down and he starts to tell this sister because she's up there she's praying for her sons and her daughters and she's recognized and she's believing the Word of God but her her her babies are out there in the world and she's coming up there and you could hear her crying because she's she's wanting her children to catch the Word of God I want ever and brother Brandon goes all just for a little teaching sister you ever heard about the story of the jailer Paul and Silas were in jail he had he knows and and you know that the the jail started his shaking their chains were loosed and the jailer was about to kill himself he's like yeah he's like and he said fear not don't take my life we're all here and they led him to Jesus Christ what did he tell them he said he said if you believe upon Jesus Christ you and your house shall be saved and the prophet of God said if you have enough faith for salvation you got enough faith for your house look if you've been praying and you've been believing for your loved ones I just want to tell you tonight just rest oh that's the promise that God gave you just rest you put it all in his hands and just rest all the father has given me will come o children of God you can rest tonight because of what God has done for you he has it only control but it's our thinking that gets ourselves in trouble and naming it was mad because it didn't happen the way he wanted to talk the Prophet said that's the reason people miss it they want to get it the way they you want to get it they they want to get the Holy Ghost the way they want to get it they want the revelation to be according to their thinking the way that I thought it was going to be you know people say they have the Holy Ghost and you see in their lives they're not saying Amen to every word of God you know the pastor preaches against address and and preachers holiness and they keep doing it any kind of way they want to the word shows that we shouldn't cut her hair or clip her hair look uncut hairs it's it's that's what long hair is is uncut hair and I'll never forget my I was just amazed and I tell you what I was really amazed by God's grace he kept me contained but I was sitting there and a sister was trying to justify the clipping of her hair and she said well you know the way I said it's just like take take a bunch of girls and line them up and have them altar backwards and you can tell he has long hair and on and I had a I had a bone to pick with that I say you want to tell me that my Blessed African sister who can't grow hair passed here you're gonna try to tell me your hair's longer than hers I said no if she's never put scissor to it or she's caught the revelation and has honored that revelation her hands long in God's eyes but so many times we want to interpret the Word of God with our denominational ways of thinking to appease our own beliefs but we gotta have a revelation we want the word the way God gave it not the way we think it should happen no but if we have the Holy Spirit working in our lives we say amen to every single word of God the Prophet said God when he comes into a person or two persons into a congregation into a man or woman he vindicates his presence Oh hallelujah I said O God vindicate your presence here tonight God vindicate your presence to this people God proves that he's there for when God comes supernatural signs begin to appear this person becomes a changed person they're not no more like they used to be seen as vanished from their life fear and doubt have vanished and frustration they are solid stable live or die it's Christ they don't care what comes or what goes nothing shakes them they move forward Oh God by your grace tonight I want to move forward I let me go on with God away from my own thoughts away from my own thinking the promise that works is faith expressed you know as we're dealing with this place here in scripture about naming you know leprosy is a type of sin don't tell me you got the cure of sin and I can see it all over your face and all over the way you're dressing the way you're talking the way you're carrying on no but if you're having the Spirit of God working in your life you move word you don't make excuses for the sin and unbelief in your life but you you you take God at His Word you say Lord if you said it I believe it I can't make sense of it but being unto me or Jesus and then you start to see that faith working in your life look at Abraham's faith it was accounted to him unto righteousness because God looked at his heart and he counted unto my righteousness because he believed in something that had not happened yet but when James picks it up says you're justified by faith he's talking about that that word having an effect in your life and seeing the results of it is that right and in verse 11 here I just want to pick this up here in a second but namings response to the word if your response to the word is is crucial that can be term in the outcome it's how you respond to the Word of God you know the preacher says this and he says that even even in a service like this the preacher could preach about the Holy Ghost and then all of a sudden the devil goes to start to working in your mind go over there the guy said I don't have the Holy Ghost if you're having those type of thoughts I want to challenge you to what you really have because if you have the Holy Ghost when the word goes forward you say Lord if there's something in my life lacking be it unto me according to thy word oh but when the word goes forth and all of a sudden you're getting mad at the preacher or you're getting mad at the word or you said I just don't quite see it like that and all of a sudden you see bitterness and you see you you pushing back and not receiving the word you want to check up on your life and start to wonder what kind of spirit is upon you because the Spirit of the Holy Ghost says yeah and amen to every word of God I often say if the shoe fits wear it you know if it sounds like the the preachers preaching your exact situation if the shoe fits wear it look I grew up in a pastor's home and yep sometimes the pastor might get inspiration about things that happen in the family but you know what if your heart is right then don't worry about it but if the shoe fits wear it if you think the pastor's talking to you and he's like man he's telling my exact situation I can't believe he would do that if it's the truth believe it but I just want to be right I don't want to be wrong you know if if the word keeps going forth and the part of its for you and then the rest keeps going on you like well you know I'm not struggling with that well praise God but just accept the part that's for you but we always want to push it out on somebody else but look at this here in verse 11 they struck me what is your response to the word we must only believe in verse 11 it says but naman was rough and went away and said behold I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call in the name of his god and strike his hand over the place and recovers the leper I kind of thought it was interesting he spoke to of himself in the third person he says and strike his hand over place and he didn't say me but it struck me you know what we have to do is we have to see ourselves in the word we have to see ourselves as part of the equation just like when that lady come to Jesus and she kept begging unto him he said look it's not meat to give you the children's bread under dogs but you know what's so amazing about faith faith Sola portion in the word for herself and faith agreed with the word faith in us I can't believe you would say something about me like that my I'm a predestinated seen of God and I believe God sent a prophet and how dare you talk to me like that I'm entitled to this don't don't tell me I'm Moroccan my goodness gracious don't you realize I was in brother branham's meetings don't you realize I went hunting with and don't you realize my mommy and daddy was in the meetings well I got one of his prayer cloth do you realize that you're talking to preacher Oh watch it now my but no what did that true seed of God do when word came forth that seed of God said truth Lord whatever you say is true and if I'm a dog let me be a dog at your table hood oh I don't care how I did in the kingdom of God just let me in Lord Jesus I'm gonna call on your name the Bible says if you call on the name you shall be saved Lord Jesus I don't have to be the greatest Lord let me be the least I just want to be their Lord let me just have a crumb for your table oh you got to see yourself in the Word of God truth Lord even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table faith always agrees with the word Lord I'll take whatever you'll give me maybe tonight somebody needs to say Lord I'll take whatever you give me you know he's willing to give you everything that you have need of tonight he'll if you're willing if somebody here is willing and you want that same power that same quickening power that was in Jesus Christ is available for you tonight to come into your life and quicken you to newness of life and to give you power and a sick adulterous evil age where there's so much evil everywhere you go God you can give you overcoming power look what the devil wants to do he wants you to fear what am I gonna do for music oh my goodness if I give up the world what am I gonna do brother brother Brooks listen to look this is this is this is real now this is down on this is how the devil works well if I start serving the Lord men then I can't hang out with my friends if I start serving the Lord I can't play those video games I was playing if I start serving lord I can't go over and do this with that look that's what Satan wants you to do now don't let him make you make you think that those are your thoughts if you want power you ain't gotta fix self don't worry look God will take care of the music God will take care of the friends I've gotta take care of the problems all Zi want is you and he wants all of you and if you're willing to take whatever he'll give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same power quickening power that was in there Lord Jesus Christ is available to come down here and anoint you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like those on the day of Pentecost and they come out a changed person all they come out of speaking in tongues they come out with the fruits of the spirit moving in their life I say Oh God not your Holy Spirit sweet through here tonight now did you notice people they want to get this get healed and get the Holy Spirit the way they they think they ought to have it now I'll come down brother if you'll bring me up and take me into a room where nobody will see me and and you lay hands on me and bless me and and put the Holy Ghost in me I'll accept it the whole name and wanted to accept his healing like that one time but Elijah told him to get out there in the old muddy Jordan dip seven times I could just see him God get off his chariot all great man hold his nose here comes out in the water tiptoe like a cat molasses you know coming out like this you know getting out like that to get down in the water he said I hate to do this hog dog down some people come to the altar like that like it's a sickening affair to him yes oh I don't want to do that he dunked one time and said I still got leprosy the Prophet said seven times right until he obeyed the word completely until you obeyed the word completely don't let the devil corner you with fear the word doesn't say go clean yourself up go get rid of everything that you know you get rid of and make sure you don't need me and then come to me that's the devil's trick but the scripture says repent of your be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost only believe don't fear it don't feel what you're gonna do what do on the other side look I tell people look if God is pulling on your heart and he is dealing with you to make a decision for Jesus Christ if it don't work out the world will take you back I mean not gonna get a whole lot of amens to that but I can promise you I can promise you the world to take you back but all my if you come if you come and have a real experience with the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost and power comes upon you the world won't even be able to get you back the world to be scared to you helping all man there goes one of them Christians like was walkin on the face of the earth back in Jesus day with the same power man their hands on the sick and the recovery land their hands on the sick and the rising up on a wheelchair why because he's the same yesterday today forever that's the kind of power I want I want quickening power their coming these bowls and quicken my mortal body praise God we got brothers and sisters and a fivefold ministry that's still standing on the banks in the Prophet said seven times this is what the Prophet said this is what the prophets said all but so many people would say well you want to know what name and yeah I think it'll be okay if you do it this way or you know well I know I know a river that flows into a you know over here let's just go down there we'll do it this way see so many men want to polish up the gospel look the dahle the gospels rugged and it's not cleaned and polished up like people would want it to be birth in Jesus Christ is a mess you come to the altar and oh my you weep your way to Calvary Oh do you realize I'm a wretched sinner I know I can overcome in this wicked evil age but I know Lord Jesus if you come if you come on the scene Lord and if you deliver me all things are possible and there you reap your way and the presence of God comes down and you feel the sweet embrace of his love and all of a sudden that burden of sin stops me for you oh if you've ever been there before ain't nothing like you and I invite you to come into his presence tonight hello my God's alive he's real he's here and he's ready to do for you a bob what you can even take your ask go away God's formula has never changed repent be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost just keep dippin just keep believing just keep listening just keep believing it's coming it's coming watch out devil it's coming oh my here comes fifth time six time seven time all of a sudden he was made I'm a nudist kid was clean just like that little girl Oh fear not I'll be not afraid only believe and your daughter shall be home look there's a bride coming forth in this last day without spot without wrinkle you have been made whole you never did it in the first place Oh hallelujah you came from the mind of God you're going back to the mind of God oh praise God hallelujah we all right brother praise the Lord God is good notice this is in the rising of the Sun speaking of the disciples notice they were cowards notice but they had they had the mechanics they had the teachings of Jesus they had the teachings of the Prophet they they had the books in the tapes they had their camps they had their retreats they had their circles they had their programs she bring it down home right they they had everything in order but they were all sitting in there saying oh I'm afraid of it I'm afraid to go out and make a claim because all of them great big bishops and things in the message oh wait all them great big bishops and things out there you know we got bishops in the message now oh we got masters of theology they'll tell you just what the prophet meant I'll tell you just what the Prophet meant you know really we haven't come from here to there because XY and see when you add that with one two three it equals what I mean oh god just give me a revelation tell me what the Prophet said stand there on the bank like that faithful servant into name and all the prophets said seven times just keep dipping just keep listening just keep hearing what the Prophet said just say what he said in one of these days hallelujah in a moment in a twinkling of the mind will all be changed because robbed during faith is laying in those seals you keep feeding on that body words some of them and you watch a change is coming in or a hallelujah oh I'm afraid of it then preached and things I'm afraid to make that claiming and I'm afraid I'll I'll say I believe I believed on him and oh I just can't do that you see but all of a sudden I like all of a sudden moments if you've ever had in all of a sudden moment you can't have enough of him because all of a sudden Jesus comes but all of a sudden the dynamics come yes and what did it do it not only field there spirit inside but it quick in their mechanics their bodies were quickened there were no Mallick hours they were right out in the face of the people Oh think of it now all right out there in the face of the people we had a wonderful experience last night just going through somewhere and getting a little drink you know we were just all happy just just all like brother branham talks about them bears that got in the honey bucket you know I just licking the honey off of one another we're just just happy to be with little brothers and sisters of precious like faith and and enjoying the Word of God we come through a little drive there drive through to get a little cup of coffee and you know like the girls like my y'all having fun tonight like oh yeah we're having a good time it's like my goodness Wow and you ought to come we just come for church so yeah I just come from church I said I said yeah you ought to come to church she said well I go to this church I said do you feel like this when you get out and sure yeah all right man just come for a visit my I just come and see look if you've experience then we need to be out there in the community at the gas pump at the station at our neighbors I don't work at her job but what the Satan does he got you to bow down with fear I'm afraid of what my boss will say because my boss pays my bills he's the one that takes care of me I'm afraid of what my neighbor might say cuz he might slash my tires I'm afraid of what the cash register will say because I don't want to be embarrassed oh my it's true this is the gospel look we say that were we when the last one comes in we're gonna go in a rapture nobody's nobody's concerned about it yeah when the last one comes in but I ain't gonna do none to help you know I can't wait to go to the rapture when somebody finds that last one I'll be thankful hey brother Isaiah thanks for getting that last one may not be waiting on you a long time that's not the love of God the love of God should be compelled in you the scripture says when the love is shed abroad in your heart one to another but that doesn't just mean the household of faith why don't you get up there and show somebody that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and look up on somebody's need and telling you know what oh my tell you what I don't like people smoking around me it kind of gets on my nerves but you know what I thought I got a really good tactic if somebody's smoking around you just go tell them that they could be delivered and nine times out of ten they won't smoke around you it's a good solution but that person knows they're in bondage they know they don't want to do that and so you never know they might be going through a trial they might have tried so many times you talk to most smokers they'll tell you man I've thrown down this thing twenty thirty times and you come over there and tell him you know there's such things arisen sader name Jesus Christ who all power and authority was given to you and he laid his life down at Calvary and not only did he have power to lay his life down but he had power to take it up again did you know he sit that spirit back upon man that if you'll just repent of your sins and you're baptized the name of the Holy Ghost you'll get power over that demon and you'll be delivered and you'll become one of them oh that's the gospel hallelujah that's the gospel that's preaching Jesus that's preaching Jesus that's living Jesus hey man just working towards the close here or we all right should we keep going praise the Lord have that that attitude of faith I'll take I'll take whatever you'll give me Lord I'll take whatever you'll give me tonight if we can have that type of a heavenly atmosphere and that type of expectation tonight Lord I'll take whatever you you'll give me oh just make make your heart right put all the sins under the blood to be an expectation for the power of the Holy Ghost to sweep through here and start believing upon the Lord everybody in one mind and one Accord moving into a heavenly atmosphere believing for people to be born again in the power of the Holy Ghost to come and in that type of expectation those are in the times are not heavenly atmosphere when things break when things start to move we're looking for it Lord Jesus granite but Satan wants to bind the people with fessor you men of Judea are you men of Des Moines Iowa you that dwell in Iowa City where before the dynamics come there were just the mechanics you men that dwell in Jerusalem let this be known unto you and hearken to my words these are not drunk as you suppose oh my he's the same yesterday today and forever Satan wants to bind you with fear the clergy want to bind the people with fear I feel like we've the ministry in many places have preached so hard against speaking in tongues being the evidence of the Holy Ghost that people are afraid to speak in tongues we fight something so hard one way that we scare the people from her from doing everything the other way we preach Urza preach so hard against Pentecost its preached so hard against speaking in tongues as the evidence all holding us they're not people scared to manifest the fruits of the spirit but I tell you when you come face to face with Jesus Christ and the Spirit of God starts to move upon you oh you just might might die start manifesting the fruits of them you might just start to dance you just might start to speak in tongues you just might start to show but you don't care what anybody else thinks because Prickett in power has come upon you and you don't care what your neighbor says you don't care what your boss says all you know is that Jesus Christ is alive and well and he's living to me to tell hallelujah Laurie Hebrews 13 6 so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do under me we just need some victory in her life that's what we need when David saw the ark coming home he started to get happy hello David saw the ark coming home he saw the world being restored and sup decided to rise up within him hello how are you he stopped to get the movie he's starting to get to dancing oh my might have made a fool of themselves wife they look down said I can't believe you're acting like that my goodness if we over got that kind of attitude in the church but I'll tell you what if you ever see somebody get free and you start to see them cut up in the Holy Spirit and if you're over the critical spirit I just said you you just don't know where they come from you just don't know what God did for them but I gotta get a hold of you one time and you rejoice with them and you might just get a little bit of loose you might just start to move a little bit you just might let the Spirit of God moving your life Lori we just need a little victory in a life we've not received the spirit of fear but we receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father which means my god the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God well just let a man come in contact with Jesus Christ I am the way the truth and the life I am the resurrection and the life giver and I'm here tonight to impart unto you what you have need of the musicians would come and the rising of the Sun he says no wonder he could claim their Matthew 27 chapter all power in heaven and earth has been given into my hands I send you to be my witness to all the world he had conquered both death hell and the grave not only did he do that and come out triumphant with all the power in heaven and earth all that was in the Father all that was the Holy Ghost all that there ever was was in him all powers in heaven and in earth was given to me everything else is powerless he had conquered oh that's the god I serve that's the god I served and that's the god that's living in you the same quickening power now and then not only that he sent word to his disciples his believing fear not for I am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore and I have the keys to death in him I've already conquered it don't fear anymore for every four dang predestinated seed of God shall come to life when that light spreads across the earth of the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that God ordained it to he had raised from the dead and he has raised out of dark denominational systems he preached the indictment the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ and Christ is now alive in the heart of his bride the same yesterday today and forever performing the same works that he did to prove to a dying generation that he's alive and he is here and he is here for you right now to do whatever you have need of well you are that crop he said in every age I'll bring forth the crop that God ordained it to you I that crop God has ordained in this age Christ the word has come to quicken us to life to quick get us out of Lady of cr2 quick get us out of dark denominational tombs and to the marvelous light of the gospel well hallelujah let's all stand oh the words just come in and take it away that spiritual amnesia it's being stripped away from you but I say just keep dippin just keep feeding on that word of God but one time not two times well wait full obedience to the Word of God entitles you to the token oh and once you get that it's all over friends just as the word of the Lord came to Elijah for naman to deliver him of his leprosy the word of the Lord has come to you to deliver you and if you'll just take God at His Word fear not only believe she shall be made whole fear not only believe you shall be made whole my let's just go before the Lord and prayer if there's a need on your heart or something you're believing for if you say Lord Jesus whatever little you'd give me Lord I'll take it and you'll find out what's called a little to God as more than you can even copy if faith the size of a mustard seed could move out oh my there's some on your let's go before the Lord Heavenly Father Lord I've done all that I know to do and now I just commit these people in the night hands Lord believing your word has gone forth maybe enough chopped up kind of different kind of way Lord but

and I'm enjoying it if you don't get it I'm gonna get it I'm getting mine day 1 day 2 theta 3 man I might be blasting off tomorrow surely it's been good to me I like it that way I like it when God can go down into your heart he's talking to you telling you don't you even fear it just take God at His Word believe it and God will bring it to pass I like it like that simple enough for me to understand I love it I love it that's the way I love it that's the way it was brought by the Prophet is that right he didn't come to confuse us he came to enlighten us amen that we may be able to see what the world will of the Lord he is a man I love it there's way I don't like it when I have to scratch my head and say what did he mean I like it when I can see it hear it and understand it and God revealed to me you're the special people tonight you're the special ones there people out there in the in in the gutter people right now dying from overdose right people out there on the streets hooked with all kinds of things amen all kinds of prefer to think can't get away from it aids are hunting them down come on I mean look at you what God has done for you they call you they say hey you don't have a life no no no we got the real life this is what it's all about we got the real life we don't have to worry a man about what Satan is putting out there why because we're covered by the blood Wow hallelujah under the blood covered by it protected hey man we're secure amen like the brothers say you don't have to feel the Holy Ghost you just know it just know you got it yeah man it's a lot of people sometime they come a long time before they really know they got it I wish the brother would have told that testimony maybe he's wait till in the morning to do it about the man who say you know how do you know you got the Holy Ghost if you could just share that at some point in time brother I'll be blessed and the people would be too because people don't even know that they got the lost life of God has already quickened them they want a lightning bolt hallelujah there was some kind of shiver or something and God is already working with me they eat in the Word of God they're growing they're maturing they wanting more and listen as long as you live in this you gonna always want more of him always want more and because you're hungry means you're living the dead don't get hungry only living get hungry and as long as you're hungry and thirsting after righteousness the Bible said ye shall be filled y'all believe that I believe that I know it's true a man ain't nothing like this Jesus I'm not the preacher but I showed enough stirred up he left undone for northing up before me to give a little bit Ian ain't God good ain't God good to give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are whoa we ought to thank him and praise Him a little more today and a whole lot let's sing in the same key Oh ain't God good to give out so many blasts undeserving that's what we are we ought to pay him a little more today and a whole lot more tomorrow God is good god is good all the time he put us all up praise in this part of my these good guesses all the time in the darkest night where his life is shot god is good Yesi Oh [Music] oh it got good to give us a manifest I'd be there that's what we got a little water cake and a hook fire fire fire bye by God as indicated a one-second fire fire fire fire as in the day fire fire fire [Music] hallelujah goodbye boo as in the day goodbye a ball Hey you know what we cannot allow ourselves to believe that we received the Holy Ghost in a Pentecostal way and when I say that I'm talking about denominations right if you remember the story that brother Branham read told he told about this man who had went from pillar to post seeing whether or not he had and brother Ellen said you got it when you read that track and you turned around from where you were how do you know you got the Holy Ghost is this okay brother cuz you turn from where you used to be to where you are now right and that Holy Ghost comes in you to mature you yes you gonna fall like a baby sometime you gonna stumble like a toddler hallelujah but down the road you'll learn how to walk upright just let the life of God and you bring you to that place you can't rush God you know what I'm saying I wanted to be 6-3 6-4 it ain't happening because it ain't the will of the Lord but I'm satisfied with what I have and God can feel this bottle just like he can feel the baby's bottle hey man god knows what he's doing half how much help trust have faith in God have faith in God it no man can add a cubit to his statue God don't tease people and say hey here's the Holy Ghost here's the Holy Ghost he never teased he hands it out there is that right brother Ellen said God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want it hallelujah and then let me say it like this how many times you've had your keys in your hands and you're looking around the house as where's my where my key where are my keys and everybody start laughing and saying you got them in your hand see that's how it is right that's how it is the Holy Ghost sometimes you got it you looking for it and you got it already you got it you need to water it I tell people and I don't mean no harm you know I can't holler stand start your services and I don't like it when people say they love God and then they sing it with a frown and you know you look at him like you're not convincing me I don't know where who you loving but you ain't loving him I don't see no signs right everybody when I was in the world let me tell you something when I was in the world I was the party when I was in the world I was the party everybody knew where to come on the weekend everything was free when they came I did not worry who gonna dance uh-huh no I was out there y'all better know what I'm done you know you understand me I didn't wait till somebody else got out there dancing I never went to a club and became a Wallflower hello y'all I used to do those things but when I was out there when I went to a club I came to lead I don't come to church to get mine I bring mine with me ain't ain't no show I can't help myself you say Jesus I guess nerves I can't help myself I don't want to stop the way I feel and I determined one time I went it faster well better not say that but I went to a church in that stayed there a long time trying to help him and I found out that they were trying to the devil with taking my joy I came in there jumping and fire and everything else and because they were cold and Stark [Music] they'll kill your fire don't let nobody kill your fire if you took only one in the church jumping and shouting for Jesus harlot hallelujah hey man the ages are watching you God is watching you is that right if there are any celebrities just like I said the other day we're the celebrities of heaven is that right the Bible said the angel of the lord encamps about them that fear him is that right if I said we're encamped about with so great a cloud of witnesses and for them to be witnesses they got to be looking into it right I saw you jumping for Jesus I saw you amen I'm a witness and she that's what I'm talking about when I come to church that's right I'm gonna entertain my god I'm not interested in entertaining nobody else but Jesus and don't tell me what I can and what I can't do but I know he's up here dancing with me if he want to do I'm gonna do it with him you understand me you can't see my partner but he's here oh lord help us Lord I just love the Lord I'm saying this song would be dismissive so we can go get up fellowship some more around there ain't it glad to be a Christian you're in the right key but I'm gonna take it down so they can Alexei sometimes a song leaders us me we get too hard and then the bass can't get it you know that amen ain't it grand to be a Christian oh all Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday all day

walk with Jesus in a party all day sunny ATP [Music] [Music] [Music] I want y'all to realize now tomorrow when we come here elders here that may not be in the spirit like you are but when you come here bring your fight bring your fire amen and and I wanna I want to say it like this too we are so blessed words cannot express express how we should be feeling and you know the devil is gonna fight you right after this meeting he's there he may even come to you before you get out the building right because she said oh my god don't hit garden you know I'm prayed and I'm praying I don't pray but you let me tell you something what really encourages me and I'm gonna shut my mouth at least try anyway but the thing that really encourages me is will not think about the Saints of old you know I don't know nobody who's been boiled in oil I don't know anybody who's been tied to a rotisserie and roasted over the fire because the people are trying to get them to denounce Jesus I don't know anybody who's whose mothers and had babies within themselves and the men would cut them open and rip their babies out because they wouldn't did not Jesus come on my trials are bad but they're not like they're not that bad you said I'm saying I don't have a worthy cause to denounce Jesus my trials may be hard my tests are hard sometimes you feel alone but the Bible said you're never alone now who you're going to breathe the devil's die or what God said he said I'll never leave it nor will I forsake you ain't no way I have been that I am determined the devil will never steal my joy [Music] if I gotta look like a clown to everybody else I am determined to not let the devil oh you saw her brother was are you gonna get have your moments just a moment it'll be just a moment right not a season a moment because I spring back all I need is one word from the Lord one thought of his word to know that God is never leaving nor he wears it and I've been ordained for this battle y'all know what I'm saying let me say it like this when you are deign for the battle you like David you're like David you got everything you need to conquer Goliath and like the brother said cast away the fear and go after the giant you love the Lord I don't mean the priest but I surely enjoyed the Word of God I enjoyed every bit of it I appreciate the Lord Jesus I appreciate our brother Matthew for open his heart to us and letting the law to use him in the way he did his heart some time to get up here after a preacher and I hope I didn't enter into his message for tomorrow but that's okay we served the same God and I know the Lord will bless y'all come believing that God is going to reward you look for God not brother Matthew Luke beyond that veil hear what the voice of the Lord is saying to you believe it's not just a man see that's what happened with brother everybody thought it was just a man but believe it's God moving behind that veil and preaching and giving you the Word of God when uh when God pray I said that right brother I'm said when a man pray and he prays in the name of Jesus Christ he said there's no longer that man that's Jesus Christ praying so when I preach is telling you something and encouraging you and and ending it up in the name of Jesus Christ that's Jesus not brother Brooks not brother Matthew Brett Jesus if you can take it as Jesus and not as a man you'll come out conquered conquering a devil every time father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord we appreciate you everything you have done for us Lord we know that you wanted us to have these meetings and Satan has fought in every but lord I know when you ordained something something to do or something to happen no matter what Satan tries to do the purpose will be accomplished and father I don't know what all the young people need and the elders we all stand in need Lord and we just pray tonight that they will see that this is not just another meeting but you ordain these meetings you pressed upon my heart to have these meetings and Lord we have learned through the prophet of God that you keep all of your appointments and not one person should leave out of this meeting without receiving what they asked for because even in your word you say where two or three are gathered in my name there you are in the midst and Lord you've been in our mist you are in our mist we pray father god bless each and every heart tonight even as we depart and go to our different destinies let us continue to be united with and as we pray we want to pray father God for the food that has been prepared we pray that you bless the food sanctify to the nursing or bodies longing in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] [Music] [Music]
