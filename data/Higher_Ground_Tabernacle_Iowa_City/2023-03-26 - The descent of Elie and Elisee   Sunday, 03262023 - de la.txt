TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and who stood alone with God why this is a great witness testimony had come near let me just read it let me read it I used a really bad French says God God called man uh look at what it has done here now let's make this one please he pulls down his Spirit the spirit of his son he accomplished this signs and wonders and miracles what the world had never seen in those are past two thousand years the scientific word took a picture of it the spill of Fire the angel of God the Lord [Music] was hanging in Washington DC this afternoon in The Gallery of Art and villages the only supernatural being [Music] who had never ever been uh pictured with scientific proof [Music] he produces the same science uh wonders and science yes they said what it is what is it it's about cruising Jordan to fund yourself with God to stay there in that furnace with him that's what made the the this picture of the Holy Spirit a human a human with flesh a believer who crossed the Jordan and stood alone with God that's why the pillow fight was pictured I'll never go with this pillow fire in the tone on the grave it would stay with the church but the preachers the preacher says [Music] can you stay with the pillow fight that's the preachers today those schools are prophets knowledge they said the pillow fight cannot never be with you what is he gonna do with you are you a eight uh message that's the school of medicine Prophets but the pillow fire gotta be with each believer what it fell down on the Pentecost I was a pillow fire it was divided with a lot of ton of fires and I believe Believers and I think believers has to have the pillow fire working with the pillow fire if you really you are a reader of the Bible the Bible said the angel of the Lord Camp among those that are feeling and take them away from danger D'Angelo the Lord is the Lord himself Branham says bill of fire is not God but the pillow fire is the attribute of God the attribute of his presence so when you whenever you set a pillow fire that means God is with you in a different form the pillow fire literally [Music] that means god is there because God has a human form but whenever you see the pedophile is the attribute of this presence had to do that steps head to cross and I believe I took a long time I'm gonna hurry up a little bit foreign and then we can stop from today and next Sunday the pastor is going to be here with us he told me that he's going to preach here on Sunday and after that I will come back the following Sunday is going to be the ninth it's going to be uh the Passover and he asked me to bring a message of uh Easter so next Sunday please comment so you can listen to our pastor now listen I want to go I want to hurry so we can finish for today I'm in a hurry to finish all the message the entire message that's what I do I know that people already have the message you gonna struggle in the puppet as as if you're gonna finish all the entire message you're gonna kill yourself for nothing the message is gonna stay there but you're gonna go away he's struggling you're struggling we all know the message most people here know the message so the problem is not about quoting quoting quoting and people go out and they know they don't even understand what you talked about but the message is large it's huge he's not going to finish in one day you can even go and leave the message that's why I want to give little and I go rest I come back a little bit and I'll go back to race that's what I do I'm not here to show somebody or to prove or to finish them you go you're never gonna end the message but you can end up yourself a message will never end but you can end up yourself now listen the prophet did you did the prophet God says what can make the day out the devil fear s that doesn't [Music] um oh that doesn't matter how that doesn't matter how much you can cry to the devil to the devil oh the fact of crying and shouting in church that doesn't matter to the devil how much you can Shout that doesn't matter how much you can jump how much you can do this in there but What Hurts the Most to the day is to see that sanctify life holy and consecrated to God that's why it hurts the most to the devil say no matter what to that person you can treat him with any name we always stay sweet go forward maybe you didn't get this yes what can make the devil fear devil doesn't care how much we shout in church the devil is not scared of how much we say Amen in church because the devil also know the same word the Bible says they will believe and also trouble sometimes you believe that you don't even tremble but the devil believes in trouble the fact of crying or shouting just saying amen that's not what uh skills the devil but what scale the devil is the it's the Holy Spirit sanctified that's what is a thunder in Davis years that's why the prophet God said so no matter how would you say Amen devil is not scared of it because the Devil is a Believer as well he also goes to church and this morning the devil is here in this church he is a Believer he carries his Bible he goes to church to see believers you don't see believer as a church it's not a church where you seek the Christians Christian you see Christians outside that's why we see True Believers or Christians so what I'm asking the church this morning so we can do that jump so we can cross the Jordan the children of the pride of life the Jordan Jordan of president God wants us to cross that so we can stand alone with him and have a better vision because when Elisha crossed it Jordan he had a vision and I watched I won each one of us this morning God gives you a vision on your life crossing the Jordan that God gives you a new project God gives you a new purpose to pursue a new vision that's better than what you had this morning that's why brothers and sisters that wants us to cross the Jordan so we can go down to the Jordan the knowledge and desire a new knowledge comes from God himself and that knowledge will come only when we cross the journey only when we receive the holy spirit because Barbara says when God gives you the Holy Spirit continue everything that you need all over your journey on this Earth through the glory so this morning I want us to cruise to go beyond where God is going to sinner with the spirit what is going to give us when he's going to give us everything that's uh enough for for our uh Earth Journey everything that we need for our journey on Earth is money on it houses on it the power of God on it children's kids on there everything that we need and to have that is when you cross the Jordan you have the Holy Spirit God puts in US everything we need that's why Jordan is really important you know uh believer's life in a Christian's life the Jordan is really really important aside artists fraternities let's pursue one purpose only purpose that's Jesus Christ may the Lord bless you let's say if they can lead us a song thank you it's me standing Champion we're going to sing with meditation then we can get and get in prayer and asking God to separate us from the things of the world so we can stay alone with him that's what God wants um [Music]
