here for together i had to drive uh back from uh lime ohio on yesterday so they were conveying the lime ohio yeah and then we got in around 5 30 a.m i had to get back up early we had an outreach meeting yesterday in the park and uh so here we are this morning in washington but i trust that god will touch this whole body uh as we stand let us take turn to colossians one glad to see everybody here tonight or this morning i promised you i would be here and i wanted to make sure i kept that promise so we thank god for those of you who have come as we read in colossians the first chapter we're going to start at the 15th verse who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether there be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him he is before all all things and by him all things consists of want to choose etude churches but only he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence please the father that in him should all fullness dwell god you have looked at plenitude and heaven made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say what they'll be throwing things in earth or things in heaven father we so thank you for your grace this morning thank you for being so good to us we thank you for the protection that you give us as we travel along the dangerous streets and highways we pray this morning that the people would be blessed the purpose we pray lord god that you will open our eyes of our hearts and give us understanding in revelation give us a zeal lord to press forward in this evil day don't say this movie have your way to this morning oh paul paul controlled in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated as well we have been really uh working by god's grace with things of the seals and of the thunders and things of that nature and to be honest with you i'm really anticipating coming of the lord when god would change our bodies from mortal to immortality brother branham in this little quote [Music] coming from the uh identified masterpiece of god oh vernon the um all right let's and he said it like this he said anything to choose that's in the bible is inspired by the spirit whether it is history whether it's songs whatever it is it's inspired jesus said jesus have not you read what david said in the psalms and then i think er psalms of course is songs lip song yes your and if songs are inspired of god they see something which i believe they are you sacrificing prophetic also uh prophecy and i hope i am standing that day there's your quackers when this song comes to pass god says there is going to be a meeting in the air in your heart you know in the sweet sweet by and by such singing ever heard will be the leading one at that meeting in the air he says oh what a time ladies i'm sorry he says oh i want to be there at that time this is why i believe that the message of the hour goes beyond all that we have been taught because the things that are that were taught in the church could not bring us to perfection it actually took the opening of the word it took the mystery of malach of revelation 10. let me say this in malachi 4. [Music] nothing man made uh sets us free i'm gonna say that again the opening of the word which we know as the third pool sets us free [Applause] is what we raise you up again that word is what will raise you up again you become part of that word you identified with [Music] he said [Music] and you know i have tried to tell us that even though the message have not become an organization we have systemized our worship system and it has gotten to a place right through this system we literally shut him out we claim and here god has moved forward and we want to stay in the seventh age instead of the eighth floor and then we argue with one another and whether we in the eighth day or the eighth age when god has clearly pronounced the change when the seals were open and the seven thunders uttered their voices hallelujah god did not do that in the seventh city he did it in the eighth faith somebody help me here see we must understand that we must move forward we can't stay where we used to be [Music] but when you see that god has done a dispensation on change hallelujah you move forward into that change what was good for laodicea it's not just like what was in to see a rapture fulfill on left more hallelujah is that right because we realized that the age of leonis has already been judged god found them lukewarm and he has spilled them out of his mouth it doesn't matter it doesn't matter how and speaking in tongues is that the pentecostal church do now secondly god still have judged them dead hallelujah they have a name that they live and they are dead listen you and i must be careful we must be watchful because the same devil that slipped lay on the seer into blindness can also slip us into blindness somebody help me here you see this is why it's an individual walk this is why god is calling for individuals individuals who will love him with all of their hearts is that right who will love him with all of their hearts hallelujah brother talks about the music was great no doubt they were shouting and dancing hallelujah and they thought that's what god was looking for somebody help me here you see because paul says you can have faith to move mountains and it still will profit you nothing if you don't have divine love hallelujah a man is not saved because he's a preacher a man is not saved [Music] and he's able to see the light of his day y'all hear what i'm saying you must see the light of your day you must follow the pillar of fire you must stay in tune with the holy spirit and what he's doing for this day my message i'm anticipating a greater move of god among the bride of jesus christ [Music] you know [Music] when the bride comes to understand who jesus is he did not say when the bride comes to understand who the father is he said when the bride comes to know who jesus is see you said amen he did not say it he said when the bride comes to know who she is i didn't mean to trick you but when the bride comes to know who she is the rapture will take place so you must understand the move is on for the bride those things that are unfolding are unfolding for the bride to come into her position so that she will recognize who she is and then god began to unfold himself but that wasn't the final uh unfolding of god he then unfolded himself into a man somebody help me here until we recognize that we are part of the godhead somebody help me here you see because adam was a part of the godhead i don't know oh somebody am i preaching what he preached because you and i must understand when god unfolded himself into a man don't you say transform finish he rested from his labor hallelujah but it was the devil amen who broke the very system of god hallelujah because when sin entered in adam lost the ability to have that communion with god by way of his body hallelujah nothing could change what adam was on the inside but now his flesh was defiled and satan had become god of the whole world hallelujah amen this is why satan for [Music] if we we could most of us if we could peel off this flesh we will stand perfect [Music] because the inside has already been regenerated to redeem your body hallelujah it's not just redeeming of the soul hallelujah because those of us who was with god from the foundation of the world [Music] so you got to realize that had to come something okay that could sanctify us not only sanctifiers is that right remember the last thing to be changed the redemption of your what body but your soul in spirit has already been redeemed you see we got to understand god you must have could never be animals that had been yoked they had to be free animals you understand what i'm saying so in order for god to bring us into a complete redemption [Music] and the thing about it is i believe that so many of us are still not understanding when you have to dress on uh uh preach on dress codes it shows that that individual is not maturing or is not matured is that all right remember amen the god is coming for a matured bride he's not coming for children per se you understand what i mean by that he's coming for one who knows what to do is that right because uh is that right he explained to rebecca because oh uh uh uh that that abraham it first for his son isaac right and he began to explain amen to her what isaac liked is that right and [Music] it was only when she saw him she leaped off of her camel and brother said that was likened to the rapture she lifted up her camel unveiled herself and went into isaac's tent hallelujah and isaac's tense was his mama's tent which was sarah's tent which was the old time religion [Music] let me hurry up here now i'm moving too slow so is it time sir that's good i miss you you know a lot of people think that brother branham knew everything and he did oh you better not say that but there was times he did not know and god had to reveal it to is him right you remember when that blast he kept seeing that vision of a blast brother branham thought brother thought he was going to die he knew it was a message from god somebody helped me and he knew that something was coming forth but he didn't know what it was that was the main part hallelujah but then god comes along hallelujah oh somebody help me here in 1963 when that blast went off constant the reality of the dream and when god when that prophet we get took that cockapoo off now you know people want to argue with that description yourself that was a pre rapture call it what you want to do but if the angels had taken him up in the clouds he [Music] and if he had gone that high he would have froze to death you agree with me that's good so something supernatural took place and he was caught up into the clouds now you must he was he he was caught up is that what that's right the scripture says that one day we will see him face to face somebody help me here and so you see he was caught up and it was 1963 1965 two years later [Applause] even the prophet of god at that point up until two years later had never seen the face of god in the cloud hallelujah this is very significant because at this time sit down something changed there was no longer he was no longer the messenger if i could say it like this of the seven church ages only he was kind of like john the baptist he stood in the midst of two ages of two time changes he was the actually covenant angel that god had brought to us in this day hallelujah he was bringing a new covenant to a new people hallelujah this was not for laodicea this message is for the bride age only those who comes out of laodicea will be able to see the message of the hour hallelujah brother branham didn't bring his true message you know what this is what he said he kept telling us i got to go away i gotta two prophets can't be on the scene at the same time that's what he said he said two can't be who is the eighth one now hallelujah [Music] every country every country brother but all of you everyone got an eighth [Music] was to introduce rebecca to isaac hallelujah it wasn't going to be ella easy coming from the team who came out of the tent he ever knew that it wasn't abraham it was isaac the introduction was to isaac is that right this message was to why because many of us knew him as a denomination uh with the denomination revelations but we have to come to see him as he is oh somebody help me and we know that the bible says as he is so are we in this present wow now i want you to think about that because if you don't know who you are you will never know what you come to do is that right see god unfolded himself to adam but in adam there was still another mystery hallelujah so god cuts adam open he breaks the seal somebody help me here and he pulls adam out i didn't say i said he pulls adam out and then he began to express to adam who she is and where she came from you understand me so you got to understand that this message [Music] um see but we're so afraid of that i know something we are we're afraid to say we're joined heirs with christ we're afraid to say we can be and we must stand on that word [Music] that's been proven to be the supernatural he says to me it was the same light that struck down saint paul it was the same light that led the children of israel by night did you notice here his angel he was clothed in a cloud now listen brother branham is always speaking in parables [Music] this message is not given to everybody the intellectual can pick up this message and he may be able to explain something intellectual but he'll miss the revelation of it a million miles away hallelujah there were times if you listen to the tapes it seems like brother brandon was stuttering around so they come see the prophet beginning and the whole time he did it to confuse the intellect things he was trying to says so he would just go around answering their questions for an example jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever they asked jesus christ a question [Music] and they said now if we say [Music] then the people gonna stone us hallelujah so they came up with so you saw a political correct answer [Music] we cannot tell and then jesus said i cannot tell you if you're not gonna tell me i'm not gonna tell you but then he goes on to say but my [Music] you and i ought to be in in anticipation brother branham has been going off the scene for more than 50 years now hallelujah is that right and we know that a generation is about 40 i knew somebody should be on the scene somebody that's going to hear what the spirit is saying to the to the bride of christ hallelujah you don't believe that it is the truth because remember when joshua [Music] now if you say today that brother branham is dead they want to stone tell the people that moses is there now was moses that's the most no no but what he was saying is that the ministry of moses has come to an end hallelujah and now joshua is on the scene somebody help me here we are no longer here to be spectators hallelujah in moses day everybody waited to see moses do miracles is that right people went all down to jeffersonville to see god do miracles to through william branham and then william brandon was trying to tell the people god can do miracles through you hallelujah and what he was doing he was literally preparing the people for the ministry that would come after him oh come on somebody so you can understand that when when joshua you know this this came through uh brother ben because he this message it struck me so so well he said joshua made the people participate amen to take them in hallelujah and you failed to see the prophet of god without the pill of fire was just a man it did so much hallelujah y'all understand you understand where we are but he came to show us that the power and the authority in which he had was the same kind of power and authority that was to come on the bride of jesus christ he was just a wave shielded he was the power of god in a man born by a woman hallelujah he was showing the redemption power of the blood of jesus christ that not only was the blood able to cleanse us from our sins had the power to positionally place us back in the place where we had fallen oh let me get back with this so you know this message is that right because joshua was also a type of uh a furtherance if i say it joshua was a furtherance of the commandment of adam joshua was a further runs in the sense that he had to possess the land is that right god told adam should do everything don't mean to choose bring that bring it into subjection i'm meant to choose in other words i have given you dominion and everything must be subject to you that is the move that's on the right she's going to be tried she's going to be tested but you and i have the ability the ability the possibility of bringing everything into subjection hallelujah why because god has given us in this ministry amen preeminence [Music] nothing shall stand in your way if you can get the people to believe nothing shall stand in your way hallelujah if that's what's happening with us now if you believe i'm bringing it down to you if you believe i'mma say it again if you believe nothing shall stand in your way man hallelujah it didn't he didn't say it wouldn't come and i find the country but he said you would gain victory over it [Music] can i say it like this your lady victory it was the same light that led the children of israel by night did you notice here's the angel he was clothed in a cloud see [Music] not understanding first thought it was wrong that i was just saying that but the holy spirit happened to hide the scientific instruments and the people there were for vindication and took the picture of it several times that all right from shillong and that the gross darkness that's upon the church things today to fail to see the light that's shining see monk there seemed to be such a heavy press we take some of the noted evangelists today they are constantly screaming for a revival and working against it now we've seen you got the only truth there is in the world no that is wrong see no i'm only saying it in the light of the hour that we're walking in hallelujah now he didn't say other people didn't have truth but he said it in such a way a wise way hallelujah well he says listen but i'm just trying to tell you he could have said oh that's right he could have easily said no they don't have truth because what was truth yesterday is not true but he says no i'm just working and for the benefit of the people jesus said no man can can come to me except my father draws him no man will never see it it's the soup it's it's that predestinated seed that only is going to receive it but we come to that place again that you're the light of the world oh my goodness hallelujah what was it you know brother branham couldn't you say listen you see what i'm saying they would have the devil would have twisted that thing he could have easily [Music] [Music] the intellect [Music] going back to the cloud going back to the cloud because in the opening of the seventh seal without you i explained that to you all the last time in the opening of the seven seals six of those seals had already been opened sisters were so hungry through the time of history because they didn't know it they had no idea what was going on but they god used them each one of those angel was being used hallelujah oh come on somebody oh but then when the seventh angel came to city that's how we know it's the end of the day we he was the mighty angels the resurrection of jesus christ of god and when it unveiled itself it constituted the violence it was the mighty angels is he not a god of immorphy he's a god that changes his mass hallelujah he was god the word standing right there protecting the world and found out that the tomb was empty somebody helped me here been the same by the angel that resurrected comes in revelation 10 1. hallelujah jesus stood there this is your idea as a man did you see me at the tomb of lazarus that same body anger hallelujah who was god himself said that i he came with the book opener and if the seventh seal was open under the sixth see the seventh seal could not be opened until the seventh angel messenger came hallelujah in other words that was his true ministry amen is that right because he said every messenger comes at the end of the age yeah so he came at the end of laodicea and if he came at the end of laying this here where are we time has changed in the sense that time is no more when we are baptized into christ when we grow up into him we are in an eternal age we are in an age we call the bride you say well i don't see it nowhere he said there is a holy convocation [Music] remember the children of israel didn't have to do no works they didn't have to do nothing tell me what they had to do the only thing they had to do is to believe what moses said [Music] how do you know when a man but don't believe me [Music] [Music] [Music] zion [Music] is that right come on somebody's the truth let me ask you a question i think i i said this the last time i was here but why did not the children of israel leave egypt when joseph died [Music] they had it so easy god had to raise up a pharaoh who did not know joseph 24 11 hallelujah come on somebody let me tell you like this wait in the time of william branham even the white house knew who you are political leaders from here to england knew who he was but now we're living in a generation that knows nothing about joseph [Music] and guess what's happening we the bride of jesus christ we are taking it so easy we halfway pray most of us don't know what a fast day is we don't read our bibles god knows we don't read our messages hello we're too busy we're too relaxed [Music] let god spew you out of his mouth hallelujah but to the elected hallelujah she is going to stay on fire for god with you hallelujah now i'm going to tell you well let me let me define revival to you let's go if you're getting the trash out of your life you are in revival revival ain't jumping and shouting hallelujah oh that's good revival is not adding more to the church all of that's good revival is taking that thing that already is and cleaning it up hallelujah that means the bride needs a cleaning up and she's got to clean up there is no spot wrinkle or blemish bring it right on up to the age of eternal security how many of y'all believe in that allah [Music] as long as you you are in the church you are secured with the church you get it now then how do we get into the church by joining no no but by one spirit that's first corinthians 12. we are baptized into one fellowship and in there as long as we're in this fellowship the blood of jesus christ cleanses us continually god looking through the red as we had last night see and it's a red sinner but you see you white through the red blood so uh some of us ought to be you know oh lord have mercy god don't that sees the giants in the land and come back and say we can't do it we've got to be like joshua is that right lord we are more than able to conquer this land oh i'm coming to you we are more than able to put this disobedient body under subjection hallelujah paul said you must crucify this flesh you what was this uh uh uh seals opening brother branham showed us what was under the fifth seal in the sixth seal and all of these things and he began to say that each is that right and we didn't even know that we we just saw history we didn't know what we didn't know that that was here [Music] is that right and then he begins to tell us that the first woe was world war one and the second woe is world war ii and in between world war ii and world war three the rapture has to take place hallelujah now the move is on for the bride so now the economy has crashed right you haven't seen nothing yet you just heard the news yesterday or the other day where the stock market has crashed you don't know it has crashed and nobody knows how it's going to be picked up a person hallelujah but every nation is undetermined hallelujah is that right you know that's the truth if i run out of food and my neighbors got food i'm gonna break into my neighbor's house hallelujah now i don't know whether you captured some of these things but brother told us he said the russian soldiers will be upon our soil that's what he said and now trump [Music] like what we gonna do we got to choose the lesser evil if there is a less senior y'all understand what i'm saying because pelosi is saying i heard of myself and i know i shouldn't be preaching politics but i'm trying to bring you to somewhere she's basically saying even if trump wins he will not remain president the democrats these liberals you don't america has never been in a situation before maybe in other countries y'all have seen it happen but in america we've never we've never gone hungry y'all understand me and so now it's a place where everybody is really frustrated we're frustrated about the math i don't mean not but we are most of us we are now you and i know that that that the coronal virus is real it really is but but anyway you know everybody's tired of being controlled is what i'm trying to say so now we know what's going to happen if they come if trump wins trump it's going to be a war and if nancy lord forgive my thoughts about that lady it's going to be a war so we're right now why because we've got too many riots going on now this is something we never had like on the scale in the history of them so people are now frustrated they're angry they're mad people have lost their home they've lost their business y'all understand me they're looking for a change hallelujah y'all understand me and when all of this fall wars begin to and that's matthew 24. wars and rumors of wars nation against nations kingdom is king against kingdom we are now getting ready to pay for rejecting the gospel hallelujah is that right this country has been judged since 1962 hallelujah when alaska almost sunk brother said judgment has struck the west coast hallelujah since 1962 judgment struck the west coast and she's been under judgment ever since now don't get me wrong because y'all think just america the whole world is under judgment y'all hear what i'm saying i'm drawing this scenario so you can see that that's how close it is to the rapture because the prophet god said before one bomb drop maybe you don't get excited about things like that [Laughter] [Music] the bride will be gone [Music] and the u.n will get involved when america loses control the u.n army which consists of russia which consists of russia which consists of china and you know china don't like us right now and all of those uan nations whatever and whoever it takes to bring us under control they're going to sin hallelujah why why why why because mama wants this country and guess what folks they're worse than the fbi the cia whatever you name it they're murderers they'll do anything to bring a person or a country under the rulership of the catholic church that's why he's doing what he's doing he's one of the main advocates of this whole virus you can believe it's just conspiracy if you want to there's a corner of yours but if you believe the coronavirus just evolved then you believe in evolution hallelujah you believe that a turkish can mate with a mate with a chicken and have a chicken turkey you'll never see that happen it has to be manipulated and this coronavirus is manipulated it is something man put together whether it was intentional or not only god knows but it's still the judgment of the lord science got us into this mess y'all hear what i'm saying i'm trying to close now so i can tell you we are at the end and you've got to come to believe who you are you don't know who you are you don't know where you are you'll never know where you're going let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus hallelujah you can't tell me this world is not sodom and gomorrah the whole world is everywhere you go you don't you know come on you know it's the truth you're sick when i was growing up as a boy it was every now and again you see a sodomite now i know every y'all think all y'all think i'm talking about homosexuals no i'm talking about that and us and other things about this you say no i ain't never been perverted yeah you weren't good all of us were one way or another [Music] the devil from your birth made you think perverted holy is that the truth anything that's not word is perverted now you see everywhere i was in a i was in a uh uh a gas station with my wife and my grandbaby and here was this man had tattoos all over his face and cut his hair in such a way and had horns and everything sticking out and when i saw him i ran to catch my grandbaby because i didn't want her to see that it about scared me and i know what it would have done to her [Laughter] hello you ought to come to iowa des big man bigger than me high-heeled shoes and a dress no trans could do that we understand nothing no knife could have helped him yeah but he's proud oh come on people what i'm trying to tell you it's not going to get better it's getting worse and like i was telling the people out there when we were witnessing yesterday it don't matter what a person is all of us had problems when we came to god you lying well i ain't never did nothing the bible said if you look at a woman and left for her in your heart you've committed adultery don't tell me that sanctify me jesus see you know we i i'm hitting everything because i don't want people to think your righteousness of yourself you ain't got no righteousness you're righteousness of god you present what you do every day is still filthy right to god i'm almost done but thank god for his righteousness he gives us a message to clothe ourselves again a message that will keep keep our nakedness from being appearing hallelujah to keep us from feeling ashamed hallelujah is that right brother said he had to confess his sins every day and i want to find out if there's anybody in here who can't don't have to confess every day then something ain't quite right maybe you don't reach that perfection already in closing i keep saying that but i am closing with this knowing that the seventh seal so god unfolded those seven seers to us they said so but in the seven thunders there was a secret part there anything is given it's in there you like this and then because brother branham said in one of the quotes he said one day you'll find out where it's written and then brother tells you he says individual if you even tell them they ain't gonna understand what you're saying the thing what i'm trying to say is this if you if if your if your life is not an intimate relationship with god at this point in time you need to repent you need to ask god for his mercy and his grace because we don't have much time hallelujah remember joshua joshua was something else you know moses let the people complain and complain and complain but when joshua tries to take worldly things i see and bring them into the promise i mean did i say joshua i mean a can when he can took those wedges and and and garments and and guess what did god he killed the man y'all understand me and there is a spiritual death going around right now and people don't realize what's happening to them so that you'll know that what god did in 63 is you could have failed what we what we have feasted on you just looking at the message we praise god that's children's play hallelujah i was trying to show you now god in jesus christ interprets his own word however he interprets it we take it right but what he did in 1963 got to be in the scripture hallelujah it doesn't erase the the literal corporate body and he brought a message to prepare you for a rapture hallelujah and i believe when the rapture takes place we'll look up and we will see him oh somebody help me here i don't think we're going to be flying into in the air looking at nothing however he interprets it it's his own business you just be part of it that's the most important thing like once he's coming on a white horse who cares how he's coming as long as he comes to argue about nothing to fuss about the point is you make yourself ready with anticipation like that little girl waiting on him already in the door so that you understand you're not going to say god i couldn't overcome this because i was born with it just like i said yesterday the man that was born blind for 30 years he could have had an excuse too but god healed him the mane the halt no matter what it is the power of god it lays within this message and it's for you and i that's that's the session but we got to have faith to believe it claim it speak it declare it it doesn't matter if you fail because the same god that lets you fall it's the same god will pick you up hallelujah but he wants you to venture out there he wants you to move forward is that right it's all i ain't closing i'm closing right now see i'm close it's just like every parent hallelujah why because we see that effort in trying to fall and eventually when they start walking right oh don't let them run yeah and with those little steps i love it i love it full throttle and we get so much joy that's our god here that's how he is god didn't come to destroy us let me tell you something god has a hook in your life you can't get away from him because he ain't gonna let you get away not one of his elect will fail i don't care what kind of mess you think you're in if you elected to be god god it's going to bring you through somehow it ain't your business as long as you stay under have faith in god oh god thank you jesus hallelujah amazing grace shall always be [Music] was [Music] just how [Applause] [Music] beyond all our [Music] [Music]
