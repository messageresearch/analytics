[53:21] chapter
[53:24] peters
[53:39] turn with us to colossians 2 9.
[53:53] saint john 14 30.
[54:02] jesus is speaking and he says hereafter
[54:06] i will not talk much with you
[54:10] for the prince of this world cometh
[54:13] and have nothing
[54:16] in me
[54:19] [Music]
[54:22] illness
[54:31] a
[54:43] colossians 2 9
[54:50] for in him dwelleth
[54:53] all
[54:54] the fullness of the godhead
[54:57] bodily
[55:04] i'm going to ask that you turn with us
[55:06] again back to four john 14.
[55:10] we'll read the 19th and the 20th verse
[55:13] there musa
[55:28] and it reads
[55:31] yet a little while and the world seeth
[55:35] me no more
[55:38] but ye shall see me
[55:41] because i live
[55:43] ye shall live also
[55:58] that jesus had not gone to calvary yet
[56:01] okay
[56:04] and the day of pentecost had not yet
[56:06] arrived
[56:09] and he's talking to his disciples
[56:13] a disciple
[56:14] and he's implying hey
[56:17] man that they're not living yet
[56:21] in the funko but he's saying because i
[56:24] live
[56:26] ye shall live also
[56:30] see they were not quick into who he was
[56:35] they were not quickened
[56:37] who he was i security they were able to
[56:40] see john is they take up the voice
[56:55] now the 20th verse reads men on the
[56:57] verse
[56:59] at that day
[57:01] ye shall know that i am in my father see
[57:05] where he took him
[57:10] and ye
[57:22] [Music]
[57:24] him
[57:26] louis that's life
[57:28] let us pray
[57:30] heavenly father
[57:32] we thank you for your grace
[57:34] we thank you for your mercy
[57:37] we thank you for all that you don't
[57:40] better to us send your tragedy
[57:43] to ourselves please
[57:44] there is no words to express
[57:47] me
[57:48] father give us grace this morning
[57:51] give us the ability to move completely
[58:06] to submit
[58:19] i like to entitle this message
[58:29] and if i was to have a secondary uh
[58:33] topic uh
[58:39] [Music]
[58:47] the bible tells us that many are called
[58:52] but few were chosen
[58:55] and everybody wants to live hey
[58:59] you find out that
[59:02] even in the scientific world
[59:05] they're trying to develop
[59:07] some kind of a medication that will
[59:10] make you live longer
[59:14] for long term but we realize that
[59:22] [Music]
[59:30] is
[59:32] [Music]
[59:55] right amen because the purpose of god
[1:00:07] it is what we have been ordained
[1:00:13] is that right
[1:00:14] you see
[1:00:15] we must be made
[1:00:18] we must be made
[1:00:20] out of the same material
[1:00:24] that he was made out of
[1:00:40] the same was in the beginning
[1:00:44] the thing that i love about jesus
[1:00:48] he had no darkness in him
[1:00:51] none of this cosmos or kingdom or
[1:00:54] candace
[1:01:03] [Music]
[1:01:08] jesus was saying and was talking
[1:01:12] and he said the prince
[1:01:14] of this world cometh
[1:01:18] and have nothing in me
[1:01:20] inaudible
[1:01:22] i love that shem seller because he said
[1:01:25] listen
[1:01:26] there's nothing in me
[1:01:29] that can be drawn
[1:01:34] by the devil
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:51] [Music]
[1:02:05] are privileged i am so thankful
[1:02:08] and i don't have to worry about my
[1:02:11] salvation
[1:02:14] hallelujah amen is that right
[1:02:16] because the prophet of god tells us
[1:02:59] now there is only one thing can happen
[1:03:04] there has to be a message
[1:03:07] at the end time i'll offend it when
[1:03:10] there is nothing else can follow it
[1:03:14] hallelujah amen and now the air
[1:03:16] communicate world
[1:03:20] le monde community has set up such a
[1:03:23] regime
[1:03:25] that there could be no denomination
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:56] she is ripening a
[1:03:59] she and she is ripening
[1:04:02] into christ like fruit
[1:04:06] bringing forth the shame
[1:04:10] bringing forth the same news
[1:04:14] mellowness
[1:04:15] and sweetness
[1:04:18] and the same spirit elements that he had
[1:04:23] in him and we y'all
[1:04:38] hallelujah
[1:04:51] and you have that truth on the inside
[1:04:55] because that truth lives
[1:05:01] hallelujah
[1:05:02] now
[1:05:03] let's go on continue we understand no
[1:05:06] comprehensive
[1:05:16] and he was manifested in jesus christ
[1:05:19] is that right
[1:05:21] and the bible tells us
[1:05:23] i read that jesus
[1:05:24] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[1:05:27] the godhead
[1:05:30] hallelujah now this is a mystery man
[1:05:33] this is the thing that i love the most
[1:05:35] question please he said yet a little
[1:05:37] while
[1:05:39] and the world seated me no more elements
[1:05:42] but ye shall see me
[1:05:45] i don't know whether you see him
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:00] [Applause]
[1:06:03] answer july you shall know
[1:06:05] that i am in the father
[1:06:07] in me
[1:06:09] and i and you and m
[1:06:11] listen equity
[1:06:13] i can't be in the devil's business
[1:06:21] amen
[1:06:22] you know when the word was opened in
[1:06:24] 1963
[1:06:27] and god come down
[1:06:30] he began
[1:06:40] you know people still can't see it
[1:06:43] but the truth of the matter
[1:06:53] and he's changing her it is from glory
[1:06:57] to glory
[1:07:12] now you said well what do you mean
[1:07:14] brother brooks
[1:07:16] the prophet god always refers
[1:07:19] to abraham and sarah
[1:07:21] hallelujah amen and when god told
[1:07:24] abraham
[1:07:39] god begin to change her commands are
[1:07:43] chances
[1:07:44] hallelujah amen is that right
[1:07:47] and the prophet god likened isaac and
[1:07:49] the prophet to come exactly as unto the
[1:07:51] rapture
[1:07:53] hallelujah receiving the promised son
[1:07:58] hallelujah
[1:07:59] preach this whether you like it or not

[1:31:47] the bible said we are accepted
[1:31:51] to me if because he was accepted
[1:31:55] i am accepted
[1:32:33] it is our responsibility
[1:32:36] to tell people about what god has done
[1:32:38] in this
[1:32:50] i looked and beheld the door was open in
[1:32:52] heaven

[1:33:58] a king cell
[1:33:59] and that door is jesus christ hey sit
[1:34:00] back to say listen
[1:34:02] so that you can understand

[1:35:06] the character of christ
[1:35:09] that is the only way the gate is going
[1:35:10] home
[1:35:26] that these
[1:35:41] they are two different
[1:35:44] separate times
[1:35:46] and so on
[1:35:47] two different and some different
[1:35:49] separate people and sunday

[1:37:14] god is more than able
[1:37:18] to bring his word
[1:37:30] it will have to be the royal seed of the
[1:37:32] word
[1:37:35] through abraham
[1:37:37] the royal seed
[1:37:39] that's why the rapture has to be first
[1:37:44] shown is that right amen now we know
[1:37:48] lucifer that the the the the church the
[1:37:51] ignis is being bundled
[1:37:54] or abandoned they're being bundled first
[1:37:59] all of the

[1:43:54] is that the power of god
[1:43:56] comes to take away every speck of the
[1:43:58] world set with songs that's the truth
[1:44:00] right
[1:44:04] the word of god says
[1:44:06] if the love of the world is in you
[1:44:09] the love of god is not

[1:45:44] okay i read that and the rest of the
[1:45:46] dead lived not
[1:45:48] four thousand years
[1:45:51] huh that was part of that quote
[1:45:53] let me read the whole thing all the way
