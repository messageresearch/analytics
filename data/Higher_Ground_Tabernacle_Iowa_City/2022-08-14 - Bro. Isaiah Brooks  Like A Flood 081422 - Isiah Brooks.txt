hello when we come to the church as the prophet said come the prophet to be better christians better brothers better neighbors the if you are not serious there is someone who is serious he is making himself ready everything god has given us today two seconds to be ready we have all the pride is coming soon but the problem is may the problem make you hallelujah you know the wedding who is delaying the wedding hallelujah the bride is ready the bridegroom i'm not not the bridegroom the bride i'm sorry bridegroom is ready you know if the pastor pastor if you want to celebrate answer but if the

[Music] [Music] i said lord [Music] victory [Music] [Music] [Music] i thought it was your birthday praise the lord amen thank you amen well celebration amen amen we thank god for his grace and his mercy as we stand we're just going to unlock some of the wounds along with you turn with us to saint john the 14th chapter saint john we read the 30th and the 31st verse there and then we'll go to ephesians 2. we read the first two verses of ephesians 2. one thing i do appreciate our brother elsine saying [Music] i believe that it's more serious than most people uh realize god is moving in a certain direction that if we don't it will be left and i behind by the grace of god god will open our eyes understanding to recognize who we are and what we have come forward let's go to the scripture now [Music] john 14 30-31 hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and have nothing in me but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandments even so i do arise let us go hence [Music] [Music] foreign we're going to read the first two verses and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein time passed you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience once again approach your holy throne in falcons are portioned [Music] we are the prophecy in the prophecy that has been prophesied we are the ones the psalmist that have come to vindicate or to make vindicate [Music] [Music] [Music] break the amen amen you may be seated we have come at a time that that is real it how can i say it it's very serious [Music] and and if we we don't allow the holy spirit to focus on the in saint john i so appreciate the lord jesus for the one thing he said there in the 30th verse he said that satan is coming is that there is no darkness in me there is nothing that satan can pull from me to make me fall to make me bow hallelujah [Music] hallelujah amen but man i will allow him to take my life depending on my view so that i might rise again so that the world will know this testimony is true hallelujah see jesus was fully aware of who he was hallelujah and he understood the journey in which he had to take live affair hallelujah amen he understood jesus that he had this that he had to he said i must go away so that the father was sin hallelujah and we understand who the comforter is [Music] however you like a flood like a flood and the reasons why it's because brother branham teaches us i'm saying that the lid that was once on hell the top the lid that was once on here [Music] and all of the demons that destroyed the world in the days of noah has now been set free we have seen by way of history what they did to germany secondly in that portion of the world and had not god intervened the world in itself would have been destroyed hallelujah amen but god intervened and brother branham tells us that those demons left germany and came to the west coast is they became what we call hollywood song they need to continue west oh come on hollywood now you must understand they have an agenda from an agenda they have a plan for my employ and that plan is to destroy a surplus the bride of jesus christ hallelujah amen remember it was the angel stop the four winds hallelujah from destroying the earth because the servants of god [Music] because now this is the ceiling time hallelujah amen but the demons are moving in such a way they are now when we talk about a flood menace first of all we must understand who's god of this age brother said god he's not god it's not god of this age but satan is god of this age hello amen jesus will be god jesus he is the god of this evil age says [Music] this is the darkness of all darkness [Music] and in his way of doing things [Music] we're dealing with demonic power eli wiggly lapiso [Music] [Music] the prince of the air the lair amen i'm not talking about the air you breathe i'm talking about the dimension of air measure hallelujah [Music] he is blinding the people to blind the people against the word of god the world the very thing he did to eddie he's now doing it to the people today hallelujah there's only one people whose minds he don't uh say he cannot blind don't legible and that is the bride of jesus [Music] and you cannot be deceived how can i say it brother brandon was the prophet but it's moved from the prophet to the prophet to the prophecy hallelujah amen you and i must understand whose name of the victim that we are the prophecy [Music] [Music] but [Music] no matter how wounded the dove [Music] see there is a people and people there is a people that will see and understand this message hallelujah she may not be great in numbers but there is a selected yeah there's some people that god has ordained right and purple selection to see what malachi was all about hallelujah amen you know everybody wait till morning that heard john the baptist he wanted didn't understand what john the baptist ministry was all about the minister some of them thought john the baptist was there just to rebuke [Music] um his ministry was coming to an indian there's so [Music] there's one that's greater than one [Music] and when jesus came hey conscious you have any let me say it again let's see what they do when jesus did come here john the baptist jean-luc batista saw the pillar yeah somebody helped me here nyc he saw the people of a thought elizabeth singing out of heaven come in columbus and he sat upon jesus himself said colon [Music] listen john look to his disciples say this is the lamb [Music] taking away the sins of the world amen would you know what ma'am and we find that still today [Music] through all those years he for all those years he kept saying that he is here he let us see he's here he let us see he is here he let us see hallelujah he even tried to show the people they said the first one was on fire don't you see him two seconds oh but glory ah in 1963 something happened come on somebody amen seven angels of god and the cloud was full [Music] [Music] he said this is my lord hallelujah amen why did jesus come he came to vindicate himself jesus christ yesterday [Applause] but that was just [Music] that was just the beginning of my from the prophet said the prophet allah prophecy hallelujah heaven hallelujah amen they had no idea but now the almighty god command legion [Music] [Music] revelation the third chapter [Music] [Music] [Music] when they should have been following god they didn't even see when the ministry changed you know men perfect here yeah man yeah they didn't see it are we you know they can't say i think they were just he maybe they thought they would just he was giving them knowledge hallelujah that was my casual death sentence of jesus christ declaring unto her the battle has been fought baptized victory is one [Music] and on top amen [Music] how often best of all we find ourselves thinking in a way that is not scriptural killer and whenever we find ourselves thinking hey move where you are negative manner negative that is the prince of the prince of the power of the air the character [Music] he made eve doubt in the word hello somebody a man he used her reasoning he likes to say hallelujah [Music] and that's what he's telling the people now tablet under the jewel i can make it better [Music] what can wash away my you can't do it [Music] the lamb of god [Music] [Music] and you're in his target hello you are his target was this for my son oh you're gonna get scared now huh no no because the bible says the [Music] and that's god himself he ain't jailed the lord encamps about me you understand what i'm saying

spiritual and it is the enemy's wrath against you country standard had the syrians looking for elijah [Music] [Music] god will always protect [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Applause] with a great cloud of witnesses [Music] somebody hurry and when god opened up your haze's eyes again hallelujah church of fire [Applause] satan is mounting up a flood garden jesus christ has told us that the

that's true universal that old devil with that old cigarette that old nicotine i'm just saying that god is missing somebody you know he'll take that person in the winter in the cold before with a cigarette but and if you look at those people they look like it it tastes so good you fit them up for the old man really female come see the fit before and then they blow that and you think it got to be good for them to stand out in the cold like that especially somebody help me here amen i know those demons are hard to overcome what am i doing back slid one of my daughters backslidden my fears overcoming that devil vanquishes what happened she got pregnant i might need to say that but she got pregnant by her husband [Music] y'all so quiet like y'all think somebody told me something ain't nobody talk to me but jesus i hope you get that respect nobody's don't you understand let me move on quickly just give me 20 more minutes don't kick me because the flood is devastating it literally changed the contour of the earth but hallelujah you all remember when that tsunami hit the tsunami the bible said be likened unto a wise man who has built his house upon him so that when the storm comes when the flood came gone upon the rocks [Music] who built his house upon hallelujah you [Music] you have built your house i've got i've got some good quotes let me find some quotes real quick brother said the wisdom of satan which he gives at the beginning he says now listen don't miss this the wisdom of satan now that's how he exalted himself hallelujah glorified oh yeah we he's above the vindicated word of god for the hour exactly oh hallelujah [Music] and sometimes i wonder what tapes are you listening to the first with there's a little things i was telling the brother the other day did you desire not afraid you i said did you know that brother branham said that a woman can go to hell i think uh she could be holy ghost phil them high-heeled shoes gonna get you hey especially if you got to run especially i know what i'm talking about let me tell you sisters you may not see it like a man see it but you can wear your pants this is the way i see it and i know i got the holy ghost high-heeled [Music] i don't care if everything else is looking good i think the world the world worldliness i know some of y'all need to be delivered but we're going to pray for your deliverance and if you need that code i'll find it for you there is a pentecostal sister yeah she was full of the holy ghost and brother saw her walking the narrow way you cannot walk that narrow way it got narrower narrower she came to a point he fell off into the flame of fire [Music] see you can obey every word but one with every verb and you can have your soul [Music] it is serious cecelia hallelujah amen and on another note and um if i'm ever preaching in the area see you appreciate and you feel like you got to wear your high-heeled shoes don't let nobody know you come from our church that sounds rough but i mean especially especially if you're not a babe in christ a special message we met by a bigger christian you understand me yes you know babe in christ we can deal with that god [Music] [Music] because i can't by the renewing of your mind be you transformed i'm not i'm just by the renewing of your mind i'm not reading the scripture brother oh okay to make a thorough a thorough or dramatic change in foreign y'all believe the word you know and i'm getting ready to close because i i won't my theme would be you should press call of duty preparing yourself you say preparations it ain't about being successful in this world anymore and all these other things will be added [Music] just so you know i mean read another quote you know just a small one from god of this evil age and when the church world would not have the word of god to rule over them listen e to lord it means to lord over you whatever the word says is what i'll do two seconds behold jesus you say i love the lord and you won't do what he says and when the church world would not have the word of god to rule over them [Music] [Music] saturn you read that i'm going to exalt myself above the stars of god they said and chose that's when satan was able to move they said they said and they're going to crown him at the end you understand me what he always wanted even when he was in it when they rejected jesus tell me what i'm saying so let me put it in your in your lap become a for satan is not spoke of as a god in any other age but this one [Music] he once spoke of god of the age of noah he was not he wasn't spoke of god in the age of noah he once spoke of god in the age of moses [Music] i don't care if i didn't preach nothing if you don't understand and hear nothing i said tonight or today lord teach me how to please give is that right connection you must be connected [Music] you need to be connected and you ain't in your right mind either if was it man if you're going to choose the world over the world can i say that if i can make somebody mad you might remember perfect [Music] there's something wrong with you too yeah are you going to trade the world for the word when you see this thing falling apart everybody can see let's go how long do you how long do you think it's going to last a long time can you give me five more minutes just for that minute let's just just use america because america she influences are you aware of that also in 2024 i believe we'll go there just making sure you have it because america must retake power first episode this thing is coming from this thing is coming from rome says and what we fail to see is that rome has everything in order to conquer you must you must divide vancouver shipping us into pieces division genders they got going on until your mind doesn't know what to think jesus christ foreign keep your mind on the word of god hallelujah there was only one window in the ark one person and i don't believe noah was out there looking no regarding i don't think he was out there looking to see what was happening out there outside of the arc our [Music] but you won't be overtaken imported that's a promise it's all a promise i don't know whether anyway let's stay on people i always put too many notes in there but i i i say those people of god i don't i don't i don't preach to be famous [Music] i don't care about the praise of men [Music] like brother adam said everybody likes a compliment every now and again there's not one person i'm pointing my finger at you if the word strikes you it's not trying to do something you know i want you to understand i tried your best every service wherever when the ceiling is over [Music] when the ceiling of the bride is over i trust all of us will be there that is going to be a horrifying experience if you left behind for something that really doesn't matter everything that satan has built [Music] your family tree can't get you in uh your looks can't get you in what are perhaps the people there's only one key that can open [Music] lift up your hands all your gates hold it and let the king of glory come in hello you see he had a a great host of people behind him have ever minded me to do this maybe paul was there you know you know not paul but you know the old testament saints were there their names weren't going to open their gate only the one who triumphed mr
