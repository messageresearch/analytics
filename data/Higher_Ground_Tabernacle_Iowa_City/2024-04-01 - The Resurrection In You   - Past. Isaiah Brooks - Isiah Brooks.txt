all the time but seeing that the world has noted this day as Easter we want to show the Lord Jesus Christ how much we appreciate the sacrifice the [Music] sacrifice hallelujah amen as we stand let's turn to Isaiah [Music] 52 I don't know about you this morning but I am so glad I'm saved words cannot express my gratitude toward the lord Jesus Christ for this day of Resurrection where he proved to the world that he was and is the messiah the world still hates him you know you can say God you can say the word Lord but when you say Jesus the world gets stirred the worldred because they hate that name they've tried to kill it for thousands of years and it's still as powerful As It Ever [Music] Was the Bible said that the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that he is Lord to the glory of the father hallelujah amen beginning at the first [Music] verse it says awake awake put on thy strength oh Zion put on the beautiful garments oh jerusem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into Thee the uncircumcised and the unclean Shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down oh Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck oh captive Daughter of Zion for thus sayith the Lord you have sold yourself for not and ye shall be redeemed without money amen let us pray dear heavenly father God how my heart is so thrilled this morning because of what you've done for me 2,000 years ago and you're still the same Lord whenever I need you you're there whenever I fall you pick me up when I'm troubled in mind you give me [Music] peace when I'm sick you make me well when I need a friend you always my words cannot express my gratitude this morning I pray for the service this morning the service is not a service without you I pray that you're anointed will just move in the house break and Destroy every anointing Lord everything is not right before you Lord every dark space I pray that the light of the word word would drive it away help us now Lord Jesus keep us in your care in your lovely name Jesus we pray amen amen you may be seated I just want to say I thought the wedding went well last yesterday everything was lovely we appreciate everyone who showed up to support I'm sure our brother Christian and his wife Martin appreciated it chis Martin yeah I appreciate it and so I just got wor they wanted to thank you all everything you did for them so amen we just thank God for God's goodness there are two things I hate doing and that's weddings and funerals just so you know why just so you know but we do it anyway because it's so structured not going to go through all of that but we do the will of the father regardless to what I feel like and it's not anything personal against my wife said I've done that I mean uh my wife knows and she says I give too much information amen so if there's another wedding and and and and I'm here and you want me to do it well don't let what I just said God is good to us I love the wedding ceremony only when someone else is doing it so that you understand me God is good to us people and I love you all I really do I one thing I was thinking about in the office and I was thinking about Bram talks about Mr [Music] Lily Mr Lily and how the Lily starts in a muddy place but it grows up to be one of the most beautiful flowers and this is what I was thinking about you all we may have had a tough beginning but I believe the ending will be beautiful I believe that with all of my heart so we just want to encourage the saints of God here no matter what comes your way God has ordain you to be a light in this place hallelujah amen my subject this morning would be the resurrection in you I preached this Wednesday in De Mo because I wasn't going to be there today so I'm kind of working this thing in two ways this is part two but in order for me to preach part two must part one first because I believe the Resurrection is of no value to anyone except that Resurrection be in you the very fact that Jesus died and rose again is historically known but it's of no value other than history to those who have not made Jesus their choice in this message you and I have been so blessed because we've seen Jesus Even in our day amen hallelujah amen we're not worshiping a Jesus that is 2,000 years ago but we're worshiping a Jesus that visited Us in this day in the son of man Ministry Hallelujah we may have guessed what Jesus was like 2,000 years ago but we know by God's grace he cannot change his character hallelujah amen so when a son of man was introducing the son of man we saw Jesus Christ as he would operate as a prophet Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying so the prophet of God encouraged us not to be not to ever become fund Al Hallelujah he taught us that the Church of the Living God must be a church that has power and authority hallelujah amen he thought he taught us that the Church of the Living God would be omnipotent and not by their own power but because the omnipotent God dwells within them Hallelujah and the Covenant that God has given us has been shown by way of Samson Hallelujah Samson was chosen to destroy the Philistines but Samson fell to Delilah is that right amen and Delilah was a type of the world but one day Samson after being defeated after being mocked and scorned something began to churn within his heart and he came to recognize that the Covenant that he had with God had been restored Hallelujah and at that time he cried out oh Lord once more and the god of Samson came on the scene Hallelujah the thing that I love about Samson is that he fulfilled his mission Hallelujah am yes sir so much so the Bible tells us that Samson killed more Philistine in his death that he did while he was living and the prophet of God says we must die to the world in order to be victorious hallelujah amen we must be those who will celebrate the death burier and resurrection of Jesus Christ Hallelujah not as a historical monument but we celebrate him because we know that he's alive and well oh some of y'all being quiet see the resurrection it doesn't mean that something else comes in place of something that went down in other words if a tree dies goes to the Grave if there's a resurrection the same tree that went down comes up Hallelujah so if there is a resurrection of Jesus it it just wasn't there in uh uh the time when Jesus died but we're talking about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ for our day is that right amen hallelujah amen we understand Jesus was in the grave for three uh three uh three days hallelujah but the Bible says that he would not leave his soul in Hell neither will he allow his flesh to seek corruption Hallelujah and we understand that Jesus went to hell because he became our sin that we might become his righteousness hallelujah amen now we must understand that he became our sin that we might become his righteousness and the righteousness of God is not something you earn it is a gift of God hallelujah am my question this morning if Jesus Christ Christ is alive and well where is he hallelujah amen William brandom has gone he's in the other dimension but the Bible said God never left himself without a witness me he's alive hallelujah amen he's taking on another body another form Hallelujah this is what brother brandom describe as the god of imor Hallelujah and what did God do instead of just taking on another form he took on the form of his wife he calls her the bride Hallelujah and this woman called The Bride has been redeemed by his blood Hallelujah not only just redeemed but she is to be filled with the spirit is that right correct brother Brandon preached the statue of a perfect man and in that message he described the divine nature of God hallelujah well the bride is supposed to be Tabernacles of God's divine nature hallelujah amen now y'all getting quiet on me but let me give you a quote here you know because we look at at the day there people think because I call myself a message believer that guarantees me heaven it does not it didn't work for the Baptist it didn't work for the Methodist it didn't work for the Lutheran it didn't work for the apostolic or the Hallelujah and it will not work for the message you see because this message is a message of election this message is a message of predestination Hallelujah this message it's for a special class of people hallelujah amen now realize this according to the scripture Israel came out of Egypt but all who claim to be Israelites Israel were not chosen by God they were not of the chosen seed so when God calls out Hallelujah he calls out twins every Revival produce twins Hallelujah you've got the real seed and you have the false seed Hallelujah am one is fundamental one is intellectual and the other one is holy ghost fi Hallelujah now listen what brother I'm saying hallelujah coming from the message the resurrection of Lazarus par 11 he said you know sometimes I think that wonder how the Lord feels about us sometimes when he does so many things for us and yet we just set like we were in in a subconsciously don't we he said aren't we all guilty he said I am we just sit and say I wish you do something for me Hallelujah brother says he can't do nothing nothing no more for us than what he's already done he's already healed us he's already saved us he's already given us joy he he's G us his peace he's our Shield our buckler everything we have is in him and he done and he done paid the price of redemption to redeem us back as Sons and Daughters of God think about it how we treat him hallelujah amen when he's done everything we act as if he's done nothing there's only one thing in the world that is yet left undone that is a physical death we all got to die because that was the only way God has to bring us up her home the only we can travel is through death to get home so everything is under his feet everything except death and death has done been uh done been the penalty of death done been taken off and now we just go right into to the presence and someday back someday return back and he may made Immortal and life and live on earth a thousand years but let me pause here when you are truly born again you do not fear death most people people can't get their healings most people can't get a healing because they are afraid to die but if you push death out of the way cancer will mean nothing to you y'all hear what I'm saying amen the strongest demon that Satan has is greater than cancer it's greater than tuberculosis greater than diabetes greater than any other demon and the chief demon Of Satan is unbelief y'all hear what I'm saying because if you believe God cancer won't stand in the way is that what God told Brother bam he said if you can get the people to believe all things are possible Hallelujah am is that the truth and the Bride of Jesus Christ she is a Believer Hallelujah am no matter what comes her way she knows that God is more than able hallelujah amen Rejoice people of God if God is in you it he's a God that created heaven and earth he's a God that created of the universe he's a God that created time and space he's a God that created heaven and earth God that created you hallelujah amen what more can he do is there anything too hard for God and because God is wrapped in my [Music] flesh because God is wrapped in my flesh it does not make him weak amen because God is in your flesh it does not make him weak but the only way God can act upon his word that you have faith in his word hallelujah amen hallelujah amen brother bam talks in a story here and he said he was on this road in the woods and he came against upon these trees and these trees had all been burnt down burnt up Hallelujah and he somewhat wondered what happened but I'll describe what he what he describes he said the fires of persecution have burnt them and the members have come in and the members has come in got ritualistic form in ungodliness and burnt the bar off of them and they are nothing but a dead bunch of Representatives see what he's saying if you're not careful trials tribulation the fires of the devil will burn you so much Hallelujah can I say it like this Satan can allow you can allow Satan to enter your heart soep until you become just a representative of the Y understand me amen you look like the message hallelujah amen but there's death in you I'm not accusing anybody but I'm trying to tell you that you can fall into if you let your trials defeat you Hallelujah he said there's nothing but a dead bunch of Representatives only to groan and moan and make a lot of fussing about something God's doing and you know that's how it is in every Church you got the groaners and the moaners you got people complaining about everything hallelujah amen you got people sitting in here that don't even like me but I don't care I pray for people God deliver them give them Victory hallelujah amen I'm not here to scone because everybody have their issu hear what I'm saying but the devil is out to kill you but we are here to represent truth and totality resurrection of Jesus Christ what good what what good is it to claim you in the message and you got nothing to prove when the last you had a testimony when the last you brought somebody to Jesus come on somebody we don't want to be just something representing the message must the message this is what the resurrection was all about so many of us think we got the Holy Ghost when all we got is religion I'm just preaching it straight but there was something going on under those big trees you you ought to hear the tape brother said they just [Music] moan can't even hard to get him happy no more hallelujah amen but he said but there's the undergrowth coming up I will restore said the Lord all that the disciples had y'all hear what he said he said all that the disciples had I will restore all they did back there I will restore say the Lord I said Thank You Lord this what my brother said he said I had a spasm nearly out there my horse likeed to run away I jumped up on the log I shouted I screamed I run down the path I jumped up and down throw my head up in the air shot my gun Up in the Air Boom Hallelujah scream he said somebody would have thought they had a maniac out there brother bam said he just thought about it I will restore and that was enough y'all hear what I'm saying that was enough to get him going something happened on the inside Hallelujah the word of God ought to set somebody on the fire this morning Hallelujah well maybe y'all I let me go on with this because there's a hindering spirit in here and I don't like it be careful God will judge you for it whatever you doing in your mind you better change your mind on whatever you doing God don't like that what was it he said I will restore said I was glad that the Holy Ghost was moving in my heart and it is now to I will restore said the Lord hallelujah he says oh that they they took out a healing out of here they took out shouting out here they took speaking tongues out of here they prophesied out of here they took it out but I will restore said the Lord hallelujah amen he said I feel religious my I feel twice myself and I I just stuck this in it what was the prophet seeing he was seeing another generation people that was going to come up message that was not going to be ashame of him and that was going to absolutely be a revival going on Hallelujah right now we supposed to be celebrating the resurrection and many of us sitting in here like we celebrating the crucifixion Hallelujah where is the joy of the Lord hallelujah amen you ought to say I know where it's at whatever the joy of the Lord is in me hallelujah amen brother said I believe in the resurrection I believe in a body a physical body change I have I believe in a body physical Resurrection I believe in the physical body return of Jesus Christ I believe that his church in his representative on the earth now I believe his church is a representative of him on the Earth right now Hallelujah you know if you're a true representative The Authority given to you is given from him that's why he said these signs shall follow them hallelujah amen my God and the church is a Holy Ghost Field Church Hallelujah preachers Holiness to the very streem let me read that again some of y'all think I get too legalistic brother and the church is a holy ghost filled Church preaches Holiness to the very extremes he said don't you think so Hallelujah so I'm not out of order but anyway with this power of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen you know uh with the power of the Holy Ghost it's just not the Holy Ghost let me ask you a question how many of you have had an experience with an angel did you know that those the angels are there for you did you know as a New Testament Church that you have Guardian Angels these are not my this is this is a Propet I'm going to read it in just a moment so not just like I got the Holy Ghost but God I have an angel that has been appointed to me apped to you to make sure you come out right hallelujah amen don't you know those same angels will go before God and tell on you hallelujah amen your best friend don't have to tell your story your next door neighbor don't have to tell your story Hallelujah you've got angel that goes straight to the throne of God and tell God what you're doing see y'all think y'all by yourself and nobody don't see you God sees everything hallelujah amen God always SE his warnings just before the coming of Jesus he sent an angel down Out Of Heaven by the name of Gabriel now minor Angels comes he he says my yes you see Angels everyone has a guard and an angel according to the scripture Jesus said their Angels always behold my father's face which is in heaven Hallelujah here's some time ago a minister told me said brother Bram there's no such a thing as seeing Angels Angels don't lead the church the Holy Ghost leads the church I said that's right but we have angels being as ministering Spirits sent from the presence of God hallelujah amen was Jesus Christ God did he not have an angel come to strengthen him just so you know Hallelujah even Jesus had an angel he said well our church don't believe in that I said don't you know your church believes he said I don't know excuse me I don't know what your church believes I I know what the Bible teaches and he said well brother Bram Angels might have been back in Daniel's time and back there but not since the Holy Ghost has come no angels I had a brother come to me a young man and I thought he was coming to know more about the truth because he wanted to be a preacher but he came to my office with a big old envelope of stuff this is and he came to disprove that brother Brandon Was Elijah and then he came with the NIV version Oh the NIV version what is NIV NIV say what different from the King James version hallelujah amen I told him right off that ain't no good I say they change words in that Bible he said don't you know God protects his Bibles I said yeah but men still get in there and I told him I said I believe the King James version he said you mean to tell me if somebody uh uh read another uh version other than King James he can't be saved I said you not going to twist me up in that I said if a man is ignorant as a rock see if he's ignorant as a rock and he wants to know God hallelujah God will reveal himself hallelujah amen and I threw him out the window not literally I said you don't need all that Greek you don't you don't you don't need all of that kind of stuff I said you come to me telling me about your theological experience and I tried to tell him Mama couldn't read or right and she knew God hallelujah am you don't need all of that to be saved and he tried to prove to me brother I tell you what he covered every ground he going to use Luke to try to tell me that John the Baptist filled all the scripture I said no sir I said some scriptures have a do meaning I said did not God said I call my son Israel out of Egypt I said in one occasion he was talking about the children of Israel I said in the second occasion he was talking about Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah am I said was it not true that Jesus said in three days you can destroy this temple in three days raise it back up I said and those false uh accusers repeated exactly what Jesus said and the Bible call them false Witnesses I said man I said it's not the literal word it is the revelation of the word they did not have and because they did not have the true revelation of false Witnesses well he got so nervous eventually said it was time to go I said okay then give me I said uh you called me by surprise I said you got my number send me some more questions and we'll come back in a few days I'm still waiting on the questions you understand me what was that as simple as that was that resurrection that was Jesus expressing himself by way of the truth there was no fear I mean he's he's you know he's got one more year in this Theological Seminary and I told him I said God I said God has his hand on you well I used to be a moment I said I see where you're coming from because you had a false prophet think now that there are no more Prophet Hallelujah but God has sent you for me to help you now it's up to you to accept it Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying all right some of y'all must have stayed late last night you love the Lord let me finish this quote he said well brother bam Angels might have been seen in Daniel's time and back there but not since the Holy Ghost has come no no angels I said do you believe that Phillip had the Holy Ghost certainly well who was he come to who was it come to him and told him to leave that great Revival they was having and go out into the desert to meet the Ethiopian I said was it the Holy [Applause] Spirit no sir the angel of the Lord come to him is that right correct philli had the Holy Ghost how many people believe Peter had the Holy Ghost you all do well who was it that night when he was in jail that was going to cut his head off the next morning Hallelujah they was having a prayer meeting down at John Mar's house who was it shine in there fire light come and hung over him and touched him and raised him up and dropped the shackles off of him opened up the doors and set him out on the street and the angel of the Lord that's exactly he had the Holy Ghost now I don't prove the point there but what was it what is it these people live so close to God the angel could visit them is that right brother bam said it like this he said you can have your house so clean and in order you will have a visitation from an angel hallelujah amen yall understand me what what I'm trying to get us to see and I'm not going to hold you too much see maybe it's just warm in here and y'all going to sleep anyhow you know but the point is you you got to realize if you just going to walk as a SoCal Christian this church well I'm waiting for the squeeze well all I know is that the in choosing of a bride I believe it was brother said that that young lady was already in the door waiting for Jesus waiting for her husband understand you can't you can't plan when you see the pressure coming you got to make yourself ready now and if you don't see Jesus in you problem you got to get down on your knee hallelujah amen many many of us just too busy to really have prayer time with God hallelujah you know Daniel just didn't be he wasn't just praying three times a day just to do it there was a love affair that was going on is that the truth listen how many times you call your best friend a day you don't say oh I done call them three times already and it doesn't matter how how busy you are when your best friend calls you you stop whatever you're doing if it's just for the moment to tell them listen I'm busy I'll call you back later Hallelujah why because there is a love relationship there and when you have a love relationship Jesus it's just not a set time to pray you're praying like the word God says without ceasing you pray when you get up you pray during the daytime you pray in the evening you pray at night can tell I'm right now speaking a foreign language to you but it's true it's true anyhow I'm trying to tell you we're not where we supposed to be just for the fact you're not you're not trying to muster up energy to even say Amen that demon of heat said oh man I'm sleeping how much long he going be Hallelujah I know the thoughts because that's exactly what the devil has told me in glory to God but if if he he didn't think this message was necessary would not be trying to make you go to sleep hallelujah amen oh come on somebody think about it if we are to be the Christ no weapon do y'all believe that scripture no weapon formed against you shall the reason why we're defeated because we don't know how to wait on God and brother said we must wait on God and wait for God hallelujah lean not to your own understanding God do you realize there were situations that brother Bram didn't even know about and God didn't tell him the full story Hallelujah you remember the Ana the Ana the old colored woman Mama God told him to walk he was supposed to catch a plane how many you would have done that God said no don't miss this flight or sit here I got somebody I need you to witness to how many of us would have done that Hallelujah he could care less he began to walk you understand me what was it it was the Jesus in him hallelujah amen Jesus said Lord I've done all all that you told me to do everything you told me to do I did it hallelujah amen is that right you told me to go to Simon's house I went there I knew the scone that was going to come with that but in spite of what they were going to say about me humbled myself to do it yall understand me yall Think Jesus wasn't a man he was a man but there was God in the Man in Christ in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead fin he was a man he could cry he could seal he had to sleep he had to eat Hallelujah and he knew when people didn't like him is that the truth said I know when they don't like me they said I love you my brother he said and I knew they were lying understand what was it that's God in the man but he didn't push him away said get on he loved them anyway Hallelujah if somebody don't love you it doesn't mean you not you don't you you you you need not to love them hallelujah what you going to do with the scripture when the Bible said love even thine enemy y'all say this is Elementary I'm going tell and you're not doing it so if you're not doing it it's algebra to you when you're doing it you can call it Elementary when you're doing it you can call Hallelujah you understand me but this is the word oh is that right is that correct God keep you out of trouble too brother Bram had enough God in him God warned him if you don't move Westward you going beat this man up you going to beat this man up you fight him y'all remember that dream had a dream about the tree and how they were going to uproot the tree or whatever the case may be and this man who was the one who was doing the work s brother Bram and brother brandham beat him up him kick him down the hill all of that that was a dream and God told him if you don't move this what going to happen yall understand what I'm trying Hallelujah now I'm I'm not going to care too much long CU yall not going to oh my God y'all to see what I see up here it's all right it's all right my question is who is inside of you this is what I'm trying my question who's inside I'm not talking about the anointing anointing you I'm talking about who's inside of you understand me now who's inside of you I want you to think about it think about if he is inside of you the only reason why he's not active is because you don't believe it is so is that right brother BR say you could have the Holy Ghost a't that's something you can actually have the god of Heaven in you and don't even know it because a lot of people still rest on feelings instead of instead of resting on the promised word devil got you doing the same stuff you always used to do and you know it's wrong because you feel you don't have it no that's not true hallelujah amen if you've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal you already passed from Death unto life hallelujah amen the thing is you got to keep feeding it the word hallelujah amen he's in there who do you think tells you don't do this don't think that don't go this way go this way it's the Holy Ghost it's God trying to keep you straight Hallelujah the Bible said out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Waters hallelujah hallelujah the Holy Ghost is a fire hallelujah how can a fire be burning here and you don't see the the effects of it on the outside hallelujah amen I'm almost done hallelujah amen I told you we was going to have a good time having a good time now what good is it brother Bram bring us all this message and you're not feasting on it now all y'all knew y'all had church last night y'all knew y'all had church this morning and you should have been aware of that don't get sad but now we're suffering we spent too much time last night out there you understand and now that you oh I had a great time but look what the great time is costing you I don't know what all God wanted to give you this morning but he can't give it to you if you're not pulling on it I'm just saying the next wedding if I'm there the next time I'm going to scream out time up there you go so that when we come to church I don't care if you're leaning halfway on the floor I love you I love you I love you Amen Let me let me let me uh a quote I want to read here before letting you go is that okay you love the Lord but I guarantee you after service you're going to wake up Promise You Against All Odds a hidden a hidden life this is the quote I'm going to end up the service with have you ever come to to the place in life where Christ meant more to you than all the arguing you could do has Christ meant more to you than all the world I don't mean from an emotion or a mental workup I mean from the depths of your heart that something settled in there something taken place that you don't know how it come but you hear away and your whole emot your whole motive is to serve Jesus Christ have you entered that place my dear [Music] brother have you come into that place where you don't care what anyone says not to go out and act smart but to the love of God Is So anchored into you that you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of God love for everybody flowing free from everywhere he says what a place to [Music] live that's the hidden place that's the place where we got to come to my that's the place where God reveals the secret things that's the place where God does the placing and the calling so everything I've tried to say this morning I summarized it in one quote and this message is the hidden life in 195 my question this morning is if the Rapture had taken place this morning who would have been prepared who would have been who can truly say I'm ready I've made brother vom said I believe the Rapture will happen in at the spring time he said I I don't know for certain he said but that's where Life Begin that's in the spring and he said I believe that's when it's going to happen he said but whenever it happen I just want to be part of it hallelujah amen and if we go on with nature according to the Jewish law this is the time of the Jewish New Year how can we have a new year in the winter right New Year is New Life hallelujah amen you know somebody might even think me think I'm fanatic but I say if you going to Cate you at least ought to celebrate it in April [Laughter] but y'all know what I'm saying I'm on the air people say you know brother went really fanatic now that's when the Lambs are born right one more one more quote I'm going let you go please coming from the way back 1962 the way back 1962 paragraph 23 I will let you go at this one God has always got a People somewhere that he may point to and say that's it oh I want to be among that number I'm sure we all want to be there it's the desire of every heart we want to be among that number that God can say this is my people look at them they are an example of what I am they are my reflecting my life in there they have surrendered their life and I'm reflecting my life what a beautiful thing how it must make God feel good to know that he has got somebody can put trust in let's stand amen I press toward the mar of a high calling which is in Christ Jesus it is a press it is a press but God expect expects us to press I'll tell you when we see uh the message or the people of God beginning to really uh rally the Holy Ghost we'll know that the the the Rapture is at hand for the most part because it's by one Spirit are we baptized into one body not by one denomination not by one organiz not because I believe this message devil believe the message and he trembles is how much of the message that I can see in you how much of the message you can see in me it's more than singing it's more than preaching it's more than testifying it's a live life those virtues those Thunders uttering and and speaking through you Hallelujah is that right you become the manifestation of the open book that's what God is looking for he said when I see the blood and said the life of the blood is what God is looking for so when I see the Life of Christ I will pass over you hallelujah amen that's what he's looking for the Life of Christ in individuals Hallelujah cuz anybody can belong to a club hallelujah amen but God is asking you to belong to his body the only way that you can belong in the body of Christ is to have that baptism of the Holy I know it doesn't stop there because we're in a day of maturity we're in a day of a of the Capstone Hallelujah and like I try to tell people I had a brother come to me the other day he said I didn't know the Cornerstone in the Capstone was the same and I'm thinking to myself you are a preacher how can you not know the Bible said the Cornerstone which is Jesus Christ has become the head of the corner C of the pyramid how can you not that know that and that Cornerstone was a holy ghost Hallelujah and that headstone is the Holy Ghost in full hallelujah amen full manifestation that's where we at in this day I just want to encourage you that it doesn't matter how much religion you think you have how much you think you we're living in a day where every man is ring his own Hallelujah but the judge of who you are actually judging the life he sees in you Hallelujah you got to love your brothers you got to love your sisters you got to love your enemies you got love love love no hatred has a hatred has no place in the bride hatred has no place in the bride and and if you have some kind of hatred some kind of art maybe the person don't even go to this church uh it doesn't matter you still got to get rid of that can rid of that you can't only God can wash the heart with your confession you must be willing to surrender he is the Potter and we are the clay love the Lord we thank you I trust something was said this morning amen and I I I told the Lord I wanted him to take full control of the service in my mind I want to real shout and good time the Lord will be done I guess the most important thing is that the word found place in your heart amen you love Lord let's pray if there be anybody that desire prayer you can come up and I'll pray for you [Music] [Music] Jesus pray for my precious bless him now

the sisters uh that came up and I hope they don't mind me telling you and and I would say 90% of the uh young ladies were suffering from some kind of anxiety I I don't she uh [Music] [Music] I don't know what's going on and why Satan f is fighting you with this but the devil is a liar uh you're the Bride of Jesus and and and you know even at times when I'm preaching I I try to preach Hope and Faith the words that I preached are not to produce anxiety but it's trying to bring you to a freedom uh you don't worry about uh uh uh Missing the [Music] Rapture if you believe that you are the [Music] rapt you believe that you're the true true seed of God you hold to that see your journey is not your destiny your journey is just part of it in in the journey you go through Mountain Mountain across Mountain through valleys you have rivers to cross but that's not your stopping point your your your journey does not um uh Define your destiny y understand what I'm trying to say look what Jesus had to suffer that was the journey he had to go through but his Destiny you find in the Book of Revelation when the lamb was able open the book and loose the seals y'all hear what I'm saying because you suffer because you go through trials your life it does not mean that you're lost and it doesn't mean that and preachers are here to try to finetune you sh the light in your life to see where Satan is hiding but you're not to allow you should not allow uh your trials to make you full of anxiety anxiety is of the devil and the Bible said be anxious for nothing the Bible says also they that wait upon the [Music] Lord their strength and they shall Mount up with wings of eagles they shall run and not [Music] we they shall walk and not faint so don't let Satan put that on you whenever you feel that get somewhere and pray until that Spirit leaves okay amen I believe that's where the problems lie is that we're not praying where enough anxiety is a horrible spirit I don't know whether uh you know that that that that's not good I've experienced it before and I want to say that anxiety is a branch of fear something Fe and you don't have to fear anything God came to give you peace people not anxiety and I'm not can you but I'm just saying that's where the enemy is your fear and fear brings anxiety Hallelujah and and and somewhere like I said there's unbelief somewhere you can't have faith at the same time so I pray that God would increase your faith in him and remove all of the doubt and fear hallelujah amen you love the Lord [Music] amen [Music] Mama Angel you may be seated margar thank [Music] you you may come forward for those who have got anniversaries going to pray for [Music] you father God we come before you right now we pray for our precious sister Lord I pray
