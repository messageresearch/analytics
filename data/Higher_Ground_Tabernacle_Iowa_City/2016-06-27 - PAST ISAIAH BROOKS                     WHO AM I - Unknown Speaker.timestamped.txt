[21:49] throne with this book in his right
[21:53] hand in his right
[21:55] hand think of it now
[21:58] and then in the book was a title deed to
[22:03] Redemption and it was sealed with Seven
[22:08] Seals and then the angel came
[22:13] forth a strong
[22:15] angel proclaiming with a loud
[22:19] voice who was worthy to open the
[22:23] book to take the book who was able to
[22:27] open the seat

[23:43] book who is worthy to do
[23:47] it
[23:48] Hallelujah well you and I really know
[23:51] what's going on by the grace of
[23:55] God this message did not
[23:59] come just to educate
[24:01] us or to make us uh have a greater
[24:08] knowledge but the message came to
[24:11] transform
[24:13] us is that okay it came to uh uh clear
[24:21] our
[24:23] minds of all the worldly
[24:26] things is that okay it came to bring
[24:31] us into into the very image and likeness
[24:35] of
[24:37] God first of all it came to identify
[24:43] us hallelujah amen I I thought and I
[24:48] chose Exodus the 11th
[24:51] chapter to begin the message
[24:56] with to begin my message
[24:59] [Music]
[25:00] with so that you would
[25:04] understand in order to know who you
[25:08] are you must do as Moses
[25:12] did you must confront God
[25:17] himself and when God begin to tell
[25:21] Moses about all the things that he
[25:23] wanted him to
[25:26] do no doubt it was no
[25:29] different from what his mother had told
[25:35] him is that okay but for some
[25:40] reason Moses had to
[25:44] question his
[25:46] [Music]
[25:48] idty because he had tried so many
[25:52] [Music]
[25:53] times to do things
[25:56] right this one time he really
[26:00] tried to make Israel
[26:03] know who he was he killed an
[26:08] Egyptian and he still was
[26:12] rejected Hallelujah but then God drove
[26:17] him to the back side of the
[26:21] desert Hallelujah where he had
[26:25] dwelt for 40 years
[26:29] but one day Moses saw a burning
[26:38] bush and he turned to see why the bush
[26:43] burned
[26:45] Hallelujah and as he
[26:48] approached as he approached the the
[26:52] bush God spoke out of the
[26:56] bush
[26:58] I am the
[27:00] father of
[27:02] Abraham Isaac and Jacob Hallelujah in
[27:07] other words I am the god of the
[27:10] living Hallelujah I am the god of the
[27:14] presence
[27:16] Hallelujah I'm not a yesterday God I
[27:20] am Hallelujah and we find out when God
[27:25] began to address Moses
[27:29] like he is you
[27:31] today Moses asked the
[27:34] question who am
[27:37] I Hallelujah see when you ask
[27:41] God who you are it is being God's
[27:47] responsibility to tell you who you
[27:50] are oh come on somebody because you and
[27:54] I have been called to a mighty work
[27:58] yall hear what I'm say You must
[28:02] understand and the work you must
[28:06] do it's greater than the work of
[28:09] Ephesus it's greater than the work of
[28:11] Smur it's great than the work of
[28:15] pramas Hallelujah they did great
[28:19] works
[28:21] Hallelujah they canot be complete
[28:24] without
[28:26] us you and I must
[28:29] understand you and I must
[28:32] understand we have a
[28:36] responsibility and our
[28:38] responsibility is greater than
[28:42] any huah because if we don't do what we
[28:47] are determined to
[28:51] do there will not be a
[28:56] resurrection
[28:59] amen see that's
[29:01] why we can't be lazy about this thing we
[29:05] must be Z toward God to see what God
[29:10] would have for us to
[29:12] do anybody hear me this
[29:14] morning you and I have a great
[29:20] responsibility that responsibility resp
[29:23] is to come into
[29:26] perfection
[29:28] y hear what I'm saying it's not enough
[29:31] to have it in your
[29:33] mind but it must be something in
[29:39] your who am
[29:43] I and that is that ought to be something
[29:47] that you would ask
[29:49] God we might see who someone else
[29:54] is or who they may are not afraid of

[30:45] die
[30:46] Hallelujah is that right it is a known
[30:50] fact according to brother
[30:53] Bram that
[30:55] Christians live
[30:58] longer long if they have a terminal
[31:01] [Music]
[31:04] disease if they have a disease that will
[31:08] that will

[31:38] mountain he th remove that that mountain
[31:42] must obey
[31:45] you
[31:46] Hallelujah I'm crazy enough to believe
[31:49] it that the
[31:56] word
[31:58] hallu let me read Ephesians here just a
[32:02] moment coming from the first
[32:06] chapter getting at the 17th verse is
[32:09] this
[32:13] okay that the god of our Lord Jesus
[32:17] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[32:21] you the spirit of
[32:26] wisdom
[32:32] and Revelation in the knowledge of
[32:36] him that your eyes of
[32:42] understanding being
[32:44] enlightened that ye may know what is the
[32:47] hope of his
[32:50] calling and what the
[32:53] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[32:56] in the saint
[33:01] and that's what this message came to
[33:05] do it came to Enlighten
[33:08] us it came to give us
[33:13] understanding it came to wash away all
[33:16] of the
[33:20] Amnesia
[33:21] Hallelujah and this is what I want the
[33:24] message to
[33:25] do it to bring me into a
[33:29] place that I and my father are
[33:37] one is that is that okay Jesus in the
[33:41] 17th chapter of
[33:45] John prayed he said father I
[33:50] would they be
[33:52] one even as We Are
[33:55] One
[33:58] hallelujah amen do you think Christ
[34:02] prayer could ever
[34:06] [Music]
[34:08] F the word of God is gone
[34:11] out and it can't come back
[34:15] for and now that we are living in that
[34:19] age of Oneness is that
[34:25] right that age of
[34:29] Oneness therefore it doesn't matter
[34:32] where you were
[34:34] born who your natural
[34:38] parents if you are elected of
[34:42] God chosen by God to be the one who is
[34:47] supposed to be
[34:49] one With
[34:51] God all hell cannot
[34:55] prevail
[35:00] because it's not
[35:03] us he that the good work in

[35:57] what is the exceeding greatness of his
[36:00] power to
[36:05] us

[36:59] his I must say it
[37:01] again I'm not working with your mind if
[37:04] I can get it into your
[37:08] heart we are part of
[37:15] his brother talks about
[37:20] Evolution and God evoluted
[37:24] everything EV not like
[37:27] science like we came from some
[37:40] tle but God evoluted
[37:45] us he spoke the
[37:48] word and the serpent was
[37:51] created Hallelujah and the highest
[37:54] things from the man
[37:57] from the serpent excuse me from the
[38:00] serpent came the
[38:02] man Hallelujah he spoke the
[38:06] man and the man was in the very image
[38:09] and Light Of
[38:11] God he was Spirit man
[38:15] Hallelujah brother R said it like this
[38:19] he said while Adam was a spirit
[38:23] man he led the animals
[38:28] he was the inspiration to those animals
[38:33] hallelu then God formed him out of the
[38:37] Dust of the
[38:38] [Music]
[38:40] earth Hallelujah so he can feel his
[38:44] creation so he can touch his
[38:48] creation so he with his
[38:54] creation you and I must understand
[38:57] that God did not roll
[39:02] dice he did not
[39:06] gamble to choose
[39:07] [Music]
[39:10] us like this he had no other
[39:16] choice
[39:19] Hallelujah have a choice with his
[39:24] child God has no choice
[39:31] hall because
[39:39] [Music]
[39:41] we the Bible
[39:44] says as the Earthly brought forth the
[39:50] Earthly so will the spirit bring forth
[39:53] the
[39:55] spirit
[39:58] is that okay you had no
[40:01] choice on your
[40:05] appearance on what you look
[40:09] like whether you like it or
[40:12] not you had no
[40:15] choice that's right it was pre-planned
[40:18] by
[40:21] God is that all right and everything God
[40:26] all about
[40:29] you was good amen
[40:33] hallelujah it was really when God
[40:36] created

[40:41] good you were above
[40:47] good he said when it came to he said
[40:51] very
[40:54] good he said very good
[40:58] now God is doing a greater
[41:02] thing this what God is bringing us
[41:06] into is
[41:08] higher is a higher
[41:11] [Music]
[41:21] order
[41:23] was
[41:25] second quicking
[41:28] Spirit
[41:34] he this thing is
[41:37] greater you and I can
[41:42] imagine say like this that little
[41:55] cillar
[41:57] in
[41:59] him is to become a
[42:03] butterfly look at the difference in the
[42:10] appearance when that little caterpillar
[42:12] is crawling
[42:15] around on the
[42:18] ground all he

[42:29] eat to
[42:46] eat all of a sudden he is
[42:50] inspired Amen to go and attach himself
