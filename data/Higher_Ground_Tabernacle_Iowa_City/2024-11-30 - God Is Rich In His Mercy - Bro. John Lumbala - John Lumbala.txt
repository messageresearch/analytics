want to come to church [Music] or they should said that they will be called and we not going to come [Music] maybe we we should stop our meeting and wait until summer the Lord bless you you are the heroes cuz the heroes never never abandon we said it last Sunday or last Friday God doesn't owe anybody everything that you do for God there's always a reward for it another day they've asked God a question I think it was Peter who asked Jesus a question where for second everything just to follow you you as well well we can ask him the same question we have uh confronted the C follow we brought our children through the C just to follow you so what are we going to get just listen to the to the answer you're going to receive 100 times of what you for but God going to reward you at 100% and above that he will give you eternal life so you're not losing by following Jesus you don't lose may God bless you so let us stand up our feet and read something [Music] we're going to read in the book of Psalm 107 where we read last time Psalm 107 EP from Psalm that will be just the first verse because we still going to talk about the same subject God who rich and mercy but we're going to add up another thing because the the word of God doesn't finish it's it's always there we going to read in the name of the Lord so uh oh give thanks to the Lord for he is good for his Mercy endures forever amen amen Ephesians chapter 2 chapter 2 from 1 to 6 Ephesians chapter 2 verse verse 6 to 7 and raised and raised us up together and made us SE together in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the age in the ages to come he might show the EXC the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us in Jesus Christ Christ amen amen may God add blessings upon his word we greeting you papa I didn't know that you would come glory to God for your presence we're going to talk about God who's rich in Mercy the me of God is the most important things for us because we came in this world being Sinners and we living with Sinners we also influenced and we came to the perverted ways in this but the only thing that give us courage to walk is when we can believe that our God is God of Mercy amen amen it's now advantage to believe in the mercy of God if we don't believe in the mercy of God then we be living in our condemnation why while the Bible says there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus so when the Devil Comes he's coming to discourage us with the condemnation do you remember what you've done that day you want to pray the devil is reminding you of of the things that you've already uh conf the devil is able to go even through the blood of Jesus to find your sin and present it to you while it's impossible for him to find that sin once you've already confessed your sin according to the ways of God that they've been given out by so your problem is already done before God who rich in Mercy it's like you never sin before God is has already forgiven for everything that you've done one day they brought up a woman who was sinning so they got that that woman sinning and they brought her before Jesus and they asked a question to Jesus as to to to tempt him and they say we found this woman we got her sinning but Moses told us to Stone her but God who rich in Mercy instead of condemning the woman he said unto the woman go and sin no more amen amen the only bad thing we can do is to arrange sin I can take an example just a little example a brother has got some weaknesses maybe he's drinking you found that brother saying uh you know uh beers is not a problem taking beers is not a problem if you're drinking beer is not a problem even you read in the Bible when if you can read in the Bible Jesus has Chang aend water into wine it's not a problem doinking a beer is not a problem so that kind of a brother is the is the dangerous one but if you find someone who's drinking brother I know I'm weak myself I know to leave this beer it's a problem for me so that one God can uh can do him can forgive him so there's a difference between those two people another one is just covering up his sin is trying to cover his sin meanwhile the person who's covering up his transgression or his sin will never inherit the kingdom of God but the one that is seeking for mercy of God is going to found it because the mercy of God is our right as the children of house we've got our right all of us as children of God one father and is a children right that we know we got to feed our children as a father as a parent we got to uh clothe our children we got to protect them as parents we got to uh rebuke them oh we got to find a shelter for them that's the children right as a parent I have to watch upon that so if I've got I am a bed father I a bed father I'm thinking in the right way to do that to my children so how much more our heavenly father as a child of a most high we got our right as well the things that belongs to us like the mercy of God belongs to us God has to forgive me because he's the one who said that he's going to forgive us in the Garden of Eden God wasn't surprised when God was creating Adam he knew that Adam was going to fall before even Adam fall that's why he provided a way for Adam the way that he provided for Adam was a mercy Mery way so when Adam came he have done whatever he has done but the quality of God of Mercy should be manifested that's what happened if God wasn't Merc uh full in Mercy he was going to kill Adam he was going to create another species of people but just because he's a full of Mercy rich and mercy he preserved our race and he accepted not death to touch his child amen amen so if God have done it yesterday he can still do it today if God have done it for Adam he forgave Adam Adam was under the blood which wasn't compatible to his BL but Adam found Mercy to God even when Adam sinned God came to speak to Adam being a sinner he was discussing with God being a sinner so God can do the same thing for you God can still talk to you but when he's talking to you is not to cover your sin but it's trying to pull you back to get you back to him so our God is really reach in Mercy it's in our advantage to believe that [Music] when I was meditating about this then I started reading the definition the meaning of mercy and I found so many meanings of definitions of mercy so one definition attract my intention he's saying that the mercy that's what God is is the virtue that God is using to bring back a sinner then I say How great is the mercy of God so the mercy is greater than God's judgment Mercy is greater than the wrath of God Mercy is greater than the just justice of God so it's so important to believe into a mercy because whoever doesn't believe in Mercy then he believes in condemnation so listen to what the prophet is saying in the preaching God whose Mercy who who's rich in Mercy paragraph 38 listen to what it's saying you were one time dead you were dead even tonight at a certain point you can look back and see that you were dead so how come that you not dat tonight as you were in that time so is in that state as that you you meditating to be because you were a sinner but God who's rich in Mercy that's the point God who was rich everything that we we used to but see precisely what operated the change is God who rich in Mercy paragraph 39 the prophet is saying this I'm so happy with that that God is rich in Mercy if he was just rich in money if he was just rich in material things yes is is but regardless of everything what is So Glorious is that God is rich in Mercy what a noticeable word of God that were one time dead and the prophet is showing us the greatness of the mercy of God is telling us that God is rich in Gold that's good he's also good in money that's good is rich in material things it's still good but the most important is that God is rich in Mercy if God is not rich in Mercy how are you going to enjoy everything that is going to do to you uh one day I was uh a cemetery uh my friends my friend's daughter pass away we were together in South Africa she passed away so we went to bury that daughter in in Chicago while was walking around the [Music] graveyard then I start looking to the uh dead of birth upon the tombs of people then I've noticed that even little children as I was walking around the tombs and I saw another one was almost my age and I said oh God you are rich in Mercy then I start looking back in my life how many times I I got into accident how many times I survived accident then I say oh God even white people even white are dead which means I'm more important than all of those people then I say to myself God is rich in Mercy beloved listen to one thing there's so many words not only this world in which we are our Prophet calls them Dimensions am amen we living only in in the light in the in in time and [Music] M we can get into a fourth dimension the scientific word through the internet and all of those things so we just limit ourself in those four dimensions so other dimensions are just spiritual Dimensions I'm just assuring you Brothers there's so many things happening in the spiritual world right now as we're standing here there are meetings in spiritual words right now in other dimensions because in those word the prophet says it's the real Dimensions he visited them why do we love our Prophet because he doesn't tell us things that he didn't he didn't leave when the prophet talks about heaven he gives us the details of the heaven when he talks about hell he gives us the report of what he have seen in her it's not like other people are just imagining about hell but he have seen hell he have seen heaven when he gives a testimony is a true testimony from a true uh uh witness amen [Music] amen we got job case the Book of Job chapter 2 we're going to listen to something Job chapter 2 verse2 Job chapter 2 verse two and the Lord said to Satan from where do you come so Satan answered answered answered the Lord and said from going from going to and from and from the earth and from walking back and forth on it then the Lord said to Satan have you considered my servant job that there is none like him on on the earth and a blameless and right man one who fears God and shs Evil and still he holds fast to his Integrity although he insist uh he insisted insist insisted me against him destroy him without cause so Satan answered the Lord and said skin for skin yes all CH man all that man has he will give for his life but stretch out your hands now we can just stop there so something is taking place right here there was a meeting the meeting that was taking place they're talking about [Music] job by the time they were talking about job job didn't know anything he was just busy with his days while he was doing his own business there was a meeting somewhere and they are conspiring about him and job is innosent if it wasn't for grace of God in that day it was going to be the end of job cuz God God said unto Satan you can do whatever on him but never touch his life amen amen it's the same thing about you is the same thing about me while we seated right here there's meeting taking place somewh it can be somewhere else the Bible says those bad Spirit are in in in the hair there might be a witchcraft but they are comporting against us so what is protecting us is the mercy of God Amen we got to believe in that mercy of God amen amen there was another thing that was about Mike or we can just talk and and move forward it was about Mike there was a war it was uh first king uh 19 okay oh the King was about to uh to start a war while the King was getting ready to start the war they called Mike all the prophet have already say that M you can go forward and study War but in that time Mike inspired by God he said I've seen a meeting taking place in heaven so you are seated right there on the earth but there's a meeting taking place in heaven in that meeting they were citing your name they were doing conspiracy about your name because the Lord is the Lord of army all Spirits are at the service of God the the spirit of lie said I want to go I want to enter in the mouth of those I'm going to give a false prophecies then they will believe into a li they will go and they'll be killed amen amen another example it's about Peter we can read it we can read about Peter Luke 22 Luke chapter 22 verse 24 and truly the son of man goes as it has been DET uh deter determined but who to that man by whom he is betrayed oh Luke 22 yeah oh sorry I was reading 24 now there was also a dispute among them as to which of them should be considered the greatest and he said to them the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and those who exercise Authority are over them authority over them are called Bene uh uh benefactors but not so among you on the contrary who he who is greatest among among you let him be as the younger the younger Luke 22:24 yeah 24 now there was a dispute among them as to which of them should be considered the [Music] greatest so it's Luke 22:31 and the Lord said said Simon Simon indeed Satan has asked for you that he may he may shift you as weak but I have prayed for you amen that your faith should not faade amen and when you have returned to me strengthen your your Breen amen may God bless the reading of his word so Peter was seated with his brothers he was ignorant that while he was sitting in that that time the devil was asking for him and it's only Jesus who knew about it so the devil was asking for Peter to kill him but Peter was busy doing other things he didn't know what was going on it's like us as we seated here he can if you can just look back in your life see you've been born until today if you couldn't see the mercy of God so there's there's no one who can who can be more blind than you if you can't see the mercy of God in your life there's no one Blinder than you so if God accepted to open our spiritual eyes so that we can see what is happening in another dimension the fight that God is busy fighting for us the victory that God is having for us the failures that he gave to the Witchcraft people the victory that God is given to us when they wanted to kill us God can just open our eyes and see that that we can see what could happen we were going to sing the mercy of God because he said unto Peter he said unto Peter this that the devil is claiming you he want to kill you but I prayed for you that's the mercy of God it said in the Bible it's in the book of Romans chapter 8 26 that the Holy Ghost is interceding for us with unable that's the work of Mercy that's the work of Mercy that we have always that we should have in our mind that we should have in our in our in our heart to believe that God Of Heaven is died for us everything that we could ask him tonight he's going to give it to us believing that the almighty God is able to forgive of all sin that we have Sinn he able to give us everything that we need there's nothing that we can ask from God and other thing that we couldn't because God is able to give us everything that we need he's also able to forgive us of all our sins is also a high priest who touched by the feelings of our infirmity he only ask us to go back ways to always asking for forgiveness and is able to perfect us is able to perfect our M condition because our well-being that's is he cares for us the high priest he's not dead he's still alive we going to read what the prophet says about the high priest before we pray amen amen [Music] in the attitude and who's [Music] God paragraph 35 the prophet said this as the inspiration of God is here to inspire you just remember God going to bring your body to obey to your confession amen amen that's why it's more important for us to always pronounce good weight for ourselves when you talk about God God will come when you talk about Jesus he will come when it talk about Mery the Mery of God will come what you said is what you believe you talk about mercy of God and the mercy will will shown up will be shown in your life when you talk about condemnation then you live under the condemnation why there's no more condemnation for those who are in Jesus Christ listen to this you said that you are a drun if you say that you are a drunker that you want to drink beer never mind you will be one of the drunk because that's what you're confessing if you say that you are a sinner that you want to commit sin you will find yourself committing sin without any any fault but if you say that you a [Music] Christian and you believe it you believe that every time listen to this God will bring your testimony your testimony going to bring you straight away to what you confessed if you believe into the healing and you believe that God has healed you just confess it then God will bring your your body to believe to your confession because he's a high priest of our confession amen amen is now seated at the right hand of God with his own blood to intercede for every confession that you've made that's why he died he died to take away sins and the sickness that's the consequences of sin he was wounded for our sins by his tribe that we've been healed just remember that just have faith never doubt about it am amen we're going to read one more scripture then we're going to [Music] close the resurrection of Jus uh uh daughter paragraph eight no matter how weak you are the greatness of of sickness the deepest of sin the state of your situation are we together is there to intercede according to what we confessing amen so you see how much important is our confession [Music] I know one brother going to come back to the reading I met him the last time when I was in kinasa I was so shocked a brother a preacher when you talk to him you know I'm po I'm a poor man I got nothing I'm going to die just as I am everything that I've done in my life I fade so you are a preacher how can you Cur yourself in that way that's I'm just saying the truth no that's the insult to God said I'm your young brother I can never say that to you it should be an enemy who saying that to you and if I'm there I'm going to rebuke him but look yourself you a bad testimony against yourself you say that you came in this way just to accompan other people and you said that you're poor you said that you fail no I'm not happy about that he said that I'm poor God is a witness now that I'm here they call me is no more at home they Tred to find him they didn't never find him they they checking his document he found they found that he have made a will already probably he committed suicide he just wrote there don't look try to find me uh everything that I have just give it to my people then he disappear and his wife doesn't know where she where he is so what happened to that person his confession had found him amen amen he confessed that he had got nothing where could he go he confessed that he had nothing no one else he said that he fail in his life he said he came to accompan other people effectively he came to accompan other people he said that he is poor he's really poor when I read a will that he has made I want to see what he share with people then understood that he was really a poor man then the PO the poverty has followed him so let us pay attention to what we say the the the high priest of our confession is praying on our favor he's praying in our favor and also is bringing to into existence what we confessing that's why I I'm a Son of God yes I'm a Son of God you like it or not I am a Son of God Amen I believe that that's how everyone should give his testimony to other people especially as the privileged people the sons of Malachi FK the the bless the race of God people have received the prophet people who have believed in impossible things that are not in unexplained what we believe living they the difficult difficult things and it's not given to anybody to believe what we believing that's why it's so hard to bring to bring somebody to the message because the message is a university it's not a elementary school it's not the crush I I gave a testimony last time they were preaching the message to us and we were three by that time one brother was preaching to us while he was preaching to us the same word he was using I was so happy about those words I was saying Amen to that but my other two friends they were saying that those things are for white people philosophy so you want to give glory to a man I said he just used the same word but the same word to me is the honey in my ears but to my friends it's bitter they even start insulting I just heard the person was preaching said you as well you want to glorify a man I said unto them this is so beauti so nice then I say mercy of God Mercy God for those people God is so rich in Mercy and we love his Mercy when we leave our home to come here there's many many plan that the devil is planned for us the thing is we don't see those devil plans that war is happening in the earth we don't see it but our our our chance the chance we got a high priest who's praying in our favor the high priest is not dead He's Alive that's why when we're going to leave this place we will pray and the high priest will take care of all the evil spirit while we be sleeping the high priest will be taking Tak care of all the evil spirit because there's nobody who can be more glorious than God we continue the reading is there to intercede on the basis of what we confess that have done for us and everything that is in the atonement he was wounded for our sin he was broken for our iniquity the H that bring us peace has fallen on him and is true his tribe that we've been healed everything all the attribute of death that we're receiving in our heart we believe to be truth that we believe that he have done it for us before we even feel them listen to this testimony it's saying this even if we are sick before even we see our healing we will start confessing because he is the one who's going to take care of that he is the one who's going to bring Force our body to believe to our confession but if you were saying by example no I'm sick I know I'm going to die yes you're going to die of course because you confess death and the death going to come it's like you inviting death you see on the on the uh Damascus Road there were there were brothers were coming since they were walking they were talking about Jesus you know when Jesus came we thought he was going to help but why did he die we we just regret his death he was so great that man we didn't think that they could we saw him resurrecting we saw him resurrecting Lazarus but somebody who resurrecting dead people someone who's forgiving how how could they stop you how could they arrest him while they were talking about Jesus as they talk so much about Jesus Jesus came down and walk with them because they given a testimony about Jesus they repeated the name of Jesus several times until Jesus himself materialized himself it's the same thing because Jesus is the high priest he takes care of our confession what are we talking what are we saying all along the day what are we talking all day long in our prayers what are we doing what are we saying so what are we asking in our prayers what are we confessing upon our children what are we confessing upon our families what are we confessing upon our wives what are we saying about our husbands so let us finish the reading so that we may pray all those things all those attribute of his death that we're receiving in our heart that we believe to be truth that we confessing that he has done it that we confessing before even we feel them he is standing before God so that he can fix it he's standing in intercession for us and the prophet is giving an example if I was paralyzed that I believe in my heart that he has healed me I'll confess that I'm Healed even if I couldn't move one muscles of my heart I will believe it I will believe it and then if I'm sincere in my heart not just Disturbed but in my spirit if I'm sincere in my heart is interceding before God on the basis of My Confession that's true and he's going to fulfill it can you think about it amen amen let us stand and we will pray we saying thank you Lord for his Mercy for each one of us because it's his Mercy that brought us in this place it's his Mercy that give us chance to speak to him because many of us never get this chance to present themselves before a great God like our God r as speci [Laughter] very s oh my [Laughter] [Music] the fa to say K Pro me [Laughter] no oh oh sh [Applause] [Applause] oh to say all sh [Laughter] J on oh oh oh s oh oh [Music] we going to pray for the [Music] church because Among Us there's no stranger there's no visitor we just want to see this church moving forward the way things are right now is not good correct it's not good what can fix it is only the prayer as the prophet said if we can ask anything to God he's going to give it to us let us pray for the church praying for the church is praying for brothers because the church is not just the building but the the church is the members of the [Music] church so if uh God Place BR in your heart that you see like is negligent just ask the mercy of God about him because it's only the M of God that can give us Victory eternal life doesn't depend for the one who run but it depends from God who gives mer as we heard it last Sunday but God want us to be in Fellowship he knows what we need but he want to hear that from our mouth that we can tell him what are and when it's perfect he's going to tell us that that's perfect like Adam was giving was naming animals and trees and everything because God was so happy because in unity with and he knows everything that we need let us pray let us pray for brothers for sisters you you may be standing or let us call upon the Mery of God about them may God bless our church amen amen [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music]
