[1:04:00] you Lord
[1:04:02] as humbly as we know how and we thank
[1:04:06] you for your grace and your mercy
[1:04:09] who am I Lord
[1:04:11] that you would call us
[1:04:14] to be your servant
[1:04:16] I pray Lord God did you give me Grace to
[1:04:21] move completely out of your way
[1:04:23] speak to the hearts of your people
[1:04:26] speak in the life that's within them
[1:04:28] Lord
[1:04:31] that we all may see
[1:04:34] the great calling in which you have
[1:04:36] called us to La pal lot we humble
[1:04:40] ourselves before you
[1:04:42] we're nothing within ourselves
[1:04:45] but Lord Jesus You're Everything
[1:04:49] bless your service we pray in Jesus
[1:04:53] Christ's name
[1:04:54] amen amen you may be seated
[1:04:58] or
[1:05:00] my subject this morning
[1:05:03] is called to a higher calling
[1:05:11] many of us
[1:05:13] perhaps are and have been like me
[1:05:21] when I first got saved
[1:05:25] I thought that the product was finished
[1:05:31] when I got filled or when God filled me
[1:05:33] with the Holy Ghost yeah
[1:05:36] I thought that I had reached that
[1:05:39] ultimate goal
[1:05:42] and then the message came to me
[1:05:46] and then the message came to me
[1:05:50] I didn't find it
[1:05:53] but it found me
[1:05:57] and in my studying the word of God
[1:06:01] I came to realize
[1:06:04] as the prophet of God said
[1:06:07] when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:06:10] you only just begun who come and says
[1:06:13] but you see there weren't anybody
[1:06:16] telling me these things
[1:06:18] there wasn't anybody you know really
[1:06:21] emphasizing
[1:06:23] what I should be doing and she's this
[1:06:26] your second chance I came to this
[1:06:28] message
[1:06:30] after many people yeah come to the
[1:06:34] message
[1:06:35] and when they come to the message they
[1:06:39] really believe that they have arrived
[1:06:41] but the message is isn't the message
[1:06:45] itself is instructions
[1:06:51] the message itself will take you on a
[1:06:54] journey
[1:06:56] the message itself
[1:07:03] but if we don't see what it really is
[1:07:08] more than quoting a prophet remember
[1:07:12] it's more than quoting the scriptures
[1:07:16] because there are many people
[1:07:18] theologians
[1:07:20] who can out quote all of us
[1:07:23] but we realize by the grace of God
[1:07:28] each and every one of us must truly be
[1:07:31] born again
[1:07:34] that is just the beginning
[1:07:37] of your journey
[1:08:14] [Music]
[1:08:19] [Applause]
[1:08:37] is that right amen so did Jesus Christ
[1:08:43] Jesus Christ had to find his
[1:08:46] identification in the word
[1:08:50] and even as Jesus Christ
[1:08:53] even as Jesus Christ
[1:08:57] each step it up the prophet made forward
[1:09:01] okay
[1:09:03] meet more death
[1:09:06] to self
[1:09:08] more deaths
[1:09:11] and more consecrations
[1:09:25] hallelujah amen it wasn't just oh I'm
[1:09:29] Malachi Falls
[1:09:32] but he had to pursue
[1:09:46] Hallelujah drive him forward
[1:09:51] Hallelujah I'm feeling pretty good this
[1:09:53] morning
[1:09:56] but
[1:09:57] in this message
[1:09:58] we have forgotten who we are
[1:10:03] we call our
[1:10:07] Hallelujah but you're not in this Jesus
[1:10:10] Christ until you become like he is
[1:10:18] the Bible never say it like this media
[1:10:21] called
[1:10:22] but you are chosen
[1:10:25] hallelujah amen you you got
[1:10:28] you got what I'm saying the reason I use
[1:10:31] because
[1:10:32] many were called by Moses
[1:10:36] were called by Moses
[1:10:42] Hallelujah
[1:11:04] I must know
[1:11:08] hallelujah amen and you've got to come
[1:11:11] to know
[1:11:14] this is the identification
[1:11:17] identification God gave to us
[1:11:21] this is the identification
[1:11:23] God gave to us okay do you have anywhere
[1:11:26] by way of Malachi
[1:11:29] hallelujah amen because media people
[1:11:32] basketball I've heard this message
[1:11:35] hallelujah amen
[1:11:36] [Music]
[1:11:38] have gotten rich off this message
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:44] I became popular of this message
[1:11:49] did not come to make you rich message
[1:11:56] came to make you
[1:11:58] Jesus Christ
[1:12:01] [Music]
[1:12:17] that means you've got to die
[1:12:22] you get to God
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:31] amen
[1:12:33] I'm gonna read a quote
[1:12:35] coming from once more info in foreign
[1:13:11] death
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:20] hell and the grave
[1:13:23] the Bible said he had a new name
[1:13:28] and when Jacob overcomes see
[1:13:31] what he said
[1:13:33] if the church
[1:13:35] can overcome
[1:13:38] she will stop saying
[1:13:40] I'm Methodist
[1:13:44] Presbyterian
[1:13:47] message now I threw that one in
[1:13:51] when she can overcome her Creeds
[1:13:54] and the world that draws her in there
[1:13:59] she'll come back to the Bride of Jesus

[1:17:33] it's his calling
[1:17:35] not your calling
[1:17:38] the preacher though he didn't bring you
[1:17:40] here
[1:17:44] but one thing God is calling foreign
[1:18:09] my sister
