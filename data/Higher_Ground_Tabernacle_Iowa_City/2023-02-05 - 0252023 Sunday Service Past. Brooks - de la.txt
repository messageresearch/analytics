to Matthew the fifth chapter six to the eighth verse versus and then we'll ask you to turn with us to Saint John 4 23-24. it happens [Music] may not say Matthew sank and that's the only other than what you're saying Matthew 35 6-8 blessed are they everything is blessed are the merciful but they shall obtain Mercy records blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God one more scripture [Music] foreign [Music] foreign but the hour coming and now he is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is the spirit and they that worship him in spirit and in truth it is let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord yes we thank you for this wonderful morning you've given to us supporting of God that you would break and Destroy every yoke of the enemy could you please from ourselves in the name of Jesus amen amen this money is not going to work I can always use the elements yes [Music] we try to uh and get everybody to see who they are and where they are so [Music] when we think about what God has done in these last days we must understand that the word of God itself is creating a bride and Craig for the the translation translation brother banham taught us how he was building a house there are times when you have to turn a corner yeah and I believe the message that God brought at the opening of the word came to came to make us turn a corner I find out that in the way I preach some people don't like it and then there are those who do yeah so you can better understand me I only come to preach to the bride and I know that the word of God that God has given me is I'm going to say a few things and I want you to fully understand what I'm saying because oftentimes some think when I speak I'm preaching against brother Branham cause your pressure God forbid God forbid well you see the devil is fighting this message but that's okay I'm gonna preach it anyway just lick my voice but I'm going to preach with what I have because I want you to understand I want you to see something when brother Branham walked the Earth that generation has something that we did didn't have questions they had brother Branham they had a man feel they could touch they could go to uh fishing with long time they would have a wonderful time with the prophet of God but when brother Branham left we don't have brother branna please foreign y'all hear what I'm saying God didn't leave us empty-handed he gave us the creator of the prophets hallelujah amen so we are in a time that we must listen to the message there is no such thing I'm in the message and I don't listen to those thought that voice on the tapes oh I don't read the books oh I don't read my Bible Hallelujah It Is by this voice Jesus Christ is creating his bride yes Hallelujah the message when it came it opened the book Hallelujah and when the book was open we got the fullness of God we got the Alpha and the Omega the Old Testament the New Testament and the message that that caps off the old and the News Hallelujah in other words the New Testament it's the revelation of the Old Testament and the open book or the revelation of this message hallelujah it's the revelation of the New Testament Hallelujah three right it all works in three Hallelujah you can't just work with the old you know [Applause] we have come to a place in this age [Applause] Hallelujah but it's also the age of God's bitter judgment Hallelujah if we cannot see that the world is under judgment is you're missing the whole point Hallelujah [Music] and the only people said this word will not judge but those who are under the blood says hallelujah I didn't say those who think they are under the blood I said those who are under the blood Hallelujah because what people need to see is that The Mercy Seat changes positions the mercy sheep changes its position uh right behind the veil but the mercy she moved Hallelujah from the the the the representation to the genuine Mercy Seat just go oh and Jesus Christ when he rose again he took the blood and he put it on The Mercy Seat in heaven y'all hear what I'm saying so the mercies of God was throughout all the churches but something happened at the opening of the word the mercy Street moves Hallelujah we need to understand Hallelujah as a prophet of God let the Bride of Jesus Christ is the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit Hallelujah Church with this on a Sunday bride of Jesus Christ no holy day Hallelujah because we realize the Sabbath is not the Saturday and brother Brandon said the Sabbath is not the Sunday everybody amen come unto me come unto me oh ye the lady I will give you rest I will give you rest for your soul amen even though the word of God said I Fearless some of you will not enter into the rest oh you get the Holy Ghost but you've got a labor to get in there you got to press to get in there is that right the Bible is at the kingdom of God silence suffereth violence but the violence take it my subject this morning is follow those bloody Footprints who are who I believe who are the Believers he saw the question we say we are the Believers those of us who are eating the Flesh and drinking the blood take your mind of the son of man Hallelujah am I eating the Flesh and drinking the blood of the son of man literally places us back into Eden Hallelujah so I want you to understand the only thing Adam and Eve had I ever been for for guidance for instructions was the voice of God what did you they didn't have no books they didn't have no tapes Hallelujah [Applause] he's the sons of God hallelujah amen we're free from all Creeds free from all prison systems I said from all prison systems your church can be a prison system the prison is you heard what I said I said your church can be a prison system so the person system it can shackle but like this is the prison You Can Be Your Own Prison Awards see because when the spirit of God tells you to move God says hallelujah everybody no one else is moving because no one else is saying hallelujah hallelujah your communion with God is fake Jesus I'm coming I'm coming by the grace of God hallelujah amen the prophet God says in communion yes in 1962 he says God ever sends his power to the church of the church if God shouldn't ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace It Won't Be The Obedience of the people hallelujah all right you know all y'all should have said Hallelujah because none of us continually measure up the paper say misery it takes the Great [Music] [Applause] the grace of God that's the only way you will make it it'll still be amazing grace the blood of Jesus Christ no matter how deep the word was and is John said I heard a lion but when I looked around I saw a bloody land Jersey Hallelujah why it started with a bloody lamb and it is [Music] we haven't come this way before there is no Elder there is no preacher there's no Bishop there is no poop there is no church Hallelujah because we are being laid a great Shepherd Of God who is the Holy Ghost yeah God one of these old days brother Brandon said we'll understand what Revelation really meant to us it's not just the reading of the books it's not reading your Bible the revelations Hallelujah this is not a church situation the individual situation Hallelujah and you've got to know Jesus for yourself hallelujah amen is that the truth I forgot who brother Brandon was talking to but he was saying that easy to those who was following him uh secular he says see those bloody Footprints it was false I can take you when God Moses could only take them as far as that he could he performed Hallelujah and you had to Father John pass away now Mana so you understand what I'm saying God told Joshua do you have it yes don't you forget everything Moses said you can't go this way if you understand what Moses says hallelujah but you have a revelation somebody help me here Amen Let me put it in our turn unless you understand what brother Brandon says this is our day Hallelujah and God is trying to get us to see he has called us to merge as the prize of Jesus Christ The Pride is not standing still marching to the word hallelujah [Music] she was walking to the tune of the words [Music] got to see some growth in you know Christians five years ago one year ago Hallelujah somebody help me here this word comes to create foreign foreign [Music] that communion he said communion it's a Catholic word Catholic we use that word communion our service is really a memorial service Memorial hallelujah amen but he said to talk to when it comes to communion is a definition to talk to commune with something that you can speak to us and it'll speak back to you hmm he said a wafer a cookie um so really the real communion is the holy spirit speaking back when you ask him then he speaks back that is correct communion hallelujah amen he said this is a memorial to take of his crucifixion and his resurrection resurrection and not a communion in order talking about is all the paganism a paganism version Christianity oftentimes when people don't come to the Natural Memorial Day it shows in the spirit they're not communing with God oh help me is that right yes brother Brandon said a real believer that's really spiritually built up here Constitution he reads his Bible every day and talks to the Lord hallelujah amen every day I've got some friends who forget to eat sometimes [Music] I've never been that way I always remember to eat hallelujah amen but some Christians they can't forget to eat spiritual Foods you forget and then when the devil attacks you oh God what did I do wrong hallelujah amen you broke your communion Hallelujah the Bible said acknowledge the Lord in all your ways Jesus Christ is the only God talks back to you Jesus Christ is the only God that talks back if you try to talk to any other Saints of spiritualism hallelujah amen you know I've been guilty in the past When Trials and test the test s he said a brother he could do nothing for you unless I told him to um the god of the prophets [Music] yeah almost if Rebecca and Isaac was having fellowship and when Rebecca would say to Isaac was [Music] huh come on Brothers y'all know what I'm talking about the Bible said the name of the Lord is jealous the name of the Lord is according to the word it'll never be according to the word but Christ is the Holy Ghost the anointing that's upon the church yesterday that is the meat and drink y'all hear me the Holy Ghost you just sent this me is your so-called communion it is the meat and the drink Hallelujah if you eat my flesh and drink my blood this is why the devil is trying to keep you yeah that's not the Holy Ghost Hallelujah but you must understand we are here to entertain the holy ghosts we are here to entertain and you can't entertain the Holy Ghost by sitting still you can't entertain no the holy ghosts [Applause] by not giving him true communion Hallelujah follow those bloody Footprints reverse his songs the Lord showed me that the one that was in front of the Bride who was in front of the Bride who was in front of the Bride he didn't see him he was invisible but they sang a song Christian Soldier marching asked to walk again he was the one he is the one that's leading us [Music] I know Matthew 4 24 4. the word of God says my two four we read that as a text I'm going to be too much longer but I'm trying to get us to see something Brandon's quotes I listen to the tapes my God he's not my savior hallelujah amen Jesus Christ and him alone I cannot worship I cannot worship any other God hallelujah and I cannot put brother Brandon's name above Jesus Christ given among men where we must be saved and the Bible says hallelujah his name is above all names at the name of Jesus Christ every tongue shall confess to the glory of God hallelujah amen Yeah man so I get in trouble with people because they don't understand where I'm coming amen hallelujah amen remember I was told I was told I was told that this brother said that he loved brother Branham more than we love Jesus Christ you see it's Jesus Christ you said what are you saying Paul said I no longer live for Education people it's not hard that lives but it's Christ Jesus that lives but we have a voice and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was gone Hallelujah God is a spirit and things that worship him let's worship Him and Spirits you can go to the Pentecostal church you can go to the apostolic church and then I have more anointing in you but the Bible says they do worship me in vain hallelujah amen they don't even know that he's no longer there Marshall amen amen and the only way in this day is accepted by God is to worship Him in spirit says Colossians 3 Colossians 17 you don't have to turn if you don't like if you don't and whatsoever you do hey two seconds and word or deed Do It All In The Name Of The Lord amen giving thanks to who God I couldn't understand for so many years God in Christ and the prophet God says listen Jesus was not God hallelujah amen because Jesus was created he was the body of God I said do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to who do not remember hallelujah amen because remember now he was God he was Elohim and when he was Elohim he was not yet God in order to be God he had to create something hallelujah amen and in order to be father understand somebody help me here so God is my father Hallelujah God is my God and God the Lord Jesus Christ of all things hey man hallelujah amen Saint John 14. he said yet a little while and the world won't see it no more that's the church but ye shall see me because I live that and the Bible says when the Lord is in his temples keep silence Hallelujah he's not sharing his throne you're out of the way he's the only one on the throne Hallelujah you've got the dying right God is completely in full control of you water control we're on a journey for some reason don't be like the spies you got Giants in your life and you say we can't do it no I can't do it but he can as long as I followed Josh away as you know this I follow Jesus Giant Slayer we become Mountain movers Hallelujah Bridge or a river we can't cross [Music] we'll make our way we cannot be defeated we are in Invincible Summit you know man we cannot be defeated Victory is in Jesus amen hallelujah amen he that have my Commandments he is that love with me and he that loveth me he said look at ma'am shall be loved of my father and I will love him and we'll manifest myself to him coming from the ever present Waters from The Rock yeah paragraph 71. paragraph seven uh now in the modern days it would be oh every Wednesday night real meeting foreign but how long will we continue to vindicate brother Branham as a prophet um when the Vindication has already been settled what I'm trying to say preachers are always telling us what brother Brandon was taken foreign Empire hallelujah amen if God didn't want us to go further yeah I've been born when he was alive Hallelujah but God took him away so that we can become perfect the old church ages ability amen y'all hear what I'm saying if you don't see you Jesus Christ his identification who he was Hallelujah little by little little by little he had the first pool Hallelujah and when God was getting ready to bring the third pool on a hunting trip Hallelujah he didn't have no game he never played again and God says listen you out here to hunt you don't have no games would you like some Square squirrels a prophet could be nothing without the voice nothing Japanese you Hallelujah go go get some squirrels today God told him what to say hey [Music] we all said well brother Brandon stop the storm yes God told him to the store you can't lead the Lord Jesus out of this day Hallelujah if you're gonna preach the prophet you got to preach Jesus Christ too since you cannot leave him out because he is the finisher hallelujah amen we can't deny what Paul is done with John dude now when William Branham [Applause] how he did it let me move on continue he said what are you here worship a worshiper goes there to worship His God foreign associated amen Hallelujah yeah man oh let me tell you Miriam then we were under the Holy Spirit when she began to dance those old women got out there got out there dancing hey the sisters got out there dancing let's say I married all of them all of them he got out there and they began Hallelujah oh my God they were so inspired the Holy Ghost fell on Moses if Moses began to sing a new song Hallelujah did you know when the seals were open the Bible said they sung a new song shot set alarm y'all know it's true and don't tell me people in the message don't do what I'm saying yeah when people think they're praying to God and won't obey the word it can you know it's a false communion you just lying to yourself he said if you abide in me and my word about it then ask what you will Allah and it'd be done no it's just can't go on one time means to stay there my words abide in you just stay there stay right there diseases hallelujah amen you love the Lord second Corinthians four uh give me a few more minutes but if our gospel be hid it is here to them that are lost in whom the god of the this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not a seriously who is the image of God should shine unto them pay attention to this lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ is the image of God who is the image of God did you shine unto them yes when he's preaching keep pressure while he's preaching he's supposed to give you the image of Christ for we preach not ourselves that's what Paul said but Christ Jesus the Lord ourselves for your Servants of Jesus Christ I'm gonna say this you should put skin and then then I'm gonna go ahead and close because of the time let me read the scripture first and then I explained Corinthians 11th chapter uh two through four decorations for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have exposed you to one husband that I might may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear blessed by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his substitute so your mind should be corrupted thank you foreign whom we have not preached Paul didn't preach himself he preached Jesus Jesus which you have not received but you have not accepted he might well bear with him you know the Corinthians took advantage of the people you know they there were times the Corinthians with different ones would have such Authority they could slap a person again they were Christians like the prophet God said but the anointing Has Lifted from us but we're Christians and he said the only way you're gonna get a Revival go wake Jesus it ain't good it's not he said they talked about the Revival with Jesus and then when he did come on this one time yeah they were not even able to identify the Holy Spirit but let me say this statement [Music] and that thing carried on even to John the Baptist and Jesus Jesus came to John the Baptist John the Baptist says when John Batista pointed to Jesus disciples take away the sins of the world Amen the Bible says only disciples y'all hear what I'm saying so is the message only two yeah since the seals were open Jesus everybody stayed with John hey and I'm gonna come back again the only way John lived by the name of Jesus because when John was in let's get going down Elizabeth Hallelujah it took the name of Jesus disciples in closing put them in I see you getting a little tired it's okay when the bride has been committed to the Grooms y'all know the wedding ceremony he he has this Veil over his she has a veil over her head and then she lays that Veil upon his shoulder yeah not only is she under his Dominion but also that he Bears the responsibility AOC reported responsibility and the care and that he and
