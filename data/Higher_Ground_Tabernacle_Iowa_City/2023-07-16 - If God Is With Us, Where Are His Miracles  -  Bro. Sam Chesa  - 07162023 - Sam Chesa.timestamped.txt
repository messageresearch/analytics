[36:26] Hallelujah
[36:28] how many are grateful to be in the house
[36:39] amen
[36:46] open up Bible
[36:53] of judges
[36:56] [Music]
[37:05] Judges chapter 6 and verse 1.
[37:13] when you get there Say Amen
[37:17] the Book of Judges is in the new
[37:18] testament old testament
[37:23] you cannot find it in the New Testament
[37:28] amen verse 1 says
[37:32] and the children of Israel did evil in
[37:35] the sight of the Lord and the Lord
[37:36] delivered them into the hand of the
[37:38] median seven years
[37:48] and the Hand of million prevailed
[37:50] against Israel and because of the
[37:53] medianized the children of Israel made
[37:55] them dance which are in the mountains
[37:58] and caves and strongholds please
[38:15] and verse 13. it was and Gideon said
[38:19] unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with
[38:23] us why then is all this befall in us and
[38:27] where be all his miracles
[38:33] [Music]
[38:47] amen you may take your seats
[38:51] amen for a short time this morning I
[38:53] want to speak on if God is with us then
[38:56] where are his miracles
[39:03] [Music]
[39:04] and for a subtitle I want to speak on
[39:07] not this time
[39:13] can someone help me and say not this
[39:16] time
[39:18] I didn't hear you loud enough somebody
[39:20] says
[39:23] amen
[39:26] in the Book of Judges where we read
[39:28] already
[39:30] the Bible tells us that the children of
[39:32] Israel had been put in the hands of
[39:35] medianism
[39:37] [Music]
[39:40] and God allowed the medianized to come
[39:44] and attack and take um advantage of the
[39:47] children of Israel
[39:51] Israel
[39:54] this is because the children of Israel
[39:56] had done evil in the sight of the Lord
[40:03] so we find that ourselves in our lives
[40:09] many times when we start doing evil
[40:15] God allows us Satan to come and attack
[40:19] us
[40:22] he allows trials to come your way
[40:27] so you can remember that there is a God
[40:32] exists that there is a God who can
[40:34] deliver me
[40:36] and when you are in trouble you run to
[40:39] him
[40:42] and every time you run to him he always
[40:44] delivers
[40:48] he always hears your prayers
[40:51] let us read verse three
[40:54] he says and so it was when Israel had
[40:57] sown that the midianites came up and
[40:59] their amalekites and the children of the
[41:01] East even they came up against them
[41:11] and they encamped against them and
[41:14] destroyed the increase of the earth till
[41:16] Thou come unto Gaza and left no
[41:19] sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor
[41:21] Ox nor ass
[41:24] [Music]
[41:36] [Music]
[41:38] and Israel was get greatly impoverished
[41:41] because of the midianites and the
[41:43] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[41:50] Israel
[41:53] amen so we read God delivered the
[41:56] children of Israel into the hands of the
[41:58] media not for seven years
[42:05] this was because this is because they
[42:08] were doing evil
[42:11] and the prophet of God tells us that
[42:14] Satan cannot touch you
[42:19] unless you step out of the boundaries of
[42:22] the word and you go out to him
[42:32] here in my first quote
[42:40] the devil can't set a foot on you the
[42:43] prophet is
[42:50] until first you get away from God
[42:53] um
[42:54] you must first remember that
[42:58] check when anything happens see if you
[43:01] are in the faith or not
[43:06] see that if you're right up to the place
[43:08] with God then remember the devil can do
[43:11] you no harm you are in Christ
[43:18] when you are in God Satan cannot do
[43:21] anything to him
[43:24] the blood of Christ surrounds you
[43:28] there's a scripture that says the angel
[43:31] of the Lord encampered around those that
[43:33] fear Him yeah
[43:46] Satan went to uh to God
[43:50] and said you know I cannot do anything
[43:52] to to job
[43:56] because you have a fence around him
[44:01] it's not God who said that
[44:04] is Satan who said I cannot touch him
[44:07] because you have a fence around him
[44:13] how did Satan know that there was a
[44:15] fence around him
[44:20] because he had tried to go without God's
[44:23] permission
[44:25] and he could not charge her because of
[44:28] that fence they were surrounding him
[44:33] so I'm here to tell you if you are a son
[44:35] or a daughter of God
[44:39] you have a fence that's around you
[44:44] the blood of Christ surrounds you the
[44:47] Sunday is the Vancouver and no demon can
[44:50] break that barrier to come for you okay
[44:52] okay
[44:54] the sickness can break that barrier to
[44:56] come for you
[44:59] because you are protected by the blood
[45:01] of Jesus
[45:03] amen amen it's just like the City of
[45:06] Refuge I say come in
[45:08] the children of Israel when you run into
[45:11] the city of refugees
[45:15] the walls of the City of Refuge protects
[45:18] you element
[45:21] but as soon as you live out
[45:25] your adversaries can come and attack you
[45:28] both at their self and you cannot blame
[45:31] anyone because
[45:33] that's on you you were not supposed to
[45:35] leave the city
[45:38] so brother sister don't leave the word
[45:40] Allah
[45:42] when you leave the walls the protection
[45:45] of the word
[45:47] protection you're putting yourself in
[45:50] the hands of saying
[45:55] so the children of Israel where we read
[45:58] earlier
[46:00] we read all in the Book of Judges
[46:04] every time they did wrong
[46:09] God delivered them in the hands of their
[46:11] enemy
[46:14] immediately for them to get back on
[46:17] their knees
[46:19] for them to pray back to God and
[46:21] remember that we have a God yeah
[46:24] who can save us who can deliver us
[46:29] and we Are Spiritual Israel
[46:32] Israel scripture and God does the same
[46:35] thing for you and me
[46:38] sometimes when we do wrong
[46:40] that allows something to touch you
[46:43] shows
[46:46] but you gotta remember no matter what
[46:49] you have done
[46:51] cry to God
[46:54] he will hear your prayer
[46:57] because there's a promise that says if
[46:59] my people who are called by my name
[47:04] if they humble themselves and pray he
[47:07] said I will hear from heaven
[47:11] we don't serve a deaf God
[47:16] he will hear and he will answer your
[47:18] prayers
[47:21] amen many times we do that
[47:24] you're going to say Lord please don't
[47:27] say yeah please deliver me out of this
[47:29] problem
[47:30] if you deliver me out of this problem
[47:34] never ever do it again
[47:37] but as soon as he delivers
[47:40] really after a little while Mr Predator
[47:43] you find yourself in that exact same
[47:45] problem don't you have that delivery
[47:48] then you go back to God in prayer
[47:51] and say Lord the thing that I did then
[47:53] yeah
[47:54] that I said I wouldn't do it again
[47:57] and you delivered me out of it
[48:01] I have done it again
[48:03] and I'm asking you to deliver me out of
[48:06] it again
[48:08] I've been there how many have been there
[48:13] but God is faithful
[48:16] he is not a man a Pioneer if you were to
[48:19] do that to your brother
[48:21] they'll tell you not this time
[48:24] you were supposed to learn your lessons
[48:28] but when you go to God
[48:30] it doesn't matter how many times you do
[48:32] wrong
[48:34] he will deliver you with his mighty
[48:37] hands
[48:38] every time foreign
[48:42] [Music]
[49:14] and the prophet of God saying the next
[49:15] quote
[49:18] if that isn't the picture of the church
[49:20] today
[49:23] just as soon as it gets out of one twist
[49:25] shows
[49:29] right into another one it goes
[49:35] but time had come for action
[49:39] time had come for action
[49:42] and he's talking about the children of
[49:44] Israel when they were captive by the
[49:46] midianites
[49:49] you see time had come for action
[49:53] and that's the same right now
[49:57] the time has come for Action
[49:59] [Music]
[50:01] the time had come when playing church
[50:03] had to come to a halt with God
[50:08] there is no more playing church
[50:11] we must get down to business
[50:16] and I trust that the same God who plays
[50:18] this upon the heart of people yeah
[50:22] tonight that is time for a hold of plain
[50:25] Church
[50:28] playing religions
[50:30] playing righteous
[50:35] and now it's time for Action
[50:37] what's the action foreign
[52:06] [Music]
[52:37] the children of Israel when they were
[52:40] marching around Jericho that's how far
[52:42] is
[52:43] Jericho they were taking action of what
[52:45] God had told them to do sure the second
[52:49] so when you do what God tells you to do
[52:52] Allah
[52:53] he's always gonna show up on the scene
[52:56] for a miracle
[52:58] God told him to March around Jericho
[53:00] seven times
[53:03] and because they took action and they
[53:05] took God at his word and pasties have a
[53:07] face attack shows God had to come down
[53:11] they started shouting before their walls
[53:14] had fallen down
[53:16] because they knew if God says
[53:20] it's a done deal
[53:22] if God says it
[53:24] is
[53:36] if he can do that for the children of
[53:39] Israel
[53:54] you can start praising him and shouting
[53:56] for Joy when you are in that sickness
[54:02] why because you know God always keeps
[54:05] his words
[54:07] hey man he said but my stripes you were
[54:10] healed
[54:13] not that you are going to be healed
[54:16] but you are already healed
[54:19] all you gotta do is take action on that
[54:22] word
[54:24] and he says it is finished
[54:27] he was not specifically
[54:30] whatever you you are dealing with or
[54:34] battling with Allah
[54:38] take action
[55:34] so it doesn't matter how much the enemy
[55:36] is Ravishing you
[55:48] and the next verse which is on the slide
[55:52] verse 76 and it came to pass when the
[55:55] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[55:57] because of the medianites
[56:02] that the Lord sent a prophet unto the
[56:05] children of Israel
[56:09] which said unto them
[56:11] thus says the Lord God of Israel
[56:16] I brought you up from Egypt
[56:20] brought you forth out of the house of
[56:22] bondage
[56:25] did you see what happened here
[56:28] the children of Israel have been in
[56:30] bondage for seven years
[56:33] and they Cried unto the Lord because
[56:36] they were under oppression
[57:08] and the prophet said unto him that says
[57:11] the Lord God of Israel
[57:14] you are from Egypt
[57:17] and brought you forth out of the house
[57:20] of bondage
[57:23] what was God doing
[57:25] he was preparing them for deliverance
[57:29] he was telling them if I did it before
[57:33] I can do it again
[57:36] if I destroyed your enemies the
[57:38] Egyptians uh
[58:18] [Music]
[58:37] he was he was giving them his resume
[58:42] he's saying what you've seen what I've
[58:45] done before
[58:48] this problem that you have the problem
[58:50] this is the media Knights the media need
[58:53] they are nothing in the in the song in
[58:56] the song yeah if you go to the next
[58:57] slide usually uh the prophet God says
[59:00] before God sends Deliverance to his
[59:02] people
[59:05] he always sends a prophet to notify them
[59:12] he always sends his prophets
[59:16] so when you see a prophet coming on the
[59:19] scene
[59:21] no Deliverance is on his way
[59:24] because before God can send the
[59:27] Deliverance
[59:29] he's got to send a prophet
[59:32] and we thank God for deliverance in this
[59:35] last day
[59:37] because God sent us a prophet
[59:40] and we know that the prophet coming on
[59:43] the scene
[59:44] it means you and Miss Deliverance
[1:00:45] Lord I am a Seed of Abraham anyways
[1:02:14] and he killed all of the
[1:03:11] and then when you see that things are
[1:03:14] not okay
[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:03:50] so why do you think you are so special
[1:03:52] that he's gonna start failing on you
[1:03:54] hello
[1:03:57] that ain't gonna happen is he if he has
[1:04:02] never failed before
[1:04:03] he's not gonna fail on you
[1:04:06] if he has never failed or light in his
[1:04:10] word see
[1:04:12] why is it going to start lying on his
[1:04:14] words
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:05:14] an exam example is so that when you are
[1:05:17] working with a situation an example
[1:05:19] [Music]
[1:05:23] and you don't know how to handle it
[1:05:27] you go back to the example
[1:05:30] how do they do this here
[1:05:33] like oh that's what they did something
[1:05:39] so the scriptures in the Old Testament
[1:05:41] they're there for you and me for an
[1:05:42] example
[1:05:45] that if God gave a solution before he
[1:05:48] can see
[1:05:50] he can give you a solution
[1:05:53] the scripture says there is no
[1:05:56] temptation that's uncommon to men
[1:06:03] whatever you are looking for the answer
[1:06:07] is right in the Bible
[1:06:10] so go back to the Bible
[1:06:12] go back to the word
[1:06:50] next slide
[1:06:52] the prophet of God says oh we are living
[1:06:54] in a grand time
[1:06:57] immediately when the prophet went off
[1:06:59] the scene
[1:07:03] what happened the Lord came on the scene
[1:07:05] yes
[1:07:08] as soon as John went off the scene
[1:07:13] the Lord came on the scene they said
[1:07:16] very strange how God works
[1:07:20] but he does it works in a mysterious
[1:07:23] ways
[1:07:25] so when God took the prophet of the
[1:07:28] scene
[1:07:30] he didn't leave us alone
[1:07:32] hey man he came down himself he'll the
[1:07:35] son remember because that's what the
[1:07:37] word of God tells us
[1:07:38] as soon as the prophet leaves the scene
[1:07:42] God comes down do you remember this song
[1:07:45] Amen so you can say and say Lord what
[1:07:47] you did for William Branham
[1:07:50] I know you can do it for
[1:08:48] and the doctors he went to the doctors
[1:08:51] and they made diagnosis and they said
[1:08:53] you have cancer he is
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:58] he went back home and he prayed
[1:09:01] again
[1:09:03] Hallelujah
[1:09:18] if God be for us
[1:09:20] where are his miracles
[1:09:23] when you take him at his words
[1:09:26] you know he's coming down
[1:09:30] he is coming to deliver you
[1:09:32] he is coming to help you today
[1:09:35] hallelujah amen so all those cancers
[1:09:38] tumors baroness
[1:09:43] they cannot stand before you and then
[1:09:47] your trials cannot stand before
[1:09:51] you can run and go fight your battle
[1:09:55] because you know it's already won
[1:09:59] because it's God
[1:10:02] so whenever you're in trouble
[1:10:05] even if it's a self-inflicted trouble
[1:10:09] run to God anyways run to God anyways
[1:10:15] he has been proven to come time after
[1:10:19] time to come and redeem to come and
[1:10:21] deliver you
[1:10:23] please
[1:10:27] in the next slide
[1:10:30] so so God spoke to his Prophet Allah
[1:10:34] and they the midianites had taken all
[1:10:37] they had hey
[1:10:40] and they were starving to death
[1:10:43] tell my friends come on and he said
[1:10:46] don't you remember that I'm the god that
[1:10:48] brought you out of Egypt
[1:10:52] don't you know that I performed all my
[1:10:55] Miracles down in Egypt
[1:10:58] if you can put the next slide
[1:11:02] don't you know I opened the Red Sea this
[1:11:04] is
[1:11:06] I fed your fathers for 40 years in the
[1:11:09] wilderness
[1:11:10] [Music]
[1:11:12] I broke off the enemies around them
[1:11:17] amen amen did not I take out the
[1:11:20] amalikas and everything else from before
[1:11:22] here
[1:11:29] this was God speaking back to the
[1:11:32] children of Israel after they went back
[1:11:34] to cry to God forever
[1:11:39] he's telling them have you seen what
[1:11:41] I've done before in the past
[1:11:44] and I like this part it says I am the
[1:11:48] god
[1:11:50] just turn back to me
[1:11:53] and this says these two words watch me
[1:11:57] you are not doing the fighting yeah
[1:12:00] just turn around
[1:12:03] turn back to God
[1:12:05] then just watch him
[1:12:08] it says and remember always immediately
[1:12:11] after that prophet's message
[1:12:15] God goes to work
[1:12:18] so what's your duty all you have to do
[1:12:22] is watch him
[1:12:24] because he's doing the fighting for you
[1:12:27] foreign
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:13:27] your relationship can be an idea
[1:13:29] but you put God First
[1:13:33] Take God at his word
[1:13:36] take action on the word
[1:13:39] turn back to him and he says watch me
[1:13:43] because after the word Goes Forth
[1:13:47] that's when God starts to work
[1:13:50] amen amen we have had the message of
[1:13:53] deliverance
[1:13:55] we have received the Seven Seals
[1:13:58] we have received the message of Grace
[1:14:02] and after that message has gone foreign
[1:14:39] the Bible says the children of Israel
[1:14:42] were in bondage of the media nights for
[1:14:44] seven years
[1:14:48] and the Bible is not specific for
[1:14:51] nothing
[1:14:54] and we know seven represents completion
[1:14:59] to represent the children of Israel had
[1:15:02] had seven years of defeat listen for
[1:15:05] this
[1:15:07] but because it was the seventh yeah
[1:15:11] God says your defeat is complete
[1:15:16] your defeat has ended
[1:15:21] and they were walking into their eighth
[1:15:23] year
[1:15:25] with your money and in their eighth year
[1:15:28] that's when God came to speak to them
[1:15:33] to bring Deliverance to them
[1:15:36] so they had seven years of a cycle of
[1:15:39] defeat Allah as long as you Satan
[1:15:42] and sick let the defeat but in the
[1:15:44] eighth year eight or eight represent a
[1:15:47] new day
[1:15:51] to represents New Beginnings
[1:15:55] hallelujah amen although they had
[1:15:58] suffered for seven years
[1:16:01] it was time for the eighth
[1:16:04] doesn't matter how many cycles of defeat
[1:16:07] you have been they are the proper the
[1:16:09] number of the tank is fair you try to
[1:16:11] get back up Satan takes you down
[1:16:15] you try this you try that but it ain't
[1:16:18] working
[1:16:20] I'm here to tell you we're at the end of
[1:16:23] the seven churches
[1:16:26] amen
[1:17:17] [Music]
[1:17:26] and we go to uh verse 11 that's the next
[1:17:29] slide
[1:17:31] it says and there came an April of the
[1:17:33] Lord and said Anna in Oak which is an
[1:17:34] offerer that pertained to Josh the bus
[1:17:37] ride and his son Gideon threshed Wheat
[1:17:39] by the wine press to hide it from the
[1:17:41] media Knights
[1:17:44] verse 11.
[1:17:47] and there came an angel of the Lord
[1:17:51] we even launched the tunnel
[1:17:53] is a
[1:17:55] [Music]
[1:17:56] um
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:16] and the angel of the Lord appeared to
[1:18:18] him and said unto him the Lord is with
[1:18:20] thee thou Mighty Man of Valor large
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:33] he was hiding
[1:18:36] there was nothing Courageous about what
[1:18:39] he was doing
[1:18:42] he was busy hiding from his enemies
[1:18:45] but whilst hiding from his enemies
[1:18:49] God came to him
[1:18:52] thou Mighty Man of Valor
[1:18:56] so we are seeing two things here
[1:18:59] Gideon is being a coward
[1:19:02] and God is saying you are a mighty man
[1:19:05] of Valor man
[1:19:08] and these two cannot be correct at the
[1:19:11] same time
[1:19:13] either Gideon is lying
[1:19:16] God is lying
[1:19:18] because they both cannot be correct at
[1:19:21] the same time
[1:19:23] he's being a coward
[1:19:26] and God comes and tells him you are
[1:19:28] victorious
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:32] so either one of them is lying to learn
[1:19:36] more but the word of God tells that God
[1:19:39] never lies
[1:19:41] he is not a man that he should lie no a
[1:19:44] son of man that he should repentance
[1:19:48] so whatever Gideon thought of himself
[1:19:51] hello
[1:19:54] because that was a line vanity
[1:19:58] take what God was saying about him
[1:20:02] it does not matter what you think about
[1:20:04] yourself
[1:20:07] what matters is what does God think
[1:20:09] about you
[1:20:11] and you know what God thinks about you
[1:20:14] by looking in the word
[1:20:17] the word is a mirror it tells you
[1:20:21] that you are a mighty man of Valor
[1:20:25] Mighty woman
[1:20:44] so it doesn't matter even if you are
[1:20:47] hiding
[1:21:46] and as soon as the prophet leaves the
[1:21:48] same foreign
[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:45] you will see his miracles when you take
[1:22:49] what he says about you
[1:22:53] amen amen so Gideon trash that whole
[1:22:57] idea about being a cowboy
[1:23:00] and he stood up chest
[1:23:06] um and when he went he came to the Telly
[1:23:10] God gave him Victory
[1:23:12] Hallelujah it was not about him
[1:23:16] he just stood up but he said and you
[1:23:19] watched God do everything
[1:23:21] the soldiers only had to wait
[1:23:25] as the angel of God moved in the camp of
[1:23:27] the enemy
[1:23:31] so brother sister what you think about
[1:23:33] yourself
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:37] or what other people think about you
[1:23:42] does not matter at all
[1:23:45] what matters is what does God say about
[1:24:47] foreign for you to Prosperity he doesn't
[1:24:52] have thoughts for you to to be overcome
[1:24:56] thought of you to be defeated
[1:24:59] amen he has thought of you to get out of
[1:25:02] that bondage
[1:25:08] and that will only happen if you take
[1:25:10] God at his word
[1:25:12] what does God say about me
[1:25:17] what does God say in his words
[1:25:27] but the Bible tells us God never lies
[1:25:31] so I would rather take God any day
[1:25:35] than what any other man or myself can
[1:25:38] even say yes
[1:25:41] because his word has been proven to
[1:25:45] never failure
[1:25:48] the same voice that says let there be
[1:25:51] light
[1:25:53] it created all the heavens and the Earth
[1:26:01] is the same voice of God we have in this
[1:26:03] area
[1:26:05] the Bible tells us that his word when it
[1:26:08] goes out
[1:26:10] it doesn't go back to him
[1:26:14] but it goes back to him after it is
[1:26:17] accomplished that which has sent it out
[1:26:22] any promises of God about you
[1:26:27] if they have not happened yet
[1:26:30] you gotta walk out and know that they're
[1:26:33] coming anyway
[1:26:38] it has to happen
[1:26:40] he has never failed
[1:26:43] hey man amen born Spirit-filled men in
[1:26:46] faith
[1:26:50] takes the word into his heart
[1:26:55] the next one please
[1:26:56] okay
[1:27:00] and places it on his lips a place
[1:27:04] why that is the same as deity speaking
[1:27:09] Every Mountain has to go Chuck Montana
[1:27:12] Satan cannot stand before that man
[1:27:17] hallelujah amen when you are
[1:27:19] Spirit-filled
[1:27:21] when you are born of the spirit
[1:27:25] you when you take the word of God
[1:27:28] what it says about you
[1:27:31] and you put it in your heart
[1:27:34] remember as a man think it is
[1:27:44] put it on your lips
[1:27:49] it is the same as deity speakers
[1:27:54] it is the same as God speaking
[1:27:58] Every Mountain has to go shark month
[1:28:01] Satan cannot stand before that
[1:28:04] because remember what was in God he
[1:28:07] poured into Christ
[1:28:10] what was in Christ he poured into the
[1:28:13] church
[1:28:15] so the same Authority that God
[1:28:18] he placed it in you and me
[1:28:22] with that Authority in heaven he kicked
[1:28:24] out Lucifer I've accepted
[1:28:27] and that same Authority poured into
[1:28:30] Christ
[1:28:31] kicked Satan in hell yeah
[1:28:38] so if he poured that same Authority in
[1:28:41] you and me today
[1:28:44] we can also kick Satan on this Earth
[1:28:48] because that's the that power has the
[1:28:50] same effect
[1:28:53] amen amen God never fails
[1:28:57] take action take God at his words
[1:29:00] take that word into your heart
[1:29:03] if you speak it out
[1:29:06] God will give you delivery
[1:29:08] amen amen if God be for us
[1:29:13] then where are his miracles
[1:29:16] we go to uh verse 14.
[1:29:20] just keep a lot of slides and go to the
[1:29:22] one that is verse 14.
[1:29:24] and the Lord looked upon him
[1:29:27] and said go in this thy might and thou
[1:29:30] shalt save Israel from the hand of the
[1:29:32] midianites have I not sent thee
[1:29:35] uh
[1:30:00] the
[1:31:00] so your value depends on Whose hands you
[1:31:03] are in Allah
[1:31:07] when Gideon was in the hands of of the
[1:31:10] media and I think the hand of his
[1:31:11] enemies he was a coward hello
[1:31:16] but as soon as he got out and stabbed
[1:31:18] into the hands of God
[1:31:22] he became a Mighty Man Of Violence
[1:31:27] so whose hands are you in hello
[1:31:30] are you with the hands of God or in the
[1:31:32] hands of your enemies
[1:31:34] if you are in the hands of your enemy
[1:31:37] I'm telling you run away right now
[1:31:41] run into the hands of God
[1:31:45] because he will transform you basket
[1:31:52] from a liar to a Son of God
[1:31:56] from a prostitute to a daughter of God
[1:32:01] he will change you from good for nothing
[1:32:03] to good for the kingdom
[1:32:42] that same basketball is going to be
[1:32:45] worth thousands
[1:32:49] it's not about the basketball the
[1:32:51] program is
[1:32:53] about whose hands it is
[1:32:59] so whoever's hands you are in hello
[1:33:03] that determines your values
[1:33:06] so brother sister Hello friends to take
[1:33:10] that leap this morning if you've been in
[1:33:13] the hands of the enemy for so long
[1:33:17] seven years

[1:34:24] because you are in the hands of God
[1:34:28] amen amen as I'm coming to him and let's
[1:34:31] go to verse 15.
[1:34:34] and then he said unto him
[1:34:37] this was a Gideon telling God
[1:34:41] he says oh my Lord
[1:34:44] where shall I serve save Israel behold
[1:34:48] my family is poor in manassar and I am
[1:34:51] the least in my father's house
[1:35:05] after he had accepted that he was a man
[1:35:08] of
[1:35:09] accepted
[1:35:11] and after stepping into the hands of God
[1:35:16] she started looking back at his
[1:35:18] background
[1:35:20] he started looking at his ancestors
[1:35:23] history
[1:35:27] you have said all this about me
[1:35:31] but I just come from a poor background
[1:35:35] you know Manasseh was not given an
[1:35:37] important role
[1:35:40] but God predestinated him
[1:35:43] your past doesn't matter
[1:35:48] your past does not determine your future
[1:35:52] what determines your future is what God
[1:35:55] says
[1:35:58] even if you come from a poor background
[1:36:01] foreign
[1:36:10] can say you come from a from from from a
[1:36:13] lineage of drunkards
[1:36:17] people that are good for nothing
[1:36:22] none of your ancestors were known for
[1:36:24] anything that's good or can this is
[1:36:29] you gotta stand and say I'm in the hands
[1:36:32] of God
[1:36:38] it does not determine my future
[1:36:42] after God is done with me
[1:36:45] I'm gonna be a different case all
[1:36:47] together
[1:36:49] hallelujah amen so it doesn't matter
[1:36:52] what you have even done
[1:36:55] people can say you are a sinner
[1:36:58] you have seen so much but when you step
[1:37:02] into the hands of God
[1:37:05] he throws all your sins in the sea of
[1:37:07] forgetfulness
[1:37:50] you just tell them
[1:37:52] wait until God is done with me
[1:37:57] and the next slide in chapter eight
[1:38:01] the men of Israel said unto Gideon
[1:38:06] this was after Gideon brought the
[1:38:09] miracle into Israel
[1:38:14] and they overcame their enemies
[1:38:18] and they went to him now
[1:38:21] that good for nothing
[1:38:25] that man coming from a poor background
[1:38:27] said
[1:38:29] that man saying who am I
[1:38:32] what am I
[1:38:34] they went back to him they say you rule
[1:38:38] over us
[1:38:41] both you and your son and your son son
[1:38:44] also
[1:38:46] because you have delivered us from the
[1:38:49] hands of the media
[1:38:51] so you see what Gideon did wait a minute
[1:38:53] he stood there and he says all the evil
[1:38:57] that was rolling down from my ancestors
[1:39:15] generational curse of poor background
[1:39:19] he says it stops with me
[1:39:23] when God is done with me
[1:39:27] I'm more than a conqueror yes
[1:39:38] but now they wanted him to be his
[1:39:41] Legends
[1:39:44] not just him only person but him and his
[1:39:48] sons and Sons to come together
[1:39:53] so you might be in your chapter six
