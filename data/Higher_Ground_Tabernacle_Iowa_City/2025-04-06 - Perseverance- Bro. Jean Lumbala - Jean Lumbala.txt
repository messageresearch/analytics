TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I know that he has his own business but my mother's my problem is my salary. That's the reason why I can't I can't find I can find someone who steps on my feet and when that person steps on my feet I act like I don't even see him because after all he's not my problem. My problem is my salary. And it's the same when you come to worship. When you come to worship, you got to have in your mind your purpose. What did you come to do? Amen. Amen. God called me to be his servant. So you are also a servant of God. The servant of God is not just a preacher in the team of God that overcomes. Everybody is an actor. And there's no no someone who stands there and look at people. They just they just careless. They just careless. And some even acts like uh they live here and they go criticize, gossip about their church. I know in my church they don't sing. Well, so you leave your family. Let me give you my example. It can never happen to me. to tell somebody else that my mother is a witch. Even if she is a witch, even if I know that she's a witch, I cannot do it. Because I believe that my mother is me. The shame of my mother is my shame. So you have to believe the same. The victim of your church is your victory. And the shame of your church is your your shame. That's how you had to believe. You have done well. To to start a church in Iowa. May God bless you. You have done well. Amen. Amen. But when you start something, you got to end it. Finish it. If you don't finish it, you are a distractor. You and the one who distract you have the same salary. When you start something, you got you have to achieve it. No matter what, no matter what obstacles, no matter our difficulties, you should never leave your church. Amen. Amen. You should never forsake your church. You know, in order for God to bless us, you look at our endurance and how much we in our way to our way of deciding to worship him. Amen. Amen. And the devil in also in order for him to leave us he looked at us how much we can endure with our faith. You know [Music] Peter when the Peter s in the water he looked is it a dead man he says I'm not a ghost it's me and Peter say if you tell me uh um let me work with you in water and Peter walked with He started working working on water and he started working [Music] but he didn't endure with his faith and when his faith started going down and Peter lost his uh balance on the water and Peter wanted to drown if it was not the grace of God. And Peter Peter started well but he didn't he didn't keep his faith and you also has started well but you have to to God calls Moses he gives him a mission he gives him a mission says, "I heard the cries of my people Israel. Here's the time. I have to go free them. I have to go free them. But I'm sending you." Amen. Amen. And when Moses was working on the will of God and he was an obstacle come, what is it? Here these two prophets. They also do the same thing to do what? To bring Moses to doubt of the promise of God. But Moses stayed persistent. He didn't change his faith. He stood with the faith. He said, "The one who spoke to me was the Lord, the God of Israel. He's alive and he's able to do anything and freed us." But that those two prophets was there. They also did the same miracle as well just to bring Moses to doubt. But Moses didn't doubt. He believed and he witness testified but he stay with firm with what he believed. And that's what you also have to do. For each one of us this morning, you have done well to believe. You did well. You did well to testify. Stay faithful with what you're saying in your testimony. Don't you change your testimony. Don't just change your testimony. Keep testifying. If you testify today, you also testify tomorrow. If you testify tomorrow, keep testifying. Keep testifying. The God who sent you down here who brought you to start this church. He's not. He's alive. You cannot lose your faith. Don't you lose it. We just read that you have in order for you to get to get the promises of God. We have to endure it. We have to endure it. We cannot be believing today. For example, myself, I gave you my testimony that I'm waiting for my wife and my children's that's coming and if one day I go to to the media and I say that that Trump says people cannot no longer come to the United States and if I change my taste because of what Trump said. Then I lost my purpose. Amen. Amen. But if I'm I'm doing I have to keep repeating. I have to keep testifying. I I have to keep enduring. pray because we know it's through prayer that we get our victory. When we are sick, we pray. When we in good health, we still pray. At the time of peace, we pray at a time of war. We still pray. We pray at night. We pray during the day. We cannot pray enough. Today, if we believe that Moses is a servant of God, it's because he endures with what he believed. Was displeased with the teaching of his mother. His mother would tell him, "You're not an Egyptian. You're an Israelite. Look at this. One day we'll get out of this. But when Moses met with the teaching of Hel, he didn't stay the same Moses. He became Moses of faith. He became Moses of endurance. You become Moses who can be trust in the word regardless of the option. remembered cuz where I was going and we
