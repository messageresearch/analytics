[34:03] we thank the Lord this morning
[34:10] for the privilege that you give you just
[34:12] give us
[34:17] [Music]
[34:25] I remember being in 2014.
[34:30] or
[34:31] at least
[34:33] there was not yet this church
[34:35] the friend was done
[34:38] my friend the one brother John and
[34:42] brother Danny they were Fellowship in
[34:45] Des Moines
[34:49] we had a meeting we met somewhere I was
[34:53] like pastoral Eve song group with Pastor
[34:57] Eve and the other group
[35:03] that's where I did preach the first
[35:05] sermon
[35:09] and today when I come back I found
[35:12] there's already a church oh man amen
[35:16] it's a great privilege
[35:19] the pastor Isaiah I thank Pastor Isaiah
[35:23] Brooks
[35:24] who is your pastor here yeah
[35:30] who accepted me to preach even in his
[35:33] absence the thickest and the faster
[35:37] I know it's not something easy I never
[35:39] met him before
[35:44] just brothers he gave him a testimony
[35:47] about me and he accepted that to
[35:49] preachers
[35:52] so it's not something easy specialist
[35:55] nowadays but yeah put them
[35:59] because the small distress among seven
[36:03] of God
[36:06] especially if they don't know where
[36:08] you're coming from
[36:10] what you believe what you preaching
[36:14] so there's a lot of Doctrine around yeah
[36:18] we have some kind of distress among us
[36:24] but just because it trusts us
[36:29] we just surrender to God
[36:34] actually is God who knows your needs
[36:39] and it's only God who knows what to give
[36:42] you
[36:46] so God can do that through the mother is
[36:49] going to use amen amen
[36:52] [Music]
[36:55] you gotta do everything you can for the
[36:58] progress of this church
[37:01] because this is your church
[37:04] [Music]
[37:05] it's the church that you call your
[37:08] church home like this is
[37:11] [Music]
[37:13] the church is so it's a place where the
[37:15] Prophet says
[37:17] [Music]
[37:18] the mayor we're going to change to
[37:21] become a better people the mayor Fred
[37:23] the better better Brothers the mayor's
[37:26] better sisters the mayor of wazan and
[37:29] the better neighbors Army better friends
[37:34] so it's the church that makes us to
[37:36] become better better people
[37:39] so you gotta consider
[37:43] [Music]
[37:44] themes and you're gonna do more
[37:48] sacrifice for a church people
[37:55] okay
[37:58] like this
[38:00] that we're going to church is a
[38:03] condition in the message the church and
[38:06] its conditions
[38:08] I just want to found it through my phone
[38:14] from paragraph five and C is
[38:19] [Music]
[38:22] so I just came to have about two or
[38:26] three days of rest before I go
[38:33] foreign
[38:55] [Music]
[39:41] so I really deserve for you to pray for
[39:44] me my friends
[39:47] so that God may come Among Us
[39:52] and give us a great and wonderful
[39:55] meaning
[40:01] I'm going to Canada
[40:04] and I've got wonderful friends over
[40:06] there
[40:08] so brave people
[40:11] listen to paragraph six and
[40:16] they are so faithful to go to church
[40:22] those Indian people are so faithful to
[40:24] God's Church
[40:27] no matter how cold it is
[40:30] how cold it is
[40:33] they just cover up themselves
[40:44] see they go over 50 or months
[40:48] just to get to church he Traverse
[40:52] appeared
[40:53] they go by fee through the through the
[40:57] snow and to the rest and all of the rest
[41:03] and in Africa when they talk about the
[41:06] breaking out of the snow we don't
[41:07] understand that it's simple complaining
[41:09] but here you will understand when the
[41:11] snow is melting
[41:12] well there's a melting snow under alley
[41:16] on a level yourself
[41:28] regardless of those Indians they are
[41:31] eager to go to church
[41:53] it's true the sacrifice they do that's
[41:56] where they get a lot from the meeting
[41:58] counting apart the sacrifice when
[42:00] there's no sacrifice
[42:06] nothing from the meeting
[42:39] there's no blessing if there's no
[42:41] sacrifice
[42:44] foreign

[43:43] in order to go to church
[43:47] and to show together
[43:51] and when you do a such a
[43:54] circuits

[43:59] the meeting

[51:37] a prescription
[51:49] now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron
[51:52] saying this is the ordinance of the law
[51:55] which the Lord is commanded saying speak
[51:57] to the children of Israel that they

[53:25] them into the midst of the fire burning
[53:28] they have
[53:30] Not Alone
[53:36] the reading from home then let's go to
[53:39] New Testament
[53:41] efficient
[53:43] efficient
[53:45] chapter five
[53:50] apartheid
[53:52] Ephesians chapter 5
[53:54] verse 22 discover 7 said
[54:00] up to 27 is
[54:12] wife submit to your own husband as the
[54:16] Lord as to the Lord for the husband is
[54:19] the head of the wife as also Christ is
[54:22] the head of the uh the head of the
[54:24] church and he is the savior of the body
[54:28] is
[54:33] therefore just as the church is subject
[54:35] to Christ so let the wives be to their
[54:39] own husband in everything
[54:42] is
[54:46] husbands love your wives just as Christ
[54:49] also loved the church and gave himself
[54:51] for her and then do
[54:58] that he might be Sanctified and cleansed
[55:01] with uh cleans her with the washing
[55:04] Waters by the world and find the fair
[55:07] Pareto de families
[55:17] that he might present her to himself as
[55:20] a glorious church not having spot or
[55:23] wrinkle or any such thing but the uh but
[55:27] that she should be holy and without
[55:29] blemish
[55:35] 32 this is a great mystery but I speak
[55:38] concerning cross in the church let us
[55:41] pray
[55:43] wonderful Lord Jesus Christ
[55:50] bless your word that we just read we can
[55:53] see the
[55:56] levels that speaks and interpret law
[56:00] and also bless the heart are going to
[56:03] listen to him
[56:05] in the name of the Lord Jesus we've
[56:07] separate amen amen may God bless you
[56:18] foreign
[56:28] separating Waters
[56:31] and the
[56:35] subtitle it's death brings life
[56:42] two seconds
[56:45] everything that we read in Old Testament
[56:53] it's just a type of a new testament
[56:59] the Old Testament is a shadow
[57:04] and the New Testament is the reality
[57:08] yes
[57:11] so if we see a shot of something passing
[57:14] by
[57:16] the the
[57:21] if you see a shot of an elephant
[57:23] elephant passing by
[57:25] one of us
[57:28] you're not going to expect to see a man
[57:30] passing by
[57:32] real
[57:34] you'll see really a man passing by
[57:40] reality because the shadow it's
[57:43] reflecting the reality
[57:49] and the prophet said all the types that
[57:52] were in the Old Testament
[58:04] All The Parables all the names all the
[58:07] all the types
[58:10] of Samson
[58:12] that you know really
[58:18] that says uh the one who eats from him
[58:21] came something that can we can eat they
[58:24] pray foreign
[58:34] all of that should really reflect what
[58:37] we're living today in decent time
[58:43] in the message the only place of worship
[58:46] the prophet the lands silence
[58:51] the prophet says if the Old Testament
[58:54] was a shadow of a new testament
[58:57] [Music]
[59:01] then the New Testament is a shadow of
[59:04] the reality to come
[59:08] or unveiling God
[59:10] but ultrasound Transit paragraph 337
[59:17] he said everything you see
[59:20] all the parable of the Bible
[59:23] all the types of the Bible so manifests
[59:28] they are manifested right here before us
[59:50] Manifesto you see the value maintenance
[59:54] this type is manifested before us right
[59:56] now
[59:59] the parable that the Lord Jesus could
[1:00:01] use
[1:00:04] all of that are being manifested before
[1:00:10] because everything should be manifested
[1:00:12] at the end time in this age
[1:00:17] that's why the prophet says if God could
[1:00:20] ask him
[1:00:23] in which year in which age William
[1:00:26] Brothers
[1:00:37] [Music]
[1:00:44] when you read in Daniel
[1:00:48] Excel
[1:00:55] just seal it passes
[1:00:57] because it's concerning the end time
[1:01:00] Abram I will see there is
[1:01:03] Abraham desire to live in this age
[1:01:07] but he never lived in this age he just
[1:01:10] graded from afar level John the reveal
[1:01:14] uh
[1:01:16] when he saw all the ages passing back
[1:01:19] apocalypse said this he get to
[1:01:21] Revelation 10.
[1:01:24] he wanted to write everything that
[1:01:27] concerned in the end time on the Asia
[1:01:30] they told him
[1:01:31] don't write what you said just silly
[1:01:36] because this is concerning the last age
[1:01:41] [Music]
[1:01:42] there's no gonna be another end time or
[1:01:45] another last year
[1:01:49] decrease
[1:02:51] is because the Antichrist the Antichrist
[1:02:54] is deploy all his powers around
[1:02:59] you have taken all the possible colors
[1:03:06] it makes all the colors
[1:03:09] now is presenting himself in a uh purple
[1:03:13] purple color now we let the fish where
[1:03:17] it's so hard to discover it
[1:03:22] because he has to fulfill Matthew 24 24.
[1:03:26] where Jesus said
[1:03:29] in the last days
[1:03:39] they are going to perform miracles
[1:03:43] there is such a point to say juice if
[1:03:46] possible they elect
[1:03:47] foreign
[1:04:33] your message you'll never be received
[1:04:37] the business
[1:04:44] because God is not able to remove your
[1:04:46] name from The Book of uh of the Lamb
[1:04:49] yeah
[1:04:51] he can take it away from the uh the book
[1:04:54] of life
[1:04:56] but not in the book of uh
[1:05:00] of the life of the Lamb
[1:05:03] there's two things
[1:05:05] the prophet the
[1:05:07] Judah Prophet said or Judas is
[1:05:13] he was taken out of the Book of Life
[1:05:16] in a temper that delivered David he was
[1:05:20] not in the book of life of the Lamb s
[1:05:24] Destiny because the book of the life of
[1:05:27] the Lamb is for the predestinated people
[1:05:31] once your name is in the book of life
[1:05:34] it cannot be removed
[1:05:38] Ephraim Ephraim a done and then
[1:05:43] they were taken out of the book of
[1:05:45] course the Daily Dollar Tree because of
[1:05:48] idolatry
[1:05:50] but they were not in the book of the
[1:05:52] life of the Lamb amen amen
[1:05:56] so I was saying all the type of the
[1:05:59] Bible
[1:06:00] of the Old Testament All The Parables
[1:06:03] some manifested they found
[1:06:05] they are manifested before right now
[1:06:09] and God is busy fulfilling them right
[1:06:11] now the
[1:06:16] so in the book of numbers that we just
[1:06:19] read
[1:06:21] announced anymore they are giving us or
[1:06:23] they are giving us a teaching
[1:06:26] Israel is talking to Moses
[1:06:33] so they
[1:06:35] they how they
[1:06:36] they make the Waters of Separation
[1:06:40] why separation Waters
[1:06:44] to what they say to what they are useful
[1:06:49] what were they doing with the separation
[1:06:52] Waters
[1:06:54] and where were they getting them

[1:07:18] full constituations
[1:07:21] to make separation Waters
[1:07:27] they could take a red Huffer
[1:07:40] or choosing the red heifer
[1:07:45] why the red color
[1:07:50] the prophet said naturally in uh
[1:07:52] generally in literature
[1:07:57] the red the red color is the danger
[1:08:00] color
[1:08:01] can we say Amen
[1:08:04] and I I believe every one of you drives
[1:08:08] once you get to Lord
[1:08:12] where there's a traffic light
[1:08:15] okay
[1:08:28] the red light either the camera I'm
[1:08:31] gonna take a picture
[1:08:33] you've been recorded and you're gonna
[1:08:35] pay the penalties
[1:08:41] it's going to pull you over and give you
[1:08:43] a chance
[1:08:45] and just because
[1:08:47] you may lose a lot of things
[1:08:50] if you don't pay your ticket
[1:08:55] they can even take away your driver's
[1:08:57] license
[1:08:59] and you have a problem to go to work
[1:09:07] it shows that there's a danger you gotta
[1:09:10] stop
[1:09:11] says that's in nature
[1:09:15] the red color is the color of danger
[1:09:18] mercy and also poorly choir for
[1:09:21] believers
[1:09:22] the red color the person
[1:09:26] the the call of danger
[1:09:30] [Music]
[1:09:32] but for God the red Allah is the call of
[1:09:35] redemption
[1:09:37] when we see a red color we see
[1:09:40] redemptions
[1:09:41] when we see red we see the blood cells
[1:09:45] that's the first line the first skull of
[1:09:49] the the the uh of a rainbow same food
[1:09:53] that fellas
[1:09:54] if you got a stage of a perfect man
[1:10:00] after the base the first color that
[1:10:03] starts
[1:10:05] [Music]
[1:10:07] and the red color shows the love
[1:10:10] Redemption
[1:10:13] God so loves the world says
[1:10:28] shall never perish
[1:10:31] but he may have eternal life
[1:10:34] so the red color is the color of
[1:10:36] redemption they love Redemption
[1:10:39] and we every day sing about it he died
[1:10:47] by Grace the Redemption love of God in
[1:10:51] Redemption
[1:10:56] God that's a shield Witnesses
[1:11:18] that's what Paul says
[1:11:21] that he laughed he called him
[1:11:30] he glorified
[1:11:37] he manifested him Islam before we do
[1:11:41] anything he said comments are coming
[1:11:42] inside it's like Jacob
[1:11:44] yeah God said that God loves Jacob
[1:11:50] and it hurts
[1:11:53] before those children were born
[1:11:57] while he is never done anything
[1:12:01] and Jacob Never Dies
[1:12:04] but the Bible says
[1:12:07] it's not because
[1:12:16] God just left him
[1:12:19] God have loved us
[1:12:23] before we do anything
[1:12:27] so you gotta understand that Redemption
[1:12:30] once you understand the redemptions
[1:12:39] in
[1:13:28] this ruse go and get a red heifer pandem
[1:13:33] Porter calculator not any other
[1:13:36] colors but just found a red effort
[1:13:41] as we just said
[1:13:46] all those who were in the Old Testament
[1:13:48] they were Shadows are in a significance
[1:13:52] everything has a meaning another one
[1:13:54] took a separately significance
[1:13:57] and we'll see all those meanings because
[1:13:59] it's very important for us so that's
[1:14:01] important it's so important for us the
[1:14:04] the red color
[1:14:12] because they don't understand the
[1:14:14] meaning of the red color
[1:14:17] for the world the red is a dangerous the
[1:14:22] red color is the dangerous
[1:14:25] or they hit a uh
[1:14:30] they killed a gun
[1:14:33] I think it is
[1:14:37] he was laying down
[1:14:41] that his blood was or flooring
[1:14:45] you know when they shot somebody
[1:14:48] police comes and rape him up man inside

[1:15:01] uh to to avoid the blood of the Gang
[1:15:05] foreign
[1:15:14] pleasure of birth people were afraid the
[1:15:18] pietino
[1:15:20] to step on the blood of a gun
[1:15:26] to step upon the blood of his son
[1:15:32] to step upon the blood of God
[1:15:37] the blood of God is the message that's
[1:15:40] the blood of God
[1:15:42] we don't have to step on the blood of
[1:15:44] God
[1:15:45] we're going to take care of the blood of

[1:16:08] today
[1:16:35] and to get me
[1:16:38] please
[1:16:40] his blood is more powerful
[1:16:44] than any other substances

[1:16:56] provided

[2:01:48] foreign
[2:03:19] the prophet said
[2:03:21] foreign
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:55] the color the white color is justice
[2:03:59] but inside of that Woods
[2:04:03] Branham said this is some red line
[2:04:08] the red lines is a type of redemption
[2:04:15] that's why from the beginning God
[2:04:18] recommended should be a red heifer
[2:04:21] with chromosy
[2:04:27] which is a link of a high purple which
[2:04:31] is red yeah
[2:04:33] it is
[2:04:39] rehab the prostitution use the red hope
[2:04:53] on the efficacy all of that is meanings
[2:04:58] just for the Redemption of the church
[2:05:02] what was in the Old Testament like a
[2:05:06] type
[2:05:08] it has been manifested today
[2:05:12] all the time
[2:05:22] the eyes of which is faith
[2:05:27] the red hope which is uh Redemption look
[2:05:30] what they said they see the wood
[2:05:33] s
[2:05:35] uh the white color the justice
[2:05:40] and and the red lines inside the city
[2:05:45] the red red lines inside the Cedarwood
[2:05:50] which means the Redemption
[2:05:54] May somebody say Amen to that
[2:05:58] the prophet Lee the prophet says
[2:06:10] he said burn all of that
[2:06:14] upon
[2:06:16] the promise said the cedar wood
[2:06:21] foreign
[2:06:30] the promise in the Bible was the wool of
[2:06:32] the lamb but tented with blind
[2:06:36] Redemption the red represent our
[2:06:38] Redemption
[2:06:41] is should be added to the redheads
[2:06:48] then the Cedarwood speaks about the
[2:06:50] cross the cross look what they said
[2:06:55] it's wide but having some red lights
[2:06:58] and the white speaks about Justice
[2:07:02] and the red speaks about them
[2:07:05] that makes it justice
[2:07:09] the cross was a curse
[2:07:12] do you know that
[2:07:15] the cross was what is
[2:07:19] foreign
[2:07:23] because whoever should be or
[2:07:27] uh upon the cross hey conscience and
[2:07:31] when Jesus came
[2:07:34] he he carried that curse
[2:07:40] he went with that
[2:07:42] until they go they accepted them he
[2:07:45] accepted to die upon the cross
[2:07:49] came because
[2:07:52] so that we may become blessings
[2:07:58] so that we may become righteous
[2:08:01] the cross was a cursed but today
[2:08:06] it becomes blessing foreign
[2:08:24] first
[2:08:32] then we have a sunset today
[2:08:36] we cannot go with one week
[2:08:42] always flies
[2:08:52] this is
[2:08:57] for us to understand the Redemption plan
[2:08:59] we're taking them
[2:09:01] we look into the Bible
[2:09:04] we take glasses which is the best of
[2:09:06] hours
[2:09:08] and the message gives us all the
[2:09:10] meanings all the meanings of the word in
[2:09:13] the Bible
[2:09:14] in the Bible
[2:09:18] the meaning of the types in the Bible
[2:09:21] we don't understand the Bible
[2:09:24] like people out there understanding but
[2:09:27] we understand the Bible
[2:09:29] we analyze the Bible with the message
[2:09:33] this is what about the Bible says that's
[2:09:36] the interpretation of that the Bible
[2:09:38] says this and this is the interpretation
[2:09:42] if I was reading the Bible
[2:09:47] it says
[2:09:51] the hell is eternal
[2:09:54] I will go back to the message
[2:09:56] in the dictionary
[2:10:12] that's the only life
[2:10:16] yes
[2:10:28] only God himself
[2:10:43] even after Millions years
[2:11:01] comes from God Alone
[2:11:04] amen amen amen amen
[2:11:11] and the red speaks about the blood which
[2:11:14] makes it righteous
[2:11:19] Ness
[2:11:24] the cross was a curse until Jesus was
[2:11:27] was hanged upon it Allah
[2:11:33] then we embracing that with our hearts
[2:11:37] we embracing the heart in our hearts the
[2:11:40] cross in our hearts because it was a
[2:11:42] curious
