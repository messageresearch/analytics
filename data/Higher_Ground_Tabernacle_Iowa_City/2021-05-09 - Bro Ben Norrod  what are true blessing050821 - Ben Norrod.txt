TRANSCRIPT
========================================
music profession mission the lord knows i love it and i can spend all day in it i certainly could i sure love it and enjoy the presence of the lord amen well god bless you tonight amen sure appreciate the lord allowing us to get here amen and uh sure appreciate with isaiah for allowing us to come by this way we're going to spend the weekend with you here in iowa city and uh iowa city trust and the lord will give us good meetings this weekend we're just going to trust god to speak to us tonight and then pray for rapture in the morning hallelujah matthew 5 verse 2. what you're saying and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are they elected father thank you for your word this evening that we might receive that which you want to speak to us tonight [Music] amen how many english speakers we got in here tonight all right we're just certainly going to be mindful of him i hope he ate his wheaties tonight amen amen hope he's ready to go i usually wear out a few interpreters when i go overseas i try to take it easy on you tonight hey man how many appreciate amen the reading of the bible i believe it's god's word i believe that with all of my heart and for a title for a subject this evening i'd like to call this name yeah i would like to announce tonight what are true blessings now i want you to listen to me real careful tonight as we get started in this song because true blessings of god benediction i want to parallel them or liken them was that a person could start in the very beginning of their journey with the lord and they could repent come up so far and not go any further in advance we know that judas was one such person like that brother said he was justified he was sanctified it repented so far till even jesus said that they were sanctified by the word so repentance can come so far and then have a stopping point if you will where a person can come all the way up to say we'll use one through 10. they can come up to a seven or eight i'll let the angels get just because the rain might fall on a person and they might feel happy in their spirits they might feel like rejoicing they might remember what acts 2 38 teaches us to repent and then be baptized in order to receive the holy ghost those that are a part of that in other words like my pastor used to say years ago their sinning days are over what people say they are blessed as college it is a blessing in some degree but it is only the reign of the holy spirit or can fall but there is a blessing reserved for the people of god that is not a partial blessing not a halfway deal in the party the military let's turn galatians chapter 3 now let's just read this before we get too deep into this because i want you to see what the scripture says galatians 3 and 13 the scripture teaches us christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law you can quote it brother you don't have necessarily it might take too much time to find it okay christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse it is written cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree that the blessing of abraham abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit should be the that blessings are not what we thank blessings come on somebody help me appreciate this all the way amen in other words if we are to receive the blessing then there's gonna have to be a sacrifice there's going to have to be a giving of yourself in order to receive the blessing amen stay with me just a little while but christ was the spiritual son of abraham now remember he had three sons isaac ishmael and jesus by the natural promise god made him sacrifice till he got isaac hallelujah abraham went 25 years before that boy showed up god made him wait from the very moment he spoke to him god parked the holy did you know that it is scriptural standing still is not backslid when you've done everything you can can't you have to signature stand and make you wait many years on the lord to do something whether it's in your health whether it's in your family whether it's in your finances uh this is what we call the silent years of the bible 15 years at least 17 years on we don't see anything from jesus from the time he's 12 to 30. and parked him hey and said this time now you're going to grow up because every one of us should be able to identify with what i'm preaching [Music] he hallelujah i said hallelujah amen amen notice the holy ghost pull the bride over make you wait you say that's crazy but jesus smoke you had this shortcut it's in that hour people got discouraged and that's right he didn't [Applause] that the barns were overflowing there was no way that we could have understood this message in the 90s we were still trying to know [Applause] every assembly we're beginning to understand hallelujah amen that's the holy ghost please show us who he is [Music] father revealed to him who he was jesus and john would have been considered cousins by the way but when john saw that pillar of fire over here he said the people call on the face behold the lamb of god takes away the sins of the world amen and then what did god do with his prophets amen that's what god done in this generation took william branham didn't show his plan if we can learn in those times not work not work on [Applause] if he ain't moved yet then i better hold still [Music] [Music] it couldn't have got up not one second earlier than what it was supposed to do from the outside people would have looked at that cold lifeless frame they look at the frame of the church it's like they looked at the frame of jesus the message is dead churches are better than us [Applause] moving is shortly before gettysburg was fought that's in pennsylvania if you don't know american history it's one of the bloodiest of all the civil wars they would halt the armies around the camp taking place the holy [Music] just like it didn't look like anything was happening when job was sitting on that ash the very day that he was burying his sons and his daughters it was because god had been bragging on him yeah they got this because the holy ghost has been bragging on your characters [Music] [Music] where they will not give in or but i will not take my hand off my children for nothing because you've been holding on because he's been holding on to it man without this cross he would have never saw the resurrection don't forget he was one of the first ones to preach to us body change depression oppression enoch and abraham manifested it but job was one of the first scriptures we go to for resurrection selectively so how can you destroy one body and still have flesh that's the resurrection bank blessing is not how well your business is blessing is not whether you got a new car or not the true blessing of the lord comes just like it did to abraham let's look at him okay when god first speaks to this just pick it up in genesis chapter two oh i know it's hard for some of y'all to believe a prophet could be a heathen but he was just saying that who passed your friend prophet yes he was all sinners are heathens we got to get saved that was his identity from the tower of babylon he would carve out of the trees and woods and things he would carve idols have roots if we fairly dull the the the the sin they were heathens god comes to this heathen hey do you have an inner city walk before me and be perfect by the way i'm going to give you a son old man abraham hillary clinton but this is what prophets this is what it's all about right now god gave them these kind of lives for our example if you can number we do the same thing shows god tells us separate jerusalem and a lot comes with us now [Laughter] but when he departed from the presence of the lord with him just like you and i do god god will call us on this journey and we won't separate ourselves from our baggage with us i love the simplicity of the scripture amen i've been looking at his name all these years i didn't see that till the other day but there he is just the same yeah brother said he always was a problem to abraham and god could never fully bless us from the lord that come with him [Music] talking about all their baggage and i could have saved you 29 minutes and 39 seconds if you just be willing to separate yourself from all of that nonsense psychologically get it or how to emotionally receive it i don't want you to carry your baggage at all i want we have a well i wouldn't move forward but no more issues as long as you hold on to that experience you never will move forward amen no doubt abram probably said hey man that's my nephew whatever i can't walk off and leave my name but he did eventually [Music] eventually because god fixed it [Applause] the best thing you can leave no no no no it's all of your lots of the feet of jesus christ oh i'm preaching now as your punishment on that's why you're getting quiet that's oh somebody's told him something can we hear this song you're right somebody did tell me something and we can come back as your question was that same one that's anointing me tonight to you it's time to separate from that past the praise the lord and hallelujah well praise the lord shall we go on okay i was going to anyways but i thought i'd be nice and ask first [Laughter] now watch here jesus said blessed are they now go back and look at these beatitudes these are not casual worshippers these are not just sunday morning churchgoers let's take one we don't have time for all of them blessed are the pouring spirits you know what it means to be poor in spirit means well the the baby hollered at least somebody's hollering tonight y'all are just looking at me yeah everybody threw one come on now come on preach for me a little while it was very blessed all the pouring spirits yes babies secret support for this should be humble amen y'all just looking at me come on now this is not you know buy this little bottle of oil for two hundred and fifty dollars this is not prosperity preaching let me lay my hands on you and god the will of god god will bless you you preach it in the right way god will so bless my best situation you know my name is my business that's not the kind of prosperity jesus christ all right that's exactly right what's the exact deposition are in other words blessed are those that are empty brother branham says perfect strength by perfect weakness in other words god wants you to be more than just a blessed person being a blessed person is different than being blessed elvis presley was blessed he was you can take a gift and send yourself to hell with it know they're they're always you know shaking their body around vulgar like he moved to july never fails i want to thank my lord and savior jesus christ he ain't a bit more your savior than a rabbit's got snowshoes hey you can't translate that amen but i couldn't help i got to say it he is [Laughter] i just want to thank the lord he blessed me with this grammy award some country singers singing about losing his wife or being drunk all the time i just want to thank my lord and savior jesus christ now they are blessed i look it's the most dangerous thing you've ever seen you say brother ben is that true well i'll ask you a question again if a guy come walking what's [Music] amen i read it just the other morning so being blessed hello benny doesn't always mean everything you wear is brand new hey listen i've had a lot of people give me things in my life i said i'm an that's what peter said well i didn't want to come to the beautiful he said i haven't gotten that kind of stuff is that silver and gold have i done huh anything you ever got it just put it right back in the preaching come again yeah did you get it amen and peter in other words when he went up to the gate remember he said i don't have any silver or gold [Laughter] i ain't got none genetic hey man i know you could translate that now here's the point i'm trying to make to you hello now some people would have looked on peter and said you're poor uh some people say people that some folks with money they're blessed but if they don't know anything about the character of jesus christ you're not he didn't [Applause] folks running all the way around the church they're blessed but let's look at their lives do they have peace with god you know do they have true joy is [Music] i've been preaching an evangelistical sermon every every thursday evening be sure to join me sometime if you'd like to because we've seen god doing a lot of things to preach it through the media like that basketball video guess one of the sermons that i brought the other night that seemed to help the people the most it means to put it in in other words call a truce between the one you're at war with the person that's they fill all of the figures they're still at war with god in their souls come to the end of the world they still fight with the world fighting with them i am no longer at war with jesus it is a time of tranquility he has won the war pascal you ever seen a tug of war tug of war you know what tug of war is you grab the rope you're on that side i'm on this sideline obey me hey man let me tell you something bro when jesus won this war at calvary i've got to come in obedience to him [Applause] yes i'll laugh at your calamity i'll laugh at your troubles i'll actually make fun of you we want to respond to him let the war be over there like yeah let's call a truce amen i'm done fighting praise [Applause] [Music] you know what variableness means no let me explain variableness the root of variableness is very la la la ha the the very vari means making choices in other words today i like it tomorrow i don't like it we say in english that's varying in other words you're not being stable but the bible said glory to god he has no varying habit once he makes a decision he don't change amen oh my god somebody man somebody help me right now they didn't walk up once god cannot decide to get you do you hear the people say this he didn't throw you out and say i'm done with you once amen third john third john chapter one that thou mayest prosper we've got a good prosperity sermon uh prosperity god wants you to be in health jfk god wants you to prosper that's true but let's keep reading the rest of the story even as thy soul prospers prosper so god wants you to be in health [Applause] [Applause] the key that opens the door for you la click you open your soul prospects the kingdom of god first the kingdom of god when what we should be doing is stopping my second development dissection and asking them if their soul is prospering don't run to no prayer line asking god to heal your body amen half of your list and the other half don't know what to do amen if you want me to help you in your soul don't be so selfish just to come up here and ask god they when you receive them and they should kill your body they get it what they [Applause] that's the whole reason people don't get nowhere because they come running up asking god to prosper themselves when they're not taking care of their souls hey listen god could even be good to you and heal your body but if you're not feeding your soul on the word of god and if you're not taking care of your wife [Music] amen well hallelujah amen see i'm a much different person than brother isaiah why is this young person isaiah is so nice and so sweet i know pastor will be back soon don't worry don't worry i'll be gone i'll be gone amen watch us in nehemiah chapter 13 verse 2. remember when the children of israel israel were rebuilding the wall of jerusalem records back to them about balaam and how he dealt with the children of israel affairs balaam sought to curse the children of israel fully or modify every [Music] [Music] [Music] in other words it backfires [Laughter] let's take it one step further first peter chapter three pierre this is verse eight through twelve if you like it uh amen it says be of one mind soyer that you are called uh here he comes is a pleasure that you should inherit a blessing now listen to me the holy ghost they want this baptism of it anybody can get the holy ghost not everybody can wonder only those that have an inheritance everybody can feel it don't in first corinthians chapter 5 verse 7 purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lamp amen oh my did you know that's all you are as a lump of you are very good at being lumps in church i'm talking about being a lump of humanity don't be olympic church you know that's just the whole lump you know amen amen don't be a lump at church amen be a lump on the devil that's who you should be atlanta but let's see what paul says here he said for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us not not not the pakistan so in other words we are unleavened because christ was sacrificed i'm close and i'm close did you catch that in other words because he took the cross my blessing is [Music] [Music] that is a true blessing god could heal your body he could heal your mind but if he doesn't heal yourself then you haven't received the true blessing and the true blessing of abraham amen you know what abraham's real blessing was that he could have the character to wait and wait until god was done with him can i wait on it even though it may not move as quick as i want him to memphis in advance i feel like this many years serving him certain things should already be gone [Laughter] just hold still thank you the blessing will come i bless your
