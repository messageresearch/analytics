[1:20:23] years and it's still as powerful As It
[1:20:26] Ever
[1:20:27] [Music]
[1:20:29] Was the Bible said that the name of
[1:20:32] Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue

[1:22:50] well when I need a friend you always

[1:23:05] without

[1:23:10] house break and Destroy every anointing

[1:23:29] Jesus keep us in your
[1:23:32] care in your lovely name Jesus we
[1:23:36] pray amen amen you may be
[1:23:43] seated I just want to say I thought the
[1:23:47] wedding went well last
[1:23:52] yesterday everything was
[1:23:56] lovely we appreciate everyone who showed
[1:23:58] up to
[1:24:02] support I'm sure our brother Christian
[1:24:04] and his wife Martin appreciated it chis
[1:24:11] Martin yeah I appreciate it and so I
[1:24:14] just got wor they wanted to thank you
[1:24:19] all everything you did for
[1:24:22] them so amen we just thank God for God's
[1:24:29] goodness there are two things I hate
[1:24:33] doing and that's
[1:24:36] weddings and
[1:24:40] funerals just so you know why just so
[1:24:44] you
[1:24:46] know but we do it
[1:24:49] anyway because it's so
[1:24:53] structured not going to go through all
[1:24:55] of that but we do the will of the father
[1:24:57] regardless to what I feel like and it's
[1:25:02] not anything personal
[1:25:04] against my wife said I've done that I
[1:25:07] mean uh my wife knows and she says I
[1:25:09] give too much
[1:25:14] information amen so if there's another
[1:25:18] wedding and and and and I'm here and you
[1:25:21] want me to do it well don't let what I
[1:25:23] just said
[1:25:27] God is good to
[1:25:29] us I love the wedding
[1:25:32] ceremony only when someone else is doing
[1:25:37] it so that you understand me God is good
[1:25:40] to us
[1:25:42] people and I love you all I really
[1:25:46] do I one thing I was thinking
[1:25:50] about in the
[1:25:52] office and I was thinking about Bram
[1:25:54] talks about Mr
[1:25:57] [Music]
[1:25:59] Lily Mr Lily and how the Lily starts in
[1:26:04] a muddy
[1:26:08] place but it grows up to be one of the
[1:26:11] most beautiful
[1:26:14] flowers and this is what I was thinking
[1:26:16] about you
[1:26:19] all we may have had a tough
[1:26:23] beginning but I believe the ending will
[1:26:25] be
[1:26:28] beautiful I believe that with all of my
[1:26:31] heart so we just want to encourage the
[1:26:34] saints of God
[1:26:35] here no matter what comes your
[1:26:38] way God has ordain
[1:26:41] you to be a light in this
[1:26:45] place hallelujah amen my subject this
[1:26:50] morning would be the resurrection in you
[1:26:55] I preached this
[1:26:58] Wednesday in De Mo because I wasn't
[1:27:01] going to be there
[1:27:04] today so I'm kind of working this thing
[1:27:07] in two
[1:27:11] ways this is part
[1:27:13] two but in order for me to preach part
[1:27:17] two must part one
[1:27:20] first because I
[1:27:23] believe the Resurrection is of no
[1:27:28] value to
[1:27:31] anyone except that
[1:27:35] Resurrection be in
[1:27:38] you the very fact that Jesus died and
[1:27:43] rose
[1:27:47] again is historically
[1:27:50] known but it's of no value
[1:27:54] other than history to
[1:27:56] those who have not made Jesus their
[1:28:01] choice in this message you and I have
[1:28:05] been so
[1:28:07] blessed because we've seen
[1:28:10] Jesus Even in our
[1:28:13] day amen hallelujah amen we're not
[1:28:18] worshiping a Jesus that is 2,000 years
[1:28:23] ago
[1:28:24] but we're worshiping a
[1:28:27] Jesus that visited Us in this
[1:28:31] day in the son of man
[1:28:35] Ministry
[1:28:36] Hallelujah we may have
[1:28:39] guessed what Jesus was like 2,000 years
[1:28:44] ago but we know by God's
[1:28:47] grace he cannot change his
[1:28:51] character hallelujah amen so when a son
[1:28:54] of man was introducing the son of
[1:28:59] man we saw Jesus
[1:29:03] Christ as he would operate as a
[1:29:07] prophet
[1:29:08] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[1:29:12] saying
[1:29:14] so the prophet of
[1:29:16] God encouraged us not to be not to ever
[1:29:22] become fund
[1:29:25] Al Hallelujah he taught us that the
[1:29:29] Church of the Living
[1:29:31] God must be a church that has
[1:29:35] power and
[1:29:38] authority hallelujah
[1:29:41] amen he thought he taught us that the
[1:29:45] Church of the Living
[1:29:47] God would be
[1:29:50] omnipotent and not by their own power
[1:29:54] but because the omnipotent God dwells
[1:29:57] within
[1:29:59] them Hallelujah and the
[1:30:03] Covenant that God has given
[1:30:06] us has been shown by way of
[1:30:10] Samson Hallelujah Samson was
[1:30:14] chosen to destroy the
[1:30:17] Philistines but
[1:30:19] Samson fell to
[1:30:22] Delilah is that right amen and Delilah
[1:30:26] was a type of the
[1:30:28] world but one
[1:30:31] day Samson after being
[1:30:36] defeated after being mocked and
[1:30:42] scorned something began to churn within
[1:30:44] his
[1:30:46] heart and he came to
[1:30:50] recognize that the Covenant that he had
[1:30:53] with God had been
[1:30:55] restored Hallelujah and at that
[1:30:59] time he cried out oh
[1:31:02] Lord once
[1:31:04] more and the god of
[1:31:07] Samson came on the
[1:31:10] scene Hallelujah the thing that I love
[1:31:13] about
[1:31:15] Samson is that he fulfilled his
[1:31:19] mission Hallelujah am yes sir so much so
[1:31:24] the Bible tells us that Samson killed
[1:31:27] more
[1:31:30] Philistine in his
[1:31:32] death that he did while he was
[1:31:35] living and the prophet of God says we
[1:31:38] must die to the
[1:31:41] world in order to be
[1:31:43] victorious hallelujah amen we must
[1:31:47] be those who will
[1:31:50] celebrate the death burier and
[1:31:52] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:31:55] Hallelujah not as a historical
[1:31:59] monument but we celebrate him because we
[1:32:04] know that he's alive and
[1:32:07] well oh some of y'all being
[1:32:09] quiet see the
[1:32:12] resurrection it doesn't mean that
[1:32:14] something else comes in place of
[1:32:17] something that went
[1:32:20] down in other words if a tree
[1:32:22] dies goes to the
[1:32:25] Grave if there's a
[1:32:27] resurrection the same
[1:32:30] tree that went down comes
[1:32:33] up Hallelujah so if there is a
[1:32:36] resurrection of
[1:32:39] Jesus it it just wasn't there in uh uh
[1:32:43] the time when Jesus
[1:32:46] died but we're talking about the
[1:32:49] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:51] for our day
[1:32:54] is that right amen hallelujah amen we
[1:32:58] understand Jesus was in the grave for
[1:33:00] three uh three uh three
[1:33:04] days hallelujah but the Bible says that
[1:33:08] he would not leave his soul in
[1:33:11] Hell neither will he allow his flesh to
[1:33:14] seek
[1:33:16] corruption Hallelujah and we
[1:33:19] understand that Jesus went to
[1:33:22] hell because he became our
[1:33:26] sin that we might become his
[1:33:29] righteousness hallelujah amen now we
[1:33:31] must understand that he became our
[1:33:36] sin that we might become his
[1:33:40] righteousness and the righteousness of
[1:33:42] God is not something you earn it is a
[1:33:47] gift of God hallelujah am my question
[1:33:51] this morning if Jesus Christ Christ is
[1:33:54] alive and
[1:33:56] well where is
[1:34:00] he hallelujah amen William brandom has
[1:34:04] gone he's in the other
[1:34:07] dimension but the Bible said God never
[1:34:09] left himself without a
[1:34:15] witness
[1:34:17] me he's
[1:34:20] alive hallelujah amen he's taking on
[1:34:23] another
[1:34:26] body another
[1:34:28] form Hallelujah this is what brother
[1:34:31] brandom describe as the god of
[1:34:35] imor Hallelujah and what did God
[1:34:39] do instead of just taking on another
[1:34:43] form he took on the form of his
[1:34:47] wife he calls her the
[1:34:50] bride Hallelujah and this woman
[1:34:54] called The Bride has been redeemed by
[1:34:58] his
[1:34:59] blood Hallelujah not only just
[1:35:03] redeemed but she is to be filled with
[1:35:06] the
[1:35:07] spirit is that right correct brother
[1:35:10] Brandon preached the statue of a perfect
[1:35:12] man and in that message he described the
[1:35:17] divine nature of
[1:35:19] God hallelujah well the bride is
[1:35:24] supposed to be
[1:35:27] Tabernacles of God's divine
[1:35:30] nature hallelujah amen now y'all getting
[1:35:32] quiet on me but let me give you a quote
[1:35:35] here you know because we look at at the
[1:35:38] day there people think because I call
[1:35:41] myself a message
[1:35:44] believer that guarantees me
[1:35:48] heaven it does
[1:35:51] not it didn't work for the
[1:35:54] Baptist it didn't work for the
[1:35:57] Methodist it didn't work for the
[1:35:59] Lutheran it didn't work for the
[1:36:01] apostolic or
[1:36:03] the Hallelujah and it will not work for
[1:36:06] the
[1:36:07] message you see because this
[1:36:10] message is a message of
[1:36:14] election this message is a message of
[1:36:20] predestination Hallelujah this message
[1:36:24] it's for a special class of
[1:36:26] people hallelujah amen now realize this
[1:36:31] according to the
[1:36:32] scripture Israel came out of
[1:36:36] Egypt but all who claim to be
[1:36:39] Israelites
[1:36:41] Israel were not chosen by
[1:36:45] God they were not of the chosen
[1:36:49] seed so when God calls
[1:36:52] out Hallelujah he calls out
[1:36:57] twins every Revival produce
[1:37:00] twins Hallelujah you've got the real
[1:37:04] seed and you have the false
[1:37:07] seed Hallelujah am one is
[1:37:11] fundamental one is
[1:37:13] intellectual and the other one is holy
[1:37:16] ghost
[1:37:17] fi Hallelujah now listen what brother
[1:37:20] I'm
[1:37:21] saying hallelujah coming from the
[1:37:23] message the resurrection of
[1:37:26] Lazarus par
[1:37:29] 11 he said you
[1:37:31] know sometimes I think
[1:37:34] that wonder how the Lord feels about us
[1:37:41] sometimes when he does so many things
[1:37:43] for
[1:37:45] us and yet we just set like we were in
[1:37:49] in a
[1:37:52] subconsciously
[1:37:54] don't
[1:37:55] we he said aren't we all
[1:38:00] guilty he said I
[1:38:02] am we just sit and
[1:38:06] say I wish you do something for
[1:38:10] me Hallelujah brother says he can't do
[1:38:15] nothing nothing no more for us than what
[1:38:19] he's already
[1:38:21] done he's already healed us
[1:38:24] he's already saved us he's already given
[1:38:28] us
[1:38:29] joy he he's G us his
[1:38:32] peace he's our
[1:38:35] Shield our
[1:38:37] buckler everything we have is in
[1:38:41] him and he done and he done paid the
[1:38:45] price of
[1:38:47] redemption to redeem us back as Sons and
[1:38:50] Daughters of
[1:38:52] God think about it how we treat
[1:38:57] him hallelujah amen when he's done
[1:39:01] everything we act as if he's done
[1:39:05] nothing there's only one thing in the
[1:39:08] world that is yet left
[1:39:12] undone that is a physical
[1:39:15] death we all got to
[1:39:19] die because that was the only way God
[1:39:22] has to bring us up her
[1:39:25] home the only we can travel is through
[1:39:32] death to get
[1:39:35] home so everything is under his
[1:39:39] feet everything except
[1:39:42] death and death has done been uh done
[1:39:45] been the penalty of death done been
[1:39:48] taken
[1:39:50] off and now we just go right into to the
[1:39:55] presence and someday
[1:39:59] back someday return
[1:40:01] back and he may made Immortal and life
[1:40:06] and live on earth a thousand
[1:40:11] years but let me pause here when you are
[1:40:14] truly born
[1:40:16] again you do not fear
[1:40:21] death most people people can't get their
[1:40:26] healings most people can't get a
[1:40:30] healing because they are afraid to
[1:40:34] die but if you push death out of the
[1:40:37] way cancer will mean nothing to
[1:40:41] you y'all hear what I'm saying amen the
[1:40:44] strongest
[1:40:46] demon that Satan
[1:40:50] has is greater than cancer
[1:40:54] it's greater than
[1:40:57] tuberculosis greater than
[1:41:00] diabetes greater than any other demon
[1:41:04] and the chief
[1:41:06] demon Of Satan is
[1:41:13] unbelief y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:41:15] because if you believe God cancer won't
[1:41:19] stand in the way is that what God told
[1:41:21] Brother bam he said if you can get the
[1:41:24] people to
[1:41:26] believe all things are
[1:41:29] possible Hallelujah am is that the truth
[1:41:33] and the Bride of Jesus Christ she is a
[1:41:38] Believer Hallelujah am no matter what
[1:41:41] comes her way she knows that God is more
[1:41:44] than
[1:41:46] able hallelujah amen Rejoice people of
[1:41:49] God if God is in
[1:41:52] you it he's a
[1:41:55] God that created heaven and earth he's a
[1:41:59] God that created of the universe he's a
[1:42:03] God that created time and space he's a
[1:42:08] God that created heaven and
[1:42:11] earth God that created you hallelujah
[1:42:16] amen what more can he do is there
[1:42:19] anything too hard for
[1:42:22] God
[1:42:24] and because God is wrapped in my
[1:42:26] [Music]
[1:42:27] flesh because God is wrapped in my
[1:42:31] flesh it does not make him
[1:42:36] weak
[1:42:38] amen because God is in your
[1:42:41] flesh it does not make him
[1:42:44] weak but the only way God can act upon
[1:42:47] his
[1:42:48] word that you have faith in his
[1:42:51] word hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[1:42:55] brother

[1:43:22] happened but I'll describe what he what
[1:43:24] he
[1:43:26] describes he said the fires of
[1:43:30] persecution have burnt
[1:43:33] them and the members have come
[1:43:36] in and the members has come in got
[1:43:40] ritualistic
[1:43:52] form
[1:43:55] in
[1:43:57] ungodliness and burnt the bar off of
[1:44:01] them and they are nothing but a dead
[1:44:04] bunch of
[1:44:08] Representatives see what he's
[1:44:10] saying if you're not
[1:44:12] careful
[1:44:14] trials
[1:44:16] tribulation the fires of the
[1:44:18] devil will burn you so much Hallelujah

[1:45:05] dead bunch of
[1:45:09] Representatives only to groan and
[1:45:15] moan and make a lot of fussing about

[1:54:31] Gabriel now minor Angels
[1:54:35] comes he he says my yes you see
[1:54:39] Angels everyone has a guard and an

[1:54:54] which is in heaven Hallelujah here's
[1:54:58] some time
[1:54:59] ago a minister told

[1:55:08] thing as seeing
[1:55:10] Angels Angels don't lead the church the
[1:55:14] Holy Ghost leads the
[1:55:16] church I said that's right but we have
[1:55:21] angels being as ministering
[1:55:25] Spirits sent from the presence of

[1:56:05] teaches and he said well brother Bram
[1:56:08] Angels might have been back in Daniel's
[1:56:11] time and back
[1:56:13] there but not since the Holy Ghost has
[1:56:16] come no
[1:56:20] angels I had a brother come to
[1:56:23] me a young man and I thought he was
[1:56:25] coming to know more about the truth
[1:56:28] because he wanted to be a
[1:56:31] preacher but he came to my
[1:56:34] office with a big old envelope of
[1:56:37] stuff this is and he came to disprove
[1:56:41] that brother Brandon Was
[1:56:49] Elijah and then he came with the NIV
[1:56:54] version Oh the NIV version what is NIV
[1:56:59] NIV say what different from the King

[1:59:38] literal
[1:59:39] word it is the revelation of the

[2:16:13] life this is the quote I'm going to end
[2:16:15] up the service
[2:16:18] with have you ever come to to the place
[2:16:22] in life where Christ meant more to you
[2:16:26] than all the arguing you could
[2:16:36] do has Christ meant more to you than all
[2:16:40] the
[2:16:44] world I don't mean from an emotion or a
[2:16:48] mental
[2:16:49] workup I mean from the depths of your
[2:16:59] heart that something settled in
[2:17:04] there something taken
[2:17:08] place that you don't know how it
[2:17:13] come but you hear
[2:17:16] away and your whole emot your whole
[2:17:19] motive is to serve Jesus
[2:17:23] Christ have you entered that
[2:17:26] place my dear
[2:17:28] [Music]
[2:17:31] brother have you come into that place
[2:17:33] where you don't care what anyone
[2:17:39] says not to go out and act
[2:17:44] smart but to the love of God Is So
[2:17:47] anchored into
[2:17:49] you that you can't see nothing
[2:17:54] else your whole motive is to do the will
[2:17:57] of
[2:18:00] God love for
[2:18:02] everybody flowing free from
[2:18:06] everywhere he says what a place to
[2:18:10] [Music]
[2:18:12] live that's the hidden
[2:18:15] place that's the place where we got to
[2:18:17] come
[2:18:19] to my
[2:18:22] that's the place where God reveals the
[2:18:24] secret
[2:18:27] things that's the place where God does
[2:18:30] the placing and the
[2:18:35] calling so everything I've tried to say
[2:18:38] this
[2:18:40] morning I summarized it in one
[2:18:47] quote and this message is the hidden
[2:18:49] life in 195

[2:19:00] is if the Rapture had taken place this
[2:19:05] morning who would have been
[2:19:10] prepared who would have been who can
[2:19:12] truly say I'm ready I've
[2:19:17] made brother vom said I believe the
[2:19:21] Rapture will happen in at the spring
[2:19:24] time he said I I don't know for certain
[2:19:26] he said but that's where Life
[2:19:29] Begin
[2:19:30] that's in the
[2:19:32] spring and he said I believe that's when
[2:19:35] it's going to
[2:19:36] happen he said but whenever it happen I
[2:19:39] just want to be part of
[2:19:42] it hallelujah amen and if we go on with
[2:19:47] nature according to the Jewish
[2:19:49] law

[2:21:42] reflecting my life in

[2:21:57] thing how it must make God feel good to
[2:22:02] know that he has got
[2:22:05] somebody can put trust

[2:23:06] body not by one denomination not by one
[2:23:10] organiz not because I believe this
[2:23:13] message devil believe the message and he
[2:23:17] trembles is how much of the message that
[2:23:20] I can see in
[2:23:22] you how much of the message you can see
[2:23:25] in
[2:23:26] me it's more than
[2:23:29] singing it's more than

[2:23:57] of the blood is what God is looking for
[2:24:00] so when I see the Life of Christ I will
[2:24:04] pass over you hallelujah amen that's
[2:24:07] what he's looking for the Life of Christ

[2:41:59] church um we had uh several of the
[2:42:03] sisters uh that came up and I hope they
[2:42:06] don't mind me telling you and and I
[2:42:09] would say 90% of the uh young ladies
[2:42:12] were suffering from some kind of
[2:42:15] anxiety I I don't she uh
[2:42:21] [Music]
[2:42:28] [Music]
[2:42:31] I don't know what's going
[2:42:34] on and why Satan f is fighting you with
[2:42:40] this but the devil is a
[2:42:44] liar uh you're the Bride of
[2:42:48] Jesus and and and you know even at times
[2:42:51] when I'm
[2:42:54] preaching I I try to preach Hope and
[2:43:01] Faith the words that I
[2:43:04] preached are not to produce
[2:43:08] anxiety but it's trying to bring you to
[2:43:10] a
[2:43:12] freedom uh you don't worry about
[2:43:16] uh uh uh Missing the
[2:43:19] [Music]
[2:43:21] Rapture if you believe that you are the
[2:43:24] [Music]
[2:43:26] rapt you believe that you're the true
[2:43:28] true seed of
[2:43:31] God you hold to
[2:43:34] that see your
[2:43:38] journey is not your
[2:43:41] destiny your journey is just part of
[2:43:46] it in in the journey you go through
[2:43:48] Mountain Mountain across
[2:43:51] Mountain through
[2:43:53] valleys you have rivers to
[2:43:57] cross but that's not your stopping
[2:44:01] point your your your journey does not um
[2:44:05] uh Define your
[2:44:09] destiny y understand what I'm trying to
[2:44:11] say look what Jesus had to
[2:44:15] suffer that was the journey he had to go
[2:44:18] through
[2:44:21] but his
[2:44:22] Destiny you find in the Book of
[2:44:28] Revelation when the lamb was able open
[2:44:31] the book and loose the
[2:44:36] seals y'all hear what I'm
[2:44:39] saying because you
[2:44:41] suffer because you go through trials
[2:44:44] your
[2:44:45] life it does not mean that you're lost
[2:44:47] and it doesn't mean that
[2:44:51] and preachers are here to try to
[2:44:53] finetune
[2:44:55] you sh the light in your life to see
[2:44:58] where Satan is
[2:45:02] hiding but you're not to allow you
[2:45:04] should not
[2:45:06] allow uh your
[2:45:09] trials to make you full of
[2:45:15] anxiety anxiety is of the devil
[2:45:20] and the Bible said be anxious for
[2:45:26] nothing the Bible says also they that
[2:45:29] wait upon the
[2:45:30] [Music]
[2:45:31] Lord their
[2:45:33] strength and they shall Mount up with
[2:45:35] wings of
[2:45:37] eagles they shall run and not
[2:45:39] [Music]
[2:45:41] we they shall walk and not
[2:45:44] faint so don't let Satan put that on
[2:45:47] you whenever you feel
[2:45:51] that get somewhere and
[2:45:54] pray until that Spirit
[2:45:59] leaves okay amen I believe that's where
[2:46:02] the problems
[2:46:05] lie is that we're not praying where
[2:46:12] enough anxiety is a horrible
[2:46:16] spirit I don't know whether uh you know
[2:46:19] that that that that's not good I've
[2:46:22] experienced it
[2:46:26] before and I want to say that anxiety is
[2:46:30] a branch of
[2:46:33] fear something
[2:46:36] Fe and you don't have to fear
[2:46:41] anything God came to give you peace
[2:46:44] people not
[2:46:47] anxiety and I'm not can you but I'm just
[2:46:51] saying that's where the enemy is your
[2:46:53] fear and fear brings
[2:46:56] anxiety Hallelujah and and and
[2:47:01] somewhere like I said there's unbelief
[2:47:04] somewhere you can't have faith at the
[2:47:07] same
[2:47:09] time so I pray that God would increase
[2:47:12] your faith in
[2:47:13] him and remove all of the doubt and fear
[2:47:20] hallelujah amen you love the
[2:47:22] Lord
