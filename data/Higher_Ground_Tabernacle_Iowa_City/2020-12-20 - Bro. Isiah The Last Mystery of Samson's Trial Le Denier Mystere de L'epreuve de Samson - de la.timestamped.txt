[1:35:54] hallelujah
[1:36:01] so what happens she finally tells him
[1:36:04] and he goes into what we call
[1:36:07] a blindness church leglesses
[1:36:12] but understand we got twins working here
[1:36:14] those of all they make their vices one
[1:36:16] false and one truth
[1:36:20] so when there was a portion there was a
[1:36:22] in that scripture it looked like
[1:36:24] samson had come to his end
[1:36:28] there was another portion show that
[1:36:29] samson was just coming to his beginning
[1:36:35] to kill the philistines
[1:36:48] so you'll see the mystery of these seven
[1:36:50] seals
[1:37:04] but it was growing
[1:37:32] look so weak
[1:37:35] never near possibilities this message
[1:37:38] looks so weak so fable see like it does
[1:37:42] come right now amen
[1:37:45] oh you don't have to say amen you don't
[1:37:48] have to say it it's true anyhow
[1:37:51] we got people amen who's committing
[1:37:53] adultery and fornication and stealing
[1:37:55] and lying and drinking and losing
[1:38:00] follicles
[1:38:14] this way is a way of holiness
[1:38:19] amen this way is a way of holiness
[1:38:28] hallelujah
[1:38:42] is
[1:39:23] no doubt he called back the days when he
[1:39:25] was first illuminated
[1:39:32] and then samson said hey
[1:39:35] lord remember me say yeah
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:55] that the world of the philistine was
[1:39:57] coming to destruction
[1:40:02] your brother brown said you gotta die
[1:40:04] and rot from our medical foreign
[1:40:19] you know we understand that the death is
[1:40:21] riding okay is that right
[1:40:26] death is riding right now
[1:40:31] it's a spiritual death spiritual
[1:40:33] hallelujah
[1:40:34] amen is that right brother brown said
[1:40:36] you can do a thing
[1:40:37] so much god says
[1:40:41] that's enough jesus christ
[1:40:45] you think everybody knows do you think
[1:40:47] the pentecostal church know they did
[1:40:52] look on youtube
[1:40:56] they're shouting dancing he does
[1:40:59] they're speaking in tongues supposedly
[1:41:02] interpretations
[1:41:07] hallelujah amen and they are growing it
[1:41:10] is
[1:41:10] what's remarkable did you know that the
[1:41:13] the the god the philistines actually
[1:41:15] worshipped with degas
[1:41:30] they're growing in numbers from my
[1:41:32] number hallelujah amen
[1:41:34] that's how they killed us second second
[1:41:36] hallelujah amen
[1:41:38] is that right yes in closing
[1:41:41] listen he said samson did he get some
[1:41:44] song
[1:41:44] was the main event
[1:41:49] i had people doing all kinds of tricks
[1:41:52] let me see this job
[1:41:53] visit everything but the main event
[1:41:57] man living him up was about
[1:42:10] since i mentioned fornication adultery
[1:42:13] and things like that
[1:42:15] sad face
[1:42:26] you listen if it doesn't affect you say
[1:42:28] hallelujah
[1:42:34] but some of y'all looking like y'all
[1:42:42] [Music]
[1:42:57] [Music]
[1:43:20] see you got to realize we're talking
[1:43:22] about spiritual blindness
[1:43:25] hallelujah
[1:43:29] amen amen it's a do of the word
[1:43:32] not just a hero of the world
[1:43:40] so you can understand amen by god's
[1:43:41] grace god means business folks
[1:43:45] [Music]
[1:43:48] and you and i know that samson slew more
[1:43:50] in his death than he did
[1:43:51] in his lifetime
[1:43:56] you said brother i don't know about this
[1:43:59] let me read a quote from brother branham
[1:44:03] and oh lord just once more in phone
[1:44:05] calls today
[1:44:06] he said and my subject like this morning
[1:44:11] is to what state that i think the
[1:44:14] pentecostal church
[1:44:15] is of this day
[1:44:31] now let us quote that again
[1:44:46] to say it like this all of
[1:44:50] us know that we cannot make a rapture in
[1:44:53] this condition
[1:45:00] just like samson knew he could not
[1:45:01] please god shall come somewhere
[1:45:05] the world to get him into the condition
[1:45:11] almost all of us if not
[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:27] unless you cry out
[1:45:31] [Music]
[1:45:42] that's
[1:45:55] but you gotta have a revelation i know
[1:45:58] that there is a possibility there's a
[1:46:00] impossibility is that the truth you
[1:46:03] still have everything
[1:46:04] see that's the mystery because why
[1:46:07] samson's hair was growing
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:46:48] got enough strength to at least walk and
[1:46:50] then push to push the grinder
[1:47:06] this message got to be more than a
[1:47:08] church service
[1:47:10] somebody help me here
[1:47:13] how are we going to get there humility
[1:47:17] humility we gotta humble ourselves
[1:47:48] because you're
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:29] let me read this last i think it's this
[1:48:30] last one i want to do
[1:48:32] same same same message but i'm going to
[1:48:34] read this in closing
[1:48:38] see i'm going to read a little it's
[1:48:40] going to be
[1:48:41] this is not quote this is uh something
[1:48:43] i'm reading now
[1:48:44] and i wanted to you to understand it's
[1:48:46] going to be a real personal thing
[1:48:49] it's got to be a heavy sacrifice
[1:48:53] but right now we're so busy there's
[1:48:56] something
[1:48:57] trying to establish ourselves in this
[1:48:59] earth
[1:49:01] and we're so stabilized we're putting
[1:49:04] more time
[1:49:04] in something
[1:49:06] [Music]
[1:49:09] that we put in for prayer you understand
[1:49:39] you got to be ready
[1:49:54] oh
[1:49:57] but you know what i i have to let people
[1:49:59] know you know what's everywhere
[1:50:04] so i'm going to say this
[1:50:08] it's going to have to be a heavier
[1:50:09] sacrifice than we make
[1:50:12] sacrifices a lot of time we feel like we
[1:50:15] we get the church like god owed us a
[1:50:17] favor
[1:50:17] shock for the vanilla please come see
[1:50:19] now do you mean
[1:50:20] you should use them for that i can't
[1:50:22] bring a revival
[1:50:36] did you
[1:50:50] [Music]
[1:51:32] knew that his present backslidden
[1:51:34] condition could not
[1:51:36] produce the strength of the challenges
[1:51:43] and if you don't know that you black
[1:51:46] samson
[1:51:54] the church in its present denominational
[1:51:57] condition
[1:51:59] cannot produce the strength
[1:52:12] men and women wants god on his heart
[1:52:40] you are only putting pulling a paper
[1:52:49] i don't know what a juvenile kid excuse
[1:52:52] me i'm sorry
[1:52:53] and acting like i don't know what if you
[1:52:56] say come
[1:52:56] from
[1:53:24] is
[1:53:36] that's all god required it's just taking
[1:53:51] he's looking for the life of christ
[1:53:54] not because you claim it with your mouth
[1:54:03] amen hallelujah enclosing
[1:54:19] than others
[1:54:34] hallelujah amen come on
[1:54:38] let me say it like this and i said i'm
[1:54:40] closing i mean it will tell me
[1:54:42] i just want to leave leave you with a
[1:54:43] thought some thoughts
[1:54:46] because delilah will make you think
[1:54:48] you're okay
[1:55:03] that's right and you must understand the
[1:55:06] hour we're living
[1:55:12] hallelujah amen is that right this is
[1:55:14] the hour of the confederation
[1:55:43] it determines whether you've got the
[1:55:45] holy ghost
[1:55:48] whether you're elected of god that's
[1:55:49] what happens
[1:55:51] you understand what i'm trying to say
[1:55:54] it's later than we think
[1:55:57] got a lot of people blind hey i think
[1:56:00] no i'm not saying you're not samson i'm
[1:56:02] not saying you're not the church
[1:56:08] but i am saying measure the condition
[1:56:11] that we're in the
[1:56:12] condition
[1:56:23] see that persecution because brother
[1:56:25] brown said we're going to get it
[1:56:34] he said there's a man that i here that
[1:56:37] can turn on the lights
[1:56:38] yeah yeah she ain't nominated don't be
