[23:18] james fifth chapter
[23:25] i'll try my best to take it a little
[23:27] slow to this morning
[23:31] oh the subject is a
[23:33] real serious one um
[23:38] and i trust this be such a blessing to
[23:41] you
[23:43] and it will change your life
[23:48] james the fifth chapter once again
[23:53] and we're going to begin reading at the
[23:56] 16th verse
[23:59] universe
[24:00] the verses
[24:10] everybody there
[24:19] and it reads
[24:21] confess your faults one to another
[24:25] and pray for
[24:27] one another
[24:29] that ye may be healed
[24:32] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[24:34] righteous man
[24:36] availeth much
[24:40] elias was a man subjected like passion
[24:43] as we are
[24:45] and he prayed earnestly
[24:47] that it might not rain and it rained not
[24:50] on the earth by the space of three years
[24:53] and six months
[24:55] and he prayed again
[24:57] and the heaven gave rain
[24:58] and the earth brought forth her fruit
[25:03] universe says
[25:40] amen
[25:42] let us pray for you
[25:44] father god we thank you for your grace
[25:48] thank you for your mercy
[25:52] we thank you for all that you have done
[25:54] for us
[26:20] that you will bless each and every heart
[26:22] should be
[26:29] amen amen you may be seated it was a
[26:32] sword
[26:32] uh as you may uh guess
[26:36] that gift will
[26:50] because everybody here this morning
[26:53] we have our idea of what prayer is
[26:58] [Music]
[27:00] and often times prayer is uh
[27:04] not answered
[27:07] by god
[27:10] because we take the wrong approach
[27:17] prayer is not just asking god
[27:21] even though the bible says
[27:28] seek and he shall find
[27:31] a knock in the door shall be
[27:46] this morning
[27:58] there's a little chili here this morning
[28:00] so
[28:06] you can have a background
[28:08] okay okay
[28:10] i looked and didn't see them but i just
[28:11] didn't look far enough
[28:14] thank
[28:14] you thank you
[28:19] i myself
[28:22] i'm learning prayer i'm learning what it
[28:24] really is
[28:28] and i often wondered why people in the
[28:30] old testament
[28:34] get greater results
[28:38] even though they weren't even taught how
[28:40] to pray
[28:43] but we understand that prayer
[28:46] is always an inspiration
[28:52] it's it's an atmosphere that we must
[28:55] find ourselves
[28:59] the bible tells us the effectual fervent
[29:02] prayer of a righteous man
[29:08] availeth
[29:10] much one of the things that i so desire
[29:16] in a great way
[29:20] and that is to have such a prayer life
[29:23] that it will bring me
[29:25] in the oneness of god
[29:34] we have heard that prayer changes things
[29:38] we
[29:44] [Music]
[29:52] didn't know
[30:06] god would be a pro collector
[30:09] is that right
[30:11] we have an example here's our example
[30:13] john the baptist
[30:16] who never was educated
[30:19] but he knew god in such
[30:28] [Music]
[30:34] when you talk
[30:59] but it brings you into an
[31:02] atmosphere man
[31:04] downs and atmospheres there are times
[31:06] when we pray silently
[31:11] that kind of prayer will put you to
[31:14] sleep
[31:19] because it's difficult to get into
[31:21] prayer
[31:23] silently silence you is more but there
[31:27] are times
[31:29] when your silent prayer takes you to
[31:31] another level
[31:35] you see it's the atmosphere where you
[31:37] said to the atmosphere
[31:39] the dimensions
[31:42] god takes us to
[31:50] [Music]
[32:11] and we're not talking about walking with
[32:14] the bible
[32:16] or some word on on on animal skin
[32:21] [Music]
[32:22] but enoch knew god in the most simple
[32:26] and no calculus
[32:34] and so enoch in the spirit walk with god
[32:38] hello then listen
[32:40] hallelujah amen and you and i have heard
[32:42] many times
[32:45] prayer changes things
[32:49] and sometimes god will allow
[32:52] tragical things to come
[33:06] we should be reaching for a higher plane
[33:35] in james 5 15.
[33:38] jackson
[33:40] the bible says
[33:42] the effectual fervent la pierre
[33:46] he said that's desperation
[33:49] effectual fervent
[33:55] [Music]
[34:00] [Music]
[34:04] oh
[34:09] [Music]
[34:18] uh
[34:30] either which one you want to call it
[34:35] but when our soul
[34:36] gets in desperation
[34:42] in travailing
[34:45] an effectual fervent prayer of a man
[34:48] that can show the token
[34:51] it does something
[34:56] he said notice what the bible says here
[35:15] listen um
[35:16] see having no faults
[35:20] ask people to pray for you accomplish
[35:22] our people confessing our faults
[35:24] unconfessed one to another
[35:26] confession one for another
[35:32] [Music]
[35:48] [Music]
[35:56] [Music]
[36:08] [Music]
[36:10] that
[36:41] [Music]
[36:49] [Music]
[37:07] the prophet of god likened it as the
[37:09] placing of a son
[37:15] in other words you've got to mature
[37:19] hallelujah you've got to
[37:35] obviously they're god's places
[37:41] he's at the pentecostals
[37:43] where they failed see like it's on fire
[37:46] you thought because you were born of the
[37:48] spirit
[37:50] spirit of god
[37:52] the birthright
[37:54] that settled it
[37:56] that settled it
[38:00] but it only starts it
[38:09] [Music]
[38:16] it had right
[38:21] [Music]
[38:28] it did not prove out to be an obedience
[38:34] [Music]
[38:53] and god is watching every move we make
[38:57] is
[39:10] you and i must understand who's your
[39:11] person don't
[39:13] [Music]
[39:36] when the holy ghost fell upon the
[39:38] pentecostal people
[40:21] [Music]
[40:35] act like a child
[40:37] [Music]
[40:45] [Music]
[40:48] and you and i realize amen
[41:01] and you've heard me read the scriptures
[41:32] many times these are four we we want to
[41:34] just get on our knees
[41:37] sometimes not even on our knees
[41:40] and we just want to ask god for things
[41:43] come and say yes
[41:45] god give me yes
[41:50] [Music]
[41:57] that you can come into the king's
[41:59] presence like that
[42:27] acknowledging you're wrong
[42:30] [Music]
[42:41] [Music]
[42:56] it will
[43:10] conversation
[43:25] in order to make a rapture fulfill for
[43:27] my life your prayer life
[43:31] be in line
[43:33] there must be a connection whatever it
[43:36] is
[43:38] hallelujah amen amen because god talks
[43:42] to you basketball prayer
[43:46] he takes you into that atmosphere
[43:49] you can hear him say things
[43:52] no man no
[44:06] and you know
[44:15] [Music]
[44:20] what
[44:50] let me say it again let's see what they
[44:51] did if you pray right
[44:54] now everybody will have to pray for you
[44:56] whenever
[44:57] you can follow the holy ghost
[44:59] you say where do you get that from
[45:02] the bible says on the day of pentecost
[45:08] individuals praying for themselves
[45:13] there was no laying of the hands
[45:16] of them
[45:25] [Music]
[45:28] when you call on the name of jesus
[45:46] for mom we need to know
[45:48] that once i've come up here

[58:05] [Music]
[58:23] [Music]
[58:33] [Music]
[58:46] i've heard this before but i just heard
[58:48] it
[59:16] and he says you know we as christians we
[59:19] we think we're okay
[59:28] but you see that's not
[59:30] the end of our journey
[59:33] and of our journey is to go beyond the
[59:35] vehicle

[1:01:19] christian
[1:01:34] they don't hear the things of the world
[1:01:50] god never come for just any haphazard
[1:01:53] way
[1:01:57] listen he said prayer is not a perhaps
[1:02:01] in the past
[1:02:02] it's a sincere thing
[1:02:04] is
[1:02:09] [Music]
[1:02:17] uh
[1:02:22] [Music]

[1:04:33] those things are fine
[1:04:35] i have nothing to say against them
[1:04:38] of god
[1:04:51] oh i mean interpretation of tongues it's
[1:04:54] the same
[1:04:55] thing but all these other things
[1:04:59] prophecies they're all of these things
[1:05:03] but they're no good
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:34] because you go
[1:05:48] to know the will of god
[1:05:51] important the connection is that right
[1:05:53] she said it is an abiding presence to
[1:05:56] know the will of god
[1:06:02] then you don't look
[1:06:04] what the world is going to say about you
[1:06:07] it's what god said
[1:06:10] then you're living in his presence i
[1:06:12] love with vader's presence hallelujah i
[1:06:14] know there's a lot of reading just like

[1:07:01] [Music]
[1:07:12] [Music]
[1:07:38] because we haven't kept up our end
[1:07:42] we haven't kept up our end
[1:07:45] of the bargain if you want to say it
[1:07:46] like that
[1:07:52] if you do what you're supposed to do
[1:07:54] second
[1:08:00] you see guarding you know it's like this
[1:08:03] i don't i don't get jealous of the

[1:12:09] not waiting for the atmosphere to change
[1:12:13] the atmosphere
[1:12:15] and you know the devil makes sure the
[1:12:17] atmosphere doesn't change
[1:12:47] is that

[1:14:48] prayers and man
[1:14:50] five minutes

[1:18:37] something happen
[1:18:45] [Music]
[1:18:52] no
[1:19:06] use
[1:19:11] i see one person shaking their head
[1:19:17] why do you think everything you've been
[1:19:19] bombarded with all kinds of the thought
[1:19:21] because
[1:19:23] the devil don't want you to pray
[1:19:32] this is why satan fights you
[1:19:48] you did
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:20:14] quiet
[1:20:44] we
[1:20:45] [Music]
[1:20:53] [Music]

[1:21:06] right and you keep knocking on that dog
[1:21:09] will continue
[1:21:10] it's going to be open el salvador
[1:21:18] and i believe that's all over the world
[1:21:20] we just the devil has played so many
[1:21:23] things
[1:21:26] things of distraction the shows pull up
[1:21:30] from praying they don't got their lungs
[1:21:32] that appear
[1:21:34] this may not sound like it's worth much
[1:21:35] but i'll tell you what the sun fires

[1:22:10] [Music]
[1:22:27] and know that the great omnipotent god

[1:22:50] unbelievers
[1:23:04] foreign
[1:23:07] see what the devil has been stealing
[1:23:09] from us

[1:23:15] are reading their bible
[1:23:32] god
[1:23:34] and then you take his word
[1:23:37] bring it back to him
