and then sneezing but um we just thank praise God for his mercy and his grace thank God for your love and your prayers and we just appreciate God for everything love Lord go right into the scripture we'll be coming from Revelations the 19 and from there we'll have you turn to Matthew 25 Revelations 19 beginning at the seventh verse and it reads let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his bride ha made herself ready to her was granted that she should be ar raay in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righte of the Saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true says of God and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus who worship God who worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit all right let us turn to Matthew 25 please famili scripture I'm sure all of us know then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened to 10 virgins which took St lamps and went for to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took all in their vessels with their while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arosed and trim their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the but the wise answer saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourself and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut let us pray our heavenly father we thank you for your goodness and your grace thank you for the we thank you for the word of God we pray father that you would bless the service morning anoint your servant anoint your word anoint the hearts of the people that they would receive the word Lord father I pray that 100 F would will will blossom in the hearts of the people this morning Grant Lord in your name Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated my subject this morning is why she missed it and I'm working with the Rapture you see often times we think that because we claim to be in the message that we automatically will be raptured but the Rapture comes for those who love disappearing those and it is for those amen who make themselves ready see as brother bandam said there must be something you must do yourself coming from the marriage of the Lamb paragraph 54 the prophet of God says so many say if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling or from lying or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you see you've got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she has made herself ready he say I like that you see God could not push you up through a little pipe and pull us out on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcome it you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decision for myself I'm doing that we show our faith and respect to God Abraham was a promised child but he must maintain the promise for 25 years hallelujah amen amen amen the ups and the Downs that he had and Temptations in those 25 years but he held to the word of the promise Hallelujah and remember God gave a promise to Israel he told Israel you shall possess the land but as the prophet of God says Israel had to fight for the land it was given to her but she had to fight inch by inch that was promised to her Hallelujah and even though the Rapture is promised to us we have to fight for every inur we have to lay aside every wait that so easily beset us we must fight if we must Reign hallelujah we're not in a place of um vacation but we are on a Warfield and I don't know about you but everybody is having some great great battle I don't know a family that is exempt from fights or exemp from the world if you are a Christian you have a constant battle going on in your life you have a battle of those things that are without and you have a battle of those things that are within Hallelujah but we must fight if we if we should Reign hallelujah amen why did she miss it coming from the marriage of the Lamb Hallelujah paragraph 86 brother Adam says that's the same thing when you come to Christ you see we made promises that many of us have not kept Lord if you would receive me in your kingdom this is how we I promise there you are I'll love you I'll be true to you serve you day and night it's too bad we forget that I'll serve you day and night I'll fast I'll pray I'll be loyal to you I'll bring my tithing unto the house I'll pray many times a day I'll do anything and I pledge all my love to you that's what you should do that's exactly right where you promised that and it should come from your heart how many we said that Lord if you save me I'll do what you whatever you want me to do if you promise your husband that and not from your heart you you are absolutely not living correctly with him hallelujah amen he said it's a kind of a crystallized Affair go listen to that message brother brandham says if you made vows like that and you didn't love that person God doesn't even recognize you as being joined together hallelu it must be a love affair as it is in the natural it must also be in the spiritual hallelujah amen you're not even a Christian if you don't love God hello somebody amen yes sir and in order to love God you got to love his word you got to be obedient to his word hallelujah amen and if you don't if you're not if you're just obedient because of fear Hallelujah you're not a Christian yet Hallelujah because obedience come because you love him he said if you me you will keep my Commandments Hallelujah reason the reason why the foolish didn't make it because they didn't love him enough they they didn't have enough oil in their lamps Hallelujah he said if you promise your husband that and not from your heart you me he said you are absolutely not living correctly ly with him hallelujah amen he said all it is is that you're ra raising his children children The Eyes Of God you're not am Hallelujah am a lot of people in the in the message got roommates hey the roommate hallelujah hallelujah amen and you can't expect to have a true relationship with God if you can't have a true relationship with your husband or your wife why they miss the Rapture why here's one another from question and answer number one 1964 paragraph 151 now then at the time see the Gentile bride is in heaven and sleeping virgins the Gentile virgins is not to be saved during that time she's already been saved but has been rejected in the bride hallelujah amen she only goes through the tribulation period for the time of purification because she has rejected Christ the word for her purification hallelujah amen because she had rejected Christ the word for her purification hallelujah amen then she has to suffer for her Deeds but the pride who has become the word a complete atonement was made of Christ a complete atonement was because he is the word the body was red or torn when that body was torn the bride was in that body because it's all the word amen he said you see it Hallelujah I'm going read another one coming from Revelation chapter 4 part two paragraph 186 he said look at the sleeping virgin oh what did she do she had to sell something in order to buy her oil what did she have to sell her old Creeds and denominational things she sold out all she had in order to find Christ Christ that great Jewel now listen to this now he said the foolish virgin had to sell her C her denomination and I'm going to jump in there and says she had to sell out even on her Traditions that did not measure up to the word he said things so I can put something in that Hallelujah see what we fail to see is that the word is already finished hallelujah amen and there is no new thing under the sun hallelujah what we're now seeing and living has already been Hallelujah there is no new sin Hallelujah because brother Bram explained it sin is unbelief hallelujah amen it's not smoking it's not drinking it's none of these things sin is unbelief and we do these things because we disbel hallelujah oh it's the truth I can't give you faith and I can't make you believe Hallelujah but I do pray that one day you will see and one day you will have faith let me say it like this how can you have faith to make a Rapture when you can't have faith give up high your shoes if you're dress too long take it to the cleaners and get it h again if dress is too long take it to the cleaners and get it [Music] him that's just an excuse my dress is so long so I have to wait so I won't be y'all think I don't know what you're thinking Lord have mercy what was the error of vas where did she go wrong and we've heard this message and you either are NE you are either a an or you are a vast that's where you fit in the word you are either an Esther or you are a vasty hallelujah amen coming from The Book of Esther first chapter 9 to the 13th verse you love the Lord also vasy the queen reading the ninth verse Made A Feast for the women in the Royal house which belonged to King aus on the seventh day when the heart of the King was married with wine he he commanded mum b habon b z andus the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of of asuras the king to bring vasy the queen before the king with the Crown Royal Hallelujah you see where she was to show the people and the princes of her beauty for she was very she was fair to look on but a lot of people like vast as dominal P because the Pentecostals they had the gifts they had healing they had Miracles I mean so many things was wonderful about her she literally reflected the beauty wanted her to reflect but she failed to come to the king's call hallah and let me tell you something that it is a way it is this way it is this way with us because we must respond Hallelujah to the king's call y'all hear what I'm saying if we stay in the condition of lay see we will miss the [Music] Rapture on the 12th verse it said but the queen vasti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very rought and his anger burned in him then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment understand was under the law and judgment Hall yes sir and that's where it places you if you don't move into Christ you will be faced with law and judgment Hallelujah see your time is now you say I am the bride Hallelujah and Esther represented the bride for this day Hallelujah and your time is now to show the beauty of the bride Church Hallelujah is that right correct let's read on let's drop down to the 19th verse the the same chapter chapter one you there I'm just going to read the whole paragraph and then I'll let you go if it please the king Let There Go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the law laws of the Persians and the means that it be not altered that vast come no more before King hura and let the King give her Royal Estate unto another that is better than she so just want you to realize yeah I'll read the TW I got more verses I just want okay a broken see what happened she failed to come into the king's Presence at his command my question this morning to you who is the king and what is his presence hallelujah amen see it's more than just the Holy Ghost on your spirit more than just the Holy Ghost Amen on your flesh must be the holy ghost in the king's chamber hallelujah amen see when the king refused uh vas hallelujah amen it it was a broken prayer life it broke the relationship hallelujah amen and that relationship was so broken it was never to be mened Hallelujah is that right amen so we find out that she she she she she didn't understand what her Rebellion rebellious Spirit bringing her into Hallelujah stubbornness thaty had she had no idea what was waiting her next but we have scripture that tells us what happens every individual who refuse to answer the king's call hallelujah amen see and when the king the 20th verse and when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his Empire for it is great all the wives shall give to their husband honor but both to Great and Small Hallelujah y understand this and our sisters we must give honor to our husbands hallelujah amen because that is a reflection of the word hallelujah amen now because of this decree we know that that the king got Victory hallelujah amen now his letter went out his letter went out throughout the king's Prophet that every man should bear rule in his own house St there bear bearing rule in your house not make you a wicked Taskmaster Hallelujah it just means when it comes to the final decisions in your in your household making your business the man has the last word hallelujah amen glory to God right amen so you must understand in that that natural sense so is it in the spiritual sense we must reverence our Lord we must our Lord hallelujah we must love our Lord with all of our heart all of our mind with all of our soul Hallelujah and our sisters must work toward being a Sarah who call Abraham Lord hallelujah and you and I spiritually must work toward that to call Jesus Christ Our Lord y understand what I'm saying he's not just my savior he he's not just my husband he is my Lord he is the ruler Hallelujah and if is not your lord you will miss the Rapture the word must have preeminence hallelujah amen so you understand even brother brandham said that we have vessels of honor and vessels of Dishonor and he got that out of the book of Romans in Romans the nth chapter beginning at the 21th verse and it it reads have not the PO power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another dishonor hallelujah amen what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endure with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that's what happens to people that's what happen to Christians Satan deceives you because you do wrong and you think you get away with it that's that's not good I want chastisement I want God to chasen me I want God to correct me I don't want to get away with sin when I do wrong I want God to make it make me see I've done wrong because if you are doing wrong and God does not correct you you're leaning toward the vessel of a dishonor you better hear what I'm saying hallelujah am and the thing about this whole situ everything done in the dark will be brought to the light hallelujah amen what if God willing uh let's move on and and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy I don't know about you but that's where I'm at which he have afford PR prepared unto Glory hallelujah amen amen so you got to understand there's a a vessel of mercy and there's a vessel of Destruction Hallelujah and those of you who are living destructive lives understand you are under the inspiration of the world because the world right now is under the inspiration of Destruction Hallelujah that's what the Bible says Satan comes to steal kill and destroy hallelujah amen why do you think these politicians are doing the things they are doing they are under the anointing of this age the anointing of this age is the destroy hallelujah amen as it was in the days of no as it was in the days of s so is it in this day Hallelujah let me say it like this if you are married and you can't worship or uplift your husband the Bible said a wise woman builds her house Hallelujah if you are a true wife you do not say words you do not say words that will destroy your husband Hallelujah vice versa if you are married you do not curse your wife you don't call her stupid and things like that that Hallelujah but you must uplift her Hallelujah you must look at your wife as Christ live uh look looked at his wife Hallelujah and he looked at us through the blood yes sir amen hallelujah amen see see we fail to see reflection you see everything has a reflection a shadow shadow but whatever I'm doing is what my shadow is doing Hallelujah my shadow can't move on his own glory to God and if the Old Testament is the shadow of the New Testament hallelujah amen what we saw vas do it was because of us she was able to do what she did y'all hear what I'm saying they're just a shadow we are the real thing Hallelujah glory to God so you say what do you mean brother Brook let me say this and I heard another brother say it and I thought that's good he said if you don't pay your tithe and offering he said you're not a part of Abraham hallelujah amen cuz Abraham paid his TI because of Abraham Levi was the shadow was the shadow if I had to pay tie in Abraham Hallelujah you God you will pay amen hallelujah amen so where do you stand hallelujah amen I'm just saying I thought that was pretty good so many people have battles with that if you don't that you will miss the rapure without spot wrinkle or blemish y hear what I'm saying was word made manifest hallelujah amen even us coming from the scripture now Romans Romans Hallelujah let's get begin at the 23rd verse and that he might be known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had prepared unto Glory even us whom he ha called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles as he said also in OC I will call them my people which were not my people and her and her beloved which was not my beloved Hallelujah and it shall come to pass that in that place where it was said unto them he are not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God what is it the mercies of God Isaiah also cried con concerning Israel though the number of the children of Israel as the sand of the sea a Remnant shall be sa hallelujah amen for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the word Earth Hallelujah listen what he says I want to show you the the the mercy and the grace of God the Bible says in that 29th verse and as Isaiah said before except the Lord of Sabbath has left us a seed we had been as Sodom and and been made like unto Gamora Hallelujah so know the mercies of God know the mercies of God the reason why you are who you are the reason why you're not a sodomite the reason why you're not from gomor Hallelujah is because God left to see Hallelujah every sin that the world does we would have been just as guilty of doing those things but because of the representation but because of the seed that's in you that was the mercies of God that has kept you are the mercies of God that have saved you hallelujah it's the mercies of God that have given you the Holy Ghost it's the mercies of God who has he's changed you am why because in his mind he saw you as a vessel of Honor hallelujah amen see one thing about Esther she was committed to God hallelujah is that the word Absolut coming from Marriage of the Lamb 145 he said he's going to have a bride that hasn't A Wrinkle in her amen she's holy Washed by the blood of his own that's right so we see where we stand the wedding get getting ready come now if we find out she's committed spiritual fornications going out with the world professing something like living living something different that won't never work what the church ought to do is do like Esther dider refused the adorning of the world Hallelujah you say well what are you saying brother BR I'm trying to tell you why many people will miss the Rapture even in this message I don't know how otherwise say that follows this message or claim to follow this message Hall exposition of the seven Church ages just bear with me the prophet God says here is now set forth the love of God he desires in a love a family of his own a family of sons Sons like himself there before him lies all kinds as one lump of clay out of that same lamp he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor did y'all hear that Hallelujah the choosing will be his own choosing then those ch Chen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chasing with nail scarred hands understand what he's saying is his is his love that chastens us it reproves mes us and all along he's handling us like he knows the pain we feel sometime the Potter must take the vessel he is working on and and thoroughly break it down in order that he might rebuild it exactly as he desired Hallelujah but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be he says oh little flock do not fear this is the fast closing age as it does those tears to be bound together and as a three4 card is not easily [Music] broken they will have a tremendous threefold strength a political physical and spiritual satanical power and they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ she will suffer she will suffer but she will endure fear not those things that are coming upon the Earth for he who loved his own love them until the end hallelujah amen oh what are you saying Brother Bruce if you don't have the oil when that squeeze come you're going to Real realiz you don't have enough to maintain the hour Hallelujah and while you trying to pray through the pride is already prayed through because she has made herself ready Hallelujah Envy envy and strife jealousies all of these things is of the world and the pride has no right the pride has no right to allow herself to be adorned with these devilish Spirits Hallelujah right now you need to be somewhere praying that God will seal you bring you to the Statue of a perfect man Hallelujah complete you we need to be completed that's why he came in 1963 Hallelujah he came to kept the bride hallelujah amen what are we doing if we're not careful be like vasty Hallelujah she thought she was so beautiful she all into herself adoring herself in in in certain ways she had such Pride Hallelujah that when the king called she was not willing to go that was a fatal mistake she forgot that everything she owned was given to her by the king Hallelujah let me say this to you sister if you're beautiful you didn't make yourself beautiful God gave you that if you're rich you didn't make yourself rich God gave you that if you got a good job you didn't give yourself that job gave you that job what goes for the Sisters also go for the brother everything you have God gave it to you so don't get so proud with yourself that you can't get down and pray Hallelujah don't get so prideful in [Applause] your that you can't fast before the Lord don't get so proud in yourself that you forget who brought you here the same God that brought you here is the same God that's going to take you you're going to have to meet him one day you will meet him as an eser or you will meet him as a vast hallelujah amen that's the truth hallelujah amen hey let me say it brother brand called The Bride Lady Grace and if you don't know what Grace is you can't give Grace hallelujah oh if anybody going to have grace and mercy it's going to be the Bride of Jesus christall hallelujah amen just want to read this this is just a sweet clothing almost I'm almost there I wrote it down and I just had it typed in or whatever you know how we do it but but brother Bram is talking about brother Bosworth Hallelujah and this is this is the marriage of the lamb as well starting at the 12th verse and he said he said uh and I said brother Bosworth one more thing I would like to ask you he said what is it brother brandom I said now you put in about 60 years for the Lord in service or maybe more and I said what when was your happiest time in life he said right now I want I want all y'all to listen to what I'm saying because all of us come come to this if we don't make the Rapture first death is going to knock on your door and tell you something if You' never been close to death you'll never understand but I've come close to death more than once and my my life flashes before me everything look like in a split second Hallelujah I see the good and the bad everything flashes Hallelujah it won't be that you're going to forget what you done hallelujah if you're not covered by the blood all your sins that you have hidden will be exposed in that day hallelujah amen we'll see the video that God has recorded of you and there you won't be able to point to nobody
