humbling to you to tell you how worthy you are you deserve our worship you deserve our worship prise you deserve all that we are nothing that we are can be read as a something we deserve for our not even our strength to be what who we are but all we are right now Lord it's a gift from you Lord you who has good things to give us you gave us the Breath of Life this morning because your word has said that a man is not a master of his own breath our breath come from you why this morning Lord you want to recognize that all that we are it's by Your Grace it's your mercy It's Your Love why we want to Worship You may your presence be real May your children be transformed by the word that going and that your spirit heal sickness and deliver captivity and bring back backslide bring blessing to your children much I look for your face in I don't know what you're going to do I'm just myself I want you to see a a touch so when we leave out of so we may remember that we came to your presence thank you our father thank you all Eternal thanks for everything as we pray bless the word that we in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I will ask you to [Music] se uh as of this morning I would like to speak about a question and the title of my sermon is tell me how you know my brothers and sisters sometimes God don't give us explanation for what he's going to do he doesn't tell us this or that how it's going to do that thing why God doesn't do it because God is waiting for us to to believe in his word that's why God surpris us sometimes by events he don't tell us what's going to happen he don't tell us what's how is going to happen but all we see we surprised in the events in the of the event and when we see the things happening and that shows the sity because the Bible [Music] say that God do everything according to his own [Music] Pur everything he does he does it according to his own will so I would like my brothers and sister sometimes we have people among us who wants to understand what God do and how he does it and sometimes we we miss we lost the quality of believer because we will start thinking and reasoning how come God can do how could he do such thing in God's domain we don't culate God calls us believer he don't say that we are thinkers he calls us Believers when someone believes he doesn't wants to understand how not wondering that's God's domain it's God's work himself that God is asking us to do is to believe in his own word that's why he calls us Believers he's calling us Believers we supposed to believe in his word and a Believer is not just but it's an attitude do you know that we have preachers today who fighting because of believers one says he he took my believer because believer Believers has lost a true they just became member of church that's why preachers can fight for them but I'm saying this attitude a belief has to beud that each person has to be to have in front of God in front of the word feel I'm losing my mic if you can fix it now listen and what we call today Believers and those who the preachers can even fight for many has become thinkers they think people who reason up according to the word of God God is not waiting for us to reason but what did Mary do Mary just believed when the angel told her that she's going to conceive her one question [Music] Mary how is this going to be happened because I do not know a man and the angel told the Holy Ghost will come unto you and the holy power will cover you and Mary just believe he said Let It Be according to your word my and my brothers and sisters I want to tell you this morning that God we cannot understand you don't understand God you only believe I don't know why God would do this I just surrended myself I looked up on his face and I don't know what he's going to do I want to tell you this morning that if you have a question to ask I don't have an answer I Will Show You Through the Bible through the message show you cases that [Music] happen which we couldn't have answer during that time someone could ask a question there wouldn't get an answer today now tell me how now how how Mary without a man was it possible with our man wisd impossible but now tell me how did she conceive we don't have answer to our wisdom yes brothers and sisters you don't understand God you reasoning to God but you just believe God yes my brothers and sisters we have people who preach always want to understand God's things I would like to ask you a question and you're going to tell me tell me how how the words of Jero fa because the Bible say was surrender seven times and tell me how did that happen brother tell me how this morning fell down went down on the river seven time and he was healed from his tell me how that was happen and tell me just by a stick by sck Moses separated tell me how was it possible brothers and because you want to understand you don't understand you just believe your only tell me how want to spend three days in a whales tell me how he he he he survived tell me how he survived you don't reason tell me how Lions couldn't tell me how that's possible can you explain me with your how this things happen I know I believe that we we this morning

caring you but the devil everything that he God already took it away from he a't got no more power on you he only there to scare you but he's got no power let let me me so we can go to prayer let's see what the prophet say he amen why would I wonder he said one day a brother had it was brother William who became a pastor of a church miltown church Prophet said says few years later a few years ago he was healed from where the the the doctor said the best that they had in that time that you could find around the town those from they told him that he's going to die and the prophet said he came here and wife called me says brought would you want to come and pray he's dying from cancer and we went to he had cancer he became he became yellow he was almost unconscious he he was in and I asked him she called my friend who a doctor to talk to him it was doctor and the prophecy many of you know him know I went where the clinic is because the prophecy said you will build this Clinic with bricks when was there and he was wondering how was he going to get that but the proc the process took in the Boston tribal because it was a lane that was in Conflict came told I have a problem I want to build hospital I want to build a CL for God's children's I don't know how to get the process has last for 25 years nobody would touch that because it's a conflict Propet told him I told him go away and I told him and I took a phone and then less than 24 hours I told Sam I told you will have that land he says bill you know that you my friend I always you some other when it comes to this I doubt I doubt the prophet said I told him go and he went L than 24 hours came and called brother he told him B I'm excited for what I'm about to tell you he says the pro the process was reviewed they say that I Reed less than 24 hours said the prophecy said you will have that place build the hospital with a red bricks and I personally went to that place and here brother he went to see tell about William one thing to do is to call to a specialist of cancer let me tell story since we have TT and then they sent him to [Music] lville and they they examin him the doctor says that his cancer was on stage four and he didn't tell Sam what it was about tell him what the doctor said and then called the doctor and the doctor told this man William will die that's why I didn't want to tell him that he's going to die in four days only have four days to leave he has uh F uh cancel the ru his liver some came to brother say he told him said anything else you can do for him he said weever can we just there's no way because it's the liver that has and I think that if we he cannot live without with he says if PR he should have been ready to go to die and I said and I believe he's ready always been ready because he's a preacher it was hard to tell it to his wonderful wife that in four days going to die going to die took he says let me he went away to pray for his but the morning when he he had a [Music] vision he didn't know that it was a vision and he took his he took his hat he says I'm going to Kent to uh in the morning before he was 7 a.m. in the morning he looked in the yard he sees like a apple and he said and he says he it like five apples here and then he saws a big red apple with like scars on it and then he eating those consume all other apples when I saw those apples I didn't

live that's all I know and the prophet said he's alive today godain where we don't wonder want to understand everything you won't understand at a c Point brothers and sisters because I saw this happen telling this stor with the prophet of God because I believe from all my heart that the same God that was with with the people of the prophet and I want the same God that that did do it with you let him do it with me let it do it with anybody else who has a problem I don't know your situation I don't know your ability I [Music] know who can go beyond your but what I know I trust God everything is possible to everything is possible to youth this morning brother and [Music] sisters Mary she only she just is going to be while I don't not know aen my brothers and sister God had made a law of contrast and I saw God many times working with the law of contrast Mary asked question because to have in order to in a normal way to be a man and a woman be together but when they ask the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will cover and the power the holy will make you have that children that baby and said Let It Be according to your word God made the the law of contr I saw God many times making when his people was one was gone and God has acted with the law of a normal process will say that you have to plant a Vine water with water make grapes and then we make juice but God didn't wait for God went around I believe that the same guy any situation God is more than prophet of God said it says God can do everything he's unable to do one thing one thing that God is unable to I want to inform you God is unable to he says he can do anything the only God is unable to is to fail God can never fail the one who holds his word and his word is eternal my brothers and sisters I believe all my heart this morning I believe with everything in me that God can grant yougest desire of your heart you believe you only believe nothing can be impossible he asked AB Sarah that can be uh difficult to from God to God nothing can be difficult everything is possible to him coming here this morning I reading in the Bible in sisters divines Bible he said that Faith don't make things easy but he makes them possible Faith don't make things easy is not a domain of facility but it makes them possible where it's possible Faith makes it possible where people say Faith makes it possible and sisters don't make them easy for you it makes them possible for you let's he what the prophecy the message where he say William William Bram preached listen to that he that that William he says in paragraph 5 she had to believe to The Impossible says that's what she supposed to do how to be to the to receive a new life allow me to do this as God servant because I know what I'm talking about he say The Impossible

given to us to work and it's the fath God doesn't pay he doesn't pay people he pay Faith he pays faith and that's why any time that any person could touch tou the Lord without a scripture you you have to know that not that we will have scripture to justify but that woman she had Revelation that if I could touch His Garment are we are we are we be healed when the Lord saw that she he said he said
