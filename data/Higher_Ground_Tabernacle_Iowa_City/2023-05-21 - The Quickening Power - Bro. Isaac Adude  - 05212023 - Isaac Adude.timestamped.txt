[54:40] [Music]
[54:46] [Music]
[54:52] amen amen Lord Jesus Christ
[54:59] amen we're so happy to be here this
[55:01] morning with you
[55:03] amen we agree that it's been a long time
[55:09] amen but uh
[55:12] just pray the Lord that will enjoyed
[55:14] this you know time that we'll spend
[55:16] together
[55:20] amen without taking too much time let's
[55:22] go straight to the word
[55:26] let's open our Bibles in the Book of
[55:29] Romans chapter 8 read the verse 9 to
[55:32] verse 11.
[55:34] foreign
[55:40] Romans chapter 8 verse 9 to verse 11.
[55:51] or uh we can start at verse
[55:56] verse 5 to verse 11.
[56:01] Romans chapter 8 verse 5 to verse 11.
[56:04] and then the Bible says for they that
[56:07] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[56:10] of the flesh by day that after a spirit
[56:13] the things are data the things of the
[56:17] spirit
[56:20] s
[56:26] alone
[56:29] for to be carnally minded is death
[56:33] but to be spiritual minded spiritually
[56:36] minded is life and peace
[56:43] verse 7 because the carnal mind is in
[56:48] enmity against God for it is not subject
[56:52] to the law of God neither indeed can be
[56:55] foreign
[57:08] so then they that are in the flesh
[57:11] cannot please God
[57:14] Allah
[57:17] because we know the Bible says that the
[57:20] only way you can worship God is in
[57:21] spirit and Truth
[57:27] amen verse 9 the Bible continues and say
[57:30] that but ye are not in the flesh but in
[57:34] the spirit if so be that the spirit of
[57:37] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[57:41] the spirit of Christ he is none of his
[57:43] verses
[57:44] [Music]
[57:57] verse 10 and if Christ be in you the
[58:01] body is dead because of sin but the
[58:03] spirit is life because of righteousness
[58:09] 11
[58:11] s
[58:15] amen verse 11 but if the spirit of him
[58:19] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[58:21] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[58:24] dead shall also Quicken your moral
[58:26] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[58:29] you
[58:30] that's the answer is
[58:38] [Music]
[58:44] again verse 11 the Bible says that but
[58:47] if the spirit of him that raised up
[58:49] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[58:52] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[58:54] also Quicken your moral bodies by his
[58:56] spirit that dwelleth in you is
[59:10] amen let's go to uh John chapter 14.
[59:17] we read the verse 13 to verse 20.
[59:38] John Chapter 14 verse 13 to verse 20.
[59:49] even the Bible says that and whatsoever
[59:52] you shall ask in my name that will I do
[59:55] that the father be glorified in the son
[1:00:00] foreign
[1:00:09] if you ask anything in my name I will do
[1:00:12] it
[1:00:16] if you love me keep my Commandments
[1:00:21] and I will pray the father and he shall
[1:00:25] give you another comforter that he may
[1:00:27] abide with you forever
[1:00:36] even the spirit of Truth whom the word
[1:00:39] cannot receive because he seeth him not
[1:00:41] neither nor with him but he know him for
[1:00:45] he Duality with you and shall be in you
[1:00:47] versed he said let's pray everyday
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:01:00] amen Verse 18 I will not leave you
[1:01:04] comfortless I will come to you
[1:01:09] a little while
[1:01:11] and the world seeth me no more by ye see
[1:01:15] me because I live and you shall live
[1:01:17] also
[1:01:19] please
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:38] verse 21 he that has my commandment
[1:01:42] and keep with them it is that love with
[1:01:45] me and he that love with me shall be
[1:01:48] loved by my father and I will love him
[1:01:51] and I will manifest myself
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:16] amen so what is that spirit
[1:04:51] when the word cannot receive
[1:04:55] members
[1:04:57] so then he jumped again into verse 20 he
[1:05:01] says that and at that day you shall know
[1:05:03] me
[1:05:04] and you shall know
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:16] amen so if you read the verse this
[1:05:19] chapter 14 of John
[1:05:22] amen it looks like there is three people
[1:05:25] here Jesus is talking about two other
[1:05:27] people circumcision
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:41] we don't believe
[1:05:43] foreign
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:06:03] [Music]
[1:06:05] in the Old Testament
[1:06:08] images

[1:06:44] dwelled with us a set share

[1:13:02] amen amen so the entire Christian
[1:13:10] the entire Christianity is based on
[1:13:13] Resurrection Christianity
[1:13:16] amen we see in the Old Testament
[1:13:19] amen the resurrection happened
[1:13:23] amen we see it in the life of Jesus
[1:13:25] after his death now foreign
[1:14:05] say that well let me build this wall and
[1:14:07] then the grass will not come soon
[1:14:17] you won't be able to keep their life
[1:14:23] I mean it doesn't matter how many days
[1:14:25] you've been uh how many years you've
[1:14:28] been spending a tune

[1:15:31] amen his body was the word
[1:15:34] amen but he needed to have the dynamic
[1:15:38] amen that's why John said that I saw the
[1:15:41] spirit of God coming down
[1:15:46] that perfect combination
[1:15:49] amen of the mechanic and the Dynamics
[1:15:54] because the spirit

[1:33:24] in the Old Testament amen God was with
[1:33:28] them amen but we have the promise
[1:33:31] that God is Not only with us

[1:37:16] what are people saying about us
[1:37:20] amen you see what brother Isaac I don't
[1:37:22] have faith
[1:37:24] I don't know how to believe
[1:37:27] why I see I'll read this word but I just
[1:37:30] don't know how to believe
[1:37:33] amen here's the answer of the Prophet
[1:37:35] for us the prophet he says that faith is
[1:37:39] not that loose
[1:37:43] I think
[1:37:47] it's got to be based upon some noted
[1:37:50] facts
[1:37:54] you've got to know something about what
[1:37:57] you are having faith in
[1:38:02] because the prophet says before having
[1:38:05] the Holy Spirit
[1:38:08] you need to know three things
[1:38:11] what is the holy spirit
[1:38:13] when it comes in you what does it mean
[1:38:17] and the other one I can't remember right
[1:38:19] now but if I have it I'll tell you uh
[1:38:24] amen he says that before you can have
[1:38:27] faith uh uh so we first must know how
[1:38:31] and what uh
[1:38:37] what God what God's desire is
[1:38:43] what God's plan is
[1:38:47] I regular shoes and how to approach God
[1:38:50] by that plane
[1:38:53] and then we can walk out boldly to the
[1:38:57] throne of grace
[1:39:00] and prayed what the plan is promised us
[1:39:07] if you apply that
[1:39:10] you will see the result
[1:39:13] amen you've got to know something
[1:39:17] amen you've got to know
[1:39:19] amen what your what what are the noted
[1:39:22] facts
[1:39:29] amen you will walk broadly to the throne
[1:39:32] of us
[1:39:35] so what is the Holy Ghost
[1:39:38] what is
[1:39:42] amen the Holy Ghost
[1:39:44] is Jesus Christ himself
[1:39:49] Amen in different forms
[1:39:53] amen because in the beginning was the
[1:39:55] logos
[1:39:58] amen for God to create he had to
[1:40:00] condense himself into a foreign
[1:40:33] into different tongues of fire
[1:40:36] and different Amen in other words he
[1:40:40] divided himself into different pillar of
[1:40:42] fires
[1:40:45] amen which means that he went back to
[1:40:48] that original form foreign
[1:41:41] after the flesh went back to the pillow
[1:41:43] fire
[1:41:47] but he promised he will come again and
[1:41:49] dwell amongst
[1:41:53] and on the day of Pentecost
[1:41:57] that pill of fire come down
[1:42:01] separated itself in tongues of fire
[1:42:05] upon each one of them
[1:42:09] what was God doing
[1:42:12] amen prophecy that God was separating
[1:42:15] himself into the church
[1:42:21] amen giving all those men and women a
[1:42:24] part of himself
[1:42:28] he divided himself amongst the church
[1:42:34] just says he said he would call me amen
[1:42:37] the Holy Spirit none other than the part
[1:42:39] of the Lord
[1:43:12] when God became into a form to where it
[1:43:15] could be seen God you have a pillar
[1:43:17] foreign
[1:43:41] could not bear scene
[1:43:43] there had to be a blood offering right
[1:43:46] in here
[1:43:48] then that logos became flesh
[1:43:51] and dwelt Among Us
[1:43:54] and where this Lagos dwelt in the human
[1:43:57] body
[1:44:01] which was the sacrifice
[1:44:03] now when man was made in the image of
[1:44:06] God
[1:44:09] and God came down in the image of men
[1:44:16] to redeem man
[1:44:18] that brought men and God together
[1:44:22] human heavens and earth hugs and kisses
[1:44:27] God and Men Embrace each other
[1:44:31] as a fatherhood and sonship
[1:44:37] amen when the logos become flesh oh
[1:46:02] blood of God you know some amen so he
[1:46:05] promised that same power
[1:46:08] amen that same power is the same power

[1:55:52] Paul didn't say Paul did not say that
[1:55:55] that spirit will dwell with you Paul
[1:55:57] napadike said
[1:55:59] that Spirit dwellers
[1:56:04] amen you have to have Christ walking
[1:56:07] inside
[1:56:09] amen you and God have to merge Allah
[1:56:18] becoming one body
[1:56:21] that's why I said because I live
[1:56:24] you shall live also how are you gonna
[1:56:28] leave foreign
[1:57:20] verse verse 1 to verse 4.
[1:57:30] how can I have that spirit
[1:57:34] Amen to have the same power that Jesus
[1:57:37] had
[1:57:38] meant to have the same spirit that Jesus
[1:57:41] said
[1:57:43] I mean how can I have it
[1:57:48] here the Bible says in Acts chapter 2
[1:57:51] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:57:54] come
[1:57:56] they were all with one Accord in one
[1:57:58] place
[1:58:00] in chapter one uh chapter 2 verse 1.
[1:58:05] that's chapter two versions
[1:58:11] and suddenly there came a sound of
[1:58:14] Heaven from Heaven as a Russian Mighty
[1:58:17] Wind and it filled all the house where
[1:58:20] they were sitting
[1:58:22] is
[1:58:28] and they appeared unto them cloven
[1:58:31] tongues like heads of Fire
[1:58:33] and he said upon each of them the long
[1:58:37] some lovely uh
[1:58:45] [Music]
[1:58:48] and they were all filled with the Holy
[1:58:51] Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:58:53] tongues and the spirit gave them
[1:58:56] utterance
[1:59:06] amen so when this the scripture
[1:59:09] continues and when they went out outside
[1:59:11] of that room
[1:59:13] continue
[1:59:16] speaking in tongues
[1:59:20] and people saw what the head was a
[1:59:22] genuine spirit
[1:59:24] is
[1:59:27] and they asked the question is
[1:59:30] but how can we have the same thing
[1:59:37] answered in the same chapter verse 38.
[1:59:42] let's let's start from verse 37.
[1:59:47] Transit
[1:59:51] Bible says that now when they heard this
[1:59:55] they were pricked in their heart
[1:59:58] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[2:00:00] the Apostles
[2:00:02] men and Brethren what shall we do
[2:00:05] verses
[2:00:17] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[2:00:21] baptized every one of you in the name of
[2:00:23] Jesus Christ
[2:00:24] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[2:00:27] receive the gift of the Holy ghosts
[2:00:31] [Music]
[2:00:41] for the promise is unto you
[2:00:45] and to your children
[2:00:46] and to all that are far off even as
[2:00:50] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:00:53] come on
[2:00:56] foreign
[2:01:03] now verse 41 it says that then they that
[2:01:07] gladly received his word were baptized
[2:01:10] at the same day they were added unto
[2:01:13] them about 3 000 Souls
[2:01:20] [Music]
[2:01:26] um
[2:01:31] Peterson
[2:01:34] and be baptized
[2:01:37] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:01:39] Holy Spirit
[2:01:42] and you see what brought Isaac I've been
[2:01:44] baptized 14 years ago
[2:01:48] but but how can I still have that Spirit
[2:01:51] come out please continue to speak
[2:01:54] amen remember Paul didn't say that you
[2:01:58] will have the Holy Spirit When You
[2:01:59] Believe
[2:02:05] amen for some people it's a process
[2:02:46] because what God likes God likes a heart
[2:02:50] that's sincere but secretary
[2:02:53] amen because he's a God who knows
[2:02:55] everything
[2:02:57] amen he knows he sees you when you sin
[2:03:00] even when you think
[2:03:03] so there is no point of lying to us
[2:03:12] and be determined
[2:03:15] amen be determined
[2:03:17] amen and then you will see it yeah it
[2:03:21] might be determined you say that Lord if
[2:03:24] you don't give me the Holy Spirit right
[2:03:26] now
[2:03:29] you will find my bones when you're
[2:03:31] coming
[2:03:33] the prophet said that if you need the
[2:03:35] Holy Spirit
[2:03:37] and when you go to the Altar and you
[2:03:39] stop praying
