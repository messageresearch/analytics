this morning had to drive through a little bit of snow [Music] but we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ and his goodness I know that there are those who are out of town because of a wedding I believe amen but uh amen we'll work with what we have this morning [Music] amen we're going to come from uh this morning Daniel the 12th chapter 12 chapter and yes and we're going to read the 9th and 10th verse sir Daniel the 12th chapter 9 through the 10th verse I had to see our sister McCarthy doing better yeah glad to see you're doing better amen I want to say also to the young people those young children who were singing and and and and quoting those verses um I thank our brother John sent it to me and I was really blessed uh it excites me when I see the involvement of the young kids from up here there is a fair um it means a lot and I'm sure God is pleased with it and so we just thank God for the Sunday School all together I know it's not easy I tried it many times even in Des Moines are they coming they go they come and they go but I trust I trust this Sunday school stance amen God is good to us are you there in Daniel Daniel the 12th chapter we're going to read at the 9th and the 10th verse and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end foreign but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wise shall none of the wicked excuse me shall understand foreign foreign Lord we pray this morning service in a special way Lord we thank you for your anointing your presence we can't do one thing without you lord we asked this morning that you look beyond our thoughts of attention and see our needs oh God as we commit this service in your hands Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated yeah there are so many things that are in my mind this morning things I I like to say or preach the shots but if there be one thing that I want you to get this morning may yeah or to understand is that you are who you are because of the power and the influence of the word there are so many people in the world who really don't believe in God can look like you and personally I can't understand that because even when I was a little Fellowship I knew that there was a great one somewhere I may not have known him by name or even knew him personally but I knew that Jesus Christ was God it did you no one taught me about the Trinity because I knew God wasn't three persons are always somehow understood that there was only one God yeah I don't know how come I understood that other than it was given to me by God now I'm going to use some illustrations this morning because I want you to understand that God is omnipresent okay he's everywhere by way of his omniscience he knows everything and whether we believe it or not it is because of the in that we are here today I'm going to use America for an example brother Venom tells us that America was built okay on uh the Christian principle we understand by history that the pilgrims came to America okay to have freedom our constitution not the Constitution our churches our businesses everything by the principles of the word we were a clean Nation we were a moral Nation music we were a nation they had more miracles more signs and more wonders than any nation in the world or any nation that had ever existed in this day in time we have more preach and it's because of the preaching of the Cross or the preaching of the word Who We Are foreign if it had not been for the influence of the word in our personal lives where would we be on earth is that right yes the Bible says we had all we would have all to become like Sodom and Gomorrah we would have all become like Sodom and Gomorrah comes if it had not been a seed s that means if it wasn't for the word perverted in some way hallelujah amen and these things that we teach them influences their lives in ways that that if we had not taught them they would be confused especially in this age of who they are the second song we have in this day because of the lack of the the word of God we have people who are thinking that they are cats there are all kinds of animals because the Bible the Bible says that the book was sealed can they live right there hallelujah amen it was shut up and theologians can never bring a Revival hallelujah amen they can only give the dead letter this is why we see America in the conditions she's in condition it is no longer America it's the entire world amen thank God for the influence of the word of God hallelujah amen even to the young people you may think your parents are being too strictly but understand they are giving you the words in expectation that the word will influence in the right way that one day hey as you you would become a Christian hallelujah amen see the word will not return back voice this is what I love this is what I love and the word of God tells us without a vision okay without a vision the people perish oh because the vision is like [Music] [Music] [Music] there's no use of writing history books anymore there's no uh there's no need to write history books anymore because this is the end that means everything rules and the kingdom of God is ushering in it Hallelujah y'all believe that We Believe we believe that the book will shut up it was close it was sealed until this time now why would God unveil the book open the book in this day because he realized that the world would be in chaos when you remove God out of your house when you remove God out of your church when you remove God out of your life you become a chaos and the only reason we stand as men and women today we don't need science to determine what we are somebody amen the Bible says he made two genders and female amen [Music] oh man now we know the book will shut up but then God opened the book it may not just Revelation 10 . right Revelation 5. you we find out that there was a there was a great event that happened in our day hallelujah amen the Lamb of God came and opened the book it is [Music] the book became a new book Hallelujah it didn't change your old Bible into a new Bible about it did not change your old Bible into a new Bible novel right but the Revelation it was the revelation of the word of God that made the old Bible yeah second video the things you thought you knew you did not know them hallelujah oh man why because the book was sealed you couldn't understand God the way we understand they could not understand the way we understand they did not know God the way we know God why because the book was not open because [Music] said so and it talks about those seven Thunders and then he began to give us an illustration it's like a rocket saying now that the book is open it'll never be close again Hallelujah and the revelation of this book this will leave will continue to unfold it will continue to unfold to the believer hallelujah amen that's why we could not just stop stop with William Branham Ave I'm not against William Branham but if you don't see what he came to do you won't understand who you are understand what I'm saying we needed him hallelujah amen he was the one God used Hallelujah to open the book hallelujah amen right or to make us see what's open Hallelujah because only the lamb could have opened the book hallelujah amen and only William Brothers [Applause] [Music] [Music] this is the reason why I'm here this is my Ministry to identify the Lamb of God hallelujah is that right that's the way it is it was with John so was it with Brothers he was the one to identify hallelujah amen wow the world was in darkness some of his best friends I mean left him Hallelujah glory to God but there were a few here there were those a few yes who have been influenced is your influence not by then the the the the letter of the word but by the revelation of the world hallelujah amen there are those you know who understood he complained Hallelujah that when brother banham that that literally [Music] [Music] because Jesus says I am the alpha at the Omega in Omega I am the beginning I am the end Hallelujah that's why brother Branham could not just preaching of the New Testament he had to go back to the Old Testament Hallelujah he went all the way in too the mind of God he showed us what God is not us somebody help me here he showed our beginning and he showed us our ending hallelujah amen let me say it like this no matter what the devil tries to do with you those of us those of us who are predestinated those of us who have been chosen those of us who are bright there is no demon in Hell okay that can stop us from making a Rapture Hallelujah why do you say that brother Hallelujah [Music] Adam gave his life for Eve forever for Eve Hallelujah and Jesus Christ gave his life hallelujah amen somebody help me here see the revelation of the word brings an influence on everybody Hallelujah the revelation of the word brings it both every where or whether you care Hallelujah the rain falls on the justice that had 12 disciples Hallelujah and the Bible says one of them was a devil oh my God the same anointing that took the 11 to The Upper Room hallelujah it's the same minority that made Judas betray God somebody help me here see the rain doesn't change the sea and if you have passionate whatever seed you are that rain is going to produce it brother Branham says every Revival brings three kinds of believersial what is it it is the seed that's in you that's what determine who you are somebody help me here you got the make-believers I hope everybody's in here this morning when you stand as a Believer hallelujah amen and if you are a Believer the devil is upset he's trying to do everything he can yeah what he's doing now he's messing with your mind he's trying to make you think you bout to mama by the influence of the word the Bible says let the let the kids Hallelujah that means it must be your will second video Hallelujah God Will Take Over You Hallelujah yeah that's the truth influence of the world how are you say it like this brother because the word is God think about this out of the trillions of people that lived on the earth and out of the trillions of people either going to heaven or hell yeah you know God knows exactly where they are yeah he knows exactly what they're doing at this moment he is the controller of all things [Music] the Bible said that's what David said if I make my bed in hell if I make my bed in hell Thou Art there amen so there's no way of getting around him Hallelujah that's what the prophet of God says he's so high you can't get over him he's so low you can't go under him so you must come through the door hallelujah amen now I said all of this because we have a tendency to forget how good is God has been to us God is good to us even now remember now how many in here feel good in your body come on now that in itself is a blessing your body then you remember how good you used to feel alone it takes away the pain the country if I will tell you you feel like a new person y'all know what I'm talking about it's so good to know that God is still a Healer I didn't bring my letter with me but I intended to bring it some time ago I had cancer the doctor said I had it or whatever the case may be uh y'all heard my testimony so my wife I was trying to get more insurance for me so my wife if something should happen to me she won't have to go around with a cup on her in her hand on on the streets y'all know what I'm saying yeah so in order for me to do that I had to go to the insurance to the I had to have a physical and and they did the MRI and everything now I got it in writing man I was just a lot exactly I got the documents here this in my book bag that says I have cancer and now I have the document says I'm cancer-free yes [Music] yes the devil is a liar glory to God Amen see what I'm trying to say is he's the same secretary yesterday today and forever Hallelujah amen amen listen equity what we saw in William Branham was to never stop foreign but we as a people knew and thank you people because we kept looking at him almost but we know we have life here now maybe it's just just but I believe in the Supernatural and I believe that if you're a True Believer the supernatural was supposed to follow you hallelujah amen I believe now now we're not a prophet sometimes that's what William Brandon was that William Branham came to that Perfection otherwise we won't if he did not we won't come to Perfection because he saw the revelation of the word brings us to that Perfection you see the book had to be open the full word a revelation of who God is coming from the message spiritual food and due season uh I get excited see let me tell you something there's some of these shows you can't just read this message or just listen to it you got to meditate on it and pray that's the only way the Revelation comes you understand what I mean because you can say exactly what brother Branham says and yet be a false witness when you don't understand if you don't understand the spiritual applications you're just repeating what he says so you give an illustration they said Jesus said in three days but he said it in that that he preached to them selves why we have to be careful I got a quote brother said it ain't the missiles that we need to be afraid of he says it's the churches it's the churches so you'll know it's not me the churches that you need to be afraid in this last day listen spiritual food in due season paragraph 70. he said now do you see where I'm trying to get you too I spoke with you pretty plain this morning don't you see the authority of the Living God in the Living Church the bride no voice sick or healed it is a message and the messenger who is now the Church and that church has the purse listen that person is Jesus Christ it's the message and you the message and you must become one remember hallelujah amen not the message and the preacher Parliament the message and the bride must become one and when we become one and the bride let me see the same he said she is the message hey amen it never the word stayed on the stones Bliss until Jesus Christ came it moved from a hearted hearted Stone y'all hear me because the law couldn't save nobody literally brought death but when we saw the word coming flesh that I share God in Christ we understood now where the Bible says God no longer write on tablets of stone yeah but he writes on the tables of the hearts somebody help me what is it the very word foreign you say what do you mean because he was and he is we get the word eternal life because God gave it to us so that we could better understand hallelujah amen but then the prophet comes around it has no beginning and that person is Jesus Christ now being influenced foreign did you know that every time you talk words it's put in a book did y'all know that yes beginning at the 60 first oh verses says don't be in a rush but I just don't you understand that you are who you are was that because why do you have boundaries and the world has none somewhere where you build you have been living the foreign thou shall not steal thou shall not kill your Ten Commandments What Child that you know of has never stolen get along I mean you know you have children fussing over toys and one would say that's mine yeah when they know it's not theirs and then they will act a lot they act just like it's there therefore I should come see and then mama you know this is not your time we don't have to teach him how to lie yeah those babies are crying like they wet or cry like they hungry remember yeah right and some babies take it farther than that when they want you to rock them when you when they want you to rock them nothing's wrong with them but they just want that attention who taught that baby how to lie yeah we're born with that nature for parents to teach them the word of God that you you yourself the word of God just one more statement how many times how many times you allowed yourself to get slack with reading the word and then Satan trip you up foreign [Music] [Music] who would have believed it but the Bible said hallelujah amen oh come on somebody the same Bible that prophesied about Judas prophesied about America the whole world and we have become exactly exactly what the world the words say we would world that is because we moved away from the world she moved away from the world and when she moved away from the world look what happened you see that song and that wrote denominational Church I'm getting excited because that is the key [Music] third chapter verses then they that fear the lord speak often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the lord and that thought upon his name y'all hallelujah amen so when you're thinking about the message do you know what you're doing you're thinking upon his name hallelujah amen and they shall they said the Lord I get excited sorry spareth his own son that serveth him y'all hear what I'm saying the wrath of God is here and it's going to coins Hallelujah they tell us that there's going to be a stock market s that he did but I'm not worried about it because in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion don't worry about that your concerns are to be how how close I am how where I am in the eyes of God you know you know yeah for a long time there are things in places in your life Victorious but sometimes God will leave a little something he'll leave it there to keep you praying and then when he brings you to a place of perfection hey when your purpose has been fulfilled comfortable he would then take that away is that right just like brother Venom said in in as I was with Moses that he is I'm paraphrasing he's not looking at your failures he's looking at your commission because there is not one man who was born of a woman foreign [Music] and I want to go there and I want to go there and see it thought s is that right why would you say that because Brothers in God's way of saying that he said it like this whatsoever you say whatever you ask it would be a two seconds that's in this I don't mean do that I'm almost done when I told you I was ahead a little bit longer y'all got really tired so and I know it's warm in here so let me hurry up the 18th verse then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that served God and him that serveth him not Hallelujah foreign now in the Book of Job you don't have to turn there you want to write it down job 37 message 11 to 13. but I'm going to tell you what he says and what the water does the house and all of these days he said he causes it to come for correction yeah and I said all of that because we must come to understand the anointing right and the Bible said the anointing organized let me let me read this quote coming from the message of what is the Holy Ghost 1959 . now the spirit of God has worked at the justification sanctification on the western uh baptism of the Holy ghosts and here in the last day performing and do it what is it the church in Christ has become one uh you're listening to that yes he said now they're doing the very same thing it's the scary part because no matter how you how you well the very same thing like Christ did you started it's supposed to be done Hey listen let's go on and as soon as they connect together the church in Christ as soon as they connected or something that last link is every effort we have not yet connected no yeah because he said as soon as soon okay they connect that last link through the church he's not talking about Pentecostals she'll go through the through this up will come Wesley yeah and all the rest of them back in those days will be loud and he that last will be first can we come out of the Resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost does it's a secular sentence the Holy Ghost by justification just a little shadow by the restoration being in here forming signs and wonders like he did at the beginning he said going to called me Holy Roller anyhow let me apply foreign let me try to get to this one oh God is good I tell you if we could just you know he said brother books like have you arrived no but I'm on my way I see where I'm here and I'm fighting I'm battling every day sometimes all day knowing the will of God but what are you fighting the Brooks iniquity hallelujah amen I am a total believer of this word hallelujah but like Paul say how to perform it my last quote coming from the supernatural right Jehovah great Jehovah God who lived before there was an eternity you was without father yeah without mother here's some mayor without beginning of days reading upon the pages of this sacred books how the things that you did in the days of your the show and to have the privilege of the living in this Dark Age hallelujah amen a privilege of living in this Dark Age at the end of the world and seeing you rise on the scene again no guessing no man-made theology no cold atmosphere of just joining a church or singing a paper or signing a paper but living in the Shekinah Glory and the influence of the Resurrection confirming feeling and I receive it is I don't know how he's going to do it hallelujah amen let me ask you a question how do you make a baby when that baby's in you in that mother you don't know how it's done for me y'all hear what I'm saying and in spirit speaking on a spiritual level it's the seed to be planted and it's going to bring forth Hallelujah that's how it is God prepared your ground y'all don't know that dude I'm gonna show you just a moment and I'm closing close this okay I appreciate everybody that comes here right after work I really appreciate you is thank you so much let me show you how God prepared you this is different grounds one stone ground one ground has Stones y'all know the parents but there was one ground that was prepared and whether you believe it or not all the stuff you've gone through two seconds good and bad I get excited because you got to know that you know what you need a savior in order for the savior Hallelujah and so when we win y'all know this message is right you know it's right what makes you know it's right when everybody else calls you the devil huh Jesus was called the devil Diablo when others was calling him the son of God what makes it soul yes that's where we failed we're so busy measuring ourselves by each other [Music] that can save me you can't even save yourself make you one better than the other yeah [Music] but when I see you I don't care and I see me we're in the same pot if it's not delicious Hallelujah y'all understand what I'm saying let me say it like this so he prepared you hello what we need a revelation of this message more than anything revelation of God's grace we need a true Revelation God's grace toward us personally I'm very new once you get that you don't care what nobody says Jesus Christ and he's the one you let us sell that is the most important yeah [Music] Lord have mercy yes the Bible said he just us freely um what what did she do deserve Adam's love for her you know most men when things go wrong we blame our wives y'all getting quiet on me now I didn't hear them celebrities it's me okay what I'm trying to say is when things go wrong that's when Grace need to be given [Music] to her [Music] that's how Christ loved me yes he'll kick me out when I do wrong yeah you know what he does he looks on me huh y'all looking at me like I'm crazy [Music] if you're gonna be a real Christian that's the way it goes Let's Dance Hallelujah some people can't even say Amen but I'm gonna tell y'all something remember you can show us when I see War the love of God between husband and wife like God says it ought to be come I don't know that the Rapture said hey hey hallelujah amen like I said in there in the morning you won't Revival in the church you get a Revival in your home yeah then you get a Revival in your home you get the Revival in your home get the Revival in your home and then bring to the Bible to church [Music] [Music] and I trust that you always pray for me yes [Music] yes [Music] it is our prayer you know my thing is I want a greater understanding a greater revelation [Music] okay my position with God my position how many of us [Music] don't you wish that we could just get rid of this flesh [Music] because most of us if we didn't have this flesh would be perfect already [Music] I said if we didn't have this flesh is [Music] changing from glory to glory becoming more and more like him yeah foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] every day of his life [Music] thank you [Music] father [Music] Hallelujah [Music]
