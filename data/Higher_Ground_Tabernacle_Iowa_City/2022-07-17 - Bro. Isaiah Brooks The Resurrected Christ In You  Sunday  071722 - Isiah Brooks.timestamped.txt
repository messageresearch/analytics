[54:55] history
[54:57] even
[54:58] the hidden wisdom which god

[55:04] glory
[55:06] which none of the princes
[55:11] which none of the princes of this world
[55:13] knew
[55:15] for had they known it
[55:17] they would not have crucified the lord
[55:20] of glory
[55:37] [Music]
[55:43] but as it is written
[55:45] i
[55:46] have not seen
[55:48] nor heard
[55:50] neither have entered into the heart of
[55:53] man the things which god have prepared
[55:56] for them that love him
[55:59] my community
[56:00] says
[56:13] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[56:16] his spirit
[56:17] for the spirit searches all things yea
[56:21] the deep things of god
[56:29] make the is
[56:30] jew
[56:31] but what more what man knoweth the
[56:33] things of a man
[56:35] save the spirit of man which is in him
[56:39] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[56:42] but the spirit of god
[56:49] alone
[56:57] now we have received not the spirit of
[57:00] the world
[57:01] but the spirit which is of god
[57:04] that we might know
[57:06] the things that are freely given to us
[57:09] of god
[57:10] oh
[57:28] we thank you for your amazing grace

[59:32] god will be able to utter through me the
[59:35] words of life that he you need to hear
[59:45] i'd like to entitle this message
[59:52] the resurrection of christ in you
[59:55] the resurrection of
[59:58] christ my question this morning
[1:00:03] what is your revelation of the message
[1:00:09] because your understanding and your
[1:00:11] revelation of it
[1:00:25] what god did in our day
[1:00:28] secretary
[1:00:29] it's beyond
[1:00:32] all ages
[1:00:35] and the real truth of the message
[1:00:39] has come to a selected
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:01:08] what it was all about when jesus christ
[1:01:11] died and rose again
[1:01:17] many of us before coming to this light
[1:01:22] [Music]
[1:01:23] we worship jesus christ
[1:01:26] according to traditions
[1:01:30] tradition
[1:01:31] even though the word of god says ma'am
[1:01:34] see all about that that god is looking
[1:01:37] for those
[1:01:41] who will worship him
[1:01:44] in spirit and in truth
[1:01:52] i thank god
[1:01:55] for his faithfulness
[1:01:59] many of us take the message lightly
[1:02:04] and
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:31] it is this generation
[1:02:34] generation it is this message
[1:02:38] that will produce jesus christ in a way
[1:02:44] that it will cause a resurrection
[1:02:48] resurrection hallelujah amen this is not
[1:02:51] some religion
[1:02:55] this is god hiding himself in simplicity
[1:03:06] [Music]
[1:03:13] in such a way i tell point you only
[1:03:16] those who have been chosen by god said
[1:03:20] my secret will be able to see the move
[1:03:24] of god
[1:03:26] movement hallelujah
[1:03:28] every
[1:03:55] but the people of every age
[1:03:58] they had substance
[1:04:01] in substance they had representation
[1:04:05] they had god amen delivering them
[1:04:10] by way
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:24] he just did not call luther only in a
[1:04:27] person
[1:04:28] but god had predestinated it
[1:04:32] those who could have an ear
[1:04:35] to hear the message of luther
[1:04:40] [Applause]
[1:04:53] and they thought because god brought
[1:04:55] them out
[1:04:58] they were the ultimate of the age he's a
[1:05:00] different master
[1:05:02] failed to see that god was moving on
[1:05:20] what
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:30] there's got to be more god somewhere

[1:06:53] tongues
[1:06:54] miracles

[1:07:34] hallelujah
[1:07:37] when the message of the hour came
[1:07:40] hallelujah
[1:07:54] but one thing i am saying that in short
[1:07:57] if they are seen there see he had the
[1:08:00] sense of god is not moving on them
[1:08:07] hallelujah
[1:08:10] they did go into the systematic worship
[1:08:15] hallelujah
[1:08:17] and when they defined it

[1:34:24] [Music]
[1:34:30] controversy
[1:34:42] listen what brother says
[1:34:58] see when i read his quotes godzilla it's
[1:35:01] the quotes
[1:35:03] from the son of man
[1:35:06] he was a
[1:35:08] son of man
[1:35:10] he was a prophet of our day
[1:35:12] but
[1:35:15] is what was speaking through him
[1:35:18] and bringing the message of our day
[1:35:25] i heard i heard it you said but the
[1:35:27] messenger and the messenger is the same
[1:35:29] message
[1:35:32] but that's supposed to be true in you
[1:35:33] too

[1:35:44] you know i know god is here

[1:35:50] i know it's that god is trying to
[1:35:52] quicken us
[1:36:06] because you've been taught
[1:36:08] once you come to the message
[1:36:10] you got it
[1:36:14] that is wrong
[1:36:16] you got to be justified
[1:36:19] you've got to be sanctioned
[1:36:21] you got to be filled with the
[1:36:23] [Music]
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:36] people just do what they
[1:36:51] and they kept doing what they wanted to
[1:36:53] do
[1:36:55] and god wouldn't allow them to go into
[1:36:56] this project
[1:36:59] somebody helped me here all right why
[1:37:01] because they had the wrong spirits
[1:37:18] amen
[1:37:22] hallelujah
[1:37:24] he says but now but in this day
[1:37:28] there is to come a super hero
[1:37:31] in super royal seed of abraham in
[1:37:34] semester wild abraham how many of y'all
[1:37:36] feel super confident
[1:37:39] you understand what i'm saying
[1:37:41] it's more than a mind game
[1:37:46] it's more than convincing yourself
[1:37:48] simply for confidence it's got to be
[1:37:50] more than that
[1:37:52] hallelujah
[1:37:55] wouldn't it sound strange
[1:37:59] if you saw a real lion
[1:38:02] and he would open his mouth to roar
[1:38:09] and you would get a meow
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:24] [Music]
[1:38:29] like this he said many people you know
[1:38:31] they died from a heart attack did they
[1:38:33] get this young when the lion roared
[1:38:37] reminded us
[1:38:40] they become fast food
[1:38:56] when satan
[1:39:03] [Music]
[1:40:02] [Music]
[1:40:04] it has to be controlling you
[1:40:20] it can become really aggravating
[1:40:25] a little better to pull you back over
[1:40:29] you love what you're doing but it's
[1:40:30] placed in there for your protection
[1:40:34] what you
[1:40:36] the holy ghost is in you to protect you
[1:40:39] you sent the spirit of he is your
[1:40:41] preserver
[1:40:46] it's got to be a spiritual seed
[1:40:50] [Music]
[1:41:11] and the time and the place is a promise
[1:41:14] that's given to her omum
[1:41:26] that everybody different ones sold seeds
[1:41:30] right
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:45] may know and thank you legend we got a
[1:41:47] hold of the seed
[1:41:49] we say oh my god we got it
[1:41:53] and we failed to see
[1:41:55] when new man called the vote it had to
[1:41:57] grow questions
[1:42:01] and because people couldn't see hey
[1:42:04] what was coming after the prophets
[1:42:07] leaving us
[1:42:09] many of them walked away
[1:42:12] hallelujah
[1:42:21] we're the pride of jesus christ
[1:42:24] she speaks
[1:42:25] to identify
[1:42:32] [Music]
[1:42:41] the paper
[1:42:44] supernatural
[1:42:47] filled with the holy ghost example
[1:42:50] it's more than shouting
[1:42:52] jesus
[1:43:07] hallelujah
[1:43:09] is that right
[1:43:10] you've got to believe this message
[1:43:11] whatever quarks in order to make a
[1:43:13] rapture who are they going to live
[1:43:14] tomorrow
[1:43:15] say brother brooks proved that
[1:43:18] the only way they believed the only way
[1:43:19] they missed noah's flood was to believe
[1:43:21] noah
[1:43:36] he told those pharisees
[1:43:38] scholars
[1:43:40] scholars
[1:43:42] a doctorate of divinities
[1:43:44] says
[1:43:45] well educated
[1:43:47] again he's told them
[1:43:50] except you believe that i am he i want
[1:43:53] you for you shall be likewise

[1:44:38] message for the most part we made a cult
[1:44:40] out of it

[1:44:57] that if a person don't believe like i
[1:44:59] believe
[1:45:00] he's lost he said it proves
[1:45:03] that you're lost
[1:45:10] that's
[1:45:16] hmm
[1:45:18] you don't know the mind of god
[1:45:20] when you say paul up and say did you
[1:45:22] you don't know god what god is doing
