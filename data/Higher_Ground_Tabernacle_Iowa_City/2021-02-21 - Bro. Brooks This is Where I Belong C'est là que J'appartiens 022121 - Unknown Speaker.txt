[Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] is give god a round of applause hallelujah thank god good hallelujah hey many many men it's a beautiful song we're gonna go to third chapter we'll read the third and fourth verse for ye are dead and your life is here with christ in god colossians 12 when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory first corinthians 16th first says 16th first third chapter know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you and the 30th verse in your name lord jesus amen amen you may be seated i have just a little thought this morning and i will entitle this message this is where i belong when we consider considering what god has done for us we should be overwhelmed with joy that in these last days as it is falling apart politically socially everything seems to be breaking to choose something we know that we're living in the time that brother branham calls the united times everything is united to choose for a long time being a christian something that we did not know how to define as [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] and you become this message you have already made it home hallelujah i'm gonna say it again when you see this message what's in me when you understand this message and when you receive [Music] pentecostal he could make this message [Music] only one life he sees life is christ hallelujah amen it was a very profound statement made by jesus himself in saint john 10 30. when he said i and the father are once i want you to think about that [Music] hallelujah hallelujah what was he doing just confusing they said to him you being a man make yourself god to fail them dude this is why we want to kill you but brother branham said it like jesus he was not a man making himself god he was god making himself a man [Music] you that when god revealed to moses that tabernacle has it fallen mankind uh to fall into fallen mankind hallelujah we had no idea but here was god was [Music] on how mankind was going to return back to him and that's what god became to israel god became to israel a power in a box in in hallelujah but god is greater than a box okay [Music] if i make my bed in hell at the same time hallelujah hallelujah why because he's a mission because he knows all the things he connected to jesus he knows the beginning from the end from the beginning [Music] [Music] when you see me come to me come to hallelujah followed the character he was talking about the lies hallelujah somebody helped me here see because you and i must understand that god is a spirit and no men have seen god at any time hallelujah but jesus said when you see me you see the father hallelujah what was christ working with just get kissed he was working with the kind of glory that was in the vessel of jesus christ the bible says that the fullness of god like plenty too did you the something is going on he's confused on the devil y'all hear what i'm saying the process of a seed he [Music] we passed the brazen altar [Music] hallelujah not where the candlesticks were standing thank you is what is it united with god are they good oh somebody help me give me this yes it's broad grooming together i see you on somebody is that right this message don't send me search i said it again under this message there's a united nations see this is where i belong this is where you belong hallelujah that means why are you different like yourself are you different brother i'm saying like he said even when you was a child [Music] you could not put until you came to this message because [Music] the bible says [Music] when you i what the people don't understand is that you and i are part of the god hey do i want some of you you mister and mrs jesus somebody help me [Music] i hope you can see it there he said but all that belong to god god will raise up again god loses nothing jesus says that's right he that eats this bread eternal life and i'll raise him up again [Applause] that's his promises is eating so now make snow instead of an angel oh you didn't know they're keeping them away from history out there driving them along to this street [Music] every time you falls seven times in a day and he gets up and he's a living a righteous man oh uh long sister paul is seven times in a day he thumbs it follows you and tells him to get up he cannot lose [Music] oh my he says so now instead of an angel out there keeping them away from this tree it's out there driving them along the angels of the churches launched [Music] stands in the midst of the paradise of god he says that you may partake of him but what you don't understand if you complain that you make up the paradise hallelujah the paradise that he's standing in right now he stands in the paradise that's in you know tree of life standing in the paradise of god that you may partake of him [Music] [Music] you say why would you say that he said i'd go to prepare a place for you he might be awesome you said he's got a kingdom yes he's got a kingdom all right [Music] behind me eternal life and shall never come into the judgment do you understand what that is now i'm not coming i don't have to worry about the sins i used to do in the first place and my god thank you and your god to keep all of his promises hallelujah i don't have to worry about it see your time is now um everybody gets their time everybody ha everybody comes into their time and everybody comes into their season just just for a little thought before he was anointed in the mind of god david was already king david samuel was just an instrument samuel who was knowing him hallelujah hallelujah king wow at the moment he was anointed [Music] hallelujah [Music] why because god chose you to be in france remember different ones wanted to be king different people wanted to be king person you know after david but god had already chosen solomon david uh do you have a justice league hallelujah hallelujah and it didn't make it doesn't make any difference a person proclaimed to be something put the approval on it he's nothing could be said there is because i think a lot of us are taking god for granted you need to get closer what shall we do with this jesus call christ and go ahead if you don't know the decision that subject you know he's not talking about jesus two thousand years ago he's talking about jesus and i want you to understand and trying to find a way to get rid of him hallelujah this is a new day another day and they crucified the lord of fresh again what shall we do with with love in my heart for all people uh it was showing how the pope he just uh uh uh uh dethroned a cardinal african cardinal and cardinal because the cardinals was too conservative conservative hallelujah now i want you to understand what i'm saying because the as a cloak for christianity come in in ph real there he got rid of him he said he's on the bar city y'all better wake up and smell the coffee hallelujah you must understand it's later than you think i'll wait for the squeeze you have to do it on your free moral wheel now not when that time takes place [Music] not when that time takes place when it does it's over i'm gonna say that he said when it does it's over this may be the last day you'll have time to make choices don't somebody help me but they failed to get anointed with the anointing and if you fail that [Music] moses told his disciples and his people [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] that's what we should be doing is [Music] [Applause] he needs to [Music] would have come into the ark would have come [Music] they just have not yet i know i have to be careful on what i say what's what's in america in her politics it's all over the world is that right yes she's in chapter 13. i literally she's in the book i literally leave her she has a relationship going on between us and the vatican hello he's told us the next move when they're in their secret chamber against the world um [Music] god has already told us that what the next movie is they had all these little tricks going on magicians and all of these different acts that went on before before hallelujah that's happening in the world or the world council of churches come out of here they have not yet forgotten you know what god did through his service second do you have failure y'all hear me they have not forgotten no problem hallelujah let me move on by god's grace so just going um so is it back again but let me jump up a little bit but now the government is involved in it so is it back again so is it back again it's right back in the lab again with the scriptures laying here identified you don't see that's exactly what jesus said would happen exactly why do we stagger on in this hour of darkness jehovah has set the scene trying to get and you see the message of elected abraham that was already out and everything exactly it took choosing the name name and what is it hey what just kissing i know where i belong i'm not a methodist pentecostal i don't belong to nobody hallelujah it's the life of christ i feed the christian that that's i'm a part of let's say i'll say he's a part of me y'all understand what i'm saying hallelujah let's move on i'm almost done i know i've been lost see the son of man has already been revealed [Music] [Music] we've got the world council of churches coming up you can um and jesus said you said i will hallelujah hallelujah and he said for this purpose you gotta know your purpose [Music] [Music] then shall ye the creation in the beginning male and female had the same name because they had the same characteristics hallelujah god called their name liza must bear the same name jesus is every knee shall bow why the devil don't want you with the holy ghost save the holy ghost and when i say the holy ghost of jesus christ [Music] don't care what you're going through sickness within stripes i'm healed oh and that devil don't have a word to say jesus hallelujah you're the greatest mystery ever surely got me still ah did you know that here was eve i'm gonna say it like that here was eve hidden in adam i don't know in there all the time [Music] when god broke that sixth seal hallelujah he went into adam and then [Music] jesus and all they thought about is what he used to do all the miracles that happened somebody because christ had already given them charges in charge of the situation hey look to jesus hallelujah carrot doubt not that we perish careth doubt not that we perish [Music] you don't have that's too pentecostal oh just like i tell people and i'm closing now for sure because i can't finish it but but i want to say it like that just like people get sick when people get sick the temperature is a hundred and three they go check and see if the temperature then came down there [Applause] brother said they told him he could never eat them beans [Music] [Applause] take authority if you really believe the message forward you know if you need to be sanctified speak your signification you know you've got to be phil speaking to it talk to god who can give it to you hallelujah hallelujah you love the lord 24th verses and we're closed there you love the lord skip who's in me [Music] this is where i belong i remember my first time trying to ride a two-wheel bicycle i would fall a lot of times sometimes i had to run into a tree in order to stop because it became a revelation let me and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless until the coming of the lord jesus christ i think this may be one of the first places or the the only place that paul breaks man up into three [Music] and how often do we try to keep our whole soul spirit me schedule the company and if god promised to do it he'll do it look what the 24th verse says faithful is he the call to call it you who will also do it the 24th verse here the first decimal is the fifth chapter 24 23-24 oh legit and faithful is he that calleth you also will do it if you don't remember anything else remember that 24th he calls you if we could just really trust him you'll really see god bring some powerful things to pass in your life who also will do it [Music] but that faith must be tried it's got to be tried [Music] and don't think you're gonna don't make it too much just do whatever [Music] those who he loved [Music] [Music] well one day my son told we can make it up make up for it but one thing i know that he knows every licking he got every whipping he received he knows we love him he's sick and if you've got a chase in your kids make sure you add the love part y'all understand what i'm saying just the way god does he he he he he does those kind of things for us he should suppose hallelujah you love the lord i i hope god said something to you this morning [Music] nowhere and this is the thing that's transforming me now are you
