TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that our testimony after we leave the meeting we commit ourselves the remainder of the service into thine hands to your glory and honor in the lovely name of jesus christ god's people said amen god bless you tonight you may be seated amen amen i would like to start this evening by quoting from the message of the hour from the message brother bannon preached when he started on the series of the seven church ages the first message in that series the premier dance series was the message he entitled the patmos vision now what i'll be reading tonight directly off the tape say from and brother branham addresses this scripture that we used as texts this evening and he says all right now in the spirit on the lord's day he says now remember the first thing you have to do is what [Music] going in the spirit get in the spirit so you see brother and sister we're not to wait till we get the holy ghost to get in the spirit of want we're to get in the spirit first when you were in this when you were as a sinner god wasn't your picture and you went to a dance okay party i didn't dance you got in that spirit position he says you started clapping your hands patting your when we come to the house of god that's why the lord ordained singing clapping our hands the purpose of that god that's why we do that it's not as a tradition it's not to be a ritual but we come to the house of god on purpose don't feel like it comes because if you came and you felt like it but where's the sacrifice sacrifice god knew god knew the battle he knew that satan would be against us so god said come and offer your sacrifice sacrifice amen so it's not based on whether we feel like you should say that we're a christian brother when you make that sacrifice sacrifice god honors it because he knows your heart he knows what your purpose is he knows what your desire that if you claim [Music] but we're all sons and daughters amen glory praise the lord i don't mind saying this i he said you go to the ball game somebody knocks a home run or a frappe and you say well i guess that was pretty good he said you wouldn't be a baseball fiend a baseball fan when somebody knocks a home run can't get cam for my uh frapple ball you raise up win knock somebody's hat off and nobody says a word about it brother sister we are jesus fan he said by the blood of jesus christ and the life that lived in him come back and live in me and along with that promise that certainly is worthy of an amen i want to take some things here brother branham said concerning this and i'll be reading some statements here from the message of the hour brother branham says he says god hasn't got any shortcuts you come by the cross born again filled with the holy ghost or you're gone you're lost a person cannot be born again until they have received the holy ghost you can't you are not even converted there is one work of grace yeah only one work of grace and that's the holy spirit and it's made in three manifestations he says there is three works of grace there is a manifestation of justification by manifestation a man believes god and says yes sir i believe i accept jesus christ his son as my personal and then the next stage your manifestation the baptism of the holy spirit he said those three things the torsos make up the new birth vote brother madam gave us a great example you're not going to use it it's full of dirt so then you take it in the house you wash it out you clean it up and then you set it aside for service and then you feel it and drink from it that is what constitutes a new birth now let's uh let's let's look at this i know this is simple but it's the word of god substitute for the holy ghost psychology is all right correct but it's no substitute for the holy spirit because brother sister the holy ghost is god's ordained way without it saul sent this please you've got to teach people a lot of things should i fix the book with this because now you must have got the nature of christ and the one that wrote amen amen glory brother branham he gave us a lot of information brother i believe today with what god has sent us by this messenger with these 1200 tapes without an excuse not to be born again amen praise the lord brother branham if you study through the message the number one word that he used to describe the new birth brother you are not sister going to get the holy ghost he says that's why so many it is try to dodge the new birth he said they want it classic they don't want it messy brother branham use the word squall squall it means a tearful screams girl he used the word ball it is useless he used the word flock flop stagger stagger screaming acting like a maniac these are the words he said i don't care if you flop like a chicken with his head [Music] the word snotting snotty snotting that's a runny nose that's how he described a new bird circumcised cheers streaming decree beating on an altar evil just to be in a holy ghost atmosphere which we've got to start somewhere that's why we worship the lord yeah years ago yeah i read an article in a scientific magazine magazine what caught was a actually called the national geographic uh uh and they had articles that was entitled the wars within uh he tied it to the children of israel getting over into canaan and although god promised him that land they had to fight forever it's a promise it was a study on our immune system system as i read the article they said that the reason that when you get sick the virus itself has no life in it it has to have a host that has to have another life to draw from is the cell looks healthy on the outside it can look inside and see if there's an infection and what it does it stops guessing let's send it to something reaches in it takes an antigen takes a piece of the virus and holds it out and they that immune system it's the immune response that brings on the fever it's not the virus it's the response of the but you're not is [Music] that god's word who can have power with you and drive out the enemies praise the lord benedict amen glory hallelujah brother madam said that you must be willing to die out of us what he said it's not enough just to come under the anointing of the lord but it's got to move from around us it's going to go past the bottom it's still the holy spirit doing the work but brother sister we've got to be filled with the holy ghost he said you've got to die out and rot out like an old potato but amen brother i've seen those you have two that can come into a meeting the holy spirit's moving where the freaky creed now i want to read something to you brother bannon said this is in the ephesian church age said brother bannon says here the true vine hated the formal deeds of the nicolaitans formal religion in religion former is no different than catholicism the catholicism there's a lot of things that god doesn't like a lot of things we've got the word of god that lets us know the mind of god you know without faith it's impossible for us to deficient faith by hearing now in serving god with all the things that we know god doesn't like okay you're gonna start [Music] the word formal formalism in the webster dictionary in the dictionary formal means stiff uh what do they call a dead person in order to be formal poetry you have to act formal fairly formalism so when we come to the house of god the bible says to show forth his praises the bible has the book of acts act the book of acts [Music] but hey man let me read something today in the message ephesian church age defense brother branham points out how that the church at ephesus commanders which this is the ephesian church age isis that god is addressing there in the book of revelation that of all of paul's churches of all of paul's churches church at ephesus was the what do most say he said that he could teach people first things to them then he could any of his other churches how that god complimented them he said i appreciate your labor your work how that you cannot bear those which are evil and you found those that say they are apostles to be liars it was a vessel they would compare what was being preached but the bible says after god complimented them for their many good ways he said i have someone against you he pointed out a direction they were taking you've held up for my name wouldn't that be just a good thing of this tabernacle today his followers says he said wouldn't this be a good thing for the tabernacle today you've had labor you've had words that you've you left the listen to for those good old-fashioned holy ghost meetings notice this ramekin this was a group that once had holy ghost meetings is that don't know what a holy ghost to let head on to say amen to the word of god not ashamed to say praise the lord the lord said you're unashamed to say glory to god the dead are jewish amen [Music] but what gets in the way because he packs the dirty name of holy roller he packs the dirty name of holy roller within our own message that pentecost has become a dirty word pentecost not a dirty word pentecost is to restore the pentecostal denominations it's these tapes will never make you afraid of the holy ghost how could malachi 4. make us afraid of the very experience the experience that he was ordained to take us back to restore us to the faith it has the same action in his children that is our fault praise the lord benefited amen amen he says you left that love that you once had for them good old-fashioned holy ghost meetings [Music] the and you're you've begun to kind of slide backwards into that formal [Music] brother sister when you're on fire for god there's a protection guard did you against the world but when you begin to he exposed their mistake and he said therefore repent that means you do something about it okay whatever god said repent go back to pentecost amen amen amen praise the lord venice don't you love the word of god i want to read this to you let me just check this watch brother brooks i honestly don't know when i started here so i'll i'll try to finish it i i understand brother brooks we'll be back sunday night dear pastor lets me come praise the lord listen to this brother quotes this scripture probably takes you and he says remember therefore he's quoting scripture here remember therefore from whence thou art fallen he says where did you come from from pentecost you fell down to where you are now back now and repent do thy first works he says go back to pentecost not to the denomination he got it justification was preached by luther 400 years ago we're way beyond that age then without let's let's rightly divide this word of truth look age and his message was without holiness you shall not see god sanctification sanctification the sanctification now brother sister men afraid we're amen take the next age the age of pentecost god restored the gifts the holy ghost back to the age oh we're in the without being first born in the family m than being born in the family when you're born in the family that makes you a son for me but not every son born in the family unless you were born in the family so brother sister we have much more to be responsible than just being born again over but you see brother sister by the way you cannot dodge the new birth no matter how far along in the age we are just like you can't dodge justification you must be born the experience is the same as it's always been experienced i'm closing for tonight but brother branham from adam he addressed as he said my dear catholic friends he said you claim mary the mother of god [Music] acting like a drug she will see coming from evil that's what he said the second idea that's what the messenger said she had to act married which is the last stage the seventh he addresses the scripture where jesus is standing at the door knocking repeat trying to get back into his own church now brother sister you can never have the holy ghost moving in the church to the people foreign never have revival in the church it's got to start somewhere in the individual's heart gentiles standing outside of his own with pentecost here's what he says brother let's i've [Music] brother look that they did brother sister why would we take a substitute [Music] when we've got the real question he said my dear catholic friends my catholic friend catholic the virgin mary being the mother of jesus christ [Music] had to go up to pentecost and be filled with the holy ghost and she acted like a drunk she come in in person evil she was amongst 120. had the baptism of the holy ghost speaking in tongues and acting like a drunk woman coming from under the spirit of god and if the virgin mary had to do that in order to get into glory how are you i care what praise the lord as our dear pastor is coming i would ask that we would bow our heads close as the holy spirit is here the word of god has been preached and i know that he's spoken to your hearts tonight i just want to give a moment as the lord is speaking to our hearts to ask is there someone tonight the lord has spoken to your heart you know that you need this experience of this new birth [Music] [Music] [Music] we'd like as we go to prayer tonight now i've got a hand raised already god bless those hands yes lord oh it thrills my heart when i see young people god does not have grandchildren it just has fun no longer no matter how long we've been in the message it might have been raised in a message [Music] but the bible says have you got the holy ghost since you believed [Music] [Music] dear lamb of god lord yeah lord you see the humble hearts you've wanted to kill underneath these hands that humble heart that you spoke to tonight that you're [Music] of them unlatching the [Music] would [Music] lord would you bring the holy ghost [Music] with the baptism of the holy ghost who said this we ask this of you tonight each of these that have lifted their hands to be remembered [Music] amen [Music] is is [Music] every day foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] myself [Music] every day oh [Music] and i know the lord spoke [Music] one of the things that we want to be really careful in shows [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] take you to the next level [Music] and sin is nothing but unbelief [Music] when the lord blesses you with the holy ghost you can't just say oh i got it all it's a continual process it's a continual feeding say continuation until you reach that conference hallelujah but like the brother said tonight by way of the inspiration of the holy ghost it wasn't that he left us we [Music] all you got to do is turn the light down [Music] [Music] [Music] this is not only just the all of god [Music] oh lord [Music] [Music] god [Music] sacrifice [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] it's your commitment in a split second [Music] but [Music] so that if you don't get the fullness of the holy ghost [Music] in the past [Music] [Music] we lack [Music] and your word [Music] but we want to be on fire for you [Music] for your glory and all of the things you've done for us lord jesus christ let us not forget let us not forget where you brought us from due to this activity let us not forget [Music] be merciful to us tonight [Music] in your lovely name jesus christ [Music]
