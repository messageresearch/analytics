[Music] we're going to read to show the people that we don't have a Doctrine to baptize children foreign a baby I mean a child even if the child has four five six years you can still bring him to be dedicated to God the prophet would consecrate the children of all ages and not only the baby in Matthew chapter 19 verses verse 13 the Bible says verse 13 then little children were brought to him that he might put he might put his hand on them and pray but the disciples rebuked them foreign but Jesus said let the little children come to me and do not forbid them for for of such is the kingdom of heaven and he laid his hand on them and departed from there you will notice that he's spoken about the little children that were brought to to the Lord Jesus so if you've got a little child that has not been dedicated to God it's your jury to bring him to be dedicated to the Lord amen amen we can still sing that song bring them in [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] anybody beautiful baby's name is Ethan then we shall pray heavenly father almighty God you the Lord of lords and the King of Kings the baby is a turn eaten that you give in to the family of brother Gideon and sister Clarice if somebody because you say that the Kingdom of Heaven is for such little kids while the disciples were rebuking children you have taken them in your hands and blessed them Lord you've kept this baby in his mother's womb for nine months and you kept the baby while he was being born and this morning we're carrying him in our homes and with consecrating and to you so they can take care of him protect his life keep him away from all sicknesses and give him a good health so that the Jews May remain in the house of his parents bless his father and his mother and everything that they're doing while I'm surrounding all of them in their hands and I'm dedicating this baby unto you as a Good Shepherd in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen thank you Brian there's also uh Brian anniversary [Music] [Music] yes [Music] Lord Almighty God [Music] today's anniversary for Brian I pray lord to bless him that he give him a good health you may keep him again for this new year so that he may grow up in you because tomorrow there are those children gonna take over bless him and bless his father his parents in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen [Music] gracious heavenly father almighty God creator of Heaven and Earth foreign foreign saving you in this church you may give him Zeals and fear of God I surround him in their hands in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen ities may the Lord bless you all oh foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] so why are they fixing the sound so this uh today is my last day like I said last Sunday from tomorrow I'll be taking my flight to go back to Africa I also thank the pastor for the trust that they did unto me and also thank the brothers who invited me in their homes for the fellowship again today I'm litigating I just dedicated the baby of Gladys she's also the first generation of a Sunday School in my church foreign so you gotta pray for your church you go to church where there's more young people so they need the leadership not only young people but all of you you need somebody who's guiding you I know you got a pastor who's in Des Moines sometimes it's also busy but God is able to answer to this to the desires of your heart if only you can be serious with everything that you're doing you're gonna be on time at church that's the first thing the prophet is recommending the the questions he says Believers or Christians should be at a church 30 minutes before the opening of the service can you say Amen to that so you're going to be here exactly at 10 A.M while at 10 30 the song leader comes up here and the service says [Music] and the service may take up to three songs before the preaching because now we almost 12 a.m at 12. it's uh it's almost 12. okay we didn't even read the word of God yet a regular system in this issue with the shift with the system that you have here of working ships while the preaching you start looking at a time they are not the only shifts that you saw because there are those who have to work around um in the afternoon so all of that we've got to pay attention to that okay because when they talk about the church is two or three people they cook with the family but if there's already a change in which these couples families so just ask your trusty brother Valerie this is I never started the church with married people I was the only one married couple it down called Congo and the second married man his wife was still back in Congo all the brothers that I started church with they were just singles I understood getting them married one by one so today just looked the age of Crystal she's already a big girl to tell you that in five years or maybe 10 years if God still give us time all these children to be responsible and this is going to be a small hall for you so you got to work for the church and you gotta work in love and immunity so I'm going back tomorrow because I have a convention that I have to uh to lead on on the 15th President and I also need your prayers and all your support possible support you can do right Amen Let Us stand and read the word of God we shall read the same scriptures we read last Sunday but like don't believe that the number of people in the Book of Numbers Chapter 19. foreign foreign spoke to Moses and Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord is commanded saying speak to the children of Israel that they bring you a red heifer without blemish in which there is no defect and in which a yoke has never come you shall give it to elieza the priest [Music] that he may take outside they came and it shall be slaughtered
