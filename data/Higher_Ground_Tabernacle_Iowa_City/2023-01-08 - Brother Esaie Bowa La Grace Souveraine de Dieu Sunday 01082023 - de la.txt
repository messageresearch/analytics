TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Applause] you are what you are to his life those things are coming from the words that God has established that nature [Music] in first Samuel says Chapter 2 Verse 6 to 9. the Bible says the Lord kills if the Lord kills and make Leaves and get them out too let them know so the Lord he made people poor and met some rich he destroyed he he bring down some and raise someone so is God who's doing this by his own way in advance of your father for God to establish you don't worry to make him to make him sit with him and gave them sharing the Throne of Glory because to God and he is the one replace the world the Bible says he shall keep the step of his beloved ones but the wicked one shall be destroyed because if you are what you are this morning foreign [Applause] Ty of God [Music] my hair the help come from the Lord the one of man Heaven yes my brothers our help this morning comes from the Lord himself by his grace he's the one who's helping us he's the one who's leading ourselves that's the matter this morning not only this morning our steps this morning our steps this morning yes my brothers thank you Jesus Christ but I introduce you in the new year which is not a family that you used to be okay and in the family of the Lord Jesus Christ there's no failure in the family of the Lord Jesus Christ there's only success in the family of the Lord Jesus Christ we are in good health in Jesus family we don't have to put our hands on the cheek when you do this whom do you want to be uh sympathizing with you they are not your family in our family in this wire family [Applause] walking boldly because we are not slaves yes according to the uh to the instructions to be slave to the word of the to the things of the world but we're going to work we're gonna walk boldly sometimes feeling waiting for everything to do everything because our father in Heaven is able for everything I want you this morning that you understand the sovereign it's not because of your words I want you to take it out of your mind it's not because of your sacrifice but it's because of the love of God is because of the grace of God [Music] some Christian in the same situation some people were in the same situation so how come you came out of them how did you escape from those situations it's the grace of God it's a grace of God yes it's a grace of God the grace of God has made us what we are the grace of God has created Our Lives the grace of God and forgiven our sins the grace of God has given us marriage the grace of God it's giving us everything the grace of God has made us what we are today yes my brother sister that's why people you got something to be uh grateful to God the blood of an animal couldn't be perfect I want to say something so every day but I have to read what Brahman said here he said in the Lord paragraph 33 he says but the blood of Christ was perfect that's not where I am in the side of the Lord how much in the sight of God I'll never be perfect in my sight you will never be perfect let's put it aside how much more in the sight of God when I look at you man and see you as a human [Music] friend see you like your brother man God is looking looking at you through his son and sees you like you're redeemed foreign that's what is written the word of God but according to the Judgment of God he doesn't mean that we cannot do mistakes but God is prophesies or near anything like that to whom he wants to it's like you've never done it before remember but I compare about the problem you may have problem with you maybe you've hurt me you said you can ask him forgiveness and I can say I forgive you yeah and my mind every time I see this car I'll say this car is foreign and we don't have access to that for forgetting things that's why let me say it even in my language let us be nice to everyone let us avoid hearing each other yeah let us hurting each other for nothing just for little things of children let us let's put it aside kindergarten already just look when the children are playing in the garage all right this one is played with this toy just play together sometimes we are I don't know what to wear to you we're hearing that bill Christians are fighting for useless things they were telling me another story the the food we are very full there were two fools and one say to another okay as we go here if it happened that we found a hundred dollar somewhere okay see if we get that hundred dollars how much are you gonna take and how much am I gonna take Lindsay another one says no system if it's me who have seen it first I will take seventy dollars another one says [Music] they start fighting now people stop doing that stop fighting why are you fighting yes wait what's going on what's going on oh no we were telling each other if we see a hundred laying down if I'm the one to see it first even if he's the one who picked up and give me 30. that's what we're fighting for eign though that's children in the kindergarten there are things we don't even understanding what we're doing maybe we didn't get to understand we are in one family because God have raised your brother tomorrow is maybe to wait for your turn so why are we fine while we criticize each other because we want to have the same thing at the same time that's the cause of every description and what is destroying the church and that makes the church put it aside with my friends yes sir let's stop jealousy Among Us the church without the wrinkle or blemishes it's according to the Judgment of God himself but you keep on telling people and according to the Judgment of God God does not count that mistake again foreign basket s okay maybe you think it's about it's because of your Works no it's not because of your words everything that is in me bless the Lord forget all is good to me and it's him who's forgiving all my iniquities when you do something while you know that you shouldn't do it and God still forgiving that is fearful to forgive you about it not me beautiful pattern when you ask him for forgiveness he forgives the Lord is the one who heals all my sickness if God is with us yes his grace upon us and nothing can hurt us as long as the will of God is not yet fulfilled in our lives while we're going to the end what I'm saying no matter what you've done Journey God doesn't look at you he's looking and yes he has accepted the Lamborghini if God is accepted the Lamb of God which is the Lord Jesus accept us it means god is accepting us because it's not our problem we are the one we are not the one push ourselves I want to remind you that the scene was it the original plan of God God God is the one who made that decision if you came to see him that was according to the will of God according to the to the to the will of God so is God we have arranged all those things that's his problem yes I want to say something and I'm trying to see how I can say the grace of God today is a Prophet The Sovereign Grace of God today have raised William Brothers as a prophet of the end times he came with the word of God for this day to redeem the church to bring the church to its original position today is the greatest Prophet that God is raised by his grace God is send William Brothers that the name of Joshua means he was the Jehovah's Savior and I want to remind you again when he shared his blood he went in a holy place until they were still died in their sins and on the entire Earth why in other person there was nobody worried but when John was crying weeping he had a voice John never weep anymore because there the Lamb of God has overcome before the opening of the sales though this the blood has been shared by the national foreign so that the entire Humanity the humanity to be free completely Jehovah the Savior has to be manifested in the end time the same Jesus Christ my brother sisters that's a seven Grace that's rest William Brother foreign [Music] Jubilee that's the
