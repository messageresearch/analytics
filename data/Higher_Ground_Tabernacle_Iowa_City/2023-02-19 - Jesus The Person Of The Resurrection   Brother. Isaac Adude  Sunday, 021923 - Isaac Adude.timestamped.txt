[0:00] so Martha had to say Amen to that word
[0:03] that Jesus said
[0:05] amen so let's stop a little bit here
[0:09] we will see that Mary and Martha
[0:12] amen represented the sins that are still
[0:15] alive Representatives
[0:18] amen and Lazarus
[0:20] represented the sins that are asleep
[0:24] amen because if we go to first uh
[0:27] Thessalonians first Thessalonians uh uh
[0:30] chapter four
[0:34] um
[0:34] foreign
[0:53] hopefully I can find it
[0:57] all right uh verse 16 and 17 and 18.
[1:04] amen you notice that Martha and Mary
[1:07] represented the sins that are still
[1:09] alive
[1:13] and Lazarus was representing the sense
[1:16] that are asleep
[1:18] so first Thessalon first Thessalonians
[1:21] chapter 4 verse verse 16 Verse 18 the
[1:24] Bible says therefore the Lord himself
[1:25] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:28] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[1:31] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:34] shall rise first
[1:52] amen and then then we which are still
[1:56] our life and remain shall be caught up
[1:59] together with them
[2:02] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the
[2:04] air as sweet
[2:12] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[2:20] that's the type of Mary and Martha
[2:23] amen you have the living
[2:31] has to happen first before the Rapture
[2:34] resolution
[2:36] amen because the Rapture is only for the
[2:38] bride for the elected
[2:43] for for the elected ones
[2:46] amen so here you will see uh uh let's go
[2:50] back to uh John chapter 11 again
[2:55] amen verse verse 28 let's read verse 28
[2:59] when when Jesus you know talked to
[3:01] Martha and they had their conversation
[3:06] amen the Bible says that and when she
[3:08] had said when she had suicide
[3:12] she went her away
[3:17] and called Mary her sister secretly
[3:23] the master is come
[3:26] revenue and call USD
[3:29] amen so here Mary was not with Jesus
[3:35] and Jesus was not even in the room
[3:39] amen because Martha heard people talking
[3:42] about Jesus coming
[3:45] amen she didn't wait for Jesus to come
[3:47] in the in the room
[3:50] amen but she rose up and she went to
[3:52] meet Jesus
[3:54] she rose up she went to meet Jesus
[3:57] Christ
[3:58] amen because wherever Jesus was going
[4:02] amen vote noises were already
[4:08] people far off we'll hear about Jesus
[4:10] before himself
[4:13] even so Martha when Martha heard about
[4:16] Jesus coming
[4:18] amen she rose up to go meet Jesus
[4:23] said
[4:53] [Applause]
[5:01] whatsoever you will ask God God will
[5:04] give it to secretary
[5:06] amen and Jesus saw the faith that was in
[5:09] Mars
[5:10] and then he said that you know I am the
[5:12] resurrection and the life
[5:15] amen so now you have to understand that
[5:17] Martha before the resurrection Martha
[5:19] had first to meet Jesus
[5:25] to have to be to be in contact with
[5:28] Jesus Christ
[5:30] amen because Jesus is the person of the
[5:33] Resurrection
[5:34] before the resurrection happens you have
[5:37] to meet Jesus Christ
[5:41] Jesus Christ
[5:44] after meeting Jesus
[6:22] [Music]
[6:44] to comfort
[6:59] to support you to give you strength and
[7:02] all of that
[7:03] but where is Jesus Jesus that you call
[7:05] Jesus
[7:07] he's nowhere to be found when Lazarus
[7:10] was dead Jesus was not here to heal him
[7:20] and Mary was there in that environment
[7:23] amen so nothing could happen to her as
[7:26] long as
[7:29] so Martha after being in contact with
[7:31] Jesus
[7:33] Amen in other words she became the voice
[7:36] of the Resurrection
[7:39] because the Bible said that she wants
[7:41] secretly her way
[7:44] Amen to go call Mary
[7:46] amen he wasn't a public
[7:49] shows amen it wasn't something public
[7:53] she want in the secrets
[7:56] she was using the third pool
[7:59] amen because the first and the second
[8:01] pool was a public
[8:41] is coming
[8:46] the master is coming
[9:06] there's a quote that I want to read yes
[9:08] yeah here Martha became the voice of the
[9:12] Resurrection
[9:13] amen because Martha was representing
[9:16] also the bride representative amen
[9:18] because Jesus Christ was the word
[9:21] amen and you have to know that the bride
[9:23] is the voice
[9:27] amen that is used to call the bride
[9:31] the bride is the voice that is used to
[9:33] call the bride
[9:36] amen I know most of you are looking at
[9:39] me and saying brother I said what are
[9:40] you talking about regardless
[9:42] amen here's a quote
[9:45] it's found in uh laodicean Church in the
[9:48] church
[9:50] amen the prophet said that a momentary
[9:53] consideration of church history will
[9:55] prove how accurate this thought is but
[9:58] my consideration
[10:01] in the Dark Ages
[10:04] the word was almost entirely lost
[10:09] to the people
[10:13] but God sent Luther with the word
[10:18] the lutherans spoke the word spoke uh
[10:23] spoke for God at that time
[10:27] but they organized
[10:30] and again the pure word was lost for for
[10:34] organ uh the pure the pure word was lost
[10:38] for organization tends toward dogma and
[10:40] Creeds organization
[10:50] and not simple word
[10:53] they could no longer speak for God
[10:57] then God sent wesely
[11:00] and he was the voice with the word in
[11:04] his day
[11:07] the people who took his Revelation from
[11:10] God became the living Epistles red and
[11:13] none of us
[11:19] for their generation
[11:22] when the method is failed
[11:25] God raised up others
[11:29] and so it has gone on through the years
[11:32] until in this last day
[11:36] now listen what the prophet says
[11:40] there is again another people in the
[11:43] Land
[11:45] There is again another people in the
[11:47] land
[11:49] who under their messenger
[11:54] will be the final voice to the final age
[12:00] am I talking about the bride this last
[12:03] stage amen who under their messenger the
[12:07] Messenger
[12:09] will be the final voice of the final age
[12:16] amen he said that yes sir
[12:19] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[12:22] of God
[12:24] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[12:26] of God
[12:29] it is its own mouthpiece
[12:32] its own mouthpiece is
[12:36] so God is turning on her Allah
[12:40] he will confirm her it will confirm her
[12:43] through the prophet and the bride is
[12:50] for the voice of God will be in her
[12:53] pascara
[12:56] talking about the boy
[12:58] yes it is are we for it says in the last
[13:02] chapter of Revelation 17.
[13:06] the spirit and the bride yes
[13:10] say come
[13:12] a
[13:15] a elephant
[13:17] once more the world will hear direct
[13:20] from God as at Pentecost
[13:26] but of course that word will be reputed
[13:30] repudiated as in the first age
[13:40] amen so the bride is that voice
[13:44] except for that is used to call the
[13:47] bride congratulations
[13:58] she became their voice to go called Mary
[14:02] said foreign
[15:13] of translation foreign
[16:21] amen Jesus Christ had to go to them amen
[16:25] when they will meet him and have that
[16:27] personal relationship
[16:29] amen and then after that the Bible says
[16:31] that they appeared in many numbers
[16:34] amen all the works that they did two
[16:37] seconds amen was not able to raise them
[16:40] out out of the ground
[16:42] was not able to raise them out of the
[16:44] grounds everything
[16:48] there was back then
[16:51] but whoever there was back then two
[16:54] seconds they tell her amen was not able
[16:56] to give them that power to be
[16:58] resurrected Jesus
[17:03] Christ
[17:04] amen who is the person of the
[17:06] Resurrection
[17:07] in order for them to receive their
[17:10] Resurrection
[17:11] in order for their body to be changed
[17:15] Amen in order for the body to be
[17:17] transformed
[17:18] amen so that is the same thing with us
[17:21] Amen in order for you to be resurrected
[17:25] Amen in order for you to be counted
[17:27] among the few okay
[17:29] in order for you to be counted Among The
[17:31] Chosen Few Bobby uh
[17:35] you have to meet him personally
[17:38] I mean you have to meet him personally
[17:41] amen because Jesus didn't go to that
[17:44] house
[17:47] and call Mary yeah
[17:50] man he was in Jesus Jesus
[17:59] to say that the master is here and he's
[18:03] calling for you Amen in other words
[18:05] Martha became the fight for Ministry
[18:10] amen Martha became the father Ministry
[18:16] Amen to go give that good news
[18:21] amen that the master is here
[18:26] that Mary you have to go meet him
[18:30] before the resurrection happens you have
[18:33] to meet him personally
[18:36] here in verse 31.
[18:39] amen the Bible says that verse 31 of the
[18:42] same chapter
[18:44] the Bible says that
[18:46] uh now the verse 30 the Bible says that
[18:49] now Jesus was not yet come into the town
[18:52] but was in that place where Martha met
[18:55] him
[19:03] verse 31 the Jews then which were with
[19:06] her in that house
[19:09] and comforted her when they saw Mary
[19:13] that she rose up hastily
[19:16] and went out followed her saying she
[19:19] goeth unto the grave to whip there
[19:24] is
[19:36] so verse 32 the Bible said that then
[19:39] when Mary was come where Jesus was
[19:42] and saw him she fell down at his feet
[19:45] saying unto him Lord if thou has been
[19:48] here my brother had not died
[20:01] amen Mary had the same faith that Martha
[20:05] had married
[20:07] they said the same thing is
[20:11] Lord if you were here
[20:14] our brother will still be alive
[20:18] notice that Mary had to leave that room
[20:22] Mary had to leave that environment
[20:26] Mary had to leave that culture
[20:30] amen Mary had to leave their Church
[20:34] Mary had to leave for that because they
[20:37] were keeping her from going forward
[20:44] amen they were keeping her from going
[20:46] forward
[20:50] amen so if you find yourself in an
[20:52] environment
[20:54] amen the people are there they're
[20:57] keeping you from going forward with
[20:58] Christ
[21:14] [Music]
[21:45] [Music]
[21:57] as my sermon last night
[22:01] that he's the place where God put his
[22:05] name
[22:08] the only place to worship
[22:11] he says that you are not a Christian
[22:14] because you are Protestant you are you
[22:16] are Protestant
[22:19] you're not a Christian because you're
[22:21] Catholic
[22:23] Catholic you're not a Christian because
[22:25] you Methodist
[22:27] Methodist you're not a Christian because
[22:29] you baptism
[22:32] amen he said that you are a Christian
[22:34] because you've been baptized into Jesus
[22:37] Christ
[22:40] by the Holy Spirit
[22:43] not by water Papa Lou there is one Faith
[22:47] yeah in for one Lord yeah one baptism
[22:52] and said about them that's the Holy
[22:54] Spirit
[22:55] he says that what a baptism may only
[22:58] inducts you into a fellowship
[23:01] about ten percent this week you were
[23:03] found water but water baptism inducts
[23:06] you into a fellowship okay
[23:08] but the Holy Spirit baptism about ten
[23:12] percentage you into Christ
[23:15] there is the truth amen you're not a
[23:19] Christian because you call yourself a
[23:21] name
[23:23] you're not a Christian because you call
[23:25] yourself a message Believers
[23:29] you're not a Christian because you call
[23:31] yourself a Brandon Knight or whatever
[23:32] you choose
[23:34] you're not a Christian because you call
[23:37] yourself a Pentecost
[23:40] Christianity
[23:44] it's something that is supposed to be
[23:46] alive
[23:47] it's something that's supposed to be
[23:49] lived
[23:51] amen you have to be baptized into Jesus
[23:55] amen calling yourself names doesn't help
[23:59] amen remembering in Isaiah Think chapter
[24:02] 4.
[24:04] amen the Bible is talking about the five
[24:06] women who that was going to a man Allah
[24:12] thank you amen they went to a man they
[24:16] said that we just want to be called by
[24:18] your name uh it's a family
[24:20] or whatever that we're gonna do it
[24:23] doesn't matter to you man two seconds
[24:25] we just want to have your name
[24:28] so if we go smoke that's not your
[24:32] problems if we go drink that's not your
[24:35] problem
[24:35] we just want to become message Believers
[24:39] we just want to be able to fellowship
[24:41] with message
[24:44] to the word that's not your problem
[24:48] that is not Christianity
[24:51] amen it doesn't matter what name you
[24:54] choose to be called the vampire the
[24:55] second place amen that's not
[24:57] Christianity that will not help you at
[25:00] all
[25:58] he was divorced that Abraham heard
[26:26] [Music]
[27:01] foreign
[27:44] that voice that was with them
[27:47] amen they were able to do all those
[27:50] great things I've accepted foreign
[29:00] amen meaning that we have the same God
[29:03] inside of us
[29:04] amen because John said that greater is
[29:07] he that is in you
[29:09] amen then he that is in the world
[29:12] Amen greater is he that is in you so who
[29:16] is in you
[29:17] it's Jesus Christ
[29:19] remember it's the Son of God
[29:22] Amen it's the holy spirit in you so he's
[29:27] greater amen than he that is in the
[29:30] world Amen he's greater than the nature
[29:32] itself
[29:33] amen so he who was the flesh
[29:37] chairman was able to do all those great
[29:39] things amen meaning that now he's a
[29:42] nurse
[29:43] him in the Bible the prophet said that
[29:45] he became our flesh
[29:48] amen he took our flesh amen now he's
[29:52] being able to walk with our feet
[29:55] amen he can only touch with our hands
[29:58] he can only see with our eyes amen he
[30:02] can only talk with our mouth
[30:04] amen amen he is now Tabernacle in Us
[30:09] in other words the men and God has
[30:12] merged them as long as yes amen they
[30:15] have become one amen the bride is now
[30:19] the word
[30:21] the bread is now the word
[30:23] amen because the groom is the word
[30:26] amen and the Bible tells us that one
[30:29] plus one equals one
[30:31] so the bride has the same ability as the
[30:34] same natural as the girls and because
[30:38] the bride is called by his name
[30:41] amen the God has taken the name of the
[30:44] Grooms so the bride has become the world
[30:47] Amen now the bride is able to speak the
[30:50] words
[31:01] Amen to do all those great things
[31:04] because he has big she has become one
[31:06] with the girl
[31:08] even she has become one
[32:08] if the spirit
[33:09] becoming one
[34:07] the prophet says
[34:09] there are three things that's supposed
[34:11] to happen
[34:13] the first thing is a shout
[34:16] what is a shout
[34:18] it's a machine it's a messenger getting
[34:21] people ready
[34:29] getting them together
[34:32] we are here together
[34:37] you say it's a voice of the Resurrection
[34:40] it says that that same voice
[34:44] their loud voice set of War said in
[34:48] Saint John chapter 11 verse 33 verse 38
[34:51] to 44.
[34:55] Lazarus from the grace
[35:01] is getting the bride together
[35:05] and then the resurrection of the Dead
[35:23] and say it's a trumpet
[35:26] you have a voice you have a shout
[35:29] available
[35:31] now the third thing is a trumpet
[35:34] which always at the Feast of trumpets
[35:41] amen is calling the people to the feast
[35:47] and that I will be uh and and and
[35:51] that'll be the bright supper is
[35:57] supper with the bride in the sky
[36:02] see the first thing to come the first
[36:04] thing that comes forth is a message
[36:07] is his message
[36:10] calling the bride together
[36:13] the next thing is the resurrection of
[36:16] the sleeping bride last second
[36:19] the ones died
[36:22] back in back in the other ages
[36:30] they're caught up together is
[36:40] there why that's the thing that takes
[36:44] place
[36:46] amen it's the same thing that happened
[36:48] you know before Lazarus was was
[36:50] resurrected
[36:54] he meant they had to have a voice
[36:58] a man a voice calling
[37:01] getting the people ready
[37:03] and Martha became that voice
[37:07] Amen to go call Mary he meant to get her
[37:11] ready Mark that they said foreign
[37:46] amen with that Ministry
[37:49] amen calling Mary a mess of the American
[37:52] Experience the same thing that she has
[37:55] experienced very much
[37:57] experiment amen so it doesn't matter how
[38:00] good you can quote the prophet salallah
[38:05] it doesn't matter how good you can quote
[38:08] the Bible says
[38:10] amen you have to experience the same
[38:12] things
[38:16] if the prophet had to have the Holy
[38:18] Spirit
[38:20] you too you must have the holy spirit
[38:23] amen you have to have that same
[38:26] experience
[38:28] amen Martha Mary had to have that same
[38:31] experience than Martha Marie
[38:35] experience to meet Christ himself
[38:40] the Bible said that she went her way and
[38:42] she went and met Christ
[38:45] so if the prophet and where to have the
[38:47] Holy Spirit
[38:50] you must have the horses
[38:53] so being only calling yourself a message
[38:56] Believers
[38:58] doesn't automatically give you the Holy
[39:00] Spirit
[39:38] doesn't give you a Christianity it
[39:41] doesn't give you that that Christianity
[39:43] therefore don't pass it the Christian is
[39:46] my last quote before I close I read the
[39:48] prophet he says
[39:50] it says here we might belong to church
[39:54] we might be foreign people
[39:59] we might be a good character in the
[40:01] neighborhood
[40:07] a fine mother in Baltimore a fine son
[40:10] and Buffy's a fine daughter in bonfi but
[40:14] unless we are germanized with the spirit
[40:17] of God
[40:20] we will never rise in the resurrection
[40:26] it's finished
[40:28] you might be a good person
[40:30] with a good character I became more
[40:33] character everybody speaks
[40:35] this brother is a good brother
[40:39] look you give gifts to people
[40:42] donations to many things
[40:46] there is nothing wrong against it but he
[40:50] said that unless you are germatized with
[40:52] that Spirits
[40:55] you will never rise
[41:01] Paul said that in first Corinthians
[41:04] chapter 13.
[41:11] if I be able to speak all the tongues
[41:15] give all the prophecies but if I don't
[41:19] have the Charities
[41:23] amen and God is love so if I don't have
[41:27] God you all of that it's in vain amen he
[41:31] even went farther away to say that even
[41:33] if I'm able to give my body to me
[41:39] try to imagine you give your body to be
[41:42] burned
[41:44] sacrifice amen that's something that
[41:47] even me right now I don't think that
[41:48] I'll be able to do it
[41:50] memorization people Affair unless God
[41:53] helps me today amen but are you able to
[41:56] do that
[41:58] if you don't have God inside of it
[42:02] [Music]
[42:27] the resurrection happens to Abraham and
[42:30] all the others
[42:34] amen they had to meet Jesus Christ
[42:38] there is a resurrection there's a
[42:41] promise of Resurrection for us
[42:44] amen that we will be rise I mean the
[42:47] dead in Christ will rise again
[42:50] and those dead amen they have to mean
[42:53] Christ first it is
[43:03] word that promise of the Resurrection
[43:07] because the resurrection is not an event
[43:11] but it's a person
[43:14] amen and that person is Jesus Christ
[43:17] amen he is the king of kings
[43:20] he is the Prince of Peace
[43:28] man he's the one who was at the cross
[43:31] foreign
[44:27] he did all of that knock
[44:57] sick
[45:38] you call him with all sincerity you call
[45:41] him serious
[45:48] amen because he hears the sincere heart
[45:52] secures herself so just be honest with
