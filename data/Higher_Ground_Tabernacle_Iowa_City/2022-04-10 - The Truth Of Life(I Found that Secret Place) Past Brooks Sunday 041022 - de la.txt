visitors that are here [Music] because i believe and i know that he's here as we stand let us turn to saint john the 14th chapter peters turn with us to colossians 2 9. saint john 14 30. jesus is speaking and he says hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and have nothing in me [Music] illness a colossians 2 9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily i'm going to ask that you turn with us again back to four john 14. we'll read the 19th and the 20th verse there musa and it reads yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because i live ye shall live also that jesus had not gone to calvary yet okay and the day of pentecost had not yet arrived and he's talking to his disciples a disciple and he's implying hey man that they're not living yet in the funko but he's saying because i live ye shall live also see they were not quick into who he was they were not quickened who he was i security they were able to see john is they take up the voice now the 20th verse reads men on the verse at that day ye shall know that i am in my father see where he took him and ye [Music] him louis that's life let us pray heavenly father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you don't better to us send your tragedy to ourselves please there is no words to express me father give us grace this morning give us the ability to move completely to submit i like to entitle this message and if i was to have a secondary uh topic uh [Music] the bible tells us that many are called but few were chosen and everybody wants to live hey you find out that even in the scientific world they're trying to develop some kind of a medication that will make you live longer for long term but we realize that [Music] is [Music] right amen because the purpose of god it is what we have been ordained is that right you see we must be made we must be made out of the same material that he was made out of the same was in the beginning the thing that i love about jesus he had no darkness in him none of this cosmos or kingdom or candace [Music] jesus was saying and was talking and he said the prince of this world cometh and have nothing in me inaudible i love that shem seller because he said listen there's nothing in me that can be drawn by the devil [Music] [Music] are privileged i am so thankful and i don't have to worry about my salvation hallelujah amen is that right because the prophet of god tells us now there is only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time i'll offend it when there is nothing else can follow it hallelujah amen and now the air communicate world le monde community has set up such a regime that there could be no denomination [Music] she is ripening a she and she is ripening into christ like fruit bringing forth the shame bringing forth the same news mellowness and sweetness and the same spirit elements that he had in him and we y'all hallelujah and you have that truth on the inside because that truth lives hallelujah now let's go on continue we understand no comprehensive and he was manifested in jesus christ is that right and the bible tells us i read that jesus for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead hallelujah now this is a mystery man this is the thing that i love the most question please he said yet a little while and the world seated me no more elements but ye shall see me i don't know whether you see him [Music] [Applause] answer july you shall know that i am in the father in me and i and you and m listen equity i can't be in the devil's business amen you know when the word was opened in 1963 and god come down he began you know people still can't see it but the truth of the matter and he's changing her it is from glory to glory now you said well what do you mean brother brooks the prophet god always refers to abraham and sarah hallelujah amen and when god told abraham god begin to change her commands are chances hallelujah amen is that right and the prophet god likened isaac and the prophet to come exactly as unto the rapture hallelujah receiving the promised son hallelujah preach this whether you like it or not because you and i must understand why there is a mystery going on yeah [Music] is [Music] [Music] one of these days it won't be long look for me and i'll be gone hallelujah why because the christ that's in you basketball hallelujah let me tell you something about the intros it is called sita play the unstoppable and stop the unstoppable once the seed of god in fact is in you if so much so much and see he said it himself he that begun the good work okay i [Music] [Applause] jesus what does the new birth dude does for you let's get on the video hallelujah it takes you and from this third dimension the second must be brought to you to the sixth dimension hallelujah and one of these all day long we'll take a trip upon from this dimension to the seventh dimension amen we're not talking about a chair no sir we're talking about a place we're the authority of god we will be in you so much so you'll be hello amen that's the truth celebrity this is no little fairy tale that's in the past it's a reality reality we're on a journey here [Music] hallelujah what do you think brother brandon was talking about questions when he kept saying things he continued how he was [Music] he was the that's nothing but the world [Music] he did not come like we thought he would come in but he did come man but he interpreted his own words [Music] you see jesus christ jesus is not an extracurricular activity in a power of like [Music] i i even had one of my sisters say jesus i give god a part of my life no no no no god don't want a party and if you can't give him all he said you're in the wrong place hallelujah amen god don't want just your sunday service god just doesn't he doesn't want your wisdom [Music] you love the lord we always think about you know at the world say this is the life no no no no hallelujah of the real thing first john 5 11 says angel and this is the record psych 11 first john and this is the record [Music] that god had given to us eternal life and this life is in his you see because all that was in god basketball he poured it into christ and all that was in christ he poured it into his brother now when we were in the denominations in organizations in our relationship we just thought we was uh maybe a little toy of his no passion that he could pick up and put down because when you're born a son of god fisted you you're born an amateur god enjoy and the bible tells us that even jesus said after which the holy ghost has come upon you in sentences you shall receive power in that word power seed you could say to this mountain mountain be the move and that mountain must obey you hallelujah amen even before jesus ma'am jesus there's a man by the name of joshua yeah and no appellation hallelujah who was a true son of god is that right amen he was able to speak pierre jacques jean we're casting out devils he shall demon before they went to pentecost somebody helped me here amen before they got the holy ghost [Music] so let's move on i'll continue acts 17 and 28 act descent venturi acts 17 28 act of the set of entry let the word talk you believe amen 17 17 28 after the sentiment the word of god says according to the book of acts for in him we live and move and have our being y'all understand what that means that means our being security is not our existence not existence it's in him and and he goes on to say as certain also of your own prophets have said second oc for we are also his of spring amen hallelujah amen that means if a horse has an offspring it's a horse if a cow have an offspring hello amen if god says offspring cj emphasis it's not a man it's god say jew hallelujah amen that's why john simple question said that if you are born of god amen hallelujah amen don't say you got the holy ghost somebody help me y'all got quiet don't make god a liar because he's not living [Music] the holy ghost himself is an overcomer yes sir [Music] but you see so many people they are married to systems they're married to churches church system who or system does some people are baptists some are presbyterians catholics and some a message so many people even in this message has never had an experience with the almighty god [Music] but i'll say it to you as jesus said to nicodemus who was married to his sister he said you must give born again hallelujah can't be figured out by science on paper even your reasoning can't figure them out these ways to pass your ways and the only way to get to him humble yourself and allow god to see you a parameter as being nothing called just a quote coming from the exposition of the church ages [Music] we're making as the jews took refuge in the synagogue form of worship they were taking refuge in the church it is not joining a church that counts in the church the life is in christ this is the record that god has given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he has the son have life basketball and he hath not the son of god he refused that you have not lied let's say you can apologize man is made by the holy spirit it is a holy spirit had raised jesus from the dead that indwells us and makes us holy with his holiness entity there he stands the holy one and he will stand with him close excuse me and we will stand with him in his righteousness justice holy with his holiness now in the eyes of god oh you time is drawing let me pause and break this for a moment listen so we it meant that when the prophet god came he called the prophet which was the seventh age [Music] if he came at the ears somebody help me just so you know he said he's coming back did he did he escalated [Music] they was looking for this great jesus [Music] change right now let me ask you a question let's say one position who was there kia teller and who saw enoch translation hallelujah even and who was there a quieter when elijah took the chariot hallelujah amen somebody helped me here they were capacity and who was there when jesus christ ascended christian help me nobody but the church and nobody but the church or the bride will see him come back [Music] you might [Music] [Music] [Music] you cannot amen amen glory we stand perfect [Music] he became my sins [Music] pentecost can't teach you this [Music] they don't even know nothing about this they look at you like you're crazy hallelujah and the very day that jesus said i love jesus i am my father one they tried to kill him but what they didn't understand because they said to jesus we're trying we're going to stone you because you are being a man basketball make yourself god you're defensive but what they didn't understand because they had it backwards you see it wasn't the man being guarded it was justified the cry will go forth as he comes out and he which is filthy let him be filthy still okay he that is right let him be righteous still [Music] once you continue that i am in christ jesus christ with his wonderful attributes of righteousness imputed yes we imparted unto me imparted unto me you see why he gave it to me salah church i mean obviously i can't watch every step i made one video y'all understand what i'm saying we call it grace but we didn't know what grace was like you can't and i die like that i'm going to hell because what a lie no without the shedding of blood there is no remission all he sees is his blood two second voices of jesus christ the bible said we are accepted to me if because he was accepted i am accepted it is our responsibility to tell people about what god has done in this i looked and beheld the door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of trumpets sounding talking with me as a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show these things which must be here after appreciate it uh now let's move on and i'll continue because we need to understand that's kind of compound when a door was opened caller put it together there's only one door you have a king cell and that door is jesus christ hey sit back to say listen so that you can understand and let the king of glory come in and the question was asked like yesterday who is this king of glory hallelujah he said the lord there's only one lord my strong and mighty in battle what was it character his victory up those gates when you die the character of christ that is the only way the gate is going home that these they are two different separate times and so on two different and some different separate people and sunday under two different and so the shepherd covenants [Music] it's in the presence of the king hallelujah amen amen that's why the rapture is different oh come on now and we'll only be for the royal seed of abraham it cannot come by the natural elephant hallelujah [Music] do say he said i'm walking like enoch give me another comment i'm walking like inna is coming out of a testimony to this age god is more than able to bring his word it will have to be the royal seed of the word through abraham the royal seed that's why the rapture has to be first shown is that right amen now we know lucifer that the the the the church the ignis is being bundled or abandoned they're being bundled first all of the denominations coming into the air communication that is the mark of the beast hallelujah amen and they themselves amen will come to persecute the bride hallelujah but it's at that time god will translate her translating hallelujah glory to god look at you let me ask you a question when did the graves when were the graves open when jesus see but a lot of us believe the graves will open at easter egg hallelujah amen but the bible says when he died the graves were open somebody help me here yeah man now let me say it like this somebody has something how many people come here saw the saints walking on village surrounding thirty to four [Music] jesus help me glory to god lord you i have to be see it has to be the world now because remember we which are alive and remain prevent those [Music] when you quicken you got to have the divine nature of god you must have the same material but jesus christ had in him amen you have to whatever you take me through whatever you take me through amen because it is the shepherd that leads you and he knows the way he's leading you yeah in christ jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with god the bible said you must let [Music] [Music] so when he's preached that message i look at you by saying to us let us have see so that when the prince of this evil earth world con le president comes after you you can say satan has nothing in me they ain't i've being you see what we've failed to see is that the power of god comes to take away every speck of the world set with songs that's the truth right the word of god says if the love of the world is in you the love of god is not uh fine tuned it and he said if a spit of the world is in you the love of god is not a verse shows demons god with all of your heart to your own understanding but the joshua is faithful amen you just got to have faith this god is going to do what he promised you would have said [Music] stagger at the promises of god may as you say abraham see hallelujah don't stagger no never never i'm not sure is he going to do it no the bride wasn't staggering she wasn't let me hurry up with this because remember okay i read that and the rest of the dead lived not four thousand years huh that was part of that quote let me read the whole thing all the way over because remember shall not hinder prevent those which are asleep for the trump of god shall sound the dead in christ shall rise first we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with him them together and meet the lord in the air now a lot of people think oh we're going we're going to be floating and everybody going to see us along myself [Music] hallelujah is that right we know these are dimensional things dimension can you see the fourth thing that i mention radio wave television hallelujah the bible according to hebrew says we are encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses do you see the wickedness elijah was able to see the fiery chariots she could not see it okay what are we going to do they're much more them than us [Music] oh i can't see it but i know it's there man ma'am in the paper yes lord what we need to do is come up higher the second of the professor the more thinking like god things god is in principle brother said it like this he said jesus christ jesus had undisturbed faith whatever came his way whatever did come jesus's way he didn't he didn't get excited you know oh lord what are you gonna do no no faith no those disciples were panicking on the sea the disciples were dashing and tossing that boat like a bottle stopper gone [Music] and jesus said unto them oh ye of little faith oh fool where'd you go for hallelujah amen what was he saying you should have spoke the word whatever i said you should have stopped to see whatever you want to stop the song whatever it is [Music] they will not be heirs together you know in the vampires they will not be in the rapture together did y'all hear that let's give up there's absolutely a church natural yeah in english naturally and church spiritually illegally spiritually a church carnal in in israel that's spiritual elegance you didn't see here there's a judgment to the royal royal spiritual destinated excuse me there is no judgment there's no to the royal predestinated seed of abraham for they are predestinated to eternal life they have accepted the provided sacrifice sacrifice and that sacrifice is christ the word oh lord i don't know whether you're getting tired or not but i've got i got i got a i got a quote i got a read you love the lord yeah i got i i i could go home for power they have no idea that's the key to the rapture you know they can say this yeah that that's like that's like seeing moses and you didn't want to have nothing to do with moses [Music] amen amen i'm just going to say don't throw it in the pasta [Music] [Applause] right christ the mystery of god revealed now please tell me he says it goes right by them it goes right by them and they don't recognize it till it's gone it only picks up they said the process [Music] the same thing through in the days of moses days of elijah days of the prophets of the prophet days of jesus name down through [Music] this very the pregnant person with the seed of god la la persona ascendant [Music] and the world was alone manifest itself in this person to an individual that that wasn't the white one i wanted that was good though wasn't it hold on i'm coming i'm coming glory to god just look at you god is rich he's rich let me before i let me just settle down so god can give it to me [Music] he says now that is the revelation jesus christ is god he told his disciples he said i was that rock in the wilderness how was that water i was that brave you see what we don't understand second question god uses symbolism hallelujah to to express who experiments his will because sometimes it's too mighty for our minds to conceive they force [Music] oh it's nothing but the truth hallelujah amen he said no man of heart how hard you try to say prove that there are three gods it takes a revelation and in the name of the lord jesus christ and people say that's not important in the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen if you want to make a rapture bear with me here god is so good in me from my bone here it is god written mercy and when any believer comes to god he becomes god attribute of his word [Music] you had joshua and caleb hallelujah you understand me then you had another generation you had joshua and everybody that followed joshua was commissioned to work commissioner hallelujah and no respect to the prophet but this is your day this is the bride coming of jesus christ you must manifest jesus whatever manifestation [Music] same signs the same signs the same wonderful most let me let me let me finish this quote so i can let you guys i'll tell you what well i could just run right now yeah i still do it not for exercise either it's about the exercise you know that's me maybe you know i just kind of like it that way i'm glad it's amazing everybody's made different we were talking about this i'm so glad i made it like this there are things i don't like about myself i don't like the way i sound when i talk therefore i don't even like my singing no i don't you'll never catch me listening to the world books you really put it on the street you'll never see me no my gift wasn't for me it was for you lay down you all know it's true right everybody in here looks in the mirror sometimes therefore i wish it was better and then somebody else would come next and say oh you look so nice [Music] god was so merciful to moses [Music] then when he said they're here in exodus 19 4 there was the other men in the middle of the sea out there trying to impersonate and say on the but what he carried them on eagle's wings always liking the prophet to eagles hello and they followed moses hey john and that was the eagle wings hello that they they were following god he shriveled you as they followed moses commissioners [Music] they perish not with them who believe not secure [Music] hallelujah amen god wants us to follow his commandments the massage it's the eagle's wings of god [Music] it will carry you from earth you have an impression and most people missed it and he said i'll call you no more church education understand the second is a lot of those things that he could not interpret he having the shows time for it to be interpreted but he finished his work i never met the man william branham hallelujah amen brought the voice to the parliament hallelujah amen not the man's voice hallelujah amen i know jesus jesus his voice amen [Music] [Music] the brother was saying he would be preaching all over some thoughts whatsoever whatsoever you know how the message gets you and for some reason you knew that you know [Music] amen and i am there you know what i'm working on i'm trying and all i know to say is lord [Music] because i could never forget you think about your people i have written you on the palms of my hands hallelujah is that right amen even before jesus disciples were converted ma'am evangelion [Music] [Music] [Music] you compare word with words it was very difficult in the and i'm closing in the time of paul jeffery can you imagine how they felt is it this one paul says no more sacrifices all that we've been doing for thousands of years of no value anymore and when he got to circumcision you don't have to be circumcised paul took it to the spiritual realm that's the thing you were doing now a spiritual thing that god wants to show spirituality hallelujah amen only the elected could even my best buddy demons [Music] paul left off the scene when paul left off the scene god paul he looked like a failure in some player and defiance but paul did not see it born of a prophecy the devil was coming abroad could have been in a post-giving there was coming some group of people there was god [Music] for them to even believe that jesus was a messiah a man born after fornication you're saying that's jesus [Music] one thing about the bride of jesus christ she ain't she can't be scared put up put whatever scarecrow you want to put up but one thing about the bride of jesus christ is not afraid of truth [Music] because truth is delivered basket la verite la deliver the truth will set you free a man god is good jab on i love you lord for your mercy never fails me all of my days i've been kept in your hands for the moment that i wake up oh i will [Music] in all my life [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] you are closer like no other i know you as a father i know you as my dearest friend oh i've been blessed in the goodness [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the darkest night [Music] my best friend in the goodness [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you jesus

we'll take that heavily [Music] shall [Music] [Music] maybe there's here some uh somebody here this morning that desired prayer [Music] if you want to come up we'll be glad to pray for you [Music] we may differ in ways but i like to say uh this morning that jesus christ is the same yesterday [Music] yeah and that's the thing that people don't understand even when jesus christ came in his day ninety nine percent of the church world missed him [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] oh [Music] i gave myself away [Music] i gave myself away [Music] yes [Music] here i am [Music]
