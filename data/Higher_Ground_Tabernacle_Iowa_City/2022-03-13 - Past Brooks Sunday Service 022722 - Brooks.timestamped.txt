[0:11] himself
[0:12] and he swore by himself

[1:00] confession
[1:02] because when you can confess
[1:04] the blood covers you
[1:06] hallelujah
[1:08] and that's why god give those people
[1:11] give some the holy ghost
[1:14] because he knows
[1:17] they don't mean to do it okay
[1:19] they don't mean to do wrong you know
[1:22] and they surrender all to god
[1:50] who's gonna deliver me

[2:07] [Music]
[2:08] oh great where's your victory

[2:16] paul had the answer
[2:19] hallelujah
[2:20] he said thanks be to god
[2:23] who gives us the uh the liberty
[2:26] who's giving us the freedom
[2:28] hallelujah who gives us the victory
[2:32] through our lord jesus christ
[2:46] without jesus christ
[2:52] like david said
[2:54] he's my battle axe
[2:56] he is my battle axe
[3:01] that's what they say
[3:03] amen amen
[3:05] psalm 16.
[3:07] uh some says
[3:11] i know it's late
[3:14] some says oh i'm not even where nowhere
[3:16] i wanted to be but let's move on i'm
[3:17] almost done with this portion
[3:24] but when god came in 1963.
[3:30] on his nephew
[3:44] somebody had the thought
[3:47] that he did not come
[3:50] so i asked him then who was that in the
[3:53] revelation the third chapter
[3:56] is
[4:20] jesus came
[4:22] even when he
[4:23] you know in a way that they weren't
[4:25] expecting him to come
[4:47] he exposes himself he said explosively
[4:50] right and they still didn't know him
[4:53] hallelujah amen even when in the age of
[4:56] his thirties
[4:58] he said the works that i do
[5:00] i can't do these words
[5:03] the father
[5:05] hallelujah he said i didn't come in my
[5:07] own mind
[5:22] pharisees met him at a whale
[5:27] and said to him
[5:30] when the messiah comes
[5:33] he's going to have this gift of
[5:35] discernment
[5:49] accept this be the messiah somebody help
[5:52] me here man and when god came again a
[5:55] conscience just the son of man
[5:58] hallelujah
[6:00] they didn't recognize him
[6:03] because he came in a way
[6:11] [Music]
[6:14] you know always had
[6:15] trouble understanding the scriptures
[6:47] he's losing countries
[6:51] but that's true
[6:53] but in a different time
[6:55] yeah i understand
[6:57] he said in like man i'm coming
[7:03] [Music]
[7:14] the bible said there were two angels
[7:16] but that was moses and elijah
[7:19] hallelujah you said how do you know that
[7:22] because when he comes again
[7:25] to receive the jews
[7:27] hallelujah he comes with the host of
[7:30] heaven
[7:31] and moses and elijah is on the scene
[7:34] then
[7:35] hallelujah but when he came this day
[7:39] hallelujah he wore the clothing of a
[7:42] prophet
[7:55] he was a prophet
[7:58] and he was bailing
[8:00] the very seventh seal
[8:02] he was failing
[8:04] the seventh seal
[8:06] that's why god
[8:07] had him say
[8:09] that there would be
[8:24] he said how did i do that
[8:26] i knew better
[8:28] i know there'll be seven thousands
[8:31] in the days of elijah
[8:33] that did not bow hallelujah
[8:36] but what god was doing
[8:38] he was unveiling
[8:40] the seventh shield and at the same time
[8:44] he was veiling it
[8:46] he was feeling it
[8:48] to the skeptics
[8:50] to the intellectuals
[8:52] [Music]
[9:05] because he said my sheep
[9:07] hearing my voice
[9:09] and a stranger they will not follow
[9:14] hallelujah
[9:18] hallelujah glory
[9:20] hallelujah
[9:22] [Music]
[9:32] but this is this is
[9:35] [Applause]
[9:49] in my books hallelujah is that right
[9:52] brother branham said how about i'm lord
[9:54] look at billy graham
[9:56] look what he's got look at this lord
[9:58] look at all roberts
[10:00] hallelujah look what he's got they got
[10:02] two seconds and god said what business
[10:04] is that of yours
[10:06] hallelujah
[10:07] i am your portion
[10:10] somebody help me here
[10:12] the wealth of this world is not my
[10:14] portion the lord is my portion
[10:19] that's when he descended in 1963
[10:23] he opened my eyes he opened the eyes
[10:27] because the law
[10:29] is our portion
[10:30] that's what brother branham said
[10:33] he saw that cloud and he said that's my
[10:36] law
[10:38] and if it's his lord
[10:40] it's my
[10:40] [Music]
[10:43] lord glory
[10:46] amen amen
[10:48] hallelujah
[10:50] amen amen amen
[10:52] hallelujah
[10:54] correct amen
[10:57] you see
[11:15] because he said the dead in christ
[11:18] in reality amen there is no such thing
[11:21] in your intentions but you must catch
[11:24] the revelation
[11:25] of what paul is the second point is it
[11:28] though your relatives okay
[11:30] though their bodies
[11:32] though their bodies
[11:34] be in the grave
[11:37] they're not there in a supplement
[11:40] hallelujah
[11:41] you see because when brother branham
[11:44] saw those that were asleep
[11:47] they were not in the sixth dimension
[11:50] with pillars under their heads
[11:54] with pillows
[12:03] they weren't up there
[12:11] [Music]
[12:20] [Music]

[12:38] he said they were so real
[12:40] i can't tell you what kind of body that
[12:43] was
[12:44] but one thing i do know
[12:46] i could hug them
[12:48] and there was no sensation
[12:50] somebody help me here so you must
[12:53] understand
[12:54] he was giving us a vision
[12:57] fear death
[12:59] hallelujah
[13:00] he said death has been conquered
[13:03] somebody helped me here and death is
[13:05] just a wagon
[13:07] it's just a cut
[13:09] to pull us into the presence of a glove
[13:13] hallelujah
[13:14] that's why paul
[13:16] that's why paul
[13:18] was caught up
[13:21] [Music]
[13:28] [Music]
[13:30] [Applause]
[13:33] [Music]

[18:45] hallelujah
[18:46] we are commanded
[18:48] to love one another
[18:52] now that loving one another
[18:54] is
[19:35] judging each other
[19:45] the first thing you should do is examine
[19:47] yourself
[20:05] in the way of you going to hell
[20:14] no but every brother and sister
[20:17] knows that when they're wrong it's
[20:20] afghanistan
[20:21] countries unfortunately they must make
[20:23] it right
[20:26] some things are not easy to make right
[20:29] hello are we and sometimes the devil
[20:31] make you think oh i can hide
[20:46] i don't have to be a preacher like
[20:47] brother branham
[20:49] but god will bring me thoughts may jesus
[20:51] be going right to your heart
[20:54] if somebody talks to me
[20:56] comes with the only person to talk to me
[20:58] is something i look at you understand me
[21:00] don't
[21:14] i'm almost just my last scripture
[21:16] yesterday
[21:18] i get you beginning at the first verse
[21:21] as the heart
[21:22] painted for after the water brooks
[21:25] so panteth my soul after thee oh god
[21:38] for the living god
[21:40] when shall i come and appear before
[22:23] [Music]
[22:52] and the blood was on the doorpost
[22:56] application
[22:58] that angel did not
[23:00] say
[23:02] well i think that's blood oh
[23:05] yeah it's red
[23:11] [Music]
[23:48] and know that god will never give you a
[23:49] serpent it's a work if you're asking for
[23:52] bread of the lord
[23:54] but our biggest problem
[23:56] man
[23:57] we don't want to empty out
[24:01] we don't want to pray look
[24:16] somebody said how do you empty out come
[24:18] on this comes with i said you first
[24:19] addressed god in reverence
[24:24] i began to make all known confessions
[24:43] and cry out to god
[24:48] you make it right
[24:49] can you bring me your gift
[24:52] hallelujah and then you begin to cry out
[24:55] to god
[24:56] lord i don't have the patience
[25:13] in is
[25:14] and then if you can't see in the
[25:16] darkness
[25:17] you should ask god
[25:19] reveal the darkness in me
[25:21] if there's somewhere
[25:26] show me lord what it is
[25:29] then
[25:30] when god shows it to you allah
[25:43] [Music]
[25:52] something bring a change
[26:08] m
[26:12] [Music]
[26:31] because sometimes we're confessing
[26:32] things to god
[26:35] if i could be in a human way
[26:39] man
[26:40] and saying
[26:41] what are they talking about they've got
[26:42] my sacrifice
[26:43] because because you don't remember it
[26:47] in a human way
[26:49] you know men
[26:50] right
[26:51] like like for example we use the human
[26:53] term by example
[26:57] lord remember me
[27:01] when did god forget you contest
[27:06] hallelujah
[27:07] what are you asking god when you say
[27:09] lord remember me come for this gift
[27:11] you're saying lord let's say my dear
[27:13] things that you have promised to do in
[27:15] my life
[27:17] please perform them
[27:33] i'm almost done my tears have been my
[27:35] meat day and night
[27:37] while they continually say unto me where
[27:40] is thy god
[27:45] comedy
[27:49] when i remembered these things i poured
[27:51] out my soul in me for i had gone with
[27:55] the multitude i went with them to the
[27:57] house of god with the voice of joy and
[28:00] praise with the multitude that kept holy
[28:03] days
[28:05] why aren't they outcasts
[28:28] but my point is this in closing
[28:32] you know
[28:34] you when the joy of the lord is not
[28:36] there
[28:37] and you see everybody you go i go to
[28:40] church
[28:51] [Music]
[28:55] that means you have not
[29:24] oh i believe in a greater rapture
[29:27] but you know things must take place
[29:29] first spirits
[29:32] hallelujah amen oh my god oh my god my
[29:36] shoulders cast down within
[29:38] me therefore will i remember thee from
[29:41] the land of jordan
[29:44] let's just jump down let's just jump
[29:45] down to the seventh first that's the
[29:47] point i want to make
