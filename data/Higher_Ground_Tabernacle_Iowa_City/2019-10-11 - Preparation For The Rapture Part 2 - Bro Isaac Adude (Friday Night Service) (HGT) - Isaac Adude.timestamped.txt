[37:27] judgment with the other you know and
[37:31] they had those people had to be had to
[37:33] do certain thing it was only certain

[37:40] hooligan and then it was that time that
[37:44] I denied that they had to go out of it
[37:46] you told us it's no children and the
[37:49] Prophet said that God before sending a
[37:51] God in the time of Moses sent two or
[37:53] three things

[38:29] together talking was him so scale of a
[38:32] tendency was the message of Moses and in
[38:37] this last day in this last day that will
[38:39] ever know Sweetland on the King movie we
[38:41] found out that God also has sent us
[38:43] those three things that send us a
[38:47] prophet Judah saw an improvement even
[38:49] decayed his message with the pillar of
[38:51] fire in our confirming so Minister of

[40:13] profit I become a such key to Lucy and
[40:15] telling us what we have to do in duty so
[40:19] you know is did the Prophet reminded us

[40:43] lamb has been tested in radical annuity
[40:46] he told us that he told us that the
[40:49] blood has been shed in radical Toyota

[40:54] message is to apply the blood that was
[40:56] shed in only massage with a particular

[44:50] kun oh okay no divert oh yeah and then
[44:54] there to apply the blood hey Luke you
[44:57] lose Lucy you know where they work go
[44:59] where they left where the lamb was eaten
[45:02] the blood should be applied lovely so
[45:05] eighty it la nuit americaine and we said
[45:09] that you know it's it's like when we
[45:11] read the Word of God you can lean upon
[45:13] the tree you know when we meditate the
[45:15] Word of God
[45:16] comedy juniper only if we only read the
[45:18] Word of God just for the sake of the
[45:20] knowledge and hoping that the blood of
[45:27] Christ or the order the Holy Spirit will
[45:29] be implied applied in our souls
[45:34] that will not happen because the Bible
[45:38] says that you know you will apply the
[45:39] blood where the lamb will be eaten
[45:41] vascular
[45:44] Lola you show emotion you know where the
[45:46] lambie's is being eaten that's where the
[45:49] blood should be applied to the Tomasello

[46:27] condemn himself they didn't find
[46:32] anything any bad thing in him may know
[46:36] they didn't find anything that condemned
[46:39] him you know shows critic on the cross
[46:41] he was hauling vasculitis and I learned
[46:44] that the Lamb who was Jesus cross was
[46:46] checked he said he was kept because the
[46:51] Bible says that Jesus Christ was taken
[46:54] and he came out just after the
[46:56] resurrection
[46:57] reliability Christa a deeply religious
[47:01] television at you yeah it was kept you
[47:04] did take out this and then he was killed
[47:07] they are pretty true that day on Calvary

[53:42] know the the Lamb that was killed in the
[53:45] Old Testament was the the type of Jesus
[53:47] Christ the Liberal Party sister
[53:51] Jacqueline knew kitty emolia on

[54:44] died one time to bear the sin of every
[54:51] man you know to take the sin of the
[54:56] entire world of them that believed him
[55:01] the circular quoi you know of them that
[55:04] believed Jesus Sookie kwanghee's Ruth
[55:06] and that does the purpose that Jesus
[55:09] died and then they had to apply the
[55:12] blood but before applying the blood they
[55:16] had to make sure about one thing you
[55:18] know they had to take the leaven out of
[55:21] the day they are their house 11 Dunamis
[55:30] or you know they had to take the leaven
[55:32] out of their house because the barbers
[55:35] tell them that to keep that there for
[55:37] seven days that level should not be in
[55:40] the house and the leaven represents sin
[55:48] and for seven days they could they did a
[55:51] heavy and the prophet said that
[55:55] this seven days means the seven Church
[55:57] ages throughout the street who travel

[56:22] something that is not sincere and
[56:27] sincerity is something really important
[56:29] for God even the Prophet for him to to
[56:34] to to to to to to to stand against the
[56:38] devil or to bind the serpent he had to
[56:41] be sincere man full of faith for 20 of
[56:43] the early when we are something new god
[56:48] we have to be sincere and now the Bible
[56:53] is saying that sincerity was to be kept
[56:56] throughout the seven churches and now we
[57:03] saw that when their windows that the
[57:05] first churches that are from the first

[1:12:33] K Co Co Co Co cool is this a normal man
[1:12:36] loo loo traffic's a fair movie and the
[1:12:38] same thing that we let the children
[1:12:40] order our little brothers doing or
[1:12:42] watching you know we give them the free
[1:12:50] way of choosing their own stuff for
[1:12:52] watching you know watching those
[1:12:58] cartoons like I didn't see any men you
[1:13:01] know which were we parents we don't even

[1:13:06] person and what they are showing in 6 a
[1:13:09] mood matter of fact if you ask them you
[1:13:11] know can we watch the story of Jesus
[1:13:14] most of them will say no

[1:13:26] get to their mind who was a Pascal a job
[1:13:29] you know he's gonna kill them you know
[1:13:34] as there's little issue and I kill them
[1:13:37] knowing that when they're growing up so
[1:13:40] quickly becoming so to the good you know
