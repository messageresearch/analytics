[37:25] amen
[37:30] amen but let's uh go to uh luke uh
[37:33] chapter two verse forty
[37:46] if i were to entitle it it would be the
[37:48] secret of the message
[37:53] amen and i believe that
[37:55] we have the greatest thing on earth amen
[37:58] which is the revelation of god's word
[38:20] now his parents went to jerusalem every
[38:22] year at the feast of the passover
[38:27] and when he was 12 years old and they
[38:29] went up to jerusalem after their custom
[38:31] of the feast
[38:35] and when they had fulfilled the days as
[38:37] they returned the child jesus carried
[38:39] behind in jerusalem and joseph his
[38:41] mother knew not of it
[38:49] but they supposing him to have been in
[38:52] the company when a day's journey and
[38:54] they sought him among their kinsmen and
[38:56] acquaintances
[39:06] and when they found him not they turned
[39:08] again back uh turned back again to
[39:10] jerusalem seeking him
[39:16] and it came to pass that after three
[39:17] days they found him in the temple
[39:19] sitting in the midst of the doctors both
[39:21] hearing them and asking them questions
[39:29] and all that hurt him were stein is at
[39:31] his understanding in answers
[39:37] and when they saw him they were amazed
[39:39] and his mother said unto him
[39:41] son why hast thou
[39:43] thus dealt with us behold thy father and
[39:46] i have sought thee sorry
[39:57] and he said unto them how is it that ye
[39:58] sought me wished ye not that i must be
[40:01] about my father's business
[40:06] and they understood not the saying which
[40:08] he spake unto them
[40:13] and he went down with them and came to
[40:14] nazareth and was subject unto them but
[40:17] his mother kept all these sayings in her
[40:19] heart we descended
[40:37] amen so
[40:38] we see in the scripture that jesus being
[40:40] about 12 years old
[40:44] and the word being young i want to read
[40:46] a quote to you
[40:50] amen
[40:53] uh the and this is brother brown i'm in
[40:55] in the uh message the seed does not air
[40:57] with the shock and this is where i got
[40:58] the title of the message
[41:01] the word yet being young spake for
[41:03] itself and know not that i must be about
[41:06] my father's business
[41:13] the message is the secret message
[41:34] there is the secret of the message now
[41:37] the security message just exactly the
[41:39] father's business what's the father's
[41:41] business exactly
[41:46] could you think of what the father's
[41:47] business was in him
[41:52] to fulfill what isaiah said a virgin
[41:54] shall conceive
[41:58] fulfill what isaiah said again the lame
[42:00] shall leap like a heart
[42:10] right here
[42:11] that's where it was
[42:13] the lamb the lame shall leap like a
[42:15] heart and all these things would take
[42:16] place
[42:18] like like moses like moses said the lord
[42:21] your god shall raise up a prophet among
[42:23] you
[42:27] it was the father's business to fulfill
[42:30] that word
[42:33] amen so the the secret of the message in
[42:36] jesus day was to fulfill the scripture
[42:38] that pertained to him so the security
[42:40] message projected are completely
[42:42] critically
[42:44] and see what the prophet would say it
[42:45] was a secret secular prophet
[42:48] but yet he was fulfilling that secret
[42:52] it wasn't a secret to him
[42:55] he understood the father's business
[42:58] this is affirmative he didn't come to
[43:00] church playing games
[43:02] he understood the scriptures
[43:08] and he had a wisdom and an understanding
[43:09] that he had the authority to complete
[43:12] and manifest that word
[43:17] and they behooved him to sanctify
[43:19] himself
[43:24] that he will be able to come and
[43:25] manifest that word to us
[43:29] that jesus had a testimony that he
[43:31] always did will please the father
[43:38] amen so therefore we can have that same
[43:40] testimony
[43:43] and everything that we do we can please
[43:44] god amen
[43:48] because i'm about my father's business
[43:51] i'm not about myself i mean i'm not
[43:54] about my my friends or the world but i'm
[43:56] about the father's business
[44:01] and the prophet of god would say at that
[44:03] time their word was young
[44:20] because those are the
[44:36] amen that we must have a a desire and a
[44:39] passion to fulfill god's word
[44:46] amen jesus had a lot of passion
[44:50] in the book of acts it said that
[44:52] his passion was before him in acts
[44:54] chapter 1 verse 3.
[45:00] amen the bible says to whom he also
[45:02] showed himself alive after his passion
[45:04] by million many infallible proofs
[45:08] one three acts one three
[45:10] uh
[45:11] act uh antoine appreciate
[45:14] it
[45:16] amen so we recognize that jesus had a
[45:18] desire
[45:21] it was his passion he made it his life's
[45:23] work
[45:26] so what's your business
[45:29] what is your passion
[46:11] [Applause]
[47:21] [Applause]
[48:00] but his life is now coming to me
[48:04] take away all my
[48:18] and the things that control us amen
[48:22] amen to take away our flesh your desires
[48:25] and bring him to subjection to the word
[48:32] first john 2 16.
[48:35] because we have desires
[48:38] wrestle against the word
[48:40] we have desires as men to that wrestles
[48:43] against the spirit
[48:45] combat uh don't
[48:56] love not the world neither the things
[48:57] that are in the world if any man love
[48:59] the world the love of the father is not
[49:01] in him
[49:03] john do says
[49:12] for all that is in the world the lust of
[49:14] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[49:16] lust and the pride of life it's not of
[49:18] the father but it is of the world
[49:27] [Music]
[49:30] and the world passeth away in the lust
[49:32] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[49:34] god about us forever
[49:41] so we have the lust of the flesh we have
[49:43] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[49:45] life
[49:49] and they come to take away from the
[49:51] father's business
[49:55] it comes to take away my attention and
[49:56] devotion
[50:00] it comes
[50:02] it comes to distract us from our purpose
[50:06] young man of god
[50:08] amen who who know the truth and hold it
[50:10] in righteousness
[50:15] amen that the world amen will try to
[50:17] pervert you and to take away your
[50:19] god-given rights
[50:25] amen and jesus had said i give you the
[50:27] mysteries of the bible for is given unto
[50:29] is given unto you to know the mysteries
[50:31] of the word
[50:43] amen amen amen
[50:45] praise the lord
[50:46] has given unto us to know the mysteries
[50:51] we may walk as sons of god
[50:55] to become the bride of christ
[50:58] to be made aware of these things
[51:01] that we know we now we know that wrestle
[51:03] against flesh and blood
[51:16] so jesus wants to give us the keys to
[51:18] the business
[51:20] this
[51:24] amen amen let's turn to uh uh
[51:28] genesis
[51:29] because we are the children of abraham
[51:33] and the in the message uh the
[51:37] abraham's grace covenant
[51:42] let's turn to genesis 18.
[51:46] now we are children of abraham by faith
[51:56] and we can honestly say that abraham's
[51:57] life would depict the life of the
[51:59] believer today
[52:07] abraham the 18th chapter uh let's verse
[52:10] 16 18 verse 16.
[52:12] this
[52:12] uh says
[52:14] and the man rose up from thence and
[52:16] looked toward sodom and abraham went
[52:18] with them to bring them on the way
[52:22] regardless
[52:26] and the lord says shall i hide from
[52:28] abraham that thing which i do hello
[52:33] so god is going to reveal to abraham his
[52:35] his plans
[52:38] seeing that abraham shall surely now
[52:40] listen this is what god knew
[52:43] saying that abraham shall surely become
[52:46] a great and mighty nation
[52:51] and all the nations of the earth shall
[52:53] be blessed in him
[52:57] for i know him that he will command his
[53:01] children and his household after him
[53:06] they shall keep the way of the lord to
[53:08] do justice and judgment
[53:13] that the lord may bring upon abraham
[53:15] that which he hath spoken of him
[53:21] so god had already promised abraham
[53:23] these things because god by
[53:25] predestination knew abraham
[54:07] [Applause]
[54:20] that's why god gave us this message
[54:38] amen
[54:39] in the 13th chapter god called out
[54:41] abraham
[54:44] and then that was a type of his
[54:45] justification
[54:48] in genesis 15 it was a type of abraham
[54:51] sanctification
[54:56] amen and in genesis 17 it was the type
[54:59] of abraham receiving the holy ghost
[55:06] now today the justification and
[55:07] sanctification is not the holy ghost
[55:10] justification
[55:13] it's the work of the holy ghost
[55:16] but it takes an infillion of the holy
[55:17] ghost
[55:27] [Music]
[55:32] our very best is all but vanity uh
[55:38] our very best our
[55:41] the best we can do um
[56:15] all scripture must be fulfilled
[56:19] abraham had prophecies in scripture that
[56:22] pertain to him
[56:26] and god will reveal abraham his secret
[56:31] in you
[56:33] and you
[56:34] will i establish my son
[56:37] in you when i speak the word
[56:41] my life
[57:24] but it tells you to go a little further
[57:28] where are we going
[57:30] we're going to canada
[57:31] that's the holy ghost
[57:34] but you can't stop there
[57:37] if you want the holy ghost you could
[57:38] have went back
[57:48] [Applause]
[58:04] [Applause]
[58:07] has an inheritance
[58:09] but assad also has a tutor
[58:13] amen a servant a son doesn't have amen
[58:16] is that a servant
[58:19] um
[58:36] [Applause]
[59:02] clay
[59:04] and put you on the word
[59:07] [Applause]
[59:09] a revelation
[59:11] of who jesus is the gishes you ate i see
[59:14] that picture
[59:15] i see god
[59:44] don't miss your experience with the
[59:46] living god
[59:49] i thank god for our prophet
[59:52] but i got a greater witness than the
[59:54] prophet muhammad
[59:57] hallelujah amen
[59:58] his spirit bears witness with my spirit
[1:00:03] that we now are the sons of god
[1:00:07] man didn't give it to me
[1:00:09] you can't take it from me
[1:00:12] baby
[1:01:11] [Applause]
[1:01:32] amen amen praise god
[1:01:36] for god still
[1:01:49] if you ever experience
[1:02:18] was with wasn't her husband
[1:02:22] the one she was with wasn't her husband
[1:02:27] but he still came to her
[1:02:30] they wouldn't be calling adultery
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:50] jesus still came to the lowly
[1:02:52] he came to the lost jesus came to the
[1:02:54] lord
[1:02:55] he came to the broken in the in the
[1:02:57] loneling he lived in new zealand he said
[1:02:59] this day this scripture
[1:03:01] [Applause]
[1:03:20] [Applause]
[1:03:33] [Applause]
[1:03:54] knew me before the foundation of the
[1:03:56] world
[1:04:04] [Applause]
[1:04:10] uh
[1:04:18] [Applause]
[1:04:25] the love of god that we can become the
[1:04:28] sons of god
[1:04:35] abraham had uh the scripture or
[1:04:38] abraham had prophecy regarding him
[1:04:43] the lord said i should do this and i
[1:04:45] should i should do this
[1:04:50] matter of fact he said i've already done
[1:04:52] it usually
[1:04:55] so we recognize that god had already
[1:04:58] established his covenant with uh with
[1:05:00] abraham
[1:05:03] so the prophet of god in genesis 17 he
