[39:12] all the adoration and all the glory
[39:15] because you're so deserving or die
[39:18] commit myself to you or may your Holy
[39:23] Spirit provide strength to the body
[39:25] anoint the ears to hear and on the words
[39:29] that come forth they bless and edify
[39:32] your people in Jesus Christ's name
[39:34] hey man praise the Lord Thank You
[39:37] musicians hallelujah well I'm happy to
[39:45] be here
[39:46] praise the Lord let's turn in our Bibles
[39:49] we'll just read the same scriptures I've
[39:54] developed the phrase here lately as a
[39:56] launching pad because sometimes I don't
[39:59] know where I'm going but he knows amen
[40:04] amen
[40:11] they got the sound turned up for me
[40:14] that's good I can not have to make such
[40:16] an effort appreciate that he may we're
[40:19] reading out of 2nd Timothy 1:7 in Luke
[40:23] chapter 8 we can start with Luke chapter
[40:24] 8 verse 49 it says well he had spake
[40:31] there cometh one from the ruler of the
[40:33] synagogue's house saying to him my
[40:36] daughter is dead trouble not the master
[40:38] but when Jesus heard it he answered him
[40:40] saying fear not believe only she shall
[40:44] be made whole 2nd Timothy 1:7 says for
[40:50] God have not given us the spirit of fear
[40:51] but of power and of love and of sound
[40:57] mind
[40:58] you know therefore ashamed of the
[41:01] testimony of our Lord nor of me as
[41:04] prisoner but be thou partaker of the
[41:06] afflictions of the Gospel according to
[41:08] the power of God Heavenly Father we ask
[41:11] your blessings upon the reading of the
[41:13] word a man you may be seated a man just
[41:20] to continue on we've been speaking on
[41:22] fear not believe only or fear not only
[41:25] believe and as we've just dealt with
[41:30] this thought we've read the quote where
[41:32] brother Branham says that fear makes you
[41:34] weary and fear makes you wonder and
[41:37] certainly as we live this Christian life
[41:42] and we give our hearts to the Lord I
[41:46] mean
[41:47] of us come from different backgrounds
[41:48] different cultures many of us have come
[41:51] from different places in the world and
[41:53] different family structures and
[41:56] certainly the enemy would have a lot to
[41:58] draw from you know he certainly knows
[42:00] how to attack your mind and in such a
[42:04] way make you feel hopeless make you feel
[42:07] condemned he's good at that
[42:11] he's an accuser of the Brethren but what
[42:14] I love about the Word of God when you
[42:15] catch a true revelation of what Jesus
[42:18] Christ has done for you and what true
[42:20] justification means it means you never
[42:22] did it in the first place once you come
[42:25] to Jesus once you ask the Lord to
[42:28] forgive you and you have a repent of
[42:30] heart all the people around you might
[42:32] try to hold you accountable they might
[42:34] want to they might want to judge you
[42:36] other this Saint might want to accuse
[42:39] you but when you try to come back to God
[42:42] again so many times we do that over and
[42:44] over and over we we come to the Lord and
[42:49] say O Lord once again forgive me Lord
[42:52] and I did this this this of this and we
[42:56] know what would the Lord say to you what
[42:57] are you talking about what's in it was
[43:01] gone the very minute you confessed it
[43:03] and that's if you could only realize the
[43:06] victory in that you know it understand
[43:10] how powerful that really is how powerful
[43:14] the grace of God is how powerful is love
[43:17] is is that when you repent your sins and
[43:20] when you have a remorseful heart and you
[43:22] turn from the lifestyle that you're once
[43:24] living right God's power to forgive you
[43:29] and the power of his love and the power
[43:31] of His Holy Spirit oh my you're free
[43:34] from all of that now you can lay it down
[43:37] you know the scripture talks about an
[43:39] eleventh-hour worker right
[43:43] uh-uh uh-uh you know you just if
[43:46] somebody starts serving the Lord today
[43:47] Oh
[43:48] oh my just because you've been out of 20
[43:50] 30 years you ain't no more special no
[43:53] sir
[43:54] there ain't no big eyes our little use
[43:56] in the kingdom of God Oh
[43:58] one comes home our God rejoices you
[44:01] think of the story of the prodigal son
[44:02] oh my the other sons were like what
[44:05] about me I've been here I've never left
[44:06] Oman but we all should rejoice when we
[44:09] see somebody giving their heart to God
[44:11] we should be so happy and so thankful
[44:13] that's the love of God being shed abroad
[44:16] in your height how about when we see God
[44:18] blessing somebody that's new amongst us
[44:20] we see God maybe giving him a position
[44:22] in the church whenever I even started
[44:25] leaving songs I've been here the whole
[44:26] time and he's never asked me oh come on
[44:29] now well we all want position we're all
[44:33] like titles and we all want experience
[44:35] but I just want to know Jesus
[44:38] let me know Jesus had been crucified let
[44:41] me know it's no man it's Drazen is
[44:42] forgiveness well that's all I need to
[44:45] know I know the Holy Spirit moving in my
[44:47] life I don't need no position I don't
[44:50] need to be elevating a man's ideas and
[44:52] then starts and what man think is great
[44:55] oh let me just be one of those and his
[44:57] kingdom let's experience the love and
[44:59] grace of God and His forgiveness
[45:00] oh my you can't help it it's like a
[45:02] house on fire you just got to tell
[45:04] everybody that Jesus Christ is alive
[45:07] oh my drives away the fear so when that
[45:13] devil comes around running this mouth
[45:15] again trying to remind you of all your
[45:17] past and all your failures and some of
[45:20] us make hard decisions and hard choices
[45:22] and we can't just run away from it we
[45:26] got to face it the next day but don't
[45:29] let don't let that circumstance or that
[45:32] trial that you have to face robbed you
[45:34] from the joy of your salvation look at
[45:37] what David said David said Lord restore
[45:40] unto me the joy of my salvation he
[45:44] didn't lose his salvation you can't lose
[45:47] your salvation but he said restore unto
[45:50] me the joy of my salvation oh don't you
[45:53] understand you're eternally secure in
[45:56] Jesus Christ
[45:58] now let me ask you something were you
[46:01] more eternally secure when you're in the
[46:03] world are you more eternally secure now
[46:04] than then are you want to secure
[46:07] eternally secured today than you were
[46:09] five years now you ain't a nanny is
[46:12] eternity eternal Z Tournament you were
[46:15] always in the mind of God
[46:16] you are always eternally secure and God
[46:20] before I ever formed this world sit on I
[46:23] know my thoughts that I think toward you
[46:24] force to bring you to it expecting in
[46:27] you don't have to worry about how you're
[46:29] gonna end it all up I'm gonna do it for
[46:31] you and our job is just to trust him and
[46:34] believe him and to know that Romans 8:28
[46:36] says I will work all things out did
[46:40] somebody say all things he didn't just
[46:43] say well I'll try to alert some of them
[46:45] out well you kind of got out here on a
[46:48] limb and I can't fix that for you no sir
[46:50] he said to them that love God and are
[46:54] called according to his purpose and if
[46:56] you've ever had to see it as God on the
[46:58] inside a that's responded to the Lord I
[46:59] want to say he's talking to you
[47:02] hallelujah
[47:03] oh you've heard it said before others
[47:05] that we got TV waves and radio waves
[47:08] coming through you right now you can't
[47:10] hear it you can't see it but if you get
[47:13] that little special crystal that little
[47:15] special tuner in here
[47:16] oh all of a sudden you can start picking
[47:18] up the radio you can start picking up
[47:21] the TV signals only you understand
[47:23] that's what that predestinated seat of
[47:25] God inside of you is it's a special
[47:28] crystal it's an expression ability that
[47:31] when the word goes forth no matter what
[47:33] condition you're in something of satis
[47:35] says lord I believe it I believe it oh
[47:38] that's that predestinated seat of God
[47:40] inside of you that deep call into a deep
[47:43] and praised God there's a deep to
[47:45] respond oh so don't let that fear attack
[47:50] you because fear makes you weary fear
[47:54] makes you wonder
[47:55] and that word weary when it says fear
[47:58] makes you weary
[47:59] maybe we shouldn't look past that too
[48:01] much because we're still stuck in this
[48:03] bag of bones and I don't know if
[48:06] anybody's ever battled pain where you
[48:08] battered hard circumstances but when you
[48:11] weary in your body starts to affect your
[48:13] mind oh you can become so mentally
[48:17] fatigued you start to even question your
[48:20] own judgment you start to even wonder
[48:22] are you starting to wonder if you can
[48:24] even make it oh you get so tired and and
[48:28] you just don't even know what you're
[48:29] gonna do and you feel like you're gonna
[48:30] slap any moment you just feel like you
[48:32] can't take one more step if you're like
[48:34] oh god what's happened to me oh and fear
[48:38] will make you weary are the trials and
[48:41] tribulations of this world that we go
[48:42] through we'll make you weary oh but
[48:45] thank God
[48:46] our strength comes from Jesus Christ
[48:48] thank God we can call upon him I thank
[48:52] God were eternally secure met people who
[48:54] like that word eternally secure but you
[48:58] know I mean if if you were in the mind
[49:00] of God before the world ever was formed
[49:02] if you came from God and you can't go
[49:05] back to God if your name was on the
[49:07] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[49:10] foundation of the world it's all over
[49:14] it's finished Jesus Christ just come to
[49:17] pay the price to redeem you so that when
[49:21] you came to yourself the debts would all
[49:23] be cleaner they would all be stricken
[49:25] off like the prophecy says go ahead and
[49:27] write out the check what do you need
[49:29] tell god what you need tonight you need
[49:32] salvation you need healing you need a
[49:35] sound mind you need power or whatever it
[49:38] is it's right here available for you
[49:39] tonight
[49:42] the prophet of God says on the church
[49:44] age book
[49:49] fear not don't be afraid I am the first
[49:53] and the last I'm he that liveth and was
[49:56] dead and behold I am Alive for evermore
[49:58] what is there to fear the judgment that
[50:02] fell upon him at the cross take this to
[50:05] heart now the judgment that fell upon
[50:08] him at the cross at the grave and when
[50:11] he descended was for us put your name
[50:16] there Mike we talked about this morning
[50:19] about that young kid in the back the
[50:21] Holy Spirit moved upon him and all he
[50:23] just reached up his arms and
[50:25] and he said oh it's not a story any more
[50:27] hearts it's real it's really real Oh
[50:30] hallelujah he did that for you he know
[50:35] where you would be at he absorbed the
[50:38] full brunt of the wound of sin and there
[50:41] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[50:46] which are in Christ Jesus you know we're
[50:49] the ones that try to condemn people we
[50:51] try to judge them we see people come
[50:54] amongst our ranks and and and they start
[50:56] to serve the Lord and maybe they've been
[50:58] with us a little bit and you're like man
[50:59] you know I you know I think this is the
[51:02] way ought to be you don't know what
[51:03] they're going through but maybe we can
[51:05] love them maybe we can be Christ to them
[51:08] maybe we can be an example to them maybe
[51:11] we can maybe find out what they're going
[51:12] through and get our knee under knees and
[51:14] pray to them say God is there anything
[51:15] that I can do to help my brother and
[51:17] sister Oh God would you help them Lord
[51:19] Jesus I don't know what they're going
[51:21] through I I don't know where they're at
[51:23] but Lord Jesus I love them and I just
[51:25] asked Oh God would you give them a
[51:26] special portion today Lord would you
[51:28] reveal your word to award God we're a
[51:30] family we can't make it without one
[51:32] another Lord and I love my brother and
[51:34] you get on your knees and you start to
[51:36] plead for him Oh God will put you in a
[51:38] position where you can help him but as
[51:40] long as we're so filled with judgment
[51:41] and pride of our own selves and our own
[51:44] works in our own doings I'm out we can
[51:46] hardly help anybody the only thing we
[51:47] can do is condemn somebody else because
[51:48] we're looking at our own works and we
[51:50] think we're righteous but there's none
[51:51] that trickiness but him there's none
[51:54] that's righteous but Jesus Christ and
[51:56] when you come to the trust and accept
[51:58] the blood of Jesus Christ and you've
[52:00] been baptized you can come into his
[52:02] righteousness our righteousness is as
[52:05] filthy rags but all there's no
[52:09] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[52:12] Jesus see for a surety our attorney is
[52:16] our judge he is both attorney and judge
[52:18] as judged the case is settled it's
[52:22] finished
[52:22] there is now therefore no condemnation I
[52:26] love how the scripture says even when
[52:28] our heart condemns us
[52:32] even when your heart condemns you God
[52:34] took care of that he'll let you know
[52:36] look look even when you condemn yourself
[52:39] because really you're the one that knows
[52:41] everything you've done you realize God
[52:44] don't know if you were sinning yesterday
[52:45] and you repent before God don't even
[52:47] know you did that's the word he don't
[52:50] even know it
[52:52] right so it's finished there is there
[52:56] now for no condemnation even when your
[52:58] own heart condemns me one of the old
[53:00] mind condemns you why should the church
[53:02] fear what promise has he ever failed to
[53:06] manifest before us why should it fear
[53:09] punishment or death
[53:11] oh oh I tell you what sometimes we make
[53:14] ourselves good Catholics owe me a coke
[53:17] buy me a coke buy me a Copa well I'm you
[53:20] know I just need to be beat up for this
[53:21] one
[53:22] you know the scripture does talk about
[53:27] we reap what we sow but that don't mean
[53:29] there ain't no grace that don't mean we
[53:35] have to accept what our mind thinks we
[53:37] need to go through and we don't have to
[53:38] accept the punishment of the devil line
[53:40] because when Jesus paid the price on
[53:43] Calvary he settled it and there is
[53:45] therefore now no condemnation so don't
[53:48] fear he's saying it right here this
[53:50] ain't my words why should it fear
[53:52] punishment or death right so so so get
[53:57] that understanding in your mind and it
[54:00] has all been overcome here is the mighty
[54:03] conquer here he is the one who conquered
[54:05] both worlds of the seen and the unseen
[54:09] he that descended as now ascended above
[54:12] all and unto Him has been given a name
[54:15] that is above every name oh I love that
[54:17] yes he conquered death hell in the grave
[54:20] and has the keys therefore thereof what
[54:24] he has loosed is loosed and what he
[54:26] binds is bound there is no changing of
[54:29] it there was no Conqueror before him and
[54:32] there is none beside him he alone is the
[54:35] Savior Redeemer he is the only God and
[54:38] the Lord Jesus Christ it is Babel every
[54:41] time I read that I just want to rejoice
[54:42] is the Oh
[54:44] God and the Lord Jesus Christ in his
[54:46] name you realize there's a whole world
[54:48] full of Christianity that says they know
[54:52] Jesus they say that they they know the
[54:54] Lord and God our God that you you your
[54:57] heart goes out to them because you
[54:59] realize they're trying to worship under
[55:01] in a bunch of religious creeds and
[55:03] they've accepted a bunch of doctrine and
[55:05] trees that's been injected in by the
[55:07] devil and no very when they claim to
[55:09] know they don't even have a clue of his
[55:12] grace and His mercy and you just mind I
[55:14] like to think that a God's grace and
[55:16] mercy has been expressed to you that you
[55:19] can have a true relationship with the
[55:21] Lord of glory
[55:22] oh my thank you lord
[55:30] don't fear John don't fear a little
[55:33] flunk we know John's a type of the brine
[55:35] all that I am you are heir to all my
[55:41] power is yours my omnipotence is yours
[55:44] as I stand in your midst lu lujah you're
[55:47] not way off out there somewhere that's
[55:51] what we always kind of feel like but
[55:53] he's here he's here now and I stand in
[55:57] your midst I have not come to bring fear
[55:59] or failure I haven't come to condemn you
[56:02] haven't come to point out all your
[56:04] faults and failures that's that's not
[56:07] why he's here
[56:07] now if you haven't repented of your sins
[56:09] the grace of God deals with your heart
[56:13] and it reveals to where you're slack he
[56:16] reveals to where you're falling short
[56:18] and and and really many times we
[56:21] interpret that as condemnation but look
[56:24] you understand if you're doing something
[56:25] wrong or you're living in sin or you're
[56:27] not doing something right
[56:28] when the word comes forth and convicts
[56:31] you and calls you out
[56:33] that's not condemnation that's the grace
[56:35] of God
[56:37] that's the grace of God and I realized
[56:40] that years ago and my Christian walk
[56:43] when I would when I would fall to
[56:45] something and and you know that's what
[56:47] God will do as brother clever was
[56:49] sharing earlier you know get you know if
[56:50] you fail a test God allow you come right
[56:52] back to that test and give you another
[56:54] opportunity to pass it and that reminds
[56:57] me of a story at one time when I started
[56:58] to serve the Lord and you know when I
[57:02] was out in the world I always say I was
[57:05] out in the world and try to leave it at
[57:06] that because I was out in the world you
[57:09] name it I had done it I had I had run
[57:12] with it all and I had gotten a little
[57:15] trouble and with drugs and an undercover
[57:18] narcotics agent one of my friends he had
[57:21] gotten into some trouble and so he
[57:23] decided he'd be a rat he wanted to be a
[57:25] snitch and so uh he set me up
[57:29] and so I got myself into some trouble
[57:32] and I didn't realize it was the grace of
[57:34] God getting my attention but you know I
[57:37] started to serve the Lord and I and I
[57:38] didn't like this guy you know I wasn't
[57:41] too happy about it and so one day I was
[57:45] driving down the street and sure enough
[57:46] here comes this guy driving by me and
[57:50] I'm thinking to myself that is that guy
[57:53] who ratted me out and all my heart
[57:56] started beating my adrenaline started
[57:58] pumping and I hit the gas to catch up
[58:00] with him and here I come I pull up to
[58:03] the stop light and his windows down and
[58:05] my windows down and the lights red and
[58:07] we're both side by side hey now's my
[58:09] moment I'm gonna let this guy know what
[58:12] he did to me I looked at him he looked
[58:15] over said my life's changed a lot I
[58:20] wanted to say a lot more but I I
[58:25] couldn't do it I wanted to give him a
[58:27] piece of my mind I wanted to tell him
[58:28] what I thought of him uh uh but but all
[58:31] I could get out and I wasn't happy I
[58:32] didn't have the right spirit and I said
[58:35] my life has changed a lot but you know I
[58:38] hadn't seen this guy in a long time ever
[58:39] since that stuff happened is sure enough
[58:40] about a month goes by I'm walking up to
[58:43] the store this guy comes walking out of
[58:45] the store I like here this guy is again
[58:48] are you
[58:51] me and it wasn't like I'm walking over
[58:53] here and he's over there no I'm walking
[58:56] out and we're stepping up on the same
[58:57] sidewalk together like face to face
[59:00] another opportunity I didn't have time
[59:03] to think about it I just looked at him
[59:04] said I don't know whether it invite you
[59:06] to church would punch you in the face so
[59:09] what I said
[59:10] I've been honest I was being honest you
[59:16] know why because I hadn't I hadn't found
[59:18] forgiveness in my heart
[59:20] God was putting me through a test he was
[59:23] putting me through a process he was
[59:25] allowing me to face that again and sure
[59:27] enough not long and I hadn't seen this
[59:30] guy in a long time and all of a sudden
[59:32] God's allowing me to see him face to
[59:34] face and a span of really quick you know
[59:37] and I'm coming up to her store again and
[59:39] I'm like you got to be kidding me
[59:41] there he is again my my mind I walked up
[59:46] to him I said how you doing JD it's a
[59:48] good man what's up hey I just want to
[59:51] let you know man that what God has done
[59:54] in my life he can do the same thing for
[59:56] you and I started to express to him the
[59:59] love and grace of God and you know I
[1:00:01] wanted that for him because when you
[1:00:04] really come to the revelation and
[1:00:06] understanding of what God has done for
[1:00:09] you how could you ever hold anybody
[1:00:12] uh-uh and look down upon them for the
[1:00:16] way that they've lived how could you
[1:00:19] ever have condemnation for somebody
[1:00:21] oh my you can only love them that's what
[1:00:24] love is all love forgives a love covers
[1:00:28] a multitude of sin if thank God for his
[1:00:31] love that's the that's the grace of God
[1:00:37] that's what he does for us it's a
[1:00:39] process
[1:00:46] all power is yours my omnipotence is
[1:00:50] yours as I stand in your mitts I'm not
[1:00:52] come to bring fear or failure but love
[1:00:55] courage and ability all power is given
[1:00:59] unto me and it is yours to use
[1:01:02] you speak the word and I will perform it
[1:01:04] that is my covenant and it can never
[1:01:06] fail amen we we talked about how when a
[1:01:13] spirit born spirit filled men in faith
[1:01:15] takes the word into his heart and places
[1:01:18] it upon his lips well that is the same
[1:01:21] as deity speaking alright that is the
[1:01:26] same as deity speaking every mountain
[1:01:29] has to go Satan can't stand before that
[1:01:32] man Oh hallelujah that's a promise to
[1:01:35] the believers as we just move on a
[1:01:37] little bit in 1st John 4:17 or 418 says
[1:01:41] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:01:43] love casteth out fear because fear hath
[1:01:47] torment he that feareth is not made
[1:01:50] perfect in love we love Him because He
[1:01:53] first loved us are the cloudy skies and
[1:01:58] the rainy days a sign of his disapproval
[1:02:01] - you are the trials and tribulations
[1:02:04] you're going through a sign that that
[1:02:07] God's not happy with you no and neither
[1:02:10] are this year the the the the sun
[1:02:12] shining in the the bright sun rays
[1:02:15] shining down upon you that's no sign of
[1:02:17] God's approval his love is elective
[1:02:22] which he had for us before the
[1:02:25] foundation of the world
[1:02:27] does he love us does he love you oh yes
[1:02:32] but how shall we know how shall we know
[1:02:39] we shall know because he said so
[1:02:43] oh that's simple well I love what I love
[1:02:48] it when God makes it simple how do we
[1:02:50] know he loved us cuz he said so hey man
[1:03:00] because he said so and manifested that
[1:03:03] he did love us for he brought us to
[1:03:06] himself in Gaza gave of gave us of his
[1:03:09] spirit placing us a son and how shall I
[1:03:13] prove my love to him oh my my how shall
[1:03:21] we prove our love to Jesus Christ I mean
[1:03:25] maybe we should feed more hungry people
[1:03:28] than the next church maybe we should
[1:03:31] have no more works than the next brother
[1:03:33] is it works is it works based how shall
[1:03:37] we show our love to the Lord by
[1:03:40] believing what he said oh think I can do
[1:03:44] that thank you lord
[1:03:47] I mean it's it's as it's simple church
[1:03:50] it's simple believe what he said and
[1:03:53] that shows your life too and how do you
[1:03:57] know he loves you because he said so
[1:03:59] praise the Lord by believing what he
[1:04:02] said and by conducting myself with joy
[1:04:06] amidst the trials that he and his wisdom
[1:04:10] allows to come to pass oh if you can let
[1:04:14] that sink in the trials and the
[1:04:17] tribulations that you're facing now yes
[1:04:20] the Lord let it come to pass but he made
[1:04:23] a way for you he made a way for you
[1:04:26] before the world was ever formed and he
[1:04:28] sent his word that it would fight your
[1:04:30] battles and if you just believe what he
[1:04:33] said and conduct yourself with joy
[1:04:35] amongst the trial
[1:04:36] oh you're proving that Jesus Christ is
[1:04:39] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:04:41] oh my you know if we only recognize what
[1:04:46] God has done for us and what he's really
[1:04:47] given to us and the power that we have
[1:04:49] and the power of the spoken word and
[1:04:51] when we recognize who we really are as
[1:04:54] when we spoke about this morning that
[1:04:55] the devil knows that when we realize who
[1:04:58] we are
[1:04:58] we'll be an invincible army will we
[1:05:00] recognize the two spirits within the
[1:05:02] framework of the church that Satan will
[1:05:05] be powerless before us man that's what
[1:05:07] we want we want that we want to have
[1:05:09] this type of understanding we want to go
[1:05:11] on with God we
[1:05:12] want to put one foot in another and
[1:05:14] start to possess the promised land what
[1:05:19] was a says but if the spirit of him that
[1:05:21] raised up Jesus Christ from the dead
[1:05:23] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[1:05:27] from the dead shall also quicken your
[1:05:29] mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[1:05:31] dwelleth in you prophesied and rising to
[1:05:36] the Sun now look how can you say that
[1:05:38] the Spirit dwells in you this is a big
[1:05:42] question right oh how many have ever had
[1:05:45] this question how many have ever
[1:05:48] questioned whether you got the Holy
[1:05:49] Spirit oh my and you know with the
[1:05:53] trials and tribulations and sometimes we
[1:05:55] make disappointing choices and it ain't
[1:05:58] gonna be the first time that question
[1:05:59] comes into your mind but one thing is
[1:06:02] important is that you settle it in your
[1:06:03] heart because I've come to it a many
[1:06:05] times and I've heard the prophet preach
[1:06:07] the word and so many ways and I'll send
[1:06:09] I start to win a minute know I got what
[1:06:11] I think I got but oh thank God for an
[1:06:14] anchor that knows that my goodness Lord
[1:06:17] Jesus even if I didn't have it one thing
[1:06:22] I know that I know that I know that I
[1:06:24] know is that you started this work in me
[1:06:26] Lord Jesus it wasn't me that sought you
[1:06:29] out Alba you sought me out Lord Jesus
[1:06:32] and you said Lord if you begin the work
[1:06:35] of me you're going to finish the work oh
[1:06:38] that should give you some peace that
[1:06:40] when all of the doubt and all the fear
[1:06:42] tries to make you worry that you could
[1:06:44] know it wasn't me I didn't seek myself I
[1:06:47] didn't find this message I didn't figure
[1:06:50] this all out but no what was it it was
[1:06:52] God seeking you and he started that work
[1:06:55] in you so just rest believe what he said
[1:06:59] and you watch you perform what he
[1:07:02] promised that's the Word of God take
[1:07:05] that in your heart and give the devil a
[1:07:09] black eye with it he don't want you to
[1:07:12] know you got it oh my it's like being in
[1:07:15] a fight you imagine being in a fight and
[1:07:17] you're holding a big old bat or you're
[1:07:19] holding a gun or something and the guys
[1:07:21] are like you ain't got a gun you ain't
[1:07:22] got a gun
[1:07:23] you ain't gonna I don't know
[1:07:25] I thought I had a gun I thought I had a
[1:07:29] knife I thought I was prepared to fight
[1:07:30] you nope you got it sure don't got it
[1:07:33] buddy
[1:07:34] why cuz he don't want you to use it
[1:07:37] that's what the devil's doing here he
[1:07:39] says you don't got it
[1:07:41] you ain't who you think you are well
[1:07:43] when we look into the word and said you
[1:07:46] can do all things through Jesus Christ
[1:07:48] that strengthens you all the power that
[1:07:51] was given to me I pulled out of my
[1:07:52] church and it's had your disposal you
[1:07:55] just speak the word don't worry about it
[1:07:58] honey I'm right behind you no back you
[1:07:59] up

[1:08:02] for you to speak the Lord just take down
[1:08:04] my wall I'm gonna come and I'm gonna
[1:08:06] fight for you but everyone else you got
[1:08:08] the Holy Ghost just believe it if you've
[1:08:10] done all that he said full obedience to
[1:08:13] the learning titles you to the token he
[1:08:16] said you shall receive the gift of the
[1:08:18] Holy Ghost and if you've got everything
[1:08:19] you know to stand stand right there and
[1:08:22] say I'm gone
[1:08:23] thank you for your promise thank you for
[1:08:25] your lord thank you for your Holy Ghost
[1:08:28] thank you for your healing thank you for
[1:08:30] your promises hallelujah and watch
[1:08:34] victory just start to come watch it just
[1:08:36] factor your little pep in your step
[1:08:38] oh when you meet your neighbor you meet
[1:08:40] your boss you can't happen I'm just
[1:08:42] gonna tell you I've got the grace of the
[1:08:44] power God
[1:08:52] how can you say that the spirit swells
[1:08:54] in you though you've done everything
[1:09:00] that you know you thought was right here
[1:09:04] is the evidence whether you got it or
[1:09:06] not finally the answer to my question
[1:09:10] I've been wondering this for so long if
[1:09:14] the spirit that was in Christ is in you
[1:09:17] it also quickens you to the word for he
[1:09:23] is the word and if it's contrary
[1:09:26] speaking if the spirit you have is
[1:09:28] contrary it quickens you away from the
[1:09:31] word oh my that's simple and there's
[1:09:37] something about you with the word
[1:09:38] just keeps calling you the lawyer just

[1:11:20] must have done it because I heard it
[1:11:22] they they like mix the name of Jesus
[1:11:24] into it or something like that and us

[1:11:32] know you'll get me out of this mess and
[1:11:34] then I just carried on with my party I
[1:11:38] mean I can't explain it but there was
[1:11:42] something in there that was long oh it

[1:18:40] hey I got something that'll help you
[1:18:42] Willa praise God but that spirits
[1:18:46] dwelling in you I think what the problem
[1:18:49] is is I seed there and you keep trying
[1:18:54] to dig it up we keep trying to check on
[1:18:57] it the Lord deals with a heart we
[1:18:59] believe him and take him at his word and
[1:19:01] we want to like dig it back out and
[1:19:03] check on a black ears are doing anything
[1:19:05] you know when you take a seed and you
[1:19:07] plant it the ground and you water it and
[1:19:09] you put it in the right atmosphere don't
[1:19:11] pick it up don't pick it up just let it
[1:19:14] lay in the presence of the Sun like that
[1:19:17] little water lily that's buried down
[1:19:19] there in the muck and mire of the mud
[1:19:21] down below the water that Sun will keep
[1:19:23] working on that seed it's there don't
[1:19:26] worry in the right atmosphere it's gonna
[1:19:27] spring forth to life well thank God for
[1:19:31] that
[1:19:32] that's the journey of the seed and it
[1:19:35] needs to be in the right atmosphere and
[1:19:37] that's a place as believers and as we
[1:19:40] start our Christian or walk and you
[1:19:42] young men and you young sisters that I
[1:19:44] want to encourage you the right
[1:19:46] atmosphere is very vital to your success
[1:19:48] as a child of God right we want to be a
[1:19:54] good stewards of what God's given us we
[1:19:57] want to be productive in the family of
[1:19:58] God we want to contribute to those that
[1:20:02] are in need and so it behooves us that
[1:20:04] we put ourselves in a position to be
[1:20:06] successful because we see what happens
[1:20:08] when we go out in the wrong atmospheres
[1:20:10] or we feed on the wrong things they were
[1:20:12] catering to the flesh and we're making
[1:20:15] the probability of making a wrong
[1:20:16] decision so much greater but if
[1:20:18] we stay in the right atmosphere feeding
[1:20:20] on the right things you know the
[1:20:22] scripture says that if you sow to
[1:20:23] unrighteousness you're gonna read
[1:20:24] cookery corruption there's a lot of reap
[1:20:28] and so you have you go out and do
[1:20:29] worldly things where you saw the will
[1:20:30] you reap you'll reap world of things but
[1:20:32] look please God he said but if you sow
[1:20:34] do the righteous know just start doing
[1:20:37] the right things just put one foot in
[1:20:39] front of the other I'll start just
[1:20:40] serving God start praising God start
[1:20:43] doing the things you know to do a watch
[1:20:45] o watch hallelujah you start to watch
[1:20:48] the Spirit of God blossoming in your
[1:20:50] life why because you're doing the right
[1:20:52] things and you're living in the right
[1:20:53] atmosphere look the only thing we
[1:20:56] consider is the word that's the only
[1:21:00] thing we consider as believers we
[1:21:01] consider the Word of God and it's hard
[1:21:07] for us to take God at His Word for now
[1:21:10] we're always looking at what God did
[1:21:12] then and looking at what God's going to
[1:21:14] do but failing to see what he's doing
[1:21:16] now
[1:21:17] the scripture says now we are the sons
[1:21:20] of God
[1:21:21] now we're seated in heavenly places with
[1:21:24] Jesus Christ I love that story about
[1:21:27] Joshua and Caleb how they were given a
[1:21:29] promise of the promised land and those
[1:21:34] one-in-a-million they believed it but
[1:21:38] everybody else didn't believe it why
[1:21:40] because they are predestinated seed of
[1:21:42] God when they heard the promise and that
[1:21:45] they're at Kadish Barnea the spies went
[1:21:47] over and they came back and they had the
[1:21:50] fruits showing that the promised land
[1:21:52] was good they looked at the circumstance
[1:21:55] get your eyes off the circumstance and
[1:21:59] on the promise of God oh my reminds me
[1:22:04] of that story a wonderful story about a
[1:22:07] couple that had a sick baby and a sick
[1:22:09] daughter in the hospital a my she was
[1:22:12] really sick with some disease and she
[1:22:14] was just on the brink of death and I
[1:22:16] asked brother Branham to come pray for
[1:22:18] her and brother Branham you know I love
[1:22:20] my brother Brennan didn't hoop and
[1:22:22] holler you know brother Brett oh and did
[1:22:23] just come in and and pray the prayer of
[1:22:25] faith and he come in and and I he saw
[1:22:28] the mom and dad there and he saw the
[1:22:29] girl and and
[1:22:31] his hands on her as the story goes and
[1:22:33] that and their testimony was that they
[1:22:35] just knew brother Branham could get up
[1:22:37] there and pray for their daughter that
[1:22:38] she'd be healed and and brother Branham
[1:22:40] comes up and you know the kind of the
[1:22:42] nurse that seemed a little perturbed you
[1:22:43] know that kind of the the thought of you
[1:22:46] know you know she's about to cross over
[1:22:48] and you know what okay well y'all do
[1:22:51] what you need to do and brother Randall
[1:22:53] comes and prays that prayer faith and he
[1:22:55] just Lord Jesus and he prays Lord may
[1:22:58] you heal her in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:22:59] and prays a simple prayer and he says
[1:23:02] amen and all sin that mom and dad look
[1:23:05] at each other yeah oh praise the Lord
[1:23:09] our daughters healed and that nurse
[1:23:12] couldn't stand it that nurse came over
[1:23:14] says sir what hold up here I don't think
[1:23:17] you understand we've never seen a case
[1:23:20] this bag before and I'm kind of she's
[1:23:23] upset right because she feels like some
[1:23:24] preachers giving this a couple false
[1:23:26] hope and this young nurse goes sir you
[1:23:29] don't understand we've never had a case
[1:23:31] this bad your daughter's going to die
[1:23:34] shortly and that that husband that
[1:23:39] father-like figure looked down at the
[1:23:42] young nurse and said sweetie that's all
[1:23:44] right you know you're you're trained to
[1:23:48] do what you're doing you're trained to
[1:23:50] look at the instruments you're trained
[1:23:53] to look at the circumstance and by your
[1:23:56] calculations now that's what it looks
[1:23:59] like to you buts but we're looking at a
[1:24:02] promise of God see we're not looking at
[1:24:07] what the world's looking at we're
[1:24:09] looking at a divine promise of God
[1:24:12] hallelujah and that's what we're
[1:24:15] standing upon is the Word of God and so
[1:24:18] as we start to take the promised land
[1:24:20] and we start to possess inheritance we
[1:24:23] want to understand that we're standing
[1:24:24] the prom the promise word of God we're
[1:24:27] not looking out of the circumstances the
[1:24:29] prophesied God when God comes into a
[1:24:31] person or two persons into a
[1:24:33] congregation to a man or woman he
[1:24:35] vindicates his presence God proves he's
[1:24:37] there for when God comes supernatural
[1:24:40] signs begin to appear this person
[1:24:42] becomes change purse
[1:24:43] they're not no more like they used to be
[1:24:45] sent as vanished from their life fear
[1:24:46] and doubt as Venice frustrations they
[1:24:49] are solid stable live or die its Christ
[1:24:51] they don't care what comes or what goes
[1:24:53] nothing shake ins they move forward
[1:24:57] hallelujah I want to go on with God I
[1:25:00] want to move forward into all of his
[1:25:03] promises oh God or whatever would hinder
[1:25:06] me or keep me back Lord Jesus help me
[1:25:09] and give me grace to make it one more
[1:25:11] day
[1:25:13] and as we'll just kind of try to end
[1:25:17] going in this direction here for a

[1:28:00] Jesus worshiping together in heavenly
[1:28:03] places
[1:28:04] Wow did you ever sit in one I've sat
[1:28:09] till I would weep for joy and say God
[1:28:12] never let me leave here just heavenly
[1:28:15] places in Christ Oh in heavenly places
[1:28:19] not just out anywhere but if you've ever
[1:28:22] come into a heavenly atmosphere you've
[1:28:24] ever come into the presence of the
[1:28:26] Shekinah glory oh my where he just comes
[1:28:30] and he reveals himself to you in such a
[1:28:32] special way and you feel like you've
[1:28:34] just stepped into eternity well there's
[1:28:37] nothing like it you say Oh Lord just let
[1:28:39] me live here forever
[1:28:40] because in that presence you have need
[1:28:42] of nothing all you feel it's so
[1:28:45] wonderful it's so precious and there's
[1:28:49] something about a believer that we want
[1:28:52] along to be in that kind of atmosphere
[1:28:54] the Prophet said if you've ever been in
[1:28:56] the heavenly atmosphere one time you
[1:28:57] will never be happy anywhere else your
[1:29:01] motive your thoughts will be to stay
[1:29:04] there and as we read here in Ephesians
[1:29:07] you know the book of Ephesians
[1:29:09] typed with a Joshua what it's doing it's
[1:29:12] moving us forward it's positionally
[1:29:14] placing us and that's what we want to do
[1:29:16] as we realize the call of God upon our
[1:29:18] life and that we receive the baptism of
[1:29:20] the Holy Ghost now we want the Spirit of
[1:29:23] Christ to positionally place us in the
[1:29:25] promised land and we know there's a
[1:29:30] there's three types of that
[1:29:32] justification sanctification Holy Ghost
[1:29:35] Israel coming out of Egypt following
[1:29:38] through the wilderness under the pillar
[1:29:39] of fire and the atonement of the
[1:29:41] sacrificial lamb and then entering into
[1:29:43] the promised land which is the Holy
[1:29:44] Ghost the Prophet said now what is the
[1:29:48] land of promise to the New Testament
[1:29:49] believer the promise is the Holy Ghost
[1:29:52] for shall come to pass in the last days
[1:29:54] Joel 2:28 that I'll pour out my spirit
[1:29:57] upon all flesh your sons and your
[1:29:59] daughters shall prophesy upon my
[1:30:02] handmaids in my maid service will I pour
[1:30:04] out of my spirit and they shall prophesy
[1:30:06] I'll show wonders in heaven above and in
[1:30:09] earth and pillars of fire and smoke and
[1:30:11] vapor and Peter said on the day of
[1:30:13] Pentecost after taking his text and
[1:30:15] preaching repent every one of you and be
[1:30:18] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:30:20] the remission to remit to forgive to
[1:30:23] take away all bat trespasses did you
[1:30:27] notice Joshua before crossing cross
[1:30:30] Jordan Joshua said go through the midst
[1:30:32] of the camp and clean your clothes and
[1:30:35] sanctify every one of you let no man
[1:30:39] come to his wife or within three days
[1:30:40] you'll see the glory of God see the
[1:30:43] problem is that it was a process of
[1:30:45] getting ready to inherit the promise a
[1:30:48] process the process is a series of
[1:30:52] actions or steps that are taken to
[1:30:54] achieve a particular result so we want
[1:30:57] to recognize that that's what the Spirit
[1:30:59] of Christ is doing in your life it's
[1:31:02] taking you through a process he says
[1:31:06] before we cross over Joshua said
[1:31:08] sanctify yourself and brother Brandon
[1:31:11] said sanctify means to separate for the
[1:31:13] glory of God oh my that's a
[1:31:17] responsibility that's the challenge
[1:31:19] where we have the world so quick at our
[1:31:22] four tips
[1:31:23] everything's right in our face
[1:31:25] everything's so fast an instant
[1:31:27] gratification and we live in a world of
[1:31:29] technology and it's so hard with
[1:31:31] education and cellphones and computers
[1:31:33] and billboards and TVs and monitors and
[1:31:36] my it's just so easy for for everything
[1:31:38] to flash before your face but you know
[1:31:41] we need to sanctify ourselves for the
[1:31:43] glory of God and one thing you know
[1:31:46] sanctify means to consecrate sanctify
[1:31:49] prepare to separate and I realize you
[1:31:54] know that the scripture when it talks
[1:31:55] about this it says you know we're
[1:31:57] sanctified for a purpose Church and in
[1:32:01] verse 5 it says that we've been
[1:32:03] predestinated unto adoption but you know
[1:32:06] in this process we talk about
[1:32:08] justification sanctification on to the
[1:32:11] Holy Ghost sanctification isn't like a
[1:32:13] checklist that I did that years ago that
[1:32:18] is something we must do every single day
[1:32:22] we must sanctify our lives for the glory
[1:32:26] of God if we want that holy spirit to
[1:32:29] have preeminence in our lives we have to
[1:32:32] set time aside for prayer we have to set
[1:32:35] time aside for His Word and we have to
[1:32:38] sanctify this vessel for the glory of
[1:32:42] God and it's for a purpose and we've
[1:32:45] been called for a purpose we were
[1:32:48] predestinated unto adoption hallelujah
[1:32:52] that's what the Holy Spirit the tutor
[1:32:54] has been given to you for it's the lead
[1:32:57] you and guide you in all truth and
[1:32:59] righteousness and bring you on to
[1:33:02] adoption
[1:33:03] Amen so we want to go all the way we
[1:33:06] just don't want to stop at the entrance
[1:33:08] we don't want to get to the store where
[1:33:10] we're going to buy groceries and just
[1:33:12] walk in and stop right there but we want
[1:33:14] to go in and get what we have need of
[1:33:16] Amen hallelujah the Prophet said God's
[1:33:22] Word under the right atmosphere will
[1:33:23] produce exactly what it says that will
[1:33:25] do it's got to be the right atmosphere
[1:33:28] though you can't lay it over in some
[1:33:30] seminary or some Bible School and that
[1:33:33] don't believe in signs and wonders it'll
[1:33:35] never break
[1:33:36] and bring life there the atmosphere is
[1:33:38] wrong but you go to put it in the right
[1:33:41] atmosphere what kind of an atmosphere a
[1:33:44] surrendered atmosphere stay there until
[1:33:47] it does go to grow and and take in life
[1:33:49] that's the idea that's what we want to
[1:33:52] do church we want to live in a
[1:33:53] surrendered atmosphere a sanctified life
[1:33:56] surrendering to the will of God like
[1:33:58] Paul said I die daily we want to
[1:34:01] sanctify ourselves and dedicate
[1:34:03] everything to him
[1:34:04] dedicate your finance dedicate your
[1:34:07] relationships dedicate your job I
[1:34:09] dedicate the church dedicate your car
[1:34:12] dedicates your clothes dedicate your
[1:34:14] food dedicate your actions dedicate
[1:34:17] everything sanctify everything for the
[1:34:21] glory of God and I want to try to end
[1:34:25] here just to show each one of us we have
[1:34:32] a part to play for the scripture says in
[1:34:35] 1st Corinthians 12:13 that for by one
[1:34:37] spirit were all baptized into one body
[1:34:40] we're part of a family we need one
[1:34:43] another we can't make it without you
[1:34:47] when one member suffers we all suffer
[1:34:52] don't you realize that we can't make it
[1:34:56] without you we need you each one of us
[1:35:01] doing our part fit together that's a
[1:35:03] healthy body living in the heavenly
[1:35:06] atmosphere with the spiritual blessings
[1:35:07] in our midst and so we know that Canaan
[1:35:11] represents the age of the overcomer and
[1:35:13] that's what we've been called to be as
[1:35:15] overcomers what is an overcomer and what
[1:35:19] is overcoming it's recognizing the devil
[1:35:22] in its tactics that's how you overcome a
[1:35:25] man and just winding things down Paul
[1:35:28] says all things are lawful for me but
[1:35:31] all things are not expedient all things
[1:35:33] are lawful for me but not all things
[1:35:35] edify so as you receive the Holy Spirit
[1:35:39] in your life and cry starts to move in
[1:35:41] your life Paul says when I when I was a
[1:35:44] child I spake like a child but when I
[1:35:45] became a man
[1:35:46] I put away childish things so we want to
[1:35:49] start growing and maturing in our walk
[1:35:52] with Jesus Christ forsaking the things
[1:35:56] that we used to do and we want to go all
[1:35:59] with God that's what the baptism of the
[1:36:01] Holy Ghost it's for a purpose it's
[1:36:04] teaching you how to do battle oh my
[1:36:08] nobody can battle like our Lord Oh
[1:36:11] who is this Lord of glory it's the Lord
[1:36:15] God I did battle
[1:36:17] who is the Lord I'm gonna lift you up
[1:36:19] all you everlasting hates hallelujah
[1:36:22] he's 90 in battle and what he's wanting
[1:36:25] to do with you spirit it was a spirit
[1:36:27] he's wanting to teach you how to
[1:36:28] overcome and he showed us in the word
[1:36:31] how to overcome what did he say when the
[1:36:33] devil came and tried to tempt to them it
[1:36:35] is written it is written it is written
[1:36:38] I'll just put that word on your lips and
[1:36:42] what did the promise a if you put that
[1:36:44] one on your lips it's deity speaking
[1:36:47] hallelujah we spoke about how the
[1:36:52] children of Israel crossed over and
[1:36:54] they're that big first tester coming to
[1:36:57] the promised land was Jericho those big
[1:37:01] walls but all they had to do is stay
[1:37:06] with the word that's all you have to do
[1:37:10] is stay with the word can I have about
[1:37:12] 10 more minutes
[1:37:14] hallelujah prophet says by one spirit
[1:37:19] we're all baptized into one body which
[1:37:21] is the body of Christ and in that body
[1:37:25] is nine spiritual gifts operating
[1:37:29] through the local body local church I
[1:37:33] believe in the spiritual gifts I believe
[1:37:37] in the nine spiritual gifts look I want
[1:37:40] all that he has for me every promise in
[1:37:44] the book is mine every chapter every
[1:37:47] verse every line I spiritual gifts what
[1:37:53] we want to do is we want to sanctify
[1:37:55] ourselves living in a heavenly and
[1:37:59] fear in a surrendered atmosphere where
[1:38:02] these gifts of the Holy Spirit can
[1:38:05] operate in our life
[1:38:07] oh my you know here too many people
[1:38:10] preaching on allowing the fruits of the
[1:38:12] spirit and the nine spiritual gifts
[1:38:14] operating in our church oh my are we
[1:38:17] scared of what somebody's gonna think
[1:38:19] are we scared of what the other churches
[1:38:21] are gonna say oh no sir if it's in the
[1:38:24] Word of God I'm on it
[1:38:27] nine spiritual gifts what's your gift
[1:38:32] maybe it's one of them but I don't know
[1:38:36] anything
[1:38:37] Lord if you got something in your word
[1:38:39] for me I want it and if I can say to my
[1:38:41] find myself in such a way and get away
[1:38:44] from all the nonsense out there to live
[1:38:46] in a surrendered heavenly atmosphere oh
[1:38:48] god if you see fit to break upon me with
[1:38:51] the Holy Ghost in any way you please
[1:38:52] lord I will then you become a living
[1:38:58] sacrifice or however you want to use me
[1:39:02] Paul said in Romans 12 I beseech you
[1:39:06] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[1:39:07] that you present your bodies a living
[1:39:09] sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God
[1:39:13] which is your reasonable service we
[1:39:18] could read in 1st Corinthians well we
[1:39:21] just read it 1st Corinthians 12:4 we'll
[1:39:23] move fast now there are diversities of
[1:39:24] gifts but the same spirit and there are
[1:39:27] difference of administration's but the
[1:39:28] same Lord and our diversities of
[1:39:30] operations but it's the same God which
[1:39:32] worketh all in all but the manifestation
[1:39:34] of the Spirit is given to every man to
[1:39:39] profit withal to every one of us there's
[1:39:43] a measure for you 4 to 1 is given by the
[1:39:47] spirit the word of wisdom to another the
[1:39:49] word of knowledge by the same spirit to
[1:39:50] another faith by the same spirit to
[1:39:53] another the gifts of healing by the same
[1:39:55] spirit to another the working of
[1:39:57] miracles to another prophecy to another
[1:39:59] discerning of spirits to another divers
[1:40:01] kinds of tongues to another the
[1:40:03] interpretation of tongues but all these
[1:40:06] worketh that one self same spirit
[1:40:09] dividing to every
[1:40:11] and severally as he will for as the body
[1:40:14] is one and hath many members and all the
[1:40:17] members of that body being many are one
[1:40:19] body so also is Christ each one of us
[1:40:23] are fit enjoying together and this is
[1:40:27] where I just want to end right here the
[1:40:30] promise that God never intended the
[1:40:32] church to be run by man God runs his
[1:40:36] church and he runs it through gifts of
[1:40:38] the Spirit the gifts of the Spirit is in
[1:40:42] the church to correct the spirit he's
[1:40:45] got five ministerial offices in his
[1:40:48] church first of them as apostles or
[1:40:50] missionaries missionary is the highest
[1:40:52] calling there is apostle the word

[1:41:34] that we want to manifest the fruits of
[1:41:35] the spirit then in each local church
