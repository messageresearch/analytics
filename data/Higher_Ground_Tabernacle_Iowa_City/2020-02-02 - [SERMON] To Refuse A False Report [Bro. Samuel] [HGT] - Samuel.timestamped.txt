[45:56] eleven Miguel upon us and we know we are
[45:59] a type of Joshua and Kelly a new servant
[46:01] you know so many teachers make eleven we
[46:03] are the royal seed of Abraham Lou
[46:05] similar has last month's wild up how
[46:07] when we look at all of God's promises
[46:09] and oregano to TA Prohm st.jude we don't
[46:12] look at what the situation saying Vega
[46:14] don't particular situation we don't look
[46:16] at what the circumstance is saying like
[46:18] I don't power circumstance we look at
[46:20] what the Word of God says to us
[46:22] Manu Ricardo a second about the Judy
[46:24] because it is only the promise that
[46:26] stands Frances al Maleh promise keep it
[46:29] in here because when God gives a promise
[46:31] nothing can stop Donna promised her here
[46:33] and a pillar rating is that right amen
[46:35] we look at when God gave Abraham the
[46:38] promise that he was going to receive a
[46:39] son gangaiah V do not form a Siham
[46:42] kilauea VAR f is natural circumstances
[46:44] couldn't allow a circumstance that you
[46:47] had a provable PMSing
[46:48] Sarah was old Sarah a TV a she
[46:51] 9011 on and on and she couldn't conceive
[46:54] nor pre-consumer but because god had to
[46:57] keep his promise he didn't figure this
[46:59] opponent has to condition them
[47:01] conditional issue he made them young
[47:03] again he laughs a compromise could be
[47:06] done who cannot promise do this what so
[47:07] it doesn't matter how situation is the
[47:10] candidacy choice just look at what God
[47:12] says God is the second GID he will
[47:15] condition you if on the condition he
[47:17] will change the environment and rush on
[47:19] here wouldn't even make his promise come
[47:22] to a circus a promise accomplished amen
[47:24] amen
[47:25] so that's what we ought to do say second
[47:28] as the children of Abraham and confront
[47:30] them when we look at what the promise of

[48:07] complete upon me because he told them
[48:09] they were going to possess the gate just
[48:10] a baby easily positively poor typically
[48:13] look at themselves
[48:14] he says Omega D coolest so they know by
[48:21] virtue of that a severe poverty dazzling
[48:24] God was bound to make the complete mess
[48:27] you don't matter how many Canaanites
[48:29] within the pod you normally Canada here
[48:31] whether the children of Israel where we
[48:33] army trained or not who kiddies and find
[48:36] is many tip on Bienvenue pas they were
[48:38] going to get it easily positively
[48:40] because that's what God's promises say
[48:42] kg is taking a promise to Judy and he
[48:45] never fails in Asia may fight so we have
