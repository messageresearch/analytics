[Music] amen we so happy to be here this morning amen um let's bow our heads and and go to god in prayer father god we so grateful father god to be here in your praises this morning lord we want to thank you father for everything that you have done for us lord i want to thank you father god for the moment that we're about to have with you lord jesus lord we pray father god that you'll be with us lord lord you speak to your people father get your palate lord uh anoint my leaves so father she uh lord so that i can say whatever you want me to say lord lord bless the hearts that will hear your word lord let it be a word of transformation the word that will change our hearts that will change our souls lord the word that will make us ready father god to meet you father amen let's turn our bibles in the book of john saint john chapter one saint john chapter one uh we read the verse uh verse one amen we read this verse the last son the one we preached here hey man i just want to go with the same thought that we had last sunday i'm going to continue with what we started was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was gone and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld this glory the glory of of and we beheld this glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen that same word that was in the beginning you meant that word was made flesh and that would dwell to mourn us let's turn to first timothy verse uh chapter three you read the verse 16. first timothy chapter three and timothy we read the verse 16. verse he says when the bible says that and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified the spirit seen of angels preached onto the gentiles believed believed on in the world received up into glory [Music] i'll read it again and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh manifestation here you'll notice that the bible says that god was manifest in the flesh the bible used the word manifest it amen which means that it's the same god who was in the spirit but now he's became a flesh salad remember get on the screen amen justifying the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed only in the world received up in the glory father we just read your word we pray father god that you come and you open these books to us lord jesus lord open our understanding and speak to us this morning in jesus christ let me pray amen amen you may be seated amen i have uh we have a little subject this morning that we wanted to share with you [Music] uh preached last sunday we preached about we shall be changed amen talking about the change that was supposed to come the change that is coming [Music] thought that he became son just i'm still talking about the change because we'll know that god as a spirit god couldn't die that's a spirit in the spirit he wanted to die for us so he had to come down to live with us and to be like us he had to come down to become one of us in order for him to die on the cross so he had to become a son he had to become soon so he became the son of his own house we lived in history for the redemption you know redemption the kingsman redeemer has to be the closest one to you so that's why you couldn't send an angel to die for you that's why he couldn't send anybody else to die on the cross for him so he had to become a son he david divinely so he who was the father amen in order for him to be a father can we say he meant he had to be a son he still has the same god women manifested as a son manifested come amen it's not talking about three different gods we're not talking about the trinity that the god the father is different than the son or the son is different from the spirit she saw us the bride amen in order for him to save us hebrews 4 verse 14 to 16 the bible says seeing that we sing then uh we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold first for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in no points tempted like as we are yet without sin offense now let us therefore come both unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need amen that means that his body was different than his body wouldn't see uh corruption the third day god was supposed to raise him out of the dead it meant behold the virgin shall shall be with child and he shall bring forth his son and they shall call his name which being interpreted is god with us as a son do you confess to us amen he had to become a son he defeated the vineyard in order for him to do that what could the defend even he had to become a son in order for us to touch him and he had to become a son in order for us to to sleep with him with him amen to see him in the human flesh amen because the egg that was from the end that jesus uh jesus jesus was the high priest amen because mary and her eggs were corruptable amen but jesus wasn't jesus wasn't corrupt and corrected he wanted to be a father so he became a son to be a father to be his only to be chemist he became a son of his own house i'll now the prophet says that now in this the father son and holy ghost now after he dwelt in the pill of fire then came down and made himself a body venus brought itself down to a tent of a human flesh and dwelt in it and dwelting among us god dwelling first timothy chapter 3 verse 16. what says that without controversy some controversy that was paul speaking great is the mystery of godliness amen for god was manifest in the flesh you see creator became our savior way above us couldn't even get around where he was it passes the place then he became son we let the benefits that we could touch him feel him listen to you he was a man and then he gave his life that blood cell was broken by crew by crew of sin for roman spirit when he pierced his heart a broken heart killed him his water and blood separate sunshine my grief broke the cell because of the scene of the human race i cause depression in my blood and blood and blood and water came out of him a man to wash you and to make you clean who would have been evil under peace he meant that's the reason why he had to die in order for you to be saved okay his own house and you know this abraham slept like isaac [Music] in his death god wasn't with him that's a more unity perfectly he had to suffer the absence of god in in his death in his death that's a moral that we would have the presence of god in our death see and there god struck upon him our judgment cross even god wasn't there god god had to get away from his body when he when he died he meant the absence of god absence the jews saw that we saw that when we died amen the first was the son of god second was i mean first was the son of man then was the son of god and then the son of david amen he came on the three son's name a brother asked me because when i say that you know i named that he came four times amen then he asked me but there is only three names there is only three names the son of god son of man and son of david yesterday to confess the long face i said that i mean the prophet said that he came under three sons name the prophetic eleven one of the first it doesn't mean that he will come three times amen he used the three names mainly remember he can come as multiple times as you want to please come everywhere amen we know that god first came as the son of man then he came as the son of god believing he commanded you then he will come as the son of man again will if you're not going to come and feast the lord then it will come at the end of everything it will come as the son of david we are offended without amen the son of god the son of man jesus the feast the lord jesus christ anointing i said jesus the son of man was jesus christ himself the lord jesus christ he came as a prophet kevin prophet because in ezekiel chapter 12 verse 1-6 amen the bible says that the world of the lord also came unto me saying ezekiel apparently had amen this is god calling ezekiel son of man thou dwellest in the midst of rebellious house is amen a son of man is a prophet and face the lord made them perfect amen he came as a prophet living in the common prophet amen you will see that the bible said that when jesus come into the course of of caesarea philippi the philippines philippi asked his disciples saying that discipline do men say that i the son of man amen escalation this is the one who defeats the lord amen because his first coming was as as the son of man and jesus didn't call himself a son of god but he was always referring to himself as the son of man remember the prophet that moses that moses prophesied come the prophet that he will raise up it will raise up his prophetic unto me the son of amen so now jesus jesse the son of man ministry that was in the dead in jesus name the minister of the feast revealed thought revealed secrets amen so now we'll go into it and see how you know when jesus was manifesting that ministry amen amen amen let's go first in luke chapter 21 verse 24. i don't think that luke uh then chapter 21 verse 20. look this state of venture the bible says that and there shall be i'm sorry and there shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations yeah 21 24. luke venting and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trotted down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled in jerusalem so here you'll understand that when jesus first came from because notice that woman who called him son of david said i mean jesus looked and looked to her and say that i cannot give the bread of the children to the dogs because she was calling jesus a name that wasn't supposed to be hers she was she didn't have the ability or or the authority to call jesus son of david and i passed it copper still has that pleasure because he wasn't she was a gentile amen jesus only came for the jews the first time he came for jesus amen you will see here jesus as you well he was telling a woman the secrets of her heart sir give me this water the verse don't want to that i thirst the woman answered and say i have no husband jesus said unto her thou has well said i have no husband jesus for thou has had five husbands and here whom they are with israel amen is not it's not it's not your house you're not it's not your husband the woman said unto him the family sir i perceive that thou art a prophet and prophet amen revealing the secret of that woman if a lonely secretary said amen revealing the secret of that woman the holy secret is it from amen you will see the the that jesus also tell nathaniel nathaniel who he was and what what he was doing and where he was called from amen you see that jesus the first time he saw peter he knew peter's name and he knew who was the father because he was god the prophet amen that same sound of man ministry [Music] amen in luke chapter 20 chapter 17 verse 26 to 37. verses and as it was in the days of no one coming away so shall it be also in the days of the son of man and see him they did eat they drank the married wives and they they've given to marriage in mongeri be very mariella until the day of noah entered entering into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all shall it be in the day of the one the son of man is revealed amen the same thing that was that happened back then it's supposed to happen when the son of man is revealed so that's amen with that same son of many ministries i've actually made a minister of the feast of the men to do exactly the same thing that he did to the jews exactly monsieur amen to do that to the gentiles the fair evacuation team amen he did do that in the gentiles first of all so he was a son of man a son of man who was supposed to reveal the son of man amen that doesn't make brother branham god that doesn't make him something that we were there somebody that we have to worship he was letting god to borrow his body so that god can use it amen himself said that in the in the true easter seal remember you just see if he is still if he is still the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of infirmity no no no no no so now he's talking to a woman that he was in the in the in the church that back then and i said that i never seen you in my you are a life to me is that anything i know nothing about you but god does know you forget and if he can reveal to me by his holy ghost by the holy spirit that my spirit goes away now now and his spirit comes in then to let you know whether he's alive or not now i don't know you but he wants to borrow my body to prove that he is the resurrected quite unfair even me and my spirit we don't know you my money spinning remember god knows you do you take me and he wants to borrow my body even to manifest that gift of the son of man to manifest he said don't defeat amen to reveal the secrets of the hearts revelation amen to tell you exactly who you are with the exact amount to tell you exactly where you're from to tell you exactly what is of coming happening with your life with the exact amount of everybody to tell you exactly what trouble you going that you're traveling with the exact amount on the republicans excuse me sister excuse you know i have to relax my mind once in a while now we'll be strangers i see that you're strictly a stranger to me meaning that i don't know you might have you've come from another city city you've got a lot of trouble in your heart and you've got a heart trouble there's a whole lot of blackness i see a black sheep keep following you like that obscurity and that was a man and that was a man was professing divine and healing professor like amen he said that he said you was a witch dick is that true you got a whole stir in your church or something other about it your pastor's your pastor is sick right now and the only thing that is wrong with you that the only thing's wrong the sessions with your heart is that nervous condition republican exactly what was going on with her life i said sure exactly the same way jesus saw that woman at the world what was going on with your life it meant that she had five husbands so jesus i'm now here the prophet brother branham is telling that woman and i see foreign amen amen but now she can go in peace it may not help peace on a lie on people and god has created a prayer john disappeared amen do you see that the same word god told nathaniel memphis i mean what he was doing they quite physically and who he was doing you see that the same gift of the son of man in brother branham amen also tell someone the secret of his life and he says that now i want you to look this way just a moment you say of course you seek yourselves and you're suffering with a condition it's a suffering condition it's a dark spirit around you exactly what her sickness was from exactly seeing you examine uh examined by by by someone's wrong and you got a rupture condition it was inconditioned and the rupture is in the bowels and you have a stomach and you have a stomach trouble also it was a very problem a severe hard trouble that caused you fainting now now he's now telling that woman exactly what happened when i said though exactly he said for me here a few days ago he was sitting sideways on the side of the bed and nearly passed out [Music] whatever it was of course it's gone from me being sure but what do you think that was that yes was it jesus christ jesus christ you are accepted to be that was accepted thank you you are willing merciful you know that some something supernatural is here the supernatural amen amen the same ministry the minister amen came evening amen to give us the same grace that they had members amen so now people are confused and you see people worshiping brother branham you see in africa people baptizing people in the name of brother branham africa baptistely known all the families praying brother and i miss the word of god amen that is the wrong spirit saying because if you read in i think revelation chapter 4 or revelation chapter 1 one of brother branham's message amen he himself he says that he's not god it can remember amen so he can't be worshipped amen but he had that gift inside of him that was god giving us the grace that was god fulfilling his word amen you see that god sent him with the message of restoration and god sent him with the message of revelation god sent him with the message amen the message of restoration and you'll find it in acts chapter 3 verse 20 to 21 we're not going to read it there it's saying that jesus must remain in heaven until the restoration of everything amen in matthew chapter 17 verse 11. amen that god will send elijah to restore everything to restore all things chapter four verse six to verse five to six amen that the spirit of elijah walked beat on the prophet saw amen whose ministry shall turn the heart of the son to the heart of the heart of the fathers amen that was the message of restoration this message restores excuse your message our history amen you will see the fear restore the marriage and divorce divorce amen you restore the water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ amen that we don't baptize people in the name of the father son and the holy spirit because these are titles that's because you show something amen there are not names somebody no remember we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ jesus christ amen he restored the long and uncut hair for women and short hair for men the launch of the smoking drinking immoral sexy clothing and clearly makeup sex message came to restore all those things to restore the seed of the serpent and the original seed the teaching of the seed of the serpent and the original seeds amen the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost he restored the true teaching of grace amen the three works of grace that is justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost is justification amen he came to teach us that there is no women angels and there is no women preachers amen the difference between eternal hell and everlasting help in an everlasting health he came to restore the teaching on predestination election and the free moral agency his message came to restore all those teachings he was also given a message of revelation amen revelation chapter 10 verses verse 7 but in the days of the voice in the days of the voice of the seventh angel apocalypse when it shall begin to sound like the mystery of god shall be finished the mystery and he has declared to his servants the prophet he had to reveal amen so what did he reveal amen he revealed the 12 mysteries of the bible and then you reveal the mystery of the kingdom of heaven amen he revealed the key the mystery of godliness restored to men amen the god and christ or the of the the godhead the mystery of the godhead amen he restored him that we reveal the mystery of the translation of the living saints the same people amen amen the mystery of of of god dwelling in the believer or the baptism of the holy ghost let me amen do you see that the same god why can't you remember you amen who was thoughts before you had to become a son amen to save you amen to bring you to god amen and then he's praying for you right now because the bible says in john i forgot the chapter amen jesus was praying for us so that god can keep us warm as he is one with god with the father and because he cares for you he points to women he cares for you amen he does man when you men he's that's why he's praying for you amen that's why he prayed for us in the bible he says i think in luke chapter one let's let's read it amen to show that god cares for us pretty sure luke chapter one from that misunderstood question okay luke chapter one verse verse 12 and verse 13. and when zechariah saw him he was troubled and feared and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not me for the prayer is and that heard elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shall call his name even fear not for their prayers woman because your prayer has been hurt amen he became a son amen to give you whatever you ask for became a son woman to be touched by the feeling of our infirmities on the cross amen to save you amen and the lord said simon simon behold satan has desired to have you ellis that he may sift you as a wheat a vatican come to play but i have prayed for it that thy faith fail not get up and when they were converted to strengthen thy brethren i he cares about us he pounced on the noon amen that's why he died on the cross for us that's why he became a son amen that's why he became a son absolutely living a man to die for us amen to take our sins with him so that we can become holy african so that we can become saints i think in different onsen amen he was fatherless so that we can have a father of our emperor [Music] to who can possibly imagine a man showing his love and his grace demonstration showing his love and his grace when he shared his blood practices so that you can be saved to wash amen so it doesn't matter what you did before you man it doesn't matter how great your sins are when his blood came to wash you from evil came to make you to make you free society amen and then he said will i do that i will not rest until you are by my side i will now rest [Music] don't complain don't cry complaining amen but all in all the time i don't know every circumstances you may just praise him just listen in every circumstance circumstances [Music] [Music] he knows exactly what you're going through he said exactly so just talk to him and just talk to him hallelujah that's the reason why he became son he meant the son of his own house there's a problem we meant to give you what you want to skip this message will give you what you need then he died we lay more it meant to become a son of god amen that spirit set the spree that holy spirit says [Music] the son of man could only be with us teacher that's why sometimes when you do something wrong they follow you there is a spirit that tells you that what you did was wrong you have to go repent yeah amen but one day when you keep on shutting that voice off to forgive she said amen which would always tell you to forgive asking that's the thing that you're supposed to do if it tells you to say amen to the world that's what you're supposed to do amen to save me yes like me come on i was lost but now i'm found in fact if we can have the lyrics amazing grace amen that grace that was amazing he meant that he left his glory he meant to come here on earth i meant to die for you it meant to be marketed beautiful it meant to be laughed the people laughed at him and people made fun of him and all of that just to save you and me amazing race [Music] is [Music] like me [Music] i was lost [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] five years [Music] grace [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] is [Music] me [Music] again [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] is [Applause]
