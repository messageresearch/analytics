[1:54:38] [Laughter]
[1:54:52] to be done
[1:54:56] you you may not understand everything

[1:55:10] you know I love your words
[1:55:13] [Music]
[1:55:30] [Music]
[1:55:42] [Music]

[1:57:05] there was no hesitation
[1:57:09] yeah
[1:57:12] [Music]
[1:57:25] don't have insurance
[1:57:30] now brother Cooper is not here just for
[1:57:33] business
[1:57:39] but if there be any of you who don't
[1:57:41] have insurance
[1:57:50] [Music]
[1:57:57] because we've had a few deaths
[1:58:09] and it caused pressure on everybody
[1:58:13] maybe this is the way things were done
[1:58:19] because in America you need insurance
[1:58:25] I know you don't like it
[1:58:29] it took me a long time to like insurance
[1:58:36] and I hated insurance
[1:58:39] but I found out how necessary it is
[1:58:50] I know that he can get you
[1:58:53] anything I'll let him talk
[1:59:00] [Music]
[1:59:08] let's give the word of God

[1:59:53] given greater Revelations
[2:00:05] [Music]
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:18] [Music]
[2:00:31] against Jesus Christ

[2:00:46] thank you
[2:00:52] [Music]
[2:01:04] hello
[2:01:05] [Music]
[2:01:07] um I I am really humbled to be able to
[2:01:10] be there and be invited to help anybody
[2:01:13] that needs help with insurance
[2:01:19] [Music]
[2:01:21] I think the big thing
[2:01:27] with insurance
[2:01:29] is that
[2:01:31] it it isn't as expensive as people
[2:01:36] Insurance isn't as expensive as people
[2:01:38] think it is
[2:01:42] [Music]
[2:01:43] a lot of people think it's three times
[2:01:45] more expensive than it actually is
[2:01:47] [Music]
[2:01:53] but when you need it foreign
[2:01:58] [Music]
