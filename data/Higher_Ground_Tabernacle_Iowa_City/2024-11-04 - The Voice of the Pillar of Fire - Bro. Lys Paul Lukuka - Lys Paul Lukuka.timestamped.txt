[36:02] um we'll just um get straight to the
[36:07] word if you can please
[36:12] stand I greet you all in the name of the
[36:14] Lord Jesus
[36:16] Christ amen so we'll go to uh uh 1st
[36:21] Samuel chapter 3
[36:33] but let's bow our head
[36:36] first dear heavenly father Lord we thank
[36:39] you for such a beautiful
[36:42] day we thank you Lord God for giving us
[36:45] a good health
[36:47] and a place where we can come and hear
[36:49] your word and Worship
[36:53] You Lord I pray that you forgive us of
[36:56] our shortcomings
[36:59] father we here we here with an
[37:01] appointment with you Lord because you
[37:03] said in your
[37:06] word that wherever two or three are
[37:08] gathered in your name that you shall be
[37:10] in the midst of
[37:13] them Father we thank you for being
[37:16] here and I yield myself to you
[37:20] Lord I pray you that you use the gift
[37:23] that you speak to your
[37:26] people and you hear through their
[37:28] through their ears Lord
[37:30] God may you bless each ear that'll hear
[37:32] the
[37:35] word in the precious name of Jesus
[37:38] Christ we pray
[37:41] amen amen all right 1 Samuel chapter 3
[37:45] verse 1 says
[37:47] Samuel and the child Samuel ministered
[37:50] unto the Lord before
[37:53] Eli 1 Samuel chapter 3 before Eli and
[37:56] the word of the Lord was precious in
[37:58] those
[38:04] days there was no open
[38:08] Vision I'll repeat that again the word
[38:11] of the Lord was precious in those
[38:15] days the prophet says the word of the
[38:17] Lord is still precious in our
[38:20] [Music]
[38:23] days and verse two and it came to pass
[38:26] at that time when was laid down in his
[38:29] place and his eyes began to wa themm
[38:32] that he could not
[38:39] see and a the lamp of God went out in
[38:43] the temple of the Lord where the Ark of
[38:45] God was and Samuel was laid down to
[38:49] [Music]
[38:54] sleep that the Lord the Lord called Sam
[38:57] and and he answered here am
[39:03] I and he ran onto Eli and said here am I
[39:06] for thou callest me and he said I called
[39:09] not lay down again and he went down and
[39:12] laid
[39:21] down and the Lord called yet again
[39:24] Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Eli
[39:27] and said here am I for thou did call me
[39:30] and he answered I called not my son lie
[39:33] down
[39:44] again and the Lord God and the Lord
[39:48] called Samuel again the third time and
[39:50] he arose and went to Eli and said here
[39:53] am I for thou did call me and Eli
[39:56] perceived that the Lord had called the
[40:10] child and therefore Eli said unto Samuel
[40:14] go lie down and it shall be if he called
[40:17] thee that thou shalt say Speak Lord for
[40:20] thy servant heareth so Samuel went and
[40:23] laid down in his place
[40:26] [Music]
[40:32] and the last verse and the Lord came and
[40:35] stood and called as at other times
[40:38] Samuel Samuel you know I love that the
[40:41] word says that he called as at other
[40:43] time so God doesn't
[40:46] change he always keeps the same way of
[40:50] brother says that if if God deals with
[40:53] one person a certain way he also deal
[40:56] with another person same
[40:59] way because he changes not so then
[41:03] Samuel answered speak for thy servant
[41:10] heareth amen I have one more verse and
[41:12] I'll let you
[41:14] see Exodus 3 verse
[41:22] 1-4 the Bible says now Moses kept the
[41:24] flock of uh jro his father mother-in-law
[41:27] the priest of Midian and he led the
[41:30] flock to the backside of the desert and
[41:33] came to the Mountain of God even
[41:44] to and the angel of the Lord appeared
[41:47] unto him in a flame of fire out of the
[41:50] midst of a
[41:51] bush and he looked and behold the bush
[41:54] burned with fire and the Bush was not
[41:57] con
[42:04] consumed consum and Moses said I will
[42:07] now turn aside and see this great side
[42:10] why the bush is not burned
[42:18] Mo and when the Lord saw that he turned
[42:21] aside to see God called unto him out of
[42:24] the midst of the Bush and said Moses
[42:27] Moses and he said here am
[42:36] [Music]
[42:38] I amen you may have your
[42:43] seats amen um while you see it I'll just
[42:46] read one more verse
[42:48] and going to be Genesis chapter
[42:52] one oh he says in the beginning God
[42:55] created the Heaven and the Earth
[42:59] verse three says and God said let there
[43:02] be
[43:03] light and there was
[43:05] light verse five he says and God called
[43:08] the uh the light day and the Darkness he
[43:10] called
[43:13] night verse six he says and God said let
[43:17] there be a firmament in the midst of the
[43:24] waters amen amen so this morning I'm
[43:26] going to going to preach on a topic
[43:28] called uh the voice of the pillar of
[43:34] fire the voice of the pillar of
[43:37] fire or in other word it can it can be
[43:39] like the voice of the Angel of the
[43:44] Lord and um I'll first by I'll start by
[43:48] um describe what what is the pill of
[43:53] fire the prophet said that in the
[43:56] beginning when God created the Heaven
[43:57] and the
[44:00] earth like before he even started the
[44:02] creation there was the the Earth was
[44:06] void know uh the spirit of God was
[44:09] moving over over the
[44:11] Earth but you couldn't see God because
[44:14] God was God is a
[44:17] spirit and then the prophet says God God
[44:20] God he was just all everywhere like he
[44:23] he he occupied the entire the entire he
[44:25] didn't have like um Lim
[44:30] and then he had to make himself in a
[44:32] form that could be
[44:35] visible and the prophet called that the
[44:39] logos the prophet says that the logos
[44:42] the word of God the that was the pill of
[44:44] fire that came out of that great he says
[44:46] he said in the beginning God wasn't even
[44:48] God
[44:51] yet he was just the great Elohim the
[44:54] self-existent one
[44:57] and out of Elohim the the theophany the
[45:00] word the pill of fire came
[45:03] out and that's God in a visible
[45:08] form so that same pillow of fire is that
[45:10] pillow of fire that we we saw appear to
[45:15] Moses but before we get to Moses we also
[45:17] see that Samuel heard the
[45:20] voice and the prophet says that the
[45:22] voice was precious in those days the
[45:25] word of the Lord
[45:28] and he says it's even more precious in
[45:30] our
[45:31] days so don't take the voice of God for
[45:34] for
[45:36] granted hold it as a precious
[45:39] Jewel Prophet said it's more precious in
[45:42] the days of Samuel the Bible says in the
[45:44] day in the days of Samuel there was no
[45:46] open
[45:48] Vision so let's get back to the story of
[45:52] Moses so Moses heard uh Moses heard the
[45:55] voice of God in the burning boo
[45:59] but he he was curious to see where the
[46:01] voice was coming
[46:03] from and he looked and he saw there was
[46:06] fire but the the the Bush was not burn
[46:08] um getting
[46:10] burnt it was it wasn't getting
[46:13] consumed he was curious to see what that
[46:16] voice
[46:18] was that fire was and he heard a voice
[46:21] Moses Moses take off the Sho your
[46:24] shoes so we understand so understand
[46:27] that the pillow of fire has a
[46:30] voice because that that pillow of fire
[46:33] spoke to
[46:35] Moses and Moses uh Moses while growing
[46:39] up he already knew his position he knew
[46:41] he he was to to to deliver the children
[46:43] of
[46:46] Israel he knew his
[46:49] calling and he and he tried to go before
[46:53] before the pillow of fire and tried to
[46:54] do it with his own hands El said
[46:59] he tried to save his Brethren and then
[47:01] that got him into
[47:04] trouble and the prophet says that every
[47:07] time you try to go before the angel of
[47:09] the Lord that's where you get into
[47:13] trouble Moses thought that he he could
[47:15] do it all by
[47:18] himself but you have to know that any
[47:21] Ministry you cannot be successful in any
[47:23] Ministry without the help of the Angel
[47:25] of the Lord
[47:30] even our prophet in our day he couldn't
[47:32] be successful without the angel of the
[47:37] [Music]
[47:39] Lord he had to to meet the pill of
[47:43] fire so Moses heard the
[47:46] voice and the voice changed him because
[47:49] before that Moses actually he ran away
[47:52] from the
[47:54] Egyptians know in other word he was sort
[47:56] of like a
[47:58] coward but you notice there's a
[48:00] difference in Moses after he he met the
[48:02] pillar of
[48:07] fire he went down to the camp of the
[48:10] enemy that's why the pillar of fire will
[48:13] do to
[48:14] you if you meet the pill of fire it's
[48:16] going to change
[48:17] you it will give you
[48:19] boldness he will take away that spirit
[48:21] of
[48:22] fear he will take away any Spirit
[48:25] contrary to the word of God
[48:28] the pill of fire will help you to
[48:30] accomplish the purpose that God wants
[48:32] for
[48:33] you Moses had a
[48:37] calling but he couldn't be successful
[48:39] without meeting that
[48:42] fire all of you all of you have callings
[48:45] in your life God is calling each and
[48:48] every one of you to a specific
[48:51] purpose but you will never be successful
[48:54] without meeting the pillow of Fire
[48:58] you will never be successful without
[49:00] hearing the voice of the pillar of
[49:05] fire so in the message the
[49:08] absolute paragraph
[49:11] 263 the prophet explains and he says
[49:14] that now notice Moses had the
[49:20] fire the fire and he says the fire was
[49:24] in Moses
[49:27] because whatever Moses said it wasn't
[49:30] Moses it was God
[49:34] speaking and he says because the pillar
[49:37] of fire left the bush and come in
[49:43] Moses so when Moses had that experience
[49:46] with a pill of
[49:47] fire brother tells us that that fire
[49:50] didn't just stay on in in on the bush
[49:56] left the bush and he went inside of
[50:00] Moses and therefore Moses became the
[50:03] voice of God to the to the children of
[50:07] Israel when Moses when God met Moses he
[50:10] told him that I heard the Cry of my
[50:14] people I heard the Cry of my people and
[50:16] I've come down myself to deliver
[50:20] them no but when the children of Israel
[50:22] saw the Deliverance of
[50:25] God came form of a human
[50:28] being it came in the form of a
[50:31] man and that man had was veiling the
[50:34] pillow of fire inside of
[50:36] him this is not my word I just repeated
[50:40] what brother Bram saying in the message
[50:43] the absolute we just read he said that
[50:44] the pill of fire left the bush and he
[50:47] came inside of
[50:52] Moses so the message that Moses was
[50:54] bringing to the children of Israel
[50:56] wasn't message sent by Moses
[51:00] himself you know so after he went to
[51:03] Egypt to deliver the
[51:05] [Music]
[51:07] children there was an experience in
[51:09] Mount
[51:11] Si and the children of Israel also
[51:13] wanted to hear the voice of
[51:15] God they were complaining why is God
[51:18] just dealing with Moses directly instead
[51:20] of coming straight to
[51:22] us and God like okay Moses I I tell the
[51:27] people to sanctify I'll come down to to
[51:29] to speak to them
[51:33] myself and when God came down to speak
[51:35] to
[51:36] them the Bible says it was lightning
[51:39] Thunders and M like mou quaking and all
[51:44] that and they
[51:47] trembled they were
[51:49] afraid what a love about that verse is
[51:53] that I think it's in verse 19 he says
[51:55] that he says that the the children of
[51:58] Israel couldn't speak to God but Moses
[52:00] could speak to
[52:04] God they were so afraid that they
[52:07] couldn't even speak to
[52:09] God but Moses was a different a
[52:12] different he was a different
[52:15] being and they as they told they told um
[52:18] Moses tell God that from now on we don't
[52:21] want God to speak to us directly
[52:27] we want God to deal with you to speak to
[52:29] you and then you bring us the word of
[52:32] God and God and God honored that that
[52:37] request and from that time God changed
[52:39] the way he deal with
[52:42] men God started using
[52:45] prophets from that time the prophet
[52:48] became God's mouthpiece to the
[52:55] generation like prophets they're not
[52:57] they're not the same beings like we are
[53:01] here they're made different than
[53:04] us if you read the book of Exodus that
[53:07] experience in Mount
[53:09] Si it was the god coming down on the
[53:13] mountain and it was full of
[53:15] fire and nobody could even touch uh uh
[53:19] the
[53:21] mountain God had set boundaries on the
[53:24] around around that mountain
[53:27] even if the animals touch the mountain
[53:29] they will die
[53:32] instantly but you notice that Moses
[53:35] could actually get in the
[53:39] mountain Moses could get the mountain
[53:41] was was the full of the pillar of
[53:43] fire the prophet says that Moses entered
[53:46] into the pillar of
[53:48] fire you even see even brother Bram when
[53:51] he went to the
[53:53] doctor the doctor told him that his body
[53:55] is different than our
[53:59] body you know that like his body is not
[54:02] made like our body he's
[54:05] different because he had to meet God
[54:07] face to
[54:09] face to bring us the word for our
[54:12] day amen amen and then so when Moses so
[54:16] be so after Moses went to mount uh uh uh
[54:19] he went to the mountain to to see
[54:22] [Music]
[54:24] God and the glory of God was so great
[54:27] that he Moses had to Veil his
[54:31] face the children of Israel could not
[54:34] look at Moses the prophet says that by
[54:36] looking at Moses they were getting
[54:41] blinded and the prophet says that that's
[54:43] that's the same thing that's happening
[54:45] in our day
[54:47] today people are always blinded by
[54:50] seeing God veiled in a
[54:53] man the prophet says that if he he he
[54:56] opens the eyes to some and he blinds the
[54:58] other
[55:01] one that's always been a stumbling block
[55:04] in our
[55:06] generation God walking in a human
[55:09] being but don't let that stumble
[55:12] you because God has given you his grace
[55:15] to see that that was God using the
[55:20] man you know so Moses wanted to see the
[55:23] glory of
[55:25] God he wanted to see the glory he asked
[55:27] God God I want to see your
[55:30] glory and God said okay I'll go on the
[55:33] mountain on the Rock
[55:36] somewhere and God passed and Moses saw
[55:40] that he saw that God had a back he had a
[55:42] back like a
[55:44] man and that verse says that God took
[55:48] his hands and covered the face of
[55:50] Moses so we see that that pill of fire
[55:54] actually has a he like he he's like a
[55:58] man he has a
[56:00] back he has hands you know amen amen
[56:05] amen so like the the message today is to
[56:08] try to emphasize on the importance of
[56:10] listening to the voice of
[56:16] God and understanding that making the
[56:20] difference between the man and God that
[56:22] you're not hearing from a man you're
[56:23] hearing from God
[56:26] because once you have that Revelation
[56:28] then this message becomes a blessing to
[56:31] you as long as you just think that this
[56:33] message is just a man speaking to you
[56:35] then you'll never be
[56:38] blessed but as long as you know it is
[56:40] God then you're going to receive the
[56:42] blessing from
[56:45] God so Moses Moses in the mountain he
[56:48] had appointed
[56:54] Elders yeah he had 70
[56:58] elders yeah because uh because the the
[57:02] work was getting too much and I think
[57:04] his father-in-law advised to him to have
[57:06] 70 elders to carry to continue to help
[57:09] Moses in his in his
[57:12] ministry but I I was reading what the
[57:14] prophet said about that
[57:16] experience and he said that despite
[57:19] Moses um um appointing those 70
[57:24] elders Moses was still last
[57:28] answer so if they had any issue they had
[57:30] to always go back to what Moses
[57:33] said the prophet said because he had
[57:36] thus sayth the
[57:38] Lord so even ministers today we only
[57:41] supposed to repeat what brother Bram
[57:44] says because only he brought that said
[57:47] the Lord for Our
[57:49] Generation he he was meeting God face to
[57:53] face brother bam says that God never
[57:56] deals with two people at the same
[57:59] time brother Ram says that if God the
[58:03] reason why God doesn't do it like that
[58:04] is because we have diff we never see
[58:07] things eye to
[58:10] eye we have our own inter like we we see
[58:13] things things
[58:15] differently so God couldn't use two
[58:17] people because they'll have two
[58:18] different opinions regarding his
[58:22] word that's why God always brings one
[58:25] person
[58:29] amen So reading the message take the rod
[58:32] and gather the
[58:34] people the prophet says oh I don't know
[58:37] what it is in French um
[58:40] Che yeah the prophet says that um the
[58:44] people that crucified Jesus Christ
[58:46] believed in An Almighty
[58:52] God in religion's holy Renown man they
[58:55] crucified the Son of God because they
[58:57] did not believe that he was
[59:01] God
[59:06] in and no matter how much they believed
[59:09] in Jehovah
[59:12] God they can't believe in Jesus being
[59:15] his son in order to receive anything
[59:17] from Jehovah
[59:22] God uh I'll continue reading this but
[59:25] before the prophet is saying that you
[59:27] know the Jesus says that you have
[59:29] believed in God believe also in
[59:33] me the prophet says that those those
[59:36] Pharisees all those people they believed
[59:38] God they belied
[59:41] Jehovah Jesus is I know you believe in
[59:44] God but believe also in
[59:47] me and the prophet makes a strong
[59:49] declaration
[59:51] here and he says when he met the angel
[59:54] of the Lord the angel of the Lord told
[59:56] if you get the people to believe
[1:00:02] you he says do you see it get the people
[1:00:06] to believe
[1:00:07] you and be sincere when you
[1:00:11] pray no disease shall stand before the
[1:00:15] prayer he says do you believe
[1:00:18] me you know Jesus is the same yesterday
[1:00:21] today and
[1:00:23] forever if you believe the prophet the
[1:00:25] prophet
[1:00:27] message you know nothing will be
[1:00:29] impossible to
[1:00:30] you and he says I'll believe God no no
[1:00:34] okay the prophet is saying you you say I
[1:00:37] I'll believe
[1:00:39] God so brother is saying I'm telling you
[1:00:42] believe
[1:00:43] me but you tell brother Bram no me I'll
[1:00:46] just believe
[1:00:48] God brother Bram says that well that's
[1:00:51] what you should
[1:00:53] do but you can't believe God
[1:00:57] and you don't believe
[1:00:59] this it won't do you any
[1:01:02] good he says now that's hard and I hate
[1:01:05] to say
[1:01:08] that but it's the
[1:01:10] truth right so you can there there are a
[1:01:13] lot of people they claim oh we believe
[1:01:15] Jesus we believe the Bible and all
[1:01:18] that but according to what brother bam
[1:01:21] is saying if you yeah it's it's good you
[1:01:22] believe the Bible but if you don't
[1:01:25] believe me
[1:01:27] he won't do you any
[1:01:29] good that's why the angel told brother
[1:01:31] if you get the people to believe
[1:01:35] you then nothing shall stand against
[1:01:37] your
[1:01:39] prayer and he says then when you believe
[1:01:42] me you believe what the angel has come
[1:01:47] for that he is the angel from
[1:01:51] God you know I'm just his voice
[1:01:56] he is a supernatural person and I'm
[1:02:02] natural he can bring Supernatural to the
[1:02:05] Natural
[1:02:08] man he glorifies he speaks his
[1:02:12] voice he uses my
[1:02:15] hands he he uses my eyes to see
[1:02:20] Visions he uses my
[1:02:22] ears just as the Holy Spirit uses you
[1:02:26] so the prophet is saying that he's the
[1:02:28] voice of
[1:02:30] God and that God is a supernatural
[1:02:33] person using
[1:02:36] natural the same way that Moses made the
[1:02:38] pillar of
[1:02:39] fire and he became the voice of God to
[1:02:42] the children of
[1:02:44] Israel a supernatural God using a man a
[1:02:48] natural
[1:02:50] man amen amen and the prophet says that
[1:02:53] there's a word of God for each age
[1:02:58] there there's a word of God for the
[1:02:59] there was a word of God for the the age
[1:03:01] of Luther like um
[1:03:05] West and in our age to we living in the
[1:03:07] last
[1:03:08] age do you believe that we living in the
[1:03:10] last
[1:03:12] age and there's there got to be a word
[1:03:14] for our
[1:03:16] age but the way God works is he always
[1:03:19] uses a
[1:03:20] prophet to bring his
[1:03:24] word and the is that same pillow of fire
[1:03:27] that that came out of God spoke and that
[1:03:30] pillow of fire enters the prophet and
[1:03:32] starts
[1:03:37] speaking and the prophet even says that
[1:03:40] Moses was Moses became God to the
[1:03:42] children of
[1:03:46] Israel amen he says that okay I'll just
[1:03:49] read that
[1:03:50] here I like reading the prophet because
[1:03:52] that way you it's you I give you that
[1:03:55] it's not coming from me it's coming from
[1:03:56] the prophet I'm just here to repeat and
[1:03:59] to Echo what he
[1:04:01] says you know he says he was he was with
[1:04:04] Moses and was ready to be
[1:04:07] manifested he says he was the words to
[1:04:10] them he's speaking about
[1:04:13] Moses Moses was the Living Word
[1:04:17] he Moses was the word of God veiled uh
[1:04:21] in a
[1:04:23] man the prophet say mes had to put a
[1:04:26] veil over his own
[1:04:30] face why because he was the
[1:04:34] word and until the word was made known
[1:04:37] Moses had to Veil
[1:04:43] himself the prophet says wherever the
[1:04:45] word is it's
[1:04:49] veiled and he says now remember after
[1:04:52] the word was made manifest Moses was
[1:04:55] Moses again
[1:04:58] mes times where he was just
[1:05:02] Moses and there were times where he
[1:05:05] became God to the children of
[1:05:07] Israel and the prophet says that as long
[1:05:09] as Moses said the word in in him to give
[1:05:12] out to the people he became God to
[1:05:17] them that's why I don't understand when
[1:05:20] people try to correct the
[1:05:23] prophet it just shows a lack of
[1:05:25] revelation of who a prophet
[1:05:29] is who are you to correct
[1:05:32] God you have to understand that a
[1:05:34] prophet is not just himself he's the
[1:05:36] representative of
[1:05:37] God he's the voice of God for this
[1:05:41] generation don't let any Minister try to
[1:05:44] correct the
[1:05:46] prophet we are here to Echo what brother
[1:05:48] bam
[1:05:50] saying because that's that's life to
[1:05:54] us amen
[1:05:57] amen and the prophet continues and he
[1:05:59] says that he says that Moses was a
[1:06:03] different
[1:06:05] fellow you know he said let me back he
[1:06:08] says nothing could okay nothing could
[1:06:10] touch him till that was
[1:06:14] over imagine this man Moses in the in
[1:06:17] the Bible when the pill of fire was
[1:06:19] inside of
[1:06:20] him you couldn't even touch
[1:06:24] him that's that's powerful you can't
[1:06:26] even touch the man because God was in a
[1:06:31] man and he says that he says that
[1:06:34] therefore when you when he come the
[1:06:35] people turned their heads they couldn't
[1:06:41] understand he was a different
[1:06:43] fellow prophets are different
[1:06:46] fellows they're not like we are like I I
[1:06:49] said
[1:06:51] earlier he come with the
[1:06:54] word and he put a
[1:06:56] veil the Bible said over his
[1:07:00] face and this is what brother says and
[1:07:02] he had the word and he was the word to
[1:07:08] them I'm not going to be sorry to say
[1:07:10] that William branam is the word of God
[1:07:12] to
[1:07:15] you and I'm not ashamed to say
[1:07:18] that and you have to believe that in
[1:07:20] order to receive the same reward that he
[1:07:23] that that he that the angel promised him
[1:07:28] and when you when you when you you
[1:07:30] believe that brother Bram is the word
[1:07:32] for our
[1:07:34] day then you start applying that
[1:07:36] word because you understand that the
[1:07:39] word did not come from
[1:07:41] him came from God
[1:07:43] himself you know and and the prophet
[1:07:47] says I I think I said this earlier the
[1:07:49] word of God veiled in a man is what
[1:07:51] blinds the
[1:07:54] people and brother brother says that
[1:07:56] that uh um today because the message uh
[1:08:00] that's what that's what hold on let me
[1:08:01] back let me go back cuz I don't want to
[1:08:04] God can't break his
[1:08:06] word in the last days he had to be the
[1:08:09] same thing
[1:08:11] again what blinded
[1:08:14] Israel it was that
[1:08:16] man you a man making yourself
[1:08:21] God that's what they killed him for and
[1:08:24] today because the message come through
[1:08:26] man and not
[1:08:30] Angels Propet is saying that's what's
[1:08:32] stumbling the people because today the
[1:08:33] message is coming through a
[1:08:38] man you not seeing Angels coming down
[1:08:41] from heaven hey I have a word for from
[1:08:43] the
[1:08:44] Lord you you see a man that could put a
[1:08:47] heart on his
[1:08:48] head he could go hunt know and and he
[1:08:52] had issues with the law
[1:08:55] he tax uh problems and that man you want
[1:08:58] to tell me he's he he's bringing the
[1:09:00] word of God for me the prophet says
[1:09:03] that's what is stumbling the
[1:09:05] people because the message came through
[1:09:07] a
[1:09:08] man he says God can't change his
[1:09:11] way God cannot change his
[1:09:14] word he says and the Gentiles are just
[1:09:17] as blinded today as Israel
[1:09:22] was because God is veiled in a human
[1:09:27] being blinded
[1:09:31] Israel don't be blinded by by by seeing
[1:09:35] God using a
[1:09:37] man amen amen you must be a blessed
[1:09:40] people to actually have your eyes
[1:09:43] open because Jesus says that bless I
[1:09:46] thank the father that you've hidden
[1:09:48] these things to the wise and
[1:09:51] prudent but you have revealed this to
[1:09:54] such as babes
[1:09:56] you must be so special for God to to
[1:09:59] leave all those other people out there
[1:10:01] and give you that
[1:10:04] Revelation world is full the world is
[1:10:07] the world is full of eight billion
[1:10:10] people out of 8 billion people God chose
[1:10:14] you you have to be a happy people you
[1:10:18] got to praise God because that
[1:10:19] Revelation is isn't given to
[1:10:23] anyone the prophet says he blinds the
[1:10:25] people but why are you here why are you
[1:10:28] here this morning sisters you could have
[1:10:31] been wearing
[1:10:32] pants you could have been putting
[1:10:34] makeups about why are you not doing
[1:10:36] that because God has opened your
[1:10:39] eyes God has given you that
[1:10:42] Revelation that this message did not
[1:10:44] come from a
[1:10:46] man and and I've experienced this
[1:10:49] thing God in a man uh God using in a
[1:10:53] using a Man U stumbles the people
[1:10:56] [Music]
[1:10:57] when I was here in North when I used to
[1:10:59] live in North
[1:11:00] Liberty I worked at
[1:11:03] Central and I was trying to witness to
[1:11:05] someone about the
[1:11:09] prophet and um as soon as I show him the
[1:11:12] picture of the
[1:11:14] prophet he just oh my God you guys are
[1:11:16] getting uh uh
[1:11:19] Brainwashed the white man has
[1:11:21] brainwashed
[1:11:23] you that stumbled him to see
[1:11:26] that stumbled the man to see that we we
[1:11:29] call God using a white man again to be a
[1:11:35] prophet but that doesn't stumble
[1:11:39] us and and then you didn't not get this
[1:11:41] on your own God revealed this to
[1:11:44] you don't condemn those people that
[1:11:47] cannot see the
[1:11:49] light because they can't help it it's
[1:11:51] God that gives
[1:11:54] Grace who opens the
[1:11:56] eyes know the Bible says that no man can
[1:11:59] come to him except he draws him
[1:12:02] first so you did not come to God
[1:12:05] yourself God is the one that Drew that
[1:12:07] Drew you to
[1:12:09] him and he said that he that began the
[1:12:12] good
[1:12:13] work he's faithful to finish that
[1:12:16] work so just trust God trust that voice
[1:12:21] trust that calling that he will call you
[1:12:24] he's going to finish
[1:12:27] God never leaves anything
[1:12:30] undone God is always perfect in
[1:12:32] everything he
[1:12:34] does Perfection means everything is
[1:12:37] exactly how it's supposed to
[1:12:40] be whatever the word of God says that
[1:12:42] you're supposed to be you will be
[1:12:45] that all you just have to do is to
[1:12:48] believe because because the Bible says
[1:12:51] that no man can please God the Bible
[1:12:53] says that only by faith you can pleas
[1:12:57] God the children of Israel displeased
[1:13:00] God because they did not believe the
[1:13:01] word of
[1:13:05] Moses if you want to find favor with God
[1:13:07] you got to believe His
[1:13:09] prophets you want find favor with God
[1:13:12] not just to believe but you got to apply
[1:13:14] what the prophet
[1:13:16] say the prophet of God says that a
[1:13:18] chrisan ought to go to be in the house
[1:13:20] of the Lord 30 minutes before service
[1:13:22] starts
[1:13:26] but unfortunately in this
[1:13:28] church we claim to be Believers of the
[1:13:32] Prophet I hope I'm not mistaken I hope
[1:13:35] we are all believing of the of Believers
[1:13:37] of the
[1:13:39] Prophet if you're not a believer I'm
[1:13:41] sorry I'm not speaking to you I'm
[1:13:42] speaking to
[1:13:45] Believers the prophet said we need to be
[1:13:47] in the house of the Lord 30 minutes
[1:13:49] before service
[1:13:51] start so we have to if we believe that
[1:13:54] we have to apply
[1:13:56] that Jesus says that if you love me you
[1:13:58] will keep my
[1:14:01] Commandments if you love The Prophet you
[1:14:04] will keep also his
[1:14:06] commandment because you understand that
[1:14:08] it's not a commandment made out of men
[1:14:10] but it's actually it's coming from
[1:14:14] God and God is so good that every time
[1:14:17] you keep his commandment he always gives
[1:14:18] you
[1:14:20] blessings if you want to see blessings
[1:14:22] in your life you got to apply the word
[1:14:26] you got to start coming to church 30
[1:14:27] minutes before
[1:14:29] service you know I was here last
[1:14:33] Sunday and I was really shocked to be
[1:14:36] honest that service is supposed to start
[1:14:38] at
[1:14:40] 10:30 there was hardly anybody
[1:14:43] here and then today same thing
[1:14:46] again don't be mad at me be mad at what
[1:14:49] the prophet is saying because it's not
[1:14:50] my
[1:14:51] word brother says you got to be in the
[1:14:54] house of the Lord 30 30 minutes
[1:14:56] before because it creates an
[1:15:00] atmosphere that's we got to create the
[1:15:02] atmosphere that when The Sinner walks in
[1:15:04] those doors he feels a
[1:15:09] conviction and we worry why we always we
[1:15:12] bring guests and they
[1:15:14] leave because you are not setting the
[1:15:18] atmosphere the prophet says that a re a
[1:15:20] Revival is not bringing new people but
[1:15:22] it's getting all the trust out of your
[1:15:24] lives
[1:15:27] and the and the Revival has to start
[1:15:29] with
[1:15:30] yourself you have to stop pointing the
[1:15:32] fingers of someone
[1:15:35] else look at
[1:15:37] yourself you know there's a reason why
[1:15:40] God says not to point the fingers at
[1:15:42] someone else but to point it back at
[1:15:47] yourself when you come to the house of
[1:15:49] the Lord you're not coming so you can
[1:15:51] point fingers oh this is for this person
[1:15:52] this is for that person
[1:15:56] I I come to church to receive my
[1:16:00] blessings you can be two of you guys
[1:16:02] coming to church one person goes out
[1:16:04] with a blessing and another person with
[1:16:05] his
[1:16:07] curse because the prophet says that
[1:16:09] every time you come to
[1:16:12] church you either go back a better
[1:16:14] person that you
[1:16:16] were or you go out worse then you came
[1:16:20] in so you need to examine your life this
[1:16:23] morning
[1:16:25] examine your Christian
[1:16:28] walk are you going forward with God or
[1:16:31] are you going
[1:16:33] backwards every time you come to church
[1:16:35] when you go out are you a better
[1:16:36] Christian than you were when you came
[1:16:39] in you may lie to to to your
[1:16:42] neighbor you may lie to me but one thing
[1:16:45] for sure you can never lie to
[1:16:48] yourself each and every one of us this
[1:16:50] morning right now you know that if today
[1:16:53] you were to die
[1:16:55] you know exactly if you're going to
[1:16:57] heaven or or
[1:17:01] hell you can't lie to me but you can
[1:17:04] never lie to
[1:17:07] yourself so stop pointing the fingers of
[1:17:10] someone else and look at
[1:17:13] yourself and when I'm preaching I'm not
[1:17:15] just preaching to you I'm preaching to
[1:17:16] myself as
[1:17:18] well the prophet says we need to come to
[1:17:20] church 30 minutes before
[1:17:25] do you not know that that Grieves the
[1:17:27] spirit of God when he comes to church on
[1:17:29] time and you guys are not on
[1:17:35] time it Grieves the spirit of
[1:17:38] God and God that's why you not seeing us
[1:17:41] blessings in your
[1:17:43] life grieving the spirit of
[1:17:46] God you are grieving the spirit of of
[1:17:49] God with your
[1:17:51] life always pointing fingers at someone
[1:17:53] else
[1:17:56] that's actually the spirit of the
[1:17:58] devil because the Bible says that the
[1:18:00] devil is the accusers of the
[1:18:02] Brethren the Bible says that the devil
[1:18:05] is accusing the Brethren day and
[1:18:11] night that the spirit you got to get rid
[1:18:14] of that
[1:18:17] spirit amen
[1:18:20] amen I I wasn't even in my notes I'm
[1:18:23] sorry
[1:18:26] amen amen all right let's get back to
[1:18:30] this so we're speaking about uh
[1:18:34] Moses and the pillow of
[1:18:40] fire yeah just get back to it again so
[1:18:43] you have to apply the
[1:18:45] word I'm speaking to you that you you
[1:18:48] from next Sunday whenever you guys have
[1:18:51] service we need to see a change
[1:18:55] because then there is no difference
[1:18:56] between just you could have just gone to
[1:18:58] any other churches like any other
[1:19:02] lodges are you just are you just hearing
[1:19:04] to play
[1:19:06] religion I I want a God that changes
[1:19:10] life when I come to church I come with
[1:19:12] the promise that wherever two or three
[1:19:14] are gathered in my name I shall be in
[1:19:16] the midst of
[1:19:18] them I believe that God is present
[1:19:21] here because God cannot lie
[1:19:25] the Bible says that God is man is not a
[1:19:27] man that he shall
[1:19:29] lie so if God said that he's here
[1:19:32] whenever two or three are gathered in
[1:19:34] his
[1:19:37] name we are gathered here in the name of
[1:19:39] the Lord Jesus
[1:19:40] Christ and he always keeps his
[1:19:43] word and whenever you are in the
[1:19:45] presence of
[1:19:47] God then you can ask what you will and
[1:19:49] he will give it to
[1:19:50] you you got to take advantage of being
[1:19:53] in the presence of God
[1:19:55] don't go the same person that came
[1:19:58] in that woman um The Prostitute woman
[1:20:02] that that that went to cry at the feet
[1:20:03] of
[1:20:05] Jesus she wasn't she wasn't even
[1:20:07] supposed to be there in the first
[1:20:10] place because the the law had said that
[1:20:13] if you commit adultery you shall be
[1:20:18] stoned and and nobody was taking care of
[1:20:22] Jesus they left Jesus out there in a
[1:20:24] corner by
[1:20:26] himself you know but that's this is what
[1:20:29] I love the prophet says that that God
[1:20:31] always keeps his
[1:20:35] appointment you can be assured today
[1:20:37] that God always keeps his
[1:20:42] appointment we have an appointment at
[1:20:44] 10:30 to be at church God always keeps
[1:20:46] that
[1:20:48] appointment but the prophet says that
[1:20:50] many time we leave Jesus with dirty feet
[1:20:52] in a corner
[1:20:57] Jesus want to see you on time but people
[1:20:59] just come to church like imagine at
[1:21:01] 10:30 when church is supposed to start
[1:21:03] that's when you wake
[1:21:08] up I'm telling you this morning that
[1:21:10] it's ging the spirit of
[1:21:12] God and you got to
[1:21:16] repent you know it's it may it may seem
[1:21:20] little to you but it's those little
[1:21:22] things sometimes that matters
[1:21:27] amen
[1:21:29] amen so the prophet in the message God
[1:21:31] reach who rich in
[1:21:36] Mercy in paragraph
[1:21:39] 76 um he says that now God always
[1:21:42] lacking His prophets to
[1:21:50] Eagles Moses was his messenger
[1:21:55] they were following
[1:21:57] Moses know and that that was the Eagle
[1:22:00] wings that they were carried
[1:22:04] on and the people followed
[1:22:07] that they were following God as they
[1:22:10] followed
[1:22:12] Moses with his message of Deliverance
[1:22:15] not he says they were following God as
[1:22:17] they were following
[1:22:22] Moses that's why Paul says be ye follow
[1:22:24] follow of me as I'm follower as I'm
[1:22:26] follower of
[1:22:30] Christ so we're following the message of
[1:22:32] William Bram as he's following Jesus
[1:22:36] Christ remember that when he had that
[1:22:38] Vision that he went to
[1:22:40] heaven those people that went there they
[1:22:43] told him that he was the leader of that
[1:22:45] of that
[1:22:49] group if you want to go to the same
[1:22:51] place you have to follow the leader
[1:22:55] he will lead you there and I'm not
[1:22:57] talking about the man of William
[1:23:00] Bram but I'm talking of the Angel of the
[1:23:02] lord inside of the man William
[1:23:07] Bram the angel of the Lord will lead
[1:23:11] you amen he's the same Angel of the Lord
[1:23:14] that led the children of
[1:23:18] Israel amen I'm just going to read a
[1:23:21] chapter here real quick
[1:23:25] um it's in the book of Exodus exod yeah
[1:23:29] Exodus chap 23: 20
[1:23:34] exod the Bible
[1:23:37] says so behold I sent an angel before
[1:23:41] thee to keep thee in the way and to
[1:23:44] bring thee into the place which I have
[1:23:48] prepared I repeat it again behold I sent
[1:23:51] an angel before thee
[1:23:54] to keep thee in the way and to bring
[1:23:57] thee into the place which I have
[1:24:01] prepared prepared a place for the
[1:24:03] children of
[1:24:05] Israel and that angel was the person
[1:24:07] that had to lead
[1:24:09] them they had a
[1:24:12] promise and be aware of him and obey his
[1:24:17] voice I'm just I'm just noticing it he's
[1:24:20] saying obey his voice that angel
[1:24:25] firee
[1:24:27] voice but then when the the pill of fire
[1:24:30] was speaking they couldn't hear so how
[1:24:32] can I obey a voice that I cannot
[1:24:38] hear behold I send my angel before thee
[1:24:41] obey his voice obey the
[1:24:44] messenger obey the prophet of the
[1:24:47] age because he has the voice of the
[1:24:50] Angel provoke him
[1:24:53] not for he will not pardon your
[1:24:56] transgressions for my name is in
[1:25:00] him but if thou shall indeed obey his
[1:25:04] voice and do all that is all that I
[1:25:09] speak that's why I
[1:25:11] said even those little things pay
[1:25:14] attention to them because the Bible did
[1:25:17] not say if you shall keep some that he
[1:25:19] that he
[1:25:22] speaks he said all
[1:25:25] know Eve fell because she left one
[1:25:29] word we got to take the whole
[1:25:33] world you know so they getting back to
[1:25:36] that
[1:25:37] again coming to church on
[1:25:40] time right if you shall obey his voice
[1:25:44] there there are benefits to obeying the
[1:25:45] voice of the
[1:25:52] angel and those are the benefits then I
[1:25:54] will be an enemy unto thy
[1:25:59] enemies and an adversary unto thy
[1:26:05] adversary your enemy is not your
[1:26:07] brother your enem is are those
[1:26:10] principalities those spirits that are
[1:26:12] fighting
[1:26:15] you you know all the all those sickness
[1:26:18] that you having those anxiety
[1:26:22] depression even those spirit of
[1:26:25] lust you know that that's actually a
[1:26:27] very stubborn
[1:26:29] demon the spirit of lust is a very very
[1:26:33] stubborn
[1:26:35] demon you know but but it's not too
[1:26:38] stubborn for the
[1:26:40] Lord God is more he that is in you is
[1:26:42] greater than he that's in the
[1:26:45] world I have seen the demon of last
[1:26:49] before he was in a camp we went to a
[1:26:51] camp
[1:26:52] meeting I had a friend of mine that I
[1:26:54] was witnessing to to God
[1:26:58] about and he was dealing with spirit of
[1:27:03] pornography and that's actually very
[1:27:05] common among young children young people
[1:27:10] today so whoever you are today who's
[1:27:12] dealing with that Spirit listen to
[1:27:14] this you got first know that you have
[1:27:17] the the Bible says in know the prophet
[1:27:19] says in order to overcome Satan you got
[1:27:21] to first know that Satan is real
[1:27:26] you got to recognize that this is a
[1:27:29] demon oh I have a disease no let's call
[1:27:32] it by it's called cancer or something no
[1:27:35] it's a
[1:27:36] demon unless you recognize that it's a
[1:27:39] demon you're not going to overcome
[1:27:41] it if you're dealing with lust you got
[1:27:43] to first know that it's a demon in order
[1:27:45] to overcome that
[1:27:49] demon so they they have a they had a
[1:27:52] prayer line that that they had
[1:27:55] and in those prayer line they were
[1:27:56] praying for people demons getting cast
[1:27:57] out and all sort of
[1:27:59] things and I noticed that um he I I
[1:28:04] won't say his name so he walked through
[1:28:05] the the
[1:28:06] line and it seems like nothing happened
[1:28:09] to him so I was a bit worried because I
[1:28:12] thought like he was going to be agitated
[1:28:14] and all those
[1:28:17] stuff but after after he went down he he
[1:28:21] sat on his chair and and he just bowed
[1:28:23] his head
[1:28:26] but later on um um a brother gave a
[1:28:29] testimony that while he was walking
[1:28:32] through the prayer
[1:28:35] line the brother did not see my friend
[1:28:38] walking but he saw a demon that was
[1:28:41] walking in
[1:28:42] the so you can never hide yourself in
[1:28:45] the presence of
[1:28:48] God and so what one thing I love is that
[1:28:50] there were some kids probably like 14 15
[1:28:53] year old they went and they laid hands
[1:28:55] on
[1:28:58] him and the demon and the demon started
[1:29:01] going
[1:29:02] crazy he wasn't no it wasn't a minister
[1:29:05] that laid their hands on
[1:29:09] him some
[1:29:11] kids so young children God can also use
[1:29:14] you Jesus at the age of 12 years old he
[1:29:17] was already uh uh serving
[1:29:20] God you are never too young to serve God
[1:29:25] you just have to yield yourself and let
[1:29:27] God use
[1:29:28] you and parents you need to encourage
[1:29:31] your children to serve the Lord at a
[1:29:33] young
[1:29:34] age that's why the Bible tell says to
[1:29:37] start them while they're young to train
[1:29:39] them in the way that they
[1:29:43] should uh there was a there was a king
[1:29:45] in the Bible I think he became king at
[1:29:47] the age of
[1:29:49] 12
[1:29:51] Jah he became a king at the age of of
[1:29:55] 12 so God can use
[1:29:58] you God can use all those young children
[1:30:02] here going back to the story and then
[1:30:05] all of a sudden um so the the demon was
[1:30:09] going crazy
[1:30:10] but like we couldn't nobody know what
[1:30:12] kind knew what kind of spirit that
[1:30:16] was and I didn't know because I was I
[1:30:19] was in the back and there were like it
[1:30:20] was like 600 people
[1:30:24] but I noticed there was a commotion
[1:30:26] somewhere
[1:30:27] there and uh but the brother who saw
[1:30:30] that
[1:30:31] demon he went and called the demon by
[1:30:36] name then the demon started
[1:30:39] speaking and the demon started speaking
[1:30:41] he saying he's not going to
[1:30:43] go you know and that was a spirit of
[1:30:46] love so you have so he took that brother
[1:30:48] who knew who God gave him Grace to see
[1:30:50] what that Spirit was
[1:30:54] that is why the prophet says that you
[1:30:55] need to confess your
[1:30:58] sins because he says we can't pour pour
[1:31:01] as much oil on you and pray but if you
[1:31:03] don't confess the sin the demon is not
[1:31:05] going to
[1:31:07] go the proph says that when you confess
[1:31:10] your sins the uh uh you the devil is
[1:31:14] losing his
[1:31:16] grips but as long as you want to hide
[1:31:19] the spirit in
[1:31:21] you he's never going to leave you he's
[1:31:24] going to destroy your
[1:31:26] life lust destroy people's
[1:31:29] lives last even destroy
[1:31:33] marriages a very stubborn demon this is
[1:31:37] not in my not so someone here must be
[1:31:39] dealing with
[1:31:40] last but you got to take it as a grace
[1:31:42] of God to you that he he's dealing with
[1:31:44] you right
[1:31:47] now but you got to confess that
[1:31:50] demon because if you do not confess the
[1:31:52] demon he will never
[1:31:55] go and eventually they and oh yeah so
[1:31:58] there was one thing so they brought a
[1:32:00] picture of um yeah they brought that
[1:32:02] picture of William Bram with a pill of
[1:32:06] fire and they showed this to the demon I
[1:32:10] was there myself I saw this and like he
[1:32:13] he didn't want to look at the picture he
[1:32:15] was just
[1:32:16] like you know and then in order for for
[1:32:20] for Satan for in order for my friend to
[1:32:23] speak you had to command the devil and
[1:32:25] tell him abund you in the name of Jesus
[1:32:27] Christ let him speak then you could hear
[1:32:29] my friend's voice
[1:32:39] speaking bind that
[1:32:42] Spirit In The Name of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:45] tell um and then and then tell him to
[1:32:48] let uh that friend speak I I I'm close
[1:32:51] to saying that person's name but I don't
[1:32:53] want to say his name
[1:32:56] and I have witnesses you can ask like we
[1:32:58] I was there the few people that came so
[1:33:00] they also that and um yeah so that and
[1:33:04] then that that that also taught me a
[1:33:06] lesson because when he was speaking he
[1:33:09] was it was that friend's vocal Cod so it
[1:33:11] was his
[1:33:12] voice but it wasn't him speaking it was
[1:33:15] the demon
[1:33:17] speaking so I was like wait a minute so
[1:33:21] even when you see your brother your
[1:33:22] sister criticizing you
[1:33:25] it's not your brother criticizing
[1:33:28] you it's that demon inside of him that's
[1:33:31] criticizing
[1:33:32] you that's why you got to love the
[1:33:36] person and then you can't
[1:33:38] overcome by
[1:33:40] love because when he spoke you hear his
[1:33:44] voice okay there was one instance so
[1:33:47] they told him um confess with your mouth
[1:33:49] that Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior
[1:33:54] and he said Satan is my Lord
[1:33:59] and then the brothers understand that I
[1:34:01] was in him speaking that was the
[1:34:04] demon and they rebuke the devil
[1:34:08] again so you got to you got to look past
[1:34:11] those criticism just see that it's a
[1:34:13] demon inside of your
[1:34:15] brother if someone want to hurt it's not
[1:34:19] themselves they anointed by a spirits to
[1:34:21] hurt
[1:34:22] you you got to pray for that person
[1:34:26] because he possessed of a
[1:34:28] demon but yeah fast forward that Spirit
[1:34:30] was cast
[1:34:32] out I know that a demon of last that
[1:34:35] last is
[1:34:38] a young man if you struggl struggling
[1:34:41] with pornography you are carrying a
[1:34:45] demon and the demon is going to hunt you
[1:34:48] until you confess that
[1:34:52] demon so up to
[1:34:54] you either you want to be free or you
[1:34:56] want to keep strugg struggling with
[1:35:00] him and don't be afraid because Jesus is
[1:35:03] more powerful than that
[1:35:07] demon there is not any devil here that's
[1:35:09] more powerful than Jesus
[1:35:12] Christ he said that in my name you shall
[1:35:14] cast out
[1:35:16] demons even
[1:35:18] cancer even
[1:35:20] HIV even pornography pornography
[1:35:25] anxiety every demon that's not confessed
[1:35:27] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can
[1:35:29] be cast
[1:35:32] out we don't believe in just a a God
[1:35:35] that doesn't exist God is God is
[1:35:40] real as much as those demons are real
[1:35:42] God is also
[1:35:47] real who who want to be a a person bound
[1:35:50] all your life you always bound bound
[1:35:52] bound
[1:35:53] [Music]
[1:35:55] I remember I remember a man in the
[1:35:58] Bible the the man of
[1:36:01] G you know he was full of a lot of
[1:36:04] demons Legions of
[1:36:06] demons and those demons the prophet
[1:36:09] explains that he started he didn't start
[1:36:10] all of a sudden he was full of demon he
[1:36:12] came with one
[1:36:14] demon and that demon allowed another
[1:36:18] demon and then he brought another demon
[1:36:21] and then before he could understand he
[1:36:23] was full of demons in
[1:36:25] him so those little bad habits you are
[1:36:28] leing in your
[1:36:29] Liv he always T little and then you
[1:36:32] start noticing that you you start going
[1:36:34] crazy crazy crazy
[1:36:38] crazy so cast that demon while he's
[1:36:41] still young don't wait for the demon to
[1:36:44] become
[1:36:47] strong but then when he came to
[1:36:50] Jesus those demon had to obey to obey
[1:36:53] the voice of
[1:36:55] Jesus Jesus was the pillow of fire made
[1:37:00] flesh it doesn't it didn't matter if
[1:37:02] that man had a million demons in
[1:37:05] him the prophet said that when those
[1:37:07] demons came to
[1:37:09] Jesus they felt a different sort of
[1:37:12] electricity they noticed that this was
[1:37:14] the word this person was not like any of
[1:37:17] the prophet he was the word himself made
[1:37:20] flesh and those demon had to obey the
[1:37:23] the voice of
[1:37:24] God Jesus is the same yesterday today
[1:37:27] and
[1:37:28] forever whatever demons you have those
[1:37:31] demons have to obey the voice of
[1:37:34] God in the name of Jesus Christ de those
[1:37:37] demons got to
[1:37:40] go um uh my first sermon that I preach
[1:37:42] in
[1:37:44] De there is one quotes where the Prophet
[1:37:46] says that Satan already lost all his
[1:37:50] power
[1:37:53] he does not have any jurisdiction over
[1:37:55] you
[1:37:56] anymore jurisdiction means legal
[1:38:00] Authority the prophet
[1:38:02] said but you you are the one who gives
[1:38:05] him back that
[1:38:07] Authority when you hide your
[1:38:11] sins you Satan is already at the cross
[1:38:14] when Jesus died he took he he he took
[1:38:16] every everything from
[1:38:19] Satan but the prophet say you are the
[1:38:22] one that gives him back that
[1:38:26] so if you want to be free it's really up
[1:38:28] it's in your
[1:38:29] hands you got to confess those
[1:38:33] Spirits those Spirit of Darkness the
[1:38:37] prophet even says that it's hard to
[1:38:39] preach when there's a congregation full
[1:38:41] of that dark
[1:38:43] spirit it's hard for the anointing the
[1:38:45] presence of God to fall because of
[1:38:47] people full of
[1:38:51] demons but in the presence of of the
[1:38:53] light all Darkness have to
[1:38:57] flee the light has come in our
[1:39:00] day it's not just some words we've seen
[1:39:02] the
[1:39:03] light and the same pill of fire is here
[1:39:06] right now to expose The Works of the
[1:39:10] enemy just obey his voice then he will
[1:39:14] fight your
[1:39:15] battles he will stand between you and
[1:39:18] evil is that we just read that's the
[1:39:21] word of God
[1:39:25] and God's word the Bible says it's not
[1:39:27] it's never going to return void it's
[1:39:29] always going to accomplish the purpose
[1:39:30] for
[1:39:33] which if you don't believe ask God to
[1:39:36] give you Faith to believe his
[1:39:39] word I was reading one one message where
[1:39:42] the Prophet is telling the people if you
[1:39:43] not have if you don't have enough faith
[1:39:45] for this ask God to perform a surgery in
[1:39:48] your heart and give you faith
[1:39:53] only please God by
[1:39:55] faith so if you don't have faith ask him
[1:39:59] you have not because you ask
[1:40:02] not and you ask you you ask not because
[1:40:05] you believe
[1:40:07] not and you believe not because your
[1:40:09] motive and objective are in the wrong
[1:40:12] place that's what the Bible
[1:40:14] says but as long as you know in your
[1:40:16] motive the Bible says that we are the
[1:40:19] Temple of of God to present our body as
[1:40:23] uh holy and acceptable is Living
[1:40:26] Sacrifice acceptable to God and that's
[1:40:30] our reasonable
[1:40:31] service so you are struggling with
[1:40:35] lust but so when you ask God you know
[1:40:38] that your purpose is correct because you
[1:40:39] want to present your body holy before
[1:40:44] God and and and and and we see the
[1:40:46] prophet says that God doesn't change the
[1:40:48] way he deals deals with
[1:40:51] things we see that aen had seen that he
[1:40:55] was hiding in the
[1:40:58] camp God had made the promise to the
[1:41:00] children of Israel that he will go fight
[1:41:02] their
[1:41:04] battles but then they started noticing
[1:41:06] that soldiers were falling dying and
[1:41:09] people were
[1:41:14] dying the problem wasn't with God's
[1:41:17] promise the problem is never with the
[1:41:19] promise promise of God God is always
[1:41:22] true with his
[1:41:24] promise but the the problem was that
[1:41:26] there was sin in the
[1:41:28] camp this church can never go forward if
[1:41:31] there's sin in the
[1:41:35] camp God does not change his
[1:41:38] ways if there's one person here living
[1:41:40] an ungodly
[1:41:42] life God is here to tell you that he's
[1:41:44] seeing what you're
[1:41:46] doing and you are causing this church to
[1:41:48] not move forward with God because of
[1:41:50] your sins
[1:41:53] if you do not repent you will die just
[1:41:55] like aen
[1:41:57] did it's in your
[1:42:00] hands God God is such a merciful
[1:42:03] god that he always gives you the choice
[1:42:05] to choose between him and not and
[1:42:08] and God is a gentleman he's never going
[1:42:11] to force you to
[1:42:13] repent God is never going to force you
[1:42:15] to
[1:42:16] repent he gives you the choice you know
[1:42:21] I remember in the Bible says choose you
[1:42:23] is day whom you will
[1:42:25] serve a choice that you have brother bam
[1:42:29] is not going to choose this for
[1:42:31] you that's why he preach on the message
[1:42:33] the choosing of a bride
[1:42:36] too in that in the message says that we
[1:42:39] we have even we have to pray for the
[1:42:41] choice of a bride of a church of
[1:42:43] anything we do in our
[1:42:45] Liv preach the message time of
[1:42:50] decisions he did not just he didn't not
[1:42:52] pray those message just for
[1:42:54] fun you have a
[1:42:56] choice choose you this
[1:42:59] day who you will
[1:43:01] serve either you're going to continue to
[1:43:03] serve that
[1:43:05] spirit either you're going to continue
[1:43:07] to serve those
[1:43:10] demons either either you're going to
[1:43:12] serve you're going to worship those
[1:43:14] demons or you will serve
[1:43:17] God I'm not going to force you to
[1:43:21] choose but I know that for me me and my
[1:43:24] house for myself I choose the
[1:43:27] Lord I will serve the
[1:43:30] Lord you need to come to that
[1:43:33] resolution you need to come to that to
[1:43:35] that position where you choose the
[1:43:38] Lord then he fights your
[1:43:41] battles then he stands between you and
[1:43:44] evil Just Like a Pill of fire stood
[1:43:46] between the Egyptians and the children
[1:43:48] of
[1:43:49] God he is the same yesterday today and
[1:43:52] forever
[1:43:54] if you obey the voice of the
[1:43:56] angel that pillow fire that you're
[1:43:58] seeing on that
[1:44:00] picture is going to stand between you
[1:44:02] and
[1:44:04] Satan even when you go to work Satan is
[1:44:06] going to battle
[1:44:08] you when you go shopping Satan is going
[1:44:10] to battle
[1:44:12] you Satan is not after his own people
[1:44:15] he's after
[1:44:16] you the prophet says that all the
[1:44:19] weapons of hell are
[1:44:23] at the the bride of
[1:44:26] Christ so Satan is using his best
[1:44:29] weapons and targeting it to
[1:44:33] you the prophet said that if Satan is
[1:44:36] not after you then he's already got
[1:44:38] you so all these resources are targeting
[1:44:41] at you stop looking at your neighbor
[1:44:44] look at you you a target of the
[1:44:47] devil but if you obey the voice of the
[1:44:51] Angel nothing for me for Forge against
[1:44:54] you shall
[1:44:57] prosper he'll stand between you just
[1:44:59] like he stood with the children of
[1:45:04] Israel even when there's a destruction
[1:45:06] that's coming up on the
[1:45:08] earth the angel of the Lord is going to
[1:45:11] come down and take
[1:45:12] you and hide you in the secret place I
[1:45:16] think the David says he shall hide me in
[1:45:19] his
[1:45:21] Pavilion but the only comes when you
[1:45:23] listen to the voice of
[1:45:26] God those are the benefits of listening
[1:45:29] to the voice of
[1:45:30] theel choose you this day um whom you
[1:45:34] will
[1:45:35] serve but I know that I choose to serve
[1:45:39] the
[1:45:40] Lord you know this morning you need to
[1:45:42] come to the resolution that I I come to
[1:45:44] church for myself
[1:45:48] first I don't care if my brother don't
[1:45:51] want to get his Blessing I want to get
[1:45:52] my
[1:45:54] bless Jacob when he met the angel of the
[1:45:57] Lord he said I'm not leaving you till
[1:46:00] you give me my
[1:46:02] blessings this message came with
[1:46:05] blessings don't fall short of those
[1:46:08] blessings the prophet says that many
[1:46:11] times we don't have things because we
[1:46:12] are afraid to ask God for those
[1:46:15] things the prophet say ask God for big
[1:46:19] things don't fall short don't be you
[1:46:23] have benefits with believing this
[1:46:26] message if you receive the prophet as a
[1:46:28] prophet then you receive his reward as
[1:46:32] well and his reward was that nothing
[1:46:34] shall stand against his
[1:46:37] prayer if you put the word of God in
[1:46:39] your
[1:46:40] mouth you accept the word of God in your
[1:46:43] heart I'm here to tell you that nothing
[1:46:46] will stand against your
[1:46:48] prayer you have loved ones that you want
[1:46:50] to be saved
[1:46:54] speak the word and they're going to come
[1:46:57] back because there's a place where the
[1:46:59] Prophet says that that same voice of
[1:47:04] God you know the same way the prophet is
[1:47:06] a voice of God to us we also become the
[1:47:09] voice of God to the
[1:47:12] world the voice is in the
[1:47:15] pr the move did not just stop with
[1:47:18] William
[1:47:19] Bram brother Bram says that you might
[1:47:22] kill this the
[1:47:23] man you can kill the man but you never
[1:47:27] going to kill the
[1:47:29] message brother bam said it's
[1:47:31] taped it's put on those tapes Brothers
[1:47:35] these tapes are not words of a man it's
[1:47:37] a word of the Angel of the
[1:47:38] [Applause]
[1:47:40] Lord have a habit of listening to the
[1:47:44] message listen to The Prophet at
[1:47:47] home that's when you get your
[1:47:49] blessings I've heard testimonies of
[1:47:52] people get getting healed while
[1:47:53] listening to the prayer
[1:47:56] line because why
[1:47:59] why because God is never the god of the
[1:48:01] past but he always the I
[1:48:04] am these ts are not just for the past
[1:48:07] it's the living
[1:48:09] bread Living Word of
[1:48:12] God if it could change the life of
[1:48:14] prostitutes in the in the time of
[1:48:15] brother
[1:48:17] Bram can also change your
[1:48:20] lives If he if you could give other
[1:48:22] people the Holy Ghost he will give you
[1:48:24] the Holy
[1:48:25] Ghost Jesus Is Not Dead Jesus is
[1:48:29] Alive and the voice is not in is now in
[1:48:32] the
[1:48:33] bride the only way the world can see
[1:48:36] Jesus is through
[1:48:38] you the Bible says be ye the light of
[1:48:41] the
[1:48:42] world but the Bible says that the light
[1:48:44] is the word of God
[1:48:47] manifested the word of God made
[1:48:50] flesh there's Darkness all over the
[1:48:53] Earth but the prophet says that God
[1:48:56] always keeps a
[1:48:58] witness why can't that be
[1:49:01] me why can that be me I want to be the
[1:49:05] witness I want to be the witness for
[1:49:08] God the only way the world will see God
[1:49:11] they're going to see God through
[1:49:15] you the light of God shine in your
[1:49:19] life as as much as you are exposed to
[1:49:22] the Sun the Sun is going to change
[1:49:24] you just stay exposed to the Lord Jesus
[1:49:27] Christ is going to change
[1:49:29] you to those
[1:49:31] Tes it's not a ties of
[1:49:35] man amen amen I'm going to read this one
[1:49:38] course real
[1:49:40] quick amen
[1:49:57] in the message my commission message
[1:50:00] myiss to wrap up soon the prophet
[1:50:04] says I am just your brother by the grace
[1:50:07] of
[1:50:09] God but when the angel of the Lord moves
[1:50:15] down it becomes then a voice of God to
[1:50:20] you when the Ang of the Lord moves down
[1:50:24] it becomes then a voice of God to
[1:50:28] you no remember the prophet says that
[1:50:31] Moses had times that he was Moses and
[1:50:34] there were times he became God to the
[1:50:38] people so when you listen to this St you
[1:50:40] got to be able to tell the
[1:50:42] difference pay attention to this quote
[1:50:44] this this quot is a very example of the
[1:50:47] um of that
[1:50:49] topic so right after the prophet said
[1:50:52] that
[1:50:53] he said maybe if I offended you by
[1:50:56] saying that forgive
[1:50:58] me so now this is William BR I'm
[1:51:01] speaking he saying if I offended you by
[1:51:05] saying that forgive
[1:51:06] me I felt that my has been
[1:51:14] resented but I'm God's voice to
[1:51:19] you and he said see I say that again and
[1:51:22] he
[1:51:23] said he said that time that was under
[1:51:28] inspiration he said I felt bad about it
[1:51:31] the first
[1:51:33] time but that voice repeated
[1:51:37] again he wasn't the prophet who said I'm
[1:51:40] God's voice to
[1:51:41] you the angel of the
[1:51:44] Lord using a man's
[1:51:47] voice he said I am God's voice to
[1:51:51] you William Bram the man said I'm sorry
[1:51:55] if I offended
[1:51:57] you but the angel of the Lord said don't
[1:51:59] be sorry I am God's voice to
[1:52:03] [Music]
[1:52:05] you so this message is is the voice of
[1:52:08] God to
[1:52:11] you and and and the voice of God is a
[1:52:17] person the voice of God is a
[1:52:20] person the Bible says that the voice of
[1:52:22] God was walking amen God bless
[1:52:25] you the voice of God is a
[1:52:28] person that pill of fire is a
[1:52:31] person that same pill of fire that
[1:52:33] appeared to
[1:52:35] Moses he appeared in our days in
[1:52:40] 1963 and if you can project the the
[1:52:44] image you know so Moses wanted to see
[1:52:46] the face of
[1:52:48] God Moses wanted to see the glory of God
[1:52:52] but was like I'm reserving this for
[1:52:54] special
[1:52:55] people in the end time there shall be
[1:52:58] some people that shall see my voice my
[1:53:01] face in the time of Moses to see the
[1:53:03] face of God meant
[1:53:07] death but where are you not
[1:53:09] dead you have seen the face of
[1:53:13] God you have seen the face of
[1:53:16] God can you project that picture please
[1:53:27] am amen uh it's a picture we don't have
[1:53:31] a cloud a picture of a cloud here it's
[1:53:33] right in front yeah but this one is not
[1:53:37] really the one I want um I give you a
[1:53:39] picture there
[1:53:42] um all
[1:53:45] right but yeah I'll get back to you
[1:53:47] while you guys figure it out um so
[1:53:51] Abraham also heard the
[1:53:55] voice Abraham heard the voice and he
[1:53:57] trusted the
[1:53:59] voice Abraham had never seen the voice
[1:54:03] but he trusted the
[1:54:05] voice and because he trust the voice
[1:54:07] told him to get out of idol
[1:54:12] worship he never saw that voice and he
[1:54:15] and then that's what the voice of God
[1:54:16] will do to you the voice of God will
[1:54:19] always bring you out of that bad
[1:54:20] position that you were in
[1:54:24] Lazarus was another person who who heard
[1:54:26] the voice of
[1:54:27] God Lazarus was dead four
[1:54:31] days you know and his body started
[1:54:35] corrupting but it did not matter which
[1:54:37] condition Lazarus was
[1:54:39] in brothers and sisters it doesn't
[1:54:42] matter what condition you are in the
[1:54:44] voice of God will resurrect you the
[1:54:47] voice of God will change you you just
[1:54:50] need to listen to the voice of God
[1:54:54] so Abraham heard the voice of God but
[1:54:56] one day he saw three men three men
[1:54:59] coming to
[1:55:01] him and the prophet says that when you
[1:55:03] heard one of the Angels
[1:55:05] said where is thy wife
[1:55:09] Sarah the prophet says that Abraham
[1:55:11] recognized the
[1:55:13] voice he said it was the same voice that
[1:55:15] spoke to me all those
[1:55:18] times William Bram also when he was a
[1:55:21] kid
[1:55:22] he heard a voice he never seen the voice
[1:55:26] he heard the voice the voice telling him
[1:55:29] you shall not drink you shall not defile
[1:55:31] your
[1:55:32] body but there was one time he seen the
[1:55:36] voice let me just read that quotes real
[1:55:41] [Music]
[1:55:44] quick
[1:55:46] okay one
[1:55:50] second okay so in the message gifts and
[1:55:52] calling all without repentance just keep
[1:55:54] you can put the quot and we'll get to
[1:55:56] this picture so the prophet says he's
[1:55:58] describing the experience when he met
[1:56:00] the angel of the
[1:56:03] Lord he said I was studying I was sing
[1:56:06] in my
[1:56:08] study I seen the light spread out on the
[1:56:13] floor he came walking to
[1:56:17] me he looked like a
[1:56:20] man that weighed 200
[1:56:23] lb and this light was just above
[1:56:27] me and he had his arms
[1:56:30] folded he had a look as you don't see on
[1:56:33] on the face of a
[1:56:36] mortal he looked very calm and
[1:56:41] quiet and then he says his voice when he
[1:56:45] spoke I knew it was the same voice that
[1:56:49] I had spoke that had spoke all down
[1:56:51] through life's
[1:56:54] journey but I had never seen his
[1:56:57] face you know he heard the
[1:57:01] voice so just like Abraham William Bram
[1:57:03] also heard the voice he trusted the
[1:57:06] voice but he had never seen the face
[1:57:09] there got to be I feel like there's
[1:57:10] something special about seeing the
[1:57:13] face because Moses also wanted to see
[1:57:16] the
[1:57:17] face and William me said I I knew the
[1:57:20] voice but I never seen the the
[1:57:24] face and I'll he says and and he says
[1:57:28] and he say and and when paragraph 18 He
[1:57:30] said do not
[1:57:32] fear when that voice
[1:57:35] spoke I knew it was the same
[1:57:40] one so this
[1:57:42] light that you see on these pictures is
[1:57:45] the same fire that appeared to
[1:57:48] Moses in the burning
[1:57:50] bush it's the same fire that stood
[1:57:53] between evil and good the children of
[1:57:55] Israel and the
[1:57:58] Egyptian the same light that Jesus said
[1:58:01] I come from God and I'm returning back
[1:58:03] to
[1:58:05] God it's the same lights that Paul met
[1:58:08] on the way to
[1:58:10] Damascus we have a special message in
[1:58:12] our
[1:58:13] hands the same God of Jehovah of the Old
[1:58:17] Testament Jesus Christ of the New
[1:58:19] Testament he's alive and well Among Us
[1:58:24] in the Old Testament seeing the face
[1:58:26] meant
[1:58:29] death but you go back to that
[1:58:36] picture
[1:58:38] okay yeah and then I'll read this you
[1:58:42] keep this picture so the prophet in the
[1:58:43] message it is the rising of the
[1:58:46] sun he said if you'll just turn the
[1:58:48] picture like this and look
[1:58:53] you can probably see it from the
[1:58:57] audience it's
[1:59:00] Christ it's the word made
[1:59:03] flesh this is not any other being this
[1:59:06] is
[1:59:07] Christ and he said see his eyes
[1:59:12] looking I'm asking you this morning are
[1:59:15] you guys seeing the eyes of
[1:59:18] God you know just as perfect as he could
[1:59:21] be perfect per wearing the white wig of
[1:59:25] supreme authority and judge all of all
[1:59:29] Heavens in
[1:59:32] Earth he came down as a judge Supreme
[1:59:36] judge so the devil cannot condemn you
[1:59:39] anymore because God is both judge and a
[1:59:43] lawyer Jesus is saying that I they never
[1:59:46] did this in the first place
[1:59:52] charge against God's
[1:59:54] elect I I will never I will not remember
[1:59:57] the sins
[1:59:59] anymore supreme
[2:00:01] authority and he says can you see his
[2:00:04] eyes you know can you see his
[2:00:08] nose can you see his mouth and the Bible
[2:00:11] say the T says the congregation says
[2:00:14] [Music]
[2:00:15] amen so you you are are witness if you
[2:00:19] cannot see don't say Amen
[2:00:22] but if you can see his eyes say
[2:00:25] amen God is telling you that this
[2:00:28] message is the
[2:00:30] truth this message is the voice of God
[2:00:32] to you this message is the grace of
[2:00:36] God Mes in the Old Testament he came
[2:00:39] with two tables with a message of
[2:00:43] law but brother Bram brought us a
[2:00:45] message of
[2:00:47] Grace and I'll qu I'll end with this
[2:00:49] quote
[2:00:52] thanks for being patient with
[2:00:55] me I skipped quite a lot of things
[2:01:00] here the prophet says in the message
[2:01:03] blind
[2:01:07] barus paragraph
[2:01:10] 323 he says I challenge your faith to
[2:01:15] that don't believe me believe
[2:01:18] him cuz I'm just a man
[2:01:22] just like this
[2:01:24] microphone it isn't a microphone you're
[2:01:28] hearing it's my voice and he says it
[2:01:31] isn't me that you are
[2:01:34] hearing it's
[2:01:37] him so when you when you press play on
[2:01:39] those tapes it's not William Bram that
[2:01:41] you're
[2:01:44] hearing it's God that you are
[2:01:47] hearing the Bible says that men shall
[2:01:49] not live by bread alone
[2:01:53] but they shall live by every word that
[2:01:56] proceed every
[2:01:59] word we've said a lot of amens this
[2:02:01] morning but we got to start coming to
[2:02:03] church on
[2:02:06] time every
[2:02:08] word that's life to
[2:02:10] you you know because God God doesn't
[2:02:13] waste his
[2:02:15] word God doesn't just say things just to
[2:02:17] for the sake of saying
[2:02:20] it no
[2:02:23] and the this one other quotes um it's a
[2:02:26] small quote
[2:02:34] too okay um in the
[2:02:37] message the Waters of
[2:02:39] Separation The Prophet says someday I
[2:02:42] got to meet you
[2:02:44] everyone and Alm Mighty God knows that
[2:02:47] that
[2:02:48] light that you seen on that picture so
[2:02:52] I'm speaking to you this morning that
[2:02:53] light that you see on that
[2:02:55] picture is standing not two feet from
[2:02:58] where I am right
[2:03:00] now he said that's the
[2:03:03] truth you got to have the attitude of
[2:03:06] heading
[2:03:07] right say it's nothing else but the
[2:03:10] truth by you acknowledging the truth it
[2:03:13] just pleases God so much that he has to
[2:03:15] come down and blesses
[2:03:17] you God loves when you say Amen to his
[2:03:19] word
[2:03:21] he's like ask whatever you
[2:03:24] want right just said it's nothing else
[2:03:27] but the truth
[2:03:29] but but God told her that anything you
[2:03:31] want I'll give it to
[2:03:32] you and the prophet said it is moving
[2:03:36] into my right
[2:03:39] side and then in another quote he says
[2:03:42] and while I'm talking about it that same
[2:03:44] light that's on that
[2:03:47] picture it's not standing not two feet
[2:03:50] from where I'm standing right
[2:03:53] now I can't see it with my
[2:03:57] eyes but I know it's standing
[2:04:00] here and he said I know it's settling
[2:04:03] within me right
[2:04:07] now he said oh if you could only know
[2:04:09] the difference when the power of
[2:04:12] almighty
[2:04:16] God he says and how things look
[2:04:20] different
[2:04:23] that's why he was able to say I take
[2:04:25] every Spirit under my
[2:04:27] control he was the angel of the
[2:04:30] Lord the angel of the Lord wasn't there
[2:04:32] just there to to protect the man he was
[2:04:35] there to protect the message as
[2:04:37] well wherever the message of the hour is
[2:04:41] preached the angel of the Lord is
[2:04:45] there so when the angel of the Lord is
[2:04:47] there it's up to you to
[2:04:49] believe and when you believe there is a
[2:04:52] reward that comes with believing
[2:04:54] that the reward is ask what you will and
[2:04:58] it shall be given God is not putting any
[2:05:02] limits Jesus is a just God if he did it
[2:05:06] for heing right he will do it for you if
[2:05:09] you believe the message of the hour and
[2:05:12] then you also say it's nothing else but
[2:05:14] the
[2:05:15] truth God is telling you ask what you
[2:05:18] will it will be given to you if you want
[2:05:21] money you ask what you
[2:05:22] will it will be given to you if you need
[2:05:26] a good health you ask what you will it
[2:05:29] will be given to you even if you want
[2:05:32] intelligence at school ask what you will
[2:05:34] it will be given to
[2:05:36] you you want a pay grade ask what you
[2:05:39] will it will be given to
[2:05:41] you you are fall short of because of
[2:05:45] yourself don't put that on God God said
[2:05:48] ask anything that you want
[2:05:51] give it to
[2:05:52] you amen amen God bless
