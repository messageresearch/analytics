[Music] Avenue eight months amen amen thank God Amen really I always like it when I completely foreign foreign [Music] [Music] uh verse 1 says now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister mother obvious ly therefore his sister sent unto him saying Lord behold ERS is sick first three verses when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified by itself amen amen Jesus said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified by it is you think this sickness that Lazarus has so that God might be glorified when all hope is lost subtitle for his glory amen amen how many have ever come to a point in time in their life how many have ever come to a point in their life and they they don't know what to do and soja Rivera you have just come to the end of your words you do not know how tomorrow is going to be like but you know that you pull through why because God came right in time for you amen amen I know you've had situations in your life where you have cried and cried all you can and you just throw your hands in the air it says I've done all I can I don't know what's going to happen but God just came in right on time for you amen amen how many has ever come to a point in their life a and all your hope is gone it says Lord I've prayed all I can pray I'm just living everything into your hands but you are seated there as a witness this morning and as a testimony that God came right to your needs he came to deliver you continue to probably be discouraged it says I cannot take it anymore the doctor said I'm sick I don't know how I'm getting together but because he is Jehovah he has provided all you need you wanted money you don't know where that money was going to come from but you never got homeless why because God came right on time hallelujah amen because he's the God who comes when all hope is lost and he will come to save you and deliver you know why he does that for us the Bible says it's for his glory so that we can know that he is we read of the woman um of the issue of blood in the Bible the Bible said she had spent everything that she had she had spent all her money her hope was gone was emotionally drained a day uh emotional uh he can do the same thing today all you just have to do when you see him walking by two seconds doesn't matter even all your hope is gone I can guarantee you his word never fails and he always comes through he always comes right he said our brother your friend is sick please come and pray for him they did the right thing his own failure they called Jesus it doesn't matter whatever whatever hold the right person hold Jesus onto your situation because he has been proven over and over again to succeed he has never failed hallelujah amen and what Jesus say this sickness is not unto death but this sickness is for the glory of God so that the Son of God might be glorified by this but we all know that later on Lazarus died so what was he saying this was a prophetic speech and the school poverty that even if Lazarus dies the glory of God was going to be shown he was is going to be glorified like that so you have no idea why you're going through problems in your life you have no idea why you are facing trials and tribulations I have an answer for you this morning you are going through what you are going through so that God can be glorified you have two seconds he wants to show up so brother sister your trial is not going to make you suffer our friends your sickness is not going to make you suffer foreign [Music] hey man so he will come for you also read off another story in the Bible Jesus was walking with his disciples and they walked by a man who was blind and the disciples asked Jesus and said why is this man blind is he blind because his parents probably sinned or he sinned Jesus answered them and said the parents did not see a Jesus this man did not sin he said but he is blind so that the works of God might be made manifest in him in other words this man was born blind so that at the opening of his eyes God might be glorified says God shall deliver them out of them all hey continue not some of them but out of them so it is your duty to take that word and look at yourself and say this that I'm dealing with considered in that all it is part of that all said so you call God on the word Allah say Lord you promised us that we were going I'm going I was going to get afflictions your word you also promise that you deliver me out of them all right he is bound to deliver you because he has done it before past we laughing is doing it right now and he can still keep on doing it Hallelujah because the end result is for God to get the glory [Music] doesn't matter even all your hope is you have tried for so many years I can tell you that God is coming through anyway Jesus came and healed Lazarus whilst he was just sick we were going to be talking about a healing testimony but that would be less glory for him but if you wanted to come when the things had gone to their worst measures so he can get the glory that he's the one who raised someone from the dead foreign you are in something that's not savable but I'm here to tell you that the more unsavable it looks like uh a greater problem is a greater testimony so God wants to use you Allah he wants to use me so when people look at you how did he get out of there is a problem then you can say it was God so he can get all the glory all rid of Abraham in the Bible you see back then in the day they worshiped so many gods they worship the son God the name of God was just amongst other gods that's why he raised Abraham and took him out of the land of the Hidden and he made Abraham to prosper yeah Prosper when he's uh when his nephew lot was taken the council he went to fight with people from his household and he won the battles God was just not making Abraham do that God was establishing his name so when people look at Abraham they can start saying the god of Abraham he was standing out from those other Idols he was standing out from the Moon God he is and he started being called the god of Abraham so the glory was not to Abraham but the glory washed amen amen so we are Sons and Daughters of Abraham blow some defeated hallelujah amen God wants to do the same with you and me he wants to raise you you've ever sees it he wants to deliver you out of your problems he wants to make you prosper you've ever Prosperity so that when people look at you they can say your God and that's the identification you get hey so whenever you get out of any situation God loves to receive the glory so when he heals you can't you forget he's going to say I did that when he delivers you out of your problems because he loves to get the glory and he will make you go through what you're going through so he can deliver and get the glory amen Sarah was Barren for 25 years foreign for about 14 years foreign he was Barren for 14 years they never had any babies God came true and gave her two sons and they started saying the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that's the name he was known by I said and when he came to Moses in the burning bushes and say whom am I going to say has sent to me and he says I am the god of Abraham I'm the god of Isaac and Abraham Jacob foreign why can't you do it for me we know Hannah in the Bible so he can get the glory foreign what did the children of Israel says and the sword of the Lord they were giving back the glory where it belongs so they could say God did it for the children of Israel were around Jericho they called on the same God of Abraham the god of Isaac and Jacob he did what he did because foreign ago he was telling you went to the doctors the doctors told him that he had cancer and he left and went back and he said I don't have cancer and he prayed about it and you went back to the doctors and they scanned him they said we don't see nothing why God did it and he said the doctor says I can't see this is a miracle why did God heal him so he can get the glory Lord he can say I did that okay so he's trying to do the same thing for you and Jesus loved mother and her sister and Lazarus is when he had therefore the Lazarus was sick he stayed for two days in the same place where he was then after that he said to the disciples let's go into Judea again [Music] he was delaying they told him Lazarus is about to die but the moment that he even went away the prophet God here says he says look at Mary and mother Mary when a brother was dead and she sent for Jesus and instead of coming he went away she sent again and he went farther Massachusetts that was building up pressure said I asked him today and he went further they were going to leave there for Jesus to come raise they still had hope for Lazarus to get healed it was dead body right there so that Jesus but they gave up manually they went and they buried him this is the Hopeless case so let's go bury your brother now history amen amen like our friend he's not interested let's just have a funeral and move on continue but Jesus had spoken a word of prophets it says that sickness was for God to get his glory yes amen when Jesus comes nothing stays the same Consciousness daughter was dead he came and turned the funeral into a celebration and then these things he said does Jesus Jesus talking to the disciples he says our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of his seat then his disciples said Lord if you sleep he shall do well then as soon as you say that Jesus realized that we are on different levels they don't understand what I'm saying it is like let me explain it to you he says he then Jesus said to them plainly Lazarus is dead he's gone but when Jesus was looking at the death of Lazarus because sleeping but when other people were looking at Lazarus they saw Lazarus dead and we see her that there is a perspective perspective Jesus perspective and these people's perspectives perspective is how you see things and how you see things is determined by where you are seated if you are seated all the way to my right here you're seeing my rights and if you see that all the way to my last year you can see my right side you can only see my lips perspective determined by where you are a lot of perspective the LA position of the directions that's why we need to trust God's perspectives because he is seated in a higher seats where you see to the corner he sees around the corner when you see towards the hill he sees behind the heels that's why you have to trust him in his word he says I know the plans that I have for you plans for you to prosper Prosperity don't know that his plan is based on his perspective so like Paul says we have to elevate ourselves and he said we are seated in Heavenly places when you are seated in Heavenly places the way God issues if the disciples were seated in Heavenly places they would know what Jesus was talking about but they were on different levels he said he's sleeping I'm going to wake him up he was saying he was dead so that's why you gotta trust God's perspective about you and his perspective about you is in the Bible you gotta look around what does the word say about me that's what I'm gonna believe I don't care what everyone else says I don't even care what I say about myself it doesn't align with the word of God see what I say about myself he doesn't if he doesn't know align with the word of God she said don't consider that what does the word say about you Allah take that and personalize it Allah the Bible says I'm above and not beneath that's the perspective I'm taking perspective the Bible says I shall be the lender and not the borrower that's the perspective I'm taking says the word of God says I am a chosen generation that's the perspective hallelujah amen do you take God's perspective over yours or then Jesus came and he found that they laid Lazarus in the death Allah as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming or she took a mouth she ran and she went to meet him she did the right thing and I feel like bunches although the situation was done it was hopeless they said we are done with this because Jesus was coming said I am running to him brother sister run to Jesus to have tried all you can you ever married because when Jesus comes nothing stays the same hallelujah amen very uh Martha ran to Jesus and she said Lord thou has been here my brother would not have died but you were not here so he died and we buried him and he's done with no love on theory in a party but she knew whom she was talking to me she knew what Jesus had done in the past she did not end there is she says but I know even now whatsoever you will ask of God two seconds God will give it to you amen amen although My Hope Is Lost I know that if you speak the words things will happen and Jesus said to Mother your brother shall rise again despite it having been four days passed by the new foreign when the weakest of Christians kneel down to pray I'll read that again I'll read it it's also written and he took the father's word and defeated Satan right on his ground what did he do he was proving to the weakest of Christians that you can defeat Satan anywhere anytime on the plain word of God just take it and say that says the Lord it is written here is the weakest of Christians kneels down to pray they can shake oh hell if you think you are not strong and you feel like my Christian Life is weak uh foreign oh there's a squad and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet so Jesus was telling math that right now is you are looking at me I am the resurrection I am the life so he was Resurrection walking on two followers Resurrection was coming on two feet and they believed in him and he says though you were dead you shall live and he said where have you laid him he said unto him Lord come and see they took Jesus to the Grave where they laid Lazarus that's what your faith is foreign use that use that Faith to Broad and belief away when you call Jesus on the scene because it's not going to help you if you call him and you're not believing [Music] so he told them you rolled that stone away amen you roll that impatience away and only believe all things are possible believing is an environment believing is an environment [Music] that egg has the potential to be a chicken the egg has a potential to be a chicken left out to the potentiality there is no environment the heat that the hand puts on the alaus stay left there is life in there there is a promise for a chicken to come out of that area but if that heat environment is not put around it messes but when the air when the hen chicken lies on the egg uh egg foreign [Music] there are so many dormant promises in this Bible yeah if you do not believe in this Bible in those promises they will do you no good but if you bring your presence you create that atmosphere of beliefs promises in the Bible are made manifest to you manifests because when you believe all things are but then Jesus said unto her did I not tell you that if you believe you shall see the glory of God remember earlier on he said this sickness is not unto death but it is for my glory he is reminding her Allah did I not tell you if you create that atmosphere yes you shall see the glory of God and when Jesus was standing there he cried out with a loud voice he cried out with a loud loud voice Lazarus Lazar Tom Ford saw the same voice the same voice that says let there be light is the same voice that was speaking the same voice that was able to create the whole world is the same voice that says Lazarus come forward now the Bible says when God speaks his word does not go back to his voice only goes back to him after it is accomplished that which he sent it foreign why because he was the almighty one who had spoken he stood there and Lazarus grave Allah that word was not going back to him until Lazarus said already that's the only outcome this whole situation was gonna end and he cried Lazarus come forward Lazarus he was he was in heaven already they tell us that when go to heaven the way well the prophet told us when he went to heaven he didn't want to come back no one goes to heaven and come once you come back I believe Lazarus was already having fellowship with Father Abraham but he heard that voice Lazarus come back it does not matter how much of a good time he was having but he heard that voice that had Authority says listen I'm enjoying this Fellowship greater Authority that's calling me back and he was lying there human body start decaying after three days life came back into him worms were already eating on his body and he was already smelling but when those worms they had Lazarus come back they had to stop what they were doing this in our job here is done because they heard a voice that had Authority amen amen Lazarus he stood there is amen amen demons have been troubling you a little more amen they've been having a party with you trying to destroy you but when God speaks they have to stop whatever they are doing it won't go back to him until those afflictions are gone and Jesus said unto them lose him and they said and he said let him go God reverse the process uh or town Potter maybe four days late but your late does not mean that God is late man you fed the veneer uh he always comes right on time you trust God's timing Allah when he comes that's the perfect time he was supposed to come here and when he comes nothing ever stays the same can't you live here hallelujah amen come on [Music] [Music] so when the prophet of God says he will disintegrate anything that tries to bother you yeah he says oh it might attack you but thank you but it cannot harm you in the paper scripture that says no weapon formed against you shall prosper okay now I'm a foreign Do it For Your Glory the Bible says the prayer of a righteous and availeth much the prophet tells us a definition of a righteous man a righteous man is not a perfect man but a righteous man is a person when when they fall to get up and keep going [Music] and realize your mistakes they I'm sorry Lord get up and keep on going living you are considered a righteous man or a righteous woman and he will come right on time roll that doubt away role that impatience away and he's going to speak life into your situation he's going to speak life into your problems and it will resurrect I am the resurrection and he is doing all that for his own glory amen amen God will hear your prayers hear the prophet that God says an angel is a servant an angel is a servant attention be our sons and daughters of God so who is more important a servant or a son or daughter is more important so you and me we are more important than Allah because all of us we have
