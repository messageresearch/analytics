TRANSCRIPT
========================================
experience with God. He will never be discouraged. How are you going to discourage him? How are you going to do it to discourage him? There's no way you can discourage somebody with bad experience with God. I I got a testimony from someone. Let me just give it before we start. &gt;&gt; There's a there's a family in &gt;&gt; a family that I know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or the wife of brother Jimmy. So the big sister of brother Jimmy's wife passed away. &gt;&gt; She left behind a daughter. So that that that girl grew up in a in a auntie's house. &gt;&gt; She was so disturbed. She she used to go out and do things out there. And she she was in a a Catholic family and no one could could pay attention to her. But one day Then she start having some uh thirst of God in her in her HOME and she started praying in the house. Lord, you know my condition. I'm an orphan of a FATHER AND MOTHER. I I'm I'm I grew up in a house of my but the way that I'm taking right now it's NOT A GOOD WAY. I JUST WANT TO be your servant. Please God, may you lead me where I can start praying. I don't want to be a Catholic member anymore. God, may you lead me. So that's the testimony they gave me just yesterday. And that sister went out of her house after three days of praying. She said right now as I'm going out, I'm not going to come back. You God, you lead me where I'm going to follow and listen to the true word of God. NOBODY PREACHED HER. SHE prayed and PRAYED PRAYED SO MUCH and God led her until she found a tabernacle. She she found herself in front of a tabernacle. She start saying in her heart, Lord, I pray so that you can lead me where I can listen. How can you bring ME TO THE FATHER MISS THOSE WHO WORSHIP? THOSE WHO ARE WORSHIPING ME ARE raising a man. I want to go where I can just listen to your word. She wanted to pass by and she didn't have any to go. She wanted to LEAVE THAT CHAIR AND GOD SAID UNTO HER, "THIS IS THE PLACE I'm sending you. You ask me then I led you to this place. Then she finally entered that church. She appreciated the word of God. The first day the second day SHE CAME AGAIN. FOURTH day she came TO THE SAME PLACE. [screaming] AFTER A MONTH AND TWO MONTHS SHE TOOK HER BAPTISM AND SHE became one of our members. THE BIG SISTERAPT WHO WAS ALSO HER MOTHER. SHE WAS UNCLE WHO WAS A HUSBAND TO A FATHER was also baptized. Everybody they are now believers of mercy today just because of ONE PERSON JUST because of one offer who pray with sincere heart and God led her. But now God tell that sister, "No, just go get her there or go listen to a place." And all those who are CRITICIZING THE MESSAGE, IF THEY CAN GO TELL her that the message is wrong, she's not going to agree with her. SHE'S NOT ACCEPTING IT because she heard her own EXPERIENCE WITH GOD. SHE HEARD THE VOICE OF GOD WITH HER OWN EARS. Someone like that, you'll never discourage her. &gt;&gt; She said, "Whatever you can say, it's not it's not going to DISTURB YOU. SHE went in the she went to the church of her father or a church of her husband. I met a brother like that in Johannesburg. A brother like that in Johannesburg. So when they came, we welcomed them. We were going to church with them. After a while, we didn't see each other for two years. Then I saw him wearing short with a with a whiskey in hand. Then I said, "What's going on?" said, "Ah, big brother. Don't worry." I was going to the church of my parents. I've never been convicted. Then I say, "Okay, may God bless you because you're sincere. You were going in the CHURCH OF &gt;&gt; AND we've got so many people like that SITTING IN THE PAIN. THOSE WHO ARE ATTENDING CHURCHES OF OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY NEVER BELIEVE the message. Maybe she believed in the message of her husband or maybe her friend. I I always people like that. THERE ARE many those kind of people. And another one said, "No, that's the church of my husband. So what can we do? We just GO because if you've already loved somebody, you got to love his church as well. It's his church. So I don't have I got nothing to do with that. We are just like fishes. We just follow where waters are leading us. As the husband is going to that church, I'LL FOLLOW HIM THERE." NO, THAT'S NOT OUR SISTER. &gt;&gt; Our sister is someone who has got his her own experience with the Lord. Somebody like that, YOU NEVER DISCOURAGE HER. THAT'S WHAT PAUL HAVE DONE. [screaming] WHEN PAUL MET THE PILL OF FIRE, now listen what he said. after he has met the pill of FIRE me ascender from THE LOVE OF CHRIST. [screaming] NEITHER THE HURT, &gt;&gt; NEITHER THE DEEPNESS OR EITHER THE NEITHER DEATH OR LIFE AND NOBODY nobody will separate me from the love of the message OF THE END TIME. I'M THE MESSAGE MYSELF AND THE MESSAGE IS RIGHT HERE. THIS IS A message to one person. There's no way you can separate us. &gt;&gt; SO who can say that? &gt;&gt; It's only somebody who have who have done an experience with God. Then you see you see some an example. You see someone in church and he's able to say uh that's their church. It's not mine. How can you SAY THAT THEIR CHURCH WHICH MEANS IT'S NOT your church? &gt;&gt; We just counted. We've got a brother Simba, we've got brother Kabong and brother such a brother. We just counting number of members sister. We're just COUNTING THE HEAD OF BUT THEY ARE NOT our our our PEOPLE because someone like that if you just go on social media if you see somebody who's just I'm coming from Kentucky I know William Brham very well HE WAS A MAGICIAN SOMEBODY YOU SEE he was not a a Christian so What can PUSH THAT PERSON TODAY? IT'S BECAUSE HE never had an experience with the Lord. He never test God by himself. &gt;&gt; Cuz on the way of faith, there's only one place for two people. One place is for you and the other place is for your creator. &gt;&gt; Only two places. It's only you and your creator. You go in that place in a higher place. So may God bless us for tonight. Let us stand. We're going to read something. Uh I don't know. I don't understand. I appreciate last time. I've got a lot of note. We're going to skip things by the grace of God. So we're going to read in Genesis or chapter 1 verse 26 to 28 as we're going to speak about the same message to pos to possess the earth. May God bless you once more. &gt;&gt; You are so special &gt;&gt; just to come in this place every time and I understand that you are serious in what you're doing. If I can understand what you're doing, then God will understand better than me and he will bless you for what you're doing. So we're going to read in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And God said, &gt;&gt; "Let us make man in our image and after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the earth, and over the f of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; and also over every creeping things. Bless the reading of his word. We may be seated. Okay. So, we're going to continue with the message that we preached last Friday &gt;&gt; to possess the earth. So what we just read, &gt;&gt; it's a blessing &gt;&gt; and it's also a promise that our creator have done to us to possess the earth. So when God created US in his mind and in HIS HEART, &gt;&gt; the purpose why he created us, it's for us to be a little God upon this earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? God has created us to have dominion ON THE EARTH. GOD HAS created us to instruct. &gt;&gt; God has created us to lead. &gt;&gt; We can reign, to reign upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To have a position of the earth. To possess the earth is to have dominion upon you. Is to put it down on YOU is to be the master of the earth. &gt;&gt; It's our inheritance and the victory is also our promise. That's what God HAS PROMISED TO US. &gt;&gt; TO BE HEADS AND NOT tails to BE THE FIRST &gt;&gt; AND not the last. That's our promise. Everywhere going to put YOUR FAITH. I'll give you that place as inheritance. So if there's hairs of God, WE ARE THE ONES. IF THERE'S a hair, it's me. It's me. May God bless you. So we are hairs all promises of our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what God want us to be. Now notice &gt;&gt; children of Israel, Jewish people, &gt;&gt; they were in a foreign land while being there. They were slaves in order to leave Egypt to promised land. THEY HAD TO FIGHT, fight and fight AGAIN before even they leave Egypt. [screaming] They had to overcome the Egyptian ARMY to overcome all the politician of in EGYPT to overcome even the security of Egypt. called order or the FBI, they had to rule on them before they leave Egypt. &gt;&gt; That's why we need victory. You can't have victory if you don't KNOW HOW TO FIGHT. BEFORE YOU GET A VICTORY, the first that the thing that comes first is the fight. You ought to fight first. &gt;&gt; Before even you leave this world, there's a war. There's a battle you got to fight. &gt;&gt; When you have dominion, then you can go out of here. So once you go out of Egypt until you get to promised land which is YOUR POSITION IN CHRIST WHICH IS THE LAND THAT YOU NEED TO POSSESS. THERE'S kingdoms around. THERE'S also a PRIEST and they're not going to leave you alone. They're not going to let you pass. And children of Israel, they could come on their way from Egypt when they get somewhere. They could say or we want to go through this land. So we which kingdom is there. So they take some messengers. They write a letter, &gt;&gt; go tell the king OF THE KINGDOM. THAT WE WANT TO GO THROUGH their territory. If we eat something, even our even if our flocks eat their produce, we're going TO PAY FOR THAT. EVEN IF we drink your water, we're going to pay for it. But so what THESE PEOPLE SAY, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET you pass through us. So they are imposing battle even if you DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT BUT THE devil is imposing the battle on you. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you something &gt;&gt; for every step that YOU HAVE TO MAKE FOR FOR EVERY SUCCESS FOR EVERY VICTORY you ought to fight for it. The devil will never leave you alone. He's not going to let YOU GO. He's going to impose the battle on you. &gt;&gt; You're not going to JUST GO FREELY FROM You're not going to enter the canal walking freely as I went to another church in Kesa. Oh, we're going to go to heaven then we go to heaven. No to go to heaven not walking freely like that. IT'S A FIGHT. YOU ARE TO GO FROM fight to another fight until you finish all the fight. WHEN YOU FINISH THIS FIGHT, ANOTHER ONE COMES. &gt;&gt; So we going to fight until we possess the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the devil is not going to let you go freely as if you going to the picnic. The almighty God is not going to let us walk freely like that on the easy WAY while other people fought. They paid FOR THEIR LIVES. THEY THEY SPEND THE TIME. THEY FASTED. They prayed. And you just woke up and say, "No, I'm going to go to heaven freely." No, you're not going to go like that. &gt;&gt; You ought to go somewhere first. &gt;&gt; That's how another big brother was telling me. He was telling me in Chula, if you want to go, if you want to go in peace, if you want to walk in peace, you may go. Surely, you can. You may go. But you're gonna get to to the to the city of Jul. But not in heaven. That will be in the city OF JUL SOMEWHERE. NOW you will get somewhere which is like heaven BUT IT'S NOT HEAVEN. But to go to heaven. YOU are to prepare for a fight. You should be a a fighter, a a strong fighter. Someone who can fight. You're not just fighting. Someone who's going to rule. Who's going to overcome and rule? For every victory, you ought to prepare for a fight. Why are we fighting? In Matthew 48 to10, &gt;&gt; the Bible is telling us this &gt;&gt; that one day the devil. &gt;&gt; He took our Lord. The devil bring our Lord upon the mountain. Now it was the devil speaking to to our Lord Jesus. Now listen, the devil was telling Jesus that you ought to worship ME so that I can give you the position of the earth. So the devil HAVE SHOWN UNTO JOHANNESBURG, New York, all those big CITIES THAT YOU KNOW and they said unto Jesus, if you worship me, I will give you all those cities. And if you read carefully in the Bible, he must never argue with the devil what he say. And the devil also, he can't GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE. IF THE DEVIL SAID HE'S GOING TO GIVE YOU, WHICH MEANS HE HAD SOMETHING and Jesus never argue with him. He said the word is not yours. And he said he BELIEVED THAT THE WORD BELONG TO THE DEVIL. So how how come the devil is going TO HEARD IT BY FRAUD? The word was supposed to be to the son of God TO RULE THE devil by HIS MERS. [screaming] HE WENT AROUND OUR FALL TO STEAL OUR POSSESSION. NOW HE WANT TO MAKE A SIGN FOR some stuff. Cuz everything that you want to do IN THE WORLD, YOU OUGHT to overcome the devil first BEFORE YOU POSSESS IT. SO WHAT THE DEVILS HAVE done is going to bring you into negotiation as he did it to our Lord. He said unto him, if you worship me, then I will give you. &gt;&gt; So we never heard such promise. THE PROMISE THAT WE HEARD IS TO SAY UNTO DEVIL, IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN, you will worship only THE LORD YOUR CREATOR. THAT'S THE promise that we have. OTHER PROMISE THAT WE HAVE IS TO FIGHT against the devil, fight until the last BREATH HE HAD and to be victorious. That's the promise with God. Because if you don't fight him until the last breath, IF YOU DON'T FIGHT HIM, THE ONE is the one who's GOING TO FIGHT YOU. &gt;&gt; AND I'M assuring you, he's not GOING TO MISS YOU. &gt;&gt; THE ONLY way to do is to FIGHT THE DEVIL, TO FIGHT HIM, to fight until we eliminate him. &gt;&gt; There was a war in Israel. And children of Israel, God said unto them something. When you go fight against Philistine, &gt;&gt; you ought to finish them. Even their little ones, you got TO FINISH THEM BECAUSE THEY are demons. So if you're fighting against demons, you're not just going to say, "No, I'm going to fight the prostitution. I'm going to fight against I'm going I'm going to fight against hatred. But you leave the envy over ruling on you. You also leave the TV, the spirit of WATCHING TV ON YOU. YOU OUGHT TO rule the fact of watching TV. Even the phone, &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE YOU GOT to be free from the phone. &gt;&gt; You got to overrule on your phone. &gt;&gt; Social media today, it's now stronger than if was there. I don't know what he could say about social media. I don't know what he's going to say about smartphones, &gt;&gt; but it became more dangerous more than TV. Your phone can get can KEEP YOU AWAY FROM IT, IT CAN TAKE ALL your time, even the time that you're supposed to dedicate yourself to God, but social media can keep YOU AWAY FROM THAT. BUT BEING A SON OF GOD, &gt;&gt; WE ARE TO FIGHT all the Philistines. &gt;&gt; What is Philistine today? &gt;&gt; Everything that PUT ITSELF &gt;&gt; BETWEEN YOUR CREATOR &gt;&gt; AND YOU ENEMY. &gt;&gt; Everything that is in the in between you &gt;&gt; negligence. &gt;&gt; Negligence. uh spiritual amnesia, &gt;&gt; LACK OF FAITH, ALL OF THEM. &gt;&gt; They are enemies of you. &gt;&gt; YOU ought to fight against them. And they have TO FEEL YOUR YOUR SOUL. THEY HAVE TO FEEL HOW can you react? They have to feel the power that you have. The power that YOU HAVE. WE HAVE TO CAST THEM out until we eliminate them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you're fighting, REMEMBER YOUR PREVIOUS VICTORIES. IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU MORE strength in THE PRESENT FIGHT. I'VE GOT no shame when I'm fighting against my enemy. I'll tell you such an enemy as I I sight his name. Listen, JUST GO ASK the marijuana that I USED TO SMOKE. WHERE IS IT? WHERE'S cigarette that I USED TO SMOKE? WHERE'S THE BEER THAT I USED TO TAKE? THEY'RE YOUR BROTHERS. GO ASK THEM HOW I OVERCOME THEM. GOD HAS GIVEN ME VICTORY upon all THE DEMONS. Not only on some demons, but God has given me victory upon all demons. You may count them. all the demons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God is require because to possess the earth. That's the final way. That's the end of our wondering children of Israel. They couldn't enter in the promised landu like refugees or maybe enter at night. If they entered in the promised LAND THAT WAY, THEY couldn't rule upon that that land. But the promise was for them to RULE UPON THAT LAND. THEY HAD TO COME in there being OVERCOMERS to bring down to have control upon everything that was there as the devil. He he he took the the the promised land. How how did they get in that land? They took chance of the absence of the children of ISRAEL when they FALL INTO SLAVERY. WHEN THEY WERE BACKSLIDERS, when they were in sin, when they were in their form, then those robbers, they came and took care of them to take their land. So they illegally based in that LANDED and the devil is HOLDING TO OUR BLESSING ILLEGALLY. [screaming] THE DEVIL IS HOLDING TO OUR VICTORY ILLEGALLY. In meanwhile, THE PROMISE THAT WE HAVE TO POSSESS THE EARTH all the resources that is in the earth. That's our promise. We are to possess everything. If we are children OF GOD, WE ought to possess IT and we are obligated &gt;&gt; to possess it &gt;&gt; if we are children of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So as individual you ought to fight and win the battle before you go further IN YOUR LIFE. A A A BACHELOR before you get married, &gt;&gt; you have to have dominion all the demons that want keep you a bachelor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What I'm saying this, &gt;&gt; every country &gt;&gt; has got his own spirit. Do you know that? &gt;&gt; And the Bible is telling us about the prince of darkness. &gt;&gt; They are existing in every country. There's those principles. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, elsewhere in this country to come over when they get to the country, &gt;&gt; there's a president, there's vice president, there's all those administrative until the the mayor of the your area. That's how it is in THE SPIRITUAL WORLD. IF YOU want to rule in the United States, &gt;&gt; YOU OUGHT TO OVERCOME, you have to overrule all the the princes, all the administrative of this country. And if you want to have a blooming church, we ought to overcome all the demons that are in United States from and especially the demons that are in in Iowa City. We ought to overcome them. And I'll tell you something. If from today we can say we will stop having church here and we will start selling beers. If it was that business, we're going to have a lot of people and this church going to be small. If we just start selling beers, if we put those worldly music, negative women, I'M TELLING YOU, we're going to have MORE MEMBERS. &gt;&gt; BUT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE DOING THE WORK OF the Lord, the power of darkness is not happy. But the victory that we have &gt;&gt; is to give him more punch. and to cast him out OF HERE. There's demons who are fighting the work of God. You ought to know it. YOU ought to pray against those demons. And I've seen it with my own eyes in one of the church. I've seen it. You just go in the church. If a church that was flourishing and blooming and at a certain moment You see people start vacating and people no longer coming to church &gt;&gt; and one day we came &gt;&gt; there's a a a daughter of God who enter into SPIRIT and start speaking in tongues you know me the lord there's someone who have done wrong I'm asking my servant to remove the PIT under the pit is something that has been placed Why did they put that thing? AND I PREPARED IS TO BRING DARKNESSES IN THAT CHURCH. &gt;&gt; Then we said, what is it? I didn't understand it. What's going on? So we didn't pay attention to that that much. We neglected. After two weeks, the same person speak again in tongues and we neglect it. &gt;&gt; And the following time it was another another person who have seen a vision and I'VE SEEN then people came at night they do some similar ceremonies just remove the pit at the end. Okay, let us just remove the pulpit. When we remove the pit, we found some stuff. Who did it? Demons, the word of God. When we REMOVE ALL THE STUFF. THE FOLLOWING DAY, IT was now a brother WHO ATTENDING THE CHURCH. WE WE THOUGHT HE was our brother. He was just a follower. HE CAME. HE WAS coming there to do his own stuff. No. No. Pray for me. I've got this. Go pray for yourself outside. The guy that you're fighting, you want us to pray him, JUST GO PRAY HOME. HE CRIED UNTIL HE DIED. JUST DEMONS that are fighting the work of God. We want to move FORWARD IN THIS PLACE. THERE'S ANOTHER KINGDOM. THE DARKNESS KINGDOM DOESN'T WANT US TO MOVE FORWARD. WHEN WE NEED LIGHT, HE'S BRINGING US DARKNESS. HE'S GIVING US THE CONTRARY. BUT THE PROMISE THAT WE HAVE &gt;&gt; IS THE PROMISE OF VICTORY. HOW ARE WE GOING TO OVERCOME? WE are to follow the principle of the way. We got to put oursel all the demon that are forbidding us to move forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We all understand it that way &gt;&gt; in this world. We've got our kingdom. And there's also a kingdom of the enemy. Enemy's kingdom is against us and also against OUR KINGDOM. WHEN God gave us the power TO POSSESS THE EARTH, &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "NO, &gt;&gt; THE EARTH BELONGS TO ME. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE EARTH, &gt;&gt; YOU OUGHT TO SIGN a contract to me." So that's the principle of this world, the powers of darkness that are governing this world. But we are in this world, but we are not of this world. That's why we've got victory. Let him come at night or during the day. The Lord has given us a victory. So when you're praying, PRAY AGAINST PRIESTS and kings of this world because the Bible say we're not fighting against the flesh but we fighting against the spirits that are in her. WE DON'T SEE THEM, but they are there. We want to have a big church, a good church, a flourishing church. So, we are to fight against the devil against IT BECAUSE the devil is not going to leave us walk freely until we GET A VICTORY. NO, WE ARE TO FIGHT against him so that we can have victory. Beloved ones in this world, in this in this country, United States, the spirit that is ruling in this country, &gt;&gt; it's the stubbornness of women, &gt;&gt; rebellion of children, if you want to touch him when you go to school, they teaching those children the right of children, BUT THEY ARE JUDIST, they don't talk about it. They don't talk about the duties of children. This is your right. So where are the juries? &gt;&gt; Where are your judies? What you supposed to do? Nobody's talking about it. When they talking to women, no, this is your right. They can't beat you. They can't DO THIS AND THAT. So which demon IS THE DEMON OF DIVORCE? WHO DOESN'T like couples TO BE STABLE? IF YOU NEED A STABLE COUNTRY, YOU HAVE TO fight against those spirit, you are TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM and screw them around. You're going to have a stable couple. When are you going to have it? After a fight, after a strong fight against demons, then you're going to have your victory. God has given us victory. But we have to fight first to possess. God has given us the earth. But we are to fight in order to possess it because our visit from the the uh promised land to Canaan from this way until we get to heaven. It's only fight and FIGHT AND FIGHT UNTIL WE FIGHT THE FINAL ONE. AND IT'S ALSO IT'S A VICTORY and victory and victory until the last victory until we get to heaven. That's the promise we have. Let us read something in the uh end time message before we pray. We believe in the message. Let everybody forsake the message, but we believe in the message. Let everyone say whatever they want to, but we going to live in the message and we're going TO READ THE MESSAGE. We're going to listen to the MESSAGE until we lose our VOICE TO READ. UNTIL we lose our audition, nothing will set us a sender from the love of God. Nothing will set us a sender from the love that we have for the message. And we're going to read in the message which is concerning us, our father's business. And we are so free. When we read, we we seeing that is GOD SPEAKING TO US. We read it with faith and confidence because we know that is the law of God. Now we're going to read in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We possessing everything. &gt;&gt; Possessing everything of 1962. We're going to read from 56 to 64. Our time is gone. Maybe we'll be skipping &gt;&gt; so that we can have time to pray. &gt;&gt; Now listen and pay attention to this. &gt;&gt; Listen to the voice of God. &gt;&gt; And today the true believer is cast out of people. &gt;&gt; They are treating him as a fanatic. uh holy rollers. &gt;&gt; It's not a prophet who's saying this, but I'm just saying they are calling him a branomist. They calling him bromist to diminish shame to bring shame on him. They calling him names just to insult him. &gt;&gt; A kind of religious fanatics. But regardless of THAT hair of ALL HEAVEN AND EARTH, &gt;&gt; WHO'S A HAIR of heaven and earth? I'm a hair. May God bless us. Blessed are those who are humble in their heart because they got to they will possess the earth. our promise to possess you. You're talking about finding yourself in a little home or SOMEWHERE less money just to pay your rent. Meanwhile, EVERYTHING BELONGS TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You ought to work. You have to suffer. And you have to sweat for just some little dollars to earn your life to to to dress up your children and to give them food. And while you possessing, &gt;&gt; you are the hair of everything that IS UPON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; But those who are humble in their heart, they going to hear possess the earth. They will possess the earth. &gt;&gt; I love this. &gt;&gt; POSSESSORS OF THE EARTH. WHO IS HE? &gt;&gt; He's the believer. A believer has got a title. &gt;&gt; It's got a title DEED IS TRUE &gt;&gt; BY JESUS CHRISTESS who says that the believer will be a possessor of the entire universe. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Those humble in their heart going to possess the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham could possess this land and everything that was in God has given unto him and Lot who was part of this land. So Abraham had a right to that land and he could claim that right or he could take possession of it. He said now God that has given me a promise that this land and everything that is in belongs to memise. God, you've done a promise to me and my relative has been taken away and everything that belongs to him have been taken. Lord. Behold. In another way, if I could say it, &gt;&gt; the church could say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; God here is my brother is laying down is is is having a cancer &gt;&gt; and Tibi. Now I'm taking the promise. &gt;&gt; It's my possession. It's you who said unto me, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can cast out this enemy. This demon is killed. The same way Abraham killed the kings and bring back what belongs to you. I love that. It's for believers. Now listen. Just pay attention to this place. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; Even though Abraham had a promise, &gt;&gt; had a right to a promise and belong to it. TO POSSESS IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's the believer today. &gt;&gt; PAY ATTENTION TO THIS. EVEN THOUGH WE OF EVERYTHING, even though we OF ALL SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS and all physical blessings, he of the promises, I MEAN BLESSINGS promised in the Bible. We should fight to get the the ines of the end. And God has provided IT THAT WAY. GOD IS PROVIDED BY the fight. &gt;&gt; It is always like that. YOU OUGHT TO FIGHT TO POSSESS. You have to fight to possess what belongs to you. YOU OUGHT TO FIGHT TO POSSESS IT. That's what we have to do right now. We have listened to that advice from the prophet. Now we're going to read 108. We're going to skip and read 108. Paragraph 108. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; we there. &gt;&gt; Now we're going to read so that we can pray and close. Pay attention to this is the voice of God. Listen and it's reminding me something that I've lived. If you were the drunkest in the world and your father left behind, whether you are worthy or not, But either you are worthy to be his hair or not. You are the hair of the inheritance OF YOUR FATHER. Whether you are worthy or not, you are the hair of the inheritance of your father. Amen. Amen. Now listen to a story that I lived in my family. My big sister had a child and that child didn't want to go to school. She went in the wrong way. She started drinking. She started doing all those kind of sin. But his father wanted to punish him to to but he was running away from home. But the worst came unto him. But his father wanted to die. He was about to die. He was a a CEO of a energy company. Now he called his son. And listen what he said. My son, I believe between me and you. There were no love when we were leaving and you thought I wasn't loving you.
