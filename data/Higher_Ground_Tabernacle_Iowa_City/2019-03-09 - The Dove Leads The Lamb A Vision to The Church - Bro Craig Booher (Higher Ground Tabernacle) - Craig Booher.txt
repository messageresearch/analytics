messages that I'm speaking say massage doncha power it's a key to the Holy Spirit select leo sentence me and God in in these messages hey don't be sad you broke out symbols and the Bible you breathe simple I am and the Dove and and these symbols is a symbol hold remarkable truths for us say let's assemble God divinity and the Holy Spirit broke up the symbol of the lamb a little assembled Illinois and the lamb has from the beginning of Bible to the end very important in your police from the very beginning when man sinned dearly they become normal baby shaver clothes the lambskins is it Abel offered a palermo supplied the blood of the Lamb the prophets war lambs and how Jesus was identified as a lion a human with it and feel calm and anew and how Jesus was identified by shepherds come my little ant if he remembers you because God is revealing himself in the nature of a lion that alanna children on you only God can be revealed in such great ways to reveal a decision that God would identify himself of incidents fury man with an earthly animal with the nature of a liar in not to tell you why the nature of a lion because the lamb is the meekest of all creatures of the earth I know silly presumably duplicate you it is humble sweet it is dependent upon the Potter Shepherd the pundit cannot lead itself first ever Shepherd God identifies himself Jesse didn't feel that's why John the Baptist simple question only said behold the lamb you give what seal on your Lamb of God I knew it is you that taketh away the sin of the world you ought to let me share this amount and then we see another type of the Holy Spirit's God identifies himself us identify remember as a dove the lamb is the meekest of all earthly creature I knew simply do the to listen but the d'oeuvre is the weakest of all heavenly receive Columbus and let me do the two leaders channel say it is me in a in an emblem it was loving he do ilium a blue and it's and God identified himself Jess identify us is anymore after death calm peaceful chemo yet off-key Ashanti and so the Lamb Jesus identified it's the earthly lamb hello I know Jessica said oh come on Annie Malta the Holy Spirit identified as the heavenly Lois all Celestin and when the wind the Ministry of John the Baptist came to the Trevor Jordan a la Carly means they ever did somebody say video that his sole purpose was to identify the lamb in that age shall be they didn t heal I knew he was identifying the Messiah in intimacy and he was the great eagle proper eagle a little click on perfect angler he waded out said the great eagle lit out upon the baby egg let's see he was ordained of God to identify the land this brother branham said was the greatest of all events blue Gandhi - and it only lasted just a couple minutes a sellout we need someone one of the greatest events of all history of any model east was when the Lamb of God came to the River Jordan God was standing in the water and when he baptized the Lord trying to say he said why are you baptizing happy to be baptized to be Y comma sy 1 to me who kwacha vaz pookas devotees jesus said suffer to be so ridiculous against us when see when John the Baptist baptized Jesus somebody celibate is a heavens was open listen later to wear and a dove descended upon Christ the lion orbit the Sun did crystal on you and a voice spoke from heaven in love who are the Palladian behold the lamb of God was seen language ooh it said the vicious my beloved son he KCC em on fishby enemy the great Stephen taken place is uniting in man or reconcile me why did the dub spirit come to the lamp because their natures were the same muscularity the dove is a messenger but the Dove brings tidings [Music] when he said this is my beloved son God was looking for something I love juicy cases I was so nature discipline at you something that he could love me because the Deaf make sure it's a lover brother branham said did you ever go in the morning and hear the doves cooing early morning something sacred about it there's something sweet about it and he said God wants to make love with human beings he's looking for something lovable he's shaken to show something that he can relate to like not sure the professor of what God founded in Christ and God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son he could fellowship with it he could relate to it because God's nature masculinity and Christ nature was the same he could unite with because it was the same brother branham said if it was a wolf nature for bottom indicates a tail on a children that Holy Spirit never woulda came to do solemly passive position because there are two different natures if you were proud honesty if you were critical civility if you were hateful see who's up here a lot of equity covers a VA lehand the Spirit of God could never come to it the Sun woo but Jesus was a man of proofed of God his voice was not heard in the streets of war movies upon the neighbors meek he was full of love you need a plan to move it was the expression of God's love John the Baptist was a roaring lion gambatesa T and you but Jesus didn't operate he didn't preach like a lion as she come he moved in humble

father showed him she's in a very fake a secular perimetry the dove led the lam ya'lam who conned he said I knew every step that he made was led by the Spirit of God because he was submissive to the will of God if he was to whip him out of the synagogue see then he was obedient to Allah either way or it will be SAS Allah if he was to be an outcast see this way that's where the spirit let him see siculus blue cords then that's where he were gold see luckily he made himself no reputation in epidermidis you da man may want to be accepted among people mem college are very toxic and God's will is

Celestine John the Baptist she said whom you see the shine come upon is the one cellular do you identify that one I love we do not you feel serene that's the Lamb of God one to look to hey man that's our hope yes he said I know place why the Dove is a sign like Columbus and see you know little dove out of the ark knowing every lash it came back as a sign is over was all over like a little mini the Dove is a messenger Allah Allah Columbus it that means the Holy Spirit is a messenger sent a speech at the message here in 1950 brother Branham received an invitation to pray for Florence Nightingale mr. Levitin de pierre poof lohan's I think you know her physical condition who conceal our condition physically flaws and brother branham look at the picture if I'm gonna get our foot to the floor FF Bosworth was there Mita was there and he said look at this brother branham and as he looked at it his heart just failed for God s food to some Kilcommons is that an invitation to South Africa please pray for me la veta co pool official opieop amo and brother Brennaman and Bosworth and meter bow down to pray this is a day after they took the picture in Houston a slightly Houston and he began to pray he said lord if it is your will that I go to Africa like this and your sister Evelyn occasionally would you hear this poor woman who material she only weighed 60 pounds in a fake case of Sun pound and cancer a dapper bowels brother branham end up going to England and she heard that brother Branham was going to be there so they called brother Branham to where she was about 10 minutes walked into the room and he said she was crying Moisture he said I don't know how she even cried he mentions about coma and she she said pray that God will take my life away a and I think your PA kg Ram said I could not pray that and he said so we all bow our heads and begin to pray and when they begin to pray a dove came into the open to go back and forth and all the ministers quit praying and look to the window to let me nice one Hagar the elephants god's little messenger was cooling go below me such energetic don't plenty who lake and and brother branham prayed amen mikey a man and he went to ask is that somebody's packed in any money s consensus is in a kilometer can can and when he went to speak that's at the lord you will not time but you will see kid I sent her to the moon a bunch of Aviva so incredible was this prophecy when my incredibly says that Baxter said brother branham are you sure he's on my side Monday s get you mr. Branum said I didn't say that he said he said God said that he came yeah I descend and she was completely healed my brother branham said her testimony up and up the way of Africa that started the revival of shimmer and a freak and those were some of the greatest meetings that were ever had on the face of the earth is greater than Pentecost why because God sent his message soonish time on the wings of a dove god help me we can't live without we needed have you ever noticed the nature of brother branham's meetings his campaigns were so different than the prosperity meetings the glamour and all the pomp brother branham operated in humble Authority oportunity before the services began oh he's come he would give instruction services how to approach God he would teach them that the Holy Spirit is very very timid brother branham strive to create an atmosphere of reverence it was not an environment of excitement fear but it was actually humility and dependence now he'd say be real reverence because the Holy Spirit is very timid muscular said to me and he said it'll leave like this brother Benham said now don't get excited this way but those who say belief make ye believed ye isn't that wonderful there's so many in those Pentecostal ranks woodwork the people this was beyond emotion he was dealing with the faith of the beat up by the motion see what the four message that turns our hearts our main suspect okay it is the dog that is leading our hearts Carlo Menotti no Kuni and the results of brother branham's meetings could not be compared to anything nearby a toy company or chose the closest thing you could find is the very Ministry of Jesus Christ himself sake is just two of us in ministers just accused to remember and I want you to notice the Azusa revival the birth of that revival beautifully was sold under the power of the Holy Spirit it did a muscle if you want a sentence that people would get saved even before the preacher got to the Pope unless they were just caught up in the glory of God but brother Branham recognized something has changed in the revival issues I mentioned anyway he noticed the nature of the Pentecostals change very monkeyland activity particle emissions they went on calling themselves para Costas impurity particles they went on singing the same song dimension reaching the same text but the nature from the nature they began with Sousa and the Prophet identified the nature was wrong something was wrong can you say man he said now you become a cut-and-dried program and the Lord revealed to brother Branham exactly what the problem was secretary problem making your valley ditches for niches brother branham said the other night when I was coming over here a few nights ago the Lord met me in the room some in a vision here's what's a matter with the church they got so much selfishness everywhere has so much difference simply fighting this is what happened to the Pentecostal revival he said we're supposed to be he said the first snow of the war the Holy Spirit could not stand at a snarl brother Burnham said now this is what has happened by vision he saw this church in its condition you get it he's giving a vision to the church this is the key to the Holy Spirit now I'm talking to the brim he said that's what's a matter around here let me see that's what makes the dev take its flies a secular community he said just let somebody start a little something around the church right then the Holy Ghost flies away as long as that lamb nature leaves you the Holy Ghost just gone or sealant a cassette on your V listen test and that's what's the matter with that's the reason the people are in the condition that they're in the wrong spirit has come into their heart and life we must be peaceful we must be he said that's why we don't have victory we have become starchy and we don't allow the Dove and have preeminent power sentence bit of what a preemie now soon has anyone ever heard of Dawson Riley a Buddhist you probably did that's unlike also Riley was a lion hunter out west that's not really a lion see hundred lions brother branham loved him but at that time he was not a Christian man said upon occasion and and brother Branham would instruct him as a sinner fair enough of a compassion and Dawson loved brother Branham even is a sinner boy mmm facility and Garcon they hung together may he saw his own finishes ensemble and one day brother Branham told him and the Holy Spirit is like a dove let this be a common column and then if you do something wrong c-chief Aikens do man he said it'll fly away Eva boogity he said not very far oh he's real close if I suppose occupy he's watching to see if you get right it works away when you make it right comforter I said you come back and so Dawson Riley doesn't Holly was inspired by the story is this parable sit parable and so he's stacking wood with his brother and Dawson begins to tell his brother what brother Branham said about the DA doesn't ah c'mon Cyril atella made me Stewart as if when he rehearsed it just exactly like I told you one other stack and wood white dove comes and lands on Dawson Xiang don't blush and Dawson's brothers and he said flew to the lab this message is inspired by La Colombe the holy ghost resents me can only fellowship with a nature like itself convict Alana - Kayla brother branham said when we get fussy when we get tempers the Holy Spirit leaves us the Holy Spirit of fire away the minute we talk about one another Oh Mikey look powerless and so he said the Holy Spirit will not put up with apostle on how many knows that the dev is a symbol of peace the symbol the to all nations are two telling us you because her nature his peace Huskies are not you Salafi how many love the Prince of Peace Zambia Emily adheres in our hearts we're at peace with God's people we're at peace and that sweet dove of peace is grief and said do school um but some freak when we allow our temperaments Carlos no permit or local air to take dominion over the Holy Spirit do meanness you should I said to speak how many said Lord make me a lamb come be a beacon say yeah okay to me not just a charge I want to be a lamb oh I want to be a lamb to my wife I want to be alone to my children to my pastor I wanna be a lamb to God it'll make my life different different [Music] it'll make my church different what is ready to hunt brother Adam said what's the matter with you Canadians he said it's good to be conservative don't be starchy you grieve the Holy Ghost away from you won't have a revival I speak in the name of the Lord yeah break up the stubbornness I'll go to your knees and begin to repent he said you're too starchy basket was at Tilghman statue he said get right with God may I show something to you the hour is coming your scream to find this the hour is coming that you will scream to find this evokes a clear bullet when he said thus saith the Lord yes God speaking say jookiba he said shame on you he can't affirm the Holy Spirit is in the midst of a said I don't know why I'm saying this but I'm giving a warning measure was on and it may be your last he said repent I don't care what church you belong to a party he said if you're not repented the love of God is not in your heart he said and you're on your way to hell the Lord the God who discerns the spirit he said I speak in the name of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit that is in our myths now he said I know it's blunt because you're sick but I can only speak as God speaks to the baby I guess I get you I believe it Shaniqua please tell us to repent the zeal of the hour I'm sorry this is God speaking sent the sign of the devil pond this massage the Deaf has no God can't digest unclean things suppose MP brother Balaam said don't let bitterness come into your heart no we can't see bitterness you can come to church sing like an archangel only God can see bitterness you know if you have unforgiveness in your life [Music] before the throne of God did you Jesus was done wrong Jesse Abadie Jesus was that wrong Gigi FFA or but he was still led by the Dove Jesse prove affair her kik assures me little con me para la la Colombo bitterness so take the meekness out of your life the sensitivity out of your life what did the Lamb of God do when he was done wrong can't you face a new model he said forgive them he wouldn't allow God to pour his judgment upon them [Music] say we should have such forgiveness what about that a man could spit in your face yellow Mapei oh gosh isuzu and you can still love him from God let me have that kind of love - it's more than man can do we creatures we can't do it but we can we can yield ourselves if we watch television it's over our makeup we have we're out of fellowship with God brother Burnham said he said when you come to one of those things no matter what the preacher hips on the pulpit I'll get sick you look pretty got the oppression when you see those carnal things of the world don't you watch this shot as long as you tolerate you're away from God I love was it the Luanne did you that's the reason the meetings are not what they were blue combs that's the reason the sawdust trails not in the tabernacle see like a little is Johnny food that's the reason the tent meetings are not in our country simply because you we have grieved the channel dove and we weren't our way of war there's only two ways negative one God's Way love what is in our way and we can't go two ways at the same time we must forsake our way open up his smile solution when they cursed him only he only blessed in the beneath you we have squares my victory where is my peace who where is the joy that I once had a two-hour journey but the Branham says it over and over
