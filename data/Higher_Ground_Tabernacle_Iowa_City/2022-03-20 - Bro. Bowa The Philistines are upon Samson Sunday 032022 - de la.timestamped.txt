[6:36] with a
[6:38] destroying of the cultures or or the
[6:41] good genera
[6:46] i can never bear with that
[6:49] one
[6:51] to rebuke that that's what brahman says
[6:55] that's what i can do
[7:00] he said
[7:04] [Music]
[7:10] [Music]
[7:15] if you're going to see a physician
[7:17] knowing that you've got a symptoms of
[7:19] certain diseases
[7:22] and this disease is going to kill you
[7:30] and if the physician just tapping on
[7:32] your shirt and saying no you're in good
[7:34] health my friend oh for being alive
[7:37] oh it's gonna be okay it's gonna be
[7:39] everything gonna be worked
[7:52] but if a physician can come with the
[7:54] truth and having his or her
[8:23] that's the purpose of the word of god it
[8:25] repeated the predicate and the purpose
[8:28] of a priesthood
[8:35] is to restore things or to repeal things
[8:37] that are in the church for the for the
[8:39] glory of god vascular minister sessions
[8:41] responsibility the ministry is a
[8:44] responsibility
[8:46] take great responsibility
[8:49] minister and a person who's a minister
[8:52] salute
[9:07] to speak about this
[9:08] subject uh samsung
[9:10] phil stands upon you fell to the general
[9:13] against the massage i've just done a
[9:15] general studies about the message
[9:18] is a person anymore i'm not talking
[9:20] about this church personally
[9:22] legalized that's an assembly but i've
[9:24] seen the church in in all legalization
[9:29] there's such a call
[9:30] message at the church of the messenger
[9:40] [Music]
[9:52] [Music]
[10:11] and we're checking the temperatures in
[10:13] the church
[10:15] it's below zero
[10:30] but when we look at a condition in which
[10:32] the church
[10:34] even this morning no some of ramadan is
[10:36] only possible we're still far away from
[10:38] that
[10:39] and a february
[10:41] says samson
[10:43] party samson
[10:59] and or
[11:00] the word of god
[11:04] god was working with them samson and
[11:06] there was a victory every time
[11:10] no finish time could stand against
[11:12] samsung samsung
[11:26] he wasn't given up
[11:29] he he didn't give himself
[11:31] some sort of first set the ground to her
[11:33] but when he made this great mistake
[11:39] just to give his body to god is
[11:42] uniform and his heart gave it to a woman
[11:49] that's where samson was overcome coming
[11:52] as we read it
[11:54] [Music]
[12:07] [Music]
[12:21] but today we will look at church
[12:27] and we're asking ourselves if the lord
[12:29] is terrible in his churches
[12:33] because the glory of god is gone
[12:36] the church become dried up formalistic
[12:39] what formerly stretched up
[12:43] nothing of good in the church
[12:50] while something
[12:55] [Music]
[13:09] [Music]
[13:16] with the daughters of the world
[13:26] [Music]
[13:47] wanted to know the secret of the church
[13:49] of the bride
[13:53] and the in the church is as revealed to
[13:56] the devil
[14:14] people coming sick and they go back with
[14:16] their sicknesses
[14:20] people come to your problem and they
[14:22] take it back
[14:28] all that because the church has revealed
[14:30] his secret to the world
[14:32] the church has led the world
[14:35] getting get good among him
[14:41] that's why things are the way you see
[14:42] them
[15:07] samson was a great man
[15:09] as she was following the lord you very
[15:11] much
[15:13] and she was following the commandment of
[15:14] god
[15:20] as long as the church walks with a with
[15:22] god
[15:24] god
[15:27] [Music]
[15:35] and god will never use the church
[15:52] or an individual
[16:15] only if the church walks
[16:17] faithfully to his commandments
[16:28] gonna use the church which today it's
[16:30] with god and tomorrow night
[16:50] [Music]
[16:53] if the church doesn't obey the
[16:55] commandment of god an individual no
[16:58] observer
[17:00] or an individual doesn't faithfully
[17:02] observe the commandment of god
[17:07] what i'm saying god is not going to use
[17:09] him he's going to put him aside
[17:13] and god will find someone else
[17:16] or something else to you
[17:18] that's why my brothers and sisters
[17:20] [Music]
[17:22] we're going to pay attention
[17:25] to work faithfully
[17:28] like god have spoken to joshua's way he
[17:30] said
[17:40] [Music]
[17:42] i recommend you to act faithfully
[17:57] that's how you're going to be successful
[17:58] in everything that god's word
[18:00] [Music]
[18:02] joshua should observe the word of god
[18:06] you should observe the word of god
[18:10] so that he can act according to what god
[18:12] have said
[18:15] and the consequences it was a success
[18:20] but now my brother and sisters
[18:24] as i told you we gotta pay attention
[18:49] [Music]
[18:52] but you are already put aside by god
[18:59] the glory of god is no longer on you
[19:04] maybe god will never come and tell you
[19:05] that
[19:08] but he said you have to act faithfully
[19:10] according to his word
[19:12] so that's the commandment of god
[19:16] thank you
[19:18] as long as simpson was following god
[19:21] god was using him
[19:37] [Music]
[19:50] those
[20:02] um
[20:06] we are in a time where god is using what
[20:08] we call win-win
[20:12] god has to see his benefit in everything
[20:15] else
[20:17] if he doesn't see any benefit of
[20:28] [Music]
[20:30] and the church shall never stop
[20:46] and he's going to replace you by someone
[20:48] else
[20:50] he will never stop
[20:53] listening
[20:58] he had a good start
[21:00] everything
[21:09] [Music]
[21:28] with the people of the world
[21:31] that was the first step for him to
[21:33] backslade
[21:37] when you see a brother
[21:40] come to church i'm busy
[21:43] busy busy busy i'm busy every time busy
[21:48] that's the first step of him
[21:55] he was sitting here on the first round
[21:57] i played this man
[22:01] after two three weeks you are now
[22:03] sitting in the back
[22:07] after some days you're gonna see you are
[22:08] close to the door costa so
[22:14] just notice that the person is already
[22:16] backsladed
[22:18] alexis
[22:28] he's laughing at me you think i'm
[22:30] talking about him
[22:33] i'm not talking about your brother
[22:36] listen to these brothers
[22:38] [Music]
[22:50] you can always remember that once you
[22:51] have a bad company
[22:57] you are outside of the will of god
[23:01] my problem
[23:04] my own mother was telling me to tell
[23:06] kush
[23:20] a dog that has got some disease on his
[23:22] skin
[23:33] maybe i'm not going to say this we got
[23:34] the sound bad but it takes a lot of
[23:36] meaning
[23:40] if you sleep together with a dog that
[23:42] has got disease on the skin you're going
[23:44] to have those diseases
[23:54] you cannot be in association with the
[23:56] things of the world anything that should
[23:58] be spiritual no
[24:02] when you associate yourself with the
[24:03] things of the world
[24:05] god's spirit and you think you're gonna
[24:07] be
[24:08] spiritual do you know you will never be
[24:10] spiritual anymore
[24:14] today is another day
[24:16] february
[24:35] another old man was saying tell me
[24:37] people that you're visiting then i will
[24:38] tell you who you are
[24:44] i think i don't have many comments on
[24:46] about this because branham is already
[24:48] afraid
[24:49] and he said
[24:50] call it leaves the commander freaking
[24:52] tell them all and when the church start
[24:54] visiting world settle
[24:58] that's where they're gonna be only
[25:00] things of the world
[25:05] is going the church is going to lose the
[25:08] fellowship with the with the church with
[25:10] god
[25:12] that's the
[25:24] and the church is going to lose the
[25:26] fellowship with the holy ghost
[25:30] the church is going to lose the
[25:32] fellowship with god that's the second
[25:33] thing
[25:36] and it's gonna lose the fellowship with
[25:38] angels
[25:42] and the church gonna lose the heritage
[25:45] of god god shows that's the fourth thing
[25:49] there comes some song and when the
[25:51] church starts flirting with uh with the
[25:53] word like samson did
[25:57] the church gonna lose the fellowship
[25:59] with the holy ghost
[26:02] he's gonna lose the fellowship with god
[26:06] we're gonna lose the fellowship with
[26:08] danger
[26:12] it's going to lose its inheritance
[26:18] that's the four things the church is
[26:20] gonna lose
[26:22] and what you're gonna
[26:32] [Music]
[26:47] now brothers and sisters
[27:18] [Music]
[27:32] now we're getting to where we read in
[27:34] revelation chapter 3
[27:38] we're going to get to that
[27:41] let's go back to samson
[27:46] samsung become and became blind after
[27:48] giving a secret to daily life
[27:54] the same thing with the church of little
[27:56] sea that became blind basketball
[28:11] but she doesn't know that she's she's
[28:12] blind
[28:19] people could be physically having their
[28:21] side man spiritual my son but
[28:24] spiritually they are blind let's jump
[28:27] please people coming to church vision
[28:30] spiritually
[28:32] they come to church with a spiritual
[28:34] side already blind
[28:38] dogmas and creeds
[28:40] technology science and technology
[29:08] people of people from outside they don't
[29:10] even know how
[29:36] there's no more good moral in the church
[29:46] [Music]
[29:51] there's no more difference between them
[29:52] and you laughing their sacrifice
[29:55] the life of those who goes to church
[29:59] is no more sorted
[30:02] that's why
[30:05] he doesn't give things to those who are
[30:07] outside to come to church
[30:15] [Music]
[30:16] those people outside they are sincere
[30:20] they don't want
[30:54] [Music]
[31:03] from us i can look at it
[31:05] they are thirsty to become like us
[31:11] that's what we're supposed to do
[31:14] that's the church in the matter
[31:23] we are christian soldiers
[31:36] that's why sick people are going back
[31:38] with their sicknesses
[31:40] with a problem no solutions to the
[31:42] basket
[31:44] just because
[32:11] the change of people that
[32:13] just churches
[32:18] they're redeemed of god it's not the
[32:19] four or four wars that we have here
[32:22] listen what brother i'm saying
[32:27] he said those people of the church of
[32:29] the lord
[32:30] name the church of the first person
[32:34] god needs such a people
[32:36] [Music]
[32:40] god has to call people and shape them
[32:46] people shaped by god to build this
[32:48] message
[32:51] he doesn't care take care about his own
[32:54] position
[33:06] but they are ready to go in the training
[33:08] furnace
[33:20] they are ready to go in there
[33:23] [Music]
[33:36] they will stay in the shock
[33:42] that's the kind of formation that the
[33:44] shaping that god is giving people
[33:48] and that's how god is shaping his own
[33:50] people
[33:51] why am i sir you see my brother and
[33:53] sisters
[33:56] god is taking his people through many
[33:58] trials
[34:00] to purify them
[34:04] and maybe takes years to get them
[34:07] and random says what circles your
[34:09] questions what i believe tonight second
[34:11] year american amen is that god right now
[34:15] and then therefore they tell us
[34:16] something is shaping this kind of
[34:33] until they can lose their feet
[34:36] that's the kind of people god is shaping
[34:38] today
[34:39] [Music]
[34:41] right now god is shaping you
[34:44] who can bear this message
[34:59] and he let them pass through many trials
[35:03] so that they can be there
[35:05] either in their faith
[35:07] in their victories
[35:08] they can go forward
[35:11] they know that god exists
[35:14] they fear
[35:28] oh my brothers sisters
[35:30] now listen to this
[35:34] also
[35:36] people are
[35:38] neither hard or cold
[35:41] and brother says
[35:57] not to have a position that's the worst
[35:59] condition
[36:00] so what's your identity
[36:04] people is because they shove
[36:06] like your
[36:08] butt
[36:09] like a butt
[36:24] that is teeth
[36:27] when they say that you're a christian
[36:31] they see that you're a christian today
[36:34] you're enjoying with christians
[36:37] so once you're out there
[36:50] i don't need your advice
[37:06] everything
[37:32] even in your dream you never dream that
[37:34] you've got holy ghosts
[37:38] even in a dream you never dreamed that
[37:40] you got a holy ghost

[38:37] church's message i mean uh

[52:59] is is a supper but not a common problem
[53:01] so that's not a problem
[53:03] [Music]
[53:08] my problem is the state in which christ
[53:11] is in his own church
[53:24] is found outside of his own
[53:38] and now he's knocking on the door and
[53:40] saying

[54:18] christ which is outside of the church
[54:20] today

[54:36] have been in domination
[54:39] they were teaching that grace
[54:42] crushed who's here
[54:45] is the one born from the village
[54:49] but when the evening light
[55:19] protestant people preached him this
[55:20] morning
[55:25] they never refused him
[55:28] but now christ is outside of the church
[55:32] i'm saying
[56:24] he is the one who revealed himself like
[56:26] the word of god
[56:27] same yesterday
[56:55] how can i overcome
[57:10] and all this other

[57:41] where christ was pulled outside of his
[57:43] own church
[57:48] they never show him like he was inside

[58:01] he was pulled outside of his own church
[58:05] and he's trying to go back inside do you
[58:08] see my brother and sisters
