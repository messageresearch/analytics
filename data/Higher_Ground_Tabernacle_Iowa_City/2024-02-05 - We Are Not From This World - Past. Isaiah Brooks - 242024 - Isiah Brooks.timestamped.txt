[1:04:04] received the promises but have seen them
[1:04:06] a far off and were persuaded of them and
[1:04:11] embraced them and confessed that they
[1:04:13] were strangers and pilgrims on the
[1:04:23] Earth
[1:04:31] for they that say such things declare
[1:04:34] plainly that they seek a
[1:04:42] country and truly if they had been
[1:04:45] mindful of the that country from which
[1:04:48] they came out they may have had
[1:04:50] opportunity to have

[1:06:11] you as evildoers they may by your own
[1:06:15] good works excuse me they may by your
[1:06:18] good works which they Shall Behold

[1:07:57] Lord we ask these things in your name
[1:07:59] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may
[1:08:03] be
[1:08:04] seated I just want to thank God for my
[1:08:09] wife
[1:08:11] Ruby Ruby I don't see her oh yeah there
[1:08:14] she is okay but anyway we we just want
[1:08:16] to praise God um for the last few
[1:08:21] months my wife and I have been uh
[1:08:25] experiencing extreme
[1:08:29] tiredness being tired extreme being
[1:08:33] tired and we had no
[1:08:36] idea that we had a problem at
[1:08:40] home our
[1:08:43] furnace uh our furnace uh heater how not
[1:08:49] uh um chage yeah was uh given giving off
[1:08:54] carbon
[1:09:00] monoxide and it is uh for those of you
[1:09:03] who may not be familiar with
[1:09:05] that we call a silent
[1:09:09] killer we were experiencing being tired
[1:09:13] we experienced being nauseated
[1:09:16] personally memory
[1:09:18] lapse uh just just all of the symptom
[1:09:21] that comes with that but we had idea
[1:09:24] where it was coming
[1:09:26] from many times I would go to church and
[1:09:29] I would be so tired I didn't even feel
[1:09:31] like
[1:09:32] [Music]
[1:09:34] preaching amen so for the month of
[1:09:37] January I had the young Brothers
[1:09:39] preaching for me on
[1:09:41] Wednesday because physically I just
[1:09:43] wasn't able to do
[1:09:45] it but to make a long story
[1:09:48] short God in his rich and
[1:09:51] mercy just a few months months
[1:09:54] ago prior to this incident we had a new
[1:09:58] system
[1:10:01] install a system that would alert you to
[1:10:05] carbon monoxide
[1:10:11] poison and had not we gotten that
[1:10:15] system my wife and I would probably be
[1:10:18] in glory right
[1:10:21] now that a system alerted my
[1:10:26] wife she called the fire
[1:10:30] department and basically they shut our
[1:10:32] house
[1:10:34] down and and and we had to get out so we
[1:10:38] stayed in the hotel for a couple of
[1:10:41] days get that that out of our
[1:10:44] system and now that everything has been
[1:10:48] repaired now that everything has been
[1:10:52] repaired my wife and I are are now
[1:10:55] um moving forward in our
[1:10:59] health I don't know whether you heard a
[1:11:02] few years
[1:11:03] ago of a young couple in Li
[1:11:08] Ohio who who house
[1:11:13] exploded
[1:11:15] exploded they were young couple just
[1:11:17] recently
[1:11:19] married they were just recently married
[1:11:22] and because the carbon
[1:11:25] monoxide was exploding in the
[1:11:28] air they must to LIT something and the
[1:11:31] house exploded and and both of them were
[1:11:37] killed so those of you who have heaters
[1:11:41] water
[1:11:41] heaters things of that nature that could
[1:11:44] get fil block blocked uh where the gas
[1:11:48] would leak it might be good if you go
[1:11:52] get you a portable
[1:11:54] carbon
[1:11:55] monoxide uh
[1:12:02] unit it doesn't cost
[1:12:04] much but it will be good to have
[1:12:08] something like that in your
[1:12:10] house should anything go bad especially
[1:12:12] if you're living in an
[1:12:16] apartment or something like that they
[1:12:18] don't always keep up with the modern
[1:12:21] stuff so it be good if you get that kind
[1:12:23] of
[1:12:26] system just just just to be
[1:12:30] safe because you could die in your
[1:12:33] sleep you won't even
[1:12:36] know it literally takes all the oxygen
[1:12:39] out of the
[1:12:42] air amen you understand me the same kind
[1:12:46] of thing happened to a couple a family a
[1:12:49] family from an Iowa a few years ago that
[1:12:54] went to
[1:12:55] Jamaica and they were in a hotel in
[1:12:58] Jamaica they fell asleep and never
[1:13:01] awake because of the carbon
[1:13:05] monoxide so I just thought I'd throw
[1:13:07] that
[1:13:08] in as a
[1:13:10] testimony and as a
[1:13:12] warning because my wife and I had no
[1:13:15] idea we would be deal with
[1:13:19] that amen you love the Lord amen I'm I'm
[1:13:24] I'm happy to be still I'm happy still to
[1:13:27] to be on this
[1:13:30] side I look for my day to go to Glory
[1:13:33] but I'm okay right
[1:13:34] now am amen so we're going to preach
[1:13:39] this
[1:13:40] morning something that's been really
[1:13:42] heavy on my
[1:13:44] heart I I listen to brother Brandon's
[1:13:48] message you must be born
[1:13:51] again that's in 196
[1:13:54] I
[1:13:55] believe uh anyway it's yeah Janu it's
[1:13:59] December
[1:14:02] 31st 1961 or
[1:14:06] 62 uh yeah 61 but it was a message that
[1:14:10] really uh uh uh gripped my
[1:14:14] heart because I
[1:14:17] believe the message of the
[1:14:20] hour and I believe it with all my heart
[1:14:24] but I also
[1:14:26] believe that it's supposed to be
[1:14:30] living uh we supposed to see a greater
[1:14:34] Supernatural among ourselves than we're
[1:14:38] seeing and uh you know I know God is
[1:14:42] good and I know he's been good good to
[1:14:45] us and the thought is not in the
[1:14:50] word within
[1:14:52] us we know the
[1:14:55] promises I didn't listen to the message
[1:14:57] that brother Isaiah preached last
[1:14:59] week but I heard it was
[1:15:01] so and I heard a little bit of through
[1:15:04] our brother's
[1:15:06] prayer and and that's
[1:15:09] wonderful all of the
[1:15:12] blessings are
[1:15:14] ours but but I want you to
[1:15:17] understand you had
[1:15:19] Jacob and you had
[1:15:21] Esau and Jacob was the
[1:15:25] Shyer Jac received the
[1:15:30] blessings Jacob and Jacob received the
[1:15:33] promises of the
[1:15:35] blessing Hallelujah but he had to make a
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:40] transition in order to receive the
[1:15:44] blessing understand me in order for the
[1:15:47] the the blessings to be made
[1:15:51] manifest to wrestle with with the
[1:15:54] angel hallelujah amen we're living in a
[1:15:58] time which is a dangerous
[1:16:01] time we have been so
[1:16:05] distracted we we we can I can I just be
[1:16:08] playing this
[1:16:09] morning we've spent so much time fussing
[1:16:12] and
[1:16:16] fighting and and we we've allowed the
[1:16:18] devil to distract
[1:16:21] us this is the hour of
[1:16:25] maturity you understand me we supposed
[1:16:28] to be
[1:16:29] maturing and not acting like
[1:16:33] Galatians arguing doctrinal
[1:16:36] things we supposed to be more mature
[1:16:39] more up the
[1:16:42] road Hallelujah and the question that
[1:16:45] comes to
[1:16:48] mind what kind of
[1:16:51] birth have you
[1:16:57] see we are not of this
[1:17:01] world and that's my
[1:17:03] subject we are not of this
[1:17:09] world and we must bear that in mind
[1:17:12] because as long as we realize we're not
[1:17:15] of this
[1:17:17] world we will not allow ourselves to be
[1:17:20] consumed by it
[1:17:24] Hallelujah the Bible says that we are
[1:17:27] new creatures in
[1:17:29] Christ we are a new
[1:17:33] creation all things have pass
[1:17:36] away and behold all things have become
[1:17:40] new now the word just doesn't state
[1:17:43] that just for the intellectual
[1:17:48] understanding but that word must be made
[1:17:52] manifest
[1:17:54] there's a manifestation of that
[1:17:57] word and and brother Bram talks about it
[1:18:02] Hallelujah he called it a special class
[1:18:05] of
[1:18:07] people hallelujah there are people on
[1:18:11] this earth right now that know that they
[1:18:14] are
[1:18:17] bride hallelujah amen and they are
[1:18:20] pressing
[1:18:21] into Hallelujah
[1:18:25] maturity understand because a baby is
[1:18:29] not born a
[1:18:32] man he must mature into a man he's got
[1:18:36] all the potentials of being a
[1:18:39] man but he must go grow he must go
[1:18:43] through trials he must experience
[1:18:47] life hallelujah amen in order to become
[1:18:50] a
[1:18:51] man so is with the bride of Christ if
[1:18:55] you're born again you don't stay a
[1:18:59] baby you don't act like
[1:19:02] children you must learn to
[1:19:05] mature hallelujah amen and I'm not
[1:19:08] chastising you I'm not chastising you I
[1:19:13] might it may sound like I'm fussing I'm
[1:19:15] not fussing I'm trying to get your
[1:19:18] attention Hallelujah you know I love the
[1:19:21] people of God but the worst thing we
[1:19:23] could come up
[1:19:25] with at the end of our journey and find
[1:19:29] out we didn't have what it
[1:19:33] takes now is your
[1:19:36] time hallelujah amen now the the this
[1:19:41] was the first doctrine of
[1:19:44] Jesus you you must be born
[1:19:48] again and I thought about the many
[1:19:51] stories brother Bram talked
[1:19:54] about and he talked about a little
[1:19:57] catholic
[1:20:00] man who had pork a
[1:20:05] pig and it was on a
[1:20:08] Friday and
[1:20:10] Friday every Catholic know is fish
[1:20:15] day but he didn't have any fish so he
[1:20:19] thought he would sprinkle it with holy
[1:20:21] water and with this holy water it would
[1:20:24] turn the pig or the pork into
[1:20:27] [Music]
[1:20:36] fish and brother said it doesn't
[1:20:39] matter how much he sprinkles the
[1:20:42] pork with holy
[1:20:45] water it never change the pork into
[1:20:50] fish y hear me amen so let me say it
[1:20:54] like this it doesn't matter how much you
[1:20:57] sprinkle yourself with
[1:20:59] religion your religion will never change
[1:21:02] you Hallelujah the change in which we
[1:21:06] must have is a born again
[1:21:10] [Music]
[1:21:11] change come from the
[1:21:16] soul hallelujah amen and see this is
[1:21:20] where we have fallen short
[1:21:23] and when I say fallen short I'm trying
[1:21:26] to tell you I've had a lot of
[1:21:31] experiences and and they were
[1:21:32] Supernatural
[1:21:35] ones but I knew that Within
[1:21:38] Myself there still needed to be a
[1:21:42] change everybody
[1:21:44] knows I don't have to tell you everybody
[1:21:49] knows when they need a change
[1:21:54] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:21:57] all of us can hide behind the word
[1:22:04] Grace
[1:22:06] Grace but Grace only gives you the
[1:22:10] time to make it
[1:22:13] right hallelujah amen and the grace if
[1:22:17] you don't make that that which is wrong
[1:22:20] right it become
[1:22:23] disgrace hallelujah amen that's the
[1:22:27] difference law would kill
[1:22:30] you Grace gives you time to fix
[1:22:34] it hallelujah hallelujah amen you
[1:22:38] see we are living in a
[1:22:41] time we must be born again
[1:22:46] here once death strikes
[1:22:49] you there's no change however you
[1:22:54] die that's the way you would
[1:22:58] come y'all remember that brother
[1:23:01] brandham said that the reason why God
[1:23:05] protects all of us now because there's a
[1:23:08] blood
[1:23:09] Veil around the
[1:23:17] earth if you're not right death will
[1:23:21] take you beyond the blood
[1:23:24] Veil and he said when you go beyond the
[1:23:27] blood
[1:23:28] Veil there is nothing but
[1:23:33] judgment hallelujah
[1:23:38] amen we are not of this world I want to
[1:23:40] I want I
[1:23:43] have you see we've been born here in the
[1:23:48] physical yes and I in in your DNA
[1:23:54] in this world is
[1:23:58] cursed amen amen this is why Jesus had
[1:24:02] to come
[1:24:04] by and give us a blood
[1:24:08] transfusion the blood transfusion comes
[1:24:11] by way of the Holy
[1:24:14] Ghost hallelujah amen if you don't have
[1:24:17] the Holy
[1:24:19] Ghost you you're just a a pork or p
[1:24:24] trying to live like a
[1:24:26] dove it
[1:24:30] impossible I'm not trying to make you
[1:24:32] feel bad it'll get better as it
[1:24:35] go but I want you to
[1:24:38] understand it's not just
[1:24:41] religion we've got the Baptist
[1:24:44] religion we have the Baptist religion we
[1:24:47] have the Presbyterian religion we have
[1:24:50] the Catholic religion we have the
[1:24:53] Pentecostal religion and we have the
[1:24:56] message
[1:24:58] religion but God ain't interested in the
[1:25:01] message
[1:25:03] religion no more than he was
[1:25:10] interested when Nicodemus came to him by
[1:25:14] Night a Pharisee of
[1:25:17] Pharisees he was more like the message
[1:25:20] people of that
[1:25:21] day and and Jesus said you must be
[1:25:27] born you say brother Brooks this is
[1:25:31] Elementary
[1:25:32] principle and this is the
[1:25:35] foundation we we supposed to be in the
[1:25:37] top of the tree right
[1:25:39] now y'all hear what I'm saying but how
[1:25:42] can you be up in the top of the
[1:25:45] tree if your birth is not a correct
[1:25:51] one
[1:25:53] do you
[1:25:54] understand that the devil has been
[1:25:57] giving out false
[1:26:00] births Hallelujah the true birth of
[1:26:04] Jesus
[1:26:04] Christ says Amen to every
[1:26:09] word oh I got a
[1:26:13] quote so you understand I'm not just
[1:26:15] saying
[1:26:16] anything you say I'm going describe a
[1:26:19] false birth a false birth is a man or
[1:26:23] woman who thinks that they've been born
[1:26:26] again who thinks that they have been
[1:26:28] born again because they spoke in
[1:26:34] tongues but there was no
[1:26:38] change a false
[1:26:40] birth is a person who has shouted and
[1:26:43] danced in the
[1:26:45] spirit think that they have the Holy
[1:26:48] Ghost because they shouted and they
[1:26:51] dance but there is no
[1:26:57] change you understand what I'm saying
[1:27:00] and there are many
[1:27:02] people who believe they got
[1:27:05] it because God gave them a new
[1:27:10] spirit
[1:27:11] Hallelujah and they were able to do
[1:27:14] these
[1:27:16] things but until that Holy
[1:27:19] Ghost get into the soul of a man
[1:27:23] man
[1:27:24] woman he cannot change she cannot
[1:27:29] change because she Still Remains the
[1:27:32] Same
[1:27:34] person y'all hear what I'm saying she is
[1:27:37] not enough to say I know William Bram is
[1:27:38] the messenger of the
[1:27:40] hour milons of people knew that Moses
[1:27:44] was the messenger of the
[1:27:46] hour Hallelujah but Joshua and
[1:27:51] Caleb had different
[1:27:55] Spirits because they caught the

[1:34:07] mature that's got to
[1:34:10] die oh it's the
[1:34:13] truth you see people say

[1:34:19] today and they picked someone else
[1:34:23] what do you
[1:34:24] care it ain't about
[1:34:27] you let God be
[1:34:31] glorify you understand me when we as a
[1:34:34] body come together we work
[1:34:37] together there are there is no
[1:34:39] individuality here there's only one
[1:34:43] person that is to be glorified and
[1:34:45] that's Jesus Christ
[1:34:48] himself and we should work together to
[1:34:51] make sure he's
[1:34:53] [Applause]
[1:34:55] glorified no no big eyes and little yous
[1:34:58] here from the P pit to the back of the
[1:35:01] door we're here for one purpose and that
[1:35:04] is God that be
[1:35:08] glorified and you got to fight for the
[1:35:11] unity hallelujah amen I was telling
[1:35:15] somebody I said it would be really
[1:35:17] wonderful if we had Elders that we could
[1:35:20] talk to
[1:35:22] and they can talk
[1:35:23] back and not tell no one
[1:35:29] else but it's it's so bad now you can't
[1:35:33] even trust
[1:35:35] anybody people are not even mature
[1:35:37] enough to keep
[1:35:39] secrets Hallelujah and then when you
[1:35:41] tell them something they become a truth
[1:35:44] breaker or I'll not tell nobody and then
[1:35:47] you go tell
[1:35:49] somebody that's a liar
[1:35:52] that's a truth breaker that's a immature
[1:35:59] Christian but if we're going to make a
[1:36:02] rapture we must be
[1:36:04] mature we must allow the Holy Spirit to
[1:36:08] work on
[1:36:09] us we must allow ourselves to be
[1:36:14] [Music]
[1:36:18] humbled hallelujah amen is that right

[1:37:59] grow is that right people get
[1:38:02] saved and they think now that they're
[1:38:05] saved they got to touch from the
[1:38:10] lord they're
[1:38:12] grown you're not an adult
[1:38:14] yet you're just a spiritual
[1:38:20] baby you've only just
[1:38:23] begun and a lot of times often times
[1:38:29] those who supposed to be
[1:38:30] mature don't have patience for the
[1:38:34] babies well you got to do it this way
[1:38:36] you got to do it that way you need to
[1:38:38] know it this way you need they must grow

[1:38:52] two-fold child or
[1:38:53] hell if you're not watchful you'll make
[1:38:57] a person a two-fold child or
[1:39:00] hell because they will obey
[1:39:07] you instead of obeying the
[1:39:11] word because they're afraid to be re you
[1:39:14] know you going to reject
[1:39:17] them hello somebody and we don't have
[1:39:20] enough love to love
[1:39:23] people that's
[1:39:29] learning I know what I'm talking
[1:39:32] about I often wondered why God brought
[1:39:34] me through the apostolic church or the
[1:39:36] Pentecost
[1:39:38] church because you didn't learn nothing
[1:39:42] but
[1:39:43] laws you got to do this way you got to
[1:39:46] do it that way you got to do it this
[1:39:50] way
[1:39:52] I had a lot of
[1:39:55] clothes but my clothes was
[1:39:59] colorful and the Pentecostal Church you
[1:40:01] only you had to wear blue black brown
[1:40:04] you know those
[1:40:06] colors anything outside of those kind of
[1:40:09] colors they weren't
[1:40:11] allowed they weren't allowed those
[1:40:15] colors for an example for example I'm
[1:40:18] I'm off a message but I'm going to give
[1:40:20] a testimony I'm off
[1:40:22] so when I first got
[1:40:24] saved I had a big
[1:40:28] afro I wore my black bow
[1:40:33] tie my white silk
[1:40:36] shirt a big old red rose on the on on
[1:40:39] the
[1:40:39] [Music]
[1:40:42] side my red
[1:40:45] pants and what y'all call platform
[1:40:49] shoes shoes for
[1:40:55] men my high heel shoes for that's what
[1:40:58] they were and they were black and
[1:41:02] white I was a
[1:41:07] Target you know what I'm saying I
[1:41:09] thought I was looking
[1:41:12] good but they the first thing they told
[1:41:15] me you got to get some new
[1:41:19] clothes wouldn't even allow me to wear
[1:41:22] my clothes I had to
[1:41:24] go find me some new
[1:41:28] clothes listen I was so willing to do it
[1:41:31] because I wanted to be
[1:41:35] saved they weren't
[1:41:36] [Music]
[1:41:39] wrong in what I should
[1:41:42] wear they were wrong in the way they
[1:41:49] approached
[1:41:51] and I we're we're not of this
[1:41:54] world this is what we must bear in our
[1:41:57] hearts and our
[1:41:59] minds if you're not of this world you
[1:42:01] are citizens of
[1:42:04] Heaven dress like heaven
[1:42:08] dresses you dress like they would dress
[1:42:11] in
[1:42:12] heaven
[1:42:13] Hall I'm going to say it like this in
[1:42:16] heaven they don't wear
[1:42:19] shoes so we wear
[1:42:21] shoes but we wear the shoes that will
[1:42:24] match more to Heaven than the shoes that
[1:42:27] will match more to
[1:42:33] hell I'm just I'm just
[1:42:35] saying brother said when he saw all of
[1:42:38] them they were
[1:42:39] dressed and they were all bare
[1:42:44] feet hallelujah amen y'all Y that's okay
[1:42:49] I know this almost like a teaching but
[1:42:50] this is okay as long you're all right
[1:42:53] with it my my point is this we must
[1:42:57] understand who we
[1:42:59] are we can't mingle with the
[1:43:03] world and expect God to bless
[1:43:10] us Abraham couldn't even be blessed by
[1:43:14] God I
[1:43:17] mean until lot separated himself
[1:43:23] can't fully bless you you're blessed you
[1:43:26] got the blessings can't fully bless you
[1:43:30] until you separate from the
[1:43:34] world hallelujah amen these all died in
[1:43:37] faith those who were before us died in
[1:43:40] faith they didn't have what we got
[1:43:44] now now we got the real deal how many y
[1:43:48] that Hallelujah
[1:43:57] amen let's go to St
[1:44:01] John I'm keep it long but got a few
[1:44:04] quotes I really want to
[1:44:06] read
[1:44:10] because I know so many people who have
[1:44:14] had experiences with
[1:44:16] God but you can you can
[1:44:19] tell that the soul hasn't been
[1:44:25] changed just by their
[1:44:28] apparel you you you don't wear apparel
[1:44:30] that will cause
[1:44:35] lust if your soul has been
[1:44:39] changed hallelujah amen you know it's
[1:44:42] rarely a rare
[1:44:44] thing I know in America it's a rare
[1:44:47] thing to find a virgin
[1:44:53] wearing clothes that's not becoming to a
[1:45:01] virgin most most of the time you can
[1:45:03] tell what a girl is by the way she
[1:45:15] dress and that's the
[1:45:18] truth you can tell she she she she she's
[1:45:21] very conscious of her
[1:45:24] body Hallelujah and she she want to keep
[1:45:27] that concealed see a
[1:45:30] virgin can't stand the idea of a man
[1:45:33] lusting after
[1:45:38] her but when a girl is not a virgin I'm
[1:45:42] not saying on every case I'm just
[1:45:44] saying from my
[1:45:46] observance hallelujah amen you know she
[1:45:51] she does different
[1:45:53] things to get attention you know what
[1:45:55] I'm saying she
[1:45:57] does now y'all women know better than I
[1:46:02] do but I'm just saying if you are the
[1:46:05] virgin of
[1:46:06] Christ you're going to present your body
[1:46:09] in a different
[1:46:13] way because your body is belongs to your
[1:46:17] husband you don't want nobody looking at
[1:46:20] this
[1:46:22] only his
[1:46:25] understand Hallelujah that's the way
[1:46:27] it's supposed to
[1:46:29] go hallelujah amen hallelujah amen St
[1:46:34] John
[1:46:36] 3n 1
[1:46:41] through I'm not trying to make you shout
[1:46:43] or anything I don't do that anyway but
[1:46:46] my desire is that the word will shake
[1:46:49] you even can get you mad at me today
[1:46:52] that would be so
[1:46:53] wonderful because if you get upset at me
[1:46:56] you're not going to forget what I'm
[1:46:58] telling
[1:47:00] you he come up in here with
[1:47:12] that oh my God but listen my problem I
[1:47:16] won't call it a
[1:47:18] problem say
[1:47:20] I love the people of
[1:47:24] God I really
[1:47:27] do what I call the good and the
[1:47:31] bad I'm not going to be partial with any
[1:47:33] of
[1:47:34] you I love people I
[1:47:37] love and my enemy is the
[1:47:40] devil it's not any
[1:47:42] individuals I don't care how you act
[1:47:45] towards me at of day I'm going to love
[1:47:49] you
[1:47:52] see starting at the first
[1:47:55] verse there was a man of the Pharisees
[1:47:58] named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[1:48:08] Jews the same came to Jesus by night and
[1:48:11] said unto him Rabbi we know that thou
[1:48:14] are teacher come from God for no man can
[1:48:16] do these Miracles that thou doeth except
[1:48:19] God be with
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:36] I Marvel that brother brandom comes
[1:48:38] along with a message called you must be
[1:48:41] born
[1:48:43] again like like we we are like
[1:48:49] Nicodemus and no matter how religious
[1:48:51] we've been he said you must be born
[1:48:54] again
[1:48:56] Hallelujah and see because he was
[1:48:59] embarrassed and that's what's wrong with
[1:49:01] a lot of people in the message you know
[1:49:03] you're not where you're supposed to
[1:49:05] be so you get
[1:49:08] embarassed when the word of God comes
[1:49:10] like it is because you don't want nobody
[1:49:13] else to
[1:49:14] know your situation with God just just
[1:49:17] like nicod but let me say it like this
[1:49:21] if you want to hide your
[1:49:23] situation still meet him at
[1:49:27] night meet him at night meet him in a
[1:49:30] secret
[1:49:31] place where you can truly get born again
[1:49:35] contact
[1:49:40] Jesus Jesus answered and said to
[1:49:43] him verily verily I say unto you to thee
[1:49:48] except a man be born again
[1:49:50] again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:50:02] God and Nicodemus said unto him how can
[1:50:06] a man be born when he is old can he
[1:50:10] enter the second time into his mother's
[1:50:12] womb and be
[1:50:19] born
[1:50:23] and Jesus answered verily verily I say
[1:50:27] unto thee except a man be born of water
[1:50:30] and of spirit he cannot enter into the
[1:50:34] kingdom of
[1:50:42] God which is born of flesh is
[1:50:45] flesh which is born of the spirit is
[1:50:49] Spirit
[1:50:50] Marvel not that I say unto thee you must
[1:50:55] be born
[1:51:01] again that word
[1:51:03] must mean means you have no
[1:51:07] option this is his
[1:51:10] criteria this is his mandate you must
[1:51:14] born
[1:51:15] again you can't even get
[1:51:18] there no Flesh and Blood shall enter
[1:51:23] Heaven inherit it's only the spirit man
[1:51:28] that man or woman that's truly been born
[1:51:31] again
[1:51:33] Hallelujah you talking about
[1:51:36] Revival let this church have a
[1:51:39] Revival if everybody leave here
[1:51:42] today say God I'm not going to stop till
[1:51:46] I know that I'm
[1:51:48] dead Hallelujah and I know when I'm dead
[1:51:52] because when I'm dead it makes you alive
[1:51:56] you be what I think about during the day
[1:51:59] Hallelujah I think about you in the
[1:52:02] morning I think about you in the noon
[1:52:05] day I think about you in the evening I
[1:52:08] think about you in the at night Jesus
[1:52:12] you will be my
[1:52:14] mind that's the kind of death he wants
[1:52:17] us to
[1:52:18] have that that early church that's all
[1:52:22] they knew they knew
[1:52:25] Jesus they could care less about what's
[1:52:28] happening in
[1:52:29] Rome Hallelujah they didn't care about
[1:52:31] Rome
[1:52:32] activities they care about the
[1:52:34] Gladiators and all of the
[1:52:37] circuses all they had on their
[1:52:40] minds was to tell the story huah that
[1:52:45] Jesus died that Jesus rose and that
[1:52:49] Jesus was living
[1:52:50] and he was living in them Hallelujah is
[1:52:54] that right take it oh take for an
[1:52:57] example one man brother Bram spent his
[1:53:01] entire
[1:53:03] life his entire life telling the world
[1:53:07] about
[1:53:09] Jesus Hallelujah that was
[1:53:13] it I believe it was Billy
[1:53:15] Paul that told brother
[1:53:17] Brandon daddyy that's all you talk about
[1:53:20] is
[1:53:20] Jesus Hallelujah is that right what else
[1:53:25] I'm supposed to talk about Hallelujah
[1:53:28] I'm not into politics I'm not into the
[1:53:31] social clicks it's all about
[1:53:35] Jesus hallelujah amen but when you talk

[2:12:15] people we must realize that this world
[2:12:19] is being is going to be
[2:12:23] destroyed let me ask you a
[2:12:26] question how would you feel about God if
[2:12:29] you lived in
[2:12:33] Ukraine where the bombs are
[2:12:35] dropping babies are dying folks your
[2:12:39] mama your grandma
[2:12:42] everybody would you still have faith in
[2:12:47] God
[2:12:49] we're coming to a
[2:12:51] place you're going to be
[2:12:55] tried and you can't make it without the
[2:12:58] soul being
[2:13:01] changed and God gave us a true example
[2:13:04] Peter was a true follower of Jesus
[2:13:10] Christ but when the pressure came he
[2:13:13] couldn't take
[2:13:15] it he wanted to but he didn't have the
[2:13:19] god power on the inside what you talking
[2:13:22] about yes God breathed on them the Holy
[2:13:26] Spirit and it was promise and they had
[2:13:29] that Spirit on their on their Spirit but
[2:13:32] the not yet
[2:13:35] Chang that Soul was changed on the day
[2:13:38] of
[2:13:39] Pentecost the holy GH came Soul now you
[2:13:42] saw a man who was a c now standing up
[2:13:46] preaching the word of God

[2:13:52] testify of Christ there's something
[2:13:55] wrong with your
[2:14:04] experience okay I'm G let this be the
[2:14:07] last quote for
[2:14:08] real
[2:14:11] Hallelujah people science have broken
[2:14:14] have broke into God's
[2:14:16] laboratory until they could come until
[2:14:19] they're going to destroy
[2:14:26] themselves God let always let wisdom
[2:14:28] destroy
[2:14:33] himself God doesn't destroy
[2:14:36] anything man destroy himself
[2:14:40] by he did at the beginning taking Satan
[2:14:44] wisdom instead of God's
[2:14:46] word
[2:14:49] hallelujah amen now she knows she must
[2:14:52] give
[2:14:53] way she cannot stand

[2:15:00] nation if she thought that she could
[2:15:02] destroy

[2:15:07] herself and any of those little Nations
[2:15:09] can do
[2:15:12] it but they
[2:15:14] afraid because they know that the world
[2:15:17] cannot stand in its orbit under such
[2:15:24] conditions so the world knows that her
[2:15:26] birth pains is so
[2:15:32] great there's going to be a new
[2:15:35] birth born at

[2:15:47] place of death death and
[2:15:48] sorrow and all kinds of discrepancies
[2:15:51] and so

[2:15:56] way I'm glad that time is at
[2:15:59] hand John said of old even so come Lord
