don't know well I I believe everybody's feeling pretty good I believe it's a overflow amen God is good to us I I tell you uh that was the best New Year service I have ever experienced and uh I'm still feeling the effects amen God has been so good to us uh before we uh go any further we're just going to say a quick word for our brother John minger and his family it is a difficult thing when you lose your mom and especially when you far away from where she is is I can't imagine the pain things that going through but let's just pray that God continue to give him uh strength and encouragement Our Father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy father we pray that you would bless our brother John his family Lord through this time of bement I pray father that you give him everything that he needs Lord you know all circumstances and why you allow things to happen the way they have happened we pray father that you give our brother Insight may always know that all things do work together for the good of them that love you and that all things are moving by the power of God so we thank you Lord for this time in Jesus Christ's name we pray bless the service as we partake of it we be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you may be seated I'm sorry I'm sorry let stand I had read word hallelujah Romans 8 please Romans the 8th chapter and then we'll go to Hebrews 13 and8 Romans Romans 8th chapter end the third verse I'm I'm sorry the 37th verse and we'll read down to the 39th verse of that particular chapter nay and all these things will we are more than conquerors through him that love us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angel nor principality nor power nor things present nor things to come no height or depth not even not any nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord [Music] Hebrews 13 and8 which is a familiar scripture reads Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and we're going to get one more scripture second Corinthians the first chapter I'm sorry 2 Corinthians the 7th chapter and the first verse so chapter in the first verse having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God you love the Lord let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for all that you've done for us Lord when we think about your goodness and all that you've done for us Lord we don't even know how to express our gratitude but this morning we do say thank you Lord for being who you are in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you may be seated well I trust that we are encouraged this [Music] morning uh we're getting ready to embrace what we call the translation and I am so happy about it to know that I am one of them we are what we call those Exodus children Those whom God has led out of organizations and denominationalism people who cannot be destroyed a people who can never fail because our Victory is not within ourselves but our Victory is in Christ Jesus I would like to entitle this message uh super Church super church and the prophet of God tells us that we are invincible and I said uh at the end of the service the other night that we're going to be preaching on positive things because I want you to to always remember who you are now we're going to make mistakes we we we we're going to have shortcomings but we know that those things have already been taken care of we have a message that has given us such a liberty a Liberty from organizational ISM a Liberty from denominationalism a Liberty from any manmade structure God has freed us from all of that hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible tells us that that there is no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Hallelujah and sometimes people just don't understand that statement because we're in the flesh but see our heart's desire is to walk after the spirit and as long as we're being led by the Holy Ghost there is no condemnation Hallelujah to those who are led by the holy ghost in the preview of the Bride in the preview brother Bram saw the Bride of Jesus Christ walking to the tune of the word and he also saw her walking to the tune of Onward Christian Soldier and if we could just think of that song just a little bit Onward Christian Soldier marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before now we're not marching or walking within the uh denominational rings but we're being led there something that we hold in view we must keep that in view Hallelujah with the cross of Jesus yeah y understand what I'm saying we must keep Calvary in view because of Calvary we are who we are hallelujah hallelujah and understand nothing can conquer the word of God I'm going say that again nothing can conquer the word of God and as and as long as you are the word hallelujah that means you cannot be conquered I like that hallelujah hallelujah let me read something here brother BR says now here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction bring forth of his kind that that excites me to know that the law of reproduction cannot fail whatever seed you plant is what crop you're going to get is that right it it's the word hallelujah amen that's right the law of reproduction bring forth other this kind and that's Genesis 111 he said in these last days true church Bride Comes To The Headstone will be the Super Church a super race Hallelujah as she nears the great headstone as she nears the great headstone Hallelujah and for whatever reason we always put that in the future is that right we forget we forget the prophet of God said is a natural uh uh man or way of a man to think about what God did yesterday Hallelujah and he's always putting God in the future Hallelujah but he fails to see God right now Hallelujah and we're serving a right now God if I could get the higher ground tabern to see that we're the now Hallelujah yesterday yeah today and forever we are Jesus today oh Lord have mercy am am if we could just really see that not with our heads but with our hearts we could transform I City hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said where two or three are gathered in my name they I am in the midst hallelujah amen and often times often times we think that we're we're looking at God in the midst that's not where he's talking about he's about in the midst Hallelujah you are agreeing with one another according to the Christ that's in your heart is that right in other words you are on one Accord threefold cord what is not so easily broken a threefold cord it's not so easily broken and when we can get two to three people with the same mindset Hallelujah and they're thinking to do the perfect will of God they become an invincible Army Hallelujah serve amen amen hallelujah hallelujah these last days this true bride a church Bride Comes To The Headstone will be the Super Church a super race as they near the great headstone they will be much like so much like him even they will be in his very image now remember I hope you remember there's a difference between image and likess Hallelujah because remember when Adam was first created he was first created in the image Hallelujah and brother Bram said that was actually the theophany part the word part the word part Hallelujah he was Spirit oh my God and then he was formed and when he was formed from the D dust of the earth it was then he became in his likeness you understand me the the image of God is the is the spirit man the likeness of God is the physical that part that you can see in reference to Hallelujah and the Bible brother Adam says here that God that we will come into the very image what is he saying we are now moving into divine nature of God hallelujah little by little from glory to glory we are now coming into the image do you understand what I'm saying we're coming into that that God man part Hallelujah that cannot be deceived neither can it be neither can it fall Hallelujah huj that's what Peter said he said if those virtues remain in you you'll neither fall neither will you be baren you won't fall and you'll bring forth fruit hallelujah hallelujah come on somebody in other words you got to stop looking at yourself as being a failure but you must allow God to transform your mind to a Overcomer Hallelujah I'm not even a Survivor Hallelujah Survivor means just to endure Hallelujah I barely made it Hallelujah but to be a Overcomer it means that you conquered something Hallelujah that's what Paul said we are more than conquerors you understand me more than Overcomers Hallelujah why because we didn't have to overcome he overcame for us hallelujah hallelujah be like him when we began to see by God's grace what he is and and what his intent is for us it ought to give us unwavering faith brother brand would call it undisturbed faith I like that word better undisturbed faith that means whatever comes my way it doesn't disturb me Hallelujah even when Paul saw false Brethren and when they spoke evil of Paul Paul said none of these things move me Hallelujah in other words I am undisturbed because I know who I am no matter what others go through and no matter what other people think about you you got to know who you are hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said he said listen he goes on to say they will be much like him even they will be in the very his very image in order to un unite or to be United with him in other words God can't be unequally yolked Hallelujah he can't be unequally yolked unequally yolked like a o together Hallelujah so that you understand one of the things that even Adam saw when Eve fell they were on different planes they were they were no longer on the same level and an order for him to save her he had to give way to failure so they could be on the same place in order to be yolked together Hallelujah but the Christ Jesus Christ himself knows he cannot be Yol to you me Hallelujah until we come up higher is that right this is what the the angel said to John come up higher this message calls for us to come up higher Hallelujah even Paul even Paul says stop or quit thinking like men Hallelujah that's our problem we keep thinking like men we are no longer Men We Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah hallu this outward shell this outward shell this body does not define me Hallelujah it does not he was given a bride Hallelujah he says I'm just reviewing the spirit now is picking up what I said see a bride prod up a bride produced himself she fell see and that the bride was given to produce himself again another Son of God but she fell by high breeding see produced himself but she fell caused him to die Hallelujah the Second Son a spoken seed word of God was was to believe God would present Christ a beloved bride all that has been promised wait a minute let me stop this right right now you got to focus on what I'm talking about you got to hear the voice of God for you right everybody can't hear the voice I can literally quote William Brandon and you walk right out here not hearing the voice of God now I want you to think about what I'm what I'm saying here I know we I'm reading a quote but I want you to put yourself in this quote you must put yourself in this quote Hallelujah he said then from a little group of true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride Hallelujah now you got to put yourself in that little group a virgin a virgin of his word and through them this is the part I life see that's what people don't understand they think since William brownon has gone of the scene is all over it's not all over if I can say it it's just beginning Hallelujah hallel why his day has gone but now the move is on for the bride you got to understand we cannot piggy back on William Brown oh come on somebody y'all get quiet now because you don't know what you got if you had God in you like you ought to have him you'll know what I'm talking about hallelujah what I'm not blaspheming I'm trying to tell you something Hallelujah this thing is turning and what Ela went for he went to get a bride now the bride is coming into Plain View hallelu why do you think all of the pressure of the world is now not just in America but everywhere pressure everywhere why because a child is about to be born is that right Mary had a promise from God that that she would bring forth a son y'all hear what I'm saying it was a promise it was a supernatural promise given to her and she didn't have to do but one thing and that was to receive the promised word hallelujah and when she received the promised word life began to form in her somebody help me here now think about it Hallelujah she's got to bring forth the Messiah and God hasn't told her anything amen hallelujah even some of the scriptures about him being born in Bethlehem had not yet unfolded unto them but in that time time there was a political disturbance and a social disturbance Hallelujah come on somebody you even had those Jews who was fanatic who wanted to overthrow the government Hallelujah they were protesters Hallelujah bringing trouble to everybody Hallelujah and here then God says I'm going to tax you and everybody got to go back to their own land where you were born understand this you talking about pressure I can't imagine what Joseph was thinking more or less Mary was thinking she's got to carry a baby she's already 9 months full oh my God and she's got a ride on a donkey Hallelujah the least little bu y know what I'm saying y'all sisters I've seen my wife I know what it's like amen the least love you know amen she's got to ride there and no doubt she's thinking this baby can happen at any time you don't think the devil was riding on her you don't think the devil was riding in her mind Hallelujah God ain't telling her nothing Hallelujah and then she think all this baby's doing in in any moment and she gets to a place look like a in y'all know what I'm talking about then she takes a big breath finally we've arrived and then the inke keeper says there is no room oh sorry y'all know what I'm saying I could I could I could make this a little more personal so but I'mma leave it just there so you can understand the trauma the trauma and the things they must have been going through as human being Hallelujah and then they said okay we do have a place but it's in the cow stand a cow cave over there y you understand when I'm trying to bring something to you don't you think that this squeeze or whatever we got to go through is going to be life is going to be very very uncomfortable to the flesh hallelujah it's going to be a time when you if you don't understand the promise you might even think the Rapture is already taken place hallelujah it's going to be just that dark but when you know who you know and you know who you are you know that you're right in the midst of the promise hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and you might think well it's going to be easy but it won't be easy it can't be easy no birth is easy is no birth is easy you know I I heard the prophet God said nobody could have died like Jesus Hallelujah no man could have taken the beating that he took and live Hallelujah huh is that right understand when that water and blood separated Hallelujah no man no man you could have you couldn't have you could not have done it it was was from a broken heart Hallelujah you understand what I'm saying he went beyond measures to make this day possible hallelujah oh my and now he just needs somebody who's going to believe somebody who's going to believe what we think to be the impossible like Mary said how can this thing be Hallelujah and many of us have thought that how can this thing be but understand this thing is not because of you it's because he said it would be hallelujah hallelujah born in a stable and no doubt the reality came first of all they didn't even know what God was doing Here Comes these Shepherds declaring they seen angels and hallelujah hallelujah and then they see this big Supernatural light above can you imagine can you imagine yall understand what I'm saying can you imagine what brother brownon felt like when he first saw the pillar of fire can you imagine when he first understood what it was can you imagine how insignificant he felt that God would choose him that's the way I feel I feel insignificant that God would choose me Hallelujah to be his bride you ought to feel the same way and to know nothing can separate us hallelujah how many y'all was really in love when you got married I know some of y'all weren't but but when you really in love you get this tunn of vision y understand me all you see is him and all she sees is is all he see is you and and you know somebody could say well man you haven't noticed she she's got you know her her eyes you know they look kind of funny they can say whatever they want to about the person you love and you will never see what they're talking about it's the truth so in love you can't even see any fault or any error it's what we call tunnel vision Hallelujah and when you find a girl that has tunnel vision for a boy the best thing you can do especially if you think the boy is no good the best thing you can do is pray cu no matter what you tell them they're not going to see it and it works on the other hand Hallelujah you know that's what I'm trying to say is my God and your God has tunn of vision Hallelujah when he sees you no matter what the Devil comes and tells him he can't even see it Hallelujah he cannot recognize it all he know is that you he is and he you know and the relationship that y'all have together it's a love that cannot be broken Hallelujah that is why that is why we cannot remain there in the seventh age of Brotherly kindness Hallelujah you canot remain there you must be United with God in love his love you understand me because once you are united with him in love you can say like Paul who shall separate me from the love of God hallelujah nothing can separate me nothing can separate you from the love of God Amen I hope I don't step on nobody's foot but I don't think much of a man when he's getting engaged and he give his his uh wife to be a little Diamond unless he can't afford if you can't afford it that's a different thing but they give a little Diamond that you almost need a magnifying glass to see it I know somebody like that that's why I'm preaching on now if you can't afford it that's all right give her the best you got but you going to give her the best you can give her Hallelujah I had a friend of mine who loved this girl and to be honest with you I thought she was ugly I really did there was no Beauty to be seen I I don't mean to be funny but it's the truth but he loved her so he loved her and I'm and I know he did he went out and got her such a big diamond it was no fake either and fake it was huge now these are little but it was it was such a huge diamond I thought where did you get I asked him he he said well I I got it on [Music] credit I'm not finished paying for it yet Hallelujah but you see that is the kind of a thing that a a a man will do when he really really love a woman because she's materialistic hello she like nice things and so he worked that area you brothers who not married yet I'm telling you so my point is and that's what God he does the same thing when you first get saved he gives you almost any everything you want that's the truth he's he's moving he's moving in that realm to just make you even love him even more Hallelujah come on somebody and what is he doing he's bringing into that Harmony I'm way off my notes but anyway amen let me get back to that what happens we must come into the harmony with God I I I look at myself and I think oh my god look how far you have brought me see y'all don't know me but when I was a sinner I was a sinner don't look at me like I'm going to tell you nothing I ain't telling you nothing but that right I was a sinner hallelujah hallelujah and when God saved me I didn't even know I could be saved but when he saved me he saved me I was so bad my whole neighborhood heard and you know my whole neighborhood said it'll never last Hallelujah my own brother-in-law brought me a Coke 45 right after church here but had no idea the old man was dead y'all y'all hear me that was no temptation but if that had happened before I got saved oh yeah it would have happened you know what I'm saying so that's that's just a little example hallelujah hallelujah I was a real dancer Hallelujah I love the dance and that stuff they doing right now I would have found a way y understand what I'm saying hey and when they told me I couldn't dance you saved now you can't do that oh I went through a trauma I went through a birth Hallelujah and then God gave me another dance y' he never takes anything from you and don't give you something better let me move on let let me move on now notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until he seen of the father or the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ see John 5:19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it that's the part shows her she receives it and she never doubt it y understand how many of us believe that we're more than conquerors I'm not talking about how you feel I'm talking about what you received in your heart your feelings will always deceive you Hallelujah your feelings will make you lazy when you're not even lazy Hallelujah let me move on is this okay I'm trying to bring you to a place where I know some of y'all know these but if I could just reiterate it if I could just redo it or resounded to do something within us because remember all the shouting we do all the dancing we do doesn't make that it it's good to do it Hallelujah is that all right think about what we what we experience on New Year Hallelujah and how many of you have been struggling since then you understand what I'm saying hallelujah amen but you see that makes you feel good but listen you need something that's going to keep you something that's going to hold you and that's where the word of God comes in yeah you got to understand that you must become the word hallelujah it's not your flesh your flesh will be changed but that inner man must become a strong man you must become United hallelujah hallelujah somebody was saying just the other night I I don't know what what you were thinking but when we took communion I was so blessed by it because it it proved to me that you you you got something that you're not afraid of covid-19 you're not afraid of the corona something was in you that made you do what you did Hallelujah you wasn't doing that to impress the pastor there was something in you that made you love God and trust God to do what keep you well Hallelujah we know it's real Hallelujah but we know who God is can I say it like this like I said the other night this one woman who said that oh she was so excited to take the covid test and she said you know science has always been my God would love to preach to that lady and show her how science has failed us through year after year after year after Hallelujah now they trying to push this vaccine on you people have been getting sick some people have been deformed by it all kinds of stuff you understand me now see what I'm trying to say is that even nurses who have taken this vaccine caught the caught the virus and they were surprised how can you be surprised when they gave you coic in your arm you asked for it you got it Hallelujah why would you be surprised anybody that takes the flu shot if you take a flu shot you going to get the what [Music] Hallelujah that's why I don't take it yall understand what I'm saying my point is this people is going to come down the road you going to have to make a decision whether you going to trust God or trust science Hallelujah yeah and they've already they've already passed the law off the Record but they've already passed a law if something's happened to you you cannot sue them you can't sue them who don't how you going to sue them you can't so they want to put something in your body that's going to transform you into something and when it does you're on your [Music] own you love the Lord I don't know why that was for somebody let's let's go back to the message you don't mind do you now listen you and I must understand that every age produced what God said they were going to produce you know we don't have to say oh Lord I'm bright I'm bright I'm briide I'm briide I'm bride I'm bride I'm bride that doesn't make you bride bride is elected bride is already been chosen bride is predestinated you become bride and don't even know why you bride somebody help me here you bride and don't know why you're bride all you can do is see your failes Hallelujah because he's not looking at your failes he's looking at your election amen amen Amen brother R blashe was the name in Blasphemous names he says each one of these ages had that rock confession y know what the Rock confession is re they had their own Revelation they had a revelation something to stand on the Saints are sleeping waiting waiting waiting waiting see until until this age but you but what about this age see we can't be like the Pentecostals and there's more for us y'all hear what I'm saying I don't even know how to say it that's what brother grieve the prophet of God it grieve brother BR he said we've seen Miracles we've seen signs we've seen wonders Hallelujah in the midst of all of that he said that's not it he healing of the sick raising of the dead he said but that's not it that's what he said that's not what I'm trying to get you to Hallelujah I'm trying to take you farther he say hallelujah he said look at the Pentecost he said we've had all of that we've had all of that we don't God don't have to prove himself on that we've already had that Hallelujah but there is a super Church there is a church that's on the move and she's being formed and shaped into His Image right now everybody won't see it everybody won't believe it but there are people right now even in this little group whom God is forming and shaping you don't see it you don't see it because right now it's behind the veil Hallelujah but there's coming a time that God is going to unveil everybody he's living in hallelujah amen yes sir he said but soon the Holy Ghost being poured out from Christ will come come and will seal up the church then the church will be raptured it'll be a complete unit of God a bride for Christ who will be the head of all things Hallelujah so you saying what are we just here for church service no let's put it this way 2020 should have given you Clear Vision Hallelujah if last year didn't open your eyes to something if last year didn't open your eyes to who you are Hallelujah there's something's wrong with your vision Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying you know it may not have been natural sight but a spiritual sight there was a time that Samson realized who he was and what his purpose was he had forgotten about it many of the people in the message have forgotten what their purpose is hallelujah but 2020 should have awakened us hallelujah to our existence to who we are and what we are come for hallelujah hallelujah you got to know that you're bride like I said we're not just uh we we we're we're just not um survivors but we're Overcomers and to be an overcomer is to get the better of the of the struggle or conflict Hallelujah you might be on your back and your opponent may be on the top but because you are overc hallelujah hallelujah that devil cannot remain on the top we not one to say I yield I yield not to the devil H I don't care what bad habit you might have over I don't care what the devil might have you bondage to you are Overcomer he cannot remain on the top because there's something in you that keeps pushing you something in you that keeps driving you you must overcome this bad habit you must overcome this devil you're more than a conqueror hallelujah hallelujah amen let me tell you something even in the human mind you can still defeat Devils huh you resist the devil the Bible said he'll flee from you some people say well he still smokes because he doesn't have the Holy Ghost no he still smokes CU he want [Music] to hello hello because when you don't want to smoke one more you stop you don't even need the Holy Ghost to stop smoking that's just an example y'all hear what I'm saying don't put that on the Holy Ghost the world stop smoking amen without any kind of help they just say within themselves I'm not going to do it [Music] again well I need the Holy Ghost if I'm going to stop drinking no you don't you don't need the Holy Ghost you just need a a determined mind you know we don't want to suffer we don't want to suffer y'all know what I'm saying but let me tell you what most of us are sugar addicts y'all don't know that right but most of us are that Sugar call on your name any time of the day or night and you GNA go get it what are you talking about I'm addict it's with sugar y look at me like but I'm determined to overcome I can't allow Paul said I'm I'm not in bondage to nothing nothing will I allow if I want candy let it be because I want to and not because I've got to find it y'all think I don't know what I'm talking about yeah I knew a brother who was hooked on Mountain Dew one of the worst drink you could ever drink and don't tell me it taste that no it Mountain Dew tastes real good yeah it is a good mountain Hallelujah but you got to understand by God's grace amen that you got to overcome everything now let me move on I'm just going on to something here so I want you to understand you're not surviving well I ain't going to drink as many as I used to no you're just surviving now mhm is that okay now the Pentecostal age it was a age of impersonation did y'all know that brother bam even said it there was a there was demons among the Pentecostals in our day in our day they actually thought that people actually thought that was the Holy Ghost how many of y'all knew that yeah that's he said it he said it Hallelujah I'll read a quote to you if you don't mind he said thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the Rapture had not [Music] come he said in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings and the manifestation in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you he said in it also was demon power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not the real these people even before the generation had appeared organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did you said what do you mean let me ask the question cuz I want you to remain free in this message you must remain free and you'll never be continue to be free if you compare yourself with other churches you understand what I'm saying you got people with Creeds and dogmas now that if you don't believe it this way you're not in the message that's hog wash that's it that's Tommy Rod Heart wash oh dirty water what are you saying where was the Pharisees and the Sadducees when the woman caught in adultery was saved where was the Pharisees and Sadducees when God called Matthew yall understand me where was the Pharisees and the Sadducees when God saved the woman at the well they had nothing to do with that no man has anything to do with your salvation you understand me no man can put you in and no man can take you out it doesn't matter what kind of Lifestyle you used to live God says your mind nothing can change that Hallelujah you're the kind that God wants to save God didn't come he didn't come to save The Righteous he came to save the unrighteous hallelujah hallelujah you know um we we the the power and and let me let me move on cuz I want to hurry up and finish this cuz I've gone long the Holy Ghost brings us to a place to recognize that the word of God what we must live by Hallelujah brother brandom whole purpose was to restore and bring us back to the true revelation of this word hallelujah hallelujah and I'm going tell you something if you having trouble reading this there is something wrong in your spirit hallelujah hallelujah cuz how can you say I love God and don't love his word you can't you can't love one and the other no God and His word is one Hallelujah let me move on on with Christian Soldiers I am identified the prophet God said with all of the word of God hallelujah is that all right every victory is mine is that right and I'm closing in just a minute is it true brother Bram said it like this every Victory Jesus won you won I don't understand it but one thing for certain I was there hallelujah hallelujah I was there that's why I believe this message Hallelujah it's something in me that makes me know that when God told him or asked him how many squirrels do you want hallelujah hallelujah something inside of me makes me know I was there I can't even explain it but I know I was there because I believe it even though I haven't seen it with my natural eyes Hallelujah and when that little fish she was raised from the dead I can identify with that I know it's possible and I know that it happened because it was God in the man Hallelujah when God told him to speak to the storm Hallelujah I was there hallelujah what are you saying brother BRS I tried myself oh my mind what are you saying there's a little there was a storm brewing there was a storm coming here in the mo a very bad storm and you know I I told the church we need to speak to the storm Hallelujah we got witnesses we spoke to the storm and the storm bassed us Hallelujah and the news people said we don't know what happened Hallelujah the same thing they said when brother Ram did it they said when the church got together you know what we said to the Lord he said God we want to have church Hallelujah you say it didn't happen it even happened this this uh uh uh uh New Year's we were supposed to get a ice storm in the morning Hallelujah I said God I want to have church would you just move the storm Hallelujah and God move the storm you don't have to believe it but I know it happen y'all hear what I'm saying if you say to this mountain he th move and believe in your heart it shall be given unto you Hallelujah this is not a brother Brook's thing this is a bride's thing all of us have the same Authority and have the same power Hallelujah my wife will tell you there was a lady a sister she was going to have a baby and they the doctor says her baby was going to have spinal bifida Hallelujah and she needed to abort the baby and she needed to abort the baby I said nonsense nonsense that baby is going to come out home that baby is going to come out well Hallelujah they kept the baby and the baby was born naturally and healthy hallelujah hallelujah I don't care what they had or what she had the word of God cannot be conquered somebody help me the word can't be conquered that's what you got to understand when that inspiration strike you don't you try to reason it you just speak the word and leave it up to God hallelujah I know some of y'all might not don't don't believe this but I can't tell you how many times I've roll are driven down the highway Hallelujah with the needle on E no gas in the tank no gas in the tank Hallelujah even the needle said there a no gas no gas station around around H oh come on y'all you pray and all of a sudden God takes control Hallelujah that's the God we serve this is the kind of message we're under all things are possible to them that believe Hallelujah you ought to be tired of the devil shaking your life Hallelujah you need to fight back you soldier in the army of the Lord come on somebody Hallelujah listen and you don't have to feel it well I'm waiting till the bat of lightning strike me I'm waiting till a Russian Wind come in need the lightning I don't need the wind I got the maker of the lightning I got the maker of the Wind on the inside Hallelujah and God is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah is that the Bible the Bible says fear not little flock it is the it is the will of the father to give you the kingdom don't you want the kingdom kingdom is yours hallelujah hallelujah amen Endor to the heart in the message doors to the heart y'all believe this and brother said it like this and the word will defeat the Devil anywhere anywhere anytime under any conditions circum Hallelujah I'm going read that again and the word will defeat the Devil anywhere anytime under any condition Jesus proved it when he defeated Satan not using his power but just on the word of the father hallelujah hallelujah it is written it is written and he defeated him I don't have to defeat deat the devil with speaking in tongues I don't have to defeat the Devil with a singing all I got to do is speak the word that's all you got to do people speak the word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah coming from Life the message life 1958 Hallelujah he says now Christian Church should have real character then and if the Life of Christ is in the Church of Christ then it's got to have the character of Christ it'll produce the Life of Christ hallelujah it's just no more than just what we call in the South Common Sense Hallelujah if it's in you it will produce him see y'all get sad when I say stuff like that what is he producing in you Hallelujah I tell you just like I try to tell people maybe you hadn't stirred up the Kool-Aid long enough it's been a while how many of y'all drank Kool-Aid y'all know what Kool-Aid is and if you set that Kool-Aid in the refrigerator long enough all the sugar goes to the [Music] bottom and if you don't Stir It Up and you just go get your glass that first glass of Kool-Aid is going to taste like you don't have any sugar hallelujah what your problem is you haven't stirred the Kool-Aid in a long time Hallelujah get that sugar in there see what I'm saying some of y'all looking at me in a [Music] strange stir up the Kool-Aid if you don't know what I'm talking about buy you some Kool-Aid get you some water make some Kool-Aid set it and then you understand the revelation will come to you Hallelujah is that all right righto listen and identify with Christ of all ages I'm trying to wrap it up and So Divine Healing the main thing is Divine Healing of the soul the body of Christ it needs healing worse than anything that I know of is the body of Christ is the body of Christ it's been so broken yeah okay oh see yeah he's basically saying the body of Christ need healing worse than anything he knows he says you in bad the body of Christ is in bad shape is what he's saying hello this is in 19 1964 hallelujah hallelujah y'all don't think so huh but the prophet said it and if that was in 1964 which they were doing better than what we doing now H y'all hear what I'm saying then where are we we need healing of the Soul we've got so many things in our lives to we're losing our identity Hallelujah Jesus is still the bomb of Gilead he still can heal and he still delivers you amen am amen huh he said it's been so broken up by men's Theology and denominational differences until it's a sick body and I tell you it needs healing great great healing I trust the Lord will do a great thing toward the healing of his part of the body that's in here and and I'm wrapping it but we must understand it's all right to be sick even brother Bram said you don't go to the doctor and don't take his medicine if you going to go to the doctor and you don't take his medicine and you don't get well don't blame the doctor and he liking that to God and God is bringing you the word and you don't take the word that will bring you healing don't blame God Hallelujah is that all right if you don't have joy in your life don't blame God I tell you last night I had my grandboys grandbabies with me and well he might be listening I don't want to Hur his feelings but you know what I tell you what it was about three o'clock before I got to bed got to sleep and I woke up this morning I was like Lord have mercy on me I was so tired but all things work together because when you feel like a fair that's when God uses you you know we said the other night and I want you to understand when God changes his mask that's what brother say he never changes his character or his nature but he changes his mask I can't help believe that I'm one of the mask of God you've got to believe the same thing and if you believe that God is in you then you become an invincible Army you're going to be challenged you're going to be challenged that's part it it's part of the battle but one thing for certain I'm a Overcomer Hallelujah I will not go down with a surrender flag Hallelujah the only surrendering I'm surrendering to is God himself there's other qu that I could read but I'm going to close it the brother brother says that God was in Moses God was in Joseph definitely God was in Jesus God was in Paul God was in William brandham and God is in you so when God is in you let let God show himself Hallelujah y'all understand what I mean by that Hallelujah Hallelujah you know when uh when I when when I used to drink and I used I used to I used to work in a club so and I I used to drink you know and when you got drunk you know that's that's one of those things I don't care for at at Communion when they wiping the glass and all that like you going to catch something cuz I know when I to get drunk you pass the bottle ain't nobody wiping nothing that's the farthest thing from your mind you you see one chling down wait hold up buddy you know and sometime it get down to that little corner you say hey give me that corner and and I'll be honest you I I used to so love wine y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but when God delivered me I can drink real wine right now and never have to worry about going back to drinking wine that's the real that's real Deliverance cuz cuz I'm not a a recovering alcoholic that's science when God delivers you he take it out hallelujah hallelujah y'all understand what I'm saying that's what you need God to do take it out Hallelujah huj you know the Lord so what I'm trying to say is this when when it comes to you and I us we need to just start sharing the can I say it like this sharing the bottle let's share the wine I ain't talking about natural stuff I'm talking about this one let's get each other drunk and have a good time over the word of God is that right oh it's a truth it's a truth I remember one time I got so drunk I didn't know where I was Hallelujah I
