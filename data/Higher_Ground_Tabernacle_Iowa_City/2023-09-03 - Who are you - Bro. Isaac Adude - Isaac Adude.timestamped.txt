[21:03] hearts and I believe many among
[21:08] us what we
[21:13] need we believe that you just grant unto
[21:16] our need
[21:17] Lord come and help us
[21:21] Lord we've got a need of
[21:25] food we've got need of clothing
[21:29] we've got need of
[21:31] home and we've got need of moving
[21:38] around and we want to feel happy in your
[21:43] presence I believe that you that blessed
[21:46] our fathers in all
[21:49] time you going to do the same thing with
[21:51] your children
[21:53] today we love
[21:57] God
[21:58] your people are important
[22:04] people there the people for whom you've
[22:06] given your
[22:08] life you spread your
[22:12] blood to make us your sons and
[22:19] daughters and I believe the sense of
[22:22] this
[22:24] sacrifice as to impact Our Lives Lord
[22:28] and we got to
[22:31] understand that we not just ordinary
[22:33] people on this
[22:34] Earth but we have to
[22:38] understand that we are the creatures of
[22:43] Eternity and we've just made a stay
[22:48] on while we living on this Earth
[22:52] Lord we don't have to for to forget
[22:55] about our
[22:56] origin
[22:59] that's why we have to be to behave
[23:01] accordingly
[23:08] Lord we got to behave like princess and
[23:11] prince
[23:13] Lord while we living on this Earth of
[23:19] sin though we living on this Earth of
[23:21] trouble and
[23:25] difficulties let none of us God about
[23:28] his original from
[23:30] heaven and you've made us
[23:35] Lord the full print of your being
[23:40] Lord you've made us the Delight of your
[23:44] glory and it should be written in your
[23:50] scriptures that is about us that are
[23:53] that they're talking in the scroll of
[23:55] the
[23:56] book being the people of the
[24:01] book it means we've got the word of God
[24:03] in
[24:06] us and you've placed this word of God in
[24:08] us since the time of
[24:11] Eternity and you wanted us to be
[24:13] manifest upon
[24:16] you so that we we may manifest
[24:24] your every day that we
[24:26] walk
[24:28] we got to watch to our
[24:32] ways we don't have to compare ourselves
[24:34] to other creatures of the
[24:37] Earth because when we see what is
[24:39] happening upon the Earth
[24:42] today we see that many people don't have
[24:45] that in
[24:46] them and they behave like animals
[24:50] Lord but us we are the sons and
[24:52] daughters of
[24:54] God youve taken care of
[24:56] us
[24:58] and he sent us a wonderful
[25:01] message this message has come to bring
[25:04] us

[25:13] things and is taking us to the
[25:17] top the message is taking us to the

[25:50] Lord we got to
[25:54] know that we may we may before
[25:59] people we may hide before
[26:05] people but there's always a little voice
[26:08] in us that is telling us that we

[26:16] secret but God is in us and he's talking
[26:20] to

[1:07:19] amen Mark 11 verse
[1:07:22] 22-25
[1:07:28] on my way down here I was driving
[1:07:32] with when I was driving down
[1:07:37] here I had a thought I wanted to preach
[1:07:40] about something
[1:07:43] else my subject was going to be
[1:07:46] manifested in the
[1:07:50] flesh amen but the convers the that we
[1:07:54] were having in the
[1:07:59] car me to change my my sermon this
[1:08:04] morning so we pray that it's the leading
[1:08:07] of the Holy
[1:08:08] Spirit we pray that it is the leading of
[1:08:11] the holy
[1:08:14] spirit amen and somebody now needs
[1:08:22] to
[1:08:26] let's turn to Mark
[1:08:31] 11 uh we read the verse 22 to
[1:08:37] 25 the Bible says and Jesus answering
[1:08:40] sayith unto them have faith in
[1:08:47] God you for verily I say unto you that
[1:08:50] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:08:53] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:08:56] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:08:59] but shall believe that those things
[1:09:01] which he sath shall come to pass he
[1:09:04] shall have whatsoever
[1:09:20] he therefore I say unto you what things
[1:09:24] soever you desire When you pray believe
[1:09:28] that you receive them and you shall have
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:38] them and when you stand praying
[1:09:41] forgive if you have ought against any
[1:09:45] that your father also which is in heaven
[1:09:47] May forgive you your
[1:09:52] trespasses
[1:10:02] amen I like the verse 24 so I'm going to
[1:10:04] read it
[1:10:06] again amen the Bible says that therefore
[1:10:09] I say unto you that whats
[1:10:17] you amen notice here the Bible didn't
[1:10:19] say God didn't say whatsoever I
[1:10:22] desire
[1:10:25] amen but the Bible says whatsoever
[1:10:31] youire amen so he did not name the kind
[1:10:34] of Desire that you
[1:10:38] have but it's all included in that verse
[1:10:42] whatever
[1:10:47] youire when you
[1:10:50] pray believe that you receive them and
[1:10:55] you shall have
[1:10:58] them amen if we can have that same faith
[1:11:01] and thatal
[1:11:05] attitude amen I will assure you that at
[1:11:07] the end of the before even this
[1:11:16] service because the word of God doesn't
[1:11:20] lie amen let's pray again
[1:11:24] father God we just read your word
[1:11:27] Lord Lord as a human we can only read
[1:11:30] and turn the
[1:11:33] P Lord but you are the only one who can
[1:11:36] give us the revelation of
[1:11:39] the that's why Lord I pray father Lord
[1:11:42] that you come down and you to us this
[1:11:46] morning Lord bless the hearts that will
[1:11:48] receive this
[1:11:50] word father God let build our faith
[1:11:53] again one more
[1:11:55] time thank you Jesus in Jesus Christ
[1:11:59] name we pray
[1:12:00] amen amen you may be
[1:12:03] seated uh for a
[1:12:06] few time uh we will wanted to share with
[1:12:10] you a little
[1:12:15] subject we entitle who are
[1:12:21] you amen who are you
[1:12:24] amen I preached this uh last time in
[1:12:30] De I feel like preaching it
[1:12:36] again so who are
[1:12:38] you amen here it's not asking about you
[1:12:42] telling us your name or where you from
[1:12:48] or but the question is what is your
[1:12:51] relationship with God
[1:12:55] amen who are you to
[1:12:58] God Amen because you need to have faith
[1:13:02] somehow amen and as you go and when you
[1:13:05] have faith you need to When you pray you
[1:13:07] need to know who you
[1:13:10] are amen if somebody comes now and ask
[1:13:13] me to pray for
[1:13:16] him amen I will pray for him as being a
[1:13:19] servant of
[1:13:21] God Amen I I have faith that it's God
[1:13:24] who sent me to
[1:13:27] pre so therefore I have that duty to
[1:13:30] pray for that
[1:13:32] person because I know who I am to
[1:13:35] God Amen and I know who God is to
[1:13:39] me amen so now who are
[1:13:42] you amen so we have to know that faith
[1:13:45] is the
[1:13:48] key amen I'm sorry the word is the
[1:13:52] key and faith is the is the hand that
[1:13:56] opens the key to that
[1:13:59] door am so you can read entire
[1:14:03] Bible you can't read entire
[1:14:06] Bible read that same Bible three times
[1:14:10] four amen but if you don't have the
[1:14:13] faith to apply those things in your
[1:14:18] life that means
[1:14:20] nothing because notice that when we
[1:14:23] starting in verse
[1:14:25] 22 amen Jesus started by saying that
[1:14:28] have faith in
[1:14:31] God so every time we go to God In
[1:14:34] Prayer am we must first have faith in
[1:14:38] him am amen we must first believe in
[1:14:44] him know who he is to
[1:14:46] us so that we know that when we go to
[1:14:49] him in
[1:14:50] prayer amen he will give it to us
[1:14:54] an example I give a little kid you have
[1:14:56] a little
[1:14:57] child amen who wants something from his
[1:15:00] dad or his
[1:15:02] parent it doesn't matter how many times
[1:15:04] the dad says
[1:15:08] no as long as he still needs that
[1:15:13] thing amen he will come after after and
[1:15:20] after Amen to ask about that same
[1:15:25] until the will be fed up of saying no
[1:15:30] what because you know the child knows
[1:15:32] that this is my
[1:15:35] dad this is my
[1:15:38] mom and I'm a child and I'm in need so
[1:15:42] technically they are required to give me
[1:15:44] what I
[1:15:47] need so when he's asking his parents
[1:15:50] something amen that kid would not ask
[1:15:53] ask as if he's asking to his
[1:15:57] uncle because he said that when when he
[1:15:59] knows that when if I ask my Uncle my
[1:16:01] uncle says no and that's it I won
[1:16:06] ask if I ask my dad my dad says
[1:16:10] no amen I will try after I will try to
[1:16:13] behave and
[1:16:16] do do my house stuff and clean the house
[1:16:19] and just to make him happy and then go
[1:16:20] back and
[1:16:22] ask
[1:16:27] amen and that's the same mental attitude
[1:16:29] we have to have towards
[1:16:32] God Amen when we go to God we have to
[1:16:35] know who he is to
[1:16:39] us amen so that we can have the faith to
[1:16:44] ask amen the prophet here says in the
[1:16:46] message if God be with us then we're all
[1:16:48] the
[1:16:52] Miracles
[1:16:54] amen he says that faith is not that
[1:16:58] loose
[1:17:02] loose that's
[1:17:13] not it's got to be based upon some noted
[1:17:21] fact you've got to know something about
[1:17:24] what you're having faith
[1:17:28] inen you can't just go to God and stop
[1:17:31] praying without even know who is God
[1:17:36] to amen you can't just stop praying
[1:17:38] without even know who you're asking it
[1:17:43] to so you've got to know something about
[1:17:46] what you having faith
[1:17:50] in before you can even have faith in it
[1:17:55] so we first must know how and
[1:18:01] what what the of God
[1:18:05] is what God's
[1:18:08] is and how to approach God by that
[1:18:13] plan and then we can walk up Bly to the
[1:18:17] throne of grace and plead what
[1:18:21] Isis
[1:18:24] amen it's by having faith in what
[1:18:28] ask amen it's by having faith to who you
[1:18:31] asking
[1:18:34] foren you have to know who God is to
[1:18:43] you amen through service I just want
[1:18:51] you amen and hopefully by the end of the
[1:18:54] service you can have an
[1:18:59] answer amen who
[1:19:01] are because theet
[1:19:08] says inag
[1:19:11] 33 it says that as I said the other
[1:19:15] day when we born of the spirit of
[1:19:20] God God is not weak one
[1:19:29] little
[1:19:34] sh just the little
[1:19:42] of then you've got
[1:19:46] all you got enough power in you to make
[1:19:49] a world and go out and live in it
[1:19:57] the prophet did not say that you need to
[1:19:59] have a
[1:20:02] bigger he did not say that you have to
[1:20:05] have I don't know what
[1:20:09] me but if you have that little that
[1:20:12] little faith that little
[1:20:14] faith amen that little of
[1:20:18] God Amen you've got all
[1:20:21] power you got the power of
[1:20:25] God living
[1:20:27] inside if you have God
[1:20:30] inside because you can take water from
[1:20:32] the
[1:20:35] sea and fill it up in this
[1:20:38] bottle amen and if you go to the lab and
[1:20:40] try to see the chemical uh the the
[1:20:43] chemical stuff in that water compare it
[1:20:46] to the
[1:20:51] water
[1:21:00] it it will have the same
[1:21:04] compound will have the same
[1:21:08] structure he will have the same
[1:21:11] DNA but this is just the smallest
[1:21:16] portion that
[1:21:19] big it doesn't make this one different
[1:21:22] the
[1:21:29] ofing the water of the ocean that's in
[1:21:32] the bottle will also be able to heal
[1:21:36] you same thing amen but in a
[1:21:41] small amen that's the same thing with
[1:21:43] the Holy
[1:21:44] Ghost the prophet says that in the
[1:21:46] beginning was the thought of
[1:21:49] God the beginning was the thought
[1:21:53] that thought was was was
[1:21:55] made that thought became the spoken
[1:22:00] word amen and that word amen God cond
[1:22:03] himself to a
[1:22:07] form
[1:22:16] amen amen so notice now in the upper
[1:22:20] room amen when the 100 I believe 12 were
[1:22:24] there in
[1:22:27] theer the Bible says that Tong of fire
[1:22:31] came amen and it was upon every one of
[1:22:36] them so technically what the Bible
[1:22:39] saying that one same big
[1:22:42] God Amen who was in there before the
[1:22:46] beginning who created
[1:22:48] everything amen who condensed himself to
[1:22:51] a form that we call the
[1:22:57] divided himself into
[1:23:00] different amen and went into every one
[1:23:03] of those people
[1:23:06] that why when they left their
[1:23:09] room these people were able to do the
[1:23:11] exact same thing that Jesus
[1:23:15] did why because their inside nature was
[1:23:19] changed they had God inside of them
[1:23:23] it didn't matter the big how big that
[1:23:25] portion was or small that
[1:23:28] portion that was still God
[1:23:32] inside that's why you can see Peter
[1:23:34] going
[1:23:35] out and say that silver and gold I have
[1:23:40] not but what I have I give
[1:23:43] it so now stand up and
[1:23:46] walk that's why you can see Paul
[1:23:49] walking and seeing people being healed
[1:23:52] by only
[1:23:54] tou what was that that was the same
[1:23:58] power of God that was
[1:24:00] living that was the same power of God
[1:24:03] walking
[1:24:05] inside had all
[1:24:08] power
[1:24:09] didn't how small that
[1:24:14] was God that was living
[1:24:17] inside and Peter when he went to when he
[1:24:19] started
[1:24:20] preaching he say that This Promise is
[1:24:23] for
[1:24:24] you is for your children amen and for
[1:24:28] how many as God
[1:24:30] will mean that we have that same promise
[1:24:33] for
[1:24:34] our meaning that if you have the holy
[1:24:36] spirit amen you have God inside of you
[1:24:40] you have all power of God Amen so you
[1:24:44] can lay your hands on the sick
[1:24:47] people you can ask God something and
[1:24:49] that will
[1:24:51] happen you have inside of
[1:24:54] you amen the prophet said that God is
[1:24:57] not weak in one place and strong in the
[1:25:01] other am just having that little shadow
[1:25:06] of gives you all the
[1:25:08] power he gives you that power that
[1:25:11] created the
[1:25:13] entire gives you that power that let the
[1:25:16] light
[1:25:19] be it gives you that power that LE be
[1:25:21] and that
[1:25:30] says that but if you are a son son of
[1:25:32] God or a daughter of
[1:25:35] God you've got the power of God
[1:25:38] in
[1:25:40] see so then that law holds that Faith to
[1:25:44] a certain
[1:25:49] thing amen if you call yourself a son or
[1:25:52] daughter of
[1:25:55] God you have the power of God inside of
[1:25:59] youen you have the god inside
[1:26:02] of so it doesn't matter what you're
[1:26:05] going
[1:26:08] through amen when you go through
[1:26:11] Tres or
[1:26:13] trials ask yourself this question who am
[1:26:18] I amen when you will have that
[1:26:21] answer
[1:26:22] amen you will know that you will have
[1:26:24] strength to
[1:26:30] over Amen in front of them was the king
[1:26:32] that was
[1:26:34] there amen the king said that if you
[1:26:36] don't worship me you cast into
[1:26:49] the the only thing that they knew
[1:26:53] they knew who they
[1:26:56] were and they knew who
[1:26:59] God they knew that they were God's
[1:27:03] servant and God will always come for
[1:27:06] their
[1:27:07] rescue so even when they were going to
[1:27:09] that
[1:27:10] fire amen they had no
[1:27:13] doubt amen that God will come
[1:27:16] for amen they had no doubt even though
[1:27:20] they get
[1:27:21] burned
[1:27:22] amen they had no doubt that they knew
[1:27:24] that they would never forsake God and
[1:27:26] God will always take
[1:27:31] care amen you have
[1:27:33] Daniel Amen when he was going to the
[1:27:36] alliance
[1:27:37] then amen it's something that has never
[1:27:40] happened
[1:27:42] before amen a man going to a den of
[1:27:45] lions that are hungry
[1:27:47] Haven
[1:27:51] days ask Daniel what helped you what
[1:27:53] hold you
[1:27:57] up he would tell you that I know who I
[1:28:01] am and I know who God is to me amen I
[1:28:05] know the God that I
[1:28:07] serve man I know that he's able to close
[1:28:10] to to shut the light the mouth of
[1:28:15] those amen I know who I
[1:28:19] am amen so we also the prophet here says
[1:28:22] in perfect
[1:28:25] Faith amen he says that now the only
[1:28:27] thing you have to do
[1:28:30] then is have faith in what you
[1:28:36] are amen have faith in what you
[1:28:40] are amen have faith in what the word
[1:28:43] says that you
[1:28:46] are and Jesus had faith in the word of
[1:28:51] God
[1:28:53] amen he had faith in the word of God
[1:28:54] that said what he
[1:28:59] was amen it is written of
[1:29:02] me didn't David say in the
[1:29:09] Psalms I am the bread of life that come
[1:29:13] from God out of
[1:29:16] Heaven A amen I am the Tree of Life from
[1:29:19] the Garden of
[1:29:20] Eden
[1:29:22] I'm all these
[1:29:24] things I am that I
[1:29:27] am and he knew with that perfect
[1:29:33] Faith amen that he was the anointed
[1:29:37] Messiah that that the spirit of God was
[1:29:40] upon
[1:29:42] him he said now I in myself do
[1:29:48] nothing but it's my faith in God
[1:29:53] and God was in
[1:29:55] him the word made
[1:29:58] manifest and when the word of God comes
[1:30:01] in
[1:30:03] you amen it's made
[1:30:05] manifest amen for you are a Believer for
[1:30:09] you are a
[1:30:11] Believer see and a
[1:30:14] Believer amen it's the faith of God that
[1:30:17] moves in

[1:30:22] says you
[1:30:23] are amen have faith in what Amen in in
[1:30:27] what you
[1:30:29] are amen Jesus had faith in what he
[1:30:34] was knew who exactly who he
[1:30:38] was look at when he went to that that
[1:30:42] foolish man the the
[1:30:47] maniac the devil they saw him

[1:47:16] friend I'm God's
[1:47:19] elect I'm a
[1:47:22] conqueror I'm loved by
[1:47:24] God Amen so I don't care what the devil
[1:47:27] can
[1:47:28] say am I don't care what the devil can
[1:47:31] do to
[1:47:32] me I know who I
[1:47:34] am I'm a
[1:47:36] conquerer a conqueror is somebody who
[1:47:39] wins
[1:47:40] battles amen a conqueror is somebody who

[1:48:06] amen I am God's
[1:48:07] elect I am the
[1:48:09] Conqueror amen I am loved by God Amen
[1:48:13] here the Bible did not even say that you
[1:48:16] are a
[1:48:18] conqueror he said that you are more than
[1:48:21] a
[1:48:22] con so the Bible trying to find words to
[1:48:25] explain who you
[1:48:27] are it say that being a conqueror is not
[1:48:32] enough but you are more than a
[1:48:35] conqueror Amen in all these things we

[1:48:40] conqueror through him that loved
[1:48:43] us he loves
[1:48:45] Meen who am I I'm more than a conqueror
[1:48:50] amen so this little troubles that I'm
[1:48:52] going
[1:48:53] through these little trials that I'm
[1:48:55] going
[1:48:57] through I know that there is coming a
[1:49:00] day my victory is
[1:49:02] coming I can't feel my victory
[1:49:05] coming so therefore I can go and profess
[1:49:08] that I'm a
[1:49:10] Victor therefore I can go and say that
[1:49:12] I'm a
[1:49:14] conquer I am more than a
[1:49:18] conqueror amen verse 38
[1:49:21] for I am
[1:49:23] persuaded that neither
[1:49:27] death that nether death verse
[1:49:31] 38 for I am
[1:49:37] persuaded that neither
[1:49:40] death nor
[1:49:42] life nor
[1:49:44] angels no
[1:49:46] principalities no powers nor things
[1:49:50] present or things to come no height nor
[1:49:55] depth nor any other SC creature shall be
[1:50:00] able to separate us from the love of God
[1:50:03] which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:50:19] lord
[1:50:31] amen I don't care if you call yourself
[1:50:33] an
[1:50:35] angel amen I don't care you say that God
[1:50:38] sent
[1:50:41] me I know one thing for
[1:50:44] sure you have no
[1:50:47] power to separate me from the love of
[1:50:49] God
[1:50:51] amen because he said that he loved
[1:50:53] me so if you are an
[1:50:56] angel amen take your angel and go
[1:50:59] back because you cannot separate me from
[1:51:02] the love of
[1:51:03] God I don't care even if I'm hungry or
[1:51:06] broke or
[1:51:08] whatever I know one thing for
[1:51:11] sure God loves
[1:51:14] me doesn't matter you throw me so
[1:51:18] high amen you throw me is so
[1:51:21] deep where there is no light or
[1:51:26] anything one thing will never
[1:51:29] change the love of
[1:51:31] God Amen so that's what one those three
[1:51:34] Hebrew
[1:51:36] children when they were going to that
[1:51:39] fire they knew one thing would not
[1:51:44] change even though they're
[1:51:47] burned they knew that the love of God
[1:51:50] will still
[1:51:51] there the love of God will always be
[1:51:54] present with
[1:51:55] him so we can walk and go to that
[1:51:59] fire still praise
[1:52:02] God amen amen
[1:52:07] amen they knew that so they were going
[1:52:11] to that
[1:52:12] fire praising God thanking God for
[1:52:16] his amen thanking God for his Mercy
[1:52:20] thanking God for calling them his
[1:52:24] elect they were not
[1:52:27] afraid because they knew who God was to
[1:52:31] them amen so therefore they could have
[1:52:33] they could
[1:52:35] go amen who are
[1:52:37] you I'm a friend of
[1:52:41] God Amen I am God's

[1:52:57] God Amen he chose me amen there is
[1:53:01] something about being chosen
[1:53:04] by amen sometimes you're trying to think
[1:53:07] in your entire life you try to do some
[1:53:09] you know
[1:53:12] thinking and ask yourself why did he

[1:53:36] me amen I have no answer for
[1:53:39] that amen he chose me I did not ask him
[1:53:43] to

[1:53:51] he will always be with me amen because
[1:53:54] he chose me he will always be with he

[1:54:06] the end of the
[1:54:08] world because he chose me amen I did not

[1:54:16] not holding his hand but he's holding my
[1:54:18] hand no matter even if my hand is
[1:54:22] tired amen I cannot just decide to let
[1:54:25] go because I'm not the one holding
[1:54:28] him he's the one
[1:54:31] holding every time I'm
[1:54:34] tired know that you can

[1:55:33] I don't know when trying to figure out
[1:55:36] why God chose you you will never
[1:55:41] come amen but one thing that you will

[2:06:11] [Music]
[2:06:17] verse
[2:06:23] John 15
[2:06:25] verse ver the bible say that if you
[2:06:28] abide in
[2:06:30] me and my words abide in you you shall
[2:06:34] ask what you will and it shall be done
[2:06:37] unto
[2:06:47] you
[2:06:49] amen look at the confidence coming from
[2:06:53] Jesus mouth when he's
[2:06:58] W amen he's telling you without a
[2:07:02] doubt that if you abide in
[2:07:05] me and my words abide in
[2:07:09] you then go ask whatever you
[2:07:12] want and it will be
[2:07:15] done why because you abide in
[2:07:19] me and my
[2:07:21] word abides in you amen what is the word
[2:07:25] of
[2:07:26] God Amen it's God
[2:07:28] himself amen what is the word of God the
[2:07:32] word is the very the thought is the very
[2:07:35] thought of
[2:07:37] God Amen the word of God that God was
[2:07:39] giving to
[2:07:41] Moses amen when people said that Moses
[2:07:43] don't talk anymore let you let God talk
[2:07:46] to you and you talk to us
[2:07:52] amen what was Moses
[2:07:55] transmitting telling the people the
[2:07:58] thought of
[2:07:59] [Music]
[2:08:00] godes was telling them the word of
[2:08:04] God so whatever Moses was
[2:08:07] saying it was the thought of God of
[2:08:09] their
[2:08:10] time amen and we say that we do believe
[2:08:13] in the
[2:08:15] message amen God sent us a prophet
[2:08:19] amen the prophet came with the word of
[2:08:21] God the word of God for our
[2:08:24] time amen and what is that
[2:08:27] word that word is the thought of God
[2:08:30] Amen so the message amen is the thought
[2:08:33] of God for our
[2:08:35] time it's the very thought of
[2:08:38] God what God was thinking amen now we
[2:08:42] have it in the
[2:08:44] books so notice that the Bible saying
[2:08:47] that in the beginning was the
[2:08:49] word and that word did not stop in word
[2:08:53] form that word was made
[2:08:56] flesh amen was made
[2:08:59] flesh amen and it became a human
[2:09:02] person what became a human
[2:09:05] person it was that same word amen so we
[2:09:09] have the word of God
[2:09:11] today and that word will not stop in
[2:09:13] written
[2:09:15] form that word has to become flesh
[2:09:19] amen that word has to start walking amen
[2:09:22] that word has to start speaking amen
[2:09:25] that word has to start
[2:09:27] touching people have to start touching
[2:09:29] that
[2:09:30] word amen and you are that word amen you
[2:09:34] are that word
[2:09:36] made you are the walking
[2:09:39] a you are the word of

[2:09:45] start
[2:09:46] walking amen and people will be
[2:09:49] weakness that we we' seen the word amen
[2:09:53] we've heard the

[2:10:12] my
[2:10:13] arm the word has no other mouth by my
[2:10:17] mouth God wants to speak to
[2:10:20] you amen he will have to use me to speak
[2:10:22] to
[2:10:24] you if God wants you to pray for your
[2:10:28] brother God will use you to go pray for
[2:10:30] your
[2:10:32] brother hallelujah amen let's go to
[2:10:35] First John chapter first John chapter
[2:10:39] [Music]
[2:10:42] one amen let's see what is that
[2:10:45] word first John chapter one
[2:10:55] amen here's John
[2:10:57] talking because notice that we sang that
[2:11:00] song the song leader sang that Jehovah
[2:11:03] of the old test
[2:11:11] of Amen first John chapter
[2:11:16] 1 amen the Bible say says that that
[2:11:19] which was from the
[2:11:21] beginning which we have heard which we
[2:11:25] have seen with our eyes which we have
[2:11:28] looked upon and our hands have handled
[2:11:32] of the word of
[2:11:47] life
[2:11:58] amen look which was from the beginning
[2:12:01] what was from the what was in the
[2:12:04] beginning the word was in the
[2:12:06] beginning
[2:12:10] John John one it that in the beginning
[2:12:12] was the
[2:12:14] word the word was with God and that word
[2:12:17] was God
[2:12:19] amen so here they said that that which
[2:12:21] we that that which was from the
[2:12:25] beginning what was from the
[2:12:28] beginning it was that word amen which we
[2:12:32] have
[2:12:33] heard what have we heard amen we've
[2:12:36] heard that word amen which we have seen
[2:12:40] with our
[2:12:42] eyes amen what have we seen amen we've
[2:12:45] seen that word manifest
[2:12:49] to be
[2:12:50] manifest amen it means that to become
[2:12:54] obvious become obvious to the human
[2:12:58] eye amen you can't see the
[2:13:01] word amen but here said that that's same
[2:13:04] thing that was from the
[2:13:06] beginning it's the same thing that we've
[2:13:08] heard and it's the same thing that we
[2:13:10] have seen with
[2:13:12] our so what have we seen with
[2:13:15] our amen we've seen the word
[2:13:18] amen but the word is something
[2:13:21] spiritual but the Bible says in John 1
[2:13:24] verse
[2:13:26] 14 that word was made man was made
[2:13:30] flesh was
[2:13:33] manifested that that word became obvious
[2:13:35] to the human
[2:13:37] ey that's why we were able to see
[2:13:40] it amen we we have looked upon
[2:13:44] it in our
[2:13:46] hands our hands have
[2:13:50] handled of That Word of
[2:13:53] Life we have heard that
[2:13:55] word amen we have seen that word amen
[2:13:59] our hands have touched that
[2:14:01] word amen because verse
[2:14:03] two he said that for that life for the
[2:14:06] life that was
[2:14:08] manifested and I mean I mean for the
[2:14:10] life for the life for the life was
[2:14:13] manifested and we have seen it and bear
[2:14:16] witness and show unto you that eternal
[2:14:20] life which was with the father and was
[2:14:24] manifested unto
[2:14:39] us amen John is saying that we bearing
[2:14:42] witness of
[2:14:44] that we giving you this so that you can
[2:14:47] fellowship with that
[2:14:51] was it was that same word that was in
[2:14:52] the
[2:14:54] beginning amen that same word that we
[2:14:56] have
[2:14:57] seen amen and what was that amen that
[2:15:01] was that eternal life that was with the
[2:15:05] father amen was that eternal life that
[2:15:08] was with the
[2:15:12] father amen now is manifested unto
[2:15:16] us amen that same
[2:15:19] Elohim the self-existing
[2:15:22] one amen the one that has no Beginning
[2:15:24] No
[2:15:25] End Amen now he's
[2:15:28] manifested amen and then he's giving us
[2:15:30] his
[2:15:32] word amen he's giving us his word amen
[2:15:36] and that word needs to have the
[2:15:38] flesh that word needs to be made flesh
[2:15:42] again amen and that word was not only
[2:15:44] made flesh with brother
[2:15:46] Brandon
[2:15:49] that word made flesh did not stop only
[2:15:53] 196 amen that word has to be
[2:15:57] made because Paul say I'm calling you
[2:16:00] walk in
[2:16:03] epist that you are the walking
[2:16:06] epist amen what what is an
[2:16:09] epist it's the word amen you are a
[2:16:13] walking so you are that word
[2:16:16] made so if the
[2:16:19] prophet amen with the word of God inside
[2:16:21] of
[2:16:22] him amen was able to create
[2:16:25] things was able to pray for
[2:16:28] people he was able to speak the
[2:16:31] word and God the Bible said the prophet
[2:16:34] himself
[2:16:35] says amen that Jesus God is Not Strong
[2:16:38] in one side and weak in the
[2:16:42] other if you have the little Shadow Of
[2:16:45] God inside of
[2:16:46] you
[2:16:48] you have all power of God
[2:16:52] in so meaning that you have that
[2:16:55] power to speak the word amen for your
[2:16:59] situation will be
[2:17:01] change amen you have the power to speak
[2:17:03] the

[2:17:14] and
[2:17:16] called
[2:17:19] amen the prophet says that when a
[2:17:21] Believer and God gets turning
[2:17:24] together the prophet say that when when
[2:17:26] the believer and God gets turning
[2:17:31] together it generates the power of of
[2:17:35] his
[2:17:38] resurrection when believer takes his
[2:17:41] word in their heart and begin to
