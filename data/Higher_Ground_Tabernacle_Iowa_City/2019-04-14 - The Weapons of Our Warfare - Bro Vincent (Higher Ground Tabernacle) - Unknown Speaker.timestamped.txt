[2:25:27] [Music]
[2:25:29] here sooner but we know how to pray we
[2:25:34] don't how to pray or should know how to
[2:25:36] pray or their fonts I welcome up here my
[2:25:39] mother who didn't know how to read or
[2:25:41] write my Americans I think my lyric she
[2:25:46] knew how to pray and some up here
[2:25:49] that woman brother Vincennes spoke up
[2:25:52] brother Branham that Aunt Jemima we
[2:25:57] don't know how much education she had
[2:25:59] community because sure but you don't
[2:26:01] have to have and be educated to pray she
[2:26:04] do I said my trade you can't procreate
[2:26:06] and prayer will change this church
[2:26:09] around and IPF's on generosity Kleiza we
[2:26:13] want to be a scriptural Church is that
[2:26:17] right man the Bible said they will know
[2:26:21] either we are his disciples you know
[2:26:24] some say BC because of the love that we
[2:26:27] have one to order
[2:26:29] and that only comes through prayer is it
[2:26:33] not a vehicle Tommy I love it when
[2:26:35] people talk about prayer
[2:26:38] as one thing brother Ram said you cannot
[2:26:40] do enough City the shores gift you can't
[2:26:43] overdo prayer because the Bible says
[2:26:46] pray without ceasing
[2:26:49] PSSs you love the Lord I said yeah as I
[2:26:54] understand you look upon my brother Alan
[2:26:57] is no longer with us
[2:26:59] not a friend they please BCC I tried to
[2:27:05] contact him you just see the contactee
[2:27:07] more than once
[2:27:09] pooja for I don't know his reasons she
[2:27:13] said by a father myself zone but I do
[2:27:16] miss it a bit mom for a moment and if
[2:27:20] let's pray that we we could at least
[2:27:22] talk with him he was something I said I
[2:27:27] don't know but it could have been
[2:27:30] misunderstood I don't know patience
[2:27:33] apply but I'm not against any
[2:27:34] ministership on television that will
[2:27:38] have spread this gospel see they have
[2:27:43] opposite emoji whether it be here or
[2:27:45] whether it be there gets us what you see
[2:27:48] the important thing is that the gospel
[2:27:51] be spread
[2:27:52] limp or thoughts a kick and if on
[2:27:53] Sheila's waffler mommy Bundy that was
[2:27:56] Paul's attitude so I said Tillich it was
[2:27:58] brother branham's attitude no she
[2:28:00] allegedly different enough and that's
[2:28:01] Miami T so we see why not you treats
[2:28:03] mother and I don't want him if he's out
[2:28:06] there doing the work of God
[2:28:09] if he's out there doing the work of God
[2:28:11] [Music]
[2:28:13] did you I don't want to stand against
[2:28:16] him sure if anything gives us on Sherman
[2:28:18] talking to me I want to stand with him
[2:28:21] and she said I think really suited him
[2:28:23] and he needs to know that yeah you know
[2:28:25] stuff works IQ the only certainty is
[2:28:27] that right it's a it's only one body
[2:28:30] sinner sell coffee lover and that's the
[2:28:33] body of Christ and they've got the
