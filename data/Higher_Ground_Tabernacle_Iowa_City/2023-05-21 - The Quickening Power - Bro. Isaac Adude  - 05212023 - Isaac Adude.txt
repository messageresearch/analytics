you amen we agree that it's been a long time amen but uh just pray the Lord that will enjoyed this you know time that we'll spend together amen without taking too much time let's go straight to the word let's open our Bibles in the Book of Romans chapter 8 read the verse 9 to verse 11. foreign Romans chapter 8 verse 9 to verse 11. or uh we can start at verse verse 5 to verse 11. Romans chapter 8 verse 5 to verse 11. and then the Bible says for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh by day that after a spirit the things are data the things of the spirit s alone for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritual minded spiritually minded is life and peace verse 7 because the carnal mind is in enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be foreign so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God Allah because we know the Bible says that the only way you can worship God is in spirit and Truth amen verse 9 the Bible continues and say that but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his verses [Music] verse 10 and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness 11 s amen verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your moral bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you that's the answer is [Music] again verse 11 the Bible says that but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your moral bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you is amen let's go to uh John chapter 14. we read the verse 13 to verse 20. John Chapter 14 verse 13 to verse 20. even the Bible says that and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father be glorified in the son foreign if you ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the word cannot receive because he seeth him not neither nor with him but he know him for he Duality with you and shall be in you versed he said let's pray everyday [Music] amen Verse 18 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you a little while and the world seeth me no more by ye see me because I live and you shall live also please [Music] verse 21 he that has my commandment and keep with them it is that love with me and he that love with me shall be loved by my father and I will love him and I will manifest myself [Music] amen so what is that spirit when the word cannot receive members so then he jumped again into verse 20 he says that and at that day you shall know me and you shall know [Music] amen so if you read the verse this chapter 14 of John amen it looks like there is three people here Jesus is talking about two other people circumcision [Music] we don't believe foreign [Music] [Music] in the Old Testament images [Music] [Music] amen and that flesh dwells where they dwelled with us a set share [Music] how is Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] okay okay [Music] foreign [Music] amen amen so the entire Christian the entire Christianity is based on Resurrection Christianity amen we see in the Old Testament amen the resurrection happened amen we see it in the life of Jesus after his death now foreign say that well let me build this wall and then the grass will not come soon you won't be able to keep their life I mean it doesn't matter how many days you've been uh how many years you've been spending a tune is amen we know that the Bible says that the spirit quickens so they always work the appear amen you cannot have one and live the others amen if you read if you listen to the message you will always hear the prophet talking about the mechanic and the Dynamics amen you see that Jesus Christ amen his body was the word amen but he needed to have the dynamic amen that's why John said that I saw the spirit of God coming down that perfect combination amen of the mechanic and the Dynamics because the spirit amen gives life to the word amen the spirit gives life to the world the spirit quickly in the message the Easter seal down foreign [Music] amen it's the same thing with cars amen you cannot only have gasoline and hope that the call will start amen you need the spark and the girls because the spark burns the gas line the spark is the fire amen that will burn that gasoline amen that will help the car to start if I fear that's why they say that we need the Holy Spirit and fire amen the Holy Spirit and fire Amen to burn that gasoline amen amen amen you see that that same spirit amen the quick and the disciples he said that because I live you shall live also amen that's a great promise amen Because He Lives amen and because he lives it doesn't matter where I'm buried amen I know that I have a problem amen amen let's read the prophet here real quick he's only Prophet Amen in the message it it uh it is the rising of the sun paragraph 213. I have this one this entrees amen talking about that same quickening power the prophet says that it changed them amen that quickening power changed them he's talking about the disciple he changed the disciples it made them different there were a changed people from then on amen he quickened them from no life of being a coward said to like the lion of the tribe of Judah uh they absolutely uh face uh martyrdom [Music] now listen here's another thing amen it's so quick and them in such a way it's so quickened them in such a way to you know what they was lifted up in Heavenly places and the Mortal bodies was so quick and tell their language changed amen that's what the Bible says their mortal body being Quicken their language was quickened their thoughts were quick their Spirit were quicker their life work weekends they were quick and all together amen they tried to talk and couldn't talk anymore in the human language amen there was so quick and up in the presence of God is still they spoke in the new tongue foreign so if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you Allah it will Quicken your mortal body uh it'll make you do things you didn't do before the shows there was full of the Holy there was full of the power then he said Allah amen that spirit that quickening spirit amen did not only change their physical the spiritual being he also changed their physical beings you see Peter who was the coward amen Peter who couldn't talk to Peter who was afraid to be identified as Christ amen but after their Spirit came and giving them the the giving them the medicine to receive the holy spirit amen you see that same Peter amen walking down the street of Jerusalem a beggar started saying asking him for silver Monday amen what was he giving to him and he was transferring their power he was giving him that power he was giving him that quickness amen or it had the attributes of healing in its available that's why that man started jumping Thomas couldn't walk before amen but was transferred the spirit amen yeah healed him at the same place amen without making any prayers amen without praying foreign [Music] the Old Testament people did not have this presence amen you aren't aware of that amen you you refer back sometimes to Elijah to Moses and to those people Moses and Elijah and those people were great men ordained by God but yet not the privilege that you have they did not have the power giving them giving them to perform as you have God everything that's in Christ amen they didn't have everything that's in Christ amen but you have everything what are you talking about amen Jesus Christ himself amen amen the father amen pour everything into him amen and he poured everything to them foreign dispensation amen Paul Paul talking about that perfect that will come and they all foresaw it even Abraham talking about that City they all had dreams about it they still wanted to be in there the prophecy that they believed in itself they embraced it amen they believed in it his uncle amen but we are living in this man we are living in it right before exactly so what are we doing what are we doing about it man we keep on pushing in the face which means that we have to see the same results it's not foreign where are the Miracles I'll read again the prophet here it says here in the message if God be with us then where are all the Miracles paragraph 67. he says that how can you stand in the face of wind without having wind blowing sound sounds without being wet water is wet that's the chemical of it is and when you get in water you're going to get wet right and when you get in the presence of God the supernatural there is going to be a supernatural science and Supernatural workings of the supernatural God uh the supernatural signature and the supernatural workings of a supernatural God the the gesture that you had therefore he said where is the working where is the Miracles if God be with us Glory that's it where God is who with you miracles are where God is the sign of God is there amen where God is Miracles where God is the sign of God is there amen and we believe that we are in the presence of God this morning amen we believe that God is with us amen and the prophet here is saying that word God is Miracles where God is not just the truth the sign of God Amen so where why are we keep on complaining things amen where why are we keep on Amen complaining when things are not going their way we have the word we have the presence of God in the Old Testament amen God was with them amen but we have the promise that God is Not only with us but God is inside in other words that as the word became flesh taking water from the ocean amen God has no other um at work said at work at work at school amen what are your friends feeling because you Proclaim that you have crushes amen are you changing the atmosphere atmosphere amen are you changing the atmosphere when you go to school atmosphere um amen every word that Jesus was going yeah everywhere that Jesus he was changing the atmosphere atmosphere amen people were always shouting making noise amen Jesus was multiplying uh bread and everything amen and we have him inside of us what are people saying about us amen you see what brother Isaac I don't have faith I don't know how to believe why I see I'll read this word but I just don't know how to believe amen here's the answer of the Prophet for us the prophet he says that faith is not that loose I think it's got to be based upon some noted facts you've got to know something about what you are having faith in because the prophet says before having the Holy Spirit you need to know three things what is the holy spirit when it comes in you what does it mean and the other one I can't remember right now but if I have it I'll tell you uh amen he says that before you can have faith uh uh so we first must know how and what uh what God what God's desire is what God's plan is I regular shoes and how to approach God by that plane and then we can walk out boldly to the throne of grace and prayed what the plan is promised us if you apply that you will see the result amen you've got to know something amen you've got to know amen what your what what are the noted facts amen you will walk broadly to the throne of us so what is the Holy Ghost what is amen the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ himself Amen in different forms amen because in the beginning was the logos amen for God to create he had to condense himself into a foreign into different tongues of fire and different Amen in other words he divided himself into different pillar of fires amen which means that he went back to that original form foreign after the flesh went back to the pillow fire but he promised he will come again and dwell amongst and on the day of Pentecost that pill of fire come down separated itself in tongues of fire upon each one of them what was God doing amen prophecy that God was separating himself into the church amen giving all those men and women a part of himself he divided himself amongst the church just says he said he would call me amen the Holy Spirit none other than the part of the Lord when God became into a form to where it could be seen God you have a pillar foreign could not bear scene there had to be a blood offering right in here then that logos became flesh and dwelt Among Us and where this Lagos dwelt in the human body which was the sacrifice now when man was made in the image of God and God came down in the image of men to redeem man that brought men and God together human heavens and earth hugs and kisses God and Men Embrace each other as a fatherhood and sonship amen when the logos become flesh oh blood of God you know some amen so he promised that same power amen that same power is the same power that was in the prophet amen what did he do with that same quickening spouse he created amen he created animals amen he stopped the snow he gave life he gave life to that boy that had an accident his body amen his body were all over the place amen he spoke the word every part of their body started amen it was not other than that same Holy Spirit it was that same quickening person yeah but that was dwelling inside of it that made him do all them he wasn't his power amen but he was the holy spirit amen and that power that same spirit so remember did not stop in 1965 amen he did not die amen that this power amen This Promise amen is unto you amen and your children amen and as many as the Lord this means that the same Spirit secular amen you also you have a part of that Spirit you can claim the spirit amen and have the same parts and God will do Mighty works because it's that same Spirit basketball it shall also Quicken your mortal body yeah and it shall make you perfect amen he will make you perfect I mean he will change you from inside out let's become a new man you will become a new man a perfect man that spirit is Christ himself amen he's your leader leader amen that spirit is your confidence amen is your god amen amen is your tutor foreign foreign we don't rely on alone not because I've done because I spoke in tongue that means that I have the Holy Spirit no that's not the proof of you having the whole thing amen those are just things that will come with the word and the holy spirit amen by the holy spirit it's alive the holy spirit it's a person it's a person of Jesus Christ amen the only way to see that you have the holy spirit amen is to look at your life because you will be changed amen because you will be changed the Holy Spirit brings a change amen this dying Spirit yeah this is a dying spirit this is a dying spirit and a dying body the dentist but now you can't be in two bodies at the same time but they can be two Natures in one in you and one picture of who are doing our children now the nature of the spirit of the Lord when you're born again you're not born of a physical like the baby was but what happened but what happened the spiritual Birth has come to you [Music] and while this spiritual birth is growing into your heart amen there is a physical or a Celestial body growing to receive their Spirit yes and when that life leaves this body a concept oh it goes to that body amen just as when the body is presented to the Earth the spirit comes in let's plead and when the spirit goes out of that body regardless Spirit there is a body waiting for we know that after this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved is see that's it the spiritual body of the people let God spirituality amen we have a body that's waiting he's not waiting for that change when we'll be quick amen when but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead more dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in him perhapsody speaks amen it's the same spirit amen you notice that Paul didn't say that that spirit will dwell with you Paul didn't say Paul did not say that that spirit will dwell with you Paul napadike said that Spirit dwellers amen you have to have Christ walking inside amen you and God have to merge Allah becoming one body that's why I said because I live you shall live also how are you gonna leave foreign verse verse 1 to verse 4. how can I have that spirit Amen to have the same power that Jesus had meant to have the same spirit that Jesus said I mean how can I have it here the Bible says in Acts chapter 2 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place in chapter one uh chapter 2 verse 1. that's chapter two versions and suddenly there came a sound of Heaven from Heaven as a Russian Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting is and they appeared unto them cloven tongues like heads of Fire and he said upon each of them the long some lovely uh [Music] and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues and the spirit gave them utterance amen so when this the scripture continues and when they went out outside of that room continue speaking in tongues and people saw what the head was a genuine spirit is and they asked the question is but how can we have the same thing answered in the same chapter verse 38. let's let's start from verse 37. Transit Bible says that now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do verses then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy ghosts [Music] for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as even as many as the Lord Our God shall come on foreign now verse 41 it says that then they that gladly received his word were baptized at the same day they were added unto them about 3 000 Souls [Music] um Peterson and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and you see what brought Isaac I've been baptized 14 years ago but but how can I still have that Spirit come out please continue to speak amen remember Paul didn't say that you will have the Holy Spirit When You Believe amen for some people it's a process because what God likes God likes a heart that's sincere but secretary amen because he's a God who knows everything amen he knows he sees you when you sin even when you think so there is no point of lying to us and be determined amen be determined amen and then you will see it yeah it might be determined you say that Lord if you don't give me the Holy Spirit right now you will find my bones when you're coming the prophet said that if you need the Holy Spirit and when you go to the Altar and you stop praying and don't leave the altar until you release amen and he's the one who gives it to him foreign [Applause] foreign and baptize everyone [Music] [Music] good morning [Music] we worry [Music] they were always [Music] oh Lord [Music] everyone [Music] despise [Music] all day [Music] [Music] just [Music] about just everyone [Music] there's this things this is [Music] oh [Music] my God [Music] before before we pray I want to read the last chord here it's funny if God be with us where are all the Miracles if God be with us where are all the Miracles paragraph 32. the prophecies that the devil can't sell the food on you to hurt you set the food on you to hurt you the job on the paper uh until you first get away from God you must first remember that check when anything happens see if you are in the face see that if you are right up to to a place with God then remember Allah the devil can't do you no harm because you are in Christ amen it's something to keep in mind every time we go through our times [Music] if you're not foreign [Music] Lord you spoke to us this morning Lord we pray father God that you help us Lord to put in practice so father God whatever you told us Lord we need your spirit inside of us please [Music] but we pray father God that you forgive all our sins and you forgive all our wrongdoings so we pray O Father God that every time our Father God of Our Lives a constant reminder [Music] we pray father God and you help us to have a great weekend Lord let us go home and think about the words that will bring your angels down thank you for everything [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] nothing but a blood [Music] what can wash away myself again [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music] for precious more operations [Music] [Music] [Music] oh Jesus [Music] pressure Earth it is [Music] [Music] [Music] this is all my righteousness [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh my prayers for this I bring nothing body [Music] [Music] [Music] for pressure [Music] [Music] of Jesus even a brother Valerie it's got something to say about the instrument if you can come forward
