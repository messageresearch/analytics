Pastor maved Monday the pressure a massage the pack at Des Moines as Pastor asked me as himself is preaching about Easter in Des Moines in my way we see the mountains he also asked me to do this if I

the work that she's doing in this church it's a great job it's not the least one yeah and I would also like to ask parents to send their children time okay so that our kids can also benefit from this uh on this guidance is a lot of foreign to send the kids sometime you heard it last Sunday I believe you heard a message if we can bring our children on time it means we have to be early so that our children can be early to a church that's what I wanted to say uh are also uh what I think this occasion to say that next Sunday the next two coming Sundays I'm not gonna be in Iowa uh yeah uh pastors there's Pastor Gideon coming from Congo who's also my pastor is Arizona I would like to be with him because he's going to preach in Kentucky and also in Arizona Jaden I'll be in Des Moines so that they can dedicate a challenge to God Allah if Pastor wanna do it in Iowa City or up there talk to him don't over consecrated so it will depend where Pastor will be if passes in Iowa City we will be in our city if he's in Des Moines I'll be in the morning survived a time playing terrific and that would be an interruption from the the same other way we are preaching uh and We're Not Gonna Leave This teaching short we're gonna continue with it no matter what kind of interruption or cure that we're gonna carry on with it we'll see foreign and I also hope that I'm also a subjecting to your prayers may the Lord bless you but none is now we shall stand upon our feet is 28 is m Matthew Mayfield chapter 28 from verse 1 up to 10. after reading our pray then you will sit down and also read into other quotations foreign [Music] now after the Sabbath as the first day of the week began to drown Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb he was and behold there was a great earthquake for an angel of the Lord descendant from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat on it is in the Book of Mark those women were wondering who's gonna roll back the stone for them you see the angel of the Lord came down and rolled back the storms [Music] his continence was like lightning and his clothing was his white snow Le Garden more [Music] and the god shook for fear and him of him and became like dead man but the angel answered and said to the woman do not do not be afraid for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified um foreign he is not here for his reason as he said come and see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and indeed he is going before you into Galilee for you will you will see him discipline so they went they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and run to bring his disciples words and as they went to tell his disciples behold Jesus met them saying Rejoice so they came and held held him by by the field by defeat and worship him then Jesus said to them do not be afraid go enter my burden to go to Galilee and there and there they will see me [Music] Victory on scene foreign [Music] I wanna read again uh Revelation chapter one verse one no 10 to 17. 17 to 18. Revelation chapter one more foreign foreign but he laid his his right hand on me saying to me do not be afraid I am the first and the last foreign amen in the Book of Romans chapter 8 verse 11. but if the spirit of him of him who raised Jesus from Day from the dead dwells in you he who raised cross from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you okay may the Lord bless the reading of Israel this is a Christian Amen in the name of the Lord Jesus like I said this morning when I speak about the view uh the quickening power is preaching every time it was he could change the subject of his preachers but the content was was the quickening power it prevented title it like uh the rising of the sun he could entitle the the the Easter sale Resurrection or the proof of his resurrection all of that is because you wanted to speak about it quickly so we know this Easter is the most eventful or for Christians Pasco Parker Resurrection because Easter is the resurrection amen amen I don't think you're taking a position to sleep because if you're now taking position to sleep that's not good huh is I can see people taking a position to sleep so don't do that please so Easter is the most important event for uh for Christians because Easter is the resurrection Resurrection said Resurrection means restoration when our Lord Jesus Christ was raised from Death he proved that everything that the scriptures were talking about him was true and we know that the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ brought to us the victory that have never been Sunset Resurrection because without this Resurrection without this victory foreign that's why the Lord said I got the power to give my life and get it back so if the Lord just died and didn't rest again we are going to still be we are going to be still potentially because the sense of the whole whole but they were dead and the devil had a kiss Elementary and put him inside that's why is why the Lord has to raise up the Lord is Rich he proved by more about him they were true that's what David said by is the spirit of God I will never let my holy to get corrupted [Music] should happen to him but David was talking about Christ but that could not let the body of Jesus Christ without that Victory without that Resurrection we're going to be still died like a man and raise up again like God that's what that's what makes this that's the only true religion in the world because it's the one that the founder is not in the grave this is trying to find my my uh my base thank you so Christian religion is my feet I want the tomb to be really excited that Christ shouldn't be making it should be the original in each and everywhere that's what we're talking about this morning [Music] when he was dying on the cross ES he ruled it forever this animal we're calling Satan we Satan certain animal because Saturn is the prophet of God is when Jesus is a great animal has been broken the rape of the devil has been broken today the kidney kidney oh the kidney the devil kidney has been um he has been wounded forever and his back has been uh foreign foreign [Music] we may be in a position that Christ is living in us this morning I want to go bit by bit that's why the Lord could say I got the power to give my life and take it back the prophet the judge is the prophet of God is saying in the restitution of the uh bride Bright Tree he said now it's Easter Sunday preaching 1962. recedition of a Bright Tree I'm saying it for Israel to protect it but now it's Easter Park I love Easter we met India concerning this little rabbit concerning this herd and all this or the rope and all of that is [Music] like in the shop I've seen people buying flowers all right people gonna eat a rabbit they're gonna eat the dark foreign because Easter is is spring and the Earth was coming from the uh from the cold processes it's in the process of going into its normal process and God is busy restoring the Earth while it was struck by the uh by the court of winter Jack fell foreign please don't take that position position s take long three hours I can do also like that give a compression are you sure what a permission with your permission I'm gonna push for three hours okay second position so those who want to take positions go sleep for three hours just take your position I've got the uh allowance to preach for three hours Jim the prophet of God said the Earth went a distance that's why they call structure and everything is because gold is the type of death and when we start coming out it means the Earth is getting close it's coming back close to the Sun and that's restoration God is busy restoring the Earth if you are at a right time at the right place God gonna restore you basketball because Easter is [Music] we need to be restored we need to be restored because that's because it's Easter [Music] and the law of God according to the nation brings back this Earth to be to be uh to be restored is to restore what the winter is destroyed while the sun was far away from the Earth but now that the sun is gaining back its position according to the Earth there's Now Easter restoration flowers are blooming again everything is as you can see it outside the flowers everything that the winter kill the sun is restoring it Tuesday everything that winter killed foreign [Music] [Music] power of God I want to be more clear he has to be before the Lord I know start living in us he has to be God With Us amen amen says of the son of righteousness remember it was said the

and the life it does that uh believe in me even when they die they shall still live for under Resurrection in the life all right now we have Margaret she's going to give us like a summary of John chapter 18 questions so uh late um like at Doc on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene like came to this tall the tomb and saw that the stone was like removed so she came to the to Simon and Peter and said that the Tom has been removed and so Simon and Peter went there but Simon got there first and didn't go in but he saw the Lin um lying there and then uh Peter went there Peter got there and then um then he went inside and saw the limb pieces of cloth um then um Mary like was there crying um as she left she looked inside and then she saw two angels one at the foot and one at the head and so uh the Angels asked her why are you crying um and then she said that because um they have taken my Lord away and I don't know where they put him and so at that point she turned around and she saw Jesus but she thought it was the gardener so uh Jesus said that woman who are you looking for and she said um I am looking for my reward and then Jesus said Mary and Mary uh Cried Out Rabbi which means teacher and I'll I'll block and then uh and then Jesus said that do not come to me yet because I have not ascended to my father so go tell my brothers um that I I am ascending to my Father which is your father and my God which is your god and so she went um she went to tell the disciples and she went with the news and she said that I have saw him and told them everything that he has said I was literally crying like I told her you're gonna tell the parents what happened to the day of resurrection and she literally told you guys everything that happened so if you guys don't know she just
