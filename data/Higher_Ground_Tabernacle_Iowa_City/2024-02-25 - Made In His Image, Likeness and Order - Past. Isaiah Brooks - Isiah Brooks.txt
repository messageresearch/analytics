[Applause] Earth Jesus is that God Jesus Is God Hallelujah Jesus Jesus amen hallelujah as we stand come in honor the word we we started this message in De Mo and we are working on a series and as God open the word to us we begin to we will impart it to the church first of all I want to give honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen to the church of the Living God our precious brother is my wife couldn't make it today having a little knee trouble but uh it was in her heart to come and I told her no sheay at home and go to the church but anyhow we want to give honor to all the God and the reason why I'm doing it is because of you that I am here if you weren't here would have a Ministry uh you know if God didn't see us here brother would not have had a Min we we are people I am a man of God I am a man of God that fear God and uh so I I go by the inspiration of you know when when when when I preach something by the grace of God I have already gotten a witness from God to preach it I don't randomly preach things I am led by his spirit so as we stand let us turn to Ephesians 5 this is the scripture that brother vam used marriage and divorce hallelujah hallelujah and uh um we we want to thank God for what What the Lord Has Done um with the scripture because we know the the scripture is manifold as God unveils it it unfolds itself but that let's read it wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore sorry therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives am even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he excuse me that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to have their own WI as excuse me so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself Genesis 20 I'm sorry let's go to [Music] Colossians Colossians 1 15 [Music] 18 everybody's there good morning who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be throne or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for [Music] him and he is before all things and by him all things consists he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all all things he might have preeminence let us pray dear heavenly father we come before you Lord Jesus humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace the only I ask oh God that you not only give us a heart but a heart to believe the word and a heart to receive the word bless your people this morning they look Beyond The Vessel hear the voice that comes from the which is your voice Lord in Jesus amen you [Music] may just a week or so ago we were just thinking and I I think about death and life all the time because I know that I am approaching an a that if God should cut my life short if by the time I reach the age 70 if he should cut it there and I lived the life that's been allotted to me alloted given to me so I thank God for these 68 years and you know it's amazing that in in our brother John's prayer talking about enjoying life and and we know if it's the enemy job to make us miserable if possible in this life but in being a Christian we supposed to enjoy life every aspect of it whether it's good or bad sunshine should always be Sunshine the Sun never stops shining it shines in the winter shines in the summer it shines in the spring and it shines in the fall nothing can stop the Sun not even the clouds helloo because Sun always penetrate the light penetrates through the [Applause] cloud and that's how it is with the no matter what we go through that is supposed to penetrate situation so I was thinking about Egypt and how when the death angel came they were given instructions put the blood on the doorpost and the L they were willing to do that portion of the scripture they were willing to be justified but God had another portion of their Journey that they were to fulfill and that next portion would deal with sanctification and we found out that in sanctification only two made it died off about what I'm saying they all started out saying hallelujah but somewhere down the line they lost their salvation just listen it didn't stop there they had to come to a death a Jordan and they had to die to everything uh uh uh uh that they experienced in EG as well as the Wilderness matterif fact God told the children Israel I put you in the wilderness you to see what was in your heart Hallelujah so when we go through trial not God who is on trial you that's on trial and the test come to see what you are made of Hallelujah amen now the death angel didn't get them in Egypt but it took on another form and we know this form by by names hallelujah hallelujah and David and was instruments of the death angel Hallelujah because they interpreted that Moses said to their own means Hallelujah and they were jealous of the ministry said they said to Moses do you think you the only holy man we are all holy Hallelujah and they had followers am amen amen I want to preach anyway even though I hear some of your thoughts listen be careful be careful you're carrying something that you shouldn't have brought but let me move on let me move on and and and and and just think about it God was taking them to the spirit of adoption hallelujah hallelujah and only a few caught the Revelation Hallelujah Moses couldn't bring them to adoption it took Joshua away was a shadow a type of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah is that right I mean you had a uh you know who who who allowed himself to be seduced by that same spirit that same devil Hallelujah that U the other millions in the wilderness let me say it like this God sees he knows every move we make he knows our thoughts the Bible said of off Hallelujah is that right Moses was the angel of life and life Hallelujah yes sir Joshua who who was a whole type of the Holy Spirit he became the angel of life and life Hallelujah but it still did not stop yall better hear what I'm saying see the death angel doesn't attack those who are dead Hallelujah the death angel attacks those who have life hallelujah hallelujah y understand what I'm saying so if you got Li you got to be careful because the death angel still is around Hallelujah yes sir I'm explain myself hallelujah hallelujah so here it was Joshua he was also the angel who led them to the promise Joshua and Caleb was the only two who had the right question is what is your spirit concerning this message hallelujah hallelujah where is my Mountain understand this is what K said I want my Mountain my in other words I'm seeking full adoption I my Hallelujah he wasn't mindful of the things in Egypt and let me say it like this God can bless you naturally Hallelujah giv you all kinds of things Hallelujah let me put it at this term the Bible say their shoes never wore out Hallelujah but in this day my shoes never wear out because when they get old I get another p it's God who blesses me with the other you know we are in such a rich age can we forget what God is doing am I'm talking about likeness order image brother B use those terms all the time we've been made in the image and Light Hallelujah and the bride is to be in the image of Christ of his bone and flesh of his flesh Hallelujah you understand me if you know what a peon tree looks like a peon tree a peach tree the the PES yeah if you the difference between a peach tree and apple tree never get confused Hallelujah every seed proves what it is am you can say whatever you want to I remember when I was was a boy looking at a a cartoon there was a cat that was black and white a male cat I'm and then there was a sorry let me back it up there was a cat that was a black cat the black cat crawled under he he he he crawled under a fence did that had just been painted and this cat saw a skunk I I GRE uh um a skunk no it's an animal it's a it's a stinking animal I don't know what y'all call him but you don't want to get in contact with a Hallelujah to show you what a they uses the oils and they put them put it in in perfumes to give it that strength you understand so anyway this cat fell in love with the scum until the paint was washed away no matter how he was painted the outside he was still and a scum was still a scum see disguises go a long way let me put it the way the Bible say favor how say let me read it let me read you love the Lord am I've been quoting that scripture forever and here I am can't remember what I it says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain y'all believe that let me tell you like this it's like a preacher he can preach 100% but let him make one mistake and the had everything good let's say for you that that's the way I I see these things preachers who have done things the kingdom of God and they mess up one time and these people who call themselves Christian wipe them out let me tell you something if you don't know a yet there ain't one preacher there's not one preacher Perfect Like [Music] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah and the truth of the man is we have a poor way of judging each other in reality we should be doing the word judges not me it's the word that let me say it like this Marilyn Monroe Monroe they say she was beautiful and she was in her day she can't touch the women nowadays but after died nobody was at the funeral home trying to take her body you understand what I'm saying all that beauty and when she died her beauty died with her somebody help me see what I'm trying to say it can never be the out with appearance Hallelujah you can appear like we but if that hasn't been changed it's going to reveal itself Hallelujah I won't have to do a thing about it because the nature is going to show up in some season Hallelujah Hall love the Lord let me read what brother say love God in God's power to transform now I'm dealing with order I'm dealing with and I'm dealing with life you know what God His Image and his life because we're living in an age of perion everything is perverted except the word of God no perversion will enter the kingdom yeah oh you I've been more raised in the message unless you really got the Holy Ghost the message is not a thing it's a person you may have grown up around the message your family your daddy your mama might be in the message but you never be in the message until you receive the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the message amen hallelujah hallu I'm so glad to know that what I possess is genuine there are some of us who know that Hallelujah coming from the message Hallelujah God's power to transform I didn't come to make you shout this morning matter I never come to do that I have to give you the word whatever God want me to say hallelujah hallu coming from that message paragraph 63 listen to the way the prophet describes God on the day of creation he said where that seventh moment morning when God looked upon it all he said it's good I am pleased with it I am glad I did it and it's all now under control and I have put trust in my son wife that they will make them head of all of it Hallelujah that they will watch over it all and see that it's all right that everything will bring forth of this kind now he was has now he has that power to do that God then said well if if it's all so good and it can't be anything else because it's my it's it's my own desire it's the way I want it and I have spoken it that way and my words have brought it just exactly the way I wanted it and there it is it's all good so the Bible say God rested the seventh days from all his works and everything under control to of its kind Hallelujah now remember to bring when it put forth the seed in the earth listen the seed can only come fought with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to or whever it is his transforming power now God put the seed in there with potentials that it will be what he said it would be the SE with potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long as it stayed in it right category it will be just exactly what God said it would be Hallelujah it had to be that way because he had made it that way and made a channel that anything that stays in his channel in his word for exactly like the word said it will do because if you say you Bri see must bring forth Hallelujah not some kind of tradition not a the seed for Hallelujah Hall is that right it CH it's it's channeled just exactly right so with everything in the trust so with everything in the trust in his own son that it would be that way then God said it is good so I'll just rest each one of those seeds has power in itself transform itself into the species that I desire it to be me there's no excuse if the seed is in there oh it needs to be is quicker in order to transform you you don't transform it transform you it changes you from glory to Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah that's exactly right exactly hallelujah hallelujah is able to transform you into another listen the nature you and I were born in did did not make us sinners we were Sinners we couldn't help but be Sinners because of the seed that was in us we came here as liars and th adter us that's what we were but there was another SE Hallelujah there was a seed that God from the foundation of the world but that seed cannot live until you kill the original you that first seed has to die the product of that seed must now some of you may not understand this is why it was a tree of life one one life in that tree and that was the Life of Christ is that right but there was another tree and it was two lives two Natures good and evil hallelujah hallelujah and that's why Jesus said make the tree good or make it evil this is not the day of Good and Evil not for the bride cuz she has a perfect word that would bring us into a perfect state of EV Hallelujah this is why God delivered to us in a message that brother prach the statue of a perfect man that was the divine nature of God that that was in the seed hallelujah oh I got to have patience in the seed I got to have long suffering se but we must die and Ro to our will you got to understand even as a man Jesus did not want to go to calary amen amen that's true but the god in him spoke up and said not my will you hear what I'm saying and he suffered that so much so he looking for people that's going to really not only hear his word but believe his word that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in his potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be and that word exact another word for Perfection exact means spot on hallelujah hallelujah not almost but it means exactly what it say hallelujah so what are you looking at a message brother I didn't come to call build another organization denomination this message is for the Bride of Jesus Christ and he said she will never denominate she never become Hallelujah why because she has a seed in her and this seed is not of a denomination it's not organization this seed is the word of God and this seed will bring you into His Image this SE will bring you into his likeness SE will bring you into hallelujah hallelujah you see because even in Jesus day it was the tradition of men that caused the word of God to be n effect how much you can say how many testimonies you got for what you believe right and if it's not producing Christ there's a little leaving somewhere something needs to be sought out you love the Lord let me move on Genesis 20 68 a you see why God didn't say hey let's just be a church but he even set the church in order there's a fivefold Ministry and that fivefold Ministry has a word [Music] word hallelujah hallelujah and as long as they follow that word that will be produced in but the moment they turn to Creed [Music] andg Hallelujah I am ambitious and I am ambitious because I I I got to make this translation and my ambition is to see the virtues of Christ must go through that seed in me compels me to move forward not to stay still and I see Jesus Hallelujah maybe not in your flesh but see in my flesh and your desire should be see Jesus your is that right because the Bible say men say that Jesus has not come in the flesh he an antichrist Hallelujah yes sir he not only came Andra in your you can't be a messiah without Christ in there Genesis 20 68 I know we've got so many people still playing church and the Death Angel the damn thing you're still here what happens when you try saw and there is no results because somewhere you sold your birth right nobody in here like that Hallelujah but you must understand was a church going to did God bless he's blessed now you see the Arabs and all that's from they got more money than we do Hallelujah but Salvation I wouldn't trade billions of dollars give me of Hallelujah but I'll take Jesus y understand me you can have this whole world Jesus this is what what I can't quite seem to grasp and maybe out of my mind but when I see this world falling aart just like brother said and my ambition is still in this world that's right it's all right to have nice things but you better put Jesus [Applause] first Hallelujah listen it didn't say get all the things in the world first God would then give you the Holy Ghost he said get the Holy Ghost first and then God will give you everything hallelujah hallelujah six verse and God said unto him in a dream y I know that th this this in the in of thy heart for I also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffer I did not to touch her now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee thou sh live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shall surely die thou and all that are thine therefore aimc Rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were so afraid I just want to bring one point out of this this is this is a a a subject in itself but understand the devil is in prison he's in lock down he can't keep you y understand whatever Satan has on you God has already given you Deliverance you got an order to go free it doesn't matter how great this demon is a king so do not dealing with the little demons you dealing with a big demon Hallelujah and it doesn't matter how big the demon is he cannot keep you why because you belong to God oh my God now this this excites me because when I see people uh you know they you know you let the devil take your joy let me say it like this we go through our down period winter we go through our Winters we go through our Su however but one thing he he shared with us tree look dead though a tree dead in the winter is still alive in the roots Hallelujah so if you going through a winter time the dev is tell you that you're dead you don't see no fruits Hallelujah there's no praise in your life don't leave Hallelujah remember he said I'll never leave you you going through a hard time know that the life is still in the soul Hallelujah you cannot touch the all and the [Applause] wine I'm coming I haven't even got to where I want to go but the theme of the message is to restore the bride of Christ Hallelujah is that all right but you can't you can't be restored without obedience [Applause] God gives us a word and you know we we think uh we can do what we want to do I'm not a controlling person believe my brother [Music] is but there is obeying some [Music] rules let's turn to Hebrews 13 17-8 and then we're going to carry [Music] on thank you for your prayers y'all understand me that's I had a conversation with a young man not long I just love brother I love brother you never seen neither have you met him but if you want to love him go ahead but how can you love him and you love your brothers is that right Jesus said you can't love me You' never seen me but how is it that you love me your brother all the amen why do we do that we say we you know oh I love you that cuz most of the time when people say I love you go love they talk about is that friendship love but we supposed to be speaking The Godly love I love Hallelujah now what I love you mean in God is that I'm love covers a multitude of sin love covers a multitude of H that's God's love God's love is not pued up God's love does not seek his own God's love is not revengeful hallelujah hallelujah God's love is not ey for on no no no no no you see what I'm saying God's love doesn't get jealous those things are not in the image of God and if you possessing these things things must [Music] die did y'all know that don't you know no gossiper oh it's just a small sin but it's a little [Music] foxes it doesn't Express Jesus Christ W be God don't care nothing about your pride hear me Genesis 1 26-27 I'm going to get into something now we had a long song service I try not to be too long here this morning but I want to get the very thought of of this portion uh this morning right be in His image you know when it comes to his likeness you can't be like in his likeness without the Holy Spirit we are all naturally in His image with man and woman Hallelujah y hear what I'm saying so I'm coming to something God said let us make a man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish over the sea and over the of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creep upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created male and female created he them so we know that male and female we should never be confused with that nowed world Hallelujah right so we got to understand always will be male and female Hallelujah you cannot be in the image of a lesbian Heaven any kind of a homosexual don't get me wrong you have a problem this may be a king ABC is already given you [Music] release it must die amen yes sir amen hallelujah or you can say somebody took advantage of me and I was raped or molested and all these things happen to me Hallelujah you missing the point did not God for you did not he share his blood for you was he not be with stripes for you Hallelujah they nailed his hands Hallelujah from here to there healing he in his feet all the way up just go healing whatever you got working badly on the inside sword Pier side word healing I got a migraine headache I got brain tumor whatever put a crown of thorns on his head heal Hallelujah blood saturated every part of his body on your healing and God just didn't stop on the outside he took the sword and he pled it on the inside in this message will transform you if you allow it to Hallelujah you can't hang with your old bodies if they're not ready to change that's right you got to separate yourself from all unbel Hallelujah Darkness can't comprehend life life can't comprehend Darkness oh my y'all hear what I'm saying because the devil say well you know I got this yes every one of us got something that we deal with but it must die right rock you got and you know what the hard part is giving it up people think they in this message oh I'm justif you still do wicked stuff you are deceived we willfully doing I ain't talking mistakes I'm talking willfully sinning disbelieving you deceive but I don't care what mess you in or what mess the devil is put you in there's a seed on the inside the problem is we believe the word but believe it won't do you no good beli the prophecy Jacob believed the prophecy but he still had the wrestle with the angel in order for that prophecy to come to pass Hallelujah you got to humble yourself get down on your knees and pray and SE God's face and turn

the point I can't stand you no more I'm not instructing your sister I'm just telling yall what they would do back in the day the police wouldn't even lock them up for you understand me I haven't heard of an incident like that a long time but it was real you understand me the Church of the Living God never have to come to a place hallelujah our nature is from above can I please our nature is from above L coming from the message of the Bride our natural life here we have is just a perversion so every one of us were born perversed it really should be the right way life to begin but it is perverted the natural birth the first life of your first Union you were joined in at by at Birth a natural Act natur human being ass man and woman together Associated together seair which brought your first life here and that's associated with sin and death how can you miss the serpent SE that which happened in the garden real Hallelujah but let me go on in Isaiah 9 Isaiah 96 says For unto us a child is born us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder Hallelujah and his name Shall be Called wonderful the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace what is it said that government on his shoulder was his strength amen hallelujah let me ask you a question who is the head of the church chch it's Jesus Christ he is the head of the church hallelujah hallelujah

judgment almost done amen amen with this cuz I can't go any further let me show you how you get the Holy Ghost you don't have it but you got to have a sincere heart first of all you got you got to get on your knees wherever you are and you must judge yourself amen amen even the thief on the cross this man is not worthy we're worthy of death Hallelujah and then he turned to the Lord said when you enter into your kingdom you got to judge yourself you got to sincerely mean it TR mean it God will then judge you and then when God judges you that you have been pure in your heart you confess all that you know how to conf you haveed yourself out you become nothing before God then God will send down the Holy Ghost and consume the sacrifice you said brother books I'm closing [Music] look look at the image now cling your your image and likeness must beess of God it cannot be in the image and likeness of the first Adam it must be in the image of the second this is what separated brother r prach the Lord built tested him soul that his character had become so much like God to God asking can I walk with you hear what I'm saying see when God asked you can I walk with him you're no longer unyoked unequal you have become Yol with him hallelujah oh somebody help me and that's our ambition this is what the word comes to do it comes to change us Ain none of us has we got no right somebody in hell or call somebody a serpent Hallelujah is that right but we have a right to the Tree of Life Hallelujah when you get the love of God in your heart you can still kiss Judas even though you know he's a devil [Music] we got get natural [Music] attitude every bad attitude of send you to H quick you don't realize what you're doing because thinking you believeing right only way to fa in God is to believe God's word God don't care about your feeling dead you can't respond you're dead and somebody say he was nothing but a dog that that dead man can't jump up and say how you going to call me a see he was could not have heard those words you call hypocrite Jesus is so dead with him open his mouth he didn't fight back like that and I'm saying a lot of things because all of us need to understand we are all being judged right now by God himself is that the truth and understand by God's nothing nothing nothing you can hide from all in closing brother R said he saw the preview of the church and he saw the preview of the bride and the preview of the bride and the preview of the church totally totally different the preview of the Bride marching to the word she was dressed right no got of Step hear me but when she saw that prostit all those other churches and America was the worst of all what was it that made them look naked they [Music] ref [Applause] [Music] I'm not here to make anybody feel bad but if we're going to grow we got to understand the things that we're doing wrong a child would do things wrong sometimes and not know it pop the hand they get fascinated that things easily like a hot stove and you tell them don't touch the stone but they're now fascinated the best thing you you can do is move that child out of the presence of the St because if you don't that child is going to touch that Stope they will learn but they learn the hard way sometimes that was that's what we do and the preacher here to try to get you in a place where you won't learn let us pray Heavenly god father of all things we thank you for all things we pray father God that the word has been a blessing strength to people I know it was a different kind of a message L to preach in this way living in the last days we need change and only you can change but it must be our will to be changed our desire to be changed Lord God let that seed that's in US fall into the right channel
