[0:11] that is my father who lived in heaven if
[0:13] you set up here and upon
[0:20] [Music]
[0:39] the church is not based upon the person
[0:41] of peter
[0:44] upon the person of jesus himself
[0:48] by the church
[0:50] upon the revelation
[0:52] of who is jesus
[0:55] that's where the church is built
[1:27] [Music]
[1:49] we're living in an age where the
[1:51] manifestation of the world should come
[1:52] in another age not of or that of uh
[1:56] and it's true
[1:59] i am a person without
[2:02] knowledge
[2:04] [Music]
[2:06] but you can never go beyond the nation
[2:08] basket everyday
[2:10] because god is working into the
[2:12] continuity
[2:15] through the nature it is a sister
[2:17] commerciality he said it's just like the
[2:19] way it is
[2:49] father who is the master of revelation
[2:54] and the second mystery is the revelation
[2:56] itself
[3:00] which is the rock on which the church
[3:01] has to be buried
[3:13] that was given to a man which means
[3:15] peter who represented a church hello
[3:21] [Music]
[3:40] god has revealed himself to the children
[3:58] predestination
[4:04] when cain and ever came out to worship
[4:09] it was about revelation
[4:11] revelations
[4:55] he said i want god to accept my offering
[4:58] a laminated free disciple and he brought
[5:01] all the fruit of his reference
[5:04] and whenever came to worship
[5:13] [Music]
[6:04] then
[6:24] and all of that speaks about jesus
[6:30] over islam
[6:32] god
[7:29] but god has slaughtered his lamb in his
[7:32] mind before the foundation of the world
[7:33] so being positioned just being well
[7:36] placed about it
[7:41] before the foundation of the
[7:55] the lord
[7:56] jesus your devout yellow patient that
[7:59] lame has to attack the sin in the type
[8:05] but now let us analyze this celebrity
[8:08] it means that
[8:10] i don't ever participation before adam
[8:13] and eve sin
[8:17] god has already provided a lamb for
[8:20] their sins
[8:22] why did he provide us salvation
[8:43] there were many attributes in him the
[8:45] attribute you suffered the attribute of
[8:48] the sentence
[8:49] the attribute of a healing
[8:52] attribute
[9:06] that's
[9:20] god has worked so hard
[9:22] to say had i ever appreciated to bring
[9:24] adam and eve to fall
[9:26] is that the core are you i are you with
[9:29] me
[9:30] do you agree with me
[9:32] i die heaven have a purpose yeah if adam
[9:34] and eve never
[9:45] so that god can manifest that attribute
[9:47] you suffer the attribute
[10:18] that's not my subject this morning is a
[10:19] very respectable timing oh i have to
[10:22] check my time respect it
[10:26] every day is not sunday as they say
[10:30] shaggy
[11:14] for us to start reproducing us
[11:16] to reproduce ourselves the way we're
[11:18] doing it
[11:23] there's nothing
[11:24] nothing that has changed
[12:11] [Music]
[12:50] had to come upon the steps of gordon
[12:53] from heaven
[12:58] that he has to come down
[12:59] directly
[13:04] introduce himself before the high priest
[13:07] uh kept us in that time
[13:09] mechanic
[13:10] but when when the messiah came in
[13:15] that was so different from what they
[13:17] were thinking
[13:18] ain't not powerfully accepted and they
[13:20] never accept him
[13:23] consciously
[13:24] what jesus could say
[13:28] me and my father we won
[13:31] they took some stone they want to
[13:47] [Music]
[14:30] a different
[14:31] uh conception the way division among
[14:34] people and different understanding
[14:37] hello
[15:07] i said unto you and you don't believe it
[15:10] it's written
[15:32] you don't believe it because you are not
[15:34] one uh some of my my my ships
[15:37] and my voice
[15:39] my ship heard my voice and follow me
[15:42] eternal i give them eternal life
[15:45] [Music]
[15:46] and they'll never be lost
[15:50] and nobody shall take them from me
[15:54] [Music]
[16:30] [Music]
[16:34] but they understood that when he said he
[16:36] meant it
[16:38] memory
[16:39] it means that jesus was the father
[16:42] himself
[16:45] that was too much for them to believe
[16:46] it's only a long success
[17:29] foreign
[17:43] [Music]
[18:18] [Music]
[18:25] if i don't do my father's work
[18:29] then don't believe me message you
[18:31] but if i i'm happy
[18:35] just believe in the works that i'm doing
[18:43] so that you may recognize that the god
[18:45] the father is in me and i'm in the
[18:46] father
[18:48] then they got married
[18:51] [Music]
[18:54] and they wanted to hold him mainly
[18:57] but jesus escaped from their hands
[19:00] amen
[19:02] jesus said
[19:04] jesus escaped himself from their hands
[19:06] have you been lucky
[19:08] he knew what was going to happen
[19:15] if jesus have escaped are you going to
[19:18] stay there
[19:20] you gotta know
[19:22] hello
[19:27] [Music]
[19:37] stop me
[19:39] that's what abraham said
[19:45] jesus wasn't the second person of the
[19:47] deity
[19:48] no my affair no my brother
[20:15] god existed before the body of jesus
[20:18] christ was born
[20:20] meccano
[20:24] but when our god wanted to take a flesh
[20:26] a human flesh
[20:28] conditions he took the body of jesus
[20:30] christ
[20:31] forever
[20:59] [Music]
[21:14] he came
[21:41] you understand what you want
[21:56] [Music]
[22:12] he was a jewish no no
[22:14] [Music]
[22:16] jesus was not a jewish blood
[22:23] and he wasn't either the the the blood
[22:27] uh which is not jewish
[22:29] gentile's blood
[22:31] [Music]
[22:33] he was god's blood
[22:35] he didn't have a knee jesus he was
[22:38] neither jewish
[22:41] nor gentiles he imitates you he was god
[22:44] in a fierce concept a virgin shall
[22:47] conceive
[22:49] but now listen to what he said
[22:51] but now
[23:20] is
[23:47] the the egg that the chicken had given
[23:49] shall never ash a baby
[23:53] perfection because that
[23:55] that egg that egg wasn't uh
[23:59] uh
[24:00] fertile
[24:03] you son
[24:04] the life comes from blood luckily sex is
[24:06] a masculine which comes from a masculine
[24:09] testament
[24:10] secretary but in this car in this uh in
[24:13] this case of jesus
[24:15] sex masculine there wasn't a masculine
[24:19] sex over here do you see laughing down
[24:21] the sun life in the blood sacrifice
[24:24] developing digestion that life has to
[24:28] come from god himself
[25:16] is saying jesus wasn't either or neither
[25:19] uh jewish blood nor gentile's blood he
[25:21] could test a simple question
[25:23] why uh listen to this
[25:43] if you never understood that yes you
[25:44] confronted all your shows you're going
[25:46] to confuse things
[25:54] god
[27:09] when you want to manifest himself in the
[27:11] flesh
[27:13] and the human name of jesus
[27:16] is jesus christ
[27:18] that's
[27:25] he took the name of jesus
[27:28] amen
[27:30] that's the message
[27:32] and brother

[28:23] [Music]
[29:10] when you never believe to that
[29:13] that's what i'm saying
[29:17] if there's somebody today
[29:22] who exalted the lord jesus christ
[29:37] more than any other evangelist
[29:44] you will never see progress
[29:46] [Music]
[29:48] unless you believe in that
[29:51] that's what peter said
[30:07] then you'll be ready to get into spirit
[30:10] convocable
[30:13] if you want your sin to be atoned
[30:17] be baptized in the name of the lord
[30:18] jesus christ
[30:34] [Music]
