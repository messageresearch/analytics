but he still did not have the interpretation the the the congregation together in march 17 and it lasted for eight days [Music] mysterious feeling nothing compassionate there's a stranger it was [Music] what was happening in those eight days [Music] is hallelujah otherwise hallelujah [Music] right amen understand what i'm trying to say [Music] [Music] that he was placed in there [Music] oh [Music] to come back here to reveal it to the church remember i said the next thing that happened we will be here at the church is that the truth so here was william brown fought up into the constellation of seven eight amen hallelujah in the second fold hello hallelujah hallelujah the second fold of it like this what's in that little room y'all hear me because when he was called out the first time this is your life they didn't tell nothing because okay was the time of the coming of the lord in this very mystery of god oh from that king sure give it to him [Music] that's why john fell down to worship [Music] [Music] [Music] it was eternity hallelujah did not go to the it was jesus christ [Music] uh [Music] yes his whole bible jesus christ thou must prophesy again [Music] amen we have come to fight [Music] another thing i want you to notice what's taking place and you're listening to the tape but what time is it sir uh the mission you will notice that one angel was very noble to me the rest of them just was seen ordinarily [Music] and remember it was in the pyramid where the mysterious white rock was not written off and the angel took me into the pyramid of himself watch this now he said the angels to be into the pyramid of themselves hallelujah the mysteries of god known only to them that had no words on it jesus there isn't that many christians people say if you listen brother branham tells us he don't know how and when right now so what we've had in our minds all these years have been the [Music] this is not a conditional covenant is is that moses and elijah is a sixth not the flesh sealer the man hallelujah to allow god's mind to be in me but god is saying you must in order 18 19 that you may know what is the hope of this calling and what the riches of the glory of the inheritance in saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us what who believe according to the working of his mighty power is that right now goes all the way back and he tells us that we were in the mind of god before time begins now god's thoughts about you it does not evolve [Music] perfection now the relationship [Music] oh thank god for the blood of jesus i know some of you all know these things already but just refresh your mind we're in a different age which we are so [Music] hallelujah how many all know that the prophet god likened the seven church ages as the wilderness after uh as a wilderness the church in the wilderness [Music] their experience and i'll get there in just a moment next year our experience see god always allow history to repeat itself you have to shoot perfect but this is the last round they're not cleaning another church age there's not coming another messenger amen so when somebody rise up and say they're the only angels know that they all walk in the world hallelujah hallelujah if there is an eighth angel it must be jesus christ that thou may be rich and white raymond the dominant be clothed and that the shame of that nakedness do not appear and anoint their eyes with eyeshadow that thou mayest see hallelujah we must anoint was black completely blacked out god allowed him to put a little light there hallelujah is that right hallelujah and he said when god testified [Music] that on the board is that right that's why god [Music] hallelujah [Music] as long as they spoke in time they claim that to be the holy ghost and give your revelation it's like the pentecostal revelations for the man of god let the prophet of so the [Music] elected in the name of jesus christ amen he said god is obligated according to uh first john cena and john yeah that we haven't read that yet [Music] no revelations 3 18 i'm sorry um and that the shame of that naked that's really good because i read it already [Music] uh [Music] [Music] because there is something god has in store for us but if if we if we if people think that the people who don't believe the seals are open the danger there is a new [Music] [Music] ages [Applause] this word from the inside out we are possessing the land hallelujah and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him and we shall see him as he is john just told you something hallelujah and he appeared in 1963 that was the beginning of the threefold portion of his coming amen those eight days what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him moses could not see him [Music] hey huh [Applause] i see him [Applause] [Music] hope in himself [Music] oh stop looking at this [Music] this flesh has a tendency to fight god [Music] god right hallelujah is because as he is because as he is [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is [Music] it authority oh [Music] it's yours listen let me say it like this the word of god foundation for faith now god may but this is is oh is of the seals [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and then he turned to his god [Music] just like those disciples [Music] [Music] let me ask you a question i know um they are [Music] christ had redeemed us back to that he let him remind you now listen he said christ has redeemed us back to that all right to redeem anything to bring it back about your supernatural experiences because they think you're trying to be like brothers [Music] like supposed to be doing far more you know one of the things i'm feeling joshua here quickly but you know when it comes to joshua josh was like the seventh seal hallelujah represent the holy ghost with yourself together the seals were opened god nobody knew him whether they want to believe it or not oh hallelujah he was getting his position then that's why the people with moses they're kind of like under the law that's right all right [Music] everybody was coming from the east west you can lay [Music] tell the people in other words he was praying [Music] he goes up to this great man [Music] of the lord [Applause] oh that's what god is doing with us oh he was getting his positions nowhere has ever been compared with joshua so when he's seen this man what was [Music] and that leader is none other than christ himself i don't even know what [Music] no man could open the shield [Music] them one of the things that joshua taught them hallelujah amen [Music] um amen joshua just alone by himself and i said seeing just what it was she said that he led him as an angel he stood and called himself against the walls of jericho of course [Music] abraham many many years before then i had no father himself to his people separation from the earthly jerseys which were spiritual things and they eat of the old chords [Music] real food you didn't build them [Music] everything comes free [Music] so wherever i wish i could do this go to the first chapter of joshua you love the lord amen hallelujah remember i think i i i preached it here last time i'm not sure but i dealt with uh inheritance and how the in the in in the earthen vessel you had the sealed vessel the seal documents and the regular documents that were given hallelujah [Music] public document uh we've seen you know the healings the deliverances and all that but there's a seal of document in the bottle according to jeremiah so here's the dawn bring that up to the seven seals and the thunders even though the seals made way open and then the thunder's uttered and there was like the space of a half hour and brother branham brings it out that that cloud lasted about 28 minutes [Music] hope in us let's go to the 24th chapter jesus christ now so that you know joshua had brought them to the land conquered the enemies some actually fell to some of the enemies [Music] balaam tried to kill israel the false doctrine god protected them no matter what kind of false doctrine comes around [Music] responsibility hallelujah i'm just going to start by god's grace and i'm jumping so i can't read this whole thing you can read it which is just the first chapter i mean the 24th chapter and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel [Music] for their judges and for their officers and they present themselves before god jesus but but you know that when you come out of the church ages when you come out of laodicea you [Music] but [Music] uh [Music] starting with all the scriptures that were pertaining to him [Music] hallelujah standing right there had to reveal to her [Music] that's what this message is and i sent the hornet [Music] [Music] [Music] right one hornet calls the tribes of canaan to be afraid [Music] way over here denominations are not afraid of you for william brown [Music] oh [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] you don't ah yeah when they're caught you see what i'm saying this message has already conquered the language hallelujah see what we call shaking up you know that's not what god [Music] you know this grand dude people coming in let's shake whatever we can say get whatever we can get out of here [Music] what is true that's why buddhism god joshua is bringing them to adoption but joshua is getting ready to leave this this last chapter joshua died in other words his mission was accomplished see that's what people don't understand the holy ghost is lifting lifted when it's up gone the working of the holy ghost is already done the bride has made herself ready what are you so that you can conquer your enemy yeah and josh was saying unto the people you cannot serve the lord for he is a holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your transgression nor your sins today [Music] are you gonna take that yesterday [Music] [Laughter] i know and serve strange gods then he will turn into to your hurt consume you after that he had done you good that's it and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the lord hallelujah you haven't [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah i'll see the coming of the lord when somebody else might be sitting right by me and not seeing it he didn't give us a win in the house [Music] there are some things i may not know there are some places that i cannot go but there's one is spawn all can be heard is oh my god is love for me is just how you felt when jesus washed all your sins always [Music] is [Applause] is is if we are as hopes amen wasn't as ripe as it [Music] move in this place the one world ought to move into its place are you preparing yourself you love the lord amen amen anyone need prayers [Music] so uh you
