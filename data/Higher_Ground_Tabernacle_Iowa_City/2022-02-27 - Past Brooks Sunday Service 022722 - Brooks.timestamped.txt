[25:51] and we give you praise this morning
[25:54] for your beautiful holiness

[26:47] is to
[26:48] uh to lose courage

[26:53] to lose your courage
[26:57] or resolution
[27:01] in other words a man you it sets off an
[27:04] alarm

[27:33] or in portion of the confusion
[27:35] where there was a time they believed god
[27:39] we even thought we'll quite you they

[28:52] [Music]
[28:55] he allowed fear
[28:59] to overcome the word spoken

[29:04] and when fear gripped him
[29:07] hallelujah he began to sing
[29:11] oh my
[29:12] but the portion i love about this
[29:16] is that he was so close to his goal

[39:57] get you to repent
[40:00] if you don't repent
[40:04] being that god will love you god loves
[40:07] you
[40:22] david wasn't going to repent
[40:26] but god had to raise up a prophet
[40:31] to expose him differently exposed

[40:35] it was the grace of god
[40:38] somebody help me here
[40:43] hallelujah amen
[40:46] you must realize would ever really take

[42:03] now i'm speaking in a way i'm kind of
[42:05] being pulled in two ways but i'm trying
[42:06] to bring this message
[42:10] so you can understand that god is not
[42:13] asleep
[42:23] sometimes god allowed things to happen
[42:26] just to wake you up
[42:41] that's old testament
[42:56] and i'll say it like this no matter what

[45:17] and said let us go up
[45:19] at once and possess it
[45:22] for we are well able to overcome it
[45:36] but the man that went up with him said
[45:39] we be not able to go up against the
[45:42] people
[45:43] for they are stronger than
[45:58] and they brought up an evil report of
[46:01] the land
[46:02] which they had searched unto the
[46:04] children of israel saying
[46:06] the land through which we have gone to
[46:09] search it
[46:10] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[46:14] thereof
[46:15] and all the people that we saw
[46:18] in it are men of great statues
[46:40] [Music]
[46:44] and there we saw the giants and the son
[46:47] of anak
[46:48] which come of the giants and we were in
[46:52] our own sight as grasshoppers
[46:57] [Music]
[47:15] [Music]
[47:22] hallelujah but because of all the
[47:25] obstacles
[47:29] because of all the the the giants
[47:32] of course the the young and the
[47:34] different tribes of course
[47:39] [Music]
[47:45] god
[47:47] had delivered them out of egypt
[47:50] out
[48:04] is that right man god caused him the
[48:07] cross to see
[48:11] he had the red sheep back up
[48:16] he had the red sea department
[48:24] it was supernatural after supernatural
[48:28] at the supernatural
[48:30] hallelujah
[48:31] they saw god working through a man
[48:34] hallelujah
[48:37] but they missed it man it's so monkey

[48:42] monkey seller hallelujah
[48:44] moses was a great man

[49:35] because when you think
[49:38] in your mind
[49:40] and in your heart
[49:42] god

[54:00] that the man who did this thing
[54:02] was worthy of death
[54:05] [Music]
[54:06] somebody help me here man yeah
[54:09] are we

[54:15] he kind of thought yeah
[54:17] you are the man
[54:22] we can't imagine
[54:25] what david felt like
[54:29] did he get punished escalated oh you're
[54:32] going to be punished
[54:36] hello
[54:39] but david said
[54:40] ability
[54:42] i rather fall into the hands of god
[54:47] than in the hands of a man
[54:51] but let me say it like this
[54:55] david
[54:56] lost his baby
[55:00] and he lost his children
[55:03] and because of what he did of course the
[55:06] secular all kinds of evil plagued his

[55:26] wait until you never ever do such a
[55:29] thing like that

[55:47] israel
[55:48] in the face of god

[1:24:56] gonna let you go well not let you go but
[1:24:59] uh just uh get into what i really want
[1:25:01] to get in shortly
[1:25:08] because i believe it this way that's
[1:25:09] because your quality i
[1:25:24] me
[1:25:38] to restore
[1:25:51] now to bring anything back to its
[1:25:53] rightful owner
[1:25:58] therefore
[1:26:00] some way
[1:26:02] therefore
[1:26:04] some way it went away from its rightful
[1:26:06] owner
[1:26:48] to
[1:26:51] like if someone stole some property come
[1:26:54] for example
[1:26:56] and they're holding the property captive
[1:27:02] uh
[1:27:32] oh what a text
[1:27:36] oh what a subject
[1:27:38] how i'd like to have two days on that in
[1:27:41] force
[1:27:42] foreign
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:27] i see we have a right to force these
[1:28:29] claims upon satan
[1:28:34] and say give it back
[1:28:37] diablo and he has to do it
[1:29:07] because the holy spirit is there to make
[1:29:09] him do it
[1:29:14] the law of the land is to enforce
[1:29:17] it
[1:29:19] and for the land
[1:29:22] it's by the land
[1:29:26] but the law of the spirit man of god is
[1:29:30] true that's what it is before satan and
[1:29:32] the father give up that which he has
[1:29:34] unrightfully
[1:29:50] peace sickness of the body the zombies
[1:29:54] are placed upon people
[1:29:57] made them in his image
[1:30:02] and the church is given the rightful
[1:30:04] legal rights
[1:30:08] to take the holy spirit upon the
[1:30:10] sentence
[1:30:11] this upon him
[1:30:18] this last quote
[1:30:25] you know we scream we survey nuclear we
[1:30:28] hollow
[1:30:30] which is nothing wrong with that yeah
[1:30:57] and we don't know what to do
[1:31:02] and the only way to overcome that
[1:31:04] confusion
[1:31:07] is it get down on your knees
[1:31:10] acknowledge the lord
[1:31:13] and he will direct your past
[1:31:43] body it's
[1:31:44] here just like a husband called used to
[1:31:47] come and white is one person
[1:31:50] something you and i are going to be one
[1:31:53] more yeah
