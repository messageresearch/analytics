[29:18] on the subject
[29:21] the age of the omnipotent
[29:26] [Music]
[29:33] preached a message in
[29:35] more than one he preached
[29:37] in 1956
[29:39] about
[29:44] on the junction of time
[29:48] and in this message was uh really some
[29:52] powerful statements
[29:57] but i i fear that uh
[30:00] a lot of people are not seeing the
[30:03] what's happening now
[30:06] la prepared
[30:33] in this age
[30:51] [Music]
[30:54] [Applause]
[31:01] and god
[31:02] a jew
[31:14] will come to perfection
[31:22] [Music]
[31:28] he tells us that omnipotence inside the
[31:31] cave importance comes on the scene via
[31:34] oc
[31:35] and when omnipotence come on the scene
[31:38] of the potassium the miraculous always
[31:41] happens
[31:44] hallelujah
[31:59] to speak of omnipotence
[32:05] omnipotence is the all powerful
[32:10] and it takes
[32:11] the
[32:13] miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence
[32:20] i'm going to pause there
[32:22] because no matter how much
[32:26] basket we say
[32:31] [Music]
[32:39] to vindicate us
[32:51] [Music]
[32:54] omnipotence
[32:58] to vindicate him by the miraculous
[33:02] hallelujah
[33:04] the things in which god did through him
[33:15] [Music]
[33:34] is
[33:35] [Music]
[33:52] [Applause]
[33:58] and i believe
[34:00] that the church is now standing okay
[34:03] he's a chairman at a threshold or
[34:05] vehicle
[34:08] the church is not standing in a position
[34:12] of the greatest vindication
[34:16] of omnipotence
[34:18] that the world has ever known
[34:22] there has been
[34:24] amen
[34:26] when brother branham was speaking of
[34:27] this conflict
[34:29] he was literally talking about god and
[34:32] his coming
[34:59] that god was getting ready
[35:14] we'll find out
[35:17] that that it was the saddest scene
[35:22] of god in the whole bible
[35:35] in the whole bible
[35:37] here with jesus christ
[35:52] he said that was such a sad scene he can
[35:55] sit there
[36:21] hallelujah amen like the prophet of god
[36:35] he was dealing with the mystery of
[36:37] christ in his church
[36:52] hallelujah
[36:54] [Music]
[37:02] [Music]
[37:06] the spirit
[37:21] representing
[37:22] representatives hallelujah amen because
[37:25] of all of the church
[37:29] she was the most beautiful
[37:32] hallelujah
[37:34] she had beautiful gifts
[37:37] she had beautiful she she had beautiful
[37:39] everything
[37:41] yeah she was so beautiful
[37:44] she thought within herself
[37:47] enriched get moisturized
[37:52] [Music]
[38:07] [Music]
[38:14] and i thought it was really wonderful
[38:37] the
[38:37] the the the sea
[38:44] yeah the
[38:46] animals or the fish in the sea
[38:51] hallelujah
[38:53] and
[38:54] he said in in this respect
[38:57] if you take the fish out of the sea
[39:04] they will die
[39:07] hallelujah
[39:08] and he said the seas from the earth
[39:12] the uh
[39:25] he said but when god created man
[39:29] he created man from himself
[39:34] he took god he took man out of himself
[39:39] and if you separate man from god
[39:43] did you like the fish from the sea
[39:46] like the trees from the earth
[39:52] hallelujah amen so you and i know i
[39:55] don't know
[39:56] we
[39:57] uh separate ourselves from god
[40:01] hallelujah we will die
[40:04] every man that separates himself from
[40:07] the creator
[40:22] so we see that man is in a constant
[40:25] state of dying okay
[40:31] and we can see
[40:33] throughout the history of israel
[40:35] god always made
[40:38] some kind of atonement
[40:41] for men to listen
[40:44] hallelujah
[40:46] but the thing that i'm trying to get to
[40:49] like because you said it was up there
[40:51] it's the very fact
[40:54] that things do not change
[41:00] in other words
[41:03] solomon said
[41:06] there's no new thing
[41:09] under the sun
[41:12] hallelujah
[41:14] it's it's very laughable
[41:19] when we see science carnivorous
[41:23] thinking bouncing that they are the
[41:25] first to arrive
[41:30] at whatever point
[41:32] they were that
[41:45] that the science of yesterday
[41:51] than the science today
[41:56] and in all of our achievements
[42:14] hallelujah
[42:22] about these germs that we're now dealing
[42:25] with they say
[42:27] they say
[42:41] eating
[42:42] diseases
[42:56] we'll be
[43:05] hallelujah
[43:20] [Music]
[43:26] the lord
[43:28] so we realized
[43:30] amen that that god is
[43:34] calling for something
[43:38] that's
[43:52] the minister that we are living
[43:56] just at the near appearing
[43:59] of the second time
[44:01] of the coming of the lord jesus christ
[44:34] so we know
[44:42] [Music]
[44:48] hallelujah
[45:02] we're at a time
[45:05] that we must understand
[45:07] that we must be careful
[45:10] attention on how we live
[45:16] evil
[45:30] and why was she spoon
[45:33] for me she refused
[45:35] to obey the word
[45:39] i understand what i'm saying
[45:40] now we know
[45:42] nobody
[45:44] can dance dance repeat dancing like the
[45:47] layers of the scenes come later on this
[45:49] year
[45:50] huh
[45:52] nobody can dance like the pentecostals
[45:55] y'all better hear what i'm saying
[45:58] oh speak in
[46:26] see

[46:43] that william branham
[46:49] fought our harvest
[46:53] of omnipotence
[46:58] [Music]
[47:34] is
[47:38] [Music]
[47:43] you may have heard me say this before
[47:47] but it goes back to the bloodline
[47:56] you see this is one of the reasons
[48:00] why cain could not receive the blessings
[48:02] of god
[48:18] must
[48:45] he mixed with hagar
[48:54] he had to mix
[48:56] with somebody
[48:58] that was of his true blood
[49:00] abraham develop
[49:14] to inherit or to to get something from
[49:17] god
[49:28] amen you understand me
[49:30] reason being
[49:32] he did not come from eden
[49:38] hallelujah yeah even though he was born
[49:41] in eden memphis
[50:25] both seeds totally decimals are planted
[50:28] in the same field
[50:31] but it is the nature of the seeds
[50:36] that determines

[51:27] amen
[51:28] is that right yes

[52:14] suc
[52:58] i know one thing are you saying shows i
[53:01] believe with all my heart

[1:10:26] he said when all hell turns loose
[1:10:33] all heaven turns loose too
[1:10:38] hallelujah
[1:10:39] so we don't fear i don't know
[1:10:42] we must

[1:10:50] i'm going to give you something
[1:10:52] god never join us ask you something to
[1:10:55] do or ask you to do something

[1:11:23] i know this is not a shouting message
[1:11:28] let us see
[1:11:35] this in order for us to make a rapture
[1:11:37] we're going to push down our left
[1:12:20] god if you're
[1:12:34] if that makes sense she's in love i'm
[1:12:36] facing my notes but i'm gonna try to get
[1:12:38] back here
[1:12:42] oh my god
[1:12:44] so in in this time
[1:12:47] and i caught the thought
[1:13:00] that means he kept striking the same
[1:13:02] area sometimes more than once
[1:13:07] pleading for he had he had to make sure
[1:13:11] that everything was fitting he took
[1:13:13] choice
[1:13:16] hallelujah so are the preachers of this
[1:13:19] day
[1:13:22] like this
[1:13:24] doesn't matter
[1:13:25] how long you've been in the nation
[1:13:30] what really matters take your calls how
[1:13:32] long the message has been
[1:13:34] taken
[1:13:36] amen is that right yes
[1:13:38] because once the message is in you in
[1:13:40] the foreign

[1:15:16] the church got cold dead and dropped off
[1:15:22] hallelujah so much solo and see amen the
[1:15:25] only people he had left
[1:15:28] was his family personally
[1:15:31] somebody helped me here

[1:15:35] member of the time without the
[1:15:36] tribulation

[1:18:51] what the age of ephesus was like seeking
[1:18:56] but now that the word has been restored
[1:19:01] hallelujah
[1:19:02] the sons of god can now take their
[1:19:05] positions
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:34] wherever jesus is
