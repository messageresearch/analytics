Jesus Christ we would like to appreciate the presence of each one of you this morning are you all right see the church is almost empty many people didn't come today I know some of us [Music] okay as we standing let's read in mark say The Book of Mark chapter 16 verse 14 we read in of Jesus afterwards as they laid at the table he was manifested to the 11 and reproached them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they had not believed those who had seen him [Music] risen and he said to them go into all the world preach the Glad Tiding to all the creation he that believes and baptized shall be saved and he that disbelieves shall be [Music] condemed and this son shall follow those those that have believe in my name they shall cast out demons they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and they should drink any dead things it shall not injure them they shall lay hands upon the infir and they shall be well the Lord therefore after he had spoken to them was taken up into heaven and S at the right hand of God and they going forward preach everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the sons following let's PR Lord Jesus Our Father God if I was not an instructed man I wouldn't be able to read this word but I know that I'm not based upon I'm not basing upon but I myself your hands so that the dispor of the holy spirit so that you can come and fulfill your word I said that in that day no one shall tell to each other no God but they they shall be teached by the Holy Spirit come and be revealed to us this morning bring us the life that is your as we ask the only precious name marous of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated this morning I say I would like to bring something new as I said the last time I fa Le to talk about church if you you paid attention all the series of message that I've BR of here all of my sermon all my the Ser the seron are linked with the the the sermon the leading of the church the teaching of the church if we can back go back to the series of Elijah and Elisha it was the image of Christ in the church if we go back then uh recently with est it was also the type of church uh Christ in the church we spoke about the church in the Old Testament this morning we going to talk about the church in the New Testament as you know it the prophet of God said that the Old Testament was the the the shadow of the New Testament that the Old Testament the New Testament are the Shad of the day that we live in so this morning we're going to speak about the [Music] church I would like to title my sermon this morning the church and his [Music] commission if you pay attention close pay attention to Mark [Music] 16 you said that the Lord appeared to the 11 disciple where they were at the table and he reproached them about the this their unbelieved why is the Lord talking about condemn their unbelief because they didn't believe those who saw him risen you can see in our uht there were women who saw that the Lord was Raising there was Mary of magdala and Mary Mary magdal there was salom also those who went to the Tom to put some uh spices and when when they got the tomb and the tomb was open and they started wondering why the grave was open and the Bible say they saw an angel of God who was sitting on at the Rock and he told them why are you looking the living among the dead said return and say to this that is not here that is's going to meet them in Jerusalem and the women went back they told the other that the Lord has risen but they didn't believe in even those two disciple the Lord appeared to them and they had a conversation and at the evening the Lord did something that he did before he it was the broken of the brain and the way he broke up that's why they recognized that there was the Lord and when they recognized they went back to Jerusalem to the disciple that the Lord is risen even though they brought the message of res thep didn't believe on it unbel to the the resurrection of the [Music] Lord even if the when the Lord appeared to them and he started to blame them condemn them upon their Inc the say that he appeared to the 11 he condemn their unbelief and the disbelief of their heart because they didn't believe those who who saw him rais then he told them go all preach the good news to the old who that shall be baptized will Beed will beem these are the miracle that shall go with those believe in my name they shall cast they shall speak with new they shall take up [Music] serpent if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not inure them they shall L their hands upon the and the sick will be that's the Lord himself as he said himself that word has to be the truth there's nothing that can change that word because it's the Lord Jesus Christ SP the word by his mou I believe that word is so anointed morning that word has that same power to accomplish to fulfill the Mir yes brothers and sisters and they were preach everywhere the Lord work with him and confirming the word by the sons following upon him as I said this morning I want to speak about the church and his commission what is a commission when I went to the dictionary said a commission it's a message that they give to someone it's a service did to someone or it's a mission we G speak about a church and it commission are we right this morning I believe we have to be uh ready ready so that we understand where the spirit is bringing us now [Music] listen I'd like us to verify check and think about this verse the Bible says and he appeared to the 11 where they at the table reproach them upon their unbelief remember in Matthew 10 some Pro itth the Lord himself who's choosing his disciples he chose his disci real the same disciple that he chose in Matthew when he chose them in Matthew 10 also Judah but he s he kep them his first commission around the word only preached to the lost sheep of Israel only preached to the Lost of the Bible says so they went accomplishing miring sick because the Lord has G them the commission and he told them when you shall go there and tell them the kingdom of God preach the good go heal the sick Dem that's what they did it was Matthew 10ap from the first verse and he called to his 12 and them authority over unle and to cast them out and to heal every disease andity the names of the 12 disciples the first Simon was called Andel his brother and when we go down to to to you see that there was also Judas isar the one who where they said Judas so Judah is among the Lord himself chose and he knew that Judah was betray but he chose him anyway now we can say as Jud that was there it was not a problem he was already now in Mark Judah is already the Lord has already risen even if the Lord is Judah was not and the Bible say he started condemn them according to the the disciple were still disbel and the Lord started rebuke them with their disbelief what I want to say I want to say this being baptized in water it's not enough when you baptized in water it's not enough there's something else more than being just being baptized in waters and he said that now why have you been disbelieved the lady told you that I was RIS but you didn't believe you didn't believe it they were disbelief I want you to understand there were Apostles not only any kind of AP Apostle of Jesus Christ already accompl you see that when they accomplish miracles and he the Lord was still alive he just chosen them they accomplish Judah also accomplished Miracles he the one that betrayed the Lord he went with the 12 when they came back they said Lord theey their Spirit the Lord knowing that Judah that was say do not rejoice but the fact that the spirit that your name is written in the book in heaven the fact of casting out the spirit didn't make them being saved brothers and S so they were unbel were unbeliever person but in which the Lord and revealed to them and told him go around the world preach a good gospel and him that the one that will believe and be bed shall be saved whom that will not will be condemned and the Bible say he said these are the signs shall follow those those that believe he could say these are the that but he didn't say because they were still unbelief he says when you be will be now these are the sin that shall follow those that have believed in my name they shall cast out demons they shall take up serpents they shall speak new tongues drink any dead will not injure them they they will take up serpents the serpent would not do anything to them they will lay their hands up they will L their hands upon the SE and they shall be well the Lord himself that promised and the church the commission that the church has received that that there is that's the base of if there's a gathering of people who are called Church they need to have these things among them they don't have these things then it's no longer called church church and the job The Works that the message that the church re the service The Works that the church has to do preach a good gospel lay their hands onck speak new Tong take up serpents there's anything deadly if there's any will not them that's a church and as long as there's we're not supposed to say that there's a church it will only be a gathering of who didn't know what to do on Sunday and just came to GA in a building just to waste their time and to show off how good they were dress let me say the way I want to say because the church has forgotten the church has forgotten the church has forgotten what the Lord the the church has started teaching and all kind of all these things that bring nothing even if they teaching and when they're teaching those missst it's really wrong the work of the church is to go around preach the gospel him that shall and will be Bap shall be saved that shall not he'll be condemned prophet lived in this country the Lord has used them a lot to bring forth a message of repentance he could go to a town and have meeting 20,000 people believe in the Lord and create a church down there when he comes back next year he couldn't even find 20 people in church when Paul used to go preach and if there was one person that beli the person would stay there when he found over so one person brings and that makes 30 people in a year bil bilam with his message he could have 20,000 people next year no more to people no I want to ask you this question this church how how long this church has been it could be8 to 9 years now take 9 to8 to nine years let's say that that there was only one person that believed in this church multiply by the number years if he's a truly believer bring forth bring it 29 people so in a year we have 30 people and the five years we will have 150 people in this place in eight years we have two 240 people in this same place now look at what we are and understand the mission that we have how did we treat the word how did we conduct ourselves with the word we not even 50s here why is the church now invol uh moving growing because it's because people have jumped skipped the St people make uh uh uh pretend to believe but they didn't really believe so if you understand this church should have have over 500 people because as you sit in you already been here five years you should already bring five 150 and if those 150 people are not here this morning I don't know if I can call you a Believer let me read what says about believer what is a believer now he said just want to so you understand you understand what the prophet God said about believer why do we call this person a believer in the message uh fighting uh fighting for the F fighting for the faith that was transm once for the Saints this is inag 71 he says when we see somebody in the church who goes to church do not bring the C OFA in church it's already the season so a even one day if I'm not long here if it's the will of God that I'm some somewhere else because we are passenger and Stranger In This World Paul went and one day you will remember me and he used to tell us don't bring the Cod of Ian Church okay let the Lord help us this morning so that the C of AA do not find his place here listen says we say that these are the sign of a Believer because he comes to church is a good man he he pays his debt I have nothing to say about it he educate his children that's good it's wonderful I have nothing to say say about but the prophet say but that's not the sign of a Believer not even preach the evang that's not a sign of a Believer Jesus said he said these are the miracle that shall I be with those that are believe in my name they shall cast demon they will speak new tongues they will catch up serpents even if they drink any that would not hurt them they lay their hands on the sick and the sick shall be well and brother says these are the sons of believer he say but today let's try to to preach it or to do so they will make fun of you they have appearance of goodness but they they they they're refusing the the the strength everybody that is Christian have the power to pray for the sick every Christian anybody that believes has the power to pray for the sick I want to read somewhere brother say that if you have not been if you have not been a Believer and that those sign that it's not going and you claim that you're a believer you just you just made it in your mind that you a beli you just never been but you in order for you to be a believer you have to have the the sign of Mark 16 that's what makes a church a church is not just a gathering of people who don't know what to do on a day but the church church receed the ministry of the Lord Jesus the Same Ministry that the Lord the same that the churches received to continue the ministry that's what we have as job and those kind of message those type of message people don't want it anymore people want Mysteries all type of things those things that that doesn't even make sense says we already mature this this is a gospel for children little kid why do you have to preach us these things came he Reed the Holy Ghost In Our Place didn't receive the holy go for you has a true he also had to receive the holy ghost out of anything God that God has done with him out of anything that God have manifested in was a Believer he had to receive the Holy Ghost to show that he was a type of True Believer that's why the Holy Ghost we cannot go around we can never pretend to be Christians if we did not go through the experience personal experience of the Holy Spirit when you not with God you're not going to say amen I know already you're going to leave this place and say what he what was he talking about that's the commission of the church that's what makes the church I'm already tired of this chur where I don't see the manifestation of God I have to be true with you I'm already tired being in front of [Applause] people who doesn't even have a shadow of God in him I'm already tired I need a church we are people have the manifestation of spirit when he came down in as elah he had a message of restoration he had to restore the heart to the father of Pentecost and that's what brother did before even bringing the restor the church to what he was in the P that's why our message it's a message of heart it's a message of heart has to touch your heart to bring your heart back to the pente that's why he said El come restore the heart of children to their fathers and that's what Bram did now listen to [Music] this Jesus is Comm uh commissioning his church that's the purpose even the goal of the [Music] church General Orders of Jesus in his church was go around world and preach the gospel everything that we we just demonstrated and he spoke to them and the Bible says between 19 and 20 they said 20 read 20 says what he say Mark and they go forth preach everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the word by the sons following upon it before going the Lord told him in different he said even if I seen do not go yet stay in Jerusalem until you receive the Holy Ghost go to chapter and the Bible say the Lord told them you receive a power the holy ghost coming upon you and in that time you will be my witness jerusem here in Jerusalem Jud in Juda Sam all around the world so there had to be Witnesses being witnesses witnesses of witnesses of Resurrection Witnesses of Jesus you couldn't be without receiving the the Holy Ghost that's why made them Witnesses let me say clearly we can call wi wi of Jesus Christ we do not receive the Holy Ghost when you receive the Holy Ghost that's when you become a truly true and that's why you receive of the true Witness when you will you will speak about something that You' seen and that you've heard something that you experienced church was supposed to B be based on experience you have to question yourself since you become a Christian what are your experience with the Lordi what are your experiences the Bible say David in the Old Testament when he had an experience that the experience of David his experiences brought him a lot of faith that's why when he he was in in front of he said he said the same God that delivered against and the MTH of the LI tonight will deliver me against this Philistine why did he say that basing upon his experience and his experience G him to believe that the same God who help me who will help me with this that's why experiences are important in Christian Life yes brothers and sisters now he has commissioned his church says in this message second coming of the Lord say now no today in my the scriptures that I just read Mark is one of the Glorious message and the most important to be preached today when we speak about Mark 16 one of the Glorious the most important can preached today so we cannot consider our message important because this is the base of Christian this is the base of Christian this the base of a church without church has not a reason to be to exist it's really difficult to say but it's the truth before they reive the Holy Ghost they were unbelief no matter what they did in the previous days they were still disbel before you receed the Holy Ghost replace X by his value before receiving the Holy Ghost who are you unbelief because the Lord said that the Apostle were were unbeliev glory to God even if they were unbeliev he sent them in way but before send it say stay there at Jerusalem and you will receive the gift of the spirit a mighty power you and then you'll be my Witnesses Jerusalem in Jud all around the world all around the word here today we God needs winess that are around the world United States is at the corner of the border of the world Africa is around the world Europe is around because he was he was talking about the region of Jerusalem Judea Jerusalem Sam now say not only here but all around the world it says everywhere even in United States even in Africa even in Europe we are all around the world brothers sisters let me go slowly so that I Cann l so the Lord may help us to understand something that's behind my spirit I want the Lord to help us to understand this says in message hear him said do not [Music] be do not think that I'm trying to blame you and this morning I'm not trying to condemn you I'm only trying to tell you the truth look the condition of the church today the word of for that the last Commission of Jesus go around the [Music] world these are the miracle that are go with those that I believe and the church is going around it the church has the church has gone around the message the commission of the Lord the church has gone around healing of body gift of spirit a Pure Life and holy life things that the church has gone around that's why the church is in this condition the church is not improving that's why the church is dy because they have left that aside say a message fighting for Ander stood and say so maybe he didn't take his dinner and he went and had a vision and called all his eled he called them to his house and they sat down and they took something to wash the uh and they took chair seats and they gathered together make a little bigger make it a little bigger can you see from the back and he and Peter started testimony how the Holy Spirit came down on the day of the Pentecost and Peter said this words so the Holy Ghost came down on the Gentiles says this is the faith that was transmitted to the SS once the holy ghost that came down on the that's the faith that was transmitted to the SS once what was that you shall have faith when you will receive the Holy Ghost before receiving the Holy Ghost you don't have faith in you're not a Believer you just been baptized have been baptized the Holy Ghost came down on that's the fa that was transmitted to S and they started speaking in Tong praising Gody [Music] God and they held the same kind of meeting like in the day of p i want you to notice that when Peter went in cor's house those people didn't take a baptism of water the Holy Ghost came down on them they didn't go to the water of Bap Holy Ghost Came Upon them there's a way you can receive the Holy Ghost without even being baptized water Bap it's not what saves you the prophet God say water of baptis has no virtues on him water of baptis is just word if you didn't really pain we just going to waste our time bringing you to the world you are missing time to go to the swimming we'll just take you there take shower uh you know swim and that's that's the job you've given us instead of going swim by yourself you take you're taking out all of us to see how you swimming in the waters and they started speaking in Tong without being baptized by Waters ever since I've been here it's it's difficult to hear somebody speaking in Tong the the the language that we have those tongues that we have is did you hear what he did you see what he did did you see that child what he did that's the tong that we speak really if you see the sign of time started speaking about that time is gone but we have to go to a place where we have to stop everything ask our who am I where am I with christianis there's two stepe of christianism chanis int the intellectual christianism learn by the knowledge of the word and there's an authentic christianism but many we still in intellectual christianism that's what makes the church in this condition Church looks like a sick and needs to be transfused with blood let me let me go when Peter said that they receive the Holy Ghost and now he said can we now give them the word of Bap to those who Reed the holy goes as as we receive now now we told them go and be baptized in the of Jesus and he stayed there with them many days let's go to something else that's why say I read this scripture when I was speaking about Elijah and Elisha excuse me I can remove this too says we wear this to honor you but our suits are just suit of work that's that's SCS work if it's too high I ask you if I can remove it if you can grant it to me it's like it's like I remove my scrub that the one I have to work with but it's only because it's act and today uh suits are become something else it shows you you see what I work it's a design I don't want to say names I want to say names now listen I read this SCP where the Prophet I think that a man or woman a boy or girl with an intellectual conception of the [Music] word we never reach a perfect Foundation it's in why speak before meeting this light that brings this word to a reality now I don't believe that a church with practice no matter how intellectual they are that church will never Prosper before the supernatural be known by these people and that seen them and see something in which they can speak about and that thing that can respond back to them and confirm that the word that before the supernatural being known in any kind of church that church shall never Prosper as long as long as we have a conception of Christian the church will never Prosper I'm saying this to raise the Revival in you [Music] understand that we have a responsibility to live the word of way that even if you are alone you still live the word because even you alone always an eye that observes you but today God gives you an opportunity to reach to meet with someone instead of preaching that person the word of God by the way of living but you take the person that God put on your way and you blocking the kingom of God you blocking him to believe the word by the way of living that's what we're doing today that's the church is in this Condition it's a really miserable it's it's really miserable I'm not saying anything against your church Brothers you are people that are uh like uh perils I'm not saying anything against Catholic I love Catholic as I love people ofam Tabernacle I'm not coming after you my brother it's not you Methodist Baptist Orab it's I'm not crying I'm not coming after you I'm coming after the sin that you letting the devil make you do that's the only thing I'm coming up to you I cry against the that you let the devil make you do the fact that you go to church you think that you're saved Jesus can never accept a man who's not born from water and spirit he will never go to the kingdom as long as you not born from Spirit you will not get into the kingdom the kingdom will be closed and hell is your place where you shall go no matter how long you've been in the message you have just carried a name a name of brist a name of christianti a name of bod name of I'm not against those things I'm only coming after sin Jesus will never accept who is not born from water and you will not enter to the kingdom that's that's said the Lord my brothers and sisters after you reive the baptism of the Holy Spirit these are the miracle that we go with this is different it's it's not going around but it's straight from the Bible see the signs of a Believer When You Believe means is when you you receive the Holy Ghost before you receive the Holy Ghost don't say that you a Believer it's hard to say but it's the truth you're just going coming with the Believers you only the step of intellectual christianis I'm only responsible to say what God has the message Resurrection 103 I'm only responsible what God has told says you don't receive the Holy Ghost once you believe you receive the Holy Ghost after believing you receive the Holy Ghost after you believe and it's a gift of God anything else will give you there you cannot imagine that you have it you cannot just accept it by faith say that I believe that I have the Holy Ghost brother you cannot accept it by [Music] faith it's absolutely a works of God that comes to your heart and that reveals the presence of Jesus Christ and when you receive the Holy Ghost then you believe in all sort of Miracles and signs and not only you believe but you practice them and you come to what it and these are the sons that shall follow those that have believed and each one of you Beed the and preach the goel that believe whom that and these are the go with those I believe yes brothers and sisters and the prophet say that's the signs of a Believer do you believe that's what the Bible says these are the last word of Jesus Christ when he was living the Earth say message the same Mage [Music] 104 it says if this sign don't go along with you then you just pretending to be a believer if the signs don't go with we just we just making it up that we believers we just making favor to God God you know I'm I'm your believer to be a believer the signs have to go if the signs don't go along with you then you just making it up on your mind because these are the son that will may be accompan Jesus said these are the son that maybe these are the son that shall follow the last word that he addressed to the church may God comes to your help as we bow down our heads that was the prophet give me 20 more minutes and I'll stop from today and we continue later you were already ready I got you today church has lost everything Divine Healing praying for the sick all the virtues tongs in churches church has lost everything but she still pretending to be the lady Jesus that's the spirit of the age a religious spirit where people call themselves Christians but when you get closer to them find out they not Christian Christian by name Christians by Form appearance and the general orders of Jesus he says preach the gospel to the entire creation it was to go preach the gospel it was to receive the Lost uh the Lost sword that that's what have to be a subject to the church today but today the church has become it became a gathering of people where they they contribute they save some money next time next time you going to get collect the money that's what the church is see why we we brought the church that's church today and we miss the principal uh purpose of the church when I believe the word I was a little boy maybe some could say because my father was a Christian and I could could you know my father is a Christian he's a pastor it's okay I know that at a certain time you get to a point where you don't need the god the god of your father you have to get the point when you need your only God a God that knows you personally and in which you have been uh done an a personal experience one day I was inashi it was the first time living my parents house it was in 2003 I went to one of my uncle's house inashi in that house my my my my my father told me that there was a spirit of witch house D said that and I said you know there was a evil spirit there but you sending me there and I accepted and I went I had to go to university and one day I wake up I sat my and I slept it was during the day it was around 3 p.m. or 4m. I was sitting on my bed laying on the bed I had my eye right open at a time and I see my eyes starting to close up and I felt like I was falling from nowhere and when I started trying to my voice was not coming up I said Lord what's happening to me CU I couldn't sleep I was not sleeping I was I was awake I started to fight against myself said Lord I want to die I'm going to die in this house but at the time and I don't know why I said Lord save me suddenly I came back on myself and when I came back to myself my heart was be in a speed of 100 something and I woke up I took my P and I wrote I wrote to my I say Dad this is the experience I just live today and I told him every day and what he said to them he said my son I know that I told you I already told you you had to be in that house so that you can experience your christianism to compare it to something maybe I didn't say right maybe to to measure your christianism to something so that you may know that you if you really a a Christian which magicians are there and when you say that you're a Christian one day you have to face this to a contest to measure up your christianism there was a pastor who was baptizing people I believe you know the story it was in Congo he said come believe in Jesus believe in Jesus and there was a magician from the village who also came he he pretended to believe and as he knew that they would go to the baptism so the magician had the power to transform into a crocodile and once they got in the water and they took the the the the guy to put him in water so the pastor felt like he was taken by a crocodile and the Cod took him somewhere in the middle of the water river there was like a little island in the middle of the river the crocodile left him there now the Cod went left back and the other saw the the pastor stood there because he couldn't swim back and the river was deep to to to swim we had they had to do mediation when they asked they asked the magician can't you free the man of God can't you please free the man of God he said I don't have any problem to free him the only problem is I just wanted to understand that it doesn't have that power that is pretending to have and that's the stage of the the church we profess [Music] Christi but we're not really Christians we call our church our churches now we have other priorities looking for H looking for money raising up that's what church is doing today the church has to look for the lost soul how could they look for the Lost Souls if she even uh lost her identity her True Value it's really sad today in church the word is in church and the church is in the word we thought that we left the word now we found the word in uh the word in the church those who were in con know that a singer brother pattice he sing it the world in the church the church the church in the world that's the state of the church today you know when you don't believe the word yet when you in the world you like in an ocean just die and the word of God comes he comes and en cches you it takes you from that death that you have to die from that ocean and you know that a person that was supposed to die in waters you know generally those people drink a lot of water because they fighting for their life they're going to take a lot of water in there now the gospel come and saves you and takes you out of wat and takes you out of the world that's not enough where we you were you had to drink a lot of water what does the gospel do takes you out of the water from the world put you aside now he's taking care of you to take out the water that you have swallowed that's why said there's two type of Christian correct it's not two two steps of Christian intellectual Christian or artificial when you still fighting to be a Christian and when you battling that's what we call the old serpent in your heart you have to fight to live a Sanctified life when you come listen to the word that word cuts down it takes out the water that you have swallow every time you come listen to the word the world is coming out of you every time you listen to the word it's killing the black do because the prophet say that when you believe in the word God gives you two dog a white dog and a black dog when you do good things a white dog become bigger when you do evil the black dog get bigger depends on what type of dog you knish the most look how much how much time you spend on your phone look how much time you live you you spend your that's why the preacher struggling when they're preaching there's not people who cry because there's not enough sincerity there's not enough sincerity coming to church is a religious we come Sunday we come back on next Sunday we come back the next Sunday we come back the following Sunday it shouldn't be so there should have been a difference between those who knows God and those who don't know God there was supposed to be a difference because he said he said I will establish difference I'll put a difference between those who knows me and those who don't know me we need that difference Brothers the world is in the church and the church also is in the world what the world does that's what we want to do the world doesn't T to imitate us because we say that we are Christian we present a fake proof of Chris is that's why we in this condition when we were growing up type of Miss we go back home after chur I don't even greet nobody outside I go straight to my house and I lock myself in the room I start crying who can do such things once we leave here it's Instagram and some even in resp they can see a video while they they're in service but we claim that we are Christians we will respond one day each one we receive his retribution whom that Shall Believe baptized and be saved who that who whom who will not believe he will be condemned now I'm about to finish the five five identification precise I was preach in 1955 I forgot to put the year paragraph 90 he says you have to you have to witness upon him in John 1412 he gives us he gives us teaching what the church has to do in John 142 we're going to see what it says John 14 to read it to make it official you see very ver I say he that the works which I do shall shall he do also and shall he do great because I go to Father say that's a message of church Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever living in the church King of the church resurrected from dead yesterday today and forever fulfilling the same work doing the same works that Jesus did and that's the message of the church if the church is not teaching this then they teaching a a false theology the church is not doing the worst that Jesus did everything they teaching false theology that's why Jesus ordained them to preach what else how do we recognize people say I'm a Believer see what was the last commission he gave to his church for the Christian Mark Mark what was his last message to the [Music] church and we find out if we can uh execute his commission Mark 1614 and then he appeared to the 11 as they were at the table the prophet said here is the commission given to the church now listen the very last Commission we're going to examine ourselves see if we are believers or if we're just in this church or not and after he appeared to the as they L they lay at the table manifested reproached them with their unbelief see brothers and sisters the disciples they received the last Commission they represented the church and the church has to execute the commission that God and if we don't see those things happening in the church all we do is preaching a false theology we said that we in the truth but that truth doesn't matter it's going to be a false theology brothers and sisters I don't want to be guilty teaching a false theology but I need I need God give us even if he can give us just two or three which we can found found the church church so that that church can raise up invisible church if we are True Believer we're going to miss a places to put people here but if we see have empty seats that means something is not going brothers and sisters as the prophet said I don't go after to you but I'm going after sin if we cannot see things that the pro word of God promise being fulfilled in church that means there's something going on there's something going on each one of us do an examine himself and see where it didn't work well and to ask God we may stand want [Music] [Music] Comm [Music] [Music] [Music] go [Music] all [Music] B my FES be [Music] Roes [Music] J take [Music] oh [Music] for I ser
