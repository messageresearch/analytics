[40:09] everything that happened to him or in
[40:12] his life he was always late
[40:34] and he also released people from the

[42:55] mighty hand of god
[42:57] that he may exalt you in due time
[43:00] casting all your care upon him for his
[43:03] care for he cares for you
[43:06] be sober
[43:07] be vigilant because your adversary
[43:11] the devil walks about like a roaring
[43:14] lion seeking whom he may devour
[43:18] resist him
[43:20] steadfast in the faith knowing that the
[43:22] same suffering are
[43:24] experienced by your brother by a
[43:27] brotherhood in the world
[43:29] but may the god
[43:31] of all grace who call us to his eternal

[44:16] god and only god
[44:18] said come down lord hey
[44:24] and speak for your own glory
[44:26] jesus christ in the name of the lord
[44:28] jesus our god amen amen
[44:32] you may be seated
[44:34] javed to
[44:38] i'll entitle my little subject this
[44:40] morning
[44:45] it's over the promotion of devil
[44:48] no more promotion
[44:51] of devo or satan
[44:54] no more devil promotion yeah
[44:57] oh no more promoting satan
[45:00] hello
[45:14] [Music]
[45:23] who has called you in jesus christ to
[45:26] his eternal glory
[45:30] after you have suffered a while
[45:32] perfectionist
[45:34] is going to perfect you
[45:37] is going to strengthen you
[45:41] is going to fortify you
[46:02] and he's going to make it perfect for
[46:04] the day of christ
[46:07] it's for you to understand my brothers
[46:11] that is not a man who have called us
[46:16] not our father who is called us
[46:20] need our motto accord us to the word of
[46:22] god
[46:25] but he's god of all grace
[46:29] he's the one of god that's jesus christ
[46:33] not to something else
[46:36] but he has called us to the glory to the
[46:38] eternal glory
[47:21] and it's god who's going to strengthen
[47:23] us
[47:25] why did he say he's going to strengthen
[47:27] us
[47:30] what did he say is going to stress
[47:35] it's because we we may have some
[47:37] witnesses
[47:39] but when the weaknesses shall come
[47:42] just know one thing
[47:46] he has called us to the eternal glory i
[47:49] thank you remember so
[47:56] [Music]
[48:04] like for you to understand
[48:06] the second news i don't expect it that
[48:08] would be the basis on which you're going
[48:10] to be here
[48:12] and when if you are all watchful
[48:15] uh peter said
[48:20] after you have suffered a little while
[48:23] on the suffering
[48:25] we're not going to suffer every time and
[48:27] peter but just for a while
[48:31] second
[48:34] that's what peter said and it's what is
[48:36] written in the bible
[48:39] and if it's written in the bible
[48:41] it's the word of god
[48:43] and as it
[48:47] which is god has provided us to suffer a
[48:49] little while
[48:51] remember
[48:53] but it's only god who knows that little
[48:55] white suffering
[48:59] i can look at you and say you always
[49:02] say
[49:03] but for god it's just for a real one
[49:09] william said okay
[49:13] when christ was dying upon the cross
[49:18] and that's the day he overcome the sin
[49:20] killer
[49:21] he overcome sickness
[49:28] death and the
[49:37] we fighting with an enemy who's already
[49:39] overcome the chaplain approved the force
[49:41] the devil have got no strength in it
[49:46] he will have strength and power only the
[49:49] one that should be here
[49:51] but i want you to be watched for this
[49:53] one company
[49:56] for you to understand
[50:37] his death was the
[50:50] i would like you to say amen to that
[50:52] remain first that's
[51:05] instead of us or praising our
[51:09] advantage
[51:11] thank you we are there praising the
[51:13] enemy who's already overcome
[51:15] muammar
[51:17] oh my sickness
[51:20] i got
[52:07] after we have suffered a little while

[52:11] but himself the lord jesus christ

[52:30] yes my brothers and sisters i returned
[52:33] let us stop promoting the devil
[52:38] matthew sir my brothers and sisters

[52:47] in the preaching
[52:49] witnesses
[52:50] say
[52:51] program 37 satan secretly
[52:54] that's how the devil is coming
[52:58] [Music]
[52:59] he's gonna let you build a little bit of
[53:02] fear somewhere
[53:07] then it's going to increase that fear
[53:10] destruction is
[53:37] or losing the steps making somebody lose
[53:42] [Music]
[53:49] assurance
[53:50] by doing some act which is what's gonna
[53:53] bring him fear hello
[54:12] and it's going to start taking away or
[54:15] the assurance by telling you
[54:22] the umbrella i'm saying the reason is
[54:25] just because you let him do that
[54:29] never let the devil do that in you
[54:31] election is the emblem
[54:33] he's just a bluff
[54:36] and one legalized
[55:10] [Music]
[55:20] and god have taken the power to the
[55:22] church we manifest that yes my brothers
[55:24] and sisters

[56:40] certain enemies
[56:42] it's an enemy who's already overcome
[56:44] the grimace but he's just making some
[56:46] noise
