[36:42] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[36:43] to the ephesians

[37:00] a physio trade
[37:10] we'll read the 12th and the 13th verse
[37:13] [Music]
[37:16] and then we'll go to proverbs 3 19.
[37:35] beginning at the 12th first that at that
[37:37] time
[37:38] ye were without christ being aliens from
[37:41] the commonwealth of israel
[37:43] and strangers from the covenant of his
[37:45] promise
[37:46] having no hope and without god
[38:01] but now in christ jesus you who
[38:04] sometimes were far
[38:05] off are made nigh by the blood of christ
[38:11] [Music]
[38:15] one more scripture proverbs
[38:44] proverbs 3 19.
[38:51] the lord by wisdom have founded the
[38:54] earth
[39:10] we thank you for your grace and your
[39:12] mercy
[39:39] amen amen you may
[39:53] once again we thank god for being in
[39:55] being here
[40:00] we appreciate the lord jesus for all
[40:02] that he
[40:04] that he does for us
[40:08] jesus
[40:23] we have been dealing with the coming of
[40:26] the lord
[40:28] [Music]
[40:31] we have talked about the opening of the
[40:35] [Music]
[40:36] word
[40:39] we have been trying to get the people
[40:43] to think on a higher planet if
[40:52] we can get the people to
[40:55] see who they really are
[41:01] i believe that it will bring a
[41:04] translation
[41:09] you see when god comes along
[41:14] and began to deal with william branham
[41:33] [Music]
[41:47] from connection to what we call
[41:51] the skin does that belong the eighth day
[41:56] or the eighth dispensation
[42:00] disposal
[42:05] that when god began to give him
[42:09] the message of the hour
[42:14] i'm not talking about all of the
[42:15] preaching that he had done
[42:17] previously
[42:20] even though that word was excellent
[42:25] excellent god was moving into a
[42:27] different
[42:28] dispensation
[42:56] hallelujah
[43:09] messenger always comes at the end of the
[43:13] age
[43:16] so god was getting ready to do a
[43:18] different thing
[43:21] and he was beginning to move on the
[43:24] people yeah
[43:50] [Music]
[44:07] [Music]
[44:48] you see because of sin we will
[44:52] darken in our minds
[44:55] hallelujah why because we push god away
[45:00] hallelujah throughout the fall
[45:30] we ran
[45:42] and he was left
[45:58] of what
[46:09] [Music]
[46:11] until he became an inventor
[46:37] that we were so alienated
[46:42] that we were not part of god's commons
[46:45] wealth anymore
[46:49] hallelujah but thanks be to god my
[46:52] gospel through the blood of jesus christ
[46:55] shall the son of jesus christ god has
[46:57] brought us
[46:58] nigh jesus hallelujah
[47:03] listen we lived
[47:06] as beasts we lived as beasts and animals
[47:14] but we now have a position
[47:18] that we must come to recognize
[47:21] we must come to understand who we are
[47:26] maybe i need to aim in myself this
[47:28] morning
[47:31] [Laughter]
[47:34] we're in a place we're about
[47:41] [Music]
[48:03] is the bride of jesus christ
[48:06] hallelujah is that right let me say that
[48:10] again
[48:10] the mystery of this age
[48:13] is the pride of jesus christ
[48:17] hallelujah she's
[48:30] but she has always
[48:33] been enlightened
[48:36] hallelujah and we must come to recognize
[48:40] who we are
[48:44] brother branham said it like this the
[48:52] not only that she will recognize the age
[48:56] that she's living
[48:59] in other words she will come to know the
[49:02] day that she's living
[49:04] in what god has called her to do
[49:08] it hallelujah
[49:11] now the thing that we must fight
[49:23] [Music]
[49:28] is
[49:40] [Applause]
[49:42] because god chose you from the
[49:45] foundation of the world
[49:49] god is magnificent
[49:52] in his wisdom hallelujah
[49:56] he didn't have to have he needed no one
[49:59] to teach him
[50:02] hallelujah he planned everything himself
[50:07] hallelujah amen now you and i must
[50:10] understand
[50:23] because i want us to understand because
[50:27] we have totally been set free
[50:31] i'm talking about people with the holy
[50:33] ghost now
[50:35] i'm not talking about potential
[50:38] christians
[50:46] [Music]
[50:52] you're so
[51:07] amen nothing no one can break that seal
[51:10] personally you understand me
[51:14] your destiny is a sure
[51:17] thing 18 hallelujah
[51:21] for the bride of jesus christ you don't
[51:24] have the worry
[51:26] whether you're going to make it to
[51:27] heaven make it your values because
[51:29] you've already
[51:29] made it to heaven now here i come by
[51:33] god's grace
[51:36] we are now sitting sitting
[51:40] in heavenly places
[51:43] yesterday in christ jesus jesus
[51:47] how many of y'all believe that
[52:01] in other words god has switched
[52:05] change your habitation
[52:09] he's change a dimension on you
[52:13] hallelujah you're no longer stuck into
[52:16] this third
[52:17] [Music]
[52:24] [Music]
[52:27] hallelujah now we're not working with
[52:30] the flesh right
[52:41] but we know that the soul exists
[52:51] [Music]
[53:28] hallelujah behind the curtain of time
[53:32] and he said i saw you there
[53:38] and if you're going to believe one word
[53:40] of the prophet
[53:54] he came to
[54:05] [Music]
[54:08] oh
[54:14] [Music]
[54:18] and that's exactly what jesus came to
[54:20] tell us
[54:36] we
[54:40] [Music]
[54:59] [Music]
[55:43] [Applause]
[55:45] people make it like this he said the
[55:48] poor people's made it
[55:50] he said then i know my people gonna make
[55:53] it
[55:54] because i preached everything
[55:57] paul preached hallelujah
[56:10] why because that word was not given to
[56:14] power
[56:25] she can see the beginning
[56:31] [Music]
[56:43] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[56:45] blessings
[56:48] in christ now i want you to understand
[56:52] he said has blessed us all
[56:56] hallelujah
[57:03] [Music]
[57:09] if you want to see all your spiritual
[57:12] blessings
[57:13] you must stay in the heavenly place
[57:16] somebody help me here see if you stay
[57:19] under the blood
[57:21] hallelujah god will continue to bless
[57:24] you
[57:33] [Music]
[57:35] this is what you got to understand him
[57:52] all you could see was adam because
[57:55] eve was in adelaide
[57:59] so when you in christ that's all
[58:02] people can see is christ because
[58:10] [Music]
[58:23] [Music]
[58:33] because you can read this bible all day
[58:37] but if the anointing don't doesn't come
[58:39] and quicken it
[58:41] you won't understand being said
[58:45] sometimes we listen to brother branham
[59:01] spoke in parables
[59:04] [Applause]
[59:07] [Music]
[59:14] but if you in the spirit of the composer
[59:19] here if you're in the spirit of it
[59:22] you understand what is needed
[59:27] for that time hallelujah
[59:31] now the part i love about this yes
[59:34] because
[59:34] he chose us
[59:40] now if god chose you and i'll see if we
[59:42] understand what i'm saying like this
[59:44] you
[1:00:10] like i said the last time i was here
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:41] get present because serpents can't hear
[1:00:44] us
[1:00:50] they can only feel their way
[1:00:53] hallelujah that's right you ever seen
[1:00:57] you ever seen a serpent with ears
[1:01:01] hallelujah the same thing that got him
[1:01:04] in trouble
[1:01:06] it's the same thing that makes them feel
[1:01:07] their way
[1:01:22] but when we think about
[1:01:25] god jim we sometimes think
[1:01:30] he's far away if you think that god is
[1:01:34] far away
[1:01:36] you
[1:01:48] as a christian you have the wrong
[1:01:50] revelation of god
[1:01:54] because god cannot fail in his word
[1:02:02] i forsake you
[1:02:15] when does the bride ever go by her
[1:02:18] feelings
[1:02:30] the bible says the word is
[1:02:42] that is the word of faith is that right
[1:02:45] so if it's in your heart
[1:03:00] hallelujah
[1:03:15] but my question is to this morning
[1:03:18] do you love the lord
[1:03:22] now that might sound like a childish
[1:03:24] question
[1:03:27] but how can you love him
[1:03:32] [Music]
[1:04:04] [Music]
[1:04:06] amen you do not know god by your works
[1:04:10] somebody
[1:04:24] coming faithfully the church doesn't
[1:04:26] mean you know god
[1:04:30] hallelujah now let me tell you something
[1:04:34] years ago when i was in lima ohio
[1:04:49] and the parking lot would be full
[1:04:56] let us have six o'clock church he only
[1:04:59] glies
[1:04:59] the scissors you hear what i'm saying
[1:05:03] it's not that that makes you who you are
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:34] i act addicted
[1:05:38] you love the lord who's in minnesota i'm
[1:05:41] trying to get us to see something
[1:05:44] i have something else in my mind to
[1:05:45] minister
[1:05:47] today but the lord changed my mind
[1:05:51] this is what he wants see us to preach
[1:05:55] so if we could be spiritual minded this
[1:05:57] morning
[1:05:59] we'll understand what god is trying to
[1:06:01] tell us
[1:06:17] hallelujah each church is sovereign of
[1:06:20] itself
[1:06:24] hallelujah hallelujah i don't care if
[1:06:26] the next church over
[1:06:28] paint their building red
[1:06:34] [Music]
[1:06:45] the beauty of this assembly
[1:06:48] is the people in this assembly
[1:06:51] they sit on something see so
[1:06:54] you must understand that we cannot allow
[1:06:58] ourselves
[1:07:00] to fall into a systematic worship
[1:07:06] system because there are so many people
[1:07:10] who systematically worship yeah those
[1:07:13] systematic moments
[1:07:14] and they think that it's being accepted
[1:07:17] by god
[1:07:19] you're not being accepted by god i
[1:07:22] accept him about you
[1:07:24] hello if god accepted any system
[1:07:28] he said yeah he was happy except the
[1:07:30] catholic church
[1:07:34] hallelujah hallelujah but what you the
[1:07:37] thing is you
[1:07:38] must be born again
[1:07:54] think you've got the holy ghost
[1:07:57] clean living does not indicate it has no
[1:08:00] indication
[1:08:02] of you having the holy ghost
[1:08:08] jesus
[1:08:22] you don't have to push people to live
[1:08:25] right
[1:08:26] you don't have to drive them to live
[1:08:29] right it's that change of nature
[1:08:34] that makes them live right
[1:09:04] accepted
[1:09:07] by the other churches hallelujah
[1:09:12] y'all understand me sounds like a vastly
[1:09:15] such as sorry some black situation
[1:09:46] yes it scares me
[1:09:49] yes i mean i came out of a strict
[1:09:54] pentecostal church you see venice
[1:09:58] and everybody mostly everybody
[1:10:02] dressed appropriately
[1:10:08] you just couldn't come in the church
[1:10:09] looking any kind of way
[1:10:12] [Music]
[1:10:14] and we thought that was the holy ghost
[1:10:20] you gotta understand me because we look
[1:10:23] like we had it
[1:10:27] hallelujah and
[1:10:44] especially if you encourage your bible
[1:10:46] especially
[1:10:48] what about hallelujah but we know now
[1:10:51] that there are many of them who just
[1:10:54] don't have the holy ghost you know about
[1:10:56] the
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:11:07] because something inside says
[1:11:37] a certain way
[1:11:45] the ones that consider themselves
[1:11:46] christians they don't dress any kind of
[1:11:49] way
[1:11:49] about the 60 seconds
[1:11:52] let me show you where i'm getting my
[1:11:54] thought from and i don't know how come i
[1:11:55] got on this thing
[1:11:56] reverse decision how many of y'all
[1:11:59] remember brother
[1:12:00] talk about the preview of the bride
[1:12:05] and you heard how he described her dress
[1:12:11] preview of the bride
[1:12:14] you understand what that word is it's a
[1:12:17] movie it's a view of the bride
[1:12:20] but it's a tree
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:34] and
[1:12:46] dress like division
[1:13:30] we get
[1:13:45] [Music]
[1:14:15] then paul stood in the midst of mars
[1:14:18] hill
[1:14:19] and said you men of athens i perceive
[1:14:23] that in all things you are too
[1:14:26] superstitious
[1:14:30] [Music]
[1:14:37] [Music]
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:14:52] [Music]
[1:14:54] if you feel like a if a cat runs across
[1:14:56] your trail you know
[1:14:58] you gotta throw salt right you know how
[1:14:59] people do it
[1:15:06] yeah i had a sister who was
[1:15:08] superstitious
[1:15:34] a question was asked and i've read this
[1:15:37] not even knowing i was going to confront
[1:15:39] this
[1:15:39] release it doesn't matter what kind of a
[1:15:43] gift a person he has sunday
[1:15:50] victory
[1:15:57] because their dream doesn't mean it came
[1:15:59] from god
[1:16:03] and seeing we don't have a real
[1:16:05] interpreter of the dream
[1:16:12] it's a dream i had a dream you broke
[1:16:18] anywhere
[1:16:20] not taking away the dreamers because we
[1:16:23] have dreamers
[1:16:26] proving themselves if their dreams have
[1:16:28] been accurate they are true gifts
[1:17:14] shoes that they shouldn't have to worry
[1:17:16] about the shoes
[1:17:18] and kittens let me move on that
[1:17:19] superstition
[1:17:21] for as i passed by and beheld your
[1:17:24] devotion
[1:17:26] i found an altar with this inscription
[1:17:29] to the unknown god whom therefore ye
[1:17:32] ignorantly worship him declare i unto
[1:17:35] you
[1:17:42] and these
[1:18:20] thinking that the statue was was the
[1:18:22] thing that was keeping him away from
[1:18:24] being destroyed
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:38] there's only one deliverer sermon said
[1:18:41] delivery hallelujah
[1:18:43] amen amen amen amen
[1:18:46] now let's move on by god's grace because
[1:18:48] i'm trying to get to something
[1:18:49] like i said god that made the world
[1:18:54] and all the things therein seeing that
[1:18:58] he is the lord of heaven and earth
[1:19:00] dwelleth not in temples made with hands
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:34] but if there is a blessing laying on the
[1:19:37] clock
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:46] it's like when the man was thrown into
[1:19:48] elijah's
[1:20:03] so you got to understand these things
[1:20:06] that people are so
[1:20:07] superstitious you know i was telling
[1:20:09] somebody and i don't know what it is i
[1:20:11] guess so many people you know
[1:20:12] they've seen what witches do and music
[1:20:14] warlocks do it
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:42] and truth always defeat lies
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:57] you're not in some church age
[1:21:03] i hope you're not giving it
[1:21:06] in babylon cage of every unclean and
[1:21:10] hateful birds
[1:21:26] you must
[1:21:35] god wants us to live within his reach
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:54] hallelujah
[1:21:56] you know people are bewitched
[1:22:00] your works are going to get you to
[1:22:02] heaven
[1:22:06] because what makes us do what we do
[1:22:19] now i can't read all this but the point
[1:22:22] i wanted to
[1:22:31] for in him we live
[1:22:36] twenty
[1:23:02] we ought not to think that the godhead
[1:23:04] is like
[1:23:05] to go
[1:23:11] we've always seen the godhead as being
[1:23:13] father son in the holy ghost
[1:23:18] but you gotta understand understand
[1:23:20] that's not all of god
[1:23:22] something about you god consists of more
[1:23:26] than just being a father son in the holy
[1:23:32] spirit
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:29] you know i see that y'all tired so i
[1:24:30] don't want to drag it too long but this
[1:24:32] one

[1:24:35] where i'm going
[1:24:38] when it came and i love esther because i
[1:24:40] have to tell the whole story

[1:25:06] you see what was happening here he was
[1:25:10] positionally placed in
[1:25:11] esther where esther belong
[1:25:15] where who is that now esther
[1:25:19] has become joint heirs with the king
[1:25:24] he understands
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:35] he will cause us to sit in his
[1:26:07] to dwell in the truth
[1:26:11] the throne of heaven came down to earth
[1:26:17] and now it was god walking in human
[1:26:20] flesh
[1:26:31] this is what brother brandon was trying
[1:26:33] to get us to see
[1:26:37] [Applause]

[1:26:51] heavenly places

[1:29:02] their bodies
[1:29:07] they couldn't do it
[1:29:09] [Music]
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:23] you know the thing is if you don't
[1:29:26] understand godhood and godhead
[1:29:28] you know let me ask you then
[1:29:32] let's move on when god was god
[1:29:37] lost you or even before he was god
[1:29:41] memorable where were you
[1:29:48] and if you were a attribute
[1:29:52] was the attribute uh in him that was to
[1:29:55] be expressed
[1:30:01] you just didn't become queen of heaven
[1:30:40] [Music]
[1:30:45] he said jesus
[1:31:05] [Music]
[1:31:09] god began to change the dispensation
[1:31:12] [Music]
[1:31:41] you think god was just suspending
[1:31:43] himself in in mid-air
[1:31:47] there was a purpose
[1:31:51] you understand me there was a people
[1:31:54] yeah
[1:31:54] the bet would recognize
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:10] hallelujah
[1:32:24] when the world didn't know what it was
[1:32:28] he told the rebecca of this day
[1:32:32] that's my lord y'all understand me let's
[1:32:36] give him a compliment so
[1:32:37] if he's lord see watch this watch the
[1:32:40] scene
[1:32:42] because the next move is becca going
[1:32:46] into
[1:32:46] isaac's tent
[1:32:51] and becoming pregnant
[1:33:20] you must fall in love with this message

[1:33:48] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:33:50] blood
[1:33:52] the forgiveness of sin according to the
[1:33:54] riches of his grace
[1:34:16] in all wisdom and prudence having made
[1:34:19] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:34:23] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:34:26] have
[1:34:26] purposed in himself that in the
[1:34:29] dispensation of the fullness of time
[1:34:32] he might gather together in one all
[1:34:35] things
[1:34:35] in christ not around him not above him
[1:34:42] both which are in heaven the dead
[1:34:51] in whom also we have obtained
[1:34:55] an inheritance
[1:35:24] he said we are him in this world
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:36:08] when you receive
[1:36:20] laughed in the face of death
[1:36:50] diabetes
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:37:02] we were here
[1:37:16] itself above the word of god
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:42] every demon is subject to the world
[1:38:11] and it came only and it can only be
[1:38:15] the manifestation of the fulfilling
[1:38:18] of all the revelations
[1:38:26] any any others have spoke of the bride
[1:38:39] if it doesn't if it does something
[1:38:42] different from the groom
[1:38:46] it isn't the bride
[1:38:49] hello hello because she is flesh of his
[1:38:52] flesh
[1:38:53] of this bone of his bone us this is his
[1:38:57] life
[1:38:58] power of his power she
[1:39:02] is him and let me understand that let's
[1:39:05] give him a comment
[1:39:06] she is him and see a little jesus christ
[1:39:09] never ran from
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:22] because it was not yet time for him to
[1:39:23] be crucified
[1:39:39] heaven is not fought
[1:39:43] right right because you know in the old
[1:39:46] school denomination
[1:39:48] we thought heaven was millions and
[1:39:49] zillions of miles away
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:40:00] [Music]
[1:40:34] uh
[1:40:47] but when you die and go to hell you do
[1:40:49] not go to the lake of fire
[1:40:55] and we thought that hell was eternal
[1:41:02] and hell is not
[1:41:05] [Music]
[1:41:16] [Music]
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:40] [Music]
[1:41:43] why did god come to tell us
[1:41:46] hallelujah hallelujah what what did god
[1:41:49] do
[1:41:50] jeffy he took a man
[1:41:55] and he made him time travel
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:08] [Music]
[1:42:25] but he said it was a different world
[1:42:28] somebody helped me here you know what he
[1:42:31] said
[1:42:32] he said those people had no sex claims
[1:42:39] you know everybody should say hallelujah
[1:42:45] y'all know most of your trouble comes
[1:42:46] from the sex clan
[1:42:49] hallelujah just think about it no more
[1:42:52] no more no more no more
[1:43:05] you can't have a little faith to believe
[1:43:07] that you were dead
[1:43:19] i don't know why i believe that but i
[1:43:22] believe that
[1:43:23] with all of my heart hallelujah
[1:43:26] a dimension away in dimension
[1:43:31] think about it consciousness and these
[1:43:33] dimensions did not always exist the way
[1:43:36] they do
[1:43:37] [Music]
[1:44:16] we ought to be seeing more supernatural
[1:44:25] [Music]
[1:44:32] you know what
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:43] by the name of jesus cast out them under
[1:44:46] jesus
[1:45:15] has always been amanda
[1:45:20] paul says he moves through us all
[1:45:24] in him we live in him we move
[1:45:28] on
[1:45:31] [Music]
[1:45:56] so in in essence we must begin to think
[1:46:00] like god
[1:46:04] let's put it we must begin to think like
[1:46:10] rulers
[1:46:38] for a long time
[1:46:48] [Music]
[1:46:52] but it means that he's the prince in
[1:46:53] power of that dimension
[1:46:55] of the air the spiritual dimension
[1:46:59] that you can't see
[1:47:04] but jesus rent the veil
[1:47:08] jesus
[1:47:13] hallelujah he destroyed everything
[1:47:17] coming up
[1:47:20] from hell all the way
[1:47:23] and from heaven all the way
[1:47:27] he destroyed everything the devil
