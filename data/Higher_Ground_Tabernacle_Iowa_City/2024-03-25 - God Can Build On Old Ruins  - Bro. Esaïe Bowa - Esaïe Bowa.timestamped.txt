[1:20:33] grace and Abraham didn't do
[1:20:36] any for God to
[1:20:38] read so that God can
[1:20:41] choose because he was a

[1:29:30] child because his
[1:29:32] faith didn't
[1:29:35] fail and his faith didn't
[1:29:40] fail and the prophet said
[1:29:43] somewhere he said God revealed himself
[1:29:45] in AB

[1:29:52] has because when ABR was
[1:29:55] TI he had to

[1:30:39] to so you can get
[1:30:43] strength now I want to speak about
[1:30:45] Joseph and
[1:30:47] Joseph
[1:30:52] know wrote down Joseph's
[1:30:58] story in a way that even his
[1:31:02] brothers even his brother couldn't stop
[1:31:06] Jose to live how how God wanted
[1:31:12] to Joseph was the
[1:31:15] blessing he was the son of
[1:31:17] prosperity the Bible
[1:31:21] say when jaob Jacob was saying
[1:31:26] blessings all his children Genesis
[1:31:29] 49 the Bible
[1:31:33] says because it was before the death of
[1:31:38] Jacob and he has to tell blessing on his
[1:31:44] children we will focus on Joseph's
[1:31:48] blessing chap in Genesis
[1:31:52] chapter 22-
[1:31:57] 26 Jacob start
[1:32:00] telling blessing upon
[1:32:03] Jose and you know what happened in
[1:32:05] Joseph's
[1:32:07] life
[1:32:09] without nothing he has been hated by
[1:32:12] brother he did not do
[1:32:15] anything just because his brother was
[1:32:17] jealous on
[1:32:18] him because of
[1:32:20] that they sold Joseph
[1:32:24] who was their
[1:32:25] blessing they sold out
[1:32:28] Jose they lied to their
[1:32:31] father that be found him and killed
[1:32:34] him you know the
[1:32:38] story his brother here in
[1:32:43] Egypt Joseph is already
[1:32:45] Governor where he's the first
[1:32:49] Minister
[1:32:52] now the the the the the the hate of his
[1:32:55] brother just helped
[1:32:59] Joseph to get to that throne
[1:33:02] in if Joseph was not
[1:33:05] hating he couldn't get to
[1:33:08] Egypt that's why certain
[1:33:11] circumstances happen in your
[1:33:14] life and sometimes we think it's
[1:33:17] curs but it's a
[1:33:20] way that takes us that leads us to our
[1:33:25] takes us to our
[1:33:27] elevation that's
[1:33:30] why we should not complain all the
[1:33:33] time a Christian is not
[1:33:37] complain a Christian is not somebody
[1:33:39] that compl a
[1:33:42] Christian lives by
[1:33:45] faith and I said the other
[1:33:47] day that faith is the
[1:33:50] boss let's read what the prophet
[1:33:54] faith is the boss it says
[1:33:58] this he say show me a little small
[1:34:05] church I saved it for you so I can read
[1:34:07] it for
[1:34:09] you he
[1:34:22] says
[1:34:25] faith comes by what we
[1:34:29] hear preaching
[1:34:32] 1954 and the prophet of God
[1:34:35] says because faith is the
[1:34:40] boss he says show me a old small
[1:34:45] church that's afraid to put his trust in
[1:34:50] God or a
[1:34:52] family
[1:34:57] let the spirit of God uh touch
[1:35:00] that that
[1:35:02] person or that
[1:35:05] church and just observe what's happening
[1:35:08] what's going to happen he says

[1:35:41] boss everything
[1:35:43] else runs
[1:35:47] away no matter what anybody
[1:35:51] says the word of God is
[1:35:54] Eternal and that's
[1:35:57] true faith is
[1:36:00] the and Joseph used to live by fa that's
[1:36:04] why every
[1:36:07] circumstance that would come in Joseph's
[1:36:10] life he was not
[1:36:13] worried it's true it could hurt
[1:36:16] you but
[1:36:19] Joseph everything is for the good of who
[1:36:22] loves God
[1:36:25] Joseph was not
[1:36:26] worried he lived by
[1:36:29] faith in a point that he could see that
[1:36:32] every
[1:36:34] condition was good for him to to
[1:36:39] succeed that's
