[47:47] first thing we're going about
[47:49] that jobs end and and
[47:51] sanctify them
[47:53] and rose up early in the morning

[47:56] bain offering according to the number of
[47:59] them all
[48:13] for job said it may it may be that my
[48:16] sons have seen and
[48:18] and cursed god in their hearts
[48:21] does the job continually
[48:27] presented
[48:32] to now there was a day when the sons of
[48:36] god came to present themselves before
[48:38] the lord
[48:40] and satan came also among them
[48:45] [Music]
[48:51] lord said unto satan
[48:54] one way
[48:56] come as thee
[48:57] then satan answered the lord and said
[49:01] from going to
[49:06] from going to and from
[49:09] in the earth and from walking up
[49:12] and down in it
[49:16] [Music]
[49:30] and the lord said unto satan
[49:32] is thou considered my seventh job
[49:35] that there is none like him in the earth
[49:38] a perfect and
[49:40] an upright man
[49:42] one that of god
[49:44] and
[49:45] oh
[49:48] please listen
[49:53] may god add the blessing to the world
[49:59] [Music]
[50:25] lord you've broken this bread of life
[50:27] for us this morning
[50:33] may we may may we eat this bread and
[50:35] have life that is inna
[51:06] we want
[51:33] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[51:37] we want you to take over the preachers
[51:41] and also they will interpret the lord
[51:45] may the ears that are gonna listen to
[51:46] this
[51:48] may
[52:14] you may be seated
[52:31] that we're going to entitle have you
[52:33] seen my main on the earth
[52:39] i've taken that from
[52:41] us
[52:43] where god is telling satan if you
[52:45] considered my seventh job
[52:48] inaudible there is none like him on the
[52:51] earth
[52:53] it's an upright man kenyan
[52:57] hearing god and avoiding the evil hello
[53:01] feb
[53:02] says
[53:05] i believe you believe in william branham
[53:10] because brother says
[53:12] [Music]
[53:22] [Music]
[53:27] i don't have a special message this
[53:29] morning
[53:34] remember i'm just coming to tell you
[53:36] what brother himself have said masculine
[53:38] message
[53:42] because the message is not for the man
[53:44] but there's a message of god that he
[53:46] gave a man and now february and branham
[53:49] said
[53:52] where we read with you
[53:54] in the book of job
[54:09] themselves before god developed they
[54:11] came before god
[54:17] i'm saying it wasn't like a natural
[54:19] children like this but it was angels
[54:21] that came before god
[54:57] which means even here on earth the devil
[55:00] can have access to whatever
[55:07] because in heaven where it's really holy
[55:10] the devil had an access to
[55:15] and that was not the first time that the
[55:17] devil had access to the leave of the
[55:18] earth
[55:46] to introduce
[55:53] [Music]
[55:59] so that he can go and he can go die over
[56:02] there
[56:03] nsp
[56:07] spirit came before god
[56:13] presented
[56:17] you understand that the devil can
[56:19] present himself in the meaning where god
[56:21] is with this angel
[56:25] and if the satan can be in heaven where
[56:28] is
[56:49] [Music]
[57:10] confident job
[57:14] that's why he said unto satan
[57:18] if you consider my servant job no
[57:20] connection
[57:22] and we know all this story of job
[57:33] [Music]
[57:39] a trusted
[57:41] job
[57:42] job
[57:43] where we compare job and moses
[57:49] god had more trust in job than he had in
[57:52] moses forever
[57:55] [Music]
[58:05] you never give that gift of divine
[58:07] healing
[58:11] but he put that upon the serpent upon
[58:14] the the
[58:16] the serpent
[58:20] the children of god in the in the in the
[58:22] wilderness
[58:25] or the program 37.
[58:31] he said god have
[58:33] brought down the gift of healing to his
[58:35] children
[58:48] maybe never found somebody in
[58:50] whom he can place that gift of healing
[58:55] but he placed that gift of healing upon
[58:58] the serpent
[59:01] just a pre a piece of
[59:03] a breast serpent
[59:04] [Music]
[59:10] it's the same thing but in another form
[59:12] today
[59:14] now listen my brother and sisters
[59:31] as his wife was telling him
[59:35] regardless of the situation in which he
[59:37] found himself
[59:40] job never kissed god inaudible
[59:46] he stayed stood stick to god
[59:49] mcnamara sir now my brothers
[59:55] living in the last days
[1:00:28] the devil will come to you in different
[1:00:30] forms with different speeches
[1:00:33] [Music]
[1:00:39] he said the devil is our the most enemy
[1:00:45] first enemy of our god our master
[1:00:51] and he should stay our enemy forever
[1:01:09] completion of this school with different
[1:01:11] speeches
[1:01:12] just to discourage
[1:01:15] just to fight you just
[1:01:19] until the day until or until we all died
[1:01:33] [Music]
[1:01:39] those who will never curse god are cause
[1:01:42] they are suffering because of the
[1:01:43] suffering across the condition because
[1:01:45] of the condition
[1:01:47] of the problem because of the problems
[1:01:48] across the malaria because of the
[1:01:50] sicknesses
[1:01:58] that's what our little subject is if you
[1:02:00] consider my man upon the earth there's
[1:02:02] so much memories
[1:02:04] a people that even if they never eat
[1:02:06] just can you see la i know here
[1:02:11] somebody can say i don't want to eat
[1:02:13] because he doesn't want to eat me
[1:02:15] it's not the case in other places
[1:02:18] or other places where we're coming from
[1:02:21] there
[1:02:24] talking through the lines and people
[1:02:25] understand what i'm talking about
[1:02:29] so god needs such a people
[1:02:33] whether they are married or not can you
[1:02:35] present available they may be working or
[1:02:38] not making perfect fair confidence unto
[1:02:41] you but those who can put their trust
[1:02:43] in my confidence and god can have such
[1:02:46] trust in them we may face themselves yes
[1:02:48] my brothers and sisters
[1:02:51] we're living in this country
[1:02:54] where there is such a corruption
[1:02:57] homosexuality
[1:02:59] where we can see homosexuals and all
[1:03:00] this stuff
[1:03:03] they are demon in all kind of forms
[1:03:08] that are deceiving people
[1:03:10] that are uh
[1:03:12] or
[1:03:14] that are impressive or uh treating
[1:03:16] people may just have a new young people
[1:03:20] but god knew that we were going to live
[1:03:22] in
[1:03:23] the corner
[1:03:27] god need all the pressure that we should
[1:03:29] have in these days
[1:03:32] that's why before the devil comes
[1:03:34] precipitation
[1:03:36] god has sent his angels upon thee
[1:03:40] message of redemption
[1:03:42] is
[1:03:57] so that the seed of god may grow in them
[1:03:59] in these days we may fail themselves yes
[1:04:01] my sisters
[1:04:04] that's why we're living with you in this

[1:17:14] make him
[1:17:41] without
[1:17:43] making any essentials
[1:17:50] and those things were happening in the
[1:17:52] harmony
[1:17:53] simplicity absolutely in the simplicity
[1:17:56] absolute simplicity
[1:18:23] they think that god was focused
[1:18:26] it was you the people of the last time
[1:18:28] requirement
[1:18:30] the believers of the last days
[1:18:32] [Music]

[1:25:32] i'm saying
[1:25:37] a man of love
[1:25:53] tell you that's a national person to
[1:25:54] commence a worker you start fearing
[1:26:01] you didn't understand the importance of
[1:26:02] the message that you've received
[1:27:28] [Music]
[1:27:29] moses for him to create flies
[1:27:32] and everything that you have done
[1:27:36] just open up the candle of time
[1:27:44] and you have seen a little man in the
[1:27:46] bush of colorado
[1:27:50] and the men who could stand before them
[1:27:53] or before they brought the prince
[1:27:56] he said your presence is
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:31] moses was under the sacrifice of animals
[1:28:35] [Music]
[1:28:36] he only created flies
[1:28:39] and
[1:28:40] some other insects they show they can
[1:28:42] usually pop up
[1:28:43] things that are not even nice to see
[1:28:46] i said in your show but in this last
[1:28:48] days
[1:28:50] somebody can create
[1:28:52] amazon and they can eat them
[1:29:18] [Music]
[1:30:05] down and why
[1:30:08] we have already saved their confidence
[1:30:11] they trust men they trust
[1:30:15] their confusion we should also a
[1:30:17] confident man
[1:30:31] like the stars foreign
[1:31:25] we've got a courage to come to church
[1:31:27] every day
[1:31:28] to sing
[1:32:17] and god has made us a a great uh
[1:32:20] the richest nation upon the earth
[1:33:30] something that's going to help you to do
[1:33:32] whatever you want to
[1:33:35] and sir our brothers and sisters look
[1:33:37] before
[1:33:38] advocating you are we living in the days
[1:33:41] of the prophets
[1:33:43] that other prophets have seen before
[1:33:46] paulie died
[1:33:49] 12 in
[1:33:49] this paul is saying in one corinthians
[1:33:52] or chapter three
[1:33:55] if we can see
[1:33:57] they can
[1:33:58] project it in english
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:34:15] then we shall discover something
[1:34:21] according to the grace of god that is
[1:34:23] given to me
[1:34:28] i lay the foundation like a wise man
[1:34:45] wise architect missing a purple keyboard
[1:34:47] but it's not paul whose building
[1:34:53] and another one going to build upon it
[1:34:56] paulie apostle phantom paul just laid
[1:34:58] the foundation
[1:35:20] so that another can come and build upon
[1:35:23] the foundation polity and pulses
[1:35:30] but pay attention to the way that you're
[1:35:32] building upon the foundation for
[1:35:34] comprehension you understand that
[1:35:38] paul doesn't talk about jesus
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:56] so you may pay attention to the way that
[1:35:58] you're building upon the foundation
[1:35:59] meant to know but now
[1:36:01] hello and uncle
[1:36:03] let us read in english
[1:36:04] according to the grace of god which is
[1:36:07] given unto me
[1:36:09] as a wise master builder i have led the
[1:36:13] foundation
[1:36:18] i just want you to see right there
[1:36:22] that it was a wise architect
[1:36:28] he said another one should build upon it
[1:36:33] and the one who is going to build up
[1:36:44] a wise
[1:36:46] wise
[1:36:48] master builder
[1:37:24] that it should be also a wise master
[1:37:26] builder
[1:37:29] that's what branham said i know
[1:37:32] in every
[1:37:39] i never preached the message to people
[1:37:41] to make them follow me
[1:37:44] or to make them attached to
[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:27] between god and his people
[1:38:32] a true wish relation
[1:38:37] people becomes new creations in jesus
[1:38:40] christ example the son of spirit filled
[1:38:42] with his spirit
[1:38:44] living according to his word
[1:38:48] that's the thing to watch
[1:38:51] the message that we've received
[1:39:11] complete the sunny spirit filled with
[1:39:12] this spirit
[1:39:15] acting according to his word
[1:39:20] where you want to go
[1:39:22] and pray
[1:39:23] can you enter there in the name of the
[1:39:25] lord jesus
[1:39:28] where you want to go let's get to you

[1:39:55] so look at the work of the second
[1:39:57] quantity and what they are saying
[1:40:02] what creation of that time is
[1:40:04] and what we are today
[1:40:20] [Music]
[1:40:32] it's only when they give you the holy
[1:40:35] the confidence then you are a confident
[1:40:37] man
[1:40:39] you should be a confident wife of god
[1:40:44] what i'm saying
[1:40:45] downtown believe us
[1:40:48] of that time
[1:41:42] have you been baptized with the holy
[1:41:43] ghost
[1:41:59] somebody's getting upset
[1:42:01] no
[1:42:02] certain questions

[1:42:09] asked from you
[1:42:10] my friend my brother
[1:42:15] have you been baptized with the holy
[1:42:17] ghost since you've been baptized or

[1:44:10] is the least thing that we can pay
[1:44:12] attention to
