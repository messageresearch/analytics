stand we're going to ask that you turn with us to the ephesians ephesians two twelve and thirteen a physio trade we'll read the 12th and the 13th verse [Music] and then we'll go to proverbs 3 19. beginning at the 12th first that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenant of his promise having no hope and without god but now in christ jesus you who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ [Music] one more scripture proverbs proverbs 3 19. the lord by wisdom have founded the earth we thank you for your grace and your mercy amen amen you may once again we thank god for being in being here we appreciate the lord jesus for all that he that he does for us jesus we have been dealing with the coming of the lord [Music] we have talked about the opening of the [Music] word we have been trying to get the people to think on a higher planet if we can get the people to see who they really are i believe that it will bring a translation you see when god comes along and began to deal with william branham [Music] from connection to what we call the skin does that belong the eighth day or the eighth dispensation disposal that when god began to give him the message of the hour i'm not talking about all of the preaching that he had done previously even though that word was excellent excellent god was moving into a different dispensation hallelujah messenger always comes at the end of the age so god was getting ready to do a different thing and he was beginning to move on the people yeah [Music] [Music] you see because of sin we will darken in our minds hallelujah why because we push god away hallelujah throughout the fall we ran and he was left of what [Music] until he became an inventor that we were so alienated that we were not part of god's commons wealth anymore hallelujah but thanks be to god my gospel through the blood of jesus christ shall the son of jesus christ god has brought us nigh jesus hallelujah listen we lived as beasts we lived as beasts and animals but we now have a position that we must come to recognize we must come to understand who we are maybe i need to aim in myself this morning [Laughter] we're in a place we're about [Music] is the bride of jesus christ hallelujah is that right let me say that again the mystery of this age is the pride of jesus christ hallelujah she's but she has always been enlightened hallelujah and we must come to recognize who we are brother branham said it like this the not only that she will recognize the age that she's living in other words she will come to know the day that she's living in what god has called her to do it hallelujah now the thing that we must fight [Music] is [Applause] because god chose you from the foundation of the world god is magnificent in his wisdom hallelujah he didn't have to have he needed no one to teach him hallelujah he planned everything himself hallelujah amen now you and i must understand because i want us to understand because we have totally been set free i'm talking about people with the holy ghost now i'm not talking about potential christians [Music] you're so amen nothing no one can break that seal personally you understand me your destiny is a sure thing 18 hallelujah for the bride of jesus christ you don't have the worry whether you're going to make it to heaven make it your values because you've already made it to heaven now here i come by god's grace we are now sitting sitting in heavenly places yesterday in christ jesus jesus how many of y'all believe that in other words god has switched change your habitation he's change a dimension on you hallelujah you're no longer stuck into this third [Music] [Music] hallelujah now we're not working with the flesh right but we know that the soul exists [Music] hallelujah behind the curtain of time and he said i saw you there and if you're going to believe one word of the prophet he came to [Music] oh [Music] and that's exactly what jesus came to tell us we [Music] [Music] [Applause] people make it like this he said the poor people's made it he said then i know my people gonna make it because i preached everything paul preached hallelujah why because that word was not given to power she can see the beginning [Music] who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in christ now i want you to understand he said has blessed us all hallelujah [Music] if you want to see all your spiritual blessings you must stay in the heavenly place somebody help me here see if you stay under the blood hallelujah god will continue to bless you [Music] this is what you got to understand him all you could see was adam because eve was in adelaide so when you in christ that's all people can see is christ because [Music] [Music] because you can read this bible all day but if the anointing don't doesn't come and quicken it you won't understand being said sometimes we listen to brother branham spoke in parables [Applause] [Music] but if you in the spirit of the composer here if you're in the spirit of it you understand what is needed for that time hallelujah now the part i love about this yes because he chose us now if god chose you and i'll see if we understand what i'm saying like this you like i said the last time i was here [Music] get present because serpents can't hear us they can only feel their way hallelujah that's right you ever seen you ever seen a serpent with ears hallelujah the same thing that got him in trouble it's the same thing that makes them feel their way but when we think about god jim we sometimes think he's far away if you think that god is far away you as a christian you have the wrong revelation of god because god cannot fail in his word i forsake you when does the bride ever go by her feelings the bible says the word is that is the word of faith is that right so if it's in your heart hallelujah but my question is to this morning do you love the lord now that might sound like a childish question but how can you love him [Music] [Music] amen you do not know god by your works somebody coming faithfully the church doesn't mean you know god hallelujah now let me tell you something years ago when i was in lima ohio and the parking lot would be full let us have six o'clock church he only glies the scissors you hear what i'm saying it's not that that makes you who you are [Music] i act addicted you love the lord who's in minnesota i'm trying to get us to see something i have something else in my mind to minister today but the lord changed my mind this is what he wants see us to preach so if we could be spiritual minded this morning we'll understand what god is trying to tell us hallelujah each church is sovereign of itself hallelujah hallelujah i don't care if the next church over paint their building red [Music] the beauty of this assembly is the people in this assembly they sit on something see so you must understand that we cannot allow ourselves to fall into a systematic worship system because there are so many people who systematically worship yeah those systematic moments and they think that it's being accepted by god you're not being accepted by god i accept him about you hello if god accepted any system he said yeah he was happy except the catholic church hallelujah hallelujah but what you the thing is you must be born again think you've got the holy ghost clean living does not indicate it has no indication of you having the holy ghost jesus you don't have to push people to live right you don't have to drive them to live right it's that change of nature that makes them live right accepted by the other churches hallelujah y'all understand me sounds like a vastly such as sorry some black situation yes it scares me yes i mean i came out of a strict pentecostal church you see venice and everybody mostly everybody dressed appropriately you just couldn't come in the church looking any kind of way [Music] and we thought that was the holy ghost you gotta understand me because we look like we had it hallelujah and especially if you encourage your bible especially what about hallelujah but we know now that there are many of them who just don't have the holy ghost you know about the [Music] because something inside says a certain way the ones that consider themselves christians they don't dress any kind of way about the 60 seconds let me show you where i'm getting my thought from and i don't know how come i got on this thing reverse decision how many of y'all remember brother talk about the preview of the bride and you heard how he described her dress preview of the bride you understand what that word is it's a movie it's a view of the bride but it's a tree [Music] and dress like division we get [Music] then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said you men of athens i perceive that in all things you are too superstitious [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if you feel like a if a cat runs across your trail you know you gotta throw salt right you know how people do it yeah i had a sister who was superstitious a question was asked and i've read this not even knowing i was going to confront this release it doesn't matter what kind of a gift a person he has sunday victory because their dream doesn't mean it came from god and seeing we don't have a real interpreter of the dream it's a dream i had a dream you broke anywhere not taking away the dreamers because we have dreamers proving themselves if their dreams have been accurate they are true gifts shoes that they shouldn't have to worry about the shoes and kittens let me move on that superstition for as i passed by and beheld your devotion i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you and these thinking that the statue was was the thing that was keeping him away from being destroyed [Music] there's only one deliverer sermon said delivery hallelujah amen amen amen amen now let's move on by god's grace because i'm trying to get to something like i said god that made the world and all the things therein seeing that he is the lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands [Music] but if there is a blessing laying on the clock [Music] it's like when the man was thrown into elijah's so you got to understand these things that people are so superstitious you know i was telling somebody and i don't know what it is i guess so many people you know they've seen what witches do and music warlocks do it [Music] and truth always defeat lies [Music] you're not in some church age i hope you're not giving it in babylon cage of every unclean and hateful birds you must god wants us to live within his reach [Music] [Music] hallelujah you know people are bewitched your works are going to get you to heaven because what makes us do what we do now i can't read all this but the point i wanted to for in him we live twenty we ought not to think that the godhead is like to go we've always seen the godhead as being father son in the holy ghost but you gotta understand understand that's not all of god something about you god consists of more than just being a father son in the holy spirit [Music] [Music] you know i see that y'all tired so i don't want to drag it too long but this one let me let me let me see it like this where i'm going when it came and i love esther because i have to tell the whole story about the toothpaste what would you have of me i could i'll give you half of the kingdom you see what was happening here he was positionally placed in esther where esther belong where who is that now esther has become joint heirs with the king he understands [Music] he will cause us to sit in his to dwell in the truth the throne of heaven came down to earth and now it was god walking in human flesh this is what brother brandon was trying to get us to see [Applause] what are you saying you're setting in heavenly places in christ jesus jesus hallelujah and christ jesus is standing in heavenly places in you hallelujah and when we and it shall be given to you anything and everything you choose hallelujah what we need to do is understand our opposition in christ what happens give [Music] it shows [Music] [Music] the word he told the old testament saints he told the old testament saints god with all the minds the men with all their bodies they couldn't do it [Music] [Music] you know the thing is if you don't understand godhood and godhead you know let me ask you then let's move on when god was god lost you or even before he was god memorable where were you and if you were a attribute was the attribute uh in him that was to be expressed you just didn't become queen of heaven [Music] he said jesus [Music] god began to change the dispensation [Music] you think god was just suspending himself in in mid-air there was a purpose you understand me there was a people yeah the bet would recognize [Music] hallelujah when the world didn't know what it was he told the rebecca of this day that's my lord y'all understand me let's give him a compliment so if he's lord see watch this watch the scene because the next move is becca going into isaac's tent and becoming pregnant you must fall in love with this message you know we we must move up into the heavens hallelujah look what problem in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he have purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in christ not around him not above him both which are in heaven the dead in whom also we have obtained an inheritance he said we are him in this world [Music] [Music] when you receive laughed in the face of death diabetes [Music] we were here itself above the word of god [Music] every demon is subject to the world and it came only and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any any others have spoke of the bride if it doesn't if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride hello hello because she is flesh of his flesh of this bone of his bone us this is his life power of his power she is him and let me understand that let's give him a comment she is him and see a little jesus christ never ran from [Music] because it was not yet time for him to be crucified heaven is not fought right right because you know in the old school denomination we thought heaven was millions and zillions of miles away [Music] [Music] uh but when you die and go to hell you do not go to the lake of fire and we thought that hell was eternal and hell is not [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] why did god come to tell us hallelujah hallelujah what what did god do jeffy he took a man and he made him time travel [Music] [Music] but he said it was a different world somebody helped me here you know what he said he said those people had no sex claims you know everybody should say hallelujah y'all know most of your trouble comes from the sex clan hallelujah just think about it no more no more no more no more you can't have a little faith to believe that you were dead i don't know why i believe that but i believe that with all of my heart hallelujah a dimension away in dimension think about it consciousness and these dimensions did not always exist the way they do [Music] we ought to be seeing more supernatural [Music] you know what [Music] by the name of jesus cast out them under jesus has always been amanda paul says he moves through us all in him we live in him we move on [Music] so in in essence we must begin to think like god let's put it we must begin to think like rulers for a long time [Music] but it means that he's the prince in power of that dimension of the air the spiritual dimension that you can't see but jesus rent the veil jesus hallelujah he destroyed everything coming up from hell all the way and from heaven all the way he destroyed everything the devil thought he had like you love the lord let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your goodness we thank you for everything you've done for us lord i
