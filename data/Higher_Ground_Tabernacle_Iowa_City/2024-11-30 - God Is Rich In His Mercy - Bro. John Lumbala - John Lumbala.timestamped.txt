[21:03] what is going on it's just few
[21:08] people people are cold they didn't want
[21:10] to come to church
[21:17] [Music]
[21:20] or they should said that they will be
[21:23] called and we not going to come
[21:26] [Music]
[21:30] maybe we we should stop our meeting and
[21:34] wait until
[21:36] summer the Lord bless
[21:39] you you are the
[21:44] heroes cuz the heroes never never
[21:51] abandon we said it last Sunday or last
[21:54] Friday
[21:59] God doesn't owe
[22:03] anybody everything that you do for
[22:06] God there's always a reward for
[22:10] it another day they've asked God a
[22:14] question I think it was Peter who asked
[22:17] Jesus a
[22:21] question where for second everything
[22:24] just to follow
[22:26] you you as well well we can ask him the
[22:29] same
[22:32] question we have uh confronted the C
[22:38] follow we brought our children through
[22:41] the C just to follow
[22:44] you so what are we going to
[22:47] get just listen to the to the
[22:52] answer you're going to receive 100 times
[22:56] of what
[22:57] you for
[23:00] but God going to reward you at
[23:04] 100% and above
[23:07] that he will give you eternal
[23:11] life so you're not losing by following
[23:14] Jesus you don't
[23:16] lose may God bless
[23:19] you so let us stand up our feet and read
[23:21] something
[23:27] [Music]
[23:30] we're going to read in the book of Psalm
[23:32] 107 where we read last
[23:36] time Psalm
[23:41] 107
[23:46] EP from Psalm that will be just the
[23:49] first
[23:53] verse because we still going to talk
[23:55] about the same subject God who rich and
[24:02] mercy but we're going to add up another
[24:07] thing because the the word of God
[24:09] doesn't
[24:10] finish it's it's always
[24:15] there we going to read in the name of
[24:17] the Lord
[24:19] so uh oh give thanks to the Lord for he
[24:23] is good for his Mercy endures forever
[24:28] amen
[24:31] amen Ephesians chapter
[24:36] 2 chapter 2 from 1 to 6
[25:22] Ephesians chapter 2 verse verse 6 to 7
[25:36] and raised and raised us up together and
[25:40] made us SE together in the Heavenly
[25:43] places in Christ
[25:44] Jesus that in the age in the ages to
[25:49] come he might show the EXC the exceeding
[25:52] Riches of his grace in his kindness
[25:56] toward us in Jesus Christ
[25:59] Christ amen
[26:04] amen may God add blessings upon his
[26:11] word we greeting you
[26:14] papa I didn't know that you would
[26:19] come glory to God for your
[26:24] presence we're going to talk about God
[26:27] who's rich in Mercy
[26:35] the me of God is the most important
[26:38] things for
[26:42] us because we came in this world being
[26:48] Sinners and we living with
[26:53] Sinners we also influenced and we came
[26:56] to the perverted ways in this
[27:01] but the only thing that give us courage
[27:03] to
[27:06] walk is when we can believe that our God
[27:09] is God of Mercy amen
[27:15] amen it's now advantage to believe in
[27:18] the mercy of
[27:25] God if we don't believe in the mercy of
[27:27] God then we be living in our
[27:33] condemnation why while the Bible says
[27:36] there's no condemnation for those who
[27:38] are in Christ
[27:43] Jesus so when the Devil Comes he's
[27:45] coming to discourage us with the
[27:48] condemnation do you remember what you've
[27:50] done that
[27:52] day you want to pray the devil is
[27:55] reminding you of of the things that
[27:56] you've already uh
[28:03] conf the devil is able to go even
[28:06] through the blood of Jesus to find your
[28:07] sin and present it to
[28:11] you while it's impossible for him to
[28:14] find that
[28:18] sin once you've already confessed your
[28:24] sin according to the ways of God that
[28:26] they've been given out by
[28:30] so your problem is already
[28:35] done before God who rich in Mercy it's
[28:38] like you never sin
[28:41] before God is has already forgiven for
[28:46] everything that you've
[28:51] done one day they brought up a woman who
[28:54] was
[28:57] sinning so they got that that woman
[28:59] sinning and they brought her before
[29:01] Jesus and they asked a question to Jesus
[29:04] as to to to tempt
[29:07] him and they say we found this
[29:10] woman we got her
[29:14] sinning but Moses told us to Stone
[29:22] her but God who rich in Mercy instead of
[29:26] condemning the woman
[29:31] he said unto the woman go and sin no
[29:33] more amen
[29:37] amen the only bad thing we can
[29:41] do is
[29:42] to arrange
[29:46] sin I can take an example just a little
[29:54] example a brother has got some
[29:57] weaknesses
[29:59] maybe he's
[30:05] drinking you found that brother saying
[30:08] uh you know uh beers is not a problem
[30:11] taking beers is not a problem if you're
[30:14] drinking beer is not a
[30:16] problem even you read in the Bible when
[30:19] if you can read in the
[30:22] Bible Jesus has Chang aend water into
[30:26] wine
[30:31] it's not a problem doinking a beer is
[30:33] not a problem so that kind of a brother
[30:36] is the is the dangerous
[30:38] one but if you find someone who's
[30:42] drinking brother I know I'm weak myself
[30:46] I know to leave this beer it's a problem
[30:49] for me so that one God can uh can do
[30:53] him can forgive him so there's a
[30:56] difference between those two people
[30:59] another one is just covering up his sin
[31:02] is trying to cover his
[31:07] sin meanwhile the person who's covering
[31:09] up his transgression or his sin will
[31:12] never inherit the kingdom of
[31:14] God but the one that is seeking for
[31:17] mercy of God is going to found it
[31:20] because the mercy of God is our right as
[31:22] the children of house we've got our
[31:26] right all of us as children of God one
[31:30] father and is a children right that we
[31:33] know we got to feed our children as a
[31:37] father as a
[31:39] parent we got to uh clothe our
[31:43] children we got to protect them as
[31:47] parents we got to uh rebuke
[31:52] them oh we got to find a shelter for
[31:54] them
[31:58] that's the children
[32:00] right as a parent I have to watch upon
[32:04] that so if I've got I am a bed
[32:08] father I a bed father I'm thinking in
[32:11] the right way to do that to my children
[32:14] so how much more our heavenly
[32:17] father as a child of a most
[32:21] high we got our right as
[32:24] well the things that belongs to us
[32:28] like the mercy of God belongs to
[32:31] us God has to forgive me because he's
[32:34] the one who said that he's going to
[32:35] forgive
[32:39] us in the Garden of Eden God wasn't
[32:44] surprised when God was creating
[32:48] Adam he knew that Adam was going to
[32:52] fall before even Adam fall
[32:58] that's why he provided a way for
[33:01] Adam the way that he provided for Adam
[33:04] was a mercy Mery
[33:07] way so when Adam
[33:10] came he have done whatever he has
[33:16] done but the quality of God of Mercy
[33:19] should be manifested that's what
[33:23] happened if God wasn't Merc uh full in
[33:26] Mercy he was going to kill
[33:30] Adam he was going to create another
[33:32] species of
[33:34] people but just because he's a full of
[33:37] Mercy rich and
[33:39] mercy he preserved our
[33:47] race and he accepted not death to touch
[33:50] his child amen
[33:54] amen so if God have done it yesterday
[33:58] he can still do it
[34:01] today if God have done it for
[34:04] Adam he forgave
[34:09] Adam Adam was under the blood which
[34:12] wasn't compatible to his
[34:14] BL but Adam found Mercy to
[34:18] God even when Adam
[34:22] sinned God came to speak to Adam being a
[34:26] sinner he was discussing with God being
[34:30] a
[34:32] sinner so God can do the same thing for
[34:36] you God can still talk to
[34:41] you but when he's talking to you is not
[34:44] to cover your sin but it's trying to
[34:45] pull you back to get you back to
[34:49] him so our God is really reach in
[34:54] Mercy it's in our advantage to believe
[34:57] that
[34:58] [Music]
[35:00] when I was meditating about
[35:03] this then I started reading the
[35:05] definition the meaning of
[35:08] mercy and I found so many meanings of
[35:12] definitions of
[35:15] mercy so one definition attract my
[35:19] intention
[35:28] he's saying that the mercy that's what
[35:31] God is is the virtue that God is using
[35:33] to bring back a
[35:36] sinner then I say How great is the mercy
[35:39] of
[35:42] God so the mercy is greater than God's
[35:49] judgment Mercy is greater than the wrath
[35:51] of
[35:55] God Mercy is greater than the just
[35:57] justice of
[36:00] God so it's so important to believe into
[36:03] a
[36:05] mercy because whoever doesn't believe in
[36:08] Mercy then he believes in
[36:15] condemnation so listen to what the
[36:17] prophet is saying in the preaching God
[36:20] whose Mercy who who's rich in Mercy
[36:23] paragraph
[36:24] 38 listen to what it's saying
[36:30] you were one time
[36:33] dead you were
[36:38] dead even
[36:40] tonight at a certain
[36:45] point you can look back and see that you
[36:47] were
[36:52] dead so how come that you not dat
[36:55] tonight
[36:58] as you were in that
[37:02] time so is in that state as that you you
[37:06] meditating to
[37:08] be because you were a
[37:12] sinner but God who's rich in
[37:16] Mercy that's the
[37:18] point God who was
[37:22] rich everything that we we used to
[37:29] but see precisely what operated the
[37:33] change is God who rich in
[37:37] Mercy paragraph 39 the prophet is saying
[37:42] this I'm so happy with
[37:46] that that God is rich in
[37:49] Mercy if he was just rich in
[37:53] money if he was just rich in material
[37:56] things yes is is but regardless of
[38:02] everything what is So
[38:07] Glorious is that God is rich in
[38:11] Mercy what a noticeable word of
[38:15] God that were one time
[38:21] dead and the prophet is showing us the
[38:24] greatness of the mercy of God
[38:27] is telling us that God is rich in Gold
[38:32] that's good he's also good in money
[38:36] that's
[38:37] good is rich in material things it's
[38:40] still
[38:42] good but the most important is that God
[38:46] is rich in
[38:49] Mercy if God is not rich in Mercy how
[38:52] are you going to enjoy everything that
[38:53] is going to do to you
[38:58] uh one day I was uh a
[39:09] cemetery uh my friends my friend's
[39:12] daughter pass away we were together in
[39:15] South
[39:17] Africa she passed
[39:20] away so we went to bury that daughter in
[39:24] in
[39:26] Chicago while was walking around the
[39:30] [Music]
[39:33] graveyard then I start looking to the uh
[39:36] dead of birth upon the tombs of
[39:40] people then I've noticed that even
[39:42] little
[39:44] children as I was walking around the
[39:48] tombs and I saw another one was almost
[39:51] my
[39:52] age and I said oh
[39:54] God you are rich in Mercy
[39:59] then I start looking back in my
[40:02] life how many times I I got into
[40:07] accident how many times I survived
[40:11] accident then I say oh
[40:14] God even white
[40:17] people even white are
[40:20] dead which means I'm more important than
[40:23] all of those
[40:25] people then I say to myself God is rich
[40:28] in
[40:30] Mercy beloved listen to one
[40:35] thing there's so many
[40:38] words not only this world in which we
[40:43] are our Prophet calls them Dimensions am
[40:50] amen we living only in in the light in
[40:54] the in in
[40:56] time and
[41:00] [Music]
[41:02] M we can get into a fourth dimension the
[41:06] scientific word through the internet and
[41:09] all of those
[41:11] things so we just limit ourself in those
[41:13] four
[41:16] dimensions so other dimensions are just
[41:19] spiritual
[41:21] Dimensions I'm just assuring you
[41:25] Brothers there's so many things
[41:27] happening in the spiritual world right
[41:29] now as we're standing
[41:33] here there are
[41:36] meetings in spiritual words right now in
[41:40] other
[41:43] dimensions because in those word the
[41:46] prophet says it's the real
[41:48] Dimensions he visited
[41:51] them why do we love our
[41:55] Prophet because he doesn't tell us
[41:57] things that he didn't he didn't
[42:00] leave when the prophet talks about
[42:02] heaven he gives us the details of the
[42:06] heaven when he talks about
[42:09] hell he gives us the report of what he
[42:12] have seen in
[42:14] her it's not like other people are just
[42:17] imagining about hell but he have seen
[42:19] hell he have seen heaven when he gives a
[42:24] testimony is a true testimony from a
[42:27] true uh uh witness amen
[42:34] [Music]
[42:40] amen we got job
[42:49] case the Book of Job chapter
[42:53] 2 we're going to listen to something
[42:59] Job chapter 2
[43:11] verse2 Job chapter 2 verse
[43:19] two and the Lord said to Satan from
[43:23] where do you
[43:25] come so Satan
[43:27] answered answered answered the Lord and
[43:30] said from going from going to and
[43:35] from and from the earth and from walking
[43:39] back and forth on
[43:43] it then the Lord said to Satan have you
[43:46] considered my servant
[43:48] job that there is none like him on on
[43:51] the earth and a blameless and right man
[43:57] one who fears God and shs Evil and still
[44:02] he holds fast to his Integrity although
[44:06] he insist uh he
[44:09] insisted insist insisted me against him
[44:12] destroy him without cause so Satan
[44:16] answered the Lord and said skin for skin
[44:21] yes all CH man all that man has he will
[44:25] give for his life but stretch out your
[44:28] hands
[44:30] now we can just stop
[44:35] there so something is taking place right
[44:39] here there was a
[44:42] meeting the meeting that was taking
[44:46] place they're talking about
[44:48] [Music]
[44:50] job by the time they were talking about
[44:53] job job didn't know anything
[44:58] he was just busy with his
[45:00] days while he was doing his own
[45:04] business there was a meeting
[45:07] somewhere and they are conspiring about
[45:10] him and job is
[45:14] innosent if it wasn't for grace of God
[45:16] in that
[45:17] day it was going to be the end of
[45:21] job cuz God God said unto Satan you can
[45:25] do whatever on him but never touch his
[45:28] life amen
[45:31] amen it's the same thing about
[45:34] you is the same thing about
[45:37] me while we seated right
[45:40] here there's meeting taking place
[45:43] somewh it can be somewhere
[45:49] else the Bible says those bad Spirit are
[45:52] in in in the
[45:54] hair there might be a witchcraft
[45:58] but they are comporting against
[46:01] us so what is protecting
[46:04] us is the mercy of God
[46:11] Amen we got to believe in that mercy of
[46:14] God amen
[46:16] amen there was another
[46:22] thing that was about Mike
[46:27] or we can just talk and and move
[46:31] forward it was about Mike there was a
[46:34] war it was uh first king uh 19
[46:46] okay oh the King was about to uh to
[46:50] start a
[46:54] war while the King was getting ready to
[46:57] start the war they called
[47:02] Mike all the prophet have already say
[47:05] that M you can go forward and study
[47:08] War but in that
[47:11] time Mike inspired by God he
[47:17] said I've seen a meeting taking place in
[47:21] heaven so you are seated right there on
[47:23] the
[47:24] earth but there's a meeting taking place
[47:27] in
[47:28] heaven in that
[47:31] meeting they were citing your
[47:35] name they were doing conspiracy about
[47:38] your
[47:39] name because the Lord is the Lord of
[47:43] army all Spirits are at the service of
[47:47] God the the spirit of lie
[47:50] said I want to
[47:54] go I want to enter in the mouth of those
[47:59] I'm going to give a false
[48:01] prophecies then they will believe into a
[48:04] li they will go and they'll be killed
[48:07] amen
[48:09] amen another
[48:12] example it's about
[48:16] Peter we can read it we can read about
[48:20] Peter Luke
[48:25] 22 Luke chapter
[48:31] 22 verse
[48:39] 24 and truly the son of man goes as it
[48:44] has been DET uh deter
[48:47] determined but who to that man by whom
[48:52] he is
[48:54] betrayed oh Luke 22 yeah oh sorry I was
[49:00] reading
[49:03] 24 now there was also a dispute among
[49:07] them as to which of them should be
[49:09] considered the
[49:11] greatest and he said to them the kings
[49:15] of the Gentiles exercise lordship over
[49:18] them and those who exercise Authority
[49:22] are over
[49:23] them authority over them are called
[49:27] Bene uh uh
[49:30] benefactors but not so among you on the
[49:34] contrary who he who is greatest among
[49:38] among you let him be as the younger the
[49:44] younger Luke
[49:47] 22:24
[49:52] yeah 24 now there was a dispute among
[49:55] them
[49:57] as to which of them should be considered
[49:59] the
[50:01] [Music]
[50:12] greatest so it's Luke
[50:15] 22:31 and the Lord said said Simon Simon
[50:20] indeed Satan has asked for you that he
[50:23] may he may shift you as weak
[50:27] but I have prayed for you amen that your
[50:30] faith should not faade amen and when you
[50:33] have returned to me strengthen your your
[50:38] Breen amen may God bless the reading of
[50:41] his
[50:44] word so Peter was seated with his
[50:48] brothers he was
[50:52] ignorant that while he was
[50:55] sitting in that that
[50:57] time the devil was asking for
[51:01] him and it's only Jesus who knew about
[51:07] it so the devil was asking for Peter to
[51:11] kill
[51:12] him but Peter was busy doing other
[51:14] things he didn't know what was going
[51:17] on it's like us as we seated
[51:21] here he can if you can just look back in
[51:24] your
[51:25] life see you've been born until
[51:30] today if you couldn't see the mercy of
[51:36] God so there's there's no one who can
[51:39] who can be more blind than
[51:43] you if you can't see the mercy of God in
[51:46] your
[51:48] life there's no one Blinder than
[51:52] you so if God accepted
[51:58] to open our spiritual
[52:01] eyes so that we can see what is
[52:03] happening in another
[52:05] dimension the fight that God is busy
[52:08] fighting for
[52:09] us the victory that God is having for
[52:14] us the failures that he gave to the
[52:16] Witchcraft
[52:18] people the victory that God is given to
[52:21] us when they wanted to kill
[52:25] us God can just open our eyes and see
[52:28] that that we can see what could
[52:32] happen we were going to sing the mercy
[52:35] of God because he said unto Peter he
[52:39] said unto Peter
[52:41] this that the devil is claiming you he
[52:45] want to kill
[52:46] you but I prayed for
[52:50] you that's the mercy of
[52:53] God it said in the Bible
[52:56] it's in the book of Romans chapter 8
[53:00] 26 that the Holy Ghost is interceding
[53:04] for
[53:05] us with
[53:09] unable that's the work of
[53:12] Mercy that's the work of
[53:15] Mercy that we have
[53:17] always that we should have in our
[53:20] mind that we should have in our in our
[53:23] in our heart to believe that God Of
[53:25] Heaven is died for
[53:28] us everything that we could ask him
[53:30] tonight he's going to give it to
[53:33] us believing that the almighty God is
[53:37] able to forgive of all sin that we have
[53:42] Sinn he able to give us everything that
[53:45] we
[53:47] need there's nothing that we can ask
[53:49] from
[53:50] God and other thing that we
[53:54] couldn't because God is able to give us
[53:57] everything that we
[53:59] need he's also able to forgive us of all
[54:03] our
[54:04] sins is also a high
[54:10] priest who touched by the feelings of
[54:13] our
[54:15] infirmity he only ask us to go back
[54:19] ways to always asking for
[54:22] forgiveness and is able to perfect us is
[54:26] able to perfect our M
[54:30] condition because our well-being that's
[54:33] is he cares for us the high
[54:37] priest he's not dead he's still
[54:41] alive we going to read what the prophet
[54:46] says about the high
[54:48] priest before we pray amen amen
[54:53] [Music]
[54:58] in the attitude and who's
[55:01] [Music]
[55:03] God paragraph
[55:11] 35 the prophet said
[55:18] this as the inspiration of God is here

[55:23] you just remember
[55:31] God going to bring your body to obey to
[55:33] your confession amen
[55:36] amen that's why it's more important for
[55:40] us to always pronounce good weight for
[55:44] ourselves when you talk about God God

[55:49] come when you talk about
[55:51] Jesus he will
[55:54] come when it talk about Mery

[56:06] God and the mercy will will shown up
[56:10] will be shown in your
[56:12] life when you talk about

[57:00] sinner that you want to commit
[57:03] sin you will find yourself committing
[57:06] sin without any any
[57:10] fault but if you say that you a
[57:13] [Music]

[57:18] that every time listen to
[57:21] this God will bring
[57:26] your
[57:30] testimony your testimony going to bring
[57:32] you straight away to what you

[57:40] healing and you believe that God has
[57:42] healed

[57:49] it then God will bring your your body to
[57:52] believe to your confession
[57:58] because he's a high priest of our
[58:00] confession amen
[58:07] amen is now seated at the right hand of
[58:10] God with his own
[58:13] blood to
[58:20] intercede for every confession that
[58:23] you've made that's why he died
[58:26] he died to take away sins and the
[58:30] sickness that's the consequences of
[58:33] sin he was wounded for our
[58:36] sins by his tribe that we've been
[58:40] healed just remember
[58:42] that just have
[58:45] faith never doubt about it am amen
[58:57] we're going to read one more
[58:59] scripture then we're going to
[59:02] [Music]
[59:03] close the resurrection of Jus uh uh
[59:08] daughter paragraph
[59:13] eight no matter how weak you

[59:31] situation are we
[59:41] together is there to intercede according
[59:45] to what we confessing
[59:49] amen so you see how much important is
[59:51] our confession
[59:54] [Music]
[59:56] I know one brother going to come back to
[59:58] the
[59:59] reading I met him the last time when I
[1:00:01] was in
[1:00:03] kinasa I was so
[1:00:05] shocked a brother a
[1:00:08] preacher when you talk to
[1:00:12] him you know I'm po I'm a poor man I got
[1:00:17] nothing I'm going to die just as I
[1:00:21] am everything that I've done in my life
[1:00:25] I fade
[1:00:28] so you are a
[1:00:30] preacher how can you Cur yourself in
[1:00:32] that
[1:00:34] way that's I'm just saying the
[1:00:36] truth no that's the insult to
[1:00:39] God said I'm your young
[1:00:42] brother I can never say that to
[1:00:46] you it should be an enemy who saying
[1:00:48] that to you and if I'm there I'm going
[1:00:51] to rebuke him but look
[1:00:54] yourself you a bad testimony against
[1:00:59] yourself you say that you came in this
[1:01:01] way just to accompan other people and
[1:01:03] you said that you're poor you said that
[1:01:05] you
[1:01:06] fail no I'm not happy about
[1:01:09] that he said that I'm
[1:01:13] poor God is a witness now that I'm here
[1:01:15] they call
[1:01:19] me is no more at home they Tred to find
[1:01:22] him they didn't never find him
[1:01:26] they they checking his document he found
[1:01:28] they found that he have made a will
[1:01:30] already
[1:01:32] probably he committed
[1:01:35] suicide he just wrote there don't look
[1:01:38] try to find me uh everything that I have
[1:01:42] just give it to my people then he
[1:01:44] disappear and his wife doesn't know
[1:01:46] where she where he is so what happened
[1:01:49] to that
[1:01:51] person his confession had found him amen
[1:01:54] amen
[1:01:57] he confessed that he had got
[1:02:01] nothing where could he go he confessed
[1:02:03] that he had nothing no one else he said
[1:02:06] that he fail in his life he said he came
[1:02:09] to accompan other people effectively he
[1:02:12] came to accompan other people he said
[1:02:14] that he is poor he's really
[1:02:18] poor when I read a will that he has
[1:02:22] made I want to see what he share with
[1:02:25] people
[1:02:26] then understood that he was really a
[1:02:28] poor
[1:02:29] man then the PO the poverty has followed
[1:02:33] him so let us pay attention to what we
[1:02:37] say the the the high priest of our
[1:02:40] confession is praying on our favor he's
[1:02:44] praying in our favor and
[1:02:49] also is bringing to into existence what
[1:02:53] we
[1:02:54] confessing that's why I
[1:02:57] I'm a Son of
[1:02:58] God yes I'm a Son of
[1:03:01] God you like it or not I am a Son of
[1:03:07] God
[1:03:09] Amen I believe that that's how everyone
[1:03:11] should give his testimony to other
[1:03:13] people especially as the privileged
[1:03:16] people the sons of Malachi FK the the
[1:03:19] bless the race of God people have
[1:03:22] received the
[1:03:23] prophet people who have believed in
[1:03:26] impossible things that are not in
[1:03:30] unexplained what we believe living they
[1:03:33] the difficult difficult
[1:03:34] things and it's not given to anybody to
[1:03:37] believe what we
[1:03:39] believing that's why it's so hard to
[1:03:41] bring to bring somebody to the message
[1:03:44] because the message is a
[1:03:46] university it's not a elementary
[1:03:49] school it's not the
[1:03:52] crush I I gave a testimony last time
[1:03:58] they were preaching the message to us
[1:03:59] and we were three by that time one
[1:04:01] brother was preaching to
[1:04:03] us while he was preaching to
[1:04:06] us the same word he was using I was so
[1:04:09] happy about those words I was saying
[1:04:11] Amen to that but my other two
[1:04:15] friends they were saying that those
[1:04:17] things are for white
[1:04:19] people
[1:04:22] philosophy so you want to give glory to
[1:04:24] a man
[1:04:27] I said he just used the same
[1:04:29] word but the same word to me is the
[1:04:33] honey in my ears but to my friends it's
[1:04:37] bitter they even start
[1:04:40] insulting I just heard the person was
[1:04:43] preaching said you as well you want to
[1:04:46] glorify a man I said unto them this is
[1:04:49] so beauti so
[1:04:51] nice then I say mercy of God Mercy God
[1:04:56] for those
[1:04:57] people God is so rich in
[1:05:00] Mercy and we love his
[1:05:04] Mercy when we leave our home to come
[1:05:08] here there's many many plan that the
[1:05:12] devil is planned for
[1:05:13] us the thing is we don't see those devil
[1:05:17] plans that war is happening in the earth
[1:05:20] we don't see
[1:05:22] it but our our our chance the chance
[1:05:28] we got a high priest who's praying in
[1:05:32] our
[1:05:33] favor the high priest is not dead He's
[1:05:38] Alive that's why when we're going to
[1:05:40] leave this place we will
[1:05:42] pray and the high priest will take care
[1:05:46] of all the evil
[1:05:48] spirit while we be
[1:05:51] sleeping the high
[1:05:54] priest will be taking Tak care of all
[1:05:56] the evil
[1:05:58] spirit because there's nobody who can be
[1:06:00] more glorious than God we continue the
[1:06:11] reading is there to intercede on the
[1:06:15] basis of what we
[1:06:16] confess that have done for us
[1:06:26] and everything that is in the
[1:06:29] atonement he was wounded for our
[1:06:32] sin he was broken for our
[1:06:41] iniquity the H that bring us peace has
[1:06:44] fallen on
[1:06:48] him and is true his tribe that we've
[1:06:51] been
[1:06:53] healed everything
[1:06:57] all the attribute of
[1:07:00] death that we're receiving in our
[1:07:04] heart we believe to be
[1:07:08] truth that we believe that he have done
[1:07:10] it for
[1:07:16] us before we even feel them listen to
[1:07:21] this testimony it's saying
[1:07:24] this even if we are
[1:07:30] sick before even we see our
[1:07:34] healing we will start
[1:07:38] confessing because he is the one who's
[1:07:40] going to take care of
[1:07:43] that he is the one who's going to bring
[1:07:46] Force our body to believe to our
[1:07:48] confession but if you were saying by
[1:07:51] example no I'm
[1:07:54] sick I know I'm going to
[1:07:56] die yes you're going to die of course
[1:07:59] because you confess death and the death
[1:08:02] going to
[1:08:03] come it's like you inviting
[1:08:07] death you see on the on the uh Damascus
[1:08:12] Road there were there were brothers were
[1:08:15] coming since they were
[1:08:17] walking they were talking about
[1:08:20] Jesus you know when Jesus
[1:08:23] came we thought he was going to help but
[1:08:26] why did he die we we just regret his
[1:08:29] death he was so great that
[1:08:31] man we didn't think that they
[1:08:34] could we saw him
[1:08:37] resurrecting we saw him resurrecting
[1:08:39] Lazarus but somebody who resurrecting
[1:08:42] dead people someone who's
[1:08:45] forgiving how how could they stop
[1:08:48] you how could they arrest
[1:08:52] him while they were talking about Jesus
[1:08:56] as they talk so much about Jesus Jesus
[1:08:59] came down and walk with
[1:09:01] them because they given a testimony
[1:09:04] about Jesus they repeated the name of
[1:09:07] Jesus several times until Jesus himself
[1:09:10] materialized himself it's the same
[1:09:13] thing because Jesus is the high
[1:09:17] priest he takes care of our
[1:09:20] confession what are we talking what are
[1:09:22] we saying all along the day
[1:09:26] what are we talking all day long in our
[1:09:29] prayers what are we doing what are we
[1:09:31] saying so what are we asking in our
[1:09:36] prayers what are we confessing upon our
[1:09:41] children what are we confessing upon our
[1:09:46] families what are we confessing upon our
[1:09:50] wives what are we saying about our
[1:09:53] husbands
[1:09:55] so let us finish the
[1:09:57] reading so that we may
[1:10:00] pray all those
[1:10:03] things all those attribute of his death
[1:10:07] that we're receiving in our
[1:10:08] heart that we believe to be
[1:10:12] truth that we confessing that he has
[1:10:14] done
[1:10:18] it that we confessing before even we
[1:10:20] feel them
[1:10:25] he is standing before God so that he can
[1:10:28] fix
[1:10:29] it he's standing in intercession for us
[1:10:33] and the prophet is giving an
[1:10:35] example if I was
[1:10:38] paralyzed that I believe in my heart
[1:10:40] that he has healed
[1:10:42] me I'll confess that I'm
[1:10:47] Healed even if I couldn't move one
[1:10:50] muscles of my
[1:10:53] heart I will believe it
[1:10:56] I will believe
[1:10:58] it and
[1:11:00] then if I'm sincere in my
[1:11:04] heart not just Disturbed but in my
[1:11:09] spirit if I'm sincere in my
[1:11:15] heart is interceding before God on the
[1:11:19] basis of My Confession that's
[1:11:22] true and he's going to fulfill it
[1:11:29] can you think about it amen

[1:11:49] us in this
[1:11:51] place it's his Mercy that give us chance
[1:11:54] to speak to him
