[0:18] May the Lord bless you.
[0:24] May we stand up to start the service
[0:26] this morning.
[0:35] We are going to open our Bibles in the
[0:36] book of Luke 18.
[1:09] Luke 18,
[1:14] there was in a city a judge. We fear not
[1:17] God, neither regarded men.
[1:21] And there was a widow in that city. And
[1:23] she came unto him, saying, "Avenge me of
[1:26] mine adversary,
[1:28] and he will not for a while. But
[1:31] afterward he said within himself,
[1:34] though I fear not God, nor regard man,
[1:37] yet because this widow troubled me, I
[1:40] will avenge her, lest by a continual
[1:44] coming she me."
[1:46] And the Lord say, hear what the unjust
[1:50] unjust judge said. And shall not God
[1:53] aven avenge his own elect which cry day
[1:57] and night unto him.
[1:59] Though he bear along with them, I tell
[2:02] you that he will avenge them speedily.
[2:05] Nevertheless, when the Son of man
[2:07] cometh, shall he find faith on the
[2:10] earth. May the Lord bless his word.
[2:15] We sing the Lord, the love of God in D.

[16:48] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ, to seek you every
[16:51] day,
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, because your word says, oh Lord
[16:56] Jesus Christ,

[17:01] me.
[17:04] Lord Jesus Christ, we are here this

[17:46] spirit and fill us
[17:52] in such a way, Lord Jesus Christ, that
[17:54] when we go out
[17:57] that the Lord may not see us anymore.
[17:59] But the word may not see us anymore. But
[18:02] they may see you
[18:07] because your word say oh Lord Jesus
[18:09] Christ
[18:11] that you will be with us
[18:13] even in us Lord Jesus Christ at the end
[18:16] of the word. Those are your promises. Oh

[41:39] the children, and the heart of the
[41:41] children to their fathers, lest I come
[41:44] and smite the earth with a curse.
[42:07] Amen. Let's go to Zechariah chapter 4.
[42:14] And this is going to be a lengthy
[42:15] reading.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; So I'll probably just read two verses
[42:19] and read two verses faster.
[42:27] And the angel that talked with me,
[42:29] Zechariah chapter 4.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; And the angel that talked with me came
[42:33] again and wake me as a man that is
[42:36] waking out of his sleep. And said unto
[42:39] me, what seeest thou? And I said, I have
[42:42] looked and behold a candlestick all of
[42:44] gold with a bowl upon the top of it and
[42:47] his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes
[42:50] to the seven lamps which are up on the
[42:52] top there.
[43:13] set lamp
[43:21] and two olive trees by each, one up on
[43:24] the right side of the bowl and the other
[43:25] up on the left side thereof. So I
[43:28] answered and spake to the angel that
[43:29] talked with me, saying, "What are these?
[43:31] My Lord.
[43:53] Then the angel that talked with me
[43:56] u with me answered and said unto me,
[43:58] "Knowest thou not what this be?" And I
[44:01] said, "No, my lord." Then he answered
[44:03] and spake unto me, saying, "This is the
[44:05] word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel,
[44:07] saying, Not by might, nor by power, but
[44:10] by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.
[44:35] Who art thou, oh great mountain? before
[44:37] Zerubbabel, thou shalt become a plain,
[44:39] and ye shall bring forth the headstone
[44:41] thereof with shoutings, crying, grace,
[44:43] grace unto it. Moreover, the word of the
[44:45] Lord came unto me, saying, The hands of
[44:47] Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of
[44:50] this house. His hands shall also finish
[44:52] it, and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[44:54] hosts has sent me unto you.
[45:06] Grass grass grass.
[45:23] Amen. Let's bow our head.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; If you have a need, just raise your
[45:27] hand.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we come
[45:32] before you
[45:37] &gt;&gt; in your lovely name, the name of Jesus
[45:38] Christ.
[45:40] [Music]
[45:41] Lord, Father, Lord, we thank you for
[45:43] keeping us healthy and coming into your
[45:45] house this morning.
[45:51] And heavenly father Lord because you
[45:52] give us a promise that wherever two or
[45:54] three are gathered in your name you
[45:56] shall be there.
[46:02] Lord we are gathered here in the name of
[46:03] Jesus Christ.
[46:07] Father you've seen your children raise
[46:08] their hand and their request.
[46:12] Lord I pray that you supply it to their
[46:14] to their needs
[46:17] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Heavenly
[46:20] Father, Lord, I commit myself into your
[46:22] into your
[46:25] Lord. I pray that you take me out of the
[46:27] way and that you use this vessel for
[46:28] your glory.
[46:33] And I also pray that your Holy Spirit
[46:35] here through the congregation, Lord,
[46:40] and that only you may be glorified.
[46:44] Lord, if there's any spirit that doesn't
[46:46] confess your name,
[46:49] &gt;&gt; I rebuke it in the name of the Lord
[46:50] Jesus Christ.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray.
[46:56] Amen.
[46:58] Amen.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[47:03] So, the title for my sermon is going to
[47:05] be a part two of the last sermon that I
[47:07] preached here.
[47:11] So, it's going to be called, "What do
[47:13] you say of the message of the hour?"
[47:14] Parts two.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Last time we preached on the same
[47:23] message and I didn't quite finish it
[47:29] and I'm going to bring a different
[47:31] aspect of it today
[47:34] by God's grace. So what is the message
[47:36] of the hour?
[47:39] &gt;&gt; You know, remember last time I preached
[47:41] here, we we read that scripture where
[47:43] Jesus asked the disciples, who do you
[47:45] say that that I am?
[48:00] And that's the question that each and
[48:01] every one of you are asked this morning.
[48:05] What do you say of the message of the
[48:07] hour?
[48:09] Your answer will only be a true answer
[48:12] if you have the revelation
[48:16] because your intelligence cannot reveal
[48:18] to you what this message is.
[48:22] The prophet even says the ability to
[48:23] compare scriptures to scriptures will
[48:25] not give you the revelation of what you
[48:27] teach.
[48:31] It takes the revelation of the Holy
[48:33] Ghost.
[48:36] What is the message of the hour? What is
[48:38] the message of the hour to you?
[48:41] Don't say what is the message of the
[48:43] hour to my parents.
[48:46] The question is what is the message of
[48:48] the hour to you?
[48:51] Young sisters, young brothers,
[48:54] &gt;&gt; what is the message of the hour?
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Why are you here this morning?
[49:00] Why couldn't you go to other churches?
[49:04] Why are you believing the message
[49:07] preached by a man?
[49:11] What proves to you that he was the
[49:12] messenger?
[49:15] Because Satan will come test and
[49:17] knowledge in you.
[49:19] Satan will come test a revelation in you
[49:23] because Jesus had a revelation of who he
[49:25] was.
[49:28] That's why he even said you can kill
[49:30] this body and in three days my father
[49:32] will raise it up.
[49:37] But Satan came in the wilderness and
[49:39] tempted Jesus.
[49:42] He wanted to know if Jesus truly had a
[49:45] revelation of who he was.
[49:49] And those same spirits are here testing
[49:51] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Those same spirits want to know if you
[49:57] actually know who you are.
[50:02] Because the only way Satan has an
[50:03] advantage of you is if you are ignorant.
[50:10] Because the Bible says that my people
[50:12] die for lack of knowledge.
[50:19] But we are not talking about the
[50:20] knowledge of human mind.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; But we are talking about the revelation
[50:26] of God.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; What is the message of the hour?
[50:32] The message of the hour is a message of
[50:34] restoration.
[50:37] It's a message that came to bring us
[50:39] back to our the faith of our fathers.
[50:44] We just read in Malachi chapter 4
[50:47] that the Bible says that the spirit of
[50:49] Elijah will have two ministries.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; You know the first part was already
[50:56] accomplished to John the Baptist
[51:00] and the second part is for the end time
[51:04] and the second part is talking about
[51:06] restoring us to the faith of our
[51:08] fathers.
[51:12] It's restoring you to your original
[51:14] position.
[51:16] It's restoring you to the position where
[51:18] you can speak things into existence.
[51:23] Restoring you into the true position as
[51:25] sons and daughters of God.
[51:28] So that the fruits that were in the book
[51:30] of Acts
[51:32] may also be in the church tonight.
[51:36] You know, the prophet says that if you
[51:38] have the Holy Ghost,
[51:40] then you're going to rewrite the book of
[51:42] act again.
[51:45] You know that's what the message of the
[51:46] hour came to do.
[51:49] It came to make sure that you brother
[51:51] Joseph are writing another book of acts.
[51:55] He came to make sure that each and
[51:56] everyone sitting this morning can write
[51:58] their own book of acts.
[52:01] You know when you read the book of acts
[52:03] you you got to feel special
[52:07] because you should also be able to write
[52:09] your own book of acts.
[52:12] Brothers if you are not able to write
[52:14] your own book of acts
[52:17] then the message of the hour has not
[52:18] been applied in your life yet
[52:22] because the book of acts it was truly
[52:25] the act of the holy ghost in the
[52:27] apostles.
[52:30] If you have the same Holy Ghost in you,
[52:34] you know Jesus says that the works that
[52:36] I do you shall also do.
[52:39] You know the Paul even says the gospel
[52:41] did not come in word only
[52:45] but it came in the demonstration with
[52:47] power.
[52:49] The Bible says these signs shall follow
[52:51] the believers.
[52:54] As if you are a believer the signs got
[52:56] to follow you.
[52:59] But you got to know the order. You are
[53:01] not following the signs. The signs
[53:02] follow you.
[53:05] So you cannot manufacture a sign
[53:09] because the signs only follow the
[53:11] believers.
[53:13] If in your life you don't have the signs
[53:15] of a believer.
[53:17] Maybe you are not a believer yet because
[53:20] my Bible tells me that these signs
[53:24] shall follow the believer.
[53:27] It does not say shall follow the
[53:28] ministers only.
[53:31] It does not say shall follow the pastor
[53:32] only.
[53:34] But he will follow the believer.
[53:37] He will follow the bride.
[53:40] You know that's what the message of the
[53:42] hour came to do.
[53:45] It came to restore us back to
[53:48] because why? Because it's your
[53:50] inheritance.
[53:52] It's something that belongs to you.
[53:55] You know the prophet says restoring
[53:56] means to take you back to your original
[54:01] take you back to that position that you
[54:03] once had
[54:05] the devil stole from you. The devil
[54:08] deceitfully stole the joy from you.
[54:12] God did not intend for you to be sick.
[54:17] God did not intend for you to be sad.
[54:21] God did not intend for you to be
[54:23] miserable.
[54:26] So you ought to take back that joy that
[54:28] God gave you.
[54:31] You are to God gave you your salvation,
[54:35] you ought to take that back because it's
[54:38] your inheritance.
[54:40] That's why the prophet said that when
[54:42] the bride gets to know who she is, then
[54:45] the rapture will take place. Why?
[54:48] Because once you get to know your
[54:50] position,
[54:52] you understand that there are certain
[54:54] things that belong to you that the devil
[54:57] stole back from you. What is the thing?
[54:59] That thing is that when God says a word,
[55:01] I say amen to it. Then Satan came and he
[55:05] brought unbelief in your life.
[55:07] But the message came to bring you
[55:09] perfect faith.
[55:11] And now when you have perfect faith,
[55:12] nothing stays in your way.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; And then the rapture takes place.
[55:18] Gravity even is is is is defied. Gravity
[55:22] is defied
[55:24] &gt;&gt; because you know your positions.
[55:28] Then the rapture takes place. You have
[55:31] to have a revelation of who you are. You
[55:34] have to re have a revelation of where
[55:36] you come to church on a Sunday morning.
[55:39] If Satan tried Jesus, he will try you.
[55:45] It's a message of restoration.
[55:50] Some some somehow throughout the ages,
[55:54] &gt;&gt; the church had lost certain privileges,
[56:00] &gt;&gt; you know, you can see even in the the
[56:02] when the prophet preached on the message
[56:03] on this uh series the seven church ages,
[56:09] the angel of the Lord came and draw a
[56:11] picture.
[56:13] And you can see how the light started
[56:15] going dimmer and dimmer throughout each
[56:18] age.
[56:21] Satan tried to kill the influence of
[56:23] that tree of life.
[56:26] Satan tried to destroy the tree.
[56:29] Satan tried to remove all the lights out
[56:31] of the church.
[56:34] But God says, you know, I will restore.
[56:38] That's what the message is.
[56:41] When God says, "I will restore,"
[56:44] he's talking about sending a prophet for
[56:45] your age.
[56:47] The prophet with the revelation for this
[56:49] season
[56:51] because if you read Psalm chapter one,
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter one, the prophet says that
[56:57] he interprets the scriptures
[57:00] and he says, "Blessed is the man that
[57:01] that meditate on this word day and
[57:03] night."
[57:05] He says, "He shall be planted. He shall
[57:07] be planted like a tree. He shall be like
[57:09] a tree planted
[57:12] &gt;&gt; by the rivers of water
[57:14] and he shall bear his fruit in his
[57:17] season.
[57:18] The prophet says he will bear fruit in
[57:20] the prophet's seasons.
[57:26] So that tree for our age was supposed to
[57:29] bear fruit.
[57:32] But you notice if you read Psalm 31, it
[57:35] says in his season
[57:38] So there are certain fruits,
[57:41] there are certain fruits that you ought
[57:42] to show in this level this year in
[57:44] church age.
[57:48] Certain fruits that could not be
[57:49] displayed in the time of Paul
[57:53] because they had the partial revelation.
[57:57] But Revelation 10 tells us that when the
[58:01] ministry of Malachi 4 begins to sound
[58:05] and you have the perfect revelation of
[58:07] the word
[58:09] because all the mysteries will be
[58:11] revealed
[58:15] a message of restoration.
[58:18] Let's get back into the the scriptures.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; So we just read Zechariah chapter 4.
[58:27] It's a type. It's a type of restoration.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; And I'll give you the what happens in
[58:33] that uh the preview of that chapter.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; So after Jeremiah prophesied that the
[58:39] children of Israel, Israel will go into
[58:41] captivity.
[58:45] They went to Babylon.
[58:48] And then after after that captivity,
[58:50] they they were supposed to go back to
[58:51] their land.
[58:55] So the king Nebuchadnezzar,
[58:58] the Babylonian king,
[59:00] he had destroyed the first temple,
[59:04] you know. And after they went they came
[59:06] back from captivity.
[59:08] They wanted to rebuild the uh the the
[59:10] the house of God.
[59:13] They wanted to rebuild the place where
[59:15] the glory of God will come.
[59:18] They wanted to restore the temple,
[59:22] you know. And that's what happens in the
[59:24] book of Zechariah.
[59:26] They had a prince called Zerubbabel.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; The sacri the the high priest was uh I
[59:36] believe Joshua.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then the the Zerubbabel was
[59:42] the prince tasked with rebuilding the
[59:44] house of the Lord.
[59:51] Yeah. And uh let's go to Ezra chapter 3.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; The book of Ezra chapter 3.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.
[1:00:10] It's after the after 2 Chronicles.
[1:00:14] So I'm just going back as to what is
[1:00:17] happening in rebuilding the temple
[1:00:23] because we know that God is Christ is
[1:00:25] building a church.
[1:00:29] Christ is building another temple.
[1:00:34] But this time this temple is not built
[1:00:36] by by man
[1:00:39] you know because he says what househ
[1:00:42] which house will you build me?
[1:00:45] He cannot dwell in a house made by hands
[1:00:47] of men.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; He has to dwell in a temple.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; So that's what the message of of the
[1:00:55] hour was doing, restoring that temple.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet preached on the
[1:01:01] message the the statue of a perfect man.
[1:01:06] So, Ezra chapter 3 verse one,
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "And when the seventh
[1:01:14] month was come and the children of
[1:01:17] Israel were in the cities, the people
[1:01:19] gathered themselves together as one man
[1:01:21] to Jerusalem.
[1:01:35] Then stood up Joshua the son of Joak and
[1:01:38] his brethren the priest and Zerubbabel
[1:01:41] the son of Shel and his brethren and
[1:01:45] build the altar of the God of Israel to
[1:01:48] offer burnt offerings thereof thereon as
[1:01:51] it is written in the law of Moses the
[1:01:53] man of God.
[1:01:56] Jose.
[1:02:02] [Music]
[1:02:17] So before rebuilding the and I cannot
[1:02:19] really hear myself well. Before
[1:02:21] rebuilding the temple of the Lord,
[1:02:26] the first step was to restore the altar.
[1:02:31] They had to build an altar to the God of
[1:02:33] Israel.
[1:02:36] In order for you to get anywhere with
[1:02:38] God,
[1:02:41] the first step is to restore the altar.
[1:02:46] Is to what is the altar? The prophet in
[1:02:48] the message Christianity versus
[1:02:50] idolatry,
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; he said, "May he be the one that fills
[1:02:58] their temple.
[1:03:02] Then the power of fire
[1:03:07] of the Holy Ghost will fall on the altar
[1:03:09] of their heart."
[1:03:12] He says there is where the real altar is
[1:03:17] is on the heart of each individual.
[1:03:21] The real altar is not up here.
[1:03:24] The real altar is in each and every one
[1:03:27] of your hearts.
[1:03:29] So when so God is God wants to rebuild
[1:03:32] you.
[1:03:34] God this message is rebuilding you into
[1:03:36] becoming in the stature of a perfect
[1:03:38] man.
[1:03:40] But the first step that needs to be done
[1:03:45] is you need to work on your heart.
[1:03:47] You need to examine your heart. Is your
[1:03:50] heart right with God.
[1:03:53] That's why in Ezekiel God said, you
[1:03:56] know, a new heart will I give you
[1:04:01] and then I will put a new spirit in you.
[1:04:05] Then I will put my spirit within you.
[1:04:08] God starts with your heart first. You
[1:04:11] have to work on your heart.
[1:04:14] Do you have any bitterness towards
[1:04:16] anyone?
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; If you have any bitterness towards
[1:04:19] anyone, you will not go forward with
[1:04:21] God. You will just be stuck in a loop.
[1:04:25] You know, s cycle upon cycles,
[1:04:29] you know. Work on your heart first this
[1:04:32] morning. Examine yourself. Lord, examine
[1:04:35] my heart. If there be anything in me
[1:04:38] that's not like you, take it out of me.
[1:04:44] That's why also in Acts chapter 2,
[1:04:47] Peter also told them after they they
[1:04:50] received the Holy Ghost, they said what
[1:04:53] shall we do? Then Peter said repent.
[1:04:58] So first work on your heart. But you
[1:05:01] know even before Peter who told them to
[1:05:03] tell them to repent
[1:05:06] the Bible says they were pricricked in
[1:05:08] their hearts.
[1:05:12] That word means to be saddened you know
[1:05:15] to be hurt
[1:05:17] by what you did.
[1:05:19] So Peter had preached a word
[1:05:22] that so convicted their heart.
[1:05:26] But now we have believers that come to
[1:05:27] church Sunday after Sunday.
[1:05:30] They hear the word of God, but they go
[1:05:33] out as if nothing happens in their
[1:05:35] heart.
[1:05:37] The word of God condemns the sin in
[1:05:39] their lives.
[1:05:41] No, they don't have any pricked heart,
[1:05:45] no sadness for the sin that you are
[1:05:47] doing.
[1:05:49] The believers has has become comfortable
[1:05:51] with sin.
[1:05:53] The message came to take us back to
[1:05:55] Pentecost.
[1:05:58] This message came to take us back to
[1:05:59] where your heart can be priced again.
[1:06:03] God says, "I will remove that stony art
[1:06:06] out of you.
[1:06:08] Then I will give you a heart of flesh."
[1:06:12] Why? Because the heart of flesh can be
[1:06:14] pricricked.
[1:06:15] Lord, I come to church Sunday after
[1:06:17] Sunday,
[1:06:19] but the word does not convict me. You
[1:06:22] need to pray to God. You need to ask him
[1:06:24] to give you a heart of flesh
[1:06:27] because you will not go anywhere with
[1:06:29] God in that condition.
[1:06:31] This morning, there are people with a
[1:06:33] stony heart.
[1:06:35] There are people that have been coming
[1:06:36] to church years after years
[1:06:39] and no change has been happening in your
[1:06:41] life. That's not the message of the
[1:06:44] hour. The message of the hour keeps on
[1:06:46] taking you from glory to glory.
[1:06:49] The message of the hour is here to
[1:06:51] change your lives.
[1:06:53] The message of the hour is here to bring
[1:06:55] God in reality.
[1:06:58] We read last time that he brings the
[1:06:59] pillar of fire in the church.
[1:07:02] What is the pillar of fire? God is a
[1:07:04] consuming fire.
[1:07:07] A consuming fire burns everything that's
[1:07:09] on its way. But how come in your life
[1:07:12] things have not been burnt?
[1:07:15] The thing is you even know what those
[1:07:17] things are.
[1:07:19] You cannot lie to yourself. This morning
[1:07:22] you are sitting in this church very
[1:07:23] comfortable but you know that you are
[1:07:26] not right with God. Whoever you might be
[1:07:29] you need to repent.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; You need to repent because you will not
[1:07:35] go anywhere with God. The message of the
[1:07:38] hour came to make us repent
[1:07:41] to turn from our evil ways. The Bible
[1:07:44] says that when you will turn from your
[1:07:46] evil ways, then you will pray unto me.
[1:07:50] Then you will pray unto me and I will
[1:07:53] hear your prayers.
[1:07:55] Then you will seek me with all your
[1:07:57] heart and you will find me. Yes, you
[1:08:01] haven't found God yet
[1:08:04] because you have not turned from your
[1:08:06] evil ways. The word of God cannot lie.
[1:08:10] The word of God cannot lie. Repent.
[1:08:13] That's what the message of Malachi 4
[1:08:15] was. Brother tells us that repentance
[1:08:19] is making a U-turn.
[1:08:21] Brother tells us that true repentance
[1:08:24] is not just saying I am sorry. No, there
[1:08:27] are people that say I'm sorry every day.
[1:08:30] There are people every morning they say
[1:08:32] I am sorry. But you keep on repeating
[1:08:34] the same sin day after day. Your saying
[1:08:38] I'm sorry doesn't mean anything to God.
[1:08:40] God wants your actions.
[1:08:43] God wants you to make a U-turn
[1:08:46] because that's what Malachi 4 says
[1:08:49] to take us back.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; So it means to make a U-turn and
[1:08:55] returning to Pentecost.
[1:08:59] We need to repent.
[1:09:04] That's the first step in getting
[1:09:05] anywhere with God.
[1:09:10] How do you repent?
[1:09:13] Revelation 2:5,
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[1:09:18] "Remember therefore from whence thou are
[1:09:20] fallen."
[1:09:22] Revelation 2 verse 5.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Remember therefore from whence thou art
[1:09:29] fallen.
[1:09:33] 25
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; and repent
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; and do the first works
[1:09:45] or else I will come unto thee quickly
[1:09:49] and I will remove that candlestick out
[1:09:51] of you out of his place
[1:09:55] except thou repent.
[1:09:58] So God is showing us how to repent here.
[1:10:01] What is the first step? remember from
[1:10:03] whence thou are fallen.
[1:10:06] The prophet says if you want to get
[1:10:08] anywhere, if you if you left God
[1:10:10] somewhere, in order to for you to find
[1:10:11] him, you need to go back where you left
[1:10:13] God.
[1:10:17] Remember from where they are fallen.
[1:10:21] And if you are having an amnesia where
[1:10:23] you cannot remember,
[1:10:25] ask God to revive your mind. Lord, help
[1:10:29] me remember from where I left you.
[1:10:32] Lord, help me find you back where I left
[1:10:34] you. Because you will go look him
[1:10:37] anywhere else. He will not be found. You
[1:10:41] will only find Jesus where you left him.
[1:10:44] Mary and Joseph were walking with Jesus.
[1:10:48] Mary and Joseph, they were walking with
[1:10:49] Jesus.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; And they thought that they were with
[1:10:53] Jesus.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; But where did they find him? They found
[1:10:58] him back where they left him.
[1:11:02] Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:11:04] forever. So the first step in your
[1:11:06] repentance is you need to even know the
[1:11:09] sin that you committed.
[1:11:12] You don't just go to God and just be
[1:11:13] like, "Lord, forgive me for everything."
[1:11:16] That's not the kind of repentance that
[1:11:18] God wants.
[1:11:19] God wants you to know exactly what you
[1:11:22] did.
[1:11:24] I I read even a place where the prophet
[1:11:26] even uh says that I don't believe in
[1:11:28] repentance without reparation.
[1:11:34] So which means that if you have done
[1:11:36] something bad to a brother or a sister
[1:11:40] you cannot just go to God and say God
[1:11:42] forgive me.
[1:11:44] Brother says God will not even hear you.
[1:11:49] you know, you have to go back to that
[1:11:51] person
[1:11:52] and tell them that forgive me.
[1:11:56] I don't remember what message that was.
[1:11:57] If I find it, I'll share with you. You
[1:12:00] know, the prophet says you have to go
[1:12:02] back to that person that you hurt
[1:12:06] and also the way you repent to that
[1:12:09] person matters.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Let's say for instance, you um you said
[1:12:15] some lies about the brother or sister.
[1:12:21] you know you said some terrible things
[1:12:23] about that person
[1:12:26] then the best thing to do it's not just
[1:12:29] to go to the person say
[1:12:31] you know brother sister forgive me I
[1:12:34] just made a lie you know you know
[1:12:36] sometime we lie here and then
[1:12:39] but we cool you know like sorry about
[1:12:42] that sorry
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; that's not a a a a true repentance
[1:12:48] That's not a sincere repentance.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; When you repent like that, God will not
[1:12:56] even hear you because you might be able
[1:12:59] to fool that person,
[1:13:02] but you cannot fool God. God knows that
[1:13:05] you haven't truly repented.
[1:13:09] So the best way to repent,
[1:13:11] I'll just use the example that the
[1:13:12] prophet used. He said, let's say if I
[1:13:15] cheated on my wife,
[1:13:19] He said I wouldn't just go to her and
[1:13:20] say, "Hey, you know, forgive me, you
[1:13:23] know, like like in in just in a very
[1:13:25] weird way,
[1:13:27] you know." Yes. He wouldn't say stuff
[1:13:29] like that. He said, "I I would say
[1:13:33] I understand that what I'm about to tell
[1:13:35] you
[1:13:37] may mean that we we probably never walk
[1:13:39] together again."
[1:13:44] So you understand the gravity of what
[1:13:45] you did.
[1:13:48] And then he asked for forgiveness.
[1:13:51] Forgive me.
[1:13:52] And if you choose to never walk with me
[1:13:54] again, I understand.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; That's what true repentance is.
[1:14:03] So we have people here, they come
[1:14:05] nothing but their blood. You raise your
[1:14:06] hand to God,
[1:14:10] you know, singing, worshiping God. They
[1:14:13] said, "I believe the message of Malachi
[1:14:14] 4. You come, you rejoice,
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; but God is not in your rejoicing."
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says they had to build
[1:14:25] the altar first. They had to restore the
[1:14:28] altar. So you have to return
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; and make your life right with God.
[1:14:36] Make your heart right with God.
[1:14:40] The Bible says that if your heart
[1:14:41] condemns you not
[1:14:45] then we have confidence in God.
[1:14:48] So you cannot have faith in God if you
[1:14:50] have sin in your life.
[1:14:54] After service go home examine re re
[1:14:58] reflect on your life.
[1:15:01] If there's anything that comes up,
[1:15:04] something where you let some loose ends
[1:15:06] somewhere,
[1:15:08] this is a message of restoration, we are
[1:15:11] restoring the altar of God. And I'm
[1:15:13] talking about your heart, each and every
[1:15:15] one of your hearts.
[1:15:18] Go make that right with that person.
[1:15:23] You go to God
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; and you ask him to forgive you.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet said in the in the
[1:15:32] book the the the Ephesian Ephesian
[1:15:34] church age
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; he said
[1:15:40] God tells them to remember
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; evidently something had left had left
[1:15:47] their mind left their minds.
[1:15:51] So he's talking about the same scripture
[1:15:52] we just read.
[1:15:54] So he's saying that evidently some they
[1:15:56] had forgotten something.
[1:15:58] Yeah. He even say they had forgotten
[1:16:00] something.
[1:16:02] He told them to turn back in their minds
[1:16:04] to their point of origin.
[1:16:11] You know like some of the parents here
[1:16:13] sitting this morning
[1:16:16] and sometime I hear you telling stories
[1:16:19] how you used to be on fire for God.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; You would even walk kilometers to go to
[1:16:25] church. You would walk a lot of
[1:16:27] kilometers to go to church.
[1:16:31] You you were burning for the message of
[1:16:33] the hour.
[1:16:35] The message was precious in your heart.
[1:16:39] I heard even stories how back in the com
[1:16:41] they used to not have all the message uh
[1:16:43] initially
[1:16:45] all the message books.
[1:16:47] So it's like when someone gets a hold of
[1:16:49] one book,
[1:16:52] they hide it very preciously,
[1:16:56] you know, but now we have all the
[1:16:58] messages on the table on your phones on
[1:17:02] YouTube.
[1:17:05] But some people the last time you listen
[1:17:06] to a message was probably a month ago.
[1:17:12] Whoever you are this morning,
[1:17:16] somehow you have forgotten something.
[1:17:21] That's what the prophet said.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Evidently something had left their
[1:17:25] minds. What? What is going on?
[1:17:28] Is it the US?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; You have been increased with goods like
[1:17:34] Leodicia says,
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; you know, it's the spirit of Leodia
[1:17:40] that's catching up with you now.
[1:17:42] Because the Bible says you have been
[1:17:44] increased with goods and you said we
[1:17:47] know we don't need anything anymore. You
[1:17:49] don't understand the the message doesn't
[1:17:52] mean anything to you anymore. God has
[1:17:54] blessed you so much. He has given you
[1:17:56] cars. He has given you businesses. You
[1:18:00] know he has given you children.
[1:18:03] And now
[1:18:04] you don't listen to the prophet anymore.
[1:18:09] prophet. I don't know how you're going
[1:18:10] to make it to the rapture.
[1:18:13] You need to listen to the prophet
[1:18:16] because it will build up your body for
[1:18:17] the rapture.
[1:18:19] My word will fail. You know my world, my
[1:18:23] word will fail, but God's word, the
[1:18:27] prophet's word will never fail.
[1:18:31] feed on that word.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; The origin of the So the prophet says
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; um
[1:18:39] he says let those who name his name
[1:18:42] depart from sin
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; and keep their vessels pure for God.
[1:18:55] Depart from sin.
[1:18:58] This morning I'm crying out to you,
[1:18:59] depart from sin.
[1:19:02] Let today be the last day you ever
[1:19:04] commit that sin.
[1:19:06] Make it your resolution to God that God,
[1:19:08] by your grace, this is the last day. You
[1:19:11] have promised me a life of prosperity in
[1:19:13] the word
[1:19:16] and Satan has stole it from me.
[1:19:19] This morning I'm taking that back.
[1:19:22] You have promised me victory.
[1:19:24] We have come to church and singing
[1:19:26] victory in the name of Jesus.
[1:19:29] This morning I am taking back that
[1:19:32] victory in my life. You have promised me
[1:19:34] salvation
[1:19:36] this morning. I am taking back that
[1:19:39] salvation. You know you have promised me
[1:19:42] the Holy Ghost
[1:19:44] this morning. I am taking back the Holy
[1:19:47] Ghost for me. The prophet says that
[1:19:49] there was one thing that kept him from
[1:19:51] giving his life to God from a young age.
[1:19:55] And he was a demon.
[1:19:57] You know, if that demon could keep the
[1:19:59] prophet, he will also keep you.
[1:20:02] But then this morning, make it your
[1:20:04] resolution.
[1:20:06] Today is the last day.
[1:20:09] Satan, I am done with you. I am a son
[1:20:12] and daughter of God.
[1:20:15] I am here to take back what I need. Take
[1:20:19] back what belongs to me.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Brothers, what does belong to you?
[1:20:24] Healing belongs to you. Salvation
[1:20:26] belongs to you. You know nothing can
[1:20:29] stand against you when you believe the
[1:20:32] word of God. God belongs to you.
[1:20:36] If you stand on the word of God,
[1:20:39] nothing will harm you. That belongs to
[1:20:42] you. You know salvation of your
[1:20:45] children. That belongs to you as
[1:20:47] parents. When you pray and God says if
[1:20:50] you ask anything in my name I will give
[1:20:52] it to you that belongs to you. So
[1:20:56] somehow Satan has stole that from you.
[1:21:01] You got to be sick and tired of that.
[1:21:04] You got to be like shame God. Shame God
[1:21:07] the enemy came
[1:21:09] and was still stealing all the crops
[1:21:11] from Shamgard.
[1:21:14] But one day shame God had enough of it.
[1:21:18] One day shame God had enough of it. He
[1:21:21] says, "God, you are blessing me with all
[1:21:23] these crops." But somehow the enemy is
[1:21:26] coming and stealing everything. And same
[1:21:29] God took a stick, you know, and out and
[1:21:32] he went and he beat all the Philistines.
[1:21:35] You know, the stick was not strong
[1:21:37] enough. But it's because same God was
[1:21:40] tired of the enemy.
[1:21:42] It's because same God wants like enough
[1:21:44] and enough.
[1:21:46] All these blessings belongs to me. I
[1:21:48] serve a living God. And because same God
[1:21:52] had enough of the devil.
[1:21:54] God stood in that stick. God became his
[1:21:57] strength. God will back you up. If you
[1:22:01] are tired of the enemy, God will back
[1:22:04] you up. If you are tired of the enemy,
[1:22:08] whatever you are this morning, he says,
[1:22:09] "I'm tired of you.
[1:22:12] You have been fighting me for years and
[1:22:14] years and years. I've been losing
[1:22:17] battles. You have come into my house.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; You have taken everything that God has
[1:22:22] given to me. I prayed to God and he's
[1:22:24] not even hearing my prayers anymore.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; I am tired of you.
[1:22:29] Take it back. I promise you in the name
[1:22:33] of Jesus Christ that Jesus will stand
[1:22:35] with you.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus will will fight your battles for
[1:22:39] you. But you ought to be tired of Satan.
[1:22:42] You ought to be tired of the spirit of
[1:22:43] alcohol. You ought to be tired of the
[1:22:45] spirit of pornography. You have to be
[1:22:48] tired of the spirit of lust. That's only
[1:22:51] then that God steps in.
[1:22:53] Young men, this morning you are fighting
[1:22:56] your battles alone and you have to be
[1:22:59] tired this morning. Let tonight, let
[1:23:02] this morning be the day that is the last
[1:23:05] day that the enemy has victory over you.
[1:23:08] God is looking for witnesses.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; God is looking for people that will say
[1:23:13] that the message of the hour is alive
[1:23:15] and well this morning.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; God is looking for people that will say
[1:23:20] that I I cry out to the Lord and he
[1:23:23] heard my prayer. God is looking for some
[1:23:26] people that will say, "I have been young
[1:23:30] and now I'm old, but I've never seen a
[1:23:33] righteous forsaken."
[1:23:35] God is looking for some people that will
[1:23:38] say that every time I ask God something,
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; he has given that to me. God has given
[1:23:44] you prosperity. Take it back. God has
[1:23:47] given you health. Take it back. God has
[1:23:51] given you increase in your life, in your
[1:23:54] financials. Take it back. God did not
[1:23:58] intend for you to be poor.
[1:24:00] You are to take it back.
[1:24:03] God did not intend for you to be
[1:24:04] miserable. Take it back. God did not
[1:24:08] intend for you to have anxiety. Take it
[1:24:11] back. Satan, take your hands off of
[1:24:14] God's property. In the name of Jesus
[1:24:17] Christ, I rebuke the spirit of anxiety.
[1:24:21] In the name of Jesus Christ, I rebuke
[1:24:23] the spirit of depression. In the name of
[1:24:26] Jesus Christ, I rebuke the spirit of
[1:24:28] lust. Why? Because the messenger is
[1:24:31] restoring you. These are sons and
[1:24:34] daughters of God that God has redeemed
[1:24:38] and he has kept vindicating with a pill
[1:24:41] of fire that he has redeemed you. So
[1:24:44] Satan has no right over you.
[1:24:47] Satan has no right over you.
[1:24:50] Satan has lost all his right at Calvary.
[1:24:55] Jesus said it is finished. That means
[1:24:58] everything I need it is finished.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; I need healing. It is finished.
[1:25:03] By his stripes I am healed.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; By his stripes I am healed. You know he
[1:25:09] was bruised for my iniquities.
[1:25:12] Everything that I need. Jesus has
[1:25:15] supplied.
[1:25:17] Jesus is my everything. Jesus is
[1:25:20] everything that I need. He's more than
[1:25:22] life to me. He's more than cars or money
[1:25:25] or women.
[1:25:27] Jesus is everything that this world
[1:25:29] could give. He's more than that.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Take Jesus in your life. Invite the word
[1:25:36] in your life. Invite the word in your
[1:25:38] life and Satan has to flee.
[1:25:43] Amen.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; You have to be tired of the enemy
[1:25:46] kicking you.
[1:25:48] God is directing me this way and I'll
[1:25:49] just keep talking about it.
[1:25:52] Somehow I'm feeling that there are
[1:25:53] demons here
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; that are afflicting the believers have
[1:25:58] been afflicting you for years after
[1:26:00] years after years
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; and you just cannot seem to be set free.
[1:26:06] You have cried out to God. You have
[1:26:07] prayed and prayed but you just cannot
[1:26:10] seem to be set free.
[1:26:13] Then God is looking for a shame God
[1:26:16] this morning.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; If Lord I don't care. I'm going to lay
[1:26:21] down here this morning. If my if they
[1:26:24] they they they kill me here.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; If my bones are here, I am going to stay
[1:26:29] here till I die. My God, I am resolved.
[1:26:33] I am desperate for you, Lord. You are to
[1:26:36] be desperate for God.
[1:26:40] Amen.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; You are to be desperate for God
[1:26:45] because when you are desperate for God,
[1:26:47] he comes to your rescue. When you are
[1:26:50] desperate for God, then he becomes the
[1:26:52] fourth man in your fires.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus becomes the fourth man in your
[1:26:56] battles.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Then you are no longer fighting your
[1:26:59] battles alone.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Then he comes to rescue you.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Let those who depart from sin look at
[1:27:12] once you once were in your heart
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; and mind and in your life
[1:27:21] then go back to it. That's what the
[1:27:25] prophet is saying.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; This is very important. Listen to me.
[1:27:29] Look at what you once were in your
[1:27:31] heart.
[1:27:34] Where where you remember that that day
[1:27:36] or that morning, that night that God
[1:27:38] saved you.
[1:27:40] You remember that day that you received
[1:27:42] the message of the hour in your life.
[1:27:46] Look what you once were.
[1:27:49] Not just in your mind, but in your life.
[1:27:53] You remember how you used to be on fire
[1:27:54] for God. The prophet says look back in
[1:27:57] that position
[1:27:59] and he says then go back to me
[1:28:03] and what is the way back.
[1:28:06] The way is the way of repentance.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; We don't want preachers that preach a
[1:28:12] sermon with that doesn't prick people's
[1:28:14] heart.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to just make you happy.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Judgment starts in the house of the
[1:28:21] Lord. True happiness is to be all right
[1:28:24] with God.
[1:28:26] If you if if you are happy the in the
[1:28:29] condition that you are right now,
[1:28:32] I just hope you are correct in your life
[1:28:34] with God. But if you are not
[1:28:38] happy, I don't know what kind of
[1:28:40] happiness is that. That's definitely the
[1:28:43] devil's happiness.
[1:28:46] But remember, the devil's happiness is
[1:28:48] just for a short time.
[1:28:52] You will be happy for 5, 10, 15 years.
[1:28:57] But one day,
[1:28:59] the devil, the Bible says he comes to
[1:29:01] kill, steal, and destroy.
[1:29:04] One day, he's going to destroy you. You
[1:29:07] don't play with the devil.
[1:29:10] Don't play with the devil.
[1:29:15] If you know, if you read uh in in
[1:29:17] Genesis,
[1:29:19] you know when when mankind fell,
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; God started talking to Adam and Eve
[1:29:28] and he came to Adam because the has done
[1:29:30] no he said he told Adam why have you
[1:29:32] done this thing? He says the wife that
[1:29:34] you've given me. Then God goes to Eve
[1:29:37] and he spoke he speaks to Eve.
[1:29:41] He went to even if he's the serpent
[1:29:43] life.
[1:29:46] But you notice that when God went to the
[1:29:47] serpent, he did not even I want to have
[1:29:50] a conversation with the serpent.
[1:29:53] He says because thou has done this
[1:29:55] thing.
[1:29:58] So have the attitude of God.
[1:30:01] Have a conversation with the devil.
[1:30:04] Play with the devil.
[1:30:06] Put the devil right in the place that he
[1:30:08] belongs.
[1:30:10] He's a devil. He's a tormentor. So when
[1:30:13] Satan comes to him, Satan in the name of
[1:30:15] Jesus Christ go. I'm not even going to
[1:30:18] bargain with you or have a conversation.
[1:30:22] You remember that the prophet talks to
[1:30:23] the story of that lady.
[1:30:26] You are saved and then she went too
[1:30:29] close to the devil. She went back to a
[1:30:31] to a bar.
[1:30:34] She wanted to have a conversation with
[1:30:36] the devil.
[1:30:39] And the devil got her.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean sometimes it doesn't
[1:30:43] mean you are you are not saved.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; You just you got like song you got too
[1:30:49] close to the cross.
[1:30:54] It's a it's it's a very dangerous place.
[1:30:59] The prophet says
[1:31:02] repent quickly.
[1:31:04] still the same.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Don't hesitate.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; You see the prophet is even saying
[1:31:11] quickly.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we linger too long.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; You commit something in your heart, you
[1:31:20] know, something is checking me.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; But sometimes because of pride,
[1:31:26] you don't want to make it right.
[1:31:29] Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; But the messenger is saying
[1:31:34] repent quickly.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; So that means when you do something bad,
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; the moment God puts that in your heart,
[1:31:42] excuse me.
[1:31:44] If you if you call Paul says I die
[1:31:47] daily.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't say I die yearly or monthly.
[1:31:53] Daily, every day, quickly. I do
[1:31:55] something bad, Lord. I want to die.
[1:31:59] Don't hesitate. If you are hesitating
[1:32:02] this morning, don't hesitate.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll just skip.
[1:32:14] Okay, let me just let me not skip. So,
[1:32:16] the prophet says, you know, uh evidently
[1:32:19] Ephesus did hesitate for her lifespan
[1:32:22] was not very long.
[1:32:25] Um if if Ephesis
[1:32:33] the glory of God decreased ever so
[1:32:36] rapidly.
[1:32:39] You see why the glory of God has
[1:32:41] decreased in your life.
[1:32:44] You have now repented quickly.
[1:32:47] You still have some unconfessed sins in
[1:32:49] your life. The Bible says that he that
[1:32:52] hides his sins prosperth not.
[1:32:57] No, the Bible says that he that hides
[1:33:00] his sins prospers not.
[1:33:08] The prophet says,
[1:33:13] it does not mean that she could not have
[1:33:15] repented.
[1:33:18] It does not mean that we cannot repent.
[1:33:21] We can, but it must be quicker.
[1:33:27] That's the prophet. It's in the Ephesus
[1:33:30] church age book.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet says we must now we might
[1:33:38] repent quickly.
[1:33:41] It must be a true heart cry to God in
[1:33:47] then God will restore.
[1:33:52] I want God to restore his glory in your
[1:33:54] life,
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; but you must repent.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; So, let's go back to Ezra chapter the
[1:34:05] same chapter, chapter three.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; If I don't finish it, which most likely
[1:34:14] I will not, I'll continue it next time.
[1:34:18] Verse
[1:34:19] verse 10, chapter 3, verse 10. Ezra,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; and when the builders laid the
[1:34:26] foundation of the temple of the Lord,
[1:34:28] they set the priest in their apparel
[1:34:30] with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons
[1:34:33] of Asafat, with symbols to praise the
[1:34:35] Lord after the ordinance of David, king
[1:34:38] of Israel.
[1:34:41] Ezra chapter 3 verse 10.
[1:34:46] Mercedes.
[1:35:00] First
[1:35:14] trumpet. Verse
[1:35:30] 11. And they sang together by course in
[1:35:33] praising and giving thanks unto the Lord
[1:35:35] because he is good for his mercy
[1:35:36] endureth forever towards Israel. And all
[1:35:39] the people shouted with a great shout
[1:35:42] when they praised the Lord because the
[1:35:43] foundation of the house of the Lord was
[1:35:45] laid.
[1:36:08] So you notice that they rejoice because
[1:36:10] the foundation of the house of the Lord
[1:36:12] was laid.
[1:36:16] And we know we know what the prophet
[1:36:18] tells us what the foundation is. It's
[1:36:20] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:26] And then verse 12, but many of the
[1:36:27] priests and Levites and chief of the
[1:36:28] fathers, who were ancient men that had
[1:36:31] seen the first house, when the the
[1:36:32] foundation of this house was laid before
[1:36:34] their eyes, wept with a loud voice, and
[1:36:37] many shouted aloud for joy.
[1:36:56] And then verse 13, so that the people
[1:36:58] could not discern the noise of the
[1:37:01] shouts of joy from the noise of the
[1:37:03] weeping of the people. For the people
[1:37:05] shouted with a loud shout, and the noise
[1:37:07] was heard a far off.
[1:37:23] So you notice here in verse 13
[1:37:26] that it says again that the people could
[1:37:28] not discern the noise of the shouts from
[1:37:30] the noise of the weeping.
[1:37:36] So there was so it was an uncertain
[1:37:38] sound.
[1:37:40] You know that's how the prophet preached
[1:37:42] on the message the uncertain sound.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; They could not discern the noise. What
[1:37:48] is this? A shout of joy? Is this like
[1:37:50] it's an uncertain sound?
[1:37:53] And you notice it was around the laying
[1:37:55] of the foundation of the house of the
[1:37:57] Lord.
[1:37:59] So the uncertain sound comes around the
[1:38:01] the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:06] That's why we see that in the na council
[1:38:13] you know there was also discussion
[1:38:15] revolving that foundation of the of the
[1:38:17] lord
[1:38:20] which was the deity of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:23] There was confusion around the name of
[1:38:25] the lordus
[1:38:27] and now they made it father son and holy
[1:38:29] ghost. So God is building a spiritual
[1:38:32] temple.
[1:38:34] God is building a spiritual house.
[1:38:37] And we also see that after they lay the
[1:38:38] foundation,
[1:38:41] then there is an uncertain sound.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; And if we if we go to
[1:38:51] Ezra chapter 4,
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; I'll paraphrase. This is still happening
[1:38:57] before Zechariah 4.
[1:39:04] So like I'll probably paraphrase. So in
[1:39:06] in uh uh Ezra chapter 4, so there the
[1:39:09] children of Israel while they were
[1:39:11] building the house of the Lord,
[1:39:15] there came adversity from the enemy.
[1:39:20] They wanted to join with the believers.
[1:39:24] Verse two says, "Let us build with you,
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; for we seek your God."
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Verse two, chapter
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; 4,
[1:39:47] you know. Yeah. For we seek your God as
[1:39:49] you do.
[1:39:53] And we do sacrifice unto him since the
[1:39:56] days of Ezeradon, king of Asher, which
[1:39:59] brought us up hither.
[1:40:11] We were saying that we are the same as
[1:40:13] you. You don't have to go to higher
[1:40:16] ground tabernacle. You don't have to
[1:40:18] believe the message of the hour. We all
[1:40:20] serve the same God. You know, we pay
[1:40:23] tithing like you guys do. We pray in the
[1:40:26] morning. We pray on Sundays. Can we not
[1:40:29] join?
[1:40:32] You know, the prophet warned us against
[1:40:33] that spirit.
[1:40:35] The prophet says that in the end time
[1:40:38] there will be a spirit of unity.
[1:40:41] But that's the mark of the beast.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; The the the U council of all the
[1:40:47] churches will want to get all the
[1:40:49] churches under one
[1:40:52] because let us just build one church.
[1:40:56] Let us just build one church.
[1:40:59] But the prophet says stay away from
[1:41:01] that.
[1:41:02] That's the mark of the beast. There's
[1:41:05] not a circumstance where a believer can
[1:41:07] be joined with an unbeliever.
[1:41:09] circumstance
[1:41:12] calls for total separation from all
[1:41:15] unbelief.
[1:41:19] Not some but all unbelief.
[1:41:22] Your message are not to partake with
[1:41:25] unbelievers
[1:41:27] who don't.
[1:41:30] Do not let them lie to you.
[1:41:33] They don't serve the same God.
[1:41:46] you know the the
[1:42:06] So let's continue reading. that Ezra
[1:42:09] chapter
[1:42:11] 4.
[1:42:15] So we'll see the the response of
[1:42:16] Zerubbabel.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; He was a type of Malachi
[1:42:21] because he was restoring the temple.
[1:42:28] So verse three, the Bible says
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; the same chapter, but Zerubbabel and
[1:42:33] Joshua and the rest of the chief of the
[1:42:34] fathers of Israel said unto them,
[1:42:39] you have nothing to do with us to build
[1:42:41] an house unto our God.
[1:42:54] But we ourselves together will build
[1:42:57] unto the Lord God of Israel.
[1:43:03] So that's that's the response. That's
[1:43:05] the response that the bride will have.
[1:43:09] The bride will have a response of we
[1:43:12] will not join with you.
[1:43:16] You have nothing to do with us.
[1:43:19] Unbelief has nothing to do with the
[1:43:21] believers.
[1:43:23] You ought to separate yourself fully
[1:43:25] from unbelief and because of some
[1:43:27] question.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; So um and so let me just paraphrase what
[1:43:32] happens. So after after Zerubbabel
[1:43:34] answered like that.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; So then the ch those those unbelievers
[1:43:40] show their true colors
[1:43:43] they went to accuse the children of
[1:43:44] Israel to the Babylonian king.
[1:43:49] And then the Babylonian king caused them
[1:43:52] to cease building the house of God
[1:43:58] and they stopped. If you if you go to uh
[1:44:01] Ezra 5:1
[1:44:04] the after they stopped building the
[1:44:06] house of God
[1:44:08] then this is what happens. Ezra 5. Then
[1:44:12] the prophet Hagi the prophet and
[1:44:14] Zachchariah the son of Edu prophesied
[1:44:17] unto the Jews that were in Judah and
[1:44:19] Jerusalem in the name of God even unto
[1:44:22] them.
[1:44:39] So then that's when comes in the book of
[1:44:41] Hagi.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; At this moment when they stop building
[1:44:44] the house of the Lord
[1:44:47] is writing the prophecy that we're going
[1:44:49] to go read
[1:44:51] and also if you notice they also also
[1:44:53] Zechariah prophesied.
[1:44:55] So that's the prophecy of Zechariah
[1:44:57] chapter 4.
[1:45:00] chapter 4. We won't we will not get into
[1:45:02] it because let's go to Haggi chapter one
[1:45:04] and I'll end it with that one.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; 1 verse 1-13.
[1:45:22] Yeah. in the second year of Darius the
[1:45:25] king.
[1:45:28] It's right after it's right before
[1:45:30] Zechariah.
[1:45:32] That's what Malachi Zechariah
[1:45:56] So verse one.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; So in the second year of Darius the king
[1:46:03] in the sixth month in the first day of
[1:46:04] the month came the word of the Lord by
[1:46:06] he the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son
[1:46:09] ofiel.
[1:46:21] And I skip and I skip to verse two. Thus
[1:46:24] speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying,
[1:46:25] "These people say, the time is not come,
[1:46:28] the time that the Lord's house shall be
[1:46:30] built."
[1:46:38] Then came the word of the Lord by Hagi
[1:46:41] the prophet saying, "Is it time for you,
[1:46:43] oh ye to dwell in your seal sealed
[1:46:46] houses,
[1:46:49] and this house lie in waste?
[1:47:04] So he's saying, "Is it time for you
[1:47:06] yourselves to be living in your panled
[1:47:08] houses while this house remains in
[1:47:10] ruin?"
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:17] So the spirit of God was grieved
[1:47:21] that when adversity came, they started
[1:47:24] saying that maybe this is not the time
[1:47:25] to build the house of the Lord.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; And they got very comfortable with their
[1:47:31] own lives that they started building
[1:47:33] their own houses
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:38] while the house of God was remaining in
[1:47:40] ruins.
[1:47:43] If it grieved the spirit of God back
[1:47:45] then, it is grieving it today.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; The house of God, we can talk about
[1:47:52] physic and spiritual spir physically and
[1:47:55] uh spiritual
[1:47:57] you know either this church. God is
[1:48:00] blessing us
[1:48:03] and we are so concerned about our own
[1:48:06] business and houses but we let the house
[1:48:09] of God in rule.
[1:48:11] We don't support the Lord.
[1:48:14] We don't pay our tithing.
[1:48:17] We don't pay our offerings.
[1:48:19] And on the spiritual side, you also
[1:48:21] don't work on your spiritual body.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Everything is just about work. Work. You
[1:48:27] go to work outside. I got to do some
[1:48:29] business. I got to build my house.
[1:48:32] But what about your house where the
[1:48:34] spirit of God is supposed to dwell?
[1:48:37] If you don't take care of it, that
[1:48:39] grieves the spirit of God.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Then look at what God is saying now in
[1:48:45] verse five.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Now this is what the Lord Almighty says.
[1:48:50] Give careful thoughts to your ways. You
[1:48:53] have planted much but harvest little.
[1:49:07] That's what happens when you don't take
[1:49:09] care of the house of God.
[1:49:11] You are working too much but somehow the
[1:49:14] fruits of your labor cannot be seen.
[1:49:18] Somehow the profit is too little.
[1:49:22] You eat but you never have enough.
[1:49:26] You drink but never have your field.
[1:49:29] [Music]
[1:49:32] You are never satisfied.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; I don't understand everything I do. I'm
[1:49:36] just never satisfied.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; You put on clothes but are not warm.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; You earn wages only to put them in a
[1:49:47] purse with holes in it.
[1:49:52] That's that's the Bible.
[1:49:55] when you don't take care of the temple
[1:49:56] of the Lord.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; So it's it's sort of like you are
[1:50:01] working for people out there because all
[1:50:03] your money.
[1:50:06] Amen.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; All your money you're just giving it
[1:50:08] back to the government.
[1:50:12] You work overtime this week.
[1:50:17] Then someone gets sick
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; or the car breaks down
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; or you get a speeding ticket and all
[1:50:24] your overtime money is gone.
[1:50:28] That's the Bible. You earn wages but you
[1:50:31] take those wages and you put that in
[1:50:33] your pockets
[1:50:35] and those pockets have holes.
[1:50:39] Amen.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people,
[1:50:43] you know, I spoke about that in in demon
[1:50:44] the other day. A lot of people lost
[1:50:47] money with the LLC stuff.
[1:50:51] [Music]
[1:50:53] A lot of people lost their money with
[1:50:55] all sort of business that like it's
[1:50:57] because you have not taken care of the
[1:51:00] body of God
[1:51:05] and look at it as a punishment from God
[1:51:08] because he's the same yesterday, today
[1:51:10] and forever.
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:13] No, the Bible says my people die for
[1:51:15] lack of knowledge.
[1:51:21] I've heard people have uh uh invested
[1:51:24] like 20,000 $10,000 into that business
[1:51:29] and everything gone like that. Taking
[1:51:33] loans, everything gone like that.
[1:51:37] You know, it's two reasons according to
[1:51:39] the Bible. One of them is because you
[1:51:42] have laid the house of the Lord in
[1:51:44] ruins.
[1:51:46] You are too concerned about the natural
[1:51:48] things that you forgot about your
[1:51:49] spiritual body.
[1:51:52] Because if you actually took care of
[1:51:54] your spiritual body,
[1:51:56] meaning that you have to eat the word
[1:51:58] for your day,
[1:52:00] you would have wisdom. Let me read you
[1:52:02] what the problem
[1:52:05] about this nonsense business that some
[1:52:07] people get into.
[1:52:12] You know, because we're preaching about
[1:52:13] the message of the hour.
[1:52:16] Let the prophet William Brandon tell
[1:52:19] tell us how to invest,
[1:52:22] what kind of business to get into.
[1:52:27] Let's go to the message. A trumpet gives
[1:52:29] an uncertain sound.
[1:52:33] If you can project that, that'll be
[1:52:34] that'll be nice. Paragraph 49,
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; my people die for lack of knowledge.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; You know, maybe if you actually you were
[1:52:46] very sincere with God and you prayed
[1:52:50] and then you actually listen to the
[1:52:52] message.
[1:52:54] Maybe God would have caused you somehow
[1:52:56] to fall upon this message and you read
[1:52:58] that and that opens your eyes.
[1:53:01] You know the thing is we are too greedy
[1:53:03] for money.
[1:53:06] We just Oh, I I I even heard some one
[1:53:09] one person telling me, "Oh, if you
[1:53:10] invest like 50,000, you'll get like a
[1:53:12] million dollars."
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; I was like, "Oh my god."
[1:53:22] You know, and I went online and I did my
[1:53:24] research
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; and you see that online also says that
[1:53:28] they target a lot of Africans.
[1:53:34] Because they know that Africans we
[1:53:36] tremble before money.
[1:53:39] In African we can't even give up my
[1:53:41] brother for money.
[1:53:45] Imagine you take all your 401k.
[1:53:52] You know, even those billionaires out
[1:53:54] there, they will never make that mistake
[1:53:57] because
[1:54:00] there's a rule to entrepreneurship
[1:54:03] that says only invest in what you are
[1:54:06] comfortable losing.
[1:54:12] If you knew you were going to lose
[1:54:14] 50,000, okay,
[1:54:16] but also be careful. God didn't give you
[1:54:19] 50,000 to just
[1:54:22] The prophet against gambling.
[1:54:25] The prophet preached against gambling.
[1:54:28] You are gambling with God's money. You
[1:54:31] have worked all those over time. The
[1:54:33] prophet. Let me just
[1:54:38] paragraph 49.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; He says, "If you've got a business
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; in which we got businessmen present,
[1:54:46] maybe many of them
[1:54:53] If you are running a business that's not
[1:54:55] certain,
[1:54:58] you are not going to put very much in
[1:55:01] it.
[1:55:04] So the prophet is even preaching you
[1:55:06] entrepreneurship
[1:55:07] or how to start a business.
[1:55:10] If you are not sure about something,
[1:55:14] don't put much in it.
[1:55:18] And he says he gives the reason why. He
[1:55:21] says because the dividend is uncertain
[1:55:26] and you wouldn't make very much
[1:55:28] investment in it.
[1:55:33] Is that the message of the hour? I hope
[1:55:35] you guys can read it over there.
[1:55:37] Or if you are a good shrewd businessman.
[1:55:43] So maybe the reason why you made all
[1:55:45] those investment because you probably
[1:55:46] don't even have the mindset of a
[1:55:48] business.
[1:55:50] I'm just reading the problem because he
[1:55:52] said if you were a good businessman,
[1:55:55] you wouldn't make those mistakes.
[1:55:58] That's why the message is there for
[1:56:03] teach us on how to be parents
[1:56:07] [Music]
[1:56:11] business everything
[1:56:14] even how to drive correctly the prophet
[1:56:17] talks how you
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; he said if you're a good and sure
[1:56:25] business you you will wait and search
[1:56:28] out
[1:56:34] your did you hear about LSC? Oh man,
[1:56:37] look at me. I put 100.
[1:56:39] Okay,
[1:56:41] [Music]
[1:56:42] you also jump into that
[1:56:45] research.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; I would say maybe if you're expecting a
[1:56:49] benefit of like $50, $100. Okay, that's
[1:56:51] one thing.
[1:56:55] So a business that potentially supposed
[1:56:57] to give you millions of dollars and you
[1:56:58] don't even do any research about that
[1:57:05] sounds like message believers
[1:57:07] because a message believer we supposed
[1:57:09] to be the most intelligent because we
[1:57:14] have the most perfect wisdom.
[1:57:17] We are supposed to be better
[1:57:21] as believers. We are supposed to be the
[1:57:22] best workers that go to work
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; because we have the revelation that as I
[1:57:29] go to work as Paul says I'm working as
[1:57:32] if I'm working to Christ
[1:57:38] believer God is God has given me money
[1:57:41] so I don't want to just waste it with
[1:57:42] any uncertainty
[1:57:46] shame
[1:57:48] that's that's a shameful
[1:57:52] But it's okay. We learn from mistakes.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; So if you are a good true business, you
[1:58:01] would wait and search out.
[1:58:05] If you got some money to invest
[1:58:11] until you find something that's certain,
[1:58:17] something that's reliable,
[1:58:20] something that you can depend on.
[1:58:26] Can you depend on LLC?
[1:58:30] Where is he at now?
[1:58:36] something that you can depend on.
[1:58:41] He says because you don't want to lose
[1:58:44] that little money that you've saved up
[1:58:45] for.
[1:58:53] I repeat that again because you don't So
[1:58:56] the prophet is even talking about you
[1:58:57] even knew you would have some savings
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; and he's teaching you how to not waste
[1:59:03] that saving and just
[1:59:08] you don't want to lose that little money
[1:59:10] that you've saved up to
[1:59:14] because with that you have to make your
[1:59:17] living.
[1:59:20] out of the remuneration from the
[1:59:22] dividends that's drawn on this
[1:59:23] investment.
[1:59:27] Why? You have to get something to live
[1:59:29] by
[1:59:32] now. And this little money that you got
[1:59:35] saved up, don't put it in your pocket
[1:59:37] and leave it there.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Lesson number two, according to the
[1:59:45] prophet of the hour,
[1:59:49] Don't keep all your money in your banks.
[1:59:54] Learn how to invest money.
[1:59:58] Learn how to reproduce or
[2:00:02] but you have to be certain in what
[2:00:05] do your research
[2:00:08] says that
[2:00:12] don't put it in your pockets and leave
[2:00:13] there because thieves will steal it.
[2:00:20] I remember during co
[2:00:23] at some points they even wanted to start
[2:00:25] taking our money from our 401ks.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Thieves
[2:00:34] will steal it.
[2:00:37] I hope you on the screen. Can you see
[2:00:38] it?
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; It's on paragraph 50.
[2:00:51] When someone want to take all your
[2:00:53] money,
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; the prophet has a right word for that
[2:00:57] person.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Whether it be the government,
[2:01:05] whether it be anybody else, whether it
[2:01:07] be LLC,
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; he's a thief.
[2:01:13] Imagine
[2:01:14] all the money that you worked up for
[2:01:17] goes over time and some of us work in
[2:01:20] warehouses
[2:01:23] very hard to work there.
[2:01:27] I've worked it's
[2:01:30] imagine you do over time
[2:01:32] your body is tired
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; and you have even people in Africa your
[2:01:38] family members that you could help
[2:01:42] 50,000
[2:01:44] LLC
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; and the guy is just in China chilling on
[2:01:49] his bed
[2:01:51] so you working for him
[2:01:55] that's not that's not the message of the
[2:01:57] hour.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; He says don't do that.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; If you got invested in something,
[2:02:08] do your researches on investing
[2:02:12] business.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Even if you have $20,
[2:02:16] learn how to invest it. There are many,
[2:02:19] many ways of investing money. You can't
[2:02:21] get into crypto. I'm not going to get
[2:02:22] into all that. many ways but just don't
[2:02:26] keep your money just in your bank.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; You know, you know what billionaires do?
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; You know, I used to work for my host dad
[2:02:35] in North North Dakota when I was a
[2:02:36] student in North Dakota.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; He used to build houses.
[2:02:42] They always they always had contract
[2:02:43] after contract. And I was like, "Wow,
[2:02:46] why so many people are buying houses and
[2:02:49] building houses?"
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I was like, "Why? Why would they
[2:02:53] build all these houses?
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; You know what he told me? He says that
[2:02:58] some of them are not building houses to
[2:02:59] live there.
[2:03:02] It's just a way for them to keep their
[2:03:04] money.
[2:03:07] After some time, it's going to produce
[2:03:08] more money.
[2:03:12] You know, when Trump he had to pay, I
[2:03:13] think that was $300 million
[2:03:16] for a case that he had lost. You know
[2:03:18] what?
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Trump is a billionaire.
[2:03:22] But he said he didn't have all the cash.
[2:03:26] I think he said he only had like 50
[2:03:28] million or something like that.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; He didn't have all the 300 million cash.
[2:03:32] He wasn't even in his banks.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Where where was that money? He was in
[2:03:39] businesses, in buildings.
[2:03:43] That's how that's how the billionaire
[2:03:44] keeps their money.
[2:03:48] And we have the prophet also telling us
[2:03:50] the same thing.
[2:03:52] Keep your money in your bank.
[2:03:55] Invest it into something
[2:03:58] you know.
[2:03:59] And it says and then you want to be sure
[2:04:02] of the certainty of your investment.
[2:04:07] If you don't why don't invest it
[2:04:12] uh the so businesses is certainly on a
[2:04:14] shaking and stand tonight.
[2:04:20] I'll just I'll just end it there.
[2:04:24] It it the reason why I read because it
[2:04:26] ties into hey guy
[2:04:30] you put you work so hard and you take
[2:04:32] all your money you put that in a pocket
[2:04:33] with holes
[2:04:38] because of
[2:04:39] you know but we are restoring the altar
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; and in the in the restoring rebuilding
[2:04:47] the temple
[2:04:50] you somehow you have left God somewhere
[2:04:53] You have stopped building the house of
[2:04:54] the Lord
[2:04:57] and now God is saying that you have
[2:04:58] gotten too comfortable
[2:05:02] that now I am going to create LLC.
[2:05:08] Let me let me actually you know what let
[2:05:10] me continue you know because it's God
[2:05:12] you'll see that let me continue chapter
[2:05:14] one
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; where was I yeah verse seven this is
[2:05:19] what the Lord says give careful thought
[2:05:20] to your ways
[2:05:22] okay verse n let's keep to verse n you
[2:05:25] expected much but see it turned out to
[2:05:28] be little
[2:05:30] [Music]
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; you expected millions of dollars from
[2:05:34] your LLC investment it turned out to be
[2:05:36] few
[2:05:40] And look what God is saying now. What
[2:05:43] you brought home, I blew away.
[2:05:48] You know, verse n.
[2:06:01] So say Satan blew it away.
[2:06:05] I God blew it away.
[2:06:10] So I God created LLC
[2:06:14] to blow away all your earnings.
[2:06:20] That's the word.
[2:06:23] So don't so you know don't even be mad
[2:06:25] at the person who introduced LLC to you
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; because God is saying he's the one that
[2:06:34] blew it away.
[2:06:39] Be mad at yourself
[2:06:42] because you have not taken care of the
[2:06:43] vessel of God. You have been too
[2:06:46] comfortable with sin in your life.
[2:06:50] Why? Declares the Lord Almighty. Now God
[2:06:53] explains because of my house.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; You know, you know sometime people they
[2:07:00] pray
[2:07:03] for so long and now
[2:07:16] You get mad and God this is your answer
[2:07:20] away and you ask God why did you blow it
[2:07:24] away?
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Because of my house which remains the
[2:07:28] room
[2:07:31] which each of you is busy with your own
[2:07:34] house.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Lord be merciful to us.
[2:07:42] Therefore, because of you, the heavens
[2:07:44] have withheld their due and the earth
[2:07:46] its crops. You know, I called for a draw
[2:07:49] on the field. And then, okay, I'll just
[2:07:51] end it there.
[2:07:53] [Music]
[2:07:58] And yeah, that's verse 11, it says, I
[2:08:00] call the draw and and all the labor of
[2:08:02] your hands.
[2:08:13] God, that's your answer.
[2:08:16] You know, maybe you have some other
[2:08:17] businesses that you've tried to do that
[2:08:20] failed and that nobody
[2:08:27] take care of the house of God. You may
[2:08:28] stand.
[2:08:31] Put in everything that you do. Put God
[2:08:35] first in everything that you do.
[2:08:38] Pay your tithing.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; I repeat that. Pay your tithing.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; There's another scripture in Malachi 3
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; that God says the same thing.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; He says if you don't pay your tithing.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Now for the tithing it's a little bit
[2:08:55] different
[2:08:57] because there God says that he let the
[2:08:59] enemy come and take all your away.
[2:09:07] Pay your tithing.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Pay your offerings.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; We have believers that even brag about
[2:09:14] not paying tithing.
[2:09:28] The prophet says that when you you you
[2:09:30] choose a church as your church
[2:09:34] support your presence, your money, your
[2:09:37] presence.
[2:09:41] Are you members of higher ground?
[2:09:45] You need to support the church.
[2:09:48] Don't be greedy.
[2:09:50] You all you just want my own house, my
[2:09:52] own
[2:09:55] No,
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; you know, it's going to go from the
[2:09:57] devil to God is going to be again. I'm
[2:09:59] going to blow it away again.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; If you don't repent,
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; even that investment that you're doing
[2:10:08] that it may seem like it's working out.
[2:10:11] If you don't repent,
[2:10:13] God is going to come and blow in.
[2:10:16] That's a warning.
[2:10:19] May God bless you. And I didn't I hope I
[2:10:21] wasn't too harsh.
[2:10:25] I don't know why I just sometimes
[2:10:29] I just have to preach what God gives me.
[2:10:32] Don't be mad at me.
[2:10:36] I pray that we go home and we leave.
[2:10:41] [Music]
[2:10:42] I'm not saying that I'm like I I could I
[2:10:44] almost also got into LLC.
[2:10:49] The Bible says that when you go rebuke
[2:10:51] someone,
[2:10:53] you rebuke with the spirit that Lord
[2:10:54] forgive them because it could have that
[2:10:56] person could have been me.
[2:10:59] So I don't I don't
[2:11:03] but I just know if you take care of the
[2:11:06] temple of God
[2:11:09] first, he will bless you.
[2:11:12] May God bless you.
[2:11:16] [Music]
[2:11:30] May the Lord bless you.
[2:11:33] [Music]
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; While we get into the spirit of prayer,
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; let's sing this one song. There's none.
[2:11:44] It's not like you
[2:11:48] [Music]
[2:12:07] [Music]
[2:12:11] There is none
[2:12:14] like you.
[2:12:18] [Music]
[2:12:22] No one else can touch my heart like you
[2:12:29] do.
[2:12:31] I could search.
[2:12:34] I will search for
[2:12:38] eternity
[2:12:40] till long
[2:12:43] and find
[2:12:46] that there is none
[2:12:49] like
[2:12:51] oh
[2:12:53] there is none like you.
[2:12:57] There is none
[2:13:00] like you. Oh,
[2:13:04] no one else like you.
[2:13:09] No one else can touch my heart like you
[2:13:15] do.
[2:13:17] And I can search.
[2:13:20] I have to search for
[2:13:24] eternity
[2:13:26] all
[2:13:29] and find
[2:13:31] that there is none
[2:13:34] like you.
[2:13:38] There is none like you.
[2:13:42] There is no one like you.
[2:13:49] No one else like you.
[2:13:54] No one else can I smile
[2:13:58] like you do.
[2:14:02] And I can search you. I could search for
[2:14:09] eternity
[2:14:11] long
[2:14:13] and mine
[2:14:15] that is
[2:14:19] like one more time.
[2:14:22] Oh, there in the like you
[2:14:27] there is no
[2:14:30] like you.
[2:14:34] No one else like you.
[2:14:38] No one else can smile like you do.
[2:14:46] And I can search.
[2:14:49] I can search for all
[2:14:53] eternity
[2:14:56] long
[2:14:58] and find.
[2:15:01] There is no
[2:15:03] I do.
[2:15:08] Oh yes, I know he was a blood. I know. I
[2:15:16] know he was the
[2:15:20] I know. I know he was the blood
[2:15:26] for me.
[2:15:30] Oh yes for me one day when I was born
