[52:12] I don't figure geppu city to me if was
[52:15] on a Leon scavenger pepper
[52:17] and let me tell you the Covenant was not

[52:26] know how what caused our groaning
[52:28] particularly joosep ezekiel kuzey the
[52:31] jeebies - a pepper maybe there's every
[52:33] time the whip hit him in the back it
[52:35] definitely frequent if we did and they

[52:39] this slavery a bit you don't call myself
[52:42] I still say no she should prefer anybody
[52:45] even on its lavash or when they saw
[52:47] their mother or their brother being
[52:49] killed by the the slave drivers who paid
[52:52] this country's on V their family on my
[52:53] mind yes sir but you polish or fair will
[52:56] be any Mitchell fair yeah and they and
[53:01] they and they would say all or I wish
[53:03] that they would just leave us alone in
[53:04] Goshen and they cried unto the Lord a
[53:07] prophetic geogebra coalescing it to
[53:11] negotiate a compared you there when God
[53:13] heard their cry a local Jonathan LEP he
[53:17] immediately went back to the promise I
[53:20] know you leave me gets married to nella
[53:22] promise the same thing will happen today
[53:25] God has a promise for this day
[53:30] just like back then God has a plan for
[53:33] his people I know Jay I am Poussin
[53:35] pepper and if you ever once start crying
[53:38] unto the Lord your God sees a vehicle
[53:40] misaki of what a Jew then he and his
[53:44] mind will begin to go back to look and
[53:46] see what the promise is it's over your
[53:48] life upon sickish a vocal myself it do
[53:51] we have
[53:51] Masek you when he brings the deliverance
[53:55] that even the deliverance will be to
[53:58] deliver you according to the promise

[54:07] shows many who don't think it's strange
[54:10] when it when strange things come across
[54:12] your life Nippon super geek on this

[54:24] always has a deliver the heels send out
[54:28] to shul and in advance Melissa that
[54:30] deliver will have the power of God in

[55:10] you afflict the widow or the fatherless
[55:14] and they come and cry to me I will
[55:17] listen to their cry she was at least it
[55:21] is often a never ever I don't see the
[55:23] end even one now this law was if tt-take
[55:28] those that have no power since ye did
[55:30] the defective seeking on panel was
[55:33] awesome as a widow would be in poverty
[55:37] generally calculated on a lady or a
[55:40] fatherless son could possibly in poverty
[55:43] or or not have the family around him oh
[55:45] and a fella in a bar delicious in
[55:48] emotional infamy totally if you torment
[55:51] such a person

[1:00:11] beat you don't let it feel on us but
[1:00:13] here guys showing the difference between

[1:00:22] a mission let me tell you living

[1:00:29] pays back these was just a muscle of
[1:00:33] babes in love who talking issues amen
[1:00:36] man so when God begins to listen to the
[1:00:41] cry of the people he says I will I will
[1:00:44] I know verse 7 he says I was drawn not
[1:00:48] my eyes from the righteous well they
[1:00:50] said the beacon if somebody doing this
[1:00:51] oh my god
[1:00:54] and then verse 8 he says and if they
[1:00:57] talk about the righteous if they be
[1:01:00] bound in fetters and holding in cords of
[1:01:03] affliction he shows them their work and
[1:01:06] their transgressions that they have
[1:01:07] exceeded then he opened it also their
[1:01:10] ear to discipline and commanded that
[1:01:12] they return from their iniquity Street
[1:01:16] the seaweed V&T lotta middle is a
[1:01:20] deletion so until appeared on Libya the
[1:01:23] day like I said he left the no

[1:01:37] doctor I said they'd donate the lividity
[1:01:40] now if the righteous get he says the
[1:01:43] righteous will get into this condition
[1:01:44] sometimes ridiculous is the person that
[1:01:47] witness its condition and I think all of
[1:01:49] us can say it's easy for us to stumble
[1:01:51] into something say save our facility is
[1:01:55] such a big issues whether it be just a
[1:01:57] sin it's a painful machine or a sickness
[1:02:00] with malady or just a thought in your
[1:02:03] mind that you can't get rid of who you
[1:02:05] see in the past it I would
[1:02:07] but if the righteous everyone stumbled
[1:02:10] that God first brings you back to
[1:02:12] repentance Allah says you stinky fellow
[1:02:16] let me shake it jalaja me Allah I am
[1:02:20] glad that he does that Jessica thank

[1:02:24] repent
[1:02:26] everybody where would I be if he didn't
[1:02:28] do that
[1:02:29] I always give us a lesson but you think
[1:02:32] it is as once he gives you space to
[1:02:34] repent merciful don't look on shoe
[1:02:36] development then you have a
[1:02:37] responsibility to her pain quickly I
[1:02:40] love God so that God can begin the
[1:02:44] process of deliverance people because
[1:02:49] God is interested in you coming back to
[1:02:52] deliverance ask yourself what anyway so
[1:02:56] that all the people in the world may
[1:02:58] know that God will deliver his people
[1:03:00] who don't want a limb won't be some what
[1:03:02] did you believe in a man but it as it
[1:03:06] goes on down here further in the chapter
[1:03:10] in verse 12 it says that if they obey
[1:03:13] not they shall perish by the sword you
[1:03:15] can see the way he spoke as it loses
[1:03:17] even believe on me they shall die
[1:03:20] without knowledge he won't move heal
[1:03:22] some innocence he says but the
[1:03:24] hypocrites and heart heap up wrath and
[1:03:27] they cry not when he binded them many
[1:03:30] policemen a verse 13 verse verse it is

[1:03:58] begin to bind them amen amen

[1:05:28] Scriptures you have a duty to cry out

[1:05:36] chosen because it says right here that
[1:05:38] the hypocrites will not cry I mean they
[1:05:43] have no interest in going back to the
[1:05:45] world a man but those that know their
[1:05:49] God they begin to search their lives and
[1:05:54] they say oh my this is contrary to the
[1:05:56] scripture before this is set up a whole
[1:05:59] new you where there be sickness is one
[1:06:02] more sin is a sort of issue or

[1:06:18] cry out to God for that
[1:06:21] before PMF Jew rest assured that God's
[1:06:24] response to your cry unless you join one
[1:06:28] will be to look at the promise for your
[1:06:30] age he said by His Prophet
[1:06:35] don't worry about it and to bring you
[1:06:38] right back into compliance to that
[1:06:40] promise

[1:11:49] someplace you don't see me being God
[1:11:51] this morning as already when you came to
[1:11:53] that door do so my thought you see the
[1:11:55] shock on who's on the Holy Spirit began
[1:11:57] to search your heart let's set this me
[1:11:59] up on myself so you know he does that
[1:12:02] every time you come to church you can
[1:12:03] fish it let's check forgive analogies
[1:12:05] when you came into that door no Holy
[1:12:09] Spirit began brooding over this people
[1:12:11] who said
[1:12:12] he began to brood over your heart to
[1:12:15] look at a man as he began to examine the
[1:12:21] condition of your heart it begins to
[1:12:25] look to see if you're crying out to God
[1:12:27] or not for massage it wasyouwho created
[1:12:30] a man and how God responds to you equal
[1:12:34] my opponent will be according to the cry
[1:12:37] of your heart suppose you see how I'm
[1:12:40] functioning what Nicky now many people
[1:12:42] when they come to church communities
[1:12:45] they'll walk into that door with a
[1:12:47] hardened heart you see and they become
[1:12:52] bound to their hardness and you saw me
[1:12:55] not you I said and so when they come in
[1:12:58] they cannot cry out to God and I choose
[1:13:02] not to see their pavement but he will
[1:13:04] say because their heart has become
[1:13:05] hardened plus a little girl sits it and
[1:13:07] you see so as they walk in that door the
[1:13:11] Holy Spirit is brooding over the
[1:13:13] audience me he's a hardened heart that
[1:13:17] will not cry out to him and you know
[1:13:19] what a good under seeking a poopa day he
[1:13:22] just passes that person live in the
[1:13:24] process at their son they missed their
[1:13:27] chance their day of visitation but then
[1:13:32] there will be someone sitting right next
[1:13:34] to them who has a burden upon their
[1:13:38] heart he yeah yeah those shoes yeah they
[1:13:46] have something something that's just
[1:13:48] bothering them and they're crying out to
[1:13:52] God in and I say Oh Lord he's also yeah
[1:13:57] your word says this this is he Lord
[1:14:00] you're calling upon my life said this
[1:14:05] your word said to go this way your body

[1:14:12] so the whole Deaconess in a gimme your
[1:14:15] word said I should be delivered

[1:14:19] I'm back in church again maybe what's
[1:14:21] younger than he where's my deliverance
[1:14:24] my feeling was that you and that pin
[1:14:27] that heart begins to cry out to the Lord
[1:14:29] I don't go sickle my psyche of the Holy
[1:14:32] Spirit of God will pass over the person
[1:14:34] with a hardened heart and let's set this

[1:14:38] and go and begin to listen to the cry of
[1:14:40] the honest heart appear that I pass on
[1:14:43] the key on a key key key anything yeah
[1:14:45] but his response to that cry missing a
[1:14:49] bull's eye think we will be to go back
