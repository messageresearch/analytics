[20:10] songs may God bless you for
[20:17] singing I know that a lot of people were
[20:19] not expecting the
[20:23] snow and because it's Iowa we already
[20:26] know that it's the it's the snow
[20:31] season we can't dry out the church
[20:34] because of the
[20:37] snow now we're all used to this
[20:44] place and you always have to take
[20:46] precaution so you can be in
[20:52] church I'll ask you to sit for a
[20:57] moment
[21:03] and we also thank the Lord that brother
[21:05] John is also with us

[21:37] Mo yeah Pastor Gideon who's going to
[21:40] preach next Sunday in De
[21:51] Mo and there will also be a prayer for
[21:54] me so I can start um being the associate
[21:57] pastor here
[22:03] it's not an ordination because I've been
[22:04] ordained before so it's just the
[22:10] prayer brother says you don't ordain a a
[22:14] pastor you ordained a
[22:17] minister so they're going to offer to
[22:19] make a prayer for

[22:37] Ministry and for the rest we can all we
[22:39] can discuss this with the
[22:46] deacons and we can see how things can

[23:33] that and I also thank the
[23:38] church for the trust that you put in

[24:35] chapter 6 verse
[24:37] one all the way to verse
[24:54] 8 and the year the
[24:56] king died I saw also the Lord sitting
[25:00] upon a throne high and lifted up and his
[25:03] train filled the temple the
[25:16] SF above it stood the sarapin each one
[25:20] had six wings with TW he covered his
[25:22] face and with twin he covered his feet
[25:25] and with Twain he did
[25:26] fly
[25:36] and one Cried unto another and said holy
[25:38] holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole
[25:41] earth is full of his
[25:50] glory and the post of the door moved at
[25:52] the voice of him that cried and the
[25:54] house was filled with
[25:56] smoke
[26:10] then said I who is me for I am undone
[26:13] because I am a man of unclean lips and I
[26:15] dwell in the midst of people of unclean
[26:17] lips for mine eyes have seen the king
[26:20] the Lord of
[26:26] hosts
[26:39] then flew one of the serpant unto me
[26:42] having a live ho in his hands which he
[26:44] had taken from the tongues from off the
[26:46] Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[26:48] said Lo this has touched thy lips and
[26:51] thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[26:56] purged
[27:04] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[27:05] saying whom shall I send and who will go

[28:37] Christ amen
[28:40] amen you may regain your
[28:46] seat this
[28:49] morning we're going to talk about
[28:56] influences
[28:58] preached a lot in the message
[29:04] influenceu in some other place he titled
[29:07] it
[29:10] influences in some other place he titled
[29:12] it influence in
[29:16] singular in other places he titled it
[29:19] the influence of
[29:23] another it's a message he's been
[29:25] preaching since the
[29:26] 50s
[29:31] and he even preached the same message in
[29:32] the 54 in
[29:37] 1954 and that's what we we're going to
[29:39] talk about
[29:41] today because we're not going to be here
[29:43] next
[29:45] Sunday so when we come back for the
[29:47] following
[29:50] Sunday we're going to talk about the
[29:52] influence of the parents to their toward
[29:54] their
[29:55] children so according to how that the
[29:58] Lord is going to help
[30:01] us and we just commit oursel to the Holy
[30:04] Ghost for
[30:06] this so the word
[30:09] influence the dictionary
[30:11] [Music]
[30:13] says that the word influence
[30:17] means it's an General action that
[30:24] continues that acts upon somebody or
[30:27] some
[30:30] something so for example you have the
[30:33] the influence of the of the the weather
[30:35] on on the
[30:39] vegetation you also the you have the
[30:41] influence of television on on on the
[30:43] youth that's the dictionary
[30:46] is and in English it
[30:49] said that the word
[30:55] influence the capacity to have an effect
[30:57] on a
[30:58] character or a
[31:02] [Music]
[31:05] development or the behavior of someone
[31:07] or
[31:12] something or sometimes the effect of
[31:15] itself is the
[31:24] influence now we're going to talk about
[31:26] how we influence other
[31:28] [Music]
[31:33] people the following Sunday we're going
[31:35] to talk about the influence that the
[31:36] parents have toward their children but
[31:39] for this
[31:46] morning we're going to talk about the
[31:48] influence that as that that an
[31:50] individual has toward another
[31:55] individual now the prophet in the
[31:59] anywhere
[32:01] [Music]
[32:03] else he mentioned a lot Isaiah chapter 6
[32:07] where he
[32:10] read and he finishes with 2 Chronicle
[32:16] chapter where they was talking about
[32:18] King
[32:21] oah whenas was
[32:26] living
[32:28] the Bible says King goah had the
[32:31] privilege to have pure
[32:34] [Music]
[32:35] parents because he had Pious
[32:39] parents it gave him an
[32:43] advantage to the point that he was
[32:45] raised after the law of the
[32:52] Lord now the Bible tells us that in his
[32:55] life oah
[32:59] he did what was right in the in the eyes
[33:01] of the
[33:02] [Music]
[33:04] Lord and the Bible says he did just like
[33:07] his
[33:09] father and what
[33:16] didah the Bible says that he tried to
[33:19] find God throughout the life of
[33:25] Zak and he sought God in the days of
[33:28] Zakaria who had understanding in the
[33:32] vision and as long as he sought the
[33:36] Lord God made him to
[33:39] prosper so the prophet is showing to
[33:43] us he says that the advantage that
[33:49] hoseah because he was born from the
[33:51] parents who fear the
[33:54] lord so he was raised after the the word
[34:00] and so it made
[34:03] that lived for his
[34:07] child to the point that the child acted
[34:10] just like his
[34:12] father the best thing he
[34:16] [Music]
[34:17] did was that he started looking for the
[34:20] face of
[34:21] God during the days of Zaria
[34:25] prophet
[34:27] and God made him to
[34:30] prosper and if I don't see
[34:33] anything I don't see this
[34:37] Prosperity that comes outside of
[34:40] God oiah was
[34:44] prosperous because he applied his heart
[34:47] to seek after
[34:48] God search after God like his father
[34:52] did but that's not what we're going to
[34:54] talk about
[34:55] today
[34:58] I just wanted to show you what we're
[34:59] going to talk about the following
[35:00] Sunday now
[35:03] look because we're going to talk about
[35:06] something now let's go little by
[35:08] little the prophet
[35:12] says the young prophet
[35:18] Isaiah saw the influence
[35:23] that if you read second 26
[35:30] you're going to see that he became a
[35:31] King when he was
[35:33] 16 and when he was
[35:36] 16 or in that age
[35:38] 16 the child became
[35:41] king and he will sat upon the
[35:45] throne and the prophet
[35:48] says listen to what he says in the
[35:50] serman
[35:52] influences he says now
[35:55] listen
[35:58] we saw that it was the same with this
[35:59] child this
[36:01] boy as he had his P
[36:06] parents I'm in the sermon uh the
[36:08] influence preaching
[36:11] 1964 paragraph 22 he says
[36:15] this because he had those Pious
[36:19] Spirit he did what was
[36:23] right once he became King when he was 16
[36:26] years old
[36:31] he ignored all the politics and the
[36:32] popular opinions of his
[36:35] day and served god with
[36:40] reverence that made him a real
[36:45] king to IGN the politics and the modern
[36:50] opinion and serve god with
[36:53] reverence that was very
[36:55] good his kingdom God
[36:59] blessed it was so
[37:01] [Music]
[37:03] great it was next to
[37:06] Solomon so his kingdom came right after
[37:11] Solomon Solomon had the greatest that
[37:13] ever
[37:14] was but this
[37:16] boy was next to
[37:19] Solomon and the prophet
[37:23] says was a great help to the young
[37:26] prophet Isaiah
[37:28] and being a young child at that time and
[37:31] just coming
[37:33] on Isaiah was born a
[37:38] prophet he was observing the influence
[37:41] that this man had on
[37:43] people and he saw where this influence
[37:46] came
[37:47] from he saw where the influence of came
[37:53] from the prophet says that it was that
[37:56] he he had a full trust in
[37:59] God and he noticed
[38:02] [Music]
[38:06] Isaiah God will bless those who will
[38:08] stay who will trust the
[38:11] Lord what does the prophet want to say
[38:15] here he says that Isaiah noed that the
[38:21] king had a great influence on
[38:25] people
[38:27] and he noticed that his great influence
[38:28] on
[38:32] people came from the fact that he put
[38:34] his full trust in
[38:36] God he noticed
[38:40] that and what did he notice the
[38:43] prophet he noticed
[38:46] [Music]
[38:49] again God blesses those that remain
[38:52] faithful to his
[38:53] word because that's what happened to O
[38:58] remain faithful to the word and that's
[39:00] why God
[39:01] [Music]
[39:02] blessed God made his kingdom
[39:06] [Music]
[39:07] prosperous and he built so much of a
[39:09] great
[39:11] Kingdom tell to the point that there was
[39:14] peace everywhere the Bible
[39:16] says he had in his
[39:21] kingdom he was the first king to bring
[39:23] an
[39:25] engineer
[39:30] the first engineer that created
[39:34] Canon powdered
[39:36] weapon he made big
[39:40] things to the point that his people
[39:42] loved him so
[39:45] much and his influence on people were
[39:48] great was
[39:49] great now brother bream says
[39:53] this exactly what Isaiah saw
[39:59] isah had a great influence in the life
[40:01] of
[40:02] Isaiah notice that Isaiah was a
[40:05] [Music]
[40:07] prophet but someone else had an
[40:09] influence on his life him who was
[40:14] a he influenced the life of a prophet
[40:17] amen
[40:18] amen let's be
[40:20] together let's not be in the
[40:23] cold leave the cold do it job we do
[40:30] ours now listen this the prophet
[40:36] [Music]
[40:38] says we realize that this young fellow
[40:41] wanted to stay with the principles of of
[40:43] what God
[40:44] Said So that was his biggest
[40:48] worry he wanted that every
[40:52] time he wanted to steal with the
[40:55] principles of God
[40:56] [Music]
[40:58] and he kept his the laws of God the
[41:01] Bible says what the prophet
[41:07] says wouldn't turn right or
[41:12] left he stayed right with what the word
[41:16] said and God honored
[41:19] him blessed him in everything he
[41:22] done
[41:24] prospered he went right
[41:30] on what an example that is for for any
[41:33] young
[41:35] person so if we want to be prosperous
[41:37] today if we want to be
[41:40] great if we want to have
[41:43] blessing the only thing that we got
[41:46] to is to act
[41:49] like desire remained faithful to the
[41:52] word of
[41:53] God he remained faithful to that word
[41:58] he did not turn right or
[42:01] left exactly like like God told J he
[42:05] said joshu my servant rise
[42:10] up cross this Jordan with your
[42:14] people observe the law of my servant
[42:17] [Music]
[42:20] Moses the law that I give to Israel in
[42:24] or he said that let the
[42:28] never leaves your
[42:30] mouth meditate it every day
[42:33] night because it's in that time that you
[42:35] will
[42:36] succeed in everything you will
[42:40] do God was exhorting
[42:44] Joshua to meditate upon the law of
[42:48] Moses he said that it's the book of the
[42:50] law let this book of the law never turn
[42:54] away from your mouth
[42:58] so what has to come out of our mouth is
[43:00] the word of
[43:02] God and what we have
[43:04] to is to meditate on this word every day
[43:08] and
[43:11] night he said that it's in that time at
[43:14] that moment that you so our
[43:17] success is not produced from whatever
[43:21] our
[43:23] success depends on the way
[43:27] on the way we meditate on the word of
[43:32] God that's where our success
[43:35] remains we meditate it every day and
[43:37] night because it's in that time that you
[43:40] will succeed and everything you will
[43:44] do did I not tell
[43:47] you that have
[43:49] courage do not
[43:52] fear strengthen
[43:55] yourself and have
[43:57] courage because I will be with
[44:00] you as I was with
[44:03] Moses God was speaking to
[44:06] joshu he was
[44:09] fortifying he was telling
[44:11] him that the same God who was with Moses
[44:15] will be with
[44:17] him as long as he meditates on that word
[44:21] every day and night it's at that moment
[44:24] that he will succeed now us as well
[44:28] Brothers God has lived so much with the
[44:31] prophet he done great things with the
[44:35] prophets and the world is aware
[44:38] of it's It's aware that God worked with
[44:40] brother BR now the problem is
[44:43] us we that come
[44:46] after as the people
[44:48] of what Have We
[44:51] Become we need
[44:54] Victory we need success
[44:57] where will the success come
[45:00] from it will only come if we
[45:03] meditate the law of Moses today is the
[45:06] message of the
[45:08] hour meditate on the
[45:10] word meditate on the message every day
[45:15] night it's in that moment that you will
[45:18] succeed brother brother
[45:20] says he says I
[45:24] think if we had people
[45:27] today our churches who claim to be
[45:31] Christians if they would abrain from the
[45:34] things of the
[45:35] world and live that kind of a
[45:41] life it would influence the younger
[45:43] Christians to do
[45:46] so if our
[45:49] churches claim to be Christian
[45:52] churches if they would abrain from the
[45:54] things of the world
[45:58] and live that kind of a
[46:02] life it would influence the younger
[46:05] Christians to do
[46:07] so but
[46:09] today when they let
[46:11] down drink and smoke and Carry
[46:20] On and still try to hold their
[46:22] confession as Christian as
[46:24] Christianity that
[46:26] puts it puts a bad stumbling block in
[46:30] other people's
[46:32] way big issue that we have
[46:35] today we fail in our
[46:38] lives we fail in what we
[46:41] do and when we do
[46:43] it not with notwithstanding we keep
[46:46] saying that we're Christians you are
[46:50] Christian I'm baptized with the spirit
[46:52] of
[46:53] God not knowing that what we were doing
[46:57] the young
[46:59] Christians children among in in your
[47:03] midst we're placing a stumbling block in
[47:06] their Christian
[47:09] Life and we're going to block them from
[47:12] living a Christian
[47:14] Life That's why in the days that are
[47:16] coming or in the Sunday the following
[47:19] Sunday we're going to talk
[47:21] about the influence of the parents
[47:24] towards the children
[47:26] so the parents
[47:28] know they have a heavy
[47:32] duty to live the word of
[47:35] God not just for
[47:38] God not just for
[47:41] themselves but because of their children
[47:43] as
[47:45] well so because of my children I will
[47:48] live the word of
[47:49] God because you know my
[47:51] brothers at a certain
[47:54] age you have to become
[47:56] responsible and we tell ourselves that
[47:59] this thing I can't do that thing because
[48:03] of my
[48:08] children what you
[48:12] know Pastor was given an example and
[48:15] saying he was
[48:17] saying the the age that I'm
[48:22] at you guys are believers of my truth as
[48:25] he was
[48:28] saying now one day I was I was
[48:34] jogging I'm Excuse me that I give this
[48:39] example and as I was jogging I wanted to
[48:43] yeah I I wanted to use the restroom
[48:45] somewhere in the in the in the the
[48:48] woods and at a certain time something
[48:51] came in in
[48:53] myself I told myself it's a natur
[48:55] natural
[49:00] desire now what would happen if I would
[49:02] just on the road and I would see someone
[49:06] that says good morning
[49:09] Pastor what kind of an image would I
[49:11] give to that person he
[49:17] said even if that need was so pressing
[49:21] I because I have to live to a
[49:24] Time sense of
[49:27] responsibility
[49:29] KN I have people to whom
[49:33] I'm so I can't just do
[49:36] whatever because there are people who
[49:38] are
[49:41] looking and they need an influence from
[49:45] me and that's why as
[49:49] parents you have a heavy
[49:53] responsibility to not live the word just
[49:55] for
[49:56] God not just for
[49:59] yourself also for your
[50:02] children you said for this
[50:04] thing that thing right there I can't do
[50:08] this because of my young boy because of
[50:11] my
[50:13] daughter I can't fall in this
[50:16] thing what will my
[50:19] children when they will hear that I
[50:22] did what would my children become
[50:30] so we have to live to in a
[50:32] way knowing that there are people that
[50:36] need people that need an influence from
[50:43] us and when we can't give them that good
[50:49] influence placing a big stumbling block
[50:52] in their Christian Life and the prophet
[50:55] said
[50:56] that we will respond answer for
[50:59] this because you blocked
[51:01] someone from living a
[51:04] Christi because of your
[51:08] life that's
[51:13] why I I was with a couple young ones
[51:17] with whom I was living
[51:20] with excuse me I'm going to give this
[51:23] this other
[51:24] example
[51:27] every time I would go to a restroom you
[51:28] know how kids would
[51:31] de you you see that the
[51:34] rest he didn't clean up he just left
[51:36] everything like
[51:38] that and every time you go there you
[51:40] have to flush you have to crush
[51:45] at but you know in the toilets over
[51:47] there you got to get water from
[51:49] somewhere and every time I was telling
[51:52] so how do you live like that why do you
[51:54] do that
[51:57] I was telling oh you're you're 16 or 18
[51:59] years
[52:00] old the other one is probably
[52:03] 23 how can you live like
[52:06] that I was telling
[52:10] them I they they asked them one day if
[52:13] you see me go to a
[52:16] restaurant and that you saw me do
[52:18] exactly what you what kind of an image
[52:21] would you have of
[52:23] me you won't respect
[52:28] me but why can you do
[52:31] this you're aware that it's not a good
[52:33] thing to
[52:36] do so there are some things that at
[52:39] certain
[52:40] age you can't do this
[52:44] anymore kids it won't be a
[52:48] problem you can't do
[52:54] this
[52:56] that's why we always have to live
[52:59] accordingly to say that Lord what I'm
[53:02] about to
[53:04] do what kind of an influence would that
[53:08] give if people see me do
[53:10] this what would they say about what
[53:13] would they say of me what I'm
[53:19] doing closer to you or push him away
[53:22] from
[53:23] you those are the questions we need to
[53:25] ask ourselves and the prophet
[53:28] says that when you have something that
[53:30] you're about to
[53:32] do and that you have a lot of doubts in
[53:35] your heart so don't do
[53:40] it but do we have Christians who that
[53:42] still ask themselves questions like that
[53:45] what I'm about to
[53:46] do can that bring someone closer
[53:49] to my
[53:51] way my way
[53:54] of neighbors with my sisters and my
[53:58] brothers can that bring someone closer
[54:02] to what kind of an influence would I
[54:04] have in someone else's
[54:07] life if you could ask yourself those
[54:11] questions this church will be a church
[54:13] on fire it will be a different
[54:17] Church the prophet
[54:21] says we have
[54:23] people our churches that claim to be
[54:26] Christian if they would upam from the
[54:28] things of the
[54:29] world and live that kind of a
[54:34] life it will influence the younger
[54:36] Christians to do so but
[54:39] today when they lay down and drink and
[54:43] smoke and carry
[54:47] on still try to hold their confession as
[54:51] Christianity brother
[54:54] says
[54:56] it puts a bad stumbling block in other
[54:58] people's
[55:01] life and it makes it even very
[55:04] hard because you forget
[55:07] brothers that we are living
[55:12] beings we're living
[55:15] script we're living
[55:17] Epistles of all
[55:19] men the prophet says in this
[55:23] sermon the world tired to read the
[55:28] Bible if I asked anybody who read his
[55:31] Bible I don't I'll have five five
[55:36] hands the world is tired of reading the
[55:40] Bible why are they
[55:43] tired because the life that the Bible is
[55:45] talking about they're no longer seeing
[55:48] it in
[55:49] people that's why they're
[55:51] tired and the prophet
[55:54] says
[55:55] it says they're tired of reading the
[56:00] Bible but they because they're expecting
[56:02] to read living BBL that are
[56:06] men living the
[56:08] word instead of reading the
[56:12] Bible That's why brother bream
[56:15] says live me a
[56:17] sermon instead of preaching a
[56:21] seron because we have to reflect of what
[56:24] we say
[56:27] we have to be living
[56:29] beings Epistles read can read because
[56:33] the
[56:33] Bible the Bible itself are Pap it
[56:37] doesn't
[56:39] run but we don't need dead
[56:43] letters we need a a living
[56:45] B and how can the Bible live it's going
[56:49] to live in our hearts in our
[56:52] lives when the people of the world will
[56:54] see
[56:55] us they can know
[56:58] that God does not accept
[57:01] sin God does not love
[57:03] adultery they'll see that God doesn't
[57:05] like smoking they'll see that God
[57:07] doesn't like drinking
[57:10] why because they did not read it in the
[57:13] Bible because they faced
[57:17] someone to all the Temptations went
[57:20] through but they could not take him The
[57:23] Temptations could not take he did not
[57:28] smoke you
[57:31] know the environment influences people
[57:35] that's what they
[57:36] saying just notice in our
[57:40] life how we were living when we were in
[57:45] Africa a lot of parents know what we
[57:48] talk what I'm talking
[57:50] about now look how we have become here
[57:54] in this country country of
[57:55] pharaoh where we work as
[57:59] slaves the devil gives us so much time
[58:02] to to be at
[58:03] work you want to have a beautiful car
[58:06] you got to go
[58:09] work so because you want to have a a c
[58:11] to impress somebody else you got to work
[58:13] harder you want to have a beautiful home
[58:16] to impress somebody else go work
[58:20] harder and you're going to work like
[58:23] that without resting you're you're gonna
[58:25] get tired when you get home you don't
[58:28] even
[58:29] pray you eat you
[58:31] sleep the next day you wake up again
[58:34] same
[58:37] cycle and it's going to keep on going
[58:39] like
[58:43] this we're a church that's expecting the
[58:48] rapt the Rapture will occur in those
[58:51] conditions and you're going to go in
[58:53] there
[58:56] it's a demonic
[58:58] system the devil knew what he was
[59:01] doing and you need need to be spiritual
[59:05] people to understand that this is
[59:08] unacceptable you have to free
[59:12] yourself now you see people
[59:15] today they have big
[59:18] cars they have big
[59:22] homes but they don't have time to sleep
[59:24] at
[59:28] home what would that home do to
[59:31] you what what does
[59:34] it what good is it if it if you don't
[59:37] have time with
[59:38] children the father is always always
[59:42] gone what would it do to
[59:47] you I I'm about to buy a home
[59:51] too but I told you last
[59:53] time
[59:55] that I'm not going to buy a home to
[59:56] impress somebody
[59:58] else I'm going to buy a home according
[1:00:01] to what God gives me so I can live in
[1:00:04] that house and enjoy that
[1:00:07] home with my little
[1:00:11] family sometimes we do things and we
[1:00:13] don't
[1:00:15] understand did God tell you to buy that
[1:00:18] house at that
[1:00:20] price is that
[1:00:23] God tell you to buy that house at that
[1:00:27] price
[1:00:29] nope we do things from
[1:00:33] ourselves and it's those things that are
[1:00:35] putting us in
[1:00:36] prison you don't know how to set
[1:00:38] yourself
[1:00:40] free you don't know how to travel
[1:00:44] anymore because the time to travel oh no
[1:00:47] no no I can't I can't
[1:00:51] travel I I won't I will miss all the
[1:00:53] money
[1:00:58] set yourself
[1:01:03] free let's live our life in the way that
[1:01:05] God wants us to don't impress
[1:01:08] anybody and this church will go
[1:01:13] forward so I will try to finish too
[1:01:15] quick this just like an introduction for
[1:01:19] today and we're going to develop on this
[1:01:21] another
[1:01:22] day the following
[1:01:28] we we are living Epistles read of all
[1:01:33] men and a lot of people don't want to
[1:01:35] read the Bible anymore and brother bam
[1:01:40] says it says that we have to think about
[1:01:43] it
[1:01:46] tonight why the pagans don't want to
[1:01:48] read the Bible anymore he
[1:01:51] says because every man every woman
[1:01:55] every boy and every
[1:01:57] girl know that there comes a
[1:02:01] judgment you might skip this that or the
[1:02:08] other you might beat the the income tax
[1:02:11] IRS
[1:02:13] IRS brother talked about
[1:02:17] IRS can try to escape all the taxes
[1:02:23] brother you might beat the income tax so
[1:02:27] that you don't pay
[1:02:30] it you might beat the income
[1:02:34] tax and you might esip the internal
[1:02:41] revenue you might do one thing or
[1:02:43] another he
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:50] says you might have run over the speed
[1:02:52] limits and the cops never catch you
[1:02:55] but one
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:02:57] day judment is going to catch
[1:03:01] you I'm I'm guilty
[1:03:04] too because they've already pulled me
[1:03:07] over by the
[1:03:08] cops I exceeded the speed
[1:03:11] limit and I promised that I wouldn't do
[1:03:13] it
[1:03:14] again so when they preach the word we
[1:03:17] preach it to
[1:03:19] ourselves I'm also going I'm going
[1:03:22] toward perfection I also want to go to
[1:03:25] heaven and I'm trying to make efforts
[1:03:26] because I never read
[1:03:29] this so you that heard it today as a
[1:03:33] Christian when they wrote
[1:03:36] 70 they they can allow you to go to
[1:03:40] 75 don't go to
[1:03:42] 80 don't go to
[1:03:49] 100 says if the cops did not CCH you
[1:03:53] today but the Judgment of God will catch
[1:03:59] you so there is a God who's watching
[1:04:02] you there's an eye that's
[1:04:05] watching even if the eye of the world is
[1:04:08] not seeing you there's an I watching
[1:04:14] you now you did your thing you stole
[1:04:16] from IRS you didn't pay
[1:04:19] here next year you do the same
[1:04:23] thing
[1:04:25] because today Christians kill conscious
[1:04:27] conscious to be
[1:04:32] Christians so you can find yourself
[1:04:36] in but you still claim that you are a
[1:04:38] Christian so you just heard brother say
[1:04:42] if you didn't hear it before that's
[1:04:44] something else but brother said it
[1:04:49] here you try to beat the to
[1:04:53] steal you know how you do it
[1:04:56] yourself you know how you always do
[1:05:00] it but the Judgment of God will catch
[1:05:04] you you might Escape
[1:05:07] today but the Judgment of God will catch
[1:05:15] you so we have to live in a
[1:05:20] way that our life has an influence on
[1:05:22] somebody else
[1:05:24] he says you
[1:05:26] see the influence that
[1:05:31] you're will obligate you to
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:38] respond for the many Souls that you have
[1:05:40] put us turned that you turned as side
[1:05:42] away from
[1:05:44] Christ The Influence that that
[1:05:47] you will make you
[1:05:49] respond so put yourself in the balance
[1:05:53] ask
[1:05:56] what influence does your life produce in
[1:05:58] somebody else's
[1:06:01] life you keep turning people away from
[1:06:03] the Christ you keep turning away from
[1:06:06] the Life of Christ you will
[1:06:12] enter I think it behooves us tonight to
[1:06:15] think
[1:06:17] see Judgment of God will catch us it's
[1:06:20] certain brother says it's certain
[1:06:27] and we know that man must
[1:06:30] die and after that the
[1:06:34] Judgment death is not a hard
[1:06:38] thing it's the Judgment after death
[1:06:41] that's the bad part and
[1:06:44] there what you've done on
[1:06:48] life and how you've influenced
[1:06:51] others that day
[1:06:55] you'll have to answer for it in that
[1:06:58] day the prophet says it
[1:07:02] clearly I don't know if the prophet is
[1:07:04] not clear
[1:07:06] here but the prophet is very clear on
[1:07:10] this subject now let's look in our
[1:07:12] lives let's see what the things that we
[1:07:16] do that cannot bring people closer to
[1:07:19] God let's reject those
[1:07:22] things Paul says
[1:07:27] satisfy the the the the bird the burdens
[1:07:30] that beset
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:34] us let's reject set us put aside the the
[1:07:38] the burdens that
[1:07:40] set and let's have our our eyes fixed
[1:07:43] toward
[1:07:44] Christ him who is the consumer of our
[1:07:47] faith yes
[1:07:50] my so everything we
[1:07:52] do
[1:07:55] that does not bring people closer to God
[1:07:57] Christ let's let's set set them aside
[1:08:01] let's put them
[1:08:03] aside and Christ obligates us he
[1:08:07] obligates he calls for Holiness he
[1:08:09] oblig he asks us to respect his
[1:08:14] word he obligates us to live in a way
[1:08:17] that that people find him through
[1:08:20] US yes my
[1:08:22] brothers
[1:08:25] I would love to say
[1:08:29] this I'm gonna read this then maybe
[1:08:32] we'll finish from today for
[1:08:35] today and we'll come back maybe next
[1:08:47] Sunday how we should think on them
[1:08:51] things friends sternly and
[1:08:55] reverently as we see this day
[1:09:03] approaching and knowing that anytime
