[42:39] Premier versus
[42:41] we have been ministering uh
[42:44] in Des Moines
[42:46] by way of a series
[42:50] of
[42:54] the city
[42:58] let me uh
[43:08] because I believe that is the greatest
[43:09] revelation of all time that's because
[43:18] Calver
[43:19] tisement
[43:27] is
[43:41] began
[43:42] read the first verse verse
[43:56] and indeed bear with me
[44:19] dinner
[44:29] without
[44:34] in your mind should be corrupted from
[44:36] the
[44:39] from this is
[44:53] if he that cometh preaches another Jesus
[44:56] whom you have not preached or if ye
[44:59] receive another Spirit which you have
[45:02] not received or another gospel which you
[45:06] have not accepted you might well bear
[45:09] with him
[45:10] yes
[45:29] phobia
[45:34] you know thank you to the please
[45:57] for he have made him to be seen for us
[46:03] who knew no sin
[46:06] that we might be made
[46:10] the righteousness of God
[46:19] of God second Corinthians
[46:24] it seems like it's not the same
[46:26] the difference yeah
[46:30] in English and French song a little bit
[46:33] different
[46:35] is
[46:41] huh
[46:44] okay okay
[46:48] statue
[47:02] is
[47:17] being with us
[47:23] secretary
[47:28] [Music]
[47:35] [Music]
[47:46] amen
[47:46] [Music]
[47:56] we thank God
[47:59] we like to entire the message
[48:04] The Church Without spot wrinkle or
[48:07] blemish
[48:11] when we think about it calvary
[48:26] but Jesus defeated
[48:30] Satan thank you he defeated death hell
[48:33] and the grace
[48:36] and there's a reason why
[48:47] but when Adam and Eve failed God
[48:53] needed a man to complete the mission
[48:59] we find out by God's grace
[49:02] that Adam after
[49:17] he was to produce sons and daughters
[49:21] in the image and likeness of God
[49:25] but when Adam and Eve
[49:35] [Music]
[49:53] in other words
[50:05] Adam was the god God the Earth
[50:09] he was able to command the animals he
[50:14] was able to command the wind
[50:19] top of it had to be obeyed
[50:22] hallelujah amen and we find out by the
[50:26] grace of God
[50:27] that afterwards
[50:29] after
[50:31] sin
[50:33] nature in itself
[50:35] went uncontrolled
[50:39] because Adam was placed on the earth
[50:43] to control nature
[50:46] hallelujah amen but after the fall
[50:49] there was no one there to control the
[50:53] nature
[50:55] the weather did what it wanted it to do
[51:00] animals did what they wanted to do
[51:05] Hallelujah it came to the point
[51:09] that man had to eat meat
[51:13] men had to eat meat a long difference in
[51:17] order to live full of evil men had to
[51:20] eat natural things
[51:24] but in the beginning
[51:27] man lived by the voice of God
[51:31] hallelujah amen we are now in a state of
[51:34] being men
[51:38] the very civilization
[51:41] that we're living in
[51:43] is totally insane if a man or or
[51:49] totally crazy
[51:51] from our in fully and we realize by
[51:55] God's grace
[51:56] if there is a people that is insane
[52:01] there must be a people that is saying
[52:04] hallelujah
[52:07] and therefore
[52:10] people in this
[52:15] in this totally contrary
[52:18] to this civilization Hallelujah
[52:23] and though we are in the way
[52:27] though we are in the way
[52:29] they call heresy
[52:32] they call crazy
[52:36] crazy ones Hallelujah
[52:41] Calvary in itself
[52:44] means a lot
[52:49] even when John
[52:51] look to see the lion
[52:57] foreign
[53:02] hallelujah amen as if it had been slain
[53:07] from the foundation of the world
[53:12] what we must realize today
[53:15] is that things must change actually
[53:19] they cannot remain the same
[53:22] and as I say and
[53:26] when we come to church
[53:28] we come to be changed
[53:31] hallelujah amen is that right that's the
[53:34] correct let's turn
[53:37] turn I'm sorry just reading from the
[53:39] message works is Faith Express

[54:37] hair like women and women

[57:04] opened
[57:05] in 1963
[57:08] the message changed the message
[57:12] he could no longer
[57:15] preach just the things that he preached
[57:21] Hallelujah he began to preach to the
[57:26] bride alone
[57:33] for this message

[1:00:07] everybody want to run
[1:00:09] right
[1:00:13] Hallelujah you have to just one big wall
[1:00:17] but we're building a building and we
[1:00:21] come to a corner
[1:00:23] and you got to change
[1:00:26] those Corners as Brother Don cries so
[1:00:30] well
[1:00:33] he says so stated in it not long ago
[1:00:37] at those changes
[1:00:40] where the Trouble Comes
[1:00:44] is that right amen see it's hard on that
[1:00:48] corner so from my channel
[1:00:50] that corner and make it just right the
[1:00:54] first sequence Hallelujah and that's
[1:00:57] where a lot of people have stopped say
[1:00:59] like your book like you heard me say
[1:01:02] I saw a little uh saying
[1:01:06] I saw a little writing
[1:01:09] and in this writing it don't say exactly
[1:01:14] there's nothing there's nothing wrong
[1:01:22] y'all understand me
[1:01:24] there's nothing wrong with a bend in the
[1:01:29] road

[1:01:39] I wanted you through
[1:01:41] hallelujah amen now let me ask you a
[1:01:43] question how many times you have

[1:01:52] and all of a sudden
[1:01:54] quickly yeah
[1:01:56] do you just continue to go straight
[1:02:30] and so you must understand
[1:02:33] we must understand
[1:02:37] and the time is focused on the pride of
[1:02:41] Jesus Christ you
[1:02:46] become

[1:03:26] there got to be changes
[1:03:31] hallelujah amen now if God can't change
[1:03:35] you see
[1:03:37] he can't save you in the people y'all
[1:03:41] hear what I'm saying it is so simple
[1:03:43] it's a simple the same blood of Jesus
[1:03:46] Christ
[1:03:49] it's the same blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:03:53] sanctifies you it's the same blood that
[1:03:59] seals there's only one blood and that's
[1:04:04] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:07] hallelujah amen you know this thing is
[1:04:10] for a long time I I struggled personally

[1:08:40] Justified I'm not talking about just
[1:08:43] being Sanctified

[1:08:49] sacrifice you can deny the word

[1:10:36] things

[1:12:45] so much so as you stand virtuously
[1:12:51] in the presence of the Lord hallelujah

[1:47:30] but I'm not going to go there but my
[1:47:33] point is
[1:47:35] you've got to know where you stand with
[1:47:37] God
[1:47:40] that old Temple you got
[1:47:43] that'll temper
[1:47:45] that you have
[1:47:49] it's got to be dealt with
[1:47:52] yeah
[1:47:53] the spirit of jealousy
[1:47:56] has to be dealt with yeah
[1:47:59] the spirit of immorality
[1:48:02] has to be dealt with
[1:48:15] you weren't saved I said you won't make
[1:48:19] a rapture
[1:48:24] so I got you quiet and now
[1:48:28] I got you thinking
[1:48:31] I really really you know I'm I that that
[1:48:34] um that quote I just read about
[1:48:37] television
[1:48:39] I'm gonna be using that a lot
[1:48:42] of people to forget
[1:48:45] that when you think God don't see you
[1:48:48] come from
[1:48:50] he sees you
[1:48:53] and you've got to be careful in this
[1:48:55] message
[1:48:57] because people in this message asking
[1:48:59] their visions
[1:49:01] people in this message still have
[1:49:04] visions
[1:49:07] and some people have word of knowledge
[1:49:13] God will come like a natural man and
[1:49:15] talk to you
[1:49:17] say you know that sister there I mean
[1:49:20] she just committed adultery
[1:49:25] oh
[1:49:26] you don't say that yeah
[1:49:28] yeah that could be God talking to you
[1:49:30] for power see y'all getting scared now
[1:49:33] because
[1:49:35] knock knock
[1:49:38] so you you you we gotta understand
[1:49:41] God talks about it
[1:49:47] you know how people say oh I love you
[1:49:49] brother Brooks well they told Brother
[1:49:50] Branham that and brothers
[1:49:54] any holy ghost film
[1:49:57] when somebody lie to you
[1:49:59] gotta say they lying
[1:50:08] he's real cereal
[1:50:14] and I'm closing on this hey put them in
[1:50:16] there I was in a man's Church in in Ohio
[1:50:34] that was one of the missions
[1:50:41] he wants you to talk
[1:50:45] amen now
[1:50:48] now think about it
[1:50:49] it's done for us
[1:50:53] we have to always give for praise
[1:51:00] I got to put my wife in on this
[1:51:03] because you remember now uh remember
[1:51:05] from my sister she's looking at me now
[1:51:08] but the truth of the matter is the
[1:51:11] football I rarely hear praises
[1:51:15] I rarely hear testimonies
[1:51:25] where are the Praises and the
[1:51:26] testimonies
[1:51:28] you know you got them
[1:51:31] I'm sure you have Praises
[1:51:37] Are you ashamed to testify
[1:51:42] Hallelujah
[1:51:44] you know I remember I didn't even have a
[1:51:46] dime to my name
[1:51:48] and I need it I needed a dime
[1:51:53] to make a telephone call
[1:51:57] now you know that's long ago
[1:52:02] Hallelujah and I asked somebody do you
[1:52:05] have a yeah
[1:52:14] all of a sudden the light came from out
[1:52:16] of the corner
[1:52:21] young lady who stood by me Saw The Light
[1:52:26] The Light Came In Front of Me
[1:52:28] began to circle like this
[1:52:31] and when that light stopped
[1:52:34] it was more than enough but they are
[1:52:37] simple more it wasn't a dime it was a
[1:52:39] quarter it's just but it was enough to
[1:52:43] make the phone the success you don't
[1:52:46] have to believe that
[1:52:48] testimonies
[1:52:53] amen let me tell you when it comes to
[1:52:55] money you should never worry about it
[1:52:58] he's got all of that
[1:53:02] you're fairly asking for it that's why
[1:53:04] you don't get it
[1:53:06] often times
[1:53:11] cause you didn't ask foreign
[1:53:29] I didn't even ask for money
[1:53:31] I I needed it because I was still a
[1:53:34] single man
[1:53:37] and the Lord said I'm going to bless you
[1:53:39] with some money today yeah listen nobody
[1:53:41] gets ready
[1:53:45] but on my way to church
[1:53:47] I had to stop
[1:53:50] because it started raining
[1:53:53] on my way up to the church because it
[1:53:56] was on top of a hill
[1:54:10] and and yes
[1:54:13] I don't know who dropped it
[1:54:16] if someone did drop it
[1:54:20] all I know it was mine two seconds
[1:54:27] you see
[1:54:29] you see but the power
[1:54:31] power the supplement
[1:54:35] hallelujah amen it's real people God is
[1:54:40] real and and you have said you have to
[1:54:43] y'all need to testify y'all need to say
[1:54:48] I heard somebody say
[1:54:50] we don't do it because we don't want
[1:54:53] people to think we're trying to draw
[1:54:55] attention to ourselves
[1:55:02] don't do it
[1:55:04] but if you want to give God the glory
[1:55:15] you need to give God the glory
[1:55:18] they overcame
[1:55:21] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:55:24] their testimony
[1:55:30] you love the Lord I'm quitting there's
[1:55:34] something else I wanted to say but it
[1:55:35] slipped my mind
[1:55:37] but people of God we are such a blessed
[1:55:39] people
[1:55:45] a blessed people
[1:55:49] and don't ever don't ever let the devil
[1:55:53] think you're not blessed
[1:55:55] let us ever make you think
[1:56:02] walk like royalty by shares
[1:56:09] glory to God and when you're in need
[1:56:13] don't give the devil the praise
[1:56:23] ah I feel like dancing in the spirit
[1:56:25] soccer is freeze
[1:56:30] I didn't even hear that one amen amen
[1:56:36] God is good to us
[1:56:41] [Applause]
[1:56:47] amen we we uh we have a uh baptisms and
[1:56:52] I was so happy when I heard uh
[1:56:58] who
[1:57:14] uh want to be baptized is
[1:57:21] he and I are going to work together to
[1:57:24] baptize you hello in the name oh Lord
[1:57:27] Jesus Christ
[1:57:30] for y'all if you don't understand even
[1:57:33] when brother Merle was here
[1:57:36] it was he and I who helped baptize
[1:57:39] so both of us are going to get in there
[1:57:41] and
[1:57:41] baptize you
[1:57:48] yeah Hallelujah
[1:58:04] is that all right
[1:58:06] I shouldn't say that but
[1:58:10] it is what we're going to do by the
[1:58:12] grace of God
[1:58:16] because of the time
[1:58:18] I didn't know whether brother uh want to
[1:58:21] go over some scripture but for those who
[1:58:22] are going to be baptized we want to go
[1:58:24] over the scriptures with you
[1:58:26] uh after the service
[1:58:31] so when we get to the place of baptism
[1:58:34] we won't have to go through the
[1:58:36] ceremonial part of it the word part but
[1:58:39] we'll we'll baptize you in the name of
[1:58:40] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:48] because time is an essence
[1:58:57] you love the Lord amen
[1:59:01] you know you you finally made me feel
[1:59:03] good
