should earnestly in the state which was once delivered for there are certain men perhaps in unawares who were before of old ordained to the this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ one more scripture will be coming from Isaiah 55 and 10. when I was worshiping the Lord I apologize I heard a thought that that what I was doing it was embarrassing his exclusive facility if my worship is embarrassing to you I'll see my the ones with it um it proves you don't have the Holy ghosts and discipline you need God Isaiah 55 10-11 is for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the Earth and make it it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater foreign out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish excuse me but it shall accomplish that we're pleased and it shall prosper in the things whether to I sent it uh let us pray dear heavenly father words cannot express my gratitude by holding the perfect by experience my God to truth you're so good to me Lord and your mercy and your grace endures we pray for the service this morning this same anointing that you are anointing with me I trust that you will anoint Every Soul tonight father break and destroy the Yokes of the Enemies free Hallelujah and Lord we'll be careful to give you the praise in Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated I like to teach or preach a little message I started this message in the morning I'd like to preach it here a subject is A House Divided cannot stand up I read these two passages of scripture and one seemed like it's going uh in in a different direction than the other yeah in the book of Jude we see a Jude we see him encouraging the Saints to fight for that which they know is right and then we find Jude making the church aware please that there are men among them who is ordained for a different purpose these men according to the scripture was before old ordained it is turning the grace of God into lasciviousness sensuous acts and things of that nature come down denying the only Lord God in our Lord Jesus Christ but here in Isaiah is a Isaiah is talking about the seed of God and how that God plant the seeds God Waters the seeds God gives the increase of the seeds but this seed he's speaking of Manassas is his word how his word goes out of his mouth and will not come back void here in this scripture I find my Assurance to know that the seed s that has been planted in me that has been planted in you it's a seed that God himself planted Hallelujah with this seed yeah Alexis Ramos the word becomes the god of your soul I'm gonna say that again with this yeah the word becomes the god of your soul Hallelujah because it is the word in you and I or you and me that have been promised and we have been promised Hallelujah victory in this hour no matter what we go through no matter how it looks no matter how it feels nothing can defeat the word that has gone out of his Hallelujah [Music] [Music] now say who is he has children as well but we are the children of the light Hallelujah and you and I we know those of us who have the Holy Ghost we know that all Christians are not Christians Hallelujah we do not judge them we do not separate ourselves from them Hallelujah but we do recognize we'll bring forth we did not come on to produce Wesley we did not come to produce the Pentecostals but we came to produce the word himself Jesus Christ manifested in the flesh Jesus Christ we have the highest [Music] Hallelujah it is in this hour the world will recognize that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh yes sir in the beginning God shows Adam as his house he God came in the cool of the evening even though he walked with Adam Adam at that time was the housing of God hallelujah when you looked at Adams Hallelujah Adam was the mouthpiece of God was the visible of God hallelujah yes sir to Adam stood in a position where he could see in the natural father as well as the dimension in which God lived here hallelujah Adam was such a being I don't think that he was able to fellowship with God and God was able to fellowship with him but we know what the serpent did Hallelujah the Bible says that Satan comes to steal kill and destroy Hallelujah and how does he do it he comes to divide Hallelujah Satan comes to divide and that's what Jesus even says hallelujah [Music] when God created Adam he created him male and female if a female as long as he was in that conditions so God separated him male and female is that right Hallelujah Adam I don't Not only was uh spirit but he was Flesh and Blood Hallelujah and he gave Eve his spiritual Parts he still was called Adam that mean they had the same yeah his name was Adam her name was Adam the same nature [Music] but watch what the devil did yeah by the way of it he changed the meaning of the word and Eve was seduced and believe what the serpent said and she failed [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah and so you must understand the opening of the word the revealing of The Shield the sounding of the Thunders [Music] where we can stand within a Oneness we can stand as a Oneness [Music] until you're born again you've got to have the Holy Ghost and fires [Music] now we look at this day this day and the prophet God teaches us it could never change the relationship he was a son this is why Jesus Jesus your names were already written in the land Book of Life y'all hear what I'm saying you are already preserved but it took a sacrifice in order for God to bring Fellowship [Music] back to himself I'll remember with his creation Hallelujah I want to give you some thoughts after God had created everything to choose the Bible said on the seventh day he died in that seventh day was Jesus you understand me now think about this he was able to Fellowship with Adam you think about the community there was no Bridge there was no hindrance but when since the fall Hallelujah it brought a bridge but God was so mindfulness [Music] when you did he said if if anything defiles today do you understand me thank God for the grace of God even Israel couldn't keep that that law said law and every time I think about when Paul says he was blameless I'm still not yet Hallelujah because even though you do not believe all the words this flesh don't always obey it all somebody y'all hear what I'm saying we believe it all but this flesh is it is the only reason why I'm blameless it's because of the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] that was Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah so what did Satan love Division I don't know about anything going on here but this is what God helped me to preacher Hallelujah because Satan cannot stand to see a church on one Accord Hallelujah I'm gonna say it again if this church would move into one accordingness you see God move in a powerful way Hallelujah but he knows if he can keep you judging one another picking at one another jealous of one another if he gets some carnality to take pre-eminence in this church is invited easy and the Bible says A House Divided y'all hear what I'm saying even brother Branham says if they'll rise there's a problem in the church he said don't take sides is that right you don't take signs you seek the will of God Jesus it doesn't matter what the Deacon says no matter what the preacher says no matter what the ushers are the trusties [Music] Hallelujah if this is he knows you will be a problem in the church imma say it again if Satan gets can get families [Music] Hallelujah yes it is why he knows that he's here in order to have a unified you must first start with the family [Music] in order to happen you must first start with the family because the child charge is made up of family because let me limit families let me say it like this if you've got problems in your house and they are not resolved Satan will come in you're going to have sicknesses you're going to have all kinds of problems in your house because you're not on one Accord y'all better hear what I'm saying but when you're on watercolors you stand like the Rock of Gibraltar voice Satan cannot penetrate is that right come on somebody we don't know but Rahab family believed but she got her entire family y'all better hear what I'm saying she got her entire family an angel could not destroy her house your ideas matters not only the word of God matters Hallelujah look look what Jacob went through when he had Rachel and Leo look at all the confusion they had to go through what about Abraham and Sarah they want one Accord producer Jacob and the Esau is always fussing and fighting it too Hallelujah is that right and the Bible Bible confused is what I'm saying I'm trying to bring us to a place where we could be delivered we need Jesus zombies we need more God we I'm not talking about just you I said nothing about I need more cups Hallelujah why because I want my wife and as far as far as sometimes things get a little rocky yes everybody that's married know what I'm saying right it doesn't always go smooth just like you fight to keep your Christianity Hallelujah but when you stand for the world the Lord will stand for you Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah God does not change he cannot change and I love that about him Hallelujah everything we do is hinged upon the word of God hallelujah is that right Hallelujah Hebrews 8. for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel and I want to say this because why most of us have trouble foreign [Music] [Music] it literally takes the world from you Hallelujah Glory yes yes in the future home he don't let them off with you brother said in as the Earth must be purified by fire [Music] and he said we Holy Ghost fires all the demons away so is it with a man when God fills you your soul with the Holy Ghost in fire all the demons away it doesn't just stop in your soul of what it moves from the soul it burns Devils out of your spirit Hallelujah [Music] hallelujah amen that's why God converts the soul you can control the flesh let me move on I will put my laws into their heart and write them in their heart and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people um and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man is know the Lord for All Shall know me from the least to the greatest for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness amen and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more see people don't know Hallelujah because that's what Adam did to the serpent he placed is to whom you yield your members to obey is [Music] that right if you yield to the internet the devil y'all understand me that's to what the scriptures are saying if you yield your members to obey him you just about to Satan to do his spinning I'm moving on in that he saith a new covenant he he hath made the first oh now that which decayth and watches oh is ready to vanish away now I'm gonna say this to you this is a very serious message because I want you to understand we're right at the bridge foreign [Music] image outside Hallelujah he knows you see we're not going to Bow ourselves some to some great man but he gets Us in the way of science Hallelujah you know that's the battle right now and that's why come on somebody let me let me say it like this so yeah I know it we're not under the law but I want you to say I'm so fast so many of you could give God worship reading you know just thanking God all day when the Jewish day was like 12 hours you'd have to cut your cell phone off you have to cut your monitor off you would have to shut yourself in somewhere you would have to really give your and listen all your business calls y'all know what I'm saying the business what what if I'm telling you from an experience when I wake up in the morning if I'm not careful before falling on my knees for my cell phone y'all hear what I'm saying it's a bad habit you put the phone before God because once you start on that phone God is no longer first [Music] I'm just telling you Satan is making us uh you know grieving God that we put other things before him put your children before you can put yourself Hallelujah and these are the little things that we don't see my idols and these very same things that will choke the love of God out of you this is plain English it's simple it's a sampler but it's powerful song Because 99 of us are probably doing that is right somebody then text you and before you know it you're trying to answer the text before you praying God that Devil Knows Hallelujah you love the Lord see we we we got to understand that science of worship right now and we must be careful it's not the phone that's evil with it like I was telling the church in Lima I'm getting ready I said I can remember when the television used to be on the floor and you look down to see it well we don't put it up on the wall it's high and lifted up it's the truth so why and now we who is the head we we who is abroad we look up as though we worship you understand look what he's doing we're gonna stick your face he's got us bowing to the phone I'm gonna say it again and we don't even see I'm spiritual now I'm talking Spanish that's a little bit too much I'm telling you Satan knows what he's doing we spend more time on these things when then we do on our knees but then what happens we've seen so many kind of things connected with us and you say Lord why can't I pray why can't I kill you Hallelujah this is not the time to be disconnected hallelujah we're going to stay true to the world if the word of God you need to be born again you cannot have I don't believe a man I don't believe a woman with the Holy Ghost can be bored uh is that right brother Brandon said it like this he can't wait to the church door open Hallelujah y'all talking about time people even worship times when we got all this time we don't have time to come to church um yeah don't mess with my time now I'm going out to Texas Roadhouse Roadhouse you didn't know the brothers and sisters with me but my point is your time belonged to God is that right is it right the Bible even says redeem the time you understand time to be urgent differently staying true to them especially when you have a lot of friends true foreign [Music] and those worldly friends say come on man you can take a drink foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] God will stand Hallelujah listen even in your marriages you know sometimes the husband's wrong [Music] but you ought to be both Spirituals not your wife but you need to know when the devil is talking he knew that was not his wife [Music] Hallelujah [Music] think about it what are you doing you have to bring it was the devil s the person that you're speaking make you recognize is the devil Diablo and what do you do then you humble yourself honey you're right look how people are looking now but you have to acknowledge it is to keep unity in the house come on somebody sometimes it's hard to say okay you're almost dead Hallelujah but you gotta got it right right and wrong is wrong Hallelujah you love the Lord give me a little bit more time James 3 Hallelujah word be on your mind when I give you the holy ghosts it'll be written in the girl because when the Holy Ghost is in your heart or if you're thinking wrong he brings it and I'm so glad about it when bad thoughts come to my mind how do you how do you know because it's not coming from my heart [Music] but God ration is in the heart James 3 13-17 of the Saints just the other day about the rapture and I heard not from the outside but but hurry [Music] and I said unto the Lord what do you mean he said pray pray pray I'm just telling you I don't know whether you see things like I do sometimes it's the best way they look like look like dressed in white they moved right by the time I looked they were gone but I couldn't see it anybody know what I'm talking about I've had God to do me like that the intent was to do wrong good Morning anybody else you got something in your mind that ain't right then all of a sudden God Fest himself thank you Hallelujah who is a wise man and endure with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with neatness of wisdom is listen but if you have bitter envying and strife in your heart Glory not and not not against the truth is is in your heart your heart that's the devil God is divine love you don't lie against the truth don't prop you up like yourself don't puff yourself up more righteous than dogs [Music] we all need the blood of Jesus we need his grace not one of us no this wisdom this but it's Earthly sensual and devilishness and strife is confusion and every evil work yeah but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peace and easy without partiality exempt without him hypocrisy I found out that most Brothers don't have the Holy holy foreign because they foreign hello somebody Hey listen people say well yeah man I know what I'm talking about because when I was coming up before so we've been taught that so when it comes down to getting together you stopped up you plugged up your emotions came flow freely [Music] you have been in prison by false teachings y'all hear what I'm saying well why would God ask you I cry out the the Creator to be broken and no you can't do it Hallelujah look what he did took the most starchiest people in the world conservative people in the world Hallelujah but in those 10 days please Hallelujah Hallelujah and and sisters to YouTube you get to the place well ain't nobody gonna hurt me no more let me tell you something you'll never reach perfection [Music] pain come with this hello I'ma say it again with your pain come with perfection you got to go through something Hallelujah the Bible said you is in your own house this is where God oh come on somebody how to know better [Music] he did that to me Hallelujah you gotta love them anyway Hallelujah they said brother Branham loved his enemy so well you couldn't even tell his enemy from his friends Jesus love Judah so well not tell me the history same Holy Ghost God is good he said Lord I ain't there yet you can get there how bad like somebody preached the other day in Lima I mean Ohio yeah you bring the sacrifice but you go and get it bad do you want Heaven yes life is I was running okay we miles perjure you won't catch me doing it because y'all understand what I'm saying you get older your knees your feet everything begins to wear out on you Hallelujah you may have in your spirit you never grow old that's the danger that's why people be pulling muscles too you can do it Hallelujah but I said all of that to say it just seems like everything yesterday it moves so quick Hallelujah now the time that you have now I'm getting ready to move on but I want you to understand you being pulled by two forces and it all depends on what you're going to work with it Hallelujah don't even talk about the devil made me do it everything attempted when he is drawn away of his own lust going that theory and entice the problem ain't we got foreign and I see a parade of high-heeled shoes coming through every time I can't give you the revelation of that is but if you really really because God's word does not come back God's word don't come back boys es on the people that little thing you say oh God you want it so but you don't want to give um that means you got to give it up brother brother it is an unclean spirit because if you ever noticed a pig always walking on his heels shoes that's the way the pig feet is lift it up you see you see it's an unclean spirit I don't care how long your dress is you can have them with a train on them the spirit is a spirit on this presale and I'm trying to help you second Timothy 1 4 and 18 I'm almost done and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom to whom be glory forever and ever amen foreign Michelle hey let's do that better let's go again now and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil word and will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom to whom be glory forever and ever amen amen amen so when the Satan comes as you're bound and you can't be free give him the word the Lord shall deliver me from every evil word hallelujah this something new [Music] God admonishes us to have the same mind of our own the same spirit because there's only one Holy Spirit Hallelujah one with the word one with God one as husband and wife one spirit in the church we don't need all the spirits in the chat other than the holy ghosts when God chose to marry us hallelujah I didn't have this in my nerd notes earlier this morning brother Frank was uh telling us about this message marriage of the Lamb I don't know yeah uh I hope I'm helping somebody this morning I don't know about you but this message helped me and um you know I I could see God working and changing me that's what that's why I'm excited Hallelujah you know brother random said it like this you can be an artificial Christian artificial you know like artificial eyes a lot of artificial so you have artificial one way they do because they didn't come out from you so a real Christian is connected to God it is not artificial we came out from him and you know what it's it's amazing because accuracy God wants us to be to be connected the only way we lose Holy Ghost you want some sentence by his holy spirit Hallelujah in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and then then when his word become prominent in you yes it's you and Christ are one then do you hear that you become one then not one fighting the others if you abide in means that's what you doing you no more it's the word of God Christ in you you become one all right say why then another thing you know truth after she does that after she has fulfilled filled her vows talking about the bride and took her husband to be the name the bridegroom's name is refinery I believe what I just read but heaven did it have you had any thoughts within yourself that if I'm one why doesn't this happen or why this doesn't happen because the word of God is right but you see if you're wearing false teeth that won't work if you your kids a show of something it's not going to work you must be connected and you're connected by the Holy Spirit by one Spirit are we baptized into one body I'm not even because once you connected God is obligated Hallelujah and one thing I know about it then once you understand that you're connected you are you know you're connected you're no longer a Wanderer Hallelujah you know I thank God for each and every one of you those of you who are still standing you you've got substance if the devil tells you that you don't you do you have something no matter what the changes have been in this church I know that you're not connected to me you're connected to him you understand me because times are going to get harder and it's going to become more difficult Hallelujah is that right right but you must always remember I'll never leave and not only that my Covenant is a covenant of promise and I don't care what I'm going through my Covenant is a covenant of promise Hallelujah and some of us will some of us will miss let me put it this way I know I'm Heaven bound I don't know how to tell you this but I know that's heaven but my point is this I don't want to miss the rapture I can't be lost [Music] so remember that he'll never leave you know for safely uh my message was more Down to Earth but I tell you the saints of God you don't get your houses in order it's like a crack it's like a crack it gets worse right and none of us have seen a crack mend itself so why the Lord Jesus Christ is available you know one day he's not going to be available is available to really seek the Lord the Bible said if you seek me you will find me amen amen I love the Lord [Music] oh my soul Rejoice take joy my king [Music] may it be a sweet sweets let's raise our hands to the Lord me begin you know and I live my voice [Music] to worship you oh my soul release yours take joy my king Hallelujah in what you hear may be a sweet sweet [Music] peace out [Music] one more time is our story to come oh I love you Lord and I lived my voice to worship you oh my soul [Music] rejoice [Music] in what you hear may it be a sweet a sweet sweet [Music] one of the things that I want to do is that I know also why some sisters wear those shoes I don't remember all I can say is correct it comes to the world you know wonderful job [Music] [Applause] [Music] may God bless you we're gonna sing one song then we can
