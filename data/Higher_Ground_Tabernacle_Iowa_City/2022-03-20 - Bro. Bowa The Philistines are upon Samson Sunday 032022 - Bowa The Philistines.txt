TRANSCRIPT
========================================
father we coming before thee with everything that we are in disposed and we want to be ready for you lord to connect no fair blessing you know our weaknesses and our shortcomings but we come in before thy word for cell energy to receive strength and energy and energy i find it exercise so that we can go and fulfill our goal in the world because we know that's where the the satan is awaiting for us as in vernon was exposed event as we're coming to expose ourselves before your word before this son of righteousness so that he can shine upon us and bring to us all necessary [Music] and we believe that you've anointed it and god of mercy we want that everybody to listen to them maybe you will be unwinded lord and those who are going to speak upon it lord with your elements our sister let them be assisted by you asking the song because they are only the sons of men of mercy we surrender revelation chapter 3 14 to 19. i launched the legalized delaware dc jesus is revelation 3 14 2 to 19 and to the angel of the church of the literacy write these things saying the amen the faithful and the through witness the beginning of the creation of god i know your works that you are neither cold nor heart i could wish you i could wish you were called a heart so then because you are lukewarm and need a cold or heart i will vomit you out of my mouth because you say i'm rich have become wealthy and have need of nothing and do not know that you are wretched miserable poor blind and naked i counsel you to buy for me gold refined in the fire that you may be rich and white and white garments that you may be clothed that the shame of your neck of your nakedness may not be revealed and unwind your eyes with i serve that you may see as many as i love i rebuke and and cherish them therefore be zealous and repent okay listen foreign latest subject this morning samsung philistines are poor news simpson [Music] says in the message let's hear him [Music] is to rebuke things that are in the church so that it can be for the glory of god example exactly professor today you said sometimes i'm rebuking the act of or sons of men for those who confess to be christian de la vega and the way they are behaving in this day of the coming of the lord i'm saying it's not just it's not that i don't like you but i like you but we are the great the the great army in the march or being a great army [Music] you say if i see this line being broken with a destroying of the cultures or or the good genera i can never bear with that one to rebuke that that's what brahman says that's what i can do he said [Music] [Music] if you're going to see a physician knowing that you've got a symptoms of certain diseases and this disease is going to kill you and if the physician just tapping on your shirt and saying no you're in good health my friend oh for being alive oh it's gonna be okay it's gonna be everything gonna be worked but if a physician can come with the truth and having his or her that's the purpose of the word of god it repeated the predicate and the purpose of a priesthood is to restore things or to repeal things that are in the church for the for the glory of god vascular minister sessions responsibility the ministry is a responsibility take great responsibility minister and a person who's a minister salute to speak about this subject uh samsung phil stands upon you fell to the general against the massage i've just done a general studies about the message is a person anymore i'm not talking about this church personally legalized that's an assembly but i've seen the church in in all legalization there's such a call message at the church of the messenger [Music] [Music] and we're checking the temperatures in the church it's below zero but when we look at a condition in which the church even this morning no some of ramadan is only possible we're still far away from that and a february says samson party samson and or the word of god god was working with them samson and there was a victory every time no finish time could stand against samsung samsung he wasn't given up he he didn't give himself some sort of first set the ground to her but when he made this great mistake just to give his body to god is uniform and his heart gave it to a woman that's where samson was overcome coming as we read it [Music] [Music] but today we will look at church and we're asking ourselves if the lord is terrible in his churches because the glory of god is gone the church become dried up formalistic what formerly stretched up nothing of good in the church while something [Music] [Music] with the daughters of the world [Music] wanted to know the secret of the church of the bride and the in the church is as revealed to the devil people coming sick and they go back with their sicknesses people come to your problem and they take it back all that because the church has revealed his secret to the world the church has led the world getting get good among him that's why things are the way you see them samson was a great man as she was following the lord you very much and she was following the commandment of god as long as the church walks with a with god god [Music] and god will never use the church or an individual only if the church walks faithfully to his commandments gonna use the church which today it's with god and tomorrow night [Music] if the church doesn't obey the commandment of god an individual no observer or an individual doesn't faithfully observe the commandment of god what i'm saying god is not going to use him he's going to put him aside and god will find someone else or something else to you that's why my brothers and sisters [Music] we're going to pay attention to work faithfully like god have spoken to joshua's way he said [Music] i recommend you to act faithfully that's how you're going to be successful in everything that god's word [Music] joshua should observe the word of god you should observe the word of god so that he can act according to what god have said and the consequences it was a success but now my brother and sisters as i told you we gotta pay attention [Music] but you are already put aside by god the glory of god is no longer on you maybe god will never come and tell you that but he said you have to act faithfully according to his word so that's the commandment of god thank you as long as simpson was following god god was using him [Music] those um we are in a time where god is using what we call win-win god has to see his benefit in everything else if he doesn't see any benefit of [Music] and the church shall never stop and he's going to replace you by someone else he will never stop listening he had a good start everything [Music] with the people of the world that was the first step for him to backslade when you see a brother come to church i'm busy busy busy busy i'm busy every time busy that's the first step of him he was sitting here on the first round i played this man after two three weeks you are now sitting in the back after some days you're gonna see you are close to the door costa so just notice that the person is already backsladed alexis he's laughing at me you think i'm talking about him i'm not talking about your brother listen to these brothers [Music] you can always remember that once you have a bad company you are outside of the will of god my problem my own mother was telling me to tell kush a dog that has got some disease on his skin maybe i'm not going to say this we got the sound bad but it takes a lot of meaning if you sleep together with a dog that has got disease on the skin you're going to have those diseases you cannot be in association with the things of the world anything that should be spiritual no when you associate yourself with the things of the world god's spirit and you think you're gonna be spiritual do you know you will never be spiritual anymore today is another day february another old man was saying tell me people that you're visiting then i will tell you who you are i think i don't have many comments on about this because branham is already afraid and he said call it leaves the commander freaking tell them all and when the church start visiting world settle that's where they're gonna be only things of the world is going the church is going to lose the fellowship with the with the church with god that's the and the church is going to lose the fellowship with the holy ghost the church is going to lose the fellowship with god that's the second thing and it's gonna lose the fellowship with angels and the church gonna lose the heritage of god god shows that's the fourth thing there comes some song and when the church starts flirting with uh with the word like samson did the church gonna lose the fellowship with the holy ghost he's gonna lose the fellowship with god we're gonna lose the fellowship with danger it's going to lose its inheritance that's the four things the church is gonna lose and what you're gonna [Music] now brothers and sisters [Music] now we're getting to where we read in revelation chapter 3 we're going to get to that let's go back to samson samsung become and became blind after giving a secret to daily life the same thing with the church of little sea that became blind basketball but she doesn't know that she's she's blind people could be physically having their side man spiritual my son but spiritually they are blind let's jump please people coming to church vision spiritually they come to church with a spiritual side already blind dogmas and creeds technology science and technology people of people from outside they don't even know how there's no more good moral in the church [Music] there's no more difference between them and you laughing their sacrifice the life of those who goes to church is no more sorted that's why he doesn't give things to those who are outside to come to church [Music] those people outside they are sincere they don't want [Music] from us i can look at it they are thirsty to become like us that's what we're supposed to do that's the church in the matter we are christian soldiers that's why sick people are going back with their sicknesses with a problem no solutions to the basket just because the change of people that just churches they're redeemed of god it's not the four or four wars that we have here listen what brother i'm saying he said those people of the church of the lord name the church of the first person god needs such a people [Music] god has to call people and shape them people shaped by god to build this message he doesn't care take care about his own position but they are ready to go in the training furnace they are ready to go in there [Music] they will stay in the shock that's the kind of formation that the shaping that god is giving people and that's how god is shaping his own people why am i sir you see my brother and sisters god is taking his people through many trials to purify them and maybe takes years to get them and random says what circles your questions what i believe tonight second year american amen is that god right now and then therefore they tell us something is shaping this kind of until they can lose their feet that's the kind of people god is shaping today [Music] right now god is shaping you who can bear this message and he let them pass through many trials so that they can be there either in their faith in their victories they can go forward they know that god exists they fear oh my brothers sisters now listen to this also people are neither hard or cold and brother says not to have a position that's the worst condition so what's your identity people is because they shove like your butt like a butt that is teeth when they say that you're a christian they see that you're a christian today you're enjoying with christians so once you're out there i don't need your advice everything even in your dream you never dream that you've got holy ghosts even in a dream you never dreamed that you got a holy ghost it shows that the glory of god but this church is a part of the church's message i mean uh message churches because i don't live with you here and i don't even pay attention to that i'm living my own life that's all i just put myself in i just oh surrender myself to god and god is giving you what to say i don't even want to know the private life of people here if you did something and you are you are you're you are wrong in that month [Music] things that are sometimes you can advise them they will tell you no i don't need your advice the holy or maybe somebody was going after women they said sit down look at him you sent this whole package okay let's read it in the in the baptism of holy ghost you if you have never been a dragon man if if he was a drunkard man if he was a drunkard man it will show you where it has been delivered or not you say that you've been delivered are we already delivered we are delivered we are delivered just try him see if he said that he's already delivered just take a bottle of beer a fresh beer shake a bush under his mouth and [Music] [Music] he said if a man was uh was going after women if he was such a bad person was destroying feminists he said just put a woman without clothes before him he's gonna tell you who he is that's wrong i'm saying not me [Music] if you say that you're a christian okay oh there are two men you know and outside you living another kind of life [Music] oh father send me the fight force sometimes you have to have patience if somebody's saying i can do it i can do it nothing the pocket shows them never never expect something good from such a person that's what branham said she said to the person who said i know everything he [Music] remember we don't even know his true identity okay as you said you can go upon the earth my children you have seen that i'm sending them upon the earth or animal bodies remember this person is human even human bodies the falcon forgotten the mission that was given and the worst things that's the hypocrite he forgotten the mission that was that was given to him no waited for the falcon to come back in the ark it never come back you've seen that the falcon is gone forever and never come back whom shall i send against to bring us the evidence that the earth is now good so that we can go out there there was nobody answering just ask a person away until the father know her what's he dear he said columb you the doubt you dive i want you to go out away uh the dad said no further the person who's not worthy that's the weary person to go so you have to go he forced the doubt and the death went out yes the dove doesn't eat uh rotten things because it's got no uh something to work without in in the stomach if it eats such things in a stomach it's going to kill her they try to to to land upon the dead bodies it forgot the mission that was given to them and they're going to fund their place when the word of god is preaching they rejoice when they go in the next language they rejoice [Music] if somebody's [Music] but if somebody comes here and start just saying no you're going to those night clubs where they dance you're watching the bed programs on the tv you are committing adultery against christ you're committing a territory against christ while you're calling him husband [Music] and it's time for us to clean our house because the the coming of the lord let us meditate uh he said i'm standing at the door and i'm knocking say lucky whoever hear my voice and who shall open the door i should go in and i will suffer with him is is a supper but not a common problem so that's not a problem [Music] my problem is the state in which christ is in his own church is found outside of his own and now he's knocking on the door and saying imagine you've got your own house christ which is outside of the church today but i'm just representing all those who have been in domination they were teaching that grace crushed who's here is the one born from the village but when the evening light protestant people preached him this morning they never refused him but now christ is outside of the church i'm saying he is the one who revealed himself like the word of god same yesterday how can i overcome and all this other [Music] and she called them the unclean works so what is it about say like a christian tell me oh they said publicly that's where christ was pulled outside of his own church they never show him like he was inside the leg he was pulled outside of his own church and he's trying to go back inside do you see my brother and sisters christ outside of his church he is the one who is revealing himself like the word of god and when letters and he's gonna harden their [Music] uh revelation [Music] victory in everything unless it has a revelation a true revelation of what the true church of god should be yes jesus yes that's true so the truth is amen christ is a man who was the truth in this last days we have received the same truth christ again in the men [Music] who's the word life and the way and once you recognize that in [Music] the [Music] i is to oppose against the evils that's the people's word god has called you to the message and the revelation of what you are god's been specially sir what to go to heaven look at that short man up there the one upon the mountain that shot says that's the person who knows the way to go to heaven [Music] yes my brother sisters yes my brother but samson was waiting for the new hero if it happened i should fail somewhere if it happened that she would have shot in support and to tell him lord save me it's true that i've messed up somewhere but i will repent myself [Applause] grant me your peace what means and the lord gonna help you certainly amen amen this is there's a power in the blood [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh oh is [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh is [Music]

lord jesus for the remission of your sins is there any party this morning men or women that regret his own life that he lived a decision this morning to follow the law about them by taking the baptism in the name of the lord jesus because it's the only baptism that gives lies that the party says if you are baptized in the name of the lord jesus [Music] you've got no salvation and you've never received the forgiveness of your sin is there anybody don't be ashamed of the lord that's the only occasion that is given to you [Music] that the lord can give you salvation [Music] [Music] [Music] i
