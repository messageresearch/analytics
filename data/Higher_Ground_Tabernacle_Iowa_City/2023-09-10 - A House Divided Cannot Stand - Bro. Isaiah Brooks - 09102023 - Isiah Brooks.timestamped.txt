[54:00] and exalt you
[54:02] that you should earnestly in the state
[54:05] which was once delivered
[54:23] for there are certain men perhaps in
[54:27] unawares
[54:29] who were before of old ordained to the
[54:33] this condemnation
[54:35] ungodly men turning the grace of God
[54:38] into lasciviousness

[56:03] from heaven
[56:05] and returneth not thither
[56:07] but watereth the Earth

[56:14] that it may give seed to the sower and
[56:17] bread to the eater

[57:50] the praise
[57:53] in Jesus Christ
[57:57] amen amen you may be seated
[58:07] I like to teach or preach
[58:11] a little message
[58:15] I started this message in the morning
[58:18] I'd like to preach it here
[58:24] a subject is A House Divided
[58:28] cannot stand up
[58:36] I read these two passages of scripture
[58:41] and one seemed like it's going uh in in
[58:44] a different direction than the other
[58:46] yeah
[58:50] in the book of Jude
[58:53] we see a Jude
[58:57] we see him
[58:59] encouraging the Saints
[59:03] to fight for that which they know is
[59:06] right
[59:10] and then we find Jude
[59:14] making the church aware please
[59:18] that there are men among them
[59:23] who is ordained for a different purpose
[59:30] these men according to the scripture
[59:34] was before old ordained it is
[59:44] turning the grace of God into
[59:47] lasciviousness sensuous
[59:54] acts and things of that nature
[59:57] come down denying the only Lord God
[1:00:02] in our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:05] but here in Isaiah is a Isaiah is
[1:00:10] talking about the seed of God
[1:00:15] and how that God plant the seeds God
[1:00:20] Waters the seeds
[1:00:22] God gives the increase of the seeds
[1:00:27] but this seed he's speaking of Manassas
[1:00:31] is his word
[1:00:34] how his word goes out of his mouth
[1:00:37] and will not come back void
[1:00:43] here in this scripture
[1:00:45] I find my Assurance
[1:00:51] to know that the seed s that has been
[1:00:55] planted in me that has been planted in
[1:00:59] you
[1:01:00] it's a seed that God himself planted
[1:01:04] Hallelujah
[1:01:08] with this seed yeah Alexis Ramos the
[1:01:12] word
[1:01:13] becomes the god of your soul

[1:01:21] with this yeah
[1:01:23] the word becomes
[1:01:28] the god of your soul Hallelujah
[1:01:34] because it is the word
[1:01:38] in you and I or you and me that have
[1:01:43] been promised
[1:01:44] and we have been promised
[1:01:47] Hallelujah victory in this hour
[1:01:51] no matter what we go through
[1:01:55] no matter how it looks no matter how it
[1:02:00] feels

[1:02:05] the word
[1:02:08] that has gone out of his Hallelujah
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:41] now say

[1:02:48] but we are the children of the light
[1:02:51] Hallelujah
[1:02:54] and you and I we know
[1:02:57] those of us who have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:00] we know that all Christians are not
[1:03:04] Christians Hallelujah
[1:03:08] we do not judge them
[1:03:11] we do not separate ourselves from them
[1:03:15] Hallelujah but we do recognize
[1:03:20] we'll bring forth
[1:03:25] we did not come on to produce Wesley
[1:03:30] we did not come
[1:03:32] to produce the Pentecostals
[1:03:36] but we came to produce
[1:03:40] the word himself
[1:03:43] Jesus Christ manifested in the flesh
[1:03:46] Jesus Christ
[1:03:48] we have the highest
[1:03:53] [Music]
[1:03:55] Hallelujah it is in this hour
[1:03:59] the world will recognize that Jesus
[1:04:03] Christ is come
[1:04:05] in the flesh
[1:04:09] yes sir
[1:04:11] in the beginning
[1:04:13] God shows Adam
[1:04:16] as his house
[1:04:22] he God came in the cool of the evening
[1:04:26] even though he walked with Adam
[1:04:30] Adam at that time
[1:04:33] was the housing of God
[1:04:36] hallelujah when you looked at Adams
[1:04:40] Hallelujah
[1:04:45] Adam was the mouthpiece of God
[1:04:49] was the visible of God
[1:04:52] hallelujah yes sir
[1:04:56] to Adam stood in a position
[1:04:59] where he could see in the natural father
[1:05:06] as well as the dimension in which God
[1:05:09] lived here
[1:05:10] hallelujah Adam was such a being I don't
[1:05:14] think that he was able to fellowship
[1:05:17] with God
[1:05:19] and God was able to fellowship with him
[1:05:24] but we know what the serpent did
[1:05:29] Hallelujah the Bible says that Satan
[1:05:33] comes to steal kill and destroy
[1:05:37] Hallelujah and how does he do it he
[1:05:42] comes to divide Hallelujah
[1:05:46] Satan comes to divide
[1:05:49] and that's what Jesus even says
[1:05:51] hallelujah
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:02] when God created Adam
[1:06:05] he created him male and female
[1:06:08] if a female as long as he was in that
[1:06:12] conditions
[1:06:24] so God separated him male and female is
[1:06:29] that right Hallelujah
[1:06:32] Adam I don't Not only was
[1:06:36] uh spirit
[1:06:37] but he was Flesh and Blood
[1:06:41] Hallelujah and he gave Eve
[1:06:45] his spiritual Parts he still was called
[1:06:48] Adam that mean they had the same yeah
[1:06:55] his name was Adam her name was Adam
[1:07:00] the same nature
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:07] but watch what the devil did yeah
[1:07:15] by the way of
[1:07:18] it
[1:07:19] he changed the meaning of the word
[1:07:24] and Eve was seduced
[1:07:28] and believe what the serpent said
[1:07:32] and she failed
[1:07:45] [Music]
[1:07:50] [Music]
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:19] Hallelujah and so you must understand
[1:08:24] the opening of the word
[1:08:26] the revealing of The Shield
[1:08:28] the sounding of the Thunders
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:35] where we can stand within a Oneness
[1:08:42] we can stand as a Oneness
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:08:51] until you're born again
[1:08:55] you've got to have the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:58] fires
[1:09:07] [Music]
[1:09:09] now
[1:09:10] we look at this day
[1:09:13] this day and the prophet God teaches us
[1:09:21] it could never change the relationship
[1:09:26] he was a son
[1:09:37] this is why Jesus
[1:09:39] Jesus
[1:09:42] your names were already written in the
[1:09:46] land Book of Life y'all hear what I'm
[1:09:49] saying you are already preserved
[1:09:54] but it took a sacrifice
[1:10:00] in order for God to bring Fellowship
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:06] back to himself I'll remember with his
[1:10:10] creation
[1:10:11] Hallelujah I want to give you some
[1:10:14] thoughts
[1:10:20] after God had created everything
[1:10:23] to choose the Bible said on the seventh
[1:10:26] day he died
[1:10:28] in that seventh day was Jesus
[1:10:35] you understand me
[1:10:38] now think about this he was able to
[1:10:41] Fellowship with Adam you think about the
[1:10:43] community
[1:10:46] there was no Bridge
[1:10:48] there was no hindrance
[1:10:55] but when since the fall
[1:10:59] Hallelujah it brought a bridge
[1:11:02] but God was so mindfulness
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:48] when you did
[1:11:59] he said if if anything defiles
[1:12:03] today
[1:12:11] do you understand me
[1:12:15] thank God for the grace of God
[1:12:22] even Israel couldn't keep that
[1:12:25] that law said law and every time I think
[1:12:29] about when Paul says
[1:12:31] he was blameless
[1:12:35] I'm still not yet Hallelujah
[1:12:46] because even though you do not believe
[1:12:48] all the words
[1:12:51] this flesh don't always obey it all
[1:12:55] somebody y'all hear what I'm saying we
[1:12:59] believe it all
[1:13:00] but this flesh
[1:13:02] is it is
[1:13:05] the only reason why I'm blameless
[1:13:11] it's because of the blood of Jesus
[1:13:13] Christ
[1:13:14] [Music]
[1:13:19] that was Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah
[1:13:25] so what did Satan love Division
[1:13:29] I don't know about anything going on
[1:13:31] here but this is what God helped me to
[1:13:33] preacher Hallelujah
[1:13:36] because Satan cannot stand to see a
[1:13:41] church on one Accord
[1:13:46] Hallelujah I'm gonna say it again
[1:13:49] if this church would move into one
[1:13:53] accordingness
[1:13:56] you see God move
[1:13:58] in a powerful way
[1:14:01] Hallelujah but he knows if he can keep
[1:14:05] you judging one another
[1:14:10] picking at one another
[1:14:13] jealous of one another
[1:14:16] if he gets some carnality
[1:14:20] to take pre-eminence in this church
[1:14:25] is invited
[1:14:27] easy and the Bible says A House Divided
[1:14:34] y'all hear what I'm saying even brother
[1:14:37] Branham says if they'll rise there's a
[1:14:40] problem in the church
[1:14:42] he said don't take sides is
[1:14:45] that right you don't take signs you seek
[1:14:50] the will of God
[1:14:54] Jesus
[1:14:59] it doesn't matter what the Deacon says
[1:15:02] no matter what the preacher says no
[1:15:05] matter what the ushers are the trusties
[1:15:14] [Music]
[1:15:17] Hallelujah
[1:15:24] if
[1:15:29] this is
[1:15:35] he knows you will be a problem in the
[1:15:38] church
[1:15:42] imma say it again if Satan gets can get
[1:15:46] families
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:16:03] Hallelujah yes it is why he knows that
[1:16:07] he's here in order to have a unified
[1:16:11] you must first start with the family
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:17] in order to
[1:16:20] happen you must first start with the
[1:16:23] family
[1:16:24] because the child charge is made up of
[1:16:27] family
[1:16:34] because let me
[1:16:37] limit families let me say it like this
[1:16:39] if
[1:16:40] you've got problems in your house
[1:16:43] and they are not resolved
[1:16:47] Satan will come in
[1:16:51] you're going to have sicknesses you're
[1:16:54] going to have all kinds of problems
[1:16:57] in your house because you're not on one
[1:17:01] Accord
[1:17:02] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:17:05] but when you're on watercolors
[1:17:08] you stand like the Rock of Gibraltar
[1:17:11] voice
[1:17:12] Satan cannot penetrate is
[1:17:15] that right come on somebody
[1:17:18] we don't know but Rahab family believed
[1:17:24] but she got her entire family
[1:17:31] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:17:33] she got her entire family
[1:17:42] an angel could not destroy her house
[1:18:00] your ideas matters not
[1:18:04] only the word of God matters
[1:18:11] Hallelujah
[1:18:13] look look what Jacob went through
[1:18:17] when he had Rachel and Leo
[1:18:20] look at all the confusion they had to go
[1:18:22] through
[1:18:24] what about Abraham and Sarah they want
[1:18:26] one Accord
[1:18:30] producer Jacob and the Esau
[1:18:33] is always fussing and fighting it too
[1:18:36] Hallelujah is that right and the Bible
[1:18:40] Bible confused
[1:18:42] is
[1:18:47] what I'm saying
[1:18:50] I'm trying to bring us to a place where
[1:18:51] we could be delivered
[1:18:54] we need Jesus zombies we need more God
[1:18:59] we I'm not talking about just you I said
[1:19:01] nothing about I need more cups
[1:19:03] Hallelujah
[1:19:06] why because I want my wife
[1:19:15] and as far as
[1:19:20] far as sometimes things get a little
[1:19:22] rocky yes
[1:19:25] everybody that's married know what I'm
[1:19:27] saying right it doesn't always go smooth
[1:19:33] just like you fight to keep your
[1:19:35] Christianity
[1:19:46] Hallelujah but when you stand for the
[1:19:49] world
[1:19:50] the Lord will stand for you
[1:19:55] Hallelujah
[1:19:57] hallelujah hallelujah God does not
[1:20:00] change
[1:20:01] he cannot change and I love that about
[1:20:04] him
[1:20:05] Hallelujah everything we do is hinged
[1:20:09] upon the word of God hallelujah
[1:20:12] is that right
[1:20:14] Hallelujah Hebrews 8.
[1:20:20] for this is the Covenant that I will
[1:20:21] make with the house of Israel and I want
[1:20:25] to say this because why most of us have
[1:20:28] trouble

[1:21:28] and he said
[1:21:31] we Holy Ghost fires
[1:21:34] all the demons away
[1:21:38] so is it with a man
[1:21:44] when God fills you your soul with the
[1:21:48] Holy Ghost in fire
[1:21:51] all the demons away

[1:21:59] of what it moves from the soul
[1:22:05] it burns Devils out of your spirit
[1:22:07] Hallelujah
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:17] hallelujah amen that's why God converts
[1:22:20] the soul
[1:22:22] you can control the flesh
[1:22:27] let me move on I will put my laws into
[1:22:30] their heart
[1:22:31] and write them in their heart and I will
[1:22:35] be to them a God and they shall be to me
[1:22:38] a people
[1:22:42] um
[1:22:47] and they shall not teach every man his
[1:22:50] neighbor and every man is
[1:22:53] know the Lord
[1:22:55] for All Shall know me from the least to
[1:22:59] the greatest

[1:23:24] will I remember no more

[1:23:40] to the serpent
[1:23:42] he placed
[1:23:46] is
[1:23:49] to whom you yield your members to obey
[1:23:51] is
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:23:57] that right if you yield to the
[1:24:01] internet the devil
[1:24:04] y'all understand me that's to what the
[1:24:07] scriptures are saying if you yield your
[1:24:10] members to obey him you just about to
[1:24:13] Satan to do his spinning
[1:24:18] I'm moving on in that he saith
[1:24:23] a new covenant
[1:24:26] he he hath made the first oh now that
[1:24:30] which decayth and watches oh is ready to
[1:24:34] vanish away
[1:24:41] now I'm gonna say this to you this is a
[1:24:44] very serious message
[1:24:46] because I want you to understand
[1:24:49] we're right at the bridge foreign
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:24] image outside Hallelujah
[1:25:29] he knows you see we're not going to Bow
[1:25:33] ourselves some to some great man
[1:25:37] but he gets Us
[1:25:40] in the way of science Hallelujah
[1:25:45] you know that's the battle right now
[1:25:50] and that's why
[1:25:53] come on somebody let me let me say it
[1:25:57] like this so yeah
[1:26:08] I know it we're not under the law but I
[1:26:11] want you to say I'm so fast
[1:26:12] so many of you could give God
[1:26:15] worship
[1:26:22] reading you know just thanking God all
[1:26:25] day
[1:26:27] when the Jewish day was like 12 hours
[1:26:36] you'd have to cut your cell phone off
[1:26:39] you have to cut your monitor off
[1:26:42] you would have to shut yourself in
[1:26:45] somewhere
[1:26:47] you would have to really give your and
[1:26:50] listen all your business calls
[1:26:55] y'all know what I'm saying the business
[1:26:57] what
[1:27:00] what if I'm telling you from an
[1:27:01] experience
[1:27:02] when I wake up in the morning
[1:27:05] if I'm not careful before falling on my
[1:27:09] knees
[1:27:10] for my cell phone
[1:27:16] y'all hear what I'm saying it's a bad
[1:27:18] habit
[1:27:20] you put the phone before God
[1:27:26] because once you start on that phone
[1:27:29] God is no longer first
[1:27:31] [Music]
[1:27:35] I'm just telling you
[1:27:37] Satan is making us uh you know grieving
[1:27:40] God
[1:27:42] that we put other things before him
[1:27:49] put your children before you can put
[1:27:53] yourself
[1:27:55] Hallelujah and these are the little
[1:27:58] things that we don't
[1:28:01] see
[1:28:02] my idols
[1:28:05] and these very same things
[1:28:08] that will choke the love of God out of
[1:28:11] you
[1:28:16] this is plain English
[1:28:23] it's simple it's a sampler but it's
[1:28:25] powerful song Because 99 of us are
[1:28:29] probably doing that is
[1:28:33] right somebody then text you and before
[1:28:36] you know it you're trying to answer the
[1:28:37] text before you praying
[1:28:42] God that Devil Knows
[1:28:45] Hallelujah you love the Lord see we we
[1:28:49] we got to understand that science
[1:28:53] of worship right now
[1:28:57] and we must be careful
[1:29:02] it's not the phone that's evil
[1:29:05] with it
[1:29:10] like I was telling the church in Lima
[1:29:12] I'm getting ready
[1:29:13] I said I can remember when the
[1:29:15] television used to be on the floor
[1:29:18] and you look down to see it
[1:29:22] well we don't put it up on the wall
[1:29:25] it's high and lifted up
[1:29:32] it's the truth so why and now we who is
[1:29:35] the head we we who is abroad we look up
[1:29:38] as though we worship you understand
[1:29:43] look what he's doing we're gonna stick
[1:29:46] your face he's got us bowing to the
[1:29:47] phone
[1:29:52] I'm gonna say it again
[1:29:56] and we don't even see I'm spiritual now
[1:29:59] I'm talking Spanish
[1:30:01] that's a little bit too much I'm telling
[1:30:03] you Satan knows what he's doing we spend
[1:30:07] more time on these things when then we
[1:30:09] do on our knees
[1:30:14] but then what happens we've seen so many
[1:30:18] kind of things
[1:30:24] connected with us
[1:30:34] and you say Lord why can't I pray why
[1:30:36] can't I kill you Hallelujah
[1:30:42] this is not the time to be disconnected
[1:30:49] hallelujah
[1:30:51] we're going to stay true to the world
[1:30:56] if the word of God
[1:30:59] you need to be born again
[1:31:04] you cannot have I don't believe a man I
[1:31:09] don't believe a woman with the Holy
[1:31:11] Ghost can be bored
[1:31:13] uh
[1:31:17] is that right brother Brandon said it
[1:31:20] like this
[1:31:27] he can't wait to the church door open
[1:31:36] Hallelujah y'all talking about time
[1:31:39] people even worship times
[1:31:42] when we got all this time we don't have
[1:31:46] time to come to church
[1:31:51] um
[1:31:52] yeah don't mess with my time now
[1:31:54] I'm going out to Texas Roadhouse
[1:31:58] Roadhouse you didn't know the brothers
[1:32:00] and sisters with me
[1:32:04] but my point is your time belonged to
[1:32:09] God
[1:32:12] is that right is it right the Bible even
[1:32:14] says redeem the time
[1:32:17] you understand
[1:32:19] time to be urgent differently
[1:32:26] staying true to
[1:32:27] them
[1:32:29] especially when you have a lot of
[1:32:31] friends true
[1:33:00] foreign
[1:33:33] [Music]
[1:33:34] and those worldly friends say come on
[1:33:36] man you can take a drink

[1:34:17] Hallelujah
[1:34:21] listen even in your marriages
[1:34:23] you know sometimes the husband's wrong
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:29] but you ought to be both Spirituals
[1:34:39] not your wife
[1:34:42] but you need to know when the devil is
[1:34:45] talking
[1:34:56] he
[1:34:59] knew that was not his wife
[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:07] Hallelujah
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:28] think about it
[1:35:30] what are you doing
[1:35:33] you have to bring

[1:35:45] s
[1:35:47] the person that you're speaking

[1:36:08] is
[1:36:11] to keep unity in the house

[1:36:19] sometimes it's hard to say okay

[1:50:52] something new
[1:51:03] [Music]
[1:51:25] God admonishes us to have the same mind
[1:51:29] of our own the same spirit
[1:51:32] because there's only one Holy Spirit
[1:51:35] Hallelujah one with the word one with
[1:51:39] God one as husband and wife
[1:51:43] one spirit in the church we don't need
[1:51:47] all the spirits in the chat other than
[1:51:50] the holy ghosts
[1:51:55] when God chose to marry us hallelujah
[1:51:59] I didn't have this in my nerd notes
[1:52:02] earlier this morning
[1:52:04] brother Frank was uh telling us about
[1:52:07] this message marriage of the Lamb I
[1:52:09] don't know
[1:52:12] yeah uh
[1:52:26] I hope I'm helping somebody this morning
[1:52:29] I don't know about you but this message
[1:52:32] helped me
[1:52:35] and um you know I I could see God
[1:52:38] working and changing me
[1:52:42] that's what that's why I'm excited
[1:52:44] Hallelujah
[1:52:48] you know brother random said it like
[1:52:49] this
[1:52:50] you can be an artificial Christian
[1:52:53] artificial you know like artificial eyes
[1:52:58] a lot of artificial
[1:53:01] so you have artificial
[1:53:07] one way they do because
[1:53:11] they didn't come out from you
[1:53:14] so a real Christian is connected to God
[1:53:18] it is not artificial
[1:53:21] we came out from him
[1:53:25] and you know what it's it's amazing
[1:53:27] because accuracy
[1:53:29] God wants us to be to be connected
[1:53:32] the only way we
[1:53:35] lose
[1:53:36] Holy Ghost you want some sentence by his
[1:53:39] holy spirit Hallelujah
[1:53:43] in the beginning
[1:53:45] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:53:49] the Word was God and the Word was made
[1:53:53] flesh
[1:53:55] and then then when his word become
[1:53:59] prominent in you yes
[1:54:03] it's you and Christ are one then
[1:54:09] do you hear that you become one then
[1:54:13] not one fighting the others
[1:54:18] if you abide in means
[1:54:23] that's what you
[1:54:25] doing
[1:54:27] you no more it's the word of God Christ
[1:54:32] in you you become one
[1:54:36] all right say why then another thing you
[1:54:39] know truth after she does that
[1:54:43] after she has fulfilled filled her vows
[1:54:45] talking about the bride
[1:54:49] and took her husband to be the name
[1:54:53] the bridegroom's name
[1:54:58] is
[1:55:10] refinery
[1:55:20] I believe what I just read
[1:55:25] but heaven did it
[1:55:28] have you had any thoughts within
[1:55:29] yourself
[1:55:32] that if I'm one
[1:55:35] why doesn't this happen
[1:55:38] or why
[1:55:40] this doesn't happen because
[1:55:43] the word of God is right
[1:55:46] but you see if you're wearing false
[1:55:49] teeth
[1:55:55] that won't work
[1:55:57] if you your
[1:56:00] kids
[1:56:02] a show of something
[1:56:06] it's not going to work
[1:56:09] you must be connected
[1:56:12] and you're connected by the Holy Spirit
[1:56:16] by one Spirit are we baptized into one
[1:56:19] body
[1:56:21] I'm not even
[1:56:29] because once you connected
[1:56:32] God is obligated
[1:56:41] Hallelujah
[1:56:43] and one thing I know about it
[1:56:46] then once you understand that you're
[1:56:49] connected you are you know you're
[1:56:50] connected
[1:56:52] you're no longer a Wanderer
[1:56:56] Hallelujah
[1:56:58] you know I thank God for each and every
[1:57:00] one of you
[1:57:02] those of you who are still standing
[1:57:06] you you've got substance if the devil
[1:57:10] tells you that you don't you do you have
[1:57:12] something
[1:57:17] no matter what the changes have been in
[1:57:20] this church
[1:57:21] I know that you're not connected to me
[1:57:25] you're connected to him
[1:57:29] you understand me because times are
[1:57:32] going to get harder and it's going to
[1:57:34] become more difficult
[1:57:36] Hallelujah is that right right but you
[1:57:40] must always remember
[1:57:44] I'll never leave
[1:57:51] and not only that
[1:57:53] my Covenant
[1:57:56] is a covenant of promise
[1:58:01] and I don't care what I'm going through
[1:58:03] my Covenant is a covenant of promise
[1:58:39] Hallelujah and some of us will some of
[1:58:42] us will miss
[1:58:45] let me put it this way
[1:58:49] I know I'm Heaven bound
[1:58:53] I don't know how to tell you this but I
[1:58:55] know that's heaven
[1:58:56] but my point is this
[1:58:59] I don't want to miss the rapture
[1:59:04] I can't be lost
[1:59:05] [Music]
[1:59:11] so remember that he'll never leave you
[1:59:14] know for safely
[1:59:24] uh my message was more Down to Earth
[1:59:29] but I tell you the saints of God
[1:59:32] you don't get your houses in order
[1:59:37] it's like a crack
[1:59:42] it's like a crack
[1:59:44] it gets worse
[1:59:47] right
[1:59:48] and none of us have seen a crack mend
[1:59:50] itself
[2:00:00] so
[2:00:10] why the Lord Jesus Christ is available
[2:00:14] you know one day he's not going to be
[2:00:16] available
[2:00:23] is available to
[2:00:27] really
[2:00:29] seek the Lord
[2:00:32] the Bible said if you seek me
[2:00:36] you will find me
[2:00:39] amen amen I love the Lord
