TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that is my father who lived in heaven if you set up here and upon [Music] the church is not based upon the person of peter upon the person of jesus himself by the church upon the revelation of who is jesus that's where the church is built [Music] we're living in an age where the manifestation of the world should come in another age not of or that of uh and it's true i am a person without knowledge [Music] but you can never go beyond the nation basket everyday because god is working into the continuity through the nature it is a sister commerciality he said it's just like the way it is father who is the master of revelation and the second mystery is the revelation itself which is the rock on which the church has to be buried that was given to a man which means peter who represented a church hello [Music] god has revealed himself to the children predestination when cain and ever came out to worship it was about revelation revelations he said i want god to accept my offering a laminated free disciple and he brought all the fruit of his reference and whenever came to worship [Music] then and all of that speaks about jesus over islam god but god has slaughtered his lamb in his mind before the foundation of the world so being positioned just being well placed about it before the foundation of the the lord jesus your devout yellow patient that lame has to attack the sin in the type but now let us analyze this celebrity it means that i don't ever participation before adam and eve sin god has already provided a lamb for their sins why did he provide us salvation there were many attributes in him the attribute you suffered the attribute of the sentence the attribute of a healing attribute that's god has worked so hard to say had i ever appreciated to bring adam and eve to fall is that the core are you i are you with me do you agree with me i die heaven have a purpose yeah if adam and eve never so that god can manifest that attribute you suffer the attribute that's not my subject this morning is a very respectable timing oh i have to check my time respect it every day is not sunday as they say shaggy for us to start reproducing us to reproduce ourselves the way we're doing it there's nothing nothing that has changed [Music] had to come upon the steps of gordon from heaven that he has to come down directly introduce himself before the high priest uh kept us in that time mechanic but when when the messiah came in that was so different from what they were thinking ain't not powerfully accepted and they never accept him consciously what jesus could say me and my father we won they took some stone they want to [Music] a different uh conception the way division among people and different understanding hello i said unto you and you don't believe it it's written you don't believe it because you are not one uh some of my my my ships and my voice my ship heard my voice and follow me eternal i give them eternal life [Music] and they'll never be lost and nobody shall take them from me [Music] [Music] but they understood that when he said he meant it memory it means that jesus was the father himself that was too much for them to believe it's only a long success foreign [Music] [Music] if i don't do my father's work then don't believe me message you but if i i'm happy just believe in the works that i'm doing so that you may recognize that the god the father is in me and i'm in the father then they got married [Music] and they wanted to hold him mainly but jesus escaped from their hands amen jesus said jesus escaped himself from their hands have you been lucky he knew what was going to happen if jesus have escaped are you going to stay there you gotta know hello [Music] stop me that's what abraham said jesus wasn't the second person of the deity no my affair no my brother god existed before the body of jesus christ was born meccano but when our god wanted to take a flesh a human flesh conditions he took the body of jesus christ forever [Music] he came you understand what you want [Music] he was a jewish no no [Music] jesus was not a jewish blood and he wasn't either the the the blood uh which is not jewish gentile's blood [Music] he was god's blood he didn't have a knee jesus he was neither jewish nor gentiles he imitates you he was god in a fierce concept a virgin shall conceive but now listen to what he said but now is the the egg that the chicken had given shall never ash a baby perfection because that that egg that egg wasn't uh uh fertile you son the life comes from blood luckily sex is a masculine which comes from a masculine testament secretary but in this car in this uh in this case of jesus sex masculine there wasn't a masculine sex over here do you see laughing down the sun life in the blood sacrifice developing digestion that life has to come from god himself is saying jesus wasn't either or neither uh jewish blood nor gentile's blood he could test a simple question why uh listen to this if you never understood that yes you confronted all your shows you're going to confuse things god when you want to manifest himself in the flesh and the human name of jesus is jesus christ that's he took the name of jesus amen that's the message and brother once you've got this kind of revelation allah you can prosper amen sir without them you can never prosper jerky said they followed the vote [Music] when you never believe to that that's what i'm saying if there's somebody today who exalted the lord jesus christ more than any other evangelist you will never see progress [Music] unless you believe in that that's what peter said then you'll be ready to get into spirit convocable if you want your sin to be atoned be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] when our girl wanted to take a human flesh born by a woman he took this body and somewhere are you well seated he said this is the eternal temple of the lord i don't have to do many comments about it to bring people to stand up no hot shots minister that's not a ministry listen to this protesters my church god build his church upon peter report he built a church upon himself christ answered the appear so between which means he has to build a church upon christmas said [Music] [Music] it's always who is jesus christ the book of revelation which is the revelation of jesus christ like i said [Music] gave birth to a son called but our god never existed but he has been before all of that we may face that sir yes my brother number this is sick i'm saying this for you to have a true revelation the revelation of who is christ the revelation of who you are satan always is against that basketball [Music] god is always like that that's the way he's doing things we may find herself yes my brother and sisters my nation's personality it doesn't change this nature we may face ourselves yes he said unto peter basket because you are peaceful this rock i shall build my church [Music] shall never overcome this revelation just because you've got this revelation that's why i'm giving you the kingdom whatever you [Music] the sickness the poor the testicles all these things affliction all afflictions never overcome upon you we may face ourselves yes my brothers that's why this morning david took five stones [Music] if jesus we may face ourselves yes brother and sister i said unto you jesus spoke to him ask them a question [Applause] that's the [Music] god god is a prophet the prophet the prophet the prophet of all prophets perfect the prophet god prophet god the prophet that i shake created amen
