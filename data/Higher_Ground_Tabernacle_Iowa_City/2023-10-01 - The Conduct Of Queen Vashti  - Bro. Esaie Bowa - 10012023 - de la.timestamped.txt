[1:03:35] following
[1:03:39] Sunday if it's me who's coming down the
[1:03:42] next Sunday I'll speak about
[1:03:47] Easter and about the Queen Esther going
[1:03:50] speak about two weeks or one or two
[1:03:53] weeks
[1:04:01] after that I'm going to bring a message
[1:04:04] upon the mission that God have given to
[1:04:06] the
[1:04:10] church then we're going to speak about
[1:04:13] another thing of the love of
[1:04:18] God I don't know how the Lord going to
[1:04:21] help us to do
[1:04:23] that but we just surrend ourself unto
[1:04:28] him I'm going to add up something else
[1:04:31] this
[1:04:33] morning and I hope everybody is doing
[1:04:35] good this
[1:04:38] morning who came with sleepiness in his
[1:04:44] pocket who came
[1:04:47] sleepy if you sleepy just stand
[1:04:53] up
[1:04:56] that's what shall be
[1:04:59] done now listen to
[1:05:06] this we talking about the conduct or the
[1:05:09] disobedient or the queen
[1:05:13] V V being a woman she represent the
[1:05:20] church but you will notice that because
[1:05:23] of his Disobedience she been replaced by
[1:05:26] by
[1:05:32] Esther I'm say it every time we talk
[1:05:35] about woman in the Bible ity the
[1:05:42] church last Sunday and today when I'm
[1:05:45] going to speak about the conduct or
[1:05:47] Disobedience
[1:05:53] of
[1:05:56] I'm not preaching it with a mind that
[1:05:59] our brothers should reject their
[1:06:04] wives but the thought behind what I'm
[1:06:09] preaching the church that has been
[1:06:12] represented
[1:06:15] by just because she was disobedient to a
[1:06:19] King Christ as well
[1:06:23] today if is in the presence of a church
[1:06:25] that is disobedient is going to reject
[1:06:28] that
[1:06:30] woman so we taking the type that happen
[1:06:33] in the
[1:06:35] natur to understand the spiritual
[1:06:47] things understand that we preaching it
[1:06:49] for our brothers to uh to to to divorce
[1:06:53] their wives or to beat their wives or
[1:06:58] something if you beat your wife and
[1:07:00] report you to the police that's your
[1:07:04] problem you going to answer for yourself
[1:07:07] you're not going to be
[1:07:16] there brother says the true man doesn't
[1:07:19] B his
[1:07:20] wife if you're really a man and
[1:07:23] something of
[1:07:25] man you never beat your
[1:07:29] wife not only your wife
[1:07:38] but the prophet say to know the level of
[1:07:42] the
[1:07:45] church you got to know what is or the
[1:07:49] level the spiritual level of the wom in
[1:07:51] that
[1:07:52] church see the spiritual level of women
[1:07:55] in that
[1:07:58] church then you will understand what is
[1:08:00] that
[1:08:02] church that's it is my
[1:08:06] brother and I also remember Prophet
[1:08:12] said in the Bible it says that the woman
[1:08:14] was the first to be
[1:08:16] seduced she has been deceived by the
[1:08:20] sep and since she has been deceived by
[1:08:22] the sep
[1:08:26] it's because she paid attention to the
[1:08:28] word of
[1:08:40] sep but the poison in the word of
[1:08:43] serpent didn't look like the
[1:08:47] poison seent words seem to be sweet to
[1:08:51] the ear of the
[1:08:52] woman
[1:08:56] the way the serpent was saying to a
[1:08:58] woman seemed to be so sweet to the ears
[1:09:01] of woman that's what made her to pay
[1:09:06] attention the woman understood that that
[1:09:08] was wonderful what
[1:09:12] the from that moment she pay attention
[1:09:14] to the
[1:09:17] devil
[1:09:22] she
[1:09:27] to what God
[1:09:32] Said now the woman consider much more
[1:09:35] what the enemy is saying than what God
[1:09:36] is telling
[1:09:37] her even what her husband is telling
[1:09:42] here now the woman has disobeyed to the
[1:09:44] word of
[1:09:47] God who the matter of all the living
[1:09:50] people she disobeyed to the word of God
[1:09:56] that's why we had all those suffering
[1:09:58] and difficulties yes my brother and
[1:10:02] sister so when Eve was listening to the
[1:10:04] word of
[1:10:21] serp the deceiving of
[1:10:24] certain in this last
[1:10:28] days it will never look like a
[1:10:33] seducing because he has changed the
[1:10:35] techniqu the devil have changed the
[1:10:37] Techni to
[1:10:39] things many people are being deceived by
[1:10:42] Satan today without knowing
[1:10:52] it
[1:11:20] you see why you've got this part in that
[1:11:23] is for such a purpose it's for such a
[1:11:28] work so Satan opened the knowledge of
[1:11:32] Eve and it wasn't a work of one
[1:11:36] day Satan was speaking to Eve every
[1:11:39] evening and she was paying attention to
[1:11:43] that in the meantime Adam wasn't
[1:11:46] around that's why the prophet
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:51] says a true
[1:11:54] a true man will never leave his wife for
[1:11:56] long
[1:11:58] alone can we say Amen to
[1:12:05] that that's how Eve is
[1:12:10] Fallen she paid much more attention to
[1:12:12] what the enemy was telling her then she
[1:12:15] end up
[1:12:16] falling and God said unto
[1:12:20] her when all that sin came
[1:12:27] she even brought Adam to
[1:12:30] sin and God
[1:12:32] said Adam
[1:12:35] Adam he was running
[1:12:37] away he
[1:12:39] said here I am where are
[1:12:42] you I'm
[1:12:43] hiding why are you
[1:12:46] hiding because I'm netive who told you
[1:12:49] that you're
[1:12:52] NE they were all neged all
[1:12:56] along but the prophet said that they had
[1:12:59] a holy
[1:13:22] Veil
[1:17:21] if a man is a master in his home
[1:17:23] [Music]
[1:17:26] and his people comes to pay him a
[1:17:33] visit people who came to visit a man who
[1:17:36] the
[1:17:42] master the man the master of the home
[1:17:45] should speak the same
[1:17:48] language why should he speak the same
[1:17:50] language
[1:17:51] with because when is going to say to
[1:17:56] his prepare food for my
[1:18:00] friends they have to understand that he
[1:18:02] gave the order to his
[1:18:07] woman visitor should understand that the
[1:18:10] master of the
[1:18:13] home as they speaking the same
[1:18:19] language now people will be observing to
[1:18:22] see if the order will
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:26] be that's why he shouldn't be
[1:18:31] only he should be a master and speak the
[1:18:34] language of his so that when he gives
[1:18:37] his
[1:18:39] ERS we'll be waiting to
[1:18:42] see are the orders going to be executed
[1:18:45] or
[1:18:47] not it's read the
[1:18:51] Bible now when you say something to your
[1:18:56] wife or we get to your home
[1:19:08] and because you're afraid that people
[1:19:10] shouldn't see how your wife is
[1:19:14] disobedient that's what it means you are
[1:19:17] the
[1:19:18] master you speak the language of your
[1:19:20] people when we come to you
[1:19:23] you give your orders to then we observe
[1:19:29] it we wait to see if
[1:19:32] the because you've said it in our
[1:19:36] language don't use any other
[1:19:39] language speak the language of your
[1:19:42] people speak in our
[1:19:46] language it's written in the Bible we
[1:19:49] read it together with you to be a master
[1:19:59] so are they exed when they visit that's
[1:20:02] the
[1:20:05] problem don't just be a master when
[1:20:07] we're not
[1:20:08] there I'm a master I'm controlling my
[1:20:13] home when we come to your home you are
[1:20:15] the master
[1:20:18] yes it's only when we there that we can
[1:20:21] see master
[1:20:24] especially if you give the orders in our
[1:20:27] language the language of our people okay
[1:20:32] yes we understand that
[1:20:35] part that everything was going
[1:20:40] on until the queen
[1:20:44] disobeyed and it caused its
[1:20:48] divorce the same way with the
[1:20:51] church the church was going
[1:20:55] well from the Pentecost the church was
[1:20:58] get on
[1:21:00] well when we get through the
[1:21:04] church the church start
[1:21:07] becoming the sin entered in the
[1:21:10] church Disobedience entered in the
[1:21:14] church and people become so
[1:21:17] Str all the sin came to the
[1:21:21] church and the church became
[1:21:24] disob and such a
[1:21:28] church Christ will never take such a
[1:21:30] church as a
[1:21:32] bride Christ going to reject you as a
[1:21:35] church because the Church of
[1:21:38] God is to be
[1:21:41] obedient obedient to every principle
[1:21:44] obedient to every word of to every
[1:21:47] commandment of
[1:21:51] God that is what behind my spirit my
[1:21:54] mind when I'm speaking about
[1:21:55] this now listen to
[1:21:58] this V have done
[1:22:01] everything that's where I got
[1:22:04] idea when she was
[1:22:07] answering God the go tell the king never
[1:22:11] come maybe her friends with with with
[1:22:15] whom she was told
[1:22:18] her why your husband is calling by this
[1:22:21] time we
[1:22:23] we weing here why why is calling
[1:22:28] you just tell that we
[1:22:33] buy that
[1:22:36] was she had also a own
[1:22:41] advice the wrong advice that she
[1:22:46] got caused the
[1:22:49] divorce I can imagine
[1:22:51] myself the
[1:22:53] queen I can see
[1:22:56] her and telling your
[1:22:59] friends you see what you've done to
[1:23:04] me that's why my brother and
[1:23:06] sister especially our
[1:23:10] sisters never pay attention to all
[1:23:16] women you don't know what can happen to
[1:23:21] you
[1:23:23] the only friend that you have you should
[1:23:25] have as advisor is God
[1:23:31] himself the word of God should be the
[1:23:34] first advisor before any other
[1:23:39] thing you can see the queen vas she lost
[1:23:43] the kingdom she was
[1:23:46] rejected that's why the church have done
[1:23:49] today yes my brother and
[1:23:51] sister I know how we're going to get
[1:23:54] to but I'm counting on
[1:23:57] God so that we may understand something
[1:24:02] here that's why the prophet
[1:24:07] said that woman shouldn't take authority
[1:24:11] above
[1:24:13] men but she should be submissive
[1:24:17] to that's why it said in the
[1:24:20] word that women be submissive
[1:24:25] and husband love your
[1:24:28] wife I was reading in the Book of
[1:24:32] Proverbs where Solomon was
[1:24:36] saying a wise woman build
[1:24:40] house
[1:24:44] but the unwise one she destroy her
[1:24:50] house it's not a man who's building a
[1:24:52] house
[1:24:54] is the woman is WR in
[1:24:56] the a wise woman build a
[1:25:01] house you have to understand about
[1:25:05] wisdom a woman should use a
[1:25:08] wisdom to stay in the
[1:25:11] marriage stay longer in the
[1:25:14] marriage you should be
[1:25:18] wise it's not to every
[1:25:21] question not to every
[1:25:24] problem that you got something to
[1:25:29] say a wise woman build a
[1:25:32] house but
[1:25:34] unwise destroy house she destroy with
[1:25:38] their own
[1:25:42] hands so my brother and
[1:25:45] sisters every that everything that
[1:25:51] I'm
[1:25:53] is for us to understand what the church
[1:25:57] is the behavior of the church before God
[1:26:03] today and and the place
[1:26:05] of as we said it last
[1:26:08] time especially in
[1:26:11] America it's hard to find the woman in
[1:26:14] the
[1:26:17] kitchen if you wanted to be in the
[1:26:21] kitchen
[1:26:23] then you can show us your riches for six
[1:26:27] years like the King has
[1:26:31] done the queen vas was over
[1:26:34] there and the King shows his riches for
[1:26:38] six years
[1:26:40] to if you want your woman to be just
[1:26:42] sitting somewhere as
[1:26:45] a then you have to show your riches for
[1:26:48] six months that no is that
[1:26:51] true
[1:26:54] sh his riches for six
[1:26:57] month and the queen was at
[1:27:01] rest that's
[1:27:03] why I'm not of that
[1:27:07] idea that the place of a woman is just
[1:27:09] in the
[1:27:11] kitchen if God help me to have a lot of
[1:27:14] money yes my my wife that's why she
[1:27:19] have but as long as I don't have enough
[1:27:24] I don't see it important to be just in
[1:27:26] the
[1:27:28] kitchen but somebody can
[1:27:31] say Prophet said the of a woman
[1:27:34] is yes he
[1:27:36] said but here
[1:27:41] also the place of a woman is to be a
[1:27:44] queen at
[1:27:48] home how can she be a man's Queen if if
[1:27:52] you know how to to support her for
[1:27:59] the so if you can take charge of
[1:28:03] everything for a woman then she can stay
[1:28:04] in the
[1:28:06] Christian then vas was
[1:28:10] rejected while she was even at rest in
[1:28:13] the kchen she's been
[1:28:15] disobedient yes my brother and
[1:28:19] sister that's how it has been to
[1:28:23] the that the king needed another
[1:28:27] queen that's what I'm going to speak
[1:28:30] about upon
[1:28:34] about I want to say
[1:28:36] this the prophet was
[1:28:41] saying they have shown that the queen
[1:28:44] vas was
[1:28:47] disobedient and he said the type of a
[1:28:49] queen
[1:28:51] V
[1:28:55] is the type of believers who have been
[1:28:57] in the message for
[1:28:59] longer I'm going to read
[1:29:02] it so that we can be
[1:29:05] together I'm in
[1:29:17] the the the marriage of the land did
[1:29:24] let me say this
[1:29:27] now I don't say to make a
[1:29:31] joke but I'm I'm saying
[1:29:35] it for you to
[1:29:40] understand it's exactly what you
[1:29:43] Christian
[1:29:47] of that's what you're doing to those
[1:29:49] young
[1:29:50] believers is
[1:29:54] true you're supposed to
[1:29:58] be you Christian that is being Christian
[1:30:02] for you should be a role
[1:30:07] model you part people who pretend to
[1:30:10] have a holy
[1:30:12] ghost you should be an
[1:30:15] example Baptist and
[1:30:19] Presbyterian not to be like the first
[1:30:23] lady like Queen
[1:30:26] vas but you supposed to be like
[1:30:30] Jesus he's telling you here what to do
[1:30:34] how to do
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:36] it we got to we got to follow his
[1:30:39] commandment and his
[1:30:42] examp that's how we found
[1:30:46] it so this queen never wanted to to
[1:30:50] obey
[1:30:52] V
[1:30:54] refused and humiliated the
[1:30:59] king if the first lady of the land gives
[1:31:02] such
[1:31:05] example all the women will do the same
[1:31:09] thing and when the man shall invite his
[1:31:12] woman and the woman could
[1:31:15] say don't play around with
[1:31:19] me what the queen V have done in that
[1:31:25] it was like a prediction upon
[1:31:28] America we've seen that by acting in
[1:31:31] that
[1:31:33] way there was a wise man who advised the
[1:31:38] king that he has to do what he
[1:31:43] did is to get out and send a message
[1:31:46] through all around the
[1:31:49] nation and call all the virgin
[1:31:56] to go all the young virgin and choose a
[1:31:58] queen among
[1:32:00] them and it it pleased the
[1:32:03] king the prophet is showing
[1:32:07] here just because vas was a type of a
[1:32:11] church today the
[1:32:16] vas creation that has been in the
[1:32:19] message for a long
[1:32:20] time
[1:32:22] we supposed to give a good
[1:32:25] example we supposed to live in such a
[1:32:29] way that the new
[1:32:32] creation those just get
[1:32:36] converted they may see our way of
[1:32:39] living and they may follow the way of
[1:32:43] God but the worst
[1:32:46] part we behaving the same way
[1:32:50] like the Lord is
[1:32:53] the Lord have sent us his
[1:32:56] word but the
[1:33:01] long we refusing to act according to the
[1:33:04] Commandment of the
[1:33:06] Lord and we giving a bad
[1:33:08] impression bad example to those young
[1:33:11] CHR those just believe the word of
[1:33:16] God that's what is
[1:33:19] bad those Christians for long time
[1:33:22] [Music]
[1:33:25] we we know in the
[1:33:28] Bible because it's about the example
[1:33:30] that we have to
[1:33:34] give Joseph was living
[1:33:41] ater so potifa went out and left Joseph
[1:33:44] at
[1:33:45] home with his
[1:33:49] wife and the wife of P first started
[1:33:52] flirting with
[1:33:55] Joseph because Joseph was
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:01] handsome and Joseph never give up to the
[1:34:04] Temptation from the
[1:34:06] woman Joseph
[1:34:09] understood the only way I can do is to
[1:34:14] escape to run
[1:34:15] away then Joseph
[1:34:18] escaped he
[1:34:20] went us
[1:34:22] today Christian for long the long
[1:34:27] long what example we
[1:34:31] giving it's not even it's not even the
[1:34:34] woman who came
[1:34:36] to we going to attempt the
[1:34:40] woman that's the bad example we're
[1:34:45] giving how would you want such a
[1:34:50] church how would you want this group of
[1:34:53] people
[1:34:54] like that God can speak
[1:34:56] about how would you want God
[1:35:00] to oh God bless
[1:35:03] them because we giving a bad
[1:35:10] examples but God want a church or need a
[1:35:13] church that is is
[1:35:18] obedient God want a church that is
[1:35:20] obedient
[1:35:22] when the Bible
[1:35:24] says when the Lord promis something it
[1:35:28] has to
[1:35:30] happen so why don't we see those
[1:35:33] promises being
[1:35:36] fulfilled why don't we see the
[1:35:38] Fulfillment of the prom in the
[1:35:41] church is because we we've given a b
[1:35:45] examp as the chrisan
[1:35:48] of we disobey to the command
[1:35:54] we disobey to the orders of
[1:35:56] God to the orders of the Lord Christ
[1:35:59] that's why the
[1:36:01] church it it seems to be
[1:36:04] St it's so
[1:36:08] c not even one tongue is spoken in the
[1:36:11] church not even sick people healed in
[1:36:14] the
[1:36:15] church no blessing in the
[1:36:18] church even the joy of Sal
[1:36:22] not the
[1:36:24] church it's because the church has given
[1:36:27] bad
[1:36:30] examples I said it last
[1:36:34] time the prophet was
[1:36:38] saying that a man you will never see a
[1:36:41] man acting badly without a woman acting
[1:36:44] bad first that was just a portion of a
[1:36:47] scripture the same Prophet
[1:36:50] saying
[1:36:55] the same way a man cannot act badly
[1:36:58] without
[1:37:02] woman a woman can never act badly before
[1:37:06] the
[1:37:09] man so all the problem we have in the
[1:37:13] marriage either is the
[1:37:16] man
[1:37:19] or either is the woman
[1:37:23] then the man is not
[1:37:26] happy that's why we have
[1:37:28] troubles but in all of
[1:37:32] that God want the church to be
[1:37:35] obedient before the word of
[1:37:39] God and he want a woman to be obedient
[1:37:42] to his to a hus that's why he said woman
[1:37:47] beiss because he knew that in the woman
[1:37:51] there's always a fight to be
[1:37:54] sub she always want to have a first
[1:37:58] position that's why God seeing that he
[1:38:01] said the woman be
[1:38:03] submissive he knew
[1:38:07] it that a woman is in the
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:11] fight that's why American women never
[1:38:16] understood when they voted the 19
[1:38:20] Amendment
[1:38:22] that made a woman to have a right of
[1:38:26] vote that's what created everything that
[1:38:28] we have
[1:38:29] today and the country the land is
[1:38:34] Fallen without any
[1:38:39] hope spiritual
[1:38:41] manual
[1:38:44] woman they may they may see America with
[1:38:49] eyes then understand that America is
[1:38:53] Fallen but the one
[1:38:56] who's you know America is a country
[1:38:59] we've got right equal right between men
[1:39:03] and man is not Superior to to a
[1:39:07] woman a woman is equal to man and she
[1:39:10] can do
[1:39:12] everything I said the same
[1:39:15] way clap his his wife and the woman
[1:39:20] canap that is not in the Church of
[1:39:23] God that's why we we learn
[1:39:28] fromo but here in the church we
[1:39:33] PR Supremacy and the authority of a
[1:39:38] man that's what we're talking
[1:39:43] about the same way a man has got
[1:39:45] Authority above his
[1:39:48] wife the same way a man has Domin his
[1:39:51] wife the same
[1:39:53] way Christ is is having a Dom the
[1:39:57] church we don't have any church that
[1:40:00] that is above Christ a church that have
[1:40:03] a Domin of
[1:40:04] Christ is the church like Catholic
[1:40:07] Church oh yes they're leading
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:11] themselves they've killed the Holy
[1:40:14] Ghost and they cannot
[1:40:18] speak because they wanted to lead
[1:40:20] themselves
[1:40:21] but us right we
[1:40:24] need we need a
[1:40:26] church that is leaded by the Holy
[1:40:29] Ghost the church in
[1:40:32] which the Lord can
[1:40:34] reveal when
[1:40:37] somebody the Lord reveal it in the
[1:40:39] church that's the
[1:40:43] church if I've got a vision of church is
[1:40:46] that kind of a church that I
[1:40:49] have but a church
[1:40:51] which is where we only
[1:40:55] GA we sing and then go back
[1:40:58] home and people are singing like foolish
[1:41:01] people
[1:41:03] no that's not a
[1:41:06] church then we're going to
[1:41:09] need to stay each and everyone at
[1:41:12] home but as long as there's a church the
[1:41:15] Bible says the Lord
[1:41:18] God is aesome in the Church of
[1:41:23] holies if God is so wonderful in the
[1:41:26] church he's going to reveal what is
[1:41:29] not what is not right in the
[1:41:32] church when somebody have SE somewhere
[1:41:34] God reveal
[1:41:39] it I remember one time that was before I
[1:41:42] come to I I come to
[1:41:49] us while I could see how long it has
[1:41:53] been taken before
[1:41:56] come I was feeling something in my a
[1:41:59] voice in my heart I call my wife and
[1:42:02] tell
[1:42:04] her I felt something telling me in my
[1:42:13] heart then I told her you always ask us
[1:42:17] ask God to
[1:42:19] help
[1:42:23] so what have you done you got to do
[1:42:24] something that you feel like it's over
[1:42:27] your
[1:42:29] capacity wit of what I'm
[1:42:32] saying when when we left to Dubai I told
[1:42:35] her
[1:42:40] that I want to go preach in the village
[1:42:43] that's what God is telling
[1:42:45] me then I
[1:42:48] went I went and preached in
[1:42:51] back in maybe two or three
[1:42:55] churches the time I was preaching over
[1:42:59] there because it says that the Lord is
[1:43:01] so wonderful in the Assembly
[1:43:05] of there was a couple that about get
[1:43:09] married they introduced them to the
[1:43:14] church I was living at past this
[1:43:17] place the time I was sleeping
[1:43:22] God showed me
[1:43:24] something I saw that young
[1:43:27] couple and they were busy having
[1:43:30] love I just saw a piece of
[1:43:33] it in the morning I thought Pastor I
[1:43:37] said look what I've
[1:43:39] seen the new couple that you're going
[1:43:44] to they knew each other as man so ask
[1:43:49] them
[1:43:51] then Pastor went to ask them just after
[1:43:54] I've preached and the man
[1:43:57] said pastor is
[1:44:03] true I need a church where God can
[1:44:07] reveal
[1:44:10] sin I don't want to change where when we
[1:44:15] come people are so disobedient to the
[1:44:18] word of
[1:44:18] God but we just come and
[1:44:21] what are we
[1:44:25] doing you better stay
[1:44:32] home so as I was
[1:44:36] in I had only two days to
[1:44:41] leave then they send me a message that
[1:44:44] go to the
[1:44:47] Embassy are you going to say that the
[1:44:49] devil that spoke to me it was God who
[1:44:51] spoke to
[1:44:58] me we need people who can capture the
[1:45:01] word of God the voice of
[1:45:05] God and to be totally obedient to
[1:45:10] God at such a point when God tells them
[1:45:13] something they just captur the thought
[1:45:15] of God and put it in
[1:45:19] practice yes my brother and
[1:45:26] sister I want to move for just to up
[1:45:30] something I said
[1:45:35] it
[1:45:36] we reading the example of Joseph in the
[1:45:41] Bible so where are the true Joseph
[1:45:47] today Joseph uh Joseph all old
[1:45:52] test him it was a woman who wanted
[1:45:56] him but people
[1:45:59] of they are the ones who are going to
[1:46:01] seek those
[1:46:05] womans that's so
[1:46:13] PR you know my brother and
[1:46:17] sister it's easy to commit
[1:46:21] Trey yes you can do
[1:46:25] it to fix it that's a big
[1:46:30] problem yeah go do whatever you want to
[1:46:33] is
[1:46:34] good but how to fix
[1:46:37] it if you didn't fix it
[1:46:40] well you're going to go to
[1:46:44] hell doing it it's good but how to fix
[1:46:49] it
[1:46:52] I'm going to read how the prophet says
[1:46:54] how how he showing how fix
[1:46:59] adultery question answer
[1:47:03] number he said this woman has committed
[1:47:06] adultery with
[1:47:08] this then she confessed it to her
[1:47:14] husband then she went with her husband
[1:47:16] with the husband to see the men that
[1:47:18] they
[1:47:19] commit
[1:47:22] she confessed and fixed the
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:26] situation but now a
[1:47:29] man who committed adultery with the same
[1:47:33] woman because him also was
[1:47:38] married he has to go back to his
[1:47:40] [Music]
[1:47:42] wife bring his wife and see the
[1:47:47] woman then everything is is right
[1:47:53] I was telling my
[1:47:57] wife God have given me a beautiful
[1:48:02] woman that I've got thousand
[1:48:07] reasons not to look
[1:48:11] outside then I always tell my
[1:48:19] wife you hear that
[1:48:24] or or you oh so expecting that I'm going
[1:48:29] to commit
[1:48:33] adultery it's easy to do
[1:48:36] that but just because it's difficult to
[1:48:39] fix it I can never go do
[1:48:43] it because
[1:48:45] said when you are a married
[1:48:49] woman
[1:48:51] you go and commit adultery with a mar
[1:48:55] woman that sin to fix it is not
[1:48:59] easy you got to take your wife you said
[1:49:02] my
[1:49:03] wife committed adultery with that
[1:49:07] woman andam say you going to take your
[1:49:11] wife it doesn't stop from
[1:49:14] there you take your
[1:49:17] wife you take her to that woman with
[1:49:20] which you
[1:49:21] commit then you said unto your
[1:49:24] wife this is the woman with whom I've
[1:49:27] committed
[1:49:29] adul and you think it's
[1:49:33] easy you can the fight
[1:49:38] can so when he says take your wife go
[1:49:41] see the woman you don't know the
[1:49:42] consequences that can come
[1:49:44] up but
[1:49:46] now the other woman over there
[1:49:51] because a man have fixed his situation
[1:49:53] with his wife he took his wife they went
[1:49:56] to see the woman then it's
[1:50:01] done if that woman has to fix
[1:50:04] the she has to tell it to a
[1:50:07] husband it's not going to stop from
[1:50:10] there you take your
[1:50:13] husband you go see the man with whom you
[1:50:16] commit
[1:50:17] adultery and you think it's easy
[1:50:24] that's why I cannot do
[1:50:26] that and just by grace of
[1:50:29] God I'm counting now five years of
[1:50:32] marriage I don't know any other
[1:50:35] woman beside my woman I don't know any
[1:50:38] other woman in the name of the
[1:50:40] Lord and you think I'm not a man I'm a
[1:50:43] man like
[1:50:45] you and when I was in
[1:50:47] K I was telling one brother I was
[1:50:50] telling
[1:50:52] you God going to take me as a role model
[1:50:55] at the
[1:50:57] Judgment all those men that Fallen with
[1:51:00] women in the absence of their
[1:51:03] wives God going to take me as a mother
[1:51:06] he's going to tell them when they will
[1:51:08] say
[1:51:11] Lord I Fallen because I was a away from
[1:51:14] my wife I couldn't do any other
[1:51:16] thing said but God going to call me come
[1:51:20] here he's going to tell
[1:51:24] you wasn't away from his wife for long
[1:51:33] time the church has become
[1:51:38] Disobedience when you hear that somebody
[1:51:47] is you can you got a Grace to to see
[1:51:50] somebody who he come to church but I
[1:51:53] want to tell
[1:51:55] you there so many backers in the church
[1:51:59] this
[1:52:00] morning just because they are
[1:52:03] ashamed of staying home but they come to
[1:52:10] church and when you hear that somebody
[1:52:12] is
[1:52:13] backl it's
[1:52:15] always is with woman is now drinking
[1:52:20] that's
[1:52:22] all God has created you a
[1:52:26] man just to be in
[1:52:29] dark or just drinking
[1:52:34] no who is the man a man is the one who's
[1:52:38] telling
[1:52:39] himself why God created
[1:52:42] me the purpose of me being
[1:52:46] upon what's the mission God has given me
[1:52:51] so that I can fulfill
[1:52:54] it every man every
[1:52:58] woman is born under
[1:53:02] a God
[1:53:05] is he made us born under a mission and
[1:53:09] we've got a mission each and every one
[1:53:10] of
[1:53:12] us when you
[1:53:14] leave and you got no
[1:53:17] vision no mission
[1:53:23] you don't even recognize that God has
[1:53:25] placed you upon the Earth in a mission
[1:53:27] that's so
[1:53:29] PR our first
[1:53:33] mission us as a church of living God is
[1:53:36] to give a good
[1:53:38] example to give a good
[1:53:43] example and once we give this good
[1:53:48] example then the chur church will be in
[1:53:51] fire I said it last time
[1:53:57] that as the king
[1:54:01] assures divorced a queen his Queen I
[1:54:07] mean I'm not preaching upon about uh
[1:54:10] marriage and
[1:54:13] divorce I don't have responsibility to
[1:54:15] do
[1:54:16] that because I'm not a pastor of this
[1:54:19] church
[1:54:22] but now listen to what
[1:54:26] say but for what is to fix this question
[1:54:32] of for you to know who was right and who
[1:54:35] was
[1:54:38] wrong and is's showing it clearly in
[1:54:41] this
[1:54:44] Ty he said there's one Christ with so
[1:54:46] many members that form the he said noce
[1:54:53] [Music]
[1:54:57] himr he can put us away because of
[1:55:00] fornication and
[1:55:02] adulteries whenever he
[1:55:08] want but how can you try to put him
[1:55:13] out thinking that you can get to that
[1:55:17] point we don't have that right to reject
[1:55:20] but Christ can put us he
[1:55:24] [Music]
[1:55:25] said a man can put away his
[1:55:29] wife and get married to another but a
[1:55:34] woman has is got no right put away his
[1:55:39] wife his his her husband and get married
[1:55:41] to another
[1:55:42] husband a woman can never
[1:55:45] do because it's breaking even the type
[1:55:48] of the scripture
[1:55:50] but
[1:55:51] remember but I'm preaching
[1:55:55] this just to show how much the
[1:55:59] church and the church that
[1:56:01] is Christ can put it
[1:56:05] out the same way a man can reject his
[1:56:09] wife and get married to another one I'm
[1:56:12] just
[1:56:17] [Music]
[1:56:18] reading do you see all the shadows and
[1:56:21] the types in a in in a in a balance
[1:56:25] Perfect
[1:56:27] Balance not the church but the bride by
[1:56:30] the
[1:56:33] word not a woman but a man every
[1:56:44] time that's why it has been said a man
[1:56:47] shall not do it but it's only a woman
[1:56:49] who should should not do
[1:56:50] it yes my brother and
[1:56:53] sister the church has to be obedient to
[1:56:56] the word of God because if she's not
[1:56:59] obedient Christ is going to put her
[1:57:03] out and don't understand the church that
[1:57:06] is a member of people but the church is
[1:57:11] you today God is saving people
[1:57:15] individually and the prophet
[1:57:18] said Israel God is saving them as a
[1:57:21] nation but gentile
[1:57:23] people God is saving each one of us
[1:57:27] individually if you're not obedient to
[1:57:29] the word of God then God going to put
[1:57:31] you out Christ going to put you out your
[1:57:35] king going to put you
[1:57:39] out God want to have men and women
[1:57:41] obedient to
[1:57:44] him God want to have men and
[1:57:47] women that are subjective to his
[1:57:50] word God and to his
[1:57:51] authority yes my brother and sister the
[1:57:55] prophet told
[1:57:56] us that we are at the seventh age of the
[1:58:00] church we are at the seventh day of the
[1:58:05] church where God supposed to be at
[1:58:08] rest and we are the ones supposed to
[1:58:11] work so what are we
[1:58:15] doing we are at a seven seventh Church
[1:58:18] age of the chur
[1:58:20] what are we
[1:58:23] doing and the Lord helped me to
[1:58:25] understand
[1:58:27] this today upon the
[1:58:30] Earth we got four categories of
[1:58:35] people according to the promises of God
[1:58:38] and to his
[1:58:40] word upon the Earth
[1:58:42] today there are people men and
[1:58:46] wom who doesn't know what God has
[1:58:48] promised
[1:58:51] they are ignorant to
[1:58:53] everything and they are living their own
[1:58:56] Liv they are leaving it
[1:58:59] happily and they can see the way how
[1:59:02] it's moving forward and they're moving
[1:59:03] with it
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:08] but the second category of
[1:59:14] people people who knows what God has
[1:59:16] promised for
[1:59:18] this
[1:59:20] they know that God has made promises for
[1:59:22] this hour
[1:59:24] but they can't do
[1:59:27] anything I know they know that there are
[1:59:29] promises God has made those promises for
[1:59:32] this last and they can't do anything
[1:59:34] about
[1:59:36] it just because they got no power to
[1:59:39] make alive those
[1:59:41] promises and they just let things go
[1:59:44] that
[1:59:45] way the third
[1:59:47] category of people
[1:59:51] that knows that God has made promises
[1:59:53] for this
[1:59:58] day but they are
[2:00:01] regretting they are
[2:00:04] crying they are crying they saying oh
[2:00:09] Lord when those promises are they going
[2:00:13] to when the promise is going to be
[2:00:15] fulfilled in our Liv and they
[2:00:18] bus
[2:00:19] they are
[2:00:21] crying and the promises of God are right
[2:00:24] there and they just see the
[2:00:27] promises the fourth category of and the
[2:00:31] last
[2:00:33] one people knows that God has made
[2:00:36] promises and they're looking at those
[2:00:39] promises and they're saying those
[2:00:41] promises belongs to us there has to be
[2:00:46] fulfilled and they can make those
[2:00:48] promises put in
[2:00:50] action and God honor their
[2:00:53] words so in which category of people are
[2:00:59] you before the promises of God of this
[2:01:04] day God need men and women obedient to
[2:01:08] him those who can be obedient to
[2:01:11] God so that we can see the will of
[2:01:15] God being fulfilled in our
[2:01:18] lives
[2:01:20] God want to rest himself in a
[2:01:22] man he want to rest in the
[2:01:26] church so in what church God going to
[2:01:31] rest if the church was just what we see
[2:01:34] with you today that's so P my friend and
[2:01:38] sister what I'm preaching this
[2:01:41] morning is to awaken each and every one
[2:01:43] of
[2:01:44] us it's for myself to be
[2:01:47] aw it's for you to be be
[2:01:49] aware so that you can be conscious you
[2:01:52] can
[2:01:53] say no this is not a
[2:01:56] church the church should not should not
[2:01:58] be this
[2:01:59] way so that all of us we can go to this
[2:02:03] true
[2:02:04] church the church in
[2:02:07] fire the church obedience
[2:02:10] church the church that works always in
[2:02:13] Victory no matter what the Satan
[2:02:16] do the CH should have solution to every
[2:02:20] problem and a man and
[2:02:25] woman so God
[2:02:27] needs men and women that are
[2:02:30] obedient so how much we
[2:02:33] need those men and
[2:02:35] women obedient to
[2:02:39] God so that God can bring a total
[2:02:41] Deliverance to the
[2:02:45] church God want to deliver us
[2:02:47] totally
[2:02:49] he want to Deliver us from our he want
[2:02:52] to Deliver us from our actions from our
[2:02:58] words every promise that God has made is
[2:03:03] supposed to be fulfilled in this
[2:03:05] day God
[2:03:07] said You shall be the her and all the
[2:03:11] Tails shall be
[2:03:13] prosperous
[2:03:15] everywhere as your soul prosper
[2:03:21] how can we expect Prosperity while our
[2:03:25] souls are not
[2:03:29] prosperous our soul should be prosperous
[2:03:33] first then we can
[2:03:35] see the things of God being fulfilled in
[2:03:38] our lives it's hard my
[2:03:42] friend but I pray that uh the Lord
[2:03:46] should speak the way you want to my
[2:03:48] brother
[2:03:49] sister I will end up by
[2:03:54] this the prophet says that there was one
[2:03:58] lady a mechanic
[2:04:01] man who was in a workshop somewhere
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:09] for he was there in front of a motor
[2:04:13] that wasn't
[2:04:14] working he touched
[2:04:17] her he touched
[2:04:19] he tried to touch everything that engine
[2:04:22] and the engine couldn't
[2:04:24] startop so he tries by all means it
