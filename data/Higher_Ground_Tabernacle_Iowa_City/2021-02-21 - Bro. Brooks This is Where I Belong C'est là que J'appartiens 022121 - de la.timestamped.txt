[1:02:01] in your name lord jesus
[1:02:27] amen amen you may be seated
[1:02:34] i have just a little thought this
[1:02:38] morning
[1:02:41] and i will entitle this message this is
[1:02:44] where i belong
[1:03:00] when we consider considering what god
[1:03:03] has
[1:03:05] done for us
[1:03:08] we should be overwhelmed with joy
[1:03:13] that in these last days
[1:03:28] as it is
[1:03:32] falling apart
[1:03:35] politically socially
[1:03:41] everything seems to be breaking to
[1:03:44] choose something
[1:03:45] we know that we're living in the time
[1:03:48] that brother branham calls the united
[1:03:50] times
[1:03:54] everything is united to choose
[1:03:59] for a long time being a christian
[1:04:05] something that we did not know how to
[1:04:07] define
[1:04:10] as
[1:04:38] [Music]
[1:04:52] hallelujah
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:47] and you become this message you have
[1:05:50] already made it home hallelujah
[1:05:55] i'm gonna say it again when you see
[1:05:58] this message what's in me when you
[1:06:00] understand this message
[1:06:02] and when you receive
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:30] pentecostal
[1:06:42] he could make this message
[1:06:48] [Music]
[1:06:58] only one life he sees life is christ
[1:07:04] hallelujah amen it was a
[1:07:08] very profound statement
[1:07:12] made by jesus himself
[1:07:15] in saint john 10 30.
[1:07:19] when he said i and the father are once
[1:07:24] i want you to think about that
[1:07:34] [Music]
[1:07:41] hallelujah hallelujah what was he doing
[1:07:44] just confusing
[1:07:45] they said to him you being a man
[1:07:50] make yourself god to fail them dude this
[1:07:53] is why we want to kill you
[1:07:57] but brother branham said it like jesus
[1:08:00] he was not a man making himself god
[1:08:04] he was god making himself a man
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:36] you
[1:08:48] that when god revealed to moses
[1:09:04] that tabernacle has it fallen mankind
[1:09:08] uh to fall into fallen mankind
[1:09:13] hallelujah we had no idea
[1:09:16] but here was god was
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:27] on how mankind was going to return
[1:09:31] back to him
[1:09:45] and that's what god became to israel
[1:09:49] god became to israel a power in a box
[1:09:54] in in hallelujah but god is greater
[1:09:58] than a box okay
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:12] if i make my bed in hell
[1:11:09] at the same time hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:12] why because he's a mission
[1:11:14] because he knows all the things he
[1:11:17] connected to jesus
[1:11:20] he knows the beginning from the end
[1:11:24] from the beginning
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:11:50] when you see me come to me come to
[1:12:06] hallelujah
[1:12:20] followed the character he was talking
[1:12:23] about the lies
[1:12:25] hallelujah somebody helped me here see
[1:12:28] because you and i must understand
[1:12:31] that god is a spirit
[1:12:34] and no men have seen god
[1:12:37] at any time hallelujah but jesus said
[1:12:42] when you see me you see the father
[1:12:46] hallelujah what was christ working with
[1:12:49] just get kissed
[1:12:50] he was working with the kind of glory
[1:12:53] that was in the vessel of jesus christ
[1:12:57] the bible says that the fullness of god
[1:13:01] like plenty too did you the
[1:13:30] something is going on he's confused on
[1:13:33] the devil
[1:13:36] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:13:41] the process of a seed
[1:14:54] he
[1:15:51] [Music]

[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:18] hallelujah
[1:16:29] not where the candlesticks were standing
[1:16:59] thank you

[1:20:02] the bible says
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:16] when you

[1:27:43] just just for a little thought
[1:27:48] before he was anointed
[1:27:54] in the mind of god david was already
[1:27:57] king
[1:27:58] david
[1:28:27] samuel was just an instrument samuel who
[1:28:29] was knowing
[1:28:30] him hallelujah hallelujah king
[1:28:34] wow at the moment he was anointed
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:40] hallelujah
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:29:11] why because god chose you to be
[1:29:15] in france remember
[1:29:19] different ones wanted to be king
[1:29:23] different people wanted to be king
[1:29:25] person
[1:29:27] you know after david but god had already
[1:29:30] chosen solomon
[1:29:32] david uh do you have a justice league
[1:29:33] hallelujah hallelujah and it didn't make
[1:29:35] it doesn't make any difference
[1:29:38] a person proclaimed to be something
[1:29:42] put the approval on it he's
[1:29:45] nothing
[1:29:49] could be said there is
[1:30:02] because i think a lot of us are taking
[1:30:03] god for granted
[1:30:17] you need to get closer
[1:30:41] what shall we do with this jesus call
[1:30:43] christ
[1:30:44] and go ahead if you don't know the
[1:30:45] decision that subject
[1:30:53] you know he's not talking about jesus
[1:30:56] two thousand years ago he's talking
[1:31:00] about
[1:31:00] jesus
[1:31:14] and i want you to understand
[1:31:27] and trying to find a way to get rid of
[1:31:29] him
[1:31:30] hallelujah this is a new day
[1:31:34] another day and they crucified the lord
[1:31:37] of fresh again
[1:31:40] what shall we do with
[1:32:08] with love in my heart for all people

[1:32:53] it was showing how the pope
[1:32:57] he just uh uh uh uh dethroned
[1:33:03] a cardinal african cardinal
[1:33:07] and cardinal because the cardinals
[1:33:11] was too conservative

[2:01:42] says
[2:01:43] faithful is he the call to call it you
[2:01:47] who will also do it

[2:02:08] will do it
[2:02:13] if you don't remember anything else
[2:02:14] remember that 24th
[2:02:27] he calls you

[2:02:37] powerful things to pass in your life
[2:02:41] who also will do it
[2:02:55] [Music]
