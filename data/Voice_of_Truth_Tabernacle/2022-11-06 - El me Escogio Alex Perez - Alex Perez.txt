[Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] I lifted up my eyes again and looked and behold the man with the measuring Lion in his hand foreign to see what is the breadth thereof and what is the length thereof yeah and behold the angel that talked with me went forth and another Angel went out to meet him Salem de la multitude De Los Hombres is unto him run speak to this young man saying Jerusalem shall be inhabited as times Without Walls for the multitude of men and cattle what they're in parallel first I say the Lord will be unto her a wall of fire roundabout and will be the glory in the midst of her music or in your hands yo okay okay that there's nothing that good that can come from me there's nothing good that I can speak or say Ben I mean have pity on me Lord be able to transmit what's in my heart is don't allow it for me to speak uh something wrong okay but help so that what I speak can be a verification to your people and at the end of it all glory and honor be to you I asked this in the name of Jesus Christ we're focused man the last days he chose me that's the title we placed this morning and our pastors this morning when we think about a measuring line is something that we automatically think is it's something to Mark a certain place um it's a place it's something that you used to Mark a place to Mark the certain perimeters it's a line of division when we think of a measuring life thinking about a sort of ruler where you measures focusing on on measuring a certain territory the certain property in my house I have a neighbor that he has an RV is crb and his RV is very big is where you have all the Commodities of a home on Wheels it on the side that's really close to my house he the other day I told my wife I told him hey I think we need to go to the city is to ask them where in fact our our property line is because I feel like the neighbor is getting too close to my side or the property so a measuring line for Allah I would like to know where the limits lie to my property yes so when we think of a measuring line I began to think when they left um to to the to land The Babylon as captives foreign for many years they had lived there they went on to the to be captured to the middle Persians the time came for them where they had that hunger to to return foreign foreign limits because sometimes we think about limitations we're talking about separations we have no control over search but searching through Google's dictionary it tells us that the word limits means is a defined line that separates the perimeters between two entities yes it doesn't belong to me what is ours they could never conquer what God had given them what is in fact what belongs to me and when you don't know what your perimeters what belongs to me is there foreign [Applause] says that's the saddest side I've ever seen Hombres que foreign that would like to Spring forth amen I see a group of people that because they don't know what belongs to them though you're living as strangers as foreigners [Music] an American he can still feel like a foreigner doesn't know if they're a baby is the Earth from the world or from church that's the problem with not knowing don't understand where are limits lie out right amen ities let me tell you something God has no limits but I need limits God has no limits everything in the universe pertains to God but I all sometimes need limitations [Music] because it will be a line of judgment then leave me this limits right right when I need to know what belongs we have no business outside of the word these are my prayers that is my standards Oh Glory thank you thank you we live in a world where we all want to be the same well we want to be like the rest of the people Without Limits with our restrictions we don't want them to regulate us the bride has no rights [Music] is the one that was given by God yes and that is the word that is you're right no one can take that from you they don't know the power because they're living under their own privileges privileges that you could have but you don't know I see the urgency of God latitude of what belongs to the people of Israel question I believe that this prophecy in its fullness but I believe that's going to be fulfilled in its fullness we're the people of Israel was that all that was for them our thoughts and that that brings me to think importante how important is that you live parameters under the perimeter's goddess place for you God is a God killings fee that he and himself that he he cuts he has a measure where he cuts did you know that God this is before the foundation of the world when he was going to choose a bride Elementary that many youth that are going to be married soon and when someone's going to be married the first thing that they do first they're engaged but in the process [Music] of the Bride of arranging her dress the primary things of her dress she takes a fabric and she begins to design it she begins to separate now the fabric is the fabric is one Surplus it's God separated let's call it what this is whatever kind of fabric and she's got a pattern and she looks over this big house Where She lays his patterns that draws lies it's sanctified foreign without perimeters from here on now what will be yours are you following me this morning there are two things that I begin to see number one and what we just read in the scriptures of Zechariah I see two purposes behind those scriptures the first is to draw a line that separates of what belongs to us we are living in the end time and you shouldn't be like The World God wants to draw a line of differences because God is drawing a lot for you not to be like the rest for the foundation of the world I see a line that separates what he's chosen Bros we are the property of God is the pride of Jesus Christ then you were bought by the price as a son or daughter of God and we could just understand that this morning okay the second point that I want to express God promised a man this is many times or many years previous to what was occurring in the book of Zechariah where the people of Israel are returning back to their land and where God wants to once again work with them but many many years God had made a promise to a man named Abraham said his descendancy that land look Brothers the second point I see God that he's returning to his people but he's doing something very special he's claiming once again what he gave them and what to that people what belonged to them because if God gave you something brother sister it is yours God is returning it's claiming once again restating what is theirs brother Bernie preached a message called the period the the reclaiming period is he died two thousand years ago for us he died [Music] he says in the message the perfect faith I love what he says here when I was nothing says amen but I'm in his hands now I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ and then the chains of love I want to be in his chains his reps of lover are subject me and give me peace foreign that I'm not what I used to be right that's me Church perhaps I haven't gone to uh to obtain what I was maybe the world is doing it and I want to go to those times more to conquer foreign and they went to build their own homes and his word is one everything foreign but God has to go and tell them you guys are mine you are my property I gave you this land and you belong to me brother Branham says and the message is the breach between the church ages and the Seven Seals relation to Redemption of all creation is in his hand he has now come to claim it all all of the human race not to claim it back to the angels he's handed back to the human there's a great difference brothers look at what's happening in the people of Israel I have to go back so I can understand myself God is not for God but for his children he's claiming that for his children God is is the is the owner of the universe God is claiming once again the rights of his children and look at what brother Brown continues to say he's climbing it back which it was given for the trees everything else oh oh my brother Branham says that paid the price that I couldn't pay amen salvation but it doesn't stop there don't know the mascara I don't just want to go to heaven and say I was saved everything that God and I'm not talking about riches or financial groups I'm talking about the spiritual things that the bride can have games because he gave it to me sometimes on so many dumb things we put everything in one place and it will bring us nothing we're trying to claim things I'd rather the promises of God spiritual things that give me peace like the things of this world I told my wife I've asked the work to pay for it stressed out [Applause] a life [Applause] you're not always it with a sour face it's because I have to pay the bills it's the stress of the world that is Drawing the Line you're worrying about other things about your home that's why you live miserably God telling his people that's why you're not happy it's time to claim spiritual things where they don't pass [Music] sometimes and we feel just great I I spent so much right if we are Cancun I went to Cancun Brothers that's good go Al it's your right I want to claim things that belong to me spiritually speaking now he comes to claim his Redemptive rights the bride has right God chose us and we have certain rights brother random says claiming them for who is claiming them for who Hermanos he wasn't he wasn't saying this is where I'm going to draw the line the parameter the area Brothers I don't know why I said it but I said it's going to be for someone claiming them for what nobody has to see me smoke not for himself for us God draws a line he begins to measure with the line with the measurements because God says because this belongs to you I want to give it to you unbelievers in what God has given us is it true that sometimes we can't claim what God that God loves us and that he wants to give us things that's not for me it's maybe for the pastor but not for me Perfection he's going to get just help let him remember me when he gets there if you're a Son of God God chose you he cut out the pattern the design for you you are a part of that dress yes because I live in myself foreign says [Music] so sometimes you have to draw and make a separation must be separated thank you Lord amen he is one of ours is our Kinfolk okay oh my brother he's my brother with me we're on the same battle he is my savior he's my God is my kids men Redeemer he's all for without him what was I teen without him what would you be like we live a life Without Limits a life without limits then I wouldn't be here foreign why am I doing it it's necessary that he comes at an angel as an angel came and he said it's necessary that I look to Jerusalem the house of God the bread of God where God wants to to live God wants to live in US [Music] that is one reason why he puts perimeters because he's so anxious to have an encounter with us and for us to be able to obtain completely the entire happiness that you're looking for inside of you you know why Church foreign [Music] and remind us hey what happened to my own is everything [Music] in Israel right now there's again why is it their Agony in us there's a a week of God [Music] you are mine I chose you started I want to be in that she kind of Glory of God brother we're happy if you can please stand that's where I I find out my why yes I find my purpose my life has meaning of my life makes sense inside of him it doesn't make any sense I'm not happy without him I'm secure encuentro pass I find peace Joy [Music] no Legos [Music] [Music] [Music] go inside this morning [Music] as we need to have yourself [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] go back [Music] is [Music] jealous [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] another box [Music] ES [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Delicia is [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] because [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the only one for me [Music] this morning I was listening to our prophet and uh what part of the experience he had when he looked at a pastor [Music] or other animals [Music] but when the evening comes [Music] you put the sheep in [Music] the type of the Bride [Music] doesn't fight back humble he goes where the cancer takes him inside the home to its limits to the borders where the pastor knows where it can be taken care of done and this morning can we ask our father I don't know what the Holy Spirit wants but I know it's for someone here something wants to separate [Music] economics doesn't matter we're mechanics [Music] sacrifice [Music] [Music] I'm going out of order a little bit but it's fine it requires me to go out of order for one soul to be healed it's worth it [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I want to give some uh updates updates let's stay uh congratulations our brother Felix it's our brother Andrea she'll be here soon with us if God allows us they'll be presented to church [Music] but the property and the building is there have been some things happening Ocho Timberline property art church we have tried to build uh is no there's always been things in the way uh or in the last stages and there's been a problem and the problems with our neighbors you remember George yes George um and see than George has it's a requirement of the city for that to be signed up um [Music] the city may give us permission to start building on the property I stay um the engineers that we should help seek seek help from a lawyers at the end when you invert so much money uh more than seven thousand dollars have gone into this is 150 000. it's not just anything the work that the brothers to me it's not just anything for me it hurts to hear something like that so we're not closed by another one we know we need a church and God will provide it and the story told me I possibly that there's a possibility responsibility he says that what we're doing is already been used that water already passes through there they say entonces for so many years then you can ask the judge is is uh [Music] [Music] a um system [Music] and we're just you that idea eventually we'll have our church if you have any questions just let me know um [Music] um the second point is we found a place that could work there's many places that just don't work as a church it's very different to find a commercial place where we can use as a church is the requirements the requirements because we're not a type of church that just comes on Sundays and then go home there are people who make their Church our church is different the requirements so our requirements are different so we can't just go to any place and it's very expensive right now especially right now and those is um place that we found looked really nice [Music] but the city of Fort Collins to that place is our contract ends this year what are you telling us are you guys going to [Music] renewable because they want to put someone here talk to the owner about everything I believe we're all worried of the necessities [Music] foreign [Music] principal is there's a warehouse here that they're renting out [Music] I say maybe that's an option um every Sunday for fellowships and food that's the ideas that I have right now Anton says so I want to let you know how things are right now if you have any idea or questions nothing's completely finalized and some changes can be made so if you have a better idea let us know things are right now I've always said this is the church is not the building the church is the people and as long as the people are well we'll be fine God will give us our building at this time there's someone who wants a building I've been searching places I want to go visit many places it's not as easy as you may think um is foreign [Music] if you're a petition please raise your hands mother Celestia Celeste your father we are thankful once again for your great Mercy Lord firstly Lord I ask for the Risen hands here and in the internet you know their needs Lord we need a church and you hear the Cry of your people help your children we give you thanks father foreign Lord [Music] [Music] senor [Music] amen [Music] [Music] [Music] or seek your mind [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I love my mom [Music] [Music]
