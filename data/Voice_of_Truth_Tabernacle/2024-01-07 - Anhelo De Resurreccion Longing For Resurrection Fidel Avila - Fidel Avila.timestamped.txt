[32:54] now glor glory to God
[33:02] subject with the coming of the Lord on
[33:04] Sunday
[33:14] morning speak of a topic the Lord has
[33:16] put in my
[33:19] heart we will title it longing for
[33:25] Resurrection The Script
[33:31] says there were certain Greeks among
[33:33] those who had gone up to worship at the
[33:46] festival these therefore came to Philip
[33:48] who was from beida and Galilee and
[33:50] besought him saying Lord we would like
[33:52] to see
[33:54] Jesus how many want to see Jesus this
[33:56] morning
[33:58] morning if you came to see
[34:01] Jesus you will not leave
[34:04] disappointed I guarantee
[34:08] that Jesus answered them
[34:13] saying the hour has come for the son of
[34:16] man to be
[34:18] glorified truly truly I say to
[34:24] you unless a grain of whe falls into the
[34:26] ground
[34:27] dies it remains
[34:30] alone but if it dies it Bears much
[34:34] fruit he who loves his life will lose
[34:39] it and he who hates his life in this
[34:43] world will keep it for eternal
[34:46] life let's jump to
[34:51] 27 now my soul is
[34:54] troubled here's the Lord Jesus speaking
[34:58] and what will I
[35:02] say father save me from this
[35:07] hour but for this I have come to this
[35:14] hour I'd like for you to repeat with me
[35:16] but for
[35:17] this I've come to this
[35:20] hour pray Heavenly
[35:23] Father Lord we ask you in this
[35:25] morning
[35:27] you come and take control of the
[35:29] scene take control of the
[35:32] audience take control over
[35:36] me and you allow this useless
[35:41] man you come and use my lips lip of my
[35:47] interpreter this
[35:50] morning your word of
[35:52] life because it's what gives
[35:55] life it's what encourages us it's what
[35:59] keeps us to be standing in this morning
[36:03] in this place
[36:04] Lord your word never
[36:07] fails thank you
[36:11] Lord we ask these things in the name of
[36:13] Jesus
[36:14] Christ you may take your seat
[36:24] Brethren this morning
[36:27] don't be too quiet with
[36:31] me because if you're quiet I'll be
[36:34] quiet but if you help me
[36:41] preach we can say the preaching is
[36:43] easier for the preacher when you also
[36:46] get into the spirit this
[36:49] morning the lord gave me this simple
[36:52] thought longing for
[36:55] Resurrection I was
[36:58] thinking we're starting a new
[37:02] year we finished the old
[37:07] year and I've been meditating what
[37:10] people are
[37:14] longing many people during Christmas are
[37:17] longing for many
[37:19] things many people long for great
[37:24] gifts they were longing for good gifts
[37:32] but those gifts the person was
[37:36] expecting it wasn't the gift they
[37:46] expected many people this morning this
[37:50] day they're longing for
[37:53] something you sitting there this morning
[37:57] you're Desiring
[38:00] something now my question is what are we
[38:04] Desiring the subject is the coming of
[38:06] the
[38:08] Lord we're talking about the
[38:11] resurrection what do we
[38:14] desire why don't we get up this
[38:17] morning and begin to long
[38:21] for what does our heart long for this
[38:24] morning what did we want to come
[38:29] we desired to come to
[38:31] church I know many are
[38:35] brought but what do we come to church
[38:37] for what do we come
[38:39] looking what do we long for this
[38:43] morning my
[38:44] heart what does my heart desire this
[38:49] morning I want to find
[38:52] out and if there's a desire in my heart
[38:58] I want a deep that will answer this
[39:01] morning if inside you there's a
[39:07] desire that will answer to that desire
[39:10] that's crying
[39:13] out I didn't come to waste my time this
[39:16] morning I Wednesdays and
[39:20] Fridays with the youth helping
[39:23] them that's not the
[39:25] purpose
[39:28] there's something
[39:30] Beyond there's a higher
[39:33] life said this is not
[39:36] it is not it there's something
[39:40] higher there's a higher
[39:43] life that's what I long for that's what
[39:46] I long for what I long for in this
[39:50] morning it's the
[39:52] resurrection that's what we're waiting
[39:55] for not waiting
[39:57] for we're Desiring for
[40:02] Resurrection because when we can see
[40:07] them means the Lord is
[40:15] here here were these
[40:18] Pharisees remember the title is longing
[40:22] for
[40:23] resurrection and ask yourself this
[40:25] morning
[40:28] I've been asking myself all
[40:31] week what are you doing in
[40:36] church what is your
[40:44] desire I've spent so many years in
[40:49] church and what is your
[40:52] desire just keep coming serving
[40:59] singing hearing his
[41:02] word Fidel what is your
[41:05] desire what is your desire this
[41:08] morning what do you
[41:11] want I'm not happy the way my life
[41:15] is miserable if I will ever be
[41:20] happy because my God is
[41:25] Limitless
[41:28] the life I have now is not enough
[41:31] there's something
[41:33] more else somewhere
[41:36] else that makes me
[41:39] desire to come more to church so hear
[41:43] his word
[41:44] more and Die
[41:55] daily
[41:58] did you know dying to yourself is not
[42:05] easy it's easier that someone kills
[42:09] you for you to kill
[42:15] yourself the Lord Jesus was right
[42:18] there the hour came and he said
[42:25] Lord
[42:27] if it's possible make this trial
[42:29] pass but because he
[42:33] knew that to die to yourself is not
[42:40] easy like I said it's easier to kill
[42:42] your
[42:47] brother now you don't kill your brother
[42:50] uh backstabbing or shooting
[42:52] them a prophet of God came and told us
[42:56] if you want to kill your brother kill
[42:59] his
[43:00] influence and what are we doing we
[43:12] criticize we judge
[43:14] them we're killing
[43:17] our killing their
[43:20] influence that's the way
[43:23] we it's not no more
[43:26] we kill the influence of our
[43:29] brother kill your brother's
[43:32] influence you are killing
[43:34] yourself sooner or
[43:37] later won need that
[43:41] brother kill his
[43:44] influence it won't have the same effect
[43:49] anymore how they can say
[43:53] Amen have you not realized
[44:02] sometimes I haven't done anything to the
[44:04] brother to the
[44:06] sister nor I know
[44:08] them no they know
[44:13] you's bitterness
[44:15] against because someone poisoned
[44:19] them you paid
[44:25] attention
[44:27] and someone infected
[44:33] us but here were these
[44:38] Greeks you know the Greeks were
[44:45] theologians they weren't just any type
[44:47] of person how
[44:48] we they were prepared
[44:52] men and here they come
[44:54] along they tell Phillip pH
[44:59] Phillip we'd like to see your
[45:06] lord now to want to see the
[45:10] Lord there's nothing wrong with that
[45:15] right but it also counts the way you
[45:19] approach
[45:21] him there can be a desire in my
[45:24] heart but the way I will approach
[45:28] him that's what
[45:30] matters here they
[45:32] were pH philli we would like to see the
[45:35] Lord can we see
[45:39] him and the Lord Jesus answers
[45:43] this Jesus answered
[45:48] saying the hour has come for the son of
[45:51] man to be
[45:53] glorified and the Lord says
[45:56] truly truly I say to
[45:59] you unless the grain of whe falls into
[46:02] the ground and
[46:08] dies now if you're following me this
[46:10] morning I want you to follow
[46:17] me they're asking can we see
[46:22] Jesus and the Lord Jesus is answering
[46:28] look if you don't
[46:32] die there won't be fruit in
[46:35] you there's no life in
[46:38] you what does one thing have to do with
[46:40] the
[46:41] other these Greeks want to see
[46:44] you and you're telling me I have to
[46:53] die because the time comes brother
[46:57] that we come to church we come
[47:00] here our
[47:04] beautiful beautiful
[47:07] preaching go home we hear the
[47:10] prophet and we begin to feel
[47:12] ourselves we feel
[47:17] ourselves and the hour comes where we
[47:19] are left
[47:24] blind
[47:31] that's where they
[47:36] were how many times isn't the Church of
[47:39] the Lord the
[47:42] same
[47:47] blind there's no desire in
[47:52] her do you
[47:54] know I say it for
[48:01] myself dying isn't
[48:09] easy crucifying yourself is not
[48:16] easy here the Lord is
[48:19] saying if you do not
[48:22] die there's no life in you
[48:27] because the worst
[48:29] enemy is in
[48:34] you and we've heard it a million times I
[48:40] bet but very few times we've meditated
[48:43] over
[48:46] that that truly the enemy is in our
[48:50] home the enemy is in our
[48:52] home the enemy is not outside it's in
[48:55] our home
[48:58] both seeds are in
[49:02] here tells us that Jesus and
[49:07] Judas attended the same
[49:14] church what does the word longing
[49:19] mean a desire is something that is
[49:22] desired
[49:24] intensely let's be sincere this
[49:27] morning I said I was going to be simple
[49:30] I'm not going to speak too
[49:32] high what does the word longing
[49:35] mean to desire something
[49:39] intensely in this
[49:42] morning ask
[49:45] ourselves are we longing for the
[49:47] resurrection
[49:50] in do we long for the
[49:54] resurrection
[49:56] do we long to see our Lord Jesus Christ
[50:02] in see God's wonders
[50:05] and do we want to see Jesus if we want
[50:08] to see Jesus he can come to the
[50:12] SE all that's stopping him is
[50:16] you we are
[50:18] stopping you can't see Jesus on he wants
[50:22] to
[50:22] heal he wants to heal you from your
[50:27] he wants to hear you more from your
[50:28] soul because in the
[50:30] soul the soul is the
[50:33] problem the problem is in the
[50:43] soul you cannot live without
[50:46] desires that's what the word along
[50:50] means you cannot live without
[50:54] desires
[50:57] you know the same scripture is telling
[51:00] us the Lord Jesus is saying
[51:07] here but for this hour I have
[51:10] come he knew his
[51:13] purpose he knew what he come
[51:16] for this morning do we know what we came
[51:20] for do you know what we come
[51:23] for he knew he
[51:27] knew that if he did not
[51:30] die you and I could not
[51:33] partake now to
[51:36] us it's our turn to do a
[51:39] job to
[51:44] do the problem is that we won't do it
[51:47] because we haven't died to ourselves and
[51:49] if we
[51:50] die we die only to a part how many can
[51:55] say Amen to
[51:57] that you know
[52:00] why this is getting
[52:04] good let's do it easy when we get close
[52:06] to the
[52:07] pastor and we ask for
[52:12] advice do we do
[52:15] it that's
[52:18] simple
[52:21] right do we follow his advice or okay
[52:27] or we walk out the office we take
[52:32] off and we want to have good
[52:35] results just because we spoke with the
[52:39] pastor the medicine was you need to take
[52:43] so there's a result if you don't take
[52:47] it it's difficult for a result to be
[52:51] in that's why we come to a church
[52:53] dragging ourselves
[52:56] sometimes we don't even want to come
[52:58] don't want to do
[53:02] anything less longing the
[53:05] resurrection if we barely come to church
[53:08] brother
[53:11] Isaac less I long for the
[53:16] resurrection less I'm longing for the
[53:18] holy spirit
[53:20] in ISAC let me tell you
[53:22] something this morning I got news
[53:25] if you I and them aren't born again
[53:31] don't have the Holy Spirit don't
[53:34] expect you will not attend the
[53:37] resurrection because the Holy
[53:40] Spirit what will prepare
[53:42] you because that's what he's coming for
[53:46] he comes for
[53:47] himself comes to take
[53:52] himself to long for in this morning
[53:55] it's the Holy
[53:57] Spirit that's why we're dead in
[54:02] life that's why the word of God has
[54:05] no that's why the word of God is
[54:09] spoken and that's why many of us are
[54:11] facing everywhere
[54:16] else the preacher can kill himself
[54:20] here our pastor can die up
[54:24] here but if we don't
[54:28] die if you and I do not die to
[54:34] ourselves that desire we
[54:38] have if we do have a
[54:41] desire if we have
[54:44] one it has to be a genuine
[54:51] one and I believe you have it
[54:56] otherwise you wouldn't be seated in
[54:59] church there's something that brought us
[55:02] there's a
[55:07] deep there's a deep that's pulling this
[55:14] deep in this morning if you feel that
[55:18] pole interrupt the Holy Spirit allow him
[55:21] allow
[55:23] him doesn't matter who is here
[55:26] here maybe brother Fel is the most
[55:29] sinful of
[55:30] everyone but if he could use an
[55:33] ass if God can use an
[55:36] ass why can't he use me and
[55:40] you the Holy Spirit work in
[55:43] you work in every one of
[55:50] us our Pastor
[55:54] said
[55:56] and the message death brings
[55:59] Resurrection he preached with brother
[56:02] Eric in
[56:07] 2021 we come to church as if we already
[56:09] had
[56:11] everything I don't know if you can
[56:13] identify this morning
[56:16] right we do not come
[56:22] desperate we do not come with those
[56:24] tears
[56:27] our we come as if we
[56:33] already they come just like those
[56:34] firstes who invited the Lord Jesus
[56:36] Christ to their
[56:40] house but they
[56:43] never washed his
[56:49] feet we invite the
[56:53] Lord
[56:56] we're so busy and what do we have to do
[56:58] when we
[56:59] leave we're so busy in
[57:03] everything we're thinking other
[57:06] things we're thinking about
[57:09] tomorrow who told you you'll live
[57:12] tomorrow who told you live another
[57:14] hour if someone told you they lied to
[57:18] you who told you you live
[57:21] longer that's a devil's lie
[57:30] amen they never washed his
[57:36] feet sometimes we invite the Lord
[57:39] here and we're so
[57:46] cold that we don't welcome him how he
[57:53] deserves since we come in from those
[57:56] courts we have to let go of
[58:01] ourselves to
[58:05] sayel I'm gonna crucify you just for
[58:08] this while stay
[58:12] here control him
[58:15] brother you have
[58:18] control the Holy
[58:21] Spirit control these
[58:23] feelings all the
[58:27] for for you to
[58:30] control the Beast
[58:34] [Music]
[58:35] inside but the problem
[58:40] is instead of crucifying ourselves out
[58:44] there we leave the Holy Spirit out
[58:48] there the prophet says is that
[58:52] right he says they leave the ho Holy
[58:54] Spirit on a branch out
[58:57] there and then we come in here just to
[59:02] fight and we're longing for the
[59:09] resurrection this is
[59:18] ABCs our pastor says they never kiss
[59:22] [Music]
[59:23] him they never saw his great
[59:27] need their own need now this
[59:31] morning I want you to ask yourself this
[59:35] here our pastor is
[59:39] saying they never saw their own great
[59:43] need have we seen our need this
[59:47] morning I believe how they said on
[59:51] Friday we're in a fast
[59:55] we need to be a little more
[59:57] spiritual sensitive to the
[1:00:13] spirit they never saw their own great
[1:00:15] need that's why they couldn't humble
[1:00:19] themselves they were more concerned
[1:00:21] about fulfilling a
[1:00:23] program
[1:00:27] than the need in their
[1:00:30] hearts how many times do we come to
[1:00:35] [Music]
[1:00:38] church and we don't truly search our
[1:00:46] heart we aren't searching for that
[1:00:51] medicine that can truly make that
[1:00:54] surgery in
[1:00:57] your we come with a mentality
[1:01:04] very we don't come with a mentality
[1:01:06] saying what will my beloved tell
[1:01:18] me those of you who are married I don't
[1:01:22] know I don't know if you remember when
[1:01:24] you were
[1:01:27] recording and our phone
[1:01:30] rang and it was Sister
[1:01:42] Raina there was a longing in my
[1:01:50] heart but the time
[1:01:53] comes
[1:01:57] it's the same the natural typifies the
[1:01:59] spiritual the time
[1:02:02] comes that we have them in our
[1:02:08] home and how it
[1:02:11] cost how it cost
[1:02:14] us to tell them hello how are
[1:02:21] you when at some time we desire to hear
[1:02:24] his or her
[1:02:27] voice didn't you desire to hear the
[1:02:29] voice of the one that's your husband
[1:02:33] now was there not something in your
[1:02:35] heart that was
[1:02:37] ping a desire for that young man young
[1:02:43] lady but the time comes where there's a
[1:02:49] coldness I
[1:02:51] remember when I began to hear the
[1:02:53] prophet
[1:03:01] I listen to message after message after
[1:03:03] message that's
[1:03:06] right but a coldness began to sit in my
[1:03:10] life devil always the devil
[1:03:15] always he's always watching
[1:03:19] us he watches you
[1:03:23] 247
[1:03:25] and the devil knows how to get to
[1:03:30] us and you already have your husband
[1:03:32] your wife in your
[1:03:33] home forgive me I don't know why the
[1:03:35] Lord is leading me
[1:03:37] this but a a coldness comes to your
[1:03:43] life you wake up and not even a good
[1:03:51] morning I'm not sure if I'm speaking to
[1:03:53] anyone
[1:04:03] because we're worried for the day's
[1:04:09] program and a stiffness came to my
[1:04:14] heart am I can't say Amen
[1:04:20] anymore the pastor is dying here
[1:04:23] preaching you
[1:04:27] and we're just watching somewhere
[1:04:34] else there's a coldness that gets in
[1:04:36] your
[1:04:41] heart brother brandham says
[1:04:44] this are you willing to
[1:04:47] die how many are willing this
[1:04:50] morning that's why I said it's not easy
[1:04:53] to die
[1:05:04] so we can obtain what our heart longs
[1:05:07] for the Lord has giving us the
[1:05:10] key if you want to see
[1:05:13] Jesus you need to die to
[1:05:16] yourself it's no longer you it's no
[1:05:20] longer me it's no
[1:05:23] longer
[1:05:25] that's ruling
[1:05:27] me because I haven't died to
[1:05:30] myself I
[1:05:32] still I still
[1:05:35] don't that's why there's a coldness
[1:05:37] in because I haven't died
[1:05:40] to because now in this
[1:05:44] moment going through this
[1:05:48] fast feel spiritually
[1:05:51] better because you have crucified your
[1:05:53] flesh
[1:05:54] and you've said
[1:05:56] flesh
[1:05:58] today
[1:06:11] Facebook today you won't listen
[1:06:19] to
[1:06:21] subject and you feel better
[1:06:25] you are surrendering
[1:06:28] your the holy spirit is working in
[1:06:50] you one
[1:06:52] time Clos
[1:07:04] one time brother Bram was traveling on a
[1:07:06] plane and he met this
[1:07:13] woman said I can't understand why a
[1:07:15] young
[1:07:17] lady with a personality personality like
[1:07:22] yours has to do a thing like this she
[1:07:26] was
[1:07:27] smoking she said
[1:07:30] oh I get satisfaction from doing
[1:07:35] it what satisfies
[1:07:40] us what satisfies us this
[1:07:45] morning ask yourself what satisfies
[1:07:50] me your husband your wife will not
[1:07:52] satisfy you
[1:07:55] your children won't satisfy
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:08:00] you young ladies young men won't satisfy
[1:08:06] you
[1:08:13] woman as much as you try they
[1:08:19] can't only God
[1:08:22] can but we don't want
[1:08:26] that we want to fill that
[1:08:28] desire with wrong
[1:08:31] things we don't spend
[1:08:34] time how do we want to sa feel that
[1:08:39] satisfaction you
[1:08:46] can't I said that's only a satis a sub
[1:08:50] substitute
[1:08:52] satisfaction
[1:08:56] if you would just receive what I tell
[1:09:00] you and give your life completely to
[1:09:04] God there's something you're
[1:09:09] lacking Our Lives lack this
[1:09:12] morning that's why we come very
[1:09:16] Fallen because we're
[1:09:19] Desiring and we don't know what that
[1:09:21] is I don't know what that is
[1:09:25] can you
[1:09:26] stand I don't know what your desires
[1:09:28] this
[1:09:30] morning I truly don't
[1:09:33] know but I know someone that
[1:09:39] does because when I had that longing in
[1:09:41] my
[1:09:43] heart when I was lost
[1:09:47] brother when I was in the
[1:09:51] clubs when I was doing things I
[1:09:53] shouldn't be
[1:09:55] doing there was a longing in my heart
[1:09:58] there was a
[1:10:01] desire and that desire would tell me
[1:10:03] there's a higher
[1:10:05] life look this is not everything there's
[1:10:09] something
[1:10:10] else something
[1:10:12] higher there's a more
[1:10:15] glorious there's a more
[1:10:18] glorious when your life is falling
[1:10:22] to everything is fall
[1:10:24] around but inside you there's a desire a
[1:10:29] desire that's crying out for something
[1:10:35] else there has to be an
[1:10:38] answer there has to be an
[1:10:44] answer our brother Bron would
[1:10:47] say there was a child that would eat
[1:10:51] erasers do you remember that St
[1:10:55] story and he would eat
[1:10:58] them and he says inside that
[1:11:02] child he needed
[1:11:04] something in this
[1:11:08] morning if we lack
[1:11:12] something don't leave
[1:11:14] [Music]
[1:11:17] brotherr don't
[1:11:21] leave don't leave without receiving Lord

[1:11:28] true
[1:11:32] Hallelujah I can never give it to
[1:11:36] you our
[1:11:38] pastor he can't give it to
[1:11:49] you sometimes we have an attitude of not
[1:11:51] expecting anything
[1:11:55] when he is looking at
[1:11:59] us Jesus is looking at
[1:12:04] [Applause]
[1:12:05] us and he sees the deficiency in your
[1:12:08] soul in my
[1:12:13] soul and he says son daughter why not
