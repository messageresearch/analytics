[Music] me [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] like me [Music] wow [Music] [Applause] [Music] god bless you guys i mean you're happy to be in the house of the lord amen it's always good to be in the house of the lord amen i mean if you can open your scriptures with me to the book of genesis chapter 12 verse 1 through 3. uh chapter 12 verse one two three amen and i'll go ahead and read it it reads like this and yahweh said said to abram go out from your land and from your relatives and from the house of your father to the land i will show you and i will make you a great nation and i will bless you and i will make your name great and you will be a blessing and i will be those who bless you and i will bless those who bless you and those who curse you our curse and all families of the earth will be blessed in you abraham amen and also proverbs 30 verse 30. amen and i'll go ahead and read it a line which is strongest among beasts and turn it not away for any eleon animals amen uh if the brothers in the back can help me out with the video see le ceremony we're going to be starting a new a new character and uh just to start it off a little bit i'd like to read a quote from brother branham and the and uh it's from the message faith coming by hearing in this element and it reads like this it says you see mira fates berlin for nada as i once said faith has hair on the chest when it stands up and pulls its big muscles out everything else vanishes away so pretty much what burley is so lo que es fornado it's something that's strong and he says also that faith has chest hair it is meaning that it's something that's that's manly you know something that can move quite masculine yeah um uh sorry bear with me i'm a little nervous hey man i believe that abraham had this kind of fate too he was willing to leave everything he knew say it again he was willing to leave everything that he knew and it's because he knew that he knew who he was a man he knew he was the son of god of a lion leon and i say a lion leon because i believe that not a lion knows who he is he doesn't need anybody to tell him that he's not everybody already knows when the lion comes say it again everybody already knows when the lion comes around vienna and he knows it as well amen nobody should have to tell us who we are tell amen i also believe that abraham had faith that endured [Music] as the title says he waited 25 years for isaac i believe that each day that each day that the each day that he had no results he was closer to the promise i think they're going to play the video if the lion is the king of the jungle how can he be the king of the jungle if he's not the biggest the elephant is probably one of the biggest he can't be the fastest because that's a cheater he can't be the smartest so he's not the biggest the fastest or the smartest so how does a lion become the king of the jungle his mentality [Music] that's the only difference of a lion and an elephant when a lion walks up and sees an elephant he thinks lunch or elephant things run and it's all mentality because when a male lion walks up he may be outnumbered by a pack of hyenas but i'm king of my jungle because of my mentality what happens when you're a gazelle and you're not being pushed you're not being prodded you're not giving it a reward nobody's encouraging you what happens when you're a gazelle and the lion's not chasing anymore you stop grinding but what happens when you're a lion when you are a lion it does not make a difference you realize that if your family is going to eat that if that pack of lions is to survive then you gotta go hunt a part of being a beast just ain't even gazelle a part of being a beast is the hush it's the heart that they're excited about they like to see the gazelles run then boom they take off because real lions like to hunt they love the process just as much as they love the prize and some of y'all just want to score you don't like the process you're not in love with the process a true hunter's goal is not the prize a true hunter's goal is to hunt that's what they live for they live to hunt they don't just live to catch it it's the whole process when you are a true hunter you don't go by time you go by the gazelle when you are a true hunter you hunt until you get a gazelle and you don't stop until you get one and then you get another and then you get another and you get another if you gonna do what you say you're gonna do be what you say you're gonna be you're gonna have to lie me out you're a gazelle you won't come up short you're a gazelle you're gonna have an average experience you're a student i need you in lion mode you're an entrepreneur i need you in line more you're trying to lose weight lying mo you can't do nothing significant in gazelle mode nothing nothing impressive happens in gazelle mode nothing happened in run mode give up mode quit mode scared mode fearful mode nothing happens everything happened in line mode like i'm coming to get you hey man i feel like i don't even have to preach anymore i was kind of afraid to show the video because of that for the amen so we'll just go ahead and go over the the characteristics of faith again so faith is burley man is for uh here on foreign chest amen amen amen and uh faith is also tenacious and what that means what tenacious means is holding on when it's more attractive to let go of amen when it's when it's more attractive to let go and so then abraham had to leave the world behind bro everything he knew elsa yeah but we just need to develop it and strengthen it why does our faith fail sometimes because we still haven't fully uh decided to commit to god some days we're all foray and other days it's it seems like we're we're not sure but lions have an instinct the lion's instincts set him apart is what sets us apart why doesn't our faith endure sometimes our faith doesn't endure because we build it on shifting sands we build it upon our mind upon what we think faith needs something solid to be built on solido is the word of god amen and our faith can't be built on our emotions we feel like and our faith doesn't endure because sometimes we want it to happen instantly that kind of faith is [Music] faith that doesn't want to suffer that faith that doesn't want to be tested the gazelle is only wrong when they're being chased brothers and your back's up against that's the kind of faith of a lion brother that's abraham's face why because lions are active brothers lions are lions are they're real their faith is real it's genuine and faith without works is say it again if we want a gazelle there's a book full of them right here are you unlimited all you have to do is keep chasing them brothers god's only as big as you want to be if you want to if you want a great god grande he's a great god if you want to make believe god then he's uh he's a make-believe guy man amen amen glory to god it all happens when you have the faith of a lion brothers like he said you can't do anything when you're in gazelle mode you can't do anything without suffering nope as i said now without your faith being tested now just think about that one thing that problem is whatever you're going through whatever you need in your life right now and and just pray for it brothers and have that mentality of a lion brothers don't give up whatever whatever it is i believe that that god that god has already given it to you [Applause] amen god bless you brothers god i would rather be right here than be anywhere else we could be out there in the world we could be out there we chose to be here amen if you could please stand brothers if you could please open your bibles to genesis chapter 12 verse 103. when you have peace out of thy country along with the scripture i want to read a quote from brother branham called israel in egypt is the israelite preached in 1953 and it says like this not because i'm going to save your my brothers and i chose you shouldn't have fifth like a gazelle because then we prefer to run in this now i would like to speak about something very important which is the faith of abraham see abraham's life was one of the biggest examples of faith in obedience abraham's influence influence came to spread in all the families of the years we already know abraham is the father of faith what happened in abraham's life is something that we have to understand because it is for each and every one of us and why is it friction the apostle paul says in galatians chapter 3 verse according to the promise we all come from the seat of abraham and abraham came to also be the father of faith and why in the father of faith and out of your parents house you know i asked myself this question you know why would god do that why would god ask abraham to leave his home we're attached to the things of this of outsiders i wanted to tell a question to the youth you know how many of us are here in church but from come from the bad cut from that bad influence you know and by god saying all of that all that was to start a new beginning and us brothers [Music] you uh the middle you're rejoicing do you really want to follow me then let go of everything let all those bad habits that you have oh how about give me a [Applause] and that's why he asked us to leave our bad habits and sometimes even things in this family in the family but we don't want to because we prefer to keep those bad habits with us uh you see abraham there was something about him abraham had disobedience over the inside that was unbreakable you see abraham he left right away i want to read a quote by brother brown he only made this promise to abraham after you have given a test the seed of abraham must first be tested to see if they really believe the word and was tested whether he believed it or not or will we take what man said about it we take what some organization has made up as a creed or do we take what god said if god's word is true we believe god's word regardless of what anything else is everyone in this room we might not be tested like how exactly how abraham exactly but we will be testing in our character we will be testing our patients and in our he's going to put us through tests he is going to put us to test in trials you see one of the biggest tests was not when god asked him to leave his land i believe it was the biggest test when god asked abraham to sacrifice his son isaac you know i can't imagine how hard it was for abraham and you know some people might wonder uh yes god already knew abraham's love you just wanted to see if abraham really put him first in life if he truly loved him you see god doesn't test us so that he may know what's in our heart he tests us so that we may know what's in here because without the trauma you see god is going to put us in trials and many times it won't it would be hard for us to let go of things it's going to be hard to let go of those bad habits that we have who are we to question god knows what's best for us let's start trusting god putting faith in god even when things don't make sense because like it says in proverbs chapter 3 verse 5. proverbs god [Applause] can you guys hear me yeah i'll see you later man god bless our brother uh samuel diego for that word brother branham says that i know what i know uh we all have a super sense and that's our that's a sixth sense yes which is faith and we need that in order to let go of what we are attached to on this earth he says that that sense dominates all others i'll just read a and then we'll uh we'll stop there um hebrews 11 8 it says by by by faith abraham when he was called to go into a place which he which he should after receive an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went abraham oh give me one second sorry uh but uh we're so we're in the topic of uh uh and the bible character of abraham estamos and abraham like our brothers uh they said to leave his friends his family so god tells abraham abraham i have a plan for you i won't tell you what it is the plan i will not give you the details but you have to trust me out in me just know now you cannot stay here you cannot possess the things that you have no no and have you have to let go you know brothers if you want to exp a a a new level of experience with god get us a higher experience is going to take some obedience you know and the problem with us is that we have a spirit we have an attitude of unwillingness [Music] we all in here have something that god has told us to let go to let go long time ago we're still holding on to it you you could say oh i stopped drinking and smoking this is opaque but your eyes say otherwise but the smell that you have on you say otherwise god i haven't watched pornography in over two months god i haven't used profanity i haven't used makeup you know it's not about when was the last time you used it oh how long it's been about what have you done to block it out of your life i want to obey god i want to obey god coming out of my mouth i want to obey god with the things coming out of my mouth with what my eyes see they're located my but that's obvious just to resist resist to disobey is to go against god you know if it's hard to to to obey god you know we start putting excuses and justifying ourselves and we might say oh but what if uh god's will is not what i want that's right i think this is better for me this will be better for my life god says i'm gonna change my my my my plans the other miraculous way can be planned and he will understand and get the point god has me waiting too much that's not for me this is something that i struggle myself with the hardest discipline discipline for me discipline i think for any christian christian is waiting is esperanto amen we take two steps forward and god and i want you to understand as well but we do have control over our preparedness for that promise the way we prepare ourselves and how long we take to prepare ourselves from giving us the promise that he he's going to give us you know and and james in the book of james he tells us that uh let patience be be perfected in us so that we could be complete and lack nothing later on in life amen i'm a reader hebrews 11 uh i'll skip nine let's go to ten hebrews 11 10. vamos aller ebreos onse it says for he looked for a city which has foundations whose builder and maker is god fundamental architecture you know by faith abraham uh he uh he chose to live as a as a foreigner so he wouldn't get attached to your you know god told abraham i would take you to the to what i promised to you but you were you're gonna have to go through some tough times you're gonna go through struggles uh difficult you're gonna problem and we will walk in the lowest point of life and it amazes me because some like jesus put as an example you know and so let me so i'm gonna tell you so let's go when you're in your lowest point of your life and bring the kingdom of heaven to your onto down to earth you know jesus when he was walking through all that israel jordan just going through what he went through el paso he probably didn't understand what god had for him but even like that he obeyed and what amazes me is that the bible says that abraham is that everywhere he went he carried his altar he had an altar with him at all times you know when he found himself in desperation not knowing what to do i used to leave my altar here and just come and pick it up every sunday evening no and it shouldn't be like that we should give god our worship every single day brother branham says that abraham was tested but not not just abraham but his seed as well you know isaac was tested as well when god told abraham to to sacrifice isaac you know and i could just picture a father i could picture abraham all day staying confused that morning [Music] and uh the message abraham's covenant confirmed [Music] you know this just brings to my to my to my to my mind i don't know how many been to a brother alex's house in his backyard i'm the only one [Laughter] i i got no respect i got no response but in his backyard there's uh he has like a fire pit um okay and that that just came to my mind yes you know i figured that's how maybe abraham set it up he put stones and then the fire and all that el god will provide for himself a lamp for this sacrifice [Music] there you are thing i'm doing is just following instructions it's up to god to provide the lamb depended on how am i going to receive my sight how am i going to come over without failure god will provide for himself a lamb for the sacrifice it was through abraham's face he he got in with the with the program he knew what was happening abraham and isaac we're going up the mountain on one side god had already had the ram going up the other side you know god had the ram already he had already provided that lamb hey man i'm gonna be closing the musicians could come forward you know if you're you're trying to kill the thing that's trying to take you down that's keeping you away from god listen you you have to die to your own self you know god will resurrect something out of you [Music] you know isaac was the type of jesus christ you know jesus didn't want to die jesus no more he the bible says that he prays he prayed three times before before being crucified [Music] [Music] you know so he went to obey god and he died on the cross [Applause] so guess what you could do tonight so guess what you can do tonight so que perez you can die tonight too because your resurrection is around the corner you know if you want to get to your destiny you know you might not have all the details of where you're gonna go through life just like our brother said activate your sixth sense you know it's impossible to please god it's impossible [Music] where did the ram come from [Music] the creators spoke the lamp existence you may you might go
