========================================
thank you [Music] Lord I give you my [Music] name [Music] is [Music] thank you [Music] I give you my soul [Music] every breath that I [Music] [Applause] get out of yours [Music] the days in mind to [Music] order [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] today I live forever [Music] and Lord I give you my [Music] mind [Music] every breath that I take every morning [Music] thank you God bless you brethren we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as you're standing I invite you open your Bible to the book of First Samuel chapter 18. verse on verse one and on how are you this evening we hope that you're okay first Samuel chapter 18 verse 1 and on if when you have it if you can please say Amen so I know that we're ready to read what if God says like this and they came to pass when he had made an an end of speaking on to saw that Saul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David and Jonathan loved him as his own soul and Saul to Kim that day and we let him go no more home to his father's house then Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as much as he his own soul foreign that was upon him and gave it to David and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle um sometimes we come with so many things in our minds and it's difficult to process what is Lord I know I don't have enough words to speak I don't have the capacity take your seats and this evening we're speaking as their title youth Brothers a great person in the Bible the friendship that David had with Jonathan I believe that before speaking on Concentra you don't have to answer just meditate how many people nowadays can say yes here she is a good friend look is your friend you come to church means you have a friend is my friend or they are my friend really open with what you like what moves what are your true intentions you can find good friends or good friendships in this time Society we have friends to our own uh ideologies what does this mean yes this person oh he's my friend that's how it is not in agreement that he's not my friendship how they are a true friendship I believe responsibility you are wrong in this area that is not a true friendship it's just a friendship just words field of Israel amen is I have to translate in my mind he was the royal seed he was a royal seat of a royal lineage see David they had to have something in common I could imagine brothers and sisters Jonathan almost occasion youth telling the general is this young man David won Mega no he is he got ahead of me to fight against Goliath ills because the Bible speaks to us in the next chapter Jonathan sees this this happening Goliath tomorrow Jonathan I'm almost sure yes those that study the Bible say he was there when he sees this this man the characteristics of David and his heart is connected the Bible says that David was according to the god dare to say he wasn't far away from the heart of Christ foreign he won a battle when Jonathan sees this something changes in the heart of Jonathan the Bible tells us love them as himself when I read this church May um they became one it's hard for you to be able to be another person with another person yes it was a prince look closely see this young man he recognizes it's going to be something great you know why he reckons garment [Applause] you know what it typifies the Royal garment a prince look you sometimes is difficult to admit for for someone else or someone else is better than you is that right nowadays it's hard for us as humans and I believe it happens than me is doing his Royal Royal but now you're winning here you're getting it now is the mind you mind because because nowadays you don't even see little today we can't we can make a compliment a sincere compliment what's your compliments we can't well I told myself I was I was not going to speak but I feel it the compliments we do only by conveniences sometimes by convenience for a convenience the Friendship of these two young people United [Applause] recognize their positions there's David there is the mantle the position what else did he give him the Bible is here says garments you know what the garments signifier means possessions amen what a tremendous friendship this is friend the friendship was so great David says some tremendous words I'm just summarizing a little here so David as Jonathan did that love in the woman because you open you know this is no true friendships okay I'm ready but the Bible says true friendship that was so different but yeah they had the same time they United they made a covenant what a tremendous thing or the robe garments you give him his garments he gives them his sword Jonathan is letting go of things may God help us what we can say I want to find a friendship that hurts a true friendship requires of sacrifices it requires to be able to say um yes Brothers see yes I've always thought about this and I know there is that they can do a better job that they do it and you want to be the star s [Music] so the whole world can see me successful everything he let go you know what this is not for me this is foreign I believe there's a lot but okay meditate I close and our pastor comes forth we have to find friendships not only see their own convenience I admire La Iglesias that the church that my children are growing in is my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren Iglesia I admire it to be a church I desire to be a churches where there's true friendships I know I know God has given us and I'm very happy now take this time to say thank you for everything you've done all of the helps in the name of my daughter of my son-in-law told me I feel so happy pero LA mistadermanos but the Friendship is accepting as we are as how we are see yes almost different except that we are different yes we can be different but yet have a link that unites us let's keep pushing forward foreign because I believe it's a very important story because it speaks to us and how to be true friends as God is a true friend there's no greater friend than God yes when when is first time 23. verse one hello hello yeah yeah okay you see that Jonathan helps David escape and in this chapter 23. and they rob the threshing floors so it is therefore David inquired of the Lord saying shall I go and smite these Philistines and the Lord said unto David go and smite the Philistines and save Kayla now for you to get an idea of what's going on here uh David David he had he fled from Saul is [Music] he's trying to save his life because I was looking for him certain people that begin to pursue as well it is during this time that he's fleeing he truly becomes a leader before the eyes of the people the Bible says so David begins to have a gathering of people around of a bunch of weird people because David was uh he was weird in his worship he was on the way he did things on one occasion he even had to like a crazy because you're someone who understands us with these Rebels [Music] verse 5 says so David and his men went to Kayla and fought with the Philistines and brought away their cattle and smelt them with the great Slaughter so David saved the inhabitants of Kayla he went to go fight a battle that wasn't his foreign God hath delivered him into my hand for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath Gates and bars David goes in helps the city um Kayla that was surrounded by walls it was close he realizes that he's closed off and he says oh God blessed be the name of the Lord tremendous how everyone worships God right verse 12. David realizes that Saul's coming down and he had just helped the people from now look at what class of friends David had done all that he could with his girlfriend he helped him to win the battle against the Philistines the king comes and he says now I have David David so David Goes these people have just happened they're going to help me or they're going to turn me in and God says they're going to turn you in now notice how God guys go to Canada how many have you have experienced betrayal comes they betray you and I tell you Brothers someone who speaks of others will speak of you as well as a pastor I tell you we'll speak of you as well yes this is verse 14 says and David Abode in the wilderness and strongholds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of zif and saw Sodom every day but God delivered him not into his hands the Wilderness it was a Refinery the it was the Wilderness it's where they refine the minerals foreign God is working God is refining you foreign for the last time so on the campus Jonathan was there as well his son but he was David secret friend as well he was a secret uh inside guy his friend and went to David into the wood and it says and strengthened his hand in God did find it no they're still in control I don't know if he found him or if David allowed himself to be found but the thing is I look at what Jonathan does this is the last time he's going to see him that's why Amigo his friend he knows his friend is in danger you know what his dad is looking for him of course he's not going to tell his dad where his friend is but he goes and seeks him and look at what a true friend does he says it says and he went to David and strengthened his hand in God now this is tremendous many people cry with you they complain with me Amigos the very few friends or those that encourage you no says yes you're going to be able to do it want to be your friend David was going to be friends with him [Music] because he made a pact a covenant um it required for them to go and sacrifice and it requires work you were showing that he was serious in what he was doing I believe that a true friendship commitment it requires someone who says there's no greater friend than the Lord when we're doing well when we're not he was putting himself on David's side and not on the side of his father he was making a decision we can't be everyone's friend we can be friendly with everyone are you with me but he who is a friend of all is a friend to No One COC yes or yes the person who tries he's gonna he's gonna go wrong with everyone you have to decide who's going to be your true friend you can love everyone Jesus Jesus [Music] I call you my friends a true friend he gives his life for December foreign foreign was great makes you feel like you're great and if you want to be a true friend because look Brothers I beg God foreign I believe that is if you find a true friend here on Earth it's better than winning the lottery but it's not easy I hope that all of us have a Jonathan but if we can't have a Jonathan let's be a Jonathan then foreign foreign amen let me tell you we can be Jonathan's we can be a Jonathan uh Our obligation should be to be a Jonathan for for God for the Lord Jesus Christ to to give up their Throne that is what Jonathan did he gave up his throne but nobody wants to be number two foreign [Music] to give up his throne he knew he was going to fail David it was not going to fail he was not going to fail David and that he knew that David was going to fail him it was not going to fail was not going to fail him meet it look at first Samuel 20. this is the second time we find Jonathan with David first Samuel 20. first Samuel 20 verse 13. it says I love this story that's why God placed in my heart to speak on this you can read chapter 20 yes that's when they would be uh chapter 20 uh there's an encounter between Jonathan and David and David tells Jonathan your dad wants to kill me through Spirit through another Spirit a third Spirit now look how tremendous Jonathan is he still believed in his father and the Bible says that Jesus says obey my Commandments is a requirement to be the friend of Jesus I think that being a friend of Jesus makes you want to follow his Commandments I'll do whatever you ask David and David asked or tells him there's a big Feast here and I'm not gonna I'm gonna go there they did a certain Feast here and if your father gets upset then you're gonna know he wants to kill me now the feast is is brought about and David doesn't come to sit at the king's table because he was already a part of the king's Nobles he is he just has something going on he wasn't able to make it the following day yes where is Dave located he wanted him there so he could kill him Saul gets angry with Jonathan you know one of the things one of the reasons for which anger is so stupid because sometimes we think we can direct or Channel it towards a certain person or object anger problemas the problem is that anger cannot be controlled do you think that you're just gonna hate brother Titus but you end up hating your own family because anger begins to disperse it begins to spread and what happened why are you angry that he throws us Spirit his own son that's what anger does you say oh I'm just angry I'm just angry with the sisters with this person no no no no no if you if you're going to end out angry with your own family because anger always yes David and he goes and he tells David and they make a pact IC verse 13. or in verse 15. they said the Lord do so and much more to Jonathan but if it pleased my father to do the evil then I will shoe it to thee and send thee away that thou May is go in peace and the Lord be with thee as he hath is and thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the Lord that I die not Siempre from thy house forever know not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David everyone from the face of the Earth that they made David would always protect Jonathan and Jonathan would always protect David and the good and the bad and the difficult times any person can be a friend in the easy times in chapter 23 Jonathan takes the risk he's in the camp of his father he goes at least for his friend David he goes and he doesn't begin to complain with him you help them Jonathan comes to David he tells him David David strengthen yourself he said that he strengthened David's hands what a tremendous when he sees you foreign don't forget it I am your friend is God is with you yes don't get discouraged continue everything's gonna be okay God's not going to leave you the way to have Fellowship all of us in prayer I just asked myself tonight friend The Sinner is you want someone you want are you truly Desiring something that you haven't had before are you truly Desiring something to shake it you desire for someone to love you and I will never quit loving you please stand when David became a king the first thing he did is there anyone left in the house of salt whom I can take mercy upon For the Love of Jonathan and I'm going to tell you something we can all be a Jonathan to our Lord Jesus Christ if there is someone who is worth it to unite with it's the Lord Jesus Christ he is of the seed of David and we can all be a Jonathan [Music] all give up the correct place we have control over our lives [Music] but we can give it to him you can say God I don't want to control them I don't want this control over my life I want you to have first place and dreams imagine for a moment when Jonathan was a young uh maybe 10 years of age he would put him on his lap you would say son you're going to be the next king and you're going to Reign after me and the whole kingdom is going to be yours I imagine Jonathan saying am I going to be able to yeah you're going to be able to sit on this [Music] when Jonathan heard yes yes David had been anointed as king that there was no one like him Jonathan said I am willing to give up all of my dreams give up all that I want because he is the true king do you truly are you truly willing to let go of your dreams tonight and be friends of his to become his friend he will be a true friend why don't you allow him to decide foreign [Music] where is my friend where is his family he was my friend on Earth Jesus Christ will be king over the Earth and I want him to say I desire for him to say he gave it all for me and he was a true friend don't you want him to say that of you glory to God Amen [Music] I made this invitation to you if you desire [Music] for someone to love you and you haven't found anyone I invite you find him if you felt alone [Music] if you felt like they betrayed you you don't have true friends you find him he is willing if you are willing foreign you don't have to feel alone there's a true friend his own life you have to take a risk and that's that this evening perhaps there's one of you a person I feel like David perhaps betrayed are you though he helped and they turned them in yeah but there's a true friend God never leaves us alone send the comforter send the comforter send the comforter [Music] I speak this from my heart because many times I fell alone and the one who's always been there for me is him no one else understands me he understands me look at me and criticize me I haven't left you just tell us if you look for him you'll find him if you look for him you'll find him he's there waiting as we worship Him [Music] once you get rid of okay why don't you uh from your group from your ideas get further from
