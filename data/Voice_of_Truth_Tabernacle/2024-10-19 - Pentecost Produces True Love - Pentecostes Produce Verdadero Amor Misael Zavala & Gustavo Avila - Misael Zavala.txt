we thank the pastor for the opportunity we send greetings to our brothers in California Peru Peruan and all those who watch through the internet and the word says like this if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him and he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall also live also and on that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be led of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him amen I'll be jumping to verse 25 these things I have spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you may you please bow your heads beloved Heavenly Father Lord we give you thanks for giving us the opportunity to hear your word I ask you now Lord may it be you speaking and for those that are needy may you give them what they need open the hearts and the and the ears of those who are hearing help me and my interpreter and my brother Gustavo and his interpreter Lord we place this service in your hands in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen you may take your seats here we are seeing before the Lord is crucified he is telling them that he is going away but he'll send the Holy Ghost he says he will beg the father now after that he is crucified and dies as it has been spoken to us in previous preachings and after defeating Satan in hell that Roman seal they placed on the tomb was broken and now Life Starts to sprout out the tomb is removed or the stone is removed and this night youth if you have a stone let's hope that the Lord Jesus Christ can remove it of course you need to be willing for that so the Lord can rub any stone in your heart to receive him now he rises amongst the Dead [Music] and forgive me I'm talking about Pentecost my brother Gustavo and I as a title we place Pentecost produces true love so then when he rises amongst the dead and at Pentecost he he lasts 40 days so that Pentecost could be fulfilled when he ascended to heaven and the apostles unite together in the upper room they t 10 days more so there is 50 days which is Pentecost I won't get too into that uh I'd like to read acts 1 six when they therefore came together and asked him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times nor the seasons which the father had put in his power in his own power but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the Earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven these same this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall also come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called ol which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's Journey ju and phip m al Sim and when they were come in they went into the upper room where AB both Peter and James and John and Andrew Philip and Thomas and Barth Barth and Matthew James and Son of alus and Simon zelot and Judas the brother of James these all continued with one according prayer and supplication with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his Brethren now we're seeing the ascending of Jesus to heaven and he promises again the holy spirit that will not leave them comfortless he would beg the fathers to not leave them orphans uh but in verse 14 it says they were in one Accord in prayer and supplication and one mind in the heart one sole purpose of course for this they needed obedience it's very difficult for us sometimes not just the Lord sometimes to our parents to the pastor to the leaders of the church it's easy for us to Rebel but we must come to the point where we're in one Accord with the word of God now I'll place an example uh when you youth make a gathering when you make an event uh perhaps they ask you what do you need or what's your opinion for example what food would you like to bring perhaps some people say chicken are there's some pizzas maybe back there someone raises their hand and says animal crackers now that's not where they should be in one Accord where they should be in one Accord is the purpose of the event what are you going to do with what Spirit are you taking this matter why how will you realize the spirit you have Tak that you're taking this seriously you you get to a decision and many people have different opinions at the end one sole opinion will be left what you should observe is what type of spirit you come out of that Gathering are you mad at towards the other youth are you happy are you in agreement What Spirit are you taking What Spirit are you leaving from that Gathering since the Old Testament there's been a promise why because the Holy Ghost is promised to everyone in general for those of the message the denominations and even those who don't go to church I'll be reading Joel 228 and it shall come pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days I will pour out my spirit prophe it's a prophecy later on says before the great so it's in these times now in 29 I want to make a separation here in verse 28 says my spirit will pour out on upon All Flesh in in general matter if you're from the message or Den denominational he will pour out his Spirit but in 29 he makes a separation and because he says and also upon the servants and the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit so that touches the true children of God to the to the elected why because it's not for everyone brother Bram typifies in Exodus Exodus 26 through Moses they were taken out of Egypt when we're they're taken out of Egypt taken to the wilderness brother BR typifies it with the Mana the Mana came down every day but if they stored it it would rot that was left on the floor it would melt but there in [Music] Exodus God ordains Moses and Moses tells Aaron that that first Mana he should pick it up and place it before Jehovah where in the Holy place what does this mean in the holiest place not anyone could enter only the high priest could enter there now this Mana Jehovah tells him to keep it for his descendant what descendant us but in Exodus in the Old Testament The Descendants are the priests because only the priest could enter the holiest place uh I want to read a hidden life preached in 1955 now when they eat this man remember they eat it many people eat it and said this is it they had to gather it fresh every day that's right they had to gather the fresh every day because along about 9:00 on their second step it would go melting it would perish and many times people living in God's second room even in communion after they already received the word and come into the second step of receiving Christ into their life and never yet know that the secet and never yet know what the that secret room is what that bedroom what the rest place is they eat that Mana but did you notice that if they lay too long if finally melted out there was it perished away and I think a lot of people had had a lot of Campground cramps anyhow and when they go to eat the Lord and on on the campground and before another revival can be come along they're all back twisted up in some kind of cult or something else what's the matter brother you've never walked in somewhere else now age doesn't matter you can enter into that room 10 11 12 13 14 15 years old does not matter how young you are matters is the communion you have with God not the days of service in any moment why we all want to receive the Holy Ghost we all want to be filled but we should make the effort sometimes the Devil comes with his lies like in the world they tell you enjoy your young but what do you prefer enjoy your your your youthfulness in this world or enjoy your youthfulness in eternity it's two options you can live here and live freely and pretend like you're fine appear like you're rejoicing but you have the option to Rejoice over there don't don't waste your youth surrender to god7 he says God said Moses make your golden pot Allelujah and there placed this mana and remember that a Believer when he walked in there that Mana never did run out it was always fresh and new and sweet as the days went by as the years went by and any man who comes to Christ and hides away and the veil falls behind him he's in the presence of almighty God eating the Mana day and night from one hour to another it's always as just as sweet as it was the first day of telling to your soul that's what we need today is to get into the things are not not stand off and pretend or not stand off and act but actually get in there amen now that Mana typifies the Holy Ghost mes picked it up in the beginning that Mana before the Lord lasted the 40 years they were in the wilderness until they entered into the promised land and the holy ghost that was given in the upper room today it is fresh [Music] Youth and it will not run out until we leave here but it's up to you if you want to enter and take of that fresh Mana now for that you need dedication dedicate your life make the effort Place more of your part if you put two parts of your life put another two and then add another two I'd like to read in dedication preached in 62 and when his body had been made a sacrifice the correct lamb had been sacrificed there was coming forth God came into his old body which was his bride and there had been and there have been 120 temples that God created was ready for dedication that had got all their unbelief beat out of them and they gathered in the upper room and waited for 10 days for dedicational service then when completely surrendered surrendered God came down again in the Shina glory and filled all the house where they were sitting now it won't be easy why because it said all unbelief God beat it out of them that's why you struggle that's why many times you say I can't no more I understand I was also young but you can do it brother young man young lady the only thing you need is to dedicate a little bit more day after day dedicate more obey God obey your parents if your parents bring you because many times we say we were brought here because my parents brought me here they don't bring you just to get lost they bring you so you can obtain eternal life why because your parents love you perhap perhaps you don't agree with them in a lot of things but agree with them in the word the church in that way even so the church the word in one Accord in one word so he can pour out his sh Glory here may God bless you God bless you God bless you can you turn around and greet your neighbor give him a smile because there's a lot of power in a smile there is a lot of power in a smile let's let's if you can please if they go to Galatians 5 verse and if you have notes you can write it down the title of this message Pentecost produces true love amen amen Pentecost produces True Love Tonight with the help of the Holy Spirit if he allows me I going be basing a little bit what I uh my thoughts tonight with what brother Bram says in the message but let us go to Galatians chapter 5 verse 19 here we have two things the Flesh and then the the fruits of the spirit amen it says now the works of the flesh are manifested which are these adultery fornication uncleanliness l Idol idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath Strife s sedation if I'm saying that right SED seditions thank you and heresies envying murders drunkenness re revealing and such like all right we understand that I know it's a lot but that's why I say write it down you can go read it later now let's go to verse 22 it says but the fruits of the spirit is what's the first one love and we just said Pentecost produces true love and it continues love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness and Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law all right now I'm going to bring you back to the message brother brandham says why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live a Christian Life I think we all know this this message amen we've all read it as a young man I've read this message a lot of times brother Bram says this Pentecost is an experience amen do we have Christian Believers here amen amen and he says an experience that constrains you to the love of God constrain in other words it pushes you it drives you to the love of God every time brother brandham says Pentecost is an experience he always ties it or connected to not an organization or denomination ain't that right in other words a way of a system if you can call it or a way of thinking how things should be again we're talking about Pentecost the experience of Pentecost and as young people you know you we strive for that mostly and a true genuine experience with God amen amen youth are you guys here because this is our service a true genuine experience with God but many of the times as humans and adults do it as well we compare lives We compare Our Lives to others how they're doing how they're going and because we compare our lives with their lives we start to find our flaws right our differences between that person and the other I know it's obvious we've been told time and time again don't base or compare yourself to someone's life but compare yourself to the word compare yourself to what God's word says because when you see a person's life here at church at home you're simply seeing the keyhole You're simply seeing their life through a keyhole you're not seeing their whole life that's why I say it again compare yourself to the word and that's why we just read Galatians right now and that's why I said Pentecost produces true love because you have the works of the of the flesh right and then you have the of the then the fruits of the spirit brother Bram says the devil can IM Ates all things except one thing and that's love brother and that's what Pentecost is it produces true love but many times as young people and adults as well we doubt we we have reasoning ain't that right am I the only one am I the only one that ask themselves question after question day by day because I believe a true son and daughter of God checks himself daily questions are every step of the way and if you're not then today is a good day to start cuz Brothers young men young ladies they saying a light battle it's not a light battle we have to check ourselves every step of the way checked our experience much yes no doubting not doubting but check it not with someone else's life but with the word of God cuz many people say and I've been there oh brother Gustavo I've had an experience with the Lord I jumped and shouted and did this did that oh it was something I couldn't control brother sister that's yes I'm not trying to steal that away from you it's part of it yes but it's not all it brother M just read it I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh right but then he said servants right in other words those that want more work for something I'm going read this quote from brother brandham he says in the message what it takes to overcome all unbelief our faith brother Bram he said he says you already have you have already supplied everything in you everything is in inside of you but he says so many people today I find when they join church and here especially in America they just become Drifters now listen to this and when brother Bram said this I said I was the first one he says he calls them Drifters he says you never got saved just to be a member of a church you got saved to work come on you got saved to work brother bam says so I just because I came to service I felt a chill on my back I I did enough to justify my actions of the day of yesterday no it's needed of more dig more work more check yourself every step of the way he says we got we got saved to work amen and I love this we don't dress an army up just to lay around of the corner and flirt with the [Music] girls with pretty Uniforms on it doesn't close anymore but you get it you look nice here you look the parts but what's inside we fill everything out here what's going on here he says we train our army to fight fight against our own selves fighting again fighting against my own reasoning my own way of thinking because the greatest enemy that Gustavo has is Gustav and that Gustavo a doesn't like checking himself with the word day by day because every single day he sees that while he's living what he's doing he's missing the targets and it hurts cuz then you have to drop you have to bring down your ego it brings down your pride and makes you realize where you're really at and checks your experience if it's real or not cuz if it's of God it'll produce God right amen again we all want to have that genuine experience that ex Pentecost experience is it all right if I'm talking simple tonight glory to God brother Bram one time was talking to a young man this young man had gone to church after church wanting a true genuine experience he wants something real right we all want something real right cuz only the real stuff will last and emotion is going to come and go this young man tells brother brandham brother Bram I went to so and so evangelist and he told me to to do this that and this this other evangelist told me to go into a room and pray until I speak in tongues but but some just something just doesn't sit with me something just doesn't connect right brother bam talks to the young man and talks to him about his experience when he accepted the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ he asked him when you accepted him and you went back to your life and you went to do the same things that you did did you feel something did you feel your something truly deep inside your heart pulling you back from that he says yes brother br it's very simple what you're just telling me is that you've had a true genuine experience but you haven't realized it yet and many of the times that's how we are the devil has to do his part he has to mix throw thoughts to our minds makes us doubt makes us reason against but brother brandham says that if you feel something that when you used to do things you don't feel right with it obviously we can say it's God but do don't stay there add on work build upon that and keep on working deeper and deeper because if you just stay with the superficial stuff as easy as the wind comes by it's going to blow it all way and then you're going to find yourself falling again this may seem very very basic stuff but I think it's necessary the ABCs what's the point of algebra what's the point of the Mysteries what's the point of our pastor preaching on Sunday mornings on Wednesday nights on the Rapture if we can't get this down if we can't truly check ourselves and be honest for be real with myself cuz I could say yes I had an experience like I said the devil can intim imitate the rest but not love brother Bram says he says this I'm g go to this message he says he Compares that spirit in Acts 22 17 when he says I shall pour out my in in the last days God says I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh brother brand says he connects that to an apple [Music] tree he says then what is these other things it's attributes apples that fall off the tree see but don't get the Apple for the tree get the tree and it will bear the [Music] apples you can all you can have all the signs and F Fant Fantastics you want to pick up under the tree and still not have the tree the trees got the life he says and continues you see you're just taking something that fell off the tree get the tree first and it will bear itself but if your tree isn't yielding these things there it is then there's something wrong that's what you want he says is that what you want church is that what you want young man young sister when you do something or when you have an experience you had a with God but then you go back and you find yourself in the same thing it was just all superficial [Music] nothing deep inside TR happened and the reason why is because you didn't let it remain enough we simply come to service yes with our problems but we raise our hands just enough we listen enough just so that we can go back and justify our actions carry on hold on to that hatred hold on to that jealousy CU that's hard hating someone is hard but there's so many people that I've been there I would rather stay with that rather live a life like that blind they say I'm rich but I am poor they say they have it all but they have nothing if you don't have love then you have nothing and true Pentecost produces true love but we got to check it check it with the word every step of the way it says in first Timothy I'm gonna I'm GNA be closing out chapter four it says verse one and two now the spirit speaketh expressedly that in the latter times are we not in the latter times then this scripture is telling me that it's talking about right now that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils that doesn't happen here right verse two though speaking lies in hypocrisy but I like this part and when I read this I truly believe it was God having their conscience seared with an iron hot IR you know what it is to have a sheared conscience is that you can't feel it Judas had a sear conscience the Bible says that he stole but yet he was still doing the works of God killing people going out doing the works every time that he stole from the offering he had a sear conscience cuz what he felt on the outside what he did here at church Justified what his wrong please stand what we just read in Galatians brother bham says that all the devil does with God's creation is he simply perverts adultery and fornication is a perversion of love all the works of the flesh is simply a perversion of love all the works of the flesh is just a simple perversion of the love the love of God and we and that's why I say we got to check ourselves because many of the times I've been there where we try to stand we we do things because we say oh it's because of love I stand up myself because I got to love myself I stand up for myself because I got to love myself first I got to protect myself I love my family therefore I got to protect them from anything that anyone says about them and the way I react is because of [Music] love we say we love but we act like Peter drawing our sword in the action of love protecting Jesus and slicing off an ear but then here comes my Jesus showing true love holding his tongue holding his tongue when they pulled out his beard said nothing when they hit him on his head that's true love and that's a hard kind of love CU while we're still in this flesh we're going to fight against this flesh well that's why not only having an experience but make sure that experience produces true love let us pray gracious heavenly father I'm no one to say anything the first person with flaws isav the first one that needs to be checked is Gustav a the person that thinks they're fine every time I look at your word Lord what my Prophet tells me the life of my Prophet it makes me feel so far away from you but God I want it bad cuz it's hard it ain't easy I want to do what I want to do I want to say what I want to say but thank you because you hold me you hold me Lord and you check me and I love you for that Lord tonight Lord it wasn't emotional and I pray that it a't but may someone take this not only apply it to their lives but right now really deep deep think deep in everything that they've done and go to your word and check themselves because that's the only truth that we got is your blessed word we love you Lord and I pray that it be of blessing to your people I love them they're my friends they're my family people that put up with me with all my flaws but I don't want to make it that day or they make it that day without me or I without them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ pray amen amen amen [Music] down from his [Music] glory ever living story my God and savior [Music] came and Jesus
