doing something for the kingdom you want to be remembered his grandchildren will remember him you sorry Pablo phone number Paul was a man of vision he had purpose in his life in my life but he did with the pillar of fire that man had his vision and it was his vision but then God's Vision comes he says you know what I gotta knock you off your horse the vision of God for your life amen Pablo Paul with great Ambitions people with great purpose have great ambitions you should have ambition for God ambition to do more for God to find my purpose of my vision to do so foreign Celestia is you know what brothers Paul had his own vision and then he found a great purpose and a vision in himself and then here in chapter 26 he says not many people will follow few of those that follow a man with a vision yes because everyone's our own Vision but he knows why he's standing up for something are you with me this morning Paul is a great vision foreign you can restrain yourself from things you have to restrain yourself brought you here to do do it yeah to receive now they either do it obtain a corruptable crown but we Paul says an Incorruptible a man that had a Clear Vision of what he wanted

gone to her Homeland but she found something she saw something a vision why are we many of the time still running Brothers I say for myself a vision has to be clear and if God has already told me where to be and what to do your responsibility my responsibility is to do so with all my heart it says what was the Holy Ghost given for that's cool and Naomi in Casa on her road home one of her

Brandon says you're going over there and becoming a Holy Roller are you getting over there to be a holy world from California to follow a man you do what people look as foolish that didn't matter that didn't make any difference on purpose of God to be fulfilled and this morning take this I have the sake of my vision and if God has already revealed it to you and said to you and I know there's more Brothers stand sige keep fighting for our lives oh there's so much God bless you Brothers thank you [Applause] God bless you close vandega if you would uh send greetings to the brothers um let's go to Isaiah 53 verse 10. it's messy and I say yes it's a very familiar verse [Music] I always uh wondered what exactly it meant you know it's the Lord's been good yes that says like this Isaiah 53 10 is yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he had put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand controllers The Book of John yes gospel John chapter 9 verse the words of Jesus Jesus you know when he was fulfilling his purpose here on Earth he says this he says I must work the words of him that sent me this day amen amen the power of a vision you know when we read you know Isaiah 53 10. you know it talks about how the Lord you know how it pleases the Lord to bruise he's talking about Jesus Jesus you know when we read that you think that God is some kind of masochist foreign but just be able to do you know as as the Lord led him amen amen you know and I just start reflecting on this mess I always like to uh reflect on on my personal walk you know I I look back into my childhood days oh you know and just always I've always been that that person that always asks why you know and I'd like to do it when I'm alone you know because I believe that that's when the Lord speaks to me the most oh you know when it's just you and him if you don't do it uh yeah I I just want you to I encourage you you know there's no there's no other Fellowship like the one you have with the Lord you know and you know just talking about his unique walks you know I believe every single one of us here is because you are unique oh there's nobody else like you on the face of this Earth he's like there's nobody else on the face that can do what you can do it's the truth it may not be something great to you may not be able to do what the pastor does but I'll guarantee there's something in here because he was not sent to do this it was yours he didn't have to maybe go through the pain you went through because that was not for him it was for you foreign [Music] you don't appreciate because there's something inside foreign oh so God chooses he chooses you in your walk ain't the things that you went through because there's something special about you especially oh you know I was sitting there thinking you know you were out there in the world foreign and the hell you are going through it because you couldn't stay in the world because there was something foreign a lot of times we're scared to talk about it we're scared to talk about it how about there's people that need here he brought you out of the abuse he brought you out of hell who brought you out of the world because there was something great inside of you Hallelujah greatness Grandesa a lot of times we just have a very shallow thinking um amen amen brother Brandon says this is ambition Hallelujah he says he says you know and reading western story magazines going to picture shows and so forth well I thought the height of my ambition was to be a Cowboys just wait till I get to wear those chaps you know on the boots and the great big hats I had great enthusiasm enthusiasm this was you know before he found out what he was really called foreign work you gotta put in the world what happens is gonna say Everything's Gonna Change but you know everything but you ain't doing nothing do you want to do anything do you know the Lord's gonna just be like well we'll just wait for you you know the Rapture is about to happen but we'll wait for you yes I was just waiting for you oh I guess but I'm lying light all the time if you don't show up right now oh you're gonna start doing things you know one of the things my dad taught me my dad you know he likes to drink alcohol you know and uh even in his drunkenness you know even him being drunk but yeah he was a hard worker he would he would he would drink until four in the morning and I don't know how he did it but he would wake up we had to be work at six he would get up at five o'clock in the morning after drinking all night and he would go to work even under the even even even being drunk I understand you know he couldn't walk very straight but he beat everybody to work you see he was under it he he controlled that full of control you know that they just they just showed okay they're more strong that he had that he had motivation not it wasn't motivation man it was discipline black son Thou shalt not power with an ox and an ass amen yeah you know just read this and you know what's going on here what's happened they're two different things they have a different steps they don't work exactly the same so you can you can't bring them but you know together because you know the other one's wearing the other one down yes one of us a lot of times he's getting dragged because that's what an ox does somebody that works you know that a lot of times you know instead of working up to being an ox you know a lot of times we just like to move forward I don't feel like doing this I don't want to do that nobody has here by force you have a choice that's right you know he's going to keep pulling so either you're gonna pull with us for your purpose [Applause] we gotta work man [Applause] yes sir see in the message images of Christ the worst his greatest desire he said I said save your souls for Christ Christo uh second to last it's all the way down bro Hallelujah says this the C he says the only thing that at my highest ambition and only ambition my mind is to see Jesus Christ glorified I live for that song Our Testimony that 31 years is in the making now I have humbly served him yes if I should live a million years [Music] I had that much like to live I'd want to live every minute of it for him and if I knew I'd be turned down at the end it's such a privilege to live for him I have never found nothing in all the travels of Life compare with the fellowship that we have together when we're alone [Music] it's greater than the love for anything children is the love of Christ you know in closing now I sit there and look I look around I look at the people I look at the youths and I see so much potential potential I see so much there's so much more we can do but nobody can do it for you nobody can make you do something you don't want to do I don't serve a God that's gonna Force anybody he won't Force you know the sad thing is that you know this passion that he had a passion and that's what was his fuel yes he had something to fueled him and I believe that you're so unique that you're so different because in that way you are like him nobody's ever walked how you walked out nobody is gone exactly what you've gone through and he's looking for those people that have that kind of testimony of uniqueness for God even if it's just one I don't care Una let it be just that one the heck is but I'll guarantee you when you get to the Gates of Heaven you just had that one testimony if that's all you had that's all you needed that's all you needed to use the sad thing is that you have a life you have a life and it's it's you know God God bought it he paid the price El president it's just so sad a lot of times did other people care more okay about your life the doctor cares more about your health doctor is that you yourself other people care more about your purpose it's the truth and we don't realize it but there's no discipline but there's no discipline you know why there's no discipline or because there's no passion you know because if there was difference nobody would get in your way nothing could get your way you would you would run right through it that's right you'd run right through it if somebody had passion it was Peter Pedro he was a man with passions but there was another one that had more passion he steps in Jesus's way Jesus you wanted to stop Jesus and Jesus is like get my get behind me Satan Jesus to be able to do something but you hold yourself back from doing it that's what he had he could have pulled out the swords at any moments he could have spoke the world but he was on the ground because he had control control and that's what we need yes regardless of what the world says regardless of the criticism why does he go over there why does he do this but why does he do that the reason he doesn't it's because he's doing all he can and the only difference is he's willing to do [Music] about the great things God has done the things that God has given you the altar's open Brothers [Applause] [Music] and convince me foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign

hospital they scan me again [Music] and after scanometer and they're preparing me [Music] and the doctor shows up [Music] 15 minutes ago we saw the X-ray is and the stroke was very big either and from Fort Collins to here in Denver it diminished just something so small we're prepared to do our work but everything is fine the the blood clot got small is the glory of God it got small good okay I
