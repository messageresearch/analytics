[19:11] ezekiel chapter 37
[19:18] we're going to continue with what our
[19:19] brother where our brother alex left off
[19:21] last week amen
[19:26] [Music]
[19:36] and as much as i wanted to deviate from
[19:39] here
[19:41] bringing me back to this scripture
[19:45] ezekiel 37 1 reads
[19:55] the hand of the lord was upon me and
[19:57] carried me out in the spirit of the lord
[19:59] and set me down in the midst of the
[20:01] valley which was full of bones
[20:15] and caused me to pass by them round
[20:17] about and behold there were very many in
[20:19] the open valley and lo they were very
[20:21] dry
[20:27] they were very dry
[20:31] in other words god wanted him to see
[20:33] that
[20:35] they were very dry
[20:39] now please bow your head and we'll be
[20:40] praying
[20:42] our lord jesus christ
[20:46] your
[21:00] needs of our hearts
[21:04] lord what our soul is needing
[21:07] what our soul is crying for in this
[21:09] morning
[21:11] because if we're here
[21:13] because there's something in our souls
[21:15] that needs you lord
[21:19] may your holy ghost
[21:22] can go through any barrier of our mind
[21:25] of our feelings
[21:38] [Music]
[21:41] help us in this morning
[21:55] the people of israel are preparing
[21:59] to return to the promised land
[22:02] to return to israel
[22:05] return to jerusalem
[22:08] god is preparing for them
[22:10] god
[22:24] what
[22:38] because
[23:06] just
[23:47] was
[24:15] giving them the revival they needed
[24:55] first it says full of bones
[25:11] what happened with this great army
[25:25] these were the bones of the people of
[25:27] israel
[25:29] israel is the type of us
[25:38] because brother branham says the way god
[25:39] works with israel
[26:07] why did they end it
[26:23] how dry these bones were in my mind
[26:33] they like to walk on dry places
[27:04] so
[27:18] the devil will want
[27:54] the least i want is someone to receive
[27:56] me with a dry encouragement
[27:59] i believe barbershops
[28:15] a barber they need to not be a driver
[28:20] customer service is first
[28:23] because no one likes
[28:25] to speak with someone dry yes
[28:28] someone
[28:42] good morning
[29:43] [Music]
[29:53] used to yeah
[29:55] and we learned something
[29:57] one with another in such manner
[30:00] but that doesn't mean we like it
[30:07] [Music]
[31:02] yes brethren
[31:15] doesn't mean that they're full of angers
[31:22] doesn't mean that they're maybe full of
[31:23] sin
[31:29] it's simply a person that doesn't have
[31:31] emotions
[31:35] that doesn't come passionately
[31:40] that's why the lord jesus christ
[31:41] is in revelation did he say they say oh
[31:43] jalapu says
[32:09] demons walk on dry places
[32:26] they had to be in a dry place
[32:30] or i'll say it would have never dried up
[32:34] these bones were dead
[32:38] because they needed water that's right
[33:22] we're lacking water
[33:25] i'm gonna prove it to you
[33:27] matthew fives
[33:29] matthew five
[33:31] mateos
[33:34] matthew five verse one and on
[34:05] are they that you're born
[34:07] repeat lester day that mourn
[34:10] they shall be comforted
[34:16] i'll inherit the earth
[34:46] persecuted
[35:00] blessed are you when men shall revile
[35:02] you and persecute you
[35:07] and shall say all men are evil against
[35:08] you falsely
[35:11] rejoice
[35:41] are the ones who work mercy
[35:54] you haven't been here
[36:09] is
[36:25] the problem is the attacks
[36:28] problem no sauna aren't okay
[36:34] and they persecute you
[36:36] and the contrary
[36:38] you're contrary
[38:08] [Music]
[38:23] there's a soothing of heart tenderness
[38:26] or tenderness of heart
[38:29] your hearts embezzle
[39:08] you have the choice of pouring life on
[39:10] this wound
[39:12] tenderize
[39:27] instead of allowing their hearts so hard
[39:31] letting the problem
[39:34] turn into a problem
[39:37] take advantage of the opportunity
[40:02] tenders tenderizes us
[40:05] and not makes us harder
[40:34] dehydration
[40:50] that tenderness of heart isn't there no
[40:54] there's no humidity
[40:57] when it's dry
[41:00] there's no tears no repentance
[41:05] and we'll speak more on that later
[41:09] when it's dry
[41:13] there's no warmth
[41:16] there's no tenderness
[41:18] when it's
[41:30] is a place that turns dirty very quick
[41:33] very quick
[41:36] you need water to wash off
[41:39] to keep a clean place
[41:42] you need water
[41:45] a place that is
[41:59] everything is
[42:13] when the place is dry
[42:27] because nothing is growing
[42:31] and then it occurs in the body
[42:35] dehydration
[42:38] you need your you know your body needs
[42:40] water
[42:43] if there is one thing that your body
[42:44] needs the most is agua it's water
[42:47] water
[42:50] there's a way that your body cleanses
[42:55] almost all your organs need water
[42:58] because water carries out
[43:02] nutrients
[43:06] and washes away all the filters
[43:09] and begins to bring out
[43:32] [Music]
[43:37] because your organs aren't receiving
[43:38] what they need
[43:42] you feel a thirst
[43:46] your
[43:47] mouth dries out
[43:52] you know you do you notice when
[43:54] someone's dry
[43:55] no salad
[43:57] nothing good comes out of their mouth
[44:02] they come to church
[44:04] there's no worship no i know
[44:18] yes that's right that's right
[44:40] [Music]
[44:48] that thing feels
[45:11] one of the functions for water in our
[45:12] bodies that lubricates our eyes
[45:30] everything
[45:57] [Music]
[46:20] you begin to see dark places
[46:24] lord have mercy
[46:54] without
[47:07] [Music]
[47:36] is
[47:50] sprinkle clean water upon you he said
[47:55] he shall be clean from all your
[47:56] filthiness
[48:00] all your idols will i cleanse you
[48:03] notice the reason many times
[48:07] people are seeking idols
[48:13] because they're not satisfied from god
[48:17] look when jesus christ found the
[48:18] merchant
[48:20] when he met her at the well
[48:23] first thing he tells her
[48:26] if you knew who's speaking to you
[48:30] if you knew god's gift
[48:37] [Music]
[48:59] no one gave her
[49:28] oh
[49:56] where there's water
[50:00] there's not many places
[50:04] they know that animals won't get there
[50:08] and the snakes can survive
[50:24] one more time on the country they like
[50:26] heats
[50:28] snakes like
[50:30] foreign because they're cold-blooded
[50:33] and
[50:34] the heat warms them up
[50:38] but above all they come out in the heat
[50:41] because they made it
[50:43] when it's raining
[50:47] animals don't need to come out of their
[50:49] nests
[50:50] you don't need to leave their house
[51:06] there's forgiveness
[51:20] because
[51:34] oh
[51:39] [Music]
[51:47] god identified this woman's problem
[51:50] god said look
[51:53] the reason you're the way you are
[51:58] it's because you haven't drank of the
[52:00] water
[52:01] the right water
[52:42] the problems
[52:53] [Music]
[53:19] [Music]
[53:21] because there wasn't water in our lives
[53:40] and that
[54:06] for our brothers

[55:10] take away the stony heart out of your
[55:12] flesh
[55:14] let me tell you
[55:17] you want to remove a stony heart

[57:26] the other thanksgiving for him
[57:29] everything that he's giving us
[57:38] once i should
