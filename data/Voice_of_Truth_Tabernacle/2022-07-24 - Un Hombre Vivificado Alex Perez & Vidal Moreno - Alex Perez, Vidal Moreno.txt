trust that is bestowed on us and this morning we'll be speaking with the title a quickened man hombre bibifical a quickened man we're still speaking on restoring the family you know and now we're focusing on the man me objectivo and los proximos minutos [Music] and finish off today first corinthians 15 45 is and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit lord is blessing you may be seated says and our brain and our outlets we're blocked we're clogged continuous brother branham keeps saying al punto says the faith has been clogged up with business affair it it's all become so clogged up with all that god with that until god can't operate through the those channels oh brother saying he got [Music] he lost the spoken word to speak so our wives let me remind you that adam we see then adam went to his wife because when we're speaking of the line or the headship headship of god we see how god these qualities because god's life is zoe manifesto god manifested in adam repito la vida made him a god of descending of the structure that god has placed because we think it is patronus just because what does zoe mean god's own life for passed from death unto life man he was told since the beginning if he ever ate of that tree he would die not many people say death but he didn't die let me tell you he lost eternal life he didn't have everlasting life shall all be made alive so the channel of life was broken as soon as adam decides to sin el canal de la remember the life is so let's return number one adam had eternal life and the woman comes from adam and when they say he decided before the foundation of the world [Music] [Music] [Applause] is returns back into your blood cell and gives you the same life la misma in greek words go look it up and the greek word eternal means they come from the word zoe life of god himself and if jesus through his death enter their own life because god without foreign [Applause] so the bible says but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god patron father they're structured the head of christ christ that's how the blood flows stings without blood there's no life let me tell you this is the spiritual the spiritual iglesia mismatch the church by itself does not have life [Music] through the right channels the sister is missing her husband so what's next if the man is missing there's chris christ means the anointing there's an anointing in this church cause my attention the simple fact that is faith covers those sons the blood is tremendous when i understand this are [Music] designed to bring us life to bring that life running in the blood are you with me juan diaz binti says john 10 26 yeah i like what it says but i want you to take this it's important to be understanding these things repeat with me the man i have a leader we have a leader leader we have john 10 26. i love him grace but you believe not jesus jesus says you don't believe me because he sets an example of a good shepherd green and he says you don't believe me this morning how many do you believe do you really believe because if you believe right now i say for myself i hear him but i don't hear him because i'm not believing what he's talking about that's our mistake jesus says the shepherd jesus says i give them eternal life is that my own revelation but i see how the transmitted to me i need a baby or the woman obey my husband that's the way the line runs dios gaar christo christ the man and i want there god bless you [Applause] god bless everyone if you would just open your bibles up to ephesians chapter 2 verse 1. and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins remember our title is the quickening power matthew 8 22 reads like this but jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury the dead jesus amen man you know when we look into the bible and uh you know i was just kind of looking up uh the definition of what it is to be uh quickened significant and uh you know some of the terms that come up some of the synonyms that come up it's uh to stimulate to excite emotional uh to stir up revolution to aroused uh to awaken uh to activate activar uh to um inspire inspire uh to refresh refresh uh to strengthen is to have a life by este nervida amen a man that's that's what brother branham says and you know speaking on the importance of a man you know especially in the home especially and uh you know that's that's basically you know how how it ends up being that way you know because uh if if the devil wants to take somebody out in the home uh you know that's that's why the homes fall apart because the man is supposed to be the strong ones he's supposed to be firm he's supposed to tend to stand true uh you know first of all to god i like what brother tito says you know that's that's his first colleague a lot of men they get upset perhaps you know when the women goes to the pastor well she wouldn't be going to the pastor if you did your job you know and that's the truth yes you know it goes from here back to that way you know if if uh that's just the way it is but when we talk about about quickening to be a quickens uh we have to understand that you know when the fall came he couldn't quicken himself i know [Music] you know there was something else he was lacking and they could only come from one person he's telling his disciples he says follow me man and let the dead bury the dead you see what he says he's letting him know hello that if you go do these other things he was the only one oh that could bring you life that could help you quickly that could help you quicken other people that's the truth yes the best way to do it if you want to inspire someone [Music] he says now when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired words since the two inspirations together gives a result amazing juntas produced queisteres mismo saint speeding it says it takes your inspiration with uh the word is already inspired what we need today oh good mark oh not way out no more no way at that that's not something that they will never forget oh you follow jesus that's what he was telling us that you want to quicken a lot of times you know they like to consider themselves you know christians christianity because they go to church why not like you know they sit on the pews and you'll never know that they were really there that's what he says he says because they've and that's the truth yes is [Music] moses he picked up that dry stick el record and that stick wasn't nothing unless moses picked it up we are muertas you know james chapter 8 santiago ocho i don't have i don't have it but i'm going to go to it in james chapter 2. there's it says even so faith yes if it has not works is dead being alone it's dead es muertos but there's nothing to it uh if it's alone but it has to be quick you know i always had that desire oh you know of of of a man to come and let me know this [Applause] let me know as it may sound eastern i believed it i believed it but unfortunately you see we're always another it just it doesn't have life in it it's implemented either i wonder you know if that's not the case in many churches just a body yeah solo equipped with motionless okay taste this food can you push somebody down there you can get excited now when i hear god was there yourself he quickens you love evie through a time of suffering through the time of pain through the time of poverty it don't matter no importa that don't matter because you're quickened and you're alive and you may not have a whole lot of mucho oh but if you have jesus you just have words of inspiration dr davis dr davis you know he calls them to his house hello i don't want to talk to you oh you know in my house you know i'm i'm i believe in that brother brandon was like man he's going to let me know how great of a job and you know i bet he went in there pretty excited and then brother branham asks how did i do dr david davis dr davis he says it was the rottenness i ever heard he was like what they say but yeah that's the worst i ever heard he said he said brother davis everybody was crying and then brother brother davis tells him he says yes he's like they cry your funerals he says he says you talked about some others that had done gone on or something like this and got everybody to crying he says yes paul in the book of first corinthians chapter 16. paulo and primarily he tells the corinthians this is corinthians he says stand fast in the face i start filming equate you like me or be strong yes is [Music] el say turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity apart and quicken me a viva man in the way and to camino we need to be quickened [Music] you may not have a whole lot of other things but he gives you quickening power for that uh to make a mark to make a mark in the lives of the children to make a mark in the life of your brother to the housewives alas to make a mark by the harunawaya and i don't i think that's a great thing and i think that that's my desire yes it's me the cell i believe it's the desire [Music] uh to just rely on on just somebody else persona you know what times get hard no they get hurt at home they get hard at work as great as moses was san grande he became discouraged say this anymore i believe that jesus himself i believe that he went through a time of discouragement he asked the disciples to pray i believe that there's gonna be a time in your life oh you is [Music] is [Music]
