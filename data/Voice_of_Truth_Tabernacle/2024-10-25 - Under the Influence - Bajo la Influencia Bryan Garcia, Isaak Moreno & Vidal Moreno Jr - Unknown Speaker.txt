ministers that will be up here in this evening Lord we just ask for your blessing in this evening Lord Touch My Heart Lord father touch each and every one of everybody's heart in this evening Lord Lord we we thank you for everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I was uh I'm not a preacher oh you you may be seated um I was never I never preached before I've shared testimony and I always felt like preaching was not my thing and before moving to Colorado and brother Tito told me he said get ready you're going to you're going to share one day and I I got scared from that point I was probably thinking about stay in California but I didn't want to be scared anymore amen amen I like the verse that we read right now talks about being in one Accord yeah I started um start studying the Bible and I started to ask myself what is to be in one Accord and um a lot of brothers were telling me it's to be together to be United to be United in harmony amen just like the scripture was talking about that they were all United they were in one Accord in one place amen amen that's how we should be in this evening we should be in one Accord amen I know it's not it's not easy it's tough Nobody's Perfect everybody has mistakes sometimes um these people they let they let these evil spirits come between them and what does that produce it doesn't it produces not to be in unity to not be in Fellowship amen amen we have to be in Fellowship we have to love one another I you might have some beef with someone you you may not like your sister you may not like your brother but you still got to love him amen you got to if you're in this place you got to love your brother and sister sometimes I fail in that but I want to be better I want to love you I want to love each and every one of you in this I don't like to have problems with anybody and it's hard but I love you because I want to be in unity in harmony I want to have that Fellowship talking to to heido he told me something very very important said we can't be in one Accord if two are not in Fellowship two are in disagreement we can't be in that Fellowship um I keep when when I first moved here they kept asking me the same question why did why did you move to Fort Collins fors why did you come over here and um I found my answer this week studying this of Fellowship I started to when I first began to come here I started to see that Fellowship in this church that beautiful unity and Harmony how United the brothers were how United the youth were and they were all United in Harmony and because of that during the services I was able to I experience God in this place love in this place that that's what we got to keep doing we all got to be in harmony to be able to feel God's presence to receive the ghost I didn't finish reading the scripture like we're in Acts 4 Acts 2 verse four and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance that's something isn't that something beautiful man it I just it's it's good to be part of of of the love of Christ I like when when they were preaching last Sunday brotherto and brother they said I don't want to belong to a church I don't want to belong to Voice of Truth I want to belong to Jesus Christ I want to belong belong to the love of Jesus I want to be able to project that love it it it's it's hard where where I come from it was very hard for me to feel that way to feel that love um sometimes I didn't even go to church and um I didn't feel part of a of a community didn't feel part of a of a United family and I didn't I didn't feel God's love love in that moment and I told my parents I said I think I'm gonna move because if I continue this way I'll probably get lost I'll probably go a different route I'll probably end up in the streets I don't want to end up like that I want to end up in in the love of Jesus Christ that's where I want to be part of and it's that's that's the beauty about having that fellowship with one another become part of something you're part of a family you should be happy that you're family you should be happy that you're part of the love of Jesus Christ we can live a life when Jesus Christ is in our hearts if you allow Jesus to be in your heart you can become of that family that Fellowship in one Accord it's um it's what I was studying this week and um one day that I got a day off I went up to I went up I went hiking to the mountains and I I I prayed I said Lord what's your purpose with me what am I doing here what what do you want me to be what do you want me to become I want you to guide me Lord in that moment I broke down I said Lord I just want to give my life to you I want you to guide me I want you to use me just Touch My Heart Lord and reading this theme I was able to understand that that's the beauty this place being in this family I don't practice it that much but I don't say I love you to my parents but I want to change that I want to say I love you dad I love you Mom I love you brother but we should practice that with each and every one of us brother in Christ we should say I love you brother I love you sister you should not hate your brother you're because you don't know what could happen the next day you might lose that person you won't be able to say I'm sorry so I hope in this night you can receive that love from one brother to all the youth to all the youth that you can practice saying I love you to your sister I love you to your brother and just project God's love and harmony to be in one Accord and receive of God that's why I chose to move to be in this place with you I I told this to brotherto when I um when I was thinking about moving here that I I I just want to change my life I don't want to be the same anymore I don't want to be scared I don't want to be nervous I just want I just want to be one with God I want be in God's in God's hands I just want to be filled with the Holy Ghost if you can please stand that's all I have for this moment tell you that I love you I want to thank each and every one of you for making me feel at home you you are very special I hope you know that and I hope you know that that we love you that I love you that you can project that love of God God bless you amen amen amen bless our brother Brian we love to have him here amen you see something that brother Brian said and you may take your seats you said you see he said I don't like to have any problems with anybody you see but tonight we're going to have some problems with the devil okay we're going to have church today hope you guys came prepared to receive something to open your hearts and to really just trust in the Lord tonight you see our title for tonight is under the influence Inu and as a subtitle I put a steady hand for a sudden blessing amen uh sorry now you're okay um if we could go to acts uh verse one un sorry Acts chapter one uh verse S it says like this and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the season which the father has put in his own power you see what I want to talk about tonight is about waiting you see we see the disciples and the one the 120 that were in the upper room brother brandom says they were up there for 10 days before the Holy Ghost came down you see a lot of the times we're too focused on ourselves you see I was asking around why is it a lot of the [Music] times I asked around to other people why is it a lot of times we can't wait uh some people told me we don't have patience some told me they we don't have love others told me we're selfish other others told me that we just want everything in our own [Music] time you see a lot of the times we wait for many things in this world you see we wait in lines uh to get our food uh we wait at grocery stores those are little things that we wait for then there's bigger things when we're waiting for a doctor to tell us our results you see a lot of people can't wait a lot of the times it's because we're too aware of time you see myself I can't wait a lot of the times because I'm too aware of what's going on around me I'm too aware that I want everything now you see but we see the disciples here in verse in verse 14 of Acts one it says they all these all continue with one Accord in prayer and supplication and supplication means the action of asking or begging for something earnestly or humbly with the woman and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his Brethren and then in the next verse it says and then the and those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples the number of names altogether were about 120 you see we see them in other words they were crying out they weren't just there oh Lord I want the Holy Ghost oh Lord whenever you give it to me see a lot of the times you know we go out into the world you know myself I might be at work talking about certain things around my co-workers that might not be right you know you might be doing things with your friends that aren't right listening to worldly music let's get personal tonight I struggle with worldly music a lot of the times it's hard you know you you can't let it go you like the beat but a lot of the times you know like these disciples here we see that they were waiting earnestly they were pleading out they were crying out to him saying Lord come to us Lord we want your Holy Ghost we need it now no it doesn't say exactly those words but that's what what I believe they were saying you say they were crying out for it what are you crying out for tonight what are you waiting for what is your goal is your goal just to be here at church and sit on the Pew just to come to the Altar and cry here and there just to say I'm a Christian you see a lot of the times even you know when you're out there in the world just to tell let people tell you oh you're different that's nothing anymore brother there's a lot of people that are different out there there's a lot of people that you could say they're different living better than me doing better things than me so what does that have to do with people telling you that is that all we want you see I was reading and I read something and I really liked it now I'm smiling a lot because I'm I'm excited I don't know if you guys are but I'm excited you know recently I've been getting into the word more listening to a message during my lunchtime at work and it's been helping me a lot but anyways it says what we experienced suddenly was usually engineered steadily so what I mean by this is behinds most things that happen quickly before our eyes it was consistency that enabled us or that enabled it to happen that we didn't see you see a lot of the times God is working behind the scenes see a lot of times when we're struggling when we can't get out of our Temptations when I can't stop listening to music when I can't stop drinking or doing drugs or watching pornography or being alone or always saying that I'm failing because a lot of times we put ourselves down as well and that's not of God or a lot of times we struggling with our sickness when we don't see God moving and we just want to give up God is working behind the scenes you see these disciples were praying you see I bet they were struggling as well I bet the devil was attacking them in their mind saying just get up and leave why are you still here why are you still coming to church why do you still come to Friday services you're still the same you got baptized and you still struggle you talk about the word You Preach you play music you try to help others but when you're alone in your own room you're still struggling why don't you just give up why don't you just stop all this Jesus stuff and finish it and just go out into the world you see a lot of the times God wants us to have steady hands to have a steady heart to have a steady mind to have steady feet because let me tell you these 120 they had to be steady they couldn't receive something so strong because it was going to blow them away they weren't going to know what to do with it you see a lot of times God tells us son let's walk slowly son let me show you just wait showing us Little Things by little you see you know a lot of the times you think God's not watching you see a lot of times you know there's a couple people here with businesses a lot of the times you think oh I'm GNA get there one day they think it's just gonna happen like that suddenly but if you ask them what did it take to get from where you're at right now what battles did you have to go through what struggles did you have to go through to build such a good business I bet you a lot of them won't tell you that it just happened out of nowhere you see a lot of them are going to tell you they went through stuff they maybe didn't have money at times to Fe their own families they maybe struggled waned to give up that's how we are a lot of times that's how I am I want to give up I want to say Lord I can't no more it's been too long I can't wait for your Holy Spirit no more but you see a lot of people once you receive what you have a lot of people come to you and they tell you oh that happen so quick you got rid of your your sickness so quick you're healed now oh you got rid of that Temptation so quick you got rid of this and that how do you love your brother in so much how are you so United now you see Peter 50 days before this Pentecost he was denying Jesus then 50 days later he was preaching about Pentecost and he seen 3,000 converted you see a lot of people will tell you that but they don't know what you went through behind the scenes they don't see how you cried they don't see what it cost you really what it cost you they don't see what you went through they don't see how you just wanted to fail you just wanted to give up how you wanted to just fail God how it was so painful to dig up those roots that you had to dig up to let go you see because it's hard it's hard to wait it's not easy but what happens when you wait people are going to think you're crazy you see I'm not going to read the verse because I'm running out of time but it says later on in this chapter that they thought they were drunk on new wine and oh but when you receive the Holy Ghost when you receive something it's going to stir up inside of you you're going to look drunk to everyone you're going to look crazy you're going to look like you're out of control no one's going to be able to control you anymore if we could go to proverbs 31 chapter 13 you see our our pastor was preaching about this Sunday he shared this with me in the back and I really liked it and it says like this she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with their hands she is like the mer Merchant chips she bringeth her food from afar now the pastor really opened up my mind here so she brings her food from afar so we see here that she's working all time before so she doesn't just work on Friday when we come to service she doesn't just work on Sunday or Wednesday No but she's working Monday she working Tuesday she's working Thursday she's working Saturday she's working every day asking God renew me Lord I can't do this on my own anymore I need you I've been waiting so long but I watch your spirit and no matter how long no matter how long it takes I'm going to wait for your Holy Ghost to come down and fill me amen amen I want to read a quote before I finish and it's in the message God keeps his word and it says like this see they went up there how long to wait how long two days five days asking asking until what happen happened they was all in one place one Accord he says it again one Accord they wasn't arguing I'm a Pharisee no it'll never come on a group like that not a bit never come they're just waiting they were brothers and sisters together wom and there with them oh don't you don't you love that all together in one Accord they were brother they were all up there for 10 days waiting waiting one Accord reading the Bible maybe someone stand up and preaching like I've just done saying the blessing of God has been promised oh don't you love God's God's word has already been promised amen now now God said he'd pour out the Holy Ghost Joel said he would do it and we're waiting for the word to be fulfilled and then he asked and then he asked this oh my so are you doing that tonight waiting for the word to be fulfilled how that fire struck my heart waiting in the upper room will never happened yesterday and it it will today or if it don't today it will tomorrow oh don't you love that if it won't happen tomorrow if it won't happen today it has to happen because it promised you see we're going to wait now the word said so and every spot of Jesus Jesus's life was was a fulfilling of the that word he told us to wait here before we went to preach the gospel all the way around the world and that every creature on the Earth Earth hear the gospel before we started we were to wait here we were to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and uh brother could come up so I ask you tonight what are you waiting for tonight are you going to wait for your Pentecost or you just going to give up and let the devil take [Music] over I challenge you tonight youth give them your all pray earnestly don't give up it's not time to give up we're getting so close give me your all I know it's hard I struggle I'm part of you guys I know what it is to struggle I know how it is out there sometimes you want to drink you want to go with your friends out there and go party there's a lot of things that you want to do but if you wait there's a better reward at the end you just wait God bless you [Applause] God bless everyone it's good to be in the house of the Lord uh I'm just going to read acts two verse one quickly it reads like this and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place uh you know uh when uh when I was uh when I was younger uh I uh I had I had the the I think it's a it was a privilege maybe some of you won't but uh I was like uh I was like 19 years old 18 uh I uh I got to work in the mountains quite a bit and uh what one of the one of the things that I I I thought I was I thought I was the coolest the coolest young person in the world uh that I would I would uh I would they they would allow us to go into the helicopters we would uh we we'd get in helicopters and uh and we the reason we'd get in there was because we'd have to go to remote areas and uh but for the helicopter to uh to land um then uh there had to be a there had to be a landing strip uh so so all the obstructions uh they had to be had to be removed uh so the helicopter could land uh and uh you know uh when we uh when we see where um where these uh the 120 were gathered uh they were gathered in the upper room uh you know and uh so what I'm getting at is this uh that there had to be a preparation you know in order for Pentecost to fully come and uh you know when we uh look at the apostles and uh in John chapter 20 of verse 19 uh it reads like this it says then the same day at evening uh being the first day of the week it says when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in their midst and said unto them peace be unto you so these same uh these same the same Peter that was in the upper room and the rest of the Apostles there was at one time when they were scared at one point they were scared uh the the what I'm getting at is is is this is that these these Apostles uh they weren't always they weren't always uh they weren't always you know um um courageous but but you know what what what what it was was this is that God had to show them that how weak they were oh without him because as soon as Jesus comes off the sea they realized how how little they can do and how small we are you see it was it was it was an influence of fear uh that took them to have the fear and go hide and lock the door and and and and and run from these Jews you see but but but God is not a god of fear I have a God that's not scared of anybody he's not scared of anything but what Peter had to do and not only Peter but anybody else that wanted the promise what they had to do was to begin to remove every obstacle [Applause] obstruction anything that in their lives that was hindering for the Holy Ghost to come down because I most certainly believe that the Holy Ghost he wants to land he wants to land somewhere he wants to land in the hearts of his people he cannot land or where there is filth where there is sin where there where there are these the the evil things where he cannot land so so Peter and the Apostles of what they did was they began to prepare amen amen I I I want to read John 20 verse 21 and 22 it says then Jesus said to them again peace be unto you it says as my father had sent me even so I send you and when he had said this it says he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the holy ghost that that's what he told them uh but as Isaac was saying he sends them to Jerusalem and he tells them to wait there for until they were filled from from the power from on high and and the reason it was 10 days because Jesus had spent 40 days with the apostles so in order for there to be a Pentecost there had to be 10 more days for there to be Pentecost because we know that throughout the Bible that that 50 means Pentecost it was it was the it was the feast of the first fruits amen amen and that's what they were preparing for but you know the thing of it is it's not as easy as you think because a birth is painful you see and so this this first church was about to be born that they were about to be born so when something is born you know there's growing pain you see and that's that's what the church is going through you see because I believe I serve a God that does not change you see and if they had to go through Growing Pains back there back then then we have to go through them now brother Bram says this he says oh God wants to restore the faith that was once delivered to the Saints you say brother brandham is that the faith he says don't take the Methodist ritual the Baptist ritual or Pentecost ritual it says take the Bible he says let's see what they did he say they were all in the upper room with one Accord and suddenly the same rushing wind came from [Applause] heaven filled all the house where they were sitting he says well you say I don't know whether to do this or not if I go outside they'll make fun of me if I say anything well they couldn't [Music] have he says no sir he says the Holy Ghost met them he says that bunch of little [Applause] cowards I said that's what brother Bram said before they got the Holy Ghost he says that these apostles were cowards I wonder you know if if if uh we haven't if we can't see ourselves there because before you get the Holy Ghost you know sometimes we think we're ready sometimes we think we're ready for the Holy Ghost oh but we don't know what comes with this we don't know what what we don't know the responsibility we don't we don't we we want the Holy Ghost but we don't want to go through the process you see because things look easy when when when you're watching somebody Prosper but if you could only see what they go through but before they get there or you might think twice you see and people sometimes they're just like give it to me you see but God doesn't want you to fail you see God could have gave the the the apostles the Holy Ghost right there and there but he told them he said wait you see waiting and nowadays it's not easy especially in the time we're living we want things right now instant gratification that's what we want you see but God doesn't change you see he doesn't change uh you know to to to conform to you that's not the way God works I have a God that does not change he'll never change his program his program is his word amen amen the thing of it is is this is that you have to adapt to this word we have to go back brother brandham says this he says we have to go back to the Bible [Applause] we have to go back to the foundation you know when Peter had fear that's because he did not have love because if he had love the Bible says that that love that cast out all fear you see so when we believe God when we love God in perfect love but then all fear is gone you see the influence changes I read something here a while back the fruits of the spirit Galatians 5:23 it says this the first fruit of the spirit is love you see if you don't have love you can't have any of the rest you cannot have joy you cannot have peace you cannot have Longs suffering you cannot have Temperance patience kindness you can't have none of it if you don't have love so before the before you can get the Holy Ghost you got to love you have to love what do you have to if God tells you to wait you have to love to wait I don't hear a lot of amens well you know that's what he tells you to do his program is not going to change because just you didn't say Amen whether you agree or not that's the Bible you see he has them waiting but not only does he have them waiting uh but he has them to go to Jerusalem you see he didn't just say go to church but because the Bible says they were in one Accord they were they were in one mind one heart I believe it was one spirit amen amen and when he and when we when we look at those things you see I believe he was talking about a Unity uh because when when we when we are united you see we are we are in one Accord we are in one Spirit we are glorifying one God all of our glory is for God amen amen it was just one but when you are obedient because he tells he tells him to go somewhere brother Bram says this it says the perfect obedience it says it gives you the right to the Token amen that that's what brother bam said so they were there I believe they were waiting but I I don't believe that they weren't doing anything the Bible says they were in the upper room they were in prayer and in supplication that's what they were doing but they were doing something see they were waiting and they were working you see because when you wait you still got to work you see we're going towards something many people they think that they don't have to do anything and and that it's just GNA it's just going to happen that it's just going to come down you see God don't work like that you do everything that you can do you do everything God tells you to do and when you cannot do anything else I believe that God will do what you cannot do God will fill you with his Spirit he will come down and it will not be confined to a church building it will not be confined to this wall but I believe I have a God that when he comes down it will be an outpouring because when they got filled everybody knew about it everybody heard about it they weren't cowards anymore they were testifying they became true witnesses to the point that the people thought that they were drunk they weren't ashamed anymore they weren't running from anybody but I believe that God was so happy because this was the moment this was the time when the First Church of God had life that this is when it was born Jesus breathed the breath of life not just on the apostles but on everybody that was in that room you see it wasn't just not going to be just for brother Tito or the people that preach but if you want it or you can have it it can be for you it could be for anybody that wants it amen and I believe that the same God that came down with the same power with the same Russian Mighty Wind will come the same way it'll be the same power it won't be any different God does not give you something diluted he will not he will not delude something and then give it to his church it'll be the same power it will be the same God that will fill you the same one that filled Peter I will fill you it may be just a drop but I believe that that little drop is all power it's all power in closing when God when God fills this room you see because before this before the filling of the Holy Ghost in the Old Testament you see God would come down but then he would leave again he would come down on a prophet he would come down on the judges but then he would leave again because there was no dwelling place for him there was no dwelling place for him at the time oh because the Lamb of God which was Jesus Christ he had to come in order for that to take place that's what I believe and so when and when Jesus dies and our sins are forgiven and he he does away with all sin he does away with it all amen because I believe that's what Jesus di you see he finished off sin but the thing of it is the greatest thing after the death of Jesus was the birth of the church because that is when Jesus was able to reunite out with his children again but they didn't have to be scared anymore they didn't have to run anymore but because now God was going to be in them he was going to be in his church he was going to be in his children that's what it was it was the perfect Unity between God and man once again god with man I believe that do you believe that you can have it all you have to do is open your heart he wants to dwell in you that that's where his dwelling place is that is where his throne is it's in the heart of man that's all I have brothers God bless [Music] you Hallelujah Glon and Glory [Music] Hallelujah [Music] glor for [Music] andee [Music] [Music]
