[24:26] in chapter two
[24:29] you know what Christmas is about
[24:32] um
[24:38] it's about him
[24:41] and this morning
[24:43] we come foreign
[25:05] hands our mouth
[25:07] amen amen
[25:10] only four five believe it that's more
[25:13] than enough
[25:16] I came for Him
[25:19] Luke chapter 2 verse
[25:29] and it came to pass in those days uh
[25:32] there went out a decree from Caesar
[25:34] Augustus that all the world should be
[25:36] taxed
[25:42] and this taxing was first made by
[25:44] cyrenius was governor of Syria
[25:50] and all went to be taxed everyone into
[25:52] his own City
[26:03] and Joseph also went off From Galilee
[26:05] out of the city of Nazareth into Jude
[26:07] unto the city of David which is called
[26:09] Bethlehem because he was of the house
[26:11] and lineage of David
[26:14] parakeets
[26:20] to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife
[26:23] being great with child yes
[26:29] and so it was that while they were there
[26:31] the days were accomplished that she
[26:33] should be delivered
[26:43] and she brought forth her firstborn son
[26:45] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[26:47] laid him in a Manger because there was
[26:49] no room for
[26:51] themes
[26:56] and they were in the same country
[26:58] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[27:00] watch over their flock by night yeah
[27:06] [Music]
[27:10] and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon
[27:13] them and the glory three of the Lord
[27:15] Shone round about them and they were
[27:17] sore afraid
[27:24] and the angel said unto them fear not
[27:27] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[27:28] great joy which shall be good to our
[27:30] people
[27:35] is Born the day in the city of David a
[27:38] savior which is Christ the lord
[27:46] and there shall be a sign unto you you
[27:48] shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling
[27:50] clothes lying in a Manger
[27:54] multitude
[27:59] and suddenly there was a there was with
[28:01] the angel a multitude of the Heavenly
[28:03] hosts praising God and saying Glory
[28:06] adios
[28:11] glory to God in the highest and on the
[28:13] earth peace Good Will toward men amen
[28:17] amen let us pray foreign
[29:39] you may be seated foreign
[30:13] Romans 5 8 says
[30:17] what Romans 5 8 says
[30:24] well God commandeth his love toward
[30:29] Usos
[30:36] now there's a reason why he says command
[30:38] This is
[30:40] Love toward us
[30:45] that while he were yet sinners Christ
[30:47] died for us
[30:48] we are not the scriptures
[30:54] for God so loved the world
[30:57] que mando
[31:00] they sent an angel to speak to us of him
[31:04] that I cannot no right
[31:07] it says that he gave him
[31:11] he showed his love
[31:15] that's what we want to speak of this
[31:17] morning
[31:19] but the title is actually show your love
[31:23] cantamos cantos we sing songs all the
[31:27] time
[31:28] about going to heaven
[31:32] if I ask you how many want to go to
[31:34] heaven
[31:35] um
[31:42] and we speak about going to heaven and
[31:45] one day we'll depart to him
[31:48] for as much as we strive to go to heaven
[31:53] God strives to come to Earth
[31:57] he's not so weird of us going to
[32:03] he's interested in having coming to us
[32:10] the Lord told his disciples
[32:13] When you pray pray this way
[32:25] the same Bible shows
[32:38] that's what happened the first Christmas
[32:42] Los Angeles
[32:59] landed on earth
[33:01] when Jesus Christ
[33:04] was born in that Manger
[33:09] Santos
[35:07] well planned foreign
[35:10] [Applause]
[36:40] [Music]
[36:54] that showed his love
[37:50] so he said I can only give them words
[37:55] show his
[38:56] foreign
[40:26] the life
[40:29] tell me those 30 years weren't important
[40:34] it was 30 years of living the life
[40:39] without no one knowing who he was
[40:48] he should a gift
[40:49] we know
[40:52] he spoke about this yeah
[40:58] they followed his parents
[41:01] that God gave him as tutors
[41:11] with no interest
[41:14] of showing a public Ministry
[41:18] how tremendous
[41:24] I want to tell you this
[41:27] is
[41:29] love is not love unless it is shown
[41:35] Mark 12 30 says
[41:47] and with all thy strength
[41:50] it speaks
[41:52] of a complete love
[41:55] a complete love
[41:58] I want to tell you that the true love is
[42:01] a complete love
[42:04] a real love
[42:08] I'll give you this but not this part of
[42:11] myself
[42:14] I'm going to think about you but I won't
[42:17] do anything for you
[42:19] God says if you're going to love me
[42:25] I want you to love me with everything
[42:28] that's in you
[42:29] and everything that's outside
[42:39] the Bible says he wants our streets
[42:49] people think they can come to church
[42:53] simply come and listen yeah
[43:27] not enough
[43:30] if you in the beginning
[43:32] do it that's fine
[43:42] I love God
[43:46] God
[45:10] that should be
[45:16] to our Lord
[45:21] I love you God I love you
[45:24] no one saw me
[45:28] that's the way we are people that don't
[45:32] show our love
[45:34] that's true
[45:36] we're secret Believers many times
[45:41] God didn't make us
[45:45] the Bible says
[46:09] I am doubt that our Christians
[46:13] always
[46:48] foreign
[47:25] oh I just shown
[47:28] man amen
[47:31] if not heaven is over there and you're
[47:34] here
[47:35] but God wants heaven to be here
[47:42] the kingdom of God shine
[48:10] my hands
[48:16] ome what if your wife husband told you
[48:18] yeah esposo
[48:22] I gave you my heart
[48:24] but the rest is belongs to me let's pay
[48:29] this don't wait
[48:33] for no effort
[48:35] I'm only going to be
[48:38] loving you at a distance
[48:42] I heard a story
[48:45] about a man they say
[48:49] he loved his wife so much
[48:51] but he crossed the mountains for him
[48:55] that traveled the Seas
[49:02] he spent years
[49:05] simply escribiendo writing de Legos from
[49:09] afar cartas letters to her
[49:19] he spent his time in the mountains and
[49:21] in the seas
[49:26] sometimes we think we're showing our
[49:28] love
[49:29] but it's a distant love
[49:33] God did not love us long distance
[49:51] long distance
[49:54] right
[50:07] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[50:11] repeat all
[50:15] Allah
[50:25] this is the first
[50:27] Commandments
[50:30] Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor
[50:33] there is none other commandment greater
[50:36] than these
[50:38] as we fulfill these two commands we
[50:41] fulfill everything
[50:44] as long as we pay
[50:47] we pay all the debts
[50:52] you pay everything off
[51:13] [Music]
[51:25] don't do that
[52:01] this is the way you love him
[52:04] now there are different ways
[52:07] but we get stuck in one
[52:12] yes speaking our love is part of it
[52:16] they should use our mouths
[52:19] we should use our mouth
[52:48] less how much they love their neighbor
[53:22] God is your savior
[53:51] God has given us many gifts
[53:58] foreign
[54:06] [Applause]

[55:28] with her mouth
[55:45] [Music]
[56:27] he's my everything
[56:36] uh appreciate it amen
[56:40] the other way of showing our love is
[56:43] through sacrifice
[56:47] through service and sacrifice
[56:52] we don't like that one a lot this is
[56:58] what Brandon says we preach an easy
[57:00] gospel

[58:28] that cannot be denied
[58:32] sacrifice and service
[58:36] I won't give anything to the Lord that
[58:38] doesn't cost me anything
[58:41] give him things that cost us little
[58:45] sacrifice
[59:02] but we want to give him the easiest

[1:09:19] the children of God
[1:09:24] for we know that the whole creation
[1:09:27] paints together until now
[1:09:36] is
[1:09:40] not only they but ourselves also which
[1:09:42] have the first fruits of the spirit even
[1:09:44] we ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:09:46] waiting for the adoption to win with the
[1:09:47] Redemption of our bodies
[1:09:51] how sad it would be to be pregnant all
[1:09:53] the time
[1:09:56] a woman that's pregnant I believe it's
[1:09:58] one of the hardest things
[1:10:00] but what if she was always
[1:10:02] and never gave birth
[1:10:05] nine months passed didn't give birth
[1:10:12] 11 12 13
[1:10:15] 14.
[1:10:18] I think it's elephants that have a uh
[1:10:21] they're pregnant for two years or
[1:10:22] something
[1:10:24] foreign
[1:11:07] birth pains our whole life
[1:11:13] I'm speaking to more mature people now
[1:11:17] forgive me if you're a visit but we can
[1:11:21] all learn from this
[1:11:24] sometimes we also are visitors for a
[1:11:26] long time
[1:11:28] when we should get it when we should say
[1:11:31] Lord now for me too much for me
[1:11:35] so much
[1:11:52] I have no more
[1:11:55] I'm over it Hallelujah

[2:03:09] on this last trip to urapan
[2:03:11] um

[2:03:37] when someone is

[2:03:47] understand or take interest
[2:03:50] my desire as a pastor
[2:03:52] for this church
[2:03:55] for the flock of this
[2:03:59] heard of dessert
