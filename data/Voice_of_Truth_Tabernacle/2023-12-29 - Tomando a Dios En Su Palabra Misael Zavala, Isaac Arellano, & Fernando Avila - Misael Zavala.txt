ISE God bless you Brothers you please follow me Isaiah 4:17 I mean 714 we send greetings to our brothers in our brothers in California and all those who watch us through the internet Isaiah 7 verse 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and and shall call his name Emanuel give thanks to God for the opportunity and our pastor if we could please bow our heads Celestial father Lord give you thanks this day for giving us the opport opportunity to be here in your temple Lord we ask for your direction of your help and your holy spirit so you can help us in this service as much as the preachers the interpreters but overall the audience they can receive something take home this night we give you thanks for everything in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated we're speaking on Mary it started about eight days ago the they did a very good job in the play We congratulate everyone Maria Mary an extraordinary woman what can we see from her something that the Jews could not they had the scripture they had the Torah and they would search in the scriptures but the word that God blinded did their spiritual sight and they could not see what would happened with Mary even if the scriptures talked about her even Isaiah 96 prpe and it says For unto us a child is born and unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be one called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace they were not waiting for God to come in the form of a baby [Music] why because it wasn't the first time God would come in flesh it wasn't the first time it would happen with Abraham God made a body and other two bodies for his two accp angels and what the Jews waited for was a man a flesh and bow and a leader well where they errored was was in Genesis 3:15 it says and I will put in enmity between between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so what seed the woman does not have a seed the seed comes from man the woman is the camp where the Harvest is taken so what seed it was referring to the seed of the Lord Jesus Christ he was referring to Mary the woman of course he has a dou it's also referring to the church brother Bram says preached in 1965 the seed shall not be air with the shook notice it shall be light about the evening time the true seed come forth from Mary but it was not her seed it was a promise it was the promise of God and she said behold the handmade of the Lord the carriers of life was the woman Hagar had to receive it in a perverted way Sarah doubted the thing and brought it just through natural seed sexual desire but married without any sex at all believed the word and the Word was made flesh now it's saying that promise was fulfilled because she believed it some believing in the promises of God coming it's something to contemplate about you start meditating on the word start to grab onto his promises how many promises did you obtain this year better yet said how many did you obtain because if you can't believe you can't obtain it's something mental and in the end you you delusion yourself yourself because you don't obtain anything you have to exercise your faith Luke 126 it's speaks about Mary verse 26 and this and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espouse to a man whose name was Joseph in the house of of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said Heil thou that art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art among thou thou among the women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salute salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and sh call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord shall give him unto him the Throne of his father David he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no ends then Mary said unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel angel answered her and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the holy thing which shall come be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called baren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the hand made of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her now I want to focus on verse 38 brother Bram she says she was about 15 18 years old she was engaged she was practically married what surprised me is that it says she said behold the handmade of the Lord be unto me according to Thy Word how many youth are willing for the will of the Lord to be done in their lives how many have come into their minds to surrender their whole youth to the service of the Lord if I can be understood if you deliver your youth to the Lord the Lord will keep you young spiritually in this life but above all he will keep you young with eternity but if it's the thing that if you want it you have to decide by yourself if it be thy will that you believe the word of God it's hard for a young man why because they think that their youth is theirs but it's not yours your youth should be of the Lords how many youth this night are willing to say to say Lord I give up my I Surrender my youth Maria Mary's belief preached in 1960 Mary the Holy Ghost will come upon you and the almighty shall overshadow thee and that Holy thing that will be born will not be of man but he shall be called The Son of God she threw her little hands up and tears running out of those beautiful eyes and said behold the hand made of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word she didn't wait until she was positive of this she didn't wait until she felt life or some kind of sensation to prove that she was to be a mother she just took the she just took his word and that was enough she surrendered her life she surrendered her future she surrendered her marriage but Above All She surrendered her heart to the Lord but not only was she a virgin in flesh brother Ben says in the spoken word is the original sea preach in 1962 and it's something we should all do and we should be able to do now what was it the Virgin mind womb virgin womb for the baby results eternal life evea good woman as she was virgin as she was but first she let the doubt come in her in by the word a devil's lie what did it do brought her to contact into contact her wrong way what was her child death Mary virgin mind virgin womb when the devil tried to tempt her and he came and the angel come to her and then said you're going to have a baby Satan said now you better inquire about that the angel said it's an Act of God then then she no doubt thought of Isaiah 9:6 and she said behold thou handmade of the Lord what's the results virgin birth Eternal Word in her in her and she brought forth eternal life when she surrendered everything to the Lord Sheed eternal life she received life in order to give life sometimes we want to give life but if we haven't received life then what are we going to give can't give life if we don't have it every preacher every Minister prepares to receive life in order to project life not just here but anywhere he's at there was a man who surrendered his life surrender his family surrender his time he could have been rich but he was poor he surrenders money his name was William Mar and Bram we're sitting here because he gave it all he gave it all he gave his life for God he gave his his life for you a place in this Pew he had he had a wife he gave it all he fcas if filled Luke 14:26 and hate not his father and mother wife and children it's the same as Matthew 10:36 that loveth his father a mother more than me not son and daughter more than me is not worthy of me it's not that you'll despise them but you'll always put God first then your children than your wife you have to place God before before your work sometimes I see when the youth are recing and they get to marriage and later on they go they backslide they disappear from the place they're serving that's when they responsibility than those who are coming from behind them I can't read everything because of time preached in 62 versus Faith sometimes we don't understand why my father gives so much time to the church why my mother gives so much time to the church you should ask that to the children of the pastor to the wife of the pastor I believe they have that question why do my father have so much time at the church why does he have more time with the people than with us because he has conviction to serve and give life life one time sister beta gave a a letter to brother br my wife she's here somewhere she got a letter from a lady over there in Illinois the other day it just burnt into so of my heart this lady said brother sister banham said there's no doubt but what how many times when down thou when down through since you've been married that you have to suffer a lot forther Bron being gone and having those children and said the children of course cry out for their father and so forth and said I know you I know what you mean because I have a lovely husband myself you can read it completely at home the sister told him when she was healed from her sickness bil sister Bram when you're Lonesome said I know how you feel sharing your husband with the world and things like that but just remember a little Kansas housewife is free today because he was willing to mind the Lord I showed Billy I said Billy I want you to send this over to that Methodist College he reached over and got a p and said read some of these I said I know they're wonderful but this this one's enough this is just set the place because men of like the like this one who give it all for the rest that's why we're here God bless [Applause] you God bless you Brothers I hope we all came to see God we didn't come to see any human to see God right follow me to Matthew 1:21 please I'm I'm excited to share a secret with you tonight I think it's a secret for most of us amen but we'll we'll get there but Matthew 1:21 reads and she shall bring bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virt shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel uel which being interpreted is God With Us let me tell you we have Emmanuel with us you don't look too convinced Maybe by the end of my sermon you will be but to begin it's important this time and all times that we understand who God is in the Bible it says that heaven is my throne and Earth his foot stol uh brother uh Bernie he he tripped me on that one last time I don't know if you remember that but let me paint you a picture of what that means Heaven is my throne and Earth my foot stol so God in heaven resting his feet on Earth and we thought Earth was so great we thought this planet was amazing but this is only God's foot stool so how little do you feel now the Earth that we think is so amazing with all the oceans combined all the continents combined and God rests his feet on this planet earth has the surface area of 197 million square miles 197 million and it's just a step stool it's just a bench and God says I'll put my feet on it I want you to understand how great God is the god that broke a rib off of Adam formed a woman and later makes himself so small to get inside a woman we celebrate the birth of Christ but not the birth of God God can't be celebrated like we celebrate the birth of Christ because he is from Everlasting he's to Everlasting he's the Ancient of Days let me tell you the god that you serve he's the Prince of Peace he's the Everlasting father he is without beginning or end our God can move our God has power he was before the first drop of water before there was light that's the god that you serve he's our way maker he's our Bread of Heaven he's our strength he's our breastplates our Shield he's our Heavenly Father God is God and will always be God I just want to talk about God tonight because God being so big made himself so small so even the the scripture says they wrapped them in swaddling clothes but that word swaddling clothes if you didn't no it's actually since he was born in a manger they were the rags that they used to clean the drip off the nipple of the cow that's how low your God got you can't get lower than that brother you can't the almighty in swaddling clothes God so down for us and he was still God the Lamb of God being born the Lamb of God that's why he was born in a manger where the animals are because he was the lamb but yeah he was God in the manger he's God everywhere he's God after church is over he's God before church begins he's God in the middle of the ocean he's God in the middle of the desert he's God in the time of trouble I'm talking about God when you start praising God you'll stop worrying about flesh Mary I don't see a belly I haven't had sex I haven't had sex but I'm trusting to give birth she was not thinking about the flesh she left rejoicing the word says because when you praise God demons tremble hell gets nervous hallelujah hallelujah curses are broken and yolks are destroyed glory to God if you're thinking about praising God anytime no for a fact whatever you're feeling whatever you got on you it's GNA fall off anytime you praise God whatever Wicked spirit needs to fall off amen whatever the devil said it won't stop you as long as you praise God that's the god that we praise the one that walks on water the one that speaks to winds and waves the one who has the last say I don't know what the devil has told you but Jesus has the last [Applause] say the one that can heal all manner of disease tonight forgive me next year or now let's start using the biggest word we know you might know a word with 25 letters but the biggest word has three letters and let's all say it together God amen amen it's big on the earth it's big under the Earth and it's big over the earth that is God that's the most powerful name when all hell is breaking loose in your life the devil expects you to crumble shout shout go amen amen B you never seen me like this that's what happens when you praise God I'm guilty I haven't been praising God it's my goal from now it's my goal from now to start praising God take God at his word I need a drink nobody can stop you from having God and nobody can stop God from having you ain't that good news because if God be for us if God be for us who can be against us you need to understand the magnitude magude of what we are about about what magnitude are you about you need to understand that the magnitude of yourself to understand the magnitude of the fight you're in the fight is not thin the fight is thick right I know we all have great potential in us and that's the magnitude we have because we were built you know what you were built for if we are children of God God doesn't have chickens God doesn't have cowards glory to God understand the magnitude of yourself so you can understand the magnitude of this fight because hell hates you hell hates you because heaven loves you the devil hates you because God loves you the devil wants to intimidate you I remember a sister in the play all those voices talking to her trying to intimidate her trying to have her doubts the devil C comes and wants to trouble you he wants to discourage you he wants to make you reason but if God before us if God before you God's got your bills God's got your situation God's got your circumstance God's got your problems your children your marriage your pain God's got you have you ever felt more secure God's got you Isaiah 96 For unto us a child is born unto us a son given and the government shall be upon his shoulder we stop there and the government shall be upon his shoulders for unto us a child is born look at how much weight the baby could carry baby shoulders God came in baby shoulders and already had the government on his shoulders no wonder the Bible says despise not the day despise not the day if anybody has ever felt small despise not the day of small things a small baby with a government upon his shoulder God came with little shoulders but great strength little shoulders if you feel like you have little shoulders if you feel like the TR is too tough you feel it's too much weight there too much burden let me tell you don't despise the day of small things follow me to Mary's belief and here's the secret it's going to be paragraph 20 and I'm going to be closing my brother can get ready when Jesus told them to wait in the upper room or the city of Jerusalem until they was endued with power from on high the word fell on their ears they was in the temple continually praising God day and night what was they doing what was Mary doing what haven't I been doing what should you be doing watering the that promise watering that promise paragraph 21 you're wanting a Revival who wants a Revival who wants to start the year with a Revival start watering the word the promise if you want to come out of the wheelchair I've seen a person come walking out of a wheelchair so I know this is fact if you want to come out of the wheelchair maybe our spiritual legs are broken start watering the word if you want to come out from that cancer start watering the word we have the word brethren and what did Mary do she left rejoicing thinking about the word a child is to be born a child is to be born a child is to be born a child is to be born watering the word let's just water the word this year and personally for myself I would like to see in increase in my praise because praising God is watering the word God bless you amen God bless you what a powerful word amen it was simple yet powerful because it was centered about uh around God Amen God is great God bless you Brothers invite you to please stand to the Book of Luke as you look I want to thank God and our pastor for allowing to me to be behind his pit and share something with you I know it's been some months now and a little bit more weight as well we're here now of God we are here we've had battles and struggles the enemy cannot withstand us God on our side Luke chap 1 28 to 31 Angel went to her and said greetings you who are highly favored the Lord is with you Mar he was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be but the angel said to her do not be afraid Mary you have found favor with God will conceive and give birth to a son and you are to call him Jesus you may be seated Brothers uh brandham he narrates in one of his [Music] messages the message we've been reading Mary's belief of the Jewish Traditions their Customs said one day prior to the angel visiting [Music] Mary that one day before that she was leaving the synagogue Joseph and Mary were and in the afternoon it was a [Music] custom they sat and and spoke about the word of the message that they had heard that morning they said they were hungry more for the word of God that's what brother [Music] says and they began to seek more scriptures and then they went to the scripture of Isaiah 96 and it says like this unto us a child is bornto us the son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and Mary began to ask Joseph what is this scripture referring to [Music] and Mary says that brother brother Bram that Mary said per I don't know but I believe he's speaking about the messiah's coming he said that Mary stayed with that scripture in her mind and meditate on it throughout the day it says in the evening that she could not sleep he said she could woke up the next day late because she was unable to sleep it was the custom of the Jewish people the day for her to go to the well so that she could wash he said that Mary continued meditating with that scripture felt something strange around her and that's when the angel appeared before her we just read what he said amen I like what brother Bram says because of the thought that Mary had on her mind she had that scripture and was meditating on it in that is why the angel before her he said Mary was meditating on the word of God her mind was on the mind was on the word of God when your mind is on God your mind is on the word of God brother Ram says that the course of your life changes it changes your [Music] atmosphere and you create a beautiful atmosphere and he also narrates the story of cleopas when he was going to his friend with his friend to EMAs the Bible says that they were sad and and buring of the crucifixion of Jesus says that they they had Jesus on their mind that is why Jesus to them the Bible says that Jesus himself Drew n because they had Jesus Christ on their mind because they were in the word brother says that's one of the reasons that the angel appeared to Mary ask you where is your mind to this evening you know why God doesn't come down many times where are our thoughts in that same message Mary's belief is like this oh if we didn't have so many other things on our minds know sometimes we come to [Music] church meditating that tomorrow I have to do this the next day I have to do this when we come to church we're to put aside every thought and the thing of the world enter into fellow and worship meding in our hearts and giving songs and prais to him meditating on the goodness of him what he means to us worshiping in the spirit spiritual songs Melodies in our hearts the Bible says if anyone is Afflicted sing praise be happy meditation always waiting for God to appear to you we get to church with worries that aren't even worth it what are you thinking about where are your thoughts what am I going to eat after service what am I going to do tomorrow what am I who am I going toang out me to the fellowship tomorrow let go of all those and allow God to come on the scene if our thoughts are in the right place I have the certainty that God can come down on the seene that the Holy Ghost can move Maria Mary she had she was in the right thought then the angel said do not be afraid Mary you have found favor with God you will conceive and give birth to a son you are to call him [Music] Jesus when the angel said that unto Mary Bible says that Mary she she took hold of the word of the Angel brother Ram says we take God at his word our life changes its course amen amen but I need the word of God this [Music] even but says we need more Mar take God at his word receive his word and rejoice based herself on she didn't wait for the baby to kick in her womb she did not had of evidence but even then she still she took the angel which was the word of God Mary the Bible says she ran Elizabeth toward elizabar the the the wife of Zachariah Elizabeth Elizabeth was um was pregnant John the Bible says that she was six months pregnant but that there was no movement brother tells us that that baby was dead there was no life in that child there was no life in John but when Mary came from that place where to give her the good news of her pregnancy says the first time the name of Jesus was pronounced by human lips it brought life to a dead baby in the womb of his mother the baby inside of Elizabeth leap she was filled with the Holy Ghost what could happen this evening we invoke the name of Jesus and be filled with the Holy Spirit she believed with simply the word of the Angel his word is more than enough the word of God was more than enough it was more than enough for Mary what about you Brothers what about you sister is the word not [Music] enough God gave us his word but he also sent his son and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God Everlasting father the Prince of Peace I ask why did God send his son what did he see in US and I began to meditate the Bible says in John 3:16 why sent son so that we would be saved but it also says that so that he could dwell in us I have to know you he was made flesh experiment and go through what we go he was made human said he was as one of us he ate like us he dressed like us walked like us like us what does all that mean that the Lord Jesus Christ he went through Temptations afflictions pain sadness how God knows us what we go through what we're going through but remember brother R also says that God is a gentleman if you open the doors of your heart to God he will come in but if you don't want him to come in he won't come in because he's a gentleman amen if you would please stand the musicians can't come forward we don't want to have a relationship an intimate relationship with him we don't want him to enter into our hearts we just let him come into and we tell him you stop right there don't enter any longer don't seek anymore God knows when you're sad he knows when you're Afflicted he understands he sent his son I I remember one of the my most favorite preachings of from the pastor we live in a world where if something breaks we just go and replace it God he said God's not like that sometimes we are broken we're broken but God restores us he uses us again he picks us [Music] up because God is righteous because we are his children children because we have for [Music] him perhaps this evening we're broken and that's fine perhaps we're in pain that's okay maybe we have many problems maybe our family maybe our marriage isn't right and that's okay [Music] but I believe God gave us the necessary enough to [Music] fight us enough to fight with what we your family's broken don't let it stay in that if you're sad don't stay in that stat don't stay [Music] broken if your family needs you don't stay there without if your son or daughter is lost fight fight I'm a witness of the hand of [Music] God I was sick one time and he healed me I was broken and He restored me if you need healing here's a there's a Healer here if you need restoration we have a go I know somebody restores I know that one that restores if you are you are chained and in [Music] bondage I know a [Music] deliverer in the house of my father that it is there what you need we're two days from entering into a new year I don't know how you want to enter it I don't know how you want to receive that year Christmas has passed you gave gifts to your children to your wife to your loved ones but what did you give [Music] God give them your life the altar is open [Music] Brothers amen the altar is open oh my board of life and sells on the troubl sea whenever there's a window in my myself but I

the one in the morning will be at 10:30 and then there'll be a food afterwards a fellowship and then at 5:30 and onward we'll have a dinner and then at 9 we'll start the service the end of year service so it's going to be a long day but hopefully you'll be able to rest well get here to the 10 don't come sleeping come sleep but come having rested well come alert and awake if you have to rest in between the two Services there's no problem to get here and have a good time there's a lot to give glory to God about there's like three or four of us there's a lot to give glory to God for we have a lot to give him glory for so that'll be this Sunday service normally we're accustomed to write a letter uh to put it in the hands of God and to write some petitions there for the year and if someone would like to do that you're welcome to those are the personal letters your personal letter you know I was [Music] remembering that this year's fast we put as a Church petition God opened up the doors for our church we did the fast this year we said we're gonna ask open up the doors for our church part of our prayer and God answered us kind of God that we [Applause] serve it's I believe it's important to remember what we've asked of God asked God for and that's why it's it's good to write it down for you to later come back and remember has been faithful to his word sometimes it's EAS for us to forget it to forget that God has answered many petitions for us so if you write that personal letter put your name on it we're GNA bring it here forward and re uh put it in believing amen amen and then beginning of the year we're gonna start the fast and we're going to encourage everyone to do the fast we understand that maybe not everyone's going to do it we encourage everyone to try and do it it's not in vain as we just say God answers our prayers and we're going to do it a little bit different where we're going to focus on prayer and we're gonna put three different times in the in the afternoon for everyone's praying at the same time all that can we're going to be praying those 21 days at least three times a day and on Wednesdays that we're here uh we're going to dedicate them to prayer we're gonna accustom ourselves to praying because sometimes we're too fety brother says that sing a lot and preach a lot or too much we can't pray enough or too much so we're going to do things a little bit differently week of January the first seven [Music] days we want for us to focus on ourselves first week just pray for examine yourself the second week we want to pray for someone else perhaps that second week we'll see the petitions of everyone else and the third week we want to pray for our church what God has placed in our hearts is to focus on prayer this upcoming year battles are going to get even more difficult we have to counteract the enemy attack the enemy and and take god seriously so then prepare to pray some [Music] more some of you pray prepare to pray even more a lot more than what you're praying now think that sometimes we come to church and we don't even pray right that's why we come and don't receive anything am so if you can then buy yourself a notebook so that when we come to pray you can write down what God has told because prayer is a two-way street other words you speak to God and God speaks to you and you can write down what God tells you God to help us brothers so we're going to be doing the fast we're going to be taking communion and doing God might direct us to do something prepared for anything but we just want to dedicate ourselves more to God and to give him the first the first fruit because the first fruits of everything he gives us we ought to give back to him he deserves the tithing of our year it's not an entire tithing because it days at the very least let give him three weeks amen very well to all the brothers who watch us through the internet I'm be some petitions if you cane stand Sharon Sanchez sister
