bless everyone that's watching through the internet after jesus christ or the growth of a christian and that is virtue and uh we'll be speaking on verse 9. i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but that are rich i want to focus on that part i want to focus on this as well and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan and as the title and know that that you are the one that is worth it the father we put ourselves in your heart the smearing church age went through but i i like this verse especially what the second part says and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan we spoke on this verse previously okay the attention that there were people [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] but the children of [Applause] [Applause] suspect [Applause] [Applause] places because that is the way that gospel is refers to other countries [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] how can god bear to look upon his own in a time of need and not just stop at all just give it and lavish every everything material upon them to why don't you give them everything instead of taking everything from them this is here's where father knows the things you have need of el el quembiste del campo menta a los pajarillos para ustedes he will close the lily and feeds the sparrow shall do much more for you established but god addresses the lily these physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life for a man's life consistently not of the things he but possesses sneaky first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all material necessities will be added unto you el puedo noise del pensar material the people of god are not material minded they are christ's mind uh age is one of the vast wealth where often the criterion of spirituality is an abundance of earthly goods in other words they think that the more they have the more spiritual they are spiritually churches the more they have the more spiritual the greater the buildings goods but how poor in spirits for yours is the maybe god [Applause] he lets it is is is of god [Music] and if he allows us to use something estelle is his espana it's for him it's because let it all go because i'm a nobody i want you to see santiago do cinco uh james two verse five says and heirs of the kingdom which has promised to them that love him now that doesn't mean that's difficult if we take that voice or that that scripture literally would be like well god only chose the poor lament only if i'm poor is when god will choose me or elect me but it all depends that's why it says blessed the the poor in spirit the one that is anything we think we have it all that's right we don't come needy many times we say oh i've heard it i know it all that's why we receive nothing [Applause] that acknowledges our need the more you acknowledge your need the more poor you are i can't take there are people that depend too much on themselves watch what the apostle paul says ii corinthians 6 3. giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed but in all things of proving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience in afflictions in necessities and distresses and assault is incarcerated in imprisonments in tumults and labors and watchings and fastings by pureness by knowledge by long suffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned by the word of truth by the power of god by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honor and dishonor by evil report and good reports as deceivers but you know what so that they would [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] that's [Music] god owes us nothing [Applause] we are so unhappy because we think we're somebody that's why we're so wretched my husband should treat me this way my wife should treat me this way where we're nobody come on brothers that's why we're so unhappy is it's just because he loves us [Music] [Music] as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful always rejoicing man [Applause] [Music] renders himself [Applause] use me as you please [Applause] [Music] a poor person in the lord he has you see why god doesn't use us because we're trying to find a place we're seeking opposition to somebody or something in his life i can't use you like that perfect for
