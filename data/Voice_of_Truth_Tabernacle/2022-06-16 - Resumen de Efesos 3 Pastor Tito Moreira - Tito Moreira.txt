pray celestia heavenly father [Music] do you call it keep working in our lives lord gracias thank you lord yes because right now this is another another opportunity this evening that you would operate you would do as our soul is needing in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you may be seated we're speaking on paul he because he's the first messenger angel he's the first angel of i'll take advantage of this reviewing parable to speak on things i didn't speak on the first time always something more to speak always something more to search out uh aura pablo es el menzajo the church of the ephesians represents the fundamental defense represents the foundation of the faith say with me the church of ephesus represents represents the foundation of faith [Music] everything else depends on how strong you will not receive virtues if you don't have faith you won't receive knowledge if you don't have faith you won't receive temperaments if you don't have faith everything else requires faith so we want to speak on that uh brother branham a little bit about faith and how the faith ties in with love so la vida de pablo the life of paul nos habla acerca speaks to us of the man of faith pablo paul was a mantar it could face any he faced many things they left him as as dead i'll have the name in english that's where he was stoned and they left him as a dead man honey and he [Applause] and faces these are these men of witchcraft sorcerers a few times but it didn't matter to him he kept speaking about what god had given him no important french encounter of intellectuals he didn't care to face the intellectuals he would face the scholars many times [Music] he survived a a great multitude of people that come up against him equando the roman governors reyes judeos jewish kings not once did he ever back off paul never backed off dead many times at the point of death people terrorized around him but he had that perfect desire the building is is founded on perfect but the brand says in perfect faith and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith to them with this perfect face so is it now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others we but what the spirit says now this phrase is given to the seven church ages he goes right on just and that's by faith when [Applause] here anything else hold on now pablo paul and called me by his grace the perfect faith is based on something perfect what is a perfect faith based on establish based on the grace of god you have to go through the three steps of of grace three stages of grace many times you go to justification and then the new birth is do you want to have this type of faith brothers you want to make sure you have it here perfect faith is basis but grace and you had he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins he considered himself the worst of sinners [Applause] oh the lord jesus christ than a prostitute and the people about what he had done on hundreds or thousands the declaration of a decree to kill against the children of god the bible says how many how many killings did he or judgments he didn't have upon him of god because of what he had done when paul speaks these words together [Applause] [Applause] this is so fundamentally perfect you won't have the perfect faith this element brandon brother branham says notice now another perfect faith paragraph 49 sit there notice now another perfect faith is the master of all circumstances perfect faith masters all circumstances you you won't have perfect listen to me grace foreign [Applause] throughout everything you understand loved by god because he understood the grace do you see him on brandon brother branham says for example like uh is genuine love will create a confidence in his word that time in her testimony i'm not what i wanted to say that i'm not what i used to be hey yes she knows she'll come somewhere gives me confidence in him he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he saw something in me is helviol with me and if you saw something in me it doesn't matter if nobody else sees it it doesn't matter if i don't see it see alviol with me if he saw something in me god's not something in you he could have took no one can do it that creates faith you'll never have faith when he pushed [Applause] he knows what he's doing your you lord divine love towards others i'll see if god touches them see if god does something for me speaking to steve who's who's interested in him not senor no sir [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i love them as well if you don't understand god's love towards your life you'll never trust in him completamente completely when we know that he loves us in the past that he has paved for our life is a path of love it doesn't matter how difficult it is eso depending that depends on how much you trust in here because we don't trust in him what he's telling us that's why we can't let it go brother tito you don't trust that because we don't trust in his love towards us the musicians can't come forward was the messenger of this age full nombre was a man that lived by the grace of god when god told him no do not doubt what you're doing paul tells timothy [Music] christo jesus christ jesus come into the world to save sinners [Music] when you understand god's love [Music] we don't deserve anything but yet he loves us so much [Music] why don't we understand his love towards us why don't we [Music] [Music] [Music] please stand [Music] then [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let me be if [Music]
