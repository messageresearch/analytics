me that way to speak a little bit more on him see this is c and a number of one sync oh no salvation [Music] Syria was a great man with his master in honorable because by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria he was also my men in battle that's pretty Brothers is internet Gloria is great he was a great man is that because the Lord I'm going to read it once again Brothers because Brothers when you read a little further you begin to see that he didn't see it that way he had Brothers a great man Aaron General a great name and he was a very well-known General he was just an instrument we're just instruments many times Brothers because God had raised them up and it was nothing that he did and that's how many times that's how we are many times we've been able to see someone who says you know what I'm a lawyer I'm a lawyer I have my daughter I am an engineer I'm a great mechanic or they could say I'm a great Builder construction worker great painter but we owe that all to God sometimes we just give ourselves I know this because my father told it to me um because God has given it to us and God allowed that our god of Glory Gloria glory to God but here Brothers he was very brave and already done a great problem and it's that he was a leper leprosy that and the syrians had gone out by companies in Broadway captive of the land of Israel a little maid and she waited on naaman's wife and she said unto her misses would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover for he would recover him on his leprosy and we're seeing here Brothers he understood who the Lord was that young lady what was it there when I began to read here wasn't she like a slave foreign the Holy Spirit ought to dwell on us was serving mucho and I I see it this way Brothers he got his service he got his Muse Hermano the city this is at first he got um he went to the king of Syria Israel we're the king of Israel he went to the king of Syria but he's told him to go on so that he could get healed the king of Israel says I'm not reading this just so we can go on a little further go a little faster he says in my God that I could heal you from God so God was hearing yeah and he says but he Brothers [Music] many times Brothers we go and ask for counselor advice from my brother yes I'm gonna ask him for advice but because he doesn't give us the advice that we want to hear oh that wasn't of God foreign he's the one that provides the private way of God your name and left we know that he went angry because it didn't happen the way he wanted it to yeah I still have my notes Here on paper I haven't learned how to use the tablets I didn't even read anything Brothers glory to God many times Brothers leprosy hits harder when it's the leprosy of the Soul I think that there are many people here that are with that leprosy in the world I like to drink a lot but the word says that all that the man shall so so that that shall he read and I struggled very much with a worshiping God on Fridays instead of going to church I would go with my friends waiting for the day of tomorrow to see what dance club we're going to go to or what bars and on Sundays we would get up instead of going to church and we'd be hungover we'll be hungover but now by the glory of God God is taking that leprosy away he doesn't do things halfway tonight glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord glory to God today in the morning I was studying a little bit and I began to read a few messages I was watching videos of the how the churches are now in days the message of the our brothers because Brothers we're very close we're right on the edge because you're not criticizing anyone there are churches where they're of rock and roll they're dressed as rock and roll people that all this would be seen every time even thanks to God for the trials that he gives us right because that all the words their brothers why was he there as a leper with lepersy in Israel who understands and heals who was blind and that the disciples asked Jesus who sinned he or his parents and what do you say neither of them and then so then why is he there to manifest my power he says glory to God for that perhaps to manifest the power of God glory to God bless you thank you [Applause] amen God bless you if you would just open your Bibles foreign uh if you would please stand with me like this he says Rivers the Damascus better than all the Waters of Israel may I not wash in them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage Israel limpio is and the servants came near and spake unto him it said my father if the prophet had bid they do some great thing will this thou not have done it how much rather than when he said to thee wash and be clean masos limpio then when he down verse 14 then when he down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again like unto the Flesh of a little child and he was clean says like that first part it says then he went down and we'll be reading Philippians chapter 2 verse 7. just a few readings to the scripture here see uh Philippians 2 verse 7. says but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men yeah if I uh with the title it you're you know for as a thought you know I think I'd try to let you know along with poor brother uh Hector said uh he'll he'll be there amen amen uh you know uh like brother Hector was saying that Naaman was a man of uh of a great reputation reputation you know he really wanted to be uh you know he it's like anybody you know he wanted to be accepted you know by society and uh and so you know he he didn't want to exactly uh ruin the reputation that he thought he had yellow reputation amen my man uh you know because some people you know they they really think highly of themselves and uh you know they just want to you know act a certain way you know I dress a certain way you know you want to get those likes let's go uh you know you want to get them followers uh you know but uh you know I I read a quote one time and uh you know uh before we uh before we can leave we have to learn how to follow before we can lead yeah and you know but we have to watch who we're following it you know there's just so much confusion in this time and uh you know I was I'll show my daughter here not that long ago matter of fact it was yesterday okay foreign a lot of times we're influenced you know by by external things you know thinking that that's the right thing to do correct you know I'm a perfect example Perfecto if I didn't have long sleeves you know you you'd be able to see that I you know I have tattoos you know that at the time that was that was what uh you know I thought was the right thing so I completely understand you know when other people do things that they shouldn't doses because they they feel like that's right they feel like that's going to satisfy you know their their their hunger you know this guy was talking about you know uh you know the the frogs you know in in the Amazon forest is and uh you know the thing of it is it's uh it's it's you know there's certain ones that you really have to watch out for and uh and you just got to be real careful uh you know because uh there's they actually stand out from the rest you know and there's just certain there's certain things about them that you can tell you know the there's just something different about about that animal you know it's it's uh it's the the fluorescent colors no whether it be a Una [Music] you know the the rock and roll era has come into you know the the church and you know it and we know it's not right you know and so they think that you know they those those fluorescent colors you know they think that you know by by wearing that so you know by by uh you know listening to the certain type of music that that is it's it's just it's gonna make things better you know and it might just change their reputation it might make them stand out a little bit but you know you don't have to do those things to stand out they say that you know sometimes you know what's really big you know and guys and girls season is the the fluorescent thing going on yes you know and and you know it's it's one of those things that you know that what what's going on inside of them a lot of times it's it's being shown on in the external Realms you know they want they want to you know have have that reputation perhaps and you know I believe that you know Naaman at that time you know he was he was probably hungering for something you know he wanted to take care of his reputation not because you know he was a great man the Bible says among you know amongst the the uh the Army ranks [Music] oh but you know there was also another man there and uh you know he also you know had a reputation you know not because he wanted to have that I believe that that um you know Naaman didn't even know Elisha okay but you know that uh when when uh you're a servant of God you know your reputation it goes before you to reputation before you even get there you know and and people you know know that that you know the man of God's coming they already start to work you know that's that that's what Jesus did you know people found out Jesus was coming you know he he would just get there and he would just say come follow me yes and they did it because of the reputation you know that he had reputation it went ahead of him but you know but in this world this world is not it's not it doesn't work like that is you know because uh Naaman was told by the man of God what exactly he had to do is you know name and what name it was I believe Naaman was was scared a name it was a little bit uh you know he he didn't quite trust he didn't quite trust you know what the prospect was telling us I wonder if that's how many of us are in this time how many of us are are like that in this time well you know what we're not quite trusting what the prophet is saying you know he had a problem he had all he had all these great you know of these great titles yes that is is that that doesn't have any sin in their lives so because you know because he he doesn't want to go down to the Jordan you see because uh because what would the people say you know what was your friend saying you know if they saw you clapping in church I saw you crying but what would they say what would be of your reputation they saw you do those things if they saw you getting a new birth what would your friend say about that I believe Naaman had many of those worries because you know he was he was the he was the man we could say he was probably Top Dog [Applause] you know and they want to be tough dogs you know it's the truth you know anytime you you know you know in the worldly ranks you know you you always water you can always tell kind of who's the the little Alpha there sometimes it's the little guy you know you just kind of going in there man but all the everybody's following oh you know how to brother I actually have a brother you know that's that's how he was yeah CSL you know he he he he'd have his little Posse wherever he went me he had like five or six pieces that's just that's just the kind of person that he wants yes and you know just everybody wanted to be around you know and when he dropped out of school he was like 14 years old and uh you know and you can't really you can't drop out until you're 16. and they just said please don't come back don't press we won't press charges you know but just don't come back so he you know he just stayed home he thought he won he was like yeah no more schools and uh you know he just went home foreign you know it was like three or four guys there you know she was like what are you guys doing like well you know I dropped out so we dropped out too and Toes that's the kind of influence that he had yeah and you know I believe that you know you probably had that kind of influence you know he didn't want to lose that so you know he didn't want to lose his friends you know in your life where you you have to you have to uh you have to have that peace in your heart I heard a guy say one time he said he said you're either gonna be at peace with yourself there's going to come a time in your life you have to make a decision because you cannot have the peace of God you know and then have peace with the world because the world can't give that to you the world is actually gonna take that away because they want you to be with him and I believe that that's the point that Naaman had come to you you know he had come to a place where he didn't want to be a leopard but it was gonna tell it was gonna cost something I think he was gonna have to pay a price for healing he was gonna have to come down that's what every son and daughter again you're gonna have to come down from your position you know when you make that decision enough no he's gonna be there amen Glory uh you know I was uh I was Enrico's soccer game yesterday football and uh he did something that uh just kind of took me back to to my uh childhood uh my my teenage years uh you know when he when we when we got there he kind of he kind of looked back a little bit come on a little bit gracias you know just to see if we were there and uh you know I remember doing the same thing uh one thing that uh I remember I would uh I I I you know I I was an athlete and you know I got a lot of playing time and one of the things I always desired was uh for for my uh my dad to be there you know I would play I would play a lot you see because if I didn't play and my dad went Eva then I was gonna hear about it I made sure that I was playing I'm sure I was going to get every minute and you know I'd make a good play yes and I just kind of look up at the stands and uh wanted to see if my dad was there and he he never made it he never made it to the game how about what always really encouraged me I was uh my little brother you know he always had his little Posse with him Siempre ad gracias you got us he always had his posse and I would always look up to the right and you know he would he would give me the thumbs up and uh you know just bring me Comfort yes you know what bring me joy to my heart that somebody went to go watch me please you know I think in the Christian Life sometimes we think nobody's watching but that when you're trying to live for God he's going to be there but he's going to be there in my heart no I would look at him and I would just get a boost of energy and you know I will just play I was like he's the only one that came you know there may be people that may not understand me you know I'm willing to accept the reproach for the cause of the words I'm willing to accept that is willing to accept that my family's Never Gonna understand me they're not going to understand the way I live they're not going to understand my purpose they're not going to understand it they're not willing to accept them because I know somebody I know there's somebody here is gonna understand that's what I'm going through okay or peace I want the holy ghosts so you know we showed up late to the game yesterday but we made it we made it to the game you know it's better to make it late than never you might have just barely made it to church might have thought you was just gonna stay home but you made that's right brother we made it late maybe pero yagamos and uh I might have I may have made it late but God's never late he's never late he's always on time Tiempo and when I think about that there's a lot of people that we're looking for somebody they were looking for somebody they were looking for their dad they were looking for their mom they were looking for their sisters they were looking for peace they were looking for something it may have never made it so but I want to tell you that God made it God made it here and you made it here because God made it here you know you may have been forsaken you may have been disappointed you know with with the things that have happened in this life and you know you don't understand why they happened you've been looking for something you desired your whole life and you know and you may have been disappointed but I believe that when Naaman made it to the Jordan what he was looking for his whole life it was there he may not have saw he may not have saw what he's in may have seen at the other rivers he may have not saw you know some beautiful sights are there something you know pleasing to the Allah but you can find your peace you can find it in here man you may not find popularity you may not find Fame La Familia may not find a hole a lot of friends Amigos but you'll find the truth Amigo you'll find somebody that understands somebody that feels your pain maybe your mom doesn't understand your brothers or sisters you know and I believe that that's the greatest thing that that mankind is looking you may look at yourself in the mirror and say everything's fine I don't need nothing no neces God bless you yeah because I do I need healing I need healing from my soul I need healing for my spirit I need those things and you can find it you can find it you can start right here God bless you Elizabeth [Applause] [Music] amen hallelujah glorious

[Music] [Music] [Music] give a clap offering to our Lord you may be seated did you ask him to bless you you're already here I think that name is said I'm already here I've come so far why don't I just try it sometimes we come to church because it's not what we thought of it we don't even ask anything and we leave the same way when sometimes God is just waiting for us to try it why don't I ask him for the Holy Spirit maybe in a service like this when he's going to give it to me don't leave without asking them don't leave without asking I think that name and said I'm gonna try it not so convinced but I'm gonna try it anyways that's what we can do the Lord your Prophet said it I believe it and I'm going to confess it Lord amen maybe it's not the way that I want it sometimes we want emotions and a great preacher and great musicians and this and the others for everything to be beautiful but sometimes God says I want to give it to you this way you just have to believe me and ask of it anyways that's the kind of God that we serve he doesn't need great events to give us what we need of amen said well I thought that he was going to come he's going to see me he's gonna place his hands on me and that was going to be healed that way I was very disappointed even when we're disappointed God can answer us Our God only wants us to obey and for us to believe him we're going to be
