[24:07] their taskmasters
[24:14] verse eight says like this
[24:20] and i've come down to deliver them out
[24:21] of the hand of the egyptians
[24:27] and to bring them up out of that land
[24:29] unto a good land in a
[24:31] tierrace
[24:33] onto a land flowing with milk and honey
[24:37] verse 9.
[24:43] now therefore behold the cry of the
[24:45] children of israel is come unto you

[27:25] [Applause]
[27:46] the way of
[28:36] [Music]
[29:05] i'm going to give a little bit about the
[29:07] story of moses
[29:09] how he came to this world
[29:16] the people of israel found themselves in
[29:17] differences
[29:20] they found themselves in slavery
[29:25] israel where the people of egypt took
[29:27] advantage of the people
[29:28] [Music]
[29:29] and there was a little couple
[29:32] that brother speaks about
[29:35] it was amram
[29:36] [Music]
[29:38] and joshua
[30:18] and i believe that there are couples
[31:02] we don't see
[32:12] i'm tired
[33:20] use us
[33:22] pirouette
[33:58] but god doesn't need you god bless you

[34:08] amen
[34:13] holy spirit
[34:16] we in ourselves can't do it no
[35:14] is
[35:17] on on living the crazy life in this
[35:18] world
[35:20] and acting as he pleases
[35:23] happiness
[35:24] that we're going to lose it
[35:27] we're going to lose our life
[38:28] [Music]
[38:44] they know
[38:58] your lives
[39:40] nermanos and look brothers
[39:46] i'm going to read this story
[39:48] and i'm going to be closing with this
[39:49] midi look
[39:52] i'm going to read it
[39:54] many
[40:07] and he was about to get married
[40:10] throughout the trip
[40:12] the man thought
[40:16] it'd be better if he took a different
[40:17] path
[40:21] of the one that he would take to to get
[40:23] to his promised ones
[40:27] and he decided to learn a new route
[40:31] that was more comfortable
[40:34] and that would promise new adventures
[41:05] going going on a path that they really
[41:07] didn't take him anywhere
[41:10] until one day he felt tired
[41:14] and
[41:14] the adventures have stopped being new
[41:36] and he despised the warmth of a home
[41:40] and so we decided to return
[41:43] however
[41:45] when he got there
[41:58] he found out that his promise
[42:08] so many years of not hearing about him
[42:09] she had thought he was dead
[42:12] the man
[42:23] regretting about the moment that he had
[42:24] taken the the opposite path
[42:28] and here's the
[43:38] let's run to
[43:52] god heard
[44:06] in slavery for 400 years
[44:09] with pain and sorrows
[44:15] a people that had possibly forgotten
[44:17] about the promises god had but
[44:20] there came
[44:34] the oppression
[45:01] of many
[45:16] um
[45:26] [Music]
[45:31] i want to share a testimony
[45:39] and i have three weeks
[45:42] with this same thought
[45:44] no matter how tranquilo and it hasn't
[45:46] left me still it hasn't left me alone
[45:49] [Music]
[45:51] and i thank god
[45:55] on the 20th of june
[45:58] of last
[46:25] i was in the wrong room
[46:34] [Music]
[48:24] [Music]
[48:33] yeah
[48:35] and what happened there was fulfilled
[48:39] part of the dream
[48:42] i was seated
[48:46] it appeared like if i was at a camp
[48:49] cristiano in a christian camp
[48:53] i said well what am i doing here
[48:56] and i would see a lot of youth
[48:59] and on my right side persona there was a
[49:01] person
[49:03] you may josue and they said to me josue
[49:06] josue
[49:09] you have to die
[49:13] you have to die
[49:49] [Applause]
[50:16] [Music]
[50:24] it doesn't matter
[50:41] [Music]
[50:46] a child of god
[50:49] [Music]
[51:05] foreign
[51:34] they began
[51:43] god
[52:02] don't leave us alone
[52:04] forgive us
[52:07] our freedom
[52:10] and if you came today
[52:12] you're looking for freedom
[52:15] a deliverance from
[52:27] something in my heart

[54:31] [Music]
[55:32] and the reasons of their
[55:44] and i'm going to send you there

[58:05] i don't want to return
[58:31] he's
[58:48] hundred thousand four hundred years of
[58:50] slavery
[58:53] until they began to cry to god
[58:59] it was a different kind of cry
[59:02] it's a different
[59:16] question
[59:18] that are crying for something more
[59:20] no
[59:22] i don't know what your situation is
[59:25] perhaps you're not coming to church
[59:30] i know
[59:46] [Music]
[1:00:26] i made
[1:01:22] profit
[1:01:43] god bless you brothers
[1:01:46] [Applause]
[1:01:52] god bless you
[1:01:54] you all look beautiful tonight
[1:01:57] if you may please stand
[1:01:59] if you could open your bibles to exodus
[1:02:01] chapter 3 verse 7 to 10.
[1:02:19] and it says like this
[1:02:21] see and the lord said i have surely seen
[1:02:23] the affliction of my people which are in
[1:02:26] egypt
[1:02:32] and have heard their
[1:02:51] onto a good land and enlarge onto a land
[1:02:54] flowing with milk and honey carlos
[1:03:02] now therefore behold the cry of the
[1:03:05] children of israel is common to me
[1:03:08] jose is
[1:03:10] that me and i have also seen the
[1:03:12] oppression it
[1:03:29] my people
[1:03:31] the children of israel
[1:03:34] out of egypt amen
[1:03:36] you may take your seeds brothers
[1:03:39] god heard my cry
[1:04:09] is
[1:04:25] one of the greatest leaders in the bible
[1:04:29] you see he shows a great example of
[1:04:31] leadership
[1:04:33] you see when he freed the israelites
[1:04:35] from bondage
[1:04:37] israelites
[1:04:51] during those years
[1:05:02] you see moses wasn't always the same
[1:05:04] leader that he was vermouth
[1:05:07] when he freed the israelites
[1:05:10] no brother branham says that moses was
[1:05:12] keeping the flock of his father-in-law
[1:05:17] and it went to the back side of the
[1:05:19] mountain of horror
[1:05:34] and he spoke to him through a burning
[1:05:35] baby
[1:05:37] and god told moses
[1:05:40] moses
[1:05:41] i have brought you here
[1:05:43] because i have heard the clamor of my
[1:05:45] people
[1:05:48] in
[1:06:02] you see when moses heard the
[1:06:03] responsibility
[1:06:08] when moses heard the rules
[1:06:14] you see this is what most of us do these
[1:06:15] days
[1:06:30] i
[1:06:44] i am the one who makes the blind
[1:06:46] makes it blind makes the yo
[1:06:50] and the people
[1:06:54] so god tells moses anton says dios
[1:06:56] ladies someone says go there because i
[1:06:59] will do wonders in egypt
[1:07:02] and moses says what if they don't
[1:07:04] believe me
[1:07:07] god promised moses
[1:07:10] but he was going to be with him
[1:07:12] you see it
[1:08:08] a
[1:08:19] what does it matter to me who your god
[1:08:21] is
[1:08:22] important
[1:08:36] double the
[1:08:46] and the egyptians made the children of
[1:08:48] israel to serve with
[1:09:15] you see because of pharaoh por causa del
[1:09:17] faragon put in more more uh
[1:09:20] more burden on the people
[1:09:24] of israel this led to the people
[1:09:27] of israel feeling oppressed
[1:09:31] the people estoy
[1:10:13] every morning every night
[1:10:28] moses didn't stop going to pharaoh he
[1:10:30] says
[1:10:31] although the israelites didn't care
[1:10:35] moses didn't lock himself in a room
[1:10:37] vamoy says no sense
[1:10:39] and said all these people do not do not
[1:10:41] support me
[1:10:51] [Applause]
[1:10:57] you know the point that shocks me the
[1:10:58] most about moses's story
[1:11:02] is that god knows who he chooses
[1:11:06] how many believe that tonight
[1:11:24] care about the opinions of this world
[1:11:26] again
[1:11:33] god said it and what is about god is
[1:11:35] going to be
[1:11:38] what
[1:11:52] i need to clarify something okay
[1:11:55] no this life is not easy let's not be
[1:11:57] that nice fascinating we gotta stop
[1:11:59] playing church brothers
[1:12:01] it's not easy
[1:12:03] not everyone will believe in us
[1:12:05] not everyone is gonna give us a pat on
[1:12:07] the shoulder saying well done
[1:12:11] this life is easy
[1:12:17] this life is not easy established
[1:12:33] people will think that you're crazy
[1:12:36] but that does not give us the license
[1:12:40] tie ourselves up
[1:12:42] to tie ourselves
[1:12:44] to hide ourselves
[1:12:46] no brothers god spoke with us
[1:13:28] because the kind of relationship that
[1:13:29] you have with god
[1:14:25] because we are so attached to the keys
[1:14:27] of this world
[1:14:30] and instead of accepting what god has
[1:14:32] for us
[1:14:34] we start making up excuses
[1:14:38] why do we start making up excuses
[1:14:54] and they were put in a certain position
[1:14:57] where it looked impossible
[1:15:00] where it looked a little difficult
[1:15:03] you see in front of them
[1:15:05] what's the red sea established
[1:15:08] the south and
[1:15:36] because that is
[1:15:50] you see god wanted to bring moses to the
[1:15:52] red sea
[1:15:54] because while the israelites
[1:15:58] were going to die
[1:16:01] god was going to manifest this power
[1:16:04] support moses
[1:16:32] and it says like this this i see
[1:16:35] god said stand on your feet moses
[1:16:38] go speak to the children of israel
[1:16:42] that they go forward
[1:16:45] never does god ever say retreat
[1:16:50] there's no retreat in god
[1:16:56] no matter what stage of the battle
[1:16:58] you're in
[1:17:00] if you've
[1:17:13] i'm afraid about the baptism of the holy
[1:17:15] spirit
[1:17:17] and go forward
[1:17:21] don't come back
[1:17:23] there's nothing about god
[1:17:26] god is always going forward
[1:17:54] just keep moving forward
[1:18:52] moses was different
[1:19:05] the egyptians beating up the hebrews
[1:19:19] was because he didn't have that holy
[1:19:20] spirit
[1:19:23] and that's how we are brothers
[1:19:25] well we don't have that holy spirit
[1:19:29] we make so many mistakes
[1:19:32] we fell in so many places where we
[1:19:33] certified
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:20:15] they might have been free physically
[1:20:19] but they were not free spiritually
[1:20:23] you see they wanted to do things in
[1:20:24] their own ways
[1:20:28] and because of them
[1:20:30] they had to suffer
[1:20:56] don't think that going to church on
[1:20:58] wednesdays fridays and sundays is going
[1:20:59] to save you no piece
[1:21:01] of domingo
[1:21:03] brothers we need the holy spirit
[1:21:05] we need him
[1:21:08] you see
[1:21:10] god can free us from the oppression
[1:21:12] of
[1:21:26] you just
[1:21:39] that oppression cannot hold us
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:54] and that is
[1:22:36] how many believe that god is here
[1:22:38] tonight
[1:22:40] how many believe that the lord jesus
[1:22:41] christ
[1:22:44] you see it maybe you might be in chains
[1:22:46] right now
[1:22:49] by the enemy
[1:23:04] those
[1:23:19] any oppression
[1:23:22] of the enemy
[1:23:27] they will make a way
[1:23:29] well there is no way oh i will come he
[1:23:31] will make a way
[1:23:57] if you want to be free tonight
[1:24:00] tonight is your opportunity
[1:24:04] [Music]
