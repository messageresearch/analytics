[Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is is [Music] is [Music] [Music] yes [Music] me [Music] [Applause] okay can we give a clap offense to the lord [Applause] it's good to be in the house of god is buenos aires everyone looks like they want to be here today thank you for this new opportunity gracias that you be with me and my interpreter and then genesis 24 33. when you have it you can say man understand so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god and when you have it you can say amen amen here's some pages flipping still amen genesis 24 33 amend genesis and there was set me before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told my aaron and he said speak on hey man you may be seated bro so the context here is eliezer is eliaser wants to give his message and um this is very embarrassing brother but can you remind me the title of all right right our title for tonight who will we choose my subtitles [Applause] and he wanted to first give his message and the reason why rebecca rebecca later on said i will go it's because this message is produced so we should be thinking we should be stirring [Music] she's a real contender you know but you know many brothers have already shared so much on rebecca hermanos and brother branham refers to us as rebecca's also innocent so brother branham in the mess is choosing of a bride he says natural is type of the spiritual natural spiritual and just as you choose a husband and wife in the naturals you have to choose a husband in the spirit spiritual amen man and i want you to think of yourself as a rebecca quiero gusta piense como una rebeca because he is coming for a bride por que el yes sir so rebecca also had the choice if she wanted to go see a just like we have the choices if we want this king si queremos estere now i want to remind you quiro recorder considering my spouse seriously now just as rebecca was considering isaac now let us consider [Music] you must choose a man with ambition remember aside he loves god already number two [Music] they have to have a vision for their family vision for their well-being vision that he will provide and you know and you know god our adios has great plans planets greater than satan's mas grandes que los de satanas greater than mine greater plants than anybody hernandez and he's just getting started and god has purpose for his bride he has the vision for the future of his team that knows what he wants to do with his life in the future now in proverbs 31 if you've read it solomon's mother is advising him what a king should be sustained on it says her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land let me take you to revelation 4 4 now you don't have to look for it she is saying that a leader this is 24 elders and god sitting among elders are you with me see he's a leader he has motivation god is motivated for us now brother titus you know where uh wanting to choose a king londo de escojera he says stay away from slothful people they say because we don't have enough sufficient because we didn't see our future so we can't give the future someone else will desire he can't give us enough because he runs out did we listen didn't see through his future so he won't ever have enough for your future he cannot give you the future you desire hermanos the natural's the type of the spirits and our pastor said this is why that's why this is for serious people only how serious does it sound i will go que tan seriamente but it's not what she said i'm trying to put it but um rebecca didn't hesitate no gracias she wasn't asked twice like brother tyler is asking me to preach and they didn't ask her again that's why brother branham says in choosing a bribe if the if god speaks to you i don't know what would have happened but find a leader perez said our pastor not someone that lives check to check but god is abundant god has everlasting going back to proverbs regressando proverbios solomon's mother is saying la madre de salomones give not thy strength unto woman nor thy ways to that with which destroyeth kings amen so what are god's ways what are these other spouses ways on los caminos you know we say we have one spouse we say that only god is our husband but brother branham says it burns amen so we need to be testing all these other spouses all these other pretenders is pretending you know i i live in my car yo boy amicaro and i have pretenders on youtube trying to make me hear their music pretend we have to like to show the bachelor asi como el prorama el sol we have to test all of them amen see who can offer us the most what is what are the ways of these pretenders and where's god's future [Music] open thy mouth right judge righteously and plead the cause of the poor and needy see solomon's solomon's mother is saying that a king watches them that can't care for themselves sounds good huh is it to find a man of his word that every day says something different a person that isn't responsible personally god has to take care of his family amen god's word never changes and god has always been on time and god has taken care of us and we can't take care anybody amen amen [Music] and and lastly a humble man not a prideful man a humble king um prideful man someone that is humble unbreakable doesn't care about serving the rest they can stoop down the person that is amen amen someone that says someone that doesn't say forgive me that they know everything is a danger for marriage you know sometimes i feel like i know more than the interpreters but then god humbles me and i mess up too perovius amen amen but god humbled himself philippians 2 8 says and being found now i'd like to close with a short story story about it you can see it both ways choosing a husband or a wife brother branham says i used to go with a rancher that work that i work with to buy cattle um i'm gonna read it in spanish so you can read it in english and i noticed the old fellow always looking right into the face of a hither before he went to biting bidding bidding and it is and if she looked all right in stature statured and looked her in the face and looking and sometimes he'll shake his head and walked away and i said jeff i want to ask you something bill he said say on bill premiers then i said why do you always look that cow in in the face buena pesada she looks all right a good a good heavy cow el dijo yo he said i will tell you you got a lot to learn i don't care how she's made up she might be beef plum to the hoop but if she's got that wild stare in her face don't you never bite her she'll never be a mommy to her calf and said that's the reason she's fat us la swelter all that blue stuff over the top of her eyes i don't care how much and television or paper says it's purdy es la cosa it is the most horrible looking cafe visto that i've ever seen and in my life i wanted to share this [Applause] because it happened without trying to offend anybody i follow appearance of the look como este hombre jeff just like this man perfect he thought he had a cow a perfect cow perot but he had a wild stare this case brother branham says when you see that wild stare and that is get away from it my time is over and it might be it'll be continued [Applause] god bless our brother isano [Music] it's a blessing to be here amen in the book of genesis chapter 24 verse 40. hallelujah glory amen glory to god hey man it is a scene and it says like this is a [Music] and he was in the home of rebecca's brother and mother estos and so here is eliezer telling the family of rebecca responding and he said unto me the lord before whom i was we'll send his angel with thee prospered and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my father's home after the servant had spoken to rebecca and they ate and drank when with those men that accompanied him and they slept he said and he said send me away unto my master entonces and and her brother and her mother said a few days at the at least ten after that she shall go yeah let's digo i may go to my master we will call the damsel and acquire her [Music] yeah responding and she said i will go man if we can please bow our heads and pray heavenly father [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen so the title which we placed who will you be choosing [Music] [Music] i don't believe i'm the best example brothers but as you know many of you know i departed from church and stopping and going to church [Music] in the bible abraham made a decision he had to find a pride for isaac he did not want him to marry with the canaanites daughters that's right here man so la semana pasada last week i was sick um i had to preach with our brother fidel avila [Music] and i said who's going to preach for me and he said god will provide hey thanks be to god brother santana visit us and god bless brothers and he and as we know the messenger of the faithful servant is the prophet is the prophet william mary and branham man amen rebecca rebecca nosotros the bride of the lord jesus christ isaac isaac it's the lord jesus christ amen amen amen i asked the lord lord what do you want me to preach and i had a message according or about a [Music] [Music] and he gave me this 1959. the servant wasn't satisfied here with just going el caria algun tipo de garantea he wanted some kind of assurance el sion sistiendo and he kept questioning quest what if the woman won't come when so then when he heard from his master's lips from his master's lips the angel of god shall be go before you oh ami i like that so much brother branham says implementing it just fits my case the angel of the lord shall go before you yes we have this message man so here the messenger is lord what do i do later just give her 10 days to make up her mind she is the one that's going to have to make up her mind give her 10 days so the true servant the moral servant said said no let her go now so they decide for rebecca you can't take somebody else had said it's going to be your attitude towards the message that you hear man we're in a youth a little bit more later on brother branham says rebecca now what did rebecca say hey she said joey i ordered i will go [Music] and later on he says if you're ordained to eternal life they shall know it
