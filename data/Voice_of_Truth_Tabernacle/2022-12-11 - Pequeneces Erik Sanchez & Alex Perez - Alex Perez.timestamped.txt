[19:20] it's at your reach

[25:01] a new waking up where we can see
[25:07] each and every one of his um Miracles
[25:10] yes and one of them is to be able to see
[25:14] you
[25:16] I also give thanks to God
[25:19] foreign
[25:42] to make this Thanksgiving known
[26:19] the word of God says like this is
[26:32] for whoever despite this day as small
[26:33] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[26:35] see the plummet in the hand observable
[26:37] with those seven they are the eyes of
[26:39] the Lord which run to and fro through
[26:41] the whole Earth
[26:44] a second scripture in the Book of Micah
[26:47] 5 2.
[26:49] Micah chapter 5 verse 2.
[26:57] Israel
[27:15] though they'll be little among the under
[27:17] thousands of Judah a year out of thee
[27:19] shall come shall he come forth unto me
[27:22] that is to be ruler in Israel whose
[27:24] goings forth have been from old from
[27:26] Everlasting
[27:27] let's pray Brothers
[27:29] Lord Jesus Christ
[27:32] giver and creator of Life
[27:36] first and foremost we give you thanks
[27:39] for every one of your marvels of your
[27:42] miracles
[27:43] for your grace
[28:00] moving freely
[28:03] take away any incorrect word from my
[28:06] mouth and that my brothers
[28:09] but they don't take me by what I say
[28:12] what I'm trying to convey what I'm
[28:14] trying to express
[28:16] thank you for everything congregations
[28:35] and along with my brother Alex
[28:38] this small talk came to me pick and
[28:41] yeses small things yeah
[28:50] um
[28:52] if you can put the image up
[28:57] you can put the image up on the screen
[29:03] okay
[29:05] let's see if you can see it
[29:07] is
[29:10] [Music]
[29:13] this is simply just a small diagram or
[29:16] an image and this is
[29:29] amongst others right
[29:32] that was before they were taken into
[29:34] captivity
[29:35] and one of these prophets or some of
[29:39] these prophets they were able to see
[29:41] that first temple
[29:43] Solomon constructed right and then comes
[29:48] these profits that were prophets during
[29:51] the time of captivity is
[29:55] Jeremiah yes
[30:05] um they took them captive
[30:16] and he lived there for around 60 years
[30:20] and when he leaves there he's uh he's an
[30:22] elder already
[30:23] but then he comes
[30:26] or then comes the the prophets from the
[30:29] post captivity
[30:31] and that's um
[30:39] now these two haggai and Zechariah
[30:43] and they're able to see
[30:46] or their their task was to encourage the
[30:49] people
[30:50] for the Reconstruction
[30:52] to encourage
[30:57] encourage them to forget what happened
[31:03] [Music]
[31:08] not be
[31:10] regretting
[31:12] but they that they look forward
[31:16] that they have a new vision but that I
[31:19] want to meet it right now
[31:22] the book of haggai is and Zachariah
[31:27] they speak about a very special person
[31:30] a person is right
[31:37] we've just read the scripture
[31:41] that scripture that says
[31:45] it says
[31:51] for who has despised the day of small
[31:53] things for they shall rejoice
[32:00] and this captures my attention
[32:03] if you can put the following image
[32:07] iberan
[32:09] Ada
[32:11] and shall see the plumber in the hand
[32:13] observable
[32:16] he is also a type
[32:18] of the seventh messenger of the seventh
[32:23] Angels
[32:25] what is a plummet
[32:27] made it
[32:35] construction a plummet is a basic
[32:38] instrument used in construction
[32:40] work in construction
[32:42] they know what a plummet is
[32:46] also a tool that's used in high
[32:49] Precision
[32:50] it doesn't need any kind of adjusting
[32:53] with this weekend
[32:57] we can see if the if the wall is
[32:59] completely vertical straight up and down
[33:11] if it's not off to the side a little if
[33:14] it's not off center is
[33:19] also being the seventh angel
[33:22] s
[33:25] placed in charge it says
[33:34] [Music]
[33:36] in other words
[33:47] just as the seventh angel did
[33:51] because there came a moment
[33:54] when the word of God is
[33:58] derailed in the last days
[34:28] in the wrong way
[34:39] they they
[34:41] the Gracia this is a message of Grace
[34:44] but it's also a message
[34:46] where it reconstructs everything
[34:50] where all that had that had gone off to
[34:52] the side
[34:55] look many times
[35:01] at the plans of God
[35:03] we want them to align with us with our
[35:07] way of living but it's not that way it's
[35:10] us
[35:16] what has already been spoken glory to
[35:19] God Amen brother
[35:21] now look
[35:24] but
[35:25] there's another thing here that captures
[35:27] my attention
[35:29] in Zechariah 4 10.
[35:37] um
[35:38] priesthood last Sunday with her brothers
[35:45] for who had despised the day of small
[35:48] things for they shall rejoice
[35:52] that's where we're going to basis our
[35:54] thought off of
[35:58] when they begin to rebuild the Temple
[36:02] those Elders
[36:04] that they were able to see the temple of
[36:07] Solomons
[36:12] because they they begin to see that that
[36:14] temples
[36:16] was buildings
[36:19] it didn't look like anything they had
[36:21] seen before
[36:25] and that's when they begin to
[36:29] unappreciate
[36:32] those Small Beginnings those small
[36:34] things
[36:37] we as Christians
[36:41] we we serve a great God
[36:44] a majestic a God that's powerful
[36:49] a god that is
[36:53] however God even God
[36:56] with all of this greatness
[36:58] all of this
[37:01] he has a great love for lopeño for the
[37:04] small things for the things that are
[37:07] small
[37:08] he puts his eye
[37:12] on small people
[37:14] in small places
[37:18] including the son of God
[37:22] he didn't equal himself to be the same
[37:25] as God
[37:26] as something to grab a hold of but he
[37:30] made himself small
[37:31] to give us salvation
[37:35] look
[37:37] the kingdom of God or the work of God
[37:42] it doesn't start in the great things
[37:45] or in the greatest thing but it starts
[37:48] in the smallest Community God begins in
[37:51] the smallest in the smallest of things
[37:54] his kingdom
[37:56] and that in one day
[37:59] that it would cover the entire Earth
[38:03] it begins with an elder and a sterile
[38:06] woman with Abraham and Sarah
[38:10] and with the promise Isaac
[38:16] do you see how God starts with the
[38:18] smallest things
[38:19] he doesn't unappreciate
[38:22] Abraham being an idolater
[38:25] a bit of that right
[38:30] he also starts and it grows
[38:34] his people
[38:36] a small people right
[38:42] look what Deuteronomy 7 7 says
[39:00] the Lord did not set his love upon you
[39:03] nor choose you because you you were more
[39:05] a number than any people for you were
[39:07] the fewest of our people
[39:22] but because the Lord loved you and
[39:24] because you would keep the oath which he
[39:26] had sworn unto your fathers have the
[39:27] Lord brought you out with the mighty
[39:29] hand and with and redeemed you out of
[39:31] the house of bond men from the hand of
[39:32] pharaoh king of Egypt
[39:36] now look
[39:39] at how God starts from the smallest
[39:41] thing is
[39:45] and he he elects these 12 common men
[39:49] ombres
[39:50] these illiterate
[39:53] without having studied
[39:56] but he takes him to something right
[39:58] right
[40:15] and
[40:19] this end of the year this time of the
[40:23] end of the year
[40:24] Christmas is drawing close
[40:29] icosas there are things
[40:33] that we get more importance too but we
[40:37] forget the small things
[40:39] we forget the small things
[40:42] and we focusas Grandes on the great
[40:46] things on the bigger things
[40:50] but God says
[40:54] truly the day of small things is coming
[40:57] but up until that point
[40:59] let's not let's not disregard
[41:02] but they are small things
[41:04] and look
[41:07] mm-hmm
[41:09] sort of I will observe a bell termina
[41:12] the construction he finishes building
[41:14] the Temple
[41:16] but God Tiempo Express
[41:19] afterwards afterwards
[41:25] amen he sends
[41:29] the greatest of his temples
[41:32] and the person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:35] significant
[42:33] in flesh
[42:35] yeah I'll see us in my door
[42:41] is preparados these men were prepared
[42:46] they they unappreciated or despised
[42:49] thank you
[42:55] they couldn't see
[42:58] that God was going to dwell
[43:01] but there it was there was God crying
[43:07] and they couldn't see it
[43:10] but you know
[43:14] his children
[43:16] they will see
[43:18] those small things
[43:25] I perceive that you're a prophet is
[43:30] my parents and my ancestors speak of a
[43:32] promised Messiah
[43:54] of Christ
[44:02] just because anything is small
[44:04] okay
[44:05] perceptively that is not noticeable
[44:08] Jesus
[44:11] but Jesus said that even a sparrows
[44:20] OS
[44:23] who has two of them sold for a fourth of
[44:26] a penny and not one of those little
[44:27] birds could fall to the ground without
[44:28] God knowing it Joseph
[44:31] God notices little things
[44:35] how many times you say
[44:39] I can't do very much about it
[44:42] the conditions of today
[44:47] but just a little kind word to someone
[44:50] an invitation a little testimony
[44:54] little kind Smiles
[44:57] or agreeing to a pastor significance
[45:02] might mean more than you think it does
[45:15] the late King George visited the
[45:17] provinces
[45:20] and while he was in the province of
[45:22] British Columbia
[45:25] all the teachers turned the children out
[45:27] from school
[45:29] that they might go and see the king
[45:33] and being that His Highness the King
[45:36] was there
[45:42] why they they all had the flagship the
[45:45] tools play their patriotic feelings
[45:46] towards him
[45:49] is
[45:54] the little children were supposed to
[45:56] weigh the flag as the king passed by
[45:59] and after the king would pass back
[46:05] the teacher came out and found one
[46:07] little bitty girl standing over on the
[46:09] corner
[46:11] with her little head against a Telegraph
[46:17] and we've been like her childish heart
[46:19] would break
[46:21] and the teacher went to her para
[46:24] controller to comfort her and she said
[46:28] what's the matter honey
[46:30] could you not wave your flag
[46:33] foreign
[47:02] she said I did Wave My Flag and I did
[47:05] see the king but I was so little that
[47:07] the king didn't see me
[47:09] but it's not that way with Christ
[47:17] how insignificant
[47:20] he sees every move
[47:37] Lord
[47:39] Hallelujah
[47:40] he disposed he disposed of all of his
[47:44] greatness
[47:47] to give salvation to us
[47:50] that's not let's not despise
[47:53] the the Small Things
[47:59] great things come forth yes God bless
[48:02] you Brothers
[48:05] [Applause]
[48:09] invite you to stand so you can stretch
[48:13] foreign
[48:20] who has believed our report
[48:24] is
[48:27] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[48:29] revealed
[48:33] is
[48:45] for he shall grow up before him as a
[48:48] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[48:49] ground he shall hath no form nor
[48:52] comeliness and when we shall see him
[48:54] there is no beauty that we should desire
[48:55] him is
[49:05] Ro
[49:09] femenos presiado
[49:12] he uses spies and rejected of men a Man
[49:15] of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we
[49:17] hid as it were our faces from him he was
[49:20] despised and we esteemed him not amen
[49:23] you may be seated
[49:25] is
[50:26] their mentality and way of seeing things
[50:28] have changed
[50:32] they no longer seen the second temple as
[50:34] something great
[50:45] they told himself this is all we've done
[50:47] is this is
[51:16] and God doesn't see much value in it all
[51:19] right
[51:25] their perspective was changing
[51:28] the leaders
[51:30] they were changing foreign
[51:47] but there would come a day
[52:11] it's a time in which people are
[52:13] preparing for Christmas
[52:15] and it's impressive to see the people
[52:19] of what they give priority to
[52:22] [Music]
[52:48] does the sister not buy anything
[52:50] different whoa
[52:52] come on it's astonishing to see how the
[52:56] people
[52:59] Nothing of importance
[53:01] [Music]
[53:05] perhaps
[53:09] some good tools to use
[53:22] and although it works they want
[53:25] something new
[53:30] foreign
[53:34] and the things that actually have value
[53:38] we see them as small
[53:45] brother Brandon says in the message why
[53:48] little Beth for him
[53:58] he says I'm so glad that even just a
[54:01] little insignificant things in the Bible
[54:02] is
[54:05] the insignificant things in the Bible
[54:07] means so much
[54:36] that God sees is great
[54:39] the prophet continues to say
[54:42] foreign
[54:57] ER matters of the law
[55:00] because
[55:09] he's quoting a scripture of how the
[55:11] people in the time that were there
[55:14] they were giving so much importance to
[55:16] the temple they cannot systems but they
[55:19] weren't focusing on the small things
[55:25] they had seen the first temple is
[55:32] how was the church how's the people
[55:34] going to go to this miserable
[55:37] don't we have that same mentality
[55:39] sometimes
[55:47] together
[56:23] because
[56:35] what you did yesterday at night
[56:40] then when you're in church what do you
[56:42] do in church
[56:44] sometimes these brothers that matter
[56:47] more
[56:48] and they have a greater impact
[56:52] are you with me this morning
[57:03] that he chose a small place a small town
[57:06] to live in or to be born
[57:08] God is so simple yes
[57:10] [Applause]
[57:13] that he chose to both reveal himself and
[57:16] hide himself in Simplicity
[57:18] God is so simple
[57:22] yes that people overlooked that
[57:25] simplicity
[57:28] foreign
[57:38] what God is doing
[57:44] Israel when the people of Israel is
[57:51] that was going to come and deliver them
[57:53] from slaves
[57:55] God sends to them a baby I'll go
[57:58] insignificantly something insignificant
[58:02] look Brothers
[58:11] sometimes we we get Pride for it
[58:16] we both because we know the message
[58:18] because we know
[58:21] God this is so true
[58:40] trying to point ourselves
[58:46] trying to say that this is a mystery
[58:48] well really it's something very simple
[58:54] it looks as though it's simple but it's
[58:56] something very profound very deep
[58:59] inside many people said
[59:02] and I asked the question what is the
[59:05] message
[59:08] what is the message
[59:11] where is the message
[59:27] where's the message this morning amen
[59:30] foreign
[59:37] stop doing
[59:43] who has believed our report
[59:50] people were unable to understand the
[59:52] reports
[59:54] what God wanted to transmites
[1:00:01] something that must be announced
[1:00:09] because it wasn't the way that they
[1:00:11] wanted it to come
[1:00:12] on
[1:00:23] we say no it's because
[1:00:32] how does God have this program
[1:00:35] and it simply just doesn't fit in our
[1:00:38] mind
[1:00:43] s
[1:00:47] they were unable to imagine unable to
[1:00:49] capture in their minds
[1:00:53] that God was changing in dispensation
[1:01:04] that God changes
[1:01:07] but his not his mind
[1:01:12] dispensations
[1:01:20] that's why I can't stay with the message
[1:01:22] of the past
[1:01:36] you know when God is changing
[1:01:44] we're living in the end times
[1:01:47] and there are people are waiting for
[1:01:49] something that's already here amen
[1:01:54] ities
[1:02:06] sometimes we don't understand such small
[1:02:08] things
[1:02:09] this is message Brothers
[1:02:31] he says in the message or he says simple
[1:02:37] he says God hiding himself
[1:02:43] Siempre acido
[1:02:46] enumildad the way that God works with
[1:02:48] the man has always been in humility
[1:02:55] you're in the wrong church but I'm not
[1:02:57] going to say that is
[1:03:07] for people that are simple
[1:03:11] listen
[1:03:13] prophetic but with a prophetic ear
[1:03:16] oh my
[1:03:19] God thank you so much
[1:03:25] simply it's not that you come with your
[1:03:27] cheapest clothes
[1:03:30] try to look nice
[1:03:37] I've seen so much
[1:03:40] I've seen people that dress so nicely
[1:03:42] that don't have a dollar in their
[1:03:43] pocketives
[1:03:46] another
[1:03:50] um
[1:03:54] yeah it's okay
[1:03:58] let's look at what brother Branham says
[1:04:06] the way that God works with the man has
[1:04:08] always been in humility
[1:04:15] he never works with a man in great
[1:04:17] theological terms that's where the
[1:04:20] problem lies with us
[1:04:27] the religious churches
[1:04:31] they're pulling their hairs out
[1:04:35] over theological things foreign
[1:04:55] over one doctrinal point
[1:05:02] tell me of an occasion no it was that
[1:05:05] way he's never done it
[1:05:09] He makes himself simple
[1:05:11] but man
[1:05:14] wants to make him complicated
[1:05:21] He makes himself great by making himself
[1:05:24] humble it's good
[1:05:27] and that's how God works
[1:05:32] God works in simplicity
[1:05:36] and this is
[1:05:37] sometimes we forget that Brothers
[1:05:41] sometimes we get the spirit of
[1:05:44] oh I'm of the message
[1:05:47] I have the highest level of revelation
[1:05:51] today
[1:06:01] because the people of that time
[1:06:06] they were never able to understand that
[1:06:08] the deities
[1:06:10] would be in a man
[1:06:15] is
[1:06:17] people were looking for something
[1:06:19] Supernatural
[1:06:26] would be incarnated in a man
[1:06:30] in the in the boy
[1:06:33] how tremendous
[1:06:35] God hiding himself in simplicity
[1:06:39] says
[1:06:43] I don't have too much time studying this
[1:06:46] message
[1:06:48] I know that there are more theologians
[1:06:59] when I started I went directly to the
[1:07:02] seals because I wanted the The Good the
[1:07:04] the more the meat
[1:07:35] it's been by your grace
[1:08:15] and you called it son
[1:08:19] and you came to redeem me
[1:08:30] what are the small things for you
[1:08:35] sufficiency come forward I'm closing
[1:08:39] is
[1:08:41] they couldn't understand the deity
[1:08:47] because as a deity revealed itself
[1:08:51] it wasn't in the way in which they
[1:08:53] expected it to be
[1:08:57] foreign
[1:09:02] [Music]
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:39] I'm at nowhere
[1:09:42] sometimes we create
[1:09:45] complexes and things
[1:09:49] you create your own world that God has
[1:09:51] never created
[1:09:56] your own ideology yes sir
[1:10:01] God has nothing to do with it yes
[1:10:13] God says
[1:10:29] he begins to take out what he has not
[1:10:32] created
[1:10:33] sir
[1:10:36] Tiempo navigo and then this Christmas
[1:10:38] time
[1:10:41] [Music]
[1:10:43] do you want your house
[1:10:45] with your declarations that's okay

[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:41] we're gonna have a greater impact
[1:11:45] if people were to tell you
[1:11:47] I see something different
[1:11:53] you don't celebrate Christmas like the
[1:11:55] rest of
[1:11:58] it
[1:11:59] may God help us in these times
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:08] with the spirit of the world
[1:12:11] this
[1:12:13] I'll be closing brother Branham says
[1:12:17] [Music]
[1:12:20] this deity is in you
[1:12:26] I'll repeat it he says that the deity is
[1:12:29] in us
[1:12:30] and that's what they couldn't understand
[1:12:34] that's what people can understand
[1:12:38] that's what people can understand in our
[1:12:40] profit
[1:12:42] they couldn't
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:48] in the denominational Church
[1:12:51] they can accept that God manifests
[1:12:54] himself in flesh
[1:12:56] over 2000 years
[1:13:04] and that's the that's the wrong part
[1:13:06] that's the area is that they have a
[1:13:08] historian
[1:13:10] they deny that the day of today
[1:13:14] God continues to manifest himself in
[1:13:17] flesh
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:20] a little more in the world
