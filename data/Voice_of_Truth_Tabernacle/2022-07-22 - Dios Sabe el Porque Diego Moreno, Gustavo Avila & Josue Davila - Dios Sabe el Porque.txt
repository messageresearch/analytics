father's love [Music] and think about his grace [Music] there's love and think about his goodness and think about his grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen if you can open your scriptures with me to the book of exodus chapter 12 verse 31 you can say amen when you have it and he called for moses and aaron by night and said rise up and get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of israel and go serve the lord as you have said e is we'll go ahead and jump down to verse 35. it says like this dc i see and the children of israel did according to the word of moses and they borrowed of the egyptians jews of silver angels of gold and raymond we just want to give you thanks for now allowing us another opportunity to be able to be in your house it's uh it's always a privilege to be here lord and today we just ask you to speak to us the title and that ties in perfectly here with the situation we just read about you see that that fur it's estimated that for 215 years the israelites were enslaved to the egyptians amen would have wanted an old i would have wanted to know the why man i would have wanted to know why i was in bondage for such a long time when god had promised my ancestors i would i would be an owner of a land amen and this this wasn't a part of the promise yes that although you you might be in bondage today because if you're a child god frees you many people say that god will take you as you are but just because god takes you as you are it doesn't mean he wants to leave you that way you see that they amen it came to a point to where the the world brothers the the magicians it came to the point that god had to divide between his true children and those that that were just pretenders amen and it's going to come to the point where the world is going to have to say that this is none other than the finger of god amen amen that's what brother brown says that faith is is the only only explanation you have for the situation is amen how many believe we are living in a greater age amen it's a greater age es because it's and it's uh it's a lot harder to believe because we don't see it yes difficult amen i believe that was just god paying his people for what they'd went through but it was also god it was also god preparing them for the next thing you see because they were going to need strength to build they were going to need to show us that he's making god is giving us things that money can't buy amen all of all of the all of of what we have brothers all of that is going towards building a better tabernacle because you know what they did you know what the israelites did with the with the goal that they received they used it to build a tabernacle a more perfect tabernacle we spoke about how how the israelites were were enslaved for 215 years that was an urgency there brothers and that's that's an urgency is something that demands your attention there was no time to be packed they couldn't they couldn't go and get their maletas and pack all their belongings they had to go brothers and there wasn't time to pack pride amen there wasn't time to be lazy hey man brothers your brother couldn't be packing you you have to go yourself your brother couldn't have to be packing your brother couldn't carry you you have to go yourself and then in today's in today's day there's no urgency there's no urgency because we don't see it did we do it on our own amen amen and many of the people they took egypt with him some of them just wanted the blessing of being able to leave that lifestyle inside into that amen amen when uh when pharaoh when moses approached pharaoh moses asked him and by this time the plagues had happened and each time that the place happens moses would ask pharaoh you would say to him you would say when when when do you want this place to be gone the amen when do you when do you guys want sin to leave your lives you want it today thing that's that's super that stands out a lot is that god let pharaoh choose the time that he wanted the place to leave amen amen hallelujah hallelujah ah god is good amen amen it's good amen everything that all of the trials that the people of israel went through it gave them enough to make it through les dios sufficiente para poder pasar and uh that's something that we don't understand sometimes that god gives us exactly what we need because god i believe that god is a god of of of partying amen and he just wants us to go through it but there's no that's all i have brothers [Applause] first of all i'd like to greet our brother edgar his wife sister and they're both sons brian and brandon god bless them greatly i was able to meet them yesterday they told me they drove 72 hours here you go wow and i said wow i live two minutes here yes and it's just anything for me learn a little of what our brother did the panel from so far knowing where the life is and to obtain that life god bless honor privilege to have you with us in english and i'll be switching to english hey man it's been a while now [Music] quickly like to go to exodus chapter 14. speaking unto the children of israel that they turn and encamp before haharaf between mcdowell and the sea over against balsa fong before it shall yi encamp by the sea dialogues of the children of israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness has shut them in and i will be honored upon pharaoh glorification upon all his hosts and that the egyptians may know that i am the lord and they did also may god add blessing to that god is leading the people of israel god understand god fully because if we try to understand how god works would go completely insane because god cannot be put for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him a question on the face of the earth and tell god what to do but i simply believe a greater purpose a greater purpose in themselves and young people i myself put myself there closed-minded [Music] is that not enough is way gondolone commander was going back to egypt that's what the devil wants to make you think but again we could stay in that constant mindset if he questioned him throughout the whole process he would have kept on questioning him throughout the whole thing that's every young person every adult yes it happens has and this is a hard question he completely forgot himself forgot his whole mindset mentality and that's what god wants from each other that's the only way he can work through it let's go to what our prophet says you've got to forget all you've ever known in your own knowledge to know christ to apply you just come childlike and accept more humble and believe it and by faith es these things are common questions and then look what the prophet says is professional very important it's more important not what you no longer can't by to be as a little boy nino i i didn't know anything else that's what my dad told me christ didn't know anything else to a certain point until what the father revealed and moses didn't know anything at all but to the moment hasta momento where god brought him to you and he simply had to act he simply said take that in your hands [Music] talking to [Music] egypt was done i am with you your story amen lord jesus christ amen [Music] 14 verse 3 13. exodus 14 13. can you stand with me brother and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will shoot to you to you today for the egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them again no more no more forever the lord shall shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace israel and the lord said unto moses wherefore christ down to me speak unto the children of israel that he go forward but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on the dry ground through the midst of the sea seated brother [Music] jericho the people of israel and the bible says that the lord hardened pharaoh's heart israel to go and persecute the people of israel all right um wilderness and that's how many times we are and i i make an example of myself sometimes the life we love i would
