IES whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven that sounds very similar hello and then verse 33 says whosoever shall deny me before man him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven if we do not place them in the right I think we can confuse ourselves a little uh we could think when it says he that confesses me before men [Music] you might say well what does that mean to confess before man significance simply mean to say I'm a Christian significa Jesus I mean Jesus saves me significa Jesus does it mean to say what Jesus says confess what he said what does it means him before men and the next question is what does it mean to deny him before doesn't mean to make a mistake significa doesn't mean to say something against him I think there's a very known story on Peter Pedro denied the Lord Jesus Christ if we take the scripture of denying him literally and don't says Peter is a perfect example of someone and if that's the way Jesus Jesus should deny him he says it says Matthew 26. came unto him saying thou also was with Jesus of Galilee notice the picture here Jesus uh juicio he was taken to judgment [Applause] and near there is Peter Pedro Peter will never or deny you mean I'll give my own life for you slice an ear off a soldier Pedro Peters apparently so brave was so close when Jesus was being judged and outside in the palace was Peter yes now also was with Jesus you are one of them how horrible and when he was gone out into the porch another made song and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth and again he's a knight with an he promised it that's tremendous if this is not worthy of Jesus denying him I don't know what else is he promised he had no business with him how horrible how horrible to here Peter say I don't know this man foreign oh 74 73 and after a while came up to him they sat stood by and said Peter surely thou also are one of them for thy speech be wraith thee and and then he then began he took courage what did Peter says that he cursed and swore for the third time his Lord his God make him seem so dirty that he couldn't be with Jesus what did he say s you can just imagine I'm sure saying I know not the man and immediately the car crew and then it says that Peter went and webbed bitterly now I ask you has anyone done something like that we've complained so terrible like Peter yeah a bunch of Hypocrites be no Pastor I've never heard anyone deny Jesus like Peter did there was something that he deserved [Music] Jesus if someone deserves to be denied by Jesus this would be the example this would be the case he should be the person Jesus denies nevertheless we know the stories that after the resurrection Jesus Jesus looks for Peter himself right looks for Peter himself do you love me what Peter had done Peter do you love it feel my flock and those so what of the scriptures if they denied me Matthew 10 says anyone that denies meant before men okay or they're Peter Peter qualifies I will also deny him before my Father which is in heaven with Peter amen amen Mateo Diaz Matthew 10. now we read from verse however therefore shall confess let's read before the entire chapter it says these 12 Jesus and forth and commanded them saying now the first we read the one that says if anyone confessed me before man is part of these instructions saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand in foreign for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will Scorch you in their synagogues verse 19 but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what you shall speak verse and the brothers shall deliver up the brother to death and the Father the child and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death notice what Jesus does he's preparing don't matter so much foreign now we're getting closer to are not Two Sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your fathers but the very hairs of your head are all numbers it's like Jesus is giving them confidence they're going to kick you out [Music] don't be afraid of them for your father is watching you know so 31 says you are of more value than many sparrows that's 31. Grande I think it's a bigger challenge to say that you're satanic and you worship than to say you're Christians yeah right there's no dangerous but there's no danger Jesus is speaking after coming in today before he tells them whosoever confessed me before men before he says these words but they're not alone foreign think a little on job remember job now remember adios the offer saying gave God saying comes to God and tells him the reason job praises the reason why job is happy to confess the reason why it's easy for him to come to church and sing to you and speak about you is because you have them well protected well protected but give them to me for a moment give him to me for a moment and we'll see if he denies your name is this is where he would prove to stand for God or not and I believe every Son of God has to be tested it's in the times of the trials we will show if we're going to stand for God or if we won't easy to say we all love Christ it's easy to say we love Christ just let the devil take everything away to go against you nothing goes against you yes [Applause] your retreat there your name I hope to job his work was taken away his income or earnings were taken his children were taken away his family was taken Health was taken away and the Bible says specifically says the last verse and all this job sin not nor charge God foolishly and all this is nor charge God foolishly how tremendous I'm going to tell you something love you those confessions all of eternity I believe that God is confession writes those confessions Paul Pablo Timothy 4 9. second Timothy 4 9. he was in prison thought he was going to die he didn't die in that place but he thought he was going to is and what he thought were his last letters to Timothy he wrote what he thought were his last name he was in prison it says to thy diligence to come shortly unto me how lonely did Paul feel Paras to ask Timothy to come see him for Dimas hath forsaken Amanda issalonica having loved this present world and is departed unto thessalonica only Luke is with me this is me for this ministry then verse 14 says Alejandro calderero Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil verse 16. my first answer the Primera when I try to plea my case because he went to court he was being accused he says in my at my first answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me well verse 17 says now withstanding the Lord stood with me this is what it's about the Lord stood with me is the Lord stood with me when everyone has criticized and strengthened me the preaching and that all the Gentiles and I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion they will not on him velocity you deliver me from this situation for we were not Brethren no queremos King no race have you ignorance of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were oppressed and what we read it and we say well glory to God for Paulo he wanted to make sure it was written God wanted to make sure it was written we were pressed out of measure above strength oh was so great that my strength would not were not enough have you ever felt that way the trial is so tough this is above strength you've been looking foreign he will do it foreign algunos de Nosotros some of us Dolores indescribles we'll have to go through Indescribable pain the religious but the fact that you still stand with Christ in mediator in the midst of everything is the greatest confession you can have foreign not complaining no no not letting go of the plow preparation but standing beside God sometimes we say Lord how can I stand beside you the way I am how Lord Pedro there was Peter come up how can I stand with you Lord how can I stand with you but Jesus knew Peter will stand for him Jesus knew although he messed up will not stay down forever we all know the story at the end of Peter's life says that he was fleeing from Jerusalem and while he was fleeing he saw Jesus in a vision and Jesus was going the opposite way Peter was Jesus was going to Jerusalem Peter says Jesus where are you going Jesus says to be crucified again Peter understood that it was his job to take that place for Jesus this is and face the ones that were looking for him and he stood up for Jesus I'm not worthy they said crucified so be crucified like my Lord crucified crucify me upside down Pedro and Peter was crucified upside down here stood up for the Lord Jesus Peter confessed Jesus while they crucified him he said he is my lord for me he stood up for me I'll stand for him when you stand for him Jesus says I will not blow out your name he will have reasons to blot out my name is I believe he has many of them how many can say the same he's got reasons to blot out my name but if you stand for him if you believe in him despite everything if your life still says God I love you in the midst of tribulation Jesus Jesus says I will now blot out your name I believe when he says I will not blot out your name what I understand is that he could blot out my name that I've done enough for my name to be bloody but because I'll stand for you your name although you're like Peter because I know that you love me musicians can come he said Revelation 3 5 says he's not overcometh the same shall be clothed in white Rain Man and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father is and before his angels whosoever therefore shall confess me before men I confess also before my Father which is in heaven I know you can think about the future but brother Brown says that God is interceding for us the Bible says that Jesus is between us and God and brother Branham says whenever you confess something Jesus says Jesus confesses that to the father you could okay I believe that in those moments Jesus spoke with his disciples he was telling them you will go through a lot status is deliver you up moment you will go through tough times but confess me there confess that I am your lord and I will confess before my father and before my angels and I imagine Jesus saying now you'll help them Angeles Angels Go Aid my son give them strength give them courage tell them they'll make it give them the strength they don't have here please stand give him the mercy Jesus I see Jesus saying father extend your mercy oh brother not sure if you knew that Mercy now but I do father extend your mercy too don't give them judgment mercy of your forgiveness Mr and this night doesn't matter where you are look important what matters is what you confess When You Believe if you confess Lord You're My Savior My Everything forgives my iniquities that's where Jesus is [Music] I need that Mercy [Music] stands foreign foreign as long as you're with me and I was you is [Music] what the Lord stood with me but the
