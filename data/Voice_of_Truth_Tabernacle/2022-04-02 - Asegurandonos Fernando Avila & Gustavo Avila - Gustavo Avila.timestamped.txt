[21:43] it's a privilege for me to speak tonight
[21:47] the word of god tonight
[21:50] along with my brother gustavo
[21:52] gustavo so i might ask you if we could
[21:53] please uh open up our bibles to genesis
[21:56] 25 federer
[22:01] verse 21 and 23.
[22:08] genesis 25
[22:16] and it says like this it is see and i
[22:19] sagan treated the lord for his wife
[22:22] because she was barren and the lord was
[22:24] entreated of him and rebecca his wife
[22:26] conceived
[22:35] and the children struggled together
[22:38] within her and she said if it be so why
[22:41] am i thus
[22:43] and she went to inquire of the lord
[22:53] and the lord and the lord said unto her
[22:55] two nations are in thy womb and two
[22:57] manner of people shall be separated from
[22:59] thy bowels and the one people shall be
[23:02] stronger than the other people and the
[23:03] elders shall serve the younger
[23:05] responders
[23:20] and we
[23:34] you
[23:47] father bless everyone here
[23:59] amen amen amen amen amen you may go
[24:02] ahead and take a seat brothers
[24:05] uh so we're still with the the bible
[24:07] characters
[24:10] yeah with the jacob and esau
[24:14] i know there's been two fridays with
[24:16] this with these characters
[24:20] uh so so we'll continue with them
[24:24] and as we read right now
[24:30] you know esau being the firstborn
[24:33] el canacio primero the bible describes
[24:36] him as a hunter
[24:39] a skilled man
[24:42] very manly and hairy
[24:44] salvage and jacob was the opposite jacob
[24:48] you know it says that he was a uh like a
[24:51] like a homebody
[24:52] he just dwelled in tents
[24:57] you know but the bible says as we read
[24:59] in verse 23 i believe
[25:03] that these two
[25:05] were already fighting in the womb
[25:12] and esau the firstborn el primogenito
[25:17] uh well he came out first obviously
[25:21] but the interesting thing here is that
[25:23] jacob
[25:26] while
[25:30] it says the bible says that jacob
[25:33] took out his hand
[25:36] from the womb
[25:39] and grabbed the esau's
[26:00] in other words esau was a favorite of
[26:03] isaac
[26:07] and jacob was the favorite of rebecca
[26:09] jacob
[26:11] how many have favorite kids here juantos
[26:13] preferridos
[26:15] the parents don't want to answer that
[26:16] right now
[26:18] but uh brother branham says so they said
[26:21] amano brandon in the in the message uh
[26:23] hearing recognizing and acting on the
[26:25] word of god
[26:29] it says like this this scene it says
[26:31] these two boys
[26:33] will notice if we all notice their
[26:35] nature
[26:49] and that same thing has took place all
[26:51] down through the age yes
[26:55] the carno and the spiritual carnal elo
[26:57] spiritual esau represent represented the
[27:00] man on the of the earth
[27:18] it never
[27:31] amen amen so we continue reading the
[27:33] bible or the story of of these two boys
[27:38] it says that esau came out came came
[27:40] from the field
[27:44] and he walked in on jacob making soup
[27:59] and then jacobs tells him
[28:02] i'll give you some in exchange of your
[28:04] birthright
[28:07] and uh isa replies yes i will contest
[28:10] what benefit does this birthright have
[28:12] for me kevin fischo professor
[28:18] and i believe esau didn't this despise
[28:21] of his birthright
[28:23] especially
[28:24] when he exchanged it for the stew
[28:28] because the
[29:10] that's when you're telling god
[29:15] you know esau gave up his blessings yes
[29:19] he gave up the blessings of god
[29:36] he at that moment and that's a moment he
[29:50] does not accept the things of the spirit
[29:52] of god
[29:57] they are full is foolishness to him
[30:01] and he cannot understand them
[30:05] because they are spiritually appraised
[30:20] his father anton says vasu father his
[30:23] father isaac
[30:24] and he tells him father blessed me
[30:27] no he was of an older age already
[30:32] he was already going blind
[30:35] he tells and he tells them bless me
[30:39] and he starts like who are you yes
[30:43] and that's when he he lies to him
[30:47] that jacob tells him i'm esau
[30:51] that's where he deceived him
[30:54] he likes to get a blessing
[30:58] and then isa comes right after him
[31:11] and he and isaac's all confused like who
[31:13] are you yes
[33:50] you know i heard her saying once once
[33:54] that it says oh i woke up today because
[33:56] my alarm woke me up
[34:00] it wasn't the alarm that woke up that's
[34:01] right
[34:03] it was god that
[34:19] and brother branham's preaching hearing
[34:21] recognizing his acting word of god he
[34:23] continues saying do you say mano branham
[34:25] and el nino
[34:26] recon
[34:28] jacob
[34:29] jacob the reason that he chose to find
[34:31] the birthright regardless
[35:00] didn't matter
[35:03] [Music]
[35:22] [Applause]
[35:34] [Music]
[35:37] you know it says that he was on his road
[35:38] he was after and he received this
[35:55] but back then they were only have bread
[35:56] for the priest
[36:01] and the law it said that only the priest
[36:03] could have that
[36:05] solo
[36:08] and david was there and he was hungry
[36:25] kept insisting i'm hungry
[36:29] and then god says
[36:35] because god does not ignore
[36:38] someone
[37:19] that you've been wanting for 10 years
[37:25] all it takes is it's having enough
[37:27] hunger
[37:34] brother branham i don't think i have
[37:35] this here but brother branham says mano
[37:37] branham this says that the natural man
[37:40] sees the natural things
[37:44] and the natural things are so contra
[37:46] contrary to the intellectual
[37:48] intellectual
[37:52] that he cannot understand it
[37:54] in there and it was you
[37:57] yeah
[37:59] it was you lord
[38:00] steadfast
[38:02] brother branham
[38:17] you know jacob fought with the angel
[38:19] jacob
[38:21] i know this later on in the story i want
[38:23] to get deep into that
[38:27] but in that moment
[38:29] jacob's life changed
[38:44] he was no longer jacob
[38:47] you know a moment tonight
[38:51] in the altar
[38:53] for you could change your life
[38:56] you talk to god if you come to god
[39:10] so no matter how broken you are tonight
[39:34] you know what matters is you having a
[39:36] relationship with god
[39:39] just one moment can change your life
[39:43] you know later on in the bible in exodus
[39:47] we read where uh
[39:48] where moses asked god
[39:54] he asked god is like why am i going to
[39:55] tell the the israelites
[39:59] israelis when they asked me who sent me
[40:04] and in god response you're going to tell
[40:05] them
[40:08] the god of abraham
[40:11] the god of isaac
[40:13] and the god of jesus
[40:16] but i want you to know but he didn't say
[40:17] the god of israel
[40:21] because this was after his name was
[40:29] even though he he was he he was the
[40:31] person he was okay
[40:34] god was still his god yo javier
[40:44] and that's me yes it's so young like god
[40:46] is not going to change who he is
[40:49] god is not going to not love me for what
[40:52] i'm doing
[40:56] you know god will always remain
[40:59] you know god loves the sinners
[41:06] you know god is the god of your process
[41:11] when god says or god says i am here when
[41:14] you fall
[41:17] i am there when you feel alone
[41:21] when you are broken
[41:24] and he will come down for you when
[41:25] you're in the pit yeah
[41:28] who knows you despite your mess-ups no
[41:30] important
[41:46] where we change
[41:59] [Applause]
[42:05] god bless you
[42:08] my brother john says god bless you more
[42:10] commerce
[42:14] making sure
[42:29] is of god
[42:32] and it's not
[42:33] a fake thing
[42:36] amen if we go to romans chapter nine
[42:39] romanos capitulo nueven chapter eleven
[42:42] versicolons
[42:49] god bless you all
[42:51] my brothers my sisters
[42:54] my friends miss amigos uh
[42:57] if i can just simply say this i love you
[42:59] all very much
[43:02] amen
[43:03] god says this
[43:06] for the children being not yet born
[43:07] neither having done any good or evil
[43:10] that the purpose of god according to the
[43:12] election might stand not of works but of
[43:15] him that call it
[43:17] a sobriety
[43:31] it is written jacob have i loved but
[43:34] esau have i hated
[43:44] i want to really real quickly recap on
[43:46] brother fernando verse 23 of genesis
[44:04] and two manners of people shall be
[44:05] separated from thy
[44:17] and the one people shall be stronger
[44:19] than the other people
[44:31] he did not specify which one isa or
[44:33] jacob
[44:34] specifically
[44:36] now i want you guys to focus on that
[44:38] later on
[44:41] we're going to be coming back to that
[44:44] we look through the bible
[45:17] isaac and ishmael as well
[45:20] up to the point of abraham and locks
[45:23] like our brother fernando
[45:26] fernandez we have the story of esau and
[45:27] jacob estamos and historia
[45:31] uh last friday our brother uh gamalier
[45:34] and brother marshall el venez pasado el
[45:35] manoga malia and mano martial uh
[45:38] it was a confirmation i believe from god
[45:41] confirmation
[45:44] one quote or two quotes
[45:48] that brother gama and brother
[45:51] marshall said hermano
[45:53] and manoga malian mention i had already
[45:56] had yo
[45:58] prepared
[46:12] many times and when you read the the the
[46:14] story of eastern jacob who said i sort
[46:16] of jacob
[46:17] i don't know if you're like me no
[46:20] you ask yourself questions
[46:22] and it's good to ask yourself questions
[46:26] but the question
[46:40] the perfect elective
[46:45] of god that the author that descendants
[46:49] from abraham to isaac
[46:52] then came down to those two twins
[47:05] the only explanation i can give you
[47:07] like explicit
[47:19] and we're just going to recap on that
[47:21] again
[47:36] i can't review something enough okay
[47:41] it's always good to review
[47:45] what our prophet said
[47:47] what the word of god says
[47:50] when those times
[48:31] that god according to the elect might
[48:34] stand questions
[48:38] the very elect
[48:41] how from this descendant
[48:44] now he says no matter how good your
[48:46] father and mother was they said
[48:50] how much christian your father and
[48:52] mother was juan finos
[48:54] it still lays to you as an individual
[48:57] dependent you said come on before
[49:41] [Music]
[49:42] where we cannot already make up our mind
[49:44] as young people
[49:49] what we like what we don't like
[49:52] or if we can say our certain way of
[49:54] believing
[50:51] the question
[50:52] is
[50:54] the devil knows more what god has and
[50:56] hold for you el diablo
[51:00] yourself
[51:03] he does everything he can to take away
[51:34] do not continue the
[51:38] because
[51:38] like i said in the beginning
[51:41] as long as we're still here
[51:43] we're always going to be faced
[51:46] with evil
[51:48] adam in the beginning
[52:02] the devil
[52:15] if you want to obtain of that birthright
[52:20] to help you
[52:22] in that moment and that's a moment when
[52:24] the devil strikes you
[52:29] what you truly have inside of it
[52:43] something if i can say
[52:45] fake silo podes
[52:48] imaginary imaginario
[52:51] what
[52:52] what esau had if i could say look at
[52:54] esau
[52:57] again i'm gonna be quoting quite a bit
[52:59] of our prophets
[53:02] many preachers can quote a lot about a
[53:04] prophet
[53:07] what i'm trying to do
[53:11] is to bring it in the same manner
[53:15] same spirit
[53:18] that loving spirits
[53:24] are loving i love them which i have for
[53:26] you yes
[53:45] he says will we know in today that it's
[53:48] the law of contrast
[53:52] that weather is good
[53:54] there is evil brother marshall said this
[53:56] quote last friday
[54:00] brother says and we will never
[54:02] no matter what our environment may be
[54:05] now notice that church no important
[54:08] questions
[54:51] [Applause]
[55:01] is
[55:31] you have to take one side or the other
[55:34] side
[55:36] of the name of the lord
[55:38] god allows us to have that free will
[55:42] he gives us a choice
[55:45] and tonight he gives you still the
[55:46] choice
[55:49] because many times
[55:51] again the the story of isa and jacob
[55:55] it's i can say it's part of my life
[55:59] because when we look upon jacob and
[56:01] isaac
[56:03] both were very similar
[56:09] both were religious
[56:11] foreign
[56:14] both believed in god
[56:16] it wasn't that it said no
[56:19] he saw believed in uh had idols
[56:23] no no brother brandon even says
[56:27] esau was a better gentleman than jacob
[56:31] he took care of his blind daddy
[56:35] it's it may seem that he was a better
[56:37] christian if you could say
[56:40] no he was going out and taking care of
[56:42] his daddy's
[56:45] where jacob was home taking being with
[56:47] his mother
[56:50] brother brandon calls him a el
[56:52] amano branham lawyer my own many
[56:54] times i i'm i'm like that i question
[56:57] myself
[57:00] am i like jacob
[57:05] but here's the difference
[57:08] even though jacob
[57:10] and esau
[57:52] could never see
[58:05] he needed a change in his
[58:19] when it came upon him
[58:34] i'm going to go even deeper than that
[58:37] because many times
[58:39] young people
[58:41] as adults
[58:42] we have those genuine experiences
[58:46] so we receive the baptism of the holy
[58:47] spirit
[59:41] he says therefore god gives thee of the
[59:44] dew of the heaven
[1:00:12] from
[1:00:54] it's
[1:01:08] because once that touches down deep
[1:01:10] within your soul
[1:01:13] it's when only god is solo
[1:01:16] and only god
[1:01:17] can start working inside of you
[1:01:20] because no one else can go deep inside
[1:01:22] your mouth
[1:01:36] that in your
[1:01:50] my way
[1:02:04] that's what jacob
[1:02:31] [Music]
[1:02:47] [Applause]
[1:03:01] those but there's more spirits
[1:03:04] speeding they want to latch on to us
[1:03:41] punto
[1:04:02] i'm not saying this is going to happen
[1:04:04] from today or tomorrow so he said okay
[1:04:07] it's a process
[1:04:09] so like a brother wednesday
[1:04:38] that's when you know you're going
[1:05:20] like they said commodity
[1:05:22] if it were possible
[1:05:25] it would deceive the very elect
[1:05:29] that scripture comes heavy on my heart
[1:05:34] many times
[1:05:47] maybe through a preaching
[1:06:04] examine yourself through the words
[1:06:07] because there's nothing else
[1:06:11] help us get to that perfect stature
[1:06:16] that perfect statue of
[1:06:31] if we could solo
[1:06:33] how many years we've been going to
[1:06:34] church
[1:06:36] how many years we've been trying time
[1:06:37] and time again
[1:06:40] but like i said
[1:06:44] make sure
[1:06:57] not even 99.99
[1:07:13] el correcto
[1:07:14] don't be deceived no saying
[1:07:17] as many times
[1:07:22] i've had friends
[1:07:24] amigos
[1:07:25] i've had brothers
[1:07:40] we've all heard the same preachings
[1:07:51] that's right
[1:07:53] some
[1:07:53] and i'm not saying
[1:07:56] how's that left
[1:08:00] i do believe that they will croquet
[1:08:05] is uh
[1:08:08] by the grace of god
[1:08:11] like brother fernando
[1:08:13] fernando
[1:08:16] but
[1:08:17] right now in my time
[1:08:20] i'm i'm still young i know that estoy
[1:08:23] haven't you lost
[1:08:24] but
[1:08:26] like our pastor
[1:08:28] pastor he says i like to ask myself
[1:08:30] serious questions
[1:08:35] questions that shake me
