David take uriah's wife the beautiful Bathsheba when he had 500 wives 500 of his own implemented but seeing her taking a bath and there's the negligence now she just got she just forgot to pull the shades down when she was taking her bath system and know that know that King made a trip by there every day down over that wall now we are seeing okay she knew that David David would have strolled around that area the word negligence of her own self but she also knew that the king could see her he took her this is the word of God says when she told him that she that she was impregnated it seems as though he wanted to kind of wash his hands and we don't recognize sin after sin continues to happen one thing brings another and thus the Bible says that he is sent for Uriah and he tried to persuade Uriah to go back home and go asleep with his wife so that it would appear that it was uriah's child but Uriah did not to take heed or pay attention to the king so the king formed a he uh he constructed a plan on how to get rid of Uriah [Music] that's how far his sin took him because him being according to the heart of God he was also of Flesh he also failed and made mistakes but God knew David's heart who was Uriah Urias Uriah was of the people of the Hittites Caribbean and Israel that dwelled in Israel they were in Canaan Dios te Pueblo God had sent to kill these people completely in the time of Joshua Josue but Joshua left us some of the tribes of the hittite and others he didn't completely obey God so the descendants of Uriah Israel they they stayed in israelitas and with time they became Israelites they believed in the same God and Uriah was faithful to God he worshiped the Lord as well now is second Samuel 11 14 and 15. this is 14 says and it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah yes and he wrote in the letter saying said ye Uriah in the Forefront of the hottest battle and retiree from him that he may be smitten and die now Not only was it just adultery but it was also a homicide because it was not a righteous a fight it's like I say one sin leads to another if you don't come out of it aura now David was becoming a murderer this is second Samuel 11 verse 26 says after Uriah had had died in the Battle and when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husband is and when the morning was passed David sent investor to his house and she became his wife and bear him a son but the thing that David had done displeased the Lord now in order for it to displease the Lord we don't need to just be adulterers any sin displeases because the sin doesn't doesn't have a great sinner a small sin this is nor the liar will be saved it doesn't put one higher than the others Sin is Sin now cuando cuando Senor West when the Lord sees this since his Prophet Nathan to go and and seek out David yes II Samuel don't say uno chapter 12 verse 1 all the way to 14. this is and the Lord sent Nathan unto Davido and he came into him and said unto him there was were two men in one city the one rich and the other poorjas is the rich man had many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing say one little you left which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children he did eat of his own meat and drink of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter yes traveled unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that has done this thing shall surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity is and Nathan said to David Thou Art the man thus said the Lord God of Israel I Anointed The King over Israel and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul is and I gave thee that Master's house and thy Masters wives into thy bosom and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah and if that had been too little I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things wherefore has not despised the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight that was killed Uriah the hittite with a sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of Amen now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou has despised me and has taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife David o and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die Amigos because by this deed thou has given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die it's like Historia this uh this story David only knew it Bathsheba as well and the Commandment of the art the commander of the army Pennsylvania David knew thought that he was safe that he could keep it uh hidden yeah and sometimes you that's how we are and the more we make mistakes we commit we continue to make mistakes that's what happened with David he took the word of God very lightly he didn't realize what he was doing but he was sent a prophet and in this age we are sent a prophet in order to tell us where we are wrong what we are doing wrong whether it be great or small as I said as I said there's no greater before the eyes of God it's just it's all sin now knowing that just these three are knew of this story verse 14. how about because by this deed thou has given dedication to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die which enemies but there were many when David Fell I want to read on verse 4 a little bit this is one of the causes by which David is he was distracted he was relaxed and comfortable in his Palace and there came a traveler unto the rich man yes this is another another character here it says that he was a traveler here one that was walking toward Davido who was the one that was walking it's a spirit which took him to the act of adultery but a a walker in either of the lives it could be any a bad spirit because that would come to you and you feed it with your Deeds you feed those Spirits that's what verse 4 is referring to the messenger says in in the in the message the the message of Grace in 61. now that was David's passions he had 500 wives instead of taking one of his 500 wives to appease or satisfy his passions he went and took this other man's wife then killed Uriah when she became a mother Mercy bring him to the courts we could give him one more opportunity but when he found himself lost he immediately asked for mercy since he was a man according to God's heart he acknowledged he recognizes his fault in Los Angeles in Psalms 51 according to the multitude really I Tender Mercies brought out my transgression watch me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sins for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against the the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou might as be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges behold I was shaping an iniquity and in sin did my mother conceived me yeah behold thou desire is truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom now David is recognizing that he had sinned she exposed herself he should have remained firm in the word of God and youth sometimes in our short in our young age you have I mean this is sometimes you think if my if my father weren't like this if my mother wasn't like this as long as you don't recognize your sins as long as you don't recognize your faults you will be in the same condition doesn't matter who your father is the best preachers if you don't recognize that you're wrong that we were born to work with his flesh but the message of the hour came you know the perfect man you can't do away you weren't allowed to do anything but let's recognize our condition God bless you [Applause] God bless you Brothers it's a privilege to be able to greet you it's the um we thank God as well for this precious day what is time we greet our brother Tito California in California hoping that the day of tomorrow all goes well and have some great news we uh missed them already yesterday let us open our Bibles The Book of Proverbs chapter four and we'll be reading from verse 25 through 27. verse 25 26-27. the word of the Lord says like this is look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee examine Ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand or to the left remove thy foot from Evil now let us go to a second Samuel ah and we'll be staying there and then we'll be reading in the same chapter and it came to pass in an evening tide that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the King's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman is very beautiful to look upon okay may God add blessings to the reading of his words of biblical characters we are with David we'll be learning on Bathsheba and Uriah or open up with this instructions about the distractions what is a distraction and provokes a lack of attention that is that is in these last days to get us off balance there's a distraction Even in our homes there's a distraction and he uses it well what is the purpose of distraction is to avoid that we will be able to achieve our goals the and fulfill the real purpose in our lives that's what a distraction causes Aura now una destruction a distraction can can pull us away it can separate us from the the the the the location of what is is wanted to be given to us and the purpose that has for us it's important to know what the how are we distracted or how they come in the form of places and uh things as well yes and this is what happened with David now look yes he was he was a foreigner he was a gentile it was hittite he was also a soldier Guerrero he was a soldier of Elizabeth Elite yeah he was one of the the men of valor of David he was he was a valiant man and now look he was of another religion of a different culture but when he meets the people of Israel through the marriage with Bathsheba is he decides to to turn his face toward what the Israelites believe Uriah 's place even in the Bible demonstrating after the year was expired Jerusalem we just read David stayed in Jerusalem foreign what was this man doing at a time he was The Shepherd of a sheep in in the palace the word of God says that he begins to walk on on the rooftops I imagine he was a little bored maybe he didn't have anything else to do and when you get bored you don't have anything to do you find yourself alone the enemy begins to work I tell you because it's happening I'm being sincere a machinar the Mind begins to imagine things and this happens with David imagine he's bored and all of a sudden what happens in one of the homes he sees this woman and he fixed his eyes upon that beautiful body because dashibo was a very beautiful woman forcefully but not right there's a reflection here how are we Brothers what's our condition now look when we fall into a distraction s many times we begin to develop we we are our loved ones are involved he enters into conflict he decides to forsake Him all because of a distraction meet it look that man um the one that was that was a small Shepherd that that a poet the man that played the harp explain to cast out Souls demons one day he said he said Keep Me Lord from extending my hands the anointed one of God but when you're distracted your nature begins to change all right and here's the other part here's the other attitude of David when he says and he sent a message and he uh he went inner to her attitude and the first attitude it was the attitude of Christ in him but on the second attitude it was this other nature perhaps the spirit of Allah took hold of him yeah and uh and and the consequences that was no longer the attitude of God in David took care of the Sheep the man that loved his people he had changed now look around I want to enter into the the character Uriah and I see three attitudes of this man Implement of second Samuel chapter 11 verse 1 it says one way or another um answered unto David is The Ark in Israel and Judah by intense and my Lord joab and the Servants of my Lord are encamped in the Open Fields so I didn't go into my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy Soul live it I will not do this thing do you see the attitude of this man he had Christian principles he was faithful to the to to his Christianity he was not just a Christian by words he was a Christian through deeds and he fulfilled his word the next point second Samuel 11 verse 9. but Uriah said to the door of the King's house with all the Servants of his Lord and went not down to his house I believe that Uriah was showing David something here The loyalty putting God first but for everything he was a H solidario um he was faithful with uh with his brothers with his brother in battle he refuses and and and and and take a shower Comer and eat and be with his wife because they were in battle for the soldiers that were there now we'll go to the third attitude second Samuel 11 verse 17. is the city went out and fought with joab and therefore some of the people of the Servants of David and Uriah the hittite died also esta is this attitude of Uriah the conviction of conviction and and commitment he knew that the words of God fought the battles what's greater with God then when then even even more so than with the King and and because of that what right did David have the permitters to allow himself to get distracted he was not able to relax how could Uriah a God in the middle of War his face they were they were settled on God and I believe this is in the front lines of battle but he was willing to give his life for his people look what brother Branham says in the message you're considering our ways foreign after he did wrong and taken Uriah the hittite's wife and it calls her Gallant husband to be killed in battle but when the prophet Nathan come in and revealed his sins are God will always hear a man or woman that'll turn their feet to his testimony David was worthy of dying and that was the law right he he should have died and he pronounced his own death but Nathan said surely you'll not die for he know David knew God I knew that he'd done wrong he defiled his brother's wife and forgiveness o pares people going on knowing that you're walking hour by hour in the face of death why do we continue on with selfishness and greed and ungodliness in our eyes on the things of the world time we turn back to God's testimony I turned my feet to thy testimony due to a distraction he had a deviated from the way to the point where he had lost the joy of his salvation we have a god that is written Mercy is we are all we we are all going to commit sins I've committed many mistakes and I'll continue perhaps making them yes and then our testimony will be on his behalf sorry you know in California when I was in California I'll be closing with this there was a time in our life in my life yeah I didn't have meaning foreign [Music] I was a ship in in the midst of a storm where are the waves were tossing me to and fro and there came a point in my life where it was a stumbling they were not right and you know all of that okay it brings a stress it brings it brings anguish it seems like there's no hope but in the exact moment God begins to work with me and I see that at the end of the road I loose there's light and I thank God foreign I was in need God used them to give me hope is so use we all can't commit mistakes all of us nobody is according to God's Own Heart he was distracted and committed mistakes God bless you thank you [Music] oh God is here correct you don't have to wait for
