didn't grow up in church who have been the world so I was established in its ways and desires and that makes you depressed and so I would smoke take medications and um one day I got hit by a car I think I ran over I don't know it just happened and I woke up in the hospital and I earned I injured my left knee is and I was in bed for uh for a while I couldn't get up on my own I couldn't go to work and that made my depression 20 times worse and thank God that I recovered physically but mentally I was in a long season of depression depression I would go to sleep all the time I'd watch the Sun go up and down for long times I would barely need to use the bathroom because well I didn't eat or drink um I was I was literally rotting away and I was okay with that and then one day I had a brother talk to me about the good news of Jesus Christ which such passion and boldness and I didn't understand it but I wanted it and by that time I was smoking every hour a lot of medications that I shouldn't have and I with the faith of a mustard seed I prayed [Music] that I wouldn't stop smoking so that I could be sober yeah and I went from smoking every hour never wanting to again literally overnight and I started coming to church here it was a lot but I knew that I needed more faith um because in one day you India I was gonna take my antidepressant and someone something told me that if I just trust in him and that I was ready only if I was willing to trust and I did and [Music] I mean that's part of why you guys always hear me say it's all mental because well I give glory to God for that because it sometimes it takes you to get down to finally give yourself up and I would have never done that by myself or for myself yeah there's a lot of testimonies and I hope this helps if they think that they can find something out there in the world because I I could always get everything that I had back but okay it was it worth living for eign God bless this church that you guys were there when I needed to find a place and I believe that the word is here so I thank you guys God bless you God bless his name [Applause] [Music] wow what an amazing special and amazing testimony may

way with me let thy will be done Lord help us tonight amen as you're standing if you can please open up the First Kings chapter 17 verse Kings chapter 17 verse 9. it truly feels really good to be here tonight it's not trying to build up there's enough so something I'm not trying to build up to something I'm truly coming here genuine as I can be can you name it is I truly believe something marvelous is going to happen tonight do you guys believe it it's all in you it says First Kings 17 9. arise and get thee to the reference which belongeth to zidon and and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee levantage now we're going to jump to first king chapter 18 verse one please First Kings chapter 18 verse give thanks unto our pastor for allowing me to not only use his pulpitor foreign it says and it comes to Past after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year saying go shoot thyselfs unto Ahab and I will send rain upon the Earth Lord we just give you thanks for your love and mercy tonight we just simply come in a simple mindset a humble mindset Lord not trying to work ourselves through an emotions but be plain and simple we need you I need you that's why I come here tonight I don't come here because I'm perfect I come here because I'm broken come here cause I'm flawed I come here because I am a sinner who recognize that Grace was applied unto my life and that's why I'm here tonight use your vessels put me aside um take control of this body take control of this mind and take control of every body and mind in this place the devil has rights to do anything he can to Rob us from our blessing but it's we also have a right come before you God and claim is the promises that you gave us the overcome this world we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen I'm a little bit louder than usual is again not trying to build up to an emotion but after reading what God has to say about Elijah about that experience in Mount Carmelo not only about that fire but all the experiences that he had before that it just gets you excited she's just waking something inside [Music] and before I want to say my title yeah without with our beloved pastor pastor we entirely I need a Mount Carmel experience and I read chapter 17 because I want you to know where Elijah was found um before God called them towards Mount Carmel it says that God sent him to to zarephiefs and going into the word in the Greek and El griego it means significa place of refinements please put it up here on the projector it says place of refinements smelting place of purification of fire purification I don't believe God is the god of coincidence got out of purpose of the reason why he said it's His prophets to this certain place before this great encounter in Mount Carmelo Carmelo and then it says and smelting is the extracting of precious metals precios so I believe it was no coincidence to this place can purify himself again we know he was the prophet of God Amen a human that can relate to you that's what I'm trying to connect to tonight [Music] here on Earth which was a spiritual battle at one point foreign hey man I'm not trying to get excited he's just okay what if God gets you a certain way can identify with me just simply get deep inside God's words you can't explain it you could just simply tell someone else you got to go through it yourself what I'm living and I can't preach to you about somebody I had an experience of a fire experience if I myself haven't had it first be to God Amen [Music] in a full state so God can see you know it's time oh no I guess dimple it's time to give you your Mount Karma Carmelo let's see if brother Brown says in the message painted face Jezebel uh because if we look at it and I feel sometimes people are like this as well I've been like this where I feel like maybe I don't need of nothing please put it up please brother Brown says Elijah's sitting up there for three years just having a good time every night every time a crow would come by Deep right down and give them a sandwich get him a drink of water and Shout a little while and sit back down again if that isn't wonderful if you can look at the picture Brothers Elijah was not foreign [Music] thanks be to God we have a God that knows more than we do yes because we could say day and night I'm fine I'm fine but if you find yourself in the same place I got bad news for you or may be good you're not fine you're stuck and many times you find yourself in a stock stage filling out everything's fine all around us maybe you're receiving Blessing about blessings your life is going fine all right but what about somebody else what about somebody else outside of your family somebody outside your church needs a touch of reality or something because the people of Israel were found in dry they close up in the room man I don't know if there's someone like that you know it's been feeling like that because yes well let me tell you I can't give it to you you don't know God can give that to you yes truly in your desires because my question is what made the people of Israel go up to Mount Carmel Monte Carmelo to hear of this prophets say [Music] I'm not full of worries we are loose but God knew that there was someone there he sent them a message I'm telling you you do we have something and you cannot explain I can't explain it with words but you yourself have to take all of that Etc take it deep within your hearts because your pastor can't do it your mommy and daddy cannot do it they're not gonna make you go up there you have to make a decision a genuine decision to choose samientos she can go and grab everything from the world it's not that hard noise it's easy out there it's easy no one will look at you okay it's your choice tonight what experience do you want to have tonight I know I need another Mount Carmel experience I can't wait for the next Youth Services [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah contentos we're speaking with the title yo necesito I need an experience the one that needs it here on both sides of this mountain is a valley and God knew to go through our valleys the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together into Mount Carmel yes and Elijah came and saw the people and said how long how ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if Bell then follow him and the people answered him not a word their silence spoke a lot hombres then said Elijah to the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord barbell's prophets are 450 Men Dancing yes let them therefore give us two Bullocks and let them choose one Bull look for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and I will dress the other Bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under this was The Proposal from Elijah to the people this was his challenge then we'll all serve him but if God is God in your life this is the proposal es that Bells choose a bullet and I'll bring a bullet and was laid on word Fuego but laid no fires and call you on the name of your Gods Instagram Netflix Netflix and I will call on the names now this was The Proposal accepted Elijah's proposal respond and all the people answered and said they were able we're able to repetitions why can't you and I foreign [Applause] to accept his challenge for ye are many and call on the name of your Gods but put no fire under yes foreign for me you're not so sad I don't know about you yeah continue in the same way yeah amen yes Elijah mocked him and said cry aloud for he is a God either he is talking on his pursuit or he's on a journey or pure Adventure he sleepeth and must be awake in other words he's too busy so come here tonight for you Hallelujah amen yes sir amen yes go ahead and Elijah Center people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired now notice notice what Elijah notice the difference he didn't go screaming what's right and he repaired the altar of the Lord prepare your hearts yeah go ahead foreign [Applause] your ground Lord oh Hallelujah everyone wants God to move but no one wants to do the job no one wants to do the hard work and he made a trench [Music] a big trench around the altar it is and he said do it uh 35 34 sorry and he said do it in the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time and the water ran round about the Altar and he filled the trench also with water buckets four four and four cuatro cuatro four times four times to the way of the Lord let me tell you Brothers it wasn't hard to turn a light of fire in that drought you can light a fire with any little thing and it came to pass the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came here and said Lord of Abraham Isaac in Israel Manifesto let it be known this is and that I have done all these things the fire is about so far it wasn't the longest prayer it wasn't his prayer that made Firefall it was a sacrifice he prepared it was what he brought we're going to speak more about that I want to give you another summary before we get to this part again I want to tell you this is before Elijah came to this month God had been preparing him the experience without the experience on the brook of uh experience he wouldn't have been ready for him on Mount Carmen because God had to Humble him how many of us have had to go for me you had to be humble how many of us have asked ourselves what are you doing is there anyone here you say you don't know what God is doing in here God didn't realize everything he would do God told him the first thing he told me go to the brook is how long Lord I don't know to a river a week pass age no when he no yeah yes yes giving him an experience before giving an experience of being exalted because one of the things that kills men that is more dangerous and many other things unknown he takes um it's like Fort Collins and there he is waiting with a widow foreign when the entire kingdom is looking for you he has been preparing you his word be calm no no no no that's not going to take it you have to get to a hunger a pain yes God was letting the people feel true pain of what it was to live without God Sita um patience and humbleness is required someone that has a great need is required and it's required of someone that's ready to make a decision there was a mountain of decisions there was a place where they had to make a decision Elijah made a Covenant Church he wants to have a company how sad it is and he said it's time to make a decision I'm not sure [Music] oh God that's why we come and we worship because we're not sure it's done for us that's why we leave church and do everything we do he's not important thing that happened in church matters because we're not sure who God is for us what a terrible thing is to get to the end of your life and realize that what we trusted in was a lie but my God he wants you to make sure my God the Amelia say my God wants me to be sure he foreign to your life come on ask yourself tonight it's not a coincidence that God is saying this case are you really more happy with your Gods where have they let you to give pleasure to your flesh ask yourself don't be afraid don't be afraid to answer if your gods have really made you happy that's fine serve them give God one opportunity find out if God can't make you happy see if you don't surrender your hearts if he can give you real jewelry happiness courageous enough don't be a coward of it but just because I mean the real foreign am I truly happier be brave enough I know many of you are thinking about it this is one more service I'm going to live the same if you're going to leave this because you want to live that way amen amen that's ready to face their gods is so would you want to get it what do you really want has your pleasure helped you since more lost more depressed face your God face your God ask yourself am I really happier with it how I found out I'm imprisoned my God isn't afraid to show you no you're not hearing me at all oh my God isn't afraid to show us his power maybe God might not spend so it's time sending sign after sign after sign but he will give you the forever be willing to stand for him he might not speak to you every day you want to feel him every time he'll give you the experience [Music] Israel all right oh thank God hey let's start this question she is willing to approve himself if anyone is willing to face it's brave enough to say I accept your challenge all right that's ready that people is they didn't know what was going to happen they didn't have a clue of what was going to happen lives will change forever of you putting him to the test what made fire fall out was it Elijah's prayer was it the leaps no no no with sacrifice it was a sacrifice he offered and the place he did it he didn't offer any sacrifices he offered a sacrifice for sin is no sacrifice could be offered without salt those 12 barrels of water where were they going to draw water from it from where from yeah you know do you think they were going to let something dump 12 buckets of water when people are dying but Mount Carmel is next to the Mediterranean Sea it is so that water was maybe water from the sea the segurus it was for sure water from the sea is and Elijah knew that water came with said it was salty water and he poured water over the sacraments carry the solid needed to carry it is Saul represents to preserve right you cannot come together without flavors [Music] what was hard was not for the fire to fall that one was not the challenge that if he laid the right sacrifice willing to fall on us God is so willing to prove himself God is willing he just needs the correct the right side of course the correct question the musicians can come for you to come weary give it out broken whom he had humbled for you to come ready to make a decision that you come ready facing your gods yes and asking yourself what do I really want that I was only a Christian Halfway Christian so live claiming and speaking of God's greatness I never really seen them in my life or do I want to walk with him do I want him to be my everything [Music] is there a soul here in this night I believe God came for one
