[Music] there's only two ways [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] oh [Music] a [Music] and now i am happy all the day and at the cross yes at the cross where i first saw the light and the burden of [Music] and now i am happy holiday let's sing the first verse alas [Music] [Music] [Music] head [Music] [Music] i received myself and now i am happy [Music] and uh i just uh asked you to open your bibles um to the book of daniel [Music] for giving us the privilege to use let us read the scripture it reads like this you say i see daniel chapter one verse five daniel uno versicolo cinco says and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king illeste and i want you to go to a second uh timothy chapter three we'll be reading from verse one um two um four and it reads like this essie this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come says for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents one thankful unholy hombres amadores blasphemos it says without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontent fears despisers of those that are good and it says traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god cinco de so having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof let us pray heavenly father celestial we're so grateful this morning for the privilege you give us to be in your presence we have full assurance that you're here with us because your word has told us so we asked father that you would just speak to your children they're your children that are hungry for words of life we ask that you uh use the interpreter use the one that we'll be speaking for and then at the end of the service we just uh we just want your holy name to be glorified and we put ourselves in your hands and we ask this in the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen uh you may be seated uh it's been about a month you know there's god's just been you know working this morning i get i get pretty excited you know one thing i've learned you know ever since i understand i've understood my colleagues you know uh i just i just want to be faithful in it if in other things you know we set aside the things of god you know but i don't want to be like that unfaithful story the unfaithful steward of el mayor domo in field i want i don't want to be like that even if it's something just it's very simple and it may seem insignificant significant but i want to let you know that that that small thing that may seem insignificant to others it's not insignificant to god you can't tell yourself you see god sees all things big and small you know you know i heard i heard a quote i heard a quote one time i i was i was very big on sports growing up if i could identify myself with somebody it would probably be uh like samuel said you know one of the things that always caught my attention oh you know things that would motivate my motiva and uh one of the quotes i remember very well it said this it said a pressure it bust pipes it'll bust pipes or or it will make diamonds you know and i don't know about you but uh i want to be more than just a pipe quiero said una pipa you know i i i want to be more than just than just a pipe you see because i believe that god has diamonds i believe and you know to to to uh to be a diamond there has to be a pressure that has to be applied applicable amen amen and you see uh when uh when daniel and and uh you know these hebrew children the people of israel they were taking captives it almost seemed like god was just sleeping on them they almost sleep like they were serving a god that was sleeping i wonder if we don't ask ourselves that question many times if there's a god if there's a god maybe god isn't sleepy you see maybe god has been talking i wonder if we're not sleeping on him i wonder if we haven't slept when he's been trying to speak you know but you just haven't been away to here i believe god has been speaking and he's been speaking you see we got a god of mercy but there is a lie he is waiting brothers god was sleeping on him and it reads like this if there's anything that makes christians lazy it says it's when they're on a flower bed of ease esco understands he says always the chain is the strongest at its weakest links and i like what he says here he says and a man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure it says get him all riled up then you'll see the real man that comes out [Music] if he's got temper it'll show itself he was putting them it was [Applause] ever since i knew there was something more than just what the world had to offer it's never but there is a god that has no limits he is going to take me out but before he takes me out but i'll just get my socket he has got to put me through you know i think it was a year back okay my life my wife she lost her ring and uh you know i heard about it yeah exclu chad y'all wasn't too happy nostalgia feliz didn't i didn't show it um rings aren't cheap uh but we looked for it and we couldn't find it you know we looked for it in the daytime you know we're trying she was trying to go back and see yes you know trying to trace her steps and you know what when the last time she saw it and uh she came to check at the church you know in the parking lot and everything and we know i was like man you know it's gone and i was like well you know we could check again you know but i looked underneath you know and i was like man you know if we're going to find it we're going to find this diamond this diamond rings we're going to find it at night it's hard to find that you know something that shines you know when when the when the sun's beaming if we're going to find it we're going to find it right now you know so i get a light going to find it you know when it's the darkest almost you see we live in a place you know there's a lot of homeless people you know they're just they're just walking around here i mean you guys have seen it you know we're living in the last days you see we got pressure from our bosses and we have to be able to resist this pressure pod amen amen we got to be able to resist it we got to be able to hold our grounds you see when daniel and the hebrew they didn't teach them what that they were taught when they were younger one more time they weren't they weren't taught what they were taught when they were younger they didn't eat the same comment you see they weren't taught the same segment they they didn't want him to live the same okay why you see everything was so different he was taking him to a place that they they didn't know what was happening but you know i was thinking why would god allow this brought me way back it took me back to the beginning you know even before there was an earthquake you see because even before there was a guardian satan satan was allowed to deceive the engagement in heaven and el cielo he deceived i think that's the only time you know that a butt is is actually valid i had to do something about it and he allows the the people of israel but to be taken into a very dark place a place that was far from perfect babylon that that god [Music] i want to go to uh daniel chapter 1 verse 5 again and uh i just want to read that one more time no mas la lo i want to just hold it right there you know what brother branham says and the message is the fourth seal he says this be said he says now the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer it says for the power of wine natural wine you know we act like you know we we just it seems when people see us you know depressed and you know we're just slouched down and yeah they would say we're christian yeah you need god to wake you up this is against like you've been sleeping for too long you need to get stimulated you need a revelation that'll cause the stimulation that'll bring you up there and you start it's the action of a rousing interest enthusiasm enthusiasm or excitement or emotion i wonder if we have stimulation we want to be stimulated my wine escomo tomen i'll take some of this stuff i'll take some of what we eat some of the things that we do you don't have to be different [Music] oh this is what stimulates me this is what makes me excited i wonder if it doesn't not because if we if it does oh we need to get moving and we got to show it before we can live i don't care what's happening you know people get scared the son or daughter of god i'm going there are it was let's go back to the quote he said this esto now there's a power of the revelation of the word now there's the power of the revelation of the word that gives stimulation of joy to the believers it's called he says these are drunk on new wine or spiritual wine or spiritual i think the best interpretation would be on spiritual wine i'd like to drink some of that wine that's what because that's what he these hebrew children i'm gonna get into them amen amen they're offered of these wine sonos you know enough this meat that they you know would uh be partakers of it okay uh participate they would drink it you know and you know what what that's what the devil likes to do you see because they had already had the real wine that's right these peop these these the people of israel hello israel as they grew up you know these children which you know was uh daniel and then the hebrew children their parents taught him well you know and i believe that i believe that because of what they did because of the way that they handled themselves you know under this pressure you know brother alex alex he talked about you know the teaching because you know the the teaching of they they wanted them to be taught in another way they wanted them to forget about their language forget about that heaven stuff that's what they want that's a look at your skin don't forget about that they didn't say this yes the devil's trying to give you his point of view that's what he's trying to do he's trying to give you his point man this is this is real living csv that's that's temporary that that's the only temporary you see it'll fade out this is gonna make me happy for a little while okay i believe that we got it we have it right now and it's the moment oh you got it in your hands you know and if you got it in your hands you know they were pressured there was pressure to succeed you know to to to to have success you know that was pressure i believe there's pressure and honestly it it displeases them oh right it brings some displeasure this is displeasing we've and it'll it'll make you happier it'll bring real excitement it'll bring real joy you know but we know that's a lie but we know we've i've been there and you know what the reason i'm up here it's because uh you know there's some people following but it was an act of god you see god could stop the persecution he could stop the hardships he can stop whatever he wants about what he's and he's doing something special it don't matter what they put in our way that's when we take the gates last week [Music] there's no stopping amen amen there was so much pressure glory to god to be like the rest they said come on you know i know that there's a lot of you know teachings going on even in the schools now especially for our children and you know they they they tell their children even the youth i believe it's okay you know to be homosexual established homosexuality it's it's fine there's no sin in that no you know but we as parents we gotta make sure that we teach our children you see because this world you see is it it's going to try it's going to try and change the way you think you know it's going to try to mold the minds of our children that's why brother [Music] you know and that's that's an example of what these three young hebrews uh that's what they went through yes i mean if you don't know what dang it with the the meaning of daniel what it means is significant my god is my judge yo says me wes you know and i believe that he had godly parents uh [Music] when he was stripped of all everything that he had but there was one day could not strip me from there you could take my help you could take my car
