more of God I yearn for him with all my heart amen Genesis 2:18 says and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help me for him verse 23 and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh one more scripture Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25 Ephesians 52 been speaking of a love relationship with God making our relationship deeper with God everything we have in the spiritual environment depends on our relationship with God all the fruit we will produce is depending on our relationship if we're not connected to him in a relationship we cannot produce the fruit that we should be as Christians Ephesians 52 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might presented to himself a glorious church not having spa or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish I'll read verse 30 for we are members of his body of his flesh and his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they tooo shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church let us pray Heavenly Father put ourselves in your hands One More Time Lord as a church as members Lord of one body as a member joined together come to worship you and put our focus on we come for you to speak us we want to open our hearts Lord we want you to speak to our souls Lord Jesus Christ move freely among don't allow an evil thought nothing that's connection with you Lord Jesus Christ we want to hear you we come to worship you we come to give you honor we come to be in a love affair with you don't allow us to leave without spending this time together with you we ask that your presence Lord be connected with ours and may we receive what our soul is in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen may all have your seats we've been speaking of a love relationship because we want a love relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ not only do we want a relationship with him as a savior that's fine to be saved it's fine to come to church accept the Lord Jesus Christ as our savior but there's a group of people chosen for something higher than that chosen not only to be a member of a church or only to be saved there was a group of people that were chosen to be the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ they will not have a simple relationship of saved and [Applause] savior but they will dive into a deeper relationship with he will not only only be their savior not only their redeemer but he will be their lord he will be their love he will be their everything I want to tell [Applause] you that's the type of relationship I want with my Lord not only do I want to be saved not only do I want to know that he loves me I that I've loved him with all my heart I want to know that the love is reciprocal not only do I want to be the one I want to be part of his bride I want to be in a special fellowship with him that's something only the bride will have and I believe we're speaking to the Bride of the Lord Jesus [Applause] Christ so we want to get into that affair with him that relationship with him we've been studying what happened with Adam and Eve and comparing it to our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ when God made man he didn't bring the woman with him the spirit of the woman was inside Adam but Adam was without a helpmate now that's a type of God when God was there before cre the universe let's say when he was alone he was Elohim he didn't have anything to worship him he didn't have anybody to speak with it was simply Elohim even we say our brother Bram told us that's when God was not God yet because he didn't have anything or anyone to worship and the word god means a object of worship and when nobody could worship because there was no creation to worship him he was found alone so he began to make angels and the angels God made them a government in heaven he put angels for certain offices and then he said archangels and then he put cherubim [Applause] Sims all type of heavenly beings and they began to give God worship they begin to give him glory and worship but this was not enough for God still when God created the angels He created a being that he could be ruling that up to a certain point he could order that was a type of the animals God placed on Earth God put these animals to serve man he put the lion he put the rooster he put the hen he even put the serpent the being Serpent and the woman being Serpent and those were all under the ruling or government of Adam because Adam was ordained or commanded to rule over the beasts of the earth and over the fouls of the earth and everything was to serve Adam so it was similar when God created the angels and we find out that that was still not enough the scripture says God saw Adam and God said it is not not good for man to be alone in other words he needs a helpmate for him the rooster was not enough the gorilla was not enough Adam wanted to have fellowship with them but he found out he couldn't have that fellowship with them and in the the same manner God when he made the Angels yes they did worship they did serve him but he could not have fellowship with he wanted Fellowship Adam maybe spoke with the gorilla I imagine he would tell him about his day and the gorilla just kept eating his plants and saw him a little strange and Adam maybe said well will there'll be somebody to understand me will there'll be someone comprehending what I'm speaking maybe he spoke with the serpent because the serpent could talk but when he spoke to it that he had a desire to worship His God when he spoke to him of his emotions of when he spoke what was in his soul the serpent could not answer because the serpent was soulless the rooster was soulless the dog was without a soul the lion as strong as he did not have the soul that was inside Adam brother brandom says that's why the human being is different in the animal kingdom because the human being has a soul that's why he dresses different that's why he tries doing things different he has a higher imagination because the soul God put in him makes him different so Adam could not identify with with the hen or the gorilla maybe they were Ser things even with a serpent but something was SE something that didn't allow them to Fellowship they understand each other completely then God said he needs someone to be like him he needs a helpmate he needs someone to be similar to him to have the same feeling the same emotions the same thoughts then God says I will give him a helpmate someone for him to speak with someone that can feel what he's feeling come on church that's what God wants that's what God desires wants a bride a church that feels what he's feeling cannot fill that [Applause] void for the longest time denominations and churches have made us think that we aren't like he is there's a song of Jes Romero I'm sure you've heard it that says he's not like me he's not like me although he has become a man he's not like me thanks to God for a message that began to call a bride and began to tell us that we were made to be like him we were not made to be like the gorilla to be like the serpent when God made man he let make man likeness why brother Bram says God wanted [Applause] Fellowship God wants Fellowship the only way to really have Fellowship you must be like the other person how would I look telling or saying brother Isaac do you know how it feels when your heart is broken and brother Isaac let's say he was a serpent or not a serpent all right but he would say I've never felt that I've never gone through that what type of fellow ship can be between us that's why an angel cannot understand understand God because he was not made to God's image but when God decided to make when God decided to have Fellowship not just be worshiped not only did he want to be worship he wanted Fellowship somebody to understand to understand see him what he truly is he had to make a being that was flesh of his bones of his bones Spirit of his spirit and when he made man he made someone like him he made someone like him church I want to tell you the dev has wanted to lie to us for so long tried to tell us that we aren't like him but we're here to tell you if you are part of the Bride you were made from him of him for him to be like him hallelujah hallelujah we must begin to see ourselves like what he's made us he did not make us to Simply Be robots that come and worship a God he made us to have communion with him understand him to speak with him make love with [Applause] him oh hallelujah hallelujah he wanted to speak with someone he wanted to feel with someone he wanted to accomplish something with someone he didn't only want a lot of worship because let me tell you you can get many compliments from people but if it's not from the person you want them they're not worth the same come on Church yes or yes someone else can tell you look very well but if it's not from the person that you want to hear it from it's not worth the same and it's the same with God the angels can say holy the angels can say I love you God angels can have all type of worship but no one to it like his bride [Applause] no one can do it like his bride no one makes God feel so worship of the Lord Jesus [Applause] Christ you notice why the dev wants to take away your worship we come to church and fail and sin oh we're angry we're sad or we have a temper with something in church and we don't want to worship God anymore first of all what did God do to you come on Church did God do to you to be sad quiet God do to you or did you come to worship the church did you come to worship the are you here to who did you come for today God wants us to know he is searching for this love relationship with us the message god making his promise the prophet speaks about the Dove and Compares it with God's love he says now the dove is the meekest of all the birds that fly in heaven there's nothing like the dove then he says the dove is a lover repeat the dove is a lover the dove CS in the evening how I have listened to that old Dove many times there's nothing there's nothing more beautiful than to hear the dove in the evening coin the turtle dove I remember when I lost my wife when I was just a young Baptist preacher I went out to the grave everying and I'd sit at I'd sit out there as the sun went [Applause] down and seemed like this big old Dove must have knew that I was sad he would come there and sit up in the bush and as the sun was setting and the wind blowing though through the trees he would coup to me nothing more consoling to hear a dove in the evening coing its sweet message it's a lover then he says God is a lover God is love God so of the World when they were unlovable that he gave his son to make them lovable and God here it is God wants to come down and make love to you he's seeking thirsting [Applause] hungering trying to get trying to get to some of your starchy Hearts to make love to you as a love affair not a law but a love it's all in love God so loved that what surprises me the most that's how the prophet says it God is hungering thir thing then you notice how we think that God doesn't need anything how we that he doesn't need anything from us I think that's why many times we reserve ourselves we think he doesn't want it we think he doesn't need it but the prophet tells us he's thirsting God condescended from a form of Elohim condescended to a pillar of fire to the Loos and in that form he could be worshiped he wanted to be worship and every time he was condescending he needed even more [Applause] he made himself in a form where he would need something that blows my mind but Adam is a type of the Lord Jesus Christ and God said it's not good for man to be alone he wanted to speak with he wanted to talk with he didn't need somebody physically speaking physically I'm speaking in your soul someone to understand [Applause] him and God condescended to a point where he could be hungry of or hungry for love thirsting for your loveen not sure if you're listening Church how many believe the prophet of God God is thirsting hungering it would be no good to give God love if he didn't need it sure you understand this makes you think different about God but if he can make himself a man have to eat drink and everything else he can get down to a level where he desires your Worship in one occasion Jesus tells a Samaritan woman I'll read it in joh chapter 4 verse 21 and on Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yeah at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what ye know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him this is incredible now God is searching for worshippers God is searching for someone that can demonstrate come on I don't know if you understand Church of our love just like ad was searching for Fellowship God wants our [Music] fellowship brother Bram says about that Dove God is love he says God is a lover God wants to come down and make love to you he's seeking thirsting hungering Brethren if a dove if a dove can feel says that could feel his sadness his sorrow and would cool began to cool the prophet oh I believe that if God sent Crow to feed Ravens to feed elah God sent Ravens to why not send a dove to co his servant when he was going through the toughest time in his life but if a dve can feel when the human being has pain I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ can feel when his beloved when her beloved is asking for [Applause] something behold I stand at the door and knock behold I am here another quote later on says he is begging will there be a bride that can feel what he is feeling and say God I will give you that [Applause] love some of us say God don't need my worship God doesn't need me to demonstrate that I love him then you haven't understood who you are you haven't understood who you are for God BR brother brandham says go ahead and go jump to the last uh quote say the message the resurrection of Lazarus he says that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal people they don't recognize who they are your sons and daughters of God you have in your hand look then Jesus it was one time quoted in the scripture ye are God look D I'm a part of Charles BR because I was born from Charlie brandham I'm a part of him I've got my forehead like him my hair was like him I'm a small man like him I'm in the nature like him because he's my dad and if we become in spirit sons of God dwells Hallelujah then you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing impossible to God God said nothing impossible with you if you believe it not with god with you is in man oh brother this is what I want us to see are you for God who are you for him you're not just a creation you came out of him part of him an attribute of [Applause] God God needs you if you are his bride identified in him identified in him sometimes we identify with him but we have to identify in him to really understand who we are we need to understand what that he feels like and we feel like he does know this is a little hard to because for so long we've thought that we are very different from God and the devil has made us think that we cannot be equivalent to him but God is here to tell us is here to tell Rise Up from are the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ you are what came out of him [Applause] the very God that stood back there on the mythical platform of eternities and rolled worlds off his hands and created these things give you the privilege to be his son and you're a part of him and God dwells in man and man himself is hallelujah there you are it might choke you I see some of you choking drink a little bit of water spiritual water try to swallow a little but study over that a little he is God dwells and man becomes a Son of God not him and himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation oh my how I think of that then stand with an unwavering Faith ask what you will it'll be done unto you there he is God there he is now we must begin to see ourselves in him you say brother Titus how can I see myself in him you have to identify yourself in him your desires your spiritual desires I'm not speaking of desires of the flesh I'm speaking of spiritual desires your spiritual desires are the same desires that he has they're the same desires inside of God that's why this is important many times we're not able to give love to God or admiration when we don't see ourselves there there's a dictionary that somebody wrote in 1906 it's called The Devil's dictionary it's a book that's written and it's a book with many truths has words and it has the definitions the devil would give it for example for the word prejudice the definition for the devil would be a vagrant opinion without visible means of support think about that prejudice a vagrant opinion without visible means of support that's the truth Prejudice and then the word admiration appears in this dictionary and it says admiration the definition the devil would give it would be our polite recognition of another's resemblance to ourselves many times we don't admire somebody unless they look like us the people we admire are the ones that look like us yes or yes if they look very different from us I don't like them I don't like that doesn't matter how much good they have they're not like I am our polite recognition of another's resemblance to ourselves I believe there's truth in this we can love while it's from ourselves as long as it seems it looks like us we cannot love a gorilla the same way well now I hear different types of things but that's a perverted love that's a perverted love but pure true love someone we can identify come on Church true love pure love identified with someone when you say I am like you you like me we are the [Applause] same that's what God wants to teach us many times we can't love him admire him think he's too different from us yes or yes brother we come to church and we see him afar when he's right here he's loving you he's ministering to you what are you doing for him how would you like it that you tell your spouse I love you you're everything for me and they would just look at you like be honest how would you like it be honest if you gave it all if you tried everything you could with your spouse your children anybody and you say I love you look everything I'm doing for you and they just okay I ask myself if that's the reason why there's no Worship in church I ask myself if that's the reason why people are quiet because they simply don't identify with him come on Church he's simply not on your team if it was your team I would be shouting be glad May he's not on your team hallelujah hallelujah but I want to tell you is my team he's my hero he's my love what I [Applause] want that's why we're so still and quiet meet somebody like you and look how glad you will be do you like this I love this and one day we best [Applause] friends just find somebody that roots for the same team you do and your best friends yes or yes but what happens when there's a bride that sees herself self in the gr that says I have the same heart he does I have the same desires he does I want to be because he wants to be L I desire to hear a word how many desire to hear Words of Love be honest Church there's not a human being on the earth that doesn't want be spoken to a word of love but to give it we want it we want to receive it but don't want to give it but when you say he also desires he wants my devotion he has the same desires he wants me to worship good bad times that I give him my love he desires for me to see him above all he desires for me to not look left or right he desires can I not be searching for something different just like I desire desires it [Applause] also prise God is looking and trying and moving and begging and persuading to find a little heart that he can come into and cool and make love to that's our God that's my Lord he's Desiring that worship from his children that that only his children can give him do you know when God decided to manifest his attributes was because there would be someone that would need these attributes not only need them they would love that about him he said I will be a savior now he needed for us to be lost he needed us to make mistakes yes or yes so that he could show that attribute of himself so that he could I will be your savior do you notice God wants to be our savior do you know he wants to show his love toward us don't feel bad that you've sin don't feel bad that You' Fallen remember there's someone waiting for you there's someone that wants to help you why he wants our worship he wants our love he wants us to see him and say Lord no one has saved me like you he wants for us to say I needed a savior the brother could have sister could couldn't save me you my lord you could save me saved me forgave me helped me he said I want to be your healer and he allows the devil to come and the devil to come and brings us sickness and mental instability and depression and spiritual situations he allowed him why does he allow them because he wanted to be our [Applause] deliverer he wanted to be our hero he wanted us to admire him hallelujah hallelujah he is my deliverer he comes take out bad thoughts out of my mind take out roots of bitterness to fight against the enemy begin to fight for my soul and what does he expect from you come to him and say oh God how great thou are strong Thou Are or you think the man of the house is the only one that wants that wants that brother brandom says when the man of the house comes and his wife receives him with a kiss in his in his cheek that makes all the difference he says you think only man you think God doesn't need that that only man needs that you think God doesn't need me to tell him thank you God you're my deliverer he said I'm so struggling how good does he feel when you're still struggling and his wife says I know you will help me I know you will not leave me here I know you haven't forsaken me oh I believe I believe that gives strength to the Holy Spirit God says how can I not help her if she's trusting in [Applause] me how can I not help her when she trusts [Applause] me there's qualities in a woman definitely a man doesn't have them when he says when they say when she tells her husband her spouse she says I'm sure you're going to help me there's something that moves man's heart there's something that I don't know how I'm going to do it know how I'm going to but I'll accomplish because she is trusting in me how much more there's a bride there's a pride saying God you will deliver me from this I'm struggling but you will my heart is trusting in [Music] you oh hallelujah hallelujah you know why God sometimes doesn't do anything there's not a true worship in us and there's not a true worship because we don't admire [Music] him we don't admire our Lord Isaiah 53 says who has believed our report and upon who is the strong arm of the [Applause] Lord I have it right there but just try to translate and like a root in dry ground for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he have no form for nor comeliness that happened with Israel they didn't see Beauty in him they didn't see a reason to love him they saw like just the bride doesn't see just any man the bride sees his character the pr is what type of person God is he's a man of his word he's a man that gives everything he is a lover and the bride sees him say I can't help but to be in love with him how can I not be in love with [Applause] him brother Victor how can I not be in love with him I have seen him he has manifested in my life I have believed him I have trusted him I have trusted him he is good he is great he's [Music] everything give God GL give God grace give him Grace give him love [Applause] not a rude and dry ground for mejah Hallelujah he's not just anybody for me I have found everything I want everything I [Applause] desire he understands he compreh he doesn't accuse me he doesn't accuse [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me the musicians can come I love how Isaiah 25 says oh Lord thou are my God I will exalt the I will praise thy name for thou has done wonderful things I will praise and exalt he wants our praise he's searching for worshippers When I See This song he is not like me I find out that it's not true he is like me although he has become a man and I called him by his name he's not like me but he gave me his name he called me his he wouldn't fall in love with somebody that's not like him he wouldn't fall in love with somebody that wouldn't fill his heart the song keeps saying he's not like me although in everything heed he is clean and sinless he's not like me nevertheless the Bible says that his bride is without spa and blemish there's no sin in her on there's no sin in you if he is Holy You Are Holy because he gave you his Holiness Hallelujah there's no sin in his bride she is like he holy like is she is pure like she is [Applause] Hallelujah the S say he's not like me he is Holy and he is perfect is Sublime and
