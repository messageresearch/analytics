our pastors we're ready to hear words of life amen came for that amen [Music] he is [Music] [Music] as please [Music] do with me [Music] [Music] [Music] 20 minutes [Music] with me foreign [Music] in service right these things say thee that I have the seven spirits of God and it's the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou has a name that thou livest and are dead we watch phone strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found that works perfect before God let us pray once again we enter in this church age of sardisan we ask for your guidance yes you speak to us thank you for allowing us to be gathered with my brothers everything you do in our lives Lord Jesus Christ amen we're speaking on the Sardis Church age we are finished going through the different verses of the Sardis Church now we're only giving a summary if you remember Iglesia every church had a messenger and there was something wrong they were doing something good they were doing and they had a reward yes these four things today we'll find out what they were doing wrong last week we spoke about the Messengers foreign [Music] patience reveals we don't know the older I hear that you have it every everything you understand everything that's happening but I don't blame them in that situation I thought I knew things better than ever but I realize I don't know a lot I don't know one thing we do know is that we love this message he knows then he will help they're great but God fills every one of them um he says I know that works in other words you think you live but are dead another recommendation is in other words pay attention open your eyes many things you have that are we find out there's a gap in our knowledge we find out that we don't really know those things can someone here explain to me how a zipper works but when we ask you explain it you realize well no say I don't know how does it work I don't know amen amen we find out there are so many things we most likely don't know how they work we don't understand what truly makes it work because most no one knows what's behind all that is that there are many things we don't understand many things we don't know I believe this is one of the things it's important to review what you've learned so you can learn more what you think you know many things perfection now many of us ES many times can't even explain why people don't want to be around us sometimes I'm gonna get in here a little porque because I find out before you take a step from patience to Godliness Como let's set them as they can be husbands be the mother of the house it can be any type of leadership Familia speakers foreign [Music] [Music] when you are that's what we're doing he wants to bring us once again we're not better than the rest is areas your loss or devaluing you is implemented that person does not want to be around them or following them are you with me at One Superior they act Superior personas that type of people they simply think they know more que valenas they're worth more than they can more than everyone else I believe that's why God humbles us puts us at a stop now I will stop you a little bit before everything for taking it we used to understand that you don't know it's not by God's grace and normally he refuses but someone that knows they think they're better that's why God stops it stops the sardisian church it turns us to the beginning I'm not better than my brother my sister I am not better than my brothers if you think you are better you will have very little patience for them amen amen normalmente normally when someone thinks they know Allah is critical Norm normally it's more crucial or he's more critical or tough with everyone else yes and they are softer with themselves many times we judge people by their actions and we judge ourselves by our intentions us to be tougher with the rest and easier with ourselves we want to have all the patients of the world because what I intended to do is we only want to see what they do what they didn't do is with me brethren a person that thinks they know a lot a person that thinks that they know a lot won't hear the rest are with me God says to the Sardis Church hear what the spirit says unto the church we all have a literal here very few have a spiritual years truly hear the rest when you say [Music] but truly they don't want the pastor's opinion I know better they say that we only hear or listen to 50 of that that comes into our brain of that 50 that comes into our mind our conscience we only understand 50 of that means only 25 of everything we heard we don't understand them Amen to that they always only remember the jokes you said or they're good stories I'm just kidding brother now look someone that will hear someone else will learn a lot somos many times it's not lack of intelligence it's not that you're not smart many times they say you don't know how to listen so many problems we go through it's only because we don't hear well muchos de los problemas many of the problems it's because we don't hear what we're being told and if we do here we don't accept it and if we accept it we don't do it very a few people that understand something and do it but listen if you stop for a moment we need to learn to stop you see it and say maybe I can learn something if you really truly listen to your brother you will notice that you understand them better and if you succeed to understand your brother more you will be more patient with them if there's a reason why we don't have patience is because we don't understand them someone say Amen the reason we're not patients the reason I'm not patients it's because sometimes I don't understand anything their way I have very little patience okay but when you can understand someone you say wow I never knew that I didn't understand that so I didn't know that the reason you have yourself so much patience because you know things others don't usted the reason why we're not patient with others is because we don't understand them because they're not like we are foreign things it's hearing each other are you with me hearing this is to say I'm gonna stop here I'm gonna sit down I'm Gonna Be watchful I'm gonna learn something about my brother why is he struggling so much why does it seem he's in the same picture every year I'm gonna hear him out I'll try to understand him but we won't hear Gucci Mane listen we will never listen truly listen not just here truly listen if we think that we already know if I think I already know how much I already know my sister oh this brother is [Music] and I don't take the time to say brother sister what is happening what's going on in your life as long as you think you know you won't listen your ears takes takes us down from the horse he blinds our eyes we can learn wow I need to learn we need a beginner's mind that's what God is trying to do through patience I'm not sure how many guys but sometimes put us in a problem so our ears can be opened and now we say well Lord teach me something yes I thought that I knew okay what I knew I didn't know show me teach me show me what I'm doing what's going on in my life if you don't become as children no foreign know everything [Applause] your wisdom amen man is to learn to listen more than speaking we need to learn to listen truly listen we are not listening have you um how many times because we're thinking about everything we need to do so we learned to listen we must learn to listen what we speak someone that speaks more than what they listen it's because they think they know more she doesn't see you as simple as that is someone that speaks more than what they listen it's because they think they know more me call me help me hear that smooth voice of yours are you that man I know they see Tanto help me not say so much I think we would get rid of so many problems if we didn't speak so much and we only heard earlier speak when we need to speak but listen well foreign [Music] don't make me post foreign of God what God has said and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling oh brother do you realize that's where God that's where God can help us not in our own knowledge I don't know anything many of us don't even have time to pray then wait it's hard to wait foreign amen waiting on God we're such in a rush that's why God can't reveal more [Music] we can't stay still we're in the age of entertainment when it's something entertaining us every moment if we knew that that was what's hurting us so much sometimes we're like my children I'm bored they say no say I don't know what else to do just because they're not on tablets there's so much to do I tell them go sweep go learn something well that's how we are sometimes we can't stay it's hard to stay still but it's in Stillness where God can reveal where you can hear God's words when you make time God makes time for you Be watchful says God yeah and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God is God is telling them stop [Music] [Music] don't do anything else without hearing from God stop if you learn this you will learn that patience is so useful so mighty so many demons that will be defeated mucho not because you're able to do so much but because you know how to wait on God problemas there's so many problems we have today simply because we couldn't wait we didn't know how to listen we didn't know how to watch let's all stand everything begins with you saying no se I don't know I don't know so many things Lord is teach me to listen to listen to you so listen to my brother my wife but you know that we're all struggling they have something to teach me you have something that should teach me every time I sit with one of you yeah I want to learn I want to learn what you struggle with I want to really hear your pain so here are your struggles how to pray for you how to ask God for above all to understand you more that's what we should do with each other open our ears what do you have to teach me let me really listen to you let us pray Lord Jesus Hermanos
