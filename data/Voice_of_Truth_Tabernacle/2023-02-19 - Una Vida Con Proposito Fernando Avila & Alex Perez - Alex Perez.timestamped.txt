[13:00] greetings to the church
[13:07] Fernando and their family
[13:09] California
[13:11] and as you're standing
[13:14] yes
[13:16] they're in the Book of Matthew
[13:19] says
[13:26] chapter verse 44 to 46 Matthew 13.
[13:37] amen
[13:39] the word of God says
[13:53] the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure
[13:56] hidden in a field when a man found it he
[13:58] hid it again and then his Joy went and
[14:01] sold all he had and bought that field
[14:09] again the Kingdom of Heaven is like a
[14:12] merchant looking for fine pearls
[14:22] when he found a one of Great Value he
[14:25] went away and sold everything he had and
[14:27] bought it
[14:32] Lord Heavenly loving father gracias
[14:35] foreign
[15:09] [Music]
[15:25] [Music]
[15:45] everything you've lived through
[15:49] you'll see things at maybe
[15:54] we're pointless
[15:57] yeah they're useful for something good
[16:02] and with this I like to get into the
[16:04] story
[16:18] is
[16:27] when they serve a drink to the king uh
[16:33] Maya's job
[16:36] and taste the drink yes that's right
[16:39] before giving it to the king
[16:43] is
[16:46] the reason why that was done
[16:49] was because in Persia
[16:54] they were known for giving the the king
[16:57] poisonous
[16:59] kill him get rid of him
[17:02] so nemaya lived every day
[17:07] knowing that that might be his last day
[17:13] I didn't know if he would drink a cup
[17:15] with poison
[17:17] but I
[17:21] with a purpose yes
[17:25] and in the same manner God puts us in
[17:29] places
[17:31] from there comes our purpose
[17:35] It won't always be about living our own
[17:38] lives
[18:03] revolves around them
[18:06] a selfish person
[18:09] is before anything
[18:15] I've said it many times they suffer um
[18:28] I had never lived for others
[19:07] the church enjoys it
[19:11] what are we doing foreign
[19:49] and like I told you living for others
[19:52] yes yes
[20:00] of his fathers
[20:03] were in Ruins
[20:08] I believe Nehemiah had no need
[20:13] in working with the king I believe he
[20:15] had everything foreign
[20:35] [Music]
[21:04] [Applause]
[21:11] in that church
[21:17] with our hands arms crossed
[21:22] they say that's the church's business
[21:26] but I'll give you a dollar here
[21:31] we need of everything this building has
[21:33] this is
[21:36] forgive me
[21:41] we enjoy the food after service
[21:45] come on
[21:46] [Music]
[21:50] we must live with a purpose
[21:53] forgive me brethren
[22:02] is
[22:03] let me ask you what leads you guess
[22:07] what moves
[22:12] a person that can't control their
[22:14] Spirits
[22:17] the Bible says
[22:21] the person that can't control their
[22:25] Spirits
[22:26] can't control their speak speech strike
[22:31] versus
[22:33] sometimes we can't control our thoughts
[22:37] our walls are torn down
[22:46] and anything leaves
[22:49] in other words
[22:52] any little thing comes and attacks us
[22:56] and any little thing leaves
[23:46] we shouldn't be doing
[24:21] that's right
[24:26] when you find what moves you
[24:30] know
[24:32] moves your interior being
[24:35] is
[24:40] what this world offers
[24:52] oh this is
[24:55] sometimes we're waiting for God to touch
[24:57] us
[24:59] well God needs us to move sometimes
[25:05] because how can you move a car that's
[25:07] parked
[25:09] foreign
[25:51] sometimes we want things from this world
[25:55] sometimes we don't think things right
[26:03] lately if you see my search history it's
[26:06] all trucks
[26:13] but then I think and what do I need a
[26:16] truck for no La necesito I don't need it
[26:20] I'm still just one person I'm by myself
[26:23] right now
[26:25] [Applause]
[26:35] I want to Satisfy My Flesh
[26:41] for more than that
[26:46] is
[26:56] the god that is
[26:59] more than words
[27:46] [Music]
[27:49] to receive
[27:56] um
[27:57] the message questions and answers
[28:02] brother Branham says
[28:07] do you love him with all your heart
[28:10] isn't he wonderful
[28:12] what could we do
[28:15] now
[28:18] could you tell me anything that would be
[28:20] great
[28:24] if you can show me something great
[28:28] then I'll sell out
[28:34] that's greater than this yes
[29:05] what's the point of having everything
[29:08] if we're going to lose our soul
[29:12] you can please stand
[29:17] the Bible says who wants to save their
[29:21] life well shall lose it
[29:24] so he that loses his life
