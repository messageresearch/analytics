[37:59] um tell somebody next to
[38:04] you
[38:06] amen amen amen and I'm going to be
[38:09] talking about the third point that I
[38:14] made I I said this be ready to be a
[38:19] leader be ready to serve in
[38:24] anything be ready to do more than
[38:28] others if you want to be a leader of
[38:32] other you have to be willing to do more
[38:35] than
[38:36] others be ready to give yourself
[38:41] completely when you find your
[38:43] calling be willing to give up so that
[38:46] you can go
[38:47] [Music]
[38:49] up now uh uh we're going to talk about
[38:52] being a
[38:54] leader and and we're all all called to
[38:57] be
[38:58] leaders I'm going to say it again we're
[39:00] all called to be
[39:02] leaders every single one of us if you're
[39:05] a child of
[39:07] God if you're part of the
[39:09] Bride you were called to be a
[39:12] leader you were called to not only look
[39:18] after
[39:20] yourself but to look after
[39:23] others I don't want to get to heaven and
[39:27] and tell the lord well I made it Lord
[39:30] who cares about the
[39:32] rest if I get to heaven I want to take
[39:35] others with me I want to help others get
[39:40] there I want to do my
[39:43] best to leave a a
[39:46] footprints that other people can
[39:48] follow I want to know that I helped
[39:51] others make it as
[39:53] well we are all called to be leaders
[39:58] God told the people of
[39:59] Israel that if they would follow what he
[40:03] had
[40:04] established they follow his
[40:07] Commandments then they would be head and
[40:11] not a
[40:14] tail God wants us to be a
[40:17] head and not a
[40:20] tail and I like the way I like the way
[40:23] John Quincy Adams says this John Quincy
[40:26] Adam
[40:28] about the definition of a
[40:31] leader he said if your actions Inspire
[40:36] others to dream
[40:39] more learn more do more become more then
[40:45] you are a
[40:47] leader I'm going to say it again if your
[40:50] actions Inspire
[40:53] others now I love that he says actions
[40:58] because it's your
[40:59] actions which will inspire
[41:02] others if your actions Inspire
[41:06] others to dream more learn more do more
[41:11] become more then you are a
[41:14] leader now a
[41:16] leader doesn't start up in the
[41:20] front a a leader actually usually starts
[41:25] in the back
[41:27] if you're waiting to get to the
[41:31] front so that you can be a
[41:34] leader you have no idea what it means to
[41:37] be a
[41:39] leader a true
[41:43] leader doesn't need to be in in the
[41:46] [Music]
[41:48] spotlight so so that he can lead so that
[41:51] he can Inspire others or so that she can
[41:54] Inspire others
[41:57] they can Inspire
[41:59] others from wherever they are
[42:04] at like the song
[42:06] says shine in the light where you are
[42:09] the place where you
[42:12] are the light doesn't shine upon the
[42:16] leader the leader shines where he
[42:20] is there is light coming out of him
[42:22] where he is now now uh I like the way
[42:26] Timo uh Timothy the book of Timothy puts
[42:31] it take heed unto
[42:35] thyself and unto the the
[42:38] doctrine continue in them for in doing
[42:41] this Thou shalt both save
[42:44] thyself and them that hear
[42:48] thee and the reason I like
[42:51] this is because it's telling
[42:54] us that you cannot give what you don't
[42:58] have if you don't if you don't become
[43:02] what you're trying to
[43:05] project then you won't have people to
[43:11] inspire it people follow not what you
[43:16] say they follow what you do they get
[43:20] inspired by what you
[43:22] do not by what you
[43:25] say so so uh Paul's telling
[43:29] Timothy take heed of Unto
[43:32] thyself and another words you have to go
[43:37] first you have to go first you can't
[43:40] expect to help
[43:43] others unless you help yourself
[43:47] first can can you repeat after
[43:50] me I need to lead
[43:53] myself before I can lead others
[43:57] now you can fake
[43:59] it but but you won't fake it for too
[44:03] long sooner or later people realize what
[44:06] you're made
[44:08] of and if you haven't learned how to
[44:10] take control of
[44:15] yourself lead
[44:17] yourself sooner or later people will
[44:20] realize
[44:22] that amen and they won't want to follow
[44:25] you
[44:32] now verse
[44:36] 12 of the same
[44:39] chapter uh uh says
[44:42] this let no man despise thy
[44:52] youth I want to stop there for a little
[44:54] bit
[44:56] uh the the first person that despises
[44:59] your youth many
[45:05] times is many times
[45:13] yourself you don't realize what you are
[45:16] capable
[45:19] of you think you're just a
[45:23] youth you feel like sometimes you feel
[45:26] like well I'm just I'm just a member of
[45:28] the
[45:31] church I can't do
[45:33] much I can just do this or I can't just
[45:36] do
[45:37] that you're limiting
[45:40] yourself but but I
[45:44] wish my desire as pastor of Voice of
[45:47] Truth
[45:50] Tabernacle is that from this
[45:53] church leaders would rise up
[45:57] we don't just want church
[45:59] members we don't just want church
[46:02] members I don't just want church
[46:06] members I would like leaders to rise
[46:09] up people who can go forth and help
[46:14] others people who can be an inspiration
[46:17] for others people who are willing to do
[46:20] more than just come to
[46:23] [Music]
[46:24] church just and just uh play an
[46:28] instrument you can do a lot
[46:31] more tell somebody you can do a lot
[46:36] more now do you believe that do you
[46:39] believe that church do you believe that
[46:42] you can do a lot more than what you're
[46:44] doing I don't care how much you think
[46:46] you're
[46:47] doing you can do
[46:50] more so the first person
[46:53] that the first person
[46:57] that despises your
[46:59] youth many times is
[47:02] yourself you got to
[47:05] realize no matter if you're 12 13 14
[47:08] years
[47:10] old you can do a lot for
[47:12] God I'm going to say it again you can do
[47:14] a lot for
[47:16] God there are many examples in the Bible
[47:19] of so many
[47:22] youth that were able to do so much for
[47:25] God
[47:29] you don't need to you don't even need to
[47:31] be in your
[47:32] teens you don't need to be in your 20s
[47:36] you don't need to be in your 30s you can
[47:38] do so much for God if you're willing to
[47:43] pay the price and believe in yourself
[47:47] and believe in the gift that God has
[47:49] given you and believe that God called
[47:51] you for something I I'll say it again
[47:54] God called you for something
[47:57] God called you for something and you got
[47:59] to
[48:01] believe in
[48:11] yourself what are you waiting
[48:16] for youth what are you waiting
[48:19] for you waiting to get older to do
[48:23] something to give all for
[48:27] to be
[48:28] productive you're waiting to get older
[48:31] it's just going to get harder the older
[48:33] you
[48:36] get for you to accomplish
[48:40] anything you got to take advantage of
[48:43] the years that you have
[48:46] now right now it's such a great
[48:50] opportunity a lot of you don't have to
[48:52] pay
[48:53] rent or at least you don't you don't
[48:55] have to to pay all the
[48:57] bills a lot of you have a lot of time
[49:01] because you don't have to take care of
[49:02] kids or take your honey out or this or
[49:05] the
[49:06] other this is a great
[49:09] time to give yourself to God commit
[49:13] yourself to him consecrate yourself to
[49:16] him and say Lord what have you called me
[49:21] for this is the time that you go to God
[49:25] and you tell him God what is my calling
[49:29] for what did you call me for what was I
[49:32] made
[49:37] for my heart
[49:40] burns because I see so many youth
[49:44] wasting their youth they wasting
[49:49] it when you could be doing so much
[49:51] already for
[49:53] God I'm not talking to some other Church
[49:56] I'm not talking to some other youth I'm
[49:58] not talking to the ministers here I'm
[50:01] talking to you youth I'm speaking you
[50:03] you could be doing so much more for
[50:08] God where are the
[50:10] parents who are pushing their
[50:13] children to do
[50:17] more you think it's enough to just come
[50:19] to church you think it's enough for them
[50:21] just to sing a good song or to song lead
[50:23] or to interpret or to that's not enough
[50:27] they can be doing so much more for
[50:32] God many times we as
[50:36] parents don't believe in our
[50:39] youth we don't believe that they are
[50:41] called with a Divine
[50:42] Purpose we don't see those we don't
[50:46] searing them
[50:54] out
[50:56] our youth they need to hear the need to
[50:58] hear
[51:00] us tell
[51:02] them you were made for so much more son
[51:06] you were made for so much more daughter
[51:09] you could already be doing so much more
[51:11] for
[51:12] God they need to hear us they need to
[51:16] see
[51:20] us let no man despise thy
[51:23] youth but we do
[51:29] as parents we we we
[51:34] do as youth we
[51:41] do
[51:43] but be thou an example of the
[51:50] Believers so a true
[51:54] leader
[51:56] is an example to
[52:00] others you can't preach where you don't
[52:05] live you can't lead nobody when you
[52:07] don't you're not doing it
[52:11] yourself many people want to give
[52:14] orders they they like the
[52:17] power but the problem with that they
[52:20] never worked on
[52:22] themselves they never worked on
[52:24] themselves their character is way down
[52:27] here and they want to be up here in the
[52:31] position and sometimes they get up
[52:34] here sometimes they rise up but their
[52:38] character stay down
[52:40] here and let me tell you you won't stay
[52:42] up there for too
[52:44] long whatever you
[52:47] got you're going to lose it sooner later
[52:50] because your character never rose up to
[52:52] the level of the position that you're
[52:56] in and you're going to lose it there's
[52:59] people who become ministers who become
[53:01] pastors who
[53:02] become who become
[53:05] missionaries but their character never
[53:07] be came up to that
[53:09] level so their body was up there their
[53:12] title was up
[53:13] there but their character was never up
[53:17] there so they they're going to
[53:20] fall sooner or later they're going to
[53:22] fall sooner or later they're going to
[53:24] lose that
[53:27] because you got to work on yourself
[53:30] first you got to work on being an
[53:34] example and then he tells you be an
[53:36] example in
[53:41] word what do you say what do you speak
[53:44] you got to be an
[53:47] example what words come out of your
[53:50] mouth in conversation in in in in when
[53:54] it says conversation talking
[53:56] conduct how's your
[53:59] conduct how's your conduct around
[54:03] others you got to be the
[54:06] example Church Voice of Truth
[54:11] Tabernacle I I believe God called us not
[54:13] to be the
[54:14] tail God called us to be the example for
[54:17] others other people come to this church
[54:21] they they should see you that are the
[54:22] example for others
[54:32] do you believe that
[54:34] church do you believe that you can be
[54:36] the
[54:40] example says in conversation and
[54:49] charity in charity and
[54:53] love now being the example
[54:56] example means you you go first you do it
[55:00] first you don't wait for others to do it
[55:02] before you
[55:04] do you know no nobody
[55:06] remembers the person who does it second
[55:08] or third or fourth you always remember
[55:11] the person who did it
[55:13] first the person who helped you first
[55:17] the person who came to you
[55:22] first that's what being a leader means
[55:25] that you do it first you don't wait for
[55:26] others to do it you do it when others
[55:29] don't want to do
[55:31] it you do it when no one
[55:36] else everybody just looking at each
[55:39] other come on youth I've seen it a lot
[55:43] of times everybody just starts looking
[55:45] at each
[55:46] other this is not just for the Youth I
[55:48] hope this is for the ministers I hope
[55:50] this is for the people who serve in this
[55:52] church I hope this is for the parent for
[55:55] the mothers for everybody
[55:59] else everybody just looking at each
[56:01] other to see who's going to do it that
[56:04] shows that you're not a leader yet you
[56:06] got to be the
[56:07] example if you're a leader listen to me
[56:12] I'm talking to the whole
[56:13] church I'm talking to people who are in
[56:15] leadership right now too if you're a
[56:18] leader you have to be the
[56:20] example you don't put other people to do
[56:24] something you're not willing
[56:32] do you have to be the
[56:39] example
[56:41] amen glory to God glor
[56:45] Amen in conversation in charity in
[56:47] spirit and faith and
[56:51] Purity in all things uh he
[56:55] Titus 2:7 in all things showing thyself
[56:57] a pattern of good
[57:04] works like an
[57:06] example you're going to be the
[57:09] example that others will
[57:13] follow you're not going to wait for
[57:15] somebody else to do it you're not going
[57:17] to wait for somebody else to ask you to
[57:19] do it you're not going to
[57:22] wait for somebody to tell you to do it
[57:26] you're just going to do it because you
[57:29] know it has to be
[57:31] done because you know that somebody has
[57:33] to do it you have to be the that
[57:40] example now you got to be
[57:46] humble a true leader is
[57:50] humble he he doesn't go around parading
[57:53] before everybody no
[58:04] sounding the
[58:05] trumpet a true leader doesn't do
[58:11] it he doesn't do what he
[58:14] does so that other people will give him
[58:21] glory a true leader does it
[58:25] because he sees what he's called to
[58:30] do he knows that he's called to
[58:34] serve that's why Jesus says who whoever
[58:37] wants to be a great person among you a
[58:40] leader you have to become a
[58:43] servant you have to you have to humble
[58:46] yourself uh uh uh
[58:49] um James 4:10
[58:52] says humble yourself in the sight of the
[58:57] Lord and He Shall lift you
[59:00] up it's God who lifts you
[59:03] up you don't have to lift yourself up
[59:06] Let God lift you
[59:08] up let God lift you up when you've done
[59:11] the
[59:13] work when you've you've submitted
[59:15] yourself to the
[59:17] Lord and you've humbled yourself and
[59:20] you've just done what needs to be done
[59:23] God will open the doors for
[59:27] you don't you don't have to be telling
[59:29] everybody what you've done I don't like
[59:31] it when people tell me everything
[59:33] they've
[59:36] done I don't like
[59:39] it I don't I don't I don't like people
[59:41] boasting about what they've done if
[59:44] you're going to do something just do it
[59:46] sooner or later we'll find out sooner or
[59:49] later God will show
[59:51] it sooner or later somebody will thank
[59:53] you for it
[59:55] you don't have to be telling everybody
[59:56] what you've done oh I help this person
[59:58] and I help this person oh and I gave
[1:00:00] this and I gave
[1:00:04] that that just shows you're looking for
[1:00:06] Glory you because you want the
[1:00:12] glory you want the
[1:00:14] attention that's not that's not a right
[1:00:18] motive if you go after that
[1:00:20] motive if that's what motivates you
[1:00:23] sooner or later you
[1:00:26] realize that the way of the
[1:00:28] Lord is not is not a way of
[1:00:34] Glory with God you don't go up by
[1:00:38] seeking
[1:00:40] glory god whoever humbles himself will
[1:00:44] be
[1:00:49] exalted is that right or is that right
[1:00:51] come on Church correct is correct
[1:00:55] if you really want to be a
[1:00:59] leader and you
[1:01:02] should you should want to be a leader
[1:01:05] you are called to be a
[1:01:07] leader you're called to do more for God
[1:01:10] then you got to be a
[1:01:12] servant 1 Corinthians
[1:01:16] 10:33 Paul says
[1:01:18] this even as I please all man men in all
[1:01:23] things
[1:01:27] not seeking my own
[1:01:30] profit but the profit of many that they
[1:01:34] may be
[1:01:35] saved now that's that's
[1:01:38] Paul Paul is say telling us this is the
[1:01:41] way I
[1:01:42] serve Paul was a great
[1:01:45] leader he was one of the best leaders
[1:01:48] the New
[1:01:49] Testament and he tells us how it should
[1:01:51] be
[1:01:53] done he said says this is the way you do
[1:01:56] it you try to seek others
[1:02:00] uh uh you try to seek others
[1:02:05] profits you try to make sure others are
[1:02:09] well because you're called to be a
[1:02:13] servant are you listening to me
[1:02:15] church can you say can you say after me
[1:02:18] I
[1:02:19] was to be a
[1:02:23] servant oh people people like being in
[1:02:26] position of
[1:02:27] leadership because they think they can
[1:02:29] order somebody
[1:02:31] else the leader is not the one that's
[1:02:33] supposed to be just ordering other
[1:02:35] people to do it they're the ones are
[1:02:37] supposed to be doing more than
[1:02:41] others if you're doing less than the
[1:02:44] others you're not being a
[1:02:50] leader oh I'm just going to tell you
[1:02:52] what to
[1:02:53] do
[1:02:55] go about the back door and we see you
[1:02:57] guys next
[1:03:03] time that's not true
[1:03:07] leadership people want to be in
[1:03:09] leadership because they want to tell
[1:03:10] other people what to
[1:03:13] do that's not the way to do it they want
[1:03:17] to give everybody else what they
[1:03:21] think that's not the way Paul did it
[1:03:25] Paul said I seek to serve
[1:03:27] others I seek to please
[1:03:30] others what's what what do do the
[1:03:33] majority want how can how can I be of
[1:03:36] the greatest uh H H uh benefit to the
[1:03:39] [Applause]
[1:03:41] majority not what I
[1:03:43] want but what what do the people
[1:03:47] need I'm here to serve
[1:03:53] them
[1:03:55] amen
[1:03:58] amen you can be hurting
[1:04:02] sometimes you can be sad
[1:04:04] sometimes but you don't pass that on to
[1:04:08] others you don't say well I'm just I'm
[1:04:10] just not feeling it
[1:04:13] today no you just you you seek what's
[1:04:16] best for everybody
[1:04:22] else if they need you to be strong you
[1:04:25] you need to be
[1:04:30] strong you're a
[1:04:33] servant I'll talk a little bit more
[1:04:34] about that in in a little
[1:04:38] bit Proverbs 2229
[1:04:42] says sees thou a man diligent in his
[1:04:48] business he shall stand before
[1:04:52] Kings he shall not stand before mean
[1:04:59] men now a
[1:05:03] leader he seeks to be the best he can
[1:05:07] be he seeks to do everything the best
[1:05:13] possible a true
[1:05:15] leader he he
[1:05:18] doesn't just do a mediocre
[1:05:21] job he doesn't just say oh well uh
[1:05:25] that's okay no a true
[1:05:27] leader wants to do the best he can
[1:05:31] do when you're called to do
[1:05:34] something you want to do the
[1:05:37] best you want to give your best
[1:05:41] effort I don't like it I don't I don't I
[1:05:45] don't like it when song leaders come up
[1:05:47] here come
[1:05:50] here they haven't
[1:05:52] practiced they haven't they haven't
[1:05:54] spent
[1:05:56] time preparing themselves that just
[1:05:59] shows me they don't want to do their
[1:06:04] best if you want to do your
[1:06:06] best you're going to work at it you're
[1:06:09] going to sweat it

[1:16:02] preach you got to be
[1:16:05] sincere your word your word has to mean
[1:16:09] something people have to be able to

[1:16:25] time one day you're down one day you're
[1:16:29] up one day you kind of let let's do it
[1:16:32] let's do it Church let's do
[1:16:33] it there a bunch of hypocrit I don't
[1:16:37] want I don't think I feel up to
[1:16:41] it people are getting like man I don't I
[1:16:43] don't can't trust this
[1:16:46] guy you know many parents that's the
[1:16:49] reason their children don't follow
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:16:52] them
[1:16:54] they tell them I'm I'm going to punish
[1:16:56] you they never punish them you think
[1:17:00] they're going to trust what they
[1:17:03] say it just takes one or two times for
[1:17:05] you to do that and then they don't
[1:17:06] believe
[1:17:08] you if you tell your children you're
[1:17:10] going to do something do
[1:17:17] it I'm sorry I'm just all
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:24] I'd rather not open my
[1:17:26] mouth people tell me brother can you do
[1:17:28] this I don't know I said let me think
[1:17:30] about it I don't want to commit to
[1:17:32] anything you guys know me right you guys
[1:17:34] know
[1:17:35] me because if I commit I have it on my
[1:17:38] conscience it matters to
[1:17:41] me if I tell my children something I got
[1:17:45] to do
[1:17:47] it because if I don't I want them to
[1:17:50] believe
[1:17:51] me I want them to know that when I say
[1:17:53] something they can trust and they know
[1:17:56] it's going to
[1:18:01] happen you guys are a little quiet
[1:18:05] today I hope it's because you guys are
[1:18:07] thinking about
[1:18:15] it you want your children to follow
[1:18:21] you you have to be a person of your
[1:18:24] word you have to follow what you
[1:18:32] say are you listening
[1:18:34] Church do what you say you're going to
[1:18:36] do if you say you're going to be her at
[1:18:38] seven be here at
[1:18:40] 7even if you say you're going to be here
[1:18:42] at 7even if you say you're going to be
[1:18:44] here on time be here on time if
[1:18:46] something got in the way then
[1:18:47] communicate
[1:18:49] it people need to be able to trust you
[1:18:57] are you listening church this not part
[1:19:00] of
[1:19:03] it this is all part of
[1:19:11] it Titus 2:7
[1:19:16] says in Doctrine showing uncorrupt
[1:19:19] gravity
[1:19:21] sincerity
[1:19:24] you have to be serious about what you're
[1:19:30] doing you got to you got to understand
[1:19:32] this
[1:19:33] is whatever God called you to
[1:19:37] do you got to take it
[1:19:39] seriously you got to say this is my
[1:19:42] responsibility this is my job and I got
[1:19:45] to do it right and I'm going to take it
[1:19:47] seriously I'm not going to be playing
[1:19:48] around with
[1:19:51] it
[1:19:55] a true leader learns from others listens
[1:19:57] to
[1:19:59] others Hebrews 13:7 says remember them
[1:20:02] which have the rule over
[1:20:07] you who have spoken unto you the word of
[1:20:12] God whose Faith
[1:20:18] follow considering the end of their
[1:20:20] conversation yes
[1:20:24] you can always learn from others you
[1:20:27] should always be learning from others
[1:20:30] you should always be
[1:20:31] growing you should always be
[1:20:35] asking people who don't ask is because
[1:20:38] they don't want to
[1:20:39] learn they think they already know it
[1:20:41] all they think I I don't understand how
[1:20:45] you can think you know it
[1:20:47] all why we have to ask
[1:20:51] questions we have have to try to
[1:20:54] learn always growing always going to the
[1:20:58] next
[1:21:00] step a leader needs to be
[1:21:04] consistent the word consistent
[1:21:07] means acting or done in the same way
[1:21:10] over
[1:21:15] time
[1:21:16] especially so as to be fair or
[1:21:21] accurate I like that
[1:21:24] you got to be
[1:21:26] consistent we got to be consistent
[1:21:29] church we got to we got to just just do
[1:21:32] it when we feel it when we don't feel
[1:21:35] it season and out of
[1:21:38] season don't let your feelings guide
[1:21:41] you you know what your responsibility is
[1:21:45] you know your responsibility as a church
[1:21:48] member yes or yes you know what you're
[1:21:50] supposed to be doing
[1:21:56] you know your responsibility if you if
[1:21:58] if you have a charge in
[1:22:00] church if you have a gift if you have a
[1:22:02] calling you have to say I got to be
[1:22:06] consistent that's another reason kids
[1:22:08] don't trust their their parents they're
[1:22:11] never consistent they don't know when
[1:22:13] when they're just
[1:22:14] gonna
[1:22:17] off you got to be
[1:22:21] consistent
[1:22:25] uh Joshua 18 says we know this
[1:22:28] verse this book of the law shall not
[1:22:30] depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt
[1:22:32] meditate therein day and
[1:22:38] night that thou mayest observe to do
[1:22:40] according to all that is written
[1:22:44] therein for then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:22:47] prosperous prosperous and then Thou
[1:22:49] shalt have good
[1:22:51] success
[1:22:53] Psalms 1: says blessed is the man that
[1:22:56] walketh not in the counsil of the
[1:22:57] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:22:59] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:23:07] scornful but his the light is in the law
[1:23:09] of the
[1:23:11] Lord and in his law do he meditate day
[1:23:14] and
[1:23:15] night you got to be
[1:23:17] consistent day and night day and night
[1:23:21] that means every day
[1:23:23] that means every day every day you give
[1:23:25] yourself to the Lord every day you give
[1:23:27] yourself to your calling every day you
[1:23:29] do something get better every day you do
[1:23:32] what you're supposed to
[1:23:34] do come on church every day every
[1:23:37] paycheck every time every service you
[1:23:41] are there you are present you're
[1:23:43] available you do what you're supposed to
[1:23:47] do
[1:23:50] am that's when you prosper
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:23:54] every day you know what you're supposed
[1:23:56] to
[1:23:59] do 1 Corinthians 15:58
[1:24:03] says therefore my beloved Brethren be ye
[1:24:06] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[1:24:09] the work of the
[1:24:16] Lord constantes constant constantes
[1:24:21] constant
[1:24:23] that means
[1:24:24] always always always available always
[1:24:28] ready always always trying to do your
[1:24:36] best and I'll talk about the last
[1:24:41] thing which
[1:24:42] is if you're going to be a
[1:24:45] leader you got to know how to take the
[1:24:51] punches
[1:24:52] the more power you
[1:24:57] receive the more um in front you
[1:25:02] are you're going to become the
[1:25:05] target you're going to become a bigger
[1:25:07] Target every time you do more every time
[1:25:11] you take a position of leadership every
[1:25:13] time you want to do
[1:25:15] something you're going to encounter more
[1:25:18] problems that's why in in the corporate
[1:25:21] world
[1:25:23] they pay the people that are uh that are
[1:25:25] higher they pay the more because they're
[1:25:28] going to deal with more
[1:25:31] problems and you got to learn how to
[1:25:33] take
[1:25:35] it brother bam says in the message why
[1:25:37] Christ
[1:25:44] speak I believe that he called me for
[1:25:47] this
[1:25:48] purpose doesn't make me any more than
[1:25:51] the that man that got saved this
[1:25:56] morning just your
[1:25:58] servant your brother makes me less than
[1:26:02] you because I'm sent to serve you I am a
[1:26:06] servant to the public a public servant
[1:26:09] is a
[1:26:10] minister to serve the public to be the
[1:26:13] underdog to take this to take this
[1:26:17] KN
[1:26:19] of
[1:26:21] yes
[1:26:23] they're going to complain about you
[1:26:25] they're going to criticize you they're
[1:26:27] going to call you
[1:26:28] names they're going to try to knock you
[1:26:31] down he says whatever it
[1:26:34] is stand there and if you haven't got
[1:26:38] Grace enough to smile and take
[1:26:41] it then you have to go back to
[1:26:44] Calvary Rec confirm your
[1:26:47] commission that's what you're supposed
[1:26:49] to
[1:26:50] do come on Church when God has called
[1:26:52] you for something and you get up front
[1:26:56] you go up to the front
[1:26:58] line and you start to lead you're going
[1:27:01] to get attacked you're going to get
[1:27:03] criticized they're going to they're
[1:27:05] going to to to tell you all sorts of
[1:27:07] things you got to just stand fast and
[1:27:09] take
[1:27:12] it you're going to become a
[1:27:14] Target that's why people don't like
[1:27:16] taking
[1:27:18] responsibility they want to say oh you
[1:27:21] you take it you take it because they're
[1:27:25] afraid they're afraid Don't Be Afraid
