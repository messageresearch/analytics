the Lord Jesus Christ F my name isben f Valley we're in Moro Valley and we're there attending a tabernacle callede Tabernacle the immutable God there my wife one of my sons also a sister from our church and I truly felt very stimulated when God began to work in this place upon hearing the testimonies felt greatly stimulated how God moves so simply with the great power with great evidence always looking for a man to put his hands on remember on one occas it was a person that we knew and it was someone that I really didn't know but after I prayed for him that was at work and sweating but I looked at him [Music] and that man he said that he felt sick and he returned three days later and he laughed with me and he said I love you the pain left me he says th be the name of the Lord I returned 15 days later and he said I come from coming back with the doctor he said I no longer need chemotherapy I was struggling with eight years for cancer in his liver Oh Glory to God she offered me Med medicine and I told her that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he told his wife we don't need a doctor we don't need a pastor we need a mechanic someone to believe I believe that there can be a home that's broken a taxi driver or perhaps who cooks and some something that the prophet said that impacted me great on that day I present myself as a failure not as a coward I believe that there are many here have tried and they want to get to their attitud it was for the work of the Lord Jesus Christ he is above us all to him be the honor and the glory glory to God God bless [Music] you [Music] in a time when it was dry not a cloud up in the sky the children of God began to reason why so they went to God's man cuz they did not understand he said go look it's written in [Music] the now they open the door a seven time they look once more a tiny Cloud was rising from the sea and they began to understand the time for rain was at hand just like God said it would be and I see a cloud like a man's hand I see a clown like a man I see a clown like a man's hands and I know it's going to rain so today we have no fear we know a cloud did appear the prophet screams my bride go through the door have faith and just believe a new spirit you receive the rain is truly G [Music] A now the bride is looking above for a CH rain of love to fill their hearts with peace they never know soon this Bri shall be God unfolded mystery the promised one has been already [Music] so and I see a cloud like a man's hand I see a CL like a man's hand I see a cloud like a

you something I've received a revelation that I am not this body I am that manifested word of God for this age so I cannot end one more I cannot end I cannot die my body might die My Flesh might get out but the burning that lives inside of here not even the burning that lives inside of here the Jesus that lives inside of here that part of God the lust from God that spun out and came into this body shall never die praise the Lamb of God let's open up our scriptures while we're standing before I get too excited it's good to be a Christian I didn't always think so I didn't always think so but I do now it's good to be a Christian let's look in the book of [Music] Hebrews chapter three isn't this a beautiful Tabernacle let's give an Applause offering of praise to the Lord for providing this place it says like this wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Jesus Christ who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house I just want to put a insert a side note here how tremendous the Holy Spirit Led Paul to write see the reference here that he gives to Moses actually shortens this chapter by about three chapters because it immediately draws a picture in the mind of the he of the Hebrew children of all that Moses did and all that Moses said so he doesn't have to go back through that and talk about how Moses said that there'll be a Prophet come like me he immediately places him there as the faithful one in the house of God for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as he who hath builded the house hath more honor than the house but you you see what he's doing here places Moses their hero their lawgiver the great Messiah that took him out of Egypt that took him all the way to the promised land and turned it over to his servants Joshua and Caleb to take them into the land this great prophet that God did not speak to envisions did not speak to in dreams but he spoke to him face to face in his M the glory of God shown through him and said This Not only was faithful in the house of God he could be called the house of God but the builder of the house of God is greater than the house House of God in as much as he who hath builded the house hath more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is god let's pray Lord Jesus we ask your mercy and Grace upon us today surrender ourselves to your will that your holy spirit will speak through us and hear through us and may that word be quickened in our hearts tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen you may take your seats my brothers my as I said this is such a beautiful house as I went through the building I Saw the space downstairs and the space upstairs and to think of the glory of God to understand that God is in this you say what do you mean that that God is in this that I have to understand that God is in this when I was a young man I asked my dad a question about activating the promises of God now I can say with honestly I haven't followed the advice that was given in all aspects but I'll never forget what he said he said listen to this man he's a Jew and he knows how to activate the promises of God so I listened to the man and he's was a multi-millionaire approaching a billionaire in real estate and he said people ask me all the time The Secret of My Success and when I tell them what the secret is they basically say well if you don't want to tell me you could just say so you don't have to give me a silly answer but the answer that I give them is that I make God a partner in my business and then he goes on to explain now if they would ask me I would explain what I meant but people do not understand who invest in real estate is that you don't make your money when you sell you make your money when you buy if you buy a piece of real estate at fair market value you're not investing in real estate you're buying real estate now you have to wait years for the value of the property to go up before you can make any money so what I do is I find a property that I like I get it appraised I look around to see what other properties are selling in the neighborhood and I figure out what the good selling price is and I make my offer at 50 to 60% of the fair market value and I tell the lord lord business partner uh do you want to go and business with me on this piece of property if you do then they will accept the offer that I am giving and if you don't want to go and business with me on this property then they will not accept the offer now the key is not to fall in love with the property and when the answer comes back no you say well Lord I guess I'm going to do it on my own no you walk away from it because if the main partner doesn't want to be involved with it there's no use being invested in it so now when they accept my offer and it's amazing how many times they do I immediately divide the property and whatever percentage I offered the Lord 20 or 30 or 40% of the property I divide it I sell his part of it and I put the money in the church doesn't matter to me what they do with it that's not my business that's God's business what he wants to do with it and God has found that I am a faithful partner so I make more money than I can handle and when I sell my property and I make my profit I pay my tithes well you already gave the Lord his part No I gave him his part of the partnership [Music] but I still have to pay tithing on my part of the game so I remember listening to that I remember listening to so that's how I know that God is a partner in this work because the offer that was given and accepted should not have been accepted unless God himself moved upon the hearts of the sellers to cause them to accept it and God basically said I'm putting in my percentage of this business as a down payment and getting rid of that big balance [Music] and you guys just take care of the rest what a awesome thing I'm sure you will hear specifics of of of the promises and the things that God did but the tremendous thing to understand is that God is here this building might look beautiful this building might look too big this building might look whatever but for some reason God moved every piece of the history of this church because he had found a faithful partner a partner who had been faithful in the little things that could now be trusted with with some bigger things because this is just the beginning of the great things God has in store for this area it it it makes me excited I get so excited it's it's almost hard to preach but I but I'll tell you this like my dad told me one time and my uncle Tommy really anchored down one time he said people Miss missed the greatest Revelations of the message because they don't listen to the tape until he starts his preaching they think that his greetings and his little stories that he tells don't really have a point but what they don't understand is that God is delivering a great mystery but just in a soft digestible manner so that those that are spiritual may catch it but those that are not won't choke on it one time brother Tommy he gave a a greeting at one of our conventions oh God what a greeting talking about the predestination talking about before the foundation of the world talking about and I was like my God what kind of a greeting is that I was sitting there enjoying it but wondering and then he says maybe because I was wondering you ever have that happen to you you have a man with discernment preaching the word of God and you ask a question and he answers it and he says this is the greeting that Paul gave the church and if it was good enough for it ought to be good enough for us I said amen amen glory to God now here here here let's let's try to right before I go into this I want to thank thank brother Titus for this opportunity to speak thank you brother we we we go back a long ways and um Tito was just a young man when I met him yet very young but never immature he was already a mature Minister when I met him if you was what 21 maybe 18 years old me and brother Robert would talk about you a lot and we were just like man we can't wait to see what God is going to do through this man I mean he loved the Lord with all his heart he gave it his all he lived a clean life clean it was a joy to be around and brother we I just I I have loved seeing you throughout the years I mean who goes up and abandons who goes up and abandons your home your your father you could say that a Ministry already set up on the Council of a trusted minister very rare and then to come and then to come and to be steadfast and to and to lead the church and to do all that he can to further the gospel no wonder God would consider him a trusted partner and would provide him a a a place where he could further the Gospel of Jesus Christ I tell you you give some ministers a place like this it would go to their head before you know it they would have their own kingdom but that that won't happen here trusted partner God has his back God has the back of everyone who's living here who is pushing forward doing your little part in the kingdom of God amen amen I just love it so thank you brother Titus also see my buddy brother Tommy here God bless you this is this is the son of of my uncle Tommy I was talking about just in case you didn't know and Pastor Caleb God bless you it's always a pleasure to see you I saw me Jimmy Aly this morning he was at the breakfast and uh he said you all were here he said you were all here and I said okay well I have the hope that they're here and then I saw some at the park and they said I had the hope now I have the evidence there's something good about having the evidence right when the spies came back from Canaan they didn't come empty-handed they came with the evidence they said let me tell you something the grapes are sweet and if you don't believe me here's the evidence amen amen and I I want to thank my wife for coming with me I don't know where she's sitting but if you would please stand so you can see who she is thank you God bless you amen now my thought my thought is short tonight and um they almost always are but I was just thinking about this house and God providing it I was thinking about all the ministers and Ministries who have maybe worked hard all their life but um maybe they've never had a church that grew and uh I was remembering this scripture I was remembering this scripture in Psalms 12 127 except the Lord build a house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchmen waketh but in vain it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep for the and I begin to think you know that that's not just about a church or a house how many times have we spent sleepless nights our work never ends it seems like our work never ends at 12:00 at 1 o'clock at 2 o'clock we're still working trying to catch up trying to do the things we think need to be done we start getting up earlier and earlier trying to get a head start on the things we have to do we don't have time to take lunch we just grab a bread of Sorrow why it's vain no matter all the things that you're working is in vain and it comes to to my memory right now that they ask John Wesley John Wesley I think he used be saying he used to pay three hours in the morning and then go on his trips and then another three hours at night and God always helped him to get his things done and a man asked him one time what what do you do when you're too overwhelmed to pray three hours he said oh that's when I pray four hours what what a thing now the numbers might be wrong but the content of what he said the concept of what he said was is right when he had a tough day ahead he didn't skip on his prayer so he could get things done he prayed more because he understood he that labor labor in vain if God's not the one doing the work you can think about even even in this case the hours and the struggles investment to to purchase to buy a land to BU build something and the road blocks and the road blocks and the road blocks and the minute God does something the roadblocks disappear because the decision has already been set the destination has already been met my dad would tell me many times if the Lord tells you to go to Los Angeles go to Los Angeles it doesn't mean he wants you in Los Angeles along the road he probably going to say now turn left here and go to Bucky but if you're stuck I know the the lord gave this to me I know the Lord told me to do this yes but it may have been a directional push and you will know because you'll hear his voice again telling you turn to the right turn to the left now and my dad said he may not want to spend all the time telling you go down the Baseline turn right on Seventh Street get on the 17 then get on the 10 West go to Los Angeles he knows I know how to get to Los Angeles I'll tell you along the way what you got to do don't fear don't fear don't fear he's been with you till now surely he will take you to the end his voice is in your ear he's still alive he still talks to his people amen amen now so who who who made all things God the psalmist says in 8 in in Psalm 8 how excellent is thy name in all the Earth who has set thy Glory above the heavens out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest steal the enemy and the Avengers still means to stop now I don't know if you know this but that word still in the Hebrew language has a twofold meaning it means to shut up but it also means to remain motionless that's why in English is translated be still and in Spanish it translated to be quiet depending on how how the translator saw it but the text doesn't lie and it means the same thing mean shut up and sit down be still and don't move I knew one day I'd be able to quote my mama in a message how many of you m can say Amen to that be quiet sit down be still that's what he does to our enemies when I consider thy Heavens the work of thy fingers he didn't even have to use his arms or his hand or but the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which thou Hast ordained what is man that thou are mindful of him and the son of man that thou visites him okay now I'm GNA say something don't take it the wrong way and understand I'm going to make a distinction here between the son of man the office of the son of man and the son of man what what is the son of man what is the prophet he that the word of God comes to that house to which the word of God Has Come is the son of man so when you talk about God visiting all of you should include yourself and identify because Son of Man simply means God in flesh that's who that's who the word of God has come to the son of man for thou H has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with Glory and Honor let's go to Hebrews 11 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the of Promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is God now I'm I'm gonna pre-venture here I'm gonna pre-venture here it it may be that God has given you a house of worship that you did not have to build because he wants you to concentrate on the house that you must build that he can inhabit see this building is not the real Church of God the real Church of God is the people in the [Music] building and no matter what you try to do it's in vain unless you let God build it brother how you doing oh man I'm trying so hard to live this word stop stop trying to live this word if you're having trouble re living this word your effort should be in receiving the new birth receiving the Holy Ghost having your nature changed because that is what God will do then God will build your life whose Builder and maker is God for the law Hebrews 10 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect no matter what they tried under the law they can't make themselves perfect for then if they could have would they not have ceased to be offered because all because at the worshippers once Pur should have had no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifices there is Remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away the sins wherefore he when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifices and offering thou wouldest not but a body H has thou prepared me when he cometh when he [Music] cometh the one you just read I said when he cometh and what did you say when he cometh when he cometh sacrifice offering thou wouldest not a body hast thou prepared me the mystical body of Jesus Christ must be prepared for when he cometh where're the body where're the Tabernacle that he has come to inhabit then said I lo in the in the in the writing I come to do thy will Lord he take it the way the first that he may establish the second verse n not thy will not my will Lord thy will not what I want to build what you want to be not the way I think it should be but the way you think it should be let's stand Lord Jesus Cel we thank you for the opportunity to share your word maybe a little strange Lord but I feel this is how you led me to bring your word and to bring encouragement and to establish your banner Lord behold when the enemy comes in like a flood I shall raise up a banner we are those banners amen and you have a banner that you've placed here Lord a faithful partner father you've provided a beautiful place maybe so that we could concentrate on preparing our Temple for you for you say in your holy word Heaven is my throne and the Earth is is my foot stol where is the house that you build unto me and where is the place of my rest amen for all those things hath mine hand made and all those things have been sayith the Lord
