I'm not used to I want to give a short testimony I think that I think he likes when you testify will you brag about your father you know he I think I think he likes it you know I my kids brag about me and you know I get excited and I think God you know he's the same way when you brag about how great your father and your Heavenly Father has been you know he just he just wants to do more for you you know I was just I was working in in Denver for most of the year you know I was I was starting to get a very tired also waking up at 4:30 I wouldn't get home sometimes till 6:30 7:00 so I was just you know when I on my trips up there and on the tree on the way back [Music] I had a lot of time to think on the things of God because I think that you should set time aside you know to talk with God I don't believe you unnecessarily have to close your eyes to pray you can talk to him wherever you're at with your eyes open and while you're driving you know and just just just think about his how great he's been you know I think he visited at that time too you know when you're just thinking about him that's just when he comes down and on one of those trips you know I I was I was expressing how I felt how tired my body was beginning to feel and and and and I was like but you know what you know God I want to thank you for this job and whenever it's time you know how I'm feeling you know my body just wears down you see brothers he knows those things he knows how you feel but if you just let them know if we're just not not not not vague when we tell him things if we just if we're just a little more specific I should say so much my specific course you know with with the way you talk with them then I think that's that's when that's when he begins to answer because a lot of times which is not specific specifically you know you don't necessarily tell him what you really want a specific comment take a care most and and that's why sometimes you don't get what you want Sciences no tiene look yourself quiere because you're not specific with you so you know when you talk with them you just be specific specific and I think you'll answer I'll just let them know I just decided to be to be in the Fort Collins area you know just to be a bit more with my family not just with my family at home but with my church family as well because you know we're all family here you know in about two or three weeks ago they let me know that I was going to be transferred you know and I just want to thank God you know because he's a God that still answers prayer I just wanted to share that with you you know and I would ask if you just please stand we're gonna be opening our scriptures we're gonna be opening to the to the Book of Isaiah chapter 7 capital oh yeah we're gonna be starting on verse 1 vamos and Posada ever sick alone oh and for a title if I don't eat alone I'd like to title this a half-baked Christian when you have it say Amen it reads like this yes I see this chapter 7 verse 1 assess when I would have healed drill then the iniquity of a frame was discovered and the wickedness of Samaria for they commit falsehood and the tin and the troop of robbers and they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness now their own doings they are before my face and will move ahead to verse 6 and it says for they have made ready their heart like an oven while they lie in wait their baker sleepeth all the night in the morning it burn it as a flaming fire aplicar on su corazón some ohonta or no artificial enormous or narrow a la mañana Stinson Dida and Sandy DoCoMo llamada Fuego they are all as hot as an oven and have devoured their judges all their kings are fallen there is none among them that calleth unto me this is my domain scripture here I want to be focusing on this frame he has mixed himself among the people frame is a cake not turned strangers have devoured his strength and he no it did not yeah grey hairs are here and there upon him yet he knoweth not and the pride of Israel testifies to his face and they do not return to the Lord their God nor seek him for all this so very odd Israel terrific ara contra el and soukara in Norse La Valle Vieira na Havasu Jose nila who's Karen con todo esto let us bow our heads to pray Heavenly Father we come before you this evening Lord thankful Lord for all you've done we ask to look at the needs of the peoples do you speak this evening you knowing to live they will be speaking the you that you ninety years that will be hearing whether we be here at church or or through the internet may they not not leave here empty Lord but they may they take they take your word in their hearts we ask this on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated as we read in the scripture the Bible speaks about how Ephraim what was one of the nations or one of the tribes of Israel it was it was it was a tribe that was very a blessed by God they saw God firsthand they saw him at work in the you know when when they crossed the Red Sea he delivered them with the mighty hand mono/poly dosa and but we read in the scripture and verse 2 verse 3 how the Godhead was able to see how they had strayed away from him Mira como esta bien separado there after all the blessings after after all the things he done so lo que entra por ellos they just they just they just they just ignored it simplemente like no doubt on they just walked away they decided that they desired to now no longer have a relationship with him they said oh no they don't have relation con el they didn't they just didn't even want to pray anymore you know because we read in the last scripture that they did they no longer sought after him I mean almost unless you throw a kick and we really not in verse 8 how did you know that they got off they got all mixed up almost at my school they mixed up among among the nation you know and we know that God doesn't like mixing he doesn't lead isn't likely doesn't like frees people to mingle with the things of the world or the mix with them and that's something that's not very pleasing to him he wants a relationship with them you know we when we talk about relationship so I sat there and asked myself as I was reading you know we come to church and we sit there sometimes and we think you know when we come to church we think sometimes because we come to church just for getting more solid less here that we have a relationship with God and I was sitting there thinking when you have a relationship with someone you communicate with them and say kumanyika con ellos there's communication and communication and then I began to think about my prayer life happen sudden and maybe that you know and I think we should all consider our prayer line almost considered because if you have know if you're if you don't have a prayer life with you know an IV on that you don't have a relationship with God young con Dios because that's the way you communicate with God Eskimo sacrimoni cacao through prayer poor mayor de la nación that's the way you talk with him I see Eskimos a la Cornell so you look at your prayer life and that'll tell you what kind of relationship you have with God so let me not Katie Palacios Athena con Dios as I was reading I started II III just this brother that I was reading about and he was just he just he just hit me real hard just you know he was he was book the book was saying it was saying you know how many that's the question is how many have you taught your children how to pray those who says learning sinasu sea horse you know that just that just cut me up here so man so it just cut me because I honestly can say that I'm a pray but I've never taught my children how to pray they don't know how to pray and if they don't know how to break how do I expect for them to have a relationship with God I said okay yo song con Dios it's just it's just something that we have to think about many thought we have to get real real really thorough and em escape inside their store not just when I say thorough you know that means that means everything significant although because we see in the scripture limit emotion escritura or our key scripture and I'm gonna read it again it's it's it says like there's a frame he had turned he had mixed himself among the people for him is a cake not turn a phrase torta no volte odda so in other words you when you when you put a cake in the oven you know when they talk about cakes here when they talk about cakes in the in the old time they used to they used to make what you would call like a type of a pancake pancake you know you know it's it's just it's not turned the cake was not turned in other words it there was one side that was burnt and there was another site that was soggy a lot ROI and stuff a lot of stuff oh my lord no actual it was not complete completo and I I started thinking about that you stop and honest you know and that's why I titled it the way I did because a lot of times we cut the church just because we come to church well we think that we're complete it's almost almost completos but it's it's far from that much much lesser so it fits far from that it's much less scarce because the cake has to be turned over right not to be burnt see there's two sides to the cake it's not just one side but there's two sides so we have to pay attention we have to pay attention that we're just not focusing on one side we just can't focus just simply on the outside I don't know that fuera we can't come with your slip we dress the part of a Christian Amano's playmos we're still a part of Christian oil but we have to we have to turn over mascara you have to turn that cake over most a wealthy heiress at door and make sure the fire yeah make sure that that fire that's in their oven he can focus an essay or no begins to penetrate and step Annette Rondo we don't want something just one-sided okay I'm on solid watch on Omar's see God doesn't do things that way okay let's go so sassy he doesn't like things that are just one-sided just just a halfway do thing and we see here in the scripture the referee was just a cake like a cake that was not turned in other words they were double minded put it that way you know grab maybe one day they wanted to serve God and maybe the next day they did it the Bible says that they began to mix themselves up among the nation they began to think about the material things aside you see that's what light that's what happens in life sometimes we just we develop relationship you know whether it be a word outside of church relationship sometimes we have to understand we have to realize what these relationships are doing our spiritual life because I believe that that we that's the most important thing we should take care of every emotion cuidado it's not not our work life trabajo it's not it's not not our social life but but our relationship with God spiritual life la Vida speech that's the one that we need to take care of with that but that's the one it seems like we take care of the lease you see and today maybe perhaps thought they were on good terms with God tell me knows why not squander your drive every maybe dot that pencil I see you see maybe they thought you know we're getting blessed we have good jobs yeah we have money coming in we have all these friends and they began to do they begin to rely on on their their friendships you know maybe maybe they begin to you know rely on their work life perhaps then with the things of God because it happens I've been there you know where you just you just want to work at work and you don't realize what it's doing to your spiritual lives it's killing you little by little po popopo and that's the way they devil were killed he starts working in there little by little he says don't worry about it all right you pay your dime you go to the park on Sunday do those things that's alright you don't have to go to church all the time ok but let me tell you something that's how the devil begins to work on you he'll begin to work on the preacher just little by little you know they preach a good sermon you know it you know maybe somebody outside brothers if he can't get you in it in a sin outside para un cadeau fuera yo pill start working inside the church huddling les here she begins to be your friend yes from me or you might end up reaching a good sermon no you preach a good sermon Oh separate complaint settle more and then you head outside ha ha you know what maybe a brother will come by you know and then he'll let you know let you know you know what brother come here when I talk with you you know brother there's a lot of preachers in this church but you know what you're the best I'm sorry cosets element hoarder you see you start thinking a little bit you start you start getting puffed up who says I see this MPs are cleared you know anything you might go to the bathroom valve on you you know I heard brother pearly say one time I like what he said brother Bernie Williams you know some preachers they they preach a great sermon they get all puffed up the church gets all excited that's just a motion around that preacher goes to the bathroom he's like bet you did you know you start talking to yourself commensal are concerning your something new step in success I'll go you see and if you start beginning the one recognition you said be a circular Cassandra corner see you see that's how the devil works yes Eskimo commence a trabajar el Diablo begins to work that way throw harder someone you see any if you want recognition that's fine so secular and reconocimiento Stav en brothers I don't come here to get it to get recognized para ser conocido I didn't come here to foreclose the brain didn't come here to interpret a novena party interpret sorry I didn't come here for those things I didn't come for those things brothers for instance go son I came here to serve God said video whether it be on a I just want to do something for him thank you I said I'll do a party we get people that want recognition akira nakano see me and see those Pharisees they wanted recognition so funny so scary I'm like oh no see me you see if that's what you want says look who's kidding and that's what you get that's your pain right there I said Superga you won't get recognized in heaven if you get recognition here on earth you get it and you get it because that's what you want here podcasters okay yeah then you got your reward and sense yeah [Music] but whether I get recognized here on earth I don't see I mean it's fine to get a good job you know it's fine to get a good job or you're a great sermon when somebody tells you that's okay in but brothers you know we just we just have to watch those things we have to be careful than that cuidado god is good brothers joe says why not we cannot have appearance an appearance of holiness you just only just on the outside Santos not my sport where are you see a preacher could be a saint in public and he could be a devil in private and privado we just have to we just have to remember you know what I heard I heard a preacher say this one time he's like it's easy to go to church do those things you know but when you when you go to your house and you close that door behind you are you the same person in your house that you are outside of your house that oughta sting brothers because it hurts because sometimes that's the way we are you see you're cooked on one side not this not just cook sometimes you're burned on one side you see in your soggy on the other you're just you're just soggy mellow you know we talk about the scripture and you know it uses it uses fire a lot you know it uses it a lot in analogies it's fascinating how many expressions or our thoughts emotions bodies we they're they're used as analogy with fire okay so we talk about getting fired up about an idea being excited about burning with an idea yeah or you know we have a burning desire perhaps we have a burning passion John Chrysostom on dope or then throw or baby a bird up with anger or sestak a manic on Quora here you see it all has to do with fire Talton a cancer corn flavor you see the physical fire it has the potential to the whole people in favor physical channel a potential decay Meritor muchas cosas so I believe it the spiritual fire is the same way don't settle for spirituality la misma manera you see we have to watch those passions what are you passionate about okay now stir and nonsense you see we can talk about sexual passions are they passionate sex you know if you're just burning up yeah this is just a commando port and you know we know what I could lead to but you have to watch you see because what we want the fire inside to do we wanted to burn all sin we wanted to burn to burn that's within us you see what we want to fire inside of us we wanted to take us to to live a holy line I must confer knows yet very video Navi that Santa but I believe that we can't live a holy life without a prayer life I believe they go hand in hand we have to have a prayer life to have a holy life so we have to constantly be praying Santa meant autonomous cast-iron or ASEAN because if not for casino the fire and the fire inside could hurt us something else Martita an algo mas and you could be consumed with within but we want that fire the motivator no somos TV how many believe that brothers answer Manos we go back to the scripture about a frame a frame and we see here me Ramos how did God remain God we have a God that remembers how many how many you're happy to know that the sovereign saw that we have a God that remembers you see he remembers his promises he remembers his children but sometimes we forget we forget to mention sometimes that he remembers his curses as well recorded esas medicinas tambien he remembers those things and we have plenty of time to repent he's a God that forgives but he's a god that remembers he remembers those he remembers his curses as well as malice yonas a mallet excuse me brothers we see here in the scripture about God how he remembers the Prophet says in the seventh seal he says just as sure as he remembers every good promise I said a promise he remembers every evil one two he said that's the reason I believe friends I've always tried to stay with that word how strange it seems no matter how strange it seems brothers we have to stay with that word we have to make sure that we're they were paying attention the most poignant nothing that we're just not we're just not we're just being cooked on both sides you know and we see here in the scripture how he speaks how he speaks above that cake and I don't know if I'm gonna finish or not but we see in the scripture that you know to make a cake but I said so you you have to have you have to have a flower you know and I see in the scripture in the message Elijah in the mail offering and the Prophet says this it says now she got to me which represented Christ Christ is the word in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among Christ the meal offerings then she went and got the oil and the oil represents the spirit represented so she put the word in the spirit together and began to mix it up my swamis clothes see it was the word in the spirit that got mixed together LSPD took a mess cloth but what happened with every episo-- Conniff Raheen is that he he started he started mixing it with other things él comenzó my second otras cosas it wasn't it was no longer just a spirit John oh I don't know Marcel espírito you see he began to use to use maybe maybe human human strength you see just just like the human desire to want to do something oil - oh ma no they made a doll was that that's exactly what it is brothers yes you have to let God work you have to let him do the mixing Housatonic a lomez player you see when it is needed but no some masado media needed some asado so you have to let him get that oil in there so it can be completely saturated with that oil which is the spirit yes el espíritu see we know that yes our mo says so that's what the Prophet said lo que es el Profeta amen man brothers I know it's Wednesday minus x-one miércoles ro but I'm feeling a little hot man we see here brothers that a frame after he got mixed up after he got mixed up with with with these other nations that that didn't believe in their God then believing it frames God you see they begin to lose their strength little by little the scripture says that they begin to get gray hairs they started getting gray hairs on us but to get gray hairs brothers to be able to notice them you see you have to have a mirror who sat in a cast and I don't expect home that's the I mean I know I'm losing my hair some gray hairs right here on the side I wouldn't be able to see him I wouldn't be able to see him if I didn't have a mirror you see it I believe it's the same way in the spiritual life you see you can't you can't see your sins you see if you don't have the mirror of God in front of you you see that's the thing that's the most neglected yes that's the thing that we don't pay attention to we don't pay it we have a lot of unread Bibles you see it and they'll cry out against us one day [Music] they'll they'll cry out against us one day you see because that's really what's gonna let you know that's really good what I'm gonna let you know what were your standing on this what's wrong with you what did you have in your life you see he sends us he sent us instruments gauges you know to be able to analyze to be able to analyze our lives that's exactly what it is and I have I have a story I want to share with you and it's about a pilot you know I think it was very interesting you see this pilot said sometimes you see this pilot was in the Navy and you see they had depth watching their instrument in the end their gauges because they had to fly at night not share you see these pilots had to fly during the night time so Spilotro swallow under no chair you see any pilot can make some critical mistakes while he's flying at night a lot of where Sarah knows if he starts operating by his senses yeah he knows airport so Santino's you see that's where he begins to make a critical error is for now sooner or critical because the body begins to adjust purpose who star it says you know the body was just so much that a pilot could be flying upside down and feel that he's right side up al cuerpo Sahu stop mucho el Piloto La Valle and awoka-woka Riva Paris Ibaka bajo you see a Leicester pilot he as he begins to pour on the stick pelota hollando and menu that remote that he has he think he's flying up LPN circus towel and oh sorry because he's going by his senses a poor susanti dose you see but but but really he's keep flying down mentis Tasha I wonder if that's not how it is sometimes with us nosotros Ave you see we start going by we think we're on good terms with God when someone says ammos and terminals windows con Dios we could we can think all we want to because just because we think a certain way it doesn't mean that it's right no significant esta bien it doesn't mean that it's right if it's not according to the word it's not right a lot on north ivn we could be wrong brothers well I must have started mine I've got plenty of tickets I've got plenty of tickets where I thought I was right which was dinky that skip and sickest rvn but let escape and say I didn't think I was going very fast but I was pero si and that's just the way it is brothers you could think all you want to but we see this pilot I don't mean I mustn't step alot he begins to pour on the stick he thinks he's climbing in altitude altitude and he's flying straight into the ground yes londo that hecho el piso you see that's the same with the spiritual life like I said yes not miss well I mean a spirit well it's the same way as la misma we have to have a balance brothers and I must get an animal and say we have to have that balance in our lives an imbalance in Ezra's Vedas you know brothers they began if rain began at mano Safra income and so they begin to be strangers strangers to God estrellas con Dios you see the word stranger you see that the me is to be a foreigner Fiona said on the biblically the word refers to an alien or strange what one day has worship worship practices just one who is not a member of a family or no canines miembro de una familia it says or the state of being estranged from one's land or people that supported a suti era or the soup sometimes it's estrangement rssss is chosen SS Kohi de as when God's people I see commodious deliberately turn away from him and they make themselves strangers see there were there were no longer turning brothers there were no longer turning to God that's why that's why they were all soggy like that that's why once I was our Birds cocinando you see okay mother neither was there was just a lot of hypocrisy a lot of ungodliness outward performance is what it was but inside they were lukewarm you see and they were spoiled they were right in those like I said burnt on one side Monica come on lado damp or the other yeah mellow cilantro what do you do with the bird que pasa con una pastel que mató you see what do you do with the bird pancake I said corn on pancake and Milo you throw it away brothers it's spoiled hopper there it's only fit to go to the trash I was reading you see in in the in the in the New Living Translation vivianne you know and I like the way it said it there's just really no easy way to put it I know I you see the way it says it is is like this he says esta manera it is the people of Israel mingle with godless foreigners in Israel plucky comic embark on extra heroes making themselves as worthless as a half-baked cake you see we don't want to mingle with the things of the world we don't want we don't want that for our kids you see we don't want that for it but we don't want it for ourselves either we have to watch those things we don't want our kids to do something we want to protect them and that's great but make sure that you're not mingling with the with the things of the world either make sure you have a relationship you see the Prophet talks about a little bit I like what he talks about here in the message the approach to God it says and all of my parents know what a feeling that is and all of we parents know what a feeling that is it says when your children are cuando sus hijos you're very hard you're very hard begins to mingle with the world get out among the believers get out among the unbelievers North Korean III says he was talking about his son Billy I saw under the so he called Billy and he says I think he's out maybe talking to brother would put in our city we do not have we do not have a Christian school but honestly I don't mo so Mike there's a bunch of worldly children I muchos girls and boys to Nino singing yes tambien you see and he's thinking about sending Billy to school yeah let's uh pensando there are a billion escuela you see that when I thought of sitting my boy to that school this is knowing that everything that I drilled into him locate Lansing yeah and unless he becomes really converted Munoz casa he really comes to Christ all of his nature would be would be changed he swept out from under my hands as soon as he got with those worldly bunch because the very nature in him no matter being a good boy that is having a minister father a religious home where we don't approve of any things of the world in our home we try to live by the grace of God that almost every video like I said that you like Christians ought to live the influence said before him see I know if he if he was lost he certainly walk over a righteous home to be lost by I want I want him to have a job to walk over my life yo quiero que el come in and saw that my vida and he'd have to walk over

the birds were made without wings but we know that's not true but then God made wings and put them down before the wingless Birds and said to them Alessi ho it says come take up these burdens and bear them don't mine estas scaring us and bear them the birds have lovely plumage and sweet voices they could sing when encantar and their feathers gleamed in the sunshine a blue mass but they could not soar in the air they hesitated at first they hesitated when they were asked to take up these burdens that lay at their feet yes it says but soon they obeyed pero temprano of el ser on taking up the wings in their beaks tomando Susa las conchas Pecos they laid them on their shoulders to carry their own ancestors palace it's just for a little while to load seemed heavy and hard to bear but
