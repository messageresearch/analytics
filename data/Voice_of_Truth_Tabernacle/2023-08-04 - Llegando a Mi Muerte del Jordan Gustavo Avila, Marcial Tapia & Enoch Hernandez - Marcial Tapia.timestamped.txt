[21:38] show love patience
[21:43] determination determination
[21:45] even when they don't feel like it
[21:49] right there's just something about
[21:53] a son and daughter of God
[21:57] sometimes they just can't control things
[22:00] they just simply have to pour it out
[22:05] it's truly again a privilege to be
[22:08] amongst you okay
[22:09] I see loving faces
[22:13] I just have shown me love and mercy time
[22:16] and time again
[22:19] hey man if you can open up to Second
[22:21] Kings
[22:25] that's going to be where we bring our
[22:28] main subject tonight
[22:31] with our beloved Brothers
[22:37] [Music]
[22:39] and the reads like this
[22:41] and it came to pass when the Lord would
[22:43] take up Elijah into into Heaven by a
[22:46] whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha
[22:49] with from gilgales
[22:58] and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry here I
[23:01] pray thee for the Lord has sent me to
[23:03] Bethel and Elisha said unto him as the
[23:06] Lord liveth and as thou thy soul liveth
[23:09] I will not leave thee so they went down
[23:12] to
[23:13] bethelise
[23:22] can we say a Christian Life
[23:26] Christiana it's not a mediocre like
[23:29] it's not a normal life
[23:32] a lot from you
[23:36] but it also gives you a lot back
[23:39] our God is not a God that owes anybody
[23:43] and tonight we're going to see a life
[23:47] that is worthy to live up to okay
[23:53] to live up to amen
[23:56] I I
[23:58] let us go to the author of the word now
[24:01] beloved
[24:03] father padre and holy spirit yes all in
[24:07] one God
[24:09] we never deserve you
[24:11] but yet you chose to be part of our
[24:14] Lives
[24:16] I don't understand it
[24:19] maybe in my whole life we never will
[24:25] but it's not up to me to understand
[24:30] it's me to Simply believe
[24:33] simply believe what you did for me
[24:38] what you're still doing
[24:40] and what are you gonna do
[24:43] tonight take this vessel
[24:46] as well as the other two
[24:49] and take this church
[24:52] this people is that they don't come from
[24:56] because if they did
[24:59] then they're living disappointed
[25:01] I believe they came for for you
[25:05] because they I believe they prayed
[25:08] having a need
[25:14] to hear the answer of that needs
[25:18] we ask you to make yourself presents
[25:21] in your holy name I pray
[25:25] Jesus Christ
[25:27] amen you may be seated
[25:30] the title if we can put one tonight
[25:35] is getting to my Jordan death yes
[25:49] okay can you say it with me
[25:52] getting two
[25:54] by Jordan yeah I mean I believe that we
[25:58] all have to get to that Jordan there
[26:01] in order to God to fully take control of
[26:04] us
[26:06] reading and studying the chapter two of
[26:09] Second Kings
[26:13] we know the the story that's going on
[26:16] where Elijah is
[26:18] about to leave
[26:24] and tonight my goalie
[26:27] it's just to show you the everything
[26:30] that Elisha went through is
[26:35] his encounter there's this one quintro
[26:38] where his life completely changed fully
[26:40] around
[26:43] I'm going to share a couple key notes
[26:48] where Elijah knew that Elijah donde
[26:51] Elias
[26:53] had something different to offer then
[26:57] and Elijah knew he had a purpose
[27:02] to fulfill
[27:04] but he didn't know what exactly that was
[27:10] something we know that we've all we're
[27:13] all told we have a purpose
[27:16] young people young ladies young men
[27:19] we're told that every single day
[27:22] many times we have the question
[27:45] you know his purpose through everything
[27:48] but it had to be him also wanting to
[27:52] mean letting God show him
[27:58] Elijah wasn't scared to face the unknown
[28:01] Elizabeth
[28:06] because he was about to enter into a
[28:07] chapter of life where his
[28:09] mentoring
[28:13] we can say a father figure
[28:16] um
[28:28] not knowing what to do maybe
[28:31] we're all going to get there
[28:36] one day we're going to be our mom and
[28:38] dad
[28:42] not knowing what to do
[28:47] tonight with this is
[28:49] hopefully you can find out
[28:52] what we need is when that time comes
[28:59] Elijah goes into the unknown confidence
[29:11] [Music]
[30:05] foreign foreign
[30:28] [Music]
[30:32] it's truly me
[30:35] Is
[30:37] We I have an appointment right here
[30:39] right now with God
[30:41] I don't know what's going to happen
[30:43] but I ain't gonna leave the saying
[30:46] I'm Gonna Leave determined
[30:49] with something new and something
[30:52] different in my life
[30:54] amen all right amen all right wake you
[30:57] up a little bit but he says in the
[30:59] message the second hand rope
[31:03] he says but notice here they come out
[31:07] and Elijah when he came by yeah
[31:10] his time just about fulfilled for him
[31:16] to come by where he was at he said
[31:23] now you stay here I'm going I'm going to
[31:26] go up to gilgal up here
[31:29] now brother bam says this
[31:32] you see he tried to discourage him
[31:36] many times in our lives we're going to
[31:38] have loved ones that maybe
[31:40] not
[31:42] intentionally no intentional but they
[31:45] try they discourage us sometimes
[31:48] you know it's going to happen
[31:52] and many times when there's a blessing
[31:55] laying right ahead says
[31:58] the devil tries everything he can to
[32:00] discourage us
[32:06] we go through trials and tests
[32:11] and brother Brandon gives us a key right
[32:13] here
[32:16] being spiritually minded
[32:20] spiritual he knew that he had a purpose
[32:24] and he wasn't going to leave him
[32:27] he said as the Lord liveth in your soul
[32:30] living
[32:32] I'm not going to leave
[32:35] he said brother Brown says I like that
[32:36] this is one of these Americans I like
[32:39] that determination
[32:41] and while reading this
[32:44] God gave me this angle
[32:47] God will let you settle yours
[32:52] I'm going to say God will let you
[32:54] settled
[32:57] you hear that there's a gentleman
[33:00] [Music]
[33:02] he's not going to force you
[33:04] he's gonna Force he's gonna let you be
[33:09] go your past
[33:12] whatever you want
[33:15] but I love how brother Brandon brings it
[33:17] in this angle
[33:22] brother Brandon preaches this message a
[33:25] second rope twice
[33:28] and he preaches this one and I believe
[33:31] in uh Phoenix
[33:32] and then one in Jeffersonville
[33:53] you stay
[33:57] be here and settle down
[34:00] and be a good teacher of Theology and so
[34:03] forth he said
[34:05] how tremendous is
[34:07] God gives us the opportunity
[34:10] we all have the opportunity
[34:12] to continue your life with them or
[34:15] without him
[34:18] it's our own choice
[34:20] like I said one day we're going to be
[34:22] out with Mommy and Daddy
[34:24] and we're gonna have to make a choice
[34:29] [Music]
[34:42] but knowing that God is truly by itself
[34:55] foreign
[35:46] [Music]
[35:55] eyes to flow through us
[35:58] for someone else
[36:00] that's what he likes
[36:03] want it for you like shock
[36:05] he wanted that life foreign
[36:26] is that what living is
[36:29] because again many people have
[36:32] professional lives
[36:35] professional you know there's nothing
[36:37] wrong with that you know they have great
[36:39] careers they're well known if you can
[36:42] say
[36:43] but being in the barbershop that you get
[36:47] to talk to people
[36:49] and I ask them what do you do for a
[36:51] living this is
[36:58] oh wow that's a great life that's a
[37:01] great career
[37:07] oh I'm gonna go home
[37:10] sit on my couch
[37:14] and turn on my TV television all day
[37:17] yeah all day I've worked hard
[37:20] I feel like I've done enough
[37:23] I don't want that type of life
[37:26] foreign
[38:52] not perfect
[39:52] again it was not only one
[40:09] [Music]
[40:22] many times the devil asks us that
[40:31] a Revival service
[40:41] what are you gonna do
[40:48] Elijah didn't know everything exactly
[40:50] how it was gonna go Elise
[40:54] but inside of him I believe there's
[40:58] something about the genes of children of
[41:01] God
[41:04] you can't explain it
[41:06] but there's just a piece there's just a
[41:10] piece that tells you
[41:11] it's okay
[41:13] it's all right relax
[41:17] because I believe foreign
[42:22] that's all he wants for you man
[42:26] time zones
[42:28] if I can
[42:30] to leave you with this
[42:33] I'm gonna maybe switch a little bit
[42:36] I heard this is from a preaching of uh
[42:40] of this Minister the ministry it's
[42:43] called Divine confidence
[42:46] and many times I feel like we some need
[42:49] of that yeah
[42:51] to be able to be confident where we're
[42:54] standing
[42:56] even though they may point fingers and
[42:58] say his life
[43:02] maybe he's not living up to the life of
[43:05] the word there's no no no no no no no
[43:08] but I'm going to read you this real
[43:10] quick
[43:15] the devil what he wants to do
[43:18] is get you in a place where you're
[43:20] struggling
[43:22] and he could convince you yeah that
[43:26] you're in a place that you're not okay
[43:30] do you get that yeah
[43:34] because that's the that's the whole job
[43:36] of the devil
[43:37] to try to stir you up
[43:39] and maybe implant some doubts
[43:42] [Music]
[43:43] make you questions
[43:59] all he cares about is
[44:01] that you believe that the word of God is
[44:05] applicable yesterday
[44:09] if the word of God is applicable manana
[44:14] but it's never applicable today
[44:17] because once he knows
[44:23] that you can believe that the word of
[44:25] God is
[44:27] applicable to you today
[44:32] then he knows he has no power
[44:35] he has no power
[44:37] because then what you say
[44:41] like Elijah said
[44:44] let the god of Elijah show himself
[44:50] I I say this let the god of William
[44:54] Branham show himself
[45:03] tonight
[45:06] because I know what can you say and I
[45:09] believe that the word of God is the same
[45:13] yesterday today
[45:16] is applicable to me to my life
[45:25] [Applause]
[45:31] Hermanos
[45:35] is Bueno
[45:37] Gloria Dios
[45:40] is
[45:41] a pleasure are you glad to be here
[45:46] how many youth came this way can you
[45:49] lift your hands
[45:50] because my message is foreign
[45:54] [Music]
[46:11] amen amen
[46:15] and as a subtitled
[46:18] I'd like to place
[46:21] he kept his eyes
[46:24] it's important brother
[46:29] it's important that you don't lose your
[46:32] focus
[46:33] so have your eyes
[46:38] to the pastor all the time
[46:41] because we know God is with our pastors
[46:47] we must face
[46:49] the circumstances
[47:06] by ourselves
[47:08] because we will find ourselves
[47:12] at some point in our lives
[48:07] we must cry out
[48:10] sir
[48:12] watch brother Holiness youth
[48:59] Amen brother
[49:01] now
[49:24] [Music]
[50:01] the Wonders foreign
[50:07] [Music]
[51:02] foreign
[51:52] Corazon
[52:40] [Music]
[52:49] now
[53:18] what did he do
[53:24] Alias he's told Elijah Elijah give me
[53:29] one second
[53:31] I just want to dismiss myself from my
[53:34] family
[53:34] and what else did he do what did he do
[53:38] matoros
[54:24] how many times we think okay
[54:37] our dreams
[54:39] mucho we worry a lot
[54:43] even us as ministers
[54:48] when we see there's a need somewhere
[54:51] we always think about the money
[54:56] and how many days do I need to stop
[54:58] working it's two thousand dollars
[55:01] but I'm not gonna earn them
[55:06] brethren
[55:28] [Music]
[55:38] you aren't the only ones
[55:41] how many are suffering
[55:51] struggling one way
[55:52] foreign
[56:45] that's what God sent us foreign okay
[57:29] Gloria dios Lord of God
[57:34] so Elisha got rid of everything
[57:41] if he did it
[57:43] that we can do it also
[57:46] if he started everything he was going to
[57:48] let go of iMac
[57:51] and nevertheless
[57:55] then we can do it also
[57:57] foreign
[58:03] [Music]
[59:12] all of that
[59:35] happiest person
[59:39] the happiest questions
[1:00:25] oh brother
[1:00:45] with us
[1:00:48] Glory
[1:00:51] hallelujah hallelujah brother
[1:01:02] he kept his eyes on Elijah
[1:01:06] and
[1:01:07] now where do we keep
[1:01:11] we grab our iPhone
[1:01:14] or any cell phone
[1:01:29] I spent two and a half hours
[1:01:32] Jesus Christ
[1:01:56] I'm closing now
[1:01:58] is
[1:02:07] a second hand rope preached 1956.
[1:02:14] and El
[1:02:16] tayer
[1:02:18] you know God usually puts us in the shop
[1:02:20] and trims us up
[1:02:27] he didn't alter his ropes
[1:02:37] and that's what he does today
[1:02:40] he Alters
[1:02:50] foreign
[1:03:50] foreign
[1:05:32] don't be confused
[1:05:38] let's not be confused
[1:05:42] that's why we don't see God
[1:05:44] because we see ourselves what we do is
[1:05:49] and that's in our nature whenever I want
[1:05:53] someone says
[1:05:57] I can't find anything to do for people
[1:05:59] to see me hermoso
[1:06:02] hermosoes it's beautiful
[1:06:05] when we do it for love
[1:06:08] with all of our hearts and we can see
[1:06:11] God in Simplicity
[1:06:16] may God use you greatly and yes you can
[1:06:20] do it
[1:06:22] and we can do it
[1:06:25] we can't get rid of anything from Indigo
[1:06:29] God bless you
[1:06:30] [Applause]
[1:06:36] God bless you
[1:06:40] understand
[1:06:42] to read Second Kings 2 12.
[1:06:54] I don't have so much fire like these two
[1:06:57] young men
[1:07:00] what I'd like to be a little more calm
[1:07:03] this is the Manera it says the following
[1:07:06] way
[1:07:11] levio
[1:07:18] and Elijah saw it and he cried my father
[1:07:21] my father The Chariot of Israel and the
[1:07:23] horsemen thereof and he saw him no more
[1:07:26] and he took hold of his own clothes
[1:07:27] clothes and rent them in two pieces
[1:07:36] he took Apostle the manso of Elijah that
[1:07:38] fell from him and went back and stood by
[1:07:41] the bank of Jordan
[1:07:49] yes
[1:07:55] and he took the mantle of Elijah that
[1:07:58] fell from him and smote the waters and
[1:08:00] said where is the Lord God of Elijah and
[1:08:03] when he also had Smith in the waters
[1:08:06] they parted hither and dither and Elijah
[1:08:08] Elisha went over
[1:08:21] says we should identify ourselves with
[1:08:23] every character from The Bible
[1:08:26] and I'd like to identify with Elisha
[1:08:47] God calls man like God called Adam in
[1:08:50] the Garden of Eden restaurant
[1:08:54] but our nature is to hide
[1:09:00] right because our sin is always upon our
[1:09:03] face
[1:09:04] is
[1:09:11] I go way back in my life
[1:09:15] when I was 20 years old
[1:09:20] I remember my father called me and said
[1:09:23] come son me who is the um
[1:09:30] the Holy Spirit has sent me to Mexico
[1:09:32] City
[1:09:34] would you like to accompany me
[1:09:41] and I was just wondering well the Holy
[1:09:43] Ghost sent you
[1:09:46] at the same time
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:52] if the holy spirit is sending him that
[1:09:54] same holy spirit is sending you
[1:09:57] [Music]
[1:09:58] I left whatever I was doing
[1:10:01] [Music]
[1:10:01] um
[1:10:03] and I started to help my father in the
[1:10:05] ministry dosanos for two years
[1:10:12] then my father accompanied me to Phoenix
[1:10:18] and he leaves me under the care of
[1:10:20] brother Bernie Garcia
[1:10:24] for the Bernie G Garcia tells me
[1:10:26] something
[1:10:28] and he says Enoch
[1:10:31] Elementary
[1:10:33] I'm going to give you the same training
[1:10:35] as brother Enrique Anaya
[1:10:39] wow for me that was a very tremendous
[1:10:44] I say it as a joke but it's very true
[1:10:47] one of the very first things I did
[1:10:50] was wash dishes
[1:10:54] to sweep the house
[1:10:57] attend the elders
[1:11:01] he would make us help people
[1:11:06] repair homes
[1:11:08] and other things
[1:11:12] it wasn't as I thought it would be
[1:11:22] one time I heard her brother Garcia
[1:11:24] train brother Anaya
[1:11:29] he said I never fed Anaya food to his
[1:11:33] mouth
[1:11:35] he said I took him and he killed yes
[1:11:40] that's how it should be with every one
[1:11:42] of you use
[1:11:49] for one day for you to become a leader
[1:11:53] you must be under Authority
[1:11:57] you need to learn to obey us
[1:12:01] to learn to make mistakes
[1:12:04] you need to learn
[1:12:08] so put yourself aside
[1:12:12] I remember
[1:12:15] Garcia even brother Garcia sometimes
[1:12:20] he would send me to gather use
[1:12:23] that were in drug homes
[1:12:27] it didn't fit in my mind what am I doing
[1:12:31] here
[1:12:34] pick up a person and
[1:12:36] I would be afraid going to places like
[1:12:39] that
[1:12:42] but I was willing to do whatever he
[1:12:44] ordered me to
[1:12:46] Garcia one day brother Garcia told me
[1:12:51] Enoch I don't want robots
[1:12:54] I want people
[1:12:58] by the same Holy Spirit
[1:13:04] to tell you
[1:13:07] I want him to tell you what you should
[1:13:10] do
[1:13:15] came to my life
[1:13:33] but when my father passed on
[1:13:40] I lost my objective my goal
[1:13:44] that's why it's importante it's
[1:13:48] important
[1:13:50] that we do what Elisha did Elise
[1:13:54] Elisha never saw the man
[1:14:01] I'm watching The Man
[1:14:31] I began to remember
[1:14:34] foreign
[1:15:13] have I not given five years of my life
[1:15:15] to his ministry
[1:15:17] why does he treat me that way
[1:15:21] Christian walk is not easy and many
[1:15:25] times
[1:15:42] man
[1:15:44] Mexico esparame he said wait
[1:15:48] I will send to call you
[1:15:51] everyone knows my story
[1:15:54] seven years past
[1:15:56] he never called me
[1:15:59] but I was in that worldliness
[1:16:03] and I began to see
[1:16:07] who truly said those words
[1:16:14] the Holy Ghost through my pastor I also
[1:16:18] understood
[1:16:22] that God was calling me back to the
[1:16:25] Christian walk
[1:16:27] that's why here Elijah
[1:16:30] is in a situation
[1:16:33] his Pastor is
[1:16:36] being taken away from the scene
[1:16:40] his robe falls on the ground and there
[1:16:44] is foreign
[1:17:59] or nothing
[1:18:01] wow
[1:18:03] thank you God glory
[1:18:05] Holderman Garcia brother Garcia once
[1:18:08] said
[1:18:14] we went to Nacogdoches is
[1:18:21] and he said Can two youth accompany me
[1:18:24] yeah
