switch to English how many happy to be here tonight amen amen it's nice to see everyone again hey man um I'm just gonna pray real quick before we started and Lord I give you thanks for this wonderful day you've given us gracias foreign to come here and gather in your in your house Lord and to give you all the honor and Glory La Gloria yes that you may help me and my brothers that will be speaking after me and then you just may give us the strength to speak Lord and to give the right words correct us um we asked to sign your name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen ah um just want to give thanks to God first um for giving us a chance to go to Mexico who's going to give kind of a little testimony in a little background and our other brothers will be kind of bringing the word but um you know on the way over there you know it's a beautiful way over there I guess I'm spending time with the brothers a little tiring as well I believe all missionary trips are pretty tired it was pretty exciting to see josuego over there his first missionary trip on Fridays me and him preach together he gave a little testimony and a little preaching testimony and we talked about seeing the invisible yeah and as a subtitle making a choice and [Music] um the whole theme of the of this trip is receiving the reward foreign so we're just talking about um you know receiving a rewards and making a choice and to serving God or serving this world would you serving the devil right okay and um you know it was amazing service I'm seeing all the brothers again um brother Edgar and his family picked us up from the airport you know the brothers were very happy to see us again and on Saturday yes my brother Marshall and my dad preach and I think they preached receiving the reward or something but that was another great preacher and great service and it's just amazing to see how much new people are are joining yes you see um the first time we went La primeroes it's um you know it's kind of just the main ones that were already there I believe and it was about probably I want to say 30 people the first time we went about the max that we had in the service but this this last time that we went I want to say there was about 60 people there and you know it's growing yes and it's just amazing to see how the word could spread so fast and you know we're talking me and my dad and I believe it was brother Marshall and it really touched me what he was saying because he was saying you know if he said you know we could go on these missionary trips and things so he's like if we don't have nothing to give what's the point he's like see first you have to work on yourself then we could go over there and give over there is that touched me a lot because you know sometimes we're asleep here we're not working on ourselves here we expect to go somewhere else and to give something over there and be shouting and jumping yeah but here we're doing nothing I say it for myself um and um Sunday came around and uh my brother Titus preached another amazing preaching Grande um I had my first um you could say a missionary birthday the brothers you know their love Los Hermanos it feels like family you know they got me a cake and everything pastel first time seeing a candle like a fireworks you know it was it was amazing to see their love uh sister knowing me giving me some she makes some bombones and has a happy birthday on it Jose Luis giving me a tie you feel so small you feel their great love for you you see and you know they're you know they were excited but also um there's a lot of Brokenness there but and you see um brothers were telling me and some this is also something that impacts me a lot and um you know things that they're going through um you know family-wise their spouse and you know it's something crazy to think about yes like I'm not married I don't have kids and it's like these brothers coming to tell you yes the problems but all I could do is motivate them that's all we need sometimes is a little motivation they just need to see that you could bring them up I show that you really care for them you're just looking for someone again you see my brother uh our pastor was speaking over there with us a little compartia I believe it was me and my dad and Marshall again you see we were we were like talking about Brokenness and you see uh he was saying you know there's a lot of people broken here he's like I feel the reason why I could help him because we've been broken as well amen you see a broken person could help Another Broken person to try to help them when the devil brings them down that they could get back up and keep going because we have a reward waiting for us you know my brother Pai sang a song over there about receiving a crown up there in heaven but we have to fight foreign comes with suffering and fighting you can't just get something easy because they'll go easy as well amen so we have to fight for that rewards we have to really want it you see on Sunday yeah Domingo our brother um city and our brother um Carlos Carlos City we had to leave then that night or we didn't leave that now we probably left like around three or four because our flight was going to take off at six so we didn't want to live in on Monday morning like we're gonna have to leave at like two in the morning we had a good time with them as well um you know it was very tiring because we only we got to the hotel about 11. now we didn't go to sleep till like one because Marshall kept laughing and he got jealous but no it was and we had to wake up again at uh I think it was 3 40 or because the people told us that we had to be two hours before to get a shuttle yeah so my dad's out the door already because he doesn't want to miss the Shadows are still sleeping so we wake up because he's asked like where's your dad like bro he took off already and so we get ready and we leave and we just waited like come in and the shuttle was already there yes I know I could have slept more like a whole hour more yeah so we get to the airport we're waiting there um we're kind of hungry so we're just waiting there next year you know we're gonna leave at six and they call and say our flight's delayed an hour and 20 minutes so Marshall's frustrated now at this point because he could have slept in his bed still okay but you know it was a good time spending time with Marshall no he's a great guy I look up to him a lot um but no and so then we um we stopped in Tijuana Tijuana and um we um ate some a burrito there um and then we got a cab or like uh a taxi taxi and you know something that really I what I like about Marshalls Marshall could could make a conversation like that yeah okay and this taxi guy he was Hispanic yes and so um you know Marshall started talking to him about the words and uh they started talking about you know Adam and Eve and they started asking them who sinned and I don't know what else is something that I really like what this guy said persona he said see we don't we never want to take the blame for ourselves he said we always either want to blame the devil yeah we want to blame our neighbor alvesino we want to blame God sometimes but we never take the blame of our that what we did we never take you know accounts because well this guy he was a preacher before he knows the word he was taking out scriptures and saying I'm like nothing I was like whoa sombrado because he was he was cussing and saying all this stuff you know when you judge someone too quick and they were kept talking he was saying these things and you see then he started talking about and I and you know we came to a conclusion that you know people are hurt in this world Amen you know he started saying you know because my brother Marshall asked him do you still go to church you know he's like no I used to I used to teach in the churches yeah a contest I should be a great leader but then you know I started seeing people and I started you know seeing bad things happening in the churches you know now I drink my beer you know and I don't care about my testimony testimonial yeah you know and it's sad to see that yes because like how could someone not care about their you see and you know he was saying you know I I drink now yes and I still could help people and it's something that I reflected on yes because you know you don't sometimes you don't really think as a youth is about your testimony amen you don't care what you do you say I could come to God later but you see I just want to motivate you guys you know to make a choice today you know make it as soon as possible because time's running now and you see I want to choose God and I want to have a good testimony I hope you guys want the same God bless you [Applause] yeah bless you Brothers it's a pleasure to be back once again if you see me a little bit more films because I ate a lot of tacos time and time again Primera and I I was able to go the first time I could see how God was working I was a bit doubtful I think we can never put a period we should always put a comment because God continues [Music] my wife went the third time she took my place she was a missionary [Music] sisters were very happy what my wife shares and that's what it's all about brothers I didn't say that it's the last one not the last one that's gonna happen happen but pero Ultima but the last one the final one and I was able to say what God was doing you understand me right now I was able to see how God was working I want to share with you I'm very happy that the contract you can say that the pastors to make that possible foreign foreign [Music] corruption but he that sowed to the spirit shall the spirit reap life Everlasting foreign verse 10 says like this as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith is to serve one of us um when you don't see anything foreign foreign uh Los pies de dios meant to be the feet of God to be the hands of God used to be the eyes of God the mouth of God is very easy to get the skirts everything is possible everything is possible God everything is possible it's worth it every minute of our time [Music] a very simple message and I've seen him preach very tremendously foreign [Applause] no I don't tell you this tomorrow and then and we decide to do it Hermanos Jesus said these things would happen and we're looking at them today oh brother one of these days these things are going to change it's here I see Eve go over and Shake It Ultimo on down on down to the last one when Jesus comes again and the Earth will break forward this is true that God is moving but he needs for me not to deceive myself but this this this makes me be more cautious decision is then Brothers I encourage you that it's worth it to serve our God and to serve our God is to serve our brothers is a decision [Music] God bless you [Applause] yeah if you can open your scripture with me and stand for a moment First Corinthians from verse 4 to verse 7. we send greetings to our brothers Mexico with his family amen does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil birth all things believeth all things hope is all things endureth all things you may be Siri in this missionary trip yeah I believe when you're in the work of God you're working for God you always expect for greater things from God I've always believed while you work for God you do it with the right reasons I believe God will always what you have uh which is many times we don't receive what we want because we don't have the right reason amen amen so on this trip for me it was something very special I could see the brothers and see how God is working over there I like to get into the history of what a place is so speaking with the brother in the previous time we went uh I wanted to know a little of the history of Uruapan um like this and also the history on the congregation there it was uh and they tell wonderful things they talk about the the good times got around 100 or 200 people congregated but I mean with us is for me that's a very big group and we see where they are now uh and this time we went uh um I could see the fruits of what is is happening there the uh and for me it's something special to see that see how the brothers say that how they good they treat us is still making more room for God to give me more it's okay girl that's what I believe okay so I go and I believe we should go with that mentality you might say well I don't go anywhere well then give it all here if you can't go out there if all you can here because we also need some here um an image from this trip um this image stands out the most of this last entire trip we made was when a child named Josue is um and I believe the brother's name is Daniel kamarena one of his sons they wanted to sing a special yeah and the boy is three years old yeah if you would have seen his face how he rejoice when he sang to God um because I saw him and I saw an image of the church where they are a church that has been restored that is so this young fellow can have hope without forgetting that there were some support that are still there and I believe they still love God and their Elders already and as you're growing old uh I can imagine but you don't see that you can they might not see the fruits um like let's see a person and and to um because I believe God has greater things for them I hope they can see it is because when you love someone you can bear Brothers you understand what it means to bear or endure uh you might feel you can't stand it anymore but when you love them you understand me but even then you still keep loving that person and you're with them there believe the brothers have taught me what it is to love God what it means to love God when the time is cold when there is loneliness a time of tribulation in time of rejection and type of mockery an independent examples and different types of times various conditions what it truly means to love God because they are still there devil has wanted to do what he wants but he's not able to support because love prevails love continues it should be for every one of us that's why many times people Retreat now speaking on the the taxi driver God bless him oh you know quiero I don't want albondia one day [Music] just like he said like he didn't go to church because of too many people or too many Hypocrites that's why he didn't go and to church I don't want that to be my story to say maybe there was Hypocrites but no Hypocrites will separate me from God no rejections from the love of God amen amen that's why I'm still standing here I want to read a quote from the prophet I would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gifts and just be so in love with each other and with Christ I'd rather have that than any than every spiritual gift operating in church skip down a few sins it is where there is gifts they'll bring confusion where there oh forgive me where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it's perfect it is perfect that's what's correct that's correct that's right and if you had perfect love usted you'd have perfect gifts yes that's what's correct that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts I've been able to see how God has been working and the small groups amen amen if God has given our pastor great vision [Music] I believe the work he is doing nothing can stop us when the service ended foreign and my wife Christian this is a um I've got so many uh Services I've got some Mass a lot this is but I've never been to a service like this one this is this service was good and I can see that it's God it's God working you have love not for yourself [Music] God will never there's Perfection there's the best [Music] God bless you [Music] um [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] he grows [Music] [Music] more [Music] lights yes [Music] go go by que security [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
