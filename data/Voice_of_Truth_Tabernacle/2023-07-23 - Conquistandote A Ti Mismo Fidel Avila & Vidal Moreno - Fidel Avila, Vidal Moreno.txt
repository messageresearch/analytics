thank you foreign [Music] [Music] thank you Lord [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] may God bless you places in US let's read it says like this take heed unto thyself continue in them for in doing this is bless your word thank you Lord for your word okay because you're good myself we'll be able to express ourselves easily with our words along with our interpreters in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ with the topic conquering yourself forgive me Lord of God I was a little nervous it's not the first time I preach pero no says I know this fish is a little weird conquering yourself and our subtitles is Let It Go and I'm going to be focusing on uh and Ben said in conquering yourself Let It Go you know something uh as the years have gone by uh by the grace of God I was barely seeing the picture or the date that I was I was baptized I was baptized this time that's passed my eyes of Christianity they want to conquer their neighbor of the world we want to be conquered I want to be conquers of the whole world [Applause] because we're humans we're now Angels we're humans Sons and Daughters of God in flesh amen amen sometimes they can't conquer themselves it doesn't matter who it is that's what we don't understand we're going to struggle is the scripture says that a Paul told Timothy to take care of yourself I've been uh recently meditating on myself because this morning there's no one more important than yourself that's right because we want to save everyone but if you're not even saved yourself to whoever why don't we apply it to ourselves what is it what what does it cost it's costing us something Uno Holy Spirit and you don't have anything forgive me but it's the truth is condition when you have nothing man ual spirit that you have Diablo it's of the same Kingdom against the devil he doesn't fight himself right Brothers it has to be a change because there are times that we want to we want to hunt each other I'm gonna bring it down a little bit we want to hunt each other get married get married to each other oh my wife is going to make me happy it doesn't happen here right my wife is going to make me happy [Music] Pastor has told us many times no one will make you happy it's part we love our wife love your husband love your children foreign oh Elias Elijah in the case [Music] bring it to manifestation the same um and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your Holy Spirit listen to the coming of the Lord I want to I want you to see this that we're founded on three three parts we're based of three parts he first foreign hablando so we're trying to get to know each other look for a partner that's filled with the Holy Spirit but will be able to help his children so these three has to be in unity there is a why I don't know if you place it but body Spirits I've spoken of this many times [Music] it just depends on the spirit that is in your spirit humility and foreign and David is saw he's seen David that he killed Goliath he took off his head they came from the victory David sauce and capture this church he began to sing or they began to sing I saw heard that says he was the anointed one of the Lord and he heard that and he said what there came a spirit there are many of us it's also entering to us it's Envy is the spirit of Envy came to him his harp right and then he threw it again conquering yourself he threw it to him what was going on with Saul something else had conquered him I don't want to be that person but God delivers us from being that person he threw it to him twice you know what David did he continued playing because he said the battle's not mine the battle is his amen right because that's a tremendous thing it's conquering yourself for himself conquered himself that's why when he threw the spirit and he respected the anointed one of the Lord and sometimes we're envious this is my brother my sister who am I to decide I want his glory for me that's right I want his group of that envious spirit and with this thought I'm going to be closing David David a man after God's Own Heart on occasion he was anxious thought s I'm the holy person don't get comfortable David was lazy the wife of his brother it doesn't matter who you are yes there David was and he asked who's that lady and so then he brought it come over here wow this morning you need to conquer yourself don't think no pences that's when things happen there David was they sent they sent for him and David apart from being a womanizer And Then There came another Spirit trying to kill him was here making an effect in that impact on David um you know the story and after that send them in the front lines and he said kill him that's pretty much what he did that he was going to die but God help us this morning brothers and Deliver Us from that Spirit of Envy is going to be speaking to us God bless you Brethren um we send greetings to our brothers our brothers from California the ones that they watch us God bless you okay let us open our Bibles Book of Matthew chapter 21 verse 12 and 13. and it says like this Matthew 21 verse 12. it says and Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and over through the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves Palomas and said unto them it is written my house shall be called The House of Prayer but you have made it at the end of Thieves I want you to notice how he didn't say at that momento he didn't say it was his father's house he said it was his house amen amen he was letting him know who he was amen amen we'll go to Hebrews chapter 12 verse Uno Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1. it says like this it says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience to raise the set before us uh we're talking about uh for our title is a Lego is you know I think that's one of the hardest things to do no for many of us is to let go you know but I think in order to move on with God that's one thing that we have to do you can't move forward if you can't let go amen amen you know uh brother uh brother Fidel Romano Fidel he was talking about you know the the senses both the physical ones and as well as the spiritual ones you know and those are the senses that we're fighting yes that's you know quite a bit of Senses but you know God just needs is he needs just one sense and he can defeat the rest of the sentence it's Faith it's Faith uh Faith overcomes all those [Applause] you see faith faith isn't outnumbered do you know I mean it may seem like it but faith is all you need that's all God wants for me amen amen you know and when we are when we go when we read the scripture here you see we see Jesus going into the temple you know and he doesn't like what he sees you know because that was that was his house he said it was his right there amen amen you know I believe Jesus is here I believe that he's here because we invited him you see if we hadn't invited him then I don't believe he or anybody else amen amen you know when we uh and when Jesus doesn't like what he sees you know he starts taking care of business you see I believe Jesus he's the god of action he's just not going to tell you about it but he's going to start doing but he only do what you ask him to do you invited him here she's telling me talking then he's here if you invited him in your house then he's going to do what you asked him to do is in your house amen amen you know I was uh watching it's been a while back you know but I'm sure it's pretty familiar you know I believe uh you know some people they run marathon maybe you know a lot of Christians don't run you know physical marathons but you know I believe that you know if we run a marathon maybe you know you run that marathon on Netflix amen amen you you you run those kind of marathons you know and I believe that you know many of us do that you know it's I mean it's pretty quiet in here okay you know but uh but you know it's the reality of things but one of the things that you know I I one of the shows that I've actually seen is is one of the shows called the hoarders is you know and those people you know they're uh compulsive hoarders amen amen I just wanna I just wanna um just so you know what uh the word compulsive means what the definition is it says it's a resulting from or relating to an irresistible urge is especially one that is against one's conscious wishes amen amen do you know I mean so they don't want to do it but it's just irresistible you know you just just can't hold back you know this body just enjoys it is you get the sticky fingers you know you you get caught you put it down for a little bit sometimes it's kind of hard to let go yeah you know it's it just sticks to to this body is but you know these these hoarders you know they just like the they like to uh they're compulsive did you think those don't like to let go you try to take something from him and they always feel like they they have to have it they have some kind of emotional attachments it's just it's just an emotional attachment it is you know and uh it stops just starts you know and it starts piling up in their house and you know they just don't have the time to uh maybe clean up so you know it might start in the closet uh you know we have any Shoppers around here but you know because there's a compulsive Shoppers you know made as well as women it works both ways these days you know and you could buy things and you don't even take the tag off of it you know it's it's just there yeah yes sir oh you felt like you needed it you thought it might look good on you but it could be there for months and you will forget about it sometimes you don't wear it yo you forgot you had it you know but it's just and then you know it gets a little shameful sometimes you see because things have gotten a little bit out of control you know you haven't been able to handle them you know that's the way they don't know what they told you foreign he doesn't want to be in that field those things he can bring you out Hallelujah Gloria the old version says this in the message enticing spirits he says let go of the world is but the problem says how do you
