[32:06] amen 5
[32:11] verse have it with an amen we
[32:14] can begin to read
[32:18] amen the Lord says in the following
[32:20] manner
[32:44] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[32:47] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[32:49] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[32:51] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[32:53] Seals thereof
[32:58] we're going to pray as a group
[33:00] amen heavenly
[33:03] father in these
[33:05] moments my
[33:07] Lord I believe you've already spoken to
[33:14] me you given me the thought for this
[33:18] morning but I ask that in these
[33:21] moments all of us that are
[33:25] here and those that will be hearing this
[33:29] message able to enter into one same
[33:34] spirit because what good is it for me to
[33:36] speak
[33:39] words the people perhaps aren't
[33:41] capturing what I'm trying
[33:44] to so I just ask you help us to enter
[33:46] into
[33:47] one one same
[33:51] mind for the word to
[33:56] flow in a free way this
[33:59] morning I ask this in the name of the
[34:02] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[34:08] amen while you do
[34:11] it hallelujah
[34:16] hallelujah my theme this
[34:20] morning we've been speaking of the
[34:22] coming of the
[34:26] Lord and I think now for a couple months
[34:28] we've been focusing
[34:31] on we've been focusing on the
[34:36] resurrection it's a very extensive
[34:40] topic we don't know
[34:43] everything we don't understand it
[34:46] all but one thing we do
[34:49] know we want to be a part of that
[34:53] Resurrection something inside of us
[34:57] makes us cry
[35:00] out it makes
[35:02] us desire that
[35:05] Resurrection maybe we don't understand
[35:09] everything I say it for
[35:12] myself but something inside of
[35:16] me and it's crying
[35:19] out for that for that new
[35:23] body this
[35:25] morning I would like to focus
[35:31] under the topic or the
[35:32] [Applause]
[35:35] title claiming what is
[35:38] yours not yours but what is
[35:44] God's claiming what is
[35:50] God I would like to read once again in
[35:52] verse
[35:53] five if you can read it with me
[36:02] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[36:09] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[36:14] Judah the one who is speaking
[36:17] with tells him
[36:21] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[36:25] amen Brothers
[36:28] verse
[36:30] six and I
[36:34] beheld in other words Behold The Lion of
[36:36] the tribe of
[36:39] Judah turns and
[36:41] sees he no longer sees the lion he
[36:45] doesn't see a lion what is it that he
[36:53] sees and in the midst of the thron of
[36:55] the four beasts
[36:58] and in the midst of the
[37:03] elders basically he's seeing many things
[37:06] here in this
[37:10] throne but what is the greater Focus
[37:12] here in this
[37:15] Vision it says that he was
[37:19] standing that he
[37:24] stood from being seated there was a land
[37:27] that was
[37:30] standing almost as though that that lamb
[37:33] was about to make a
[37:35] transition you stand it's because you're
[37:38] going to do something something's gonna
[37:50] happen change direction
[38:00] and when he
[38:05] stands he sees a lamb and that lamb
[38:08] stood as though it had been
[38:17] slain and the writer or
[38:21] the the writer he says that they had
[38:23] seven
[38:25] horns and seven eyes
[38:31] I like something that the Pastor said
[38:32] last
[38:33] week those seven
[38:38] horn one a horn has always typified a
[38:42] kingdom a
[38:47] government upon this
[38:50] government you see seven
[38:53] horns seven different governments
[39:02] these
[39:04] Powers he says he also seven
[39:09] eyes in other words that these Seven
[39:12] Kingdoms amongst the seven there are
[39:15] seven
[39:19] eyes he gives the interpretation
[39:22] to what is it he
[39:25] say there the seven of
[39:28] God sent throughout the
[39:35] Earth so then when we go back once
[39:37] again because when we review because
[39:40] this is Sunday
[39:42] school when John sees the land
[39:45] that seven
[39:50] horns find a picture but I couldn't find
[39:52] it
[39:54] Pastor I didn't want to put something
[39:56] that wasn't that
[39:59] I just leave it up to your
[40:00] imagination that God revealed that to
[40:04] you the lamb is
[40:06] standing he has seven
[40:09] horns and those horns have
[40:12] eyes are the seven
[40:15] Spirit go throughout the Earth are we
[40:22] okay so
[40:26] then this this
[40:28] lamb he's not
[40:32] alone this
[40:34] lamb you don't see him
[40:38] alone a group
[40:41] of included in this with this
[40:49] lamb
[40:51] apocalypsis go to Revelations
[40:54] 4 verse 5
[41:02] are you happy to be here this
[41:06] morning how beautiful is the
[41:11] Bible the more that I read the
[41:14] Bible and the
[41:16] message I
[41:21] realize aligned with the Bible
[41:29] 45
[41:34] says go ahead and out of the
[41:39] throne we're speaking just of that
[41:42] throne in the king in heaven there's a
[41:45] there's a throne

[41:49] Thrones speaking of the same
[41:53] Throne proceed lightning
[41:57] and

[42:20] throne and there were seven lamps of
[42:22] fire burning Before the
[42:24] Throne of Fire

[42:34] fire the first thing I want you to
[42:36] notice is that these
[42:39] lamps there was
[42:44] fire burned by a
[42:47] fire can we be in agreement this

[49:22] were
[49:24] written in 65 amen
[49:27] it

[49:33] think of those seven
[49:36] lands drawing
[49:41] life drawing life from
[49:46] somewhere don't have their own kind of
[49:49] Life they obtain life from somewhere
[49:55] else abstract
[49:58] abct the
[50:00] fire can't
[50:06] alive to be
[50:10] connected of
[50:16] life don't shine just to
[50:18] sh
[50:22] can't by your
[50:24] own connected
[50:27] Fountain of
[50:28] Life to the to the inexhaustible
[50:32] life then you'll be able to
[50:35] shine you can light your
[50:44] Wick there he's
[50:46] representing every
[50:50] messenger of the
[50:54] church their life is on fire
[51:01] the life is on fire with the
[51:04] fire of the Holy Spirit put that picture
[51:08] back please
[51:11] so every
[51:15] Wick is
[51:18] lit it
[51:20] represents now we're going to get a
[51:22] little bit
[51:26] what we just got in reading it was the
[51:29] light for that
[51:33] age okay okay those seven
[51:37] eyes the
[51:40] Revelation that that age
[51:42] needed so that it could
[51:45] shine getting ahead of
[51:47] myself you'll follow me this morning
[51:54] amen his wig
[51:57] your
[51:58] Wick he says it here in
[52:00] parenthesis his
[52:05] life do you realize how important it is
[52:08] for your life to be
[52:12] connected the seven
[52:17] Messengers found the Fountain of
[52:20] Life they were able to connect to
[52:23] that as a result they brought light
[52:27] you
[52:29] connect of
[52:32] fire that
[52:34] that that
[52:36] activates you will produce
[52:39] that that same
[52:47] fire I love
[52:51] this your
[52:54] life has been or their life has has been
[52:59] submerged months ago at the camp we
[53:01] spoke of these things do you
[53:07] remember the the five wise
[53:10] virgins and the five foolish okay
[53:19] okay they've
[53:21] been through that Wick he is
[53:27] they are abstracting that same Life of
[53:34] Christ it is the same Life of
[53:43] Christ and through that same he's giving
[53:45] light to the
[53:48] church so the
[53:52] messenger or the man of every age that
[53:54] God Rose
[53:56] able to submerge
[53:58] himself to that Fountain of Life or
[54:02] fire extract of that same
[54:06] light then to be a light to that same
[54:09] age is that is that true or am I
[54:12] wrong your
[54:17] amen will give a great punctuation to
[54:19] this word
